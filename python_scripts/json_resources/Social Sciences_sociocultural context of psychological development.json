To be accepted as an\neducated person is a noble and desirable goal to aspire to. Unfortunately, the\ncosts of education have risen exponentially over the years and is out of reach to a\ngrowing segment of our population. Getting an education often leaves a person\ndeep in debt when they accept their diploma. Books are the principal tool used to\naccomplish this lofty pursuit and they are a major player in this increase cost of\neducation. Educators have long been concerned about the cost of textbooks. This\nis the main reason for this project.\nThis Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development compendium was\ncreated, using Open Education Resources (OER), to meet the Student Learning\nOutcomes (SLO) for Psy41. OER comprises learning materials that can be\ndownloaded, edited, and shared at no cost to the recipient.

(Photo courtesy of Chris\nBarnes/flickr)\nWhat are the rules when you pass an acquaintance at school, work, in the grocery\nstore, or in the mall? Generally, we do not consider all of the intricacies of the\nrules of behavior. We may simply say, \"Hello!\" and ask, \"How was your\nweekend?\" or some other trivial question meant to be a friendly greeting. Rarely\ndo we physically embrace or even touch the individual. In fact, doing so may be\nviewed with scorn or distaste, since as people in the United States we have fairly\nrigid rules about personal space. However, we all adhere to various rules and\nstandards that are created and maintained in culture. These rules and\nexpectations have meaning, and there are ways in which you may violate this\nnegotiation. Consider what would happen if you stopped and informed everyone\nwho said, \"Hi, how are you?\" exactly how you were doing that day, and in detail. You would more than likely violate rules of culture and specifically greeting.\nPerhaps in a different culture the question would be more literal, and it may\nrequire a response. Or if you are having coffee with a good friend, perhaps that\nquestion warrants a more detailed response. These examples are all aspects\nof culture, which is shared beliefs, values, and practices, that participants must\nlearn. Sociologically, we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is\nexpected, and in which situations perhaps it is not. These rules are created and\nenforced by people who interact and share culture.\nIn everyday conversation, people rarely distinguish between the\nterms culture and society, but the terms have slightly different meanings, and the\ndistinction is important to a sociologist. A society describes a group of people who\nshare a community and a culture. By \u201ccommunity,\u201d sociologists refer to a\ndefinable region\u2014as small as a neighborhood (Brooklyn, or \u201cthe east side of\ntown\u201d), as large as a country (Ethiopia, the United States, or Nepal), or\nsomewhere in between (in the United States, this might include someone who\nidentifies with Southern or Midwestern society). To clarify, a culture represents\nthe beliefs and practices of a group, while society represents the people who share\nthose beliefs and practices. Neither society nor culture could exist without the\nother. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between culture and society in\ngreater detail and pay special attention to the elements and forces that shape\nculture, including diversity and cultural changes. A final discussion touches on the\ndifferent theoretical perspectives from which sociologists research culture.\nGlossary\nculture\nshared beliefs, values, and practices\nsociety\npeople who live in a definable community and who share a culture\n\u00a9 Mar 13, 2015 OpenStax.

What Is Culture?\nDerived from What Is Culture? by OpenStax\nHumans are social creatures. Since the dawn of Homo sapiens nearly 250,000 years\nago, people have grouped together into communities in order to survive. Living\ntogether, people form common habits and behaviors\u2014from specific methods of\nchildrearing to preferred techniques for obtaining food. In modern-day Paris,\nmany people shop daily at outdoor markets to pick up what they need for their\nevening meal, buying cheese, meat, and vegetables from different specialty stalls.\nIn the United States, the majority of people shop once a week at supermarkets,\nfilling large carts to the brim. How would a Parisian perceive U.S. shopping\nbehaviors that Americans take for granted?\nAlmost every human behavior, from shopping to marriage to expressions of\nfeelings, is learned. In the United States, people tend to view marriage as a choice\nbetween two people, based on mutual feelings of love. In other nations and in\nother times, marriages have been arranged through an intricate process of\ninterviews and negotiations between entire families, or in other cases, through a\ndirect system, such as a \u201cmail order bride.\u201d To someone raised in New York City,\nthe marriage customs of a family from Nigeria may seem strange or even wrong.\nConversely, someone from a traditional Kolkata family might be perplexed with\nthe idea of romantic love as the foundation for marriage and lifelong\ncommitment. In other words, the way in which people view marriage depends\nlargely on what they have been taught.\nBehavior based on learned customs is not a bad thing. Being familiar with\nunwritten rules helps people feel secure and \u201cnormal.\u201d Most people want to live\ntheir daily lives confident that their behaviors will not be challenged or disrupted.\nBut even an action as seemingly simple as commuting to work evidences a great\ndeal of cultural propriety. How would a visitor from the suburban United States act and feel on this crowded\nTokyo train? (Photo courtesy of simonglucas/flickr)\nTake the case of going to work on public transportation. Whether people are\ncommuting in Dublin, Cairo, Mumbai, or San Francisco, many behaviors will be\nthe same, but significant differences also arise between cultures. Typically, a\npassenger will find a marked bus stop or station, wait for his bus or train, pay an\nagent before or after boarding, and quietly take a seat if one is available. But\nwhen boarding a bus in Cairo, passengers might have to run, because buses there often do not come to a full stop to take on patrons. Dublin bus riders would be\nexpected to extend an arm to indicate that they want the bus to stop for them.\nAnd when boarding a commuter train in Mumbai, passengers must squeeze into\noverstuffed cars amid a lot of pushing and shoving on the crowded platforms.\nThat kind of behavior would be considered the height of rudeness in the United\nStates, but in Mumbai it reflects the daily challenges of getting around on a train\nsystem that is taxed to capacity.\nIn this example of commuting, culture consists of thoughts (expectations about\npersonal space, for example) and tangible things (bus stops, trains, and seating\ncapacity). Material culture refers to the objects or belongings of a group of\npeople. Metro passes and bus tokens are part of material culture, as are\nautomobiles, stores, and the physical structures where people\nworship.Nonmaterial culture, in contrast, consists of the ideas, attitudes, and\nbeliefs of a society. Material and nonmaterial aspects of culture are linked, and\nphysical objects often symbolize cultural ideas. A metro pass is a material object,\nbut it represents a form of nonmaterial culture, namely, capitalism, and the\nacceptance of paying for transportation. Clothing, hairstyles, and jewelry are part\nof material culture, but the appropriateness of wearing certain clothing for\nspecific events reflects nonmaterial culture. A school building belongs to material\nculture, but the teaching methods and educational standards are part of\neducation\u2019s nonmaterial culture. These material and nonmaterial aspects of\nculture can vary subtly from region to region. As people travel farther afield,\nmoving from different regions to entirely different parts of the world, certain\nmaterial and nonmaterial aspects of culture become dramatically unfamiliar.\nWhat happens when we encounter different cultures? As we interact with\ncultures other than our own, we become more aware of the differences and\ncommonalities between others\u2019 worlds and our own.\nCultural Universals\nOften, a comparison of one culture to another will reveal obvious differences. But\nall cultures also share common elements. Cultural universals are patterns or traits\nthat are globally common to all societies. One example of a cultural universal is\nthe family unit: every human society recognizes a family structure that regulates\nsexual reproduction and the care of children. Even so, how that family unit is\ndefined and how it functions vary. In many Asian cultures, for example, family\nmembers from all generations commonly live together in one household. In these cultures, young adults continue to live in the extended household family structure\nuntil they marry and join their spouse\u2019s household, or they may remain and raise\ntheir nuclear family within the extended family\u2019s homestead. In the United States,\nby contrast, individuals are expected to leave home and live independently for a\nperiod before forming a family unit that consists of parents and their offspring.\nOther cultural universals include customs like funeral rites, weddings, and\ncelebrations of births. However, each culture may view the ceremonies quite\ndifferently.\nAnthropologist George Murdock first recognized the existence of cultural\nuniversals while studying systems of kinship around the world. Murdock found\nthat cultural universals often revolve around basic human survival, such as finding\nfood, clothing, and shelter, or around shared human experiences, such as birth\nand death or illness and healing. Through his research, Murdock identified other\nuniversals including language, the concept of personal names, and, interestingly,\njokes. Humor seems to be a universal way to release tensions and create a sense\nof unity among people (Murdock 1949). Sociologists consider humor necessary to\nhuman interaction because it helps individuals navigate otherwise tense\nsituations.\nIS MUSIC A CULTURAL UNIVERSAL?\nImagine that you are sitting in a theater, watching a film. The movie opens with\nthe heroine sitting on a park bench with a grim expression on her face. Cue the\nmusic. The first slow and mournful notes play in a minor key. As the melody\ncontinues, the heroine turns her head and sees a man walking toward her. The\nmusic slowly gets louder, and the dissonance of the chords sends a prickle of fear\nrunning down your spine. You sense that the heroine is in danger.\nNow imagine that you are watching the same movie, but with a different\nsoundtrack. As the scene opens, the music is soft and soothing, with a hint of\nsadness. You see the heroine sitting on the park bench and sense her loneliness.\nSuddenly, the music swells. The woman looks up and sees a man walking toward\nher. The music grows fuller, and the pace picks up. You feel your heart rise in your\nchest. This is a happy moment. Music has the ability to evoke emotional responses. In television shows, movies,\neven commercials, music elicits laughter, sadness, or fear. Are these types of\nmusical cues cultural universals?\nIn 2009, a team of psychologists, led by Thomas Fritz of the Max Planck Institute\nfor Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, studied people\u2019s\nreactions to music that they\u2019d never heard (Fritz et al. 2009). The research team\ntraveled to Cameroon, Africa, and asked Mafa tribal members to listen to\nWestern music. The tribe, isolated from Western culture, had never been exposed\nto Western culture and had no context or experience within which to interpret its\nmusic. Even so, as the tribal members listened to a Western piano piece, they\nwere able to recognize three basic emotions: happiness, sadness, and fear. Music,\nit turns out, is a sort of universal language.\nResearchers also found that music can foster a sense of wholeness within a group.\nIn fact, scientists who study the evolution of language have concluded that\noriginally language (an established component of group identity) and music were\none (Darwin 1871). Additionally, since music is largely nonverbal, the sounds of\nmusic can cross societal boundaries more easily than words. Music allows people\nto make connections, where language might be a more difficult barricade. As Fritz\nand his team found, music and the emotions it conveys can be cultural universals.\nEthnocentrism and Cultural Relativism\nDespite how much humans have in common, cultural differences are far more\nprevalent than cultural universals. For example, while all cultures have language,\nanalysis of particular language structures and conversational etiquette reveal\ntremendous differences. In some Middle Eastern cultures, it is common to stand\nclose to others in conversation. North Americans keep more distance and\nmaintain a large \u201cpersonal space.\u201d Even something as simple as eating and\ndrinking varies greatly from culture to culture. If your professor comes into an\nearly morning class holding a mug of liquid, what do you assume she is drinking?\nIn the United States, it\u2019s most likely filled with coffee, not Earl Grey tea, a favorite\nin England, or Yak Butter tea, a staple in Tibet.\nThe way cuisines vary across cultures fascinates many people. Some travelers\npride themselves on their willingness to try unfamiliar foods, like celebrated food writer Anthony Bourdain, while others return home expressing gratitude for their\nnative culture\u2019s fare. Often, people in the United States express disgust at other\ncultures\u2019 cuisine and think that it\u2019s gross to eat meat from a dog or guinea pig, for\nexample, while they don\u2019t question their own habit of eating cows or pigs. Such\nattitudes are an example ofethnocentrism, or evaluating and judging another\nculture based on how it compares to one\u2019s own cultural norms. Ethnocentrism, as\nsociologist William Graham Sumner (1906) described the term, involves a belief or\nattitude that one\u2019s own culture is better than all others. Almost everyone is a little\nbit ethnocentric. For example, Americans tend to say that people from England\ndrive on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the road, rather than on the \u201cother\u201d side. Someone\nfrom a country where dog meat is standard fare might find it off-putting to see a\ndog in a French restaurant\u2014not on the menu, but as a pet and patron\u2019s\ncompanion. A good example of ethnocentrism is referring to parts of Asia as the\n\"Far East.\" One might question, \"Far east of where?\"\nA high level of appreciation for one\u2019s own culture can be healthy; a shared sense\nof community pride, for example, connects people in a society. But ethnocentrism\ncan lead to disdain or dislike for other cultures and could cause misunderstanding\nand conflict. People with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to\n\u201chelp\u201d its people, because they see them as uneducated or backward\u2014essentially\ninferior. In reality, these travelers are guilty of cultural imperialism, the deliberate\nimposition of one\u2019s own cultural values on another culture. Europe\u2019s colonial\nexpansion, begun in the sixteenth century, was often accompanied by a severe\ncultural imperialism. European colonizers often viewed the people in the lands\nthey colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance,\ndress, religion, and other cultural practices. A more modern example of cultural\nimperialism may include the work of international aid agencies who introduce\nagricultural methods and plant species from developed countries while\noverlooking indigenous varieties and agricultural approaches that are better\nsuited to the particular region.\nEthnocentrism can be so strong that when confronted with all of the differences\nof a new culture, one may experience disorientation and frustration. In sociology,\nwe call this culture shock. A traveler from Chicago might find the nightly silence of\nrural Montana unsettling, not peaceful. An exchange student from China might be\nannoyed by the constant interruptions in class as other students ask questions\u2014a\npractice that is considered rude in China. Perhaps the Chicago traveler was\ninitially captivated with Montana\u2019s quiet beauty and the Chinese student was originally excited to see a U.S.-style classroom firsthand. But as they experience\nunanticipated differences from their own culture, their excitement gives way to\ndiscomfort and doubts about how to behave appropriately in the new situation.\nEventually, as people learn more about a culture, they recover from culture\nshock.\nCulture shock may appear because people aren\u2019t always expecting cultural\ndifferences. Anthropologist Ken Barger (1971) discovered this when he conducted\na participatory observation in an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic.\nOriginally from Indiana, Barger hesitated when invited to join a local snowshoe\nrace. He knew he\u2019d never hold his own against these experts. Sure enough, he\nfinished last, to his mortification. But the tribal members congratulated him,\nsaying, \u201cYou really tried!\u201d In Barger\u2019s own culture, he had learned to value victory.\nTo the Inuit people, winning was enjoyable, but their culture valued survival skills\nessential to their environment: how hard someone tried could mean the\ndifference between life and death. Over the course of his stay, Barger participated\nin caribou hunts, learned how to take shelter in winter storms, and sometimes\nwent days with little or no food to share among tribal members. Trying hard and\nworking together, two nonmaterial values, were indeed much more important\nthan winning.\nDuring his time with the Inuit tribe, Barger learned to engage in cultural\nrelativism. Cultural relativism is the practice of assessing a culture by its own\nstandards rather than viewing it through the lens of one\u2019s own culture. Practicing\ncultural relativism requires an open mind and a willingness to consider, and even\nadapt to, new values and norms. However, indiscriminately embracing everything\nabout a new culture is not always possible. Even the most culturally relativist\npeople from egalitarian societies\u2014ones in which women have political rights and\ncontrol over their own bodies\u2014would question whether the widespread practice\nof female genital mutilation in countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan should be\naccepted as a part of cultural tradition. Sociologists attempting to engage in\ncultural relativism, then, may struggle to reconcile aspects of their own culture\nwith aspects of a culture that they are studying.\nSometimes when people attempt to rectify feelings of ethnocentrism and develop\ncultural relativism, they swing too far to the other end of the\nspectrum. Xenocentrism is the opposite of ethnocentrism, and refers to the belief\nthat another culture is superior to one\u2019s own. (The Greek root word xeno, pronounced \u201cZEE-no,\u201d means \u201cstranger\u201d or \u201cforeign guest.\u201d) An exchange student\nwho goes home after a semester abroad or a sociologist who returns from the\nfield may find it difficult to associate with the values of their own culture after\nhaving experienced what they deem a more upright or nobler way of living.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge for sociologists studying different cultures is the\nmatter of keeping a perspective. It is impossible for anyone to keep all cultural\nbiases at bay; the best we can do is strive to be aware of them. Pride in one\u2019s own\nculture doesn\u2019t have to lead to imposing its values on others. And an appreciation\nfor another culture shouldn\u2019t preclude individuals from studying it with a critical\neye.\nOVERCOMING CULTURE SHOCK\nDuring her summer vacation, Caitlin flew from Chicago to Madrid to visit Maria,\nthe exchange student she\u2019d befriended the previous semester. In the airport, she\nheard rapid, musical Spanish being spoken all around her. Exciting as it was, she\nfelt isolated and disconnected. Maria\u2019s mother kissed Caitlin on both cheeks when\nshe greeted her. Her imposing father kept his distance. Caitlin was half asleep by\nthe time supper was served\u2014at 10 p.m.! Maria\u2019s family sat at the table for hours,\nspeaking loudly, gesturing, and arguing about politics, a taboo dinner subject in\nCaitlin\u2019s house. They served wine and toasted their honored guest. Caitlin had\ntrouble interpreting her hosts\u2019 facial expressions, and didn\u2019t realize she should\nmake the next toast. That night, Caitlin crawled into a strange bed, wishing she\nhadn\u2019t come. She missed her home and felt overwhelmed by the new customs,\nlanguage, and surroundings. She\u2019d studied Spanish in school for years\u2014why\nhadn\u2019t it prepared her for this?\nWhat Caitlin hadn\u2019t realized was that people depend not only on spoken words\nbut also on subtle cues like gestures and facial expressions, to communicate.\nCultural norms accompany even the smallest nonverbal signals (DuBois 1951).\nThey help people know when to shake hands, where to sit, how to converse, and\neven when to laugh. We relate to others through a shared set of cultural norms,\nand ordinarily, we take them for granted.\nFor this reason, culture shock is often associated with traveling abroad, although\nit can happen in one\u2019s own country, state, or even hometown. Anthropologist\nKalervo Oberg (1960) is credited with first coining the term \u201cculture shock.\u201d In his studies, Oberg found that most people found encountering a new culture to be\nexciting at first. But bit by bit, they became stressed by interacting with people\nfrom a different culture who spoke another language and used different regional\nexpressions. There was new food to digest, new daily schedules to follow, and\nnew rules of etiquette to learn. Living with this constant stress can make people\nfeel incompetent and insecure. People react to frustration in a new culture, Oberg\nfound, by initially rejecting it and glorifying one\u2019s own culture. An American\nvisiting Italy might long for a \u201creal\u201d pizza or complain about the unsafe driving\nhabits of Italians compared to people in the United States.\nIt helps to remember that culture is learned. Everyone is ethnocentric to an\nextent, and identifying with one\u2019s own country is natural.\nCaitlin\u2019s shock was minor compared to that of her friends Dayar and Mahlika, a\nTurkish couple living in married student housing on campus. And it was nothing\nlike that of her classmate Sanai. Sanai had been forced to flee war-torn Bosnia\nwith her family when she was fifteen. After two weeks in Spain, Caitlin had\ndeveloped a bit more compassion and understanding for what those people had\ngone through. She understood that adjusting to a new culture takes time. It can\ntake weeks or months to recover from culture shock, and it can take years to fully\nadjust to living in a new culture.\nBy the end of Caitlin\u2019s trip, she\u2019d made new lifelong friends. She\u2019d stepped out of\nher comfort zone. She\u2019d learned a lot about Spain, but she\u2019d also discovered a lot\nabout herself and her own culture. Experiencing new cultures offers an opportunity to practice cultural relativism.\n(Photo courtesy of OledSidorenko/flickr)\nSummary\nThough \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d are often used interchangeably, they have\ndifferent meanings.

Values are a culture\u2019s standard for discerning what is good and\njust in society. Values are deeply embedded and critical for transmitting and\nteaching a culture\u2019s beliefs. Beliefs are the tenets or convictions that people hold\nto be true. Individuals in a society have specific beliefs, but they also share\ncollective values. To illustrate the difference, Americans commonly believe in the\nAmerican Dream\u2014that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is the American value that wealth is good and\nimportant.\nValues help shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and\nugly, sought or avoided. Consider the value that the United States places upon\nyouth. Children represent innocence and purity, while a youthful adult\nappearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value, individuals spend millions of\ndollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and beautiful.\nThe United States also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high\nvalue on individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are\ncollectivist, meaning the welfare of the group and group relationships are a\nprimary value.\nLiving up to a culture\u2019s values can be difficult. It\u2019s easy to value good health, but\nit\u2019s hard to quit smoking. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage\nin infidelity. Cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all people are valued in\nthe United States, yet the country\u2019s highest political offices have been dominated\nby white men.\nValues often suggest how people should behave, but they don\u2019t accurately reflect\nhow people do behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society\nwould like to embrace and live up to. But ideal culture differs from real culture,\nthe way society actually is, based on what occurs and exists. In an ideal culture,\nthere would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real\nculture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive\nto prevent or repair those accidents, crimes, and injustices. American teenagers\nare encouraged to value celibacy. However, the number of unplanned\npregnancies among teens reveals that not only is the ideal hard to live up to, but\nthe value alone is not enough to spare teenagers the potential consequences of\nhaving sex.\nOne way societies strive to put values into action is through rewards, sanctions,\nand punishments. When people observe the norms of society and uphold its\nvalues, they are often rewarded. A boy who helps an elderly woman board a bus\nmay receive a smile and a \u201cthank you.\u201d A business manager who raises profit\nmargins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction certain behaviors by\ngiving their support, approval, or permission, or by instilling formal actions of\ndisapproval and nonsupport. Sanctions are a form of social control, a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms. Sometimes people conform to norms in\nanticipation or expectation of positive sanctions: good grades, for instance, may\nmean praise from parents and teachers. From a criminal justice perspective,\nproperly used social control is also inexpensive crime control. Utilizing social\ncontrol approaches pushes most people to conform to societal rules, regardless of\nwhether authority figures (such as law enforcement) are present.\nWhen people go against a society\u2019s values, they are punished. A boy who shoves\nan elderly woman aside to board the bus first may receive frowns or even a\nscolding from other passengers. A business manager who drives away customers\nwill likely be fired. Breaking norms and rejecting values can lead to cultural\nsanctions such as earning a negative label\u2014lazy, no-good bum\u2014or to legal\nsanctions, such as traffic tickets, fines, or imprisonment.\nValues are not static; they vary across time and between groups as people\nevaluate, debate, and change collective societal beliefs. Values also vary from\nculture to culture. For example, cultures differ in their values about what kinds of\nphysical closeness are appropriate in public. It\u2019s rare to see two male friends or\ncoworkers holding hands in the United States where that behavior often\nsymbolizes romantic feelings. But in many nations, masculine physical intimacy is\nconsidered natural in public. This difference in cultural values came to light when\npeople reacted to photos of former president George W. Bush holding hands with\nthe Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2005. A simple gesture, such as hand-holding,\ncarries great symbolic differences across cultures. In many parts of Africa and the Middle East, it is considered normal for men to\nhold hands in friendship. How would Americans react to these two soldiers?\n(Photo courtesy of Geordie Mott/Wikimedia Commons)\nNorms\nSo far, the examples in this chapter have often described how people are\nexpected to behave in certain situations\u2014for example, when buying food or\nboarding a bus. These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct\nthrough which societies are structured, or what sociologists call\nnorms. Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has\ndefined as good, right, and important, and most members of the society adhere\nto them.\nFormal norms are established, written rules. They are behaviors worked out and\nagreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people. Laws are formal norms,\nbut so are employee manuals, college entrance exam requirements, and \u201cno\nrunning\u201d signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most specific and clearly\nstated of the various types of norms, and they are the most strictly enforced. But\neven formal norms are enforced to varying degrees and are reflected in cultural\nvalues. For example, money is highly valued in the United States, so monetary crimes are\npunished. It\u2019s against the law to rob a bank, and banks go to great lengths to\nprevent such crimes. People safeguard valuable possessions and install antitheft\ndevices to protect homes and cars. A less strictly enforced social norm is driving\nwhile intoxicated. While it\u2019s against the law to drive drunk, drinking is for the\nmost part an acceptable social behavior. And though there are laws to punish\ndrunk driving, there are few systems in place to prevent the crime. These\nexamples show a range of enforcement in formal norms.\nThere are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms\u2014casual\nbehaviors that are generally and widely conformed to\u2014is longer. People learn\ninformal norms by observation, imitation, and general socialization. Some\ninformal norms are taught directly\u2014\u201cKiss your Aunt Edna\u201d or \u201cUse your napkin\u201d\u2014\nwhile others are learned by observation, including observations of the\nconsequences when someone else violates a norm. But although informal norms\ndefine personal interactions, they extend into other systems as well. In the United\nStates, there are informal norms regarding behavior at fast food restaurants.\nCustomers line up to order their food and leave when they are done. They don\u2019t\nsit down at a table with strangers, sing loudly as they prepare their condiments,\nor nap in a booth. Most people don\u2019t commit even benign breaches of informal\nnorms. Informal norms dictate appropriate behaviors without the need of written\nrules.\nBREACHING EXPERIMENTS\nSociologist Harold Garfinkel (1917\u20132011) studied people\u2019s customs in order to\nfind out how societal rules and norms not only influenced behavior but also\nshaped social order. He believed that members of society together create a social\norder (Weber 2011). His resulting book, Studies in Ethnomethodology, published in\n1967, discusses people\u2019s assumptions about the social makeup of their\ncommunities.\nOne of Garfinkel's research methods was known as a \u201cbreaching experiment,\u201d in\nwhich the researcher behaves in a socially awkward manner in order to test the\nsociological concepts of social norms and conformity. The participants are not\naware an experiment is in progress. If the breach is successful, however, these\n\u201cinnocent bystanders\u201d will respond in some way. For example, if the\nexperimenter is, say, a man in a business suit, and he skips down the sidewalk or hops on one foot, the passersby are likely to stare at him with surprised\nexpressions on their faces. But the experimenter does not simply \u201cact weird\u201d in\npublic. Rather, the point is to deviate from a specific social norm in a small way, to\nsubtly break some form of social etiquette, and see what happens.\nTo conduct his ethnomethodology, Garfinkel deliberately imposed strange\nbehaviors on unknowing people. Then he observed their responses. He suspected\nthat odd behaviors would shatter conventional expectations, but he wasn\u2019t sure\nhow. For example, he set up a simple game of tic-tac-toe. One player was asked\nbeforehand to mark Xs and Os not in the boxes but on the lines dividing the\nspaces instead. The other player, in the dark about the study, was flabbergasted\nand did not know how to continue. The second player's reactions of outrage,\nanger, puzzlement, or other emotions illustrated the existence of cultural norms\nthat constitute social life. These cultural norms play an important role. They let us\nknow how to behave around each other and how to feel comfortable in our\ncommunity.\nThere are many rules about speaking with strangers in public. It\u2019s OK to tell a\nwoman you like her shoes. It\u2019s not OK to ask if you can try them on. It\u2019s OK to\nstand in line behind someone at the ATM. It\u2019s not OK to look over his shoulder as\nhe makes his transaction. It\u2019s OK to sit beside someone on a crowded bus. It\u2019s\nweird to sit beside a stranger in a half-empty bus.\nFor some breaches, the researcher directly engages with innocent bystanders. An\nexperimenter might strike up a conversation in a public bathroom, where it\u2019s\ncommon to respect each other\u2019s privacy so fiercely as to ignore other people\u2019s\npresence. In a grocery store, an experimenter might take a food item out of\nanother person\u2019s grocery cart, saying, \u201cThat looks good! I think I\u2019ll try it.\u201d An\nexperimenter might sit down at a table with others in a fast food restaurant or\nfollow someone around a museum and study the same paintings. In those cases,\nthe bystanders are pressured to respond, and their discomfort illustrates how\nmuch we depend on social norms. Breaching experiments uncover and explore\nthe many unwritten social rules we live by.\nNorms may be further classified as either mores or folkways. Mores (mor-ays) are\nnorms that embody the moral views and principles of a group. Violating them can\nhave serious consequences. The strongest mores are legally protected with laws\nor other formal norms. In the United States, for instance, murder is considered immoral, and it\u2019s punishable by law (a formal norm). But more often, mores are\njudged and guarded by public sentiment (an informal norm). People who violate\nmores are seen as shameful. They can even be shunned or banned from some\ngroups. The mores of the U.S. school system require that a student\u2019s writing be in\nthe student\u2019s own words or use special forms (such as quotation marks and a\nwhole system of citation) for crediting other writers. Writing another person\u2019s\nwords as if they are one\u2019s own has a name\u2014plagiarism. The consequences for\nviolating this norm are severe and usually result in expulsion.\nUnlike mores, folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings. Rather,\nfolkways direct appropriate behavior in the day-to-day practices and expressions\nof a culture. They indicate whether to shake hands or kiss on the cheek when\ngreeting another person. They specify whether to wear a tie and blazer or a T-\nshirt and sandals to an event. In Canada, women can smile and say hello to men\non the street. In Egypt, that\u2019s not acceptable. In regions in the southern United\nStates, bumping into an acquaintance means stopping to chat. It\u2019s considered\nrude not to, no matter how busy one is. In other regions, people guard their\nprivacy and value time efficiency. A simple nod of the head is enough. Other\naccepted folkways in the United States may include holding the door open for a\nstranger or giving someone a gift on their birthday. The rules regarding these\nfolkways may change from culture to culture.\nMany folkways are actions we take for granted. People need to act without\nthinking in order to get seamlessly through daily routines; they can\u2019t stop and\nanalyze every action (Sumner 1906). Those who experience culture shock may\nfind that it subsides as they learn the new culture\u2019s folkways and are able to move\nthrough their daily routines more smoothly. Folkways might be small manners,\nlearned by observation and imitated, but they are by no means trivial. Like mores\nand laws, these norms help people negotiate their daily lives within a given\nculture.\nSymbols and Language\nHumans, consciously and subconsciously, are always striving to make sense of\ntheir surrounding world. Symbols\u2014such as gestures, signs, objects, signals, and\nwords\u2014help people understand that world. They provide clues to understanding\nexperiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies. The world is filled with symbols. Sports uniforms, company logos, and traffic signs\nare symbols. In some cultures, a gold ring is a symbol of marriage. Some symbols\nare highly functional; stop signs, for instance, provide useful instruction. As\nphysical objects, they belong to material culture, but because they function as\nsymbols, they also convey nonmaterial cultural meanings. Some symbols are\nvaluable only in what they represent. Trophies, blue ribbons, or gold medals, for\nexample, serve no other purpose than to represent accomplishments. But many\nobjects have both material and nonmaterial symbolic value.\nA police officer\u2019s badge and uniform are symbols of authority and law\nenforcement. The sight of an officer in uniform or a squad car triggers\nreassurance in some citizens, and annoyance, fear, or anger in others.\nIt\u2019s easy to take symbols for granted. Few people challenge or even think about\nstick figure signs on the doors of public bathrooms. But those figures are more\nthan just symbols that tell men and women which bathrooms to use. They also\nuphold the value, in the United States, that public restrooms should be gender\nexclusive. Even though stalls are relatively private, most places don\u2019t offer unisex\nbathrooms. Some road signs are universal. But how would you interpret the signage on the\nright? (Photo (a) courtesy of Andrew Bain/flickr; Photo (b) courtesy of\nHonzaSoukup/flickr)\nSymbols often get noticed when they are out of context. Used unconventionally,\nthey convey strong messages. A stop sign on the door of a corporation makes a\npolitical statement, as does a camouflage military jacket worn in an antiwar\nprotest. Together, the semaphore signals for \u201cN\u201d and \u201cD\u201d represent nuclear\ndisarmament\u2014and form the well-known peace sign (Westcott 2008). Today,\nsome college students have taken to wearing pajamas and bedroom slippers to\nclass, clothing that was formerly associated only with privacy and bedtime.\nThough students might deny it, the outfit defies traditional cultural norms and\nmakes a statement.\nEven the destruction of symbols is symbolic. Effigies representing public figures\nare burned to demonstrate anger at certain leaders. In 1989, crowds tore down\nthe Berlin Wall, a decades-old symbol of the division between East and West\nGermany, communism, and capitalism.\nWhile different cultures have varying systems of symbols, one symbol is common\nto all: language. Language is a symbolic system through which people\ncommunicate and through which culture is transmitted. Some languages contain\na system of symbols used for written communication, while others rely on only\nspoken communication and nonverbal actions.\nSocieties often share a single language, and many languages contain the same\nbasic elements. An alphabet is a written system made of symbolic shapes that\nrefer to spoken sound. Taken together, these symbols convey specific meanings.\nThe English alphabet uses a combination of twenty-six letters to create words;\nthese twenty-six letters make up over 600,000 recognized English words (OED\nOnline 2011).\nRules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region.\nDo you refer to a can of carbonated liquid as \u201csoda,\u201d pop,\u201d or \u201cCoke\u201d? Is a\nhousehold entertainment room a \u201cfamily room,\u201d \u201crec room,\u201d or \u201cden\u201d? When\nleaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a \u201ccheck,\u201d the \u201cticket,\u201d or your\n\u201cbill\u201d? Language is constantly evolving as societies create new ideas. In this age of\ntechnology, people have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as \u201ce-mail\u201d\nand \u201cInternet,\u201d and verbs such as \u201cdownloading,\u201d \u201ctexting,\u201d and \u201cblogging.\u201d\nTwenty years ago, the general public would have considered these nonsense\nwords.\nEven while it constantly evolves, language continues to shape our reality. This\ninsight was established in the 1920s by two linguists, Edward Sapir and Benjamin\nWhorf. They believed that reality is culturally determined, and that any\ninterpretation of reality is based on a society\u2019s language. To prove this point, the\nsociologists argued that every language has words or expressions specific to that\nlanguage. In the United States, for example, the number thirteen is associated\nwith bad luck. In Japan, however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it\nis pronounced similarly to the Japanese word for \u201cdeath.\u201d\nThe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their\nworld through their language, and that they therefore understand their world\nthrough the culture embedded in their language. The hypothesis, which has also\nbeen called linguistic relativity, states that language shapes thought (Swoyer\n2003). Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the\nword \u201cambivalent,\u201d they don\u2019t recognize an experience of uncertainty from\nhaving conflicting positive and negative feelings about one issue. Essentially, the\nhypothesis argues, if a person can\u2019t describe the experience, the person is not\nhaving the experience.\nIn addition to using language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal\ncommunication is symbolic, and, as in the case of language, much of it is learned\nthrough one\u2019s culture. Some gestures are nearly universal: smiles often represent\njoy, and crying often represents sadness. Other nonverbal symbols vary across\ncultural contexts in their meaning. A thumbs-up, for example, indicates positive\nreinforcement in the United States, whereas in Russia and Australia, it is an\noffensive curse (Passero 2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the\nsituation and the person. A wave of the hand can mean many things, depending\non how it\u2019s done and for whom. It may mean \u201chello,\u201d \u201cgoodbye,\u201d \u201cno thank you,\u201d\nor \u201cI\u2019m royalty.\u201d Winks convey a variety of messages, including \u201cWe have a\nsecret,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only kidding,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m attracted to you.\u201d From a distance, a person\ncan understand the emotional gist of two people in conversation just by watching\ntheir body language and facial expressions. Furrowed brows and folded arms indicate a serious topic, possibly an argument. Smiles, with heads lifted and arms\nopen, suggest a lighthearted, friendly chat.\nIS THE UNITED STATES BILINGUAL?\nIn 1991, when she was six years old, Lucy Alvarez attended a school that allowed\nfor the use of both English and Spanish. Lucy\u2019s teacher was bilingual, the librarian\noffered bilingual books, and many of the school staff spoke both Spanish and\nEnglish. Lucy and many of her classmates who spoke only Spanish at home were\nlucky. According to the U.S. Census, 13.8 percent of U.S. residents speak a non-\nEnglish language at home. That\u2019s a significant figure, but not enough to ensure\nthat Lucy would be encouraged to use her native language in school (Mount\n2010).\nLucy\u2019s parents, who moved to Texas from Mexico, struggled under the pressure to\nspeak English. Lucy might easily have gotten lost and left behind if she\u2019d felt the\nsame pressure in school. In 2008, researchers from Johns Hopkins University\nconducted a series of studies on the effects of bilingual education (Slavin et al.\n2008). They found that students taught in both their native tongue and English\nmake better progress than those taught only in English.\nTechnically, the United States has no official language. But many believe English\nto be the rightful language of the United States, and over thirty states have\npassed laws specifying English as the official tongue. Proponents of English-only\nlaws suggest that a national ruling will save money on translation, printing, and\nhuman resource costs, including funding for bilingual teachers. They argue that\nsetting English as the official language will encourage non-English speakers to\nlearn English faster and adapt to the culture of the United States more easily\n(Mount 2010).\nGroups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) oppose making English\nthe official language and claim that it violates the rights of non-English speakers.\nEnglish-only laws, they believe, deny the reality of our nation\u2019s diversity and\nunfairly target Latinos and Asians. They point to the fact that much of the debate\non this topic has risen since 1970, a time when the United States experienced new\nwaves of immigration from Asia and Mexico. Today, a lot of product information gets written in multiple languages. Enter a\nstore like Home Depot and you\u2019ll find signs in both English and Spanish. Buy a\nchildren\u2019s product, and the safety warnings could be presented in multiple\nlanguages. While marketers are financially motivated to reach the largest number\nof consumers possible, this trend also may help people acclimate to a culture of\nbilingualism.\nStudies show that most U.S. immigrants eventually abandon their native tongues\nand become fluent in English. Bilingual education helps with that transition.\nToday, Lucy Alvarez is an ambitious and high-achieving college student. Fluent in\nboth English and Spanish, Lucy is studying law enforcement\u2014a field that seeks\nbilingual employees. The same bilingualism that contributed to her success in\ngrade school will help her thrive professionally as a law officer serving her\ncommunity.\nNowadays, many signs\u2014on streets and in stores\u2014include both English and\nSpanish. What effect does this have on members of society? What effect does it\nhave on our culture?

After all, we can easily see that people vary from one\nsociety to the next. It\u2019s natural that a young woman from rural Kenya would have\na very different view of the world from an elderly man in Mumbai\u2014one of the\nmost populated cities in the world. Additionally, each culture has its own internal\nvariations. Sometimes the differences between cultures are not nearly as large as\nthe differences inside cultures.\nHigh Culture and Popular Culture\nDo you prefer listening to opera or hip hop music? Do you like watching horse\nracing or NASCAR? Do you read books of poetry or celebrity magazines? In each\npair, one type of entertainment is considered high-brow and the other low-brow.\nSociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of cultural\nexperiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society.\nPeople often associate high culture with intellectualism, political power, and\nprestige. In America, high culture also tends to be associated with wealth. Events\nconsidered high culture can be expensive and formal\u2014attending a ballet, seeing a\nplay, or listening to a live symphony performance.\nThe term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and\nattitudes that exist in mainstream society. Popular culture events might include a\nparade, a baseball game, or the season finale of a television show. Rock and pop\nmusic\u2014\u201cpop\u201d is short for \u201cpopular\u201d\u2014are part of popular culture. Popular culture\nis often expressed and spread via commercial media such as radio, television,\nmovies, the music industry, publishers, and corporate-run websites. Unlike high culture, popular culture is known and accessible to most people. You can share a\ndiscussion of favorite football teams with a new coworker or comment\non American Idolwhen making small talk in line at the grocery store. But if you tried\nto launch into a deep discussion on the classical Greek play Antigone, few members\nof U.S. society today would be familiar with it.\nAlthough high culture may be viewed as superior to popular culture, the labels of\nhigh culture and popular culture vary over time and place. Shakespearean plays,\nconsidered pop culture when they were written, are now part of our society\u2019s\nhigh culture. Five hundred years from now, will our descendants associate Breaking\nBad with the cultural elite?\nSubculture and Counterculture\nA subculture is just what it sounds like\u2014a smaller cultural group within a larger\nculture; people of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a\nspecific identity within a smaller group.\nThousands of subcultures exist within the United States. Ethnic and racial groups\nshare the language, food, and customs of their heritage. Other subcultures are\nunited by shared experiences. Biker culture revolves around a dedication to\nmotorcycles. Some subcultures are formed by members who possess traits or\npreferences that differ from the majority of a society\u2019s population. The body\nmodification community embraces aesthetic additions to the human body, such\nas tattoos, piercings, and certain forms of plastic surgery. In the United States,\nadolescents often form subcultures to develop a shared youth identity. Alcoholics\nAnonymous offers support to those suffering from alcoholism. But even as\nmembers of a subculture band together, they still identify with and participate in\nthe larger society.\nSociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures, which are a type of\nsubculture that rejects some of the larger culture\u2019s norms and values. In contrast\nto subcultures, which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society,\ncountercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of\nrules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities that operate\noutside of greater society.\nCults, a word derived from culture, are also considered counterculture group. The\ngroup \u201cYearning for Zion\u201d (YFZ) in Eldorado, Texas, existed outside the mainstream and the limelight, until its leader was accused of statutory rape and\nunderage marriage. The sect\u2019s formal norms clashed too severely to be tolerated\nby U.S. law, and in 2008, authorities raided the compound and removed more\nthan two hundred women and children from the property.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF AMERICAN HIPSTER SUBCULTURE\nSkinny jeans, chunky glasses, and T-shirts with vintage logos\u2014the American\nhipster is a recognizable figure in the modern United States. Based predominately\nin metropolitan areas, sometimes clustered around hotspots such as the\nWilliamsburg neighborhood in New York City, hipsters define themselves through\na rejection of the mainstream. As a subculture, hipsters spurn many of the values\nand beliefs of U.S. culture and prefer vintage clothing to fashion and a bohemian\nlifestyle to one of wealth and power. While hipster culture may seem to be the\nnew trend among young, middle-class youth, the history of the group stretches\nback to the early decades of the 1900s.\nWhere did the hipster culture begin? In the early 1940s, jazz music was on the rise\nin the United States. Musicians were known as \u201chepcats\u201d and had a smooth,\nrelaxed quality that went against upright, mainstream life. Those who were \u201chep\u201d\nor \u201chip\u201d lived by the code of jazz, while those who were \u201csquare\u201d lived according\nto society\u2019s rules. The idea of a \u201chipster\u201d was born.\nThe hipster movement spread, and young people, drawn to the music and\nfashion, took on attitudes and language derived from the culture of jazz. Unlike\nthe vernacular of the day, hipster slang was purposefully ambiguous. When\nhipsters said, \u201cIt\u2019s cool, man,\u201d they meant not that everything was good, but that\nit was the way it was. In the 1940s, U.S. hipsters were associated with the \u201ccool\u201d culture of jazz. (Photo\ncourtesy of William P. Gottlieb/Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin Fund Collection,\nMusic Division, Library of Congress)\nBy the 1950s, the jazz culture was winding down and many traits of hepcat\nculture were becoming mainstream. A new subculture was on the rise. The \u201cBeat\nGeneration,\u201d a title coined by writer Jack Kerouac, were anticonformist and\nantimaterialistic. They were writers who listened to jazz and embraced radical\npolitics. They bummed around, hitchhiked the country, and lived in squalor.\nThe lifestyle spread. College students, clutching copies of Kerouac\u2019s On the Road,\ndressed in berets, black turtlenecks, and black-rimmed glasses. Women wore\nblack leotards and grew their hair long. Herb Caen, a San Francisco journalist,\nused the suffix from Sputnik 1, the Russian satellite that orbited Earth in 1957, to\ndub the movement\u2019s followers \u201cBeatniks.\u201d\nAs the Beat Generation faded, a new, related movement began. It too focused on\nbreaking social boundaries, but it also advocated freedom of expression,\nphilosophy, and love. It took its name from the generations before; in fact, some theorists claim that Beats themselves coined the term to describe their children.\nOver time, the \u201clittle hipsters\u201d of the 1970s became known simply as \u201chippies.\u201d\nToday\u2019s generation of hipsters rose out of the hippie movement in the same way\nthat hippies rose from Beats and Beats from hepcats. Although contemporary\nhipsters may not seem to have much in common with 1940s hipsters, the\nemulation of nonconformity is still there. In 2010, sociologist Mark Greif set about\ninvestigating the hipster subculture of the United States and found that much of\nwhat tied the group members together was not based on fashion, musical taste,\nor even a specific point of contention with the mainstream. \u201cAll hipsters play at\nbeing the inventors or first adopters of novelties,\u201d Greif wrote. \u201cPride comes from\nknowing, and deciding, what\u2019s cool in advance of the rest of the world. Yet the\nhabits of hatred and accusation are endemic to hipsters because they feel the\nweakness of everyone\u2019s position\u2014including their own\u201d (Greif 2010). Much as the\nhepcats of the jazz era opposed common culture with carefully crafted\nappearances of coolness and relaxation, modern hipsters reject mainstream\nvalues with a purposeful apathy.\nYoung people are often drawn to oppose mainstream conventions, even if in the\nsame way that others do. Ironic, cool to the point of noncaring, and intellectual,\nhipsters continue to embody a subculture, while simultaneously impacting\nmainstream culture. Intellectual and trendy, today\u2019s hipsters define themselves through cultural irony.\n(Photo courtesy of Lorena Cupcake/Wikimedia Commons)\nCultural Change\nAs the hipster example illustrates, culture is always evolving. Moreover, new\nthings are added to material culture every day, and they affect nonmaterial\nculture as well. Cultures change when something new (say, railroads or\nsmartphones) opens up new ways of living and when new ideas enter a culture\n(say, as a result of travel or globalization).\nInnovation: Discovery and Invention\nAn innovation refers to an object or concept\u2019s initial appearance in society\u2014it\u2019s\ninnovative because it is markedly new. There are two ways to come across an\ninnovative object or idea: discover it or invent it. Discoveries make known previously unknown but existing aspects of reality. In 1610, when Galileo looked\nthrough his telescope and discovered Saturn, the planet was already there, but\nuntil then, no one had known about it. When Christopher Columbus encountered\nAmerica, the land was, of course, already well known to its inhabitants. However,\nColumbus\u2019s discovery was new knowledge for Europeans, and it opened the way\nto changes in European culture, as well as to the cultures of the discovered lands.\nFor example, new foods such as potatoes and tomatoes transformed the\nEuropean diet, and horses brought from Europe changed hunting practices of\nNative American tribes of the Great Plains.\nInventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or\nconcepts\u2014when things are put together in an entirely new manner. In the late\n1800s and early 1900s, electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace.\nCars, airplanes, vacuum cleaners, lamps, radios, telephones, and televisions were\nall new inventions. Inventions may shape a culture when people use them in place\nof older ways of carrying out activities and relating to others, or as a way to carry\nout new kinds of activities. Their adoption reflects (and may shape) cultural\nvalues, and their use may require new norms for new situations.\nConsider the introduction of modern communication technology, such as mobile\nphones and smartphones. As more and more people began carrying these\ndevices, phone conversations no longer were restricted to homes, offices, and\nphone booths. People on trains, in restaurants, and in other public places became\nannoyed by listening to one-sided conversations. Norms were needed for cell\nphone use. Some people pushed for the idea that those who are out in the world\nshould pay attention to their companions and surroundings. However, technology\nenabled a workaround: texting, which enables quiet communication and has\nsurpassed phoning as the chief way to meet today\u2019s highly valued ability to stay in\ntouch anywhere, everywhere.\nWhen the pace of innovation increases, it can lead to generation gaps.\nTechnological gadgets that catch on quickly with one generation are sometimes\ndismissed by a skeptical older generation. A culture\u2019s objects and ideas can cause\nnot just generational but cultural gaps. Material culture tends to diffuse more\nquickly than nonmaterial culture; technology can spread through society in a\nmatter of months, but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society\nto change. Sociologist William F. Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture\nand its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture (Ogburn 1957).\nCulture lag can also cause tangible problems. The infrastructure of the United\nStates, built a hundred years ago or more, is having trouble supporting today\u2019s\nmore heavily populated and fast-paced life. Yet there is a lag in conceptualizing\nsolutions to infrastructure problems. Rising fuel prices, increased air pollution,\nand traffic jams are all symptoms of culture lag. Although people are becoming\naware of the consequences of overusing resources, the means to support changes\ntakes time to achieve.\nSociologist Everett Rogers (1962) developed a model of the diffusion of\ninnovations. As consumers gradually adopt a new innovation, the item grows\ntoward a market share of 100 percent, or complete saturation within a society.\n(Graph courtesy of Tungsten/Wikimedia Commons)\nDiffusion and Globalization\nThe integration of world markets and technological advances of the last decades\nhave allowed for greater exchange between cultures through the processes of globalization and diffusion. Beginning in the 1980s, Western governments began\nto deregulate social services while granting greater liberties to private businesses.\nAs a result, world markets became dominated by multinational companies in the\n1980s, a new state of affairs at that time. We have since come to refer to this\nintegration of international trade and finance markets as globalization. Increased\ncommunications and air travel have further opened doors for international\nbusiness relations, facilitating the flow not only of goods but also of information\nand people as well (Scheuerman 2014 (revised)). Today, many U.S. companies set\nup offices in other nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper.\nWhen a person in the United States calls to get information about banking,\ninsurance, or computer services, the person taking that call may be working in\nanother country.\nAlongside the process of globalization is diffusion, or the spread of material and\nnonmaterial culture. While globalization refers to the integration of markets,\ndiffusion relates to a similar process in the integration of international cultures.\nMiddle-class Americans can fly overseas and return with a new appreciation of\nThai noodles or Italian gelato. Access to television and the Internet has brought\nthe lifestyles and values portrayed in U.S. sitcoms into homes around the globe.\nTwitter feeds from public demonstrations in one nation have encouraged political\nprotesters in other countries. When this kind of diffusion occurs, material objects\nand ideas from one culture are introduced into another. Officially patented in 1893 as the \u201cclasp locker\u201d (left), the zipper did not diffuse\nthrough society for many decades. Today, it is immediately recognizable around\nthe world.

Societies\nare also comprised of many subcultures\u2014smaller groups that share an identity.\nCountercultures reject mainstream values and create their own cultural rules and\nnorms. Through invention or discovery, cultures evolve via new ideas and new\nways of thinking. In many modern cultures, the cornerstone of innovation is\ntechnology, the rapid growth of which can lead to cultural lag. Technology is also\nresponsible for the spread of both material and nonmaterial culture that\ncontributes to globalization.\nGlossary\ncountercultures\ngroups that reject and oppose society\u2019s widely accepted cultural patterns culture lag\nthe gap of time between the introduction of material culture and\nnonmaterial culture\u2019s acceptance of it\ndiffusion\nthe spread of material and nonmaterial culture from one culture to another\ndiscoveries\nthings and ideas found from what already exists\nglobalization\nthe integration of international trade and finance markets\nhigh culture\nthe cultural patterns of a society\u2019s elite\ninnovations\nnew objects or ideas introduced to culture for the first time\ninventions\na combination of pieces of existing reality into new forms\npopular culture\nmainstream, widespread patterns among a society\u2019s population\nsubcultures\ngroups that share a specific identification, apart from a society\u2019s majority,\neven as the members exist within a larger society\nFurther Research\nThe Beats were a counterculture that birthed an entire movement of art, music,\nand literature\u2014much of which is still highly regarded and studied today.

But what do\nthey mean? How do sociologists perceive and interpret culture based on these\nmaterial and nonmaterial items? Let\u2019s finish our analysis of culture by reviewing\nthem in the context of three theoretical perspectives: functionalism, conflict\ntheory, and symbolic interactionism.\nFunctionalists view society as a system in which all parts work\u2014or function\u2014\ntogether to create society as a whole. In this way, societies need culture to exist.\nCultural norms function to support the fluid operation of society, and cultural\nvalues guide people in making choices. Just as members of a society work\ntogether to fulfill a society\u2019s needs, culture exists to meet its members\u2019 basic\nneeds. Functionalists also study culture in terms of values. Education is an important\nconcept in the United States because it is valued. The culture of education\u2014\nincluding material culture such as classrooms, textbooks, libraries, dormitories\u2014\nsupports the emphasis placed on the value of educating a society\u2019s members.\nThis statue of Superman stands in the center of Metropolis, Illinois. His pedestal\nreads \u201cTruth\u2014Justice\u2014The American Way.\u201d How would a functionalist interpret\nthis statue? What does it reveal about the values of American culture? (Photo\ncourtesy of David Wilson/flickr)\nConflict theorists view social structure as inherently unequal, based on power\ndifferentials related to issues like class, gender, race, and age. For a conflict\ntheorist, culture is seen as reinforcing issues of \"privilege\" for certain groups\nbased upon race, sex, class, and so on. Women strive for equality in a male-\ndominated society. Senior citizens struggle to protect their rights, their health\ncare, and their independence from a younger generation of lawmakers. Advocacy\ngroups such as the ACLU work to protect the rights of all races and ethnicities in\nthe United States. Inequalities exist within a culture\u2019s value system. Therefore, a society\u2019s cultural\nnorms benefit some people but hurt others. Some norms, formal and informal,\nare practiced at the expense of others. Women were not allowed to vote in the\nUnited States until 1920. Gay and lesbian couples have been denied the right to\nmarry in some states. Racism and bigotry are very much alive today. Although\ncultural diversity is supposedly valued in the United States, many people still\nfrown upon interracial marriages. Same-sex marriages are banned in most states,\nand polygamy\u2014common in some cultures\u2014is unthinkable to most Americans.\nAt the core of conflict theory is the effect of economic production and\nmaterialism: dependence on technology in rich nations versus a lack of\ntechnology and education in poor nations. Conflict theorists believe that a\nsociety\u2019s system of material production has an effect on the rest of culture.\nPeople who have less power also have less ability to adapt to cultural change. This\nview contrasts with the perspective of functionalism. In the U.S. culture of\ncapitalism, to illustrate, we continue to strive toward the promise of the American\ndream, which perpetuates the belief that the wealthy deserve their privileges.\nSymbolic interactionism is a sociological perspective that is most concerned with\nthe face-to-face interactions between members of society. Interactionists see\nculture as being created and maintained by the ways people interact and in how\nindividuals interpret each other\u2019s actions. Proponents of this theory conceptualize\nhuman interactions as a continuous process of deriving meaning from both\nobjects in the environment and the actions of others. This is where the term\nsymbolic comes into play. Every object and action has a symbolic meaning, and\nlanguage serves as a means for people to represent and communicate their\ninterpretations of these meanings to others. Those who believe in symbolic\ninteractionism perceive culture as highly dynamic and fluid, as it is dependent on\nhow meaning is interpreted and how individuals interact when conveying these\nmeanings.\nWe began this chapter by asking what culture is. Culture is comprised of all the\npractices, beliefs, and behaviors of a society. Because culture is learned, it\nincludes how people think and express themselves. While we may like to consider\nourselves individuals, we must acknowledge the impact of culture; we inherit\nthought language that shapes our perceptions and patterned behavior, including\nabout issues of family and friends, and faith and politics. To an extent, culture is a social comfort. After all, sharing a similar culture with\nothers is precisely what defines societies. Nations would not exist if people did\nnot coexist culturally. There could be no societies if people did not share heritage\nand language, and civilization would cease to function if people did not agree on\nsimilar values and systems of social control. Culture is preserved through\ntransmission from one generation to the next, but it also evolves through\nprocesses of innovation, discovery, and cultural diffusion. We may be restricted\nby the confines of our own culture, but as humans we have the ability to question\nvalues and make conscious decisions. No better evidence of this freedom exists\nthan the amount of cultural diversity within our own society and around the\nworld. The more we study another culture, the better we become at\nunderstanding our own.\nThis child\u2019s clothing may be culturally specific, but her facial expression is\nuniversal. (Photo courtesy of Beth Rankin/flickr)\nSummary\nThere are three major theoretical approaches toward the interpretation of\nculture. A functionalist perspective acknowledges that there are many parts of\nculture that work together as a system to fulfill society\u2019s needs. Functionalists view culture as a reflection of society\u2019s values. Conflict theorists see culture as\ninherently unequal, based upon factors like gender, class, race, and age. An\ninteractionist is primarily interested in culture as experienced in the daily\ninteractions between individuals and the symbols that comprise a culture. Various\ncultural and sociological occurrences can be explained by these theories;\nhowever, there is no one \u201cright\u201d view through which to understand culture.\n\u00a9 Feb 5, 2015 OpenStax.

It is an exciting field of study because it is so\nfamiliar and relevant to our day-to-day lives. Social psychologists study a wide\nrange of topics that can roughly be grouped into 5 categories: attraction,\nattitudes, peace & conflict, social influence, and social cognition.\nLearning Objectives\nDefine social psychology and understand how it is different from other areas\nof psychology.\nUnderstand \u201clevels of analysis\u201d and why this concept is important to science.\nList at least three major areas of study in social psychology. Define the \u201cneed to belong\u201d.\nIntroduction\nWe live in a world where, increasingly, people of all backgrounds have smart\nphones. In economically developing societies, cellular towers are often less\nexpensive to install than traditional landlines. In many households in\nindustrialized societies, each person has his or her own mobile phone instead of\nusing a shared home phone. As this technology becomes increasingly common,\ncurious researchers have wondered what effect phones might have on\nrelationships. Do you believe that smart phones help foster closer relationships?\nOr do you believe that smart phones can hinder connections? In a series of\nstudies, researchers have discovered that the mere presence of a mobile phone\nlying on a table can interfere with relationships. In studies of conversations\nbetween both strangers and close friends\u2014conversations occurring in research\nlaboratories and in coffee shops\u2014mobile phones appeared to distract people\nfrom connecting with one another. The participants in these studies reported\nlower conversation quality, lower trust, and lower levels of empathy for the other\nperson (Przybylski & Weinstein, 2013). This is not to discount the usefulness of\nmobile phones, of course. It is merely a reminder that they are better used in\nsome situations than they are in others. It is also a real-world example of how\nsocial psychology can help produce insights about the ways we understand and\ninteract with one another. Social psychology is interested in how other people affect our thoughts, feelings,\nand behaviors. Researchers study group interactions, the way culture shapes our\nthinking, and even how technology impacts human relationships. [Image:\nMatthew G, https://goo.gl/En2JSi, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nSocial psychology is the branch of psychological science mainly concerned with\nunderstanding how the presence of others affects our thoughts, feelings, and\nbehaviors. Just as clinical psychology focuses on mental disorders and their\ntreatment, and developmental psychology investigates the way people change\nacross their lifespan, social psychology has its own focus. As the name suggests,\nthis science is all about investigating the ways groups function, the costs and\nbenefits of social status, the influences of culture, and all the other psychological\nprocesses involving two or more people.\nSocial psychology is such an exciting science precisely because it tackles issues\nthat are so familiar and so relevant to our everyday life. Humans are \u201csocial\nanimals.\u201d Like bees and deer, we live together in groups. Unlike those animals, however, people are unique, in that we care a great deal about our relationships.\nIn fact, a classic study of life stress found that the most stressful events in a\nperson\u2019s life\u2014the death of a spouse, divorce, and going to jail\u2014are so painful\nbecause they entail the loss of relationships (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). We spend a\nhuge amount of time thinking about and interacting with other people, and\nresearchers are interested in understanding these thoughts and actions. Giving up\na seat on the bus for another person is an example of social psychology. So is\ndisliking a person because he is wearing a shirt with the logo of a rival sports\nteam. Flirting, conforming, arguing, trusting, competing\u2014these are all examples\nof topics that interest social psychology researchers.\nAt times, science can seem abstract and far removed from the concerns of daily\nlife. When neuroscientists discuss the workings of the anterior cingulate cortex,\nfor example, it might sound important. But the specific parts of the brain and\ntheir functions do not always seem directly connected to the stuff you care about:\nparking tickets, holding hands, or getting a job. Social psychology feels so close to\nhome because it often deals with universal psychological processes to which\npeople can easily relate. For example, people have a powerful need to\nbelong(Baumeister & Leary, 1995). It doesn\u2019t matter if a person is from Israel,\nMexico, or the Philippines; we all have a strong need to make friends, start\nfamilies, and spend time together. We fulfill this need by doing things such as\njoining teams and clubs, wearing clothing that represents \u201cour group,\u201d and\nidentifying ourselves based on national or religious affiliation. It feels good to\nbelong to a group. Research supports this idea. In a study of the most and least\nhappy people, the differentiating factor was not gender, income, or religion; it\nwas having high-quality relationships (Diener & Seligman, 2002). Even introverts\nreport being happier when they are in social situations (Pavot, Diener & Fujita,\n1990). Further evidence can be found by looking at the negative psychological\nexperiences of people who do not feel they belong. People who feel lonely or\nisolated are more vulnerable to depression and problems with physical health\n(Cacioppo, & Patrick, 2008). The feelings we experience as members of groups \u2013 as teammates, fellow citizens,\nfollowers of a particular faith - play a huge role in our identities and in our\nhappiness. [Image: leonardo samrani, https://goo.gl/jHVWXR, CC BY 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nSocial Psychology is a Science\nThe need to belong is also a useful example of the ways the various aspects of\npsychology fit together. Psychology is a science that can be sub-divided into\nspecialties such as \u201cabnormal psychology\u201d (the study of mental illness) or\n\u201cdevelopmental psychology\u201d (the study of how people develop across the life\nspan). In daily life, however, we don\u2019t stop and examine our thoughts or\nbehaviors as being distinctly social versus developmental versus personality-\nbased versus clinical. In daily life, these all blend together. For example, the need\nto belong is rooted in developmental psychology. Developmental psychologists\nhave long paid attention to the importance of attaching to a caregiver, feeling\nsafe and supported during childhood, and the tendency to conform to peer\npressure during adolescence. Similarly, clinical psychologists\u2014those who research\nmental disorders-- have pointed to people feeling a lack of belonging to help\nexplain loneliness, depression, and other psychological pains. In practice, psychologists separate concepts into categories such as \u201cclinical,\u201d\n\u201cdevelopmental,\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d only out of scientific necessity. It is easier to\nsimplify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in order to study them. Each\npsychological sub-discipline has its own unique approaches to research. You may\nhave noticed that this is almost always how psychology is taught, as well. You take\na course in personality, another in human sexuality, and a third in gender studies,\nas if these topics are unrelated. In day-to-day life, however, these distinctions do\nnot actually exist, and there is heavy overlap between the various areas of\npsychology.\nFigure 1 \u2013 The levels of analysis in psychology.\nIn psychology, there are varying levels of analysis. Figure 1 summarizes the\ndifferent levels at which scientists might understand a single event. Take the\nexample of a toddler watching her mother make a phone call: the toddler is\ncurious, and is using observational learning to teach herself about this machine\ncalled a telephone. At the most specific levels of analysis, we might understand that various neurochemical processes are occurring in the toddler\u2019s brain. We\nmight be able to use imaging techniques to see that the cerebellum, among other\nparts of the brain, is activated with electrical energy. If we could \u201cpull back\u201d our\nscientific lens, we might also be able to gain insight into the toddler\u2019s own\nexperience of the phone call. She might be confused, interested, or jealous.\nMoving up to the next level of analysis, we might notice a change in the toddler\u2019s\nbehavior: during the call she furrows her brow, squints her eyes, and stares at her\nmother and the phone. She might even reach out and grab at the phone. At still\nanother level of analysis, we could see the ways that her relationships enter into\nthe equation. We might observe, for instance, that the toddler frowns and grabs\nat the phone when her mother uses it, but plays happily and ignores it when her\nstepbrother makes a call. All of these chemical, emotional, behavioral, and social\nprocesses occur simultaneously. None of them is the objective truth. Instead,\neach offers clues into better understanding what, psychologically speaking, is\nhappening.\nSocial psychologists attend to all levels of analysis but\u2014historically\u2014this branch\nof psychology has emphasized the higher levels of analysis. Researchers in this\nfield are drawn to questions related to relationships, groups, and culture. This\nmeans that they frame their research hypotheses in these terms. Imagine for a\nmoment that you are a social researcher. In your daily life, you notice that older\nmen on average seem to talk about their feelings less than do younger men. You\nmight want to explore your hypothesis by recording natural conversations\nbetween males of different ages. This would allow you to see if there was\nevidence supporting your original observation. It would also allow you to begin to\nsift through all the factors that might influence this phenomenon: What happens\nwhen an older man talks to a younger man? What happens when an older man\ntalks to a stranger versus his best friend? What happens when two highly\neducated men interact versus two working class men? Exploring each of these\nquestions focuses on interactions, behavior, and culture rather than on\nperceptions, hormones, or DNA. Social psychologists have developed unique methods for studying attitudes and\nbehaviors that help answer questions that may not be possible to answer in a\nlaboratory. Naturalistic observation of real world interactions, for example, would\nbe a method well suited for understanding more about men and how they share\ntheir feelings. [Image: Michael Coghlan, https://goo.gl/dGc3JV, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/rxiUsF]\nIn part, this focus on complex relationships and interactions is one of the things\nthat makes research in social psychology so difficult. High quality research often\ninvolves the ability to control the environment, as in the case of laboratory\nexperiments. The research laboratory, however, is artificial, and what happens\nthere may not translate to the more natural circumstances of life. This is why social psychologists have developed their own set of unique methods for studying\nattitudes and social behavior. For example, they use naturalistic observation to\nsee how people behave when they don\u2019t know they are being watched. Whereas\npeople in the laboratory might report that they personally hold no racist views or\nopinions (biases most people wouldn\u2019t readily admit to), if you were to observe\nhow close they sat next to people of other ethnicities while riding the bus, you\nmight discover a behavioral clue to their actual attitudes and preferences.\nWhat is Included in Social Psychology?\nSocial psychology is the study of group processes: how we behave in groups, and\nhow we feel and think about one another. While it is difficult to summarize the\nmany areas of social psychology research, it can be helpful to lump them into\nmajor categories as a starting point to wrap our minds around. There is, in reality,\nno specific number of definitive categories, but for the purpose of illustration,\nlet\u2019s use five. Most social psychology research topics fall into one (but sometimes\nmore) of each of these areas:\nAttraction\nA large amount of study in social psychology has focused on the process\nof attraction. Think about a young adult going off to college for the first time. He\ntakes an art history course and sits next to a young woman he finds attractive.\nThis feeling raises several interesting questions: Where does the attraction come\nfrom? Is it biological or learned? Why do his standards for beauty differ\nsomewhat from those of his best friend? The study of attraction covers a huge\nrange of topics. It can begin with first impressions, then extend to courtship and\ncommitment. It involves the concepts of beauty, sex, and evolution. Attraction\nresearchers might study stalking behavior. They might research divorce or\nremarriage. They might study changing standards of beauty across decades. When a study of attractiveness was conducted with Maasai tribal people the\nresearchers found that when participants rated the attractiveness of their friends\nthey used different criteria than when they rated the attractiveness of strangers \u2013\na pattern that was also discovered in a sample of people from the United States.\n[Image: DFID, https://goo.gl/5FfSjt, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nIn a series of studies focusing on the topic of attraction, researchers were curious\nhow people make judgments of the extent to which the faces of their friends and\nof strangers are good looking (Wirtz, Biswas-Diener, Diener & Drogos, 2011). To\ndo this, the researchers showed a set of photographs of faces of young men and\nwomen to several assistants who were blind to the research hypothesis. Some of\nthe people in the photos were Caucasian, some were African-American, and some\nwere Maasai, a tribe of traditional people from Kenya. The assistants were asked\nto rate the various facial features in the photos, including skin smoothness, eye\nsize, prominence of cheekbones, symmetry (how similar the left and the right\nhalves of the face are), and other characteristics. The photos were then shown to\nthe research participants\u2014of the same three ethnicities as the people in the\nphotos\u2014who were asked to rate the faces for overall attractiveness. Interestingly,\nwhen rating the faces of strangers, white people, Maasai, and African-Americans\nwere in general agreement about which faces were better looking. Not only that, but there was high consistency in which specific facial features were associated\nwith being good looking. For instance, across ethnicities and cultures, everyone\nseemed to find smooth skin more attractive than blemished skin. Everyone\nseemed to also agree that larger chins made men more attractive, but not\nwomen.\nThen came an interesting discovery. The researchers found that Maasai tribal\npeople agreed about the faces of strangers\u2014but not about the faces of people\nthey knew! Two people might look at the same photo of someone they knew; one\nwould give a thumbs up for attractiveness, the other one, not so much. It\nappeared that friends were using some other standard of beauty than simply\nnose, eyes, skin, and other facial features. To explore this further, the researchers\nconducted a second study in the United States. They brought university students\ninto their laboratory in pairs. Each pair were friends; some were same-sex friends\nand some were opposite-sex friends. They had their photographs taken and were\nthen asked to privately rate each other\u2019s attractiveness, along with photos of\nother participants whom they did not know (strangers). Friends were also asked\nto rate each other on personality traits, including \u201cadmirable,\u201d \u201cgenerous,\u201d\n\u201clikable,\u201d \u201coutgoing,\u201d \u201csensitive,\u201d and \u201cwarm.\u201d\nIn doing this, the researchers discovered two things. First, they found the exact\nsame pattern as in the earlier study: when the university students rated strangers,\nthey focused on actual facial features, such as skin smoothness and large eyes, to\nmake their judgments (whether or not they realized it). But when it came to the\nhotness-factor of their friends, these features appeared not to be very important.\nSuddenly, likable personality characteristics were a better predictor of who was\nconsidered good looking. This makes sense. Attractiveness is, in part, an\nevolutionary and biological process. Certain features such as smooth skin are\nsignals of health and reproductive fitness\u2014something especially important when\nscoping out strangers. Once we know a person, however, it is possible to swap\nthose biological criteria for psychological ones. People tend to be attracted not\njust to muscles and symmetrical faces but also to kindness and generosity. As\nmore information about a person\u2019s personality becomes available, it becomes the\nmost important aspect of a person\u2019s attractiveness.\nUnderstanding how attraction works is more than an intellectual exercise; it can\nalso lead to better interventions. Insights from studies on attraction can find their way into public policy conversations, couples therapy, and sex education\nprograms.\nAttitudes\nSocial psychologists are interested in finding ways to apply their research to\nimprove the lives of individuals and benefit communities and society as a whole.\nFor example researchers are looking at ways to change the general public\u2019s attitudes about stigmatized groups such as the homeless. [Image: Sascha\nKohlmann, http://goo.gl/L436hN, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/rxiUsF]\nSocial psychology shares with its intellectual cousins sociology and political\nscience an interest in attitudes. Attitudes are opinions, feelings, and beliefs about\na person, concept, or group. People hold attitudes about all types of things: the\nfilms they see, political issues, and what constitutes a good date. Social\npsychology researchers are interested in what attitudes people hold, where these\nattitudes come from, and how they change over time. Researchers are especially\ninterested in social attitudes people hold about categories of people, such as the\nelderly, military veterans, or people with mental disabilities.\nAmong the most studied topics in attitude research are stereotyping and\nprejudice. Although people often use these words interchangeably, they are\nactually different concepts. Stereotyping is a way of using information shortcuts\nabout a group to effectively navigate social situations or make decisions. For\ninstance, you might hold a stereotype that elderly people are physically slower\nand frailer than twenty-year-olds. If so, you are more likely to treat interactions\nwith the elderly in a different manner than interactions with younger people.\nAlthough you might delight in jumping on your friend\u2019s back, punching a buddy in\nthe arm, or jumping out and scaring a friend you probably do not engage in these\nbehaviors with the elderly. Stereotypical information may or may not be correct.\nAlso, stereotypical information may be positive or negative. Regardless of\naccuracy, all people use stereotypes, because they are efficient and inescapable\nways to deal with huge amounts of social information. It is important to keep in\nmind, however, that stereotypes, even if they are correct in general, likely do not\napply to every member of the group. As a result, it can seem unfair to judge an\nindividual based on perceived group norms.\nPrejudice, on the other hand, refers to how a person feels about an individual\nbased on their group membership. For example, someone with a prejudice\nagainst tattoos may feel uncomfortable sitting on the metro next to a young man\nwith multiple, visible tattoos. In this case, the person is pre-judging the man with\ntattoos based on group members (people with tattoos) rather than getting to\nknow the man as an individual. Like stereotypes, prejudice can be positive or\nnegative. Discrimination occurs when a person is biased against an individual, simply\nbecause of the individual\u2019s membership in a social category. For instance, if you\nwere to learn that a person has gone to rehabilitation for alcohol treatment, it\nmight be unfair to treat him or her as untrustworthy. You might hold a stereotype\nthat people who have been involved with drugs are untrustworthy or that they\nhave an arrest record. Discrimination would come when you act on that\nstereotype by, for example, refusing to hire the person for a job for which they\nare otherwise qualified. Understanding the psychological mechanisms of\nproblems like prejudice can be the first step in solving them.\nSocial psychology focuses on basic processes, but also on applications. That is,\nresearchers are interested in ways to make the world a better place, so they look\nfor ways to put their discoveries into constructive practice. This can be clearly\nseen in studies on attitude change. In such experiments, researchers are\ninterested in how people can overcome negative attitudes and feel more\nempathy towards members of other groups. Take, for example, a study by Daniel\nBatson and his colleagues (1997) on attitudes about people from stigmatized\ngroups. In particular, the researchers were curious how college students in their\nstudy felt about homeless people. They had students listen to a recording of a\nfictitious homeless man\u2014Harold Mitchell\u2014describing his life. Half of the\nparticipants were told to be objective and fair in their consideration of his story.\nThe other half were instructed to try to see life through Harold\u2019s eyes and imagine\nhow he felt. After the recording finished, the participants rated their attitudes\ntoward homeless people in general. They addressed attitudes such as \u201cMost\nhomeless people could get a job if they wanted to,\u201d or \u201cMost homeless people\nchoose to live that way.\u201d It turns out that when people are instructed to have\nempathy\u2014to try to see the world through another person\u2019s eyes\u2014it gives them\nnot only more empathy for that individual, but also for the group as a whole. In\nthe Batson et al. experiment (1997), the high empathy participants reported a\nfavorable rating of homeless people than did those participants in the low\nempathy condition.\nStudies like these are important because they reveal practical possibilities for\ncreating a more positive society. In this case, the results tell us that it is possible\nfor people to change their attitudes and look more favorably on people they\nmight otherwise avoid or be prejudiced against. In fact, it appears that it takes\nrelatively little\u2014simply the effort to see another\u2019s point of view\u2014to nudge people toward being a bit kinder and more generous toward one another. In a world\nwhere religious and political divisions are highly publicized, this type of research\nmight be an important step toward working together.\nPeace & Conflict\nWhy do we fight? How do we fight? What factors contribute to successful\nreconciliation? Social psychologists study conflict, aggression, and violence and\ntheir research leads to many real-world applications in areas such as international\nrelations and clinical therapy. [Image: David Shankbone, http://goo.gl/r6DWkc, CC\nBY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nSocial psychologists are also interested in peace and conflict. They research\nconflicts ranging from the small\u2014such as a spat between lovers\u2014to the large\u2014\nsuch as wars between nations. Researchers are interested in why people fight,\nhow they fight, and what the possible costs and benefits of fighting are. In\nparticular, social psychologists are interested in the mental processes associated with conflict and reconciliation. They want to understand how emotions,\nthoughts, and sense of identity play into conflicts, as well as making up\nafterward.\nTake, for instance, a 1996 study by Dov Cohen and his colleagues. They were\ninterested in people who come from a \u201cculture of honor\u201d\u2014that is, a cultural\nbackground that emphasizes personal or family reputation and social status.\nCohen and his colleagues realized that cultural forces influence why people take\noffense and how they behave when others offend them. To investigate how\npeople from a culture of honor react to aggression, the Cohen research team\ninvited dozens of university students into the laboratory, half of whom were from\na culture of honor. In their experiment, they had a research\nconfederate \u201caccidentally\u201d bump the research participant as they passed one\nanother in the hallway, then say \u201casshole\u201d quietly. They discovered that people\nfrom the Northern United States were likely to laugh off the incident with\namusement (only 35% became angry), while 85% of folks from the Southern\nUnited States\u2014a culture of honor region\u2014became angry.\nIn a follow-up study, the researchers were curious as to whether this anger would\nboil over and lead people from cultures of honor to react more violently than\nothers (Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, & Schwarz, 1996). In a cafeteria setting, the\nresearchers \u201caccidentally\u201d knocked over drinks of people from cultures of honor\nas well as drinks of people not from honor cultures. As expected, the people from\nhonor cultures became angrier; however, they did not act out more aggressively.\nInterestingly, in follow-up interviews, the people from cultures of honor said they\nwould expect their peers\u2014other people from their culture of honor\u2014to act\nviolently even though they, themselves, had not. This follow-up study provides\ninsights into the links between emotions and social behavior. It also sheds light on\nthe ways that people perceive certain groups.\nThis line of research is just a single example of how social psychologists study the\nforces that give rise to aggression and violence. Just as in the case of attitudes, a\nbetter understanding of these forces might help researchers, therapists, and\npolicy makers intervene more effectively in conflicts.\nSocial Influence Take a moment and think about television commercials. How influenced do you\nthink you are by the ads you see? A very common perception voiced among\npsychology students is \u201cOther people are influenced by ads, but not me!\u201d To\nsome degree, it is an unsettling thought that outside influences might sway us to\nspend money on, make decisions about, or even feel what they want us to.\nNevertheless, none of us can escape social influence. Perhaps, more than any\nother topic, social influence is the heart and soul of social psychology. Our most\nfamous studies deal with the ways that other people affect our behavior; they are\nstudies on conformity\u2014being persuaded to give up our own opinions and go\nalong with the group\u2014and obedience\u2014following orders or requests from people\nin authority.\nMany of our most common everyday-activities \u2013 eating in a restaurant for\nexample \u2013 involve instances of social influence. We may not even be aware that\nour behaviors are being guided by outside forces of persuasion, but none of us is immune to social influence. [Image: Alan Light, http://goo.gl/ZdxASW, CC BY 2.0,\nhttp://goo.gl/T4qgSp]\nAmong the most researched topics is persuasion. Persuasion is the act of\ndelivering a particular message so that it influences a person\u2019s behavior in a\ndesired way. Your friends try to persuade you to join their group for lunch. Your\nparents try to persuade you to go to college and to take your studies seriously.\nDoctors try to persuade you to eat a healthy diet or exercise more often. And, yes,\nadvertisers try to persuade you also. They showcase their products in a way that\nmakes them seem useful, affordable, reliable, or cool.\nOne example of persuasion can be seen in a very common situation: tipping the\nserving staff at a restaurant. In some societies, especially in the United States,\ntipping is an important part of dining. As you probably know, servers hope to get\na large tip in exchange for good service. One group of researchers was curious\nwhat servers do to coax diners into giving bigger tips. Occasionally, for instance,\nservers write a personal message of thanks on the bill. In a series of studies, the\nresearchers were interested in how gift-giving would affect tipping. First, they had\ntwo male waiters in New York deliver a piece of foil-wrapped chocolate along\nwith the bill at the end of the meal. Half of 66 diners received the chocolate and\nthe other half did not. When patrons were given the unexpected sweet, they\ntipped, on average, 2% more (Strohmetz, Rind, Fisher & Lynn 2002).\nIn a follow-up study, the researchers changed the conditions. In this case, two\nfemale servers brought a small basket of assorted chocolates to the table\n(Strohmetz et al., 2002). In one research condition, they told diners they could\npick two sweets; in a separate research condition, however, they told diners they\ncould pick one sweet, but then\u2014as the diners were getting ready to leave\u2014the\nwaiters returned and offered them a second sweet. In both situations, the diners\nreceived the same number of sweets, but in the second condition the waiters\nappeared to be more generous, as if they were making a personal decision to give\nan additional little gift. In both of these conditions the average amount of tips\nwent up, but tips increased a whopping 21% in the \u201cvery generous\u201d condition.\nThe researchers concluded that giving a small gift puts people in the frame of\nmind to give a little something back, a principle called reciprocity. Research on persuasion is very useful. Although it is tempting to dismiss it as a\nmere attempt by advertisers to get you to purchase goods and services,\npersuasion is used for many purposes. For example, medical professionals often\nhope people will donate their organs after they die. Donated organs can be used\nto train medical students, advance scientific discovery, or save other people\u2019s\nlives through transplantation. For years, doctors and researchers tried to\npersuade people to donate, but relatively few people did. Then, policy makers\noffered an organ donation option for people getting their driver\u2019s license, and\ndonations rose. When people received their license, they could tick a box that\nsigned them up for the organ donation program. By coupling the decision to\ndonate organs with a more common event\u2014getting a license\u2014policy makers\nwere able to increase the number of donors. Then, they had the further idea of\n\u201cnudging\u201d people to donate\u2014by making them \u201copt out\u201d rather than \u201copt in.\u201d\nNow, people are automatically signed up to donate organs unless they make the\neffort to check a box indicating they don\u2019t want to. By making organ donation the\ndefault, more people have donated and more lives have been saved. This is a\nsmall but powerful example of how we can be persuaded to behave certain ways,\noften without even realizing what is influencing us.\nSocial Cognition\nYou, me, all of us\u2014we spend much of our time thinking about other people. We\nmake guesses as to their honesty, their motives, and their opinions. Social\ncognition is the term for the way we think about the social world and how we\nperceive others. In some sense, we are continually telling a story in our own\nminds about the people around us. We struggle to understand why a date failed\nto show up, whether we can trust the notes of a fellow student, or if our friends\nare laughing at our jokes because we are funny or if they are just being nice.\nWhen we make educated guesses about the efforts or motives of others, this is\ncalled social attribution. We are \u201cattributing\u201d their behavior to a particular cause.\nFor example, we might attribute the failure of a date to arrive on time to car\ntrouble, forgetfulness, or the wrong-headed possibility that we are not worthy of\nbeing loved. \u201dAm I the only one who knows how to drive? The roads are full of maniacs and\nidiots today!\u201d If you\u2019ve ever had these feelings while behind the wheel you likely\nhave experienced what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error.\n[Image: seppschanz, http://goo.gl/eVkDIs, CC BY-NC 2.0, http://goo.gl/iF4hmM]\nBecause the information we have regarding other people\u2019s motives and behavior\nis not as complete as our insights into our own, we are likely to make unreliable\njudgments of them. Imagine, for example, that a person on the freeway speeds\nup behind you, follows dangerously close, then swerves around and passes you\nillegally. As the driver speeds off into the distance you might think to yourself,\n\u201cWhat a jerk!\u201d You are beginning to tell yourself a story about why that person\nbehaved that way. Because you don\u2019t have any information about his or her\nsituation\u2014rushing to the hospital, or escaping a bank robbery?\u2014you default to\njudgments of character: clearly, that driver is impatient, aggressive, and\ndownright rude. If you were to do the exact same thing, however\u2014cut someone\noff on the freeway\u2014you would be less likely to attribute the same behavior to\npoor character, and more likely to chalk it up to the situation. (Perhaps you were\nmomentarily distracted by the radio.) The consistent way we attribute people\u2019s actions to personality traits while overlooking situational influences is called\nthe fundamental attribution error.\nThe fundamental attribution error can also emerge in other ways. It can include\ngroups we belong to versus opposing groups. Imagine, for example, that you are a\nfan of rugby. Your favorite team is the All Blacks, from New Zealand. In one\nparticular match, you notice how unsporting the opposing team is. They appear to\npout and seem to commit an unusually high number of fouls. Their fouling\nbehavior is clearly linked to their character; they are mean people! Yet, when a\nplayer from the All Blacks is called for a foul, you may be inclined to see that as a\nbad call by the referee or a product of the fact that your team is pressured from a\ntough schedule and a number of injuries to their star players. This mental process\nallows a person to maintain his or her own high self-esteem while dismissing the\nbad behavior of others.\nConclusion\nPeople are more connected to one another today than at any time in history. For\nthe first time, it is easy to have thousands of acquaintances on social media. It is\neasier than ever before to travel and meet people from different cultures.\nBusinesses, schools, religious groups, political parties, and governments interact\nmore than they ever have. For the first time, people in greater numbers live\nclustered in cities than live spread out across rural settings. These changes have\npsychological consequences. Over the last hundred years, we have seen dramatic\nshifts in political engagement, ethnic relations, and even the very definition of\nfamily itself.\nSocial psychologists are scientists who are interested in understanding the ways\nwe relate to one another, and the impact these relationships have on us,\nindividually and collectively. Not only can social psychology research lead to a\nbetter understanding of personal relationships, but it can lead to practical\nsolutions for many social ills. Lawmakers, teachers and parents, therapists, and\npolicy makers can all use this science to help develop societies with less conflict\nand more social support.\nOutside Resources Web: A collection of links on the topic of peace psychology\nhttps://www.socialpsychology.org/peace.htm\nWeb: A great resource for all things social psychology, all in one place - Social\nPsychology Network\nhttp://www.socialpsychology.org/\nWeb: A list of profiles of major historical figures in social psychology\nhttps://www.socialpsychology.org/social-figures.htm\nWeb: A review of the history of social psychology as well as the topics of interest\nin the field\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology\nWeb: A succinct review of major historical figures in social psychology\nhttp://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html\nWeb: An article on the definition and areas of influence of peace psychology\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_psychology\nWeb: Article describing another way of conceptualizing levels of analysis in social\npsychology\nhttp://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/cecn/node11.html\nWeb: Extended list of major historical figures in social psychology\nhttp://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/majorfigures/character\ns.html\nWeb: History and principles of social psychology\nhttps://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/defining-social-\npsychology-history-and-principles/\nWeb: Links to sources on history of social psychology as well as major historical\nfigures https://www.socialpsychology.org/history.htm\nWeb: The Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict and Violence\nhttp://www.peacepsych.org/\nVocabulary\nAttitude\nA way of thinking or feeling about a target that is often reflected in a\nperson\u2019s behavior.

DOI:nobaproject.com Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 2- Developmental Stages and Theories\n2.1 Stages of Development\nFrom the moment we are born until the moment we die, we continue to develop.\nDevelopmental psychologists often divide our development into three areas:\nphysical development, cognitive development, and psychosocial development.\nMirroring Erikson\u2019s stages, lifespan development is divided into different stages\nthat are based on age. We will discuss prenatal, infant, child, adolescent, and\nadult development.\nPRENATAL DEVELOPMENT\nHow did you come to be who you are? From beginning as a one-cell structure to\nyour birth, your prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate\nsequence.\nThere are three stages of prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal.\nLet\u2019s take a look at what happens to the developing baby in each of these stages.\nGerminal Stage (Weeks 1\u20132)\nIn the discussion of biopsychology earlier in the book, you learned about genetics\nand DNA. A mother and father\u2019s DNA is passed on to the child at the moment of\nconception. Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote\n(Figure). A zygote begins as a one-cell structure that is created when a sperm and\negg merge. The genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this point. During\nthe first week after conception, the zygote divides and multiplies, going from a\none-cell structure to two cells, then four cells, then eight cells, and so on. This\nprocess of cell division is called mitosis. Mitosis is a fragile process, and fewer\nthan one-half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004). After\n5 days of mitosis there are 100 cells, and after 9 months there are billions of cells.\nAs the cells divide, they become more specialized, forming different organs and\nbody parts. In the germinal stage, the mass of cells has yet to attach itself to the\nlining of the mother\u2019s uterus. Once it does, the next stage begins. Sperm and ovum fuse at the point of conception.\nEmbryonic Stage (Weeks 3\u20138)\nAfter the zygote divides for about 7\u201310 days and has 150 cells, it travels down the\nfallopian tubes and implants itself in the lining of the uterus. Upon implantation,\nthis multi-cellular organism is called an embryo. Now blood vessels grow, forming\nthe placenta. The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides\nnourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the\numbilical cord. Basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will\nbecome the head, chest, and abdomen. During the embryonic stage, the heart\nbegins to beat and organs form and begin to function. The neural tube forms\nalong the back of the embryo, developing into the spinal cord and brain.\nFetal Stage (Weeks 9\u201340)\nWhen the organism is about nine weeks old, the embryo is called a fetus. At this\nstage, the fetus is about the size of a kidney bean and begins to take on the\nrecognizable form of a human being as the \u201ctail\u201d begins to disappear.\nFrom 9\u201312 weeks, the sex organs begin to differentiate. At about 16 weeks, the\nfetus is approximately 4.5 inches long. Fingers and toes are fully developed, and\nfingerprints are visible. By the time the fetus reaches the sixth month of\ndevelopment (24 weeks), it weighs up to 1.4 pounds. Hearing has developed, so the fetus can respond to sounds. The internal organs, such as the lungs, heart,\nstomach, and intestines, have formed enough that a fetus born prematurely at\nthis point has a chance to survive outside of the mother\u2019s womb. Throughout the\nfetal stage the brain continues to grow and develop, nearly doubling in size from\nweeks 16 to 28. Around 36 weeks, the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs\nabout 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long, and by week 37 all of the fetus\u2019s\norgan systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the mother\u2019s\nuterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus\ncontinues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks. By\nthen, the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent.\nThe progression through the stages is shown in Figure. During the fetal stage, the baby's brain develops and the body adds size and\nweight, until the fetus reaches full-term development.\nFor an amazing look at prenatal development and the process of birth, view the\nvideo Life\u2019s Greatest Miracle from Nova and PBS.\nPrenatal Influences\nDuring each prenatal stage, genetic and environmental factors can affect\ndevelopment. The developing fetus is completely dependent on the mother for\nlife. It is important that the mother takes good care of herself and\nreceives prenatal care, which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the\nhealth of both the mother and the fetus (Figure). According to the National\nInstitutes of Health ([NIH], 2013), routine prenatal care is important because it\ncan reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy. In\nfact, women who are trying to become pregnant or who may become pregnant\nshould discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. They may be advised, for\nexample, to take a vitamin containing folic acid, which helps prevent certain birth\ndefects, or to monitor aspects of their diet or exercise routines. A pregnant woman receives an ultrasound as part of her prenatal care. (credit:\nUnited States Agency for International Development)\nRecall that when the zygote attaches to the wall of the mother\u2019s uterus, the\nplacenta is formed. The placenta provides nourishment and oxygen to the fetus.\nMost everything the mother ingests, including food, liquid, and even medication,\ntravels through the placenta to the fetus, hence the common phrase \u201ceating for\ntwo.\u201d Anything the mother is exposed to in the environment affects the fetus; if\nthe mother is exposed to something harmful, the child can show life-long effects.\nA teratogen is any environmental agent\u2014biological, chemical, or physical\u2014that\ncauses damage to the developing embryo or fetus. There are different types of\nteratogens. Alcohol and most drugs cross the placenta and affect the fetus.\nAlcohol is not safe to drink in any amount during pregnancy. Alcohol use during\npregnancy has been found to be the leading preventable cause of mental\nretardation in children in the United States (Maier & West, 2001). Excessive\nmaternal drinking while pregnant can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders with\nlife-long consequences for the child ranging in severity from minor to major\n(Table). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a collection of birth defects\nassociated with heavy consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Physically, children with FASD may have a small head size and abnormal facial features.\nCognitively, these children may have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higher\nrates of ADHD, learning issues, and lower IQ scores.\nThese developmental problems and delays persist into adulthood (Streissguth et\nal., 2004). Based on studies conducted on animals, it also has been suggested that\na mother\u2019s alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose her child to\nlike alcohol (Youngentob et al., 2007).\nFetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial Features\nFacial Feature Potential Effect of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\nHead size Below-average head circumference\nEyes Smaller than average eye opening, skin folds at corners of\neyes\nNose Low nasal bridge, short nose\nMidface Smaller than average midface size\nLip and Thin upper lip, indistinct philtrum\nphiltrum\nSmoking is also considered a teratogen because nicotine travels through the\nplacenta to the fetus. When the mother smokes, the developing baby experiences\na reduction in blood oxygen levels. According to the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (2013), smoking while pregnant can result in premature birth,\nlow-birth-weight infants, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\nHeroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, almost all prescription medicines, and most\nover-the counter medications are also considered teratogens. Babies born with a\nheroin addiction need heroin just like an adult addict. The child will need to be\ngradually weaned from the heroin under medical supervision; otherwise, the child\ncould have seizures and die. Other teratogens include radiation, viruses such as\nHIV and herpes, and rubella (German measles). Women in the United States are much less likely to be afflicted with rubella because most women received\nchildhood immunizations or vaccinations that protect the body from disease.\nEach organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy, called\nthe critical or sensitive period (Figure). For example, research with primate\nmodels of FASD has demonstrated that the time during which a developing fetus\nis exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facial\ncharacteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Specifically, this research\nsuggests that alcohol exposure that is limited to day 19 or 20 of gestation can lead\nto significant facial abnormalities in the offspring (Ashley, Magnuson, Omnell, &\nClarren, 1999). Given regions of the brain also show sensitive periods during\nwhich they are most susceptible to the teratogenic effects of alcohol (Tran &\nKelly, 2003).\nSHOULD WOMEN WHO USE DRUGS DURING PREGNANCY BE ARRESTED AND\nJAILED?\nAs you now know, women who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause\nserious lifelong harm to their child. Some people have advocated mandatory\nscreenings for women who are pregnant and have a history of drug abuse, and if\nthe women continue using, to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate them (Figdor &\nKaeser, 1998). This policy was tried in Charleston, South Carolina, as recently as\n20 years ago. The policy was called the Interagency Policy on Management of\nSubstance Abuse During Pregnancy, and had disastrous results.\nThe Interagency Policy applied to patients attending the obstetrics clinic at MUSC,\nwhich primarily serves patients who are indigent or on Medicaid. It did not apply\nto private obstetrical patients. The policy required patient education about the\nharmful effects of substance abuse during pregnancy. . . . [A] statement also\nwarned patients that protection of unborn and newborn children from the harms\nof illegal drug abuse could involve the Charleston police, the Solicitor of the Ninth\nJudicial Court, and the Protective Services Division of the Department of Social\nServices (DSS). (Jos, Marshall, & Perlmutter, 1995, pp. 120\u2013121)\nThis policy seemed to deter women from seeking prenatal care, deterred them\nfrom seeking other social services, and was applied solely to low-income women,\nresulting in lawsuits. The program was canceled after 5 years, during which 42\nwomen were arrested. A federal agency later determined that the program involved human experimentation without the approval and oversight of an\ninstitutional review board (IRB). What were the flaws in the program and how\nwould you correct them? What are the ethical implications of charging pregnant\nwomen with child abuse?\nINFANCY THROUGH CHILDHOOD\nThe average newborn weighs approximately 7.5 pounds. Although small, a\nnewborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities\nhelp him interact with the environment from the moment of birth. All healthy\nbabies are born with newborn reflexes: inborn automatic responses to particular\nforms of stimulation. Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more\ncomplex behaviors\u2014these reflexes are crucial to survival. They are present in\nbabies whose brains are developing normally and usually disappear around 4\u20135\nmonths old. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these newborn reflexes. The rooting\nreflex is the newborn\u2019s response to anything that touches her cheek: When you\nstroke a baby\u2019s cheek, she naturally turns her head in that direction and begins to\nsuck. The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, sucking motions that infants\ndo with their mouths. Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be\nobserved. For instance, if you put your finger into a newborn\u2019s hand, you will\nwitness the grasping reflex, in which a baby automatically grasps anything that\ntouches his palms. The Moro reflex is the newborn\u2019s response when she feels like\nshe is falling. The baby spreads her arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually)\ncries. How do you think these reflexes promote survival in the first months of life?\nTake a few minutes to view this brief video clip illustrating several newborn\nreflexes.\nWhat can young infants see, hear, and smell? Newborn infants\u2019 sensory abilities\nare significant, but their senses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn\u2019s\ninnate preferences facilitate interaction with caregivers and other humans. Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a\npreference for faces. Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices,\nthey will listen to voices longer than sounds that do not involve speech\n(Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their mother\u2019s voice\nover a stranger\u2019s voice (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). In an interesting experiment, 3-\nweek-old babies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant\u2019s\nmother\u2019s voice and of a stranger\u2019s voice. When the infants heard their mother\u2019s\nvoice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish, 1974).\nNewborns also have a strong sense of smell. For instance, newborn babies can\ndistinguish the smell of their own mother from that of others. In a study by\nMacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were being breastfed were placed\nbetween two gauze pads. One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother\nwho was a stranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant\u2019s own\nmother. More than two-thirds of the week-old babies turned toward the gauze\npad with their mother\u2019s scent.\nPhysical Development\nIn infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body\u2019s physical development is\nrapid (Figure). On average, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a\nnewborn\u2019s weight typically doubles in six months and triples in one year. By 2\nyears old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year old\nshould weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is\n19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5 inches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old\n(WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).\nChildren experience rapid physical changes through infancy and early childhood.\n(credit \"left\": modification of work by Kerry Ceszyk; credit \"middle-left\": modification of work by Kristi Fausel; credit \"middle-right\": modification of work\nby \"devinf\"/Flickr; credit \"right\": modification of work by Rose Spielman)\nDuring infancy and childhood, growth does not occur at a steady rate (Carel,\nLahlou, Roger, & Chaussain, 2004). Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old:\nDuring this time children gain 5\u20137 pounds and grow about 2\u20133 inches per year.\nOnce girls reach 8\u20139 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of boys due to a\npubertal growth spurt. This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old,\ncoinciding with the start of the menstrual cycle. By 10 years old, the average girl\nweighs 88 pounds, and the average boy weighs 85 pounds.\nWe are born with all of the brain cells that we will ever have\u2014about 100\u2013200\nbillion neurons (nerve cells) whose function is to store and transmit information\n(Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997). However, the nervous system continues to\ngrow and develop. Each neural pathway forms thousands of new connections\nduring infancy and toddlerhood. This period of rapid neural growth is called\nblooming. Neural pathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming\nperiod of neural growth is then followed by a period of pruning, where neural\nconnections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to function\nmore efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011).\nBlooming occurs during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through\nchildhood and into adolescence in various areas of the brain.\nThe size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is\n55% of its adult size, and by 6 years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size\n(Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3\u20136), the frontal lobes grow rapidly.\nRecalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal\nlobes are associated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control.\nTherefore, by the time children reach school age, they\nare developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through\nthe elementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all\ngrow in size. The brain growth spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow\nPiaget\u2019s sequence of cognitive development, so that significant changes in neural\nfunctioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman,\nBachevalier, Turner, & Peuster, 1992).\nMotor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive\nreactions (e.g., sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit with assistance, and\nthen to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.\nMotor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine\nmotor skills focus on the muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable\ncoordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, and using\na spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms\nand legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).\nAs motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young\nchildren should achieve (Table). For each milestone there is an average age, as\nwell as a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached. An example of\na developmentalmilestone is sitting. On average, most babies sit alone at 7\nmonths old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of\nbabies achieve this milestone between 5 and 9 months old. In another example,\nbabies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and 90% of\nbabies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up\nhis head by 4 months old, he is showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on\nseveral milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or caregiver should\ndiscuss this with the child\u2019s pediatrician. Some developmental delays can be\nidentified and addressed through early intervention.\nDevelopmental Milestones, Ages 2\u20135 Years\nAge\n(years) Physical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\n2 Kicks a Plays alongside Points to Sorts shapes\nball; walks other children; objects when and colors;\nup and copies adults named; puts follows 2-step\ndown 2\u20134 words instructions\nstairs together in a\nsentence\n3 Climbs Takes turns; Names familiar Plays make\nand runs; expresses many things; uses believe; works\npedals emotions; dresses toys with parts Developmental Milestones, Ages 2\u20135 Years\nAge\n(years) Physical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\ntricycle self pronouns (levers, handles)\n4 Catches Prefers social play Knows songs Names colors\nballs; uses to solo play; knows and rhymes by and numbers;\nscissors likes and interests memory begins writing\nletters\n5 Hops and Distinguishes real Speaks clearly; Counts to 10 or\nswings; from pretend; likes uses full higher; prints\nuses fork to please friends sentences some letters\nand spoon and copies basic\nshapes\nCognitive Development\nIn addition to rapid physical growth, young children also exhibit significant\ndevelopment of their cognitive abilities. Piaget thought that children\u2019s ability to\nunderstand objects\u2014such as learning that a rattle makes a noise when shaken\u2014\nwas a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the\nenvironment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect.\nResearchers have found that even very young children understand objects and\nhow they work long before they have experience with those objects (Baillargeon,\n1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, children as young as 3\nmonths old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had\nonly viewed and did not have prior experience with them. In one study, 3-month-\nold infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a screen. The box,\nwhich appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The\ntruck rolled past the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the\ntrack to block the path of the truck. When the truck was rolled down the track this\ntime, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more time looking at\nthis impossible event (Figure). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each other. Baillargeon\u2019s findings suggest that very\nyoung children have an understanding of objects and how they work, which\nPiaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to their\nlimited experiences in the world.\nIn Baillargeon\u2019s study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed\ntrack, (b) roll down an unobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and\n(c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an obstruction.\nJust as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are\nalso cognitive milestones. It is helpful to be aware of these milestones as children\ngain new abilities to think, problem solve, and communicate. For example, infants\nshake their head \u201cno\u201d around 6\u20139 months, and they respond to verbal requests to\ndo things like \u201cwave bye-bye\u201d or \u201cblow a kiss\u201d around 9\u201312 months. Remember\nPiaget\u2019s ideas about object permanence? We can expect children to grasp the\nconcept that objects continue to exist even when they are not in sight by around\n8 months old. Because toddlers (i.e., 12\u201324 months old) have mastered object\npermanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when\nsomeone leaves the room they will come back (Loop, 2013). Toddlers also point\nto pictures in books and look in appropriate places when you ask them to find\nobjects.\nPreschool-age children (i.e., 3\u20135 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive\ndevelopment. Not only can they count, name colors, and tell you their name and\nage, but they can also make some decisions on their own, such as choosing an\noutfit to wear. Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and\nsequencing (e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in\na story. They also begin to enjoy the use of humor in stories. Because they can\nthink symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaborate characters and scenarios. One of the most common examples of their cognitive growth is\ntheir blossoming curiosity. Preschool-age children love to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d\nAn important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget\ndescribed 2\u20133 year olds as egocentric, meaning that they do not have an\nawareness of others\u2019 points of view. Between 3 and 5 years old, children come to\nunderstand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different\nfrom their own. This is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill\nto tease others, persuade their parents to purchase a candy bar, or understand\nwhy a sibling might be angry. When children develop TOM, they can recognize\nthat others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).\nFalse-belief tasks are useful in determining a child\u2019s acquisition of theory-of-mind\n(TOM). Take a look at this video clip showing a false-belief task involving a box of\ncrayons.\nCognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6\u201311 years old).\nThought processes become more logical and organized when dealing with\nconcrete information (Figure). Children at this age understand concepts such as\nthe past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward\ngoals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and\nsubtraction and cause-and-effect relationships. However, children\u2019s attention\nspans tend to be very limited until they are around 11 years old. After that point,\nit begins to improve through adulthood. Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood\n(6\u201311 years old) are able to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)\nOne well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As\nmentioned earlier, the order in which children learn language structures is\nconsistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). You\u2019ve also learned that\nsome psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biological\npredisposition for language acquisition.\nStarting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills.\nAt birth, babies apparently recognize their mother\u2019s voice and can discriminate\nbetween the language(s) spoken by their mothers and foreign languages, and\nthey show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible\nlanguage (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).\nChildren communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and\nthere is some evidence that gesture usage predicts subsequent language\ndevelopment (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In terms of producing spoken\nlanguage, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable\ncombination of a consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly,\nbabies replicate sounds from their own languages. A baby whose parents speak\nFrench will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or\nUrdu. After cooing, the baby starts to babble. Babbling begins with repeating a syllable, such as ma-ma, da-da, or ba-ba. When a baby is about 12 months old, we\nexpect her to say her first word for meaning, and to start combining words for\nmeaning at about 18 months.\nAt about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old\nthey have a vocabulary of up to 1,000 words and can speak in sentences. During\nthe early childhood years, children's vocabulary increases at a rapid pace. This is\nsometimes referred to as the \u201cvocabulary spurt\u201d and has been claimed to involve\nan expansion in vocabulary at a rate of 10\u201320 new words per week. Recent\nresearch may indicate that while some children experience these spurts, it is far\nfrom universal (as discussed in Ganger & Brent, 2004). It has been estimated that,\n5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can define\nwords and question their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the\nweek. Seven year olds speak fluently and use slang and clich\u00e9s (Stork &\nWiddowson, 1974).\nWhat accounts for such dramatic language learning by children? Behaviorist B. F.\nSkinner thought that we learn language in response to reinforcement or\nfeedback, such as through parental approval or through being understood. For\nexample, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, \u201cme juice,\u201d to\nwhich his mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam\nChomsky (1957) criticized Skinner\u2019s theory and proposed that we are all born with\nan innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky called this mechanism a language\nacquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right.\nRemember that we are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now\nbelieve that language acquisition is partially inborn and partially learned through\nour interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995;\nStork & Widdowson, 1974).\nAttachment\nPsychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with\nothers, and understand and manage their feelings. In social and emotional\ndevelopment, forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major\nsocial milestone of infancy. Attachment is a long-standing connection or bond\nwith others. Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this\nmilestone. They ask such questions as: How do parent and infant attachment bonds form? How does neglect affect these bonds? What accounts for children\u2019s\nattachment differences?\nResearchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies\ndesigned to answer these questions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of\nexperiments on monkeys. He separated newborn monkeys from their mothers.\nEach monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers. One surrogate monkey\nwas made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey was\nsofter and made from cloth: This monkey did not dispense milk. Research shows\nthat the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey, even though she did\nnot provide any nourishment. The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the\ncloth monkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed.\nPrior to this study, the medical and scientific communities generally thought that\nbabies become attached to the people who provide their nourishment. However,\nHarlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than\nnourishment. Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to\nmaternal-infant bonding, which leads to healthy psychosocial development.\nHarlow\u2019s studies of monkeys were performed before modern ethics guidelines\nwere in place, and today his experiments are widely considered to be unethical\nand even cruel. Watch this video to see actual footage of Harlow\u2019s monkey\nstudies.\nBuilding on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept\nof attachment theory. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that\nan infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). An infant must form this bond\nwith a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional\ndevelopment. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very\npowerful and continues throughout life. He used the concept of secure base to\ndefine a healthy attachment between parent and child (1988). A secure base is a\nparental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings. Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment:\nThe caregiver must be responsive to the child\u2019s physical, social, and emotional\nneeds; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable\ninteractions (Bowlby, 1969) (Figure).\nMutually enjoyable interactions promote the mother-infant bond. (credit: Peter\nShanks)\nWhile Bowlby thought attachment was an all-or-nothing process, Mary\nAinsworth\u2019s (1970) research showed otherwise. Ainsworth wanted to know if\nchildren differ in the ways they bond, and if so, why. To find the answers, she\nused the Strange Situation procedure to study attachment between mothers and\ntheir infants (1970). In the Strange Situation, the mother (or primary caregiver)\nand the infant (age 12-18 months) are placed in a room together. There are toys\nin the room, and the caregiver and child spend some time alone in the room.\nAfter the child has had time to explore her surroundings, a stranger enters the\nroom. The mother then leaves her baby with the stranger. After a few minutes,\nshe returns to comfort her child.\nBased on how the infants/toddlers responded to the separation and reunion,\nAinsworth identified three types of parent-child attachments: secure, avoidant, and resistant (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). A fourth style, known as disorganized\nattachment, was later described (Main & Solomon, 1990). The most common type\nof attachment\u2014also considered the healthiest\u2014is called secure\nattachment (Figure). In this type of attachment, the toddler prefers his parent\nover a stranger. The attachment figure is used as a secure base to explore the\nenvironment and is sought out in times of stress. Securely attached children were\ndistressed when their caregivers left the room in the Strange Situation\nexperiment, but when their caregivers returned, the securely attached children\nwere happy to see them. Securely attached children have caregivers who are\nsensitive and responsive to their needs.\nIn secure attachment, the parent provides a secure base for the toddler, allowing\nhim to securely explore his environment. (credit: Kerry Ceszyk)\nWith avoidant attachment, the child is unresponsive to the parent, does not use\nthe parent as a secure base, and does not care if the parent leaves. The toddler\nreacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger. When the parent does\nreturn, the child is slow to show a positive reaction. Ainsworth theorized that\nthese children were most likely to have a caregiver who was insensitive and\ninattentive to their needs (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). In cases of resistant attachment, children tend to show clingy behavior, but then\nthey reject the attachment figure\u2019s attempts to interact with them (Ainsworth &\nBell, 1970). These children do not explore the toys in the room, as they are too\nfearful. During separation in the Strange Situation, they became extremely\ndisturbed and angry with the parent. When the parent returns, the children are\ndifficult to comfort. Resistant attachment is the result of the caregivers\u2019\ninconsistent level of response to their child.\nFinally, children with disorganized attachment behaved oddly in the Strange\nSituation. They freeze, run around the room in an erratic manner, or try to run\naway when the caregiver returns (Main & Solomon, 1990). This type of\nattachment is seen most often in kids who have been abused. Research has\nshown that abuse disrupts a child\u2019s ability to regulate their emotions.\nWhile Ainsworth\u2019s research has found support in subsequent studies, it has also\nmet criticism. Some researchers have pointed out that a child\u2019s temperament may\nhave a strong influence on attachment (Gervai, 2009; Harris, 2009), and others\nhave noted that attachment varies from culture to culture, a factor not accounted\nfor in Ainsworth\u2019s research (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000; van\nIjzendoorn & Sagi-Schwartz, 2008).\nWatch this video to view a clip of the Strange Situation. Try to identify which type\nof attachment baby Lisa exhibits.\nSelf-Concept\nJust as attachment is the main psychosocial milestone of infancy, the primary\npsychosocial milestone of childhood is the development of a positive sense of\nself. How does self-awareness develop? Infants don\u2019t have a self-concept, which is\nan understanding of who they are. If you place a baby in front of a mirror, she will\nreach out to touch her image, thinking it is another baby. However, by about 18 months a toddler will recognize that the person in the mirror is herself. How do\nwe know this? In a well-known experiment, a researcher placed a red dot of paint\non children\u2019s noses before putting them in front of a mirror (Amsterdam, 1972).\nCommonly known as the mirror test, this behavior is demonstrated by humans\nand a few other species and is considered evidence of self-recognition (Archer,\n1992). At 18 months old they would touch their own noses when they saw the\npaint, surprised to see a spot on their faces. By 24\u201336 months old children can\nname and/or point to themselves in pictures, clearly indicating self-recognition.\nChildren from 2\u20134 years old display a great increase in social behavior once they\nhave established a self-concept. They enjoy playing with other children, but they\nhave difficulty sharing their possessions. Also, through play children explore and\ncome to understand their gender roles and can label themselves as a girl or boy\n(Chick, Heilman-Houser, & Hunter, 2002). By 4 years old, children can cooperate\nwith other children, share when asked, and separate from parents with little\nanxiety. Children at this age also exhibit autonomy, initiate tasks, and carry out\nplans. Success in these areas contributes to a positive sense of self. Once children\nreach 6 years old, they can identify themselves in terms of group memberships:\n\u201cI\u2019m a first grader!\u201d School-age children compare themselves to their peers and\ndiscover that they are competent in some areas and less so in others (recall\nErikson\u2019s task of industry versus inferiority). At this age, children recognize their\nown personality traits as well as some other traits they would like to have. For\nexample, 10-year-old Layla says, \u201cI\u2019m kind of shy. I wish I could be more talkative\nlike my friend Alexa.\u201d\nDevelopment of a positive self-concept is important to healthy development.\nChildren with a positive self-concept tend to be more confident, do better in\nschool, act more independently, and are more willing to try new activities\n(Maccoby, 1980; Ferrer & Fugate, 2003). Formation of a positive self-concept\nbegins in Erikson\u2019s toddlerhood stage, when children establish autonomy and\nbecome confident in their abilities. Development of self-concept continues in\nelementary school, when children compare themselves to others. When the\ncomparison is favorable, children feel a sense of competence and are motivated\nto work harder and accomplish more. Self-concept is re-evaluated in Erikson\u2019s\nadolescence stage, as teens form an identity. They internalize the messages they\nhave received regarding their strengths and weaknesses, keeping some messages\nand rejecting others. Adolescents who have achieved identity formation are\ncapable of contributing positively to society (Erikson, 1968). What can parents do to nurture a healthy self-concept? Diana Baumrind (1971,\n1991) thinks parenting style may be a factor. The way we parent is an important\nfactor in a child\u2019s socioemotional growth. Baumrind developed and refined\na theory describing four parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive,\nand uninvolved. With the authoritative style, the parent gives reasonable\ndemands and consistent limits, expresses warmth and affection, and listens to the\nchild\u2019s point of view. Parents set rules and explain the reasons behind them. They\nare also flexible and willing to make exceptions to the rules in certain cases\u2014for\nexample, temporarily relaxing bedtime rules to allow for a nighttime swim during\na family vacation. Of the four parenting styles, the authoritative style is the one\nthat is most encouraged in modern American society. American children raised by\nauthoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and social skills. However,\neffective parenting styles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points\nout, the authoritative style is not necessarily preferred or appropriate in all\ncultures.\nIn authoritarian style, the parent places high value on conformity and obedience.\nThe parents are often strict, tightly monitor their children, and express little\nwarmth. In contrast to the authoritative style, authoritarian parents probably\nwould not relax bedtime rules during a vacation because they consider the rules\nto be set, and they expect obedience. This style can create anxious, withdrawn,\nand unhappy kids. However, it is important to point out that authoritarian\nparenting is as beneficial as the authoritative style in some ethnic groups (Russell,\nCrockett, & Chao, 2010). For instance, first-generation Chinese American children\nraised by authoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers who were\nraised by authoritative parents (Russell et al., 2010).\nFor parents who employ the permissive style of parenting, the kids run the show\nand anything goes. Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use\npunishment. They tend to be very nurturing and loving, and may play the role of\nfriend rather than parent. In terms of our example of vacation bedtimes,\npermissive parents might not have bedtime rules at all\u2014instead they allow the\nchild to choose his bedtime whether on vacation or not. Not surprisingly, children\nraised by permissive parents tend to lack self-discipline, and the permissive\nparenting style is negatively associated with grades (Dornbusch, Ritter,\nLeiderman, Roberts, & Fraleigh, 1987). The permissive style may also contribute\nto other risky behaviors such as alcohol abuse (Bahr & Hoffman, 2010), risky\nsexual behavior especially among female children (Donenberg, Wilson, Emerson, & Bryant, 2002), and increased display of disruptive behaviors by male children\n(Parent et al., 2011). However, there are some positive outcomes associated with\nchildren raised by permissive parents. They tend to have higher self-esteem,\nbetter social skills, and report lower levels of depression (Darling, 1999).\nWith the uninvolved style of parenting, the parents are indifferent, uninvolved,\nand sometimes referred to as neglectful. They don\u2019t respond to the child\u2019s needs\nand make relatively few demands. This could be because of severe depression or\nsubstance abuse, or other factors such as the parents\u2019 extreme focus on work.\nThese parents may provide for the child\u2019s basic needs, but little else. The children\nraised in this parenting style are usually emotionally withdrawn, fearful, anxious,\nperform poorly in school, and are at an increased risk of substance abuse (Darling,\n1999).\nAs you can see, parenting styles influence childhood adjustment, but could a\nchild\u2019s temperament likewise influence parenting? Temperament refers to innate\ntraits that influence how one thinks, behaves, and reacts with the environment.\nChildren with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions, adapt well to\nchange, and are capable of regulating their emotions. Conversely, children with\ndifficult temperaments demonstrate negative emotions and have difficulty\nadapting to change and regulating their emotions. Difficult children are much\nmore likely to challenge parents, teachers, and other caregivers (Thomas, 1984).\nTherefore, it\u2019s possible that easy children (i.e., social, adaptable, and easy to\nsoothe) tend to elicit warm and responsive parenting, while demanding, irritable,\nwithdrawn children evoke irritation in their parents or cause their parents to\nwithdraw (Sanson & Rothbart, 1995).\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY AND RECESS\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007), unstructured play is an\nintegral part of a child\u2019s development. It builds creativity, problem solving skills,\nand social relationships. Play also allows children to develop a theory-of-mind as\nthey imaginatively take on the perspective of others.\nOutdoor play allows children the opportunity to directly experience and sense the\nworld around them. While doing so, they may collect objects that they come\nacross and develop lifelong interests and hobbies. They also benefit from\nincreased exercise, and engaging in outdoor play can actually increase how much they enjoy physical activity. This helps support the development of a healthy\nheart and brain. Unfortunately, research suggests that today\u2019s children are\nengaging in less and less outdoor play (Clements, 2004). Perhaps, it is no surprise\nto learn that lowered levels of physical activity in conjunction with easy access to\ncalorie-dense foods with little nutritional value are contributing to alarming levels\nof childhood obesity (Karnik & Kanekar, 2012).\nDespite the adverse consequences associated with reduced play, some children\nare over scheduled and have little free time to engage in unstructured play. In\naddition, some schools have taken away recess time for children in a push for\nstudents to do better on standardized tests, and many schools commonly use loss\nof recess as a form of punishment. Do you agree with these practices? Why or\nwhy not?\nADOLESCENCE\nAdolescence is a socially constructed concept. In pre-industrial society, children\nwere considered adults when they reached physical maturity, but today we have\nan extended time between childhood and adulthood called\nadolescence. Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty\nand ends at emerging adulthood, which is discussed later. In the United States,\nadolescence is seen as a time to develop independence from parents while\nremaining connected to them (Figure). The typical age range of adolescence is\nfrom 12 to 18 years, and this stage of development also has some predictable\nphysical, cognitive, and psychosocial milestones. Peers are a primary influence on our development in adolescence. (credit: Sheila\nTostes)\nPhysical Development\nAs noted above, adolescence begins with puberty. While the sequence of physical\nchanges in puberty is predictable, the onset and pace of puberty vary widely.\nSeveral physical changes occur during puberty, such\nas adrenarche and gonadarche, the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex\nglands, respectively. Also during this time, primary and secondary sexual\ncharacteristics develop and mature. Primary sexual characteristics are organs\nspecifically needed for reproduction, like the uterus and ovaries in females and\ntestes in males. Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual\nmaturation that do not directly involve sex organs, such as development of\nbreasts and hips in girls, and development of facial hair and a deepened voice in\nboys. Girls experience menarche, the beginning of menstrual periods, usually\naround 12\u201313 years old, and boys experience spermarche, the first ejaculation,\naround 13\u201314 years old.\nDuring puberty, both sexes experience a rapid increase in height (i.e., growth\nspurt). For girls this begins between 8 and 13 years old, with adult height reached\nbetween 10 and 16 years old. Boys begin their growth spurt slightly later, usually\nbetween 10 and 16 years old, and reach their adult height between 13 and 17 years old. Both nature (i.e., genes) and nurture (e.g., nutrition, medications, and\nmedical conditions) can influence height.\nBecause rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty\ncan be a source of pride or embarrassment. Early maturing boys tend to be\nstronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturing peers. They are\nusually more popular, confident, and independent, but they are also at a greater\nrisk for substance abuse and early sexual activity (Flannery, Rowe, & Gulley, 1993;\nKaltiala-Heino, Rimpela, Rissanen, & Rantanen, 2001). Early maturing girls may be\nteased or overtly admired, which can cause them to feel self-conscious about\ntheir developing bodies. These girls are at a higher risk for depression, substance\nabuse, and eating disorders (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Graber, Lewinsohn,\nSeeley, & Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore & Cachelin, 1999). Late blooming\nboys and girls (i.e., they develop more slowly than their peers) may feel self-\nconscious about their lack of physical development. Negative feelings are\nparticularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for\ndepression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more likely to be\nbullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).\nThe adolescent brain also remains under development. Up until puberty, brain\ncells continue to bloom in the frontal region. Adolescents engage in increased\nrisk-taking behaviors and emotional outbursts possibly because the frontal lobes\nof their brains are still developing (Figure). Recall that this area is responsible for\njudgment, impulse control, and planning, and it is still maturing into early\nadulthood (Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005). Brain growth continues into the early 20s. The development of the frontal lobe, in\nparticular, is important during this stage.\nAccording to neuroscientist Jay Giedd in the Frontline video \u201cInside the Teenage\nBrain\u201d (2013), \u201cIt\u2019s sort of unfair to expect [teens] to have adult levels of\norganizational skills or decision-making before their brains are finished being\nbuilt.\u201d Watch this segment on \u201cThe Wiring of the Adolescent Brain\u201d to find out\nmore about the developing brain during adolescence.\nCognitive Development\nMore complex thinking abilities emerge during adolescence. Some researchers\nsuggest this is due to increases in processing speed and efficiency rather than as\nthe result of an increase in mental capacity\u2014in other words, due to\nimprovements in existing skills rather than development of new ones (Bjorkland,\n1987; Case, 1985). During adolescence, teenagers move beyond concrete thinking\nand become capable of abstract thought. Recall that Piaget refers to this stage as\nformal operational thought. Teen thinking is also characterized by the ability to\nconsider multiple points of view, imagine hypothetical situations, debate ideas\nand opinions (e.g., politics, religion, and justice), and form new ideas (Figure). In\naddition, it\u2019s not uncommon for adolescents to question authority or challenge\nestablished societal norms.\nCognitive empathy, also known as theory-of-mind (which we discussed earlier\nwith regard to egocentrism), relates to the ability to take the perspective of\nothers and feel concern for others (Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, & Aharon-Peretz,\n2005). Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important\ncomponent of social problem solving and conflict avoidance. According to one\nlongitudinal study, levels of cognitive empathy begin rising in girls around 13\nyears old, and around 15 years old in boys (Van der Graaff et al., 2013). Teens\nwho reported having supportive fathers with whom they could discuss their worries were found to be better able to take the perspective of others\n(Miklikowska, Duriez, & Soenens, 2011).\nTeenage thinking is characterized by the ability to reason logically and solve\nhypothetical problems such as how to design, plan, and build a structure. (credit:\nU.S. Army RDECOM)\nPsychosocial Development\nAdolescents continue to refine their sense of self as they relate to others. Erikson\nreferred to the task of the adolescent as one of identity versus role confusion.\nThus, in Erikson\u2019s view, an adolescent\u2019s main questions are \u201cWho am I?\u201d and\n\u201cWho do I want to be?\u201d Some adolescents adopt the values and roles that their\nparents expect for them. Other teens develop identities that are in opposition to\ntheir parents but align with a peer group. This is common as peer relationships\nbecome a central focus in adolescents\u2019 lives.\nAs adolescents work to form their identities, they pull away from their parents,\nand the peer group becomes very important (Shanahan, McHale, Osgood, &\nCrouter, 2007). Despite spending less time with their parents, most teens report\npositive feelings toward them (Moore, Guzman, Hair, Lippman, & Garrett, 2004).\nWarm and healthy parent-child relationships have been associated with positive child outcomes, such as better grades and fewer school behavior problems, in the\nUnited States as well as in other countries (Hair et al., 2005).\nIt appears that most teens don\u2019t experience adolescent storm and stress to the\ndegree once famously suggested by G. Stanley Hall, a pioneer in the study of\nadolescent development. Only small numbers of teens have major conflicts with\ntheir parents (Steinberg & Morris, 2001), and most disagreements are minor. For\nexample, in a study of over 1,800 parents of adolescents from various cultural and\nethnic groups, Barber (1994) found that conflicts occurred over day-to-day issues\nsuch as homework, money, curfews, clothing, chores, and friends. These types of\narguments tend to decrease as teens develop (Galambos & Almeida, 1992).\nEmerging Adulthood\nThe next stage of development is emerging adulthood. This is a relatively newly\ndefined period of lifespan development spanning from 18 years old to the mid-\n20s, characterized as an in-between time where identity exploration is focused on\nwork and love.\nWhen does a person become an adult? There are many ways to answer this\nquestion. In the United States, you are legally considered an adult at 18 years old.\nBut other definitions of adulthood vary widely; in sociology, for example, a person\nmay be considered an adult when she becomes self-supporting, chooses a career,\ngets married, or starts a family. The ages at which we achieve these milestones\nvary from person to person as well as from culture to culture. For example, in the\nAfrican country of Malawi, 15-year-old Njemile was married at 14 years old and\nhad her first child at 15 years old. In her culture she is considered an adult.\nChildren in Malawi take on adult responsibilities such as marriage and work (e.g.,\ncarrying water, tending babies, and working fields) as early as 10 years old. In\nstark contrast, independence in Western cultures is taking longer and longer,\neffectively delaying the onset of adult life.\nWhy is it taking twentysomethings so long to grow up? It seems that emerging\nadulthood is a product of both Western culture and our current times (Arnett,\n2000). People in developed countries are living longer, allowing the freedom to\ntake an extra decade to start a career and family. Changes in the workforce also\nplay a role. For example, 50 years ago, a young adult with a high school diploma\ncould immediately enter the work force and climb the corporate ladder. That is no longer the case. Bachelor\u2019s and even graduate degrees are required more and\nmore often\u2014even for entry-level jobs (Arnett, 2000). In addition, many students\nare taking longer (five or six years) to complete a college degree as a result of\nworking and going to school at the same time. After graduation, many young\nadults return to the family home because they have difficulty finding a job.\nChanging cultural expectations may be the most important reason for the delay in\nentering adult roles. Young people are spending more time exploring their\noptions, so they are delaying marriage and work as they change majors and jobs\nmultiple times, putting them on a much later timetable than their parents (Arnett,\n2000).\nADULTHOOD\nAdulthood begins around 20 years old and has three distinct stages: early, middle,\nand late. Each stage brings its own set of rewards and challenges.\nPhysical Development\nBy the time we reach early adulthood (20 to early 40s), our physical maturation is\ncomplete, although our height and weight may increase slightly. In young\nadulthood, our physical abilities are at their peak, including muscle strength,\nreaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning. Most professional\nathletes are at the top of their game during this stage. Many women have\nchildren in the young adulthood years, so they may see additional weight gain and\nbreast changes.\nMiddle adulthood extends from the 40s to the 60s (Figure). Physical decline is\ngradual. The skin loses some elasticity, and wrinkles are among the first signs of\naging. Visual acuity decreases during this time. Women experience a gradual\ndecline in fertility as they approach the onset of menopause, the end of the\nmenstrual cycle, around 50 years old. Both men and women tend to gain weight:\nin the abdominal area for men and in the hips and thighs for women. Hair begins\nto thin and turn gray. Physical declines of middle and late adulthood can be minimized with proper\nexercise, nutrition, and an active lifestyle. (credit: modification of work by Peter\nStevens)\nLate adulthood is considered to extend from the 60s on. This is the last stage of\nphysical change. The skin continues to lose elasticity, reaction time slows further,\nand muscle strength diminishes. Smell, taste, hearing, and vision, so sharp in our\ntwenties, decline significantly. The brain may also no longer function at optimal\nlevels, leading to problems like memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease\nin later years.\nAging doesn\u2019t mean a person can\u2019t explore new pursuits, learn new skills, and\ncontinue to grow. Watch this inspiring story about Neil Unger who is a newbie to\nthe world of skateboarding at 60 years old. Cognitive Development\nBecause we spend so many years in adulthood (more than any other stage),\ncognitive changes are numerous. In fact, research suggests that adult cognitive\ndevelopment is a complex, ever changing process that may be even more active\nthan cognitive development in infancy and early childhood (Fischer, Yan, &\nStewart, 2003).\nThere is good news for the middle age brain. View this brief video to find out\nwhat it is.\nUnlike our physical abilities, which peak in our mid-20s and then begin a slow\ndecline, our cognitive abilities remain steady throughout early and middle\nadulthood. Our crystalized intelligence (information, skills, and strategies we have\ngathered through a lifetime of experience) tends to hold steady as we age\u2014it\nmay even improve. For example, adults show relatively stable to increasing scores\non intelligence tests until their mid-30s to mid-50s (Bayley & Oden, 1955).\nHowever, in late adulthood we begin to experience a decline in another area of\nour cognitive abilities\u2014fluid intelligence (information processing abilities,\nreasoning, and memory). These processes become slower. How can we delay the\nonset of cognitive decline? Mental and physical activity seems to play a part\n(Figure). Research has found adults who engage in mentally and physically\nstimulating activities experience less cognitive decline and have a reduced\nincidence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia (Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, &\nLindenberger, 2009; Larson et al., 2006; Podewils et al., 2005). Cognitive activities such as playing mahjong, chess, or other games, can keep you\nmentally fit. The same is true for solo pastimes like reading and completing\ncrossword puzzles. (credit: Philippe Put)\nPsychosocial Development\nThere are many theories about the social and emotional aspects of aging. Some\naspects of healthy aging include activities, social connectedness, and the role of a\nperson\u2019s culture. According to many theorists, including George Vaillant (2002),\nwho studied and analyzed over 50 years of data, we need to have and continue to\nfind meaning throughout our lives. For those in early and middle adulthood,\nmeaning is found through work (Sterns & Huyck, 2001) and family life (Markus,\nRyff, Curan, & Palmersheim, 2004). These areas relate to the tasks that Erikson\nreferred to as generativity and intimacy. As mentioned previously, adults tend to\ndefine themselves by what they do\u2014their careers. Earnings peak during this time,\nyet job satisfaction is more closely tied to work that involves contact with other\npeople, is interesting, provides opportunities for advancement, and allows some\nindependence (Mohr & Zoghi, 2006) than it is to salary (Iyengar, Wells, &\nSchwartz, 2006). How might being unemployed or being in a dead-end job\nchallenge adult well-being?\nPositive relationships with significant others in our adult years have been found to\ncontribute to a state of well-being (Ryff & Singer, 2009). Most adults in the United States identify themselves through their relationships with family\u2014particularly\nwith spouses, children, and parents (Markus et al., 2004). While raising children\ncan be stressful, especially when they are young, research suggests that parents\nreap the rewards down the road, as adult children tend to have a positive effect\non parental well-being (Umberson, Pudrovska, & Reczek, 2010). Having a stable\nmarriage has also been found to contribute to well-being throughout adulthood\n(Vaillant, 2002).\nAnother aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social\nsupport. As we get older, socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our\nsocial support and friendships dwindle in number, but remain as close, if not\nmore close than in our earlier years (Carstensen, 1992) (Figure).\nSocial support is important as we age. (credit: Gabriel Rocha)\nTo learn more, view this video on aging in America. Summary\nAt conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin\nto divide rapidly. This marks the beginning of the first stage of prenatal\ndevelopment (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then the zygote\nimplants itself into the lining of the woman\u2019s uterus, marking the beginning of the\nsecond stage of prenatal development (embryonic stage), which lasts about six\nweeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ structures, and the neural\ntube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of\nprenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The\nbody, brain, and organs grow rapidly during this stage. During all stages of\npregnancy it is important that the mother receive prenatal care to reduce health\nrisks to herself and to her developing baby.\nNewborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn\u2019s reflexes,\nsuch as the sucking, rooting, and Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and\npsychosocial skills grow and change as we move through developmental stages\nfrom infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical\ncomponent of healthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an\neffect on childhood outcomes of well-being. The transition from adolescence to\nadulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the\nextended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline\nbegins in middle adulthood, cognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities\nthat keep the body and mind active can help maintain good physical and cognitive\nhealth as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as\nwe age.\nGlossary\nadolescence\nperiod of development that begins at puberty and ends at early adulthood\nadrenarche\nmaturing of the adrenal glands\nattachment\nlong-standing connection or bond with others\nauthoritarian parenting style\nparents place a high value on conformity and obedience, are often rigid,\nand express little warmth to the child authoritative parenting style\nparents give children reasonable demands and consistent limits, express\nwarmth and affection, and listen to the child\u2019s point of view\navoidant attachment\ncharacterized by child\u2019s unresponsiveness to parent, does not use the\nparent as a secure base, and does not care if parent leaves\ncognitive empathy\nability to take the perspective of others and to feel concern for others\nconception\nwhen a sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote\ncritical (sensitive) period\ntime during fetal growth when specific parts or organs develop\ndisorganized attachment\ncharacterized by the child\u2019s odd behavior when faced with the parent; type\nof attachment seen most often with kids that are abused\nembryo\nmulti-cellular organism in its early stages of development\nemerging adulthood\nnewly defined period of lifespan development from 18 years old to the mid-\n20s; young people are taking longer to complete college, get a job, get\nmarried, and start a family\nfine motor skills\nuse of muscles in fingers, toes, and eyes to coordinate small actions\ngonadarche\nmaturing of the sex glands\ngross motor skills\nuse of large muscle groups to control arms and legs for large body\nmovements\nmenarche\nbeginning of menstrual period; around 12\u201313 years old\nmitosis\nprocess of cell division\nmotor skills\nability to move our body and manipulate objects\nnewborn reflexes\ninborn automatic response to a particular form of stimulation that all\nhealthy babies are born with permissive parenting style\nparents make few demands and rarely use punishment\nplacenta\nstructure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen to\nthe developing baby\nprenatal care\nmedical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother\nand the fetus\nprimary sexual characteristics\norgans specifically needed for reproduction\nresistant attachment\ncharacterized by the child\u2019s tendency to show clingy behavior and rejection\nof the parent when she attempts to interact with the child\nsecondary sexual characteristics\nphysical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex organs\nsecure attachment\ncharacterized by the child using the parent as a secure base from which to\nexplore\nsecure base\nparental presence that gives the infant/toddler a sense of safety as he\nexplores his surroundings\nsocioemotional selectivity theory\nsocial support/friendships dwindle in number, but remain as close, if not\nmore close than in earlier years\nspermarche\nfirst male ejaculation\ntemperament\ninnate traits that influence how one thinks, behaves, and reacts with the\nenvironment\nteratogen\nbiological, chemical, or physical environmental agent that causes damage\nto the developing embryo or fetus\nuninvolved parenting style\nparents are indifferent, uninvolved, and sometimes referred to as\nneglectful; they don\u2019t respond to the child\u2019s needs and make relatively few\ndemands zygote\nstructure created when a sperm and egg merge at conception; begins as a\nsingle cell and rapidly divides to form the embryo and placenta\nThis work is licensed by Rice University under a Creative Commons Attribution License (by 4.0).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/4abf04bf-93a0-45c3-9cbc-2cefd46e68cc@8.1.\n2.2 Erikson\u2019s Psychosocial Theory of Development\nErik Erikson (1902\u20131994) (Figure), another stage theorist, took Freud\u2019s theory and\nmodified it as psychosocial theory. Erikson\u2019s psychosocial development theory\nemphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature.\nWhile Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood, Erikson\nproposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan.\nErikson suggested that how we interact with others is what affects our sense of\nself, or what he called the ego identity.\nErik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of\nErikson\u2019s theory, there is a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel\na sense of competence. Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in\ncertain areas of our lives. According to psychosocial theory, we experience\neight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancy through late\nadulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve.\nSuccessful completion of each developmental task results in a sense of\ncompetence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these tasks leads to\nfeelings of inadequacy.\nAccording to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy\n(birth to 12 months). Therefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus\nmistrust. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers, so caregivers who are\nresponsive and sensitive to their infant\u2019s needs help their baby to develop a sense\nof trust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive\ncaregivers who do not meet their baby\u2019s needs can engender feelings of anxiety,\nfear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as unpredictable.\nAs toddlers (ages 1\u20133 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can\ncontrol their actions and act on the environment to get results. They begin to\nshow clear preferences for certain elements of the environment, such as food,\ntoys, and clothing. A toddler\u2019s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy\nversus shame and doubt, by working to establish independence. This is the \u201cme\ndo it\u201d stage. For example, we might observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-\nyear-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself. Although her\noutfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic\ndecisions has an effect on her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity\nto act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her abilities, which could lead\nto low self-esteem and feelings of shame.\nOnce children reach the preschool stage (ages 3\u20136 years), they are capable of\ninitiating activities and asserting control over their world through social\ninteractions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children must resolve the\ntask of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while\ninteracting with others, preschool children can master this task. Those who do\nwill develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose. Those who are\nunsuccessful at this stage\u2014with their initiative misfiring or stifled\u2014\nmay develop feelings of guilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child\u2019s\ninitiative? During the elementary school stage (ages 6\u201312), children face the task of industry\nversus inferiority. Children begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how\nthey measure up. They either develop a sense of pride and accomplishment in\ntheir schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and\ninadequate when they don\u2019t measure up. What are some things parents and\nteachers can do to help children develop a sense of competence and a belief in\nthemselves and their abilities?\nIn adolescence (ages 12\u201318), children face the task of identity versus role\nconfusion. According to Erikson, an adolescent\u2019s main task is developing a sense\nof self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as \u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I\nwant to do with my life?\u201d Along the way, most adolescents try on many different\nselves to see which ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a\nstrong sense of identity and are able to remain true to their beliefs and values in\nthe face of problems and other people\u2019s perspectives. What happens to apathetic\nadolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are\npressured to conform to their parents\u2019 ideas for the future? These teens will have\na weak sense of self and experience role confusion. They are unsure of their\nidentity and confused about the future.\nPeople in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with\nintimacy versus isolation. After we have developed a sense of self in adolescence,\nwe are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we must have a\nstrong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults\nwho do not develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience\nfeelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.\nWhen people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood,\nwhich extends to the mid-60s. The social task of middle adulthood is generativity\nversus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life\u2019s work and contributing\nto the developmentof others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring,\nand raising children. Those who do not master this task may experience\nstagnation, having little connection with others and little interest in productivity\nand self-improvement.\nFrom the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known\nas late adulthood. Erikson\u2019s task at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He\nsaid that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments\nfeel a sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets.\nHowever, people who are not successful at this stage may feel as if their life has\nbeen wasted. They focus on what \u201cwould have,\u201d \u201cshould have,\u201d and \u201ccould have\u201d\nbeen. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and\ndespair.

Instead of approaching development from a\npsychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children\u2019s\ncognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect\nof development and that children are naturally inquisitive. However, he said that\nchildren do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory of\ncognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through\nspecific stages, which exemplifies the discontinuity approach to development. As\nwe progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we think and reason. Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.\nPiaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the\nworld. Schemata are concepts (mental models) that are used to help us\ncategorize and interpret information. By the time children have reached\nadulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children\nlearn new information, they adjust their schemata through two processes:\nassimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new information or\nexperiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in\ninformation that is comparable to what they already\nknow. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata based on\nnew information. This process continues as children interact with their\nenvironment. For example, 2-year-old Blake learned the schema for dogs because his family has\na Labrador retriever. When Blake sees other dogs in his picture books, he says,\n\u201cLook mommy, dog!\u201d Thus, he has assimilated them into his schema for dogs.\nOne day, Blake sees a sheep for the first time and says, \u201cLook mommy, dog!\u201d\nHaving a basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Blake thinks\nall furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. When Blake\u2019s mom tells him that the\nanimal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Blake must accommodate his schema for\ndogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Blake\u2019s schema\nfor dog was too broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now\nmodifies his schema for dogs and forms a new one for sheep.\nLike Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series\nof stages approximately associated with age ranges. He proposed a theory of\ncognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational,\nconcrete operational, and formal operational (Table).\nPiaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive Development\nAge\n(years) Stage Description Developmental issues\n0\u20132 Sensorimotor World experienced Object permanence\nthrough senses and\nactions\nStranger anxiety\n2\u20136 Preoperational Use words and images Pretend play\nto represent things,\nbut lack logical\nreasoning Egocentrism\nLanguage development Piaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive Development\nAge\n(years) Stage Description Developmental issues\n7\u201311 Concrete Understand concrete Conservation\noperational events and analogies\nlogically; perform\narithmetical Mathematical\noperations transformations\n12\u2013 Formal Formal operations Abstract logic\noperational\nUtilize abstract Moral reasoning\nreasoning\nThe first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years\nold. During this stage, children learn about the world through their senses and\nmotor behavior. Young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are\nedible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if\nthey make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child developsobject\npermanence, which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight, it\nstill exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000). According to Piaget, young\ninfants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget\nstudied infants\u2019 reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then\nhidden under a blanket. Infants who had already developed object permanence\nwould reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas\ninfants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused. Please take a few minutes to view this brief video demonstrating different\nchildren\u2019s ability to understand object permanence.\nIn Piaget\u2019s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they\nalso begin to exhibit stranger anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies\nmay demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a stranger, by clinging to a\ncaregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as\nparents. Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger\ninto an existing schema; therefore, she can\u2019t predict what her experience with\nthat stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.\nPiaget\u2019s second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2\nto 7 years old. In this stage, children can use symbols to represent words, images,\nand ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play. A child\u2019s\narms might become airplane wings as he zooms around the room, or a child with\na stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use\nlanguage in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or\nmentally manipulate information (the term operational refers to logical\nmanipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-\noperational). Children\u2019s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the\nworld so far, rather than on conventional knowledge. For example, dad gave a\nslice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old brother,\nKenny. Kenny\u2019s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he\ngot more pizza than she did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental\noperations because they have not developed an understanding of conservation,\nwhich is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is still\nequal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added. This video shows a 4.5-year-old boy in the preoperational stage as he responds to\nPiaget\u2019s conservation tasks.\nDuring this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means\nthat the child is not able to take the perspective of others. A child at\nthis stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do. Let\u2019s look at\nKenny and Keiko again. Keiko\u2019s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny\nto the toy store to choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action\nfigure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his sister will too. An egocentric\nchild is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his\nown perspective.\nPiaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism\ndisplayed by children. Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one\nviewpoint, and are asked what another person at a different viewpoint would see\nin the same scene. Watch the Three-Mountain Task in action in this short\nvideo from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.\nPiaget\u2019s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7\nto 11 years old. In this stage, children can think logically about real (concrete)\nevents; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ\nmemory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand\ntransformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and\nmultiplication is the opposite of division. In this stage, children also master the\nconcept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass, volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a\nshort, fat glass, you still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and\nKenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that Kenny was wrong when he said\nthat he had more pizza?\nChildren in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle\nof reversibility, which means that objects can be changed and then returned back\nto their original form or condition. Take, for example, water that you poured into\nthe short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass\nand still have the same amount (minus a couple of drops).\nThe fourth, and last, stage in Piaget\u2019s theory is the formal operational stage,\nwhich is from about age 11 to adulthood. Whereas children in the concrete\noperational stage are able to think logically only about concrete events, children\nin the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical\nsituations. Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look\nat alternative solutions, and test these solutions. In adolescence, a renewed\negocentrism occurs. For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimple on her\nface might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression\nthat others must share her perceptions.\nBeyond Formal Operational Thought\nAs with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget\u2019s\nideas have come under criticism based on the results of further research. For\nexample, several contemporary studies support a model of development that is\nmore continuous than Piaget\u2019s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler,\n2005, 2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier\nthan Piaget describes (Baillargeon, 2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).\nAccording to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal\noperational thought, which develops between 11 and 20 years old. However,\nmany developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a\nfifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches,\n1984; Commons & Bresette, 2006; Sinnott, 1998). In postformal thinking,\ndecisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and logic is integrated\nwith emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that\nwe can see the difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of how they handle emotionally\ncharged issues.\nIt seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As\nwe attempt to solve problems, we tend to think more deeply about many areas of\nour lives, such as relationships, work, and politics (Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999).\nBecause of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to help\nthem solve new problems. Problem-solving strategies using postformal thought\nvary, depending on the situation. What does this mean? Adults can recognize, for\nexample, that what seems to be an ideal solution to a problem at work involving a\ndisagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement\nwith a significant other.\n2.4 Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nA major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning\nright from wrong. Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927\u20131987) extended upon\nthe foundation that Piaget built regarding cognitive development. Kohlberg\nbelieved that moral development, like cognitive development, follows a series\nof stages. To develop this theory, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to people of all\nages, and then he analyzed their answers to find evidence of their\nparticular stage of moral development. Before reading about the stages, take a\nminute to consider how you would answer one of Kohlberg's best-known moral\ndilemmas, commonly known as the Heinz dilemma:\nIn Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one\ndrug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a\ndruggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to\nmake, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make.\nHe paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The\nsick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money,\nbut he could only get together about $1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told\nthe druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay\nlater. But the druggist said: \u201cNo, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make\nmoney from it.\u201d So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife. Should the husband have done that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p.\n379)\nHow would you answer this dilemma? Kohlberg was not interested in whether\nyou answer yes or no to the dilemma: Instead, he was interested in the reasoning\nbehind your answer.\nAfter presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg\nreviewed people\u2019s responses and placed them in different stages of moral\nreasoning (Figure). According to Kohlberg, an individual progresses from the\ncapacity for pre-conventional morality (before age 9) to the capacity for\nconventional morality (early adolescence), and toward attaining post-\nconventional morality (once formal operational thought is attained), which only a\nfew fully achieve. Kohlberg placed in the highest stage responses that reflected\nthe reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug because his wife\u2019s life is more\nimportant than the pharmacist making money. The value of a human life\noverrides the pharmacist\u2019s greed. Kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional,\nconventional, and post-conventional: Each level is associated with increasingly\ncomplex stages of moral development.\nIt is important to realize that even those people who have the most sophisticated,\npost-conventional reasons for some choices may make other choices for the\nsimplest of pre-conventional reasons. Many psychologists agree with Kohlberg's\ntheory of moral development but point out that moral reasoning is very different\nfrom moral behavior. Sometimes what we say we would do in a situation is not\nwhat we actually do in that situation. In other words, we might \u201ctalk the talk,\u201d but\nnot \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d How does this theory apply to males and females? Kohlberg (1969) felt that more\nmales than females move past stage four in their moral development. He went on\nto note that women seem to be deficient in their moral reasoning abilities. These\nideas were not well received by Carol Gilligan, a research assistant of Kohlberg,\nwho consequently developed her own ideas of moral development. In her\ngroundbreaking book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and\nWomen\u2019s Development, Gilligan (1982) criticized her former mentor\u2019s theory\nbecause it was based only on upper class White men and boys. She argued that\nwomen are not deficient in their moral reasoning\u2014she proposed that males and\nfemales reason differently. Girls and women focus more on staying connected\nand the importance of interpersonal relationships. Therefore, in the Heinz\ndilemma, many girls and women respond that Heinz should not steal the\nmedicine. Their reasoning is that if he steals the medicine, is arrested, and is put\nin jail, then he and his wife will be separated, and she could die while he is still in\nprison.\nSummary\nThere are many theories regarding how babies and children grow\nand develop into happy, healthy adults. Sigmund Freud suggested that we pass\nthrough a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused on certain\nerogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud\u2019s ideas and suggested a\ntheory of psychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and\nsuccessful completion of social tasks shape our sense of self. Jean Piaget\nproposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children think and\nreason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned\nhis attention to moral development. He said that we pass through three levels of\nmoral thinking that build on our cognitive development.\nGlossary\nassimilation\nadjustment of a schema by adding information similar to what is already\nknown\naccommodation adjustment of a schema by changing a scheme to accommodate new\ninformation different from what was already known\nconcrete operational stage\nthird stage in Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development; from about 7 to 11\nyears old, children can think logically about real (concrete) events\nconservation\nidea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is still equal in\nsize, volume, or number as long as nothing is added or removed\negocentrism\npreoperational child\u2019s difficulty in taking the perspective of others\nformal operational stage\nfinal stage in Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development; from age 11 and up,\nchildren are able to deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations\nobject permanence\nidea that even if something is out of sight, it still exists\npreoperational stage\nsecond stage in Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development; from ages 2 to 7,\nchildren learn to use symbols and language but do not understand mental\noperations and often think illogically\npsychosexual development\nprocess proposed by Freud in which pleasure-seeking urges focus on\ndifferent erogenous zones of the body as humans move through\nfive stages of life\npsychosocial development process proposed by Erikson in which social tasks are mastered as humans\nmove through eight stages of life from infancy to adulthood\nreversibility\nprinciple that objects can be changed, but then returned back to their\noriginal form or condition\nschema\n(plural = schemata) concept (mental model) that is used to help us\ncategorize and interpret information\nsensorimotor stage\nfirst stage in Piaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development; from birth through\nage 2, a child learns about the world through senses and motor behavior\nstage of moral reasoning\nprocess proposed by Kohlberg; humans move through three stages of\nmoral development\nThis work is licensed by Rice University under a Creative Commons Attribution License (by 4.0).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/4abf04bf-93a0-45c3-9cbc-2cefd46e68cc@8.1. Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 3 \u2013 Culture, Personality Development and Socialization Process\n3.1 Social and Personality Development in Childhood\nBy Ross Thompson\nUniversity of California, Davis\nChildhood social and personality development emerges through the interaction of\nsocial influences, biological maturation, and the child\u2019s representations of the\nsocial world and the self. This interaction is illustrated in a discussion of the\ninfluence of significant relationships, the development of social understanding,\nthe growth of personality, and the development of social and emotional\ncompetence in childhood.\nLearning Objectives\n\uf0b7 Provide specific examples of how the interaction of social experience,\nbiological maturation, and the child\u2019s representations of experience and the\nself provide the basis for growth in social and personality development.\n\uf0b7 Describe the significant contributions of parent\u2013child and peer\nrelationships to the development of social skills and personality in\nchildhood.\n\uf0b7 Explain how achievements in social understanding occur in childhood.\nMoreover, do scientists believe that infants and young children are\negocentric?\n\uf0b7 Describe the association of temperament with personality development.\n\uf0b7 Explain what is \u201csocial and emotional competence\u201c and provide some\nexamples of how it develops in childhood.\nIntroduction\n\u201cHow have I become the kind of person I am today?\u201d Every adult ponders this\nquestion from time to time. The answers that readily come to mind include the influences of parents, peers, temperament, a moral compass, a strong sense of\nself, and sometimes critical life experiences such as parental divorce. Social and\npersonality development encompasses these and many other influences on the\ngrowth of the person. In addition, it addresses questions that are at the heart of\nunderstanding how we develop as unique people. How much are we products of\nnature or nurture? How enduring are the influences of early experiences? The\nstudy of social and personality development offers perspective on these and\nother issues, often by showing how complex and multifaceted are the influences\non developing children, and thus the intricate processes that have made you the\nperson you are today (Thompson, 2006a).\nHumans are inherently social creatures. Mostly, we work, play, and live together\nin groups. [Image: The Daring Librarian, https://goo.gl/LmA2pS, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nUnderstanding social and personality development requires looking at children\nfrom three perspectives that interact to shape development. The first is the social\ncontext in which each child lives, especially the relationships that provide security, guidance, and knowledge. The second is biological maturation that supports\ndeveloping social and emotional competencies and underlies temperamental\nindividuality. The third is children\u2019s developing representations of themselves and\nthe social world. Social and personality development is best understood as the\ncontinuous interaction between these social, biological, and representational\naspects of psychological development.\nRelationships\nThis interaction can be observed in the development of the earliest relationships\nbetween infants and their parents in the first year. Virtually all infants living in\nnormal circumstances develop strong emotional attachments to those who care\nfor them. Psychologists believe that the development of these attachments is as\nbiologically natural as learning to walk and not simply a byproduct of the parents\u2019\nprovision of food or warmth. Rather, attachments have evolved in humans\nbecause they promote children\u2019s motivation to stay close to those who care for\nthem and, as a consequence, to benefit from the learning, security, guidance,\nwarmth, and affirmation that close relationships provide (Cassidy, 2008). One of the first and most important relationships is between mothers and infants.\nThe quality of this relationship has an effect on later psychological and social\ndevelopment. [Image: Premnath Thirumalaisamy, https://goo.gl/66BROf, CC BY-\nNC 2.0, https://goo.gl/FIlc2e]\nAlthough nearly all infants develop emotional attachments to their caregivers--\nparents, relatives, nannies-- their sense of security in those attachments varies.\nInfants become securely attached when their parents respond sensitively to them,\nreinforcing the infants\u2019 confidence that their parents will provide support when\nneeded. Infants become insecurely attached when care is inconsistent or\nneglectful; these infants tend to respond avoidantly, resistantly, or in a\ndisorganized manner (Belsky & Pasco Fearon, 2008). Such insecure attachments\nare not necessarily the result of deliberately bad parenting but are often a\nbyproduct of circumstances. For example, an overworked single mother may find\nherself overstressed and fatigued at the end of the day, making fully-involved\nchildcare very difficult. In other cases, some parents are simply poorly\nemotionally equipped to take on the responsibility of caring for a child.\nThe different behaviors of securely- and insecurely-attached infants can be\nobserved especially when the infant needs the caregiver\u2019s support. To assess the\nnature of attachment, researchers use a standard laboratory procedure called the\n\u201cStrange Situation,\u201d which involves brief separations from the caregiver (e.g.,\nmother) (Solomon & George, 2008). In the Strange Situation, the caregiver is\ninstructed to leave the child to play alone in a room for a short time, then return\nand greet the child while researchers observe the child\u2019s response. Depending on\nthe child\u2019s level of attachment, he or she may reject the parent, cling to the\nparent, or simply welcome the parent\u2014or, in some instances, react with an\nagitated combination of responses.\nInfants can be securely or insecurely attached with mothers, fathers, and other\nregular caregivers, and they can differ in their security with different people.\nThe security of attachment is an important cornerstone of social and personality\ndevelopment, because infants and young children who are securely attached have\nbeen found to develop stronger friendships with peers, more advanced emotional\nunderstanding and early conscience development, and more positive self-\nconcepts, compared with insecurely attached children (Thompson, 2008). This is\nconsistent with attachment theory\u2019s premise that experiences of care, resulting in secure or insecure attachments, shape young children\u2019s developing concepts of\nthe self, as well as what people are like, and how to interact with them.\nAs children mature, parent-child relationships naturally change. Preschool and\ngrade-school children are more capable, have their own preferences, and\nsometimes refuse or seek to compromise with parental expectations. This can\nlead to greater parent-child conflict, and how conflict is managed by parents\nfurther shapes the quality of parent-child relationships. In general, children\ndevelop greater competence and self-confidence when parents have high (but\nreasonable) expectations for children\u2019s behavior, communicate well with them,\nare warm and responsive, and use reasoning (rather than coercion) as preferred\nresponses to children\u2019s misbehavior. This kind of parenting style has been\ndescribed as authoritative (Baumrind, 2013). Authoritative parents are supportive\nand show interest in their kids\u2019 activities but are not overbearing and allow them\nto make constructive mistakes. By contrast, some less-constructive parent-child\nrelationships result from authoritarian, uninvolved, or permissive parenting styles\n(see Table 1).\nTable 1: Comparison of Four Parenting Styles\nParental roles in relation to their children change in other ways, too. Parents\nincreasingly become mediators (or gatekeepers) of their children\u2019s involvement\nwith peers and activities outside the family. Their communication and practice of\nvalues contributes to children\u2019s academic achievement, moral development, and activity preferences. As children reach adolescence, the parent-child relationship\nincreasingly becomes one of \u201ccoregulation,\u201d in which both the parent(s) and the\nchild recognizes the child\u2019s growing competence and autonomy, and together\nthey rebalance authority relations. We often see evidence of this as parents start\naccommodating their teenage kids\u2019 sense of independence by allowing them to\nget cars, jobs, attend parties, and stay out later.\nFamily relationships are significantly affected by conditions outside the home. For\ninstance, the Family Stress Model describes how financial difficulties are\nassociated with parents\u2019 depressed moods, which in turn lead to marital problems\nand poor parenting that contributes to poorer child adjustment (Conger, Conger,\n& Martin, 2010). Within the home, parental marital difficulty or divorce affects\nmore than half the children growing up today in the United States. Divorce is\ntypically associated with economic stresses for children and parents, the\nrenegotiation of parent-child relationships (with one parent typically as primary\ncustodian and the other assuming a visiting relationship), and many other\nsignificant adjustments for children. Divorce is often regarded by children as a sad\nturning point in their lives, although for most it is not associated with long-term\nproblems of adjustment (Emery, 1999).\nPeer Relationships Peer relationships are particularly important for children. They can be supportive\nbut also challenging. Peer rejection may lead to behavioral problems later in life.\n[Image: Twentyfour Students, https://goo.gl/3IS2gV, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/jSSrcO]\nParent-child relationships are not the only significant relationships in a child\u2019s life.\nPeer relationships are also important. Social interaction with another child who is\nsimilar in age, skills, and knowledge provokes the development of many social\nskills that are valuable for the rest of life (Bukowski, Buhrmester, & Underwood,\n2011). In peer relationships, children learn how to initiate and maintain social\ninteractions with other children. They learn skills for managing conflict, such as\nturn-taking, compromise, and bargaining. Play also involves the mutual,\nsometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions, and understanding. For\nexample, as infants, children get their first encounter with sharing (of each other\u2019s\ntoys); during pretend play as preschoolers they create narratives together, choose\nroles, and collaborate to act out their stories; and in primary school, they may join\na sports team, learning to work together and support each other emotionally and\nstrategically toward a common goal. Through these experiences, children develop\nfriendships that provide additional sources of security and support to those\nprovided by their parents.\nHowever, peer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive (Rubin,\nCoplan, Chen, Bowker, & McDonald, 2011). Being accepted by other children is an\nimportant source of affirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can\nforeshadow later behavior problems (especially when children are rejected due to\naggressive behavior). With increasing age, children confront the challenges of\nbullying, peer victimization, and managing conformity pressures. Social\ncomparison with peers is an important means by which children evaluate their\nskills, knowledge, and personal qualities, but it may cause them to feel that they\ndo not measure up well against others. For example, a boy who is not athletic\nmay feel unworthy of his football-playing peers and revert to shy behavior,\nisolating himself and avoiding conversation. Conversely, an athlete who doesn\u2019t\n\u201cget\u201d Shakespeare may feel embarrassed and avoid reading altogether. Also, with\nthe approach of adolescence, peer relationships become focused on psychological\nintimacy, involving personal disclosure, vulnerability, and loyalty (or its\nbetrayal)\u2014which significantly affects a child\u2019s outlook on the world. Each of these\naspects of peer relationships requires developing very different social and emotional skills than those that emerge in parent-child relationships. They also\nillustrate the many ways that peer relationships influence the growth of\npersonality and self-concept.\nSocial Understanding\nAs we have seen, children\u2019s experience of relationships at home and the peer\ngroup contributes to an expanding repertoire of social and emotional skills and\nalso to broadened social understanding. In these relationships, children develop\nexpectations for specific people (leading, for example, to secure or insecure\nattachments to parents), understanding of how to interact with adults and peers,\nand developing self-concept based on how others respond to them. These\nrelationships are also significant forums for emotional development.\nRemarkably, young children begin developing social understanding very early in\nlife. Before the end of the first year, infants are aware that other people have\nperceptions, feelings, and other mental states that affect their behavior, and\nwhich are different from the child\u2019s own mental states. This can be readily\nobserved in a process called social referencing, in which an infant looks to the\nmother\u2019s face when confronted with an unfamiliar person or situation (Feinman,\n1992). If the mother looks calm and reassuring, the infant responds positively as if\nthe situation is safe. If the mother looks fearful or distressed, the infant is likely to\nrespond with wariness or distress because the mother\u2019s expression signals\ndanger. In a remarkably insightful manner, therefore, infants show an awareness\nthat even though they are uncertain about the unfamiliar situation, their mother\nis not, and that by \u201creading\u201d the emotion in her face, infants can learn about\nwhether the circumstance is safe or dangerous, and how to respond.\nAlthough developmental scientists used to believe that infants are egocentric\u2014\nthat is, focused on their own perceptions and experience\u2014they now realize that\nthe opposite is true. Infants are aware at an early stage that people have different\nmental states, and this motivates them to try to figure out what others are\nfeeling, intending, wanting, and thinking, and how these mental states affect their\nbehavior. They are beginning, in other words, to develop a theory of mind, and\nalthough their understanding of mental states begins very simply, it rapidly\nexpands (Wellman, 2011). For example, if an 18-month-old watches an adult try\nrepeatedly to drop a necklace into a cup but inexplicably fail each time, they will\nimmediately put the necklace into the cup themselves\u2014thus completing what the adult intended, but failed, to do. In doing so, they reveal their awareness of the\nintentions underlying the adult\u2019s behavior (Meltzoff, 1995). Carefully designed\nexperimental studies show that by late in the preschool years, young children\nunderstand that another\u2019s beliefs can be mistaken rather than correct, that\nmemories can affect how you feel, and that one\u2019s emotions can be hidden from\nothers (Wellman, 2011). Social understanding grows significantly as children\u2019s\ntheory of mind develops.\nHow do these achievements in social understanding occur? One answer is that\nyoung children are remarkably sensitive observers of other people, making\nconnections between their emotional expressions, words, and behavior to derive\nsimple inferences about mental states (e.g., concluding, for example, that what\nMommy is looking at is in her mind) (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2001). This is\nespecially likely to occur in relationships with people whom the child knows well,\nconsistent with the ideas of attachment theory discussed above. Growing\nlanguage skills give young children words with which to represent these mental\nstates (e.g., \u201cmad,\u201d \u201cwants\u201d) and talk about them with others. Thus in\nconversation with their parents about everyday experiences, children learn much\nabout people\u2019s mental states from how adults talk about them (\u201cYour sister was\nsad because she thought Daddy was coming home.\u201d) (Thompson, 2006b).\nDeveloping social understanding is, in other words, based on children\u2019s everyday\ninteractions with others and their careful interpretations of what they see and\nhear. There are also some scientists who believe that infants are biologically\nprepared to perceive people in a special way, as organisms with an internal\nmental life, and this facilitates their interpretation of people\u2019s behavior with\nreference to those mental states (Leslie, 1994). Personality\nAlthough a child's temperament is partly determined by genetics, environmental\ninfluences also contribute to shaping personality. Positive personality\ndevelopment is supported by a \"good fit\" between a child's natural temperament,\nenvironment and experiences. [Image: Thomas Hawk, https://goo.gl/2So40O, CC\nBY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/FIlc2e]\nParents look into the faces of their newborn infants and wonder, \u201cWhat kind of\nperson will this child will become?\u201d They scrutinize their baby\u2019s preferences,\ncharacteristics, and responses for clues of a developing personality. They are\nquite right to do so, because temperament is a foundation for personality growth.\nBut temperament (defined as early-emerging differences in reactivity and self-\nregulation) is not the whole story. Although temperament is biologically based, it\ninteracts with the influence of experience from the moment of birth (if not\nbefore) to shape personality (Rothbart, 2011). Temperamental dispositions are\naffected, for example, by the support level of parental care. More generally, personality is shaped by the goodness of fit between the child\u2019s temperamental\nqualities and characteristics of the environment (Chess & Thomas, 1999). For\nexample, an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her on weekend\nhiking and fishing trips would be a good \u201cfit\u201d to her lifestyle, supporting\npersonality growth. Personality is the result, therefore, of the continuous\ninterplay between biological disposition and experience, as is true for many other\naspects of social and personality development.\nPersonality develops from temperament in other ways (Thompson, Winer, &\nGoodvin, 2010). As children mature biologically, temperamental characteristics\nemerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-control, but\nas brain-based capacities for self-control advance, temperamental changes in self-\nregulation become more apparent. For example, a newborn who cries frequently\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily have a grumpy personality; over time, with sufficient parental\nsupport and increased sense of security, the child might be less likely to cry.\nIn addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament.\nChildren\u2019s developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize,\ntheir values and goals, their coping styles, their sense of responsibility and\nconscientiousness, and many other qualities are encompassed into personality.\nThese qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even more by the\nchild\u2019s experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the\ngrowth of individual characteristics.\nIndeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations of\ntemperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over\ntime. The newborn that parents gazed upon thus becomes an adult with a\npersonality of depth and nuance.\nSocial and Emotional Competence\nSocial and personality development is built from the social, biological, and\nrepresentational influences discussed above. These influences result in important\ndevelopmental outcomes that matter to children, parents, and society: a young\nadult\u2019s capacity to engage in socially constructive actions (helping, caring, sharing\nwith others), to curb hostile or aggressive impulses, to live according to\nmeaningful moral values, to develop a healthy identity and sense of self, and to develop talents and achieve success in using them. These are some of the\ndevelopmental outcomes that denote social and emotional competence.\nThese achievements of social and personality development derive from the\ninteraction of many social, biological, and representational influences. Consider,\nfor example, the development of conscience, which is an early foundation for\nmoral development. Conscience consists of the cognitive, emotional, and social\ninfluences that cause young children to create and act consistently with internal\nstandards of conduct (Kochanska, 2002). Conscience emerges from young\nchildren\u2019s experiences with parents, particularly in the development of a mutually\nresponsive relationship that motivates young children to respond constructively\nto the parents\u2019 requests and expectations. Biologically based temperament is\ninvolved, as some children are temperamentally more capable of motivated self-\nregulation (a quality called effortful control) than are others, while some children\nare dispositionally more prone to the fear and anxiety that parental disapproval\ncan evoke. Conscience development grows through a good fit between the child\u2019s\ntemperamental qualities and how parents communicate and reinforce behavioral\nexpectations. Moreover, as an illustration of the interaction of genes and\nexperience, one research group found that young children with a particular gene\nallele (the 5-HTTLPR) were low on measures of conscience development when\nthey had previously experienced unresponsive maternal care, but children with\nthe same allele growing up with responsive care showed strong later performance\non conscience measures (Kochanska, Kim, Barry, & Philibert, 2011).\nConscience development also expands as young children begin to represent moral\nvalues and think of themselves as moral beings. By the end of the preschool\nyears, for example, young children develop a \u201cmoral self\u201d by which they think of\nthemselves as people who want to do the right thing, who feel badly after\nmisbehaving, and who feel uncomfortable when others misbehave. In the\ndevelopment of conscience, young children become more socially and\nemotionally competent in a manner that provides a foundation for later moral\nconduct (Thompson, 2012). Social influences such as cultural norms impact children's interests, dress, style of\nspeech and even life aspirations. [Image: Amanda Westmont,\nhttps://goo.gl/ntS5qx, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nThe development of gender and gender identity is likewise an interaction among\nsocial, biological, and representational influences (Ruble, Martin, & Berenbaum,\n2006). Young children learn about gender from parents, peers, and others in\nsociety, and develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with\nmaleness or femaleness (called gender schemas). They also negotiate biological transitions (such as puberty) that cause their sense of themselves and their sexual\nidentity to mature.\nEach of these examples of the growth of social and emotional competence\nillustrates not only the interaction of social, biological, and representational\ninfluences, but also how their development unfolds over an extended period.\nEarly influences are important, but not determinative, because the capabilities\nrequired for mature moral conduct, gender identity, and other outcomes\ncontinue to develop throughout childhood, adolescence, and even the adult\nyears.\nConclusion\nAs the preceding sentence suggests, social and personality development\ncontinues through adolescence and the adult years, and it is influenced by the\nsame constellation of social, biological, and representational influences discussed\nfor childhood. Changing social relationships and roles, biological maturation and\n(much later) decline, and how the individual represents experience and the self\ncontinue to form the bases for development throughout life.

Diener (Eds), Noba\ntextbook series: Psychology. Champaign, IL: DEF publishers. DOI:nobaproject.com 3.2 Cultural Understandings of Personality\nPage by: OpenStax\nPersonality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The culture in\nwhich you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes\nyour personality (Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the\nbeliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular society. Culture is transmitted\nto people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally\nacceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished\n(Triandis & Suh, 2002). With these ideas in mind, personality psychologists have\nbecome interested in the role of culture in understanding personality. They ask\nwhether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations.\nIt appears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account\nfor variation in people\u2019s personalities.\nWhy might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality?\nWestern ideas about personality may not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-\nMartinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the strength of personality\ntraits varies across cultures. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Big Five factors\n(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As\nyou will learn when you study social psychology, Asian cultures are more\ncollectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less extroverted. People in\nCentral and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to\nexperience, whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez &\nKarakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).\nAccording to this study, there also seem to be regional personality differences\nwithin the United States (Figure). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5\nmillion individuals in the United States and found that there are three distinct\nregional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the Upper Midwest and Deep\nSouth, is dominated by people who fall into the \u201cfriendly and conventional\u201d\npersonality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are\nmore relaxed, emotionally stable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which\nincludes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed, irritable, and\ndepressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open\n(Rentfrow et al., 2013). Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States.\nPeople tend to be friendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep\nSouth; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the West; and stressed,\nirritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).\nOne explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et\nal., 2013). Selective migration is the concept that people choose to move to\nplaces that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For example, a\nperson high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and\nfriends, and would choose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast,\nsomeone high on openness would prefer to settle in a place that is recognized\nas diverse and innovative (such as California). PERSONALITY IN INDIVIDUALIST AND COLLECTIVIST CULTURES\nIndividualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic\nvalues. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that\nindependence, competition, and personal achievement are important. Individuals\nin Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on\nindividualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in\ncollectivist cultures value social harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over\nindividual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia, Africa, and South\nAmerica score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values\ninfluence personality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist\ncultures displayed more personally oriented personality traits, whereas people in\ncollectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality traits.\nAPPROACHES TO STUDYING PERSONALITY IN A CULTURAL CONTEXT\nThere are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural\ncontext, the cultural-comparative approach; the indigenous approach; and\nthe combined approach, which incorporates elements of both views. Since ideas\nabout personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks\nto test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether\nthey can be generalized and if they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, &\nLeong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section on the trait\nperspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the\nuniversality of McCrae and Costa\u2019s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in\nnumerous cultures around the world, with the Big Five traits being stable in many\ncultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous approach\ncame about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of\npersonality in non-Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-\nbased personality assessments cannot fully capture the personality constructs of\nother cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality\nassessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture\nbeing studied (Cheung et al., 2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of\npersonality is the combined approach, which serves as a bridge between Western\nand indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural\nvariations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011). Summary\nThe culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors\nthat shapes your personality. Western ideas about personality may not be\napplicable to other cultures. In fact, there is evidence that the strength of\npersonality traits varies across cultures. Individualist cultures and collectivist\ncultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in individualist\ncultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal\nachievement are important. People who live in collectivist cultures value social\nharmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. There are three\napproaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context: the\ncultural-comparative approach, the indigenous approach, and the combined\napproach, which incorporates both elements of both views.\nGlossary\nculture\nall of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular society\nselective migration\nconcept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with\ntheir personalities and needs\nThis work is licensed by Rice University under a Creative Commons Attribution License (by 4.0). 3.3 Introduction to Socialization\nDerived from Introduction to Socialization by OpenStax\nSocialization is the way we learn the norms and beliefs of our society. From our\nearliest family and play experiences, we are made aware of societal values and\nexpectations. (Photo courtesy of woodleywonderworks/flickr)\nIn the summer of 2005, police detective Mark Holste followed an investigator\nfrom the Department of Children and Families to a home in Plant City, Florida.\nThey were there to look into a statement from the neighbor concerning a shabby\nhouse on Old Sydney Road. A small girl was reported peering from one of its\nbroken windows. This seemed odd because no one in the neighborhood had seen\na young child in or around the home, which had been inhabited for the past three\nyears by a woman, her boyfriend, and two adult sons.\nWho was the mystery girl in the window?\nEntering the house, Detective Holste and his team were shocked. It was the worst\nmess they\u2019d ever seen, infested with cockroaches, smeared with feces and urine\nfrom both people and pets, and filled with dilapidated furniture and ragged\nwindow coverings. Detective Holste headed down a hallway and entered a small room. That\u2019s where\nhe found the little girl, with big, vacant eyes, staring into the darkness. A\nnewspaper report later described the detective\u2019s first encounter with the child:\n\u201cShe lay on a torn, moldy mattress on the floor. She was curled on her side . . . her\nribs and collarbone jutted out . . . her black hair was matted, crawling with lice.\nInsect bites, rashes and sores pocked her skin . . . She was naked\u2014except for a\nswollen diaper. \u2026 Her name, her mother said, was Danielle. She was almost seven\nyears old\u201d (DeGregory 2008).\nDetective Holste immediately carried Danielle out of the home. She was taken to\na hospital for medical treatment and evaluation. Through extensive testing,\ndoctors determined that, although she was severely malnourished, Danielle was\nable to see, hear, and vocalize normally. Still, she wouldn\u2019t look anyone in the\neyes, didn\u2019t know how to chew or swallow solid food, didn\u2019t cry, didn\u2019t respond to\nstimuli that would typically cause pain, and didn\u2019t know how to communicate\neither with words or simple gestures such as nodding \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Likewise,\nalthough tests showed she had no chronic diseases or genetic abnormalities, the\nonly way she could stand was with someone holding onto her hands, and she\n\u201cwalked sideways on her toes, like a crab\u201d (DeGregory 2008).\nWhat had happened to Danielle? Put simply: beyond the basic requirements for\nsurvival, she had been neglected. Based on their investigation, social workers\nconcluded that she had been left almost entirely alone in rooms like the one\nwhere she was found. Without regular interaction\u2014the holding, hugging, talking,\nthe explanations and demonstrations given to most young children\u2014she had not\nlearned to walk or to speak, to eat or to interact, to play or even to understand\nthe world around her. From a sociological point of view, Danielle had not been\nsocialized.\nSocialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient\nmembers of a society. It describes the ways that people come to understand\nsocietal norms and expectations, to accept society\u2019s beliefs, and to be aware of\nsocietal values. Socialization is not the same as socializing (interacting with\nothers, like family, friends, and coworkers); to be precise, it is a sociological\nprocess that occurs through socializing. As Danielle\u2019s story illustrates, even the\nmost basic of human activities are learned. You may be surprised to know that\neven physical tasks like sitting, standing, and walking had not automatically\ndeveloped for Danielle as she grew. And without socialization, Danielle hadn\u2019t learned about the material culture of her society (the tangible objects a culture\nuses): for example, she couldn\u2019t hold a spoon, bounce a ball, or use a chair for\nsitting. She also hadn\u2019t learned its nonmaterial culture, such as its beliefs, values,\nand norms. She had no understanding of the concept of \u201cfamily,\u201d didn\u2019t know\ncultural expectations for using a bathroom for elimination, and had no sense of\nmodesty. Most importantly, she hadn\u2019t learned to use the symbols that make up\nlanguage\u2014through which we learn about who we are, how we fit with other\npeople, and the natural and social worlds in which we live.\nSociologists have long been fascinated by circumstances like Danielle\u2019s\u2014in which\na child receives sufficient human support to survive, but virtually no social\ninteraction\u2014because they highlight how much we depend on social interaction to\nprovide the information and skills that we need to be part of society or even to\ndevelop a \u201cself.\u201d\nThe necessity for early social contact was demonstrated by the research of Harry\nand Margaret Harlow. From 1957 to 1963, the Harlows conducted a series of\nexperiments studying how rhesus monkeys, which behave a lot like people, are\naffected by isolation as babies. They studied monkeys raised under two types of\n\u201csubstitute\u201d mothering circumstances: a mesh and wire sculpture, or a soft\nterrycloth \u201cmother.\u201d The monkeys systematically preferred the company of a soft,\nterrycloth substitute mother (closely resembling a rhesus monkey) that was\nunable to feed them, to a mesh and wire mother that provided sustenance via a\nfeeding tube. This demonstrated that while food was important, social comfort\nwas of greater value (Harlow and Harlow 1962; Harlow 1971). Later experiments\ntesting more severe isolation revealed that such deprivation of social contact led\nto significant developmental and social challenges later in life. Baby rhesus monkeys, like humans, need to be raised with social contact for\nhealthy development.

We will explore how socialization is not only\ncritical to children as they develop but how it is also a lifelong process through\nwhich we become prepared for new social environments and expectations in\nevery stage of our lives. But first, we will turn to scholarship about self-\ndevelopment, the process of coming to recognize a sense of self, a \u201cself\u201d that is\nthen able to be socialized.\nGlossary\nsocialization\nthe process wherein people come to understand societal norms and\nexpectations, to accept society\u2019s beliefs, and to be aware of societal values References\nDeGregory, Lane. 2008. \u201cThe Girl in the Window.\u201d St. Petersburg Times, July 31.

However,\nwho we are as human beings develops through social interaction. Many scholars,\nboth in the fields of psychology and in sociology, have described the process of\nself-development as a precursor to understanding how that \u201cself\u201d becomes\nsocialized.\nPsychological Perspectives on Self-Development\nPsychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) was one of the most influential\nmodern scientists to put forth a theory about how people develop a sense of self.\nHe believed that personality and sexual development were closely linked, and he\ndivided the maturation process into psychosexual stages: oral, anal, phallic,\nlatency, and genital. He posited that people\u2019s self-development is closely linked to\nearly stages of development, like breastfeeding, toilet training, and sexual\nawareness (Freud 1905).\nAccording to Freud, failure to properly engage in or disengage from a specific\nstage results in emotional and psychological consequences throughout adulthood.\nAn adult with an oral fixation may indulge in overeating or binge drinking. An anal\nfixation may produce a neat freak (hence the term \u201canal retentive\u201d), while a\nperson stuck in the phallic stage may be promiscuous or emotionally immature.\nAlthough no solid empirical evidence supports Freud\u2019s theory, his ideas continue\nto contribute to the work of scholars in a variety of disciplines.\nSOCIOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGY: WHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE?\nYou might be wondering: if sociologists and psychologists are both interested in\npeople and their behavior, how are these two disciplines different? What do they\nagree on, and where do their ideas diverge? The answers are complicated, but the\ndistinction is important to scholars in both fields.\nAs a general difference, we might say that while both disciplines are interested in\nhuman behavior, psychologists are focused on how the mind influences that\nbehavior, while sociologists study the role of society in shaping behavior. Psychologists are interested in people\u2019s mental development and how their minds\nprocess their world. Sociologists are more likely to focus on how different aspects\nof society contribute to an individual\u2019s relationship with his world. Another way to\nthink of the difference is that psychologists tend to look inward (mental health,\nemotional processes), while sociologists tend to look outward (social institutions,\ncultural norms, interactions with others) to understand human behavior.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917) was the first to make this distinction in research,\nwhen he attributed differences in suicide rates among people to social causes\n(religious differences) rather than to psychological causes (like their mental\nwellbeing) (Durkheim 1897). Today, we see this same distinction. For example, a\nsociologist studying how a couple gets to the point of their first kiss on a date\nmight focus her research on cultural norms for dating, social patterns of sexual\nactivity over time, or how this process is different for seniors than for teens. A\npsychologist would more likely be interested in the person\u2019s earliest sexual\nawareness or the mental processing of sexual desire.\nSometimes sociologists and psychologists have collaborated to increase\nknowledge. In recent decades, however, their fields have become more clearly\nseparated as sociologists increasingly focus on large societal issues and patterns,\nwhile psychologists remain honed in on the human mind. Both disciplines make\nvaluable contributions through different approaches that provide us with\ndifferent types of useful insights.\nPsychologist Erik Erikson (1902\u20131994) created a theory of personality\ndevelopment based, in part, on the work of Freud. However, Erikson believed the\npersonality continued to change over time and was never truly finished. His\ntheory includes eight stages of development, beginning with birth and ending\nwith death. According to Erikson, people move through these stages throughout\ntheir lives. In contrast to Freud\u2019s focus on psychosexual stages and basic human\nurges, Erikson\u2019s view of self-development gave credit to more social aspects, like\nthe way we negotiate between our own base desires and what is socially\naccepted (Erikson 1982).\nJean Piaget (1896\u20131980) was a psychologist who specialized in child development\nwho focused specifically on the role of social interactions in their development. He recognized that the development of self evolved through a negotiation\nbetween the world as it exists in one\u2019s mind and the world that exists as it is\nexperienced socially (Piaget 1954). All three of these thinkers have contributed to\nour modern understanding of self-development.\nSociological Theories of Self-Development\nOne of the pioneering contributors to sociological perspectives was Charles\nCooley (1864\u20131929). He asserted that people\u2019s self understanding is constructed,\nin part, by their perception of how others view them\u2014a process termed \u201cthe\nlooking glass self\u201d (Cooley 1902).\nLater, George Herbert Mead (1863\u20131931) studied the self, a person\u2019s distinct\nidentity that is developed through social interaction. In order to engage in this\nprocess of \u201cself,\u201d an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the\neyes of others. That\u2019s not an ability that we are born with (Mead 1934). Through\nsocialization we learn to put ourselves in someone else's shoes and look at the\nworld through their perspective. This assists us in becoming self-aware, as we\nlook at ourselves from the perspective of the \"other.\" The case of Danielle, for\nexample, illustrates what happens when social interaction is absent from early\nexperience: Danielle had no ability to see herself as others would see her. From\nMead\u2019s point of view, she had no \u201cself.\u201d\nHow do we go from being newborns to being humans with \u201cselves?\u201d Mead\nbelieved that there is a specific path of development that all people go through.\nDuring the preparatory stage, children are only capable of imitation: they have no\nability to imagine how others see things. They copy the actions of people with\nwhom they regularly interact, such as their mothers and fathers. This is followed\nby the play stage, during which children begin to take on the role that one other\nperson might have. Thus, children might try on a parent\u2019s point of view by acting\nout \u201cgrownup\u201d behavior, like playing \u201cdress up\u201d and acting out the \u201cmom\u201d role, or\ntalking on a toy telephone the way they see their father do.\nDuring the game stage, children learn to consider several roles at the same time\nand how those roles interact with each other. They learn to understand\ninteractions involving different people with a variety of purposes. For example, a\nchild at this stage is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of people in\na restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience (someone seats you, another takes your order, someone else cooks the food, while yet another\nclears away dirty dishes).\nFinally, children develop, understand, and learn the idea of the generalized other,\nthe common behavioral expectations of general society. By this stage of\ndevelopment, an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or\nmany others\u2014and thus, from a sociological perspective, to have a \u201cself\u201d (Mead\n1934; Mead 1964).\nKohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development\nMoral development is an important part of the socialization process. The term\nrefers to the way people learn what society considered to be \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d\nwhich is important for a smoothly functioning society. Moral development\nprevents people from acting on unchecked urges, instead considering what is\nright for society and good for others. Lawrence Kohlberg (1927\u20131987) was\ninterested in how people learn to decide what is right and what is wrong. To\nunderstand this topic, he developed a theory of moral development that includes\nthree levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional.\nIn the preconventional stage, young children, who lack a higher level of cognitive\nability, experience the world around them only through their senses. It isn\u2019t until\nthe teen years that the conventional theory develops, when youngsters become\nincreasingly aware of others\u2019 feelings and take those into consideration when\ndetermining what\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d The final stage, called postconventional, is\nwhen people begin to think of morality in abstract terms, such as Americans\nbelieving that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nAt this stage, people also recognize that legality and morality do not always match\nup evenly (Kohlberg 1981). When hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned out\nin 2011 to protest government corruption, they were using postconventional\nmorality. They understood that although their government was legal, it was not\nmorally correct.\nGilligan\u2019s Theory of Moral Development and Gender\nAnother sociologist, Carol Gilligan (1936\u2013), recognized that Kohlberg\u2019s theory\nmight show gender bias since his research was only conducted on male subjects.\nWould females study subjects have responded differently? Would a female social scientist notice different patterns when analyzing the research? To answer the\nfirst question, she set out to study differences between how boys and girls\ndeveloped morality. Gilligan\u2019s research demonstrated that boys and girls do, in\nfact, have different understandings of morality. Boys tend to have a justice\nperspective, by placing emphasis on rules and laws. Girls, on the other hand, have\na care and responsibility perspective; they consider people\u2019s reasons behind\nbehavior that seems morally wrong.\nGilligan also recognized that Kohlberg\u2019s theory rested on the assumption that the\njustice perspective was the right, or better, perspective. Gilligan, in contrast,\ntheorized that neither perspective was \u201cbetter\u201d: the two norms of justice served\ndifferent purposes. Ultimately, she explained that boys are socialized for a work\nenvironment where rules make operations run smoothly, while girls are socialized\nfor a home environment where flexibility allows for harmony in caretaking and\nnurturing (Gilligan 1982; Gilligan 1990).\nWHAT A PRETTY LITTLE LADY!\n\u201cWhat a cute dress!\u201d \u201cI like the ribbons in your hair.\u201d \u201cWow, you look so pretty\ntoday.\u201d\nAccording to Lisa Bloom, author of Think: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart\nin a Dumbed Down World, most of us use pleasantries like these when we first\nmeet little girls. \u201cSo what?\u201d you might ask.\nBloom asserts that we are too focused on the appearance of young girls, and as a\nresult, our society is socializing them to believe that how they look is of vital\nimportance. And Bloom may be on to something. How often do you tell a little\nboy how attractive his outfit is, how nice looking his shoes are, or how handsome\nhe looks today? To support her assertions, Bloom cites, as one example, that\nabout 50 percent of girls ages three to six worry about being fat (Bloom 2011).\nWe\u2019re talking about kindergarteners who are concerned about their body image.\nSociologists are acutely interested in of this type of gender socialization, by which\nsocietal expectations of how boys and girls should be\u2014how they should behave,\nwhat toys and colors they should like, and how important their attire is\u2014are\nreinforced. One solution to this type of gender socialization is being experimented with at the\nEgalia preschool in Sweden, where children develop in a genderless environment.\nAll the children at Egalia are referred to with neutral terms like \u201cfriend\u201d instead of\n\u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d Play areas and toys are consciously set up to eliminate any\nreinforcement of gender expectations (Haney 2011). Egalia strives to eliminate all\nsocietal gender norms from these children\u2019s preschool world.\nExtreme? Perhaps. So what is the middle ground? Bloom suggests that we start\nwith simple steps: when introduced to a young girl, ask about her favorite book or\nwhat she likes. In short, engage with her mind \u2026 not her outward appearance\n(Bloom 2011).\nSummary\nPsychological theories of self-development have been broadened by sociologists\nwho explicitly study the role of society and social interaction in self-development.\nCharles Cooley and George Mead both contributed significantly to the sociological\nunderstanding of the development of self. Lawrence Kohlberg and Carol Gilligan\ndeveloped their ideas further and researched how our sense of morality develops.\nGilligan added the dimension of gender differences to Kohlberg\u2019s theory.\nFurther Research\nLawrence Kohlberg was most famous for his research using moral dilemmas. He\npresented dilemmas to boys and asked them how they would judge the\nsituations.

It\nillustrates how completely intertwined human beings and their social worlds are.\nFirst, it is through teaching culture to new members that a society perpetuates\nitself. If new generations of a society don\u2019t learn its way of life, it ceases to exist.\nWhatever is distinctive about a culture must be transmitted to those who join it in\norder for a society to survive. For U.S. culture to continue, for example, children in\nthe United States must learn about cultural values related to democracy: they\nhave to learn the norms of voting, as well as how to use material objects such as\nvoting machines. Of course, some would argue that it\u2019s just as important in U.S.\nculture for the younger generation to learn the etiquette of eating in a restaurant\nor the rituals of tailgate parties at football games. In fact, there are many ideas\nand objects that people in the United States teach children about in hopes of\nkeeping the society\u2019s way of life going through another generation.\nSocialization teaches us our society\u2019s expectations for dining out. The manners\nand customs of different cultures (When can you use your hands to eat? How should you compliment the cook? Who is the \u201chead\u201d of the table?) are learned\nthrough socialization. (Photo courtesy of Niyam Bhushan/flickr)\nSocialization is just as essential to us as individuals. Social interaction provides the\nmeans via which we gradually become able to see ourselves through the eyes of\nothers, and how we learn who we are and how we fit into the world around us. In\naddition, to function successfully in society, we have to learn the basics of both\nmaterial and nonmaterial culture, everything from how to dress ourselves to\nwhat\u2019s suitable attire for a specific occasion; from when we sleep to what we\nsleep on; and from what\u2019s considered appropriate to eat for dinner to how to use\nthe stove to prepare it. Most importantly, we have to learn language\u2014whether\nit\u2019s the dominant language or one common in a subculture, whether it\u2019s verbal or\nthrough signs\u2014in order to communicate and to think. As we saw with Danielle,\nwithout socialization we literally have no self.\nNature versus Nurture\nSome experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture\u2014the relationships and\ncaring that surround us. Others argue that who we are is based entirely in\ngenetics. According to this belief, our temperaments, interests, and talents are set\nbefore birth. From this perspective, then, who we are depends on nature.\nOne way researchers attempt to measure the impact of nature is by studying\ntwins. Some studies have followed identical twins who were raised separately.\nThe pairs shared the same genetics but in some cases were socialized in different\nways. Instances of this type of situation are rare, but studying the degree to which\nidentical twins raised apart are the same and different can give researchers\ninsight into the way our temperaments, preferences, and abilities are shaped by\nour genetic makeup versus our social environment.\nFor example, in 1968, twin girls born to a mentally ill mother were put up for\nadoption, separated from each other, and raised in different households. The\nadoptive parents, and certainly the babies, did not realize the girls were one of\nfive pairs of twins who were made subjects of a scientific study (Flam 2007).\nIn 2003, the two women, then age thirty-five, were reunited. Elyse Schein and\nPaula Bernstein sat together in awe, feeling like they were looking into a mirror.\nNot only did they look alike but they also behaved alike, using the same hand gestures and facial expressions (Spratling 2007). Studies like these point to the\ngenetic roots of our temperament and behavior.\nThough genetics and hormones play an important role in human behavior,\nsociology\u2019s larger concern is the effect society has on human behavior, the\n\u201cnurture\u201d side of the nature versus nurture debate. What race were the twins?\nFrom what social class were their parents? What about gender? Religion? All\nthese factors affected the lives of the twins as much as their genetic makeup and\nare critical to consider as we look at life through the sociological lens.\nTHE LIFE OF CHRIS LANGAN, THE SMARTEST MAN YOU\u2019VE NEVER HEARD OF\nBouncer. Firefighter. Factory worker. Cowboy. Chris Langan spent the majority of\nhis adult life just getting by with jobs like these. He had no college degree, few\nresources, and a past filled with much disappointment. Chris Langan also had an\nIQ of over 195, nearly 100 points higher than the average person (Brabham 2001).\nSo why didn\u2019t Chris become a neurosurgeon, professor, or aeronautical engineer?\nAccording to Macolm Gladwell (2008) in his book Outliers: The Story of Success,\nChris didn\u2019t possess the set of social skills necessary to succeed on such a high\nlevel\u2014skills that aren\u2019t innate but learned.\nGladwell looked to a recent study conducted by sociologist Annette Lareau in\nwhich she closely shadowed 12 families from various economic backgrounds and\nexamined their parenting techniques. Parents from lower income families\nfollowed a strategy of \u201caccomplishment of natural growth,\u201d which is to say they\nlet their children develop on their own with a large amount of independence;\nparents from higher-income families, however, \u201cactively fostered and accessed a\nchild\u2019s talents, opinions, and skills\u201d (Gladwell 2008). These parents were more\nlikely to engage in analytical conversation, encourage active questioning of the\nestablishment, and foster development of negotiation skills. The parents were\nalso able to introduce their children to a wide range of activities, from sports to\nmusic to accelerated academic programs. When one middle-class child was\ndenied entry to a gifted and talented program, the mother petitioned the school\nand arranged additional testing until her daughter was admitted. Lower-income\nparents, however, were more likely to unquestioningly obey authorities such as\nschool boards. Their children were not being socialized to comfortably confront\nthe system and speak up (Gladwell 2008). What does this have to do with Chris Langan, deemed by some the smartest man\nin the world (Brabham 2001)? Chris was born in severe poverty, moving across\nthe country with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather. His genius went largely\nunnoticed. After accepting a full scholarship to Reed College, he lost his funding\nafter his mother failed to fill out necessary paperwork. Unable to successfully\nmake his case to the administration, Chris, who had received straight A\u2019s the\nprevious semester, was given F\u2019s on his transcript and forced to drop out. After he\nenrolled in Montana State, an administrator\u2019s refusal to rearrange his class\nschedule left him unable to find the means necessary to travel the 16 miles to\nattend classes. What Chris had in brilliance, he lacked in practical intelligence, or\nwhat psychologist Robert Sternberg defines as \u201cknowing what to say to whom,\nknowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect\u201d\n(Sternberg et al. 2000). Such knowledge was never part of his socialization.\nChris gave up on school and began working an array of blue-collar jobs, pursuing\nhis intellectual interests on the side. Though he\u2019s recently garnered attention for\nhis \u201cCognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe,\u201d he remains weary of and\nresistant to the educational system.\nAs Gladwell concluded, \u201cHe\u2019d had to make his way alone, and no one\u2014not rock\nstars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses\u2014\never makes it alone\u201d (2008). Identical twins may look alike, but their differences can give us clues to the effects\nof socialization. (Photo courtesy of D. Flam/flickr)\nSociologists all recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual\nand societal development. But how do scholars working in the three major\ntheoretical paradigms approach this topic? Structural functionalists would say\nthat socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to\noperate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it\nto new generations. Without socialization, a society\u2019s culture would perish as\nmembers died off. A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces\ninequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and\nnorms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are\nsocialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan\u2019s case,\nthis creates different (unequal) opportunities. An interactionist studying\nsocialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic\ncommunication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is\none small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles.\nSummary Socialization is important because it helps uphold societies and cultures; it is also\na key part of individual development. Research demonstrates that who we are is\naffected by both nature (our genetic and hormonal makeup) and nurture (the\nsocial environment in which we are raised). Sociology is most concerned with the\nway that society\u2019s influence affects our behavior patterns, made clear by the way\nbehavior varies across class and gender.\nGlossary\nnature\nthe influence of our genetic makeup on self-development\nnurture\nthe role that our social environment plays in self-development\nFurther Research\nLearn more about five other sets of twins who grew up apart and discovered each\nother later in life at http://openstaxcollege.org/l/twins\nReferences\nBrabham, Denis. 2001. \u201cThe Smart Guy.\u201d Newsday, August 21.

How do we learn to use the objects\nof our society\u2019s material culture? How do we come to adopt the beliefs, values,\nand norms that represent its nonmaterial culture? This learning takes place\nthrough interaction with various agents of socialization, like peer groups and\nfamilies, plus both formal and informal social institutions.\nSocial Group Agents\nSocial groups often provide the first experiences of socialization. Families, and\nlater peer groups, communicate expectations and reinforce norms. People first\nlearn to use the tangible objects of material culture in these settings, as well as\nbeing introduced to the beliefs and values of society.\nFamily\nFamily is the first agent of socialization. Mothers and fathers, siblings and\ngrandparents, plus members of an extended family, all teach a child what he or\nshe needs to know. For example, they show the child how to use objects (such as\nclothes, computers, eating utensils, books, bikes); how to relate to others (some\nas \u201cfamily,\u201d others as \u201cfriends,\u201d still others as \u201cstrangers\u201d or \u201cteachers\u201d or\n\u201cneighbors\u201d); and how the world works (what is \u201creal\u201d and what is \u201cimagined\u201d).\nAs you are aware, either from your own experience as a child or from your role in\nhelping to raise one, socialization includes teaching and learning about an\nunending array of objects and ideas.\nKeep in mind, however, that families do not socialize children in a vacuum. Many\nsocial factors affect the way a family raises its children. For example, we can use\nsociological imagination to recognize that individual behaviors are affected by the\nhistorical period in which they take place. Sixty years ago, it would not have been\nconsidered especially strict for a father to hit his son with a wooden spoon or a\nbelt if he misbehaved, but today that same action might be considered child\nabuse. Sociologists recognize that race, social class, religion, and other societal factors\nplay an important role in socialization. For example, poor families usually\nemphasize obedience and conformity when raising their children, while wealthy\nfamilies emphasize judgment and creativity (National Opinion Research Center\n2008). This may occur because working-class parents have less education and\nmore repetitive-task jobs for which it is helpful to be able to follow rules and\nconform. Wealthy parents tend to have better educations and often work in\nmanagerial positions or careers that require creative problem solving, so they\nteach their children behaviors that are beneficial in these positions. This means\nchildren are effectively socialized and raised to take the types of jobs their\nparents already have, thus reproducing the class system (Kohn 1977). Likewise,\nchildren are socialized to abide by gender norms, perceptions of race, and class-\nrelated behaviors.\nIn Sweden, for instance, stay-at-home fathers are an accepted part of the social\nlandscape. A government policy provides subsidized time off work\u2014480 days for\nfamilies with newborns\u2014with the option of the paid leave being shared between\nmothers and fathers. As one stay-at-home dad says, being home to take care of\nhis baby son \u201cis a real fatherly thing to do. I think that\u2019s very masculine\u201d\n(Associated Press 2011). Close to 90 percent of Swedish fathers use their\npaternity leave (about 340,000 dads); on average they take seven weeks per birth\n(The Economist, 2014). How do U.S. policies\u2014and our society\u2019s expected gender\nroles\u2014compare? How will Swedish children raised this way be socialized to\nparental gender norms? How might that be different from parental gender norms\nin the United States? The socialized roles of dads (and moms) vary by society. (Photo courtesy of Nate\nGrigg/flickr)\nPeer Groups\nA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and\nwho share interests. Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years, such as\nwhen kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns,\nthe rules of a game, or how to shoot a basket. As children grow into teenagers,\nthis process continues. Peer groups are important to adolescents in a new way, as\nthey begin to develop an identity separate from their parents and exert\nindependence. Additionally, peer groups provide their own opportunities for\nsocialization since kids usually engage in different types of activities with their\npeers than they do with their families. Peer groups provide adolescents\u2019 first\nmajor socialization experience outside the realm of their families. Interestingly,\nstudies have shown that although friendships rank high in adolescents\u2019 priorities,\nthis is balanced by parental influence.\nInstitutional Agents\nThe social institutions of our culture also inform our socialization. Formal\ninstitutions\u2014like schools, workplaces, and the government\u2014teach people how to\nbehave in and navigate these systems. Other institutions, like the media,\ncontribute to socialization by inundating us with messages about norms and\nexpectations. School\nMost U.S. children spend about seven hours a day, 180 days a year, in school,\nwhich makes it hard to deny the importance school has on their socialization (U.S.\nDepartment of Education 2004). Students are not in school only to study math,\nreading, science, and other subjects\u2014the manifest function of this system.\nSchools also serve a latent function in society by socializing children into\nbehaviors like practicing teamwork, following a schedule, and using textbooks.\nThese kindergarteners aren\u2019t just learning to read and write; they are being\nsocialized to norms like keeping their hands to themselves, standing in line, and\nreciting the Pledge of Allegiance. (Photo courtesy of Bonner Springs Library/flickr)\nSchool and classroom rituals, led by teachers serving as role models and leaders,\nregularly reinforce what society expects from children. Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden curriculum, the informal teaching done by\nschools.\nFor example, in the United States, schools have built a sense of competition into\nthe way grades are awarded and the way teachers evaluate students (Bowles and\nGintis 1976). When children participate in a relay race or a math contest, they\nlearn there are winners and losers in society. When children are required to work\ntogether on a project, they practice teamwork with other people in cooperative\nsituations. The hidden curriculum prepares children for the adult world. Children\nlearn how to deal with bureaucracy, rules, expectations, waiting their turn, and\nsitting still for hours during the day. Schools in different cultures socialize children\ndifferently in order to prepare them to function well in those cultures. The latent\nfunctions of teamwork and dealing with bureaucracy are features of U.S. culture.\nSchools also socialize children by teaching them about citizenship and national\npride. In the United States, children are taught to say the Pledge of Allegiance.\nMost districts require classes about U.S. history and geography. As academic\nunderstanding of history evolves, textbooks in the United States have been\nscrutinized and revised to update attitudes toward other cultures as well as\nperspectives on historical events; thus, children are socialized to a different\nnational or world history than earlier textbooks may have done. For example,\ninformation about the mistreatment of African Americans and Native American\nIndians more accurately reflects those events than in textbooks of the past.\nCONTROVERSIAL TEXTBOOKS\nOn August 13, 2001, twenty South Korean men gathered in Seoul. Each chopped\noff one of his own fingers because of textbooks. These men took drastic measures\nto protest eight middle school textbooks approved by Tokyo for use in Japanese\nmiddle schools. According to the Korean government (and other East Asian\nnations), the textbooks glossed over negative events in Japan\u2019s history at the\nexpense of other Asian countries.\nIn the early 1900s, Japan was one of Asia\u2019s more aggressive nations. For instance,\nit held Korea as a colony between 1910 and 1945. Today, Koreans argue that the\nJapanese are whitewashing that colonial history through these textbooks. One\nmajor criticism is that they do not mention that, during World War II, the\nJapanese forced Korean women into sexual slavery. The textbooks describe the women as having been \u201cdrafted\u201d to work, a euphemism that downplays the\nbrutality of what actually occurred. Some Japanese textbooks dismiss an\nimportant Korean independence demonstration in 1919 as a \u201criot.\u201d In reality,\nJapanese soldiers attacked peaceful demonstrators, leaving roughly 6,000 dead\nand 15,000 wounded (Crampton 2002).\nAlthough it may seem extreme that people are so enraged about how events are\ndescribed in a textbook that they would resort to dismemberment, the protest\naffirms that textbooks are a significant tool of socialization in state-run education\nsystems.\nThe Workplace\nJust as children spend much of their day at school, many U.S. adults at some point\ninvest a significant amount of time at a place of employment. Although socialized\ninto their culture since birth, workers require new socialization into a workplace,\nin terms of both material culture (such as how to operate the copy machine) and\nnonmaterial culture (such as whether it\u2019s okay to speak directly to the boss or\nhow to share the refrigerator).\nDifferent jobs require different types of socialization. In the past, many people\nworked a single job until retirement. Today, the trend is to switch jobs at least\nonce a decade. Between the ages of eighteen and forty-six, the average baby\nboomer of the younger set held 11.3 different jobs (U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2014). This means that people must become socialized to, and\nsocialized by, a variety of work environments.\nReligion\nWhile some religions are informal institutions, here we focus on practices\nfollowed by formal institutions. Religion is an important avenue of socialization\nfor many people. The United States is full of synagogues, temples, churches,\nmosques, and similar religious communities where people gather to worship and\nlearn. Like other institutions, these places teach participants how to interact with\nthe religion\u2019s material culture (like a mezuzah, a prayer rug, or a communion\nwafer). For some people, important ceremonies related to family structure\u2014like\nmarriage and birth\u2014are connected to religious celebrations. Many religious\ninstitutions also uphold gender norms and contribute to their enforcement through socialization. From ceremonial rites of passage that reinforce the family\nunit to power dynamics that reinforce gender roles, organized religion fosters a\nshared set of socialized values that are passed on through society.\nGovernment\nAlthough we do not think about it, many of the rites of passage people go through\ntoday are based on age norms established by the government. To be defined as\nan \u201cadult\u201d usually means being eighteen years old, the age at which a person\nbecomes legally responsible for him- or herself. And sixty-five years old is the start\nof \u201cold age\u201d since most people become eligible for senior benefits at that point.\nEach time we embark on one of these new categories\u2014senior, adult, taxpayer\u2014\nwe must be socialized into our new role. Seniors must learn the ropes of\nMedicare, Social Security benefits, and senior shopping discounts. When U.S.\nmales turn eighteen, they must register with the Selective Service System within\nthirty days to be entered into a database for possible military service. These\ngovernment dictates mark the points at which we require socialization into a new\ncategory.\nMass Media\nMass media distribute impersonal information to a wide audience, via television,\nnewspapers, radio, and the Internet. With the average person spending over four\nhours a day in front of the television (and children averaging even more screen\ntime), media greatly influences social norms (Roberts, Foehr, and Rideout 2005).\nPeople learn about objects of material culture (like new technology and\ntransportation options), as well as nonmaterial culture\u2014what is true (beliefs),\nwhat is important (values), and what is expected (norms). GIRLS AND MOVIES\nSome people are concerned about the way girls today are socialized into a\n\u201cprincess culture.\u201d (Photo courtesy of J\u00f8rgen H\u00e5land/flickr)\nPixar is one of the largest producers of children\u2019s movies in the world and has\nreleased large box office draws, such as Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles, and Up.\nWhat Pixar has never before produced is a movie with a female lead role. This\nchanged with Pixar\u2019s newest movie Brave, which was released in 2012.\nBefore Brave, women in Pixar served as supporting characters and love interests.\nIn Up, for example, the only human female character dies within the first ten\nminutes of the film. For the millions of girls watching Pixar films, there are few\nstrong characters or roles for them to relate to. If they do not see possible\nversions of themselves, they may come to view women as secondary to the lives\nof men.\nThe animated films of Pixar\u2019s parent company, Disney, have many female lead\nroles. Disney is well known for films with female leads, such as Snow\nWhite, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, and Mulan. Many of Disney\u2019s movies star a female, and she is nearly always a princess figure. If she is not a princess to begin\nwith, she typically ends the movie by marrying a prince or, in the case of Mulan, a\nmilitary general. Although not all \u201cprincesses\u201d in Disney movies play a passive role\nin their lives, they typically find themselves needing to be rescued by a man, and\nthe happy ending they all search for includes marriage.\nAlongside this prevalence of princesses, many parents are expressing concern\nabout the culture of princesses that Disney has created. Peggy Orenstein\naddresses this problem in her popular book, Cinderella Ate My Daughter.\nOrenstein wonders why every little girl is expected to be a \u201cprincess\u201d and why\npink has become an all-consuming obsession for many young girls. Another\nmother wondered what she did wrong when her three-year-old daughter refused\nto do \u201cnonprincessy\u201d things, including running and jumping. The effects of this\nprincess culture can have negative consequences for girls throughout life. An\nearly emphasis on beauty and sexiness can lead to eating disorders, low self-\nesteem, and risky sexual behavior among older girls.\nWhat should we expect from Pixar\u2019s new movie, the first starring a female\ncharacter? Although Bravefeatures a female lead, she is still a princess. Will this\nfilm offer any new type of role model for young girls? (O\u2019Connor 2011; Barnes\n2010; Rose 2011).\nSummary\nOur direct interactions with social groups, like families and peers, teach us how\nothers expect us to behave.

We aren\u2019t \u201cstamped\u201d by\nsome socialization machine as we move along a conveyor belt and thereby\nsocialized once and for all. In fact, socialization is a lifelong process.\nIn the United States, socialization throughout the life course is determined greatly\nby age norms and \u201ctime-related rules and regulations\u201d (Setterson 2002). As we\ngrow older, we encounter age-related transition points that require socialization\ninto a new role, such as becoming school age, entering the workforce, or retiring.\nFor example, the U.S. government mandates that all children attend school. Child\nlabor laws, enacted in the early twentieth century, nationally declared that\nchildhood be a time of learning, not of labor. In countries such as Niger and Sierra\nLeone, however, child labor remains common and socially acceptable, with little\nlegislation to regulate such practices (UNICEF 2012).\nGAP YEAR: HOW DIFFERENT SOCIETIES SOCIALIZE YOUNG ADULTS Age transition points require socialization into new roles that can vary widely\nbetween societies. Young adults in America are encouraged to enter college or\nthe workforce right away, students in England and India can take a year off like\nBritish Princes William and Harry did, while young men in Singapore and\nSwitzerland must serve time in the military. (Photo courtesy of Charles\nMcCain/flickr)\nHave you ever heard of gap year? It\u2019s a common custom in British society. When\nteens finish their secondary schooling (aka high school in the United States), they\noften take a year \u201coff\u201d before entering college. Frequently, they might take a job,\ntravel, or find other ways to experience another culture. Prince William, the Duke\nof Cambridge, spent his gap year practicing survival skills in Belize, teaching\nEnglish in Chile, and working on a dairy farm in the United Kingdom (Prince of\nWales 2012a). His brother, Prince Harry, advocated for AIDS orphans in Africa and\nworked as a jackeroo (a novice ranch hand) in Australia (Prince of Wales 2012b).\nIn the United States, this life transition point is socialized quite differently, and\ntaking a year off is generally frowned upon. Instead, U.S. youth are encouraged to\npick career paths by their mid-teens, to select a college and a major by their late\nteens, and to have completed all collegiate schooling or technical training for their\ncareer by their early twenties. In yet other nations, this phase of the life course is tied into conscription, a term\nthat describes compulsory military service. Egypt, Switzerland, Turkey, and\nSingapore all have this system in place. Youth in these nations (often only the\nmales) are expected to undergo a number of months or years of military training\nand service.\nHow might your life be different if you lived in one of these other countries? Can\nyou think of similar social norms\u2014related to life age-transition points\u2014that vary\nfrom country to country?\nMany of life\u2019s social expectations are made clear and enforced on a cultural level.\nThrough interacting with others and watching others interact, the expectation to\nfulfill roles becomes clear. While in elementary or middle school, the prospect of\nhaving a boyfriend or girlfriend may have been considered undesirable. The\nsocialization that takes place in high school changes the expectation. By observing\nthe excitement and importance attached to dating and relationships within the\nhigh school social scene, it quickly becomes apparent that one is now expected\nnot only to be a child and a student, but also a significant other. Graduation from\nformal education\u2014high school, vocational school, or college\u2014involves\nsocialization into a new set of expectations.\nEducational expectations vary not only from culture to culture, but also from class\nto class. While middle- or upper-class families may expect their daughter or son to\nattend a four-year university after graduating from high school, other families\nmay expect their child to immediately begin working full-time, as many within\ntheir family have done before.\nTHE LONG ROAD TO ADULTHOOD FOR MILLENNIALS\n2008 was a year of financial upheaval in the United States. Rampant foreclosures\nand bank failures set off a chain of events sparking government distrust, loan\ndefaults, and large-scale unemployment. How has this affected the United\nStates\u2019s young adults?\nMillennials, sometimes also called Gen Y, is a term that describes the generation\nborn during the early eighties to early nineties. While the recession was in full\nswing, many were in the process of entering, attending, or graduating from high school and college. With employment prospects at historical lows, large numbers\nof graduates were unable to find work, sometimes moving back in with their\nparents and struggling to pay back student loans.\nAccording to the New York Times, this economic stall is causing the Millennials to\npostpone what most Americans consider to be adulthood: \u201cThe traditional cycle\nseems to have gone off course, as young people remain untethered to romantic\npartners or to permanent homes, going back to school for lack of better options,\ntraveling, avoiding commitments, competing ferociously for unpaid internships or\ntemporary (and often grueling) Teach for America jobs, forestalling the beginning\nof adult life\u201d (Henig 2010). The term Boomerang Generation describes recent\ncollege graduates, for whom lack of adequate employment upon college\ngraduation often leads to a return to the parental home (Davidson, 2014).\nThe five milestones that define adulthood, Henig writes, are \u201ccompleting school,\nleaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying, and having a child\u201d\n(Henig 2010). These social milestones are taking longer for Millennials to attain, if\nthey\u2019re attained at all. Sociologists wonder what long-term impact this\ngeneration\u2019s situation may have on society as a whole.\nIn the process of socialization, adulthood brings a new set of challenges and\nexpectations, as well as new roles to fill. As the aging process moves forward,\nsocial roles continue to evolve. Pleasures of youth, such as wild nights out and\nserial dating, become less acceptable in the eyes of society. Responsibility and\ncommitment are emphasized as pillars of adulthood, and men and women are\nexpected to \u201csettle down.\u201d During this period, many people enter into marriage\nor a civil union, bring children into their families, and focus on a career path. They\nbecome partners or parents instead of students or significant others.\nJust as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers, play house, and dress up,\nadults also engage in anticipatory socialization, the preparation for future life\nroles. Examples would include a couple who cohabitate before marriage or soon-\nto-be parents who read infant care books and prepare their home for the new\narrival. As part of anticipatory socialization, adults who are financially able begin\nplanning for their retirement, saving money, and looking into future healthcare options. The transition into any new life role, despite the social structure that\nsupports it, can be difficult.\nResocialization\nIn the process of resocialization, old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role\nare removed because they are no longer of use. Resocialization is necessary when\na person moves to a senior care center, goes to boarding school, or serves time in\njail. In the new environment, the old rules no longer apply. The process of\nresocialization is typically more stressful than normal socialization because people\nhave to unlearn behaviors that have become customary to them.\nThe most common way resocialization occurs is in a total institution where people\nare isolated from society and are forced to follow someone else\u2019s rules. A ship at\nsea is a total institution, as are religious convents, prisons, or some cult\norganizations. They are places cut off from a larger society. The 6.9 million\nAmericans who lived in prisons and penitentiaries at the end of 2012 are also\nmembers of this type of institution (U.S. Department of Justice 2012). As another\nexample, every branch of the military is a total institution.\nMany individuals are resocialized into an institution through a two-part process.\nFirst, members entering an institution must leave behind their old identity\nthrough what is known as a degradation ceremony. In a degradation ceremony,\nnew members lose the aspects of their old identity and are given new identities.\nThe process is sometimes gentle. To enter a senior care home, an elderly person\noften must leave a family home and give up many belongings which were part of\nhis or her long-standing identity. Though caretakers guide the elderly\ncompassionately, the process can still be one of loss. In many cults, this process is\nalso gentle and happens in an environment of support and caring.\nIn other situations, the degradation ceremony can be more extreme. New\nprisoners lose freedom, rights (including the right to privacy), and personal\nbelongings. When entering the army, soldiers have their hair cut short. Their old\nclothes are removed, and they wear matching uniforms. These individuals must\ngive up any markers of their former identity in order to be resocialized into an\nidentity as a \u201csoldier.\u201d In basic training, members of the Air Force are taught to walk, move, and look like\neach other.

Palacios, U.S. Air\nForce/Wikimedia Commons)\nAfter new members of an institution are stripped of their old identity, they build a\nnew one that matches the new society. In the military, soldiers go through basic\ntraining together, where they learn new rules and bond with one another. They\nfollow structured schedules set by their leaders. Soldiers must keep their areas\nclean for inspection, learn to march in correct formations, and salute when in the\npresence of superiors.\nLearning to deal with life after having lived in a total institution requires yet\nanother process of resocialization. In the U.S. military, soldiers learn discipline and\na capacity for hard work. They set aside personal goals to achieve a mission, and\nthey take pride in the accomplishments of their units. Many soldiers who leave\nthe military transition these skills into excellent careers. Others find themselves\nlost upon leaving, uncertain about the outside world and what to do next. The\nprocess of resocialization to civilian life is not a simple one.\nSummary\nSocialization is a lifelong process that reoccurs as we enter new phases of life,\nsuch as adulthood or senior age. Resocialization is a process that removes the\nsocialization we have developed over time and replaces it with newly learned rules and roles. Because it involves removing old habits that have been built up,\nresocialization can be a stressful and difficult process.\nGlossary\nanticipatory socialization\nthe way we prepare for future life roles\ndegradation ceremony\nthe process by which new members of a total institution lose aspects of\ntheir old identities and are given new ones\nresocialization\nthe process by which old behaviors are removed and new behaviors are\nlearned in their place\nFurther Research\nHomelessness is an endemic problem among veterans.

Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 4 \u2013 Socialization in the Family and Parenting Influences & Practices\n4.1 Introduction to Marriage and Family\nDerived from Introduction to Marriage and Family by OpenStax\nWhat constitutes a family nowadays? (Photo courtesy of Michael/flickr)\nRebecca and John were having a large church wedding attended by family and\nfriends. They had been living together their entire senior year of college and\nplanned on getting married right after graduation.\nRebecca's parents were very traditional in their life and family. They had married\nafter college at which time Rebecca's mother was a stay-at-home mother and\nRebecca's father was a Vice President at a large accounting firm. The marriage\nwas viewed as very strong by outsiders. John's parents had divorced when John was five. He and his younger sister lived\nwith his financially struggling mother. The mother had a live-in boyfriend that she\nmarried when John was in high school. The Asian step father was helpful in\ngetting John summer jobs and encouraged John to attend the local community\ncollege before moving to the four-year university.\nRebecca's maid of honor, Susie, attended college with Rebecca but had dropped\nout when finding out she was pregnant. She chose not to marry the father and\nwas currently raising the child as a single parent. Working and taking care of the\nchild made college a remote possibility.\nThe best man, Brad, was in and out of relationships. He was currently seeing a\nwoman with several children of different parentage. The gossip had this\nrelationship lasting about the same amount of time as all the previous\nencounters.\nRebecca and John had a gay couple as ushers. Steve and Roger had been in a\nmonogamous relationship for almost ten years, had adopted a minority daughter\nand were starting a web-based business together. It was obvious they both\nadored their child, and they planned on being married at a Washington\ndestination ceremony later in the year.\nThis scenario may be complicated, but it is representative of the many types of\nfamilies in today's society.\nBetween 2006 and 2010, nearly half of heterosexual women (48 percent) ages\nfifteen to forty-four said they were not married to their spouse or partner when\nthey first lived with them, the report says. That's up from 43 percent in 2002, and\n34 percent in 1995 (Rettner 2013). The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the\nnumber of unmarried couples has grown from fewer than one million in the\n1970s to 8.1 million in 2011. Cohabitating, but unwed, couples account for 10\npercent of all opposite-sex couples in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau\n2008). Some may never choose to wed (Gardner 2013). With fewer couples\nmarrying, the traditional U.S. family structure is becoming less common.\nReferences\nGardner, Amanda. 2013. \"More U.S. Couples Living Together Instead of Marrying, CDC Finds.\" HealthDay.com.\nRetrieved December 29, 2014 (ttp://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/centers-for-disease-\ncontrol-news-120/more-u-s-couples-living-together-instead-of-marrying-cdc-finds-675096.html).

What Is a Family?\nDerived from What Is Marriage? What Is a Family? by OpenStax\nThe modern concept of family is far more encompassing than in past decades.\nWhat do you think constitutes a family? (Photo (a) courtesy Gareth\nWilliams/flickr; photo (b) courtesy Guillaume Paumier/ Wikimedia Commons)\nMarriage and family are key structures in most societies. While the two\ninstitutions have historically been closely linked in U.S. culture, their connection is becoming more complex. The relationship between marriage and family is an\ninteresting topic of study to sociologists.\nWhat is marriage? Different people define it in different ways. Not even\nsociologists are able to agree on a single meaning. For our purposes, we\u2019ll\ndefine marriage as a legally recognized social contract between two people,\ntraditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of the\nunion. In practicing cultural relativism, we should also consider variations, such as\nwhether a legal union is required (think of \u201ccommon law\u201d marriage and its\nequivalents), or whether more than two people can be involved (consider\npolygamy). Other variations on the definition of marriage might include whether\nspouses are of opposite sexes or the same sex and how one of the traditional\nexpectations of marriage (to produce children) is understood today.\nSociologists are interested in the relationship between the institution of marriage\nand the institution of family because, historically, marriages are what create a\nfamily, and families are the most basic social unit upon which society is built. Both\nmarriage and family create status roles that are sanctioned by society.\nSo what is a family? A husband, a wife, and two children\u2014maybe even a pet\u2014has\nserved as the model for the traditional U.S. family for most of the twentieth\ncentury. But what about families that deviate from this model, such as a single-\nparent household or a homosexual couple without children? Should they be\nconsidered families as well?\nThe question of what constitutes a family is a prime area of debate in family\nsociology, as well as in politics and religion. Social conservatives tend to define\nthe family in terms of structure with each family member filling a certain role (like\nfather, mother, or child). Sociologists, on the other hand, tend to define family\nmore in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a\nstrict configuration of status roles. Here, we\u2019ll define family as a socially\nrecognized group (usually joined by blood, marriage, cohabitation, or adoption)\nthat forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of society.\nSociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into\nthem. A family of orientation refers to the family into which a person is born.\nA family of procreation describes one that is formed through marriage. These\ndistinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage. Drawing on two sociological paradigms, the sociological understanding of what\nconstitutes a family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as\nfunctionalism. These two theories indicate that families are groups in which\nparticipants view themselves as family members and act accordingly. In other\nwords, families are groups in which people come together to form a strong\nprimary group connection and maintain emotional ties to one another over a long\nperiod of time. Such families may include groups of close friends or teammates. In\naddition, the functionalist perspective views families as groups that perform vital\nroles for society\u2014both internally (for the family itself) and externally (for society\nas a whole). Families provide for one another\u2019s physical, emotional, and social\nwell-being. Parents care for and socialize children. Later in life, adult children\noften care for elderly parents. While interactionism helps us understand the\nsubjective experience of belonging to a \u201cfamily,\u201d functionalism illuminates the\nmany purposes of families and their roles in the maintenance of a balanced\nsociety (Parsons and Bales 1956). We will go into more detail about how these\ntheories apply to family in.\nChallenges Families Face\nPeople in the United States as a whole are somewhat divided when it comes to\ndetermining what does and what does not constitute a family. In a 2010 survey\nconducted by professors at the University of Indiana, nearly all participants (99.8\npercent) agreed that a husband, wife, and children constitute a family. Ninety-two\npercent stated that a husband and a wife without children still constitute a family.\nThe numbers drop for less traditional structures: unmarried couples with children\n(83 percent), unmarried couples without children (39.6 percent), gay male\ncouples with children (64 percent), and gay male couples without children (33\npercent) (Powell et al. 2010). This survey revealed that children tend to be the key\nindicator in establishing \u201cfamily\u201d status: the percentage of individuals who agreed\nthat unmarried couples and gay couples constitute a family nearly doubled when\nchildren were added.\nThe study also revealed that 60 percent of U.S. respondents agreed that if you\nconsider yourself a family, you are a family (a concept that reinforces an\ninteractionist perspective) (Powell 2010). The government, however, is not so\nflexible in its definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d The U.S. Census Bureau defines a family as \u201ca\ngroup of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth,\nmarriage, or adoption and residing together\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). While this structured definition can be used as a means to consistently track family-\nrelated patterns over several years, it excludes individuals such as cohabitating\nunmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples. Legality aside, sociologists\nwould argue that the general concept of family is more diverse and less\nstructured than in years past. Society has given more leeway to the design of a\nfamily making room for what works for its members (Jayson 2010).\nFamily is, indeed, a subjective concept, but it is a fairly objective fact that family\n(whatever one\u2019s concept of it may be) is very important to people in the United\nStates. In a 2010 survey by Pew Research Center in Washington, DC, 76 percent of\nadults surveyed stated that family is \u201cthe most important\u201d element of their life\u2014\njust one percent said it was \u201cnot important\u201d (Pew Research Center 2010). It is also\nvery important to society. President Ronald Regan notably stated, \u201cThe family has\nalways been the cornerstone of American society. Our families nurture, preserve,\nand pass on to each succeeding generation the values we share and cherish,\nvalues that are the foundation of our freedoms\u201d (Lee 2009). While the design of\nthe family may have changed in recent years, the fundamentals of emotional\ncloseness and support are still present. Most responders to the Pew survey stated\nthat their family today is at least as close (45 percent) or closer (40 percent) than\nthe family with which they grew up (Pew Research Center 2010).\nAlongside the debate surrounding what constitutes a family is the question of\nwhat people in the United States believe constitutes a marriage. Many religious\nand social conservatives believe that marriage can only exist between a man and\na woman, citing religious scripture and the basics of human reproduction as\nsupport. Social liberals and progressives, on the other hand, believe that marriage\ncan exist between two consenting adults\u2014be they a man and a woman, or a\nwoman and a woman\u2014and that it would be discriminatory to deny such a couple\nthe civil, social, and economic benefits of marriage.\nMarriage Patterns\nWith single parenting and cohabitation (when a couple shares a residence but not\na marriage) becoming more acceptable in recent years, people may be less\nmotivated to get married. In a recent survey, 39 percent of respondents answered\n\u201cyes\u201d when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete (Pew Research Center\n2010). The institution of marriage is likely to continue, but some previous patterns\nof marriage will become outdated as new patterns emerge. In this context, cohabitation contributes to the phenomenon of people getting married for the\nfirst time at a later age than was typical in earlier generations (Glezer 1991).\nFurthermore, marriage will continue to be delayed as more people place\neducation and career ahead of \u201csettling down.\u201d\nOne Partner or Many?\nPeople in the United States typically equate marriage with monogamy, when\nsomeone is married to only one person at a time. In many countries and cultures\naround the world, however, having one spouse is not the only form of marriage.\nIn a majority of cultures (78 percent), polygamy, or being married to more than\none person at a time, is accepted (Murdock 1967), with most polygamous\nsocieties existing in northern Africa and east Asia (Altman and Ginat 1996).\nInstances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the form of\npolygyny. Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at\nthe same time. The reverse, when a woman is married to more than one man at\nthe same time, is called polyandry. It is far less common and only occurs in about\n1 percent of the world\u2019s cultures (Altman and Ginat 1996). The reasons for the\noverwhelming prevalence of polygamous societies are varied but they often\ninclude issues of population growth, religious ideologies, and social status.\nWhile the majority of societies accept polygyny, the majority of people do not\npractice it. Often fewer than 10 percent (and no more than 25\u201335 percent) of\nmen in polygamous cultures have more than one wife; these husbands are often\nolder, wealthy, high-status men (Altman and Ginat 1996). The average plural\nmarriage involves no more than three wives. Negev Bedouin men in Israel, for\nexample, typically have two wives, although it is acceptable to have up to four\n(Griver 2008). As urbanization increases in these cultures, polygamy is likely to\ndecrease as a result of greater access to mass media, technology, and education\n(Altman and Ginat 1996).\nIn the United States, polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable\nand it is illegal. The act of entering into marriage while still married to another\nperson is referred to as bigamy and is considered a felony in most states.\nPolygamy in the United States is often associated with those of the Mormon faith,\nalthough in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy.\nFundamentalist Mormons, such as those in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), on the other hand, still hold tightly to the\nhistoric Mormon beliefs and practices and allow polygamy in their sect.\nThe prevalence of polygamy among Mormons is often overestimated due to\nsensational media stories such as the Yearning for Zion ranch raid in Texas in 2008\nand popular television shows such as HBO\u2019s Big Love and TLC\u2019s Sister Wives. It is\nestimated that there are about 37,500 fundamentalist Mormons involved in\npolygamy in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, but that number has shown a\nsteady decrease in the last 100 years (Useem 2007).\nU.S. Muslims, however, are an emerging group with an estimated 20,000\npracticing polygamy. Again, polygamy among U.S. Muslims is uncommon and\noccurs only in approximately 1 percent of the population (Useem 2007). For now\npolygamy among U.S. Muslims has gone fairly unnoticed by mainstream society,\nbut like fundamentalist Mormons whose practices were off the public\u2019s radar for\ndecades, they may someday find themselves at the center of social debate.\nJoseph Smith, Jr., the founder of Mormonism, is said to have practiced polygamy.\n(Photo courtesy of public domain/Wikimedia Commons) Residency and Lines of Descent\nWhen considering one\u2019s lineage, most people in the United States look to both\ntheir father\u2019s and mother\u2019s sides. Both paternal and maternal ancestors are\nconsidered part of one\u2019s family. This pattern of tracing kinship is called bilateral\ndescent. Note that kinship, or one\u2019s traceable ancestry, can be based on blood or\nmarriage or adoption. Sixty percent of societies, mostly modernized nations,\nfollow a bilateral descent pattern. Unilateral descent (the tracing of kinship\nthrough one parent only) is practiced in the other 40 percent of the world\u2019s\nsocieties, with high concentration in pastoral cultures (O\u2019Neal 2006).\nThere are three types of unilateral descent: patrilineal, which follows the father\u2019s\nline only; matrilineal, which follows the mother\u2019s side only; and ambilineal, which\nfollows either the father\u2019s only or the mother\u2019s side only, depending on the\nsituation. In partrilineal societies, such as those in rural China and India, only\nmales carry on the family surname. This gives males the prestige of permanent\nfamily membership while females are seen as only temporary members (Harrell\n2001). U.S. society assumes some aspects of partrilineal decent. For instance,\nmost children assume their father\u2019s last name even if the mother retains her birth\nname.\nIn matrilineal societies, inheritance and family ties are traced to women.\nMatrilineal descent is common in Native American societies, notably the Crow\nand Cherokee tribes. In these societies, children are seen as belonging to the\nwomen and, therefore, one\u2019s kinship is traced to one\u2019s mother, grandmother,\ngreat grandmother, and so on (Mails 1996). In ambilineal societies, which are\nmost common in Southeast Asian countries, parents may choose to associate\ntheir children with the kinship of either the mother or the father. This choice may\nbe based on the desire to follow stronger or more prestigious kinship lines or on\ncultural customs such as men following their father\u2019s side and women following\ntheir mother\u2019s side (Lambert 2009).\nTracing one\u2019s line of descent to one parent rather than the other can be relevant\nto the issue of residence. In many cultures, newly married couples move in with,\nor near to, family members. In a patrilocal residence system it is customary for\nthe wife to live with (or near) her husband\u2019s blood relatives (or family or\norientation). Patrilocal systems can be traced back thousands of years. In a DNA\nanalysis of 4,600-year-old bones found in Germany, scientists found indicators of patrilocal living arrangements (Haak et al 2008). Patrilocal residence is thought to\nbe disadvantageous to women because it makes them outsiders in the home and\ncommunity; it also keeps them disconnected from their own blood relatives. In\nChina, where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common, the written symbols\nfor maternal grandmother (w\u00e1ip\u00e1) are separately translated to mean \u201coutsider\u201d\nand \u201cwomen\u201d (Cohen 2011).\nSimilarly, in matrilocal residence systems, where it is customary for the husband\nto live with his wife\u2019s blood relatives (or her family of orientation), the husband\ncan feel disconnected and can be labeled as an outsider. The Minangkabau\npeople, a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands of West Sumatra in\nIndonesia, believe that home is the place of women and they give men little\npower in issues relating to the home or family (Joseph and Najmabadi 2003).\nMost societies that use patrilocal and patrilineal systems are patriarchal, but very\nfew societies that use matrilocal and matrilineal systems are matriarchal, as\nfamily life is often considered an important part of the culture for women,\nregardless of their power relative to men.\nStages of Family Life\nAs we\u2019ve established, the concept of family has changed greatly in recent\ndecades. Historically, it was often thought that many families evolved through a\nseries of predictable stages. Developmental or \u201cstage\u201d theories used to play a\nprominent role in family sociology (Strong and DeVault 1992). Today, however,\nthese models have been criticized for their linear and conventional assumptions\nas well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms. While reviewing\nsome of these once-popular theories, it is important to identify their strengths\nand weaknesses.\nThe set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred\nto as the family life cycle. One of the first designs of the family life cycle was\ndeveloped by Paul Glick in 1955. In Glick\u2019s original design, he asserted that most\npeople will grow up, establish families, rear and launch their children, experience\nan \u201cempty nest\u201d period, and come to the end of their lives. This cycle will then\ncontinue with each subsequent generation (Glick 1989). Glick\u2019s colleague, Evelyn\nDuvall, elaborated on the family life cycle by developing these classic stages of\nfamily (Strong and DeVault 1992): Stage TheoryThis table shows one example of how a \u201cstage\u201d theory might\ncategorize the phases a family goes through.\nStage Family Type Children\n1 Marriage Family Childless\n2 Procreation Family Children ages 0 to 2.5\n3 Preschooler Family Children ages 2.5 to 6\n4 School-age Family Children ages 6\u201313\n5 Teenage Family Children ages 13\u201320\n6 Launching Family Children begin to leave home\n7 Empty Nest Family \u201cEmpty nest\u201d; adult children have left home\nThe family life cycle was used to explain the different processes that occur in\nfamilies over time. Sociologists view each stage as having its own structure with\ndifferent challenges, achievements, and accomplishments that transition the\nfamily from one stage to the next. For example, the problems and challenges that\na family experiences in Stage 1 as a married couple with no children are likely\nmuch different than those experienced in Stage 5 as a married couple with\nteenagers. The success of a family can be measured by how well they adapt to\nthese challenges and transition into each stage. While sociologists use the family\nlife cycle to study the dynamics of family over time, consumer and marketing\nresearchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as\nthey progress through each stage (Murphy and Staples 1979).\nAs early \u201cstage\u201d theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not\naccounting for differences in gender, ethnicity, culture, and lifestyle, less rigid models of the family life cycle have been developed. One example is the family\nlife course, which recognizes the events that occur in the lives of families but\nviews them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages\n(Strong and DeVault 1992). This type of model accounts for changes in family\ndevelopment, such as the fact that in today\u2019s society, childbearing does not\nalways occur with marriage. It also sheds light on other shifts in the way family life\nis practiced. Society\u2019s modern understanding of family rejects rigid \u201cstage\u201d\ntheories and is more accepting of new, fluid models.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF TELEVISION FAMILIES\nWhether you grew up watching the Cleavers, the Waltons, the Huxtables, or the\nSimpsons, most of the iconic families you saw in television sitcoms included a\nfather, a mother, and children cavorting under the same roof while comedy\nensued. The 1960s was the height of the suburban U.S. nuclear family on\ntelevision with shows such as The Donna Reed Show and Father Knows Best.\nWhile some shows of this era portrayed single parents (My Three\nSons and Bonanza, for instance), the single status almost always resulted from\nbeing widowed\u2014not divorced or unwed.\nAlthough family dynamics in real U.S. homes were changing, the expectations for\nfamilies portrayed on television were not. The United States\u2019 first reality show, An\nAmerican Family (which aired on PBS in 1973) chronicled Bill and Pat Loud and\ntheir children as a \u201ctypical\u201d U.S. family. During the series, the oldest son, Lance,\nannounced to the family that he was gay, and at the series\u2019 conclusion, Bill and\nPat decided to divorce. Although the Loud\u2019s union was among the 30 percent of\nmarriages that ended in divorce in 1973, the family was featured on the cover of\nthe March 12 issue of Newsweek with the title \u201cThe Broken Family\u201d (Ruoff 2002).\nLess traditional family structures in sitcoms gained popularity in the 1980s with\nshows such as Diff\u2019rent Strokes (a widowed man with two adopted African\nAmerican sons) and One Day at a Time (a divorced woman with two teenage\ndaughters). Still, traditional families such as those in Family Ties and The Cosby\nShow dominated the ratings. The late 1980s and the 1990s saw the introduction\nof the dysfunctional family. Shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children,\nand The Simpsons portrayed traditional nuclear families, but in a much less\nflattering light than those from the 1960s did (Museum of Broadcast\nCommunications 2011). Over the past ten years, the nontraditional family has become somewhat of a\ntradition in television. While most situation comedies focus on single men and\nwomen without children, those that do portray families often stray from the\nclassic structure: they include unmarried and divorced parents, adopted children,\ngay couples, and multigenerational households. Even those that do feature\ntraditional family structures may show less-traditional characters in supporting\nroles, such as the brothers in the highly rated shows Everybody Loves\nRaymond and Two and Half Men. Even wildly popular children\u2019s programs as\nDisney\u2019s Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody feature single\nparents.\nIn 2009, ABC premiered an intensely nontraditional family with the broadcast\nof Modern Family. The show follows an extended family that includes a divorced\nand remarried father with one stepchild, and his biological adult children\u2014one of\nwho is in a traditional two-parent household, and the other who is a gay man in a\ncommitted relationship raising an adopted daughter. While this dynamic may be\nmore complicated than the typical \u201cmodern\u201d family, its elements may resonate\nwith many of today\u2019s viewers. \u201cThe families on the shows aren't as idealistic, but\nthey remain relatable,\u201d states television critic Maureen Ryan. \u201cThe most\nsuccessful shows, comedies especially, have families that you can look at and see\nparts of your family in them\u201d (Respers France 2010).\nSummary\nSociologists view marriage and families as societal institutions that help create the\nbasic unit of social structure. Both marriage and a family may be defined\ndifferently\u2014and practiced differently\u2014in cultures across the world.

According to 2010 census data, only 66 percent of children under\nseventeen years old live in a household with two married parents. This is a\ndecrease from 77 percent in 1980 (U.S. Census 2011). This two-parent family\nstructure is known as a nuclear family, referring to married parents and children\nas the nucleus, or core, of the group. Recent years have seen a rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married. Three percent of children\nlive with two cohabiting parents (U.S. Census 2011).\nMore than one quarter of U.S. children live in a single-parent household. (Photo\ncourtesy of Ross Griff/flickr)\nSingle Parents\nSingle-parent households are on the rise. In 2010, 27 percent of children lived\nwith a single parent only, up from 25 percent in 2008. Of that 27 percent, 23\npercent live with their mother and three percent live with their father. Ten\npercent of children living with their single mother and 20 percent of children\nliving with their single father also live with the cohabitating partner of their\nparent (for example, boyfriends or girlfriends).\nStepparents are an additional family element in two-parent homes. Among\nchildren living in two-parent households, 9 percent live with a biological or\nadoptive parent and a stepparent. The majority (70 percent) of those children live\nwith their biological mother and a stepfather. Family structure has been shown to\nvary with the age of the child. Older children (fifteen to seventeen years old) are less likely to live with two parents than adolescent children (six to fourteen years\nold) or young children (zero to five years old). Older children who do live with two\nparents are also more likely to live with stepparents (U.S. Census 2011).\nIn some family structures a parent is not present at all. In 2010, three million\nchildren (4 percent of all children) lived with a guardian who was neither their\nbiological nor adoptive parent. Of these children, 54 percent live with\ngrandparents, 21 percent live with other relatives, and 24 percent live with\nnonrelatives. This family structure is referred to as the extended family, and may\ninclude aunts, uncles, and cousins living in the same home. Foster parents\naccount for about a quarter of nonrelatives. The practice of grandparents acting\nas parents, whether alone or in combination with the child\u2019s parent, is becoming\nwidespread among today\u2019s families (De Toledo and Brown 1995). Nine percent of\nall children live with a grandparent, and in nearly half those cases, the\ngrandparent maintains primary responsibility for the child (U.S. Census 2011). A\ngrandparent functioning as the primary care provider often results from parental\ndrug abuse, incarceration, or abandonment. Events like these can render the\nparent incapable of caring for his or her child.\nChanges in the traditional family structure raise questions about how such\nsocietal shifts affect children. U.S. Census statistics have long shown that children\nliving in homes with both parents grow up with more financial and educational\nadvantages than children who are raised in single-parent homes (U.S. Census\n1997). Parental marital status seems to be a significant indicator of advancement\nin a child\u2019s life. Children living with a divorced parent typically have more\nadvantages than children living with a parent who never married; this is\nparticularly true of children who live with divorced fathers. This correlates with\nthe statistic that never-married parents are typically younger, have fewer years of\nschooling, and have lower incomes (U.S. Census 1997). Six in ten children living\nwith only their mother live near or below the poverty level. Of those being raised\nby single mothers, 69 percent live in or near poverty compared to 45 percent for\ndivorced mothers (U.S. Census 1997). Though other factors such as age and\neducation play a role in these differences, it can be inferred that marriage\nbetween parents is generally beneficial for children.\nCohabitation Living together before or in lieu of marriage is a growing option for many couples.\nCohabitation, when a man and woman live together in a sexual relationship\nwithout being married, was practiced by an estimated 7.5 million people (11.5\npercent of the population) in 2011, which shows an increase of 13 percent since\n2009 (U.S. Census 2010). This surge in cohabitation is likely due to the decrease in\nsocial stigma pertaining to the practice. In a 2010 National Center for Health\nStatistics survey, only 38 percent of the 13,000-person sample thought that\ncohabitation negatively impacted society (Jayson 2010). Of those who cohabitate,\nthe majority are non-Hispanic with no high school diploma or GED and grew up in\na single-parent household (U.S. Census 2010).\nCohabitating couples may choose to live together in an effort to spend more time\ntogether or to save money on living costs. Many couples view cohabitation as a\n\u201ctrial run\u201d for marriage. Today, approximately 28 percent of men and women\ncohabitated before their first marriage. By comparison, 18 percent of men and 23\npercent of women married without ever cohabitating (U.S. Census Bureau 2010).\nThe vast majority of cohabitating relationships eventually result in marriage; only\n15 percent of men and women cohabitate only and do not marry. About one half\nof cohabitators transition into marriage within three years (U.S. Census 2010).\nWhile couples may use this time to \u201cwork out the kinks\u201d of a relationship before\nthey wed, the most recent research has found that cohabitation has little effect\non the success of a marriage. In fact, those who do not cohabitate before\nmarriage have slightly better rates of remaining married for more than ten years\n(Jayson 2010). Cohabitation may contribute to the increase in the number of men\nand women who delay marriage. The median age for marriage is the highest it has\never been since the U.S. Census kept records\u2014age twenty-six for women and age\ntwenty-eight for men (U.S. Census 2010). As shown by this graph of marital status percentages among young adults, more\nyoung people are choosing to delay or opt out of marriage. (U.S. Census Bureau,\n2000 Census and American Community Survey)\nSame-Sex Couples\nThe number of same-sex couples has grown significantly in the past decade. The\nU.S. Census Bureau reported 594,000 same-sex couple households in the United\nStates, a 50 percent increase from 2000. This increase is a result of more coupling,\nthe growing social acceptance of homosexuality, and a subsequent increase in\nwillingness to report it. Nationally, same-sex couple households make up 1\npercent of the population, ranging from as little as 0.29 percent in Wyoming to\n4.01 percent in the District of Columbia (U.S. Census 2011). Legal recognition of\nsame-sex couples as spouses is different in each state, as only six states and the\nDistrict of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. The 2010 U.S. Census,\nhowever, allowed same-sex couples to report as spouses regardless of whether\ntheir state legally recognizes their relationship. Nationally, 25 percent of all same-\nsex households reported that they were spouses. In states where same-sex\nmarriages are performed, nearly half (42.4 percent) of same-sex couple\nhouseholds were reported as spouses. In terms of demographics, same-sex couples are not very different from opposite-\nsex couples. Same-sex couple households have an average age of 52 and an\naverage household income of $91,558; opposite-sex couple households have an\naverage age of 59 and an average household income of $95,075. Additionally, 31\npercent of same-sex couples are raising children, not far from the 43 percent of\nopposite-sex couples (U.S. Census 2009). Of the children in same-sex couple\nhouseholds, 73 percent are biological children (of only one of the parents), 21\npercent are adopted only, and 6 percent are a combination of biological and\nadopted (U.S. Census 2009).\nWhile there is some concern from socially conservative groups regarding the well-\nbeing of children who grow up in same-sex households, research reports that\nsame-sex parents are as effective as opposite-sex parents. In an analysis of 81\nparenting studies, sociologists found no quantifiable data to support the notion\nthat opposite-sex parenting is any better than same-sex parenting. Children of\nlesbian couples, however, were shown to have slightly lower rates of behavioral\nproblems and higher rates of self-esteem (Biblarz and Stacey 2010).\nStaying Single\nGay or straight, a new option for many people in the United States is simply to\nstay single. In 2010, there were 99.6 million unmarried individuals over age\neighteen in the United States, accounting for 44 percent of the total adult\npopulation (U.S. Census 2011). In 2010, never-married individuals in the twenty-\nfive to twenty-nine age bracket accounted for 62 percent of women and 48\npercent of men, up from 11 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in 1970 (U.S.\nCensus 2011). Single, or never-married, individuals are found in higher\nconcentrations in large cities or metropolitan areas, with New York City being one\nof the highest.\nAlthough both single men and single women report social pressure to get\nmarried, women are subject to greater scrutiny. Single women are often\nportrayed as unhappy \u201cspinsters\u201d or \u201cold maids\u201d who cannot find a man to marry\nthem. Single men, on the other hand, are typically portrayed as lifetime bachelors\nwho cannot settle down or simply \u201chave not found the right girl.\u201d Single women\nreport feeling insecure and displaced in their families when their single status is\ndisparaged (Roberts 2007). However, single women older than thirty-five years\nold report feeling secure and happy with their unmarried status, as many women in this category have found success in their education and careers. In general,\nwomen feel more independent and more prepared to live a large portion of their\nadult lives without a spouse or domestic partner than they did in the 1960s\n(Roberts 2007).\nThe decision to marry or not to marry can be based a variety of factors including\nreligion and cultural expectations. Asian individuals are the most likely to marry\nwhile African Americans are the least likely to marry (Venugopal 2011).\nAdditionally, individuals who place no value on religion are more likely to be\nunmarried than those who place a high value on religion. For black women,\nhowever, the importance of religion made no difference in marital status (Bakalar\n2010). In general, being single is not a rejection of marriage; rather, it is a lifestyle\nthat does not necessarily include marriage. By age forty, according to census\nfigures, 20 percent of women and 14 of men will have never married (U.S. Census\nBureau 2011).\nMore and more people in the United States are choosing lifestyles that don\u2019t\ninclude marriage. (Photo courtesy of Glenn Harper/flickr)\nDECEPTIVE DIVORCE RATES\nIt is often cited that half of all marriages end in divorce. This statistic has made\nmany people cynical when it comes to marriage, but it is misleading. Let\u2019s take a\ncloser look at the data. Using National Center for Health Statistics data from 2003 that show a marriage\nrate of 7.5 (per 1000 people) and a divorce rate of 3.8, it would appear that\nexactly one half of all marriages failed (Hurley 2005). This reasoning is deceptive,\nhowever, because instead of tracing actual marriages to see their longevity (or\nlack thereof), this compares what are unrelated statistics: that is, the number of\nmarriages in a given year does not have a direct correlation to the divorces\noccurring that same year. Research published in the New York Times took a\ndifferent approach\u2014determining how many people had ever been married, and\nof those, how many later divorced. The result? According to this analysis, U.S.\ndivorce rates have only gone as high as 41 percent (Hurley 2005). Another way to\ncalculate divorce rates would be through a cohort study. For instance, we could\ndetermine the percentage of marriages that are intact after, say, five or seven\nyears, compared to marriages that have ended in divorce after five or seven\nyears. Sociological researchers must remain aware of research methods and how\nstatistical results are applied. As illustrated, different methodologies and different\ninterpretations can lead to contradictory, and even misleading, results.\nTheoretical Perspectives on Marriage and Family\nSociologists study families on both the macro and micro level to determine how\nfamilies function. Sociologists may use a variety of theoretical perspectives to\nexplain events that occur within and outside of the family.\nFunctionalism\nWhen considering the role of family in society, functionalists uphold the notion\nthat families are an important social institution and that they play a key role in\nstabilizing society. They also note that family members take on status roles in a\nmarriage or family. The family\u2014and its members\u2014perform certain functions that\nfacilitate the prosperity and development of society.\nSociologist George Murdock conducted a survey of 250 societies and determined\nthat there are four universal residual functions of the family: sexual, reproductive,\neducational, and economic (Lee 1985). According to Murdock, the family (which\nfor him includes the state of marriage) regulates sexual relations between\nindividuals. He does not deny the existence or impact of premarital or\nextramarital sex, but states that the family offers a socially legitimate sexual outlet for adults (Lee 1985). This outlet gives way to reproduction, which is a\nnecessary part of ensuring the survival of society.\nOnce children are produced, the family plays a vital role in training them for adult\nlife. As the primary agent of socialization and enculturation, the family teaches\nyoung children the ways of thinking and behaving that follow social and cultural\nnorms, values, beliefs, and attitudes. Parents teach their children manners and\ncivility. A well-mannered child reflects a well-mannered parent.\nParents also teach children gender roles. Gender roles are an important part of\nthe economic function of a family. In each family, there is a division of labor that\nconsists of instrumental and expressive roles. Men tend to assume the\ninstrumental roles in the family, which typically involve work outside of the family\nthat provides financial support and establishes family status. Women tend to\nassume the expressive roles, which typically involve work inside of the family\nwhich provides emotional support and physical care for children (Crano and\nAronoff 1978). According to functionalists, the differentiation of the roles on the\nbasis of sex ensures that families are well balanced and coordinated. When family\nmembers move outside of these roles, the family is thrown out of balance and\nmust recalibrate in order to function properly. For example, if the father assumes\nan expressive role such as providing daytime care for the children, the mother\nmust take on an instrumental role such as gaining paid employment outside of\nthe home in order for the family to maintain balance and function.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theorists are quick to point out that U.S. families have been defined as\nprivate entities, the consequence of which has been to leave family matters to\nonly those within the family. Many people in the United States are resistant to\ngovernment intervention in the family: parents do not want the government to\ntell them how to raise their children or to become involved in domestic issues.\nConflict theory highlights the role of power in family life and contends that the\nfamily is often not a haven but rather an arena where power struggles can occur.\nThis exercise of power often entails the performance of family status roles.\nConflict theorists may study conflicts as simple as the enforcement of rules from\nparent to child, or they may examine more serious issues such as domestic\nviolence (spousal and child), sexual assault, marital rape, and incest. The first study of marital power was performed in 1960. Researchers found that\nthe person with the most access to value resources held the most power. As\nmoney is one of the most valuable resources, men who worked in paid labor\noutside of the home held more power than women who worked inside the home\n(Blood and Wolfe 1960). Conflict theorists find disputes over the division of\nhousehold labor to be a common source of marital discord. Household labor\noffers no wages and, therefore, no power. Studies indicate that when men do\nmore housework, women experience more satisfaction in their marriages,\nreducing the incidence of conflict (Coltrane 2000). In general, conflict theorists\ntend to study areas of marriage and life that involve inequalities or discrepancies\nin power and authority, as they are reflective of the larger social structure.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nInteractionists view the world in terms of symbols and the meanings assigned to\nthem (LaRossa and Reitzes 1993). The family itself is a symbol. To some, it is a\nfather, mother, and children; to others, it is any union that involves respect and\ncompassion. Interactionists stress that family is not an objective, concrete reality.\nLike other social phenomena, it is a social construct that is subject to the ebb and\nflow of social norms and ever-changing meanings.\nConsider the meaning of other elements of family: \u201cparent\u201d was a symbol of a\nbiological and emotional connection to a child; with more parent-child\nrelationships developing through adoption, remarriage, or change in\nguardianship, the word \u201cparent\u201d today is less likely to be associated with a\nbiological connection than with whoever is socially recognized as having the\nresponsibility for a child\u2019s upbringing. Similarly, the terms \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d\nare no longer rigidly associated with the meanings of caregiver and breadwinner.\nThese meanings are more free-flowing through changing family roles.\nInteractionists also recognize how the family status roles of each member are\nsocially constructed, playing an important part in how people perceive and\ninterpret social behavior. Interactionists view the family as a group of role players\nor \u201cactors\u201d that come together to act out their parts in an effort to construct a\nfamily. These roles are up for interpretation. In the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century, a \u201cgood father,\u201d for example, was one who worked hard to\nprovide financial security for his children. Today, a \u201cgood father\u201d is one who takes the time outside of work to promote his children\u2019s emotional well-being, social\nskills, and intellectual growth\u2014in some ways, a much more daunting task.\nSummary\nPeople's concepts of marriage and family in the United States are changing.\nIncreases in cohabitation, same-sex partners, and singlehood are altering of our\nideas of marriage. Similarly, single parents, same-sex parents, cohabitating\nparents, and unwed parents are changing our notion of what it means to be a\nfamily. While most children still live in opposite-sex, two-parent, married\nhouseholds, that is no longer viewed as the only type of nuclear family.\nGlossary\nextended family\na household that includes at least one parent and child as well as other\nrelatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins\nnuclear family\ntwo parents (traditionally a married husband and wife) and children living\nin the same household\nFurther Research\nFor more statistics on marriage and family, see the Forum on Child and Family\nStatistics at http://openstaxcollege.org/l/child_family_statistics, as well as the\nAmerican Community Survey, the Current Population Survey, and the U.S. Census\ndecennial survey at http://openstaxcollege.org/l/US_Census.\nReferences\nBakalar, Nicholas. 2010. \u201cEducation, Faith, and a Likelihood to Wed.\u201d New York Times, March 22.

Challenges Families Face\nDerived from Challenges Families Face by OpenStax\nAs the structure of family changes over time, so do the challenges families face.\nEvents like divorce and remarriage present new difficulties for families and\nindividuals. Other long-standing domestic issues such as abuse continue to strain\nthe health and stability of today\u2019s families.\nDivorce and Remarriage\nDivorce, while fairly common and accepted in modern U.S. society, was once a\nword that would only be whispered and was accompanied by gestures of\ndisapproval. In 1960, divorce was generally uncommon, affecting only 9.1 out of\nevery 1,000 married persons. That number more than doubled (to 20.3) by 1975\nand peaked in 1980 at 22.6 (Popenoe 2007). Over the last quarter century,\ndivorce rates have dropped steadily and are now similar to those in 1970. The\ndramatic increase in divorce rates after the 1960s has been associated with the\nliberalization of divorce laws, as well as the shift in societal makeup due to\nwomen increasingly entering the workforce (Michael 1978). The decrease in\ndivorce rates can be attributed to two probable factors: an increase in the age at\nwhich people get married, and an increased level of education among those who\nmarry\u2014both of which have been found to promote greater marital stability.\nDivorce does not occur equally among all people in the United States; some\nsegments of the U.S. population are more likely to divorce than others. According\nthe American Community Survey (ACS), men and women in the Northeast have\nthe lowest rates of divorce at 7.2 and 7.5 per 1,000 people. The South has the\nhighest rate of divorce at 10.2 for men and 11.1 for women. Divorce rates are\nlikely higher in the South because marriage rates are higher and marriage occurs\nat younger-than-average ages in this region. In the Northeast, the marriage rate is\nlower and first marriages tend to be delayed; therefore, the divorce rate is lower\n(U.S. Census Bureau 2011).\nThe rate of divorce also varies by race. In a 2009 ACS study, American Indian and\nAlaskan Natives reported the highest percentages of currently divorced\nindividuals (12.6 percent) followed by blacks (11.5 percent), whites (10.8 percent),\nPacific Islanders (8 percent), Latinos (7.8 percent) and Asians (4.9 percent) (ACS 2011). In general those who marry at a later age and have a college education\nhave lower rates of divorce.\nProvisional number of divorces and annulments and rate: United States, 2000\u2013\n2011There has been a steady decrease in divorce over the past decade.

While more young people are choosing to postpone or\nopt out of marriage, those who enter into the union do so with the expectation\nthat it will last. A great deal of marital problems can be related to stress,\nespecially financial stress. According to researchers participating in the University\nof Virginia\u2019s National Marriage Project, couples who enter marriage without a\nstrong asset base (like a home, savings, and a retirement plan) are 70 percent\nmore likely to be divorced after three years than are couples with at least $10,000\nin assets. This is connected to factors such as age and education level that\ncorrelate with low incomes.\nThe addition of children to a marriage creates added financial and emotional\nstress. Research has established that marriages enter their most stressful phase\nupon the birth of the first child (Popenoe and Whitehead 2007). This is particularly true for couples who have multiples (twins, triplets, and so on).\nMarried couples with twins or triplets are 17 percent more likely to divorce than\nthose with children from single births (McKay 2010). Another contributor to the\nlikelihood of divorce is a general decline in marital satisfaction over time. As\npeople get older, they may find that their values and life goals no longer match up\nwith those of their spouse (Popenoe and Whitehead 2004).\nDivorce is thought to have a cyclical pattern. Children of divorced parents are 40\npercent more likely to divorce than children of married parents. And when we\nconsider children whose parents divorced and then remarried, the likelihood of\ntheir own divorce rises to 91 percent (Wolfinger 2005). This might result from\nbeing socialized to a mindset that a broken marriage can be replaced rather than\nrepaired (Wolfinger 2005). That sentiment is also reflected in the finding that\nwhen both partners of a married couple have been previously divorced, their\nmarriage is 90 percent more likely to end in divorce (Wolfinger 2005).\nA study from Radford University indicated that bartenders are among the\nprofessions with the highest divorce rates (38.4 percent). Other traditionally low-\nwage industries (like restaurant service, custodial employment, and factory work) are also associated with higher divorce rates. (Aamodt and McCoy 2010). (Photo\ncourtesy of Daniel Lobo/flickr)\nPeople in a second marriage account for approximately 19.3 percent of all\nmarried persons, and those who have been married three or more times account\nfor 5.2 percent (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). The vast majority (91 percent) of\nremarriages occur after divorce; only 9 percent occur after death of a spouse\n(Kreider 2006). Most men and women remarry within five years of a divorce, with\nthe median length for men (three years) being lower than for women (4.4 years).\nThis length of time has been fairly consistent since the 1950s. The majority of\nthose who remarry are between the ages of twenty-five and forty-four (Kreider\n2006). The general pattern of remarriage also shows that whites are more likely\nto remarry than black Americans.\nMarriage the second time around (or third or fourth) can be a very different\nprocess than the first. Remarriage lacks many of the classic courtship rituals of a\nfirst marriage. In a second marriage, individuals are less likely to deal with issues\nlike parental approval, premarital sex, or desired family size (Elliot 2010). In a\nsurvey of households formed by remarriage, a mere 8 percent included only\nbiological children of the remarried couple. Of the 49 percent of homes that\ninclude children, 24 percent included only the woman\u2019s biological children, 3\npercent included only the man\u2019s biological children, and 9 percent included a\ncombination of both spouse\u2019s children (U.S. Census Bureau 2006).\nChildren of Divorce and Remarriage\nDivorce and remarriage can been stressful on partners and children alike. Divorce\nis often justified by the notion that children are better off in a divorced family\nthan in a family with parents who do not get along. However, long-term studies\ndetermine that to be generally untrue. Research suggests that while marital\nconflict does not provide an ideal childrearing environment, going through a\ndivorce can be damaging. Children are often confused and frightened by the\nthreat to their family security. They may feel responsible for the divorce and\nattempt to bring their parents back together, often by sacrificing their own well-\nbeing (Amato 2000). Only in high-conflict homes do children benefit from divorce\nand the subsequent decrease in conflict. The majority of divorces come out of\nlower-conflict homes, and children from those homes are more negatively\nimpacted by the stress of the divorce than the stress of unhappiness in the marriage (Amato 2000). Studies also suggest that stress levels for children are not\nimproved when a child acquires a stepfamily through marriage. Although there\nmay be increased economic stability, stepfamilies typically have a high level of\ninterpersonal conflict (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994).\nChildren\u2019s ability to deal with a divorce may depend on their age. Research has\nfound that divorce may be most difficult for school-aged children, as they are old\nenough to understand the separation but not old enough to understand the\nreasoning behind it. Older teenagers are more likely to recognize the conflict that\nled to the divorce but may still feel fear, loneliness, guilt, and pressure to choose\nsides. Infants and preschool-age children may suffer the heaviest impact from the\nloss of routine that the marriage offered (Temke 2006).\nProximity to parents also makes a difference in a child\u2019s well-being after divorce.\nBoys who live or have joint arrangements with their fathers show less aggression\nthan those who are raised by their mothers only. Similarly, girls who live or have\njoint arrangements with their mothers tend to be more responsible and mature\nthan those who are raised by their fathers only. Nearly three-fourths of the\nchildren of parents who are divorced live in a household headed by their mother,\nleaving many boys without a father figure residing in the home (U.S. Census\nBureau 2011b). Still, researchers suggest that a strong parent-child relationship\ncan greatly improve a child\u2019s adjustment to divorce (Temke 2006).\nThere is empirical evidence that divorce has not discouraged children in terms of\nhow they view marriage and family. A blended family has additional stress\nresulting from yours/mine/ours children. The blended family also has a ex-parent\nthat has different discipline techniques. In a survey conducted by researchers\nfrom the University of Michigan, about three-quarters of high school seniors said\nit was \u201cextremely important\u201d to have a strong marriage and family life. And over\nhalf believed it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that they would be in a lifelong marriage\n(Popenoe and Whitehead 2007). These numbers have continued to climb over the\nlast twenty-five years.\nViolence and Abuse\nViolence and abuse are among the most disconcerting of the challenges that\ntoday\u2019s families face. Abuse can occur between spouses, between parent and\nchild, as well as between other family members. The frequency of violence among families is a difficult to determine because many cases of spousal abuse and child\nabuse go unreported. In any case, studies have shown that abuse (reported or\nnot) has a major impact on families and society as a whole.\nDomestic Violence\nDomestic violence is a significant social problem in the United States. It is often\ncharacterized as violence between household or family members, specifically\nspouses. To include unmarried, cohabitating, and same-sex couples, family\nsociologists have created the term intimate partner violence (IPV). Women are\nthe primary victims of intimate partner violence. It is estimated that one in four\nwomen has experienced some form of IPV in her lifetime (compared to one in\nseven men) (Catalano 2007). IPV may include physical violence, such as punching,\nkicking, or other methods of inflicting physical pain; sexual violence, such as rape\nor other forced sexual acts; threats and intimidation that imply either physical or\nsexual abuse; and emotional abuse, such as harming another\u2019s sense of self-worth\nthrough words or controlling another\u2019s behavior. IPV often starts as emotional\nabuse and then escalates to other forms or combinations of abuse (Centers for\nDisease Control 2012). Thirty percent of women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partner.\nWhat does this statistic reveal about societal patterns and norms concerning\nintimate relationships and gender roles? (Photo courtesy of Kathy Kimpel/flickr)\nIn 2010, of IPV acts that involved physical actions against women, 57 percent\ninvolved physical violence only; 9 percent involved rape and physical violence; 14\npercent involved physical violence and stalking; 12 percent involved rape, physical\nviolence, and stalking; and 4 percent involved rape only (CDC 2011). This is vastly\ndifferent than IPV abuse patterns for men, which show that nearly all (92 percent)\nphysical acts of IVP take the form of physical violence and fewer than 1 percent\ninvolve rape alone or in combination (Catalano 2007). IPV affects women at\ngreater rates than men because women often take the passive role in\nrelationships and may become emotionally dependent on their partners.\nPerpetrators of IPV work to establish and maintain such dependence in order to\nhold power and control over their victims, making them feel stupid, crazy, or\nugly\u2014in some way worthless. IPV affects different segments of the population at different rates. The rate of IPV\nfor black women (4.6 per 1,000 persons over the age of twelve) is higher than that\nfor white women (3.1). These numbers have been fairly stable for both racial\ngroups over the last ten years. However, the numbers have steadily increased for\nNative Americans and Alaskan Natives (up to 11.1 for females) (Catalano 2007).\nThose who are separated report higher rates of abuse than those with other\nmarital statuses, as conflict is typically higher in those relationships. Similarly,\nthose who are cohabitating are more likely than those who are married to\nexperience IPV (Stets and Straus 1990). Other researchers have found that the\nrate of IPV doubles for women in low-income disadvantaged areas when\ncompared to IPV experienced by women who reside in more affluent areas\n(Benson and Fox 2004). Overall, women ages twenty to twenty-four are at the\ngreatest risk of nonfatal abuse (Catalano 2007).\nAccurate statistics on IPV are difficult to determine, as it is estimated that more\nthan half of nonfatal IPV goes unreported. It is not until victims choose to report\ncrimes that patterns of abuse are exposed. Most victims studied stated that abuse\nhad occurred for at least two years prior to their first report (Carlson, Harris, and\nHolden 1999).\nSometimes abuse is reported to police by a third party, but it still may not be\nconfirmed by victims. A study of domestic violence incident reports found that\neven when confronted by police about abuse, 29 percent of victims denied that\nabuse occurred. Surprisingly, 19 percent of their assailants were likely to admit to\nabuse (Felson, Ackerman, and Gallagher 2005). According to the National Criminal\nVictims Survey, victims cite varied reasons why they are reluctant to report abuse,\nas shown in the table below.\nThis chart shows reasons that victims give for why they fail to report abuse to\npolice authorities (Catalano 2007).\nReason Abuse Is Unreported % Females % Males This chart shows reasons that victims give for why they fail to report abuse to\npolice authorities (Catalano 2007).\nReason Abuse Is Unreported % Females % Males\nConsidered a Private Matter 22 39\nFear of Retaliation 12 5\nTo Protect the Abuser 14 16\nBelief That Police Won\u2019t Do Anything 8 8\nTwo-thirds of nonfatal IPV occurs inside of the home and approximately 10\npercent occurs at the home of the victim\u2019s friend or neighbor. The majority of\nabuse takes place between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., and nearly half (42\npercent) involves alcohol or drug use (Catalano 2007). Many perpetrators of IVP\nblame alcohol or drugs for their abuse, though studies have shown that alcohol\nand drugs do not cause IPV, they may only lower inhibitions (Hanson 2011). IPV\nhas significant long-term effects on individual victims and on society. Studies have\nshown that IPV damage extends beyond the direct physical or emotional wounds.\nExtended IPV has been linked to unemployment among victims, as many have\ndifficulty finding or holding employment. Additionally, nearly all women who\nreport serious domestic problems exhibit symptoms of major depression\n(Goodwin, Chandler, and Meisel 2003).\nFemale victims of IPV are also more likely to abuse alcohol or drugs, suffer from\neating disorders, and attempt suicide (Silverman et al. 2001). IPV is indeed\nsomething that impacts more than just intimate partners. In a survey, 34 percent\nof respondents said they have witnessed IPV, and 59 percent said that they know\na victim personally (Roper Starch Worldwide 1995). Many people want to help IPV\nvictims but are hesitant to intervene because they feel that it is a personal matter or they fear retaliation from the abuser\u2014reasons similar to those of victims who\ndo not report IPV.\nChild Abuse\nChildren are among the most helpless victims of abuse. In 2010, there were more\nthan 3.3 million reports of child abuse involving an estimated 5.9 million children\n(Child Help 2011). Three-fifths of child abuse reports are made by professionals,\nincluding teachers, law enforcement personnel, and social services staff. The rest\nare made by anonymous sources, other relatives, parents, friends, and neighbors.\nChild abuse may come in several forms, the most common being neglect (78.3\npercent), followed by physical abuse (10.8 percent), sexual abuse (7.6 percent),\npsychological maltreatment (7.6 percent), and medical neglect (2.4 percent)\n(Child Help 2011). Some children suffer from a combination of these forms of\nabuse. The majority (81.2 percent) of perpetrators are parents; 6.2 percent are\nother relatives.\nInfants (children less than one year old) were the most victimized population with\nan incident rate of 20.6 per 1,000 infants. This age group is particularly vulnerable\nto neglect because they are entirely dependent on parents for care. Some parents\ndo not purposely neglect their children; factors such as cultural values, standard\nof care in a community, and poverty can lead to hazardous level of neglect. If\ninformation or assistance from public or private services are available and a\nparent fails to use those services, child welfare services may intervene (U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services). The Casey Anthony trial, in which Casey was ultimately acquitted of murder\ncharges against her daughter, Caylee, created public outrage and brought to light\nissues of child abuse and neglect across the United States. (Photo courtesy of\nBruce Tuten/flickr)\nInfants are also often victims of physical abuse, particularly in the form of violent\nshaking. This type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken-baby syndrome,\nwhich describes a group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal\nhemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing impact to an infant\u2019s\nhead. A baby\u2019s cry is the number one trigger for shaking. Parents may find\nthemselves unable to soothe a baby\u2019s concerns and may take their frustration out\non the child by shaking him or her violently. Other stress factors such as a poor\neconomy, unemployment, and general dissatisfaction with parental life may\ncontribute this type of abuse. While there is no official central registry of shaken-\nbaby syndrome statistics, it is estimated that each year 1,400 babies die or suffer\nserious injury from being shaken (Barr 2007).\nCORPORAL PUNISHMENT\nPhysical abuse in children may come in the form of beating, kicking, throwing,\nchoking, hitting with objects, burning, or other methods. Injury inflicted by such\nbehavior is considered abuse even if the parent or caregiver did not intend to\nharm the child. Other types of physical contact that are characterized as discipline (spanking, for example) are not considered abuse as long as no injury results\n(Child Welfare Information Gateway 2008).\nThis issue is rather controversial among modern-day people in the United States.\nWhile some parents feel that physical discipline, or corporal punishment, is an\neffective way to respond to bad behavior, others feel that it is a form of abuse.\nAccording to a poll conducted by ABC News, 65 percent of respondents approve\nof spanking and 50 percent said that they sometimes spank their child.\nTendency toward physical punishment may be affected by culture and education.\nThose who live in the South are more likely than those who live in other regions\nto spank their child. Those who do not have a college education are also more\nlikely to spank their child (Crandall 2011). Currently, 23 states officially allow\nspanking in the school system; however, many parents may object and school\nofficials must follow a set of clear guidelines when administering this type of\npunishment (Crandall 2011). Studies have shown that spanking is not an effective\nform of punishment and may lead to aggression by the victim, particularly in\nthose who are spanked at a young age (Berlin 2009).\nChild abuse occurs at all socioeconomic and education levels and crosses ethnic\nand cultural lines. Just as child abuse is often associated with stresses felt by\nparents, including financial stress, parents who demonstrate resilience to these\nstresses are less likely to abuse (Samuels 2011). Young parents are typically less\ncapable of coping with stresses, particularly the stress of becoming a new parent.\nTeenage mothers are more likely to abuse their children than their older\ncounterparts. As a parent\u2019s age increases, the risk of abuse decreases. Children\nborn to mothers who are fifteen years old or younger are twice as likely to be\nabused or neglected by age five than are children born to mothers ages twenty to\ntwenty-one (George and Lee 1997).\nDrug and alcohol use is also a known contributor to child abuse. Children raised\nby substance abusers have a risk of physical abuse three times greater than other\nkids, and neglect is four times as prevalent in these families (Child Welfare\nInformation Gateway 2011). Other risk factors include social isolation, depression,\nlow parental education, and a history of being mistreated as a child.\nApproximately 30 percent of abused children will later abuse their own children\n(Child Welfare Information Gateway 2006). The long-term effects of child abuse impact the physical, mental, and emotional\nwellbeing of a child. Injury, poor health, and mental instability occur at a high rate\nin this group, with 80 percent meeting the criteria of one or more psychiatric\ndisorders, such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal behavior, by age twenty-one.\nAbused children may also suffer from cognitive and social difficulties. Behavioral\nconsequences will affect most, but not all, of child abuse victims. Children of\nabuse are 25 percent more likely, as adolescents, to suffer from difficulties like\npoor academic performance and teen pregnancy, or to engage in behaviors like\ndrug abuse and general delinquency. They are also more likely to participate in\nrisky sexual acts that increase their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted\ndisease (Child Welfare Information Gateway 2006). Other risky behaviors include\ndrug and alcohol abuse. As these consequences can affect the health care,\neducation, and criminal systems, the problems resulting from child abuse do not\njust belong to the child and family, but to society as a whole.\nSummary\nToday\u2019s families face a variety of challenges, specifically to marital stability. While\ndivorce rates have decreased in the last twenty-five years, many family members,\nespecially children, still experience the negative effects of divorce. Children are\nalso negatively impacted by violence and abuse within the home, with nearly 6\nmillion children abused each year.\nGlossary\nintimate partner violence (IPV)\nviolence that occurs between individuals who maintain a romantic or sexual\nrelationship\nshaken-baby syndrome\na group of medical symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal\nhemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or impacting an infant\u2019s head Further Research\nTo find more information on child abuse, visit the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services web site at http://openstaxcollege.org/l/child_welfare to review\ndocuments provided by the Child Welfare Information Gateway.\nReferences\nAmato, Paul. 2000. \u201cWhat Children Learn From Divorce.\u201d Journal of Family Issues 21(8):1061\u20131086.\nAmerican Community Survey. 2011. \u201cMarital Events of Americans: 2009.\u201d The U.S. Census Bureau.

Diener\nUniversity of Utah\nThis module focuses on parenthood as a developmental task of adulthood.\nParents take on new roles as their children develop, transforming their identity as\na parent as the developmental demands of their children change. The main\ninfluences on parenting, parent characteristics, child characteristics, and\ncontextual factors, are described.\nLearning Objectives Identify and describe the stages of parenthood.\nIdentify and describe the influences on parenting.\nThe Development of Parents\nThink back to an emotional event you experienced as a child. How did your\nparents react to you? Did your parents get frustrated or criticize you, or did they\nact patiently and provide support and guidance? Did your parents provide lots of\nrules for you or let you make decisions on your own? Why do you think your\nparents behaved the way they did?\nPsychologists have attempted to answer these questions about the influences on\nparents and understand why parents behave the way they do. Because parents\nare critical to a child\u2019s development, a great deal of research has been focused on\nthe impact that parents have on children. Less is known, however, about the\ndevelopment of parents themselves and the impact of children on parents.\nNonetheless, parenting is a major role in an adult\u2019s life. Parenthood is often\nconsidered a normative developmental task of adulthood. Cross-cultural studies\nshow that adolescents around the world plan to have children. In fact, most men\nand women in the United States will become parents by the age of 40 years\n(Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012). People have children for many reasons,\nincluding emotional reasons (e.g., the emotional bond with children and the\ngratification the parent\u2013child relationship brings), economic and utilitarian\nreasons (e.g., children provide help in the family and support in old age), and\nsocial-normative reasons (e.g., adults are expected to have children; children\nprovide status) (Nauck, 2007). Parenthood has a huge impact on a person's identity, emotions, daily behaviors,\nand many other aspects of their lives. [Image: Kim881231, CC0 Public\nDomain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nParenthood is undergoing changes in the United States and elsewhere in the\nworld. Children are less likely to be living with both parents, and women in the\nUnited States have fewer children than they did previously. The average fertility\nrate of women in the United States was about seven children in the early 1900s\nand has remained relatively stable at 2.1 since the 1970s (Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2011; Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012). Not only are parents having\nfewer children, the context of parenthood has also changed. Parenting outside of\nmarriage has increased dramatically among most socioeconomic, racial, and\nethnic groups, although college-educated women are substantially more likely to\nbe married at the birth of a child than are mothers with less education (Dye,\n2010). Parenting is occurring outside of marriage for many reasons, both\neconomic and social. People are having children at older ages, too. Despite the\nfact that young people are more often delaying childbearing, most 18- to 29-year-\nolds want to have children and say that being a good parent is one of the most\nimportant things in life (Wang & Taylor, 2011).\nTable 1. Demographic Changes in Parenthood in the United States 1. Ventura &\nBachrach, 1999 2. Martinez, Daniels, & Chandra, 2012 3. Hamilton, Martin, &\nVentura, 2012 4. Cohn, Passel, Wang, & Livingston, 2011 5. U.S. Decennial Census\n(1890-2000). 6. Wetzel, J. R. (1990).\nGalinsky (1987) was one of the first to emphasize the development of parents\nthemselves, how they respond to their children\u2019s development, and how they\ngrow as parents. Parenthood is an experience that transforms one\u2019s identity as\nparents take on new roles. Children\u2019s growth and development force parents to\nchange their roles. They must develop new skills and abilities in response to\nchildren\u2019s development. Galinsky identified six stages of parenthood that focus on\ndifferent tasks and goals (see Table 2). Table 2. Galinsky\u2019s Stages of Parenthood\n1. The Image-Making Stage\nAs prospective parents think about and form images about their roles as parents\nand what parenthood will bring, and prepare for the changes an infant will bring,\nthey enter the image-making stage. Future parents develop their ideas about\nwhat it will be like to be a parent and the type of parent they want to be.\nIndividuals may evaluate their relationships with their own parents as a model of\ntheir roles as parents.\n2. The Nurturing Stage\nThe second stage, the nurturing stage, occurs at the birth of the baby. A parent\u2019s\nmain goal during this stage is to develop an attachment relationship to their baby.\nParents must adapt their romantic relationships, their relationships with their\nother children, and with their own parents to include the new infant. Some\nparents feel attached to the baby immediately, but for other parents, this occurs\nmore gradually. Parents may have imagined their infant in specific ways, but they\nnow have to reconcile those images with their actual baby. In incorporating their\nrelationship with their child into their other relationships, parents often have to reshape their conceptions of themselves and their identity. Parenting\nresponsibilities are the most demanding during infancy because infants are\ncompletely dependent on caregiving.\n3. The Authority Stage\nThe authority stage occurs when children are 2 years old until about 4 or 5 years\nold. In this stage, parents make decisions about how much authority to exert over\ntheir children\u2019s behavior. Parents must establish rules to guide their child\u2019s\nbehavior and development. They have to decide how strictly they should enforce\nrules and what to do when rules are broken.\n4. The Interpretive Stage\nThe interpretive stage occurs when children enter school (preschool or\nkindergarten) to the beginning of adolescence. Parents interpret their children\u2019s\nexperiences as children are increasingly exposed to the world outside the family.\nParents answer their children\u2019s questions, provide explanations, and determine\nwhat behaviors and values to teach. They decide what experiences to provide\ntheir children, in terms of schooling, neighborhood, and extracurricular activities.\nBy this time, parents have experience in the parenting role and often reflect on\ntheir strengths and weaknesses as parents, review their images of parenthood,\nand determine how realistic they have been. Parents have to negotiate how\ninvolved to be with their children, when to step in, and when to encourage\nchildren to make choices independently.\n5. The Interdependent Stage\nParents of teenagers are in the interdependent stage. They must redefine their\nauthority and renegotiate their relationship with their adolescent as the children\nincreasingly make decisions independent of parental control and authority. On\nthe other hand, parents do not permit their adolescent children to have complete\nautonomy over their decision-making and behavior, and thus adolescents and\nparents must adapt their relationship to allow for greater negotiation and\ndiscussion about rules and limits. 6. The Departure Stage\nDuring the departure stage of parenting, parents evaluate the entire experience\nof parenting. They prepare for their child\u2019s departure, redefine their identity as\nthe parent of an adult child, and assess their parenting accomplishments and\nfailures. This stage forms a transition to a new era in parents\u2019 lives. This stage\nusually spans a long time period from when the oldest child moves away (and\noften returns) until the youngest child leaves. The parenting role must be\nredefined as a less central role in a parent\u2019s identity.\nDespite the interest in the development of parents among lay people and helping\nprofessionals, little research has examined developmental changes in parents\u2019\nexperience and behaviors over time. Thus, it is not clear whether these\ntheoretical stages are generalizable to parents of different races, ages, and\nreligions, nor do we have empirical data on the factors that influence individual\ndifferences in these stages. On a practical note, how-to books and websites\ngeared toward parental development should be evaluated with caution, as not all\nadvice provided is supported by research. When a child achieves a new level of independence and leaves the home it marks\nanother turning point in the identity of a parent.

There are many reasons that parents behave the way they do. The\nmultiple influences on parenting are still being explored. Proposed influences on\nparental behavior include 1) parent characteristics, 2) child characteristics, and 3)\ncontextual and sociocultural characteristics (Belsky, 1984; Demick, 1999) (see\nFigure 1).\nParent Characteristics\nParents bring unique traits and qualities to the parenting relationship that affect\ntheir decisions as parents. These characteristics include the age of the parent,\ngender, beliefs, personality, developmental history, knowledge about parenting\nand child development, and mental and physical health. Parents\u2019 personalities\naffect parenting behaviors. Mothers and fathers who are more agreeable,\nconscientious, and outgoing are warmer and provide more structure to their\nchildren. Parents who are more agreeable, less anxious, and less negative also\nsupport their children\u2019s autonomy more than parents who are anxious and less\nagreeable (Prinzie, Stams, Dekovic, Reijntjes, & Belsky, 2009). Parents who have\nthese personality traits appear to be better able to respond to their children\npositively and provide a more consistent, structured environment for their\nchildren.\nParents\u2019 developmental histories, or their experiences as children, also affect\ntheir parenting strategies. Parents may learn parenting practices from their own\nparents. Fathers whose own parents provided monitoring, consistent and age-\nappropriate discipline, and warmth were more likely to provide this constructive\nparenting to their own children (Kerr, Capaldi, Pears, & Owen, 2009). Patterns of\nnegative parenting and ineffective discipline also appear from one generation to\nthe next. However, parents who are dissatisfied with their own parents\u2019 approach\nmay be more likely to change their parenting methods with their own children. Child Characteristics\nA child with a difficult temperament can have a significant impact on a parent.\n[Image: Harald Groven, https://goo.gl/cwemLg, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/eH69he]\nParenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents affect their children, children\ninfluence their parents. Child characteristics, such as gender, birth\norder, temperament, and health status, affect parenting behaviors and roles. For\nexample, an infant with an easy temperament may enable parents to feel more\neffective, as they are easily able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and cooing.\nOn the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant elicits fewer positive reactions from\nhis or her parents and may result in parents feeling less effective in the parenting\nrole (Eisenberg et al., 2008). Over time, parents of more difficult children may\nbecome more punitive and less patient with their children (Clark, Kochanska, &\nReady, 2000; Eisenberg et al., 1999; Kiff, Lengua, & Zalewski, 2011). Parents who have a fussy, difficult child are less satisfied with their marriages and have greater\nchallenges in balancing work and family roles (Hyde, Else-Quest, & Goldsmith,\n2004). Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that influences\nhow parents behave with their children.\nAnother child characteristic is the gender of the child. Parents respond differently\nto boys and girls. Parents often assign different household chores to their sons\nand daughters. Girls are more often responsible for caring for younger siblings\nand household chores, whereas boys are more likely to be asked to perform\nchores outside the home, such as mowing the lawn (Grusec, Goodnow, & Cohen,\n1996). Parents also talk differently with their sons and daughters, providing more\nscientific explanations to their sons and using more emotion words with their\ndaughters (Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, & Allen, 2001).\nContextual Factors and Sociocultural Characteristics\nThe parent\u2013child relationship does not occur in isolation. Sociocultural\ncharacteristics, including economic hardship, religion, politics, neighborhoods,\nschools, and social support, also influence parenting. Parents who experience\neconomic hardship are more easily frustrated, depressed, and sad, and these\nemotional characteristics affect their parenting skills (Conger & Conger, 2002).\nCulture also influences parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although\npromoting the development of skills necessary to function effectively in one\u2019s\ncommunity is a universal goal of parenting, the specific skills necessary vary\nwidely from culture to culture. Thus, parents have different goals for their\nchildren that partially depend on their culture (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008). For\nexample, parents vary in how much they emphasize goals for independence and\nindividual achievements, and goals involving maintaining harmonious\nrelationships and being embedded in a strong network of social relationships.\nThese differences in parental goals are influenced by culture and by immigration\nstatus. Other important contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood,\nschool, and social networks, also affect parenting, even though these settings\ndon\u2019t always include both the child and the parent (Brofenbrenner, 1989). For\nexample, Latina mothers who perceived their neighborhood as more dangerous\nshowed less warmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater stress\nassociated with living a threatening environment (Gonzales et al., 2011). Many\ncontextual factors influence parenting. Figure 1. Influences on Parenting\nConclusion\nMany factors influence parenting decisions and behaviors. These factors include\ncharacteristics of the parent, such as gender and personality, as well as\ncharacteristics of the child, such as age. The context is also important. The\ninteraction among all these factors creates many different patterns of parenting\nbehavior. Furthermore, parenting influences not just a child\u2019s development, but\nalso the development of the parent. As parents are faced with new challenges,\nthey change their parenting strategies and construct new aspects of their identity.\nThe goals and tasks of parents change over time as their children develop.\nOutside Resources\nArticle: \u201cIs a Child's Behavior Always a Reflection of His Parents?\u201d - This article is\nwritten by Dr. Peggy Drexler and discusses the notion that child behavior is not\nalways a reflection of parenting.\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-drexler/is-a-childs-behavior-\nalwa_b_1886367.html Article: \u201cParent behavior toward first and second children\u201d - This journal article\ndescribes how parents behave differently and the same with their first and\nsecond born children.

The Changing Family\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cHelp for Domestic Violence Victims Declining,\u201d the headline said. In Georgia,\ndonations and other financial assistance to battered women\u2019s shelters were\ndwindling because of the faltering economy. This decreased funding was forcing\nthe shelters to cut back their hours and lay off employees. As Meg Rogers, the\nhead of a shelter with a six-month waiting list explained, \u201cWe are having to make\nsome very tough decisions.\u201d\nReflecting her experience, shelters in Georgia had to turn away more than 2,600\nwomen and their children in the past year because of lack of space. Many women\nhad to return to the men who were abusing them. This situation troubled Rogers.\n\u201cI think their safety is being compromised,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may go to the\nabuser\u2019s family even if they don\u2019t go back to the abuser.\u201d A domestic violence\nsurvivor also worried about their fate and said she owed her own life to a\nwomen\u2019s shelter: \u201cI love them to this day and I\u2019m alive because of them.\u201d\nSource: Simmons, 2011\nOnce upon a time, domestic violence did not exist, or so the popular television\nshows of the 1950s would have had us believe. Neither did single-parent\nhouseholds, gay couples, interracial couples, mothers working outside the home,\nheterosexual spouses deciding not to have children, or other family forms and\nsituations that are increasingly common today. Domestic violence existed, of\ncourse, but it was not something that television shows and other popular media\nback then depicted. The other family forms and situations also existed to some\ndegree but have become much more common today. Families shown in today\u2019s television shows are very different from the traditional\nfamily depicted in popular television shows of the 1950s. Television families from\nthe 1950s consisted of two heterosexual parents, with the father working outside\nthe home and the mother staying at home with two or more wholesome children.\nThe Bees Knees Daily \u2013 Cast photo of the Cleaver Family from \u201cLeave It To\nBeaver\u201d \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.\nThe 1950s gave us Leave It to Beaver and other television shows that depicted\nloving, happy, \u201ctraditional\u201d families living in the suburbs. The father worked\noutside the home, the mother stayed at home to take care of the kids and do\nhousework, and their children were wholesome youngsters who rarely got into\ntrouble and certainly did not use drugs or have sex. Today we have ABC\u2019s Modern\nFamily, which features one traditional family (two heterosexual parents and their\nthree children) and two nontraditional families (one with an older white man and\na younger Latina woman and her child, and another with two gay men and their\nadopted child). Many other television shows today and in recent decades have\nfeatured divorced couples or individuals, domestic violence, and teenagers doing\ndrugs or committing crime. In the real world, we hear that parents are too busy working at their jobs to raise\ntheir kids properly. We hear of domestic violence as in the story from Georgia at\nthe start of this chapter. We hear of kids living without fathers, because their\nparents are divorced or never were married in the first place. We hear of young\npeople having babies, using drugs, and committing violence. We hear that the\nbreakdown of the nuclear family, the entrance of women into the labor force, and\nthe growth of single-parent households are responsible for these problems. Some\nobservers urge women to work only part-time or not at all so they can spend\nmore time with their children. Some yearn wistfully for a return to the 1950s,\nwhen everything seemed so much easier and better. Children had what they\nneeded back then: one parent to earn the money, and another parent to take\ncare of them full time until they started kindergarten, when this parent would be\nthere for them when they came home from school.\nFamilies have indeed changed, but this yearning for the 1950s falls into what\nhistorian Stephanie Coontz (2000) calls the \u201cnostalgia trap.\u201d The 1950s television\nshows did depict what some families were like back then, but they failed to show\nwhat many other families were like. Moreover, the changes in families since that\ntime have probably not had all the harmful effects that many observers allege.\nHistorical and cross-cultural evidence even suggests that the Leave It to Beaver-\nstyle family of the 1950s was a relatively recent and atypical phenomenon and\nthat many other types of families can thrive just as well as the 1950s television\nfamilies did.\nThis chapter expands on these points and looks at today\u2019s families and the\nchanges they have undergone. It also examines some of the controversies and\nproblems now surrounding families and relationships.\nReferences\nCoontz, S. (2000). The way we never were: American families and the nostalgia trap.

Overview of the Family\nLearning Objectives:\nDescribe why many children throughout history have not lived in a nuclear family.\nUnderstand the status of the nuclear family in the United States since the colonial\nperiod.\nDescribe the major marriage and family arrangements in the United States today.\nA family is a group of two or more people who are related by blood, marriage,\nadoption, or a mutual commitment and who care for one another. Defined in this\nway, the family is universal or nearly universal: Some form of the family has\nexisted in every society, or nearly every society, that we know about (Starbuck,\n2010). Yet it is also true that many types of families have existed, and the cross-\ncultural and historical record indicates that these different forms of the family can\nall \u201cwork\u201d: They provide practical and emotional support for their members and\nthey socialize their children.\nIt is important to keep this last statement in mind, because Americans until the\nlast few decades thought of only one type of family, and that is the nuclear family:\nA married heterosexual couple and their young children living by themselves\nunder one roof. The nuclear family has existed in most societies with which\nscholars are familiar. An extended family, which consists of parents, their\nchildren, and other relatives, has a nuclear family at its core and was quite\ncommon in prehistoric societies. Many one-parent families begin as (two-parent)\nnuclear families that dissolve upon divorce or separation or, more rarely, the\ndeath of one of the parents. In recent decades, one-parent families have become\nmore common in the United States because of divorce and births out of wedlock,\nbut they were actually very common throughout most of human history because\nmany spouses died early in life and because many babies were born out of\nwedlock. Although the nuclear family is a common family arrangement today, historically\nmany children lived with only one parent because spouses died early and many\nbabies were born out of wedlock.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAlthough many prehistoric societies featured nuclear families, a few societies\nstudied by anthropologists have not had them. In these societies, a father does\nnot live with a woman after she has his child and sees them either irregularly or\nnot at all. Despite the absence of a father and the lack of a nuclear family, this\ntype of family arrangement seems to have worked well in these societies. In\nparticular, children are cared for and grow up to be productive members of their\nsocieties (Smith, 1996).\nThese examples do not invalidate the fact that nuclear families are almost\nuniversal. But they do indicate that the functions of the nuclear family can be\nachieved through other family arrangements. If that is true, perhaps the oft-cited\nconcern over the \u201cbreakdown\u201d of the 1950s-style nuclear family in modern\nAmerica is at least somewhat undeserved. As indicated by the examples just given, children can and do thrive without two parents. To say this is meant\nneither to extol divorce, births out of wedlock, and fatherless families nor to\nminimize the problems they may involve. Rather, it is meant simply to indicate\nthat the nuclear family is not the only viable form of family organization\n(Seccombe, 2012).\nIn fact, although nuclear families remain the norm in most societies, in practice\nthey are something of a historical rarity: Until about a century ago, many spouses\ndied by their mid-forties, and many babies were born out of wedlock. In medieval\nEurope, for example, people died early from disease, malnutrition, and other\nproblems. One consequence of early mortality was that many children could\nexpect to outlive at least one of their parents and thus essentially were raised in\none-parent families or in stepfamilies (Gottlieb, 1993).\nDuring the American colonial period, different family types abounded, and the\nnuclear family was by no means the only type (Coontz, 1995). Nomadic Native\nAmerican groups had relatively small nuclear families, while nonnomadic groups\nhad larger extended families. Because nuclear families among African Americans\nslaves were difficult to achieve, slaves adapted by developing extended families,\nadopting orphans, and taking in other people not related by blood or marriage.\nMany European parents of colonial children died because average life expectancy\nwas only 45 years. The one-third to one-half of children who outlived at least one\nof their parents lived in stepfamilies or with just their surviving parent. Mothers\nwere so busy working the land and doing other tasks that they devoted relatively\nlittle time to child care, which instead was entrusted to older children or servants.\nMoving much forward in US history, an important change in American families\noccurred during the 1940s after World War II ended. As men came home after\nserving in the military in Europe and Japan, books, magazines, and newspapers\nexhorted women to have babies, and babies they did have: People got married at\nyounger ages and the birth rate soared, resulting in the now famous baby boom\ngeneration. Meanwhile, divorce rates dropped. The national economy thrived as\nauto and other factory jobs multiplied, and many families for the first time could\ndream of owning their own homes. Suburbs sprang up, and many families moved\nto them. Many families during the 1950s did indeed fit the Leave It to\nBeaver model of the breadwinner-homemaker suburban nuclear family. Following\nthe Depression of the 1930s and the war of the 1940s, the 1950s seemed an\nalmost idyllic decade. Even so, less than 60 percent of American children during the 1950s lived in\nbreadwinner-homemaker nuclear families. Moreover, many lived in poverty, as\nthe poverty rate then was almost twice as high as it is today. Teenage pregnancy\nrates were about twice as high as today. Although not publicized back then,\nalcoholism and violence in families were common. Historians have found that\nmany women in this era were unhappy with their homemaker roles, Mrs. Cleaver\n(Beaver\u2019s mother) to the contrary, suffering from what Betty Friedan (1963)\nfamously called the \u201cfeminine mystique.\u201d\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, women began to enter the labor force. They did so\nto increase their families\u2019 incomes and to achieve greater self-fulfillment. More\nthan 60 percent of married women with children under 6 years of age are now in\nthe labor force, compared to less than 19 percent in 1960. At about the same\ntime, divorce rates increased for several reasons that we examine later in this\nchapter. Changes in the American family had begun, and along with them various\ncontroversies and problems.\nMarriage and the Family in the United States Today\nIn the United States today, marriage remains an important institution. Only about\n27 percent of all adults (18 or older) have never been married, 56 percent are\ncurrently married, 10 percent are divorced, and 6 percent are widowed\n(see Figure 10.1 \u201cMarital Status of the US Population 18 Years of Age or Older,\n2010\u201d). Thus 72 percent of American adults have been married, whether or not\nthey are currently married. Because more than half of the never-married people\nare under 30, it is fair to say that many of them will be getting married sometime\nin the future. When we look just at people aged 45\u201354, about 87 percent are\ncurrently married or had been married at some point in their lives. In a 2010 poll,\nonly 5 percent of Americans under age 30 said they did not want to get married\n(Luscombe, 2010). These figures all indicate that marriage continues to be an\nimportant ideal in American life, even if not all marriages succeed. As one\nsociologist has said, \u201cGetting married is a way to show family and friends that you\nhave a successful personal life. It\u2019s like the ultimate merit badge\u201d (Luscombe,\n2010).\nAlthough marriage remains an important institution, two recent trends do suggest\nthat its importance is declining for some segments of the population (Cohn,\nPassel, Wang, & Livingston, 2011). First, although 71 percent of adults have been married, this figure represents a drop from 85 percent in 1960. Second, education\ngreatly affects whether we marry and stay married, and marriage is less common\namong people without a college degree.\nFigure 10.1 Marital Status of the US Population 18 Years of Age or Older, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United\nStates: 2012. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nRecent figures provide striking evidence of this relationship. Almost two-thirds (64\npercent) of college graduates are currently married, compared to less than half\n(47 percent) of high school graduates and high school dropouts combined. People\nwith no more than a high school degree are less likely than college graduates to\nmarry at all, and they are more likely to get divorced, as we shall discuss again\nlater, if they do marry. This difference in marriage rates worsens the financial situation that people with\nlower education already face. As one observer noted, \u201cAs marriage increasingly\nbecomes a phenomenon of the better-off and better-educated, the incomes of\ntwo-earner married couples diverge more from those of struggling single adults\u201d\n(Marcus, 2011). One of the many consequences of this education gap in marriage\nis that the children of one-parent households are less likely than those of two-\nparent households to graduate high school and to attend college. In this manner,\na parent\u2019s low education helps to perpetuate low education among the parent\u2019s\nchildren.\nThe United States Compared to Other Democracies\nIn several ways, the United States differs from other Western democracies in its\nview of marriage and in its behavior involving marriage and other intimate\nrelationships (Cherlin, 2010; Hull, Meier, & Ortyl, 2012). First, Americans place\nmore emphasis than their Western counterparts on the ideal of romantic love as a\nbasis for marriage and other intimate relationships and on the cultural\nimportance of marriage. Second, the United States has higher rates of marriage\nthan other Western nations. Third, the United States also has higher rates of\ndivorce than other Western nations; for example, 42 percent of American\nmarriages end in divorce after fifteen years, compared to only 8 percent in Italy\nand Spain. Fourth, Americans are much more likely than other Western citizens to\nremarry once they are divorced, to cohabit in short-term relationships, and, in\ngeneral, to move from one intimate relationship to another, a practice\ncalled serial monogamy. This practice leads to instability that can have negative\nimpacts on any children that may be involved and also on the adults involved. Americans place more emphasis than Europeans on the ideal of romantic love as\nthe basis for marriage. This emphasis helps account for why the United States has\na higher divorce rate than many European nations.\nKen Witherow \u2013 Digimem Studio Photo Shoot \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe US emphasis on romantic love helps account for its high rates of marriage,\ndivorce, and serial monogamy. It leads people to want to be in an intimate\nrelationship, marital or cohabiting. Then when couples get married because they\nare in love, many quickly find that passionate romantic love can quickly fade;\nbecause their expectations of romantic love were so high, they become more\ndisenchanted once this happens and unhappy in their marriage. As sociologist\nAndrew J. Cherlin (2010, p. 4) observes, \u201cAmericans are conflicted about lifelong\nmarriage: they value the stability and security of marriage, but they tend to\nbelieve that individuals who are unhappy with their marriages should be allowed\nto end them.\u201d Still, the ideal of romantic love persists even after divorce, leading\nto remarriage and/or other intimate relationships.\nChildren and Families\nThe United States has about 36 million families with children under 18. About 70\npercent of these are married-couple families, while 30 percent (up from about 14\npercent in the 1950s) are one-parent families. Most of these latter families are\nheaded by the mother (see Figure 10.2 \u201cFamily Households with Children under\n18 Years of Age, 2010\u201d). Figure 10.2 Family Households with Children under 18 Years of Age, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United\nStates: 2012. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nThe proportion of families with children under 18 that have only one parent varies\nsignificantly by race and ethnicity: Latino and African American families are more\nlikely than white and Asian American households to have only one parent\n(see Figure 10.3 \u201cRace, Ethnicity, and Percentage of Family Groups with Only One\nParent, 2010\u201d). Similarly, whereas 30 percent of all children do not live with both\ntheir biological parents, this figure, too, varies by race and ethnicity: about 61\npercent of African American children, 15 percent of Asian children, 33 percent of\nLatino children, and 23 percent of non-Latino white children. Figure 10.3 Race, Ethnicity, and Percentage of Family Groups with Only One\nParent, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United\nStates: 2012. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nWe will discuss several other issues affecting children later in this chapter. But\nbefore we move on, it is worth noting that children, despite all the joy and\nfulfillment they so often bring to parents, also tend to reduce parents\u2019 emotional\nwell-being. As a recent review summarized the evidence, \u201cParents in the United\nStates experience depression and emotional distress more often than their\nchildless adult counterparts. Parents of young children report far more\ndepression, emotional distress and other negative emotions than non-parents,\nand parents of grown children have no better well-being than adults who never\nhad children\u201d (Simon, 2008, p. 41).\nChildren have these effects because raising them can be both stressful and\nexpensive. Depending on household income, the average child costs parents\nbetween $134,000 and $270,000 from birth until age 18. College education\nobviously can cost tens of thousands of dollars beyond that. Robin W. Simon\n(2008) argues that American parents\u2019 stress would be reduced if the government\nprovided better and more affordable day care and after-school options, flexible\nwork schedules, and tax credits for various parenting costs. She also thinks that\nthe expectations Americans have of the joy of parenthood are unrealistically positive and that parental stress would be reduced if expectations became more\nrealistic.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlthough the nuclear family has been very common, many children throughout\nhistory have not lived in a nuclear family, in part because a parent would die at an\nearly age.\nMost Americans eventually marry. This fact means that marriage remains an\nimportant ideal in American life, even if not all marriages succeed.\nAbout 30 percent of children live with only one parent, almost always their\nmother.\nReferences\nCherlin, A.

Sociological Perspectives on the Family\nLearning Objective:\nSummarize understandings of the family as presented by functional, conflict, and\nsocial interactionist theories.\nSociological views on today\u2019s families and their problems generally fall into the\nfunctional, conflict, and social interactionist approaches introduced in Chapter 1\n\u201cUnderstanding Social Problems\u201d. Let\u2019s review these views, which are\nsummarized in Table 10.1 \u201cTheory Snapshot\u201d.\nTable 10.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nThe family performs several essential functions for society. It\nsocializes children, it provides emotional and practical support\nfor its members, it helps regulate sexual activity and sexual\nFunctionalism reproduction, and it provides its members with a social identity.\nFamily problems stem from sudden or far-reaching changes in\nthe family\u2019s structure or processes; these problems threaten\nthe family\u2019s stability and weaken society.\nThe family contributes to social inequality by reinforcing\neconomic inequality and by reinforcing patriarchy. Family\nConflict theory problems stem from economic inequality and from patriarchal\nideology. The family can also be a source of conflict, including\nphysical violence and emotional cruelty, for its own members.\nThe interaction of family members and intimate couples\ninvolves shared understandings of their situations. Wives and\nSymbolic\nhusbands have different styles of communication, and social\ninteractionism\nclass affects the expectations that spouses have of their\nmarriages and of each other. Family problems stem from\ndifferent understandings and expectations that spouses have of Theoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\ntheir marriage.\nSocial Functions of the Family\nRecall that the functional perspective emphasizes that social institutions perform\nseveral important functions to help preserve social stability and otherwise keep a\nsociety working. A functional understanding of the family thus stresses the ways\nin which the family as a social institution helps make society possible. As such, the\nfamily performs several important functions.\nFirst, the family is the primary unit for socializing children. No society is possible\nwithout adequate socialization of its young. In most societies, the family is the\nmajor unit in which socialization happens. Parents, siblings, and, if the family is\nextended rather than nuclear, other relatives all help socialize children from the\ntime they are born.\nOne of the most important functions of the family is the socialization of children.\nIn most societies the family is the major unit through which socialization occurs.\nColleen Kelly \u2013 Kids Playing Monopoly Chicago \u2013 CC BY 2.0. Second, the family is ideally a major source of practical and emotional support for\nits members. It provides them food, clothing, shelter, and other essentials, and it\nalso provides them love, comfort, and help in times of emotional distress, and\nother types of support.\nThird, the family helps regulate sexual activity and sexual reproduction. All\nsocieties have norms governing with whom and how often a person should have\nsex. The family is the major unit for teaching these norms and the major unit\nthrough which sexual reproduction occurs. One reason for this is to ensure that\ninfants have adequate emotional and practical care when they are born.\nFourth, the family provides its members with a social identity. Children are born\ninto their parents\u2019 social class, race and ethnicity, religion, and so forth. Some\nchildren have advantages throughout life because of the social identity they\nacquire from their parents, while others face many obstacles because the social\nclass or race/ethnicity into which they are born is at the bottom of the social\nhierarchy.\nBeyond discussing the family\u2019s functions, the functional perspective on the family\nmaintains that sudden or far-reaching changes in conventional family structure\nand processes threaten the family\u2019s stability and thus that of society. For\nexample, most sociology and marriage-and-family textbooks during the 1950s\nmaintained that the male breadwinner\u2013female homemaker nuclear family was\nthe best arrangement for children, as it provided for a family\u2019s economic and\nchild-rearing needs. Any shift in this arrangement, they warned, would harm\nchildren and, by extension, the family as a social institution and even society\nitself. Textbooks no longer contain this warning, but many conservative observers\ncontinue to worry about the impact on children of working mothers and one-\nparent families. We return to their concerns shortly.\nThe Family and Conflict\nConflict theorists agree that the family serves the important functions just listed,\nbut they also point to problems within the family that the functional perspective\nminimizes or overlooks altogether.\nFirst, the family as a social institution contributes to social inequality. Because\nfamilies pass along their wealth to their children, and because families differ\ngreatly in the amount of wealth they have, the family helps reinforce existing\ninequality. As it developed through the centuries, and especially during industrialization, the family also became more and more of a patriarchal unit\n(since men made money working in factories while women stayed home), helping\nto reinforce men\u2019s status at the top of the social hierarchy.\nSecond, the family can also be a source of conflict for its own members. Although\nthe functional perspective assumes the family provides its members emotional\ncomfort and support, many families do just the opposite and are far from the\nharmonious, happy groups depicted in the 1950s television shows. Instead, they\nargue, shout, and use emotional cruelty and physical violence. We return to\nfamily violence later in this chapter.\nThe conflict perspective emphasizes that many of the problems we see in today\u2019s\nfamilies stem from economic inequality and from patriarchy. The problems that\nmany families experience reflect the fact that they live in poverty or near poverty.\nMoney does not always bring happiness, but a dire lack of money produces stress\nand other difficulties that impair a family\u2019s functioning and relationships.\nThe Note 10.9 \u201cApplying Social Research\u201d box discusses other ways in which social\nclass influences the family.\nConflict within a family also stems from patriarchy. Husbands usually earn more\nmoney than wives, and many men continue to feel that they are the head of their\nfamilies. When women resist this old-fashioned notion, spousal conflict occurs.\nApplying Social Research\nSocial Class and the Family\nA growing amount of social science research documents social class differences in\nhow well a family functions: the quality of its relationships and the cognitive,\npsychological, and social development of its children. This focus reflects the fact\nthat what happens during the first months and years of life may have profound\neffects on how well a newborn prospers during childhood, adolescence, and\nbeyond. To the extent this is true, the social class differences that have been\nfound have troublesome implications.\nAccording to sociologist Frank E. Furstenberg Jr., \u201csteep differences exist across\nsocial classes\u201d in mothers\u2019 prenatal experiences, such as the quality of their diet\nand health care, as well as in the health care that their infants receive. As a result,\nhe says, \u201cchildren enter the world endowed unequally.\u201d This inequality worsens\nafter they are born for several reasons. First, low-income families are much more likely to experience negative events,\nsuch as death, poor health, unemployment, divorce, and criminal victimization.\nWhen these negative events do occur, says Furstenberg, \u201csocial class affects a\nfamily\u2019s ability to cushion their blow\u2026Life is simply harder and more brutish at the\nbottom.\u201d These negative events produce great amounts of stress; as Chapter 2\n\u201cPoverty\u201d discussed, this stress in turn causes children to experience various\ndevelopmental problems.\nSecond, low-income parents are much less likely to read and speak regularly to\ntheir infants and young children, who thus are slower to develop cognitive and\nreading skills; this problem in turn impairs their school performance when they\nenter elementary school.\nThird, low-income parents are also less able to expose their children to cultural\nexperiences (e.g., museum visits) outside the home, to develop their talents in the\narts and other areas, and to otherwise be involved in the many nonschool\nactivities that are important for a child\u2019s development. In contrast, wealthier\nparents keep their children very busy in these activities in a pattern that\nsociologist Annette Lareau calls concerted cultivation. These children\u2019s\ninvolvement in these activities provides them various life skills that help enhance\ntheir performance in school and later in the workplace.\nFourth, low-income children grow up in low-income neighborhoods, which often\nhave inadequate schools and many other problems, including toxins such as lead\npaint, that impair a child\u2019s development. In contrast, says Furstenberg, children\nfrom wealthier families \u201care very likely to attend better schools and live in better\nneighborhoods. It is as if the playing field for families is tilted in ways that are\nbarely visible to the naked eye.\u201d\nFifth, low-income families are less able to afford to send a child to college, and\nthey are more likely to lack the social contacts that wealthier parents can use to\nhelp their child get a good job after college.\nFor all these reasons, social class profoundly shapes how children fare from\nconception through early adulthood and beyond. Because this body of research\ndocuments many negative consequences of living in a low-income family, it\nreinforces the need for wide-ranging efforts to help such families.\nSources: Bandy, Andrews, & Moore, 2012; Furstenberg, 2010; Lareau, 2010 Families and Social Interaction\nSocial interactionist perspectives on the family examine how family members and\nintimate couples interact on a daily basis and arrive at shared understandings of\ntheir situations. Studies grounded in social interactionism give us a keen\nunderstanding of how and why families operate the way they do.\nSome studies, for example, focus on how husbands and wives communicate and\nthe degree to which they communicate successfully (Tannen, 2001). A classic\nstudy by Mirra Komarovsky (1964) found that wives in blue-collar marriages liked\nto talk with their husbands about problems they were having, while husbands\ntended to be quiet when problems occurred. Such gender differences are less\ncommon in middle-class families, where men are better educated and more\nemotionally expressive than their working-class counterparts, but gender\ndifferences in communication still exist in these families. Another classic study by\nLillian Rubin (1976) found that wives in middle-class families say that ideal\nhusbands are ones who communicate well and share their feelings, while wives in\nworking-class families are more apt to say that ideal husbands are ones who do\nnot drink too much and who go to work every day.\nAccording to the symbolic interactionist perspective, family problems often stem\nfrom the different understandings, perceptions, and expectations that spouses\nhave of their marriage and of their family. When these differences become too\nextreme and the spouses cannot reconcile their disagreements, spousal conflict\nand possibly divorce may occur (Kaufman & Taniguchi, 2006).\nKey Takeaways\nThe family ideally serves several functions for society. It socializes children,\nprovides practical and emotional support for its members, regulates sexual\nreproduction, and provides its members with a social identity.\nReflecting conflict theory\u2019s emphases, the family may also produce several\nproblems. In particular, it may contribute for several reasons to social inequality,\nand it may subject its members to violence, arguments, and other forms of\nconflict.\nSocial interactionist understandings of the family emphasize how family members\ninteract on a daily basis. In this regard, several studies find that husbands and wives communicate differently in certain ways that sometimes impede effective\ncommunication.\nReferences\nBandy, T., Andrews, K.M., & Moore, K.A.

The average cohabitation lasts less than two\nyears.\nAmit Gupta \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nAmerican families have undergone many changes since the 1950s. Scholars,\npoliticians, and the public have strong and often conflicting views on the reasons\nfor these changes and on their consequences. We now look at some of the most\nimportant issues affecting US families through the lens of the latest social scientific evidence. Because Chapter 5 \u201cSexual Orientation and Inequality\u201d on\nsexual orientation and inequality discussed same-sex marriage and families,\nplease refer back to that chapter for material on this very important topic.\nCohabitation\nSome people who are not currently married nonetheless cohabit, or live together,\nwith someone of the opposite sex in a romantic relationship. The census reports\nthat about 6 million opposite-sex couples are currently cohabiting; these couples\nconstitute about 10 percent of all opposite-sex couples (married plus unmarried)\nwho live together. The average cohabitation lasts less than two years and ends\nwhen the couple either splits up or gets married; about half of cohabiting couples\ndo marry, and half split up. More than half of people in their twenties and thirties\nhave cohabited, and roughly one-fourth of this age group is currently cohabiting\n(Brown, 2005). Roughly 55 percent of cohabiting couples have no biological\nchildren, about 45 percent live with a biological child of one of the partners, and\n21 percent live with their own biological child. (These figures add to more than\n100 percent because many couples live with their own child and a child of a\npartner.) About 5 percent of children live with biological parents who are\ncohabiting.\nInterestingly, many studies find that married couples who have cohabited with\neach other before getting married are more likely to divorce than married couples\nwho did not cohabit (Jose, O\u2019Leary, & Moyer, 2010). As sociologist Susan L Brown\n(2005, p. 34) notes, this apparent consequence is ironic: \u201cThe primary reason\npeople cohabit is to test their relationship\u2019s viability for marriage. Sorting out bad\nrelationships through cohabitation is how many people think they can avoid\ndivorce. Yet living together before marriage actually increases a couple\u2019s risk of\ndivorce.\u201d Two reasons may account for this result. First, cohabitation may change\nthe relationship between a couple and increase the chance they will divorce if\nthey get married anyway. Second, individuals who are willing to live together\nwithout being married may not be very committed to the idea of marriage and\nthus may be more willing to divorce if they are unhappy in their eventual\nmarriage.\nRecent research compares the psychological well-being of cohabiting and married\nadults and also the behavior of children whose biological parent or parents are\ncohabiting rather than married (Apel & Kaukinen, 2008; Brown, 2005). On average, married adults are happier and otherwise have greater psychological\nwell-being than cohabiting adults, while the latter, in turn, fare better\npsychologically than adults not living with anyone. Research has not yet clarified\nthe reasons for these differences, but it seems that people with the greatest\npsychological and economic well-being are most likely to marry. If this is true, it is\nnot the state of being married per se that accounts for the difference in well-\nbeing between married and cohabiting couples, but rather the extent of well-\nbeing that affects decisions to marry or not marry. Another difference between\ncohabitation and marriage concerns relationship violence. Among young adults\n(aged 18\u201328), this type of violence is more common among cohabiting couples\nthan among married or dating couples. The reasons for this difference remain\nunknown but may again reflect differences in the types of people who choose to\ncohabit (Brown & Bulanda, 2008).\nThe children of cohabiting parents tend to exhibit lower well-being of various\ntypes than those of married parents: They are more likely to engage in\ndelinquency and other antisocial behavior, and they have lower academic\nperformance and worse emotional adjustment. The reasons for these differences\nremain to be clarified but may again stem from the types of people who choose\nto cohabit rather than marry.\nDivorce and Single-Parent Households\nThe US divorce rate has risen since the early 1900s, with several peaks and\nvalleys, and is now the highest in the industrial world. It rose sharply during the\nGreat Depression and World War II, probably because of the economic distress of\nthe former and the family disruption caused by the latter, and fell sharply after\nthe war as the economy thrived and as marriage and family were proclaimed as\npatriotic ideals. It dropped a bit more during the 1950s before rising sharply\nthrough the 1960s and 1970s (Cherlin, 2009). The divorce rate has since declined\nsomewhat (see Figure 10.4 \u201cNumber of Divorces per 1,000 Married Women Aged\n15 or Older, 1960\u20132009\u201d) and today is only slightly higher than its peak at the end\nof World War II. Still, the best estimates say that 40\u201350 percent of all new\nmarriages will one day end in divorce (Teachman, 2008). The surprising\nannouncement in June 2010 of the separation of former vice president Al Gore\nand his wife, Tipper, was a poignant reminder that divorce is a common outcome\nof many marriages. Figure 10.4 Number of Divorces per 1,000 Married Women Aged 15 or Older,\n1960\u20132009\nSource: Data from Wilcox, W. B. (Ed.). (2010). The state of our unions, 2010:\nMarriage in America. Charlottesville, VA: National Marriage Project.\nReasons for Divorce\nWe cannot be certain about why the divorce rate rose so much during the 1960s\nand 1970s, but we can rule out two oft-cited causes. First, there is little reason to\nbelieve that marriages became any less happy during this period. We do not have\ngood data to compare marriages then and now, but the best guess is that marital\nsatisfaction did not decline after the 1950s ended. What did change was that\npeople after the 1950s became more willing to seek divorces in marriages that\nwere already unhappy.\nSecond, although the contemporary women\u2019s movement is sometimes blamed\nfor the divorce rate by making women think marriage is an oppressive institution,\nthe trends in Figure 10.4 \u201cNumber of Divorces per 1,000 Married Women Aged 15\nor Older, 1960\u20132009\u201d suggest this blame is misplaced. The women\u2019s movement\nemerged in the late 1960s and was capturing headlines by the early 1970s.\nAlthough the divorce rate obviously rose after that time, it also started rising\nseveral years before the women\u2019s movement emerged and captured headlines. If\nthe divorce rate began rising before the women\u2019s movement started, it is illogical\nto blame the women\u2019s movement. Instead, other structural and cultural forces must have been at work, just as they were at other times in the last century, as\njust noted, when the divorce rate rose and fell. Why, then, did divorce increase\nduring the 1960s and 1970s? One reason is the increasing economic\nindependence of women. As women entered the labor force in the 1960s and\n1970s, they became more economically independent of their husbands, even if\ntheir jobs typically paid less than their husbands\u2019 jobs. When women in unhappy\nmarriages do become more economically independent, they are more able to\nafford to get divorced than when they have to rely entirely on their husbands\u2019\nearnings (Hiedemann, Suhomlinova, & O\u2019Rand, 1998). When both spouses work\noutside the home, moreover, it is more difficult to juggle the many demands of\nfamily life, and family life can be more stressful. Such stress can reduce marital\nhappiness and make divorce more likely. Spouses may also have less time for each\nother when both are working outside the home, making it more difficult to deal\nwith problems they may be having.\nDisapproval of divorce has declined since the 1950s, and divorce is now\nconsidered a normal if unfortunate part of life.\nJohn C Bullas BSc MSc PhD MCIHT MIAT \u2013 Divorce Cakes a_005 \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND\n2.0. It is also true that disapproval of divorce has declined since the 1950s, even if\nnegative views of it still remain (Cherlin, 2009). Not too long ago, divorce was\nconsidered a terrible thing; now it is considered a normal if unfortunate part of\nlife. We no longer say a bad marriage should continue for the sake of the children.\nWhen New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller ran for president in the early 1960s,\nthe fact that he had been divorced hurt his popularity, but when California\nGovernor Ronald Reagan ran for president less than two decades later, the fact\nthat he had been divorced was hardly noted. Many presidential candidates and\nother politicians today have been divorced. But is the growing acceptability of\ndivorce a cause of the rising divorce rate, or is it the result of the rising divorce\nrate? Or is it both a cause and a result? This important causal order question is\ndifficult to resolve.\nAnother reason divorce rose during the 1960s and 1970s may be that divorces\nbecame easier to obtain legally. In the past, most states required couples to prove\nthat one or both had committed actions such as mental cruelty, adultery, or other\nsuch behaviors in order to get divorced. Today almost all states have no-fault\ndivorce laws that allow a couple to divorce if they say their marriage has failed\nfrom irreconcilable differences. Because divorce has become easier and less\nexpensive to obtain, more divorces occur. But are no-fault divorce laws a cause or\nresult of the post-1950s rise in the divorce rate? The divorce rate increase\npreceded the establishment of most states\u2019 no-fault laws, but it is probably also\ntrue that the laws helped make additional divorces more possible. Thus no-fault\ndivorce laws are probably one reason for the rising divorce rate after the 1950s,\nbut only one reason (Kneip & Bauer, 2009).\nWe have just looked at possible reasons for divorce rate trends, but we can also\nexamine the reasons why certain marriages are more or less likely to end in\ndivorce within a given time period. Although, as noted earlier, 40\u201350 percent of\nall new marriages will probably end in divorce, it is also true that some marriages\nare more likely to end than others. Family scholars identify several correlates of\ndivorce (Clarke-Stewart & Brentano, 2006; Wilcox, 2010). An important one is age\nat marriage: Teenagers who get married are much more likely to get divorced\nthan people who marry well into their twenties or beyond, partly because they\nhave financial difficulties and are not yet emotionally mature. A second correlate\nof divorce is social class: People who are poor and have less formal education at\nthe time of their marriage are much more likely to get divorced than people who\nbegin their marriages in economic comfort and with higher levels of education. Effects of Divorce and Single-Parent Households\nMuch research exists on the effects of divorce on spouses and their children, and\nscholars often disagree on what these effects are. One thing is clear: Divorce\nplunges many women into poverty or near-poverty (Gadalla, 2008; Wilcox, 2010).\nMany have been working only part time or not at all outside the home, and\ndivorce takes away their husband\u2019s economic support. Even women working full\ntime often have trouble making ends meet, because many are in low-paying jobs.\nOne-parent families headed by a woman for any reason are much poorer\n($32,031 in 2010 median annual income) than those headed by a man ($49,718).\nMeanwhile, the median income of married-couple families is much higher\n($72,751). Almost 32 percent of all single-parent families headed by women are\nofficially poor, compared to only about 16 percent of single-parent families\nheaded by men and 6 percent of married-couple families (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor,\n& Smith, 2011).\nAlthough the economic consequences of divorce seem clear, what are the\npsychological consequences for husbands, wives, and their children? Are they\nbetter off if a divorce occurs, worse off, or about the same?\nEffects on Spouses\nThe research evidence for spouses is very conflicting. Many studies find that\ndivorced spouses are, on average, less happy and have poorer mental health after\ntheir divorce, but some studies find that happiness and mental health often\nimprove after divorce (Cherlin, 2009; Waite, Luo, & Lewin, 2009). The postdivorce\ntime period that is studied may affect what results are found: For some people\npsychological well-being may decline in the immediate aftermath of a divorce,\ngiven how difficult the divorce process often is, but rise over the next few years.\nThe contentiousness of the marriage also matters. Some marriages ending in\ndivorce have been filled with hostility, conflict, and sometimes violence, while\nother marriages ending in divorce have not been very contentious at all, even if\nthey have failed. Individuals seem to fare better psychologically after ending a\nvery contentious marriage but fare worse after ending a less contentious\nmarriage (Amato & Hohmann-Marriott, 2007). Effects on Children\nWhat about the children? Parents used to stay together \u201cfor the sake of the\nchildren,\u201d thinking that divorce would cause their children more harm than good.\nStudies of this issue generally find that children in divorced families are indeed\nmore likely, on average, to do worse in school, to use drugs and alcohol and suffer\nother behavioral problems, and to experience emotional distress and other\npsychological problems (Wilcox, 2010). The trauma of the divorce and the\ndifficulties that single parents encounter in caring for and disciplining children are\nthought to account for these effects.\nHowever, two considerations suggest that children of divorce may fare worse for\nreasons other than divorce trauma and the resulting single-parent situation. First,\nmost children whose parents divorce end up living with their mothers. As we just\nnoted, many divorced women and their children live in poverty or near poverty.\nTo the extent that these children fare worse in many ways, their mothers\u2019 low\nincomes may be a contributing factor. Studies of this issue find that divorced\nmothers\u2019 low incomes do, in fact, help explain some of the difficulties that their\nchildren experience (Demo & Fine, 2010). Divorce trauma and single-parenthood\nstill matter for children\u2019s well-being in many of these studies, but the worsened\nfinancial situation of divorced women and their children also makes a difference.\nSecond, it is possible that children do worse after a divorce because of the\nparental conflict that led to the divorce, not because of the divorce itself. It is well\nknown that the quality of the relationship between a child\u2019s parents affects the\nchild\u2019s behavior and emotional well-being (Moore, Kinghorn, & Bandy, 2011). This\nfact raises the possibility that children may fare better if their parents end a\ntroubled marriage than if their parents stay married. Recent studies have\ninvestigated this issue, and their findings generally mirror the evidence for\nspouses just cited: Children generally fare better if their parents end a highly\ncontentious marriage, but they fare worse if their parents end a marriage that has\nnot been highly contentious (Hull et al., 2012). As one researcher summarizes this\nnew body of research, \u201cAll these new studies have discovered the same thing: The\naverage impact of divorce in society at large is to neither increase nor decrease\nthe behavior problems of children. They suggest that divorce, in and of itself, is\nnot the cause of the elevated behavior problems we see in children of divorce\u201d (Li, 2010, p. 174). Commenting on divorces from highly contentious marriages,\nsociologist Virginia E. Rutter (2010, p. 169) bluntly concludes, \u201cThere are times\nand situations when divorce is beneficial to the people who divorce and to their\nchildren.\u201d\nFathers and Children\nRecall that most children whose parents are not married, either because they\ndivorced or because they never were married, live with their mothers. Another\nfactor that affects how children in these situations fare is the closeness of the\nchild-father relationship. Whether or not children live with their fathers, they fare\nbetter in many respects when they have an emotionally close relationship with\ntheir fathers. This type of relationship is certainly more possible when they live\nwith their fathers, and this is a reason that children who live with both their\nparents fare better on average than children who live only with their mother.\nHowever, some children who do live with their fathers are less close to them than\nsome children who live apart from their fathers.\nRecent research by sociologist Alan Booth and colleagues (Booth, Scott, & King,\n2010) found that the former children fare worse than the latter children. As Booth\net al. (2010, p. 600) summarize this result, \u201cWe find that adolescents who are\nclose to their nonresident fathers report higher self-esteem, less delinquency, and\nfewer depressive symptoms than adolescents who live with a father with whom\nthey are not close. It appears that adolescents benefit more from a close bond to\na nonresident father than a weak bond to a resident father.\u201d To the extent this is\ntrue, they add, \u201cyouth are not always better off in two-parent families.\u201d In fact,\nchildren who are not close to a father with whom they live have lower self-\nesteem than children who are not close to a father with whom they do not live.\nOverall, though, children fare best when they live with fathers with whom they\nhave a close relationship: \u201cIt does not appear that strong affection alone can\novercome the problems associated with father absence from the child\u2019s\nresidence.\u201d\nMarriage and Well-Being\nIs marriage good for people? This is the flip side of the question we have just\naddressed on whether divorce is bad for people. Are people better off if they get\nmarried? Or are they better off if they stay single? In 1972, sociologist Jessie Bernard (1972) famously said that every marriage\nincludes a \u201cher marriage\u201d and a \u201chis marriage.\u201d By this she meant that husbands\nand wives view and define their marriages differently. When spouses from the\nsame marriage are interviewed, they disagree on such things as how often they\nshould have sex, how often they actually do have sex, and who does various\nhousehold tasks. Women do most of the housework and child care, while men are\nfreer to work and do other things outside the home. Citing various studies, she\nsaid that marriage is better for men than for women. Married women, she said,\nhave poorer mental health than unmarried women, while married men have\nbetter mental health than unmarried men. In short, she said that marriage was\ngood for men but bad for women.\nMarried people are generally happier than unmarried people and score higher on\nother measures of psychological well-being.\nSilvia Sala \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nCritics later said that Bernard misinterpreted her data on women and that\nmarried women are also better off than unmarried women (Glenn, 1997). Recent\nresearch generally finds that marriage does benefit both sexes: Married people,\nwomen and men alike, are generally happier than unmarried people (whether\nnever married, divorced, or widowed), score better on other measures of\npsychological well-being, are physically healthier, have better sex lives, and have lower death rates (Waite et al., 2009; Wilcox, 2010). There is even evidence that\nmarriage helps keep men from committing crime (Theobald & Farrington, 2011)!\nMarriage has these benefits for several reasons, including the emotional and\npractical support spouses give each other, their greater financial resources\ncompared to those of unmarried people, and the sense of obligation they have\ntoward each other.\nThree issues qualify the general conclusion that marriage is beneficial (Frech &\nWilliams, 2007). First, it would be more accurate to say that good marriages are\nbeneficial, because bad marriages certainly are not, and stressful marriages can\nimpair physical and mental health (Parker-Pope, 2010). Second, although\nmarriage is generally beneficial, its benefits seem greater for older adults than for\nyounger adults, for whites than for African Americans, and for individuals who\nwere psychologically depressed before marriage than for those who were not\ndepressed. Third, psychologically happy and healthy people may be the ones who\nget married in the first place and are less apt to get divorced once they do marry.\nIf so, marriage does not promote psychological well-being; rather, psychological\nwell-being promotes marriage. Research testing this selectivity hypothesis finds\nthat both processes occur: Psychologically healthy people are more apt to get and\nstay married, but marriage also promotes psychological well-being.\nWorking Mothers and Day Care\nAs noted earlier, women are now much more likely to be working outside the\nhome than a few decades ago. This is true for both married and unmarried\nwomen and also for women with and without children. As women have entered\nthe labor force, the question of who takes care of the children has prompted\nmuch debate and controversy. Many observers say young children suffer if they\ndo not have a parent, implicitly their mother, taking care of them full-time until\nthey start school and being there every day when they get home from school. The\npublic is divided on the issue of more mothers working outside the home: 21\npercent say this trend is \u201ca good thing for society\u201d; 37 percent say it is \u201ca bad\nthing for society\u201d; and 46 percent say it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much difference\u201d (Morin,\n2010). What does research say about how young children fare if their mothers\nwork? (Notice that no one seems to worry that fathers work!)\nEarly studies compared the degree of attachment shown to their mothers by\nchildren in day care and that shown by children who stay at home with their mothers. In one type of study, children were put in a laboratory room with their\nmothers and observed as the mothers left and returned. The day-care kids usually\ntreated their mothers\u2019 departure and returning casually and acted as if they did\nnot care that their mothers were leaving or returning. In contrast the stay-at-\nhome kids acted very upset when their mothers left and seemed much happier\nand even relieved when they returned. Several researchers concluded that these\nfindings indicated that day-care children lacked sufficient emotional attachment\nto their mothers (Schwartz, 1983). However, other researchers reached a very\ndifferent conclusion: The day-care children\u2019s apparent nonchalance when their\nmothers left and returned simply reflected the fact that they always saw her leave\nand return every day when they went to day care. The lack of concern over her\nbehavior showed only that they were more independent and self-confident than\nthe stay-at-home children, who were fearful when their mothers left, and not that\nthey were less attached to their mothers (Coontz, 1997).\nMore recent research has compared stay-at-home children and day-care children\nstarting with infancy, with some of the most notable studies using data from a\nlarge study funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human\nDevelopment, a branch of the National Institutes of Health (Rabin, 2008). This\nresearch finds that day-care children exhibit better cognitive skills (reading and\narithmetic) than stay-at-home children but are also slightly more likely to engage\nin aggressive behavior that is well within the normal range of children\u2019s behavior.\nThis research has also yielded two other conclusions. First, the quality of\nparenting and other factors such as parent\u2019s education and income matter much\nmore for children\u2019s cognitive and social development than whether or not they\nare in day care. Second, to the extent that day care is beneficial for children, it is\nhigh-quality day care that is beneficial, as low-quality day care can be harmful. Children in day care exhibit better cognitive skills than stay-at-home children but\nare also slightly more likely to engage in aggressive behavior that is within the\nnormal range of children\u2019s behavior.\nnjxw \u2013 Daycare \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nThis latter conclusion is an important finding, because many day-care settings in\nthe United States are not high quality. Unfortunately, many parents who use day\ncare cannot afford high-quality care, which can cost hundreds of dollars monthly.\nThis problem reflects the fact that the United States lags far behind other\nWestern democracies in providing subsidies for day care (see Note 10.21 \u201cLessons\nfrom Other Societies\u201d later in this chapter). Because working women are certainly\nhere to stay and because high-quality day care seems at least as good for children\nas full-time care by a parent, it is essential that the United States make good day\ncare available and affordable.\nAffordable child care is especially essential for low-income parents. After the\nUnited States plunged into economic recession in 2008, many states reduced\ntheir subsidies for child care. As a result, many low-income parents who wanted\nto continue working or to start a job could not afford to do so because child care\ncan be very expensive: For a family living below the poverty line, child care comprises one-third of the family budget on the average. As the head of a\nCalifornia organization that advocates for working parents explained, \u201cYou can\u2019t\nexpect a family with young children to get on their feet and get jobs without child\ncare\u201d (Goodman, 2010, p. A1).\nRacial and Ethnic Diversity in Marriages and Families\nMarriages and families in the United States exhibit a fair amount of racial and\nethnic diversity, as we saw earlier in this chapter. Children are more likely to live\nwith only one parent among Latino and especially African American families than\namong white and Asian American families. Moreover, African American, Latino,\nand Native American children and their families are especially likely to live in\npoverty. As a result, they are at much greater risk for the many problems that\nchildren in poverty experience (see Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201d).\nBeyond these cold facts lie other racial and ethnic differences in family life\n(Wright, Mindel, Tran, & Habenstein, 2012). Studies of Latino and Asian American\nfamilies find they have especially strong family bonds and loyalty. Extended\nfamilies in both groups and among Native Americans are common, and these\nextended families have proven a valuable shield against the problems all three\ngroups face because of their race/ethnicity and poverty.\nThe status of the African American family has been the source of much\ncontroversy for several decades. Perhaps the major reason for this controversy is\nthe large number of African American children living in single-parent households:\nWhereas 41 percent of all births are to unmarried women (up from 28 percent in\n1990), such births account for 72 percent of all births to African American women\n(see Figure 10.5 \u201cPercentage of Births to Unmarried Mothers, by Race/Ethnicity\n2010\u201d). Figure 10.5 Percentage of Births to Unmarried Mothers, by Race/Ethnicity 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United\nStates: 2012. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nMany scholars attribute the high number of fatherless families among African\nAmericans to the forcible separation of families during slavery and to the fact that\nso many young black males today are unemployed, in prison or jail, or facing\nother problems (Patterson, 1998). Some observers say this high number of\nfatherless families in turn contributes to African Americans\u2019 poverty, crime, and\nother problems (Haskins, 2009). But other observers argue that this blame is\nmisplaced to at least some extent. Extended families and strong female-headed\nhouseholds in the African American community, they say, have compensated for\nthe absence of fathers (Willie & Reddick, 2010). The problems African Americans\nface, they add, stem to a large degree from their experience of racism, segregated\nneighborhoods, lack of job opportunities, and other structural difficulties\n(Sampson, 2009). Even if fatherless families contribute to these problems, these\nscholars say, these other factors play a larger role.\nFamily Violence\nAlthough family violence has received much attention since the 1970s, families\nwere violent long before scholars began studying family violence and the public\nbegan hearing about it. We can divide family violence into two types: violence against intimates (spouses, live-in partners, boyfriends, or girlfriends) and\nviolence against children. (Violence against elders also occurs and was discussed\nin Chapter 6 \u201cAging and Ageism\u201d.)\nViolence against Intimates\nIntimates commit violence against each other in many ways: they can hit with\ntheir fists, slap with an open hand, throw an object, push or shove, or use or\nthreaten to use a weapon. When all these acts and others are combined, we find\nthat much intimate violence occurs. While we can never be certain of the exact\nnumber of intimates who are attacked, the US Department of Justice estimates\nfrom its National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that about 509,000 acts of\nviolence (2010 data) are committed annually by one intimate against another\nintimate; 80 percent of these acts are committed by men against women\n(Truman, 2011). Another national survey about a decade ago found that 22\npercent of US women had been physically assaulted by a spouse or partner at\nsome point in their lives (Tjaden & Thoennes, 1998). This figure, if still true,\ntranslates to more than 20 million women today. A national survey of Canadian\nwomen found that 29 percent had been attacked by a spouse or partner (Randall\n& Haskell, 1995). Taken together, these different figures all indicate that intimate\npartner violence is very common and affects millions of people.\nAccording to some estimates, about one-fifth of US women have been assaulted\nby a spouse or partner at least once in their lives.\nNeil Moralee \u2013 Not Defeated. \u2013 CC BY 2.0. Some observers claim that husbands are just as likely as wives to be beaten by a\nspouse, and there is evidence that husbands experience an act of violence from\ntheir wives about as often as wives do from their husbands. Yet this \u201cgender\nequivalence\u201d argument has been roundly criticized. Although women do commit\nviolence against husbands and boyfriends, their violence is less serious (e.g., a\nslap compared to using a fist) and usually in self-defense to their husbands\u2019\nviolence. And although some studies find an equal number of violent acts\ncommitted by husbands and wives, other studies find much more violence\ncommitted by husbands (Johnson, 2006).\nWhy do men hit their wives, partners, and girlfriends? As with rape (see Chapter 4\n\u201cGender Inequality\u201d), sociologists answer this question by citing both structural\nand cultural factors. Structurally, women are the subordinate gender in a\npatriarchal society and, as such, are more likely to be victims of violence, whether\nit is rape or intimate violence. Intimate violence is more common in poor families,\nand economic inequality thus may lead men to take out their frustration over\ntheir poverty on their wives and girlfriends (Martin, Vieraitis, & Britto, 2006).\nCultural myths also help explain why men hit their wives and girlfriends (Gosselin,\n2010). Many men continue to believe that their wives should not only love and\nhonor them but also obey them, as the traditional marriage vow says. If they view\ntheir wives in this way, it becomes that much easier to hit them. In another myth,\nmany people ask why women do not leave home if the hitting they suffer is really\nthat bad; the implication is that the hitting cannot be that bad because they do\nnot leave home. This reasoning ignores the fact that many women do try to leave\nhome, which often angers their husbands and ironically puts the women more at\nrisk for being hit, or they do not leave home because they have nowhere to go\n(Kim & Gray, 2008). As the news story that began this chapter discussed, battered\nwomen\u2019s shelters are still few in number and can accommodate a woman and her\nchildren for only two or three weeks. Many battered women also have little\nmoney of their own and simply cannot afford to leave home. The belief that\nbattering cannot be that bad if women hit by their husbands do not leave home\nignores all these factors and is thus a myth that reinforces spousal violence\nagainst women. (See Note 10.15 \u201cPeople Making a Difference\u201d for a profile of the\nwoman who started the first women\u2019s shelter.) People Making a Difference\nThe Founder of the First Battered Women\u2019s Shelter\nSandra Ramos deserves our thanks because she founded the first known shelter\nfor battered women in North America back in the late 1970s.\nHer life changed one night in 1970 when she was only 28 years old and working as\na waitress at a jazz club. One night a woman from her church in New Jersey came\nto her home seeking refuge from a man who was abusing her. Ramos took in the\nwoman and her children and soon did the same with other abused women and\ntheir children. Within a few months, twenty-two women and children were living\ninside her house. \u201cIt was kind of chaotic,\u201d recalls Maria, 47, the oldest of Ramos\u2019s\nthree children. \u201cIt was a small house; we didn\u2019t have a lot of room. But she\nreaches out to people she sees suffering. She does everything in her power to\nhelp them.\u201d\nWhen authorities threatened to arrest Ramos if she did not remove all these\npeople from her home, she conducted sit-ins and engaged in other actions to call\nattention to the women\u2019s plight. She eventually won county funding to start the\nfirst women\u2019s shelter.\nToday Ramos leads a New Jersey nonprofit organization, Strengthen Our Sisters,\nthat operates several shelters and halfway houses for battered women. Her first\nshelter and these later ones have housed thousands of women and children since\nthe late 1970s, and at any one time today they house about 180 women and their\nchildren.\nOne woman whom Ramos helped was Geraldine Wright, who was born in the\nDominican Republic. Wright says she owes Ramos a great debt. \u201cSandy makes you\nfeel like, OK, you\u2019re going through this, but it\u2019s going to get better,\u201d she says.\n\u201cOne of the best things I did for myself and my children was come to the shelter.\nShe helped me feel strong, which I usually wasn\u2019t. She helped me get a job here at\nthe shelter so that I could find a place and pay the rent.\u201d\nSince that first woman knocked on her door in 1970, Sandra Ramos has worked\nunceasingly for the rights and welfare of abused women. She has fittingly been\ncalled \u201cone of the nation\u2019s most well-known and tireless advocates on behalf of\nbattered women.\u201d For more than forty years, Sandra Ramos has made a\nconsiderable difference.\nSource: Llorente, 2009 Child Abuse\nChild abuse takes many forms. Children can be physically or sexually assaulted,\nand they may also suffer from emotional abuse and practical neglect. Whatever\nform it takes, child abuse is a serious national problem.\nIt is especially difficult to know how much child abuse occurs. Infants obviously\ncannot talk, and toddlers and older children who are abused usually do not tell\nanyone about the abuse. They might not define it as abuse, they might be scared\nto tell on their parents, they might blame themselves for being abused, or they\nmight not know whom they could talk to about their abuse. Whatever the reason,\nthey usually remain silent, thus making it very difficult to know how much abuse\ntakes place. Government data estimate that about 800,000 children are abused or neglected\neach year. Because most children do not report their abuse or neglect, the actual\nnumber is probably much higher.\nJane Fox \u2013 Child Abuse mental \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nUsing information from child protective agencies throughout the country, the US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services estimates that almost 800,000\nchildren (2008 data) are victims of child abuse and neglect annually\n(Administration on Children Youth and Families, 2010). This figure includes some\n122,000 cases of physical abuse; 69,000 cases of sexual abuse; 539,000 cases of\nneglect; 55,000 cases of psychological maltreatment; and 17,000 cases of medical\nneglect. The total figure represents about 1 percent of all children under the age\nof 18. Obviously this is just the tip of the iceberg, as many cases of child abuse\nnever become known. A 1994 Gallup poll asked adult respondents about physical\nabuse they suffered as children. Twelve percent said they had been abused\n(punched, kicked, or choked), yielding an estimate of 23 million adults in the\nUnited States who were physically abused as children (D. W. Moore, 1994). Some\nstudies estimate that about 25 percent of girls and 10 percent of boys are sexually\nabused at least once before turning 18 (Garbarino, 1989). In a study of a random\nsample of women in Toronto, Canada, 42 percent said they had been sexually\nabused before turning 16 (Randall & Haskell, 1995). Whatever the true figure is,\nmost child abuse is committed by parents, stepparents, and other people the\nchildren know, not by strangers.\nChildren and Our Future\nIs Spanking a Good Idea?\nAs the text discusses, spanking underlies many episodes of child abuse.\nNonetheless, many Americans approve of spanking. In the 2010 General Social\nSurvey, 69 percent of respondents agreed that \u201cit is sometimes necessary to\ndiscipline a child with a good, hard, spanking.\u201d Reflecting this \u201cspare the rod and\nspoil the child\u201d belief, most parents have spanked their children. National survey\nevidence finds that two-thirds of parents of toddlers ages 19\u201335 months have\nspanked their child at least once, and one-fourth spank their child sometimes or\noften.\nThe reason that many people approve of spanking and that many parents spank is\nclear: They believe that spanking will teach a child a lesson and improve a child\u2019s behavior and/or attitude. However, most child and parenting experts believe the\nopposite is true. When children are spanked, they say, and especially when they\nare spanked regularly, they are more likely to misbehave as a result. If so,\nspanking ironically produces the opposite result from what a parent intends.\nSpanking has this effect for several reasons. First, it teaches children that they\nshould behave to avoid being punished. This lesson makes children more likely to\nmisbehave if they think they will not get caught, as they\u2019d not learn to behave for\nits own sake. Second, spanking also teaches children that it is OK to hit someone\nto solve an interpersonal dispute and even to hit someone if you love her or him,\nbecause that is what spanking is all about. Third, children who are spanked may\ncome to resent their parents and thus be more likely to misbehave because their\nbond with their parents weakens.\nThis harmful effect of spanking is especially likely when spanking is frequent. As\nAlan Kazin, a former president of the American Psychological Association (APA)\nexplains, \u201cCorporal punishment has really serious side effects. Children who are\nhit become more aggressive.\u201d When spanking is rare, this effect may or may not\noccur, according to research on this issue, but this research also finds that other\nforms of discipline are as effective as a rare spanking in teaching a child to\nbehave. This fact leads Kazin to say that even rare spanking should be avoided. \u201cIt\nsuppresses [misbehavior] momentarily. But you haven\u2019t really changed its\nprobability of occurring. Physical punishment is not needed to change behavior.\nIt\u2019s just not needed.\u201d\nSources: Berlin et al., 2009; Harder, 2007; Park, 2010; Regalado, Sareen, Inkelas,\nWissow, & Halfon, 2004\nWhy does child abuse occur? Structurally speaking, children are another\npowerless group and, as such, are easy targets of violence. Moreover, the best\nevidence indicates that child abuse is more common in poorer families. The stress\nthese families suffer from their poverty is thought to be a major reason for the\nchild abuse occurring within them (Gosselin, 2010). As with spousal violence,\nthen, economic inequality is partly to blame for child abuse. Cultural values and\npractices also matter. In a nation where spanking is common, it is inevitable that\nphysical child abuse will occur, because there is a very thin line between a hard\nspanking and physical abuse: Not everyone defines a good, hard spanking in the\nsame way. As two family violence scholars once noted, \u201cAlthough most physical\npunishment [of children] does not turn into physical abuse, most physical abuse begins as ordinary physical punishment\u201d (Wauchope & Straus, 1990, p. 147).\n(See Note 10.17 \u201cChildren and Our Future\u201d for a further discussion of spanking.)\nAbused children are much more likely than children who are not abused to end\nup with various developmental, psychological, and behavioral problems\nthroughout their life course. In particular, they are more likely to be aggressive, to\nuse alcohol and other drugs, to be anxious and depressed, and to get divorced if\nthey marry (Trickett, Noll, & Putnam, 2011).\nKey Takeaways:\nThe divorce rate rose for several reasons during the 1960s and 1970s but has\ngenerally leveled off since then.\nDivorce often lowers the psychological well-being of spouses and their children,\nbut the consequences of divorce also depend on the level of contention in the\nmarriage that has ended.\nDespite continuing controversy over the welfare of children whose mothers work\noutside the home, research indicates that children in high-quality day care fare\nbetter in cognitive development than those who stay at home.\nViolence between intimates is fairly common and stems from gender inequality,\nincome inequality, and several cultural myths that minimize the harm that\nintimate violence causes.\nAt least 800,000 children are abused or neglected each year in the United States.\nBecause most abused children do not report the abuse, the number of cases of\nabuse and neglect is undoubtedly much higher.\nReferences\nAdministration on Children Youth and Families.

Families in the Future\nLearning Objective:\nUnderstand the implications of social science theory and research for how to\naddress family problems.\nAs perhaps our most important social institution, the family seems to arouse\nstrong passions from almost everyone. Sociological theory and research, along\nwith research from the other social sciences, have important implications for how\nour society should address the various family issues discussed in this chapter.\nOne set of implications concerns the many children and families living in poverty.\nThe households in which they live are mostly headed by women, and the majority\nof these households are the result of divorce. The programs and policies outlined\nin Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201dare certainly relevant for any efforts to help these families.\nThese efforts include, but are not limited to, increased government financial\nsupport, subsidies for child care, vocational training and financial aid for schooling\nfor women who wish to return to the labor force or to increase their wages, early\nchildhood visitation and intervention programs, and increases in programs\nproviding nutrition and medical care to poor women and their children (Cherlin,\n2009). In all these efforts, the United States has much to learn from the nations of\nWestern Europe (see Note 10.21 \u201cLessons from Other Societies\u201d).\nLessons from Other Societies\nPutting Families First: Helping Families in Western Europe\nThe nations of Western Europe make a much greater effort than the United\nStates to help families with young children. According to sociologist James W.\nRussell, these nations believe that taking care of their children is a communal\nresponsibility because \u201csociety as a whole benefits from having children\nadequately reared. Children grow up to take over the responsibilities of\nmaintaining the survival of the society. They will also be available to provide\nneeded services to both their own parents and aging adults who did not raise\ntheir own children. An aging adult who did not have children may need the\nservices of a younger doctor who was raised by someone else.\u201d In contrast, says\nRussell, the United States tends to believe that families need to be self-reliant and\nshould not expect very much help from the government. This difference in philosophy leads Western European nations to provide much more support than\nthe United States for families with young children.\nThis support takes several forms whose nature and extent vary among the\nWestern European nations. Most of the nations, for example, provide at least four\nmonths of paid maternity leave after the birth of a child; in contrast, the United\nStates guarantees only three months of unpaid leave, and only for employees\nwho work for companies that employ at least fifty people. Many European\nnations also provide paid parental leave after the maternity leave benefits expire;\nthe Untied States does not provide this benefit. In Sweden, parents share 450\ndays of paid leave to care for a new child.\nIn another striking difference from the United States, all European nations have a\nfamily allowance program, which provides cash payments to parents for every\nchild they have after their first child. The intent here is to not only help these\nfamilies, but also to encourage them to have children to help counter declining\nbirth rates in Europe.\nA third very important difference is that European nations provide free or heavily\nsubsidized child care of generally high quality to enable parents to work outside\nthe home. For example, France provides free child care for children ages 2\u20136 and\npays 75 percent of the cost of child care for children under 2.\nIn these and other ways, the nations of Western Europe help their families with\nyoung children and thus their societies as a whole. The United States has much to\nlearn from their example.\nSources: Russell, 2011; Shahmehri, 2007\nAnother issue and set of implications from social science research concern family\nviolence. To the extent that much violence against intimates and children is\nrooted in the frustration and stress accompanying poverty, efforts that reduce\npoverty will also reduce family violence. And to the extent that gender inequality\nhelps explain violence against women, continuing and strengthening efforts to\nreduce gender inequality should also reduce violence against intimates, as most\nof this violence is directed by men against women. Further, if, as many scholars\nbelieve, the violent nature of masculinity helps account for violence men commit\nagainst their wives and girlfriends, then efforts to change male gender-role\nsocialization should also help. Turning to child abuse, because so much child abuse remains unknown to child\nprotective authorities, it is difficult to reduce its seriousness and extent. However,\ncertain steps might still help. Because child abuse seems more common among\npoorer families, then efforts that reduce poverty should also reduce child abuse.\nThe home visitation programs that help poor children also help reduce child\nabuse. Although, as noted earlier, approval of spanking is deeply rooted in our\nculture, a national educational campaign to warn about the dangers of spanking,\nincluding its promotion of children\u2019s misbehavior, may eventually reduce the use\nof spanking and thus the incidence of child physical abuse.\nDivorce is a final issue for which research by sociologists and other scholars is\nrelevant. Much evidence suggests that divorce from low-conflict marriages has\nnegative consequences for spouses and children, and some evidence suggests\nthat these consequences arise not from the divorce itself but rather from the\nconflict preceding the divorce and the poverty into which many newly single-\nparent households are plunged. There is also evidence that spouses and children\nfare better after a divorce from a highly contentious marriage. Efforts to help\npreserve marriages should certainly continue, but these efforts should proceed\ncautiously or not proceed at all for the marriages that are highly contentious. To\nthe extent that marital conflict partly arises from financial difficulties, once again\ngovernment efforts that help reduce poverty should also help preserve marriages.\nKey Takeaways:\nEfforts to help children and families living in poverty or near poverty should be\nexpanded.\nEfforts to help preserve marriages should proceed cautiously or not at all for\nhighly contentious marriages.

As a social institution, the family is a universal or near-universal phenomenon.\nYet historical and cross-cultural records indicate that many types of families\nand family arrangements exist now and have existed in the past. Although the\nnuclear family has been the norm in many societies, in practice its use has\nbeen less common than many people think. Many societies have favored\nextended families, and in early times children could expect, because of the\ndeath of a parent or births out of wedlock, to live at least some part of their\nchildhood with only one parent.\n2. Almost one-third of American children live in one-parent families; this\npercentage varies by race and ethnicity. Some research finds that parents\nexperience more stress and lower psychological well-being than nonparents.\n3. Sociological perspectives on the family fall into the more general functional,\nconflict, and social interactionist approaches guiding sociological thought.\nFunctional theory emphasizes the several functions that families serve for\nsociety, including the socialization of children and the economic and practical\nsupport of family members. Conflict theory emphasizes the ways in which\nnuclear families contribute to ongoing gender, class, and race inequality, while\nsocial interactionist approaches examine family communication and\ninteraction to make sense of family life.\n4. Scholars continue to debate the consequences of divorce and single-parent\nhouseholds for women, men, and their children. Several studies find that\ndivorce and single parenting in and of themselves do not have the dire\nconsequences for children that many observers assume. The low income of\nsingle-parent households, and not the absence of a second parent, seems to\naccount for many of the problems that children in such households do\nexperience. Women and children seem to fare better when a highly\ncontentious marriage ends.\n5. Despite ongoing concern over the effect on children of day care instead of full-\ntime care by one parent, recent research finds that children in high-quality day\ncare are not worse off than their stay-at-home counterparts. Some studies find\nthat day-care children are more independent and self-confident than children\nwho stay at home and that they perform better on various tests of cognitive\nability. 6. Racial and ethnic diversity marks American family life. Controversy also\ncontinues to exist over the high number of fatherless families in the African\nAmerican community. Many observers blame many of the problems African\nAmericans face on their comparative lack of two-parent households, but other\nobservers say this blame is misplaced.\n7. Family violence affects millions of spouses and children yearly. Structural and\ncultural factors help account for the high amount of intimate violence and\nchild abuse. Despite claims to the contrary, the best evidence indicates that\nwomen are much more at risk than men for violence by spouses and partners.\nWhat You Can Do\nTo help deal with the family problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to\ndo any of the following:\n1. Volunteer at a day-care center.\n2. Volunteer at a battered women\u2019s shelter.\n3. Start or join a group on your campus that addresses dating violence.\nThis is a derivative of SOCIAL PROBLEMS: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by a publisher who has requested that they\nand the original author not receive attribution, which was originally released and is used under CC BY-NC-SA.

Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 5 \u2013 Race and Ethnicity\n5. 1 Introduction to Race and Ethnicity\nDerived from Introduction to Race and Ethnicity by OpenStax\nDo you think race played a role in Trayvon Martin\u2019s death or in the public reaction\nto it? Do you think race had any influence on the initial decision not to arrest\nGeorge Zimmerman, or on his later acquittal? (Photo courtesy of Ryan\nVaarsi/flickr)\nTrayvon Martin was a seventeen-year-old black teenager. On the evening of\nFebruary 26, 2012, he was visiting with his father and his father\u2019s fianc\u00e9e in the\nSanford, Florida multi-ethnic gated community where his father's fianc\u00e9e lived.\nTrayvon left her home on foot to buy a snack from a nearby convenience store. As\nhe was returning, George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic male and the\ncommunity\u2019s neighborhood watch program coordinator, noticed him. In light of a\nrecent rash of break-ins, Zimmerman called the police to report a person acting\nsuspiciously, which he had done on many other occasions. The 911 operator told\nZimmerman not to follow the teen, but soon after Zimmerman and Martin had a\nphysical confrontation. According to Zimmerman, Martin attacked him, and in the\nensuing scuffle Martin was shot and killed (CNN Library 2014).\nA public outcry followed Martin\u2019s death. There were allegations of racial\nprofiling\u2014the use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to\nstop and detain someone\u2014a national discussion about \u201cStand Your Ground Laws,\u201d and a failed lawsuit in which Zimmerman accused NBC of airing an edited\nversion of the 911 call that made him appear racist. Zimmerman was not arrested\nuntil April 11, when he was charged with second-degree murder by special\nprosecutor Angela Corey. In the ensuing trial, he was found not guilty (CNN\nLibrary 2014).\nThe shooting, the public response, and the trial that followed offer a snapshot of\nthe sociology of race. Do you think race played a role in Martin\u2019s death or in the\npublic reaction to it? Do you think race had any influence on the initial decision\nnot to arrest Zimmerman, or on his later acquittal? Does society fear black men,\nleading to racial profiling at an institutional level? What about the role of the\nmedia? Was there a deliberate attempt to manipulate public opinion? If you were\na member of the jury, would you have convicted George Zimmerman?\nGlossary\nracial profiling\nthe use by law enforcement of race alone to determine whether to stop\nand detain someone\n\u00a9 Apr 23, 2015 OpenStax.

The idea of race refers to superficial\nphysical differences that a particular society considers significant, while ethnicity\ndescribes shared culture. And the term \"minority groups\" describe groups that\nare subordinate, or that lack power in society regardless of skin color or country\nof origin. For example, in modern U.S. history, the elderly might be considered a\nminority group due to a diminished status that results from popular prejudice and\ndiscrimination against them. Ten percent of nursing home staff admitted to physically abusing an elderly person in the past year, and 40 percent admitted to\ncommitting psychological abuse (World Health Organization 2011). In this chapter\nwe focus on racial and ethnic minorities.\nWhat Is Race?\nHistorically, the concept of race has changed across cultures and eras, and has\neventually become less connected with ancestral and familial ties, and more\nconcerned with superficial physical characteristics. In the past, theorists have\nposited categories of race based on various geographic regions, ethnicities, skin\ncolors, and more. Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions (Mongolia\nand the Caucus Mountains, for instance) or skin tones (black, white, yellow, and\nred, for example).\nSocial science organizations including the American Association of\nAnthropologists, the American Sociological Association, and the American\nPsychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological\nexplanations of race. Over time, the typology of race that developed during early\nracial science has fallen into disuse, and the social construction of race is a more\nsociological way of understanding racial categories. Research in this school of\nthought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial\ncategories were arbitrarily assigned, based on pseudoscience, and used to justify\nracist practices (Omi and Winant 1994; Graves 2003). When considering skin\ncolor, for example, the social construction of race perspective recognizes that the\nrelative darkness or fairness of skin is an evolutionary adaptation to the available\nsunlight in different regions of the world. Contemporary conceptions of race,\ntherefore, which tend to be based on socioeconomic assumptions, illuminate how\nfar removed modern understanding of race is from biological qualities. In modern\nsociety, some people who consider themselves \u201cwhite\u201d actually have more\nmelanin (a pigment that determines skin color) in their skin than other people\nwho identify as \u201dblack.\u201d Consider the case of the actress Rashida Jones. She is the\ndaughter of a black man (Quincy Jones), and her best-known roles include Ann\nPerkins on Parks and Recreation, Karen Filippelli on The Office, and Zooey Rice in I\nLove You Man, none of whom are black characters. In some countries, such as\nBrazil, class is more important than skin color in determining racial categorization.\nPeople with high levels of melanin may consider themselves \"white\" if they enjoy\na middle-class lifestyle. On the other hand, someone with low levels of melanin might be assigned the identity of \"black\" if he or she has little education or\nmoney.\nThe social construction of race is also reflected in the way names for racial\ncategories change with changing times. It\u2019s worth noting that race, in this sense, is\nalso a system of labeling that provides a source of identity; specific labels fall in\nand out of favor during different social eras. For example, the category \u201dnegroid,\u201d\npopular in the nineteenth century, evolved into the term \u201cnegro\u201d by the 1960s,\nand then this term fell from use and was replaced with \u201cAfrican American.\u201d This\nlatter term was intended to celebrate the multiple identities that a black person\nmight hold, but the word choice is a poor one: it lumps together a large variety of\nethnic groups under an umbrella term while excluding others who could\naccurately be described by the label but who do not meet the spirit of the term.\nFor example, actress Charlize Theron is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed \u201cAfrican\nAmerican.\u201d She was born in South Africa and later became a U.S. citizen. Is her\nidentity that of an \u201cAfrican American\u201d as most of us understand the term?\nWhat Is Ethnicity?\nEthnicity is a term that describes shared culture\u2014the practices, values, and\nbeliefs of a group. This culture might include shared language, religion, and\ntraditions, among other commonalities. Like race, the term ethnicity is difficult to\ndescribe and its meaning has changed over time. And as with race, individuals\nmay be identified or self-identify with ethnicities in complex, even contradictory,\nways. For example, ethnic groups such as Irish, Italian American, Russian, Jewish,\nand Serbian might all be groups whose members are predominantly included in\nthe \u201cwhite\u201d racial category. Conversely, the ethnic group British includes citizens\nfrom a multiplicity of racial backgrounds: black, white, Asian, and more, plus a\nvariety of race combinations. These examples illustrate the complexity and\noverlap of these identifying terms. Ethnicity, like race, continues to be an\nidentification method that individuals and institutions use today\u2014whether\nthrough the census, affirmative action initiatives, nondiscrimination laws, or\nsimply in personal day-to-day relations.\nWhat Are Minority Groups?\nSociologist Louis Wirth (1945) defined a minority group as \u201cany group of people\nwho, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and\nwho therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination.\u201d The\nterm minority connotes discrimination, and in its sociological use, the\nterm subordinate group can be used interchangeably with the term minority,\nwhile the term dominant group is often substituted for the group that\u2019s in the\nmajority. These definitions correlate to the concept that the dominant group is\nthat which holds the most power in a given society, while subordinate groups are\nthose who lack power compared to the dominant group.\nNote that being a numerical minority is not a characteristic of being a minority\ngroup; sometimes larger groups can be considered minority groups due to their\nlack of power. It is the lack of power that is the predominant characteristic of a\nminority, or subordinate group. For example, consider apartheid in South Africa,\nin which a numerical majority (the black inhabitants of the country) were\nexploited and oppressed by the white minority.\nAccording to Charles Wagley and Marvin Harris (1958), a minority group is\ndistinguished by five characteristics: (1) unequal treatment and less power over\ntheir lives, (2) distinguishing physical or cultural traits like skin color or language,\n(3) involuntary membership in the group, (4) awareness of subordination, and (5)\nhigh rate of in-group marriage. Additional examples of minority groups might\ninclude the LBGT community, religious practitioners whose faith is not widely\npracticed where they live, and people with disabilities.\nScapegoat theory, developed initially from Dollard\u2019s (1939) Frustration-\nAggression theory, suggests that the dominant group will displace its unfocused\naggression onto a subordinate group. History has shown us many examples of the\nscapegoating of a subordinate group. An example from the last century is the way\nAdolf Hitler was able to blame the Jewish population for Germany\u2019s social and\neconomic problems. In the United States, recent immigrants have frequently been\nthe scapegoat for the nation\u2019s\u2014or an individual\u2019s\u2014woes. Many states have\nenacted laws to disenfranchise immigrants; these laws are popular because they\nlet the dominant group scapegoat a subordinate group.\nSummary\nRace is fundamentally a social construct. Ethnicity is a term that describes shared\nculture and national origin. Minority groups are defined by their lack of power.

Let us explore the differences between\nthese concepts. Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of\npeople. Stereotypes can be based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual\norientation\u2014almost any characteristic. They may be positive (usually about one\u2019s\nown group, such as when women suggest they are less likely to complain about\nphysical pain) but are often negative (usually toward other groups, such as when\nmembers of a dominant racial group suggest that a subordinate racial group is\nstupid or lazy). In either case, the stereotype is a generalization that doesn\u2019t take\nindividual differences into account.\nWhere do stereotypes come from? In fact new stereotypes are rarely created;\nrather, they are recycled from subordinate groups that have assimilated into\nsociety and are reused to describe newly subordinate groups. For example, many\nstereotypes that are currently used to characterize black people were used earlier\nin American history to characterize Irish and Eastern European immigrants. Prejudice and Racism\nPrejudice refers to the beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes someone holds\nabout a group. A prejudice is not based on experience; instead, it is a\nprejudgment, originating outside actual experience. A 1970 documentary called\nEye of the Storm illustrates the way in which prejudice develops, by showing how\ndefining one category of people as superior (children with blue eyes) results in\nprejudice against people who are not part of the favored category.\nWhile prejudice is not necessarily specific to race, racism is a stronger type of\nprejudice used to justify the belief that one racial category is somehow superior\nor inferior to others; it is also a set of practices used by a racial majority to\ndisadvantage a racial minority. The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist\norganization; its members' belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a\ncentury of hate crime and hate speech.\nInstitutional racism refers to the way in which racism is embedded in the fabric of\nsociety. For example, the disproportionate number of black men arrested,\ncharged, and convicted of crimes may reflect racial profiling, a form of\ninstitutional racism.\nColorism is another kind of prejudice, in which someone believes one type of skin\ntone is superior or inferior to another within a racial group. Studies suggest that\ndarker skinned African Americans experience more discrimination than lighter\nskinned African Americans (Herring, Keith, and Horton 2004; Klonoff and Landrine\n2000). For example, if a white employer believes a black employee with a darker\nskin tone is less capable than a black employee with lighter skin tone, that is\ncolorism. At least one study suggested the colorism affected racial socialization,\nwith darker-skinned black male adolescents receiving more warnings about the\ndanger of interacting with members of other racial groups than did lighter-\nskinned black male adolescents (Landor et al. 2013).\nDiscrimination\nWhile prejudice refers to biased thinking, discrimination consists of actions\nagainst a group of people. Discrimination can be based on age, religion, health,\nand other indicators; race-based laws against discrimination strive to address this\nset of social problems. Discrimination based on race or ethnicity can take many forms, from unfair\nhousing practices to biased hiring systems. Overt discrimination has long been\npart of U.S. history. In the late nineteenth century, it was not uncommon for\nbusiness owners to hang signs that read, \"Help Wanted: No Irish Need Apply.\"\nAnd southern Jim Crow laws, with their \"Whites Only\" signs, exemplified overt\ndiscrimination that is not tolerated today.\nHowever, we cannot erase discrimination from our culture just by enacting laws\nto abolish it. Even if a magic pill managed to eradicate racism from each\nindividual's psyche, society itself would maintain it. Sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim\ncalls racism a social fact, meaning that it does not require the action of individuals\nto continue. The reasons for this are complex and relate to the educational,\ncriminal, economic, and political systems that exist in our society.\nFor example, when a newspaper identifies by race individuals accused of a crime,\nit may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority. Another example of racist\npractices is racial steering, in which real estate agents direct prospective\nhomeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race.\nRacist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than\nspecific racist practices.\nPrejudice and discrimination can overlap and intersect in many ways. To illustrate,\nhere are four examples of how prejudice and discrimination can occur.\nUnprejudiced nondiscriminators are open-minded, tolerant, and accepting\nindividuals. Unprejudiced discriminators might be those who unthinkingly practice\nsexism in their workplace by not considering females for certain positions that\nhave traditionally been held by men. Prejudiced nondiscriminators are those who\nhold racist beliefs but don't act on them, such as a racist store owner who serves\nminority customers. Prejudiced discriminators include those who actively make\ndisparaging remarks about others or who perpetrate hate crimes.\nDiscrimination also manifests in different ways. The scenarios above are examples\nof individual discrimination, but other types exist. Institutional discrimination\noccurs when a societal system has developed with embedded disenfranchisement\nof a group, such as the U.S. military's historical nonacceptance of minority\nsexualities (the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy reflected this norm). Institutional discrimination can also include the promotion of a group's status,\nsuch in the case of white privilege, which is the benefits people receive simply by\nbeing part of the dominant group.\nWhile most white people are willing to admit that nonwhite people live with a set\nof disadvantages due to the color of their skin, very few are willing to\nacknowledge the benefits they receive.\nRacial Tensions in the United States\nThe death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO on August 9, 2014 illustrates racial\ntensions in the United States as well as the overlap between prejudice,\ndiscrimination, and institutional racism. On that day, Brown, a young unarmed\nblack man, was killed by a white police officer named Darren Wilson. During the\nincident, Wilson directed Brown and his friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of\nin the street. While eyewitness accounts vary, they agree that an altercation\noccurred between Wilson and Brown. Wilson\u2019s version has him shooting Brown in\nself-defense after Brown assaulted him, while Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown\nalso present at the time, claimed that Brown first ran away, then turned with his\nhands in the air to surrender, after which Johnson shot him repeatedly (Nobles\nand Bosman 2014). Three autopsies independently confirmed that Brown was\nshot six times (Lowery and Fears 2014).\nThe shooting focused attention on a number of race-related tensions in the\nUnited States. First, members of the predominantly black community viewed\nBrown\u2019s death as the result of a white police officer racially profiling a black man\n(Nobles and Bosman 2014). In the days after, it was revealed that only three\nmembers of the town\u2019s fifty-three-member police force were black (Nobles and\nBosman 2014). The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks, with\nsome commentators pointing to a nationwide sedimentation of racial\ninequality and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced\nracial composition in the community, in local political establishments, and in the\npolice force (Bouie 2014). Redlining is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages\nfor households and businesses located in predominately minority communities,\nwhile sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of\nboth practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of black people to\naccumulate wealth. Ferguson\u2019s racial imbalance may explain in part why, even though in 2010 only\nabout 63 percent of its population was black, in 2013 blacks were detained in 86\npercent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests (Missouri\nAttorney General\u2019s Office 2014). In addition, de facto segregation in Ferguson\u2019s\nschools, a race-based wealth gap, urban sprawl, and a black unemployment rate\nthree times that of the white unemployment rate worsened existing racial\ntensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities (Bouie\n2014).\nMultiple Identities\nGolfer Tiger Woods has Chinese, Thai, African American, Native American, and\nDutch heritage. Individuals with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more\ncommon. (Photo courtesy of familymwr/flickr)\nPrior to the twentieth century, racial intermarriage (referred to as miscegenation)\nwas extremely rare, and in many places, illegal. In the later part of the twentieth\ncentury and in the twenty-first century, as Figure shows, attitudes have changed\nfor the better. While the sexual subordination of slaves did result in children of\nmixed race, these children were usually considered black, and therefore, property. There was no concept of multiple racial identities with the possible\nexception of the Creole. Creole society developed in the port city of New Orleans,\nwhere a mixed-race culture grew from French and African inhabitants. Unlike in\nother parts of the country, \u201cCreoles of color\u201d had greater social, economic, and\neducational opportunities than most African Americans.\nIncreasingly during the modern era, the removal of miscegenation laws and a\ntrend toward equal rights and legal protection against racism have steadily\nreduced the social stigma attached to racial exogamy (exogamy refers to marriage\noutside a person\u2019s core social unit). It is now common for the children of racially\nmixed parents to acknowledge and celebrate their various ethnic identities. Golfer\nTiger Woods, for instance, has Chinese, Thai, African American, Native American,\nand Dutch heritage; he jokingly refers to his ethnicity as \u201cCablinasian,\u201d a term he\ncoined to combine several of his ethnic backgrounds. While this is the trend, it is\nnot yet evident in all aspects of our society. For example, the U.S. Census only\nrecently added additional categories for people to identify themselves, such as\nnon-white Hispanic. A growing number of people chose multiple races to describe\nthemselves on the 2010 Census, paving the way for the 2020 Census to provide\nyet more choices.\nTHE CONFEDERATE FLAG VS. THE FIRST AMENDMENT To some, the Confederate flag is a symbol of pride in Southern history. To others,\nit is a grim reminder of a degrading period of the United States\u2019 past. (Photo\ncourtesy of Eyeliam/flickr)\nIn January 2006, two girls walked into Burleson High School in Texas carrying\npurses that displayed large images of Confederate flags. School administrators\ntold the girls that they were in violation of the dress code, which prohibited\napparel with inappropriate symbolism or clothing that discriminated based on\nrace. To stay in school, they\u2019d have to have someone pick up their purses or leave\nthem in the office. The girls chose to go home for the day but then challenged the\nschool\u2019s decision, appealing first to the principal, then to the district\nsuperintendent, then to the U.S. District Court, and finally to the Fifth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals.\nWhy did the school ban the purses, and why did it stand behind that ban, even\nwhen being sued? Why did the girls, identified anonymously in court documents\nas A.M. and A.T., pursue such strong legal measures for their right to carry the\npurses? The issue, of course, is not the purses: it is the Confederate flag that\nadorns them. The parties in this case join a long line of people and institutions\nthat have fought for their right to display it, saying such a display is covered by the\nFirst Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech. In the end, the court sided with the\ndistrict and noted that the Confederate flag carried symbolism significant enough\nto disrupt normal school activities.\nWhile many young people in the United States like to believe that racism is mostly\nin the country\u2019s past, this case illustrates how racism and discrimination are quite\nalive today. If the Confederate flag is synonymous with slavery, is there any place\nfor its display in modern society? Those who fight for their right to display the flag\nsay such a display should be covered by the First Amendment: the right to free\nspeech. But others say the flag is equivalent to hate speech. Do you think that\ndisplaying the Confederate flag should considered free speech or hate speech?\nSummary\nStereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups of people.

As you\nread through these theories, ask yourself which one makes the most sense and\nwhy. Do we need more than one theory to explain racism, prejudice, stereotypes,\nand discrimination?\nFunctionalism\nIn the view of functionalism, racial and ethnic inequalities must have served an\nimportant function in order to exist as long as they have. This concept, of course,\nis problematic. How can racism and discrimination contribute positively to\nsociety? A functionalist might look at \u201cfunctions\u201d and \u201cdysfunctions\u201d caused by\nracial inequality. Nash (1964) focused his argument on the way racism is\nfunctional for the dominant group, for example, suggesting that racism morally\njustifies a racially unequal society. Consider the way slave owners justified slavery\nin the antebellum South, by suggesting black people were fundamentally inferior\nto white and preferred slavery to freedom.\nAnother way to apply the functionalist perspective to racism is to discuss the way\nracism can contribute positively to the functioning of society by strengthening\nbonds between in-group members through the ostracism of out-group members. Consider how a community might increase solidarity by refusing to allow\noutsiders access. On the other hand, Rose (1951) suggested that dysfunctions\nassociated with racism include the failure to take advantage of talent in the\nsubjugated group, and that society must divert from other purposes the time and\neffort needed to maintain artificially constructed racial boundaries. Consider how\nmuch money, time, and effort went toward maintaining separate and unequal\neducational systems prior to the civil rights movement.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theories are often applied to inequalities of gender, social class,\neducation, race, and ethnicity. A conflict theory perspective of U.S. history would\nexamine the numerous past and current struggles between the white ruling class\nand racial and ethnic minorities, noting specific conflicts that have arisen when\nthe dominant group perceived a threat from the minority group. In the late\nnineteenth century, the rising power of black Americans after the Civil War\nresulted in draconian Jim Crow laws that severely limited black political and social\npower. For example, Vivien Thomas (1910\u20131985), the black surgical technician\nwho helped develop the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of\n\u201cblue babies\u201d was classified as a janitor for many years, and paid as such, despite\nthe fact that he was conducting complicated surgical experiments. The years since\nthe Civil War have showed a pattern of attempted disenfranchisement, with\ngerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly minority\nneighborhoods.\nFeminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins (1990) developed intersection theory,\nwhich suggests we cannot separate the effects of race, class, gender, sexual\norientation, and other attributes. When we examine race and how it can bring us\nboth advantages and disadvantages, it is important to acknowledge that the way\nwe experience race is shaped, for example, by our gender and class. Multiple\nlayers of disadvantage intersect to create the way we experience race. For\nexample, if we want to understand prejudice, we must understand that the\nprejudice focused on a white woman because of her gender is very different from\nthe layered prejudice focused on a poor Asian woman, who is affected by\nstereotypes related to being poor, being a woman, and her ethnic status. Interactionism\nFor symbolic interactionists, race and ethnicity provide strong symbols as sources\nof identity. In fact, some interactionists propose that the symbols of race, not race\nitself, are what lead to racism. Famed Interactionist Herbert Blumer (1958)\nsuggested that racial prejudice is formed through interactions between members\nof the dominant group: Without these interactions, individuals in the dominant\ngroup would not hold racist views. These interactions contribute to an abstract\npicture of the subordinate group that allows the dominant group to support its\nview of the subordinate group, and thus maintains the status quo. An example of\nthis might be an individual whose beliefs about a particular group are based on\nimages conveyed in popular media, and those are unquestionably believed\nbecause the individual has never personally met a member of that group. Another\nway to apply the interactionist perspective is to look at how people define their\nraces and the race of others. As we discussed in relation to the social construction\nof race, since some people who claim a white identity have a greater amount of\nskin pigmentation than some people who claim a black identity, how did they\ncome to define themselves as black or white?\nCulture of Prejudice\nCulture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our\nculture. We grow up surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions\nof racism and prejudice. Consider the casually racist imagery on grocery store\nshelves or the stereotypes that fill popular movies and advertisements. It is easy\nto see how someone living in the Northeastern United States, who may know no\nMexican Americans personally, might gain a stereotyped impression from such\nsources as Speedy Gonzalez or Taco Bell\u2019s talking Chihuahua. Because we are all\nexposed to these images and thoughts, it is impossible to know to what extent\nthey have influenced our thought processes.\nSummary\nFunctionalist views of race study the role dominant and subordinate groups play\nto create a stable social structure. Conflict theorists examine power disparities\nand struggles between various racial and ethnic groups. Interactionists see race\nand ethnicity as important sources of individual identity and social symbolism. The concept of culture of prejudice recognizes that all people are subject to\nstereotypes that are ingrained in their culture.\nGlossary\nculture of prejudice\nthe theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture\nintersection theory\ntheory that suggests we cannot separate the effects of race, class, gender,\nsexual orientation, and other attributes\nFurther Research\nDo you know someone who practices white privilege?

The most tolerant form of intergroup relations is pluralism, in which no distinction is made between\nminority and majority groups, but instead there\u2019s equal standing. At the other end\nof the continuum are amalgamation, expulsion, and even genocide\u2014stark\nexamples of intolerant intergroup relations.\nGenocide\nGenocide, the deliberate annihilation of a targeted (usually subordinate) group, is\nthe most toxic intergroup relationship. Historically, we can see that genocide has\nincluded both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of\nexterminating of a group, intentional or not.\nPossibly the most well-known case of genocide is Hitler\u2019s attempt to exterminate\nthe Jewish people in the first part of the twentieth century. Also known as the\nHolocaust, the explicit goal of Hitler\u2019s \u201cFinal Solution\u201d was the eradication of\nEuropean Jewry, as well as the destruction of other minority groups such as\nCatholics, people with disabilities, and homosexuals. With forced emigration,\nconcentration camps, and mass executions in gas chambers, Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime\nwas responsible for the deaths of 12 million people, 6 million of whom were\nJewish. Hitler\u2019s intent was clear, and the high Jewish death toll certainly indicates\nthat Hitler and his regime committed genocide. But how do we understand\ngenocide that is not so overt and deliberate?\nThe treatment of aboriginal Australians is also an example of genocide committed\nagainst indigenous people. Historical accounts suggest that between 1824 and\n1908, white settlers killed more than 10,000 native aborigines in Tasmania and\nAustralia (Tatz 2006). Another example is the European colonization of North\nAmerica. Some historians estimate that Native American populations dwindled\nfrom approximately 12 million people in the year 1500 to barely 237,000 by the\nyear 1900 (Lewy 2004). European settlers coerced American Indians off their own\nlands, often causing thousands of deaths in forced removals, such as occurred in\nthe Cherokee or Potawatomi Trail of Tears. Settlers also enslaved Native\nAmericans and forced them to give up their religious and cultural practices. But\nthe major cause of Native American death was neither slavery nor war nor forced\nremoval: it was the introduction of European diseases and Indians\u2019 lack of\nimmunity to them. Smallpox, diphtheria, and measles flourished among\nindigenous American tribes who had no exposure to the diseases and no ability to\nfight them. Quite simply, these diseases decimated the tribes. How planned this genocide was remains a topic of contention. Some argue that the spread of\ndisease was an unintended effect of conquest, while others believe it was\nintentional citing rumors of smallpox-infected blankets being distributed as \u201cgifts\u201d\nto tribes.\nGenocide is not a just a historical concept; it is practiced today. Recently, ethnic\nand geographic conflicts in the Darfur region of Sudan have led to hundreds of\nthousands of deaths. As part of an ongoing land conflict, the Sudanese\ngovernment and their state-sponsored Janjaweed militia have led a campaign of\nkilling, forced displacement, and systematic rape of Darfuri people. Although a\ntreaty was signed in 2011, the peace is fragile.\nExpulsion\nExpulsion refers to a subordinate group being forced, by a dominant group, to\nleave a certain area or country. As seen in the examples of the Trail of Tears and\nthe Holocaust, expulsion can be a factor in genocide. However, it can also stand\non its own as a destructive group interaction. Expulsion has often occurred\nhistorically with an ethnic or racial basis. In the United States, President Franklin\nD. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in 1942, after the Japanese\ngovernment\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor. The Order authorized the establishment of\ninternment camps for anyone with as little as one-eighth Japanese ancestry (i.e.,\none great-grandparent who was Japanese). Over 120,000 legal Japanese residents\nand Japanese U.S. citizens, many of them children, were held in these camps for\nup to four years, despite the fact that there was never any evidence of collusion\nor espionage. (In fact, many Japanese Americans continued to demonstrate their\nloyalty to the United States by serving in the U.S. military during the War.) In the\n1990s, the U.S. executive branch issued a formal apology for this expulsion;\nreparation efforts continue today.\nSegregation\nSegregation refers to the physical separation of two groups, particularly in\nresidence, but also in workplace and social functions. It is important to distinguish\nbetween de jure segregation (segregation that is enforced by law) and de\nfacto segregation (segregation that occurs without laws but because of other\nfactors). A stark example of de jure segregation is the apartheid movement of\nSouth Africa, which existed from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, black South Africans were stripped of their civil rights and forcibly relocated to areas that\nsegregated them physically from their white compatriots. Only after decades of\ndegradation, violent uprisings, and international advocacy was apartheid finally\nabolished.\nDe jure segregation occurred in the United States for many years after the Civil\nWar. During this time, many former Confederate states passed Jim Crow laws that\nrequired segregated facilities for blacks and whites. These laws were codified in\n1896\u2019s landmark Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, which stated that\n\u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities were constitutional. For the next five decades,\nblacks were subjected to legalized discrimination, forced to live, work, and go to\nschool in separate\u2014but unequal\u2014facilities. It wasn\u2019t until 1954 and the Brown v.\nBoard of Education case that the Supreme Court declared that \u201cseparate\neducational facilities are inherently unequal,\u201d thus ending de jure segregation in\nthe United States.\nIn the \u201cJim Crow\u201d South, it was legal to have \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities for\nblacks and whites. (Photo courtesy of Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons)\nDe facto segregation, however, cannot be abolished by any court mandate.\nSegregation is still alive and well in the United States, with different racial or\nethnic groups often segregated by neighborhood, borough, or parish. Sociologists\nuse segregation indices to measure racial segregation of different races in different areas. The indices employ a scale from zero to 100, where zero is the\nmost integrated and 100 is the least. In the New York metropolitan area, for\ninstance, the black-white segregation index was seventy-nine for the years 2005\u2013\n2009. This means that 79 percent of either blacks or whites would have to move\nin order for each neighborhood to have the same racial balance as the whole\nmetro region (Population Studies Center 2010).\nPluralism\nPluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a \u201csalad bowl\u201d: a\ngreat mixture of different cultures where each culture retains its own identity and\nyet adds to the flavor of the whole. True pluralism is characterized by mutual\nrespect on the part of all cultures, both dominant and subordinate, creating a\nmulticultural environment of acceptance. In reality, true pluralism is a difficult\ngoal to reach. In the United States, the mutual respect required by pluralism is\noften missing, and the nation\u2019s past pluralist model of a melting pot posits a\nsociety where cultural differences aren\u2019t embraced as much as erased.\nAssimilation\nAssimilation describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives\nup its own identity by taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture. In the\nUnited States, which has a history of welcoming and absorbing immigrants from\ndifferent lands, assimilation has been a function of immigration. For many immigrants to the United States, the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of\nfreedom and a new life. Unfortunately, they often encounter prejudice and\ndiscrimination. (Photo courtesy of Mark Heard/flickr)\nMost people in the United States have immigrant ancestors. In relatively recent\nhistory, between 1890 and 1920, the United States became home to around 24\nmillion immigrants. In the decades since then, further waves of immigrants have\ncome to these shores and have eventually been absorbed into U.S. culture,\nsometimes after facing extended periods of prejudice and discrimination.\nAssimilation may lead to the loss of the minority group\u2019s cultural identity as they\nbecome absorbed into the dominant culture, but assimilation has minimal to no\nimpact on the majority group\u2019s cultural identity.\nSome groups may keep only symbolic gestures of their original ethnicity. For\ninstance, many Irish Americans may celebrate Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, many Hindu\nAmericans enjoy a Diwali festival, and many Mexican Americans may\ncelebrate Cinco de Mayo (a May 5 acknowledgment of Mexico's victory at the\n1862 Battle of Puebla). However, for the rest of the year, other aspects of their\noriginating culture may be forgotten. Assimilation is antithetical to the \u201csalad bowl\u201d created by pluralism; rather than\nmaintaining their own cultural flavor, subordinate cultures give up their own\ntraditions in order to conform to their new environment. Sociologists measure the\ndegree to which immigrants have assimilated to a new culture with four\nbenchmarks: socioeconomic status, spatial concentration, language assimilation,\nand intermarriage. When faced with racial and ethnic discrimination, it can be\ndifficult for new immigrants to fully assimilate. Language assimilation, in\nparticular, can be a formidable barrier, limiting employment and educational\noptions and therefore constraining growth in socioeconomic status.\nAmalgamation\nAmalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group\ncombine to form a new group. Amalgamation creates the classic \u201cmelting pot\u201d\nanalogy; unlike the \u201csalad bowl,\u201d in which each culture retains its individuality,\nthe \u201cmelting pot\u201d ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new\nculture entirely.\nAmalgamation, also known as miscegenation, is achieved through intermarriage\nbetween races. In the United States, antimiscegenation laws flourished in the\nSouth during the Jim Crow era. It wasn\u2019t until 1967\u2019s Loving v. Virginia that the\nlast antimiscegenation law was struck from the books, making these laws\nunconstitutional.\nSummary\nIntergroup relations range from a tolerant approach of pluralism to intolerance as\nsevere as genocide. In pluralism, groups retain their own identity. In assimilation,\ngroups conform to the identity of the dominant group. In amalgamation, groups\ncombine to form a new group identity.\nGlossary\namalgamation\nthe process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to\nform a new group\nassimilation the process by which a minority individual or group takes on the\ncharacteristics of the dominant culture\nexpulsion\nthe act of a dominant group forcing a subordinate group to leave a certain\narea or even the country\ngenocide\nthe deliberate annihilation of a targeted (usually subordinate) group\npluralism\nthe ideal of the United States as a \u201csalad bowl:\u201d a mixture of different\ncultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the\n\u201cflavor\u201d of the whole\nsegregation\nthe physical separation of two groups, particularly in residence, but also in\nworkplace and social functions\nReferences\nAsi, Maryam, and Daniel Beaulieu. 2013. \u201cArab Households in the United States: 2006\u20132010.\u201d U.S. Census Bureau.\nRetrieved November 19, 2014 (http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr10-20.pdf).\nLewy, Guenter. 2004. \u201cWere American Indians the Victims of Genocide?\u201d Retrieved December 6, 2011\n(http://hnn.us/articles/7302.html).\nNorris, Tina, Paula L.

And let us not forget the forced immigration of African slaves. Most of\nthese groups underwent a period of disenfranchisement in which they were\nrelegated to the bottom of the social hierarchy before they managed (for those\nwho could) to achieve social mobility. Today, our society is multicultural, although\nthe extent to which this multiculturality is embraced varies, and the many\nmanifestations of multiculturalism carry significant political repercussions. The\nsections below will describe how several groups became part of U.S. society,\ndiscuss the history of intergroup relations for each faction, and assess each\ngroup\u2019s status today.\nNative Americans\nThe only nonimmigrant ethnic group in the United States, Native Americans once\nnumbered in the millions but by 2010 made up only 0.9 percent of U.S. populace;\nsee above (U.S. Census 2010). Currently, about 2.9 million people identify\nthemselves as Native American alone, while an additional 2.3 million identify\nthem as Native American mixed with another ethnic group (Norris, Vines, and\nHoeffel 2012).\nSPORTS TEAMS WITH NATIVE AMERICAN NAMES Many Native Americans (and others) believe sports teams with names like the\nIndians, Braves, and Warriors perpetuate unwelcome stereotypes. (Photo (a)\ncourtesy of public domain/Wikimedia Commons; Photo (b) courtesy of Chris\nBrown/flickr) The sports world abounds with team names like the Indians, the Warriors, the\nBraves, and even the Savages and Redskins. These names arise from historically\nprejudiced views of Native Americans as fierce, brave, and strong savages:\nattributes that would be beneficial to a sports team, but are not necessarily\nbeneficial to people in the United States who should be seen as more than just\nfierce savages.\nSince the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the National Congress of American\nIndians (NCAI) has been campaigning against the use of such mascots, asserting\nthat the \u201cwarrior savage myth . . . reinforces the racist view that Indians are\nuncivilized and uneducated and it has been used to justify policies of forced\nassimilation and destruction of Indian culture\u201d (NCAI Resolution #TUL-05-087\n2005). The campaign has met with only limited success. While some teams have\nchanged their names, hundreds of professional, college, and K\u201312 school teams\nstill have names derived from this stereotype. Another group, American Indian\nCultural Support (AICS), is especially concerned with the use of such names at K\u2013\n12 schools, influencing children when they should be gaining a fuller and more\nrealistic understanding of Native Americans than such stereotypes supply.\nWhat do you think about such names? Should they be allowed or banned? What\nargument would a symbolic interactionist make on this topic?\nHow and Why They Came\nThe earliest immigrants to America arrived millennia before European\nimmigrants. Dates of the migration are debated with estimates ranging from\nbetween 45,000 and 12,000 BCE. It is thought that early Indians migrated to this\nnew land in search of big game to hunt, which they found in huge herds of grazing\nherbivores in the Americas. Over the centuries and then the millennia, Native\nAmerican culture blossomed into an intricate web of hundreds of interconnected\ntribes, each with its own customs, traditions, languages, and religions.\nHistory of Intergroup Relations\nNative American culture prior to European settlement is referred to as Pre-\nColumbian: that is, prior to the coming of Christopher Columbus in 1492.\nMistakenly believing that he had landed in the East Indies, Columbus named the\nindigenous people \u201cIndians,\u201d a name that has persisted for centuries despite being a geographical misnomer and one used to blanket 500 distinct groups who\neach have their own languages and traditions.\nThe history of intergroup relations between European colonists and Native\nAmericans is a brutal one. As discussed in the section on genocide, the effect of\nEuropean settlement of the Americans was to nearly destroy the indigenous\npopulation. And although Native Americans\u2019 lack of immunity to European\ndiseases caused the most deaths, overt mistreatment of Native Americans by\nEuropeans was devastating as well.\nFrom the first Spanish colonists to the French, English, and Dutch who followed,\nEuropean settlers took what land they wanted and expanded across the continent\nat will. If indigenous people tried to retain their stewardship of the land,\nEuropeans fought them off with superior weapons. A key element of this issue is\nthe indigenous view of land and land ownership. Most tribes considered the earth\na living entity whose resources they were stewards of, the concepts of land\nownership and conquest didn\u2019t exist in Native American society. Europeans\u2019\ndomination of the Americas was indeed a conquest; one scholar points out that\nNative Americans are the only minority group in the United States whose\nsubordination occurred purely through conquest by the dominant group (Marger\n1993).\nAfter the establishment of the United States government, discrimination against\nNative Americans was codified and formalized in a series of laws intended to\nsubjugate them and keep them from gaining any power. Some of the most\nimpactful laws are as follows:\n\uf0b7 The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced the relocation of any native tribes\neast of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river.\n\uf0b7 The Indian Appropriation Acts funded further removals and declared that\nno Indian tribe could be recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or\npower with which the U.S. government would have to make treaties. This\nmade it even easier for the U.S. government to take land it wanted.\n\uf0b7 The Dawes Act of 1887 reversed the policy of isolating Native Americans on\nreservations, instead forcing them onto individual properties that were\nintermingled with white settlers, thereby reducing their capacity for power\nas a group. Native American culture was further eroded by the establishment of Indian\nboarding schools in the late nineteenth century. These schools, run by both\nChristian missionaries and the United States government, had the express\npurpose of \u201ccivilizing\u201d Native American children and assimilating them into white\nsociety. The boarding schools were located off-reservation to ensure that children\nwere separated from their families and culture. Schools forced children to cut\ntheir hair, speak English, and practice Christianity. Physical and sexual abuses\nwere rampant for decades; only in 1987 did the Bureau of Indian Affairs issue a\npolicy on sexual abuse in boarding schools. Some scholars argue that many of the\nproblems that Native Americans face today result from almost a century of\nmistreatment at these boarding schools.\nCurrent Status\nThe eradication of Native American culture continued until the 1960s, when\nNative Americans were able to participate in and benefit from the civil rights\nmovement. The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 guaranteed Indian tribes most of\nthe rights of the United States Bill of Rights. New laws like the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act of 1975 and the Education Assistance Act of the same year\nrecognized tribal governments and gave them more power. Indian boarding\nschools have dwindled to only a few, and Native American cultural groups are\nstriving to preserve and maintain old traditions to keep them from being lost\nforever.\nHowever, Native Americans (some of whom now wished to be called American\nIndians so as to avoid the \u201csavage\u201d connotations of the term \u201cnative\u201d) still suffer\nthe effects of centuries of degradation. Long-term poverty, inadequate education,\ncultural dislocation, and high rates of unemployment contribute to Native\nAmerican populations falling to the bottom of the economic spectrum. Native\nAmericans also suffer disproportionately with lower life expectancies than most\ngroups in the United States.\nAfrican Americans\nAs discussed in the section on race, the term African American can be a misnomer\nfor many individuals. Many people with dark skin may have their more recent\nroots in Europe or the Caribbean, seeing themselves as Dominican American or\nDutch American. Further, actual immigrants from Africa may feel that they have more of a claim to the term African American than those who are many\ngenerations removed from ancestors who originally came to this country. This\nsection will focus on the experience of the slaves who were transported from\nAfrica to the United States, and their progeny. Currently, the U.S. Census Bureau\n(2014) estimates that 13.2 percent of the United States' population is black.\nHow and Why They Came\nIf Native Americans are the only minority group whose subordinate status\noccurred by conquest, African Americans are the exemplar minority group in the\nUnited States whose ancestors did not come here by choice. A Dutch sea captain\nbrought the first Africans to the Virginia colony of Jamestown in 1619 and sold\nthem as indentured servants. This was not an uncommon practice for either\nblacks or whites, and indentured servants were in high demand. For the next\ncentury, black and white indentured servants worked side by side. But the\ngrowing agricultural economy demanded greater and cheaper labor, and by 1705,\nVirginia passed the slave codes declaring that any foreign-born non-Christian\ncould be a slave, and that slaves were considered property.\nThe next 150 years saw the rise of U.S. slavery, with black Africans being\nkidnapped from their own lands and shipped to the New World on the trans-\nAtlantic journey known as the Middle Passage. Once in the Americas, the black\npopulation grew until U.S.-born blacks outnumbered those born in Africa. But\ncolonial (and later, U.S.) slave codes declared that the child of a slave was a slave,\nso the slave class was created. By 1808, the slave trade was internal in the United\nStates, with slaves being bought and sold across state lines like livestock.\nHistory of Intergroup Relations\nThere is no starker illustration of the dominant-subordinate group relationship\nthan that of slavery. In order to justify their severely discriminatory behavior,\nslaveholders and their supporters had to view blacks as innately inferior. Slaves\nwere denied even the most basic rights of citizenship, a crucial factor for\nslaveholders and their supporters. Slavery poses an excellent example of conflict\ntheory\u2019s perspective on race relations; the dominant group needed complete\ncontrol over the subordinate group in order to maintain its power. Whippings,\nexecutions, rapes, denial of schooling and health care were all permissible and\nwidely practiced. Slavery eventually became an issue over which the nation divided into\ngeographically and ideologically distinct factions, leading to the Civil War. And\nwhile the abolition of slavery on moral grounds was certainly a catalyst to war, it\nwas not the only driving force. Students of U.S. history will know that the\ninstitution of slavery was crucial to the Southern economy, whose production of\ncrops like rice, cotton, and tobacco relied on the virtually limitless and cheap\nlabor that slavery provided. In contrast, the North didn\u2019t benefit economically\nfrom slavery, resulting in an economic disparity tied to racial/political issues.\nA century later, the civil rights movement was characterized by boycotts,\nmarches, sit-ins, and freedom rides: demonstrations by a subordinate group that\nwould no longer willingly submit to domination. The major blow to America\u2019s\nformally institutionalized racism was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This Act, which is\nstill followed today, banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin. Some sociologists, however, would argue that institutionalized\nracism persists.\nCurrent Status\nAlthough government-sponsored, formalized discrimination against African\nAmericans has been outlawed, true equality does not yet exist. The National\nUrban League\u2019s 2011 Equality Index reports that blacks\u2019 overall equality level with\nwhites has dropped in the past year, from 71.5 percent to 71.1 percent in 2010.\nThe Index, which has been published since 2005, notes a growing trend of\nincreased inequality with whites, especially in the areas of unemployment,\ninsurance coverage, and incarceration. Blacks also trail whites considerably in the\nareas of economics, health, and education.\nTo what degree do racism and prejudice contribute to this continued inequality?\nThe answer is complex. 2008 saw the election of this country\u2019s first African\nAmerican president: Barack Hussein Obama. Despite being popularly identified as\nblack, we should note that President Obama is of a mixed background that is\nequally white, and although all presidents have been publicly mocked at times\n(Gerald Ford was depicted as a klutz, Bill Clinton as someone who could not\ncontrol his libido), a startling percentage of the critiques of Obama have been\nbased on his race. The most blatant of these was the controversy over his birth\ncertificate, where the \u201cbirther\u201d movement questioned his citizenship and right to hold office. Although blacks have come a long way from slavery, the echoes of\ncenturies of disempowerment are still evident.\nAsian Americans\nLike many groups this section discusses, Asian Americans represent a great\ndiversity of cultures and backgrounds. The experience of a Japanese American\nwhose family has been in the United States for three generations will be\ndrastically different from a Laotian American who has only been in the United\nStates for a few years. This section primarily discusses Chinese, Japanese, and\nVietnamese immigrants and shows the differences between their experiences.\nThe most recent estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau (2014) suggest about 5.3\npercent of the population identify themselves as Asian.\nHow and Why They Came\nThe national and ethnic diversity of Asian American immigration history is\nreflected in the variety of their experiences in joining U.S. society. Asian\nimmigrants have come to the United States in waves, at different times, and for\ndifferent reasons.\nThe first Asian immigrants to come to the United States in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury were Chinese. These immigrants were primarily men whose intention was\nto work for several years in order to earn incomes to support their families in\nChina. Their main destination was the American West, where the Gold Rush was\ndrawing people with its lure of abundant money. The construction of the\nTranscontinental Railroad was underway at this time, and the Central Pacific\nsection hired thousands of migrant Chinese men to complete the laying of rails\nacross the rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range. Chinese men also engaged in\nother manual labor like mining and agricultural work. The work was grueling and\nunderpaid, but like many immigrants, they persevered.\nJapanese immigration began in the 1880s, on the heels of the Chinese Exclusion\nAct of 1882. Many Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii to participate in the\nsugar industry; others came to the mainland, especially to California. Unlike the\nChinese, however, the Japanese had a strong government that negotiated with\nthe U.S. government to ensure the well-being of their immigrants. Japanese men\nwere able to bring their wives and families to the United States, and were thus able to produce second- and third-generation Japanese Americans more quickly\nthan their Chinese counterparts.\nThe most recent large-scale Asian immigration came from Korea and Vietnam and\nlargely took place during the second half of the twentieth century. While Korean\nimmigration has been fairly gradual, Vietnamese immigration occurred primarily\npost-1975, after the fall of Saigon and the establishment of restrictive communist\npolicies in Vietnam. Whereas many Asian immigrants came to the United States\nto seek better economic opportunities, Vietnamese immigrants came as political\nrefugees, seeking asylum from harsh conditions in their homeland. The Refugee\nAct of 1980 helped them to find a place to settle in the United States.\nThirty-five Vietnamese refugees wait to be taken aboard the amphibious USS Blue\nRidge (LCC-19). They are being rescued from a thirty-five-foot fishing boat 350\nmiles northeast of Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, after spending eight days at sea.\n(Photo courtesy of U.S. Navy/Wikimedia Commons) History of Intergroup Relations\nChinese immigration came to an abrupt end with the Chinese Exclusion Act of\n1882. This act was a result of anti-Chinese sentiment burgeoned by a depressed\neconomy and loss of jobs. White workers blamed Chinese migrants for taking\njobs, and the passage of the Act meant the number of Chinese workers\ndecreased. Chinese men did not have the funds to return to China or to bring\ntheir families to the United States, so they remained physically and culturally\nsegregated in the Chinatowns of large cities. Later legislation, the Immigration Act\nof 1924, further curtailed Chinese immigration. The Act included the race-based\nNational Origins Act, which was aimed at keeping U.S. ethnic stock as undiluted as\npossible by reducing \u201cundesirable\u201d immigrants. It was not until after the\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that Chinese immigration again\nincreased, and many Chinese families were reunited.\nAlthough Japanese Americans have deep, long-reaching roots in the United\nStates, their history here has not always been smooth. The California Alien Land\nLaw of 1913 was aimed at them and other Asian immigrants, and it prohibited\naliens from owning land. An even uglier action was the Japanese internment\ncamps of World War II, discussed earlier as an illustration of expulsion.\nCurrent Status\nAsian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice,\ndespite the seemingly positive stereotype as the model minority. The model\nminority stereotype is applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching\nsignificant educational, professional, and socioeconomic levels without\nchallenging the existing establishment.\nThis stereotype is typically applied to Asian groups in the United States, and it can\nresult in unrealistic expectations, by putting a stigma on members of this group\nthat do not meet the expectations. Stereotyping all Asians as smart and capable\ncan also lead to a lack of much-needed government assistance and to educational\nand professional discrimination.\nHispanic Americans\nHispanic Americans have a wide range of backgrounds and nationalities. The\nsegment of the U.S. population that self-identifies as Hispanic in 2013 was recently estimated at 17.1 percent of the total (U.S. Census Bureau 2014).\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. Census, about 75 percent of the respondents who\nidentify as Hispanic report being of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin. Of the\ntotal Hispanic group, 60 percent reported as Mexican, 44 percent reported as\nCuban, and 9 percent reported as Puerto Rican. Remember that the U.S. Census\nallows people to report as being more than one ethnicity.\nNot only are there wide differences among the different origins that make up the\nHispanic American population, but there are also different names for the group\nitself. The 2010 U.S. Census states that \u201cHispanic\u201d or \u201cLatino\u201d refers to a person of\nCuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish\nculture or origin regardless of race.\u201d There have been some disagreements over\nwhether Hispanic or Latino is the correct term for a group this diverse, and\nwhether it would be better for people to refer to themselves as being of their\norigin specifically, for example, Mexican American or Dominican American. This\nsection will compare the experiences of Mexican Americans and Cuban\nAmericans.\nHow and Why They Came\nMexican Americans form the largest Hispanic subgroup and also the oldest.\nMexican migration to the United States started in the early 1900s in response to\nthe need for cheap agricultural labor. Mexican migration was often circular;\nworkers would stay for a few years and then go back to Mexico with more money\nthan they could have made in their country of origin. The length of Mexico\u2019s\nshared border with the United States has made immigration easier than for many\nother immigrant groups.\nCuban Americans are the second-largest Hispanic subgroup, and their history is\nquite different from that of Mexican Americans. The main wave of Cuban\nimmigration to the United States started after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959\nand reached its crest with the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Castro\u2019s Cuban Revolution\nushered in an era of communism that continues to this day. To avoid having their\nassets seized by the government, many wealthy and educated Cubans migrated\nnorth, generally to the Miami area. History of Intergroup Relations\nFor several decades, Mexican workers crossed the long border into the United\nStates, both legally and illegally, to work in the fields that provided produce for\nthe developing United States. Western growers needed a steady supply of labor,\nand the 1940s and 1950s saw the official federal Bracero Program (bracero is\nSpanish for strong-arm) that offered protection to Mexican guest workers.\nInterestingly, 1954 also saw the enactment of \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d which\ndeported thousands of illegal Mexican workers. From these examples, we can see\nthe U.S. treatment of immigration from Mexico has been ambivalent at best.\nSociologist Douglas Massey (2006) suggests that although the average standard of\nliving than in Mexico may be lower in the United States, it is not so low as to make\npermanent migration the goal of most Mexicans. However, the strengthening of\nthe border that began with 1986\u2019s Immigration Reform and Control Act has made\none-way migration the rule for most Mexicans. Massey argues that the rise of\nillegal one-way immigration of Mexicans is a direct outcome of the law that was\nintended to reduce it.\nCuban Americans, perhaps because of their relative wealth and education level at\nthe time of immigration, have fared better than many immigrants. Further,\nbecause they were fleeing a Communist country, they were given refugee status\nand offered protection and social services. The Cuban Migration Agreement of\n1995 has curtailed legal immigration from Cuba, leading many Cubans to try to\nimmigrate illegally by boat. According to a 2009 report from the Congressional\nResearch Service, the U.S. government applies a \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d policy\ntoward Cuban immigrants; Cubans who are intercepted while still at sea will be\nreturned to Cuba, while those who reach the shore will be permitted to stay in\nthe United States.\nCurrent Status\nMexican Americans, especially those who are here illegally, are at the center of a\nnational debate about immigration. Myers (2007) observes that no other minority\ngroup (except the Chinese) has immigrated to the United States in such an\nenvironment of illegality. He notes that in some years, three times as many\nMexican immigrants may have entered the United States illegally as those who\narrived legally. It should be noted that this is due to enormous disparity of economic opportunity on two sides of an open border, not because of any\ninherent inclination to break laws. In his report, \u201cMeasuring Immigrant\nAssimilation in the United States,\u201d Jacob Vigdor (2008) states that Mexican\nimmigrants experience relatively low rates of economic and civic assimilation. He\nfurther suggests that \u201cthe slow rates of economic and civic assimilation set\nMexicans apart from other immigrants, and may reflect the fact that the large\nnumbers of Mexican immigrants residing in the United States illegally have few\nopportunities to advance themselves along these dimensions.\u201d\nBy contrast, Cuban Americans are often seen as a model minority group within\nthe larger Hispanic group. Many Cubans had higher socioeconomic status when\nthey arrived in this country, and their anti-Communist agenda has made them\nwelcome refugees to this country. In south Florida, especially, Cuban Americans\nare active in local politics and professional life. As with Asian Americans, however,\nbeing a model minority can mask the issue of powerlessness that these minority\ngroups face in U.S. society.\nARIZONA\u2019S SENATE BILL 1070\nProtesters in Arizona dispute the harsh new anti-immigration law. (Photo\ncourtesy of rprathap/flickr) As both legal and illegal immigrants, and with high population numbers, Mexican\nAmericans are often the target of stereotyping, racism, and discrimination. A\nharsh example of this is in Arizona, where a stringent immigration law\u2014known as\nSB 1070 (for Senate Bill 1070)\u2014has caused a nationwide controversy. The law\nrequires that during a lawful stop, detention, or arrest, Arizona police officers\nmust establish the immigration status of anyone they suspect may be here\nillegally. The law makes it a crime for individuals to fail to have documents\nconfirming their legal status, and it gives police officers the right to detain people\nthey suspect may be in the country illegally.\nTo many, the most troublesome aspect of this law is the latitude it affords police\nofficers in terms of whose citizenship they may question. Having \u201creasonable\nsuspicion that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United\nStates\u201d is reason enough to demand immigration papers (Senate Bill 1070 2010).\nCritics say this law will encourage racial profiling (the illegal practice of law\nenforcement using race as a basis for suspecting someone of a crime), making it\nhazardous to be caught \u201cDriving While Brown,\u201d a takeoff on the legal term Driving\nWhile Intoxicated (DWI) or the slang reference of \u201cDriving While Black.\u201d Driving\nWhile Brown refers to the likelihood of getting pulled over just for being\nnonwhite.\nSB 1070 has been the subject of many lawsuits, from parties as diverse as Arizona\npolice officers, the American Civil Liberties Union, and even the federal\ngovernment, which is suing on the basis of Arizona contradicting federal\nimmigration laws (ACLU 2011). The future of SB 1070 is uncertain, but many other\nstates have tried or are trying to pass similar measures. Do you think such\nmeasures are appropriate?\nArab Americans\nIf ever a category was hard to define, the various groups lumped under the name\n\u201cArab American\u201d is it. After all, Hispanic Americans or Asian Americans are so\ndesignated because of their counties of origin. But for Arab Americans, their\ncountry of origin\u2014Arabia\u2014has not existed for centuries. In addition, Arab\nAmericans represent all religious practices, despite the stereotype that all Arabic\npeople practice Islam. As Myers (2007) asserts, not all Arabs are Muslim, and not\nall Muslims are Arab, complicating the stereotype of what it means to be an Arab\nAmerican. Geographically, the Arab region comprises the Middle East and parts of northern Africa. People whose ancestry lies in that area or who speak primarily\nArabic may consider themselves Arabs.\nThe U.S. Census has struggled with the issue of Arab identity. The 2010 Census, as\nin previous years, did not offer an \u201cArab\u201d box to check under the question of race.\nIndividuals who want to be counted as Arabs had to check the box for \u201cSome\nother race\u201d and then write in their race. However, when the Census data is tallied,\nthey will be marked as white. This is problematic, however, denying Arab\nAmericans opportunities for federal assistance. According to the best estimates of\nthe U.S. Census Bureau, the Arabic population in the United States grew from\n850,000 in 1990 to 1.2 million in 2000, an increase of .07 percent (Asi and\nBeaulieu 2013).\nWhy They Came\nThe first Arab immigrants came to this country in the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries. They were predominantly Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian\nChristians, and they came to escape persecution and to make a better life. These\nearly immigrants and their descendants, who were more likely to think of\nthemselves as Syrian or Lebanese than Arab, represent almost half of the Arab\nAmerican population today (Myers 2007). Restrictive immigration policies from\nthe 1920s until 1965 curtailed all immigration, but Arab immigration since 1965\nhas been steady. Immigrants from this time period have been more likely to be\nMuslim and more highly educated, escaping political unrest and looking for better\nopportunities.\nHistory of Intergroup Relations\nRelations between Arab Americans and the dominant majority have been marked\nby mistrust, misinformation, and deeply entrenched beliefs. Helen Samhan of the\nArab American Institute suggests that Arab-Israeli conflicts in the 1970s\ncontributed significantly to cultural and political anti-Arab sentiment in the United\nStates (2001). The United States has historically supported the State of Israel,\nwhile some Middle Eastern countries deny the existence of the Israeli state.\nDisputes over these issues have involved Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and\nPalestine. As is often the case with stereotyping and prejudice, the actions of extremists\ncome to define the entire group, regardless of the fact that most U.S. citizens with\nties to the Middle Eastern community condemn terrorist actions, as do most\ninhabitants of the Middle East. Would it be fair to judge all Catholics by the events\nof the Inquisition? Of course, the United States was deeply affected by the events\nof September 11, 2001. This event has left a deep scar on the American psyche,\nand it has fortified anti-Arab sentiment for a large percentage of Americans. In\nthe first month after 9/11, hundreds of hate crimes were perpetrated against\npeople who looked like they might be of Arab descent. The proposed Park51 Muslim Community Center generated heated controversy\ndue to its close proximity to Ground Zero. In these photos, people march in\nprotest against the center, while counter-protesters demonstrate their support.\n(Photos (a) and (b) courtesy of David Shankbone/Wikimedia Commons)\nCurrent Status\nAlthough the rate of hate crimes against Arab Americans has slowed, Arab\nAmericans are still victims of racism and prejudice. Racial profiling has proceeded\nagainst Arab Americans as a matter of course since 9/11. Particularly when\nengaged in air travel, being young and Arab-looking is enough to warrant a special\nsearch or detainment. This Islamophobia (irrational fear of or hatred against\nMuslims) does not show signs of abating. Scholars noted that white domestic\nterrorists like Timothy McVeigh, who detonated a bomb at an Oklahoma\ncourthouse in 1995, have not inspired similar racial profiling or hate crimes\nagainst whites.\nWhite Ethnic Americans\nAs we have seen, there is no minority group that fits easily in a category or that\ncan be described simply. While sociologists believe that individual experiences\ncan often be understood in light of their social characteristics (such as race, class,\nor gender), we must balance this perspective with awareness that no two\nindividuals\u2019 experiences are alike. Making generalizations can lead to stereotypes\nand prejudice. The same is true for white ethnic Americans, who come from\ndiverse backgrounds and have had a great variety of experiences. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2014), 77.7 percent of U.S. adults currently identify\nthemselves as white alone. In this section, we will focus on German, Irish, Italian,\nand Eastern European immigrants.\nWhy They Came\nWhite ethnic Europeans formed the second and third great waves of immigration,\nfrom the early nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. They joined a\nnewly minted United States that was primarily made up of white Protestants from\nEngland. While most immigrants came searching for a better life, their\nexperiences were not all the same.\nThe first major influx of European immigrants came from Germany and Ireland,\nstarting in the 1820s. Germans came both for economic opportunity and to\nescape political unrest and military conscription, especially after the Revolutions\nof 1848. Many German immigrants of this period were political refugees: liberals\nwho wanted to escape from an oppressive government. They were well-off\nenough to make their way inland, and they formed heavily German enclaves in\nthe Midwest that exist to this day.\nThe Irish immigrants of the same time period were not always as well off\nfinancially, especially after the Irish Potato Famine of 1845. Irish immigrants\nsettled mainly in the cities of the East Coast, where they were employed as\nlaborers and where they faced significant discrimination.\nGerman and Irish immigration continued into the late 19th century and earlier\n20th century, at which point the numbers for Southern and Eastern European\nimmigrants started growing as well. Italians, mainly from the Southern part of the\ncountry, began arriving in large numbers in the 1890s. Eastern European\nimmigrants\u2014people from Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary\u2014started\narriving around the same time. Many of these Eastern Europeans were peasants\nforced into a hardscrabble existence in their native lands; political unrest, land\nshortages, and crop failures drove them to seek better opportunities in the United\nStates. The Eastern European immigration wave also included Jewish people\nescaping pogroms (anti-Jewish uprisings) of Eastern Europe and the Pale of\nSettlement in what was then Poland and Russia. History of Intergroup Relations\nIn a broad sense, German immigrants were not victimized to the same degree as\nmany of the other subordinate groups this section discusses. While they may not\nhave been welcomed with open arms, they were able to settle in enclaves and\nestablish roots. A notable exception to this was during the lead up to World War I\nand through World War II, when anti-German sentiment was virulent.\nIrish immigrants, many of whom were very poor, were more of an underclass\nthan the Germans. In Ireland, the English had oppressed the Irish for centuries,\neradicating their language and culture and discriminating against their religion\n(Catholicism). Although the Irish had a larger population than the English, they\nwere a subordinate group. This dynamic reached into the new world, where Anglo\nAmericans saw Irish immigrants as a race apart: dirty, lacking ambition, and\nsuitable for only the most menial jobs. In fact, Irish immigrants were subject to\ncriticism identical to that with which the dominant group characterized African\nAmericans. By necessity, Irish immigrants formed tight communities segregated\nfrom their Anglo neighbors.\nThe later wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was also subject\nto intense discrimination and prejudice. In particular, the dominant group\u2014which\nnow included second- and third-generation Germans and Irish\u2014saw Italian\nimmigrants as the dregs of Europe and worried about the purity of the American\nrace (Myers 2007). Italian immigrants lived in segregated slums in Northeastern\ncities, and in some cases were even victims of violence and lynchings similar to\nwhat African Americans endured. They worked harder and were paid less than\nother workers, often doing the dangerous work that other laborers were reluctant\nto take on.\nCurrent Status\nThe U.S. Census from 2008 shows that 16.5 percent of respondents reported\nbeing of German descent: the largest group in the country. For many years,\nGerman Americans endeavored to maintain a strong cultural identity, but they\nare now culturally assimilated into the dominant culture. There are now more Irish Americans in the United States than there are Irish in\nIreland. One of the country\u2019s largest cultural groups, Irish Americans have slowly\nachieved acceptance and assimilation into the dominant group.\nMyers (2007) states that Italian Americans\u2019 cultural assimilation is \u201calmost\ncomplete, but with remnants of ethnicity.\u201d The presence of \u201cLittle Italy\u201d\nneighborhoods\u2014originally segregated slums where Italians congregated in the\nnineteenth century\u2014exist today. While tourists flock to the saints\u2019 festivals in\nLittle Italies, most Italian Americans have moved to the suburbs at the same rate\nas other white groups.\nSummary\nThe history of the U.S. people contains an infinite variety of experiences that\nsociologist understand follow patterns. From the indigenous people who first\ninhabited these lands to the waves of immigrants over the past 500 years,\nmigration is an experience with many shared characteristics. Most groups have\nexperienced various degrees of prejudice and discrimination as they have gone\nthrough the process of assimilation.\nGlossary\nmodel minority\nthe stereotype applied to a minority group that is seen as reaching higher\neducational, professional, and socioeconomic levels without protest against\nthe majority establishment\nFurther Research\nAre people interested in reclaiming their ethnic identities?

In this module, we will discuss findings from studies comparing\nNorth American (United States, Canada) and East Asian (Chinese, Japanese,\nKorean) contexts. These studies reveal both cultural similarities and differences in\nvarious aspects of emotional life. Throughout, we will highlight the scientific and\npractical importance of these findings and conclude with recommendations for\nfuture research.\nLearning Objectives\nReview the history of cross-cultural studies of emotion\nLearn about recent empirical findings and theories of culture and emotion\nUnderstand why cultural differences in emotion matter\nExplore current and future directions in culture and emotion research\nTake a moment and imagine you are traveling in a country you\u2019ve never been to\nbefore. Everything\u2014the sights, the smells, the sounds\u2014seems strange. People\nare speaking a language you don\u2019t understand and wearing clothes unlike yours.\nBut they greet you with a smile and you sense that, despite the differences you\nobserve, deep down inside these people have the same feelings as you. But is this\ntrue? Do people from opposite ends of the world really feel the same emotions?\nWhile most scholars agree that members of different cultures may vary in the\nfoods they eat, the languages they speak, and the holidays they celebrate, there is\ndisagreement about the extent to which culture shapes people\u2019s emotions and\nfeelings\u2014including what people feel, what they express, and what they do during\nan emotional event. Understanding how culture shapes people\u2019s emotional lives\nand what impact emotion has on psychological health and well-being in different cultures will not only advance the study of human behavior but will also benefit\nmulticultural societies. Across a variety of settings\u2014academic, business,\nmedical\u2014people worldwide are coming into more contact with people from\nforeign cultures. In order to communicate and function effectively in such\nsituations, we must understand the ways cultural ideas and practices shape our\nemotions.\nHistorical Background\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, social scientists tended to fall into either one of two\ncamps. The universalist camp claimed that, despite cultural differences in\ncustoms and traditions, at a fundamental level all humans feel similarly. These\nuniversalists believed that emotions evolved as a response to the environments of\nour primordial ancestors, so they are the same across all cultures. Indeed, people\noften describe their emotions as \u201cautomatic,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201cphysiological,\u201d and\n\u201cinstinctual,\u201d supporting the view that emotions are hard-wired and universal. Universalists point to our prehistoric ancestors as the source of emotions that all\nhumans share. [Image: Stefan Sheer, https://goo.gl/x56mw9, CC BY-SA 3.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/tCiqlm]\nThe social constructivist camp, however, claimed that despite a common\nevolutionary heritage, different groups of humans evolved to adapt to their\ndistinctive environments. And because human environments vary so widely,\npeople\u2019s emotions are also culturally variable. For instance, Lutz (1988) argued\nthat many Western views of emotion assume that emotions are \u201csingular events\nsituated within individuals.\u201d However, people from Ifaluk (a small island near Micronesia) view emotions as \u201cexchanges between individuals\u201d (p. 212). Social\nconstructivists contended that because cultural ideas and practices are all-\nencompassing, people are often unaware of how their feelings are shaped by\ntheir culture. Therefore emotions can feel automatic, natural, physiological, and\ninstinctual, and yet still be primarily culturally shaped.\nIn the 1970s, Paul Ekman conducted one of the first scientific studies to address\nthe universalist\u2013social constructivist debate. He and Wallace Friesen devised a\nsystem to measure people\u2019s facial muscle activity, called the Facial Action Coding\nSystem (FACS; Ekman & Friesen, 1978). Using FACS, Ekman and Friesen analyzed\npeople\u2019s facial expressions and identified specific facial muscle configurations\nassociated with specific emotions, such as happiness, anger, sadness, fear,\ndisgust. Ekman and Friesen then took photos of people posing with these\ndifferent expressions (Figure 1). With the help of colleagues at different\nuniversities around the world, Ekman and Friesen showed these pictures to\nmembers of vastly different cultures, gave them a list of emotion words\n(translated into the relevant languages), and asked them to match the facial\nexpressions in the photos with their corresponding emotion words on the list\n(Ekman & Friesen, 1971; Ekman et al., 1987).\nAcross cultures, participants \u201crecognized\u201d the emotional facial expressions,\nmatching each picture with its \u201ccorrect\u201d emotion word at levels greater than\nchance. This led Ekman and his colleagues to conclude that there are universally\nrecognized emotional facial expressions. At the same time, though, they found\nconsiderable variability across cultures in recognition rates. For instance, whereas\n95% of U.S. participants associated a smile with \u201chappiness,\u201d only 69% of\nSumatran participants did. Similarly, 86% of U.S. participants associated wrinkling\nof the nose with \u201cdisgust,\u201d but only 60% of Japanese did (Ekman et al., 1987).\nEkman and colleagues interpreted this variation as demonstrating cultural\ndifferences in \u201cdisplay rules,\u201d or rules about what emotions are appropriate to\nshow in a given situation (Ekman, 1972). Indeed, since this initial work,\nMatsumoto and his colleagues have demonstrated widespread cultural\ndifferences in display rules (Safdar et al., 2009). One prominent example of such\ndifferences is biting one\u2019s tongue. In India, this signals embarrassment; however,\nin the U.S. this expression has no such meaning (Haidt & Keltner, 1999). Figure 1. Facial expressions associated with happiness, sadness, disgust, and\nanger based on the Facial Action Coding System. [Image: Paul Eckman, used with\npermission]\nThese findings suggest both cultural similarities and differences in the recognition\nof emotional facial expressions (although see Russell, 1994, for criticism of this\nwork). Interestingly, since the mid-2000s, increasing research has demonstrated\ncultural differences not only in display rules, but also the degree to which people\nfocus on the face (versus other aspects of the social context; Masuda, Ellsworth,\nMesquita, Leu, Tanida, & Van de Veerdonk, 2008), and on different features of\nthe face (Yuki, Maddux, & Matsuda, 2007) when perceiving others\u2019 emotions. For\nexample, people from the United States tend to focus on the mouth when\ninterpreting others\u2019 emotions, whereas people from Japan tend to focus on the\neyes.\nBut how does culture shape other aspects of emotional life\u2014such as how people\nemotionally respond to different situations, how they want to feel generally, and\nwhat makes them happy? Today, most scholars agree that emotions and other\nrelated states are multifaceted, and that cultural similarities and differences exist\nfor each facet. Thus, rather than classifying emotions\nas either universal or socially-constructed, scholars are now attempting to identify\nthe specific similarities and differences of emotional life across cultures. These\nendeavors are yielding new insights into the effects of cultural on emotion.\nCurrent and Research Theory Given the wide range of cultures and facets of emotion in the world, for the\nremainder of the module we will limit our scope to the two cultural contexts that\nhave received the most empirical attention by social scientists: North America\n(United States, Canada) and East Asia (China, Japan, and Korea). Social scientists\nhave focused on North American and East Asian contexts because they differ in\nobvious ways, including their geographical locations, histories, languages, and\nreligions. Moreover, since the 1980s large-scale studies have revealed that North\nAmerican and East Asian contexts differ in their overall values and attitudes, such\nas the prioritization of personal vs. group needs (individualism vs.\ncollectivism; Hofstede, 2001). Whereas North American contexts encourage\nmembers to prioritize personal over group needs (to be \u201cindividualistic\u201d), East\nAsian contexts encourage members to prioritize group over personal needs (to be\n\u201ccollectivistic\u201d).\nCultural Models of Self in North American and East Asian Contexts\nIn a landmark paper, cultural psychologists Markus and Kitayama (1991) proposed\nthat previously observed differences in individualism and collectivism translated\ninto different models of the self\u2014or one\u2019s personal concept of who s/he is as a\nperson. Specifically, the researchers argued that in North American contexts, the\ndominant model of the self is an independent one, in which being a person means\nbeing distinct from others and behaving accordingly across situations. In East\nAsian contexts, however, the dominant model of the self is an interdependent\none, in which being a person means being fundamentally connected to others and\nbeing responsive to situational demands. For example, in a classic study (Cousins,\n1989), American and Japanese students were administered the Twenty\nStatements Test, in which they were asked to complete the sentence stem, \u201cI am\n______,\u201d twenty times. U.S. participants were more likely than Japanese\nparticipants to complete the stem with psychological attributes (e.g., friendly,\ncheerful); Japanese participants, on the other hand, were more likely to complete\nthe stem with references to social roles and responsibilities (e.g., a daughter, a\nstudent) (Cousins, 1989). These different models of the self result in different\nprinciples for interacting with others. An independent model of self teaches\npeople to express themselves and try to influence others (i.e., change their\nenvironments to be consistent with their own beliefs and desires). In contrast, an\ninterdependent model of self teaches people to suppress their own beliefs and\ndesires and adjust to others\u2019 (i.e., fit in with their environment) (Heine, Lehman, Markus, & Kitayama, 1999; Morling, Kitayama, & Miyamoto, 2002; Weisz,\nRothbaum, & Blackburn, 1984). Markus and Kitayama (1991) argue that these\ndifferent models of self have significant implications for how people in Western\nand East Asian contexts feel.\nCultural Similarities and Differences in Emotion: Comparisons of North\nAmerican and East Asian Contexts\nA considerable body of empirical research suggests that these different models of\nself shape various aspects of emotional dynamics. Next we will discuss several\nways culture shapes emotion, starting with emotional response.\nPeople\u2019s Physiological Responses to Emotional Events Are Similar Across\nCultures, but Culture Influences People\u2019s Facial Expressive Behavior Although study participants from different cultural backgrounds reported similar\nemotions and levels of intensity when recalling important episodes in their lives,\nthere were significant differences in facial expressions in response to those\nemotions. [Image: Andrew Sweeney, https://goo.gl/Npc7Wm, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/H2QaA8]\nHow does culture influence people\u2019s responses to emotional events? Studies of\nemotional response tend to focus on three components: physiology (e.g., how\nfast one\u2019s heart beats), subjective experience (e.g., feeling intensely happy or\nsad), and facial expressive behavior (e.g., smiling or frowning). Although only a\nfew studies have simultaneously measured these different aspects of emotional\nresponse, those that do tend to observe more similarities than differences in\nphysiological responses between cultures. That is, regardless of culture, people\ntend to respond similarly in terms of physiological (or bodily) expression. For\ninstance, in one study, European American and Hmong (pronounced \u201cmuhng\u201d)\nAmerican participants were asked to relive various emotional episodes in their\nlives (e.g., when they lost something or someone they loved; when something\ngood happened) (Tsai, Chentsova-Dutton, Freire-Bebeau, & Przymus, 2002). At\nthe level of physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate), there were no differences in\nhow the participants responded. However, their facial expressive behavior told a\ndifferent story. When reliving events that elicited happiness, pride, and love,\nEuropean Americans smiled more frequently and more intensely than did their\nHmong counterparts\u2014though all participants reported feeling happy, proud, and\nin love at similar levels of intensity. And similar patterns have emerged in studies\ncomparing European Americans with Chinese Americans during different\nemotion-eliciting tasks (Tsai et al., 2002; Tsai, Levenson, & McCoy, 2006; Tsai,\nLevenson, & Carstensen, 2000). Thus, while the physiological aspects of emotional\nresponses appear to be similar across cultures, their accompanying facial\nexpressions are more culturally distinctive.\nAgain, these differences in facial expressions during positive emotional events are\nconsistent with findings from cross-cultural studies of display rules, and stem\nfrom the models of self-description discussed above: In North American contexts\nthat promote an independent self , individuals tend to express their emotions to\ninfluence others. Conversely, in East Asian contexts that promote an\ninterdependent self, individuals tend to control and suppress their emotions to\nadjust to others. People Suppress Their Emotions Across Cultures, but Culture Influences the\nConsequences of Suppression for Psychological Well-Being\nIf the cultural ideal in North American contexts is to express oneself, then\nsuppressing emotions (not showing how one feels) should have negative\nconsequences. This is the assumption underlying hydraulic models of emotion:\nthe idea that emotional suppression and repression impair psychological\nfunctioning (Freud, 1910). Indeed, significant empirical research shows that\nsuppressing emotions can have negative consequences for psychological well-\nbeing in North American contexts (Gross, 1998). However, Soto and colleagues\n(2011) find that the relationship between suppression and psychological well-\nbeing varies by culture. True, with European Americans, emotional suppression is\nassociated with higher levels of depression and lower levels of life satisfaction.\n(Remember, in these individualistic societies, the expression of emotion is a\nfundamental aspect of positive interactions with others.) On the other hand, since\nfor Hong Kong Chinese, emotional suppression is needed to adjust to others (in\nthis interdependent community, suppressing emotions is how to appropriately\ninteract with others), it is simply a part of normal life and therefore not associated\nwith depression or life satisfaction.\nThese findings are consistent with research suggesting that factors related to\nclinical depression vary between European Americans and Asian Americans.\nEuropean Americans diagnosed with depression show dampened or muted\nemotional responses (Bylsma, Morris, & Rottenberg, 2008). For instance, when\nshown sad or amusing film clips, depressed European Americans respond less\nintensely than their nondepressed counterparts.However, other studies have\nshown that depressed East Asian Americans (i.e., people of East Asian descent\nwho live in the United States) demonstrate similar or increased emotional\nresponses compared with their nondepressed counterparts (Chentsova-Dutton et\nal., 2007; Chentsova-Dutton, Tsai, & Gotlib, 2010). In other words, depressed\nEuropean Americans show reduced emotional expressions, but depressed East\nAsian Americans do not\u2014and, in fact, may express more emotion. Thus, muted\nresponses (which resemble suppression) are associated with depression in\nEuropean American contexts, but not in East Asian contexts. People Feel Good During Positive Events, but Culture Influences Whether\nPeople Feel Bad During Positive Events\nSomeone from a collectivist culture is more likely to think about how their own\naccomplishments might impact others. An otherwise positive achievement for\none person could cause another to feel something negative, with mixed emotions\nas the result. [Image: lian xiaoxiao, https://goo.gl/js5jDw, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/jSSrcO]\nWhat about people\u2019s subjective emotional experiences? Do people across\ncultures feel the same emotions in similar situations, despite how they show\nthem? Recent studies indicate that culture affects whether people are likely to\nfeel bad during good events. In North American contexts, people rarely feel bad after good experiences. However, a number of research teams have observed\nthat, compared with people in North American contexts, people in East Asian\ncontexts are more likely to feel bad and good (\u201cmixed\u201d emotions) during positive\nevents (e.g., feeling worried after winning an important competition; Miyamoto,\nUchida, & Ellsworth, 2010). This may be because, compared with North\nAmericans, East Asians engage in more dialectical thinking (i.e., they are more\ntolerant of contradiction and change). Therefore, they accept that positive and\nnegative feelings can occur simultaneously. In addition, whereas North Americans\nvalue maximizing positive states and minimizing negative ones, East Asians value\na greater balance between the two (Sims, Tsai, Wang, Fung, & Zhang, 2013). To\nbetter understand this, think about how you would feel after getting the top\nscore on a test that\u2019s graded on a curve. In North American contexts, such success\nis considered an individual achievement and worth celebrating. But what about\nthe other students who will now receive a lower grade because you \u201craised the\ncurve\u201d with your good grade? In East Asian contexts, not only would students be\nmore thoughtful of the overall group\u2019s success, but they would also be more\ncomfortable acknowledging both the positive (their own success on the test) and\nthe negative (their classmates\u2019 lower grades).\nAgain, these differences can be linked to cultural differences in models of the self.\nAn interdependent model encourages people to think about how their\naccomplishments might affect others (e.g., make others feel bad or jealous). Thus,\nawareness of negative emotions during positive events may discourage people\nfrom expressing their excitement and standing out (as in East Asian contexts).\nSuch emotional suppression helps individuals feel in sync with those around\nthem. An independent model, however, encourages people to express\nthemselves and stand out, so when something good happens, they have no\nreason to feel bad.\nSo far, we have reviewed research that demonstrates cultural similarities in\nphysiological responses and in the ability to suppress emotions. We have also\ndiscussed the cultural differences in facial expressive behavior and the likelihood\nof experiencing negative feelings during positive events. Next, we will explore\nhow culture shapes people\u2019s ideal or desired states.\nPeople Want to Feel Good Across Cultures, but Culture Influences the Specific\nGood States People Want to Feel (Their \u201cIdeal Affect\u201d) Everyone welcomes positive feelings, but cultures vary in the specific types\nof positive affective states (see Figure 2) their people favor. An affective state is\nessentially the type of emotional arousal one feels coupled with its intensity\u2014\nwhich can vary from pleasant to unpleasant (e.g., happy to sad), with high to low\narousal (e.g., energetic to passive). Although people of all cultures experience this\nrange of affective states, they can vary in their preferences for each. For example,\npeople in North American contexts lean toward feeling excited, enthusiastic,\nenergetic, and other \u201chigh arousal positive\u201d states. People in East Asian contexts,\nhowever, generally prefer feeling calm, peaceful, and other \u201clow arousal positive\u201d\nstates (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). These cultural differences have been\nobserved in young children between the ages of 3 and 5, college students, and\nadults between the ages of 60 and 80 (Tsai, Louie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007; Tsai,\nSims, Thomas, & Fung, 2013), and are reflected in widely-distributed cultural\nproducts. For example, wherever you look in American contexts\u2014women\u2019s\nmagazines, children\u2019s storybooks, company websites, and even Facebook profiles\n(Figure 3)\u2014you will find more open, excited smiles and fewer closed, calm smiles\ncompared to Chinese contexts (Chim, Moon, Ang, Tsai, 2013; Tsai, 2007;Tsai,\nLouie, et al., 2007). Figure 2: Adapted from Feldman, Barrett, and Russell (1999); Larsen and Diener\n((1992); Russell (1991); Thayer (1989); Watson and Tellegen (1985)\nAgain, these differences in ideal affect (i.e., the emotional states that people\nbelieve are best) correspond to the independent and interdependent models\ndescribed earlier: Independent selves want to influence others, which requires\naction (doing something), and action involves high arousal states. Conversely,\ninterdependent selves want to adjust to others, which requires suspending action\nand attending to others\u2014both of which involve low arousal states. Thus, the\nmore that individuals and cultures want to influence others (as in North American\ncontexts), the more they value excitement, enthusiasm, and other high arousal\npositive states. And, the more that individuals and cultures want to adjust to others (as in East Asian contexts), the more they value calm, peacefulness, and\nother low arousal positive states (Tsai, Miao, Seppala, Fung, & Yeung, 2007).\nFigure\n3: Sample Hong Kong Chinese (left) and European American (right) Facebook\npages.\nBecause one\u2019s ideal affect functions as a guide for behavior and a way of\nevaluating one\u2019s emotional states, cultural differences in ideal affect can result in\ndifferent emotional lives. For example, several studies have shown that people\nengage in activities (e.g., recreational pastimes, musical styles) consistent with\ntheir cultural ideal affect. That is, people from North American contexts (who\nvalue high arousal affective states) tend to prefer thrilling activities like skydiving,\nwhereas people from East Asian contexts (who value low arousal affective states)\nprefer tranquil activities like lounging on the beach (Tsai, 2007). In addition,\npeople base their conceptions of well-being and happiness on their ideal affect.\nTherefore, European Americans are more likely to define well-being in terms of\nexcitement, whereas Hong Kong Chinese are more likely to define well-being in\nterms of calmness. Indeed, among European Americans, the less people\nexperience high arousal positive states, the more depressed they are. But, among\nHong Kong Chinese\u2014you guessed it!\u2014the less people experience low arousal\npositive states, the more depressed they are (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006).\nPeople Base Their Happiness on Similar Factors Across Cultures, but Culture\nInfluences the Weight Placed on Each Factor Research has shown that self-esteem is more highly correlated with life\nsatisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivist cultures. [Image: Erik,\nhttps://goo.gl/N8zccv, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nWhat factors make people happy or satisfied with their lives? We have seen that\ndiscrepancies between how people actually feel (actual affect) and how they want\nto feel (ideal affect)\u2014as well as people\u2019s suppression of their ideal affect\u2014are\nassociated with depression. But happiness is based on other factors as well. For\ninstance, Kwan, Bond, & Singelis (1997) found that while European Americans and\nHong Kong Chinese subjects both based life satisfaction on how they felt about\nthemselves (self-esteem) and their relationships (relationship harmony), their\nweighting of each factor was different. That is, European Americans based their\nlife satisfaction primarily on self-esteem, whereas Hong Kong Chinese based their\nlife satisfaction equally on self-esteem and relationship harmony. Consistent with\nthese findings, Oishi and colleagues (1999) found in a study of 39 nations that\nself-esteem was more strongly correlated with life satisfaction in more individualistic nations compared to more collectivistic ones. Researchers also\nfound that in individualistic cultures people rated life satisfaction based on their\nemotions more so than on social definitions (or norms). In other words, rather\nthan using social norms as a guideline for what constitutes an ideal life, people in\nindividualistic cultures tend to evaluate their satisfaction according to how they\nfeel emotionally. In collectivistic cultures, however, people\u2019s life satisfaction tends\nto be based on a balance between their emotions and norms (Suh, Diener, Oishi,\n& Triandis, 1998). Similarly, other researchers have recently found that people in\nNorth American contexts are more likely to feel negative when they have poor\nmental and physical health, while people in Japanese contexts don\u2019t have this\nassociation (Curhan et al., 2013).\nAgain, these findings are consistent with cultural differences in models of the self.\nIn North American, independent contexts, feelings about the self matter more,\nwhereas in East Asian, interdependent contexts, feelings about others matter as\nmuch as or even more than feelings about the self.\nWhy Do Cultural Similarities And Differences In Emotion Matter?\nUnderstanding cultural similarities and differences in emotion is obviously critical\nto understanding emotions in general, and the flexibility of emotional processes\nmore specifically. Given the central role that emotions play in our interaction,\nunderstanding cultural similarities and differences is especially critical to\npreventing potentially harmful miscommunications. Although misunderstandings\nare unintentional, they can result in negative consequences\u2014as we\u2019ve seen\nhistorically for ethnic minorities in many cultures. For instance, across a variety of\nNorth American settings, Asian Americans are often characterized as too \u201cquiet\u201d\nand \u201creserved,\u201d and these low arousal states are often misinterpreted as\nexpressions of disengagement or boredom\u2014rather than expressions of the ideal\nof calmness. Consequently, Asian Americans may be perceived as \u201ccold,\u201d \u201cstoic,\u201d\nand \u201cunfriendly,\u201d fostering stereotypes of Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual\nforeigners\u201d (Cheryan & Monin, 2005). Indeed, this may be one reason Asian\nAmericans are often overlooked for top leadership positions (Hyun, 2005).\nIn addition to averting cultural miscommunications, recognizing cultural\nsimilarities and differences in emotion may provide insights into other paths to\npsychological health and well-being. For instance, findings from a recent series of studies suggest that calm states are easier to elicit than excited states, suggesting\nthat one way of increasing happiness in cultures that value excitement may be to\nincrease the value placed on calm states (Chim, Tsai, Hogan, & Fung, 2013).\nCurrent Directions In Culture And Emotion Research\nWhat About Other Cultures?\nIn this brief review, we\u2019ve focused primarily on comparisons between North\nAmerican and East Asian contexts because most of the research in cultural\npsychology has focused on these comparisons. However, there are obviously a\nmultitude of other cultural contexts in which emotional differences likely exist.\nFor example, although Western contexts are similar in many ways, specific\nWestern contexts (e.g., American vs. German) also differ from each other in\nsubstantive ways related to emotion (Koopmann-Holm & Matsumoto, 2011).\nThus, future research examining other cultural contexts is needed. Such studies\nmay also reveal additional, uninvestigated dimensions or models that have broad\nimplications for emotion. In addition, because more and more people are being\nraised within multiple cultural contexts (e.g., for many Chinese Americans, a\nChinese immigrant culture at home and mainstream American culture at school),\nmore research is needed to examine how people negotiate and integrate these\ndifferent cultures in their emotional lives (for examples, see De Leersnyder,\nMesquita, & Kim, 2011; Perunovic, Heller, & Rafaeli, 2007).\nHow Are Cultural Differences in Beliefs About Emotion Transmitted? Children's story books offer one interesting and effective way to study how early\ninfluences can impact a person's ideal affect. [Image: Vernon Barford School\nLibrary, https://goo.gl/fghcae, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nAccording to Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952), cultural ideas are reflected in and\nreinforced by practices, institutions, and products. As an example of this\nphenomenon\u2014and illustrating the point regarding cultural differences in ideal\naffect\u2014bestselling children\u2019s storybooks in the United States often contain more\nexciting and less calm content (smiles and activities) than do bestselling children\u2019s\nstorybooks in Taiwan (Tsai, Louie, et al., 2007). To investigate this further, the researchers randomly assigned European American, Asian American, and\nTaiwanese Chinese preschoolers to be read either stories with exciting content or\nstories with calm content. Across all of these cultures, the kids who were read\nstories with exciting content were afterward more likely to value excited states,\nwhereas those who were read stories with calm content were more likely to value\ncalm states. As a test, after hearing the stories, the kids were shown a list of toys\nand asked to select their favorites. Those who heard the exciting stories wanted\nto play with more arousing toys (like a drum that beats loud and fast), whereas\nthose who heard the calm stories wanted to play with less arousing toys (like a\ndrum that beats quiet and slow). These findings suggest that regardless of ethnic\nbackground, direct exposure to storybook content alters children\u2019s ideal affect.\nMore studies are needed to assess whether a similar process occurs when\nchildren and adults are chronically exposed to various types of cultural products.\nAs well, future studies should examine other ways cultural ideas regarding\nemotion are transmitted (e.g., via interactions with parents and teachers).\nCould These Cultural Differences Be Due to Temperament?\nAn alternative explanation for cultural differences in emotion is that they are due\nto temperamental factors\u2014that is, biological predispositions to respond in certain\nways. (Might European Americans just be more emotional than East Asians\nbecause of genetics?) Indeed, most models of emotion acknowledge that both\nculture andtemperament play roles in emotional life, yet few if any models\nindicate how. Nevertheless, most researchers believe that despite genetic\ndifferences in founder populations (i.e., the migrants from a population who leave\nto create their own societies), culture has a greater impact on emotions. For\ninstance, one theoretical framework, Affect Valuation Theory, proposes that\ncultural factors shape how people want to feel (\u201cideal affect\u201d) more than how\nthey actually feel (\u201cactual affect\u201d); conversely, temperamental factors influence\nhow people actually feel more than how they want to feel (Tsai, 2007) (see Figure\n4).\nTo test this hypothesis, European American, Asian American, and Hong Kong\nChinese participants completed measures of temperament (i.e., stable\ndispositions, such as neuroticism or extraversion), actual affect (i.e., how people\nactually feel in given situations), ideal affect (i.e., how people would like to feel in\ngiven situations), and influential cultural values (i.e., personal beliefs transmitted through culture). When researchers analyzed the participants\u2019 responses, they\nfound that differences in ideal affect between cultures were associated more with\ncultural factors than with temperamental factors (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006).\nHowever, when researchers examined actual affect, they found this to be\nreversed: actual affect was more strongly associated with temperamental factors\nthan cultural factors. Not all of the studies described above have ruled out a\ntemperamental explanation, though, and more studies are needed to rule out the\npossibility that the observed group differences are due to genetic factors instead\nof, or in addition to, cultural factors. Moreover, future studies should examine\nwhether the links between temperament and emotions might vary across\ncultures, and how cultural and temperamental factors work together to shape\nemotion.\nFigure 4: Affect valuation theory. Thicker lines indicate stronger predicted\nrelationships.\nSummary\nBased on studies comparing North American and East Asian contexts, there is\nclear evidence for cultural similarities and differences in emotions, and most of\nthe differences can be traced to different cultural models of the self.\nConsider your own concept of self for a moment. What kinds of pastimes do you\nprefer\u2014activities that make you excited, or ones that make you calm? What kinds of feelings do you strive for? What is your ideal affect? Because emotions seem\nand feel so instinctual to us, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the way we experience them\nand the ones we desire are anything other than biologically programmed into us.\nHowever, as current research has shown (and as future research will continue to\nexplore), there are myriad ways in which culture, both consciously and\nunconsciously, shapes people\u2019s emotional lives.\nOutside Resources\nAudio Interview: The Really Big Questions \u201cWhat Are Emotions?\u201d Interview with\nPaul Ekman, Martha Nussbaum, Dominique Moisi, and William Reddy\nhttp://www.trbq.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layou\nt=blog&id=16&Itemid=43\nBook: Ed Diener and Robert Biswas-Diener: Happiness: Unlocking the Mysteries of\nPsychological Wealth\nBook: Eric Weiner: The Geography of Bliss\nBook: Eva Hoffmann: Lost in Translation: Life in a New Language\nBook: Hazel Markus: Clash: 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who We Are\nVideo: Social Psychology Alive\nhttp://psychology.stanford.edu/~tsailab/PDF/socpsychalive.wmv\nVideo: The Really Big Questions \u201cCulture and Emotion,\u201d Dr. Jeanne Tsai\nVideo: Tsai\u2019s description of cultural differences in emotion\nWeb: Acculturation and Culture Collaborative at Leuven\nhttp://ppw.kuleuven.be/home/english/research/cscp/acc-research\nWeb: Culture and Cognition at the University of Michigan\nhttp://culturecognition.isr.umich.edu/\nWeb: Experts In Emotion Series, Dr. June Gruber, Department of Psychology, Yale\nUniversity\nhttp://www.yalepeplab.com/teaching/psych131_summer2013/expertseries.\nphp\nWeb: Georgetown Culture and Emotion Lab\nhttp://georgetownculturelab.wordpress.com/ Web: Paul Ekman\u2019s website\nhttp://www.paulekman.com\nWeb: Penn State Culture, Health, and Emotion Lab\nhttp://www.personal.psu.edu/users/m/r/mrm280/sotosite/\nWeb: Stanford Culture and Emotion Lab\nhttp://www-psych.stanford.edu/~tsailab/index.htm\nWeb: Wesleyan Culture and Emotion Lab\nhttp://culture-and-emotion.research.wesleyan.edu/\nVocabulary\nAffect\nFeelings that can be described in terms of two dimensions, the dimensions of\narousal and valence (Figure 2). For example, high arousal positive states refer\nto excitement, elation, and enthusiasm. Low arousal positive states refer to\ncalm, peacefulness, and relaxation. Whereas \u201cactual affect\u201d refers to the\nstates that people actually feel, \u201cideal affect\u201d refers to the states that people\nideally want to feel.\nCulture\nShared, socially transmitted ideas (e.g., values, beliefs, attitudes) that are\nreflected in and reinforced by institutions, products, and rituals.\nEmotions\nChanges in subjective experience, physiological responding, and behavior in\nresponse to a meaningful event. Emotions tend to occur on the order of\nseconds (in contract to moods which may last for days).\nFeelings\nA general term used to describe a wide range of states that include\nemotions, moods, traits and that typically involve changes in subjective\nexperience, physiological responding, and behavior in response to a\nmeaningful event. Emotions typically occur on the order of seconds, whereas\nmoods may last for days, and traits are tendencies to respond a certain way\nacross various situations. Independent self\nA model or view of the self as distinct from others and as stable across\ndifferent situations. The goal of the independent self is to express and assert\nthe self, and to influence others. This model of self is prevalent in many\nindividualistic, Western contexts (e.g., the United States, Australia, Western\nEurope).\nInterdependent self\nA model or view of the self as connected to others and as changing in\nresponse to different situations. The goal of the interdependent self is to\nsuppress personal preferences and desires, and to adjust to others. This\nmodel of self is prevalent in many collectivistic, East Asian contexts (e.g.,\nChina, Japan, Korea).\nSocial constructivism\nSocial constructivism proposes that knowledge is first created and learned\nwithin a social context and is then adopted by individuals.\nUniversalism\nUniversalism proposes that there are single objective standards,\nindependent of culture, in basic domains such as learning, reasoning, and\nemotion that are a part of all human experience.\nReferences\nBylsma, L., Morris, B., & Rottenberg, J.

These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure).\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid,\ncognitive and aesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self- actualization. Others include another tier at the top of the pyramid for self-\ntranscendence.\nAt the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for\nsurvival. These are followed by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be\nloved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need to have self-worth and\nconfidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need that\nessentially equates to achieving one\u2019s full potential, and it can only be realized\nwhen needs lower on the pyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic\ntheorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic emphasis on positive aspects\nof human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and\nthat only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state\n(Francis & Kritsonis, 2006; Maslow, 1943).\nAccording to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before\naddressing those needs that occur higher in the pyramid. So, for example, if\nsomeone is struggling to find enough food to meet his nutritional requirements, it\nis quite unlikely that he would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about\nwhether others viewed him as a good person or not. Instead, all of his energies\nwould be geared toward finding something to eat. However, it should be pointed\nout that Maslow\u2019s theory has been criticized for its subjective nature and its\ninability to account for phenomena that occur in the real world (Leonard, 1982).\nOther research has more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a\nself-transcendence level above self-actualization\u2014to represent striving for\nmeaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera, 2006). For\nexample, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political\nstatement or in an attempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K.\nGandhi, a world-renowned advocate for independence through nonviolent\nprotest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particular\nsituation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger\ndisplaying higher-level motives beyond their own needs. Check out this interactive exercise that illustrates some of the important concepts\nin Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs.\n\u00a9 Jun 25, 2018 OpenStax.

As the US economy continued to struggle, a nationwide survey of\n638 public school teachers in grades K\u20138 conducted for Share Our Strength, a\nnonprofit organization working to end childhood hunger, found alarming\nevidence of children coming to school with empty stomachs. More than two-\nthirds of the teachers said they had students who \u201cregularly come to school too\nhungry to learn\u2014some having had no dinner the night before,\u201d according to the\nnews article. More than 60 percent of the teachers said the problem had\nworsened during the past year, and more than 40 percent called it a \u201cserious\u201d\nproblem. Many of the teachers said they spent their own money to buy food for\ntheir students. As an elementary school teacher explained, \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of\nstudents come to school\u2014not just one or two\u2014who put their heads down and\ncry because they haven\u2019t eaten since lunch yesterday\u201d (United Press\nInternational, 2011)\nThe United States is one of the richest nations in the world. Many Americans live\nin luxury or at least are comfortably well-off. Yet, as this poignant news story of\nchildhood hunger reminds us, many Americans also live in poverty or near\npoverty. This chapter explains why poverty exists and why the US poverty rate is\nso high, and it discusses the devastating consequences of poverty for the millions\nof Americans who live in or near poverty. It also examines poverty in the poorest\nnations of the world and outlines efforts for reducing poverty in the United States\nand these nations.\nAlthough this chapter will paint a disturbing picture of poverty, there is still cause\nfor hope. As we shall see, the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d that began in the United States\nduring the 1960s dramatically reduced poverty. Inspired by books with titles\nlike The Other America: Poverty in the United States (Harrington, 1962) and In the\nMidst of Plenty: The Poor in America (Bagdikian, 1964) that described the plight of\nthe poor in heartbreaking detail, the federal government established various\nfunding programs and other policies that greatly lowered the poverty rate in less\nthan a decade (Schwartz, 1984). Since the 1960s and 1970s, however, the United\nStates has cut back on these programs, and the poor are no longer on the national\nagenda. Other wealthy democracies provide much more funding and many more services for their poor than does the United States, and their poverty rates are\nmuch lower than ours.\nStill, the history of the war on poverty and the experience of these other nations\nboth demonstrate that US poverty can be reduced with appropriate policies and\nprograms. If the United States were to go back to the future by remembering its\nearlier war on poverty and by learning from other Western democracies, it could\nagain lower poverty and help millions of Americans lead better, healthier, and\nmore productive lives.\nBut why should we care about poverty in the first place? As this chapter discusses,\nmany politicians and much of the public blame the poor for being poor, and they\noppose increasing federal spending to help the poor and even want to reduce\nsuch spending. As poverty expert Mark R. Rank (Rank, 2011) summarizes this way\nof thinking, \u201cAll too often we view poverty as someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d Rank says\nthis unsympathetic view is shortsighted because, as he puts it, \u201cpoverty affects us\nall\u201d (Rank, 2011). This is true, he explains, for at least two reasons.\nFirst, the United States spends much more money than it needs to because of the\nconsequences of poverty. Poor people experience worse health, family problems,\nhigher crime rates, and many other problems, all of which our nation spends\nbillions of dollars annually to address. In fact, childhood poverty has been\nestimated to cost the US economy an estimated $500 billion annually because of\nthe problems it leads to, including unemployment, low-paid employment, higher\ncrime rates, and physical and mental health problems (Eckholm, 2007). If the US\npoverty rate were no higher than that of other democracies, billions of tax dollars\nand other resources would be saved.\nSecond, the majority of Americans can actually expect to be poor or near poor at\nsome point in their lives, with about 75 percent of Americans in the 20\u201375 age\nrange living in poverty or near poverty for at least one year in their lives. As Rank\n(Rank, 2011) observes, most Americans \u201cwill find ourselves below the poverty line\nand using a social safety net program at some point.\u201d Because poverty costs the\nUnited States so much money and because so many people experience poverty,\nsays Rank, everyone should want the United States to do everything possible to\nreduce poverty.\nSociologist John Iceland (Iceland, 2006) adds two additional reasons for why\neveryone should care about poverty and want it reduced. First, a high rate of poverty impairs our nation\u2019s economic progress: When a large number of people\ncannot afford to purchase goods and services, economic growth is more difficult\nto achieve. Second, poverty produces crime and other social problems that affect\npeople across the socioeconomic ladder. Reductions in poverty would help not\nonly the poor but also people who are not poor.\nWe begin our examination of poverty by discussing how poverty is measured and\nhow much poverty exists.\nReferences\nBagdikian, B.

The Measurement and Extent of Poverty\nLearning Objectives:\nUnderstand how official poverty in the United States is measured.\nDescribe problems in the measurement of official poverty.\nDescribe the extent of official poverty.\nWhen US officials became concerned about poverty during the 1960s, they\nquickly realized they needed to find out how much poverty we had. To do so, a\nmeasure of official poverty, or a poverty line, was needed. A government\neconomist, Mollie Orshanky, first calculated this line in 1963 by multiplying the\ncost of a very minimal diet by three, as a 1955 government study had determined\nthat the typical American family spent one-third of its income on food. Thus a\nfamily whose cash income is lower than three times the cost of a very minimal\ndiet is considered officially poor. This way of calculating the official poverty line\nhas not changed since 1963. It is thus out of date for many reasons. For example,\nmany expenses, such as heat and electricity, child care, transportation, and health\ncare, now occupy a greater percentage of the typical family\u2019s budget than was\ntrue in 1963. In addition, this official measure ignores a family\u2019s noncash income\nfrom benefits such as food stamps and tax credits. As a national measure, the\npoverty line also fails to take into account regional differences in the cost of living.\nAll these problems make the official measurement of poverty highly suspect. As\none poverty expert observes, \u201cThe official measure no longer corresponds to\nreality. It doesn\u2019t get either side of the equation right\u2014how much the poor have\nor how much they need. No one really trusts the data\u201d (DeParle, et. al., 2011).\nWe\u2019ll return to this issue shortly. The measure of official poverty began in 1963 and stipulates that a family whose\nincome is lower than three times the cost of a minimal diet is considered officially\npoor. This measure has not changed since 1963 even though family expenses\nhave risen greatly in many areas.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe poverty line is adjusted annually for inflation and takes into account the\nnumber of people in a family: The larger the family size, the higher the poverty\nline. In 2010, the poverty line for a nonfarm family of four (two adults, two\nchildren) was $22,213. A four-person family earning even one more dollar than\n$22,213 in 2010 was not officially poor, even though its \u201cextra\u201d income hardly\nlifted it out of dire economic straits. Poverty experts have calculated a no-frills\nbudget that enables a family to meet its basic needs in food, clothing, shelter, and\nso forth; this budget is about twice the poverty line. Families with incomes\nbetween the poverty line and twice the poverty line (or twice poverty) are barely\nmaking ends meet, but they are not considered officially poor. When we talk here\nabout the poverty level, then, keep in mind that we are talking only\nabout official poverty and that there are many families and individuals living in\nnear poverty who have trouble meeting their basic needs, especially when they\nface unusually high medical expenses, motor vehicle expenses, or the like. For this\nreason, many analysts think families need incomes twice as high as the federal poverty level just to get by (Wright, et. al., 2011). They thus use twice-\npoverty data (i.e., family incomes below twice the poverty line) to provide a more\naccurate understanding of how many Americans face serious financial difficulties,\neven if they are not living in official poverty.\nThe Extent of Poverty\nWith this caveat in mind, how many Americans are poor? The US Census Bureau\ngives us some answers that use the traditional, official measure of poverty\ndeveloped in 1963. In 2010, 15.1 percent of the US population, or 46.2 million\nAmericans, lived in official poverty (DeNavas-Walt, et. al., 2011). This percentage\nrepresented a decline from the early 1990s but was higher than 2000 and even\nhigher than the rate in the late 1960s (see Figure 2.1 \u201cUS Poverty, 1959\u20132010\u201d). If\nwe were winning the war on poverty in the 1960s (notice the sharp drop in the\n1960s in Figure 2.1 \u201cUS Poverty, 1959\u20132010\u201d), since then poverty has fought us to\na standstill.\nFigure 2.1 US Poverty, 1959\u20132010 Source: Data from US Census Bureau. (2011). Historical poverty tables: People.\nRetrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html.\nAnother way of understanding the extent of poverty is to consider episodic\npoverty, defined by the Census Bureau as being poor for at least two consecutive\nmonths in some time period. From 2004 to 2007, the last years for which data are\navailable, almost one-third of the US public, equal to about 95 million people,\nwere poor for at least two consecutive months, although only 2.2 percent were\npoor for all three years (DeNavas-Walt, et al., 2010). As these figures indicate,\npeople go into and out of poverty, but even those who go out of it do not usually\nmove very far from it. And as we have seen, the majority of Americans can expect\nto experience poverty or near poverty at some point in their lives.\nThe problems in the official poverty measure that were noted earlier have led the\nCensus Bureau to develop a Supplemental Poverty Measure. This measure takes\ninto account the many family expenses in addition to food; it also takes into\naccount geographic differences in the cost of living, taxes paid and tax credits\nreceived, and the provision of food stamps, Medicaid, and certain other kinds of\ngovernment aid. This new measure yields an estimate of poverty that is higher\nthan the rather simplistic official poverty measure that, as noted earlier, is based\nsolely on the size of a family and the cost of food and the amount of a family\u2019s\ncash income. According to this new measure, the 2010 poverty rate was 16.0\npercent, equal to 49.1 million Americans (Short, 2011). Because the official\npoverty measure identified 46.2 million people as poor, the new, more accurate\nmeasure increased the number of poor people in the United States by almost 3\nmillion. Without the help of Social Security, food stamps, and other federal\nprograms, at least 25 million additional people would be classified as poor\n(Sherman, 2011). These programs thus are essential in keeping many people\nabove the poverty level, even if they still have trouble making ends meet and\neven though the poverty rate remains unacceptably high.\nA final figure is worth noting. Recall that many poverty experts think that twice-\npoverty data\u2014the percentage and number of people living in families with\nincomes below twice the official poverty level\u2014are a better gauge than the\nofficial poverty level of the actual extent of poverty, broadly defined, in the\nUnited States. Using the twice-poverty threshold, about one-third of the US\npopulation, or more than 100 million Americans, live in poverty or near poverty\n(Pereyra, 2011). Those in near poverty are just one crisis\u2014losing a job or sustaining a serious illness or injury\u2014away from poverty. Twice-poverty data\npaint a very discouraging picture.\nKey Takeaways:\nThe official poverty rate is based on the size of a family and a minimal food\nbudget; this measure underestimates the true extent of poverty.\nThe official poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent, equal to more than 46 million\nAmericans.\nAbout one-third of the US population, or more than 100 million Americans, have\nincomes no higher than twice the poverty line.\nReferences\nDeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B.

Who the Poor Are: Social Patterns of Poverty\nLearning Objectives:\nDescribe racial/ethnic differences in the poverty rate.\nDiscuss how family structure is related to the poverty rate.\nExplain what poverty and labor force participation data imply about the belief\nthat many poor people lack the motivation to work.\nWho are the poor? Although the official poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent,\nthis rate differs by the important sociodemographic characteristics of\nrace/ethnicity, gender, and age, and it also differs by region of the nation and by\nfamily structure. The poverty rate differences based on these variables are critical\nto understanding the nature and social patterning of poverty in the United States.\nWe look at each of these variables in turn with 2010 census data (DeNavas-Walt,\net, al., 2011).\nRace/Ethnicity\nHere is a quick quiz; please circle the correct answer.\nMost poor people in the United States are:\n1. Black/African American\n2. Latino\n3. Native American\n4. Asian\n5. White\nWhat did you circle? If you are like the majority of people who answer a similar\nquestion in public opinion surveys, you would have circled a. Black/African\nAmerican. When Americans think about poor people, they tend to picture African\nAmericans (White, 2007). This popular image is thought to reduce the public\u2019s\nsympathy for poor people and to lead them to oppose increased government aid\nfor the poor. The public\u2019s views on these matters are, in turn, thought to play a\nkey role in government poverty policy. It is thus essential for the public to have an\naccurate understanding of the racial/ethnic patterning of poverty. The most typical poor people in the United States are non-Latino whites. These\nindividuals comprise 42.4 percent of all poor Americans.\nFranco Folini \u2013 Homeless guys with dogs \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nUnfortunately, the public\u2019s racial image of poor people is mistaken, as census data\nreveal that the most typical poor person is white (non-Latino). To be more precise,\n42.4 percent of poor people are white (non-Latino), 28.7 percent are Latino, 23.1\npercent are black, and 3.7 percent are Asian (see Figure 2.2 \u201cRacial and Ethnic\nComposition of the Poor, 2010 (Percentage of Poor Persons Who Belong to Each\nGroup)\u201d). As these figures show, non-Latino whites certainly comprise the\ngreatest number of the American poor. Turning these percentages into numbers,\nthey account for 19.6 million of the 46.2 million poor Americans.\nIt is also true, though, that race and ethnicity affect the chances of being poor.\nWhile only 9.9 percent of non-Latino whites are poor, 27.4 percent of African\nAmericans, 12.1 percent of Asians, and 26.6 percent of Latinos (who may be of\nany race) are poor (see Figure 2.3 \u201cRace, Ethnicity, and Poverty, 2010 (Percentage\nof Each Group That Is Poor)\u201d). Thus African Americans and Latinos are almost\nthree times as likely as non-Latino whites to be poor. (Because there are so many\nnon-Latino whites in the United States, the greatest number of poor people are\nnon-Latino white, even if the percentage of whites who are poor is relatively low.) The higher poverty rates of people of color are so striking and important that they\nhave been termed the \u201ccolors of poverty\u201d (Lin & Harris, 2008).\nFigure 2.2 Racial and Ethnic Composition of the Poor, 2010 (Percentage of Poor\nPersons Who Belong to Each Group)\nSource: Data from DeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B. D., & Smith, J. C. (2011). Income,\npoverty, and health insurance coverage in the United States: 2010 (Current\nPopulation Report P60-239). Washington, DC: US Census Bureau.\nFigure 2.3 Race, Ethnicity, and Poverty, 2010 (Percentage of Each Group That Is\nPoor) Source: Data from DeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B. D., & Smith, J. C. (2011).

Washington, DC: US Census Bureau.\nGender\nOne thing that many women know all too well is that women are more likely than\nmen to be poor. According to the census, 16.2 percent of all females live in\npoverty, compared to only 14.0 percent of all males. These figures translate to a\nlarge gender gap in the actual number of poor people, as 25.2 million women and\ngirls live in poverty, compared to only 21.0 million men and boys, for a difference\nof 4.2 million people. The high rate of female poverty is called the feminization of\npoverty (Iceland, 2006). We will see additional evidence of this pattern when we\nlook at the section on family structure that follows.\nAge\nTurning to age, at any one time 22 percent of children under age 18 are poor\n(amounting to 16.4 million children), a figure that rises to about 39 percent of\nAfrican American children and 35 percent of Latino children. About 37 percent of\nall children live in poverty for at least one year before turning 18 (Ratcliffe &\nMcKernan, 2010). The poverty rate for US children is the highest of all wealthy\ndemocracies and in fact is 1.5 to 9 times greater than the corresponding rates in\nCanada and Western Europe (Mishel, et. al., 2009). As high as the US childhood poverty rate is, twice-poverty data again paint an even more discouraging picture.\nChildren living in families with incomes below twice the official poverty level are\ncalled low-income children, and their families are called low-income families.\nAlmost 44 percent of American children, or some 32.5 million kids, live in such\nfamilies (Addy & Wright, 2012). Almost two-thirds of African American children\nand Latino children live in low-income families.\nThe poverty rate for US children is the highest in the Western world.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nAt the other end of the age distribution, 9 percent of people aged 65 or older are\npoor (amounting to about 3.5 million seniors). Turning around these age figures,\nalmost 36 percent of all poor people in the United States are children, and almost\n8 percent of the poor are 65 or older. Thus more than 43.4 percent of Americans\nliving in poverty are children or the elderly.\nRegion Poverty rates differ around the country. Some states have higher poverty rates\nthan other states, and some counties within a state are poorer than other\ncounties within that state. A basic way of understanding geographical differences\nin poverty is to examine the poverty rates of the four major regions of the nation.\nWhen we do this, the South is the poorest region, with a poverty rate of 16.9\npercent. The West is next (15.3 percent), followed by the Midwest (13.9 percent)\nand then the Northeast (12.8 percent). The South\u2019s high poverty rate is thought to\nbe an important reason for the high rate of illnesses and other health problems it\nexperiences compared to the other regions (Ramshaw, 2011).\nFamily Structure\nThere are many types of family structures, including a married couple living with\ntheir children; an unmarried couple living with one or more children; a household\nwith children headed by only one parent, usually a woman; a household with two\nadults and no children; and a household with only one adult living alone. Across\nthe nation, poverty rates differ from one type of family structure to another.\nNot surprisingly, poverty rates are higher in families with one adult than in those\nwith two adults (because they often are bringing in two incomes), and, in one-\nadult families, they are higher in families headed by a woman than in those\nheaded by a man (because women generally have lower incomes than men). Of\nall families headed by just a woman, 31.6 percent live in poverty, compared to\nonly 15.8 percent of families headed by just a man. In contrast, only 6.2 percent\nof families headed by a married couple live in poverty (see Figure 2.4 \u201cFamily\nStructure and Poverty Rate (Percentage of Each Type of Structure That Lives in\nPoverty)\u201d). The figure for female-headed families provides additional evidence for\nthe feminization of poverty concept introduced earlier. Figure 2.4 Family Structure and Poverty Rate (Percentage of Each Type of\nStructure That Lives in Poverty)\nSource: Data from DeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B. D., & Smith, J. C. (2011). Income,\npoverty, and health insurance coverage in the United States: 2010(Current\nPopulation Report P60-239). Washington, DC: US Census Bureau.\nWe saw earlier that 22 percent of American children are poor. This figure varies\naccording to the type of family structure in which the children live. Whereas only\n11.6 percent of children residing with married parents live in poverty, 46.9\npercent of those living with only their mother live in poverty. This latter figure\nrises to 53.3 percent for African American children and 57.0 percent for Latino\nchildren (US Census Bureau, 2012). Yet regardless of their race or ethnicity,\nchildren living just with their mothers are at particularly great risk of living in\npoverty.\nLabor Force Status\nAs this chapter discusses later, many Americans think the poor are lazy and lack\nthe motivation to work and, as is often said, \u201creally could work if they wanted to.\u201d\nHowever, government data on the poor show that most poor people are, in fact,\neither working, unemployed but looking for work, or unable to work because of\ntheir age or health. Table 2.1 \u201cPoverty and Labor Force Participation, 2010\u201d shows\nthe relevant data. We discuss these numbers in some detail because of their\nimportance, so please follow along carefully. Table 2.1 Poverty and Labor Force Participation, 2010\nTotal number of poor people 46,180,000\nNumber of poor people under age 18 16,401,000\nNumber of poor people ages 65 and older 3,521,000\nNumber of poor people ages 18\u201364 26,258,000\nNumber of poor people ages 18\u201364 who were:\nWorking full- or part-time 9,053,000\nUnemployed but looking for work 3,616,000\nDisabled 4,247,000\nIn the armed forces 77,000\nAble-bodied but not in the labor force 9,254,000\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2010). Current population survey (CPS)\ntable creator. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/cps/data/cpstablecreator.html.\nLet\u2019s examine this table to see the story it tells. Of the roughly 46.2 million poor\npeople, almost 20 million were either under age 18 or at least 65. Because of their\nages, we would not expect them to be working. Of the remaining 26.3 million\npoor adults ages 18\u201364, almost 17 million, or about two-thirds, fell into one of\nthese categories: (a) they worked full-time or part-time, (b) they were\nunemployed but looking for work during a year of very high unemployment due\nto the nation\u2019s faltering economy, (c) they did not work because of a disability, or\n(d) they were in the armed forces. Subtracting all these adults leaves about 9.3\nmillion able-bodied people ages 18\u201364. Doing some arithmetic, we thus see that almost 37 million of the 46.2 million\npoor people we started with, or 80 percent, with were either working or\nunemployed but looking for work, too young or too old to work, disabled, or in\nthe armed forces. It would thus be inaccurate to describe the vast majority of the\npoor as lazy and lacking the motivation to work.\nWhat about the 9.3 million able-bodied poor people who are ages 18\u201364 but not\nin the labor force, who compose only 20 percent of the poor to begin with? Most\nof them were either taking care of small children or elderly parents or other\nrelatives, retired for health reasons, or in school (US Census Bureau, 2012); some\nalso left the labor force out of frustration and did not look for work (and thus\nwere not counted officially as unemployed). Taking all these numbers and\ncategories into account, it turns out that the percentage of poor people who\n\u201creally could work if they wanted to\u201d is rather miniscule, and the common belief\nthat they \u201creally could work if they wanted to\u201d is nothing more than a myth.\nPeople Making a Difference\nFeeding \u201cMotel Kids\u201d Near Disneyland\nJust blocks from Disneyland in Anaheim, California, more than 1,000 families live\nin cheap motels frequently used by drug dealers and prostitutes. Because they\ncannot afford the deposit for an apartment, the motels are their only alternative\nto homelessness. As Bruno Serato, a local Italian restaurant owner, observed,\n\u201cSome people are stuck, they have no money. They need to live in that room.\nThey\u2019ve lost everything they have. They have no other choice. No choice.\u201d\nSerato learned about these families back in 2005, when he saw a boy at the local\nBoys & Girls Club eating a bag of potato chips as his only food for dinner. He was\ntold that the boy lived with his family in a motel and that the Boys & Girls Club\nhad a \u201cmotel kids\u201d program that drove children in vans after school to their\nmotels. Although the children got free breakfast and lunch at school, they often\nwent hungry at night. Serato soon began serving pasta dinners to some seventy\nchildren at the club every evening, a number that had grown by spring 2011 to\nalmost three hundred children nightly. Serato also pays to have the children\ntransported to the club for their dinners, and he estimates that the food and\ntransportation cost him about $2,000 monthly. His program had served more\nthan 300,000 pasta dinners to motel kids by 2011. Two of the children who eat Serato\u2019s pasta are Carlos and Anthony Gomez, 12,\nwho live in a motel room with the other members of their family. Their father was\ngrateful for the pasta: \u201cI no longer worry as much, about them [coming home]\nand there being no food. I know that they eat over there at [the] Boys & Girls\nClub.\u201d\nBruno Serato is merely happy to be helping out. \u201cThey\u2019re customers,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cMy favorite customers\u201d (Toner, 2011).\nFor more information about Bruno Serato\u2019s efforts, visit his charity site\nat www.thecaterinasclub.org.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlthough people of color have higher poverty rates than non-Latino whites, the\nmost typical poor person in the United States is non-Latino white.\nThe US childhood poverty rate is the highest of all Western democracies.\nLabor force participation data indicate that the belief that poor people lack\nmotivation to work is in fact a myth.\nReferences\nAddy, S., & Wright, V.

Explaining Poverty\nLearning Objectives:\nDescribe the assumptions of the functionalist and conflict views of stratification\nand of poverty.\nExplain the focus of symbolic interactionist work on poverty.\nUnderstand the difference between the individualist and structural explanations\nof poverty.\nWhy does poverty exist, and why and how do poor people end up being poor?\nThe sociological perspectives introduced in Chapter 1 \u201cUnderstanding Social\nProblems\u201d provide some possible answers to these questions through their\nattempt to explain why American society is stratified\u2014that is, why it has a range\nof wealth ranging from the extremely wealthy to the extremely poor. We review\nwhat these perspectives say generally about social stratification (rankings of\npeople based on wealth and other resources a society values) before turning to\nexplanations focusing specifically on poverty.\nIn general, the functionalist perspective and conflict perspective both try to\nexplain why social stratification exists and endures, while the symbolic\ninteractionist perspective discusses the differences that stratification produces for\neveryday interaction. Table 2.2 \u201cTheory Snapshot\u201d summarizes these three\napproaches.\nTable 2.2 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nFunctionalism\nStratification is necessary to induce people with special Theoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nintelligence, knowledge, and skills to enter the most important\noccupations. For this reason, stratification is necessary and\ninevitable.\nStratification results from lack of opportunity and from\nConflict theory discrimination and prejudice against the poor, women, and\npeople of color. It is neither necessary nor inevitable.\nSymbolic Stratification affects people\u2019s beliefs, lifestyles, daily\ninteractionism interaction, and conceptions of themselves.\nThe Functionalist View\nAs discussed in Chapter 1 \u201cUnderstanding Social Problems\u201d, functionalist theory\nassumes that society\u2019s structures and processes exist because they serve\nimportant functions for society\u2019s stability and continuity. In line with this view,\nfunctionalist theorists in sociology assume that stratification exists because it also\nserves important functions for society. This explanation was developed more than\nsixty years ago by Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore (Davis & Moore, 1945) in the\nform of several logical assumptions that imply stratification is both necessary and\ninevitable. When applied to American society, their assumptions would be as\nfollows:\n1. Some jobs are more important than other jobs. For example, the job of a\nbrain surgeon is more important than the job of shoe shining.\n2. Some jobs require more skills and knowledge than other jobs. To stay with\nour example, it takes more skills and knowledge to perform brain surgery than\nto shine shoes.\n3. Relatively few people have the ability to acquire the skills and knowledge\nthat are needed to do these important, highly skilled jobs. Most of us would\nbe able to do a decent job of shining shoes, but very few of us would be able to\nbecome brain surgeons. 4. To encourage the people with the skills and knowledge to do the important,\nhighly skilled jobs, society must promise them higher incomes or other\nrewards. If this is true, some people automatically end up higher in society\u2019s\nranking system than others, and stratification is thus necessary and inevitable.\nTo illustrate their assumptions, say we have a society where shining shoes and\ndoing brain surgery both give us incomes of $150,000 per year. (This example\nis very hypothetical, but please keep reading.) If you decide to shine shoes, you\ncan begin making this money at age 16, but if you decide to become a brain\nsurgeon, you will not start making this same amount until about age 35, as you\nmust first go to college and medical school and then acquire several more\nyears of medical training. While you have spent nineteen additional years\nbeyond age 16 getting this education and training and taking out tens of\nthousands of dollars in student loans, you could have spent those years shining\nshoes and making $150,000 a year, or $2.85 million overall. Which job would\nyou choose?\nFunctional theory argues that the promise of very high incomes is necessary to\nencourage talented people to pursue important careers such as surgery. If\nphysicians and shoe shiners made the same high income, would enough people\ndecide to become physicians?\nPublic Domain Images \u2013 CC0 public domain. As this example suggests, many people might not choose to become brain\nsurgeons unless considerable financial and other rewards awaited them. By\nextension, we might not have enough people filling society\u2019s important jobs\nunless they know they will be similarly rewarded. If this is true, we must have\nstratification. And if we must have stratification, then that means some people\nwill have much less money than other people. If stratification is inevitable, then,\npoverty is also inevitable. The functionalist view further implies that if people are\npoor, it is because they do not have the ability to acquire the skills and knowledge\nnecessary for the important, high-paying jobs.\nThe functionalist view sounds very logical, but a few years after Davis and Moore\npublished their theory, other sociologists pointed out some serious problems in\ntheir argument (Tumin, 1953; Wrong, 1959).\nFirst, it is difficult to compare the importance of many types of jobs. For example,\nwhich is more important, doing brain surgery or mining coal? Although you might\nbe tempted to answer with brain surgery, if no coal were mined then much of our\nsociety could not function. In another example, which job is more important,\nattorney or professor? (Be careful how you answer this one!)\nSecond, the functionalist explanation implies that the most important jobs have\nthe highest incomes and the least important jobs the lowest incomes, but many\nexamples, including the ones just mentioned, counter this view. Coal miners make\nmuch less money than physicians, and professors, for better or worse, earn much\nless on the average than lawyers. A professional athlete making millions of dollars\na year earns many times the income of the president of the United States, but\nwho is more important to the nation? Elementary school teachers do a very\nimportant job in our society, but their salaries are much lower than those of\nsports agents, advertising executives, and many other people whose jobs are far\nless essential.\nThird, the functionalist view assumes that people move up the economic ladder\nbased on their abilities, skills, knowledge, and, more generally, their merit. This\nimplies that if they do not move up the ladder, they lack the necessary merit.\nHowever, this view ignores the fact that much of our stratification stems from\nlack of equal opportunity. As later chapters in this book discuss, because of their\nrace, ethnicity, gender, and class standing at birth, some people have less\nopportunity than others to acquire the skills and training they need to fill the\ntypes of jobs addressed by the functionalist approach. Finally, the functionalist explanation might make sense up to a point, but it does\nnot justify the extremes of wealth and poverty found in the United States and\nother nations. Even if we do have to promise higher incomes to get enough\npeople to become physicians, does that mean we also need the amount of\npoverty we have? Do CEOs of corporations really need to make millions of dollars\nper year to get enough qualified people to become CEOs? Do people take on a\nposition as CEO or other high-paying job at least partly because of the challenge,\nworking conditions, and other positive aspects they offer? The functionalist view\ndoes not answer these questions adequately.\nOne other line of functionalist thinking focuses more directly on poverty than\ngenerally on stratification. This particular functionalist view provocatively argues\nthat poverty exists because it serves certain positive functions for our society.\nThese functions include the following: (1) poor people do the work that other\npeople do not want to do; (2) the programs that help poor people provide a lot of\njobs for the people employed by the programs; (3) the poor purchase goods, such\nas day-old bread and used clothing, that other people do not wish to purchase,\nand thus extend the economic value of these goods; and (4) the poor provide jobs\nfor doctors, lawyers, teachers, and other professionals who may not be\ncompetent enough to be employed in positions catering to wealthier patients,\nclients, students, and so forth (Gans, 1972). Because poverty serves all these\nfunctions and more, according to this argument, the middle and upper classes\nhave a vested interested in neglecting poverty to help ensure its continued\nexistence.\nThe Conflict View Because he was born in a log cabin and later became president, Abraham\nLincoln\u2019s life epitomizes the American Dream, which is the belief that people born\ninto poverty can become successful through hard work. The popularity of this\nbelief leads many Americans to blame poor people for their poverty.\nUS Library of Congress \u2013 public domain.\nConflict theory\u2019s explanation of stratification draws on Karl Marx\u2019s view of class\nsocieties and incorporates the critique of the functionalist view just discussed.\nMany different explanations grounded in conflict theory exist, but they all assume\nthat stratification stems from a fundamental conflict between the needs and\ninterests of the powerful, or \u201chaves,\u201d in society and those of the weak, or \u201chave-\nnots\u201d (Kerbo, 2012). The former take advantage of their position at the top of\nsociety to stay at the top, even if it means oppressing those at the bottom. At a\nminimum, they can heavily influence the law, the media, and other institutions in\na way that maintains society\u2019s class structure.\nIn general, conflict theory attributes stratification and thus poverty to lack of\nopportunity from discrimination and prejudice against the poor, women, and\npeople of color. In this regard, it reflects one of the early critiques of the\nfunctionalist view that the previous section outlined. To reiterate an earlier point,\nseveral of the remaining chapters of this book discuss the various obstacles that\nmake it difficult for the poor, women, and people of color in the United States to\nmove up the socioeconomic ladder and to otherwise enjoy healthy and\nproductive lives. Symbolic Interactionism\nConsistent with its micro orientation, symbolic interactionism tries to understand\nstratification and thus poverty by looking at people\u2019s interaction and\nunderstandings in their daily lives. Unlike the functionalist and conflict views, it\ndoes not try to explain why we have stratification in the first place. Rather, it\nexamines the differences that stratification makes for people\u2019s lifestyles and their\ninteraction with other people.\nMany detailed, insightful sociological books on the lives of the urban and rural\npoor reflect the symbolic interactionist perspective (Anderson, 1999; C. M.\nDuncan, 2000; Liebow, 1993; Rank, 1994). These books focus on different people\nin different places, but they all make very clear that the poor often lead lives of\nquiet desperation and must find ways of coping with the fact of being poor. In\nthese books, the consequences of poverty discussed later in this chapter acquire a\nhuman face, and readers learn in great detail what it is like to live in poverty on a\ndaily basis.\nSome classic journalistic accounts by authors not trained in the social sciences\nalso present eloquent descriptions of poor people\u2019s lives (Bagdikian, 1964;\nHarrington, 1962). Writing in this tradition, a newspaper columnist who grew up\nin poverty recently recalled, \u201cI know the feel of thick calluses on the bottom of\nshoeless feet. I know the bite of the cold breeze that slithers through a drafty\nhouse. I know the weight of constant worry over not having enough to fill a belly\nor fight an illness\u2026Poverty is brutal, consuming and unforgiving. It strikes at the\nsoul\u201d (Blow, 2011). Sociological accounts of the poor provide a vivid portrait of what it is like to live in\npoverty on a daily basis.\nPixabay \u2013 CC0 public domain.\nOn a more lighthearted note, examples of the symbolic interactionist framework\nare also seen in the many literary works and films that portray the difficulties that\nthe rich and poor have in interacting on the relatively few occasions when they do\ninteract. For example, in the film Pretty Woman, Richard Gere plays a rich\nbusinessman who hires a prostitute, played by Julia Roberts, to accompany him to\nswank parties and other affairs. Roberts has to buy a new wardrobe and learn\nhow to dine and behave in these social settings, and much of the film\u2019s humor\nand poignancy come from her awkwardness in learning the lifestyle of the rich.\nSpecific Explanations of Poverty\nThe functionalist and conflict views focus broadly on social stratification but only\nindirectly on poverty. When poverty finally attracted national attention during the\n1960s, scholars began to try specifically to understand why poor people become\npoor and remain poor. Two competing explanations developed, with the basic\ndebate turning on whether poverty arises from problems either within the poor\nthemselves or in the society in which they live (Rank, 2011). The first type of\nexplanation follows logically from the functional theory of stratification and may\nbe considered an individualistic explanation. The second type of explanation\nfollows from conflict theory and is a structural explanation that focuses on\nproblems in American society that produce poverty. Table 2.3 \u201cExplanations of\nPoverty\u201d summarizes these explanations.\nTable 2.3 Explanations of Poverty\nExplanation Major assumptions\nPoverty results from the fact that poor people lack the motivation\nIndividualistic to work and have certain beliefs and values that contribute to\ntheir poverty.\nPoverty results from problems in society that lead to a lack of\nStructural\nopportunity and a lack of jobs. It is critical to determine which explanation makes more sense because, as\nsociologist Theresa C. Davidson (Davidson, 2009) observes, \u201cbeliefs about the\ncauses of poverty shape attitudes toward the poor.\u201d To be more precise, the\nparticular explanation that people favor affects their view of government efforts\nto help the poor. Those who attribute poverty to problems in the larger society\nare much more likely than those who attribute it to deficiencies among the poor\nto believe that the government should do more to help the poor (Bradley & Cole,\n2002). The explanation for poverty we favor presumably affects the amount of\nsympathy we have for the poor, and our sympathy, or lack of sympathy, in turn\naffects our views about the government\u2019s role in helping the poor. With this\nbackdrop in mind, what do the individualistic and structural explanations of\npoverty say?\nIndividualistic Explanation\nAccording to the individualistic explanation, the poor have personal problems and\ndeficiencies that are responsible for their poverty. In the past, the poor were\nthought to be biologically inferior, a view that has not entirely faded, but today\nthe much more common belief is that they lack the ambition and motivation to\nwork hard and to achieve success. According to survey evidence, the majority of\nAmericans share this belief (Davidson, 2009). A more sophisticated version of this\ntype of explanation is called the culture of poverty theory (Banfield, 1974; Lewis,\n1966; Murray, 2012). According to this theory, the poor generally have beliefs and\nvalues that differ from those of the nonpoor and that doom them to continued\npoverty. For example, they are said to be impulsive and to live for the present\nrather than the future.\nRegardless of which version one might hold, the individualistic explanation is a\nblaming-the-victim approach (see Chapter 1 \u201cUnderstanding Social Problems\u201d).\nCritics say this explanation ignores discrimination and other problems in American\nsociety and exaggerates the degree to which the poor and nonpoor do in fact hold\ndifferent values (Ehrenreich, 2012; Holland, 2011; Schmidt, 2012). Regarding the\nlatter point, they note that poor employed adults work more hours per week than\nwealthier adults and that poor parents interviewed in surveys value education for\ntheir children at least as much as wealthier parents. These and other similarities\nin values and beliefs lead critics of the individualistic explanation to conclude that poor people\u2019s poverty cannot reasonably be said to result from a culture of\npoverty.\nStructural Explanation\nAccording to the second, structural explanation, which is a blaming-the-system\napproach, US poverty stems from problems in American society that lead to a lack\nof equal opportunity and a lack of jobs. These problems include (a) racial, ethnic,\ngender, and age discrimination; (b) lack of good schooling and adequate health\ncare; and (c) structural changes in the American economic system, such as the\ndeparture of manufacturing companies from American cities in the 1980s and\n1990s that led to the loss of thousands of jobs. These problems help create a\nvicious cycle of poverty in which children of the poor are often fated to end up in\npoverty or near poverty themselves as adults.\nAs Rank (Rank, 2011) summarizes this view, \u201cAmerican poverty is largely the\nresult of failings at the economic and political levels, rather than at the individual\nlevel\u2026In contrast to [the individualistic] perspective, the basic problem lies in a\nshortage of viable opportunities for all Americans.\u201d Rank points out that the US\neconomy during the past few decades has created more low-paying and part-time\njobs and jobs without benefits, meaning that Americans increasingly find\nthemselves in jobs that barely lift them out of poverty, if at all. Sociologist Fred\nBlock and colleagues share this critique of the individualistic perspective: \u201cMost of\nour policies incorrectly assume that people can avoid or overcome poverty\nthrough hard work alone. Yet this assumption ignores the realities of our failing\nurban schools, increasing employment insecurities, and the lack of affordable\nhousing, health care, and child care. It ignores the fact that the American Dream is\nrapidly becoming unattainable for an increasing number of Americans, whether\nemployed or not\u201d (Block, et. al., 2006).\nMost sociologists favor the structural explanation. As later chapters in this book\ndocument, racial and ethnic discrimination, lack of adequate schooling and health\ncare, and other problems make it difficult to rise out of poverty. On the other\nhand, some ethnographic research supports the individualistic explanation by\nshowing that the poor do have certain values and follow certain practices that\naugment their plight (Small, et. al., 2010). For example, the poor have higher rates\nof cigarette smoking (34 percent of people with annual incomes between $6,000\nand $11,999 smoke, compared to only 13 percent of those with incomes $90,000 or greater [Goszkowski, 2008]), which helps cause them to have more serious\nhealth problems.\nAdopting an integrated perspective, some researchers say these values and\npractices are ultimately the result of poverty itself (Small et, al., 2010). These\nscholars concede a culture of poverty does exist, but they also say it exists\nbecause it helps the poor cope daily with the structural effects of being poor. If\nthese effects lead to a culture of poverty, they add, poverty then becomes self-\nperpetuating. If poverty is both cultural and structural in origin, these scholars\nsay, efforts to improve the lives of people in the \u201cother America\u201d must involve\nincreased structural opportunities for the poor and changes in some of their\nvalues and practices.\nKey Takeaways:\nAccording to the functionalist view, stratification is a necessary and inevitable\nconsequence of the need to use the promise of financial reward to encourage\ntalented people to pursue important jobs and careers.\nAccording to conflict theory, stratification results from lack of opportunity and\ndiscrimination against the poor and people of color.\nAccording to symbolic interactionism, social class affects how people interact in\neveryday life and how they view certain aspects of the social world.\nThe individualistic view attributes poverty to individual failings of poor people\nthemselves, while the structural view attributes poverty to problems in the larger\nsociety.\nReferences\nAnderson, E.

Much research conducted and/or analyzed by scholars, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations has documented the effects of poverty (and\nnear poverty) on the lives of the poor (Lindsey, 2009; Moore, et. al., 2009;\nRatcliffe & McKernan, 2010; Sanders, 2011). Many of these studies focus on\nchildhood poverty, and these studies make it very clear that childhood poverty\nhas lifelong consequences. In general, poor children are more likely to be poor as\nadults, more likely to drop out of high school, more likely to become a teenaged\nparent, and more likely to have employment problems. Although only 1 percent\nof children who are never poor end up being poor as young adults, 32 percent of\npoor children become poor as young adults (Ratcliffe & McKernan, 2010).\nPoor children are more likely to have inadequate nutrition and to experience\nhealth, behavioral, and cognitive problems.\nKelly Short \u2013 Poverty: \u201cDamaged Child,\u201d Oklahoma City, OK, USA, 1936.\n(Colorized). \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nA recent study used government data to follow children born between 1968 and\n1975 until they were ages 30 to 37 (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011). The researchers\ncompared individuals who lived in poverty in early childhood to those whose\nfamilies had incomes at least twice the poverty line in early childhood. Compared\nto the latter group, adults who were poor in early childhood\n\uf0b7 had completed two fewer years of schooling on the average;\n\uf0b7 had incomes that were less than half of those earned by adults who had\nwealthier childhoods; \uf0b7 received $826 more annually in food stamps on the average;\n\uf0b7 were almost three times more likely to report being in poor health;\n\uf0b7 were twice as likely to have been arrested (males only); and\n\uf0b7 were five times as likely to have borne a child (females only).\nWe discuss some of the major specific consequences of poverty here and will\nreturn to them in later chapters.\nFamily Problems\nThe poor are at greater risk for family problems, including divorce and domestic\nviolence. As Chapter 9 \u201cSexual Behavior\u201d explains, a major reason for many of the\nproblems families experience is stress. Even in families that are not poor, running\na household can cause stress, children can cause stress, and paying the bills can\ncause stress. Families that are poor have more stress because of their poverty,\nand the ordinary stresses of family life become even more intense in poor\nfamilies. The various kinds of family problems thus happen more commonly in\npoor families than in wealthier families. Compounding this situation, when these\nproblems occur, poor families have fewer resources than wealthier families to\ndeal with these problems.\nChildren and Our Future\nGetting under Children\u2019s Skin: The Biological Effects of Childhood Poverty\nAs the text discusses, childhood poverty often has lifelong consequences. Poor\nchildren are more likely to be poor when they become adults, and they are at\ngreater risk for antisocial behavior when young, and for unemployment, criminal\nbehavior, and other problems when they reach adolescence and young\nadulthood.\nAccording to growing evidence, one reason poverty has these consequences is\nthat it has certain neural effects on poor children that impair their cognitive\nabilities and thus their behavior and learning potential. As Greg J. Duncan and\nKatherine Magnuson (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011, p. 23) observe, \u201cEmerging\nresearch in neuroscience and developmental psychology suggests that poverty\nearly in a child\u2019s life may be particularly harmful because the astonishingly rapid\ndevelopment of young children\u2019s brains leaves them sensitive (and vulnerable) to\nenvironmental conditions.\u201d In short, poverty can change the way the brain develops in young children. The\nmajor reason for this effect is stress. Children growing up in poverty experience\nmultiple stressful events: neighborhood crime and drug use; divorce, parental\nconflict, and other family problems, including abuse and neglect by their parents;\nparental financial problems and unemployment; physical and mental health\nproblems of one or more family members; and so forth. Their great levels of\nstress in turn affect their bodies in certain harmful ways. As two poverty scholars\nnote, \u201cIt\u2019s not just that poverty-induced stress is mentally taxing. If it\u2019s\nexperienced early enough in childhood, it can in fact get \u2018under the skin\u2019 and\nchange the way in which the body copes with the environment and the way in\nwhich the brain develops. These deep, enduring, and sometimes irreversible\nphysiological changes are the very human price of running a high-poverty society\u201d\n(Grusky & Wimer, 2011, p. 2).\nOne way poverty gets \u201cunder children\u2019s skin\u201d is as follows (Evans, et. al., 2011).\nPoor children\u2019s high levels of stress produce unusually high levels of stress\nhormones such as cortisol and higher levels of blood pressure. Because these high\nlevels impair their neural development, their memory and language development\nskills suffer. This result in turn affects their behavior and learning potential. For\nother physiological reasons, high levels of stress also affect the immune system,\nso that poor children are more likely to develop various illnesses during childhood\nand to have high blood pressure and other health problems when they grow\nolder, and cause other biological changes that make poor children more likely to\nend up being obese and to have drug and alcohol problems.\nThe policy implications of the scientific research on childhood poverty are clear.\nAs public health scholar Jack P. Shonkoff (Shonkoff, 2011) explains, \u201cViewing this\nscientific evidence within a biodevelopmental framework points to the particular\nimportance of addressing the needs of our most disadvantaged children at the\nearliest ages.\u201d Duncan and Magnuson (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011) agree that\n\u201cgreater policy attention should be given to remediating situations involving deep\nand persistent poverty occurring early in childhood.\u201d To reduce poverty\u2019s harmful\nphysiological effects on children, Skonkoff advocates efforts to promote strong,\nstable relationships among all members of poor families; to improve the quality of\nthe home and neighborhood physical environments in which poor children grow;\nand to improve the nutrition of poor children. Duncan and Magnuson call for\nmore generous income transfers to poor families with young children and note\nthat many European democracies provide many kinds of support to such families.\nThe recent scientific evidence on early childhood poverty underscores the importance of doing everything possible to reduce the harmful effects of poverty\nduring the first few years of life.\nHealth, Illness, and Medical Care\nThe poor are also more likely to have many kinds of health problems, including\ninfant mortality, earlier adulthood mortality, and mental illness, and they are also\nmore likely to receive inadequate medical care. Poor children are more likely to\nhave inadequate nutrition and, partly for this reason, to suffer health, behavioral,\nand cognitive problems. These problems in turn impair their ability to do well in\nschool and land stable employment as adults, helping to ensure that poverty will\npersist across generations. Many poor people are uninsured or underinsured, at\nleast until the US health-care reform legislation of 2010 takes full effect a few\nyears from now, and many have to visit health clinics that are overcrowded and\nunderstaffed.\nAs Chapter 12 \u201cWork and the Economy\u201d discusses, it is unclear how much of poor\npeople\u2019s worse health stems from their lack of money and lack of good health\ncare versus their own behavior such as smoking and eating unhealthy diets.\nRegardless of the exact reasons, however, the fact remains that poor health is a\nmajor consequence of poverty. According to recent research, this fact means that\npoverty is responsible for almost 150,000 deaths annually, a figure about equal to\nthe number of deaths from lung cancer (Bakalar, 2011).\nEducation\nPoor children typically go to rundown schools with inadequate facilities where\nthey receive inadequate schooling. They are much less likely than wealthier\nchildren to graduate from high school or to go to college. Their lack of education\nin turn restricts them and their own children to poverty, once again helping to\nensure a vicious cycle of continuing poverty across generations. As Chapter 10\n\u201cThe Changing Family\u201d explains, scholars debate whether the poor school\nperformance of poor children stems more from the inadequacy of their schools\nand schooling versus their own poverty. Regardless of exactly why poor children\nare more likely to do poorly in school and to have low educational attainment,\nthese educational problems are another major consequence of poverty.\nHousing and Homelessness The poor are, not surprisingly, more likely to be homeless than the nonpoor but\nalso more likely to live in dilapidated housing and unable to buy their own homes.\nMany poor families spend more than half their income on rent, and they tend to\nlive in poor neighborhoods that lack job opportunities, good schools, and other\nfeatures of modern life that wealthier people take for granted. The lack of\nadequate housing for the poor remains a major national problem. Even worse is\noutright homelessness. An estimated 1.6 million people, including more than\n300,000 children, are homeless at least part of the year (Lee, et. al., 2010).\nCrime and Victimization\nAs Chapter 7 \u201cAlcohol and Other Drugs\u201d discusses, poor (and near poor) people\naccount for the bulk of our street crime (homicide, robbery, burglary, etc.), and\nthey also account for the bulk of victims of street crime. That chapter will outline\nseveral reasons for this dual connection between poverty and street crime, but\nthey include the deep frustration and stress of living in poverty and the fact that\nmany poor people live in high-crime neighborhoods. In such neighborhoods,\nchildren are more likely to grow up under the influence of older peers who are\nalready in gangs or otherwise committing crime, and people of any age are more\nlikely to become crime victims. Moreover, because poor and near-poor people\nare more likely to commit street crime, they also comprise most of the people\narrested for street crimes, convicted of street crime, and imprisoned for street\ncrime. Most of the more than 2 million people now in the nation\u2019s prisons and\njails come from poor or near-poor backgrounds. Criminal behavior and criminal\nvictimization, then, are other major consequences of poverty.\nLessons from Other Societies\nPoverty and Poverty Policy in Other Western Democracies\nTo compare international poverty rates, scholars commonly use a measure of the\npercentage of households in a nation that receive less than half of the nation\u2019s\nmedian household income after taxes and cash transfers from the government. In\ndata from the late 2000s, 17.3 percent of US households lived in poverty as\ndefined by this measure. By comparison, other Western democracies had the\nrates depicted in the figure that follows. The average poverty rate of the nations\nin the figure excluding the United States is 9.5 percent. The US rate is thus almost\ntwice as high as the average for all the other democracies. This graph illustrates the poverty rates in western democracies (i.e., the\npercentage of persons living with less than half of the median household income)\nas of the late 2000s\nSource: Data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD).

Several differences between the United States and the other\nnations stand out (Brady, 2009; Russell, 2011). First, other Western nations have\nhigher minimum wages and stronger labor unions than the United States has, and\nthese lead to incomes that help push people above poverty. Second, these other\nnations spend a much greater proportion of their gross domestic product on\nsocial expenditures (income support and social services such as child-care\nsubsidies and housing allowances) than does the United States. As sociologist\nJohn Iceland (Iceland, 2006) notes, \u201cSuch countries often invest heavily in both\nuniversal benefits, such as maternity leave, child care, and medical care, and in\npromoting work among [poor] families\u2026The United States, in comparison with\nother advanced nations, lacks national health insurance, provides less publicly supported housing, and spends less on job training and job creation.\u201d Block and\ncolleagues agree: \u201cThese other countries all take a more comprehensive\ngovernment approach to combating poverty, and they assume that it is caused by\neconomic and structural factors rather than bad behavior\u201d (Block et, al., 2006).\nThe experience of the United Kingdom provides a striking contrast between the\neffectiveness of the expansive approach used in other wealthy democracies and\nthe inadequacy of the American approach. In 1994, about 30 percent of British\nchildren lived in poverty; by 2009, that figure had fallen by more than half to 12\npercent. Meanwhile, the US 2009 child poverty rate, was almost 21 percent.\nBritain used three strategies to reduce its child poverty rate and to help poor\nchildren and their families in other ways. First, it induced more poor parents to\nwork through a series of new measures, including a national minimum wage\nhigher than its US counterpart and various tax savings for low-income workers.\nBecause of these measures, the percentage of single parents who worked rose\nfrom 45 percent in 1997 to 57 percent in 2008. Second, Britain increased child\nwelfare benefits regardless of whether a parent worked. Third, it increased paid\nmaternity leave from four months to nine months, implemented two weeks of\npaid paternity leave, established universal preschool (which both helps children\u2019s\ncognitive abilities and makes it easier for parents to afford to work), increased\nchild-care aid, and made it possible for parents of young children to adjust their\nworking hours to their parental responsibilities (Waldfogel, 2010). While the\nBritish child poverty rate fell dramatically because of these strategies, the US child\npoverty rate stagnated.\nIn short, the United States has so much more poverty than other democracies in\npart because it spends so much less than they do on helping the poor. The United\nStates certainly has the wealth to follow their example, but it has chosen not to\ndo so, and a high poverty rate is the unfortunate result. As the Nobel laureate\neconomist Paul Krugman (2006, p. A25) summarizes this lesson, \u201cGovernment\ntruly can be a force for good. Decades of propaganda have conditioned many\nAmericans to assume that government is always incompetent\u2026But the [British\nexperience has] shown that a government that seriously tries to reduce poverty\ncan achieve a lot.\u201d\nKey Takeaways:\nPoor people are more likely to have several kinds of family problems, including\ndivorce and family conflict. Poor people are more likely to have several kinds of health problems.\nChildren growing up in poverty are less likely to graduate high school or go to\ncollege, and they are more likely to commit street crime.\nReferences\nBakalar, N.

Many of the world\u2019s\npoor live in such desperate circumstances that they would envy the lives of poor\nAmericans. Without at all meaning to minimize the plight of the American poor,\nthis section provides a brief look at the world\u2019s poor and at the dimensions of\nglobal poverty\nGlobal Inequality\nThe world has a few very rich nations and many very poor nations, and there is an\nenormous gulf between these two extremes. If the world were one nation, its\nmedian annual income (at which half of the world\u2019s population is below this\nincome and half is above it) would be only $1,700 (Dikhanov, 2005). The richest\nfifth of the world\u2019s population would have three-fourths of the world\u2019s entire\nincome, while the poorest fifth of the world\u2019s population would have only 1.5\npercent of the world\u2019s income, and the poorest two-fifths would have only 5.0\npercent of the world\u2019s income (Dikhanov, 2005). Reflecting this latter fact, these\npoorest two-fifths, or about 2 billion people, live on less than $2 per day (United\nNations Development Programme, 2009). As Figure 2.5 \u201cGlobal Income\nDistribution (Percentage of World Income Held by Each Fifth of World\nPopulation)\u201d illustrates, this distribution of income resembles a champagne glass.\nFigure 2.5 Global Income Distribution (Percentage of World Income Held by Each\nFifth of World Population) Source: Data from Dikhanov, Y. (2005). Trends in global income distribution,\n1970\u20132000, and scenarios for 2015. New York, NY: United Nations Development\nProgramme.\nTo understand global inequality, it is helpful to classify nations into a small\nnumber of categories based on their degree of wealth or poverty, their level of\nindustrialization and economic development, and related factors. Over the\ndecades, scholars and international organizations such as the United Nations and\nthe World Bank have used various classification systems, or typologies. A popular\ntypology today simply ranks nations into groups called wealthy (or high-income)\nnations, middle-income nations, and poor (or low-income) nations, based on\nmeasures such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (the total value of a\nnation\u2019s goods and services divided by its population). This typology has the\nadvantage of emphasizing the most important variable in global stratification:\nhow much wealth a nation has. At the risk of being somewhat simplistic, the other\nimportant differences among the world\u2019s nations all stem from their degree of\nwealth or poverty. Figure 2.6 \u201cGlobal Stratification Map\u201ddepicts these three\ncategories of nations (with the middle category divided into upper-middle and lower-middle). As should be clear, whether a nation is wealthy, middle income, or\npoor is heavily related to the continent on which it is found.\nFigure 2.6 Global Stratification Map\nSource: Adapted from UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library.\n(2009).Country income groups (World Bank classification). Retrieved\nfrom http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/country-income-groups-world-bank-\nclassification.\nMeasuring Global Poverty The World Bank has begun to emphasize vulnerability to poverty. Many people\nwho are not officially poor have a good chance of becoming poor within a year.\nStrategies to prevent this from happening are a major focus of the World Bank.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nHow do we know which nations are poor? A very common measure of global\npoverty was developed by the World Bank, an international institution funded by\nwealthy nations that provides loans, grants, and other aid to help poor and\nmiddle-income nations. Each year the World Bank publishes its World\nDevelopment Report, which provides statistics and other information on the\neconomic and social well-being of the globe\u2019s almost two hundred nations. The\nWorld Bank puts the official global poverty line (which is considered a measure of\nextreme poverty) at income under $1.25 per person per day, which amounts to\nabout $456 yearly per person or $1,825 for a family of four. According to this\nmeasure, 1.4 billion people, making up more than one-fifth of the world\u2019s\npopulation and more than one-fourth of the population of developing (poor and\nmiddle-income) nations, are poor. This level of poverty rises to 40 percent of\nSouth Asia and 51 percent of sub-Saharan Africa (Haughton & Khandker, 2009).\nIn a new development, the World Bank has begun emphasizing the concept\nof vulnerability to poverty, which refers to a significant probability that people\nwho are not officially poor will become poor within the next year. Determining vulnerability to poverty is important because it enables antipoverty strategies to\nbe aimed at those most at risk for sliding into poverty, with the hope of\npreventing them from doing so.\nVulnerability to poverty appears widespread; in several developing nations, about\none-fourth of the population is always poor, while almost one-third is vulnerable\nto poverty or is slipping into and out of poverty. In these nations, more than half\nthe population is always or sometimes poor. (Haughton & Khandker, 2009)\nsummarize this situation: \u201cAs typically defined, vulnerability to poverty is more\nwidespread than poverty itself. A wide swathe of society risks poverty at some\npoint of time; put another way, in most societies, only a relatively modest portion\nof society may be considered as economically secure.\u201d\nExplaining Global Poverty\nExplanations of global poverty parallel those of US poverty in their focus on\nindividualistic versus structural problems. One type of explanation takes an\nindividualistic approach by, in effect, blaming the people in the poorest nations\nfor their own poverty, while a second explanation takes a structural approach in\nblaming the plight of poor nations on their treatment by the richest ones. Table\n2.4 \u201cTheory Snapshot\u201d summarizes the two sets of explanations.\nTable 2.4 Theory Snapshot\nTheory Major assumptions\nWealthy nations became wealthy because early on they were\nable to develop the necessary beliefs, values, and practices for\ntrade, industrialization, and rapid economic growth to occur.\nModernization\nPoor nations remained poor because they failed to develop\ntheory\nthese beliefs, values, and practices; instead, they continued to\nfollow traditional beliefs and practices that stymied industrial\ndevelopment and modernization.\nThe poverty of poor nations stems from their colonization by\nEuropean nations, which exploited the poor nations\u2019 resources\nDependency\nand either enslaved their populations or used them as cheap\ntheory\nlabor. The colonized nations were thus unable to develop a\nprofessional and business class that would have enabled them Theory Major assumptions\nto enter the industrial age and to otherwise develop their\neconomies.\nModernization Theory\nThe individualistic explanation is called modernization theory (Rostow, 1990).\nAccording to this theory, rich nations became wealthy because early on they were\nable to develop the \u201ccorrect\u201d beliefs, values, and practices\u2014in short, the correct\nculture\u2014for trade, industrialization, and rapid economic growth to occur. These\ncultural traits include a willingness to work hard, to abandon tradition in favor of\nnew ways of thinking and doing things, and to adopt a future orientation rather\nthan one focused on maintaining present conditions. Thus Western European\nnations began to emerge several centuries ago as economic powers because their\npopulations adopted the kinds of values and practices just listed. In contrast,\nnations in other parts of the world never became wealthy and remain poor today\nbecause they never developed the appropriate values and practices. Instead, they\ncontinued to follow traditional beliefs and practices that stymied industrial\ndevelopment and modernization.\nAccording to modernization theory, poor nations are poor because their people\nnever developed values such as an emphasis on hard work. United Nations Photo \u2013 OLS Brings Support to Strained Medical Services \u2013 CC BY-\nNC-ND 2.0.\nModernization theory has much in common with the culture of poverty theory\ndiscussed earlier. It attributes the poverty of poor nations to their failure to\ndevelop the \u201cproper\u201d beliefs, values, and practices necessary for economic\nsuccess both at the beginning of industrialization during the nineteenth century\nand in the two centuries that have since transpired. Because modernization\ntheory implies that people in poor nations do not have the talent and ability to\nimprove their lot, it may be considered a functionalist explanation of global\ninequality.\nDependency Theory\nThe structural explanation for global stratification is called dependency theory,\nwhich may be considered a conflict explanation of global inequality. Not\nsurprisingly, this theory\u2019s views sharply challenge modernization theory\u2019s\nassumptions (Packenham, 1992). Whereas modernization theory attributes global\nstratification to the \u201cwrong\u201d cultural values and practices in poor nations,\ndependency theory blames global stratification on the exploitation of these\nnations by wealthy nations. According to this view, poor nations never got the\nchance to pursue economic growth because early on they were conquered and\ncolonized by European ones. The European nations stole the poor nations\u2019\nresources and either enslaved their populations or used them as cheap labor.\nThey installed their own governments and often prevented the local populace\nfrom getting a good education. As a result, the colonized nations were unable to\ndevelop a professional and business class that would have enabled them to enter\nthe industrial age and to otherwise develop their economies. Along the way,\nwealthy nations sold their own goods to colonized nations and forced them to run\nup enormous debt that continues to amount today.\nIn today\u2019s world, huge multinational corporations continue to exploit the labor\nand resources of the poorest nations, say dependency theorists. These\ncorporations run sweatshops in many nations, in which workers toil in inhumane\nconditions at extremely low wages (Sluiter, 2009). Often the corporations work\nhand-in-hand with corrupt officials in the poor nations to strengthen their\neconomic stake in the countries.\nComparing the Theories Which makes more sense, modernization theory or dependency theory? As with\nmany theories, both make sense to some degree, but both have their faults.\nModernization theory places too much blame on poor nations for their own\npoverty and ignores the long history of exploitation of poor nations by rich\nnations and multinational corporations alike. For its part, dependency theory\ncannot explain why some of the poorest countries are poor even though they\nwere never European colonies; neither can it explain why some former colonies\nsuch as Hong Kong have been able to attain enough economic growth to leave the\nrank of the poorest nations. Together, both theories help us understand the\nreasons for global stratification, but most sociologists would probably favor\ndependency theory because of its emphasis on structural factors in the world\u2019s\nhistoric and current economy.\nThe Lives of the World\u2019s Poor\nPoor nations are the least industrialized and most agricultural of all the world\u2019s\ncountries. They consist primarily of nations in Africa and parts of Asia and\nconstitute roughly half of the world\u2019s population. Many of these nations rely\nheavily on one or two crops, and if weather conditions render a crop\nunproductive in a particular season, the nations\u2019 hungry become even hungrier.\nBy the same token, if economic conditions reduce the price of a crop or other\nnatural resource, the income from exports of these commodities plummets, and\nthese already poor nations become even poorer. People in poor nations live in the most miserable conditions possible.\nUnited Nations Photo \u2013 Maslakh Camp for Displaced, Afghanistan \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND\n2.0.\nBy any standard, the more than 1.4 billion people in poor nations live a desperate\nexistence in the most miserable conditions possible. They suffer from AIDS and\nother deadly diseases, live on the edge of starvation, and lack indoor plumbing,\nelectricity, and other modern conveniences that most Americans take for granted.\nMost of us have seen unforgettable photos or video footage of African children\nwith stick-thin limbs and distended stomachs reflecting severe malnutrition.\nIt would be nice if these images were merely fiction, but unfortunately they are\nfar too real. AIDS, malaria, starvation, and other deadly diseases are common.\nMany children die before reaching adolescence, and many adults die before\nreaching what in the richest nations would be considered middle age. Many\npeople in the poorest nations are illiterate, and a college education remains as\nforeign to them as their way of life would be to us. The images of the world\u2019s poor\nthat we see in television news reports or in film documentaries fade quickly from\nour minds. Meanwhile, millions of people on our planet die every year because\nthey do not have enough to eat, because they lack access to clean water or\nadequate sanitation, or because they lack access to medicine that is found in\nevery CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens in the United States. We now examine some\nspecific dimensions and consequences of global poverty.\nLife Expectancy\nWhen we look around the world, we see that global poverty is literally a matter of\nlife and death. The clearest evidence of this fact comes from data on life\nexpectancy, or the average number of years that a nation\u2019s citizens can be\nexpected to live. Life expectancy certainly differs within each nation, with some\npeople dying younger and others dying older, but poverty and related conditions\naffect a nation\u2019s overall life expectancy to a startling degree.\nFigure 2.7 Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years) Source: Adapted from Global Education Project. (2004). Human conditions: World\nlife expectancy map. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/earth/human-conditions.php.\nA map of global life expectancy appears in Figure 2.7 \u201cAverage Life Expectancy\nacross the Globe (Years)\u201d. Life expectancy is highest in North America, Western\nEurope, and certain other regions of the world and lowest in Africa and South\nAsia, where life expectancy in many nations is some 30 years shorter than in other\nregions. Another way of visualizing the relationship between global poverty and\nlife expectancy appears in Figure 2.8 \u201cGlobal Poverty and Life Expectancy, 2006\u201d,\nwhich depicts average life expectancy for wealthy nations, upper-middle-income\nnations, lower-middle-income nations, and poor nations. Men in wealthy nations\ncan expect to live 76 years on average, compared to only 56 in poor nations;\nwomen in wealthy nations can expect to live 82 years, compared to only 58 in\npoor nations. Life expectancy in poor nations is thus 20 and 24 years lower,\nrespectively, for the two sexes.\nFigure 2.8 Global Poverty and Life Expectancy, 2006 Source: Data from World Bank. (2009). World development report 2009.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nChild Mortality\nA key contributor to life expectancy and also a significant consequence of global\npoverty in its own right is child mortality, the number of children who die before\nage 5 per 1,000 children. As Figure 2.9 \u201cGlobal Poverty and Child Mortality,\n2006\u201d shows, the rate of child mortality in poor nations is 135 per 1,000 children,\nmeaning that 13.5 percent of all children in these nations die before age 5. In a\nfew African nations, child mortality exceeds 200 per 1,000. In contrast, the rate in\nwealthy nations is only 7 per 1,000. Children in poor nations are thus about 19\ntimes (13.5 \u00f7 0.7) more likely to die before age 5 than children in wealthy nations.\nFigure 2.9 Global Poverty and Child Mortality, 2006 Source: Data from World Bank. (2009). World development report 2009.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nSanitation and Clean Water\nTwo other important indicators of a nation\u2019s health are access to adequate\nsanitation (disposal of human waste) and access to clean water. When people lack\nadequate sanitation and clean water, they are at much greater risk for life-\nthreatening diarrhea, serious infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid, and\nparasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis (World Health Organization, 2010).\nAbout 2.4 billion people around the world, almost all of them in poor and middle-\nincome nations, do not have adequate sanitation, and more than 2 million, most\nof them children, die annually from diarrhea. More than 40 million people\nworldwide, almost all of them again in poor and middle-income nations, suffer\nfrom a parasitic infection caused by flatworms.\nAs Figure 2.10 \u201cGlobal Stratification and Access to Adequate Sanitation,\n2006\u201d and Figure 2.11 \u201cGlobal Stratification and Access to Clean Water,\n2006\u201d show, access to adequate sanitation and clean water is strongly related to\nnational wealth. Poor nations are much less likely than wealthier nations to have\nadequate access to both sanitation and clean water. Adequate sanitation is\nvirtually universal in wealthy nations but is available to only 38 percent of people\nin poor nations. Clean water is also nearly universal in wealthy nations but is\navailable to only 67 percent of people in poor nations.

This problem is caused by a lack of good\nfood combined with infections and diseases such as diarrhea that sap the body of\nessential nutrients. About one-fifth of the population of poor nations, or about\n800 million individuals, are malnourished; looking just at children, in developing\nnations more than one-fourth of children under age 5, or about 150 million\naltogether, are underweight. Half of all these children live in only three nations:\nBangladesh, India, and Pakistan; almost half the children in these and other South\nAsian nations are underweight. Children who are malnourished are at much\ngreater risk for fat and muscle loss, brain damage, blindness, and death; perhaps\nyou have seen video footage of children in Africa or South Asia who are so starved\nthat they look like skeletons. Not surprisingly, child malnutrition contributes\nheavily to the extremely high rates of child mortality that we just examined and is estimated to be responsible for more than 5 million deaths of children annually\n(United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF], 2006; World Health Organization,\n2010).\nAdult Literacy\nMoving from the area of health, a final indicator of human development is adult\nliteracy, the percentage of people 15 and older who can read and write a simple\nsentence. Once again we see that people in poor and middle-income nations are\nfar worse off (see Figure 2.12 \u201cGlobal Poverty and Adult Literacy, 2008\u201d). In poor\nnations, only about 69 percent of adults 15 and older can read and write a simple\nsentence. The high rate of illiteracy in poor nations not only reflects their poverty\nbut also contributes to it, as people who cannot read and write are obviously at a\nhuge disadvantage in the labor market.\nFigure 2.12 Global Poverty and Adult Literacy, 2008\nSource: Data from World Bank.

Under this program,\nstates allocated federal money to provide cash payments to poor families with children. Although the program was heavily criticized for allegedly providing an\nincentive to poor mothers both to have more children and to not join the\nworkforce, research studies found little or no basis for this criticism. Still, many\npoliticians and much of the public accepted the criticism as true, and AFDC\nbecame so unpopular that it was replaced in 1997 by a new program, Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is still a major program today.\nTANF is more restrictive in many respects than AFDC was. In particular, it limits\nthe amount of time a poor family can receive federal funds to five years, and\nallows states to impose a shorter duration for funding, which many have done. In\naddition, it requires single parents in families receiving TANF funds to work at\nleast thirty hours a week (or twenty hours a week if they have a child under the\nage of 6) and two parents to work at least thirty-five hours per week combined. In\nmost states, going to school to obtain a degree does not count as the equivalent\nof working and thus does not make a parent eligible for TANF payments. Only\nshort-term programs or workshops to develop job skills qualify.\nDid welfare reform involving TANF work? Many adults formerly on AFDC found\njobs, TANF payments nationwide have been much lower than AFDC payments,\nand many fewer families receive TANF payments than used to receive AFDC\npayments. All these facts lead many observers to hail TANF as a successful\nprogram. However, sociologists and other scholars who study TANF families say\nthe numbers are misleading because poor families have in effect been excluded\nfrom TANF funding because of its strict requirements. The reduced payments and\nlower number of funded families indicate the failure of TANF, they say, not its\nsuccess.\nSeveral problems explain why TANF has had these unintended consequences.\nFirst, many families are poor for many more than five years, and the five-year\ntime limit under TANF means that they receive financial help for only some of the\nyears they live in poverty. Second, because the federal and state governments\nprovide relatively little financial aid for child care, many parents simply cannot\nafford to work, and if they don\u2019t work, they lose their TANF payments. Third, jobs\nare certainly difficult to find, especially if, as is typical, a poor parent has relatively\nlittle education and few job skills, and if parents cannot find a job, they again lose\ntheir TANF payments. Fourth, many parents cannot work because they have\nphysical or mental health problems or because they are taking care of a family\nmember or friend with a health problem; these parents, too, become ineligible\nfor TANF payments. Sociologist Lorna Rivera put a human face to these problems in a study of fifty\npoor women in Boston, Massachusetts. She lived among them, interviewed them\nindividually, and conducted focus groups. She found that TANF worsened the\nsituation of these women for the reasons just stated, and concluded that welfare\nreform left these and other poor women \u201cuneducated, underemployed,\nunderpaid, and unable to effectively move themselves and their families\nforward.\u201d\nIronically, some studies suggest that welfare reform impaired the health of black\nwomen for several reasons. Many ended up with jobs with long bus commutes\nand odd hours, leading to sleep deprivation and less time for medical visits. Many\nof these new workers also suddenly had to struggle to find affordable day care for\ntheir children. These problems are thought to have increased their stress levels\nand, in turn, harmed their health.\nThe research by social scientists on the effects of TANF reveals that the United\nStates took a large step backward when it passed welfare reform in the 1990s. Far\nfrom reducing poverty, welfare reform only worsened it. This research\nunderscores the need for the United States to develop better strategies for\nreducing poverty similar to those used by other Western democracies, as\ndiscussed in the Note 2.19 \u201cLessons from Other Societies\u201dbox in this chapter.\nSources: (Blitstein, 2009; Mink, 2008; Parrott & Sherman, 2008; Rivera, 2008)\nKey Takeaways:\nPeople in poor nations live in the worst conditions possible. Deadly diseases are\ncommon, and many children die before reaching adolescence.\nAccording to the modernization theory, rich nations became rich because their\npeoples possessed certain values, beliefs, and practices that helped them become\nwealthy. Conversely, poor nations remained poor because their peoples did not\npossess these values, beliefs, and practices.\nAccording to the dependency theory, poor nations have remained poor because\nthey have been exploited by rich nations and by multinational corporations.\nReferences\nBlitstein, R.

You saw evidence of the success of the war on poverty\nin Figure 2.1 \u201cUS Poverty, 1959\u20132010\u201d, which showed that the poverty rate\ndeclined from 22.2 percent in 1960 to a low of 11.1 percent in 1973 before\nfluctuating from year to year and then rising since 2000. The Note 2.19 \u201cLessons from Other Societies\u201d box showed that other democracies have much lower\npoverty rates than the United States because, as many scholars believe, they have\nbetter funded and more extensive programs to help their poor (Brady, 2009;\nRussell, 2011).\nThe lessons from the 1960s\u2019 war on poverty and the experience of other\ndemocracies are clear: It is very possible to reduce poverty if, and only if, a nation\nis willing to fund and implement appropriate programs and policies that address\nthe causes of poverty and that help the poor deal with the immediate and\nongoing difficulties they experience.\nA major reason that the US poverty rate reached its low in 1973 and never went\nlower during the past four decades is that the United States retreated from its\nwar on poverty by cutting back on the programs and services it had provided\nduring that good war (Soss, et. al., 2007). Another major reason is that changes in\nthe national economy during the past few decades have meant that well-paying\nmanufacturing jobs have been replaced by low-paying service jobs with fewer\nbenefits (Wilson, 2010). Yet this has also happened in other democracies, and\ntheir poverty rates remain lower than the US rate because, unlike the United\nStates, they have continued to try to help their poor rather than neglect them.\nWhy does the United States neglect its poor? Many scholars attribute this neglect\nto the fact that many citizens and politicians think the poor are poor because of\ntheir own failings. As summarized by sociologist Mark R. Rank (Rank, 2011), these\nfailings include \u201cnot working hard enough, failure to acquire sufficient skills, or\njust making bad decisions.\u201d By thus blaming the poor for their fate, citizens and\npoliticians think the poor do not deserve to have the US government help them,\nand so the government does not help, or at least not nearly as much as other\ndemocracies do. We have seen that the facts do not support the myth that the\npoor lack motivation to work, but that does not lessen the blame given the poor\nfor being poor.\nTo renew the US effort to help the poor, it is essential that the actual facts about\npoverty become better known so that a fundamental shift in thinking about\npoverty and the poor can occur. Rank (Rank, 2011) says that one aspect of this\nshift must include the recognition, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, that\n\u201cpoverty affects us all\u201d because it costs so many tax dollars to help the poor and\nbecause a majority of the public can expect to be poor or near poor at some point\nin their lives. A second aspect of this shift in thinking, adds Rank, is the recognition (following a blaming-the-system approach) that poverty stems much\nmore from the lack of opportunity, lack of jobs, declining government help for the\npoor, and other structural failings of American society than from individual\nfailings of the poor themselves. A third aspect of this shift in thinking, he\nconcludes, is that poverty must become seen as a \u201cmoral problem\u201d and as \u201can\ninjustice of a substantial magnitude\u201d (Rank, 2011). As he forcefully argues,\n\u201cSomething is seriously wrong when we find that, in a country with the most\nabundant resources in the world, there are children without enough to eat,\nfamilies who cannot afford health care, and people sleeping on the streets for\nlack of shelter\u201d (Rank, 2011). This situation, he says, must become seen as a\n\u201cmoral outrage\u201d (Rank, 2011).\nSociologist Joe Soss (Soss, 2011) argues that a change in thinking is not enough for\na renewed antipoverty effort to occur. What is needed, he says, is political protest\nand other political activity by the poor and on behalf of the poor. Soss notes that\n\u201cpolitical conflict and mass mobilization played key roles\u201d in providing the\nimpetus for social-welfare programs in the 1930s and 1960s in the United States,\nand he adds that the lower poverty rates of Western European democracies \u201care\nproducts of labor movements, unions, and parties that mobilized workers to\ndemand more adequate social supports.\u201d These twin histories lead Soss to\nconclude that the United States will not increase its antipoverty efforts unless a\nnew wave of political activity by and on behalf of the poor arises. As he argues,\n\u201cHistory suggests that major antipoverty victories can be achieved. But they won\u2019t\nbe achieved by good will and smart ideas alone. They\u2019ll be won politically, when\npeople\u2014in poor communities, in advocacy groups, in government, in the\nacademy, and elsewhere\u2014mobilize to advance antipoverty agendas in ways that\nmake politics as usual untenable.\u201d\nAntipoverty Programs and Policies To help reduce poverty, it is essential to help poor parents pay for child care.\nHerald Post \u2013 Family Child Care \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nIf a renewed antipoverty effort does occur for whatever reason, what types of\nprograms and policies show promise for effectively reducing poverty? Here a\nsociological vision is essential. It is easy to understand why the hungry\nschoolchildren described in the news story that began this chapter might be going\nwithout food during a very faltering national economy. Yet a sociological\nunderstanding of poverty emphasizes its structural basis in bad times and good\ntimes alike. Poverty is rooted in social and economic problems of the larger\nsociety rather than in the lack of willpower, laziness, or other moral failings of\npoor individuals themselves. Individuals born into poverty suffer from a lack of\nopportunity from their first months up through adulthood, and poverty becomes\na self-perpetuating, vicious cycle. To the extent a culture of poverty might exist, it\nis best seen as a logical and perhaps even inevitable outcome of, and adaptation\nto, the problem of being poor and not the primary force driving poverty itself.\nThis sort of understanding suggests that efforts to reduce poverty must address\nfirst and foremost the structural basis for poverty while not ignoring certain\nbeliefs and practices of the poor that also make a difference. An extensive\nliterature on poverty policy outlines many types of policies and programs that\nfollow this dual approach (Cancian & Danziger, 2009; Greenberg, et. al., 2007; Iceland, 2006; Lindsey, 2009; Moore et al., 2009; Rank, 2004). If these were fully\nadopted, funded, and implemented, as they are in many other democracies, they\nwould offer great promise for reducing poverty. As two poverty experts recently\nwrote, \u201cWe are optimistic that poverty can be reduced significantly in the long\nterm if the public and policymakers can muster the political will to pursue a range\nof promising antipoverty policies\u201d (M. Cancian & S. Danziger, 2009, p. 32).Cancian,\nM., & Danziger, S. H. (2009). Changing poverty, changing policies. New York, NY:\nRussell Sage Foundation. Although a full discussion of these policies is beyond the\nscope of this chapter, the following measures are commonly cited as holding\nstrong potential for reducing poverty, and they are found in varying degrees in\nother Western democracies:\n1. Adopt a national \u201cfull employment\u201d policy for the poor, involving federally\nfunded job training and public works programs, and increase the minimum\nwage so that individuals working full-time will earn enough to lift their families\nout of poverty.\n2. Increase federal aid for the working poor, including higher earned income\ncredits and child-care subsidies for those with children.\n3. Establish well-funded early childhood intervention programs, including home\nvisitations by trained professionals, for poor families.\n4. Provide poor families with enough income to enable them to pay for food and\nhousing.\n5. Increase the supply of affordable housing.\n6. Improve the schools that poor children attend and the schooling they receive\nand expand early childhood education programs for poor children.\n7. Provide better nutrition and health services for poor families with young\nchildren.\n8. Establish universal health insurance.\n9. Increase Pell Grants and other financial aid for higher education.\nGlobal Poverty\nYears of international aid to poor nations have helped them somewhat, but, as\nthis chapter has shown, their situation remains dire. International aid experts\nacknowledge that efforts to achieve economic growth in poor nations have largely\nfailed, but they disagree why this is so and what alternative strategies may prove more successful (Cohen & Easterly, 2009).Cohen, J., & Easterly, W. (Eds.).\n(2009). What works in development? Thinking big and thinking small. Washington,\nDC: Brookings Institution Press. One very promising trend has been a switch from\nmacro efforts focusing on infrastructure problems and on social institutions, such\nas the schools, to micro efforts, such as providing cash payments or small loans\ndirectly to poor people in poor nations (a practice called microfinancing) and\ngiving them bed nets to prevent mosquito bites (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011; Hanlon,\nBarrientos, & Hulme, 2010; Karlan & Appel, 2011).Banerjee, A.

The Economist, 394(8673), 75\u201376. Much more to help the world\u2019s poor\ncertainly needs to be done. In this regard, sociology\u2019s structural approach is in line\nwith dependency theory and suggests that global stratification results from the\nhistory of colonialism and from continuing exploitation today of poor nations\u2019\nresources by wealthy nations and multinational corporations. To the extent such\nexploitation exists, global poverty will lessen if and only if this exploitation\nlessens. A sociological approach also emphasizes the role that class, gender, and\nethnic inequality play in perpetuating global poverty. For global poverty to be\nreduced, gender and ethnic inequality must be reduced. Writers Nicholas D.\nKristof and Sheryl WuDunn (2010)Kristoff, N. D., & WuDunn, S. (2010). Half the\nsky: Turning oppression into opportunity for women worldwide. New York, NY:\nVintage Books emphasize the need to focus efforts to reduce global poverty of\nwomen. We have already seen one reason this emphasis makes sense: women\nare much worse off than men in poor nations in many ways, so helping them is\ncrucial for both economic and humanitarian reasons. An additional reason is\nespecially illuminating: When women in poor nations acquire extra money, they\ntypically spend it on food, clothing, and medicine, essentials for their families.\nHowever, when men in poor nations acquire extra money, they often spend it on\nalcohol, tobacco, and gambling. This gender difference might sound like a stereotype, but it does indicate that aid to women will help in many ways, while\naid to men might be less effective and often even wasted.\nKey Takeaways:\nAccording to some sociologists, a change in thinking about poverty and the poor\nand political action by and on behalf of the poor are necessary for a renewed\neffort to help poor Americans.\nPotentially successful antipoverty programs and policies to help the US poor\ninclude expanding their employment opportunities and providing them much\ngreater amounts of financial and other aid.\nTo help people in poor nations, gender and ethnic inequality must be addressed.\nReferences\nBrady, D.

Poverty statistics are misleading in at least two ways. First, the way that\npoverty is measured is inadequate for several reasons, and more accurate\nmeasures of poverty that have recently been developed suggest that poverty\nis higher than the official poverty measure indicates. Second, even if people\nlive slightly above the poverty line, they are still living in very difficult\ncircumstances and are having trouble making ends meet.\n2. Children, people of color, the South, and single-parent families headed by\nwomen have especially high poverty rates. Despite what many Americans\nthink, the most typical poor person is white, and most poor people who are\nable to work outside the home in fact do work.\n3. To explain social stratification and thus poverty, functionalist theory says that\nstratification is necessary and inevitable because of the need to encourage\npeople with the needed knowledge and skills to decide to pursue the careers\nthat are most important to society. Conflict theory says stratification exists\nbecause of discrimination against, and blocked opportunities for, the have-\nnots of society. Symbolic interactionist theory does not try to explain why\nstratification and poverty exist, but it does attempt to understand the\nexperience of being poor.\n4. The individualistic explanation attributes poverty to individual failings of poor\npeople themselves, while the structuralist explanation attributes poverty to\nlack of jobs and lack of opportunity in the larger society.\n5. Poverty has serious consequences in many respects. Among other problems,\npoor children are more likely to grow up to be poor, to have health problems,\nto commit street crime, and to have lower levels of formal education.\n6. The nations of the world differ dramatically in wealth and other resources,\nwith the poorest nations being found in Africa and parts of Asia.\n7. Global poverty has a devastating impact on the lives of hundreds of millions of\npeople throughout the world. Poor nations have much higher rates of\nmortality and disease and lower rates of literacy.\n8. Modernization theory attributes global poverty to the failure of poor nations\nto develop the necessary beliefs, values, and practices to achieve economic\ngrowth, while dependency theory attributes global poverty to the colonization\nand exploitation by European nations of nations in other parts of the world. 9. A sociological perspective suggests that poverty reduction in the United States\nand around the world can occur if the structural causes of poverty are\nsuccessfully addressed.\nWhat You Can Do\nTo help fight poverty and the effects of poverty, you may wish to do any of the\nfollowing:\n1. Contribute money to a local, state, or national organization that provides\nvarious kinds of aid to the poor.\n2. Volunteer at a local food pantry or homeless shelter.\n3. Start a canned food or used clothing drive on your campus.\n4. Write letters or send e-mails to local, state, and federal officials that\nencourage them to expand antipoverty programs.\nThis is a derivative of SOCIAL PROBLEMS: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by a publisher who has requested that they\nand the original author not receive attribution, which was originally released and is used under CC BY-NC-SA.

Research suggests that these\nachievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors\nthat exist among the families of these children. While the researchers\nacknowledge that programs aimed at reducing such socioeconomic discrepancies\nwould likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children from\ndifferent backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would\nbe difficult to achieve. Therefore, it is recommended that programs aimed at\nfostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged children may be the\nbest option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan\n& Magnuson, 2005).\nLow-income children perform significantly more poorly than their middle- and\nhigh-income peers on a number of educational variables: They have significantly\nlower standardized test scores, graduation rates, and college entrance rates, and\nthey have much higher school dropout rates. There have been attempts to correct\nthe achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the\nproblems start before the children even enter school?\nPsychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at\nearly language ability and progression of children in various income levels. In one\nlongitudinal study, they found that although all the parents in the study engaged\nand interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted\nwith their children differently than low-income parents. After analyzing 1,300\nhours of parent-child interactions, the researchers found that middle- and high-\nincome parents talk to their children significantly more, starting when the\nchildren are infants. By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the\nnumber of words known by their low-income counterparts, and they had heard\nan estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-income counterparts\n(Hart & Risley, 2003). And the gaps only become more pronounced. Before\nentering kindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement\ntests than their low-income peers (Lee & Burkam, 2002). There are solutions to this problem. At the University of Chicago, experts are\nworking with low-income families, visiting them at their homes, and encouraging\nthem to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis. Other experts\nare designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds\nare placed in the same classroom. In this research, low-income children made\nsignificant gains in their language development, likely as a result of attending the\nspecialized preschool (Schechter & Byeb, 2007). What other methods or\ninterventions could be used to decrease the achievement gap? What types of\nactivities could be implemented to help the children of your community or a\nneighboring community?\n\u00a9 Jun 25, 2018 OpenStax.

Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 7 \u2013 Sexual Orientation and Society\n7.1 Introduction to Gender, Sex, and Sexuality\nDerived from Introduction to Gender, Sex, and Sexuality by OpenStax\nSome children may learn at an early age that their gender does not correspond\nwith their sex. (Photo courtesy of Rajesh Kumar/flickr)\nIn 2009, the eighteen-year old South African athlete, Caster Semenya, won the\nwomen\u2019s 800-meter world championship in Track and Field. Her time of 1:55:45, a\nsurprising improvement from her 2008 time of 2:08:00, caused officials from the\nInternational Association of Athletics Foundation (IAAF) to question whether her\nwin was legitimate. If this questioning were based on suspicion of steroid use, the\ncase would be no different from that of Roger Clemens or Mark McGuire, or even\nTrack and Field Olympic gold medal winner Marion Jones. But the questioning and\neventual testing were based on allegations that Caster Semenya, no matter what\ngender identity she possessed, was biologically a male.\nYou may be thinking that distinguishing biological maleness from biological\nfemaleness is surely a simple matter\u2014just conduct some DNA or hormonal testing, throw in a physical examination, and you\u2019ll have the answer. But it is not\nthat simple. Both biologically male and biologically female people produce a\ncertain amount of testosterone, and different laboratories have different testing\nmethods, which makes it difficult to set a specific threshold for the amount of\nmale hormones produced by a female that renders her sex male. The\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) criteria for determining eligibility for sex-\nspecific events are not intended to determine biological sex. \u201cInstead these\nregulations are designed to identify circumstances in which a particular athlete\nwill not be eligible (by reason of hormonal characteristics) to participate in the\n2012 Olympic Games\" in the female category (International Olympic Committee\n2012).\nTo provide further context, during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, eight female\nathletes with XY chromosomes underwent testing and were ultimately confirmed\nas eligible to compete as women (Maugh 2009). To date, no males have\nundergone this sort of testing. Doesn\u2019t that imply that when women perform\nbetter than expected, they are \u201ctoo masculine,\u201d but when men perform well they\nare simply superior athletes? Can you imagine Usain Bolt, the world\u2019s fastest man,\nbeing examined by doctors to prove he was biologically male based solely on his\nappearance and athletic ability?\nCan you explain how sex, sexuality, and gender are different from each other?\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the differences between sex and gender, along\nwith issues like gender identity and sexuality. We will also explore various\ntheoretical perspectives on the subjects of gender and sexuality, including the\nsocial construction of sexuality and queer theory.\nReferences\nInternational Olympic Committee, Medical and Scientific Department. 2012. \u201cIOC Regulations on Female\nHyperandrogenism.\u201d Retrieved December 8, 2014\n(http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2012-06-22-IOC-Regulations-\non-Female-Hyperandrogenism-eng.pdf).\nMaugh, Thomas H., III. 2009. \u201cRow Over South African Athlete Highlights Ambiguities of Gender.\u201d Los Angeles\nTimes.

(Photo courtesy of FaceMePLS/flickr)\nWhen filling out a document such as a job application or school registration form\nyou are often asked to provide your name, address, phone number, birth date,\nand sex or gender. But have you ever been asked to provide your sex and your\ngender? Like most people, you may not have realized that sex and gender are not\nthe same. However, sociologists and most other social scientists view them as\nconceptually distinct. Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between\nmales and females, including both primary sex characteristics (the reproductive\nsystem) and secondary characteristics such as height and\nmuscularity. Gender refers to behaviors, personal traits, and social positions that\nsociety attributes to being female or male.\nA person\u2019s sex, as determined by his or her biology, does not always correspond\nwith his or her gender. Therefore, the terms sexand gender are not\ninterchangeable. A baby boy who is born with male genitalia will be identified as\nmale. As he grows, however, he may identify with the feminine aspects of his\nculture. Since the term sex refers to biological or physical distinctions,\ncharacteristics of sex will not vary significantly between different human societies. Generally, persons of the female sex, regardless of culture, will eventually\nmenstruate and develop breasts that can lactate. Characteristics of gender, on\nthe other hand, may vary greatly between different societies. For example, in U.S.\nculture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress\nor skirt. However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or\nskirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) are considered masculine.\nThe kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his\nculture.\nThe dichotomous view of gender (the notion that someone is either male or\nfemale) is specific to certain cultures and is not universal. In some cultures gender\nis viewed as fluid. In the past, some anthropologists used the term berdache to\nrefer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed and lived as a\ndifferent gender. The practice has been noted among certain Native American\ntribes (Jacobs, Thomas, and Lang 1997). Samoan culture accepts what Samoans\nrefer to as a \u201cthird gender.\u201d Fa\u2019afafine, which translates as \u201cthe way of the\nwoman,\u201d is a term used to describe individuals who are born biologically male but\nembody both masculine and feminine traits. Fa\u2019afafines are considered an\nimportant part of Samoan culture. Individuals from other cultures may mislabel\nthem as homosexuals because fa\u2019afafines have a varied sexual life that may\ninclude men and women (Poasa 1992).\nTHE LEGALESE OF SEX AND GENDER\nThe terms sex and gender have not always been differentiated in the English\nlanguage. It was not until the 1950s that U.S. and British psychologists and other\nprofessionals working with intersex and transsexual patients formally began\ndistinguishing between sex and gender. Since then, psychological and\nphysiological professionals have increasingly used the term gender (Moi 2005). By\nthe end of the twenty-first century, expanding the proper usage of the\nterm gender to everyday language became more challenging\u2014particularly where\nlegal language is concerned. In an effort to clarify usage of the\nterms sex and gender, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 1994\nbriefing, \u201cThe word gender has acquired the new and useful connotation of\ncultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics)\ndistinctive to the sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female\nand masculine is to male\u201d (J.E.B. v. Alabama, 144 S. Ct. 1436 [1994]). Supreme\nCourt Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a different take, however. Viewing the words as synonymous, she freely swapped them in her briefings so as to avoid\nhaving the word \u201csex\u201d pop up too often. It is thought that her secretary supported\nthis practice by suggestions to Ginsberg that \u201cthose nine men\u201d (the other\nSupreme Court justices), \u201chear that word and their first association is not the way\nyou want them to be thinking\u201d (Case 1995). This anecdote reveals that both sex\nand gender are actually socially defined variables whose definitions change over\ntime.\nSexual Orientation\nA person\u2019s sexual orientation is his or her physical, mental, emotional, and sexual\nattraction to a particular sex (male or female). Sexual orientation is typically\ndivided into four categories: heterosexuality, the attraction to individuals of the\nother sex; homosexuality, the attraction to individuals of the same\nsex; bisexuality, the attraction to individuals of either sex; and asexuality, no\nattraction to either sex. Heterosexuals and homosexuals may also be referred to\ninformally as \u201cstraight\u201d and \u201cgay,\u201d respectively. The United States is\na heteronormative society, meaning it assumes sexual orientation is biologically\ndetermined and unambiguous. Consider that homosexuals are often asked,\n\u201cWhen did you know you were gay?\u201d but heterosexuals are rarely asked, \u201cWhen\ndid you know that you were straight?\u201d (Ryle 2011).\nAccording to current scientific understanding, individuals are usually aware of\ntheir sexual orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence\n(American Psychological Association 2008). They do not have to participate in\nsexual activity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and physical attractions;\npeople can be celibate and still recognize their sexual orientation. Homosexual\nwomen (also referred to as lesbians), homosexual men (also referred to as gays),\nand bisexuals of both genders may have very different experiences of discovering\nand accepting their sexual orientation. At the point of puberty, some may be able\nto announce their sexual orientations, while others may be unready or unwilling\nto make their homosexuality or bisexuality known since it goes against U.S.\nsociety\u2019s historical norms (APA 2008).\nAlfred Kinsey was among the first to conceptualize sexuality as a continuum\nrather than a strict dichotomy of gay or straight. He created a six-point rating\nscale that ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. See\nthe figure below. In his 1948 work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Kinsey writes, \u201cMales do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and\nhomosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats \u2026 The living\nworld is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects\u201d (Kinsey 1948).\nThe Kinsey scale indicates that sexuality can be measured by more than just\nheterosexuality and homosexuality.\nLater scholarship by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick expanded on Kinsey\u2019s notions. She\ncoined the term \u201chomosocial\u201d to oppose \u201chomosexual,\u201d describing nonsexual\nsame-sex relations. Sedgwick recognized that in U.S. culture, males are subject to\na clear divide between the two sides of this continuum, whereas females enjoy\nmore fluidity. This can be illustrated by the way women in the United States can\nexpress homosocial feelings (nonsexual regard for people of the same sex)\nthrough hugging, handholding, and physical closeness. In contrast, U.S. males\nrefrain from these expressions since they violate the heteronormative\nexpectation that male sexual attraction should be exclusively for females.\nResearch suggests that it is easier for women violate these norms than men,\nbecause men are subject to more social disapproval for being physically close to\nother men (Sedgwick 1985). There is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual\nholds a heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual orientation. Research has been\nconducted to study the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and\ncultural influences on sexual orientation, but there has been no evidence that\nlinks sexual orientation to one factor (APA 2008). Research, however, does\npresent evidence showing that homosexuals and bisexuals are treated differently\nthan heterosexuals in schools, the workplace, and the military. In 2011, for\nexample, Sears and Mallory used General Social Survey data from 2008 to show\nthat 27 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) respondents reported experiencing\nsexual orientation-based discrimination during the five years prior to the survey.\nFurther, 38 percent of openly LGB people experienced discrimination during the\nsame time.\nMuch of this discrimination is based on stereotypes and misinformation. Some is\nbased on heterosexism, which Herek (1990) suggests is both an ideology and a\nset of institutional practices that privilege heterosexuals and heterosexuality over\nother sexual orientations. Much like racism and sexism, heterosexism is a\nsystematic disadvantage embedded in our social institutions, offering power to\nthose who conform to hetereosexual orientation while simultaneously\ndisadvantaging those who do not. Homophobia, an extreme or irrational aversion\nto homosexuals, accounts for further stereotyping and discrimination. Major\npolicies to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation have not come into\neffect until the last few years. In 2011, President Obama overturned \u201cdon\u2019t ask,\ndon\u2019t tell,\u201d a controversial policy that required homosexuals in the US military to\nkeep their sexuality undisclosed. The Employee Non-Discrimination Act, which\nensures workplace equality regardless of sexual orientation, is still pending full\ngovernment approval. Organizations such as GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance\nAgainst Defamation) advocate for homosexual rights and encourage governments\nand citizens to recognize the presence of sexual discrimination and work to\nprevent it. Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and\nLBGTQ, which stands for \u201cLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender\u201d (and \u201cQueer\u201d or\n\u201cQuestioning\u201d when the Q is added).\nSociologically, it is clear that gay and lesbian couples are negatively affected in\nstates where they are denied the legal right to marriage. In 1996, The Defense of\nMarriage Act (DOMA) was passed, explicitly limiting the definition of \u201cmarriage\u201d\nto a union between one man and one woman. It also allowed individual states to\nchoose whether or not they recognized same-sex marriages performed in other states. Imagine that you married an opposite-sex partner under similar\nconditions\u2014if you went on a cross-country vacation the validity of your marriage\nwould change every time you crossed state lines. In another blow to same-sex\nmarriage advocates, in November 2008 California passed Proposition 8, a state\nlaw that limited marriage to unions of opposite-sex partners.\nOver time, advocates for same-sex marriage have won several court cases, laying\nthe groundwork for legalized same-sex marriage across the United States,\nincluding the June 2013 decision to overturn part of DOMA in Windsor v. United\nStates, and the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of Hollingsworth v. Perry, affirming the\nAugust 2010 ruling that found California\u2019s Proposition 8 unconstitutional. In\nOctober 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear appeals to rulings against\nsame-sex marriage bans, which effectively legalized same-sex marriage in Indiana,\nOklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, Colorado, North Carolina, West Virginia,\nand Wyoming (Freedom to Marry, Inc. 2014). Same-sex marriage is now legal\nacross most of the United States. The next few years will determine whether the\nright to same-sex marriage is affirmed, depending on whether the U.S. Supreme\nCourt takes a judicial step to guarantee the freedom to marry as a civil right.\nGender Roles\nAs we grow, we learn how to behave from those around us. In this socialization\nprocess, children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their\nbiological sex. The term gender role refers to society\u2019s concept of how men and\nwomen are expected to look and how they should behave. These roles are based\non norms, or standards, created by society. In U.S. culture, masculine roles are\nusually associated with strength, aggression, and dominance, while feminine roles\nare usually associated with passivity, nurturing, and subordination. Role learning\nstarts with socialization at birth. Even today, our society is quick to outfit male\ninfants in blue and girls in pink, even applying these color-coded gender labels\nwhile a baby is in the womb.\nOne way children learn gender roles is through play. Parents typically supply boys\nwith trucks, toy guns, and superhero paraphernalia, which are active toys that\npromote motor skills, aggression, and solitary play. Daughters are often given\ndolls and dress-up apparel that foster nurturing, social proximity, and role play.\nStudies have shown that children will most likely choose to play with \u201cgender\nappropriate\u201d toys (or same-gender toys) even when cross-gender toys are available because parents give children positive feedback (in the form of praise,\ninvolvement, and physical closeness) for gender normative behavior (Caldera,\nHuston, and O\u2019Brien 1998).\nFathers tend to be more involved when their sons engage in gender-appropriate\nactivities such as sports. (Photo courtesy of Shawn Lea/flickr)\nThe drive to adhere to masculine and feminine gender roles continues later in life.\nMen tend to outnumber women in professions such as law enforcement, the\nmilitary, and politics. Women tend to outnumber men in care-related occupations\nsuch as childcare, healthcare (even though the term \u201cdoctor\u201d still conjures the\nimage of a man), and social work. These occupational roles are examples of\ntypical U.S. male and female behavior, derived from our culture\u2019s traditions.\nAdherence to them demonstrates fulfillment of social expectations but not\nnecessarily personal preference (Diamond 2002).\nGender Identity\nU.S. society allows for some level of flexibility when it comes to acting out gender\nroles. To a certain extent, men can assume some feminine roles and women can\nassume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity. Gender identity is a person\u2019s deeply held internal perception of his or\nher gender.\nIndividuals who identify with the role that is the different from their biological sex\nare called transgender. Transgender is not the same as homosexual, and many\nhomosexual males view both their sex and gender as male. Transgender females\nare males who have such a strong emotional and psychological connection to the\nfeminine aspects of society that they identify their gender as female. The parallel\nconnection to masculinity exists for transgender males. It is difficult to determine\nthe prevalence of transgenderism in society. However, it is estimated that two to\nfive percent of the U.S. population is transgender (Transgender Law and Policy\nInstitute 2007).\nTransgender individuals who attempt to alter their bodies through medical\ninterventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy\u2014so that their physical being\nis better aligned with gender identity\u2014are called transsexuals. They may also be\nknown as male-to-female (MTF) or female-to-male (FTM). Not all transgender\nindividuals choose to alter their bodies: many will maintain their original anatomy\nbut may present themselves to society as another gender. This is typically done by\nadopting the dress, hairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristic typically\nassigned to another gender. It is important to note that people who cross-dress,\nor wear clothing that is traditionally assigned to a gender different from their\nbiological sex, are not necessarily transgender. Cross-dressing is typically a form\nof self-expression, entertainment, or personal style, and it is not necessarily an\nexpression against one\u2019s assigned gender (APA 2008).\nThere is no single, conclusive explanation for why people are transgender.\nTransgender expressions and experiences are so diverse that it is difficult to\nidentify their origin. Some hypotheses suggest biological factors such as genetics\nor prenatal hormone levels as well as social and cultural factors such as childhood\nand adulthood experiences. Most experts believe that all of these factors\ncontribute to a person\u2019s gender identity (APA 2008).\nAfter years of controversy over the treatment of sex and gender in the American\nPsychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental\nDisorders (Drescher 2010), the most recent edition, DSM-5, responds to\nallegations that the term \u201cGender Identity Disorder\u201d is stigmatizing by replacing it\nwith \u201cGender Dysphoria.\u201d Gender Identity Disorder as a diagnostic category stigmatized the patient by implying there was something \u201cdisordered\u201d about\nthem. Gender Dysphoria, on the other hand, removes some of that stigma by\ntaking the word \"disorder\" out while maintaining a category that will protect\npatient access to care, including hormone therapy and gender reassignment\nsurgery. In the DSM-5, Gender Dysphoria is a condition of people whose gender\nat birth is contrary to the one they identify with. For a person to be diagnosed\nwith Gender Dysphoria, there must be a marked difference between the\nindividual\u2019s expressed/experienced gender and the gender others would assign\nhim or her, and it must continue for at least six months. In children, the desire to\nbe of the other gender must be present and verbalized. This diagnosis is now a\nseparate category from sexual dysfunction and paraphilia, another important part\nof removing stigma from the diagnosis (APA 2013).\nChanging the clinical description may contribute to a larger acceptance of\ntransgender people in society. Studies show that people who identify as\ntransgender are twice as likely to experience assault or discrimination as\nnontransgender individuals; they are also one and a half times more likely to\nexperience intimidation (National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs 2010;\nGiovanniello 2013). Organizations such as the National Coalition of Anti-Violence\nPrograms and Global Action for Trans Equality work to prevent, respond to, and\nend all types of violence against transgender, transsexual, and homosexual\nindividuals. These organizations hope that by educating the public about gender\nidentity and empowering transgender and transsexual individuals, this violence\nwill end.\nREAL-LIFE FREAKY FRIDAY\nWhat if you had to live as a sex you were not biologically born to? If you are a\nman, imagine that you were forced to wear frilly dresses, dainty shoes, and\nmakeup to special occasions, and you were expected to enjoy romantic comedies\nand daytime talk shows. If you are a woman, imagine that you were forced to\nwear shapeless clothing, put only minimal effort into your personal appearance,\nnot show emotion, and watch countless hours of sporting events and sports-\nrelated commentary. It would be pretty uncomfortable, right? Well, maybe not.\nMany people enjoy participating in activities, whether they are associated with\ntheir biological sex or not, and would not mind if some of the cultural\nexpectations for men and women were loosened. Now, imagine that when you look at your body in the mirror, you feel\ndisconnected. You feel your genitals are shameful and dirty, and you feel as\nthough you are trapped in someone else\u2019s body with no chance of escape. As you\nget older, you hate the way your body is changing, and, therefore, you hate\nyourself. These elements of disconnect and shame are important to understand\nwhen discussing transgender individuals. Fortunately, sociological studies pave\nthe way for a deeper and more empirically grounded understanding of the\ntransgender experience.\nChaz Bono is the transgender son of Cher and Sonny Bono. While he was born\nfemale, he considers himself male. Being transgender is not about clothing or\nhairstyles; it is about self-perception. (Photo courtesy of Greg Hernandez/flickr)\nSummary\nThe terms \u201csex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d refer to two different identifiers. Sex denotes\nbiological characteristics differentiating males and females, while gender denotes\nsocial and cultural characteristics of masculine and feminine behavior. Sex and gender are not always synchronous. Individuals who strongly identify with the\nopposing gender are considered transgender.\nGlossary\nDOMA\nDefense of Marriage Act, a 1996 U.S. law explicitly limiting the definition of\n\u201cmarriage\u201d to a union between one man and one woman and allowing each\nindividual state to recognize or deny same-sex marriages performed in\nother states\ngender dysphoria\na condition listed in the DSM-5 in which people whose gender at birth is\ncontrary to the one they identify with.

(Photo courtesy of Sport Suburban/flickr)\nGender and Socialization The phrase \u201cboys will be boys\u201d is often used to justify behavior such as pushing,\nshoving, or other forms of aggression from young boys. The phrase implies that\nsuch behavior is unchangeable and something that is part of a boy\u2019s nature.\nAggressive behavior, when it does not inflict significant harm, is often accepted\nfrom boys and men because it is congruent with the cultural script for\nmasculinity. The \u201cscript\u201d written by society is in some ways similar to a script\nwritten by a playwright. Just as a playwright expects actors to adhere to a\nprescribed script, society expects women and men to behave according to the\nexpectations of their respective gender roles. Scripts are generally learned\nthrough a process known as socialization, which teaches people to behave\naccording to social norms.\nSocialization\nChildren learn at a young age that there are distinct expectations for boys and\ngirls. Cross-cultural studies reveal that children are aware of gender roles by age\ntwo or three. At four or five, most children are firmly entrenched in culturally\nappropriate gender roles (Kane 1996). Children acquire these roles through\nsocialization, a process in which people learn to behave in a particular way as\ndictated by societal values, beliefs, and attitudes. For example, society often\nviews riding a motorcycle as a masculine activity and, therefore, considers it to be\npart of the male gender role. Attitudes such as this are typically based on\nstereotypes, oversimplified notions about members of a group. Gender\nstereotyping involves overgeneralizing about the attitudes, traits, or behavior\npatterns of women or men. For example, women may be thought of as too timid\nor weak to ride a motorcycle. Although our society may have a stereotype that associates motorcycles with\nmen, female bikers demonstrate that a woman\u2019s place extends far beyond the\nkitchen in the modern United States. (Photo courtesy of Robert Couse-\nBaker/flickr)\nGender stereotypes form the basis of sexism. Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs\nthat value one sex over another. It varies in its level of severity. In parts of the\nworld where women are strongly undervalued, young girls may not be given the\nsame access to nutrition, healthcare, and education as boys. Further, they will\ngrow up believing they deserve to be treated differently from boys (UNICEF 2011;\nThorne 1993). While it is illegal in the United States when practiced as\ndiscrimination, unequal treatment of women continues to pervade social life. It\nshould be noted that discrimination based on sex occurs at both the micro- and\nmacro-levels. Many sociologists focus on discrimination that is built into the social\nstructure; this type of discrimination is known as institutional discrimination\n(Pincus 2008).\nGender socialization occurs through four major agents of socialization: family,\neducation, peer groups, and mass media. Each agent reinforces gender roles by\ncreating and maintaining normative expectations for gender-specific behavior.\nExposure also occurs through secondary agents such as religion and the\nworkplace. Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads men and women\ninto a false sense that they are acting naturally rather than following a socially\nconstructed role. Family is the first agent of socialization. There is considerable evidence that\nparents socialize sons and daughters differently. Generally speaking, girls are\ngiven more latitude to step outside of their prescribed gender role (Coltrane and\nAdams 2004; Kimmel 2000; Raffaelli and Ontai 2004). However, differential\nsocialization typically results in greater privileges afforded to sons. For instance,\nboys are allowed more autonomy and independence at an earlier age than\ndaughters. They may be given fewer restrictions on appropriate clothing, dating\nhabits, or curfew. Sons are also often free from performing domestic duties such\nas cleaning or cooking and other household tasks that are considered feminine.\nDaughters are limited by their expectation to be passive and nurturing, generally\nobedient, and to assume many of the domestic responsibilities.\nEven when parents set gender equality as a goal, there may be underlying\nindications of inequality. For example, boys may be asked to take out the garbage\nor perform other tasks that require strength or toughness, while girls may be\nasked to fold laundry or perform duties that require neatness and care. It has\nbeen found that fathers are firmer in their expectations for gender conformity\nthan are mothers, and their expectations are stronger for sons than they are for\ndaughters (Kimmel 2000). This is true in many types of activities, including\npreference for toys, play styles, discipline, chores, and personal achievements. As\na result, boys tend to be particularly attuned to their father\u2019s disapproval when\nengaging in an activity that might be considered feminine, like dancing or singing\n(Coltraine and Adams 2008). Parental socialization and normative expectations\nalso vary along lines of social class, race, and ethnicity. African American families,\nfor instance, are more likely than Caucasians to model an egalitarian role\nstructure for their children (Staples and Boulin Johnson 2004).\nThe reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes continues once a child reaches\nschool age. Until very recently, schools were rather explicit in their efforts to\nstratify boys and girls. The first step toward stratification was segregation. Girls\nwere encouraged to take home economics or humanities courses and boys to\ntake math and science.\nStudies suggest that gender socialization still occurs in schools today, perhaps in\nless obvious forms (Lips 2004). Teachers may not even realize they are acting in\nways that reproduce gender differentiated behavior patterns. Yet any time they\nask students to arrange their seats or line up according to gender, teachers may\nbe asserting that boys and girls should be treated differently (Thorne 1993). Even in levels as low as kindergarten, schools subtly convey messages to girls\nindicating that they are less intelligent or less important than boys. For example,\nin a study of teacher responses to male and female students, data indicated that\nteachers praised male students far more than female students. Teachers\ninterrupted girls more often and gave boys more opportunities to expand on their\nideas (Sadker and Sadker 1994). Further, in social as well as academic situations,\nteachers have traditionally treated boys and girls in opposite ways, reinforcing a\nsense of competition rather than collaboration (Thorne 1993). Boys are also\npermitted a greater degree of freedom to break rules or commit minor acts of\ndeviance, whereas girls are expected to follow rules carefully and adopt an\nobedient role (Ready 2001).\nMimicking the actions of significant others is the first step in the development of a\nseparate sense of self (Mead 1934). Like adults, children become agents who\nactively facilitate and apply normative gender expectations to those around them.\nWhen children do not conform to the appropriate gender role, they may face\nnegative sanctions such as being criticized or marginalized by their peers. Though\nmany of these sanctions are informal, they can be quite severe. For example, a\ngirl who wishes to take karate class instead of dance lessons may be called a\n\u201ctomboy\u201d and face difficulty gaining acceptance from both male and female peer\ngroups (Ready 2001). Boys, especially, are subject to intense ridicule for gender\nnonconformity (Coltrane and Adams 2004; Kimmel 2000).\nMass media serves as another significant agent of gender socialization. In\ntelevision and movies, women tend to have less significant roles and are often\nportrayed as wives or mothers. When women are given a lead role, it often falls\ninto one of two extremes: a wholesome, saint-like figure or a malevolent,\nhypersexual figure (Etaugh and Bridges 2003). This same inequality is pervasive in\nchildren\u2019s movies (Smith 2008). Research indicates that in the ten top-grossing G-\nrated movies released between 1991 and 2013, nine out of ten characters were\nmale (Smith 2008).\nTelevision commercials and other forms of advertising also reinforce inequality\nand gender-based stereotypes. Women are almost exclusively present in ads\npromoting cooking, cleaning, or childcare-related products (Davis 1993). Think\nabout the last time you saw a man star in a dishwasher or laundry detergent\ncommercial. In general, women are underrepresented in roles that involve\nleadership, intelligence, or a balanced psyche. Of particular concern is the depiction of women in ways that are dehumanizing, especially in music videos.\nEven in mainstream advertising, however, themes intermingling violence and\nsexuality are quite common (Kilbourne 2000).\nSocial Stratification and Inequality\nStratification refers to a system in which groups of people experience unequal\naccess to basic, yet highly valuable, social resources. The United States is\ncharacterized by gender stratification (as well as stratification of race, income,\noccupation, and the like). Evidence of gender stratification is especially keen\nwithin the economic realm. Despite making up nearly half (49.8 percent) of\npayroll employment, men vastly outnumber women in authoritative, powerful,\nand, therefore, high-earning jobs (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). Even when a\nwoman\u2019s employment status is equal to a man\u2019s, she will generally make only 77\ncents for every dollar made by her male counterpart (U.S. Census Bureau 2010).\nWomen in the paid labor force also still do the majority of the unpaid work at\nhome. On an average day, 84 percent of women (compared to 67 percent of men)\nspend time doing household management activities (U.S. Census Bureau 2011).\nThis double duty keeps working women in a subordinate role in the family\nstructure (Hochschild and Machung 1989).\nGender stratification through the division of labor is not exclusive to the United\nStates. According to George Murdock\u2019s classic work, Outline of World\nCultures (1954), all societies classify work by gender. When a pattern appears in\nall societies, it is called a cultural universal. While the phenomenon of assigning\nwork by gender is universal, its specifics are not. The same task is not assigned to\neither men or women worldwide. But the way each task\u2019s associated gender is\nvalued is notable. In Murdock\u2019s examination of the division of labor among 324\nsocieties around the world, he found that in nearly all cases the jobs assigned to\nmen were given greater prestige (Murdock and White 1968). Even if the job types\nwere very similar and the differences slight, men\u2019s work was still considered more\nvital.\nThere is a long history of gender stratification in the United States. When looking\nto the past, it would appear that society has made great strides in terms of\nabolishing some of the most blatant forms of gender inequality (see timeline\nbelow) but underlying effects of male dominance still permeate many aspects of\nsociety. \uf0b7 Before 1809\u2014Women could not execute a will\n\uf0b7 Before 1840\u2014Women were not allowed to own or control property\n\uf0b7 Before 1920\u2014Women were not permitted to vote\n\uf0b7 Before 1963\u2014Employers could legally pay a woman less than a man for the\nsame work\n\uf0b7 Before 1973\u2014Women did not have the right to a safe and legal abortion\n(Imbornoni 2009)\nIn some cultures, women do all of the household chores with no help from men,\nas doing housework is a sign of weakness, considered by society as a feminine\ntrait. (Photo courtesy of Evil Erin/flickr)\nTheoretical Perspectives on Gender\nSociological theories help sociologists to develop questions and interpret data.\nFor example, a sociologist studying why middle-school girls are more likely than\ntheir male counterparts to fall behind grade-level expectations in math and\nscience might use a feminist perspective to frame her research. Another scholar\nmight proceed from the conflict perspective to investigate why women are\nunderrepresented in political office, and an interactionist might examine how the\nsymbols of femininity interact with symbols of political authority to affect how\nwomen in Congress are treated by their male counterparts in meetings. Structural Functionalism\nStructural functionalism has provided one of the most important perspectives of\nsociological research in the twentieth century and has been a major influence on\nresearch in the social sciences, including gender studies. Viewing the family as the\nmost integral component of society, assumptions about gender roles within\nmarriage assume a prominent place in this perspective.\nFunctionalists argue that gender roles were established well before the pre-\nindustrial era when men typically took care of responsibilities outside of the\nhome, such as hunting, and women typically took care of the domestic\nresponsibilities in or around the home. These roles were considered functional\nbecause women were often limited by the physical restraints of pregnancy and\nnursing and unable to leave the home for long periods of time. Once established,\nthese roles were passed on to subsequent generations since they served as an\neffective means of keeping the family system functioning properly.\nWhen changes occurred in the social and economic climate of the United States\nduring World War II, changes in the family structure also occurred. Many women\nhad to assume the role of breadwinner (or modern hunter-gatherer) alongside\ntheir domestic role in order to stabilize a rapidly changing society. When the men\nreturned from war and wanted to reclaim their jobs, society fell back into a state\nof imbalance, as many women did not want to forfeit their wage-earning\npositions (Hawke 2007).\nConflict Theory\nAccording to conflict theory, society is a struggle for dominance among social\ngroups (like women versus men) that compete for scarce resources. When\nsociologists examine gender from this perspective, we can view men as the\ndominant group and women as the subordinate group. According to conflict\ntheory, social problems are created when dominant groups exploit or oppress\nsubordinate groups. Consider the Women\u2019s Suffrage Movement or the debate\nover women\u2019s \u201cright to choose\u201d their reproductive futures. It is difficult for\nwomen to rise above men, as dominant group members create the rules for\nsuccess and opportunity in society (Farrington and Chertok 1993). Friedrich Engels, a German sociologist, studied family structure and gender roles.\nEngels suggested that the same owner-worker relationship seen in the labor force\nis also seen in the household, with women assuming the role of the proletariat.\nThis is due to women\u2019s dependence on men for the attainment of wages, which is\neven worse for women who are entirely dependent upon their spouses for\neconomic support. Contemporary conflict theorists suggest that when women\nbecome wage earners, they can gain power in the family structure and create\nmore democratic arrangements in the home, although they may still carry the\nmajority of the domestic burden, as noted earlier (Rismanand and Johnson-\nSumerford 1998).\nFeminist Theory\nFeminist theory is a type of conflict theory that examines inequalities in gender-\nrelated issues. It uses the conflict approach to examine the maintenance of\ngender roles and inequalities. Radical feminism, in particular, considers the role of\nthe family in perpetuating male dominance. In patriarchal societies, men\u2019s\ncontributions are seen as more valuable than those of women. Patriarchal\nperspectives and arrangements are widespread and taken for granted. As a result,\nwomen\u2019s viewpoints tend to be silenced or marginalized to the point of being\ndiscredited or considered invalid.\nSanday\u2019s study of the Indonesian Minangkabau (2004) revealed that in societies\nsome consider to be matriarchies (where women comprise the dominant group),\nwomen and men tend to work cooperatively rather than competitively regardless\nof whether a job is considered feminine by U.S. standards. The men, however, do\nnot experience the sense of bifurcated consciousness under this social structure\nthat modern U.S. females encounter (Sanday 2004).\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism aims to understand human behavior by analyzing the\ncritical role of symbols in human interaction. This is certainly relevant to the\ndiscussion of masculinity and femininity. Imagine that you walk into a bank hoping\nto get a small loan for school, a home, or a small business venture. If you meet\nwith a male loan officer, you may state your case logically by listing all the hard\nnumbers that make you a qualified applicant as a means of appealing to the\nanalytical characteristics associated with masculinity. If you meet with a female loan officer, you may make an emotional appeal by stating your good intentions\nas a means of appealing to the caring characteristics associated with femininity.\nBecause the meanings attached to symbols are socially created and not natural,\nand fluid, not static, we act and react to symbols based on the current assigned\nmeaning. The word gay, for example, once meant \u201ccheerful,\u201d but by the 1960s it\ncarried the primary meaning of \u201chomosexual.\u201d In transition, it was even known to\nmean \u201ccareless\u201d or \u201cbright and showing\u201d (Oxford American Dictionary 2010).\nFurthermore, the word gay (as it refers to a homosexual), carried a somewhat\nnegative and unfavorable meaning fifty years ago, but it has since gained more\nneutral and even positive connotations. When people perform tasks or possess\ncharacteristics based on the gender role assigned to them, they are said to\nbe doing gender. This notion is based on the work of West and Zimmerman\n(1987). Whether we are expressing our masculinity or femininity, West and\nZimmerman argue, we are always \"doing gender.\" Thus, gender is something we\ndo or perform, not something we are.\nIn other words, both gender and sexuality are socially constructed. The social\nconstruction of sexuality refers to the way in which socially created definitions\nabout the cultural appropriateness of sex-linked behavior shape the way people\nsee and experience sexuality. This is in marked contrast to theories of sex, gender,\nand sexuality that link male and female behavior to biological determinism, or\nthe belief that men and women behave differently due to differences in their\nbiology.\nBEING MALE, BEING FEMALE, AND BEING HEALTHY\nIn 1971, Broverman and Broverman conducted a groundbreaking study on the\ntraits mental health workers ascribed to males and females. When asked to name\nthe characteristics of a female, the list featured words such as unaggressive,\ngentle, emotional, tactful, less logical, not ambitious, dependent, passive, and\nneat. The list of male characteristics featured words such as aggressive, rough,\nunemotional, blunt, logical, direct, active, and sloppy (Seem and Clark 2006).\nLater, when asked to describe the characteristics of a healthy person (not gender\nspecific), the list was nearly identical to that of a male.\nThis study uncovered the general assumption that being female is associated with\nbeing somewhat unhealthy or not of sound mind. This concept seems extremely dated, but in 2006, Seem and Clark replicated the study and found similar results.\nAgain, the characteristics associated with a healthy male were very similar to that\nof a healthy (genderless) adult. The list of characteristics associated with being\nfemale broadened somewhat but did not show significant change from the\noriginal study (Seem and Clark 2006). This interpretation of feminine\ncharacteristic may help us one day better understand gender disparities in certain\nillnesses, such as why one in eight women can be expected to develop clinical\ndepression in her lifetime (National Institute of Mental Health 1999). Perhaps\nthese diagnoses are not just a reflection of women\u2019s health, but also a reflection\nof society\u2019s labeling of female characteristics, or the result of institutionalized\nsexism.\nSummary\nChildren become aware of gender roles in their earliest years, and they come to\nunderstand and perform these roles through socialization, which occurs through\nfour major agents: family, education, peer groups, and mass media. Socialization\ninto narrowly prescribed gender roles results in the stratification of males and\nfemales. Each sociological perspective offers a valuable view for understanding\nhow and why gender inequality occurs in our society.\nGlossary\nbiological determinism\nthe belief that men and women behave differently due to inherent sex\ndifferences related to their biology\ndoing gender\nthe performance of tasks based upon the gender assigned to us by society\nand, in turn, ourselves\nsexism\nthe prejudiced belief that one sex should be valued over another\nsocial construction of sexuality socially created definitions about the cultural appropriateness of sex-linked\nbehavior which shape how people see and experience sexuality\nFurther Research\nLearn more about gender at the Kinsey Institute\nhere: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2EKinsey\nReferences\nBox Office Mojo. n.d. \"Domestic Grosses by MPAA Rating.\" Retrieved December 29, 2014\n(http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/mpaa.htm?page=G&p=.htm).\nCampbell, Patricia, and Jennifer Storo. 1994. \"Girls Are \u2026 Boys Are \u2026 : Myths, Stereotypes & Gender Differences.\u201d\nOffice of Educational Research and Improvement U.S. Department of Education.

Recent trends include the\nfinding that married couples have sex more frequently than do singles and that 27\npercent of married couples in their 30s have sex at least twice a week (NSSHB\n2010). (Photo courtesy of epSos.de/flickr)\nSexual Attitudes and Practices In the area of sexuality, sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and\npractices, not on physiology or anatomy. Sexualityis viewed as a person\u2019s capacity\nfor sexual feelings. Studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly\ninteresting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal.\nThroughout time and place, the vast majority of human beings have participated\nin sexual relationships (Broude 2003). Each society, however, interprets sexuality\nand sexual activity in different ways. Many societies around the world have\ndifferent attitudes about premarital sex, the age of sexual consent,\nhomosexuality, masturbation, and other sexual behaviors (Widmer, Treas, and\nNewcomb 1998). At the same time, sociologists have learned that certain norms\nare shared among most societies. The incest taboo is present in every society,\nthough which relative is deemed unacceptable for sex varies widely from culture\nto culture. For example, sometimes the relatives of the father are considered\nacceptable sexual partners for a woman while the relatives of the mother are not.\nLikewise, societies generally have norms that reinforce their accepted social\nsystem of sexuality.\nWhat is considered \u201cnormal\u201d in terms of sexual behavior is based on the mores\nand values of the society. Societies that value monogamy, for example, would\nlikely oppose extramarital sex. Individuals are socialized to sexual attitudes by\ntheir family, education system, peers, media, and religion. Historically, religion\nhas been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in most societies, but in more\nrecent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the strongest\ninfluences, particularly among U.S. teens (Potard, Courtois, and Rusch 2008). Let\nus take a closer look at sexual attitudes in the United States and around the\nworld.\nSexuality around the World\nCross-national research on sexual attitudes in industrialized nations reveals that\nnormative standards differ across the world. For example, several studies have\nshown that Scandinavian students are more tolerant of premarital sex than are\nU.S. students (Grose 2007). A study of 37 countries reported that non-Western\nsocieties\u2014like China, Iran, and India\u2014valued chastity highly in a potential mate,\nwhile Western European countries\u2014such as France, the Netherlands, and\nSweden\u2014placed little value on prior sexual experiences (Buss 1989). Chastity in Terms of Potential MatesSource: Buss 1989\nCountry Males (Mean) Females (Mean)\nChina 2.54 2.61\nIndia 2.44 2.17\nIndonesia 2.06 1.98\nIran 2.67 2.23\nIsrael (Palestinian) 2.24 0.96\nSweden 0.25 0.28\nNorway 0.31 0.30\nFinland 0.27 0.29\nThe Netherlands 0.29 0.29\nEven among Western cultures, attitudes can differ. For example, according to a\n33,590-person survey across 24 countries, 89 percent of Swedes responded that\nthere is nothing wrong with premarital sex, while only 42 percent of Irish\nresponded this way. From the same study, 93 percent of Filipinos responded that\nsex before age 16 is always wrong or almost always wrong, while only 75 percent\nof Russians responded this way (Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb 1998). Sexual\nattitudes can also vary within a country. For instance, 45 percent of Spaniards\nresponded that homosexuality is always wrong, while 42 percent responded that\nit is never wrong; only 13 percent responded somewhere in the middle (Widmer,\nTreas, and Newcomb 1998). Of industrialized nations, Sweden is thought to be the most liberal when it comes\nto attitudes about sex, including sexual practices and sexual openness. The\ncountry has very few regulations on sexual images in the media, and sex\neducation, which starts around age six, is a compulsory part of Swedish school\ncurricula. Sweden\u2019s permissive approach to sex has helped the country avoid\nsome of the major social problems associated with sex. For example, rates of teen\npregnancy and sexually transmitted disease are among the world\u2019s lowest (Grose\n2007). It would appear that Sweden is a model for the benefits of sexual freedom\nand frankness. However, implementing Swedish ideals and policies regarding\nsexuality in other, more politically conservative, nations would likely be met with\nresistance.\nSexuality in the United States\nThe United States prides itself on being the land of the \u201cfree,\u201d but it is rather\nrestrictive when it comes to its citizens\u2019 general attitudes about sex compared to\nother industrialized nations. In an international survey, 29 percent of U.S.\nrespondents stated that premarital sex is always wrong, while the average among\nthe 24 countries surveyed was 17 percent. Similar discrepancies were found in\nquestions about the condemnation of sex before the age of 16, extramarital sex,\nand homosexuality, with total disapproval of these acts being 12, 13, and 11\npercent higher, respectively, in the United States, than the study\u2019s average\n(Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb 1998).\nU.S. culture is particularly restrictive in its attitudes about sex when it comes to\nwomen and sexuality. It is widely believed that men are more sexual than are\nwomen. In fact, there is a popular notion that men think about sex every seven\nseconds. Research, however, suggests that men think about sex an average of 19\ntimes per day, compared to 10 times per day for women (Fisher, Moore, and\nPittenger 2011).\nBelief that men have\u2014or have the right to\u2014more sexual urges than women\ncreates a double standard. Ira Reiss, a pioneer researcher in the field of sexual\nstudies, defined the double standard as prohibiting premarital sexual intercourse\nfor women but allowing it for men (Reiss 1960). This standard has evolved into\nallowing women to engage in premarital sex only within committed love\nrelationships, but allowing men to engage in sexual relationships with as many\npartners as they wish without condition (Milhausen and Herold 1999). Due to this double standard, a woman is likely to have fewer sexual partners in her life time\nthan a man. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nsurvey, the average thirty-five-year-old woman has had three opposite-sex sexual\npartners while the average thirty-five-year-old man has had twice as many\n(Centers for Disease Control 2011).\nThe future of a society\u2019s sexual attitudes may be somewhat predicted by the\nvalues and beliefs that a country\u2019s youth expresses about sex and sexuality. Data\nfrom the most recent National Survey of Family Growth reveals that 70 percent of\nboys and 78 percent of girls ages fifteen to nineteen said they \u201cagree\u201d or\n\u201cstrongly agree\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s okay for an unmarried female to have a child\" (National\nSurvey of Family Growth 2013). In a separate survey, 65 percent of teens stated\nthat they \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d or \u201csomewhat agreed\u201d that although waiting until\nmarriage for sex is a nice idea, it\u2019s not realistic (NBC News 2005). This does not\nmean that today\u2019s youth have given up traditional sexual values such as\nmonogamy. Nearly all college men (98.9 percent) and women (99.2 percent) who\nparticipated in a 2002 study on sexual attitudes stated they wished to settle down\nwith one mutually exclusive sexual partner at some point in their lives, ideally\nwithin the next five years (Pedersen et al. 2002).\nSex Education\nOne of the biggest controversies regarding sexual attitudes is sexual education in\nU.S. classrooms. Unlike in Sweden, sex education is not required in all public\nschool curricula in the United States. The heart of the controversy is not about\nwhether sex education should be taught in school (studies have shown that only\nseven percent of U.S. adults oppose sex education in schools); it is about\nthe type of sex education that should be taught.\nMuch of the debate is over the issue of abstinence. In a 2005 survey, 15 percent\nof U.S. respondents believed that schools should teach abstinence exclusively and\nshould not provide contraceptives or information on how to obtain them. Forty-\nsix percent believed schools should institute an abstinence-plus approach, which\nteaches children that abstinence is best but still gives information about\nprotected sex. Thirty-six percent believed teaching about abstinence is not\nimportant and that sex education should focus on sexual safety and responsibility\n(NPR 2010). Research suggests that while government officials may still be debating about the\ncontent of sexual education in public schools, the majority of U.S. adults are not.\nThose who advocated abstinence-only programs may be the proverbial squeaky\nwheel when it comes to this controversy, since they represent only 15 percent of\nparents. Fifty-five percent of respondents feel giving teens information about sex\nand how to obtain and use protection will not encourage them to have sexual\nrelations earlier than they would under an abstinence program. About 77 percent\nthink such a curriculum would make teens more likely to practice safe sex now\nand in the future (NPR 2004).\nSweden, whose comprehensive sex education program in its public schools\neducates participants about safe sex, can serve as a model for this approach. The\nteenage birthrate in Sweden is 7 per 1,000 births, compared with 49 per 1,000\nbirths in the United States. Among fifteen to nineteen year olds, reported cases of\ngonorrhea in Sweden are nearly 600 times lower than in the United States (Grose\n2007).\nSociological Perspectives on Sex and Sexuality\nSociologists representing all three major theoretical perspectives study the role\nsexuality plays in social life today. Scholars recognize that sexuality continues to\nbe an important and defining social location and that the manner in which\nsexuality is constructed has a significant effect on perceptions, interactions, and\noutcomes.\nStructural Functionalism\nWhen it comes to sexuality, functionalists stress the importance of regulating\nsexual behavior to ensure marital cohesion and family stability. Since\nfunctionalists identify the family unit as the most integral component in society,\nthey maintain a strict focus on it at all times and argue in favor of social\narrangements that promote and ensure family preservation.\nFunctionalists such as Talcott Parsons (1955) have long argued that the regulation\nof sexual activity is an important function of the family. Social norms surrounding\nfamily life have, traditionally, encouraged sexual activity within the family unit\n(marriage) and have discouraged activity outside of it (premarital and extramarital\nsex). From a functionalist point of view, the purpose of encouraging sexual activity in the confines of marriage is to intensify the bond between spouses and to\nensure that procreation occurs within a stable, legally recognized relationship.\nThis structure gives offspring the best possible chance for appropriate\nsocialization and the provision of basic resources.\nFrom a functionalist standpoint, homosexuality cannot be promoted on a large-\nscale as an acceptable substitute for heterosexuality. If this occurred, procreation\nwould eventually cease. Thus, homosexuality, if occurring predominantly within\nthe population, is dysfunctional to society. This criticism does not take into\naccount the increasing legal acceptance of same-sex marriage, or the rise in gay\nand lesbian couples who choose to bear and raise children through a variety of\navailable resources.\nConflict Theory\nFrom a conflict theory perspective, sexuality is another area in which power\ndifferentials are present and where dominant groups actively work to promote\ntheir worldview as well as their economic interests. Recently, we have seen the\ndebate over the legalization of gay marriage intensify nationwide.\nFor conflict theorists, there are two key dimensions to the debate over same-sex\nmarriage\u2014one ideological and the other economic. Dominant groups (in this\ninstance, heterosexuals) wish for their worldview\u2014which embraces traditional\nmarriage and the nuclear family\u2014to win out over what they see as the intrusion\nof a secular, individually driven worldview. On the other hand, many gay and\nlesbian activists argue that legal marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be\ndenied based on sexual orientation and that, historically, there already exists a\nprecedent for changes to marriage laws: the 1960s legalization of formerly\nforbidden interracial marriages is one example.\nFrom an economic perspective, activists in favor of same-sex marriage point out\nthat legal marriage brings with it certain entitlements, many of which are financial\nin nature, like Social Security benefits and medical insurance (Solmonese 2008).\nDenial of these benefits to gay couples is wrong, they argue. Conflict theory\nsuggests that as long as heterosexuals and homosexuals struggle over these social\nand financial resources, there will be some degree of conflict. Symbolic Interactionism\nInteractionists focus on the meanings associated with sexuality and with sexual\norientation. Since femininity is devalued in U.S. society, those who adopt such\ntraits are subject to ridicule; this is especially true for boys or men. Just as\nmasculinity is the symbolic norm, so too has heterosexuality come to signify\nnormalcy. Prior to 1973, the American Psychological Association (APA) defined\nhomosexuality as an abnormal or deviant disorder. Interactionist labeling theory\nrecognizes the impact this has made. Before 1973, the APA was powerful in\nshaping social attitudes toward homosexuality by defining it as pathological.\nToday, the APA cites no association between sexual orientation and\npsychopathology and sees homosexuality as a normal aspect of human sexuality\n(APA 2008).\nInteractionists are also interested in how discussions of homosexuals often focus\nalmost exclusively on the sex lives of gays and lesbians; homosexuals, especially\nmen, may be assumed to be hypersexual and, in some cases, deviant.\nInteractionism might also focus on the slurs used to describe homosexuals. Labels\nsuch as \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cfag\u201d are often used to demean homosexual men by\nfeminizing them. This subsequently affects how homosexuals perceive\nthemselves. Recall Cooley\u2019s \u201clooking-glass self,\u201d which suggests that self develops\nas a result of our interpretation and evaluation of the responses of others (Cooley\n1902). Constant exposure to derogatory labels, jokes, and pervasive homophobia\nwould lead to a negative self-image, or worse, self-hate. The CDC reports that\nhomosexual youths who experience high levels of social rejection are six times\nmore likely to have high levels of depression and eight times more likely to have\nattempted suicide (CDC 2011).\nQueer Theory\nQueer Theory is an interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies\nWestern society\u2019s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and\nquestions the manner in which we have been taught to think about sexual\norientation. According to Jagose (1996), Queer [Theory] focuses on mismatches\nbetween anatomical sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, not just division\ninto male/female or homosexual/hetereosexual. By calling their discipline\n\u201cqueer,\u201d scholars reject the effects of labeling; instead, they embraced the word\n\u201cqueer\u201d and reclaimed it for their own purposes. The perspective highlights the need for a more flexible and fluid conceptualization of sexuality\u2014one that allows\nfor change, negotiation, and freedom. The current schema used to classify\nindividuals as either \u201cheterosexual\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d pits one orientation against\nthe other. This mirrors other oppressive schemas in our culture, especially those\nsurrounding gender and race (black versus white, male versus female).\nQueer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued against U.S. society\u2019s monolithic\ndefinition of sexuality and its reduction to a single factor: the sex of someone\u2019s\ndesired partner. Sedgwick identified dozens of other ways in which people\u2019s\nsexualities were different, such as:\n\uf0b7 Even identical genital acts mean very different things to different people.\n\uf0b7 Sexuality makes up a large share of the self-perceived identity of some\npeople, a small share of others\u2019.\n\uf0b7 Some people spend a lot of time thinking about sex, others little.\n\uf0b7 Some people like to have a lot of sex, others little or none.\n\uf0b7 Many people have their richest mental/emotional involvement with sexual\nacts that they don\u2019t do, or don\u2019t even want to do.\n\uf0b7 Some people like spontaneous sexual scenes, others like highly scripted\nones, others like spontaneous-sounding ones that are nonetheless totally\npredictable.\n\uf0b7 Some people, homo- hetero- and bisexual, experience their sexuality as\ndeeply embedded in a matrix of gender meanings and gender differentials.\nOthers of each sexuality do not (Sedgwick 1990).\nThus, theorists utilizing queer theory strive to question the ways society perceives\nand experiences sex, gender, and sexuality, opening the door to new scholarly\nunderstanding.\nThroughout this chapter we have examined the complexities of gender, sex, and\nsexuality. Differentiating between sex, gender, and sexual orientation is an\nimportant first step to a deeper understanding and critical analysis of these\nissues. Understanding the sociology of sex, gender, and sexuality will help to build\nawareness of the inequalities experienced by subordinate categories such as\nwomen, homosexuals, and transgender individuals.\nSummary When studying sex and sexuality, sociologists focus their attention on sexual\nattitudes and practices, not on physiology or anatomy. Norms regarding gender\nand sexuality vary across cultures. In general, the United States tends to be fairly\nconservative in its sexual attitudes. As a result, homosexuals continue to face\nopposition and discrimination in most major social institutions.\nGlossary\ndouble standard\nthe concept that prohibits premarital sexual intercourse for women but\nallows it for men\nqueer theory\nan interdisciplinary approach to sexuality studies that identifies Western\nsociety\u2019s rigid splitting of gender into male and female roles and questions\nits appropriateness\nsexuality\na person\u2019s capacity for sexual feelings\nFurther Research\nFor more information about sexual attitudes and practices in countries around\nthe world, see the entire \u201cAttitudes Toward Nonmarital Sex in 24 Countries\u201d\narticle from the Journal of Sex\nResearch at http://openstaxcollege.org/l/journal_of_sex_research.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA). 2008. \u201cAnswers to Your Questions: For a Better Understanding of Sexual\nOrientation and Homosexuality.\u201d Washington, DC.

A\nfederal jury in Houston, Texas, awarded $3.2 million to three women, all county\nemployees, who had accused a former judge of sexual harassment. Their suit said\nthe judge had \u201chugged, groped, kissed and fondled them and had emailed them\nsexually explicit photographs,\u201d according to a news report, and that county\nofficials had ignored the judge\u2019s behavior despite their knowledge of it. The judge\nhad resigned his position three years earlier after pleading no contest to several\ncharges of misdemeanor assault related to his physical contact with several\nwomen. His only criminal penalty was to pay a fine of less than $3,000.\nAfter the verdict was announced, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said, \u201cI am very proud of\nthis verdict, and hope it sends a message to all public officials that they are not\nabove the law and should think twice before abusing power.\u201d One of the plaintiffs\nrecalled what it was like to have been harassed by the judge: \u201cI felt alone, I felt\nsmall, I felt like he was the most powerful man in Brazoria County. I felt like there\nwas nothing I could do. I felt scared.\u201d At the same time, she was encouraged by\nthe jury\u2019s verdict and the fact that other women had come forward to speak out\nabout the judge\u2019s behavior: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through it alone. You can stand\nup for yourself.\u201d\nSources: Cisneros, 2011; Tolson, 2011 Thanks to the contemporary women\u2019s rights movement that began in the late\n1960s, much has changed for women and men in American society during the\npast half-century. Still, as this news story about sexual harassment reminds us,\nmuch more still needs to be done. Despite tremendous advancements for women\nsince the 1960s, gender inequality persists and manifests itself in many ways. This\nchapter examines the major forms of gender inequality and the reasons for its\nexistence, and it outlines various steps our society should take to help ensure\nequality between the sexes. Our discussion begins with a critical look at the\nconcepts of sex and gender.\nReferences\nCisneros, C. (2011, July 15). $3.2M settlement awarded in sexual harassment case. KTRK-TV.

Understanding Sex and Gender\nLearning Objectives:\nDefine sex, gender, femininity, and masculinity.\nCritically assess the evidence on biology, culture and socialization, and gender.\nDiscuss agents of gender socialization.\nAlthough the terms sex and gender are sometimes used interchangeably and do\ncomplement each other, they nonetheless refer to different aspects of what it\nmeans to be a woman or man in any society.\nSex refers to the anatomical and other biological differences between females\nand males that are determined at the moment of conception and develop in the\nwomb and throughout childhood and adolescence. Females, of course, have two\nX chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.\nFrom this basic genetic difference spring other biological differences. The first to\nappear are the genitals that boys and girls develop in the womb and that the\ndoctor (or midwife) and parents look for when a baby is born (assuming the\nbaby\u2019s sex is not already known from ultrasound or other techniques) so that the\nmomentous announcement, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d can be made. The\ngenitalia are called primary sex characteristics, while the other differences that\ndevelop during puberty are called secondary sex characteristicsand stem from\nhormonal differences between the two sexes. Boys generally acquire deeper\nvoices, more body hair, and more muscles from their flowing testosterone. Girls\ndevelop breasts and wider hips and begin menstruating as nature prepares them\nfor possible pregnancy and childbirth. For better or worse, these basic biological\ndifferences between the sexes affect many people\u2019s perceptions of what it means\nto be female or male, as we next discuss. Babies are born with anatomical and other biological differences that are\ndetermined at the moment of conception. These biological differences define the\nbaby\u2019s sex.\nAbby Bischoff \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nGender as a Social Construction\nIf sex is a biological concept, then gender is a social concept. It refers to the social\nand cultural differences a society assigns to people based on their (biological) sex.\nA related concept, gender roles, refers to a society\u2019s expectations of people\u2019s\nbehavior and attitudes based on whether they are females or males. Understood\nin this way, gender, like race as discussed in Chapter 3 \u201cRacial and Ethnic\nInequality\u201d, is a social construction. How we think and behave as females and\nmales is not etched in stone by our biology but rather is a result of how society\nexpects us to think and behave based on what sex we are. As we grow up, we\nlearn these expectations as we develop our gender identity, or our beliefs about\nourselves as females or males.\nThese expectations are called femininity and masculinity. Femininity refers to the\ncultural expectations we have of girls and women, while masculinity refers to the expectations we have of boys and men. A familiar nursery rhyme nicely\nsummarizes these two sets of traits:\nWhat are little boys made of?\nSnips and snails,\nAnd puppy dog tails,\nThat\u2019s what little boys are made of.\nWhat are little girls made of?\nSugar and spice,\nAnd everything nice,\nThat\u2019s what little girls are made of.\nAs this rhyme suggests, our traditional notions of femininity and masculinity\nindicate that we think females and males are fundamentally different from each\nother. In effect, we think of them as two sides of the same coin of being human.\nWhat we traditionally mean by femininity is captured in the adjectives, both\npositive and negative, we traditionally ascribe to women: gentle, sensitive,\nnurturing, delicate, graceful, cooperative, decorative, dependent, emotional,\npassive, and weak. Thus when we say that a girl or woman is very feminine, we\nhave some combination of these traits in mind: she is soft, dainty, pretty, and\neven a bit flighty. What we traditionally mean by masculinity is captured in the\nadjectives, again both positive and negative, our society traditionally ascribes to\nmen: strong, assertive, brave, active, independent, intelligent, competitive,\ninsensitive, unemotional, and aggressive. When we say that a boy or man is very\nmasculine, we have some combination of these traits in mind: he is tough, strong,\nand assertive.\nThese traits might sound like stereotypes of females and males in today\u2019s society,\nand to some extent they are, but differences between women and men in\nattitudes and behavior do in fact exist (Aulette & Wittner, 2011). For example, women cry more often than men do. Men are more physically violent than\nwomen. Women take care of children more than men do. Women smile more\noften than men. Men curse and spit more often than women. When women talk\nwith each other, they are more likely to talk about their personal lives than men\nare when they talk with each other. The two sexes even differ when they hold a\ncigarette (not that anyone should smoke!). When a woman holds a cigarette, she\nusually has the palm of her cigarette-holding hand facing upward; when a man\nholds a cigarette, he usually has his palm facing downward.\nThe Development of Gender Differences\nWhat accounts for differences in female and male behavior and attitudes? Do the\nbiological differences between the sexes account for these other differences? Or\ndo these latter differences stem, as most sociologists think, from cultural\nexpectations and from differences in the ways in which the sexes are socialized?\nThese are critical questions, for they ask whether the differences between boys\nand girls and women and men stem more from biology or from society. If we\nthink behavioral and other differences between the sexes are due primarily to\ntheir respective biological makeups, we imply that these differences are inevitable\nor nearly so and that any attempt to change them goes against biology and will\nlikely fail.\nFor example, consider the obvious biological fact that women bear and nurse\nchildren and men do not. Couple this with the common view that women are also\nmore gentle and nurturing than men, and we end up with a \u201cbiological recipe\u201d for\nwomen to be the primary caretakers of children. Many people think this means\nwomen are therefore much better suited than men to take care of children once\nthey are born, and that the family might be harmed if mothers work outside the\nhome or if fathers are the primary caretakers. Figure 4.1 \u201cBelief That Women\nShould Stay at Home\u201d shows that more than one-third of the public agrees that\n\u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the\nhome and the woman takes care of the home and family.\u201d To the extent this\nbelief exists, women may not want to work outside the home or, if they choose to\ndo so, they then face difficulties from employers, family, and friends. Conversely,\nmen may not even think about wanting to stay at home and may themselves face\ndifficulties from employees, family, and friends if they want to do so. A belief in a\nstrong biological basis for differences between women and men implies, then, that there is little we can or should do to change these differences. It implies that\n\u201canatomy is destiny,\u201d and destiny is, of course, by definition inevitable.\nFigure 4.1 Belief That Women Should Stay at Home\nAgreement or disagreement with the statement that \u201cit is much better for\neveryone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman\ntakes care of the home and family.\u201d\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

Retrieved\nfrom http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nThis implication makes it essential to understand the extent to which gender\ndifferences do, in fact, stem from biological differences between the sexes or,\ninstead, stem from cultural and social influences. If biology is paramount, then\ngender differences are perhaps inevitable and the status quo will remain. If\nculture and social influences matter much more than biology, then gender differences can change and the status quo may give way. With this backdrop in\nmind, let\u2019s turn to the biological evidence for behavioral and other differences\nbetween the sexes and then examine the evidence for their social and cultural\nroots.\nBiology and Gender\nSeveral biological explanations for gender roles exist, and we discuss two of the\nmost important ones here. One explanation is from the field of evolutionary\npsychology (Buss, 2012) and argues an evolutionary basis for traditional gender\nroles.\nScholars advocating this view reason as follows (Thornhill & Gangestad, 2008). In\nprehistoric societies, two major social roles existed (1) hunting or gathering food\nto relieve hunger, and (2) bearing and nursing children. Because only women\ncould perform the latter role, they were also the primary caretakers for children\nfor several years after birth. And because women were frequently pregnant, their\nroles as mothers confined them to the home. Meanwhile, men were better suited\nthan women for hunting because they were stronger and quicker than women. In\nprehistoric societies, then, biology was indeed destiny: For biological reasons,\nmen in effect worked outside the home (hunted), while women stayed at home\nwith their children.\nEvolutionary reasons also explain why men are more violent than women. In\nprehistoric times, men who were more willing to commit violence against and\neven kill other men would \u201cwin out\u201d in the competition for female mates. They\nthus were more likely than less violent men to produce offspring, who would then\ncarry these males\u2019 genetic violent tendencies.\nIf the human race evolved along these lines, evolutionary psychologists continue,\nnatural selection favored those societies where men were stronger, braver, and\nmore aggressive and where women were more fertile and nurturing. Such traits\nover the millennia became fairly instinctual, meaning that men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nbiological natures evolved differently. Men became, by nature, more assertive,\ndaring, and violent than women, and women became, by nature, more gentle,\nnurturing, and maternal than men. To the extent this is true, these scholars add,\ntraditional gender roles for women and men make sense from an evolutionary\nstandpoint, and attempts to change them go against the sexes\u2019 biological natures.\nThis in turn implies that existing gender inequality must continue because it is rooted in biology. The title of a book presenting the evolutionary psychology\nargument summarizes this implication: \u201cBiology at Work: Rethinking Sexual\nEquality\u201d (Browne, 2002).\nAccording to some evolutionary psychologists, today\u2019s gender differences in\nstrength and physical aggression are ultimately rooted in certain evolutionary\nprocesses that spanned millennia.\nVladimir Pustovit \u2013 Couple \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nCritics challenge the evolutionary explanation on several grounds (Begley, 2009;\nFine, 2011). First, much greater gender variation in behavior and attitudes existed\nin prehistoric times than the evolutionary explanation assumes. Second, even if\nbiological differences did influence gender roles in prehistoric times, these\ndifferences are largely irrelevant in modern societies, in which, for example,\nphysical strength is not necessary for survival. Third, human environments\nthroughout the millennia have simply been too diverse to permit the simple,\nstraightforward biological development that the evolutionary explanation\nassumes. Fourth, evolutionary arguments implicitly justify existing gender\ninequality by implying the need to confine women and men to their traditional\nroles. Recent anthropological evidence also challenges the evolutionary argument that\nmen\u2019s tendency to commit violence was biologically transmitted. This evidence\ninstead finds that violent men have trouble finding female mates who would want\nthem and that the female mates they find and the children they produce are\noften killed by rivals to the men (Begley, 2009).\nA second biological explanation for traditional gender roles attributes males\u2019\nhigher levels of aggression to their higher levels of testosterone (Mazur, 2009).\nSeveral studies find that males with higher levels of testosterone tend to have\nhigher levels of aggression. However, this correlation does not necessarily mean\nthat their testosterone increased their violence; as has been found in various\nanimal species, it is also possible that their violence increased their testosterone.\nBecause studies of human males cannot for ethical and practical reasons\nmanipulate their testosterone levels, the exact meaning of the results from these\ntestosterone-aggression studies must remain unclear, according to a report by the\nNational Academy of Sciences (Miczek, Mirsky, Carey, DeBold, & Raine, 1994).\nAnother line of research on the biological basis for sex differences in aggression\ninvolves children, including some as young as ages 1 or 2, in various situations\n(Card, Stucky, Sawalani, & Little, 2008). They might be playing with each other,\ninteracting with adults, or writing down solutions to hypothetical scenarios given\nto them by a researcher. In most of these studies, boys are more physically\naggressive in thought or deed than girls, even at a very young age. Other studies\nare more experimental in nature. In one type of study, a toddler will be playing\nwith a toy, only to have it removed by an adult. Boys typically tend to look angry\nand try to grab the toy back, while girls tend to just sit there and whimper.\nBecause these gender differences in aggression are found at very young ages,\nresearchers often say they must have some biological basis. However, critics of\nthis line of research counter that even young children have already been\nsocialized along gender lines (Begley, 2009; Fine, 2011), a point to which we\nreturn later in the chapter. To the extent this is true, gender differences in\nchildren\u2019s aggression may reflect socialization rather than biology.\nIn sum, biological evidence for gender differences certainly exists, but its\ninterpretation remains very controversial. It must be weighed against the\nevidence, to which we next turn, of cultural variations in the experience of gender\nand of socialization differences by gender. One thing is clear: To the extent we\naccept biological explanations for gender, we imply that existing gender differences and gender inequality must continue to exist. As sociologist Linda L.\nLindsey (2011, p. 52) notes, \u201cBiological arguments are consistently drawn upon to\njustify gender inequality and the continued oppression of women.\u201d In contrast,\ncultural and social explanations of gender differences and gender inequality\npromise some hope for change. Let\u2019s examine the evidence for these\nexplanations.\nCulture and Gender\nSome of the most compelling evidence against a strong biological determination\nof gender roles comes from anthropologists, whose work on preindustrial\nsocieties demonstrates some striking gender variation from one culture to\nanother. This variation underscores the impact of culture on how females and\nmales think and behave.\nExtensive evidence of this impact comes from anthropologist George Murdock\n(1937), who created the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample of almost two hundred\npreindustrial societies studied by anthropologists. Murdock found that some tasks\nin these societies, such as hunting and trapping, are almost always done by men,\nwhile other tasks, such as cooking and fetching water, are almost always done by\nwomen. These patterns provide evidence for the evolutionary argument\npresented earlier, as they probably stem from the biological differences between\nthe sexes. Even so, there were at least some societies in which women hunted\nand in which men cooked and fetched water. Anthropological research finds a good deal of variation in gender roles for certain\ntasks, including planting crops, milking, and generating fires. Other tasks, such as\nhunting and trapping, are typically done by men while tasks such as cooking and\nfetching water are typically done by women.\nWorld Bank Photo Collection \u2013 Somo Samo village well \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nMore important, Murdock found much greater gender variation in several of the\nother tasks he studied, including planting crops, milking, and generating fires.\nMen primarily performed these tasks in some societies, women primarily\nperformed them in other societies, and in still other societies both sexes\nperformed them equally. Murdock\u2019s findings illustrate how gender roles differ\nfrom one culture to another and imply they are not biologically determined.\nAnthropologists continue to investigate cultural differences in gender. Some of\ntheir most interesting findings concern gender and sexuality (Brettell & Sargent,\n2009). Although all societies distinguish \u201cfemaleness\u201d and \u201cmaleness,\u201d additional\ngender categories exist in some societies. The Native Americans known as the\nMohave, for example, recognize four genders: a woman, a woman who acts like a\nman, a man, and a man who acts like a woman. In some societies, a third,\nintermediary gender category is recognized. Anthropologists call this category\nthe berdache, who is usually a man who takes on a woman\u2019s role. This\nintermediary category combines aspects of both femininity and masculinity of the society in which it is found and is thus considered an androgynous gender.\nAlthough some people in this category are born as intersexed individuals\n(formerly known as hermaphrodites), meaning they have genitalia of both sexes,\nmany are born biologically as one sex or the other but adopt an androgynous\nidentity.\nAnthropologists have found another androgynous gender composed of women\nwarriors in thirty-three Native American groups in North America. Walter L.\nWilliams (1997) calls these women \u201camazons\u201d and notes that they dress like men\nand sometimes even marry women. In some tribes girls exhibit such \u201cmasculine\u201d\ncharacteristics from childhood, while in others they may be recruited into\n\u201camazonhood.\u201d In the Kaska Indians, for example, a married couple with too\nmany daughters would select one to \u201cbe like a man.\u201d When she was about 5 years\nof age, her parents would begin to dress her like a boy and have her do male\ntasks. Eventually she would grow up to become a hunter.\nThe androgynous genders found by anthropologists remind us that gender is a\nsocial construction and not just a biological fact. If culture does affect gender\nroles, socialization is the process through which culture has this effect. What we\nexperience as girls and boys strongly influences how we develop as women and\nmen in terms of behavior and attitudes. To illustrate this important dimension of\ngender, let\u2019s turn to the evidence on socialization.\nSocialization and Gender\nSocialization is the process whereby individuals learn the culture of their society.\nSeveral agents of socialization exist, including the family, peers, schools, the mass\nmedia, and religion, and all these institutions help to socialize people into their\ngender roles and also help them develop their gender identity (Andersen &\nHysock, 2011).\nThe Family\nSocialization into gender roles begins in infancy, as almost from the moment of\nbirth parents begin to socialize their children as boys or girls without even\nknowing it (Begley, 2009; Eliot, 2011). Parents commonly describe their infant\ndaughters as pretty, soft, and delicate and their infant sons as strong, active, and\nalert, even though neutral observers find no such gender differences among\ninfants when they do not know the infants\u2019 sex. From infancy on, parents play with and otherwise interact with their daughters and sons differently. They play\nmore roughly with their sons\u2014for example, by throwing them up in the air or by\ngently wrestling with them\u2014and more quietly with their daughters. When their\ninfant or toddler daughters cry, they warmly comfort them, but they tend to let\ntheir sons cry longer and to comfort them less. They give their girls dolls to play\nwith and their boys action figures and toy guns. While these gender differences in\nsocialization are probably smaller now than a generation ago, they certainly\ncontinue to exist. Go into a large toy store and you will see pink aisles of dolls and\ncooking sets and blue aisles of action figures, toy guns, and related items.\nPeers\nPeer influences also encourage gender socialization. As they reach school age,\nchildren begin to play different games based on their gender. Boys tend to play\nsports and other competitive team games governed by inflexible rules and\nrelatively large numbers of roles, while girls tend to play smaller, cooperative\ngames such as hopscotch and jumping rope with fewer and more flexible rules.\nAlthough girls are much more involved in sports now than a generation ago, these\ngender differences in their play persist and continue to reinforce gender roles. For\nexample, boys\u2019 games encourage them to be competitive, while girls\u2019 games\nencourage them to become cooperative and trusting. The patterns we see in\nadult males and females thus have roots in their play as young children (Lindsey,\n2011) (see Note 4.13 \u201cChildren and Our Future\u201d).\nChildren and Our Future\nGirls and Boys at Play\nThe text discusses how the types of games that girls and boys play influence their\ngender-role socialization. Let\u2019s take a closer look at two early sociological studies\nthat provided important evidence for this process.\nJanet Lever (1978) studied fifth-grade children in three different communities in\nConnecticut. She watched them play and otherwise interact in school and also\nhad the children keep diaries of their play and games outside school. Lever found\nthat boys\u2019 games were typically more complex than girls\u2019 games: The boys\u2019 games\nhad a greater number of rules and more specialized roles, and they also involved\nmore individuals playing. She attributed these differences to socialization by\nparents, teachers, and other adults and argued that the complexity of boys\u2019 play and games helped them to be better able than girls to learn important social skills\nsuch as dealing with rules and coordinating actions to achieve goals.\nA second sociologist, Barrie Thorne (1993), studied fourth- and fifth-graders in\nCalifornia and Michigan. The boys tended to play team sports and other\ncompetitive games, while the girls tended to play cooperative games such as\njump rope. These differences led Thorne to conclude that gender-role\nsocialization stems not only from practices by adults but also from the children\u2019s\nown activities without adult involvement. When boys and girls interacted, it was\noften \u201cgirls against the boys\u201d in classroom spelling contests and in games such as\ntag. Thorne concluded that these \u201cus against them\u201d contests helped the children\nlearn that boys and girls are two different and antagonistic sexes. Boys also\ntended to disrupt girls\u2019 games more than the reverse and in this manner both\nexerted and learned dominance over females. In all these ways, children were not\njust the passive recipients of gender-role socialization from adults (their\nteachers), but they also played an active role in ensuring that such socialization\noccurred.\nThese two studies were among the first to emphasize the importance of\nchildren\u2019s play for the gender-based traits and values that girls and boys learn,\nwhich in turn affect the choices they make for careers and other matters later in\nlife. The rise in team sports opportunities for girls in the years since Lever and\nThorne did their research is a welcome development, but young children continue\nto play in the ways that Lever and Thorne found. The body of research on gender\ndifferences in children\u2019s play points to the need for teachers, parents, and other\nadults to encourage girls and boys alike to have a mixture of both competitive and\ncooperative games so that both sexes may develop a better balance of values that\nare now commonly considered to be either feminine or masculine.\nSchools\nSchool is yet another agent of gender socialization. First of all, school playgrounds\nprovide a location for the gender-linked play activities just described to occur.\nSecond, and perhaps more important, teachers at all levels treat their female and\nmale students differently in subtle ways of which they are probably not aware.\nThey tend to call on boys more often to answer questions in class and to praise\nthem more when they give the right answer. They also give boys more feedback\nabout their assignments and other school work (Sadker & Sadker, 1994). At all\ngrade levels, many textbooks and other books still portray people in gender- stereotyped ways. It is true that the newer books do less of this than older ones,\nbut the newer books still contain some stereotypes, and the older books are still\nused in many schools, especially those that cannot afford to buy newer volumes.\nMass Media\nGender socialization also occurs through the mass media (Renzetti, Curran, &\nMaier, 2012). On children\u2019s television shows, the major characters are male. On\nNickelodeon, for example, the very popular SpongeBob SquarePants is a male, as\nare his pet snail, Gary; his best friend, Patrick Star; their neighbor, Squidward\nTentacles; and SpongeBob\u2019s employer, Eugene Crabs. Of the major characters in\nBikini Bottom, only Sandy Cheeks is a female. For all its virtues, Sesame\nStreet features Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, and other male characters. Most of\nthe Muppets are males, and the main female character, Miss Piggy, depicted as\nvain and jealous, is hardly an admirable female role model. As for adults\u2019 prime-\ntime television, more men than women continue to fill more major roles in\nweekly shows, despite notable women\u2019s roles in shows such as The Good\nWife and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Women are also often portrayed as unintelligent or\nfrivolous individuals who are there more for their looks than for anything else.\nTelevision commercials reinforce this image. Cosmetics ads abound, suggesting\nnot only that a major task for women is to look good but also that their sense of\nself-worth stems from looking good. Other commercials show women becoming\necstatic over achieving a clean floor or sparkling laundry. Judging from the world\nof television commercials, then, women\u2019s chief goals in life are to look good and\nto have a clean house. At the same time, men\u2019s chief goals, judging from many\ncommercials, are to drink beer and drive cars. Women\u2019s magazines reinforce the view that women need to be slender and wear\nmany cosmetics in order to be considered beautiful.\nPhoto Editing Services Tucia.com \u2013 Glamour /Fashion Retouching by Tucia \u2013 CC BY\n2.0.\nWomen\u2019s and men\u2019s magazines reinforce these gender images (Hesse-Biber,\n2007; Milillo, 2008). Most of the magazines intended for teenaged girls and adult\nwomen are filled with pictures of thin, beautiful models; advice on dieting;\ncosmetics ads; and articles on how to win and please your man. Conversely, the\nmagazines intended for teenaged boys and men are filled with ads and articles on\ncars and sports, advice on how to succeed in careers and other endeavors, and\npictures of thin, beautiful (and sometimes nude) women. These magazine images\nagain suggest that women\u2019s chief goals are to look good and to please men and\nthat men\u2019s chief goals are to succeed, win over women, and live life in the fast\nlane.\nReligion\nAnother agent of socialization, religion, also contributes to traditional gender\nstereotypes. Many traditional interpretations of the Bible yield the message that\nwomen are subservient to men (Tanenbaum, 2009). This message begins in\nGenesis, where the first human is Adam, and Eve was made from one of his ribs.\nThe major figures in the rest of the Bible are men, and women are for the most\npart depicted as wives, mothers, temptresses, and prostitutes; they are praised for their roles as wives and mothers and condemned for their other roles. More\ngenerally, women are constantly depicted as the property of men. The Ten\nCommandments includes a neighbor\u2019s wife with his house, ox, and other objects\nas things not to be coveted (Exodus 20:17), and many biblical passages say\nexplicitly that women belong to men, such as this one from the New Testament:\n\u201cWives be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head\nof the wife as Christ is the head of the Church. As the Church is subject to Christ,\nso let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands\u201d (Ephesians 5:22\u201324).\nSeveral passages in the Old Testament justify the rape and murder of women and\ngirls. The Koran, the sacred book of Islam, also contains passages asserting the\nsubordinate role of women (Mayer, 2009).\nA Final Word on the Sources of Gender\nScholars in many fields continue to debate the relative importance of biology and\nof culture and socialization for how we behave and think as girls and boys and as\nwomen and men. The biological differences between females and males lead\nmany scholars and no doubt much of the public to assume that masculinity and\nfemininity are to a large degree biologically determined or at least influenced. In\ncontrast, anthropologists, sociologists, and other social scientists tend to view\ngender as a social construction. Even if biology does matter for gender, they say,\nthe significance of culture and socialization should not be underestimated. To the\nextent that gender is indeed shaped by society and culture, it is possible to\nchange gender and to help bring about a society where both men and women\nhave more opportunity to achieve their full potential.\nKey Takeaways\nSex is a biological concept, while gender is a social concept and refers to the social\nand cultural differences a society assigns to people based on their sex.\nSeveral biological explanations for gender roles exist, but sociologists think culture\nand socialization are more important sources of gender roles than biology.\nFamilies, schools, peers, the mass media, and religion are agents of socialization\nfor the development of gender identity and gender roles.\nReferences Andersen, M., & Hysock, D.

Feminism and Sexism\nLearning Objectives:\nDefine feminism, sexism, and patriarchy.\nDiscuss evidence for a decline in sexism.\nIn the national General Social Survey (GSS), slightly more than one-third of the\npublic agrees with this statement: \u201cIt is much better for everyone involved if the\nman is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and\nfamily.\u201d Do you agree or disagree with this statement? If you are like the majority\nof college students, you disagree.\nToday a lot of women, and some men, will say, \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but\u2026,\u201d and\nthen go on to add that they hold certain beliefs about women\u2019s equality and\ntraditional gender roles that actually fall into a feminist framework. Their\nreluctance to self-identify as feminists underscores the negative image that\nfeminists and feminism have but also suggests that the actual meaning of\nfeminism may be unclear.\nFeminism and sexism are generally two sides of the same coin. Feminism refers to\nthe belief that women and men should have equal opportunities in economic,\npolitical, and social life, while sexism refers to a belief in traditional gender role\nstereotypes and in the inherent inequality between men and women. Sexism thus\nparallels the concept of racial and ethnic prejudice discussed in Chapter 3 \u201cRacial\nand Ethnic Inequality\u201d. Women and people of color are both said, for biological\nand/or cultural reasons, to lack certain qualities for success in today\u2019s world. Feminism as a social movement began in the United States during the abolitionist\nperiod before the Civil War. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (left) and Lucretia Mott (right)\nwere outspoken abolitionists who made connections between slavery and the\noppression of women.\nThe US Library of Congress \u2013 public domain; The US Library of Congress \u2013 public\ndomain.\nTwo feminist movements in US history have greatly advanced the cause of\nwomen\u2019s equality and changed views about gender. The first began during the\nabolitionist period, when abolitionists such as Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott,\nand Elizabeth Cady Stanton began to see similarities between slavery and the\noppression of women. This new women\u2019s movement focused on many issues but\nespecially the right to vote, which women won in 1920. The second major\nfeminist movement began in the late 1960s, as women active in the Southern civil\nrights movement turned their attention to women\u2019s rights, and it is still active\ntoday. This movement has profoundly changed public thinking and social and\neconomic institutions, but, as we will soon see, much gender inequality remains.\nSeveral varieties of feminism exist. Although they all share the basic idea that\nwomen and men should be equal in their opportunities in all spheres of life, they\ndiffer in other ways (Hannam, 2012). Liberal feminism believes that the equality\nof women can be achieved within our existing society by passing laws and\nreforming social, economic, and political institutions. In contrast, socialist feminism blames capitalism for women\u2019s inequality and says that true gender\nequality can result only if fundamental changes in social institutions, and even a\nsocialist revolution, are achieved. Radical feminism, on the other hand, says\nthat patriarchy (male domination) lies at the root of women\u2019s oppression and that\nwomen are oppressed even in noncapitalist societies. Patriarchy itself must be\nabolished, they say, if women are to become equal to men. Finally, multicultural\nfeminism emphasizes that women of color are oppressed not only because of\ntheir gender but also because of their race and class. They thus face a triple\nburden that goes beyond their gender. By focusing their attention on women of\ncolor in the United States and other nations, multicultural feminists remind us\nthat the lives of these women differ in many ways from those of the middle-class\nwomen who historically have led US feminist movements.\nThe Growth of Feminism and the Decline of Sexism\nWhat evidence is there for the impact of the contemporary women\u2019s movement\non public thinking? The GSS, the Gallup poll, and other national surveys show that\nthe public has moved away from traditional views of gender toward more modern\nones. Another way of saying this is that the public has moved from sexism toward\nfeminism.\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s return to the GSS statement that it is much better for the\nman to achieve outside the home and for the woman to take care of home and\nfamily. Figure 4.2 \u201cChange in Acceptance of Traditional Gender Roles in the\nFamily, 1977\u20132010\u201d shows that agreement with this statement dropped sharply\nduring the 1970s and 1980s before leveling off afterward to slightly more than\none-third of the public. Figure 4.2 Change in Acceptance of Traditional Gender Roles in the Family, 1977\u2013\n2010\nPercentage agreeing that \u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the man is\nthe achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and\nfamily.\u201d\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1977\u20132010). Retrieved\nfrom http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nAnother GSS question over the years has asked whether respondents would be\nwilling to vote for a qualified woman for president of the United States. As Figure\n4.3 \u201cChange in Willingness to Vote for a Qualified Woman for\nPresident\u201d illustrates, this percentage rose from 74 percent in the early 1970s to a\nhigh of 96.2 percent in 2010. Although we have not yet had a woman president,\ndespite Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s historic presidential primary campaign in 2007\nand 2008 and Sarah Palin\u2019s presence on the Republican ticket in 2008, the survey\nevidence indicates the public is willing to vote for one. As demonstrated by the\nresponses to the survey questions on women\u2019s home roles and on a woman\npresident, traditional gender views have indeed declined.

Dimensions of Gender Inequality\nLearning Objectives:\nSummarize the status of women around the world today.\nUnderstand the extent of and reasons for gender inequality in income and the\nworkplace in the United States.\nUnderstand the extent of and reasons for sexual harassment.\nThe primary focus of this chapter is gender inequality in the United States, but it is\nalso important to discuss gender inequality worldwide. While American women\nare unequal to men in many respects, women\u2019s situation throughout much of the\nworld is especially dire. Accordingly, we first examine the global inequality of\nwomen before turning our attention to the United States.\nThe Global Inequality of Women\nThe problem of global poverty first discussed in Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201d is especially\nsevere for women. Although, as Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201d noted, more than 1.4 billion\npeople on earth are desperately poor, their ranks include more than their fair\nshare of women, who are estimated to make up 70 percent of the world\u2019s poor.\nBecause women tend to be poorer than men worldwide, they are more likely than\nmen to experience all the problems that poverty causes, including malnutrition\nand disease. But they also suffer additional problems. Some of these problems\nderive from women\u2019s physiological role of childbearing, and some arise from how\nthey are treated simply because they are women.\nLet\u2019s first look at childbearing. One of the most depressing examples of how\nglobal poverty affects women is maternal mortality, or the number of women\nwho die during childbirth for every 100,000 live births. More than 500,000\nwomen die worldwide annually from complications during pregnancy or\nchildbirth. Maternal mortality usually results from one or more of the following:\ninadequate prenatal nutrition, disease and illness, and inferior obstetrical care, all\nof which are much more common in poor nations than in wealthy nations. In\nwealthy nations, the rate of maternal mortality is 14 per 100,000 births, but in\npoor nations the rate is a distressingly high 590 per 100,000 births, equivalent to\nalmost 6 deaths for every 1,000 births. Women in poor nations are thus forty-two times more likely than those in wealthy nations to die from complications during\npregnancy or childbirth (World Bank, 2012).\nIn India and Pakistan, thousands of new wives every year are murdered in dowry\ndeaths because they have not provided their husbands a suitable amount of\nmoney and goods.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIn addition to these problems, women in poor nations fare worse than men in\nother ways because of how they are treated as women. One manifestation of this\nfact is the violence they experience (World Health Organization, 2010).World\nHealth Organization/London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n(2010). Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking\naction and generating evidence. Geneva, Switzerland: Author. About one-third of\nwomen worldwide have been raped or beaten, leading Amnesty International\n(2004) to call violence against women \u201cthe greatest human rights scandal of our\ntimes.\u201d Although violence against women certainly occurs in wealthy nations, it is\nmore common and extreme in poor and middle-income nations, and in nations\nwhere women\u2019s inequality (as reflected by criteria such as their labor force participation and their educational attainment) is especially high (Kaya & Cook,\n2010). More than half of women in Uganda, for example, have been physically or\nsexually abused (Amnesty International, 2010). Many young women in India who\nwork outside the home have been raped by male high-school dropouts who think\nthese women lack virtue and should be punished with rape (Polgreen, 2011). In\nIndia and Pakistan, thousands of women are killed every year in dowry deaths, in\nwhich a new wife is murdered by her husband and/or his relatives if she does not\npay the groom money or goods (Kethineni & Srinivasan, 2009). In many countries,\nyoung girls routinely have their genitals cut out, often with no anesthesia, in what\nhas been termed female genital mutilation, a practice that is thought to affect\nmore than 100 million girls and women across the earth and has been called an\nact of torture (Kristoff, 2011; Rogo, Subayi, & Toubia, 2007).\nSex trafficking is another major problem in countries like Cambodia, India, Nepal,\nand Thailand, where young girls are often stolen from their parents and forced to\nwork as prostitutes in what amounts to sexual slavery. The number of girls (and\nsometimes boys) under age 18 who work as sex slaves is thought to reach into the\nmillions and to be larger than the number of African slaves during the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries (Kristoff & WuDunn, 2010).\nBeyond violence, women in poor nations are less likely than their male\ncounterparts to get a higher education, and girls are less likely than boys to\nattend primary school. Women are also less likely than men to work in jobs that\npay a decent wage and to hold political office. In many poor nations, girls are less\nlikely than boys to receive adequate medical care when they become ill and are\nmore likely than boys to die before age 5. In all these ways, women and girls in\npoor nations especially suffer.\nIn stark contrast, women in wealthy democratic nations fare much better than\ntheir counterparts in poor nations. In many wealthy democracies, women\u2019s status\nvis-\u00e0-vis men is higher than in the United States. The Note 4.23 \u201cLessons from\nOther Societies\u201d box discusses this situation further.\nLessons from Other Societies\nWomen in the Nordic Nations\nThe United Nations Development Programme ranks nations on a \u201cgender\nempowerment measure\u201d of women\u2019s involvement in their nation\u2019s economy and\npolitical life (United Nations Development Programme, 2009). Of the 109 nations\nincluded in the measure, Sweden ranks first, followed by Norway, Finland, and Denmark. The remaining Nordic nation, Iceland, ranks eighth. The other nations in\nthe top ten are the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand.\nCanada ranks twelfth, and the United States ranks only eighteenth. In trying to\nunderstand why the United States ranks this low and what it might be able to do\nto increase its empowerment of women, the experience of the Nordic nations\nprovides some important lessons.\nThe Nordic nations rank at the top of the gender empowerment measure largely\nbecause they have made a concerted effort to boost women\u2019s involvement in the\nbusiness and political worlds (Sumer, Smithson, Guerreiro, & Granlund, 2008).\nThey are all social democratic welfare states characterized by extensive\ngovernment programs and other efforts to promote full economic and gender\nequality.\nFor example, Norway\u2019s government provides day care for children and adult care\nfor older or disabled individuals, and it also provides forty-four weeks of paid\nparental leave after the birth of a child. Parents can also work fewer hours\nwithout losing income until their child is 2 years of age. All these provisions mean\nthat women are much more likely than their American counterparts to have the\nfreedom and economic means to work outside the home, and they have taken\nadvantage of this opportunity. As a recent analysis concluded, \u201cIt has been\nextremely important for women that social rights have been extended to cover\nsuch things as the caring of young children and elderly, sick and disabled\nmembers of society. In the Nordic countries, women have been more successful\nthan elsewhere in combining their dual role as mothers and workers, and social\npolicy arrangements are an integral part of the gender equality policy\u201d (Kangas &\nPalme, 2009, p. 565).\nThe lesson for the United States is clear: An important reason for the Nordic\nnations\u2019 high gender empowerment ranking is government policy that enables\nwomen to work outside the home if they want to do so. The experience of these\nnations indicates that greater gender equality might be achieved in the United\nStates if it adopted policies similar to those found in these nations that make it\neasier for women to join and stay in the labor force.\nGender Inequality in the United States\nWe have said that the women\u2019s movement changed American life in many ways\nbut that gender inequality persists in the United States. Let\u2019s look at examples of\nsuch inequality, much of it taking the form of institutional discrimination, which, as we saw in Chapter 3 \u201cRacial and Ethnic Inequality\u201d, can occur even if it is not\nintended to happen. We start with gender inequality in income and the workplace\nand then move on to a few other spheres of life.\nThe Gender Gap in Income\nIn the last few decades, women have entered the workplace in increasing\nnumbers, partly, and for many women mostly, out of economic necessity, and\npartly out of desire for the sense of self-worth and other fulfillment that comes\nwith work. In February 2012, 57.9 percent of US women aged 16 or older were in\nthe labor force, compared to only 43.3 percent in 1970; comparable figures for\nmen were 70.3 percent in 2012 and 79.7 percent in 1970 (Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2012). Thus while women\u2019s labor force participation continues to lag\nbehind men\u2019s, this gender gap has narrowed. The figures just cited include\nwomen of retirement age. When we just look at younger women, labor force\nparticipation is even higher. For example, 74.7 percent of women aged 35\u201344\nwere in the labor force in 2011, compared to only 46.8 percent in 1970.\nDespite the workplace gains women have made, problems persist. Perhaps the\nmajor problem is a gender gap in income. Women have earned less money than\nmen ever since records started being kept (Reskin & Padavic, 2002). In the United\nStates in the early 1800s, full-time women workers in agriculture and\nmanufacturing earned less than 38 percent of what men earned. By 1885, they\nwere earning about 50 percent of what men earned in manufacturing jobs. As the\n1980s began, full-time women workers\u2019 median weekly earnings were about 65\npercent of men\u2019s. Women have narrowed the gender gap in earnings since then:\nTheir weekly earnings now (2011) are 82.2 percent of men\u2019s among full-time\nworkers ages 16 and older (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). Still, this means that\nfor every $10,000 men earn, women earn only about $8,220. To turn that around,\nfor every $10,000 women earn, men earn $12,156. This gap amounts to hundreds\nof thousands of dollars over a lifetime of working. Women have earned less money than men ever since records started being kept.\nWomen now earn about 81 percent of what men earn.\nJohn Jacobi \u2013 receptionist answering phone at suburban eye care \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAs Table 4.1 \u201cMedian Annual Earnings of Full-Time, Year-Round Workers Aged\n25\u201364 by Educational Attainment, 2010*\u201d shows, this gender gap exists for all\nlevels of education and even increases with higher levels of education. On the\naverage, women with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher and working full time earn\nalmost $18,000 less per year than their male counterparts.\nTable 4.1 Median Annual Earnings of Full-Time, Year-Round Workers Aged 25\u201364\nby Educational Attainment, 2010*\nHigh Some college or Bachelor\u2019s\nHigh school school associate\u2019s degree or\ndropout degree degree higher\nMen 25,272 36,920 43,940 69,160\nWomen 20,176 28,236 33,176 51,272 High Some college or Bachelor\u2019s\nHigh school school associate\u2019s degree or\ndropout degree degree higher\nDifference 5,096 8,684 10,764 17,888\nGender gap (%;\n79.8 76.5 75.5 74.1\nwomen \u00f7 men)\n* Median weekly earnings \u00d7 52 weeks\nSource: US Department of Labor. (2011). Highlights of women\u2019s earnings in 2010.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nWhat accounts for the gender gap in earnings? A major reason is sex\nsegregation in the workplace, which accounts for up to 45 percent of the gender\ngap (Kelley, 2011; Reskin & Padavic, 2002). Although women have increased their\nlabor force participation, the workplace remains segregated by gender. Almost\nhalf of all women work in a few low-paying clerical and service (e.g., waitressing)\njobs, while men work in a much greater variety of jobs, including high-paying\nones. Table 4.2 \u201cGender Segregation in the Workplace for Selected Occupations,\n2010\u201d shows that many jobs are composed primarily of women or of men. Part of\nthe reason for this segregation is that socialization affects what jobs young men\nand women choose to pursue, and part of the reason is that women and men do\nnot want to encounter difficulties they may experience if they took a job\ntraditionally assigned to the other sex. A third reason is that sex-segregated jobs\ndiscriminate against applicants who are not the \u201cright\u201d sex for that job. Employers\nmay either consciously refuse to hire someone who is the \u201cwrong\u201d sex for the job\nor have job requirements (e.g., height requirements) and workplace rules (e.g.,\nworking at night) that unintentionally make it more difficult for women to qualify\nfor certain jobs. Although such practices and requirements are now illegal, they\nstill continue. The sex segregation they help create contributes to the continuing\ngender gap between female and male workers. Occupations dominated by\nwomen tend to have lower wages and salaries. Because women are concentrated\nin low-paying jobs, their earnings are much lower than men\u2019s (Reskin & Padavic,\n2002). This fact raises an important question: Why do women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s jobs? Is it because their jobs are not important and require few skills\n(recalling the functional theory of stratification discussed in Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201d)?\nThe evidence indicates otherwise: Women\u2019s work is devalued precisely because it\nis women\u2019s work, and women\u2019s jobs thus pay less than men\u2019s jobs because they\nare women\u2019s jobs (Magnusson, 2009).\nTable 4.2 Gender Segregation in the Workplace for Selected Occupations, 2010\nFemale workers Male workers\nOccupation (%) (%)\nPreschool and kindergarten teachers 97.0 3.0\nSpeech-language pathologists 96.3 3.7\nSecretaries and administrative\n96.1 3.9\nassistants\nDental hygienists 95.1 4.9\nRegistered nurses 91.1 8.9\nFood servers (waiters/waitresses) 71.1 29.9\nPharmacists 53.0 47.0\nPhysicians 32.3 67.7\nLawyers 31.5 68.5\nDentists 25.5 64.5\nComputer software engineers 20.9 79.1 Female workers Male workers\nOccupation (%) (%)\nElectricians 1.5 98.5\nCarpenters 1.4 98.5\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau.

Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nStudies of comparable worth support this argument (Levanon, England, & Allison,\n2009). Researchers rate various jobs in terms of their requirements and attributes\nthat logically should affect the salaries they offer: the importance of the job, the\ndegree of skill it requires, the level of responsibility it requires, the degree to\nwhich the employee must exercise independent judgment, and so forth. They\nthen use these dimensions to determine what salary a job should offer. Some jobs\nmight be better on some dimensions and worse on others but still end up with\nthe same predicted salary if everything evens out. Some women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s jobs even though their comparable\nworth is equal to or even higher than the men\u2019s jobs. For example, a social\nworker, depicted here, may earn less money than a probation officer, even\nthough calculations based on comparable worth would predict that a social\nworker should earn at least as much.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nWhen researchers make their calculations, they find that certain women\u2019s jobs\npay less than men\u2019s even though their comparable worth is equal to or even\nhigher than the men\u2019s jobs. For example, a social worker may earn less money\nthan a probation officer, even though calculations based on comparable worth\nwould predict that a social worker should earn at least as much. The comparable\nworth research demonstrates that women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s jobs of\ncomparable worth and that the average working family would earn several\nthousand dollars more annually if pay scales were reevaluated based on\ncomparable worth and women were paid more for their work.\nEven when women and men work in the same jobs, women often earn less than\nmen, and men are more likely than women to hold leadership positions in these\noccupations. Government data provide ready evidence of the lower incomes\nwomen receive even in the same occupations. For example, among full-time\nemployees, female marketing and sales managers earn only 66 percent of what\ntheir male counterparts earn; female human resource managers earn only 80\npercent of what their male counterparts earn; female claims adjusters earn only\n77 percent; female accountants earn only 75 percent; female elementary and\nmiddle school teachers earn only 91 percent; and even female secretaries and\nclerical workers earn only 91 percent (US Department of Labor, 2011).\nOne reason for these differences, and for women\u2019s lower earnings in general, is\ntheir caregiving responsibilities (Chang, 2010). Women are more likely than men\nto have the major, and perhaps the sole, responsibility for taking care of children\nand aging parents or other adults who need care. This responsibility limits their\nwork hours and often prompts them to drop out of the labor force. If women\nrejoin the labor force after their children start school, or join for the first time,\nthey are already several years behind men who began working at an earlier age.\nEconomics writer David Leonhardt (2010, p. B1) explains this dynamic: \u201cMany\nmore women take time off from work. Many more women work part time at\nsome point in their careers. Many more women can\u2019t get to work early or stay late. And our economy exacts a terribly steep price for any time away from\nwork\u2014in both pay and promotions. People often cannot just pick up where they\nhave left off. Entire career paths are closed off. The hit to earnings is permanent.\u201d\nWe can see evidence of this \u201chit\u201d when we examine the gender gap in earnings by\nage. This gap is relatively low for people in their early twenties, when women\nearn 93.8 percent of what men earn, but rises during the next two decades of age\nas more and more women bear and raise children (see Figure 4.4 \u201cGender, Age,\nand Median Weekly Earnings of Full-Time Employees, 2010\u201d).\nFigure 4.4 Gender, Age, and Median Weekly Earnings of Full-Time Employees,\n2010\nSource: U.S. Department of Labor. (2011). Highlights of Women\u2019s Earnings in\n2010. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Labor.\nStill, when variables like number of years on the job, number of hours worked per\nweek, and size of firm are taken into account, gender differences in earnings\ndiminish but do not disappear altogether, and it is very likely that sex\ndiscrimination (conscious or unconscious) by employers accounts for much of the\nremaining disparity.\nSome of the sex discrimination in employment reflects the existence of two\nrelated phenomena, the glass ceiling and the glass escalator. Women may be\npromoted in a job only to find they reach an invisible \u201cglass ceiling\u201d beyond which they cannot get promoted, or they may not get promoted in the first place. In the\nlargest US corporations, women constitute only about 16 percent of the top\nexecutives, and women executives are paid much less than their male\ncounterparts (Jenner & Ferguson, 2009). Although these disparities stem partly\nfrom the fact that women joined the corporate ranks much more recently than\nmen, they also reflect a glass ceiling in the corporate world that prevents qualified\nwomen from rising up above a certain level (Hymowitz, 2009). Men, on the other\nhand, can often ride a \u201cglass escalator\u201d to the top, even in female occupations. An\nexample is seen in elementary school teaching, where principals typically rise\nfrom the ranks of teachers. Although men constitute only about 16 percent of all\npublic elementary school teachers, they account for about 41 percent of all\nelementary school principals (Aud et al., 2011).\nWomen constitute only about 16 percent of the top executives in the largest US\ncorporations, and women executives are paid much less than their male\ncounterparts. These disparities reflect a \u201cglass ceiling\u201d that limits women\u2019s\nopportunities for promotion. Baltic Development Forum \u2013 Kristovskis meeting \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nWhatever the reasons for the gender gap in income, the fact that women make so\nmuch less than men means that female-headed families are especially likely to be\npoor. In 2010, almost 32 percent of these families lived in poverty, compared to\nonly 6 percent of married-couple families (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2011).\nAs noted in Chapter 2 \u201cPoverty\u201d, the term feminization of poverty refers to the\nfact that female-headed households are especially likely to be poor. The\ngendering of poverty in this manner is one of the most significant manifestations\nof gender inequality in the United States.\nSexual Harassment\nAnother workplace problem (including schools) is sexual harassment, which, as\ndefined by federal guidelines and legal rulings and statutes, consists of\nunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or physical conduct of a\nsexual nature that is used as a condition of employment or promotion or that\ninterferes with an individual\u2019s job performance and creates an intimidating or\nhostile environment.\nAlthough men can be, and are, sexually harassed, women are more often the\ntargets of sexual harassment. This gender difference exists for at least two\nreasons, one cultural and one structural. The cultural reason centers on the\ndepiction of women and the socialization of men. As our discussion of the mass\nmedia and gender socialization indicated, women are still depicted in our culture\nas sexual objects that exist for men\u2019s pleasure. At the same time, our culture\nsocializes men to be sexually assertive. These two cultural beliefs combine to\nmake men believe that they have the right to make verbal and physical advances\nto women in the workplace. When these advances fall into the guidelines listed\nhere, they become sexual harassment. Sexual harassment in the workplace is a common experience. In surveys of\nwomen employees, up to two-thirds of respondents report having been sexually\nharassed.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 4.0.\nThe second reason that most targets of sexual harassment are women is more\nstructural. Reflecting the gendered nature of the workplace and of the\neducational system, typically the men doing the harassment are in a position of\npower over the women they harass. A male boss harasses a female employee, or\na male professor harasses a female student or employee. These men realize that\nsubordinate women may find it difficult to resist their advances for fear of\nreprisals: A female employee may be fired or not promoted, and a female student\nmay receive a bad grade.\nHow common is sexual harassment? This is difficult to determine, as the men who\ndo the sexual harassment are not about to shout it from the rooftops, and the\nwomen who suffer it often keep quiet because of the repercussions just listed.\nBut anonymous surveys of women employees in corporate and other settings\ncommonly find that 40\u201365 percent of the respondents report being sexually\nharassed (Rospenda, Richman, & Shannon, 2009). In a survey of 4,501 women\nphysicians, 36.9 percent reported being sexually harassed either in medical school\nor in their practice as physicians (Frank, Brogan, & Schiffman, 1998). In studies of\ncollege students, almost one-third of women undergraduates and about 40\npercent of women graduate students report being sexually harassed by a faculty\nmember (Clodfelter, Turner, Hartman, & Kuhns, 2010). Studies of people who have been sexually harassed find that they often\nexperience various psychological problems. The Note 4.29 \u201cApplying Social\nResearch\u201d box discusses this body of research further.\nApplying Social Research\nThe Long-Term Mental Health Consequences of Sexual Harassment\nDespite the fact that sexual harassment is illegal, most women (and men) who are\nsexually harassed do not bring court action. Two reasons explain their decision\nnot to sue: they fear being fired and/or they worry they will not be believed. But\nanother reason has to do with the mental and emotional consequences of being\nsexually harassed. These consequences include relationship problems, a loss of\nself-esteem, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and a feeling of\npowerlessness. These effects are similar to those for posttraumatic stress disorder\nand are considered symptoms of what has been termed sexual harassment\ntrauma syndrome. This syndrome, and perhaps especially the feeling of\npowerlessness, are thought to help explain why sexual harassment victims hardly\never bring court action and otherwise often keep quiet. According to law\nprofessor Theresa Beiner, the legal system should become more aware of these\npsychological consequences as it deals with the important question in sexual\nharassment cases of whether harassment actually occurred. If a woman keeps\nquiet about the harassment, it is too easy for judges and juries to believe, as\nhappens in rape cases, that the woman originally did not mind the behavior that\nshe now says is harassment.\nShould the legal system begin to make better use of social science research on\nsexual harassment trauma syndrome, a recent study by sociologist Jason N. Houle\nand colleagues provides important new evidence for legal officials to consider.\nThe authors note two faults in prior sexual harassment research. First, most\nstudies have focused on workers in a single occupation, such as lawyers, or in a\nsingle organization, such as a university campus, rather than in a diverse set of\noccupations and organizations. Second, because most studies have examined\nworkers at only one point in time, they have been unable to study the long-term\npsychological consequences of sexual harassment.\nTo correct these deficiencies, Houle et al. analyzed data from a study of 1,010\nninth-graders in St. Paul, Minnesota, that followed them from 1988 to 2004,\nwhen they were 30 or 31 years old. The study included measures of the\nrespondents\u2019 experience of sexual harassment at several periods over the study\u2019s sixteen-year time span (ages 14\u201318, 19\u201326, 29\u201330, and 30\u201331), their level of\npsychological depression, and their sociodemographic background. Focusing on\ndepression at ages 30 or 31, the authors found that sexual harassment at ages\n14\u201318 did not affect the chances of depression at ages 30\u201331, but that sexual\nharassment during any of the other three age periods did increase the chances of\ndepression at ages 30\u201331. These results held true for both women and men who\nhad been harassed. The authors concluded that the \u201ceffects of harassment are\nindeed lasting, as harassment experiences early in the career were associated\nwith heightened depressive symptoms nearly 10 years later.\u201d\nIn finding long-term effects of sexual harassment on women and men in a variety\nof occupations and organizational settings, Houle et al.\u2019s study made an\nimportant contribution to our understanding of the psychological consequences\nof sexual harassment. Its findings underscore the need for workplaces and\ncampuses to do everything possible to eliminate this illegal and harmful behavior\nand perhaps will prove useful in sexual harassment lawsuits.\nSources: Beiner, 2005; Houle, Staff, Mortimer, Uggen, & Blackstone, 2011;\nWillness, Steel, & Lee, 2007\nWomen of Color: A Triple Burden\nEarlier we mentioned multicultural feminism, which stresses that women of color\nface difficulties for three reasons: their gender, their race, and, often, their social\nclass, which is frequently near the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. They thus\nface a triple burden that manifests itself in many ways.\nFor example, women of color experience extra income inequality. Earlier we\ndiscussed the gender gap in earnings, with women earning 82.2 percent of what\nmen earn, but women of color face both a gender gap and a racial/ethnic\ngap. Table 4.3 \u201cThe Race/Ethnicity and Gender Gap in Annual Earnings for Full-\nTime, Year-Round Workers, 2010*\u201d depicts this double gap for full-time workers.\nWe see a racial/ethnic gap among both women and men, as African Americans\nand Latinos of either gender earn less than whites. We also see a gender gap\nbetween men and women, as women earn less than men within any\nrace/ethnicity. These two gaps combine to produce an especially high gap\nbetween African American and Latina women and white men: African American\nwomen earn only about 70 percent of what white men earn, and Latina women\nearn only about 60 percent of what white men earn.

We noted earlier that almost 32 percent of all female-\nheaded families are poor. This figure masks race/ethnic differences among such\nfamilies: 24.8 percent of families headed by non-Latina white women are poor,\ncompared to 41.0 percent of families headed by African American women and\nalso 44.5 percent of families headed by Latina women (DeNavas-Walt et al.,\n2011). While white women are poorer than white men, African American and\nLatina women are clearly poorer than white women. Household Inequality\nGender inequality occurs within families and households. We will talk more about\nthis aspect of family life in Chapter 10 \u201cThe Changing Family\u201d, but briefly discuss\nhere one significant dimension of gender-based household inequality: housework.\nSomeone has to do housework, and that someone is usually a woman. It takes\nmany hours a week to clean the bathrooms, cook, shop in the grocery store,\nvacuum, and do everything else that needs to be done. The research evidence\nindicates that women married to or living with men spend two to three times as\nmany hours per week on housework as men spend (Gupta & Ash, 2008). This\ndisparity holds true even when women work outside the home, leading\nsociologist Arlie Hochschild (Hochschild, 1989) to observe in a widely cited book\nthat women engage in a \u201csecond shift\u201d of unpaid work when they come home\nfrom their paying job.\nThe good news is that gender differences in housework time are smaller than a\ngeneration ago. The bad news is that a large gender difference remains. As one\nstudy summarized the evidence on this issue, \u201cWomen invest significantly more\nhours in household labor than do men despite the narrowing of gender\ndifferences in recent years\u201d (Bianchi, Milkie, Sayer, & Robinson, 2000, p. 196). In\nthe realm of household work, then, gender inequality persists.\nKey Takeaways\nAmong full-time workers, women earn about 79.4 percent of men\u2019s earnings. This\ngender gap in earnings stems from several factors, including sex segregation in\nthe workplace and the lower wages and salaries found in occupations that involve\nmostly women.\nSexual harassment results partly from women\u2019s subordinate status in the\nworkplace and may involve up to two-thirds of women employees.\nWomen of color may face a \u201ctriple burden\u201d of difficulties based on their gender,\ntheir race/ethnicity, and their social class.\nReferences\nAmnesty International.

Sex is a concept that refers to biological differences between females and\nmales, while gender is a concept that refers to a society\u2019s expectations of how\nfemales and males should think and behave.\n2. In understanding gender differences, scholars continue to debate the value of\nbiological explanations. Biological explanations are provocative but ultimately\nimply that gender differences are inevitable and that the status quo must be\nmaintained. In contrast, cultural and socialization explanations imply some\nhope for changing gender roles and for reducing gender inequality.\n3. Many studies emphasize that socialization leads children in the United States\nto adopt the gender roles associated with femininity and masculinity. Parents\nview and interact with their daughters and sons differently, and children\ncontinue to learn their gender roles from their peers, schools, the mass media,\nand religion.\n4. Feminism refers to the belief that women should be equal to men. With\nfeminism defined in this way, many more people hold feminist beliefs than\nmight be willing to admit to it.\n5. Gender inequality in the workplace is manifested through the gender gap in\nearnings and through sexual harassment. Women earn only about 80 percent\nof what men earn. Several reasons account for this gap, including sex\nsegregation in the workplace, women\u2019s caring roles, the devaluing of women\u2019s\nwork, and outright sex discrimination by employers. Sexual harassment against\nwomen is quite common and stems from cultural beliefs about women\u2019s and\nmen\u2019s roles and structural differences in the workplace in power between\nwomen and men.\n6. Women of color experience a triple burden based on their gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and social class. Even though white women earn less money\nand are poorer than white men, women of color earn less money and are\npoorer than white women.\nWhat You Can Do\nTo help reduce gender inequality, you may wish to do any of the following: 1. Contribute money to a local, state, or national organization that provides\ntreatment to adolescent girls with drug, alcohol, or other problems.\n2. Volunteer at a rape crisis center or for a rape hotline.\n3. Start or join a group on your campus that focuses on gender issues.\n4. Start or join a group on your campus or in the local community that focuses on\ngetting middle-school girls more interested in math and the sciences.\nThis is a derivative of SOCIAL PROBLEMS: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by a publisher who has requested that they\nand the original author not receive attribution, which was originally released and is used under CC BY-NC-SA.

City\nofficials in Miami Beach, Florida, announced that the city would fire two police\nofficers accused of beating a gay man two years earlier and kicking and arresting a\ngay tourist who came to the man\u2019s defense. The tourist said he called 911 when\nhe saw two officers, who were working undercover, beating the man and kicking\nhis head. According to his account, the officers then shouted antigay slurs at him,\nkicked him, and arrested him on false charges. The president of Miami Beach Gay\nPride welcomed the news of the impending firing. \u201cIt sets a precedent that you\ncan\u2019t discriminate against anyone and get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201c[The two\nofficers] tried to cover it up and arrested the guy. It\u2019s an abuse of power. Kudos to\nthe city. They\u2019ve taken it seriously.\u201d\nSource: Smiley & Rothaus, 2011\nFrom 1933 to 1945, Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime exterminated 6 million Jews in the\nHolocaust, but it also persecuted millions of other people, including gay men. Nazi\nofficials alleged that these men harbored what they termed a \u201cdegeneracy\u201d that\nthreatened Germany\u2019s \u201cdisciplined masculinity.\u201d Calling gay men \u201cantisocial\nparasites\u201d and \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d the Nazi government arrested more than\n100,000 men for violating a law against homosexuality, although it did not arrest\nlesbians because it valued their child-bearing capacity. At least 5,000 gay men\nwere imprisoned, and many more were put in mental institutions. Several\nhundred other gay men were castrated, and up to 15,000 were placed in\nconcentration camps, where most died from disease, starvation, or murder. As\nthe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (2011) summarizes these events,\n\u201cNazi Germany did not seek to kill all homosexuals. Nevertheless, the Nazi state,\nthrough active persecution, attempted to terrorize German homosexuals into\nsexual and social conformity, leaving thousands dead and shattering the lives of\nmany more.\u201d\nThis terrible history reminds us that sexual orientation has often resulted in\ninequality of many kinds, and, in the extreme case of the Nazis, inhumane\ntreatment that included castration, imprisonment, and death. The news story that\nbegan this chapter makes clear that sexual orientation still results in violence, even if this violence falls short of what the Nazis did. Although the gay rights\nmovement has achieved much success, sexual orientation continues to result in\nother types of inequality as well. This chapter examines the many forms of\ninequality linked to sexual orientation today. It begins with a conceptual\ndiscussion of sexual orientation before turning to its history, explanation, types of\ninequality, and other matters.\nReferences\nSmiley, D. & Rothaus, S.

Understanding Sexual Orientation\nLearning Objectives:\nDefine sexual orientation and gender identity.\nDescribe what percentage of the US population is estimated to be LGBT.\nSummarize the history of sexual orientation.\nEvaluate the possible reasons for sexual orientation.\nSexual orientation refers to a person\u2019s preference for sexual relationships with\nindividuals of the other sex (heterosexuality), one\u2019s own sex (homosexuality), or\nboth sexes (bisexuality). The term also increasingly refers\nto transgender (also transgendered) individuals, those whose behavior,\nappearance, and/or gender identity (the personal conception of oneself as\nfemale, male, both, or neither) departs from conventional norms. Transgendered\nindividuals include transvestites (those who dress in the clothing of the opposite\nsex) and transsexuals (those whose gender identity differs from their\nphysiological sex and who sometimes undergo a sex change). A transgender\nwoman is a person who was born biologically as a male and becomes a woman,\nwhile a transgender man is a person who was born biologically as a woman and\nbecomes a man. As you almost certainly know, gay is the common term now used\nfor any homosexual individual; gay men or gays is the common term used for\nhomosexual men, while lesbian is the common term used for homosexual\nwomen. All the types of social orientation just outlined are often collectively\nreferred to by the shorthand LGBT (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender). As you\nalmost certainly also know, the term straight is used today as a synonym for\nheterosexual.\nCounting Sexual Orientation\nWe will probably never know precisely how many people are gay, lesbian,\nbisexual, or transgendered. One problem is conceptual. For example, what does it\nmean to be gay or lesbian? Does one need to actually have sexual relations with a\nsame-sex partner to be considered gay? What if someone is attracted to same-sex\npartners but does not actually engage in sex with such persons? What if someone\nidentifies as heterosexual but engages in homosexual sex for money (as in certain\nforms of prostitution) or for power and influence (as in much prison sex)? These conceptual problems make it difficult to determine the extent of homosexuality\n(Gates, 2011).\nIt is difficult for several reasons to know exactly how many people are LGBT.\n\u2013 A gay couple watching the parade \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nA second problem is empirical. Even if we can settle on a definition of\nhomosexuality, how do we then determine how many people fit this definition?\nFor better or worse, our best evidence of the number of gays and lesbians in the\nUnited States comes from surveys that ask random samples of Americans various\nquestions about their sexuality. Although these are anonymous surveys, some\nindividuals may be reluctant to disclose their sexual activity and thoughts to an\ninterviewer. Still, scholars think that estimates from these surveys are fairly\naccurate but also that they probably underestimate by at least a small amount the\nnumber of gays and lesbians.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey carried out the first\nnotable attempt to estimate the number of gays and lesbians (Kinsey, Pomeroy, &\nMartin, 1948; Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard, 1953). His project interviewed\nmore than 11,000 white women and men about their sexual experiences,\nthoughts, and attractions, with each subject answering hundreds of questions.\nWhile most individuals had experiences and feelings that were exclusively\nheterosexual, a significant number had experiences and feelings that were either\nexclusively homosexual or both heterosexual and homosexual in varying degrees. These findings led Kinsey to reject the popular idea back then that a person is\nnecessarily either heterosexual or homosexual (or straight or gay, to use the\ncommon modern terms). As he wrote, \u201cIt is a characteristic of the human mind\nthat tries to dichotomize in its classification of phenomena\u2026Sexual behavior is\neither normal or abnormal, socially acceptable or unacceptable, heterosexual or\nhomosexual; and many persons do not want to believe that there are gradations\nin these matters from one to the other extreme\u201d (Kinsey et al., 1953, p. 469).\nPerhaps Kinsey\u2019s most significant and controversial finding was that gradations\ndid, in fact, exist between being exclusively heterosexual on the one hand and\nexclusively homosexual on the other hand. To reflect these gradations, he\ndeveloped the well-known Kinsey Scale, which ranks individuals on a continuum\nranging from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual).\nIn terms of specific numbers, Kinsey found that (a) 37 percent of males and 13\npercent of females had had at least one same-sex experience; (b) 10 percent of\nmales had mostly homosexual experiences between the ages of 16 and 55, while\nup to 6 percent of females had mostly homosexual experiences between the ages\nof 20 and 35; (c) 4 percent of males were exclusively homosexual after\nadolescence began, compared to 1\u20133 percent of females; and (d) 46 percent of\nmales either had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or\nhad been attracted to persons of both sexes, compared to 14 percent of females. An estimated 3.8 percent of the US adult population identifies as LGBT. This figure\namounts to about 9 million people.\nNathan Rupert \u2013 Crazy fun loving lesbian couple \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nMore recent research updates Kinsey\u2019s early findings and, more important, uses\nnationally representative samples of Americans (which Kinsey did not use). In\ngeneral, this research suggests that Kinsey overstated the numbers of Americans\nwho have had same-sex experiences and/or attractions. A widely cited survey\ncarried out in the early 1990s by researchers at the University of Chicago found\nthat 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women self-identified as gay/lesbian\nor bisexual, with greater percentages reporting having had sexual relations with\nsame-sex partners or being attracted to same-sex persons (see Table 5.1\n\u201cPrevalence of Homosexuality in the United States\u201d). In the 2010 General Social\nSurvey (GSS), 1.8 percent of men and 3.3 percent of women self-identified as\ngay/lesbian or bisexual. In the 2006\u20132008 National Survey of Family Growth\n(NSFG) conducted by the federal government (Chandra, Mosher, Copen, &\nSionean, 2011), 2.8 percent of men self-identified as gay or bisexual, compared to\n4.6 percent of women (ages 18\u201344 for both sexes).\nTable 5.1 Prevalence of Homosexuality in the United States\nMen Women\nActivity, attraction, or identity (%) (%)\nFind same-sex sexual relations appealing 4.5 5.6\nAttracted to people of same sex 6.2 4.4\nIdentify as gay or bisexual 2.8 1.4\nAt least one sex partner of same sex during past year\n2.7 1.3\namong those sexually active\nAt least one sex partner of same sex since turning 18 4.9 4.1 Source: Data from Laumann, E. O., Gagnon, J. H., Michael, R. T., & Michaels, S.\n(1994). The social organization of sexuality. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago\nPress.\nThese are all a lot of numbers, but demographer Gary J. Gates (2011) drew on the\nmost recent national survey evidence to come up with the following estimates for\nadults 18 and older:\n\uf0b7 3.5 percent of Americans identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and 0.3 percent\nare transgender; these figures add up to 3.8 percent of Americans, or 9 million\npeople, who are LGBT.\n\uf0b7 3.4 percent of women and 3.6 percent of men identify as LGB.\n\uf0b7 66.7 percent of LGB women identify as bisexual, and 33.3 percent identify as\nlesbian; 33.3 percent of LGB men identify as bisexual, and 66.7 percent identify\nas gay. LGB women are thus twice as likely as LGB men to identify as bisexual.\n\uf0b7 8.2 percent of Americans, or 19 million people, have engaged in same-sex\nsexual behavior, with women twice as likely as men to have done so.\n\uf0b7 11 percent of Americans, or 25.6 million people, report having some same-sex\nsexual attraction, with women twice as likely as men to report such attraction.\nThe overall picture from these estimates is clear: Self-identified LGBT people\ncomprise only a small percentage of the US population, but they amount to about\n9 million adults and undoubtedly a significant number of adolescents. In addition,\nthe total number of people who, regardless of their sexual orientation, have had a\nsame-sex experience is probably at least 19 million, and the number who have\nhad same-sex attraction is probably at least 25 million.\nSexual Orientation in Historical Perspective\nBased on what is known about homosexuality in past societies, it should be no\nsurprise that so many people in the United States identify as gay/lesbian or have\nhad same-sex experiences. This historical record is clear: Homosexuality has\nexisted since ancient times and in some societies has been rather common or at\nleast fully accepted as a normal form of sexual expression.\nIn the great city of Athens in ancient Greece, male homosexuality (to be more\nprecise, sexual relations between a man and a teenage boy and, less often,\nbetween a man and a man) was not only approved but even encouraged.\nAccording to classical scholar K. J. Dover (1989, p. 12), Athenian society \u201ccertainly regarded strong homosexual desire and emotion as normal,\u201d in part because it\nalso generally \u201centertained a low opinion of the intellectual capacity and staying-\npower of women.\u201d Louis Crompton (2003, p. 2), who wrote perhaps the definitive\nhistory of homosexuality, agrees that male homosexuality in ancient Greece was\ncommon and notes that \u201cin Greek history and literature\u2026the abundance of\naccounts of homosexual love overwhelms the investigator.\u201d He adds,\nGreek lyric poets sing of male love from almost the earliest fragments down to\nthe end of classical times\u2026Vase-painters portray scores of homoerotic scenes,\nhundreds of inscriptions celebrate the love of boys, and such affairs enter into the\nlives of a long catalogue of famous Greek statesmen, warriors, artists, and\nauthors. Though it has often been assumed that the love of males was a fashion\nconfined to a small intellectual elite during the age of Plato, in fact it was\npervasive throughout all levels of Greek society and held an honored place in\nGreek culture for more than a thousand years, that is, from before 600 B.C.E. to\nabout 400 C.E.\nMale homosexuality in ancient Rome was also common and accepted as normal\nsexuality, but it took a different form from than in ancient Greece. Ancient\nRomans disapproved of sexual relations between a man and a freeborn male\nyouth, but they approved of relations between a slave master and his youthful\nmale slave. Sexual activity of this type was common. As Crompton (2003, p. 80)\nwryly notes, \u201cOpportunities were ample for Roman masters\u201d because slaves\ncomprised about 40 percent of the population of ancient Rome. However, these\n\u201copportunities\u201d are best regarded as violent domination by slave masters over\ntheir slaves.\nBy the time Rome fell in 476 CE, Europe had become a Christian continent.\nInfluenced by several passages in the Bible that condemn homosexuality,\nEuropeans considered homosexuality a sin, and their governments outlawed\nsame-sex relations. If discovered, male homosexuals (or any men suspected of\nhomosexuality) were vulnerable to execution for the next fourteen centuries, and\nmany did lose their lives. During the Middle Ages, gay men and lesbians were\nstoned, burned at the stake, hanged, or beheaded, and otherwise abused and\nmistreated. Crompton (2003, p. 539) calls these atrocities a \u201croutine of terror\u201d\nand a \u201ckaleidoscope of horrors.\u201d Hitler\u2019s persecution of gay men several centuries\nafter the Middle Ages ended had ample precedent in European history. In contrast to the European treatment of gay men and lesbians, China and Japan\nfrom ancient times onward viewed homosexuality much more positively in what\nCrompton (2003, p. 215) calls an \u201cunselfconscious acceptance of same-sex\nrelations.\u201d He adds that male love in Japan during the 1500s was \u201ca national\ntradition\u2014one the Japanese thought natural and meritorious\u201d (Crompton, 2003,\np. 412) and very much part of the samurai (military nobility) culture of\npreindustrial Japan. In China, both male and female homosexuality were seen as\nnormal and even healthy sexual outlets. Because Confucianism, the major Chinese\nreligion when the Common Era began, considered women inferior, it considered\nmale friendships very important and thus may have unwittingly promoted same-\nsex relations among men. Various artistic and written records indicate that male\nhomosexuality was fairly common in China over the centuries, although the exact\nnumbers can never be known. When China began trading and otherwise\ncommunicating with Europe during the Ming dynasty, its tolerance for\nhomosexuality shocked and disgusted Catholic missionaries and other Europeans.\nSome European clergy and scientists even blamed earthquakes and other natural\ndisasters in China on this tolerance.\nIn addition to this body of work by historians, anthropologists have also studied\nsame-sex relations in small, traditional societies. In many of these societies,\nhomosexuality is both common and accepted as normal sexual behavior. In one\noverview of seventy-six societies, the authors found that almost two-thirds\nregarded homosexuality as \u201cnormal and socially acceptable for certain members\nof the community\u201d (Ford & Beach, 1951, p. 130). Among the Azande of East\nAfrica, for example, young warriors live with each other and are not allowed to\nmarry. During this time, they often have sex with younger boys. Among the\nSambia of New Guinea, young males live separately from females and have same-\nsex relations for at least a decade. It is felt that the boys would be less masculine\nif they continued to live with their mothers and that the semen of older males\nhelps young boys become strong and fierce (Edgerton, 1976).\nThis brief historical and anthropological overview provides ready evidence of\nwhat was said at its outset: Homosexuality has existed since ancient times and in\nsome societies has been rather common or at least fully accepted as a normal\nform of sexual expression. Although Western society, influenced by the Judeo-\nChristian tradition, has largely condemned homosexuality since Western\ncivilization began some 2,000 years ago, the great civilizations of ancient Greece\nand ancient China and Japan until the industrial age approved of homosexuality. In these civilizations, male homosexuality was fairly common, and female\nhomosexuality was far from unknown. Same-sex relations are also fairly common\nin many of the societies that anthropologists have studied. Although Western\nsocieties have long considered homosexuality sinful and unnatural and more\ngenerally have viewed it very negatively, the historical and anthropological record\ndemonstrates that same-sex relationships are far from rare. They thus must\nobjectively be regarded as normal expressions of sexuality.\nIn fact, some of the most famous individuals in Western political, literary, and\nartistic history certainly or probably engaged in same-sex relations, either\nsometimes or exclusively: Alexander the Great, Hans Christian Andersen, Marie\nAntoinette, Aristotle, Sir Francis Bacon, James Baldwin, Leonard Bernstein, Lord\nByron, Julius Caesar, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederick the Great, Leonardo de\nVinci, Herman Melville, Michelangelo, Plato, Cole Porter, Richard the Lionhearted,\nEleanor Roosevelt, Socrates, Gertrude Stein, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Henry David\nThoreau, Walt Whitman, Tennessee Williams, Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf, to\nname just a few. Regardless or perhaps in some cases because of their sexuality,\nthey all made great contributions to the societies in which they lived.\nExplaining Sexual Orientation\nWe have seen that it is difficult to determine the number of people who are\ngay/lesbian or bisexual. It is even more difficult to determine why some people\nhave these sexual orientations while most do not, and scholars disagree on the\n\u201ccauses\u201d of sexual orientation (Engle, McFalls, Gallagher, & Curtis, 2006; Sheldon,\nPfeffer, Jayaratne, Feldbaum, & Petty, 2007). Determining the origins of sexual\norientation is not just an academic exercise. When people believe that the roots\nof homosexuality are biological or that gays otherwise do not choose to be gay,\nthey are more likely to have positive or at least tolerant views of same-sex\nbehavior. When they believe that homosexuality is instead merely a personal\nchoice, they are more likely to disapprove of it (Sheldon et al., 2007). For this\nreason if for no other, it is important to know why some people are gay or\nbisexual while most are not.\nStudies of the origins of sexual orientation focus mostly on biological factors and\non social and cultural factors, and a healthy scholarly debate exists on the relative\nimportance of these two sets of factors. Biological Factors\nResearch points to certain genetic and other biological roots of sexual orientation\nbut is by no means conclusive. One line of research concerns genetics. Although\nno \u201cgay gene\u201d has been discovered, studies of identical twins find they are more\nlikely to have the same sexual orientation (gay or straight) than would be\nexpected from chance alone (Kendler, Thornton, Gilman, & Kessler, 2000; Santtila\net al., 2008). Because identical twins have the same DNA, this similarity suggests,\nbut does not prove, a genetic basis for sexual orientation. Keep in mind, however,\nthat any physical or behavioral trait that is totally due to genetics should show up\nin both twins or in neither twin. Because many identical twins do not have the\nsame sexual orientation, this dissimilarity suggests that genetics are far from the\nonly cause of sexual orientation, to the extent they cause it at all. Several\nmethodological problems also cast doubt on findings from many of these twin\nstudies. A recent review concluded that the case for a genetic cause of sexual\norientation is far from proven: \u201cFindings from genetic studies of homosexuality in\nhumans have been confusing\u2014contradictory at worst and tantalizing at best.\nDespite scholarly speculation, sexual orientation does not appear to be affected\nby the level of prenatal hormones.\nil-young ko \u2013 pregnant \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0. Another line of research concerns brain anatomy, as some studies find differences\nin the size and structure of the hypothalamus, which controls many bodily\nfunctions, in the brains of gays versus the brains of straights (Allen & Gorski,\n1992). However, other studies find no such differences (Lasco, Jordan, Edgar,\nPetito, & Byne, 2002). Complicating matters further, because sexual behavior can\naffect the hypothalamus (Breedlove, 1997), it is difficult to determine whether\nany differences that might be found reflect the influence of the hypothalamus on\nsexual orientation, or instead the influence of sexual orientation on the\nhypothalamus (Sheldon et al., 2007).\nA third line of biological research concerns hormonal balance in the womb, with\nscientists speculating that the level of prenatal androgen affects which sexual\norientation develops. Because prenatal androgen levels cannot be measured,\nstudies typically measure it only indirectly in the bodies of gays and straights by\ncomparing the lengths of certain fingers and bones that are thought to be related\nto prenatal androgen. Some of these studies suggest that gay men had lower\nlevels of prenatal androgen than straight men and that lesbians had higher levels\nof prenatal androgen than straight women, but other studies find no evidence of\nthis connection (Martin & Nguyen, 2004; Mustanski, Chivers, & Bailey, 2002). A\nrecent review concluded that the results of the hormone studies are \u201coften\ninconsistent\u201d and that \u201cthe notion that non-heterosexual preferences may reflect\n[deviations from normal prenatal hormonal levels] is not supported by the\navailable data\u201d (Rahman, 2005, p. 1057).\nSocial and Cultural Factors\nSociologists usually emphasize the importance of socialization over biology for the\nlearning of many forms of human behavior. In this view, humans are born with\n\u201cblank slates\u201d and thereafter shaped by their society and culture, and children are\nshaped by their parents, teachers, peers, and other aspects of their immediate\nsocial environment while they are growing up.\nGiven this standard sociological position, one might think that sociologists\ngenerally believe that people are gay or straight not because of their biology but\nbecause they learn to be gay or straight from their society, culture, and\nimmediate social environment. This, in fact, was a common belief of sociologists\nabout a generation ago (Engle et al., 2006). In a 1988 review article, two\nsociologists concluded that \u201cevidence that homosexuality is a social construction [learned from society and culture] is far more powerful than the evidence for a\nwidespread organic [biological] predisposition toward homosexual desire\u201d\n(Risman & Schwartz, 1988, p. 143). The most popular introductory sociology text\nof the era similarly declared, \u201cMany people, including some homosexuals, believe\nthat gays and lesbians are simply \u2018born that way.\u2019 But since we know that even\nheterosexuals are not \u2018born that way,\u2019 this explanation seems\nunlikely\u2026Homosexuality, like any other sexual behavior ranging from oral sex to\nsadomasochism to the pursuit of brunettes, is learned\u201d (Robertson, 1987, p. 243).\nHowever, sociologists\u2019 views of the origins of sexual orientation have apparently\nchanged since these passages were written. In a recent national survey of a\nrandom sample of sociologists, 22 percent said male homosexuality results from\nbiological factors, 38 percent said it results from both biological and\nenvironmental (learning) factors, and 39 percent said it results from\nenvironmental factors (Engle et al., 2006). Thus 60 percent (= 22 + 38) thought\nthat biology totally or partly explains male homosexuality, almost certainly a\nmuch higher figure than would have been found a generation ago had a similar\nsurvey been done.\nIn this regard, it is important to note that 77 percent (= 38 + 39) of the sociologists\nstill feel that environmental factors, or socialization, matter as well. Scholars who\nhold this view believe that sexual orientation is partly or totally learned from\none\u2019s society, culture, and immediate social environment. In this way of thinking,\nwe learn \u201cmessages\u201d from all these influences about whether it is OK or not OK to\nbe sexually attracted to someone from our own sex and/or to someone from the\nopposite sex. If we grow up with positive messages about same-sex attraction, we\nare more likely to acquire this attraction. If we grow up with negative messages\nabout same-sex attraction, we are less likely to acquire it and more likely to have\nheterosexual desire.\nIt is difficult to do the necessary type of research to test whether socialization\nmatters in this way, but the historical and cross-cultural evidence discussed\nearlier provides at least some support for this process. Homosexuality was\ngenerally accepted in ancient Greece, ancient China, and ancient Japan, and it\nalso seemed rather common in those societies. The same connection holds true in\nmany of the societies that anthropologists have studied. In contrast,\nhomosexuality was condemned in Europe from the very early part of the first millennium CE, and it seems to have been rather rare (although it is very possible\nthat many gays hid their sexual orientation for fear of persecution and death).\nSo where does this leave us? What are the origins of sexual orientation? The most\nhonest answer is that we do not yet know its origins. As we have seen, many\nscholars attribute sexual orientation to still unknown biological factor(s) over\nwhich individuals have no control, just as individuals do not decide whether they\nare left-handed or right-handed. Supporting this view, many gays say they\nrealized they were gay during adolescence, just as straights would say they\nrealized they were straight during their own adolescence; moreover, evidence\n(from toy, play, and clothing preferences) of future sexual orientation even\nappears during childhood (Rieger, Linsenmeier, Bailey, & Gygax, 2008). Other\nscholars say that sexual orientation is at least partly influenced by cultural norms,\nso that individuals are more likely to identify as gay or straight and be attracted to\ntheir same sex or opposite sex depending on the cultural views of sexual\norientation into which they are socialized as they grow up. At best, perhaps all we\ncan say is that sexual orientation stems from a complex mix of biological and\ncultural factors that remain to be determined.\nThe official stance of the American Psychological Association (APA) is in line with\nthis view. According to the APA, \u201cThere is no consensus among scientists about\nthe exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay, or\nlesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic,\nhormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no\nfindings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is\ndetermined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and\nnurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of\nchoice about their sexual orientation\u201d (American Psychological Association, 2008,\np. 2).\nAlthough the exact origins of sexual orientation remain unknown, the APA\u2019s last\nstatement is perhaps the most important conclusion from research on this issue:\nMost people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.\nBecause, as mentioned earlier, people are more likely to approve of or tolerate\nhomosexuality when they believe it is not a choice, efforts to educate the public\nabout this research conclusion should help the public become more accepting of\nLGBT behavior and individuals.\nKey Takeaways: An estimated 3.8 percent, or 9 million, Americans identify as LGBT.\nHomosexuality seems to have been fairly common and very much accepted in\nsome ancient societies as well as in many societies studied by anthropologists.\nScholars continue to debate the extent to which sexual orientation stems more\nfrom biological factors or from social and cultural factors and the extent to which\nsexual orientation is a choice or not a choice.\nReferences\nAllen, L.

There is no question that the\nBible condemns homosexuality, with perhaps the most quoted Biblical passages in\nthis regard found in Leviticus:\n\uf0b7 \u201cDo not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable\u201d (Leviticus\n18:22).\n\uf0b7 \u201cIf a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done\nwhat is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own\nheads\u201d (Leviticus 20:13). The Bible contains several passages that appear to condemn homosexuality.\nSean MacEntee \u2013 Bible \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe important question, though, is to what extent these passages should be\ninterpreted literally. Certainly very few people today believe that male\nhomosexuals should be executed, despite what Leviticus 20:13 declares. Still,\nmany people who condemn homosexuality cite passages like Leviticus 18:22 and\nLeviticus 20:13 as reasons for their negative views.\nThis is not a theology text, but it is appropriate to mention briefly two points that\nmany religious scholars make about what the Bible says about homosexuality\n(Helminiak, 2000; Via & Gagnon, 2003). First, English translations of the Bible\u2019s\nantigay passages may distort their original meanings, and various contextual\nstudies of the Bible suggest that these passages did not, in fact, make blanket\ncondemnations about homosexuality.\nSecond, and perhaps more important, most people \u201cpick and choose\u201d what they\ndecide to believe from the Bible and what they decide not to believe. Although\nthe Bible is a great source of inspiration for many people, most individuals are\ninconsistent when it comes to choosing which Biblical beliefs to believe and about\nwhich beliefs not to believe. For example, if someone chooses to disapprove of\nhomosexuality because the Bible condemns it, why does this person not also\nchoose to believe that gay men should be executed, which is precisely what\nLeviticus 20:13 dictates? Further, the Bible calls for many practices and specifies many penalties that even very devout people do not follow or believe. For\nexample, most people except for devout Jews do not keep kosher, even though\nthe Bible says that everyone should do this, and most people certainly do not\nbelieve people who commit adultery, engage in premarital sex, or work on the\nSabbath should be executed, even though the Bible says that such people should\nbe executed. Citing the inconsistency with which most people follow Biblical\ncommands, many religious scholars say it is inappropriate to base public views\nabout homosexuality on what the Bible says about it.\nWe now turn our attention to social science evidence on views about LGBT\nbehavior and individuals. We first look at negative attitudes and then discuss a\nfew other views.\nThe Extent of Heterosexism in the United States\nWe saw in earlier chapters that racism refers to negative views about, and\npractices toward, people of color, and that sexism refers to negative views about,\nand practices toward, women. Heterosexism is the analogous term for negative\nviews about, and discriminatory practices toward, LGBT individuals and their\nsexual behavior.\nThere are many types of negative views about LGBT and thus many ways to\nmeasure heterosexism. The General Social Survey (GSS), given regularly to a\nnational sample of US residents, asks whether respondents think that \u201csexual\nrelations between two adults of the same sex\u201d are always wrong, almost always\nwrong, sometimes wrong, or not wrong at all. In 2010, almost 46 percent of\nrespondents said same-sex relations are \u201calways wrong,\u201d and 43 percent\nresponded they are \u201cnot wrong at all\u201d (see Figure 5.1 \u201cOpinion about \u201cSexual\nRelations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 2010\u201d).\nFigure 5.1 Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d\n2010 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved\nfrom http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nAs another way of measuring heterosexism, the Gallup poll asks whether \u201cgay or\nlesbian relations\u201d are \u201cmorally acceptable or morally wrong\u201d (Gallup, 2011). In\n2011, 56 percent of Gallup respondents answered \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d while 39\npercent replied \u201cmorally wrong.\u201d\nAlthough Figure 5.1 \u201cOpinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the\nSame Sex,\u201d 2010\u201d shows that 57.3 percent of Americans (= 45.7 + 3.7 + 7.9) think\nthat same-sex relations are at least sometimes wrong, public views regarding\nLGBT have notably become more positive over the past few decades. We can see\nevidence of this trend in Figure 5.2 \u201cChanges in Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations\nbetween Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 1973\u20132010\u201d, which shows that the\npercentage of GSS respondents who say same-sex relations are \u201calways wrong\u201d\nhas dropped considerably since the GSS first asked this question in 1973, while\nthe percentage who respond \u201cnot wrong at all\u201d has risen considerably, with both\nthese changes occurring since the early 1990s. Figure 5.2 Changes in Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the\nSame Sex,\u201d 1973\u20132010\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1973\u20132010). Retrieved\nfrom http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nTrends in Gallup data confirm that public views regarding homosexuality have\nbecome more positive in recent times. Recall that 56 percent of Gallup\nrespondents in 2011 called same-sex relations \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d while 39\npercent replied \u201cmorally wrong.\u201d Ten years earlier, these percentages were 40\npercent and 53 percent, respectively, representing a marked shift in public\nopinion in just a decade.\nCorrelates of Heterosexism\nScholars have investigated the sociodemographic factors that predict heterosexist\nattitudes. Reflecting the sociological axiom that our social backgrounds influence\nour attitudes and behavior, several aspects of our social backgrounds influence\nviews about gays and lesbians. Among the most influential of these factors are\ngender, age, education, region of residence, and religion. We can illustrate each\nof these influences with the GSS question on whether same-sex relations are\nwrong, using the response \u201calways wrong\u201d as a measure of heterosexism.\n\uf0b7 Gender. Men are somewhat more heterosexist than women (see\npart a of Figure 5.3 \u201cCorrelates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-\nSex Relations Are \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\u201d). \uf0b7 Age.

Less educated people are considerably more heterosexist than\nmore educated people (see part c of Figure 5.3 \u201cCorrelates of Heterosexism\n(Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\u201d).\n\uf0b7 Region of residence.

Because young people are especially likely to be accepting of homosexuality,\nattitudes about LGBT issues should continue to improve as the older population\npasses away.\nhepingting \u2013 CB106492 \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe age difference in heterosexism is perhaps particularly interesting. Many\nstudies find that young people\u2014those younger than 30\u2014are especially accepting\nof homosexuality and of same-sex marriage. As older people, who have more\nnegative views, pass away, it is likely that public opinion as a whole will become\nmore accepting of homosexuality and issues related to it. Scholars think this trend\nwill further the legalization of same-sex marriage and the establishment of other\nlaws and policies that will reduce the discrimination and inequality that the LGBT\ncommunity experiences (Gelman, Lax, & Phillips, 2010).\nOpinion on the Origins of Sexual Orientation\nEarlier we discussed scholarly research on the origins of sexual orientation. In this\nregard, it is interesting to note that the US public is rather split over the issue of\nwhether sexual orientation is in-born or instead the result of environmental\nfactors, and also over the closely related issue of whether it is something people\nare able to choose. A 2011 Gallup poll asked, \u201cIn your view, is being gay or lesbian\nsomething a person is born with, or due to factors such as upbringing and environment?\u201d (Jones, 2011). Forty percent of respondents replied that sexual\norientation is in-born, while 42 percent said it stems from upbringing and/or\nenvironment. The 40 percent in-born figure represented a sharp increase from\nthe 13 percent figure that Gallup obtained when it first asked this question in\n1977. A 2010 CBS News poll, asked, \u201cDo you think being homosexual is something\npeople choose to be, or do you think it is something they cannot change?\u201d (CBS\nNews, 2010). About 36 percent of respondents replied that homosexuality is a\nchoice, while 51 percent said it is something that cannot be changed, with the\nremainder saying they did not know or providing no answer. The 51 percent\n\u201ccannot change\u201d figure represented an increase from the 43 percent figure that\nCBS News obtained when it first asked this question in 1993.\nOther Views\nThe next section discusses several issues that demonstrate inequality based on\nsexual orientation. Because these issues are so controversial, public opinion polls\nhave included many questions about them. We examine public views on some of\nthese issues in this section.\nA first issue is same-sex marriage. The 2010 GSS asked whether respondents\nagree that \u201chomosexual couples should have the right to marry one another\u201d:\n53.3 percent of respondents who expressed an opinion agreed with this\nstatement, and 46.7 percent disagreed, indicating a slight majority in favor of\nlegalizing same-sex marriage (SDA, 2010). In 2011, an ABC News/Washington Post\npoll asked about same-sex marriage in a slightly different way: \u201cDo you think it\nshould be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?\u201d A majority,\n51 percent, of respondents replied \u201clegal,\u201d and 45 percent replied \u201cillegal\u201d\n(Langer, 2011). Although only bare majorities now favor legalizing same-sex\nmarriage, public views on this issue have become much more positive in recent\nyears. We can see dramatic evidence of this trend in Figure 5.4 \u201cChanges in\nOpinion about Same-Sex Marriage, 1988\u20132010 (Percentage Agreeing That Same-\nSex Couples Should Have the Right to Marry; Those Expressing No Opinion\nExcluded from Analysis)\u201d, which shows that the percentage agreeing with the GSS\nquestion on the right of same-sex couples to marry has risen considerably during\nthe past quarter-century. Figure 5.4 Changes in Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage, 1988\u20132010 (Percentage\nAgreeing That Same-Sex Couples Should Have the Right to Marry; Those\nExpressing No Opinion Excluded from Analysis)\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1988\u20132010). Retrieved\nfrom http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nIn a related topic, public opinion about same-sex couples as parents has also\nbecome more favorable in recent years. In 2007, 50 percent of the public said that\nthe increasing number of same-sex couples raising children was \u201ca bad thing\u201d for\nsociety. By 2011, this figure had declined to 35 percent, a remarkable decrease in\njust four years (Pew Research Center, 2011).\nA second LGBT issue that has aroused public debate involves the right of gays and\nlesbians to serve in the military, which we discuss further later in this chapter. A\n2010 ABC News/Washington Post poll asked whether \u201cgays and lesbians who do\nnot publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be allowed to serve in the\nmilitary\u201d (Mokrzycki, 2010). About 83 percent of respondents replied they\n\u201cshould be allowed,\u201d up considerably from the 63 percent figure that this poll\nobtained when it first asked this question in 1993 (Saad, 2008).\nA third issue involves the right of gays and lesbians to be free from job\ndiscrimination based on their sexual orientation, as federal law does not prohibit\nsuch discrimination. A 2008 Gallup poll asked whether \u201chomosexuals should or\nshould not have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.\u201d About 89 percent of\nrespondents replied that there \u201cshould be\u201d such rights, and only 8 percent said there \u201cshould not be\u201d such rights. The 89 percent figure represented a large\nincrease from the 56 percent figure that Gallup obtained in 1977 when Gallup first\nasked this question.\nTwo Brief Conclusions on Public Attitudes\nWe have had limited space to discuss public views on LGBT topics, but two brief\nconclusions are apparent from the discussion. First, although the public remains\nsharply divided on various LGBT issues and much of the public remains\nheterosexist, views about LGBT behavior and certain rights of the LGBT\ncommunity have become markedly more positive in recent decades. This trend\nmatches what we saw in earlier chapters regarding views concerning people of\ncolor and women. The United States has without question become less racist, less\nsexist, and less heterosexist since the 1970s.\nSecond, certain aspects of people\u2019s sociodemographic backgrounds influence the\nextent to which they do, or do not, hold heterosexist attitudes. This conclusion is\nnot surprising, as sociology has long since demonstrated that social backgrounds\ninfluence many types of attitudes and behaviors, but the influence we saw earlier\nof sociodemographic factors on heterosexism was striking nonetheless. These\nfactors would no doubt also be relevant for understanding differences in views on\nother LGBT issues. As you think about your own views, perhaps you can recognize\nwhy you might hold these views based on your gender, age, education, and other\naspects of your social background.\nKey Takeaways:\nViews about LGBT behavior have improved markedly since a generation ago.\nMore than half the US public now supports same-sex marriage.\nMales, older people, the less educated, Southerners, and the more religious\nexhibit higher levels of heterosexism than their counterparts.\nReferences\nCBS News.

Inequality Based on Sexual Orientation\nLearning Objectives:\nUnderstand the behavioral, psychological, and health effects of bullying and other\nmistreatment of the LGBT community.\nEvaluate the arguments for and against same-sex marriage.\nProvide three examples of heterosexual privilege.\nUntil just a decade ago, individuals who engaged in consensual same-sex relations\ncould be arrested in many states for violating so-called sodomy laws. The US\nSupreme Court, which had upheld such laws in 1986, finally outlawed them in\n2003 in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 US 558, by a 6\u20133 vote. The majority opinion of the\ncourt declared that individuals have a constitutional right under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to engage in consensual, private sexual activity.\nUntil the Supreme Court\u2019s Lawrence v. Texas ruling just a decade ago, individuals\nwho engaged in consensual same-sex relations could be arrested in many states.\nphilippe leroyer \u2013 Kiss In (08) \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nDespite this landmark ruling, the LGBT community continues to experience many\ntypes of problems. In this regard, sexual orientation is a significant source of social inequality, just as race/ethnicity, gender, and social class are sources of\nsocial inequality. We examine manifestations of inequality based on sexual\norientation in this section.\nBullying and Violence\nThe news story that began this chapter concerned the reported beatings of two\ngay men. Bullying and violence against adolescents and adults thought or known\nto be gay or lesbian constitute perhaps the most serious manifestation of\ninequality based on sexual orientation. According to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (2011), 1,277 hate crimes (violence and/or property destruction)\nagainst gays and lesbians occurred in 2010, although this number is very likely an\nunderestimate because many hate crime victims do not report their victimization\nto the police. An estimated 25 percent of gay men have been physically or\nsexually assaulted because of their sexual orientation (Egan, 2010), and some\nhave been murdered. Matthew Shepard was one of these victims. He was a\nstudent at the University of Wyoming in October 1998 when he was kidnapped by\ntwo young men who tortured him, tied him to a fence, and left him to die. When\nfound almost a day later, he was in a coma, and he died a few days later.\nShepard\u2019s murder prompted headlines around the country and is credited with\nwinning public sympathy for the problems experienced by the LGBT community\n(Loffreda, 2001).\nGay teenagers and straight teenagers thought to be gay are very often the targets\nof taunting, bullying, physical assault, and other abuse in schools and elsewhere\n(Denizet-Lewis, 2009). Survey evidence indicates that 85 percent of LGBT students\nreport being verbally harassed at school, and 40 percent report being verbally\nharassed; 72 percent report hearing antigay slurs frequently or often at school; 61\npercent feel unsafe at school, with 30 percent missing at least one day of school\nin the past month for fear of their safety; and 17 percent are physically assaulted\nto the point they need medical attention (Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz, & Bartkiewicz,\n2010).\nThe bullying, violence, and other mistreatment experienced by gay teens have\nsignificant educational and mental health effects. The most serious consequence\nis suicide, as a series of suicides by gay teens in fall 2010 reminded the nation.\nDuring that period, three male teenagers in California, Indiana, and Texas killed\nthemselves after reportedly being victims of antigay bullying, and a male college student also killed himself after his roommate broadcast a live video of the\nstudent making out with another male (Talbot, 2010).\nIn other effects, LGBT teens are much more likely than their straight peers to skip\nschool; to do poorly in their studies; to drop out of school; and to experience\ndepression, anxiety, and low self-esteem (Mental Health America, 2011). These\nmental health problems tend to last at least into their twenties (Russell, Ryan,\nToomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011). According to a 2011 report by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), LGBT teens are also much more likely to\nengage in risky and/or unhealthy behaviors such as using tobacco, alcohol, and\nother drugs, having unprotected sex, and even not using a seatbelt (Kann et al.,\n2011). Commenting on the report, a CDC official said, \u201cThis report should be a\nwake-up call. We are very concerned that these students face such dramatic\ndisparities for so many different health risks\u201d (Melnick, 2011).\nIronically, despite the bullying and other mistreatment that LBGT teens receive at\nschool, they are much more likely to be disciplined for misconduct than straight\nstudents accused of similar misconduct. This disparity is greater for girls than for\nboys. The reasons for the disparity remain unknown but may stem from\nunconscious bias against gays and lesbians by school officials. As a scholar in\neducational psychology observed, \u201cTo me, it is saying there is some kind of\ninternal bias that adults are not aware of that is impacting the punishment of this\ngroup\u201d (St. George, 2010). This candlelight vigil honored the memory of Matthew Shepard, a gay college\nstudent, who was tortured, tied, to a fence, and left to die in Wyoming in 1998.\nHe was in a coma when he was found and died a few days later.\nElvert Barnes \u2013 21.MatthewShepard.CandleVigil.WDC.14October1998 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nChildren and Our Future\nThe Homeless Status of LGBT Teens\nMany LGBT teens are taunted, bullied, and otherwise mistreated at school. As the\ntext discusses, this mistreatment affects their school performance and\npsychological well-being, and some even drop out of school as a result. We often\nthink of the home as a haven from the realities of life, but the lives of many gay\nteens are often no better at home. If they come out (disclose their sexual\norientation) to their parents, one or both parents often reject them. Sometimes\nthey kick their teen out of the home, and sometimes the teen leaves because the\nhome environment has become intolerable. Regardless of the reason, a large\nnumber of LGBT teens become homeless. They may be living in the streets, but\nthey may also be living with a friend, at a homeless shelter, or at some other\nvenue. But the bottom line is that they are not living at home with a parent.\nThe actual number of homeless LGBT teens will probably never be known, but a\nstudy in Massachusetts of more than 6,300 high school students was the first to\nestimate the prevalence of their homelessness using a representative sample. The\nstudy found that 25 percent of gay or lesbian teens and 15 percent of bisexual\nteens are homeless in the state, compared to only 3 percent of heterosexual\nteens. Fewer than 5 percent of the students in the study identified themselves as\nLGB, but they accounted for 19 percent of all the homeless students who were\nsurveyed. Regardless of their sexual orientation, some homeless teens live with a\nparent or guardian, but the study found that homeless LGBT teens were more\nlikely than their heterosexual counterparts to be living without a parent.\nBeing homeless adds to the problems that many LGBT teens already experience.\nRegardless of sexual orientation, homeless people of all ages are at greater risk\nfor victimization by robbers and other offenders, hunger, substance abuse, and\nmental health problems.\nThe study noted that LGBT teen homelessness may be higher in other states\nbecause attitudes about LGBT status are more favorable in Massachusetts than in\nmany other states. Because the study was administered to high school students, it may have undercounted LGBT teens, who are more likely to be absent from\nschool.\nThese methodological limitations should not obscure the central message of the\nstudy as summarized by one of its authors: \u201cThe high risk of homelessness among\nsexual minority teens is a serious problem requiring immediate attention. These\nteens face enormous risks and all types of obstacles to succeeding in school and\nare in need of a great deal of assistance.\u201d\nSources: Connolly, 2011; Corliss, Goodenow, Nichols, & Austin, 2011\nEmployment Discrimination\nFederal law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, nationality, sex,\nor religion. Notice that this list does not include sexual orientation. It is entirely\nlegal under federal law for employers to refuse to hire LGBT individuals or those\nperceived as LGBT, to fire an employee who is openly LGBT or perceived as LGBT,\nor to refuse to promote such an employee. Twenty-one states do prohibit\nemployment discrimination based on sexual orientation, but that leaves twenty-\nnine states that do not prohibit such discrimination. Employers in these states are\nentirely free to refuse to hire, fire, or refuse to promote LGBT people (openly\nLGBT or perceived as LGBT) as they see fit. In addition, only fifteen states prohibit\nemployment discrimination based on gender identity (transgender), which leaves\nthirty-five states in which employers may practice such discrimination (Human\nRights Campaign, 2011).\nThe Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit job\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, has been proposed\nin Congress but has not come close to passing. In response to the absence of legal\nprotection for LGBT employees, many companies have instituted their own\npolicies. As of March 2011, 87 percent of the Fortune 500 companies, the largest\n500 corporations in the United States, had policies prohibiting sexual orientation\ndiscrimination, and 46 percent had policies prohibiting gender identity\ndiscrimination (Human Rights Campaign, 2011).\nNational survey evidence shows that many LGBT people have, in fact, experienced\nworkplace discrimination (Sears & Mallory, 2011). In the 2008 GSS, 27.1 percent\nof LGB respondents said they had been verbally harassed at work during the past\nfive years, and 7.1 percent said they had been either fired or not hired during the same period (SDA, 2008). In other surveys that are not based on nationally\nrepresentative samples, the percentage of LGB respondents who report\nworkplace harassment or discrimination exceeds the GSS\u2019s figures. Not\nsurprisingly, more than one-third of LGB employees say they conceal their sexual\norientation in their workplace. Transgender people appear to experience more\nemployment problems than LGB people, as 78 percent of transgender\nrespondents in one study reported some form of workplace harassment or\ndiscrimination. Scholars have also conducted field experiments in which they send\nout resumes or job applicants to prospective employers. The resumes are\nidentical except that some mention the applicant is LGB, while the others do not\nindicate sexual orientation. The job applicants similarly either say they are LGB or\ndo not say this. The LGB resumes and applicants are less likely than their non-LGB\ncounterparts to receive a positive response from prospective employers.\nLGBT people who experience workplace harassment and discrimination suffer in\nother ways as well (Sears & Mallory, 2011). Compared to LGBT employees who do\nnot experience these problems, they are more likely to have various mental\nhealth issues, to be less satisfied with their jobs, and to have more absences from\nwork.\nApplying Social Research\nHow Well Do the Children of Same-Sex Couples Fare?\nMany opponents of same-sex marriage claim that children are better off if they\nare raised by both a mother and a father and that children of same-sex couples\nfare worse as a result. As the National Organization for Marriage (National\nOrganization for Marriage, 2011) states, \u201cTwo men might each be a good father,\nbut neither can be a mom. The ideal for children is the love of their own mom and\ndad. No same-sex couple can provide that.\u201d\nAddressing this contention, social scientists have studied the children of same-sex\ncouples and compared them to the children of heterosexual parents. Although it\nis difficult to have random, representative samples of same-sex couples\u2019 children,\na growing number of studies find that these children fare at least as well\npsychologically and in other respects as heterosexual couples\u2019 children.\nPerhaps the most notable published paper in this area appeared in the American\nSociological Review, the preeminent sociology journal, in 2001. The authors,\nJudith Stacey and Timothy J. Biblarz, reviewed almost two dozen studies that had been done of same-sex couples\u2019 children. All these studies yielded the central\nconclusion that the psychological well-being of these children is no worse than\nthat of heterosexual couples\u2019 children. As the authors summarized this conclusion\nand its policy implications, \u201cBecause every relevant study to date shows that\nparental sexual orientation per se has no measurable effect on the quality of\nparent-child relationships or on children\u2019s mental health or social adjustment,\nthere is no evidentiary basis for considering parental sexual orientation in\ndecisions about children\u2019s \u2018best interest.\u2019\u201d\nBiblarz and Stacey returned to this issue in a 2010 article in the Journal of\nMarriage and the Family, the preeminent journal in its field. This time they\nreviewed almost three dozen studies published since 1990 that compared the\nchildren of same-sex couples (most of them lesbian parents) to those of\nheterosexual couples. They again found that the psychological well-being and\nsocial adjustment of same-sex couples\u2019 children was at least as high as those of\nheterosexual couples\u2019 children, and they even found some evidence that children\nof lesbian couples fare better in some respects than those of heterosexual\ncouples. Although the authors acknowledged that two parents are generally\nbetter for children than one parent, they concluded that the sexual orientation of\nthe parents makes no difference overall. As they summarized the body of\nresearch on this issue: \u201cResearch consistently has demonstrated that despite\nprejudice and discrimination children raised by lesbians develop as well as their\npeers. Across the standard panoply of measures, studies find far more similarities\nthan differences among children with lesbian and heterosexual parents, and the\nrare differences mainly favor the former.\u201d\nThis body of research, then, contributes in important ways to the national debate\non same-sex marriage. If children of same-sex couples indeed fare well, as the\navailable evidence indicates, concern about these children\u2019s welfare should play\nno part in this debate.\nSame-Sex Marriage\nSame-sex marriage has been one of the most controversial social issues in recent\nyears. Nearly 650,000 same-sex couples live together in the United States (Gates,\n2012). Many of them would like to marry, but most are not permitted by law to\nmarry. In May 2012, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage. The issue of same-sex marriage has aroused much controversy in recent years. As\nof June 2012, same-sex couples could marry in only seven states and the District\nof Columbia.\nElvert Barnes \u2013 70a Marriage Equality US Capitol \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nWe saw earlier that a narrow margin of Americans now favors the right of same-\nsex couples to marry, and that public opinion in favor of same-sex marriage has\nincreased greatly in recent times. As of June 2012, same-sex marriage was legal in\nseven states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New\nYork, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia. Nine other states\npermitted same-sex couples to form civil unions or domestic partnerships, which\nprovide some or many of the various legal benefits that married spouses enjoy. In\nthe remaining thirty-five states, same-sex couples may not legally marry or form\ncivil unions or domestic partnerships. The federal Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA), passed in 1996 (and under legal dispute at the time of this writing),\nprohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriage. This means that even when\nsame-sex couples legally marry because their state allows them to, they do not\nenjoy the various federal tax, inheritance, and other benefits that married couples\nenjoy. Most of the states that do not allow same-sex marriage also have laws that\nprohibit recognition of same-sex marriages performed in the states that allow\nthem. Arguments against same-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriage make at\nleast three central points (Emrich, 2009; National Organization for Marriage,\n2011). First, and in no particular order, marriage is intended to procreate the\nspecies, and same-sex couples cannot reproduce. Second, the children that same-\nsex couples do have through adoption or artificial means experience various\npsychological problems because their parents are gay or lesbian and/or because\nthey do not have both a father and a mother. Third, allowing gays and lesbians to\nmarry would undermine the institution of marriage.\nArguments for same-sex marriage. In reply, proponents of same-sex marriage\nmake their own points (Barkan, Marks, & Milardo, 2009; Human Rights Campaign,\n2009). First, many heterosexual couples are allowed to marry even though they\nwill not have children, either because they are not able to have them, because\nthey do not wish to have them, or because they are beyond childbearing age.\nSecond, studies show that children of same-sex couples are at least as\npsychologically healthy as the children of opposite-sex couples (see Note 5.12\n\u201cChildren and Our Future\u201d). Third, there is no evidence that legalizing same-sex\nmarriage has weakened the institution of marriage in the few states and other\nnations that have legalized it (see Note 5.14 \u201cLessons from Other Societies\u201d).\nLessons from Other Societies\nSame-Sex Marriage in the Netherlands\nAt the time of this writing, same-sex marriage was legal in ten nations: Argentina,\nBelgium, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa,\nand Sweden. All these nations have legalized it since 2001, when the Netherlands\nbecame the first country to do so. Because more than a decade has passed since\nthis notable event, it is informative to examine how, if at all, legalization has\naffected the lives of gays and lesbians and the institution of marriage itself in the\nNetherlands.\nOne thing is clear: There is no evidence that the institution of marriage in the\nNetherlands has in any respect become weaker because same-sex couples have\nbeen allowed to marry since 2001. Heterosexual couples continue to marry, and\nthe institution appears at least as strong as it was before 2001. It also seems clear\nthat same-sex marriages are working and that same-sex married couples\u2019 unions\nare accepted as normal features of contemporary Dutch life. As Vera Bergkamp, a gay rights leader in the Netherlands said, \u201cGay marriage is Holland\u2019s best export\nbecause we have shown that it is possible.\u201d\nIn an interesting development, same-sex couples have not exactly rushed to\nmarry. There was an initial spurt in 2001, and many such couples have married\nsince. However, the Dutch government estimates that only 20 percent of same-\nsex couples have married compared to 80 percent of heterosexual couples.\nThree reasons may account for this disparity. First, there is less pressure from\nfamily and friends for same-sex couples to marry than for heterosexual couples to\nmarry. As Bergkamp put it, \u201cFor heterosexuals, it\u2019s normal when you\u2019re in a\nsteady relationship for more than a year, that a lot of people start asking, \u2018well\nwhen are you getting married?\u2019 With two women or two men you don\u2019t get that\nyet.\u201d Second, fewer same-sex couples than heterosexual couples decide to marry\nin order to have children. Third, gays and lesbians in the Netherlands are thought\nto be somewhat more individualistic than their heterosexual counterparts.\nThe same-sex couples who have married in the Netherlands seem happy to have\ndone so, at least according to anecdotal evidence. As one same-sex spouse\nreflected on her marriage, \u201cIt was a huge step. For me it was incredible\u2026I\u2019d been\nto my brother\u2019s wedding and my sister\u2019s wedding and their spouses were\nwelcomed into the family. Now finally I was able to have my family take my\npartner in. The moment we got married there was a switch, she was now one of\nus.\u201d\nThe experience of the Netherlands is mirrored in the other nine nations that have\nlegalized same-sex marriage. Legalization seems to be working from all accounts,\nand the institution of marriage seems to be thriving at least as well as in other\nnations. As the first openly gay member of the Dutch parliament who played a key\nrole in legalization wryly described its outcome, \u201cHeterosexual couples did not\nturn away from the institution of marriage, and nor did the world isolate my\ncountry. After the Netherlands acted, civilization as we know it didn\u2019t end.\u201d As the\nUnited States continues to debate same-sex marriage, it has much to learn from\nthe Netherlands and the other nations that have legalized this form of marriage.\nSources: Ames, 2011; Badgett, 2009; Dittrich, 2011\nAlthough the children of same-sex couples fare at least as well as those of\nheterosexual couples, it is still difficult in many states for same-sex couples to\nadopt a child. Two states at the time of this writing, Mississippi and Utah, prohibit\nadoptions by same-sex couples, but half of the other states make it very difficult\nfor these adoptions to occur (Tavernise, 2011). For example, in some states social workers are required to prefer married heterosexual couples over same-sex\ncouples in adoption decisions. Moreover, several states require that a couple\nmust be married to be adopted; in these states, a single gay or lesbian may adopt,\nbut not a same-sex couple. Still, adoptions by same-sex couples have become\nmore numerous in recent years because of the number of children waiting for\nadoption and because public opinion about gays and lesbians has become more\nfavorable.\nCosts of the Illegality of Same-Sex Marriage\nMarriage provides many legal rights, benefits, and responsibilities for the two\nspouses. Because same-sex couples are not allowed to marry in most states and,\neven if they do marry, are currently denied federal recognition of their marriage,\nthey suffer materially in numerous ways. In fact, there are more than 1,000\nfederal rights that heterosexual married couples receive that no married same-\nsex couple is allowed to receive (Shell, 2011).\nWe have space here to list only a few of the many costs that the illegality of same-\nsex marriage imposes on same-sex couples who cannot marry and on the same-\nsex couples whose marriages are not federally recognized (Human Rights\nCampaign, 2009):\n\uf0b7 Spouses have visitation rights if one of them is hospitalized as well as the right\nto make medical decisions if one spouse is unable to do so; same-sex couples\ndo not have these visitation rights.\n\uf0b7 Same-sex couples cannot file joint federal tax returns or joint state tax returns\n(in the states that do not recognize same-sex marriage), potentially costing\neach couple thousands of dollars every year in taxes they would not have to\npay if they were able to file jointly.\n\uf0b7 Spouses receive Social Security survivor benefits averaging more than $5,500\nannually when a spouse dies; same-sex couples do not receive these benefits.\n\uf0b7 Many employers who provide health insurance coverage for the spouse of an\nemployee do not provide this coverage for a same-sex partner; when they do\nprovide this coverage, the employee must pay taxes on the value of the\ncoverage. \uf0b7 When a spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits the deceased spouse\u2019s\nproperty without paying estate taxes; the surviving partner of a same-sex\ncouple must pay estate taxes.\nNotice that many of these costs are economic. It is difficult to estimate the exact\neconomic costs of the illegality of same-sex marriage, but one analysis estimated\nthat these costs can range from $41,000 to as much as $467,000 over the lifetime\nof a same-sex couple, depending on their income, state of residence, and many\nother factors (Bernard & Leber, 2009).\nMilitary Service\nLGBT individuals traditionally were not permitted to serve in the US military. If\nthey remained in the closet (hid evidence of their sexual orientation), of course,\nthey could serve with impunity, but many gays and lesbians in the military were\ngiven dishonorable discharges when their sexual orientation was discovered.\nThose who successfully remained in the closet lived under continual fear that\ntheir sexual orientation would become known and they would be ousted from the\nmilitary.\nAs a presidential candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton said he would end the ban on\nLGBT people in the military. After his election, his intention to do so was met with\nfierce opposition by military leaders, much of the Congress, and considerable\npublic opinion. As a compromise, in 1993 the government established the so-\ncalled don\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-tell (DADT) policy. DADT protected members of the\nmilitary from being asked about their sexual orientation, but it also stipulated that\nthey would be discharged from the military if they made statements or engaged\nin behavior that indicated an LGBT orientation. Because DADT continued the\nmilitary ban on LGBT people, proponents of allowing them to serve in the military\nopposed the policy and continued to call for the elimination of any restrictions\nregarding sexual orientation for military service.\nIn response to a lawsuit, a federal judge in 2010 ruled that DADT was\nunconstitutional. Meanwhile, Barack Obama had also called for the repeal of\nDADT, both as a presidential candidate and then as president. In late 2010,\nCongress passed legislation repealing DADT, and President Obama signed the\nlegislation, which took effect in September 2011. Official discrimination against\ngays and lesbians in the military has thus ended, and they may now serve openly\nin the nation\u2019s armed forces. It remains to be seen, however, whether they will be able to serve without facing negative experiences such as verbal and physical\nabuse.\nPhysical and Mental Health\nIt is well known that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome) racked the LGBT community beginning in the\n1980s. Many gays and lesbians eventually died from AIDS-related complications,\nand HIV and AIDS remain serious illnesses for gays and straights alike. An\nestimated 1.2 million Americans now have HIV, and about 35,000 have AIDS.\nAlmost 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with HIV annually, and more than half of\nthese new cases are men who have had sex with other men. Fortunately, HIV can\nnow be controlled fairly well by appropriate medical treatment (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2011).\nIt is less well known that LGBT adults have higher rates than straight adults of\nother physical health problems and also of mental health problems (Frost,\nLehavot, & Meyer, 2011; Institute of Medicine, 2011). These problems are\nthought to stem from the stress that the LGBT community experiences from living\nin a society in which they frequently encounter verbal and physical harassment,\njob discrimination, a need for some to conceal their sexual identity, and lack of\nequal treatment arising from the illegality of same-sex marriage. We saw earlier\nthat LGBT secondary school students experience various kinds of educational and\nmental health issues because of the mistreatment they encounter. By the time\nLGBT individuals reach their adult years, the various stressors they have\nexperienced at least since adolescence have begun to take a toll on their physical\nand mental health. The stress of being LGBT in a society that disapproves of this sexual orientation is\nthought to account for the greater likelihood of LGBT people to have physical and\nmental health problems.\nPatrik Nygren \u2013 LGBT rights \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nBecause stress is thought to compromise immune systems, LGBT individuals on\nthe average have lower immune functioning and lower perceived physical health\nthan straight individuals. Because stress impairs mental health, they are also more\nlikely to have higher rates of depression, loneliness, low self-esteem, and other\npsychiatric and psychological problems, including a tendency to attempt suicide\n(Sears & Mallory, 2011). Among all LGBT individuals, those who have experienced\ngreater levels of stress related to their sexual orientation have higher levels of\nphysical and mental health problems than those who have experienced lower\nlevels of stress. It is important to keep in mind that these various physical and\nmental health problems do not stem from an LGBT sexual orientation in and of\nitself, but rather from the experience of living as an LGBT individual in\na homophobic (disliking LGBT behavior and individuals) society.\nDespite the health problems that LGBT people experience, medical students do\nnot learn very much about these problems. A recent survey of medical school\ndeans found that one-third of medical schools provide no clinical training about these health issues, and that students in the medical schools that do provide\ntraining still receive only an average of five hours of training (Obedin-Maliver et\nal., 2011). The senior author of the study commented on its findings, \u201cIt\u2019s great\nthat a lot of schools are starting to teach these topics. But the conversation needs\nto go deeper. We heard from the deans that a lot of these important LGBT health\ntopics are completely off the radar screens of many medical schools\u201d (White,\n2011).\nHeterosexual Privilege\nIn earlier chapters, we discussed the related concepts of white privilege and male\nprivilege. To recall, simply because they are white, whites can go through their\ndaily lives without worrying about or experiencing the many kinds of subtle and\nnot-so-subtle negative events that people of color experience. Moreover, simply\nbecause they are male, men can go through their daily lives without worrying\nabout or experiencing the many kinds of subtle and not-so-subtle negative events\nthat women experience. Whether or not they are conscious of it, therefore,\nwhites and men are automatically privileged compared to people of color and\nwomen, respectively.\nAn analogous concept exists in the study of sexual orientation and inequality. This\nconcept is heterosexual privilege, which refers to the many advantages that\nheterosexuals (or people perceived as heterosexuals) enjoy simply because their\nsexual orientation is not LGBT. There are many such advantages, and we have\nspace to list only a few:\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals can be out day or night or at school or workplaces without\nfearing that they will be verbally harassed or physically attacked because of\ntheir sexuality or that they will hear jokes about their sexuality.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about not being hired for a job, about\nbeing fired, or not being promoted because of their sexuality.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals can legally marry everywhere in the United States and receive\nall the federal, state, and other benefits that married couples receive.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals can express a reasonable amount of affection (holding hands,\nkissing, etc.) in public without fearing negative reactions from onlookers.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about being asked why they prefer\nopposite-sex relations, being criticized for choosing their sexual orientation, or\nbeing urged to change their sexual orientation. \uf0b7 Heterosexual parents do not have to worry about anyone questioning their\nfitness as parents because of their sexuality.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals do not have to feel the need to conceal their sexual orientation.\n\uf0b7 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about being accused of trying to \u201cpush\u201d\ntheir sexuality onto other people.\nPeople Making a Difference\nImproving the Family Lives of LGBT Youth\nMany organizations and agencies around the country aim to improve the lives of\nLGBT teens. One of them is the Family Acceptance Project (FAP) at San Francisco\nState University, which focuses on the family problems that LGBT teens often\nexperience. According to its website, FAP is \u201cthe only community research,\nintervention, education and policy initiative that works to decrease major health\nand related risks for [LGBT] youth, such as suicide, substance abuse, HIV and\nhomelessness\u2014in the context of their families. We use a research-based,\nculturally grounded approach to help ethnically, socially and religiously diverse\nfamilies decrease rejection and increase support for their LGBT children.\u201d\nTo accomplish its mission, FAP engages in two types of activities: research and\nfamily support services. In the research area, FAP has published some pioneering\nstudies of the effects of school victimization and of family rejection and\nacceptance on the physical and mental health of LGBT teens during their\nadolescence and into their early adulthood. In the family support services area,\nFAP provides confidential advice, information, and counseling to families with one\nor more LGBT children or adolescents, and it also has produced various\neducational materials for these families and for professionals who deal with LGBT\nissues. At the time of this writing, FAP was producing several documentary videos\nfeaturing LGBT youth talking about their family situations and other aspects of\ntheir lives. Its support services and written materials are available in English,\nSpanish, and Cantonese.\nThrough its pioneering efforts, the Family Acceptance Project is one of many\norganizations making a difference in the lives of LGBT youth.

Key Takeaways:\nBullying, taunting, and violence are significant problems for the LGBT community.\nLGBT people are at greater risk for behavioral and physical and mental health\nproblems because of the many negative experiences they encounter.\nFederal law does not protect LGBT individuals from employment discrimination.\nThe children of same-sex couples fare at least as well as children of heterosexual\ncouples.\nReferences\nAmes, P.

Improving the Lives of the LGBT Community\nLearning Objective:\nUnderstand which measures show promise of reducing inequality based on sexual\norientation.\nThe inequality arising from sexual orientation stems from long-standing and deep-\nrooted prejudice against nonheterosexual attraction and behavior and against the\nmany people whose sexual orientation is not heterosexual. We have seen in this\nchapter that attitudes about and related to same-sex sexuality have become\nmarkedly more positive since a generation ago. Reflecting this trend, the number\nof openly gay elected officials and candidates for office has increased greatly\nsince a generation ago, and the sexual orientation of candidates appears to be a\nnonissue in many areas of the nation (Page, 2011). In a 2011 Gallup poll, two-\nthirds of Americans said they would vote for a gay candidate for president, up\nfrom only one-fourth of Americans in 1978 (Page, 2011). Also in 2011, the US\nSenate confirmed the nomination of the first openly gay man for a federal\njudgeship (Milbank, 2011). To paraphrase the slogan of a nationwide campaign\naimed at helping gay teens deal with bullying and other mistreatment, it is getting\nbetter.\nMuch of this improvement must be credited to the gay rights movement that is\npopularly thought to have begun in June 1969 in New York City after police raided\na gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and arrested several people inside. A crowd of\nseveral hundred people gathered and rioted in protest that night and the next\nnight. The gay rights movement had begun.\nDespite the advances this movement has made and despite the improvement in\npublic attitudes about LGBT issues, we have seen in this chapter that LGBT people\ncontinue to experience many types of inequality and other problems. As with\ninequality based on race and/or ethnicity, social class, and gender, there is much\nwork still to be done to reduce inequality based on sexual orientation.\nFor such inequality to be reduced, it is certainly essential that heterosexuals do\neverything possible in their daily lives to avoid any form of mistreatment of LGBT\nindividuals and to treat them as they would treat any heterosexual. Beyond this,\ncertain other measures should help address LGBT inequality. These measures\nmight include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Parents should make clear to their children that all sexual orientations are\nequally valid. Parents whose child happens to be LGBT should love that child at\nleast as much as they would love a heterosexual child.\n2. School programs should continue and strengthen their efforts to provide\nstudents a positive environment in regard to sexual orientation and to educate\nthem about LGBT issues. Bullying and other harassment of LGBT students must\nnot be tolerated. In 2011, California became the first state to require the\nteaching of gay and lesbian history; other states should follow this example.\n3. Federal law should prohibit employment discrimination against LGBT people,\nand same-sex marriages should become legal throughout the United States. In\nthe meantime, new legislation should provide same-sex couples the same\nrights, responsibilities, and benefits that heterosexual married couples have.\n4. Police should continue to educate themselves about LGBT issues and should\nstrengthen their efforts to ensure that physical attacks on LGBT people are\ntreated at least as seriously as attacks on heterosexual people are treated.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlthough the gay rights movement has made significant advances, many types of\ninequality based on sexual orientation continue to exist.\nSeveral measures should be begun or continued to reduce inequality based on\nsexual orientation.\nReferences\nMilbank, D.

Sexual orientation refers to a person\u2019s preference for sexual relationships with\nindividuals of the other sex, one\u2019s own sex, or both sexes. The term also\nincreasingly refers to transgender individuals, whose behavior, appearance,\nand/or gender identity departs from conventional norms.\n2. According to national survey evidence, almost 4 percent of American adults\nidentify as LGBT (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender), a figure equivalent to 9\nmillion adults. Almost 20 million have engaged in same-sex relations.\n3. Male homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome seems to have been\naccepted and rather common, but Europe, the Americas, and other areas\ninfluenced by the Judeo-Christian tradition have long viewed homosexuality\nvery negatively. In many societies studied by anthropologists, homosexuality is\nrather common and considered a normal form of sexuality.\n4. Scholars continue to debate whether sexual orientation is more the result of\nbiological factors or social and cultural factors. Related to this debate, the\npublic is fairly split over the issue of whether sexual orientation is a choice or\nsomething over which people have no control.\n5. Heterosexism in the United States is higher among men than among women,\namong older people than younger people, among the less educated than\namong the more highly educated, among Southerners than among non-\nSoutherners, and among more religious people than among less religious\npeople. Levels of heterosexism have declined markedly since a generation ago.\n6. Sexual orientation is a significant source of inequality. LGBT individuals\nexperience bullying, taunting, and violence; they may experience employment\ndiscrimination; and they are not allowed to marry in most states. Because of\nthe stress of living as LGBT, they are at greater risk than heterosexuals for\nseveral types of physical and mental health problems.\nWhat You Can Do\nTo help reduce inequality based on sexual orientation, you may wish to do any of\nthe following:\n1. Start or join an LGBT advocacy group on your campus. 2. Write a letter to the editor in favor of same-sex marriage.\n3. Urge your US Senators and Representative to pass legislation prohibiting\nemployment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n4. Work for a social service agency in your local community that focuses on the\nneeds of LGBT teens.\nThis is a derivative of SOCIAL PROBLEMS: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by a publisher who has requested that they\nand the original author not receive attribution, which was originally released and is used under CC BY-NC-SA.

Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 8 \u2013 Social Psychological Perspectives and Religious Orientations\n8.1 Introduction to Religion\nDerived from Introduction to Religion by OpenStax\nReligions come in many forms, such as this large megachurch. (Photo courtesy of\nToBeDaniel/Wikimedia Commons)\nWhy do sociologists study religion? For centuries, humankind has sought to\nunderstand and explain the \u201cmeaning of life.\u201d Many philosophers believe this\ncontemplation and the desire to understand our place in the universe are what\ndifferentiate humankind from other species. Religion, in one form or another, has\nbeen found in all human societies since human societies first appeared.\nArchaeological digs have revealed ritual objects, ceremonial burial sites, and other\nreligious artifacts. Social conflict and even wars often result from religious\ndisputes. To understand a culture, sociologists must study its religion.\nWhat is religion? Pioneer sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim described it with the\nethereal statement that it consists of \u201cthings that surpass the limits of our\nknowledge\u201d (1915). He went on to elaborate: Religion is \u201ca unified system of\nbeliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say set apart and\nforbidden, beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community, called a church, all those who adhere to them\u201d (1915). Some people associate\nreligion with places of worship (a synagogue or church), others with a practice\n(confession or meditation), and still others with a concept that guides their daily\nlives (like dharma or sin). All these people can agree that religion is a system of\nbeliefs, values, and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers\nto be spiritually significant.\nDoes religion bring fear, wonder, relief, explanation of the unknown or control\nover freedom and choice? How do our religious perspectives affect our behavior?\nThese are questions sociologists ask and are reasons they study religion. What are\npeoples' conceptions of the profane and the sacred? How do religious ideas affect\nthe real-world reactions and choices of people in a society?\nReligion can also serve as a filter for examining other issues in society and other\ncomponents of a culture. For example, after the terrorist attacks of September\n11, 2001, it became important for teachers, church leaders, and the media to\neducate Americans about Islam to prevent stereotyping and to promote religious\ntolerance. Sociological tools and methods, such as surveys, polls, interviews, and\nanalysis of historical data, can be applied to the study of religion in a culture to\nhelp us better understand the role religion plays in people\u2019s lives and the way it\ninfluences society.\nGlossary\nreligion\na system of beliefs, values, and practices concerning what a person holds to\nbe sacred or spiritually significant\nReferences\nDurkheim, \u00c9mile. 1947 [1915].

The Sociological Approach to Religion\nDerived from The Sociological Approach to Religion by OpenStax\nFrom the Latin religio (respect for what is sacred) and religare (to bind, in the\nsense of an obligation), the term religion describes various systems of belief and\npractice that define what people consider to be sacred or spiritual (Fasching and\ndeChant 2001; Durkheim 1915). Throughout history, and in societies across the\nworld, leaders have used religious narratives, symbols, and traditions in an\nattempt to give more meaning to life and understand the universe. Some form of\nreligion is found in every known culture, and it is usually practiced in a public way\nby a group. The practice of religion can include feasts and festivals, intercession\nwith God or gods, marriage and funeral services, music and art, meditation or\ninitiation, sacrifice or service, and other aspects of culture.\nWhile some people think of religion as something individual because religious\nbeliefs can be highly personal, religion is also a social institution. Social scientists\nrecognize that religion exists as an organized and integrated set of beliefs,\nbehaviors, and norms centered on basic social needs and values. Moreover,\nreligion is a cultural universal found in all social groups. For instance, in every\nculture, funeral rites are practiced in some way, although these customs vary\nbetween cultures and within religious affiliations. Despite differences, there are\ncommon elements in a ceremony marking a person\u2019s death, such as\nannouncement of the death, care of the deceased, disposition, and ceremony or\nritual. These universals, and the differences in the way societies and individuals\nexperience religion, provide rich material for sociological study.\nIn studying religion, sociologists distinguish between what they term the\nexperience, beliefs, and rituals of a religion. Religious experience refers to the\nconviction or sensation that we are connected to \u201cthe divine.\u201d This type of\ncommunion might be experienced when people are pray or meditate. Religious\nbeliefs are specific ideas members of a particular faith hold to be true, such as\nthat Jesus Christ was the son of God, or that reincarnation exists. Another\nillustration of religious beliefs is the creation stories we find in different\nreligions. Religious rituals are behaviors or practices that are either required or\nexpected of the members of a particular group, such as bar mitzvah or confession\nof sins (Barkan and Greenwood 2003). The History of Religion as a Sociological Concept\nIn the wake of nineteenth century European industrialization and secularization,\nthree social theorists attempted to examine the relationship between religion and\nsociety: \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx. They are among the\nfounding thinkers of modern sociology.\nAs stated earlier, French sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917) defined religion\nas a \u201cunified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things\u201d (1915). To\nhim, sacred meant extraordinary\u2014something that inspired wonder and that\nseemed connected to the concept of \u201cthe divine.\u201d Durkheim argued that \u201creligion\nhappens\u201d in society when there is a separation between the profane (ordinary\nlife) and the sacred (1915). A rock, for example, isn\u2019t sacred or profane as it exists.\nBut if someone makes it into a headstone, or another person uses it for\nlandscaping, it takes on different meanings\u2014one sacred, one profane.\nDurkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in\nterms of its societal impact. Above all, he believed religion is about community: It\nbinds people together (social cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social\ncontrol), and offers strength during life\u2019s transitions and tragedies (meaning and\npurpose). By applying the methods of natural science to the study of society,\nDurkheim held that the source of religion and morality is the collective mind-set\nof society and that the cohesive bonds of social order result from common values\nin a society. He contended that these values need to be maintained to maintain\nsocial stability.\nBut what would happen if religion were to decline? This question led Durkheim to\nposit that religion is not just a social creation but something that represents the\npower of society: When people celebrate sacred things, they celebrate the power\nof their society. By this reasoning, even if traditional religion disappeared, society\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily dissolve.\nWhereas Durkheim saw religion as a source of social stability, German sociologist\nand political economist Max Weber (1864\u20131920) believed it was a precipitator of\nsocial change. He examined the effects of religion on economic activities and\nnoticed that heavily Protestant societies\u2014such as those in the Netherlands,\nEngland, Scotland, and Germany\u2014were the most highly developed capitalist societies and that their most successful business leaders were Protestant. In his\nwriting The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), he contends that\nthe Protestant work ethic influenced the development of capitalism. Weber noted\nthat certain kinds of Protestantism supported the pursuit of material gain by\nmotivating believers to work hard, be successful, and not spend their profits on\nfrivolous things. (The modern use of \u201cwork ethic\u201d comes directly from Weber\u2019s\nProtestant ethic, although it has now lost its religious connotations.)\nTHE PROTESTANT WORK ETHIC IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nMax Weber (1904) posited that, in Europe in his time, Protestants were more\nlikely than Catholics to value capitalist ideology, and believed in hard work and\nsavings. He showed that Protestant values directly influenced the rise of\ncapitalism and helped create the modern world order. Weber thought the\nemphasis on community in Catholicism versus the emphasis on individual\nachievement in Protestantism made a difference. His century-old claim that the\nProtestant work ethic led to the development of capitalism has been one of the\nmost important and controversial topics in the sociology of religion. In fact,\nscholars have found little merit to his contention when applied to modern society\n(Greeley 1989).\nWhat does the concept of work ethic mean today? The work ethic in the\ninformation age has been affected by tremendous cultural and social change, just\nas workers in the mid- to late nineteenth century were influenced by the wake of\nthe Industrial Revolution. Factory jobs tend to be simple, uninvolved, and require\nvery little thinking or decision making on the part of the worker. Today, the work\nethic of the modern workforce has been transformed, as more thinking and\ndecision making is required. Employees also seek autonomy and fulfillment in\ntheir jobs, not just wages. Higher levels of education have become necessary, as\nwell as people management skills and access to the most recent information on\nany given topic. The information age has increased the rapid pace of production\nexpected in many jobs.\nOn the other hand, the \u201cMcDonaldization\u201d of the United States (Hightower 1975;\nRitzer 1993), in which many service industries, such as the fast-food industry,\nhave established routinized roles and tasks, has resulted in a \u201cdiscouragement\u201d of\nthe work ethic. In jobs where roles and tasks are highly prescribed, workers have\nno opportunity to make decisions. They are considered replaceable commodities as opposed to valued employees. During times of recession, these service jobs\nmay be the only employment possible for younger individuals or those with low-\nlevel skills. The pay, working conditions, and robotic nature of the tasks\ndehumanizes the workers and strips them of incentives for doing quality work.\nWorking hard also doesn\u2019t seem to have any relationship with Catholic or\nProtestant religious beliefs anymore, or those of other religions; information age\nworkers expect talent and hard work to be rewarded by material gain and career\nadvancement.\nGerman philosopher, journalist, and revolutionary socialist Karl Marx (1818\u20131883)\nalso studied the social impact of religion. He believed religion reflects the social\nstratification of society and that it maintains inequality and perpetuates the\nstatus quo. For him, religion was just an extension of working-class (proletariat)\neconomic suffering. He famously argued that religion \u201cis the opium of the people\u201d\n(1844).\nFor Durkheim, Weber, and Marx, who were reacting to the great social and\neconomic upheaval of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in\nEurope, religion was an integral part of society. For Durkheim, religion was a force\nfor cohesion that helped bind the members of society to the group, while Weber\nbelieved religion could be understood as something separate from society. Marx\nconsidered religion inseparable from the economy and the worker. Religion could\nnot be understood apart from the capitalist society that perpetuated inequality.\nDespite their different views, these social theorists all believed in the centrality of\nreligion to society. Theoretical Perspectives on Religion\nFunctionalists believe religion meets many important needs for people, including\ngroup cohesion and companionship. (Photo courtesy of James Emery/flickr)\nModern-day sociologists often apply one of three major theoretical perspectives.\nThese views offer different lenses through which to study and understand society:\nfunctionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory. Let\u2019s explore how\nscholars applying these paradigms understand religion.\nFunctionalism\nFunctionalists contend that religion serves several functions in society. Religion, in\nfact, depends on society for its existence, value, and significance, and vice versa.\nFrom this perspective, religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to\nspiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social\ninteraction and social control.\nIn providing answers, religion defines the spiritual world and spiritual forces,\nincluding divine beings. For example, it helps answer questions like, \u201cHow was the world created?\u201d \u201cWhy do we suffer?\u201d \u201cIs there a plan for our lives?\u201d and \u201cIs there\nan afterlife?\u201d As another function, religion provides emotional comfort in times of\ncrisis. Religious rituals bring order, comfort, and organization through shared\nfamiliar symbols and patterns of behavior.\nOne of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective,\nis the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It\nprovides social support and social networking and offers a place to meet others\nwho hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times\nof need. Moreover, it can foster group cohesion and integration. Because religion\ncan be central to many people\u2019s concept of themselves, sometimes there is an\n\u201cin-group\u201d versus \u201cout-group\u201d feeling toward other religions in our society or\nwithin a particular practice. On an extreme level, the Inquisition, the Salem witch\ntrials, and anti-Semitism are all examples of this dynamic. Finally, religion\npromotes social control: It reinforces social norms such as appropriate styles of\ndress, following the law, and regulating sexual behavior.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theorists view religion as an institution that helps maintain patterns of\nsocial inequality. For example, the Vatican has a tremendous amount of wealth,\nwhile the average income of Catholic parishioners is small. According to this\nperspective, religion has been used to support the \u201cdivine right\u201d of oppressive\nmonarchs and to justify unequal social structures, like India\u2019s caste system.\nConflict theorists are critical of the way many religions promote the idea that\nbelievers should be satisfied with existing circumstances because they are divinely\nordained. This power dynamic has been used by Christian institutions for\ncenturies to keep poor people poor and to teach them that they shouldn\u2019t be\nconcerned with what they lack because their \u201ctrue\u201d reward (from a religious\nperspective) will come after death. Conflict theorists also point out that those in\npower in a religion are often able to dictate practices, rituals, and beliefs through\ntheir interpretation of religious texts or via proclaimed direct communication\nfrom the divine. Many religions, including the Catholic faith, have long prohibited women from\nbecoming spiritual leaders. Feminist theorists focus on gender inequality and\npromote leadership roles for women in religion. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia\nCommons)\nThe feminist perspective is a conflict theory view that focuses specifically on\ngender inequality. In terms of religion, feminist theorists assert that, although\nwomen are typically the ones to socialize children into a religion, they have\ntraditionally held very few positions of power within religions. A few religions and\nreligious denominations are more gender equal, but male dominance remains the\nnorm of most.\nRATIONAL CHOICE THEORY: CAN ECONOMIC THEORY BE APPLIED TO RELIGION?\nHow do people decide which religion to follow, if any? How does one pick a\nchurch or decide which denomination \u201cfits\u201d best? Rational choice theory (RCT) is\none way social scientists have attempted to explain these behaviors. The theory\nproposes that people are self-interested, though not necessarily selfish, and that\npeople make rational choices\u2014choices that can reasonably be expected to\nmaximize positive outcomes while minimizing negative outcomes. Sociologists\nRoger Finke and Rodney Stark (1988) first considered the use of RCT to explain\nsome aspects of religious behavior, with the assumption that there is a basic\nhuman need for religion in terms of providing belief in a supernatural being, a sense of meaning in life, and belief in life after death. Religious explanations of\nthese concepts are presumed to be more satisfactory than scientific explanations,\nwhich may help to account for the continuation of strong religious connectedness\nin countries such as the United States, despite predictions of some competing\ntheories for a great decline in religious affiliation due to modernization and\nreligious pluralism.\nAnother assumption of RCT is that religious organizations can be viewed in terms\nof \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201crewards.\u201d Costs are not only monetary requirements, but are also\nthe time, effort, and commitment demands of any particular religious\norganization. Rewards are the intangible benefits in terms of belief and\nsatisfactory explanations about life, death, and the supernatural, as well as social\nrewards from membership. RCT proposes that, in a pluralistic society with many\nreligious options, religious organizations will compete for members, and people\nwill choose between different churches or denominations in much the same way\nthey select other consumer goods, balancing costs and rewards in a rational\nmanner. In this framework, RCT also explains the development and decline of\nchurches, denominations, sects, and even cults; this limited part of the very\ncomplex RCT theory is the only aspect well supported by research data.\nCritics of RCT argue that it doesn\u2019t fit well with human spiritual needs, and many\nsociologists disagree that the costs and rewards of religion can even be\nmeaningfully measured or that individuals use a rational balancing process\nregarding religious affiliation. The theory doesn\u2019t address many aspects of religion\nthat individuals may consider essential (such as faith) and further fails to account\nfor agnostics and atheists who don\u2019t seem to have a similar need for religious\nexplanations. Critics also believe this theory overuses economic terminology and\nstructure and point out that terms such as \u201crational\u201d and \u201creward\u201d are\nunacceptably defined by their use; they would argue that the theory is based on\nfaulty logic and lacks external, empirical support. A scientific explanation\nfor why something occurs can\u2019t reasonably be supported by the fact that\nit does occur. RCT is widely used in economics and to a lesser extent in criminal\njustice, but the application of RCT in explaining the religious beliefs and behaviors\nof people and societies is still being debated in sociology today. Symbolic Interactionism\nRising from the concept that our world is socially constructed, symbolic\ninteractionism studies the symbols and interactions of everyday life. To\ninteractionists, beliefs and experiences are not sacred unless individuals in a\nsociety regard them as sacred. The Star of David in Judaism, the cross in\nChristianity, and the crescent and star in Islam are examples of sacred symbols.\nInteractionists are interested in what these symbols communicate. Because\ninteractionists study one-on-one, everyday interactions between individuals, a\nscholar using this approach might ask questions focused on this dynamic. The\ninteraction between religious leaders and practitioners, the role of religion in the\nordinary components of everyday life, and the ways people express religious\nvalues in social interactions\u2014all might be topics of study to an interactionist.\nSummary\nReligion describes the beliefs, values, and practices related to sacred or spiritual\nconcerns. Social theorist \u00c9mile Durkheim defined religion as a \u201cunified system of\nbeliefs and practices relative to sacred things\u201d (1915). Max Weber believed\nreligion could be a force for social change. Karl Marx viewed religion as a tool\nused by capitalist societies to perpetuate inequality. Religion is a social institution,\nbecause it includes beliefs and practices that serve the needs of society. Religion\nis also an example of a cultural universal, because it is found in all societies in one\nform or another. Functionalism, conflict theory, and interactionism all provide\nvaluable ways for sociologists to understand religion.\nGlossary\nreligious experience\nthe conviction or sensation that one is connected to \u201cthe divine\u201d\nreligious beliefs\nspecific ideas that members of a particular faith hold to be true\nreligious rituals behaviors or practices that are either required for or expected of the\nmembers of a particular group\nFurther Research\nFor more discussion on the study of sociology and religion, check out the\nfollowing blog: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/immanent_frame/.

In no particular order, they\nrepresent Judaism, Wicca, Taoism, Christianity, Confucianism, Baha\u2019i, Druidism,\nIslam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Shinto, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. Can you match the symbol to the religion? What might a symbolic interactionist make of\nthese symbols? (Photo courtesy of ReligiousTolerance.org)\nThe major religions of the world (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism,\nChristianity, Taoism, and Judaism) differ in many respects, including how each\nreligion is organized and the belief system each upholds. Other differences\ninclude the nature of belief in a higher power, the history of how the world and\nthe religion began, and the use of sacred texts and objects.\nTypes of Religious Organizations\nReligions organize themselves\u2014their institutions, practitioners, and structures\u2014\nin a variety of fashions. For instance, when the Roman Catholic Church emerged,\nit borrowed many of its organizational principles from the ancient Roman military\nand turned senators into cardinals, for example. Sociologists use different terms,\nlike ecclesia, denomination, and sect, to define these types of organizations.\nScholars are also aware that these definitions are not static. Most religions\ntransition through different organizational phases. For example, Christianity\nbegan as a cult, transformed into a sect, and today exists as an ecclesia.\nCults, like sects, are new religious groups. In the United States today this term\noften carries pejorative connotations. However, almost all religions began as cults\nand gradually progressed to levels of greater size and organization. The term cult\nis sometimes used interchangeably with the term new religious movement\n(NRM). In its pejorative use, these groups are often disparaged as being secretive,\nhighly controlling of members\u2019 lives, and dominated by a single, charismatic\nleader.\nControversy exists over whether some groups are cults, perhaps due in part to\nmedia sensationalism over groups like polygamous Mormons or the Peoples\nTemple followers who died at Jonestown, Guyana. Some groups that are\ncontroversially labeled as cults today include the Church of Scientology and the\nHare Krishna movement.\nA sect is a small and relatively new group. Most of the well-known Christian\ndenominations in the United States today began as sects. For example, the\nMethodists and Baptists protested against their parent Anglican Church in England, just as Henry VIII protested against the Catholic Church by forming the\nAnglican Church. From \u201cprotest\u201d comes the term Protestant.\nOccasionally, a sect is a breakaway group that may be in tension with larger\nsociety. They sometimes claim to be returning to \u201cthe fundamentals\u201d or to\ncontest the veracity of a particular doctrine. When membership in a sect\nincreases over time, it may grow into a denomination. Often a sect begins as an\noffshoot of a denomination, when a group of members believes they should\nseparate from the larger group.\nSome sects do not grow into denominations. Sociologists call these established\nsects. Established sects, such as the Amish or Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses fall halfway\nbetween sect and denomination on the ecclesia\u2013cult continuum because they\nhave a mixture of sect-like and denomination-like characteristics.\nA denomination is a large, mainstream religious organization, but it does not\nclaim to be official or state sponsored. It is one religion among many. For\nexample, Baptist, African Methodist Episcopal, Catholic, and Seventh-day\nAdventist are all Christian denominations.\nThe term ecclesia, originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient\nAthens, Greece, now refers to a congregation. In sociology, the term is used to\nrefer to a religious group that most all members of a society belong to. It is\nconsidered a nationally recognized, or official, religion that holds a religious\nmonopoly and is closely allied with state and secular powers. The United States\ndoes not have an ecclesia by this standard; in fact, this is the type of religious\norganization that many of the first colonists came to America to escape. How might you classify the Mennonites? As a cult, a sect, or a denomination?\n(Photo courtesy of Frenkieb/flickr)\nOne way to remember these religious organizational terms is to think of cults,\nsects, denominations, and ecclesia representing a continuum, with increasing\ninfluence on society, where cults are least influential and ecclesia are most\ninfluential.\nTypes of Religions\nScholars from a variety of disciplines have strived to classify religions. One widely\naccepted categorization that helps people understand different belief systems\nconsiders what or who people worship (if anything). Using this method of\nclassification, religions might fall into one of these basic categories, as shown\nin Table.\nOne way scholars have categorized religions is by classifying what or who they\nhold to be divine. Religious\nClassification What/Who Is Divine Example\nPolytheism Multiple gods Belief systems of the ancient\nGreeks and Romans\nMonotheism Single god Judaism, Islam\nAtheism No deities Atheism\nAnimism Nonhuman beings (animals, Indigenous nature worship\nplants, natural world) (Shinto)\nTotemism Human-natural being Ojibwa (Native American)\nconnection beliefs\nNote that some religions may be practiced\u2014or understood\u2014in various\ncategories. For instance, the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity (God, Jesus, Holy\nSpirit) defies the definition of monotheism, which is a religion based on belief in a\nsingle deity, to some scholars. Similarly, many Westerners view the multiple\nmanifestations of Hinduism\u2019s godhead as polytheistic, which is a religion based on\nbelief in multiple deities,, while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a\nmonotheistic parallel to the Christian Trinity. Some Japanese practice Shinto,\nwhich follows animism, which is a religion that believes in the divinity of\nnonhuman beings, like animals, plants, and objects of the natural world, while\npeople who practice totemism believe in a divine connection between humans\nand other natural beings.\nIt is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers, such\nas atheists, who do not believe in a divine being or entity, and agnostics, who\nhold that ultimate reality (such as God) is unknowable. While typically not an\norganized group, atheists and agnostics represent a significant portion of the\npopulation. It is important to recognize that being a nonbeliever in a divine entity\ndoes not mean the individual subscribes to no morality. Indeed, many Nobel Peace Prize winners and other great humanitarians over the centuries would have\nclassified themselves as atheists or agnostics.\nThe World\u2019s Religions\nReligions have emerged and developed across the world. Some have been short-\nlived, while others have persisted and grown. In this section, we will explore\nseven of the world\u2019s major religions.\nHinduism\nThe oldest religion in the world, Hinduism originated in the Indus River Valley\nabout 4,500 years ago in what is now modern-day northwest India and Pakistan. It\narose contemporaneously with ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures.\nWith roughly one billion followers, Hinduism is the third-largest of the world\u2019s\nreligions. Hindus believe in a divine power that can manifest as different entities.\nThree main incarnations\u2014Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva\u2014are sometimes compared\nto the manifestations of the divine in the Christian Trinity.\nMultiple sacred texts, collectively called the Vedas, contain hymns and rituals\nfrom ancient India and are mostly written in Sanskrit. Hindus generally believe in\na set of principles called dharma, which refer to one\u2019s duty in the world that\ncorresponds with \u201cright\u201d actions. Hindus also believe in karma, or the notion that\nspiritual ramifications of one\u2019s actions are balanced cyclically in this life or a\nfuture life (reincarnation). Hindu women sometimes apply decorations of henna dye to their hands for\nspecial occasions such as weddings and religious festivals. (Photo courtesy of\nAkash Mazumdar) Buddhism promotes peace and tolerance. The 14th Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso) is\none of the most revered and influential Tibetan Buddhist leaders. (Photo courtesy\nof Nancy Pelosi/flickr)\nBuddhism\nBuddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama around 500 B.C.E. Siddhartha was\nsaid to have given up a comfortable, upper-class life to follow one of poverty and\nspiritual devotion. At the age of thirty-five, he famously meditated under a sacred\nfig tree and vowed not to rise before he achieved enlightenment (bodhi). After\nthis experience, he became known as Buddha, or \u201cenlightened one.\u201d Followers\nwere drawn to Buddha\u2019s teachings and the practice of meditation, and he later\nestablished a monastic order.\nMeditation is an important practice in Buddhism. A Tibetan monk is shown here\nengaged in solitary meditation. (Photo courtesy of Prince Roy/flickr) Buddha\u2019s teachings encourage Buddhists to lead a moral life by accepting the four\nNoble Truths: 1) life is suffering, 2) suffering arises from attachment to desires, 3)\nsuffering ceases when attachment to desires ceases, and 4) freedom from\nsuffering is possible by following the \u201cmiddle way.\u201d The concept of the \u201cmiddle\nway\u201d is central to Buddhist thinking, which encourages people to live in the\npresent and to practice acceptance of others (Smith 1991). Buddhism also tends\nto deemphasize the role of a godhead, instead stressing the importance of\npersonal responsibility (Craig 2002).\nConfucianism\nConfucianism was the official religion of China from 200 B.C.E. until it was\nofficially abolished when communist leadership discouraged religious practice in\n1949. The religion was developed by Kung Fu-Tzu (Confucius), who lived in the\nsixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. An extraordinary teacher, his lessons\u2014which were\nabout self-discipline, respect for authority and tradition, and jen(the kind\ntreatment of every person)\u2014were collected in a book called the Analects.\nSome religious scholars consider Confucianism more of a social system than a\nreligion because it focuses on sharing wisdom about moral practices but doesn\u2019t\ninvolve any type of specific worship; nor does it have formal objects. In fact, its\nteachings were developed in context of problems of social anarchy and a near-\ncomplete deterioration of social cohesion. Dissatisfied with the social solutions\nput forth, Kung Fu-Tzu developed his own model of religious morality to help\nguide society (Smith 1991).\nTaoism\nIn Taoism, the purpose of life is inner peace and harmony. Tao is usually\ntranslated as \u201cway\u201d or \u201cpath.\u201d The founder of the religion is generally recognized\nto be a man named Laozi, who lived sometime in the sixth century B.C.E. in China.\nTaoist beliefs emphasize the virtues of compassion and moderation.\nThe central concept of tao can be understood to describe a spiritual reality, the\norder of the universe, or the way of modern life in harmony with the former two.\nThe ying-yang symbol and the concept of polar forces are central Taoist ideas\n(Smith 1991). Some scholars have compared this Chinese tradition to its\nConfucian counterpart by saying that \u201cwhereas Confucianism is concerned with day-to-day rules of conduct, Taoism is concerned with a more spiritual level of\nbeing\u201d (Feng and English 1972).\nJudaism\nAfter their Exodus from Egypt in the thirteenth century B.C.E., Jews, a nomadic\nsociety, became monotheistic, worshipping only one God. The Jews\u2019 covenant, or\npromise of a special relationship with Yahweh (God), is an important element of\nJudaism, and their sacred text is the Torah, which Christians also follow as the first\nfive books of the Bible. Talmud refers to a collection of sacred Jewish oral\ninterpretation of the Torah. Jews emphasize moral behavior and action in this\nworld as opposed to beliefs or personal salvation in the next world.\nThe Islamic house of worship is called a mosque. (Photo courtesy of David\nStanley/flickr)\nIslam\nIslam is monotheistic religion and it follows the teaching of the prophet\nMuhammad, born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in 570 C.E. Muhammad is seen only as a prophet, not as a divine being, and he is believed to be the messenger of Allah\n(God), who is divine. The followers of Islam, whose U.S. population is projected to\ndouble in the next twenty years (Pew Research Forum 2011), are called Muslims.\nIslam means \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201csubmission.\u201d The sacred text for Muslims is the Qur\u2019an\n(or Koran). As with Christianity\u2019s Old Testament, many of the Qur\u2019an stories are\nshared with the Jewish faith. Divisions exist within Islam, but all Muslims are\nguided by five beliefs or practices, often called \u201cpillars\u201d: 1) Allah is the only god,\nand Muhammad is his prophet, 2) daily prayer, 3) helping those in poverty, 4)\nfasting as a spiritual practice, and 5) pilgrimage to the holy center of Mecca.\nCornerstones of Muslim practice is journeying to the religion\u2019s most sacred place,\nMecca. (Photo courtesy of Raeky/flickr)\nChristianity\nToday the largest religion in the world, Christianity began 2,000 years ago in\nPalestine, with Jesus of Nazareth, a charismatic leader who taught his followers\nabout caritas (charity) or treating others as you would like to be treated yourself. The sacred text for Christians is the Bible. While Jews, Christians, and Muslims\nshare many of same historical religious stories, their beliefs verge. In their shared\nsacred stories, it is suggested that the son of God\u2014a messiah\u2014will return to save\nGod\u2019s followers. While Christians believe that he already appeared in the person\nof Jesus Christ, Jews and Muslims disagree. While they recognize Christ as an\nimportant historical figure, their traditions don\u2019t believe he\u2019s the son of God, and\ntheir faiths see the prophecy of the messiah\u2019s arrival as not yet fulfilled.\nDifferent Christian groups have variations among their sacred texts. For instance,\nMormons, an established Christian sect, also use the Book of Mormon, which they\nbelieve details other parts of Christian doctrine and Jesus\u2019 life that aren\u2019t included\nin the Bible. Similarly, the Catholic Bible includes the Apocrypha, a collection that,\nwhile part of the 1611 King James translation, is no longer included in Protestant\nversions of the Bible. Although monotheistic, Christians often describe their god\nthrough three manifestations that they call the Holy Trinity: the father (God), the\nson (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a term Christians often use to\ndescribe religious experience, or how they feel the presence of the sacred in their\nlives. One foundation of Christian doctrine is the Ten Commandments, which\ndecry acts considered sinful, including theft, murder, and adultery.\nSummary\nSociological terms for different kinds of religious organizations are, in order of\ndecreasing influence in society, ecclesia, denomination, sect, and cult. Religions\ncan be categorized according to what or whom its followers worship. Some of the\nmajor, and oldest, of the world\u2019s religions include Hinduism, Buddhism,\nConfucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.\nGlossary\nanimism\nthe religion that believes in the divinity of nonhuman beings, like animals,\nplants, and objects of the natural world\natheism\nthe belief in no deities cults\nreligious groups that are small, secretive, and highly controlling of members\nand have a charismatic leader\ndenomination\na large, mainstream religion that is not sponsored by the state\necclesia\na religion that is considered the state religion\nestablished sects\nsects that last but do not become denominations\nmonotheism\na religion based on belief in a single deity\npolytheism\na religion based on belief in multiple deities\nsect\na small, new offshoot of a denomination\ntotemism\nthe belief in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings\nFurther Research\nPBS\u2019s Frontline explores \u201cthe life of Jesus and the rise of Christianity\u201d in this in-\ndepth documentary.

The translation of\nsacred texts into everyday, nonscholarly language empowered people to shape\ntheir religions. Disagreements between religious groups and instances of religious\npersecution have led to wars and genocides. The United States is no stranger to\nreligion as an agent of social change. In fact, the United States' first European\narrivals were acting largely on religious convictions when they were compelled to\nsettle in the United States.\nLiberation Theology\nLiberation theology began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in\nthe 1950s and 1960s in Latin America, and it combines Christian principles with political activism. It uses the church to promote social change via the political\narena, and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or eliminate social injustice,\ndiscrimination, and poverty. A list of proponents of this kind of social justice\n(although some pre-date liberation theory) could include Francis of Assisi, Leo\nTolstoy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Desmond Tutu.\nAlthough begun as a moral reaction against the poverty caused by social injustice\nin that part of the world, today liberation theology is an international movement\nthat encompasses many churches and denominations. Liberation theologians\ndiscuss theology from the point of view of the poor and the oppressed, and some\ninterpret the scriptures as a call to action against poverty and injustice. In Europe\nand North America, feminist theology has emerged from liberation theology as a\nmovement to bring social justice to women.\nRELIGIOUS LEADERS AND THE RAINBOW OF GAY PRIDE\nWhat happens when a religious leader officiates a gay marriage against\ndenomination policies? What about when that same minister defends the action\nin part by coming out and making her own lesbian relationship known to the\nchurch?\nIn the case of the Reverend Amy DeLong, it meant a church trial. Some leaders in\nher denomination assert that homosexuality is incompatible with their faith,\nwhile others feel this type of discrimination has no place in a modern church\n(Barrick 2011).\nAs the LBGT community increasingly advocates for, and earns, basic civil rights,\nhow will religious communities respond? Many religious groups have traditionally\ndiscounted LBGT sexualities as \u201cwrong.\u201d However, these organizations have\nmoved closer to respecting human rights by, for example, increasingly recognizing\nfemales as an equal gender. The Roman Catholic Church drew controversial\nattention to this issue in 2010 when the Vatican secretary of state suggested\nhomosexuality was in part to blame for pedophilic sexual abuse scandals that\nhave plagued the church (Beck 2010). Because numerous studies have shown\nthere to be no relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia, nor a higher\nincidence of pedophilia among homosexuals than among heterosexuals (Beck\n2010), the Vatican\u2019s comments seem suspect. More recently Pope Francis has been pushing for a more open church, and some Catholic bishops have been\nadvocating for a more \"gay-friendly\" church (McKenna, 2014). This has not come\nto pass, but some scholars believe these changes are a matter of time.\nNo matter the situation, most religions have a tenuous (at best) relationship with\npractitioners and leaders in the gay community. As one of the earliest Christian\ndenominations to break barriers by ordaining women to serve as pastors, will\nAmy DeLong\u2019s United Methodist denomination also be a leader in LBGT rights\nwithin Christian churchgoing society?\nMegachurches\nA megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging\nmore than 2,000 people who attend regular weekly services. As of 2009, the\nlargest megachurch in the United States was in Houston Texas, boasting an\naverage weekly attendance of more than 43,000 (Bogan 2009). Megachurches\nexist in other parts of the world, especially in South Korea, Brazil, and several\nAfrican countries, but the rise of the megachurch in the United States is a fairly\nrecent phenomenon that has developed primarily in California, Florida, Georgia,\nand Texas.\nSince 1970 the number of megachurches in this country has grown from about\nfifty to more than 1,000, most of which are attached to the Southern Baptist\ndenomination (Bogan 2009). Approximately six million people are members of\nthese churches (Bird and Thumma 2011). The architecture of these church\nbuildings often resembles a sport or concert arena. The church may include\njumbotrons (large-screen televisual technology usually used in sports arenas to\nshow close-up shots of an event). Worship services feature contemporary music\nwith drums and electric guitars and use state-of-the-art sound equipment. The\nbuildings sometimes include food courts, sports and recreation facilities, and\nbookstores. Services such as child care and mental health counseling are often\noffered.\nTypically, a single, highly charismatic pastor leads the megachurch; at present,\nmost are male. Some megachurches and their preachers have a huge television\npresence, and viewers all around the country watch and respond to their shows\nand fundraising. Besides size, U.S. megachurches share other traits, including conservative\ntheology, evangelism, use of technology and social networking (Facebook,\nTwitter, podcasts, blogs), hugely charismatic leaders, few financial struggles,\nmultiple sites, and predominantly white membership. They list their main focuses\nas youth activities, community service, and study of the Scripture (Hartford\nInstitute for Religion Research b).\nCritics of megachurches believe they are too large to promote close relationships\namong fellow church members or the pastor, as could occur in smaller houses of\nworship. Supporters note that, in addition to the large worship services,\ncongregations generally meet in small groups, and some megachurches have\ninformal events throughout the week to allow for community-building (Hartford\nInstitute for Religion Research a).\nSecularization\nHistorical sociologists \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx and\npsychoanalyst Sigmund Freud anticipated secularization and claimed that the\nmodernization of society would bring about a decrease in the influence of\nreligion. Weber believed membership in distinguished clubs would outpace\nmembership in Protestant sects as a way for people to gain authority or respect.\nConversely, some people suggest secularization is a root cause of many social\nproblems, such as divorce, drug use, and educational downturn. One-time\npresidential contender Michele Bachmann even linked Hurricane Irene and the\n2011 earthquake felt in Washington D.C. to politicians\u2019 failure to listen to God\n(Ward 2011).\nWhile some scholars see the United States becoming increasingly secular, others\nobserve a rise in fundamentalism. Compared to other democratic, industrialized\ncountries, the United States is generally perceived to be a fairly religious nation.\nWhereas 65 percent of U.S. adults in a 2009 Gallup survey said religion was an\nimportant part of their daily lives, the numbers were lower in Spain (49 percent),\nCanada (42 percent), France (30 percent), the United Kingdom (27 percent), and\nSweden (17 percent) (Crabtree and Pelham 2009). Secularization interests social observers because it entails a pattern of change in a fundamental social\ninstitution.\nTHANK GOD FOR THAT TOUCHDOWN: SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE\nImagine three public universities with football games scheduled on Saturday. At\nUniversity A, a group of students in the stands who share the same faith decide to\nform a circle amid the spectators to pray for the team. For fifteen minutes, people\nin the circle share their prayers aloud among their group. At University B, the\nteam ahead at halftime decides to join together in prayer, giving thanks and\nseeking support from God. This lasts for the first ten minutes of halftime on the\nsidelines of the field while spectators watch. At University C, the game program\nincludes, among its opening moments, two minutes set aside for the team captain\nto share a prayer of his choosing with the spectators.\nIn the tricky area of separation of church and state, which of these actions is\nallowed and which is forbidden? In our three fictional scenarios, the last example\nis against the law while the first two situations are perfectly acceptable.\nIn the United States, a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom\n(many settlers were escaping religious persecution in Europe), how stringently do\nwe adhere to this ideal? How well do we respect people\u2019s right to practice any\nbelief system of their choosing? The answer just might depend on what religion\nyou practice.\nIn 2003, for example, a lawsuit escalated in Alabama regarding a monument to\nthe Ten Commandments in a public building. In response, a poll was conducted\nby USA Today, CNN, and Gallup. Among the findings: 70 percent of people\napproved of a Christian Ten Commandments monument in public, while only 33\npercent approved of a monument to the Islamic Qur\u2019an in the same space.\nSimilarly, survey respondents showed a 64 percent approval of social programs\nrun by Christian organizations, but only 41 percent approved of the same\nprograms run by Muslim groups (Newport 2003).\nThese statistics suggest that, for most people in the United States, freedom of\nreligion is less important than the religion under discussion. And this is precisely\nthe point made by those who argue for separation of church and state. According\nto their contention, any state-sanctioned recognition of religion suggests endorsement of one belief system at the expense of all others\u2014contradictory to\nthe idea of freedom of religion.\nSo what violates separation of church and state and what is acceptable? Myriad\nlawsuits continue to test the answer. In the case of the three fictional examples\nabove, the issue of spontaneity is key, as is the existence (or lack thereof) of\nplanning on the part of event organizers.\nThe next time you\u2019re at a state event\u2014political, public school, community\u2014and\nthe topic of religion comes up, consider where it falls in this debate.\nSummary\nLiberation theology combines Christian principles with political activism to\naddress social injustice, discrimination, and poverty. Megachurches are those\nwith a membership of more than 2,000 regular attendees, and they are a vibrant,\ngrowing and highly influential segment of U.S. religious life. Some sociologists\nbelieve levels of religiosity in the United States are declining (called\nsecularization), while others observe a rise in fundamentalism.\nGlossary\nliberation theology\nthe use of a church to promote social change via the political arena\nmegachurch\na Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than\n2,000 people who attend regular weekly services\nFurther Research\nWhat is a megachurch and how are they changing the face of religion?

The United\nStates has hundreds of colleges and universities run by or affiliated with the\nCatholic Church and several Protestant and Jewish denominations, and now it was\nabout to have its first Muslim college. Zaytuna College in Berkeley, California, had\njust sent out acceptance letters to students who would make up its inaugural\nclass in the fall of 2010. The school\u2019s founder said it would be a Muslim liberal arts\ncollege whose first degrees would be in Islamic law and theology and in the Arabic\nlanguage. The chair of the college\u2019s academic affairs committee explained, \u201cWe\nare trying to graduate well-rounded students who will be skilled in a liberal arts\neducation with the ability to engage in a wider framework of society and the\nvariety of issues that confront them.\u2026We are thinking of how to set up students\nfor success. We don\u2019t see any contradiction between religious and secular\nsubjects.\u201d\nThe college planned to rent a building in Berkeley during its first several years and\nwas doing fund-raising to pay for the eventual construction or purchase of its own\ncampus. It hoped to obtain academic accreditation within a decade. Because the\nUnited States has approximately 6 million Muslims whose numbers have tripled\nsince the 1970s, college officials were optimistic that their new institution would\nsucceed. An official with the Islamic Society of North America, which aids Muslim\ncommunities and organizations and provides chaplains for the U.S. military,\napplauded the new college. \u201cIt tells me that Muslims are coming of age,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is one more thing that makes Muslims part of the mainstream of America. It\nis an important part of the development of our community.\u201d (Oguntoyinbo, 2010)\nThe opening of any college is normally cause for celebration, but the news about\nthis particular college aroused a mixed reaction. Some people wrote positive\ncomments on the Web page on which this news article appeared, but two\nanonymous writers left very negative comments. One asked, \u201cWhat if they teach\nradical Islam?\u201d while the second commented, \u201cDose [sic] anyone know how Rome\nfell all those years ago? We are heading down the same road.\u201d\nAs the reaction to this news story reminds us, religion and especially Islam have\ncertainly been hot topics since 9/11, as America continues to worry about\nterrorist threats from people with Middle Eastern backgrounds. Many political and religious leaders urge Americans to practice religious tolerance, and advocacy\ngroups have established programs and secondary school curricula to educate the\npublic and students, respectively. Colleges and universities have responded with\ncourses and workshops on Islamic culture, literature, and language. The\ncontroversy over Islam is just one example of the strong passions that religion and\nreligious differences often arouse, in part because religion involves our dearest\nvalues.\nThis chapter presents a sociological understanding of religion. We begin by\nexamining religion as a social institution and by sketching its history and practice\nthroughout the world today. We then turn to the several types of religious\norganizations before concluding with a discussion of various aspects of religion in\nthe United States.\nReferences\nOguntoyinbo, L. (2010, May 20).

Religion as a Social Institution\nLearning Objectives:\nDescribe the difference between sacred beliefs and profane beliefs.\nExplain what \u00c9mile Durkheim tried to understand about religion.\nReligion clearly plays an important role in American life. Most Americans believe\nin a deity, three-fourths pray at least weekly, and more than half attend religious\nservices at least monthly. We tend to think of religion in individual terms because\nreligious beliefs and values are highly personal for many people. However,\nreligion is also a social institution, as it involves patterns of beliefs and behavior\nthat help a society meet its basic needs, to recall the definition of social institution\nin Chapter 5 \u201cSocial Structure and Social Interaction\u201d. More specifically, religion is\nthe set of beliefs and practices regarding sacred things that help a society\nunderstand the meaning and purpose of life.\nMore than half of all Americans attend religious services at least once per week.\nThis illustrates the important role that religion plays in American life.\nRoyal New Zealand Navy \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0. Because it is such an important social institution, religion has long been a key\nsociological topic. \u00c9mile Durkheim (1915/1947) observed long ago that every\nsociety has beliefs about things that are supernatural and awe-inspiring and\nbeliefs about things that are more practical and down-to-earth. He called the\nformer beliefs sacred beliefs and the latter beliefs profane beliefs. Religious\nbeliefs and practices involve the sacred: they involve things our senses cannot\nreadily observe, and they involve things that inspire in us awe, reverence, and\neven fear.\nDurkheim did not try to prove or disprove religious beliefs. Religion, he\nacknowledged, is a matter of faith, and faith is not provable or disprovable\nthrough scientific inquiry. Rather, Durkheim tried to understand the role played\nby religion in social life and the impact on religion of social structure and social\nchange. In short, he treated religion as a social institution.\nSociologists since his time have treated religion in the same way. Anthropologists,\nhistorians, and other scholars have also studied religion. Historical work on\nreligion reminds us of the importance of religion since the earliest societies, while\ncomparative work on contemporary religion reminds us of its importance\nthroughout the world today. Accordingly, Chapter 17 \u201cReligion\u201d, Section 17.2\n\u201cReligion in Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective\u201d examines key aspects of the\nhistory of religion and its practice across the globe.\nKey Takeaways\nAs a social institution, religion helps a society meet its basic needs.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim distinguished between sacred beliefs and profane beliefs and\nwrote about the role religion played in social life.\nReferences\nDurkheim, \u00c9.

Sociological Perspectives on Religion\nLearning Objectives:\nSummarize the major functions of religion.\nExplain the views of religion held by the conflict perspective.\nExplain the views of religion held by the symbolic interactionist perspective.\nSociological perspectives on religion aim to understand the functions religion\nserves, the inequality and other problems it can reinforce and perpetuate, and\nthe role it plays in our daily lives (Emerson, Monahan, & Mirola, 2011). Table 17.1\n\u201cTheory Snapshot\u201d summarizes what these perspectives say.\nTable 17.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nReligion serves several functions for society. These include (a)\ngiving meaning and purpose to life, (b) reinforcing social unity\nFunctionalism and stability, (c) serving as an agent of social control of\nbehavior, (d) promoting physical and psychological well-being,\nand (e) motivating people to work for positive social change.\nReligion reinforces and promotes social inequality and social\nconflict. It helps convince the poor to accept their lot in life, and\nConflict theory\nit leads to hostility and violence motivated by religious\ndifferences.\nThis perspective focuses on the ways in which individuals\ninterpret their religious experiences. It emphasizes that beliefs\nSymbolic\nand practices are not sacred unless people regard them as such.\ninteractionism\nOnce they are regarded as sacred, they take on special\nsignificance and give meaning to people\u2019s lives. The Functions of Religion\nMuch of the work of \u00c9mile Durkheim stressed the functions that religion serves\nfor society regardless of how it is practiced or of what specific religious beliefs a\nsociety favors. Durkheim\u2019s insights continue to influence sociological thinking\ntoday on the functions of religion.\nFirst, religion gives meaning and purpose to life. Many things in life are difficult to\nunderstand. That was certainly true, as we have seen, in prehistoric times, but\neven in today\u2019s highly scientific age, much of life and death remains a mystery,\nand religious faith and belief help many people make sense of the things science\ncannot tell us.\nSecond, religion reinforces social unity and stability. This was one of Durkheim\u2019s\nmost important insights. Religion strengthens social stability in at least two ways.\nFirst, it gives people a common set of beliefs and thus is an important agent of\nsocialization (see Chapter 4 \u201cSocialization\u201d). Second, the communal practice of\nreligion, as in houses of worship, brings people together physically, facilitates\ntheir communication and other social interaction, and thus strengthens their\nsocial bonds.\nThe communal practice of religion in a house of worship brings people together\nand allows them to interact and communicate. In this way religion helps reinforce social unity and stability. This function of religion was one of \u00c9mile Durkheim\u2019s\nmost important insights.\nErin Rempel \u2013 Worship \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nA third function of religion is related to the one just discussed. Religion is an agent\nof social control and thus strengthens social order. Religion teaches people moral\nbehavior and thus helps them learn how to be good members of society. In the\nJudeo-Christian tradition, the Ten Commandments are perhaps the most famous\nset of rules for moral behavior.\nA fourth function of religion is greater psychological and physical well-being.\nReligious faith and practice can enhance psychological well-being by being a\nsource of comfort to people in times of distress and by enhancing their social\ninteraction with others in places of worship. Many studies find that people of all\nages, not just the elderly, are happier and more satisfied with their lives if they\nare religious. Religiosity also apparently promotes better physical health, and\nsome studies even find that religious people tend to live longer than those who\nare not religious (Moberg, 2008). We return to this function later.\nA final function of religion is that it may motivate people to work for positive\nsocial change. Religion played a central role in the development of the Southern\ncivil rights movement a few decades ago. Religious beliefs motivated Martin\nLuther King Jr. and other civil rights activists to risk their lives to desegregate the\nSouth. Black churches in the South also served as settings in which the civil rights\nmovement held meetings, recruited new members, and raised money (Morris,\n1984).\nReligion, Inequality, and Conflict\nReligion has all of these benefits, but, according to conflict theory, it can also\nreinforce and promote social inequality and social conflict. This view is partly\ninspired by the work of Karl Marx, who said that religion was the \u201copiate of the\nmasses\u201d (Marx, 1964). By this he meant that religion, like a drug, makes people\nhappy with their existing conditions. Marx repeatedly stressed that workers\nneeded to rise up and overthrow the bourgeoisie. To do so, he said, they needed\nfirst to recognize that their poverty stemmed from their oppression by the\nbourgeoisie. But people who are religious, he said, tend to view their poverty in religious terms. They think it is God\u2019s will that they are poor, either because he is\ntesting their faith in him or because they have violated his rules. Many people\nbelieve that if they endure their suffering, they will be rewarded in the afterlife.\nTheir religious views lead them not to blame the capitalist class for their poverty\nand thus not to revolt. For these reasons, said Marx, religion leads the poor to\naccept their fate and helps maintain the existing system of social inequality.\nAs Chapter 11 \u201cGender and Gender Inequality\u201d discussed, religion also promotes\ngender inequality by presenting negative stereotypes about women and by\nreinforcing traditional views about their subordination to men (Klassen, 2009). A\ndeclaration a decade ago by the Southern Baptist Convention that a wife should\n\u201csubmit herself graciously\u201d to her husband\u2019s leadership reflected traditional\nreligious belief (Gundy-Volf, 1998).\nAs the Puritans\u2019 persecution of non-Puritans illustrates, religion can also promote\nsocial conflict, and the history of the world shows that individual people and\nwhole communities and nations are quite ready to persecute, kill, and go to war\nover religious differences. We see this today and in the recent past in central\nEurope, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. Jews and other religious groups\nhave been persecuted and killed since ancient times. Religion can be the source of\nsocial unity and cohesion, but over the centuries it also has led to persecution,\ntorture, and wanton bloodshed.\nNews reports going back since the 1990s indicate a final problem that religion can\ncause, and that is sexual abuse, at least in the Catholic Church. As you\nundoubtedly have heard, an unknown number of children were sexually abused\nby Catholic priests and deacons in the United States, Canada, and many other\nnations going back at least to the 1960s. There is much evidence that the Church\nhierarchy did little or nothing to stop the abuse or to sanction the offenders who\nwere committing it, and that they did not report it to law enforcement agencies.\nVarious divisions of the Church have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle\nlawsuits. The numbers of priests, deacons, and children involved will almost\ncertainly never be known, but it is estimated that at least 4,400 priests and\ndeacons in the United States, or about 4% of all such officials, have been accused\nof sexual abuse, although fewer than 2,000 had the allegations against them\nproven (Terry & Smith, 2006). Given these estimates, the number of children who\nwere abused probably runs into the thousands. Symbolic Interactionism and Religion\nWhile functional and conflict theories look at the macro aspects of religion and\nsociety, symbolic interactionism looks at the micro aspects. It examines the role\nthat religion plays in our daily lives and the ways in which we interpret religious\nexperiences. For example, it emphasizes that beliefs and practices are not sacred\nunless people regard them as such. Once we regard them as sacred, they take on\nspecial significance and give meaning to our lives. Symbolic interactionists study\nthe ways in which people practice their faith and interact in houses of worship\nand other religious settings, and they study how and why religious faith and\npractice have positive consequences for individual psychological and physical\nwell-being.\nThe cross, Star of David, and the crescent and star are symbols of Islam,\nChristianity, and Judaism, respectively. The symbolic interactionist perspective\nemphasizes the ways in which individuals interpret their religious experiences and\nreligious symbols.\nzeevveez \u2013 Star of David Coexistence- 2 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nReligious symbols indicate the value of the symbolic interactionist approach. A\ncrescent moon and a star are just two shapes in the sky, but together they constitute the international symbol of Islam. A cross is merely two lines or bars in\nthe shape of a \u201ct,\u201d but to tens of millions of Christians it is a symbol with deeply\nreligious significance. A Star of David consists of two superimposed triangles in\nthe shape of a six-pointed star, but to Jews around the world it is a sign of their\nreligious faith and a reminder of their history of persecution.\nReligious rituals and ceremonies also illustrate the symbolic interactionist\napproach. They can be deeply intense and can involve crying, laughing, screaming,\ntrancelike conditions, a feeling of oneness with those around you, and other\nemotional and psychological states. For many people they can be transformative\nexperiences, while for others they are not transformative but are deeply moving\nnonetheless.\nKey Takeaways\nReligion ideally serves several functions. It gives meaning and purpose to life,\nreinforces social unity and stability, serves as an agent of social control, promotes\npsychological and physical well-being, and may motivate people to work for\npositive social change.\nOn the other hand, religion may help keep poor people happy with their lot in life,\npromote traditional views about gender roles, and engender intolerance toward\npeople whose religious faith differs from one\u2019s own.\nThe symbolic interactionist perspective emphasizes how religion affects the daily\nlives of individuals and how they interpret their religious experiences.\nReferences\nEmerson, M.

Two trends have been studied in particular: (a) secularization\nand (b) the rise of religious conservatism.\nSecularization\nSecularization refers to the weakening importance of religion in a society. It plays\nless of a role in people\u2019s lives, as they are less guided in their daily behavior by\nreligious beliefs. The influence of religious organizations in society also declines,\nand some individual houses of worship give more emphasis to worldly concerns\nsuch as soup kitchens than to spiritual issues. There is no doubt that religion is\nless important in modern society than it was before the rise of science in the 17th\nand 18th centuries. Scholars of religion have tried to determine the degree to\nwhich the United States has become more secularized during the last few decades\n(Finke & Stark, 2005; Fenn, 2001).\nThe best evidence shows that religion has declined in importance since the 1960s\nbut still remains a potent force in American society as a whole and for the\nindividual lives of Americans (Finke & Scheitle, 2005). Although membership in\nmainstream Protestant denominations has declined since the 1960s, membership\nin conservative denominations has risen. Most people (92% in the Pew survey)\nstill believe in God, and, as already noted, more than half of all Americans pray\ndaily.\nScholars also point to the continuing importance of civil religion, or the devotion\nof a nation\u2019s citizens to their society and government (Santiago, 2009). In the\nUnited States, love of country\u2014patriotism\u2014and admiration for many of its ideals\nare widespread. Citizens routinely engage in rituals, such as reciting the Pledge of\nAllegiance or singing the national anthem, that express their love of the United States. These beliefs and practices are the secular equivalent of traditional\nreligious beliefs and practices and thus a functional equivalent of religion.\nThe Rise of Religious Conservatism\nThe rise of religious conservatism also challenges the notion that secularization is\ndisplacing religion in American life. Religious conservatism in the U.S. context is\nthe belief that the Bible is the actual word of God. As noted earlier, religious\nconservatism includes the various Baptist denominations and any number of\nevangelical organizations, and its rapid rise was partly the result of fears that the\nUnited States was becoming too secularized. Many religious conservatives believe\nthat a return to the teachings of the Bible and religious spirituality is necessary to\ncombat the corrupting influences of modern life (Almond, Appleby, & Sivan,\n2003).\nThe rise of religious conservatism in the United States was partly the result of\nfears that the nation was becoming too secularized.\nThomas Quine \u2013 Small brick church \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nToday about one-third of Americans state a religious preference for a\nconservative denomination (Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, 2008). Because\nof their growing numbers, religious conservatives have been the subject of increasing research. They tend to hold politically conservative views on many\nissues, including abortion and the punishment of criminals, and are more likely\nthan people with other religious beliefs to believe in such things as the corporal\npunishment of children (Burdette, Ellison, & Hill, 2005). They are also more likely\nto believe in traditional roles for women.\nClosely related to the rise of religious conservatism has been the increasing\ninfluence of what has been termed the \u201cnew religious right\u201d in American politics\n(Martin, 2005; Capps, 1990; Moen, 1992). Since the 1980s, the religious right has\nbeen a potent force in the political scene at both the national and local levels,\nwith groups like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition effective in raising\nmoney, using the media, and lobbying elected officials. As its name implies, the\nreligious right tries to advance a conservative political agenda consistent with\nconservative religious concerns. Among other issues, it opposes legal abortion,\ngay rights, and violence and sex in the media, and it also advocates an increased\nreligious presence in public schools. Although the influence of the religious right\nhas waned since the 1990s, its influence on American politics is bound to be\ncontroversial for many years to come.\nKey Takeaways\nDespite concerns among many observers that secularization has been occurring,\nreligion remains important in many Americans\u2019 lives and a potent force in\nAmerican society.\nMembership in conservative denominations has increased in the United States in\nrecent decades. Today about one-third of Americans state a religious preference\nfor a conservative denomination.\nAddressing Religious Issues: What Sociology Suggests\nSociological theory and research are relevant for understanding and addressing\ncertain religious issues. One major issue today is religious intolerance. \u00c9mile\nDurkheim did not stress the hatred and conflict that religion has promoted over\nthe centuries, but this aspect of conflict theory\u2019s view of religion should not be\nforgotten. Certainly religious tolerance should be promoted among all peoples,\nand strategies for doing so include education efforts about the world\u2019s religions\nand interfaith activities for youth and adults. The Center for Religious Tolerance\n(http://www.c-r-t.org/index.php), headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, is one of the many local and national organizations in the United States that strive to\npromote interfaith understanding. In view of the hostility toward Muslims that\nincreased in the United States after 9/11, it is perhaps particularly important for\neducation efforts and other activities to promote understanding of Islam.\nReligion may also help address other social issues. In this regard, we noted earlier\nthat religious belief and practice seem to promote physical health and\npsychological well-being. To the extent this is true, efforts that promote the\npractice of faith may enhance one\u2019s physical and mental health.. In view of the\nhealth problems of older people and also their greater religiosity, some scholars\nurge that such efforts be especially undertaken for people in their older years\n(Moberg, 2008). We also noted that religiosity helps reduce drinking, drug use,\nand sexual behavior among adolescents and perhaps among adults. This does not\nmean that religion should be forced on anyone against his or her will, but this\nbody of research does suggest that efforts by houses of worship to promote\nreligious activities among their adolescents and younger children may help\nprevent or otherwise minimize risky behaviors during this important period of the\nlife course.\nReferences\nAlmond, G.

Socio-Cultural Context of Psychological Development\nChapter 9 \u2013 Introduction to Media and Technology\n9.1 Introduction to Media and Technology\nDerived from Introduction to Media and Technology by OpenStax\nFacebook, Twitter, and Instagram are just a few examples of social media that\nincreasingly shape how we interact with the world. (Photo courtesy of Khalid\nAlbaih/flickr)\nHow many good friends do you have? How many people do you meet up with for\ncoffee or a movie? How many would you call with news about an illness or invite\nto your wedding? Now, how many \u201cfriends\u201d do you have on Facebook? How often\ndo you post a \"selfie\" online? How often do you check e-mail? How often do you\nmeet friends for a meal and spend your time texting other people instead of\ntalking to each other? Technology has changed how we interact with each other.\nIt has turned \u201cfriend\u201d into a verb and has made it possible to share mundane\nnews (\u201cMy dog just threw up under the bed! Ugh!\u201d) with hundreds or even\nthousands of people who might know you only slightly, if at all. You might be\nglued to your cell phone, even when you should be focused on driving your car, or you might text in class instead of listening to the professor's lecture. When we\nhave the ability to stay constantly connected to a data stream, it is easy to lose\nfocus on the here and now.\nAt the same time that technology is expanding the boundaries of our social\ncircles, various media are also changing how we perceive and interact with each\nother. We don\u2019t only use Facebook to keep in touch with friends; we also use it to\n\u201clike\u201d certain television shows, products, or celebrities. Even television is no\nlonger a one-way medium; it is an interactive one. We are encouraged to tweet,\ntext, or call in to vote for contestants in everything from singing competitions to\nmatchmaking endeavors\u2014bridging the gap between our entertainment and our\nown lives.\nHow does technology change our lives for the better? Or does it? When you\ntweet a social cause, share an ice bucket challenge video on YouTube, or cut and\npaste a status update about cancer awareness on Facebook, are you promoting\nsocial change? Does the immediate and constant flow of information mean we\nare more aware and engaged than any society before us? Or are Keeping Up With\nthe Kardashians and The Real Housewives franchise today\u2019s version of ancient\nRome\u2019s \u201cbread and circuses\u201d\u2013\u2013distractions and entertainment to keep the\nworking classes complacent about the inequities of their society?\nThese are some of the questions that interest sociologists. How might we\nexamine these issues from a sociological perspective? A functionalist would\nprobably focus on what social purposes technology and media serve. For\nexample, the web is both a form of technology and of media, and it links\nindividuals and nations in a communication network that facilitates both small\nfamily discussions and global trade networks. A functionalist would also be\ninterested in the manifest functions of media and technology, as well as their role\nin social dysfunction. Someone applying the conflict perspective would probably\nfocus on the systematic inequality created by differential access to media and\ntechnology. For example, how can middle-class U.S. citizens be sure the news\nthey hear is an objective account of reality, unsullied by moneyed political\ninterests? Someone applying the interactionist perspective to technology and the\nmedia might seek to understand the difference between the real lives we lead\nand the reality depicted on \u201creality\u201d television shows, such as The Bachelor.\nThroughout this chapter, we will use our sociological imagination to explore how\nmedia and technology impact society. \u00a9 Mar 13, 2015 OpenStax.

Technology Today\nDerived from Technology Today by OpenStax\nTechnology is the application of science to address the problems of daily life, from\nhunting tools and agricultural advances, to manual and electronic ways of\ncomputing, to today\u2019s tablets and smartphones. (Photo (a) courtesy of Wikimedia\nCommons; Photo (b) courtesy of Martin Pettitt/flickr; Photo (c) courtesy of\nWhitefield d./flickr; Photo (d) courtesy of Andrew Parnell/flickr; Photo (e)\ncourtesy of Jemimus/flickr; Photo (f) courtesy of K\u0101rlis Dambr\u0101ns/flickr) It is easy to look at the latest sleek Apple product and think technology is a recent\naddition to our world. But from the steam engine to the most cutting-edge\nrobotic surgery tools, technology has described the application of science to\naddress the problems of daily life. We might look back at the enormous and\nclunky computers of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an iPod Shuffle\nand roll our eyes in disbelief. But chances are thirty years from now our skinny\nlaptops and iPods will look just as archaic.\nWhat Is Technology?\nWhile most people probably picture computers and cell phones when the subject\nof technology comes up, technology is not merely a product of the modern era.\nFor example, fire and stone tools were important forms that technology\ndeveloped during the Stone Age. Just as the availability of digital technology\nshapes how we live today, the creation of stone tools changed how premodern\nhumans lived and how well they ate. From the first calculator, invented in 2400\nB.C.E. Babylon in the form of an abacus, to the predecessor of the modern\ncomputer, created in 1882 by Charles Babbage, all of our technological\ninnovations are advancements on previous iterations. And indeed, all aspects of\nour lives today are influenced by technology. In agriculture, the introduction of\nmachines that can till, thresh, plant, and harvest greatly reduced the need for\nmanual labor, which in turn meant there were fewer rural jobs. This led to the\nurbanization of society, as well as lowered birthrates because there was less need\nfor large families to work the farms. In the criminal justice system, the ability to\nascertain innocence through DNA testing has saved the lives of people on death\nrow. The examples are endless: technology plays a role in absolutely every aspect\nof our lives. Technological Inequality\nSome schools sport cutting-edge computer labs, while others sport barbed wire.\nIs your academic technology at the cusp of innovation, relatively disadvantaged,\nor somewhere in between? (Photo courtesy of Carlos Martinez/flickr)\nAs with any improvement to human society, not everyone has equal access.\nTechnology, in particular, often creates changes that lead to ever greater\ninequalities. In short, the gap gets wider faster. This technological stratification\nhas led to a new focus on ensuring better access for all.\nThere are two forms of technological stratification. The first is differential class-\nbased access to technology in the form of the digital divide. This digital divide has\nled to the second form, a knowledge gap, which is, as it sounds, an ongoing and\nincreasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology.\nSimply put, students in well-funded schools receive more exposure to technology\nthan students in poorly funded schools. Those students with more exposure gain\nmore proficiency, which makes them far more marketable in an increasingly\ntechnology-based job market and leaves our society divided into those with\ntechnological knowledge and those without. Even as we improve access, we have\nfailed to address an increasingly evident gap in e-readiness\u2014the ability to sort\nthrough, interpret, and process knowledge (Sciadas 2003). Since the beginning of the millennium, social science researchers have tried to\nbring attention to the digital divide, the uneven access to technology among\ndifferent races, classes, and geographic areas. The term became part of the\ncommon lexicon in 1996, when then Vice President Al Gore used it in a speech.\nThis was the point when personal computer use shifted dramatically, from\n300,000 users in 1991 to more than 10 million users by 1996 (Rappaport 2009). In\npart, the issue of the digital divide had to do with communities that received\ninfrastructure upgrades that enabled high-speed Internet access, upgrades that\nlargely went to affluent urban and suburban areas, leaving out large swaths of the\ncountry.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, technology access was also a big part of the\nschool experience for those whose communities could afford it. Early in the\nmillennium, poorer communities had little or no technology access, while well-off\nfamilies had personal computers at home and wired classrooms in their schools.\nIn the 2000s, however, the prices for low-end computers dropped considerably,\nand it appeared the digital divide was naturally ending. Research demonstrates\nthat technology use and Internet access still vary a great deal by race, class, and\nage in the United States, though most studies agree that there is minimal\ndifference in Internet use by adult men and adult women.\nData from the Pew Research Center (2011) suggests the emergence of yet\nanother divide. As technological devices gets smaller and more mobile, larger\npercentages of minority groups (such as Latinos and African Americans) are using\ntheir phones to connect to the Internet. In fact, about 50 percent of people in\nthese minority groups connect to the web via such devices, whereas only one-\nthird of whites do (Washington 2011). And while it might seem that the Internet is\nthe Internet, regardless of how you get there, there\u2019s a notable difference. Tasks\nlike updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or filling out a job application are much harder on a cell\nphone than on a wired computer in the home. As a result, the digital divide might\nmean no access to computers or the Internet, but could mean access to the kind\nof online technology that allows for empowerment, not just entertainment\n(Washington 2011).\nMossberger, Tolbert, and Gilbert (2006) demonstrated that the majority of the\ndigital divide for African Americans could be explained by demographic and\ncommunity-level characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and geographic\nlocation. For the Latino population, ethnicity alone, regardless of economics or geography, seemed to limit technology use. Liff and Shepherd (2004) found that\nwomen, who are accessing technology shaped primarily by male users, feel less\nconfident in their Internet skills and have less Internet access at both work and\nhome. Finally, Guill\u00e9n and Su\u00e1rez (2005) found that the global digital divide\nresulted from both the economic and sociopolitical characteristics of countries.\nUse of Technology and Social Media in Society by Individuals\nDo you own an e-reader or tablet? What about your parents or your friends? How\noften do you check social media or your cell phone? Does all this technology have\na positive or negative impact on your life? When it comes to cell phones, 67\npercent of users check their phones for messages or calls even when the phone\nwasn\u2019t ringing. In addition, \u201c44% of cell owners have slept with their phone next\nto their bed because they wanted to make sure they didn\u2019t miss any calls, text\nmessages, or other updates during the night and 29% of cell owners describe their\ncell phone as \u2018something they can\u2019t imagine living without\u2019\u201d (Smith 2012).\nWhile people report that cell phones make it easier to stay in touch, simplify\nplanning and scheduling their daily activities, and increase their productivity,\nthat\u2019s not the only impact of increased cell phone ownership in the United States.\nSmith also reports that \u201croughly one in five cell owners say that their phone has\nmade it at least somewhat harder to forget about work at home or on the\nweekends; to give people their undivided attention; or to focus on a single task\nwithout being distracted\u201d (Smith 2012).\nA new survey from the Pew Research Center reported that 73 percent of adults\nengage in some sort of social networking online. Facebook was the most popular\nplatform, and both Facebook users and Instagram users check their sites on a\ndaily basis. Over a third of users check their sites more than once a day (Duggan\nand Smith 2013).\nWith so many people using social media both in the United States and abroad, it is\nno surprise that social media is a powerful force for social change. You will read\nmore about the fight for democracy in the Middle East embodied in the Arab\nSpring in Chapters 17 and 21, but spreading democracy is just the tip of the\niceberg when it comes to using social media to incite change. For example,\nMcKenna Pope, a thirteen-year-old girl, used the Internet to successfully petition\nHasbro to fight gender stereotypes by creating a gender-neutral Easy-Bake Oven instead of using only the traditional pink color (Kumar 2014). Meanwhile in Latvia,\ntwo twenty-three-year-olds used a U.S. State Department grant to create an e-\npetition platform so citizens could submit ideas directly to the Latvian\ngovernment. If at least 20 percent of the Latvian population (roughly 407,200\npeople) supports a petition, the government will look at it (Kumar 2014).\nOnline Privacy and Security\nAs we increase our footprints on the web by going online more often to connect\nsocially, share material, conduct business, and store information, we also increase\nour vulnerability to those with criminal intent. The Pew Research Center recently\npublished a report that indicated the number of Internet users who express\nconcern over the extent of personal information about them available online\njumped 17 percent between 2009 and 2013. In that same survey, 12 percent of\nrespondents indicated they had been harassed online, and 11 percent indicated\nthat personal information, such as their Social Security number, had been stolen\n(Rainie, Kiesler, Kang, and Madden 2013).\nOnline privacy and security is a key organizational concern as well. Recent large-\nscale data breaches at retailers such as Target, financial powerhouses such as JP\nMorgan, the government health insurance site Healthcare.gov, and cell phone\nproviders such as Verizon, exposed millions of people to the threat of identity\ntheft when hackers got access to personal information by compromising website\nsecurity.\nFor example, in late August 2014, hackers breached the iCloud data storage site\nand promptly leaked wave after wave of nude photos from the private accounts\nof actors such as Jennifer Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst (Lewis 2014). While large-\nscale data breaches that affect corporations and celebrities are more likely to\nmake the news, individuals may put their personal information at risk simply by\nclicking a suspect link in an official sounding e-mail.\nHow can individuals protect their data? Numerous facts sheets available through\nthe government, nonprofits, and the private sector outline common safety\nmeasures, including the following: become familiar with privacy rights; read\nprivacy policies when making a purchase (rather than simply clicking \u201caccept\u201d);\ngive out only the minimum information requested by any source; ask why\ninformation is being collected, how it is going to be used, and who will have access it; and monitor your credit history for red flags that indicate your identity\nhas been compromised.\nNet Neutrality\nThe issue of net neutrality, the principle that all Internet data should be treated\nequally by Internet service providers, is part of the national debate about Internet\naccess and the digital divide. On one side of this debate is the belief that those\nwho provide Internet service, like those who provide electricity and water, should\nbe treated as common carriers, legally prohibited from discriminating based on\nthe customer or nature of the goods. Supporters of net neutrality suggest that\nwithout such legal protections, the Internet could be divided into \u201cfast\u201d and\n\u201cslow\u201d lanes. A conflict perspective theorist might suggest that this discrimination\nwould allow bigger corporations, such as Amazon, to pay Internet providers a\npremium for faster service, which could lead to gaining an advantage that would\ndrive small, local competitors out of business.\nThe other side of the debate holds the belief that designating Internet service\nproviders as common carriers would constitute an unreasonable regulatory\nburden and limit the ability of telecommunication companies to operate\nprofitably. A functional perspective theorist might point out that, without profits,\ncompanies would not invest in making improvements to their Internet service or\nexpanding those services to underserved areas. The final decision rests with the\nFederal Communications Commission and the federal government, which must\ndecide how to fairly regulate broadband providers without dividing the Internet\ninto haves and have-nots.\nSummary\nTechnology is the application of science to address the problems of daily life. The\nfast pace of technological advancement means the advancements are continuous,\nbut that not everyone has equal access. The gap created by this unequal access\nhas been termed the digital divide. The knowledge gap refers to an effect of the\ndigital divide: the lack of knowledge or information that keeps those who were\nnot exposed to technology from gaining marketable skills.\nGlossary digital divide\nthe uneven access to technology around race, class, and geographic lines\ne-readiness\nthe ability to sort through, interpret, and process digital knowledge\nknowledge gap\nthe gap in information that builds as groups grow up without access to\ntechnology\nnet neutrality\nthe principle that all Internet data should be treated equally by internet\nservice providers\nplanned obsolescence\nthe act of a technology company planning for a product to be obsolete or\nunable from the time it\u2019s created\ntechnology\nthe application of science to solve problems in daily life\nFurther Research\nTo learn more about the digital divide and why it matters, check out these web\nsites: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Digital_Divide and http://openstaxcollege.org/\nl/Digital_Divide2\nTo find out more about Internet privacy and security, check out the web site\nbelow: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2EPrivacy\nReferences\nGuill\u00e9n, M.F., and S.L.

(Photo courtesy of shay sowden/flickr)\nTechnology and the media are interwoven, and neither can be separated from\ncontemporary society in most core and semi-peripheral nations. Media is a term\nthat refers to all print, digital, and electronic means of communication. From the\ntime the printing press was created (and even before), technology has influenced\nhow and where information is shared. Today, it is impossible to discuss media and\nthe ways societies communicate without addressing the fast-moving pace of\ntechnology change. Twenty years ago, if you wanted to share news of your baby\u2019s\nbirth or a job promotion, you phoned or wrote letters. You might tell a handful of\npeople, but you probably wouldn\u2019t call up several hundred, including your old\nhigh school chemistry teacher, to let them know. Now, you might join an online\ncommunity of parents-to-be even before you announce your pregnancy via a\nstaged Instagram picture. The circle of communication is wider than ever and\nwhen we talk about how societies engage with technology, we must take media\ninto account, and vice versa. Technology creates media. The comic book you bought your daughter is a form of\nmedia, as is the movie you streamed for family night, the web site you used to\norder takeout, the billboard you passed on the way to pick up your food, and the\nnewspaper you read while you were waiting for it. Without technology, media\nwould not exist, but remember, technology is more than just the media we are\nexposed to.\nCategorizing Technology\nThere is no one way of dividing technology into categories. Whereas once it might\nhave been simple to classify innovations such as machine-based or drug-based or\nthe like, the interconnected strands of technological development mean that\nadvancement in one area might be replicated in dozens of others. For simplicity\u2019s\nsake, we will look at how the U.S. Patent Office, which receives patent\napplications for nearly all major innovations worldwide, addresses patents. This\nregulatory body will patent three types of innovation. Utility patents are the first\ntype. These are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and useful\nprocess, product, or machine, or for a significant improvement to existing\ntechnologies. The second type of patent is a design patent. Commonly conferred\nin architecture and industrial design, this means someone has invented a new and\noriginal design for a manufactured product. Plant patents, the final type,\nrecognize the discovery of new plant types that can be asexually reproduced.\nWhile genetically modified food is the hot-button issue within this category,\nfarmers have long been creating new hybrids and patenting them. A more\nmodern example might be food giant Monsanto, which patents corn with built-in\npesticide (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 2011).\nAnderson and Tushman (1990) suggest an evolutionary model of technological\nchange, in which a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of\nvariations. Once those are assessed, a prototype emerges, and then a period of\nslight adjustments to the technology, interrupted by a breakthrough. For\nexample, floppy disks were improved and upgraded, then replaced by Zip disks,\nwhich were in turn improved to the limits of the technology and were then\nreplaced by flash drives. This is essentially a generational model for categorizing\ntechnology, in which first-generation technology is a relatively unsophisticated\njumping-off point that leads to an improved second generation, and so on.\nVIOLENCE IN MEDIA AND VIDEO GAMES: DOES IT MATTER? One of the most popular video games, Grand Theft Auto, has frequently been at\nthe center of debate about gratuitous violence in the gaming world. (Photo\ncourtesy of Meddy Garnet/flickr)\nA glance through popular video game and movie titles geared toward children\nand teens shows the vast spectrum of violence that is displayed, condoned, and\nacted out.\nAs a way to guide parents in their programming choices, the motion picture\nindustry put a rating system in place in the 1960s. But new media\u2014video games\nin particular\u2014proved to be uncharted territory. In 1994, the Entertainment\nSoftware Rating Board (ERSB) set a ratings system for games that addressed\nissues of violence, sexuality, drug use, and the like. California took it a step further\nby making it illegal to sell video games to underage buyers. The case led to a\nheated debate about personal freedoms and child protection, and in 2011, the\nU.S. Supreme Court ruled against the California law, stating it violated freedom of\nspeech (ProCon 2012). Children\u2019s play has often involved games of aggression\u2014from cowboys and\nIndians, to cops and robbers, to fake sword fights. Many articles report on the\ncontroversy surrounding the suggested link between violent video games and\nviolent behavior. Is the link real? Psychologists Anderson and Bushman (2001)\nreviewed forty-plus years of research on the subject and, in 2003, determined\nthat there are causal linkages between violent video game use and aggression.\nThey found that children who had just played a violent video game demonstrated\nan immediate increase in hostile or aggressive thoughts, an increase in aggressive\nemotions, and physiological arousal that increased the chances of acting out\naggressive behavior (Anderson 2003).\nUltimately, repeated exposure to this kind of violence leads to increased\nexpectations that violence is a solution, increased violent behavioral scripts, and\nan increased cognitive accessibility to violent behavior (Anderson 2003). In short,\npeople who play a lot of these games find it easier to imagine and access violent\nsolutions than nonviolent ones, and they are less socialized to see violence as a\nnegative. While these facts do not mean there is no role for video games, it\nshould give players pause. In 2013, The American Psychological Association began\nan expansive meta-analysis of peer-reviewed research analyzing the effect of\nmedia violence. Results are expected in 2014.\nTypes of Media and Technology\nMedia and technology have evolved hand in hand, from early print to modern\npublications, from radio to television to film. New media emerge constantly, such\nas we see in the online world.\nPrint Newspaper\nEarly forms of print media, found in ancient Rome, were hand-copied onto boards\nand carried around to keep the citizenry informed. With the invention of the\nprinting press, the way that people shared ideas changed, as information could be\nmass produced and stored. For the first time, there was a way to spread\nknowledge and information more efficiently; many credit this development as\nleading to the Renaissance and ultimately the Age of Enlightenment. This is not to\nsay that newspapers of old were more trustworthy than the Weekly World\nNews and National Enquirer are today. Sensationalism abounded, as did\ncensorship that forbade any subjects that would incite the populace. The invention of the telegraph, in the mid-1800s, changed print media almost as\nmuch as the printing press. Suddenly information could be transmitted in\nminutes. As the nineteenth century became the twentieth, U.S. publishers such as\nHearst redefined the world of print media and wielded an enormous amount of\npower to socially construct national and world events. Of course, even as the\nmedia empires of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer were growing,\nprint media also allowed for the dissemination of countercultural or revolutionary\nmaterials. Internationally, Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Irksa (The Spark) newspaper was\npublished in 1900 and played a role in Russia\u2019s growing communist movement\n(World Association of Newspapers 2004).\nWith the invention and widespread use of television in the mid-twentieth century,\nnewspaper circulation steadily dropped off, and in the 21st century, circulation\nhas dropped further as more people turn to internet news sites and other forms\nof new media to stay informed. According to the Pew Research Center, 2009 saw\nan unprecedented drop in newspaper circulation\u2013\u2013down 10.6 percent from the\nyear before (Pew 2010).\nThis shift away from newspapers as a source of information has profound effects\non societies. When the news is given to a large diverse conglomerate of people, it\nmust maintain some level of broad-based reporting and balance in order to\nappeal to a broad audience and keep them subscribing. As newspapers decline,\nnews sources become more fractured, so each segment of the audience can\nchoose specifically what it wants to hear and what it wants to avoid. Increasingly,\nnewspapers are shifting online in an attempt to remain relevant. It is hard to tell\nwhat impact new media platforms will have on the way we receive and process\ninformation.\nIncreasingly, newspapers are shifting online in an attempt to remain relevant. It is\nhard to tell what impact new media platforms will have on the way we receive\nand process information. The Pew Research Center\u2019s Project for Excellence in\nJournalism (2013) reported that audiences for all the major news magazines\ndeclined in 2012, though digital ad revenue increased. The same report suggested\nthat, while newspaper circulation is holding steady at around $10 billion after\nyears of decline, it is digital pay plans that allow newspapers to keep their heads\nabove water, and the digital ad revenue that is increasing for news magazines is\nnot enough to compensate for print revenue loss in newspapers. A 2014 report suggested that U.S. adults read a median of five books per year in\n2013, which is about average. But are they reading traditional print or e-books?\nAbout 69 percent of people said they had read at least one printed book in the\npast year, versus 28 percent who said they\u2019d read an e-book (DeSilver 2014). Is\nprint more effective at conveying information? In recent study, Mangen,\nWalgermo, and Bronnick (2013) found that students who read on paper\nperformed slightly better than those who read an e-book on an open-book\nreading comprehension exam of multiple-choice and short-answer questions.\nWhile a meta-analysis of research by Andrews (1992) seemed to confirm that\npeople read more slowly and comprehend less when reading from screens, a\nmeta-analysis of more recent research on this topic does not show anything\ndefinite (Noyes and Garland 2008).\nTelevision and Radio\nRadio programming obviously preceded television, but both shaped people\u2019s lives\nin much the same way. In both cases, information (and entertainment) could be\nenjoyed at home, with a kind of immediacy and community that newspapers\ncould not offer. For instance, many people in the United States might remember\nwhen they saw on television or heard on the radio that the Twin Towers in New\nYork City had been attacked in 2001. Even though people were in their own\nhomes, media allowed them to share these moments in real time. This same kind\nof separate-but-communal approach occurred with entertainment too. School-\naged children and office workers gathered to discuss the previous night\u2019s\ninstallment of a serial television or radio show.\nRight up through the 1970s, U.S. television was dominated by three major\nnetworks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) that competed for ratings and advertising dollars.\nThe networks also exerted a lot of control over what people watched. Public\ntelevision, in contrast, offered an educational nonprofit alternative to the\nsensationalization of news spurred by the network competition for viewers and\nadvertising dollars. Those sources\u2014PBS (Public Broadcasting Service), the BBC\n(British Broadcasting Company), and CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company)\u2014\ngarnered a worldwide reputation for high-quality programming and a global\nperspective. Al Jazeera, the Arabic independent news station, has joined this\ngroup as a similar media force that broadcasts to people worldwide. The impact of television on U.S. society is hard to overstate. By the late 1990s, 98\npercent of U.S. homes had at least one television set, and the average person\nwatched between two and a half and five hours of television daily. All this\ntelevision has a powerful socializing effect, providing reference groups while\nreinforcing social norms, values, and beliefs.\nFilm\nThe film industry took off in the 1930s, when color and sound were first\nintegrated into feature films. Like television, early films were unifying for society:\nas people gathered in theaters to watch new releases, they would laugh, cry, and\nbe scared together. Movies also act as time capsules or cultural touchstones for\nsociety. From Westerns starring the tough-talking Clint Eastwood to the biopic of\nFacebook founder and Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg, movies illustrate\nsociety\u2019s dreams, fears, and experiences. While many consider Hollywood the\nepicenter of moviemaking, India\u2019s Bollywood actually produces more films per\nyear, speaking to the cultural aspirations and norms of Indian society.\nIncreasingly, people are watching films online via Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and\nother streaming services. While most streaming video companies keep their user\ndata secret, Nielsen estimated that 38 percent of U.S. citizens accessed Netflix in\n2013. In 2013, Google, Inc. reported that YouTube served 1 billion unique viewers\nevery month\u2014an impressive number, considering that it amounts to one-third of\nthe estimated 3 billion accessing the Internet every month (Reuters 2013;\nInternational Telecommunication Union 2014).\nNew Media Netflix, one form of new media, exchanges information in the form of DVDs to\nusers in the comfort of their own homes. (Photo courtesy of Marit & Toomas\nHinnosaar/flickr)\nNew media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange. These\ninclude social networking sites, blogs, podcasts, wikis, and virtual worlds. Clearly,\nthe list grows almost daily. However, there is no guarantee that the information\noffered is accurate. In fact, the immediacy of new media coupled with the lack of\noversight means we must be more careful than ever to ensure our news is coming\nfrom accurate sources.\nPLANNED OBSOLESCENCE: TECHNOLOGY THAT\u2019S BUILT TO CRASH\nPeople have trouble keeping up with technological innovation. But people may\nnot be to blame, as manufacturers intentionally develop products with short life\nspans. (Photo courtesy of Mathias F. Svendsen/flickr)\nChances are your mobile phone company, as well as the makers of your laptop\nand your household appliances, are all counting on their products to fail. Not too\nquickly, of course, or consumers wouldn't stand for it\u2014but frequently enough\nthat you might find that it costs far more to fix a device than to replace it with a\nnewer model. Or you find the phone company e-mails you saying that you\u2019re\neligible for a free new phone, because yours is a whopping two years old. And\nappliance repair people say that while they might be fixing some machines that\nare twenty years old, they generally aren\u2019t fixing those that are seven years old; newer models are built to be thrown out. This strategy is called planned\nobsolescence, and it is the business practice of planning for a product to be\nobsolete or unusable from the time it is created.\nTo some extent, planned obsolescence is a natural extension of new and\nemerging technologies. After all, who is going to cling to an enormous and slow\ndesktop computer from 2000 when a few hundred dollars can buy one that is\nsignificantly faster and better? But the practice is not always so benign. The\nclassic example of planned obsolescence is the nylon stocking. Women\u2019s\nstockings\u2014once an everyday staple of women\u2019s lives\u2013\u2013get \u201cruns\u201d or \u201cladders\u201d\nafter only a few wearings. This requires the stockings to be discarded and new\nones purchased. Not surprisingly, the garment industry did not invest heavily in\nfinding a rip-proof fabric; it was in manufacturers' best interest that their product\nbe regularly replaced.\nThose who use Microsoft Windows might feel that like the women who\npurchased endless pairs of stockings, they are victims of planned obsolescence.\nEvery time Windows releases a new operating system, there are typically not\nmany innovations in it that consumers feel they must have. However, the\nsoftware programs are upwardly compatible only. This means that while the new\nversions can read older files, the old version cannot read the newer ones. In short\norder, those who have not upgraded right away find themselves unable to open\nfiles sent by colleagues or friends, and they usually wind up upgrading as well.\nUltimately, whether you are getting rid of your old product because you are being\noffered a shiny new free one (like the latest smartphone model), or because it\ncosts more to fix than to replace (like the iPod model), or because not doing so\nleaves you out of the loop (like the Windows model), the result is the same. It\nmight just make you nostalgic for your old Sony Discman and simple DVD player.\nProduct Advertising\nCompanies use advertising to sell to us, but the way they reach us is changing.\nNaomi Klein identified the destructive impact of corporate branding her 1999\ntext, No Logo, an antiglobalization treatise that focused on sweatshops, corporate\npower, and anticonsumerist social movements. In the post-millennial society,\nsynergistic advertising practices ensure you are receiving the same message from\na variety of sources and on a variety of platforms. For example, you may see billboards for Miller beer on your way to a stadium, sit down to watch a game\npreceded by a Miller commercial on the big screen, and watch a halftime ad in\nwhich people are shown holding up the trademark bottles. Chances are you can\nguess which brand of beer is for sale at the concession stand.\nAdvertising has changed, as technology and media have allowed consumers to\nbypass traditional advertising venues. From the invention of the remote control,\nwhich allows us to skip television advertising without leaving our seats, to\nrecording devices that let us watch programs but skip the ads, conventional\ntelevision advertising is on the wane. And print media is no different. Advertising\nrevenue in newspapers and on television fell significantly in 2009, which shows\nthat companies need new ways of getting their messages to consumers.\nOne model companies are considering to address this advertising downturn uses\nthe same philosophy as celebrity endorsements, just on a different scale.\nCompanies are hiring college students to be their on-campus representatives, and\nthey are looking for popular students engaged in high-profile activities like sports,\nfraternities, and music. The marketing team is betting that if we buy perfume\nbecause Beyonc\u00e9 tells us to, we\u2019ll also choose our cell phone or smoothie brand if\na popular student encourages that choice. According to an article in the New York\nTimes, fall semester 2011 saw an estimated 10,000 U.S. college students working\non campus as brand ambassadors for products from Red Bull energy drinks to\nHewlett-Packard computers (Singer 2011). As the companies figure it, college\nstudents will trust one source of information above all: other students.\nHomogenization and Fragmentation\nDespite the variety of media at hand, the mainstream news and entertainment\nyou enjoy are increasingly homogenized. Research by McManus (1995) suggests\nthat different news outlets all tell the same stories, using the same sources,\nresulting in the same message, presented with only slight variations. So whether\nyou are reading the New York Times or the CNN\u2019s web site, the coverage of\nnational events like a major court case or political issue will likely be the same.\nSimultaneously with this homogenization among the major news outlets, the\nopposite process is occurring in the newer media streams. With so many choices,\npeople increasingly customize their news experience, minimizing their\nopportunity to encounter information that does not jive with their worldview (Prior 2005). For instance, those who are staunchly Republican can avoid centrist\nor liberal-leaning cable news shows and web sites that would show Democrats in\na favorable light. They know to seek out Fox News over MSNBC, just as Democrats\nknow to do the opposite. Further, people who want to avoid politics completely\ncan choose to visit web sites that deal only with entertainment or that will keep\nthem up to date on sports scores. They have an easy way to avoid information\nthey do not wish to hear.\nSummary\nMedia and technology have been interwoven from the earliest days of human\ncommunication. The printing press, the telegraph, and the Internet are all\nexamples of their intersection. Mass media have allowed for more shared social\nexperiences, but new media now create a seemingly endless amount of airtime\nfor any and every voice that wants to be heard. Advertising has also changed with\ntechnology. New media allow consumers to bypass traditional advertising venues\nand cause companies to be more innovative and intrusive as they try to gain our\nattention.\nGlossary\ndesign patents\npatents that are granted when someone has invented a new and original\ndesign for a manufactured product\nevolutionary model of technological change\na breakthrough in one form of technology that leads to a number of\nvariations, from which a prototype emerges, followed by a period of slight\nadjustments to the technology, interrupted by a breakthrough\nmedia\nall print, digital, and electronic means of communication\nnew media all interactive forms of information exchange\nplant patents\npatents that recognize the discovery of new plant types that can be\nasexually reproduced\nutility patents\npatents that are granted for the invention or discovery of any new and\nuseful process, product, or machine\nFurther Research\nTo get a sense of the timeline of technology, check out this web\nsite: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Tech_History\nTo learn more about new media, click\nhere: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/new_media\nTo understand how independent media coverage differs from major corporate\naffiliated news outlets, review material from the Democracy Now!\nwebsite: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2EDemoNow\nReferences\nAnderson, C.A., and B.J.

(Photo courtesy of Cambodia4kidsorg/flickr)\nTechnology, and increasingly media, has always driven globalization. In a\nlandmark book, Thomas Friedman (2005), identified several ways in which\ntechnology \u201cflattened\u201d the globe and contributed to our global economy. The first\nedition of The World Is Flat, written in 2005, posits that core economic concepts\nwere changed by personal computing and high-speed Internet. Access to these\ntwo technological shifts has allowed core-nation corporations to recruit workers\nin call centers located in China or India. Using examples like a Midwestern U.S.\nwoman who runs a business from her home via the call centers of Bangalore,\nIndia, Friedman warns that this new world order will exist whether core-nation\nbusinesses are ready or not, and that in order to keep its key economic role in the\nworld, the United States will need to pay attention to how it prepares workers of\nthe twenty-first century for this dynamic.\nOf course not everyone agrees with Friedman\u2019s theory. Many economists pointed\nout that in reality innovation, economic activity, and population still gather in\ngeographically attractive areas, and they continue to create economic peaks and\nvalleys, which are by no means flattened out to mean equality for all. China\u2019s hugely innovative and powerful cities of Shanghai and Beijing are worlds away\nfrom the rural squalor of the country\u2019s poorest denizens.\nIt is worth noting that Friedman is an economist, not a sociologist. His work\nfocuses on the economic gains and risks this new world order entails. In this\nsection, we will look more closely at how media globalization and technological\nglobalization play out in a sociological perspective. As the names suggest, media\nglobalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross-cultural\nexchange of ideas, while technological globalization refers to the cross-cultural\ndevelopment and exchange of technology.\nMedia Globalization\nLyons (2005) suggests that multinational corporations are the primary vehicle of\nmedia globalization, and these corporations control global mass-media content\nand distribution (Compaine 2005). It is true, when looking at who controls which\nmedia outlets, that there are fewer independent news sources as larger and\nlarger conglomerates develop. The United States offers about 1,500 newspapers,\n2,600 book publishers, and an equal number of television stations, plus 6,000\nmagazines and a whopping 10,000 radio outlets (Bagdikian 2004).\nOn the surface, there is endless opportunity to find diverse media outlets. But the\nnumbers are misleading. Media consolidation is a process in which fewer and\nfewer owners control the majority of media outlets. This creates an oligopoly in\nwhich a few firms dominate the media marketplace. In 1983, a mere 50\ncorporations owned the bulk of mass-media outlets. Today in the United States\n(which has no government-owned media) just five companies control 90 percent\nof media outlets (McChesney 1999). Ranked by 2014 company revenue, Comcast\nis the biggest, followed by the Disney Corporation, Time Warner, CBS, and Viacom\n(Time.com 2014). What impact does this consolidation have on the type of\ninformation to which the U.S. public is exposed? Does media consolidation\ndeprive the public of multiple viewpoints and limit its discourse to the\ninformation and opinions shared by a few sources? Why does it matter?\nMonopolies matter because less competition typically means consumers are less\nwell served since dissenting opinions or diverse viewpoints are less likely to be\nfound. Media consolidation results in the following dysfunctions. First,\nconsolidated media owes more to its stockholders than to the public. Publicly traded Fortune 500 companies must pay more attention to their profitability and\nto government regulators than to the public's right to know. The few companies\nthat control most of the media, because they are owned by the power elite,\nrepresent the political and social interests of only a small minority. In an oligopoly\nthere are fewer incentives to innovate, improve services, or decrease prices.\nWhile some social scientists predicted that the increase in media forms would\ncreate a global village (McLuhan 1964), current research suggests that the public\nsphere accessing the global village will tend to be rich, Caucasoid, and English-\nspeaking (Jan 2009). As shown by the spring 2011 uprisings throughout the Arab\nworld, technology really does offer a window into the news of the world. For\nexample, here in the United States we saw internet updates of Egyptian events in\nreal time, with people tweeting, posting, and blogging on the ground in Tahrir\nSquare.\nStill, there is no question that the exchange of technology from core nations to\nperipheral and semi-peripheral ones leads to a number of complex issues. For\ninstance, someone using a conflict theorist approach might focus on how much\npolitical ideology and cultural colonialism occurs with technological growth. In\ntheory at least, technological innovations are ideology-free; a fiber optic cable is\nthe same in a Muslim country as a secular one, a communist country or a\ncapitalist one. But those who bring technology to less-developed nations\u2014\nwhether they are nongovernment organizations, businesses, or governments\u2014\nusually have an agenda. A functionalist, in contrast, might focus on the ways\ntechnology creates new means to share information about successful crop-\ngrowing programs, or on the economic benefits of opening a new market for cell\nphone use. Either way, cultural and societal assumptions and norms are being\ndelivered along with those high-speed wires.\nCultural and ideological bias are not the only risks of media globalization. In\naddition to the risk of cultural imperialism and the loss of local culture, other\nproblems come with the benefits of a more interconnected globe. One risk is the\npotential for censoring by national governments that let in only the information\nand media they feel serve their message, as is occurring in China. In addition, core\nnations such as the United States risk the use of international media by criminals\nto circumvent local laws against socially deviant and dangerous behaviors such as\ngambling, child pornography, and the sex trade. Offshore or international web\nsites allow U.S. citizens (and others) to seek out whatever illegal or illicit information they want, from twenty-four hour online gambling sites that do not\nrequire proof of age, to sites that sell child pornography. These examples\nillustrate the societal risks of unfettered information flow.\nCHINA AND THE INTERNET: AN UNCOMFORTABLE FRIENDSHIP\nWhat information is accessible to these patrons of an internet caf\u00e9 in China?\nWhat is censored from their view? (Photo Courtesy of Kai Hendry/flickr)\nIn the United States, the Internet is used to access illegal gambling and\npornography sites, as well as to research stocks, crowd-source what car to buy, or\nkeep in touch with childhood friends. Can we allow one or more of those\nactivities, while restricting the rest? And who decides what needs restricting? In a\ncountry with democratic principles and an underlying belief in free-market\ncapitalism, the answer is decided in the court system. But globally, the questions\u2013\n\u2013and the government\u2019s responses\u2013\u2013are very different.\nChina is in many ways the global poster child for the uncomfortable relationship\nbetween Internet freedom and government control. China, which is a country\nwith a tight rein on the dissemination of information, has long worked to suppress\nwhat it calls \u201charmful information,\u201d including dissent concerning government\npolitics, dialogue about China\u2019s role in Tibet, or criticism of the government\u2019s\nhandling of events.\nWith sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube blocked in China, the nation\u2019s\nInternet users\u2013\u2013some 500 million strong in 2011\u2013\u2013turn to local media companies for their needs. Renren.com is China\u2019s answer to Facebook. Perhaps more\nimportantly from a social-change perspective, Sina Weibo is China\u2019s version of\nTwitter. Microblogging, or Weibo, acts like Twitter in that users can post short\nmessages that can be read by their subscribers. And because these services move\nso quickly and with such wide scope, it is difficult for government overseers to\nkeep up. This tool was used to criticize government response to a deadly rail crash\nand to protest a chemical plant. It was also credited with the government\u2019s\ndecision to report more accurately on the air pollution in Beijing, which occurred\nafter a high-profile campaign by a well-known property developer (Pierson 2012).\nThere is no question of China\u2019s authoritarian government ruling over this new\nform of Internet communication. The nation blocks the use of certain terms, such\nas human rights, and passes new laws that require people to register with their\nreal names and make it more dangerous to criticize government actions. Indeed,\nfifty-six-year-old microblogger Wang Lihong was recently sentenced to nine\nmonths in prison for \u201cstirring up trouble,\u201d as her government described her work\nhelping people with government grievances (Bristow 2011). But the government\ncannot shut down this flow of information completely. Foreign companies,\nseeking to engage with the increasingly important Chinese consumer market,\nhave their own accounts: the NBA has more than 5 million followers, and Tom\nCruise\u2019s Weibo account boasts almost 3 million followers (Zhang 2011). The\ngovernment, too, uses Weibo to get its own message across. As the millennium\nprogresses, China\u2019s approach to social media and the freedoms it offers will be\nwatched anxiously\u2013\u2013on Sina Weibo and beyond\u2013\u2013by the rest of the world.\nTechnological Globalization\nTechnological globalization is speeded in large part by technological diffusion, the\nspread of technology across borders. In the last two decades, there has been\nrapid improvement in the spread of technology to peripheral and semi-peripheral\nnations, and a 2008 World Bank report discusses both the benefits and ongoing\nchallenges of this diffusion. In general, the report found that technological\nprogress and economic growth rates were linked, and that the rise in\ntechnological progress has helped improve the situations of many living in\nabsolute poverty (World Bank 2008). The report recognizes that rural and low-\ntech products such as corn can benefit from new technological innovations, and\nthat, conversely, technologies like mobile banking can aid those whose rural\nexistence consists of low-tech market vending. In addition, technological advances in areas like mobile phones can lead to competition, lowered prices, and\nconcurrent improvements in related areas such as mobile banking and\ninformation sharing.\nHowever, the same patterns of social inequality that create a digital divide in the\nUnited States also create digital divides within peripheral and semi-peripheral\nnations. While the growth of technology use among countries has increased\ndramatically over the past several decades, the spread of technology within\ncountries is significantly slower among peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. In\nthese countries, far fewer people have the training and skills to take advantage of\nnew technology, let alone access it. Technological access tends to be clustered\naround urban areas and leaves out vast swaths of peripheral-nation citizens.\nWhile the diffusion of information technologies has the potential to resolve many\nglobal social problems, it is often the population most in need that is most\naffected by the digital divide. For example, technology to purify water could save\nmany lives, but the villages in peripheral nations most in need of water\npurification don\u2019t have access to the technology, the funds to purchase it, or the\ntechnological comfort level to introduce it as a solution.\nTHE MIGHTY CELL PHONE: HOW MOBILE PHONES ARE IMPACTING SUB-\nSAHARAN AFRICA\nMany of Africa\u2019s poorest countries suffer from a marked lack of infrastructure\nincluding poor roads, limited electricity, and minimal access to education and\ntelephones. But while landline use has not changed appreciably during the past\nten years, there\u2019s been a fivefold increase in mobile phone access; more than a\nthird of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have the ability to access a mobile phone\n(Katine 2010). Even more can use a \u201cvillage phone\u201d\u2014through a shared-phone\nprogram created by the Grameen Foundation. With access to mobile phone\ntechnology, a host of benefits become available that have the potential to change\nthe dynamics in these poorest nations. Sometimes that change is as simple as\nbeing able to make a phone call to neighboring market towns. By finding out\nwhich markets have vendors interested in their goods, fishers and farmers can\nensure they travel to the market that will serve them best and avoid a wasted\ntrip. Others can use mobile phones and some of the emerging money-sending\nsystems to securely send money to a family member or business partner\nelsewhere (Katine 2010). These shared-phone programs are often funded by businesses like Germany\u2019s\nVodafone or Britain\u2019s Masbabi, which hope to gain market share in the region.\nPhone giant Nokia points out that there are 4 billion mobile phone users\nworldwide\u2014that\u2019s more than twice as many people as have bank accounts\u2014\nmeaning there is ripe opportunity to connect banking companies with people who\nneed their services (ITU Telecom 2009). Not all access is corporate-based,\nhowever. Other programs are funded by business organizations that seek to help\nperipheral nations with tools for innovation and entrepreneurship.\nBut this wave of innovation and potential business comes with costs. There is,\ncertainly, the risk of cultural imperialism, and the assumption that core nations\n(and core-nation multinationals) know what is best for those struggling in the\nworld\u2019s poorest communities. Whether well intentioned or not, the vision of a\ncontinent of Africans successfully chatting on their iPhone may not be ideal. Like\nall aspects of global inequity, access to technology in Africa requires more than\njust foreign investment. There must be a concerted effort to ensure the benefits\nof technology get to where they are needed most.\nSummary\nTechnology drives globalization, but what that means can be hard to decipher.\nWhile some economists see technological advances leading to a more level\nplaying field where anyone anywhere can be a global contender, the reality is that\nopportunity still clusters in geographically advantaged areas. Still, technological\ndiffusion has led to the spread of more and more technology across borders into\nperipheral and semi-peripheral nations. However, true technological global\nequality is a long way off.\nGlossary\nmedia consolidation\na process by which fewer and fewer owners control the majority of media\noutlets\nmedia globalization\nthe worldwide integration of media through the cross-cultural exchange of\nideas oligopoly\na situation in which a few firms dominate a marketplace\ntechnological diffusion\nthe spread of technology across borders\ntechnological globalization\nthe cross-cultural development and exchange of technology\nFurther Research\nCheck out more on the global digital divide\nhere: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Global_Digital_Divide\nReferences\nAcker, Jenny C., and Isaac M.

Technology runs the gamut from the match you strike to light a candle all\nthe way up to sophisticated nuclear power plants that might power the factory\nwhere that candle was made. Media could refer to the television you watch, the\nads wrapping the bus you take to work or school, or the magazines you flip\nthrough in a dentist's waiting room, not to mention all the forms of new media,\nincluding Instagram, Facebook, blogs, YouTube, and the like. Are media and\ntechnology critical to the forward march of humanity? Are they pernicious\ncapitalist tools that lead to the exploitation of workers worldwide? Are they the\nmagic bullet the world has been waiting for to level the playing field and raise the\nworld\u2019s poor out of extreme poverty? Choose any opinion and you will find\nstudies and scholars who agree with you\u2013\u2013and those who disagree.\nFunctionalism\nBecause functionalism focuses on how media and technology contribute to the\nsmooth functioning of society, a good place to begin understanding this\nperspective is to write a list of functions you perceive media and technology to\nperform. Your list might include the ability to find information on the Internet, television\u2019s entertainment value, or how advertising and product placement\ncontribute to social norms.\nCommercial Function\nTV commercials can carry significant cultural currency. For some, the ads during\nthe Super Bowl are more water cooler-worthy than the game itself. (Photo\ncourtesy of Dennis Yang/flickr)\nAs you might guess, with nearly every U.S. household possessing a television, and\nthe 250 billion hours of television watched annually by people in the United\nStates, companies that wish to connect with consumers find television an\nirresistible platform to promote their goods and services (Nielsen 2012).\nTelevision advertising is a highly functional way to meet a market demographic\nwhere it lives. Sponsors can use the sophisticated data gathered by network and\ncable television companies regarding their viewers and target their advertising\naccordingly. Whether you are watching cartoons on Nick Jr. or a cooking show on\nTelemundo, chances are advertisers have a plan to reach you.\nAnd it certainly doesn\u2019t stop with television. Commercial advertising precedes\nmovies in theaters and shows up on and inside public transportation, as well as on the sides of building and roadways. Major corporations such as Coca-Cola bring\ntheir advertising into public schools, by sponsoring sports fields or tournaments,\nas well as filling the halls and cafeterias of those schools with vending machines\nhawking their goods. With rising concerns about childhood obesity and attendant\ndiseases, the era of soda machines in schools may be numbered. In fact, as part of\nthe United States Department of Agriculture's Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act and\nMichelle Obama's Let's Move! Initiative, a ban on junk food in school began in July\n2014.\nEntertainment Function\nAn obvious manifest function of media is its entertainment value. Most people,\nwhen asked why they watch television or go to the movies, would answer that\nthey enjoy it. And the numbers certainly illustrate that. While 2012 Nielsen\nresearch shows a slight reduction of U.S. homes with televisions, the reach of\ntelevision is still vast. And the amount of time spent watching is equally large.\nClearly, enjoyment is paramount. On the technology side, as well, there is a clear\nentertainment factor to the use of new innovations. From online gaming to\nchatting with friends on Facebook, technology offers new and more exciting ways\nfor people to entertain themselves.\nSocial Norm Functions\nEven while the media is selling us goods and entertaining us, it also serves to\nsocialize us, helping us pass along norms, values, and beliefs to the next\ngeneration. In fact, we are socialized and resocialized by media throughout our\nwhole lives. All forms of media teach us what is good and desirable, how we\nshould speak, how we should behave, and how we should react to events. Media\nalso provide us with cultural touchstones during events of national significance.\nHow many of your older relatives can recall watching the explosion of the space\nshuttle Challenger on television? How many of those reading this textbook\nfollowed the events of September 11 or Hurricane Katrina on television or the\nInternet?\nJust as in Anderson and Bushman's (2011) evidence in the Violence in Media and\nVideo Games: Does It Matter? feature, debate still exists over the extent and\nimpact of media socialization. One recent study (Krahe et al. 2011) demonstrated\nthat violent media content does have a desensitizing affect and is correlated with aggressive thoughts. Another group of scholars (Gentile, Mathieson, and Crick\n2011) found that among children exposure to media violence led to an increase in\nboth physical and relational aggression. Yet, a meta-analysis study covering four\ndecades of research (Savage 2003) could not establish a definitive link between\nviewing violence and committing criminal violence.\nIt is clear from watching people emulate the styles of dress and talk that appear in\nmedia that media has a socializing influence. What is not clear, despite nearly fifty\nyears of empirical research, is how much socializing influence the media has when\ncompared to other agents of socialization, which include any social institution\nthat passes along norms, values, and beliefs (such as peers, family, religious\ninstitutions, and the like).\nLife-Changing Functions\nLike media, many forms of technology do indeed entertain us, provide a venue for\ncommercialization, and socialize us. For example, some studies suggest the rising\nobesity rate is correlated with the decrease in physical activity caused by an\nincrease in use of some forms of technology, a latent function of the prevalence\nof media in society (Kautiainen et al. 2011). Without a doubt, a manifest function\nof technology is to change our lives, sometimes for the better and sometimes for\nthe worse. Think of how the digital age has improved the ways we communicate.\nHave you ever used Skype or another webcast to talk to a friend or family\nmember far away? Or maybe you have organized a fund drive, raising thousands\nof dollars, all from your desk chair.\nOf course, the downside to this ongoing information flow is the near impossibility\nof disconnecting from technology that leads to an expectation of constant\nconvenient access to information and people. Such a fast-paced dynamic is not\nalways to our benefit. Some sociologists assert that this level of media exposure\nleads to narcotizing dysfunction, a result in which people are too overwhelmed\nwith media input to really care about the issue, so their involvement becomes\ndefined by awareness instead of by action (Lazerfeld and Merton 1948).\nConflict Perspective\nIn contrast to theories in the functional perspective, the conflict perspective\nfocuses on the creation and reproduction of inequality\u2014social processes that tend to disrupt society rather than contribute to its smooth operation. When we\ntake a conflict perspective, one major focus is the differential access to media and\ntechnology embodied in the digital divide. Conflict theorists also look at who\ncontrols the media, and how media promotes the norms of upper-middle-class\nwhite people in the United States while minimizing the presence of the working\nclass, especially people of color.\nControl of Media and Technology\nPowerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over\nwhich forms of technology are released, when and where they are released, and\nwhat kind of media is available for our consumption, which is a form of\ngatekeeping. Shoemaker and Vos (2009) define gatekeeping as the sorting\nprocess by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media-\nappropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount. In other words, the\npeople in charge of the media decide what the public is exposed to, which, as C.\nWright Mills (1956) famously noted, is the heart of media\u2019s power. Take a\nmoment to think of the way \u201cnew media\u201d evolve and replace traditional forms of\nhegemonic media. With hegemonic media, a culturally diverse society can be\ndominated by one race, gender, or class that manipulates the media to impose its\nworldview as a societal norm. New media weakens the gatekeeper role in\ninformation distribution. Popular sites such as YouTube and Facebook not only\nallow more people to freely share information but also engage in a form of self-\npolicing. Users are encouraged to report inappropriate behavior that moderators\nwill then address.\nIn addition, some conflict theorists suggest that the way U.S. media are generated\nresults in an unbalanced political arena. Those with the most money can buy the\nmost media exposure, run smear campaigns against their competitors, and\nmaximize their visual presence. Almost a year before the 2012 U.S. presidential\nelection, the candidates\u2013\u2013Barack Obama for the Democrats and numerous\nRepublican contenders\u2013\u2013had raised more than $186 million (Carmi et al. 2012).\nSome would say that the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Committee is a major\ncontributing factor to our unbalanced political arena. In Citizens United, the\nSupreme Court affirmed the right of outside groups, including Super Political\nAction Committees (SuperPACs) with undisclosed donor lists, to spend unlimited\namounts of money on political ads as long as they don't coordinate with the\ncandidate's campaign or specifically advocate for a candidate. What do you think a conflict perspective theorist would suggest about the potential for the non-rich\nto be heard in politics, especially when SuperPACs ensure that the richest groups\nhave the most say?\nTechnological Social Control and Digital Surveillance\nSocial scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is\nan entire journal devoted to its study, Surveillance and Society. The panoptic\nsurveillance envisioned by Jeremy Bentham, depicted in the form of an all-\npowerful, all-seeing government by George Orwell in 1984, and later analyzed by\nMichel Foucault (1975) is increasingly realized in the form of technology used to\nmonitor our every move. This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant\nmonitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is\nnever communicated with directly. Today, digital security cameras capture our\nmovements, observers can track us through our cell phones, and police forces\naround the world use facial-recognition software.\nFeminist Perspective\nWhat types of women are we exposed to in the media? Some would argue that\nthe range of female images is misleadingly narrow. (Photo courtesy of\nCliff1066/flickr) Take a look at popular television shows, advertising campaigns, and online game\nsites. In most, women are portrayed in a particular set of parameters and tend to\nhave a uniform look that society recognizes as attractive. Most are thin, white or\nlight-skinned, beautiful, and young. Why does this matter? Feminist perspective\ntheorists believe this idealized image is crucial in creating and reinforcing\nstereotypes. For example, Fox and Bailenson (2009) found that online female\navatars conforming to gender stereotypes enhance negative attitudes toward\nwomen, and Brasted (2010) found that media (advertising in particular) promotes\ngender stereotypes. As early as 1990, Ms. magazine instituted a policy to publish\nwithout any commercial advertising.\nThe gender gap in tech-related fields (science, technology, engineering, and math)\nis no secret. A 2011 U.S. Department of Commerce Report suggested that gender\nstereotyping is one reason for this gap which acknowledges the bias toward men\nas keepers of technological knowledge (US Department of Commerce 2011). But\ngender stereotypes go far beyond the use of technology. Press coverage in the\nmedia reinforces stereotypes that subordinate women; it gives airtime to looks\nover skills, and coverage disparages women who defy accepted norms.\nRecent research in new media has offered a mixed picture of its potential to\nequalize the status of men and women in the arenas of technology and public\ndiscourse. A European agency, the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities\nfor Men and Women (2010), issued an opinion report suggesting that while there\nis the potential for new media forms to perpetuate gender stereotypes and the\ngender gap in technology and media access, at the same time new media could\noffer alternative forums for feminist groups and the exchange of feminist ideas.\nStill, the committee warned against the relatively unregulated environment of\nnew media and the potential for antifeminist activities, from pornography to\nhuman trafficking, to flourish there.\nIncreasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism\nis cyberfeminism, the application to, and promotion of, feminism online.\nResearch on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the liberating use of blogs by\nwomen living in Iraq during the second Gulf War (Peirce 2011) to an investigation\nof the Suicide Girls web site (Magnet 2007).\nSymbolic Interactionism Technology itself may act as a symbol for many. The kind of computer you own,\nthe kind of car you drive, your ability to afford the latest Apple product\u2014these\nserve as a social indicator of wealth and status. Neo-Luddites are people who see\ntechnology as symbolizing the coldness and alienation of modern life. But\nfor technophiles, technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter future. For\nthose adopting an ideological middle ground, technology might symbolize status\n(in the form of a massive flat-screen television) or failure (ownership of a basic old\nmobile phone with no bells or whistles).\nSocial Construction of Reality\nMeanwhile, media create and spread symbols that become the basis for our\nshared understanding of society. Theorists working in the interactionist\nperspective focus on this social construction of reality, an ongoing process in\nwhich people subjectively create and understand reality. Media constructs our\nreality in a number of ways. For some, the people they watch on a screen can\nbecome a primary group, meaning the small informal groups of people who are\nclosest to them. For many others, media becomes a reference group: a group that\ninfluences an individual and to which an individual compares himself or herself,\nand by which we judge our successes and failures. We might do very well without\nthe latest smartphone, until we see characters using it on our favorite television\nshow or our classmates whipping it out between classes.\nWhile media may indeed be the medium to spread the message of rich white\nmales, Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, and Sasson (1992) point out that some forms of\nmedia discourse allow competing constructions of reality to appear. For example,\nadvertisers find new and creative ways to sell us products we don\u2019t need and\nprobably wouldn\u2019t want without their prompting, but some networking sites such\nas Freecycle offer a commercial-free way of requesting and trading items that\nwould otherwise be discarded. The web is also full of blogs chronicling lives lived\n\u201coff the grid,\u201d or without participation in the commercial economy.\nSocial Networking and Social Construction\nWhile Tumblr and Facebook encourage us to check in and provide details of our\nday through online social networks, corporations can just as easily promote their\nproducts on these sites. Even supposedly crowd-sourced sites like Yelp (which\naggregates local reviews) are not immune to corporate shenanigans. That is, we think we are reading objective observations when in reality we may be buying\ninto one more form of advertising.\nFacebook, which started as a free social network for college students, is\nincreasingly a monetized business, selling you goods and services in subtle ways.\nBut chances are you don\u2019t think of Facebook as one big online advertisement.\nWhat started out as a symbol of coolness and insider status, unavailable to\nparents and corporate shills, now promotes consumerism in the form of games\nand fandom. For example, think of all the money spent to upgrade popular\nFacebook games like Candy Crush. And notice that whenever you become a \u201cfan,\u201d\nyou likely receive product updates and special deals that promote online and real-\nworld consumerism. It is unlikely that millions of people want to be \u201cfriends\u201d with\nPampers. But if it means a weekly coupon, they will, in essence, rent out space on\ntheir Facebook pages for Pampers to appear. Thus, we develop both new ways to\nspend money and brand loyalties that will last even after Facebook is considered\noutdated and obsolete.\nSummary\nThere are myriad theories about how society, technology, and media will\nprogress. Functionalism sees the contribution that technology and media provide\nto the stability of society, from facilitating leisure time to increasing productivity.\nConflict theorists are more concerned with how technology reinforces inequalities\namong communities, both within and among countries. They also look at how\nmedia typically give voice to the most powerful, and how new media might offer\ntools to help those who are disenfranchised. Symbolic interactionists see the\nsymbolic uses of technology as signs of everything from a sterile futuristic world\nto a successful professional life.\nGlossary\ncyberfeminism\nthe application to and promotion of feminism online\ngatekeeping\nthe sorting process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped\ninto a mass media-appropriate form and reduced to a manageable amount neo-Luddites\nthose who see technology as a symbol of the coldness of modern life\npanoptic surveillance\na form of constant monitoring in which the observation posts are\ndecentralized and the observed is never communicated with directly\ntechnophiles\nthose who see technology as symbolizing the potential for a brighter future\nFurther Research\nTo learn more about cyberfeminism, check out the interdisciplinary artist\ncollective, subRosa: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cyberfeminism\nTo explore the implications of panoptic surveillance, review some surveillance\nstudies at the free, open source Surveillance and Society\nsite: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Surveillance\nRead an example of socialist media from Jacobin magazine\nhere: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2EJacobin\nReferences\nBrasted, Monica. 2010. \u201cCare Bears vs. Transformers: Gender Stereotypes in Advertisements.\u201d Retrieved January\n10, 2012 (http://www.sociology.org/media-studies/care-bears-vs-transformers-gender-stereotypes-in-\nadvertisements).\nCarmi, Evan, Matthew Ericson, David Nolen, Kevin Quealy, Michael Strickland, Jeremy White, and Derek Willis.\n2012. \u201cThe 2012 Money Race: Compare the Candidates.\u201d New York Times.

A comprehensive review of these studies found\nthat violent games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, and aggressive\nbehaviors and decrease empathic feelings and prosocial behaviors. [Image: Sergey\nGalyonkin, https://goo.gl/8fqUx3, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/jSSrcO]\nThere are plenty of aggressive cues in the mass media, such as in TV programs,\nfilms, and video games. In the U.S., the Surgeon General warns the public about\nthreats to their physical and mental health. Most Americans know that the U.S.\nSurgeon General issued a warning about cigarettes in 1964: \u201cWarning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your\nHealth.\u201d However, most Americans do not know that the U.S. Surgeon General\nissued a warning regarding violent TV programs in 1972: \u201cIt is clear to me that the\ncausal relationship between televised violence and antisocial behavior is sufficient\nto warrant appropriate and immediate remedial action. . . . There comes a time\nwhen the data are sufficient to justify action. That time has come\u201d (Steinfeld,\n1972). Since then, hundreds of additional studies have shown that all forms of\nviolent media can increase aggression (e.g., Anderson & Bushman, 2002). Violent\nvideo games might even be more harmful than violent TV programs, for at least\nthree reasons.\nFirst, playing a video game is active, whereas watching a TV program is passive.\nActive involvement enhances learning. One study found that boys who played a\nviolent video game were more aggressive afterward than were boys who merely\nwatched the same game (Polman, Orobio de Castro, & van Aken, 2008).\nSecond, video game players are more likely to identify with a violent character\nthan TV watchers. If the game involves a first-person shooter, players have the\nsame visual perspective as the killer. If the game is third person, the player\ncontrols the character\u2019s actions from a more distant visual perspective. In either\ncase, the player is linked to a violent character. Research has shown that people\nare more aggressive when they identify with a violent character (e.g., Konijn, Nije\nBijvank, & Bushman, 2007).\nThird, violent games directly reward players for violent behavior by awarding\npoints or by allowing them to advance in the game. In some games, players are\nalso rewarded through verbal praise, such as hearing \u201cImpressive!\u201d after killing an\nenemy. In TV programs, reward is not directly tied to the viewer\u2019s behavior. It is\nwell known that rewarding behavior increases its frequency. One study found that\nplayers were more aggressive after playing a violent game that rewarded violent\nactions than after playing the same game that punished violent actions (Carnagey\n& Anderson, 2005).\nThe evidence linking violent video games to aggression is compelling. A\ncomprehensive review found that violent games increase aggressive thoughts,\nangry feelings, and aggressive behaviors and decrease empathic feelings and\nprosocial behaviors (Anderson et al., 2010). Similar effects were obtained for males and females, regardless of their age, and regardless of what country they\nwere from.\nBushman, B. J. (2018). Aggression and violence. In R. Biswas-Diener & E.
