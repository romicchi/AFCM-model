{"text":"Chapter 1\nEARLY RECOLLECTIONS\n5 Extraction \u2013 \u2018H. B.\u2019 \u2013 Four Remarkable Brothers \u2013 My Mother\u2019s Family Tree\n\u2013 An Unrecognized Genius \u2013 My First Knockout \u2013 Thackeray \u2013 The Fenians\n\u2013 Early Reading \u2013 My First Story.\nI was born on May 22, 1859, at Picardy Place, Edinburgh, so named\n10 because in old days a colony of French Huguenots had settled there. At\nthe time of their coming it was a village outside the City walls, but now\nit is at the end of Queen Street, abutting upon Leith Walk. When last I\nvisited it, it seemed to have degenerated, but at that time the flats were of\ngood repute.\n15 My father was the youngest son of John Doyle, who under the nom\nde crayon of \u2018H. B.\u2019 made a great reputation in London from about 1825\nto 1850. He came from Dublin about the year 1815 and may be said to\nbe the father of polite caricature, for in the old days satire took the brutal\nshape of making the object grotesque in features and figure. Gillray and\n20 Rowlandson had no other idea. My grandfather was a gentleman, draw-\ning gentlemen for gentlemen, and the satire lay in the wit of the picture\nand not in the mis-drawing of faces. This was a new idea, but it has been\nfollowed by most caricaturists since and so has become familiar. There\nwere no comic papers in those days, and the weekly cartoon of \u2018H. B.\u2019 was\n25 lithographed and distributed. He exerted, I am told, quite an influence\nupon politics, and was on terms of intimacy with many of the leading\nmen of his day. I can remember him in his old age, a very handsome and\ndignified man with features of the strong Anglo-Irish, Duke of Welling-\nton stamp. He died in 1868.\n30 My grandfather was left a widower with a numerous family, of which\nfour boys and one girl survived. Each of the boys made a name for him-\nself, for all inherited the artistic powers of their father. The elder, James\nDoyle, wrote The Chronicles of England, illustrated with coloured pictures\nby himself \u2013 examples of colour-printing which beat any subsequent\n35 work that I have ever seen. He also spent thirteen years in doing The Of-\nficial Baronage of England, a wonderful monument of industry and learn-\ning. Another brother was Henry Doyle, a great judge of old paintings,\nand in later years the manager of the National Gallery in Dublin, where\n2 chapter 1\nhe earned his C.B. The third son was Richard Doyle, whose whimsical\nhumour made him famous in Punch, the cover of which with its dancing\nelves is still so familiar an object. Finally came Charles Doyle, my father.\nThe Doyle family seem to have been fairly well-to-do, thanks to my\ngrandfather\u2019s talents. They lived in London in Cambridge Terrace. A 5\nsketch of their family life is given in Dicky Doyle\u2019s Diary. They lived up\nto their income, however, and it became necessary to find places for the\nboys. When my father was only nineteen a seat was offered him in the\nGovernment Office of Works in Edinburgh, whither he went. There he\nspent his working life, and thus it came about that I, an Irishman by ex- 10\ntraction, was born in the Scottish capital.\nThe Doyles, Anglo-Norman in origin, were strong Roman Catho-\nlics. The original Doyle, or D\u2019Oil, was a cadet-branch of the Staffordshire\nDoyles, which has produced Sir Francis Hastings Doyle and many other\ndistinguished men. This cadet shared in the invasion of Ireland and was 15\ngranted estates in County Wexford, where a great clan rose of depend-\nents, illegitimate children and others, all taking the feudal lord\u2019s name,\njust as the de Burghs founded the clan of Burke. We can only claim to be\nthe main stem by virtue of community of character and appearance with\nthe English Doyles and the unbroken use of the same crest and coat-of- 20\narms.\nMy forbears, like most old Irish families in the south, kept to the old\nfaith at the Reformation and fell victims to the penal laws in consequence.\nThese became so crushing upon landed gentry that my great-grandfather\nwas driven from his estate and became a silk-mercer in Dublin, where \u2018H. 25\nB.\u2019 was born. This family record was curiously confirmed by Monsignor\nBarry Doyle, destined, I think, for the highest honours of the Roman\nChurch, who traces back to the younger brother of my great-grandfather.\nI trust the reader will indulge me in my excursion into these family\nmatters, which are of vital interest to the family, but must be tedious to 30\nthe outsider. As I am on the subject, I wish to say a word upon my moth-\ner\u2019s family, the more so as she was great on arch\u00e6ology, and had, with\nthe help of Sir Arthur Vicars, Ulster King of Arms, and himself a relative,\nworked out her descent for more than five hundred years, and so com-\nposed a family tree which lies before me as I write and on which many of 35\nthe great ones of the earth have roosted.\nHer father was a young doctor of Trinity College, William Foley, who\ndied young and left his family in comparative poverty. He had married\n3 early recollections\none Katherine Pack, whose death-bed \u2013 or rather the white waxen thing\nwhich lay upon that bed \u2013 is the very earliest recollection of my life. Her\nnear relative \u2013 uncle, I think \u2013 was Sir Denis Pack, who led the Scottish\nbrigade at Waterloo. The Packs were a fighting family, as was but right as\n5 they were descended in a straight line from a major in Cromwell\u2019s army\nwho settled in Ireland. One of them, Anthony Pack, had part of his head\ncarried off at the same battle, so I fear it is part of our family tradition that\nwe lose our heads in action. His brain was covered over by a silver plate\nand he lived for many years, subject only to very bad fits of temper, which\n10 some of us have had with less excuse.\nBut the real romance of the family lies in the fact that about the middle\nof the seventeenth century the Reverend Richard Pack, who was head of\nKilkenny College, married Mary Percy, who was heir to the Irish branch\nof the Percys of Northumberland. By this alliance we all connect up (and\n15 I have every generation by name, as marked out by my dear mother) with\nthat illustrious line up to three separate marriages with the Plantagenets.\nOne has, therefore, some strange strains in one\u2019s blood which are noble\nin origin and, one can but hope, are noble in tendency.\nBut all this romance of ancestry did not interfere with the fact that\n20 when Katherine Pack, the Irish gentlewoman, came in her widowhood\nto Edinburgh, she was very poor. I have never been clear why it was\nEdinburgh for which she made. Having taken a flat she let it be known\nthat a paying-guest would be welcome. Just at this time, 1850 or therea-\nbouts, Charles Doyle was sent from London with a recommendation to\n25 the priests that they should guard his young morals and budding faith.\nHow could they do this better than by finding him quarters with a well-\nborn and orthodox widow? Thus it came about that two separate lines of\nIrish wanderers came together under one roof.\nI have a little bundle of my father\u2019s letters written in those days, full\n30 of appreciation of the kindness which he met with and full, also, of in-\nteresting observations on that Scottish society, rough, hard-drinking and\nkindly, into which he had been precipitated at a dangerously early age, es-\npecially for one with his artistic temperament. He had some fine religious\ninstincts, but his environment was a difficult one. In the household was a\n35 bright-eyed, very intelligent younger daughter, Mary, who presently went\noff to France and returned as a very cultivated young woman. The romance\nis easily understood, and so Charles Doyle in the year 1855 married Mary\nFoley, my mother, the young couple still residing with my grandmother.\n4 chapter 1\nTheir means were limited, for his salary as a Civil Servant was not\nmore than about \u00a3240. This he supplemented by his drawings. Thus mat-\nters remained for practically all his life, for he was quite unambitious and\nno great promotion ever came his way. His painting was done spasmodi-\ncally and the family did not always reap the benefit, for Edinburgh is full 5\nof water-colours which he had given away. It was one of my unfulfilled\nschemes to collect as many as possible and to have a Charles Doyle exhi-\nbition in London, and this has now been done. The critics were surprised\nto find what a great and original artist he was \u2013 far the greatest, in my\nopinion, of the family. Bernard Shaw, I remember, expressed the opinion 10\nthat the pictures should have a room to themselves in a national collec-\ntion. His brush was concerned not only with fairies and delicate themes\nof the kind, but with wild and fearsome subjects, so that his work had a\nvery peculiar style of its own, mitigated by great natural humour. He was\nmore terrible than Blake and less morbid than Wiertz. His originality is 15\nbest shown by the fact that one hardly knows with whom to compare\nhim. In prosaic Scotland, however, he excited wonder rather than admi-\nration, and he was only known in the larger world of London by pen and\nink book-illustrations which were not his best mode of expression. The\nprosaic outcome was that including all his earnings my mother could 20\nnever have averaged more than \u00a3300 a year on which to educate a large\nfamily. We lived in the hardy and bracing atmosphere of poverty and we\neach in turn did our best to help those who were younger than ourselves.\nMy noble sister Annette, who died just as the sunshine of better days\ncame into our lives, went out at a very early age as a governess to Portu- 25\ngal and sent all her salary home. My younger sisters, Lottie and Connie,\nboth did the same thing; and I helped as I could. But it was still my dear\nmother who bore the long, sordid strain. Often I said to her, \u2018When you\nare old, Mammie, you shall have a velvet dress and gold glasses and sit in\ncomfort by the fire.\u2019 Thank God, it so came to pass. My father, I fear, was 30\nof little help to her, for his thoughts were always in the clouds and he had\nno appreciation of the realities of life. The world, not the family, gets the\nfruits of genius.\nOf my boyhood I need say little, save that it was Spartan at home\nand more Spartan at the Edinburgh school where a tawse-brandishing 35\nschoolmaster of the old type made our young lives miserable. From the\nage of seven to nine I suffered under this pock-marked, one-eyed rascal\nwho might have stepped from the pages of Dickens. In the evenings,\n5 early recollections\nhome and books were my sole consolation, save for week-end holidays.\nMy comrades were rough boys and I became a rough boy, too. If there\nis any truth in the idea of reincarnation \u2013 a point on which my mind is\nstill open \u2013 I think some earlier experience of mine must have been as a\n5 stark fighter, for it came out strongly in youth, when I rejoiced in battle.\nWe lived for some time in a cul de sac street with a very vivid life of its\nown and a fierce feud between the small boys who dwelt on either side of\nit. Finally it was fought out between two champions, I representing the\npoorer boys who lived in flats and my opponent the richer boys who lived\n10 in the opposite villas. We fought in the garden of one of the said villas\nand had an excellent contest of many rounds, not being strong enough to\nweaken each other. When I got home after the battle, my mother cried,\n\u2018Oh, Arthur, what a dreadful eye you have got!\u2019 To which I replied, \u2018You\njust go across and look at Eddie Tulloch\u2019s eye!\u2019\n15 I met a well-deserved setback on one occasion when I stood forward\nto fight a bootmaker\u2019s boy, who had come into our preserve upon an er-\nrand. He had a green baize bag in his hand which contained a heavy boot,\nand this he swung against my skull with a force which knocked me pretty\nwell senseless. It was a useful lesson. I will say for myself, however, that\n20 though I was pugnacious I was never so to those weaker than myself and\nthat some of my escapades were in the defence of such. As I will show in\nmy chapter on Sport, I carried on my tastes into a later period of my life.\nOne or two little pictures stand out which may be worth recording.\nWhen my grandfather\u2019s grand London friends passed through Edin-\n25 burgh they used, to our occasional embarrassment, to call at the little flat\n\u2018to see how Charles is getting on.\u2019 In my earliest childhood such a one\ncame, tall, white-haired and affable. I was so young that it seems like a\nfaint dream, and yet it pleases me to think that I have sat on Thackeray\u2019s\nknee. He greatly admired my dear little mother with her grey Irish eyes\n30 and her vivacious Celtic ways \u2013 indeed, no one met her without being\ncaptivated by her.\nOnce, too, I got a glimpse of history. It was in 1866, if my dates are\nright, that some well-to-do Irish relatives asked us over for a few weeks,\nand we passed that time in a great house in King\u2019s County. I spent much\n35 of it with the horses and dogs, and became friendly with the young\ngroom. The stables opened on to a country road by an arched gate with a\nloft over it. One morning, being in the yard, I saw the young groom rush\ninto the yard with every sign of fear and hastily shut and bar the doors.\n6 Chapter 1\nHe then climbed into the loft, beckoning to me to come with him. From\nthe loft window we saw a gang of rough men, twenty or so, slouching\nalong the road. When they came opposite to the gate they stopped and\nlooking up shook their fists and cursed at us. The groom answered back\nmost volubly. Afterwards I understood that these men were a party of 5\nFenians, and that I had had a glimpse of one of the periodical troubles\nwhich poor old Ireland has endured. Perhaps now, at last, they may be\ndrawing to an end.\nDuring these first ten years I was a rapid reader, so rapid that some\nsmall library with which we dealt gave my mother notice that books 10\nwould not be changed more than twice a day. My tastes were boylike\nenough, for Mayne Reid was my favourite author, and his Scalp Hunters\nmy favourite book. I wrote a little book and illustrated it myself in early\ndays. There was a man in it and there was a tiger, who amalgamated short-\nly after they met. I remarked to my mother with precocious wisdom that 15\nit was easy to get people into scrapes, but not so easy to get them out\nagain, which is surely the experience of every writer of adventures.\n7 Chapter 2\nUNDER THE JESUITS\n5 The Preparatory School \u2013 The Mistakes of Education \u2013 Spartan Schooling\n\u2013 Corporal Punishment \u2013 Well-known School Fellows \u2013 Gloomy Forecasts\n\u2013 Poetry \u2013 London Matriculation \u2013 German School \u2013 A Happy Year \u2013 The\nJesuits \u2013 Strange Arrival in Paris.\n10 I was in my tenth year when I was sent to Hodder, which is the pre-\nparatory school for Stonyhurst, the big Roman Catholic public school\nin Lancashire. It was a long journey for a little boy who had never been\naway from home before, and I felt very lonesome and wept bitterly upon\nthe way, but in due time I arrived safely at Preston, which was then the\n15 nearest station, and with many other small boys and our black-robed Jes-\nuit guardians we drove some twelve miles to the school. Hodder is about\na mile from Stonyhurst, and as all the boys there are youngsters under\ntwelve, it forms a very useful institution, breaking a lad into school ways\nbefore he mixes with the big fellows.\n20 I had two years at Hodder. The year was not broken up by the fre-\nquent holidays which illuminate the present educational period. Save for\nsix weeks each summer, one never left the school. On the whole, those\nfirst two years were happy years. I could hold my own both in brain and\nin strength with my comrades. I was fortunate enough to get under the\n25 care of a kindly principal, one Father Cassidy, who was more human than\nJesuits usually are. I have always kept a warm remembrance of this man\nand of his gentle ways to the little boys \u2013 young rascals many of us \u2013 who\nwere committed to his care. I remember the Franco-German War break-\ning out at this period, and how it made a ripple even in our secluded\n30 backwater.\nFrom Hodder I passed on to Stonyhurst, that grand medi\u00e6val dwell-\ning-house which was left some hundred and fifty years ago to the Jes-\nuits, who brought over their whole teaching staff from some college in\nHolland in order to carry it on as a public school. The general curricu-\n35 lum, like the building, was medi\u00e6val but sound. I understand it has been\nmodernized since. There were seven classes \u2013 elements, figures, rudi-\nments, grammar, syntax, poetry and rhetoric \u2013 and you were allotted a\nyear for each, or seven in all \u2013 a course with which I faithfully complied,\n8 chapter 2\ntwo having already been completed at Hodder. It was the usual public\nschool routine of Euclid, algebra and the classics, taught in the usual way,\nwhich is calculated to leave a lasting abhorrence of these subjects. To give\nboys a little slab of Virgil or Homer with no general idea as to what it is all\nabout or what the classical age was like, is surely an absurd way of treating 5\nthe subject. I am sure that an intelligent boy could learn more by read-\ning a good translation of Homer for a week than by a year\u2019s study of the\noriginal as it is usually carried out. It was no worse at Stonyhurst than at\nany other school, and it can only be excused on the plea that any exercise,\nhowever stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental dumb-bell by which one 10\ncan improve one\u2019s mind. It is, I think, a thoroughly false theory. I can say\nwith truth that my Latin and Greek, which cost me so many weary hours,\nhave been little use to me in life, and that my mathematics have been no\nuse at all. On the other hand, some things which I picked up almost by\naccident, the art of reading aloud, learned when my mother was knitting, 15\nor the reading of French books, learned by spelling out the captions of\nthe Jules Verne illustrations, have been of the greatest possible service.\nMy classical education left me with a horror of the classics, and I was\nastonished to find how fascinating they were when I read them in a rea-\nsonable manner in later years. 20\nYear by year, then, I see myself climbing those seven weary steps and\npassing through as many stages of my boyhood. I do not know if the Jesu-\nit system of education is good or not; I would need to have tried another\nsystem as well before I could answer that. On the whole it was justified\nby results, for I think it turned out as decent a set of young fellows as 25\nany other school would do. In spite of a large infusion of foreigners and\nsome disaffected Irish, we were a patriotic crowd, and our little pulse beat\ntime with the heart of the nation. I am told that the average of V.C.\u2019 s and\nD.S.O.\u2019s now held by old Stonyhurst boys is very high as compared with\nother schools. The Jesuit teachers have no trust in human nature, and 30\nperhaps they are justified. We were never allowed for an instant to be\nalone with each other, and I think that the immorality which is rife in\npublic schools was at a minimum in consequence. In our games and our\nwalks the priests always took part, and a master perambulated the dormi-\ntories at night. Such a system may weaken self-respect and self-help, but 35\nit at least minimizes temptation and scandal.\nThe life was Spartan, and yet we had all that was needed. Dry bread\nand hot well-watered milk was our frugal breakfast. There was a \u2018joint\u2019\n9 under the jesuits\nand twice a week a pudding for dinner. Then there was an odd snack\ncalled \u2018bread and beer\u2019 in the afternoon, a bit of dry bread and the most\nextraordinary drink, which was brown but had no other characteristic of\nbeer. Finally, there was hot milk again, bread, butter, and often potatoes\n5 for supper. We were all very healthy on this r\u00e9gime, with fish, on Fridays.\nEverything in every way was plain to the verge of austerity, save that we\ndwelt in a beautiful building, dined in a marble-floored hall with min-\nstrels\u2019 gallery, prayed in a lovely church, and generally lived in very choice\nsurroundings so far as vision and not comfort was concerned.\n10 Corporal punishment was severe, and I can speak with feeling as I\nthink few, if any, boys of my time endured more of it. It was of a peculiar\nnature, imported also, I fancy, from Holland. The instrument was a piece\nof india-rubber of the size and shape of a thick boot sole. This was called\na \u2018Tolley\u2019 \u2013 why, no one has explained, unless it is a Latin pun on what we\n15 had to bear. One blow of this instrument, delivered with intent, would\ncause the palm of the hand to swell up and change colour. When I say\nthat the usual punishment of the larger boys was nine on each hand, and\nthat nine on one hand was the absolute minimum, it will be understood\nthat it was a severe ordeal, and that the sufferer could not, as a rule, turn\n20 the handle of the door to get out of the room in which he had suffered.\nTo take twice nine upon a cold day was about the extremity of human\nendurance. I think, however, that it was good for us in the end, for it was\na point of honour with many of us not to show that we were hurt, and\nthat is one of the best trainings for a hard life. If I was more beaten than\n25 others it was not that I was in any way vicious, but it was that I had a\nnature which responded eagerly to affectionate kindness (which I never\nreceived), but which rebelled against threats and took a perverted pride\nin showing that it would not be cowed by violence. I went out of my way\nto do really mischievous and outrageous things simply to show that my\n30 spirit was unbroken. An appeal to my better nature and not to my fears\nwould have found an answer at once. I deserved all I got for what I did,\nbut I did it because I was mishandled.\nI do not remember anyone who attained particular distinction\namong my school-fellows, save Bernard Partridge of Punch, whom I rec-\n35 ollect as a very quiet, gentle boy. Father Thurston, who was destined to\nbe one of my opponents in psychic matters so many years later, was in\nthe class above me. There was a young novice, too, with whom I hardly\ncame in contact, but whose handsome and spiritual appearance I well re-\n10 chapter 2\nmember. He was Bernard Vaughan, afterwards the famous preacher.\nSave for one school-fellow, James Ryan \u2013 a remarkable boy who grew\ninto a remarkable man \u2013 I carried away no lasting friendship from\nStonyhurst.\nIt was only in the latest stage of my Stonyhurst development that I re- 5\nalized that I had some literary streak in me which was not common to all.\nIt came to me as quite a surprise, and even more perhaps to my masters,\nwho had taken a rather hopeless view of my future prospects. One master,\nwhen I told him that I thought of being a civil engineer, remarked, \u2018Well,\nDoyle, you may be an engineer, but I don\u2019t think you will ever be a civil 10\none.\u2019 Another assured me that I would never do any good in the world,\nand perhaps from his point of view his prophecy has been justified. The\nparticular incident, however, which brought my latent powers to the\nsurface depended upon the fact that in the second highest class, which\nI reached in 1874, it was incumbent to write poetry (so called) on any 15\ntheme given. This was done as a dreary unnatural task by most boys. Very\ncomical their wooings of the muses used to be. For me, saturated as I\nreally was with affection for verse, it was a labour of love, and I produced\nverses which were poor enough in themselves but seemed miracles to\nthose who had no urge in that direction. The particular theme was the 20\ncrossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites and my effort from \u2013\n\u2018Like pallid daisies in a grassy wood,\nSo round the sward the tents of Israel stood\u2019;\n25\nthrough \u2013\n\u2018There was no time for thought and none for fear,\nFor Egypt\u2019s horse already pressed their rear\u2019;\n30\ndown to the climax \u2013\n\u2018One horrid cry! The tragedy was o\u2019er,\nAnd Pharaoh with his army seen no more,\u2019 \u2013\n35\nwas workmanlike though wooden and conventional. Anyhow, it marked\nwhat Mr. Stead used to call a sign-post, and I realized myself a little. In\nthe last year I edited the College magazine and wrote a good deal of indif-\n11 under the jesuits\nferent verse. I also went up for the Matriculation examination of London\nUniversity, a good all-round test which winds up the Stonyhurst curric-\nulum, and I surprised everyone by taking honours, so after all I emerged\nfrom Stonyhurst at the age of sixteen with more credit than seemed prob-\n5 able from my rather questionable record.\nEarly in my career there, an offer had been made to my mother that\nmy school fees would be remitted if I were dedicated to the Church. She\nrefused this, so both the Church and I had an escape. When I think, how-\never, of her small income and great struggle to keep up appearances and\n10 make both ends meet, it was a fine example of her independence of char-\nacter, for it meant paying out some \u00a350 a year which might have been\navoided by a word of assent.\nI had yet another year with the Jesuits, for it was determined that I\nwas still too young to begin any professional studies, and that I should go\n15 to Germany and learn German. I was despatched, therefore, to Feldkirch,\nwhich is a Jesuit school in the Vorarlberg province of Austria, to which\nmany better-class German boys are sent. Here the conditions were much\nmore humane and I met with far more human kindness than at Stony-\nhurst, with the immediate result that I ceased to be a resentful young\n20 rebel and became a pillar of law and order.\nI began badly, however, for on the first night of my arrival I was kept\nawake by a boy snoring loudly in the dormitory. I stood it as long as I\ncould, but at last I was driven to action. Curious wooden compasses\ncalled bett-scheere, or \u2018bed-scissors,\u2019 were stuck into each side of the nar-\n25 row beds. One of these I plucked out, walked down the dormitory, and,\nhaving spotted the offender, proceeded to poke him with my stick. He\nawoke and was considerably amazed to see in the dim light a large youth\nwhom he had never seen before \u2013 I arrived after hours \u2013 assaulting him\nwith a club. I was still engaged in stirring him up when I felt a touch on\n30 my shoulder and was confronted by the master, who ordered me back\nto bed. Next morning I got a lecture on free-and-easy English ways, and\ntaking the law into my own hands. But this start was really my worst lapse\nand I did well in the future.\nIt was a happy year on the whole. I made less progress with German\n35 than I should, for there were about twenty English and Irish boys who\nnaturally baulked the wishes of their parents by herding together. There\nwas no cricket, but there was toboganning and fair football, and a weird\ngame \u2013 football on stilts. Then there were the lovely mountains round us,\n12 chapter 2\nwith an occasional walk among them. The food was better than at Stony-\nhurst and we had the pleasant German light beer instead of the horrible\nswipes of Stonyhurst. One unlooked-for accomplishment I acquired, for\nthe boy who played the big brass bass instrument in the fine school band\nhad not returned, and, as a well-grown lad was needed, I was at once en- 5\nlisted in the service. I played in public \u2013 good music, too, Lohengrin, and\nTannh\u00e4user \u2013 within a week or two of my first lesson, but they pressed\nme on for the occasion and the Bombardon, as it was called, only comes\nin on a measured rhythm with an occasional run, which sounds like a\nhippopotamus doing a step dance. So big was the instrument that I re- 10\nmember the other bandsmen putting my sheets and blankets inside it\nand my surprise when I could not get out a note. It was in the summer of\n1876 that I left Feldkirch, and I have always had a pleasant memory of the\nAustrian Jesuits and of the old school.\nIndeed I have a kindly feeling towards all Jesuits, far as I have strayed 15\nfrom their paths. I see now both their limitations and their virtues. They\nhave been slandered in some things, for during eight years of constant\ncontact I cannot remember that they were less truthful than their fellows,\nor more casuistical than their neighbours. They were keen, clean-minded\nearnest men, so far as I knew them, with a few black sheep among them, 20\nbut not many, for the process of selection was careful and long. In all\nways, save in their theology, they were admirable, though this same the-\nology made them hard and inhuman upon the surface, which is indeed\nthe general effect of Catholicism in its more extreme forms. The convert\nis lost to the family. Their hard, narrow outlook gives the Jesuits driving 25\npower, as is noticeable in the Puritans and all hard, narrow creeds. They\nare devoted and fearless and have again and again, both in Canada, in\nSouth America and in China, been the vanguard of civilization to their\nown grievous hurt. They are the old guard of the Roman Church. But the\ntragedy is that they, who would gladly give their lives for the old faith, have 30\nin effect helped to ruin it, for it is they, according to Father Tyrrell and the\nmodernists, who have been at the back of all those extreme doctrines of\npapal infallibility and Immaculate Conception, with a general all-round\ntightening of dogma, which have made it so difficult for the man with\nscientific desire for truth or with intellectual self-respect to keep within 35\nthe Church. For some years St. George Mivart, the last of Catholic Sci-\nentists, tried to do the impossible, and then he also had to leave go his\nhold, so that there is not, so far as I know, one single man of outstanding\n13 under the jesuits\nfame in science or in general thought who is a practicing Catholic. This is\nthe work of the extremists and is deplored by many of the moderates and\nfiercely condemned by the modernists. It depends also upon the inner\nItalian directorate who give the orders. Nothing can exceed the uncom-\n5 promising bigotry of the Jesuit theology, or their apparent ignorance of\nhow it shocks the modern conscience. I remember that when, as a grown\nlad, I heard Father Murphy, a great fierce Irish priest, declare that there\nwas sure damnation for everyone outside the Church, I looked upon him\nwith horror, and to that moment I trace the first rift which has grown into\n10 such a chasm between me and those who were my guides.\nOn my way back to England I stopped at Paris. Through all my life up\nto this point there had been an unseen grand-uncle, named Michael Co-\nnan, to whom I must now devote a paragraph. He came into the family\nfrom the fact that my father\u2019s father (\u2018H. B.\u2019) had married a Miss Conan.\n15 Michael Conan, her brother, had been editor of The Art Journal and was\na man of distinction, an intellectual Irishman of the type which original-\nly founded the Sinn Fein movement. He was as keen on heraldry and\ngenealogy as my mother, and he traced his descent in some circuitous\nway from the Dukes of Brittany, who were all Conans; indeed Arthur\n20 Conan was the ill-fated young Duke whose eyes were put out, according\nto Shakespeare, by King John. This uncle was my godfather, and hence\nmy name Arthur Conan.\nHe lived in Paris and had expressed a wish that his grand-nephew and\ngodson, with whom he had corresponded, should call en passant. I ran\n25 my money affairs so closely, after a rather lively supper at Strasburg, that\nwhen I reached Paris I had just twopence in my pocket. As I could not\nwell drive up and ask my uncle to pay the cab I left my trunk at the station\nand set forth on foot. I reached the river, walked along it, came to the foot\nof the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, saw the Arc de Triomphe in the distance, and\n30 then, knowing that the Avenue Wagram, where my uncle lived, was near\nthere, I tramped it on a hot August day and finally found him. I remem-\nber that I was exhausted with the heat and the walking, and that when\nat the last gasp I saw a man buy a drink of what seemed to be porter by\nhanding a penny to a man who had a long tin on his back. I therefore halt-\n35 ed the man and spent one of my pennies on a duplicate drink. It proved\nto be liquorice and water, but it revived me when I badly needed it, and it\ncould not be said that I arrived penniless at my uncle\u2019s, for I actually had\na penny.\n14 chapter 2\nSo, for some penurious weeks, I was in Paris with this dear old vol-\ncanic Irishman, who spent the summer day in his shirt-sleeves, with a\nlittle dicky-bird of a wife waiting upon him. I am built rather on his lines\nof body and mind than on any of the Doyles. We made a true friendship,\nand then I returned to my home conscious that real life was about to 5\nbegin.\n15 Chapter 3\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A STUDENT\n5 Edinburgh University \u2013 A Sad Disappointment \u2013 Original of Professor\nChallenger \u2013 Of Sherlock Holmes \u2013 Deductions \u2013 Sheffield \u2013 Ruyton \u2013\nBirmingham \u2013 Literary Aspirations \u2013 First Accepted Story \u2013 My Father\u2019s\nDeath \u2013 Mental Position \u2013 Spiritual Yearnings \u2013 An Awkward Business.\n10 When i returned to Edinburgh, with little to show, either mental or\nspiritual, for my pleasant school year in Germany, I found that the fam-\nily affairs were still as straitened as ever. No promotion had come to my\nfather, and two younger children, Innes, my only brother, and Ida, had\narrived to add to the calls upon my mother. Another sister, Julia, followed\n15 shortly afterwards. But Annette, the eldest sister, had already gone out to\nPortugal as governess to earn and send home a fair salary, while Lottie\nand Connie were about to do the same. My mother had adopted the de-\nvice of sharing a large house, which may have eased her in some ways, but\nwas disastrous in others.\n20 Perhaps it was good for me that the times were hard, for I was wild,\nfull-blooded, and a trifle reckless, but the situation called for energy\nand application, so that one was bound to try to meet it. My mother\nhad been so splendid that we could not fail her. It had been determined\nthat I should be a doctor, chiefly, I think, because Edinburgh was so fa-\n25 mous a centre for medical learning. It meant another long effort for my\nmother, but she was very brave and ambitious where her children were\nconcerned, and I was not only to have a medical education, but to take\nthe University degree, which was a larger matter than a mere licence to\npractise. When I returned from Germany I found that there was a long\n30 list of bursaries and scholarships open for competition. I had a month\nin which to brush up my classics and then I went in for these, and was\ninformed a week later that I had won the Grierson bursary of \u00a340 for two\nyears. Great were the rejoicings and all shadows seemed to be lifting. But\non calling to get the money I was informed that there had been a clerical\n35 error, and that this particular bursary was only open to arts students. As\nthere was a long list of prizes I naturally supposed that I would get the\nnext highest, which was available for medicals. The official pulled a long\nface and said: \u2018Unfortunately the candidate to whom it was allotted has\n16 chapter 3\nalready drawn the money.\u2019 It was manifest robbery, and yet I, who had\nwon the prize and needed it so badly, never received it, and was eventual-\nly put off with a solatium of \u00a37, which had accumulated from some fund.\nIt was a bitter disappointment and, of course, I had a legal case, but what\ncan a penniless student do, and what sort of college career would he have 5\nif he began it by suing his University for money? I was advised to accept\nthe situation, and there seemed no prospect of accepting anything else.\nSo now behold me, a tall strongly-framed but half-formed young\nman, fairly entered upon my five years\u2019 course of medical study. It can\nbe done with diligence in four years, but there came, as I shall show, a 10\nglorious interruption which held me back for one year. I entered as a stu-\ndent in October 1876, and I emerged as a Bachelor of Medicine in Au-\ngust 1881. Between these two points lies one long weary grind at botany,\nchemistry, anatomy, physiology, and a whole list of compulsory subjects,\nmany of which have a very indirect bearing upon the art of curing. The 15\nwhole system of teaching, as I look back upon it, seems far too oblique\nand not nearly practical enough for the purpose in view. And yet Edin-\nburgh is, I believe, more practical than most other colleges. It is practical,\ntoo, in its preparation for life, since there is none of the atmosphere of\nan enlarged public school, as is the case in English Universities, but the 20\nstudent lives a free man in his own rooms with no restrictions of any sort.\nIt ruins some and makes strong men of many. In my own case, of course,\nthis did not apply, since my family lived in the town, and I worked from\nmy own home.\nThere was no attempt at friendship, or even acquaintance, between 25\nprofessors and students at Edinburgh. It was a strictly business arrange-\nment by which you paid, for example, four guineas for Anatomy lectures\nand received the winter course in exchange, never seeing your profes-\nsor save behind his desk and never under any circumstances exchanging\na word with him. They were remarkable men, however, some of these 30\nprofessors, and we managed to know them pretty well without any per-\nsonal acquaintance. There was kindly Crum Brown, the chemist, who\nsheltered himself carefully before exploding some mixture, which usu-\nally failed to ignite, so that the loud \u2018Boom!\u2019 uttered by the class was the\nonly resulting sound. Brown would emerge from his retreat with a \u2018Real- 35\nly, gentlemen!\u2019 of remonstrance, and go on without allusion to the abor-\ntive experiment. There was Wyville Thomson, the zoologist, fresh from\nhis Challenger expedition, and Balfour, with the face and manner of John\n17 recollections of a student\nKnox, a hard rugged old man, who harried the students in their exams,\nand was in consequence harried by them for the rest of the year. There\nwas Turner, a fine anatomist, but a self-educated man, as was betrayed\nwhen he used to \u2018take and put this structure on the handle of this scal-\n5 pel.\u2019 The most human trait that I can recall of Turner was that upon one\noccasion the sacred quadrangle was invaded by snowballing roughs. His\nclass, of whom I was one, heard the sounds of battle and fidgetted in their\nseats, on which the Professor said: \u2018I think, gentlemen, your presence\nmay be more useful outside than here,\u2019 on which we flocked out with a\n10 whoop, and soon had the quadrangle clear. Most vividly of all, however,\nthere stands out in my memory the squat figure of Professor Rutherford\nwith his Assyrian beard, his prodigious voice, his enormous chest and\nhis singular manner. He fascinated and awed us. I have endeavoured to\nreproduce some of his peculiarities in the fictitious character of Profes-\n15 sor Challenger. He would sometimes start his lecture before he reached\nthe classroom, so that we would hear a booming voice saying: \u2018There are\nvalves in the veins,\u2019 or some other information, when the desk was still\nempty. He was, I fear, a rather ruthless vivisector, and though I have al-\nways recognized that a minimum of painless vivisection is necessary, and\n20 far more justifiable than the eating of meat as a food, I am glad that the\nlaw was made more stringent so as to restrain such men as he. \u2018Ach, these\nJarman Frags!\u2019 he would exclaim in his curious accent, as he tore some\npoor amphibian to pieces. I wrote a students\u2019 song which is still sung,\nI understand, in which a curious article is picked up on the Portobello\n25 beach and each Professor in turn claims it for his department. Ruther-\nford\u2019s verse ran:\nSaid Rutherford with a smile,\n\u2018It\u2019s a mass of solid bile\n30 And I myself obtained it, what is more\nBy a stringent cholagogue\nFrom a vivisected dog,\nAnd I lost it on the Portobello Shore.\u2019\n35 If the song is indeed still sung it may be of interest to the present gen-\neration to know that I was the author.\nBut the most notable of the characters whom I met was one Joseph\nBell, surgeon at the Edinburgh Infirmary. Bell was a very remarkable man\n18 chapter 3\nin body and mind. He was thin, wiry, dark, with a high-nosed acute face,\npenetrating grey eyes, angular shoulders, and a jerky way of walking. His\nvoice was high and discordant. He was a very skilful surgeon, but his\nstrong point was diagnosis, not only of disease, but of occupation and\ncharacter. For some reason which I have never understood he singled 5\nme out from the drove of students who frequented his wards and made\nme his outpatient clerk, which meant that I had to array his outpatients,\nmake simple notes of their cases, and then show them in, one by one, to\nthe large room in which Bell sat in state surrounded by his dressers and\nstudents. Then I had ample chance of studying his methods and of notic- 10\ning that he often learned more of the patient by a few quick glances than\nI had done by my questions. Occasionally the results were very dramatic,\nthough there were times when he blundered. In one of his best cases he\nsaid to a civilian patient: \u2018Well, my man, you\u2019ve served in the army.\u2019\n\u2018Aye, sir.\u2019 15\n\u2018Not long discharged?\u2019\n\u2018No, sir.\u2019\n\u2018A Highland regiment?\u2019\n\u2018Aye, sir.\u2019\n\u2018A non-com. officer?\u2019 20\n\u2018Aye, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Stationed at Barbados?\u2019\n\u2018Aye, sir.\u2019\n\u2018You see, gentlemen,\u2019 he would explain, \u2018the man was a respectful\nman but did not remove his hat. They do not in the army, but he would 25\nhave learned civilian ways had he been long discharged. He has an air of\nauthority and he is obviously Scottish. As to Barbados, his complaint is\nelephantiasis, which is West Indian and not British.\u2019 To his audience of\nWatsons it all seemed very miraculous until it was explained, and then\nit became simple enough. It is no wonder that after the study of such a 30\ncharacter I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to\nbuild up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and\nnot through the folly of the criminal. Bell took a keen interest in these\ndetective tales and even made suggestions which were not, I am bound\nto say, very practical. I kept in touch with him for many years and he used 35\nto come upon my platform to support me when I contested Edinburgh\nin 1901.\nWhen I took over his out-patient work he warned me that a knowl-\n19 recollections of a student\nedge of Scottish idioms was necessary, and I, with the confidence of\nyouth, declared that I had got it. The sequel was amusing. On one of the\nfirst days an old man came who, in response to my question, declared that\nhe had a \u2018bealin\u2019 in his oxter.\u2019\n5 This fairly beat me, much to Bell\u2019s amusement. It seems that the words\nreally mean an abscess in the armpit.\nSpeaking generally of my University career I may say that though I\ntook my fences in my stride and balked at none of them, still I won no\ndistinction in the race. I was always one of the ruck, neither lingering nor\n10 gaining \u2013 a 60 per cent man at examinations. There were, however, some\nreasons for this which I will now state.\nIt was clearly very needful that I should help financially as quickly as\npossible, even if my help only took the humble form of providing for my\nown keep. Therefore I endeavoured almost from the first to compress the\n15 classes for a year into half a year, and so to have some months in which\nto earn a little money as a medical assistant, who would dispense and do\nodd jobs for a doctor. When I first set forth to do this my services were\nso obviously worth nothing that I had to put that valuation upon them.\nEven then it might have been a hard bargain for the doctor, for I might\n20 have proved like the youth in Pickwick who had a rooted idea that oxalic\nacid was Epsom salts. However, I had horse sense enough to save myself\nand my employer from any absolute catastrophe. My first venture, in the\nearly summer of \u201978, was with a Dr. Richardson, running a low-class prac-\ntice in the poorer quarters of Sheffield. I did my best, and I dare say he\n25 was patient, but at the end of three weeks we parted by mutual consent. I\nwent on to London, where I renewed my advertisements in the medical\npapers, and found a refuge for some weeks with my Doyle relatives, then\nliving at Clifton Gardens, Maida Vale. I fear that I was too Bohemian for\nthem and they too conventional for me. However, they were kind to me,\n30 and I roamed about London for some time with pockets so empty that\nthere was little chance of idleness breeding its usual mischief. I remem-\nber that there were signs of trouble in the East and that the recruiting\nsergeants, who were very busy in Trafalgar Square, took my measure in a\nmoment and were very insistent that I should take the shilling. There was\n35 a time when I was quite disposed to do so, but my mother\u2019s plans held me\nback. I may say that late in the same year I did volunteer as a dresser for\nthe English ambulances sent to Turkey for the Russian War, and was on\nthe Red Cross list, but the collapse of the Turks prevented my going out.\n20 chapter 3\nSoon, however, there came an answer to my advertisement: \u2018Third\nyear\u2019s student, desiring experience rather than remuneration, offers his\nservices, &c., &c.\u2019 It was from a Dr. Elliot living in a townlet in Shrop-\nshire which rejoiced in the extraordinary name of \u2018Ruyton-of-the-eleven-\ntowns.\u2019 It was not big enough to make one town, far less eleven. There for 5\nfour months I helped in a country practice. It was a very quiet existence\nand I had a good deal of time to myself under very pleasant circumstanc-\nes, so that I really trace some little mental progress to that period, for I\nread and thought without interruption. My medical duties were of a rou-\ntine nature save on a few occasions. One of them still stands out in my 10\nmemory, for it was the first time in my life that I ever had to test my own\nnerve in a great sudden emergency. The doctor was out when there came\na half-crazed messenger to say that in some rejoicings at a neighbouring\ngreat house they had exploded an old cannon which had promptly burst\nand grievously injured one of the bystanders. No doctor was available, 15\nso I was the last resource. On arriving there I found a man in bed with a\nlump of iron sticking out of the side of his head. I tried not to show the\nalarm which I felt, and I did the obvious thing by pulling out the iron. I\ncould see the clean white bone, so I could assure them that the brain had\nnot been injured. I then pulled the gash together, staunched the bleeding, 20\nand finally bound it up, so that when the doctor did at last arrive he had\nlittle to add. This incident gave me confidence and, what is more impor-\ntant still, gave others confidence. On the whole I had a happy time at\nRuyton, and have a pleasing memory of Dr. Elliot and his wife.\nAfter a winter\u2019s work at the University my next assistantship was a real 25\nmoney-making proposition to the extent of some two pounds a month.\nThis was with Dr. Hoare, a well-known Birmingham doctor, who had a\nfive-horse City practice, and every working doctor, before the days of\nmotors, would realize that this meant going from morning to night. He\nearned some three thousand a year, which takes some doing, when it is 30\ncollected from 3s. 6d. visits and 1s. 6d. bottles of medicine, among the\nvery poorest classes of Aston. Hoare was a fine fellow, stout, square, red-\nfaced, bushy-whiskered and dark-eyed. His wife was also a very kindly\nand gifted woman, and my position in the house was soon rather that of\na son than of an assistant. The work, however, was hard and incessant, 35\nand the pay very small. I had long lists of prescriptions to make up every\nday, for we dispensed our own medicine, and one hundred bottles of an\nevening were not unknown. On the whole I made few mistakes, though\n21 recollections of a student\nI have been known to send out ointment and pill boxes with elaborate\ndirections on the lid and nothing inside. I had my own visiting list, also,\nthe poorest or the most convalescent, and I saw a great deal, for better or\nworse, of very low life. Twice I returned to this Birmingham practice and\n5 always my relations with the family became closer. At my second visit my\nknowledge had greatly extended and I did midwifery cases, and the more\nsevere cases in general practice as well as all the dispensing. I had no time\nto spend any money and it was as well, for every shilling was needed at\nhome.\n10 It was in this year that I first learned that shillings might be earned\nin other ways than by filling phials. Some friend remarked to me that\nmy letters were very vivid and surely I could write some things to sell. I\nmay say that the general aspiration towards literature was tremendously\nstrong upon me, and that my mind was reaching out in what seemed an\n15 aimless way in all sorts of directions. I used to be allowed twopence for\nmy lunch, that being the price of a mutton pie, but near the pie shop was\na second-hand book shop with a barrel full of old books and the legend\n\u2018Your choice for 2d.\u2019 stuck above it. Often the price of my luncheon used\nto be spent on some sample out of this barrel, and I have within reach of\n20 my arm as I write these lines, copies of Gordon\u2019s Tacitus, Temple\u2019s works,\nPope\u2019s Homer, Addison\u2019s Spectator and Swift\u2019s works, which all came out\nof the twopenny box. Anyone observing my actions and tastes would\nhave said that so strong a spring would certainly overflow, but for my\nown part I never dreamed I could myself produce decent prose, and the\n25 remark of my friend, who was by no means given to flattery, took me\ngreatly by surprise. I sat down, however, and wrote a little adventure sto-\nry which I called \u2018The Mystery of the Sassassa Valley.\u2019 To my great joy\nand surprise it was accepted by Chambers\u2019 Journal, and I received three\nguineas. It mattered not that other attempts failed. I had done it once and\n30 I cheered myself by the thought that I could do it again. It was years be-\nfore I touched Chambers\u2019 again, but in 1879 I had a story, \u2018The American\u2019s\nTale,\u2019 in London Society, for which also I got a small cheque. But the idea\nof real success was still far from my mind.\nDuring all this time our family affairs had taken no turn for the better,\n35 and had it not been for my excursions and for the work of my sisters we\ncould hardly have carried on. My father\u2019s health had utterly broken, he\nhad to retire to that Convalescent Home in which the last years of his\nlife were spent, and I, aged twenty, found myself practically the head of a\n22 chapter 3\nlarge and struggling family. My father\u2019s life was full of the tragedy of un-\nfulfilled powers and of undeveloped gifts. He had his weaknesses, as all\nof us have ours, but he had also some very remarkable and outstanding\nvirtues. A tall man, long-bearded, and elegant, he had a charm of manner\nand a courtesy of bearing which I have seldom seen equalled. His wit 5\nwas quick and playful. He possessed, also, a remarkable delicacy of mind\nwhich would give him moral courage enough to rise and leave any com-\npany which talked in a manner which was coarse. When he passed away\na few years later I am sure that Charles Doyle had no enemy in the world,\nand that those who knew him best sympathized most with the hard fate 10\nwhich had thrown him, a man of sensitive genius, into an environment\nwhich neither his age nor his nature was fitted to face. He was unworldly\nand unpractical and his family suffered for it, but even his faults were in\nsome ways the result of his developed spirituality. He lived and died a\nfervent son of the Roman Catholic faith. My mother, however, who had 15\nnever been a very devoted daughter of that great institution, became less\nso as life progressed, and finally found her chief consolation in the An-\nglican fold.\nThis brings me to my own spiritual unfolding, if such it may be called,\nduring those years of constant struggle. I have already in my account of 20\nthe Jesuits shown how, even as a boy, all that was sanest and most gen-\nerous in my nature rose up against a narrow theology and an uncharita-\nble outlook upon the other great religions of the world. In the Catholic\nChurch to doubt anything is to doubt everything, for since it is a vital\naxiom that doubt is a mortal sin when once it has, unbidden and unap- 25\npeasable, come upon you, everything is loosened and you look upon the\nwhole wonderful interdependent scheme with other and more critical\neyes. Thus viewed there was much to attract \u2013 its traditions, its unbroken\nand solemn ritual, the beauty and truth of many of its observances, its\npoetical appeal to the emotions, the sensual charm of music, light and in- 30\ncense, its power as an instrument of law and order. For the guidance of an\nunthinking and uneducated world it could in many ways hardly be sur-\npassed, as has been shown in Paraguay, and in the former Ireland where,\noutside agrarian trouble, crime was hardly known. All this I could clearly\nsee, but if I may claim any outstanding characteristic in my life, it is that 35\nI have never paltered or compromised with religious matters, that I have\nalways weighed them very seriously, and that there was something in me\nwhich made it absolutely impossible, even when my most immediate in-\n23 recollections of a student\nterests were concerned, to say anything about them save that which I, in\nthe depth of my being, really believed to be true. Judging it thus by all the\nnew knowledge which came to me both from my reading and from my\nstudies, I found that the foundations not only of Roman Catholicism but\n5 of the whole Christian faith, as presented to me in nineteenth century\ntheology, were so weak that my mind could not build upon them. It is to\nbe remembered that these were the years when Huxley, Tyndall, Darwin,\nHerbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill were our chief philosophers, and\nthat even the man in the street felt the strong sweeping current of their\n10 thought, while to the young student, eager and impressionable, it was\noverwhelming. I know now that their negative attitude was even more\nmistaken, and very much more dangerous, than the positive positions\nwhich they attacked with such destructive criticism. A gap had opened\nbetween our fathers and ourselves so suddenly and completely that\n15 when a Gladstone wrote to uphold the Gadarene swine, or the six days of\nCreation, the youngest student rightly tittered over his arguments, and it\ndid not need a Huxley to demolish them. I can see now very clearly how\ndeplorable it is that manifest absurdities should be allowed to contin-\nue without even a footnote to soften them in the sacred text, because it\n20 has the effect that what is indeed sacred becomes overlaid, and one can\neasily be persuaded that what is false in parts can have no solid binding\nforce. There are no worse enemies of true religion than those who clam-\nour against all revision or modification of that strange mass of superbly\ngood and questionable matter which we lump all together into a single\n25 volume as if there were the same value to all of it. It is not solid gold, but\ngold in clay, and if this be understood the earnest seeker will not cast it\naside when he comes upon the clay, but will value the gold the more in\nthat he has himself separated it.\nIt was, then, all Christianity, and not Roman Catholicism alone,\n30 which had alienated my mind and driven me to an agnosticism, which\nnever for an instant degenerated into atheism, for I had a very keen\nperception of the wonderful poise of the universe and the tremendous\npower of conception and sustenance which it implied. I was reverent in\nall my doubts and never ceased to think upon the matter, but the more\n35 I thought the more confirmed became my non-conformity. In a broad\nsense I was a Unitarian, save that I regarded the Bible with more criticism\nthan Unitarians usually show. This negative position was so firm that it\nseemed to me to be a terminus; whereas it proved only a junction on\n24 chapter 3\nthe road of life where I was destined to change from the old well-worn\nline on to a new one. Every materialist, as I can now clearly see, is a case\nof arrested development. He has cleared his ruins, but has not begun to\nbuild that which would shelter him. As to psychic knowledge, I knew it\nonly by the account of exposures in the police courts and the usual wild 5\nand malicious statements in the public press. Years were to pass before\nI understood that in that direction might be found the positive proofs\nwhich I constantly asserted were the only conditions upon which I could\nresume any sort of allegiance to the unseen. I must have definite demon-\nstration, for if it were to be a matter of faith then I might as well go back 10\nto the faith of my fathers. \u2018Never will I accept anything which cannot be\nproved to me. The evils of religion have all come from accepting things\nwhich cannot be proved.\u2019 So I said at the time and I have been true to my\nresolve.\nI would not give the impression that my life was gloomy or morbidly 15\nthoughtful because it chanced that I had some extra cares and some wor-\nrying thoughts. I had an eager nature which missed nothing in the way of\nfun which could be gathered, and I had a great capacity for enjoyment. I\nread much. I played games all I could. I danced, and I sampled the drama\nwhenever I had a sixpence to carry me to the gallery. On one occasion I 20\ngot into a row which might have been serious. I was waiting on the gal-\nlery steps with a great line of people, the shut door still facing us. There\nwere half a dozen soldiers in the crowd and one of these squeezed a girl\nup against the wall in such a way that she began to scream. As I was near\nthem I asked the man to be more gentle, on which he dug his elbow with 25\nall his force into my ribs. He turned on me as he did so, and I hit him\nwith both hands in the face. He bored into me and pushed me up into\nthe angle of the door, but I had a grip of him and he could not hit me,\nthough he tried to kick me in cowardly fashion with his knee. Several of\nhis comrades threatened me, and one hit me on the head with his cane, 30\ncracking my hat. At this moment luckily the door opened and the rush\nof the crowd carried the soldiers on, one sympathetic corporal saying,\n\u2018Take your breath, sir! Take your breath!\u2019 I threw my man through the\nopen door and came home, for it was clearly asking for trouble if I re-\nmained. It was a good escape from an awkward business. 35\nAnd now I come to the first real outstanding adventure in my life,\nwhich is worthy of a fresh chapter and of a more elaborate treatment.\n25 Chapter 4\nWHALING IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN\n5 The Hope \u2013 John Gray \u2013 Boxing \u2013 The Terrible Mate \u2013 Our Criminal \u2013 First\nSight of a Woman \u2013 A Hurricane \u2013 Dangers of the Fishing \u2013 Three Dips in\nthe Arctic \u2013 The Idlers\u2019 Boat \u2013 Whale Taking \u2013 Glamour of the Arctic \u2013 Effect\nof Voyage.\n10 It was in the Hope, under the command of the well-known whaler, John\nGray, that I paid a seven months\u2019 visit to the Arctic Seas in the year 1880.\nI went in the capacity of surgeon, but as I was only twenty years of age\nwhen I started, and as my knowledge of medicine was that of an average\nthird year\u2019s student, I have often thought that it was as well that there was\n15 no very serious call upon my services.\nIt came about in this way. One raw afternoon in Edinburgh, whilst I\nwas sitting reading hard for one of those examinations which blight the\nlife of a medical student, there entered to me one Currie, a fellow-student\nwith whom I had some slight acquaintance. The monstrous question\n20 which he asked drove all thought of my studies out of my head.\n\u2018Would you care,\u2019 said he, \u2018to start next week for a whaling cruise?\nYou\u2019ll be surgeon, two pound ten a month and three shillings a ton oil\nmoney.\u2019\n\u2018How do you know I\u2019ll get the berth?\u2019 was my natural question.\n25 \u2018Because I have it myself. I find at this last moment that I can\u2019t go, and\nI want to get a man to take my place.\u2019\n\u2018How about an Arctic kit?\u2019\n\u2018You can have mine.\u2019\nIn an instant the thing was settled, and within a few minutes the cur-\n30 rent of my life had been deflected into a new channel.\nIn little more than a week I was in Peterhead, and busily engaged,\nwith the help of the steward, in packing away my scanty belongings in the\nlocker beneath my bunk on the good ship Hope.\nI speedily found that the chief duty of the surgeon was to be the\n35 companion of the captain, who is cut off by the etiquette of the trade\nfrom anything but very brief and technical talks with his other officers. I\nshould have found it intolerable if the captain had been a bad fellow, but\nJohn Gray of the Hope was a really splendid man, a grand seaman and a\n26 chapter 4\nserious-minded Scot, so that he and I formed a comradeship which was\nnever marred during our long t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. I see him now, his ruddy face,\nhis grizzled hair and beard, his very light blue eyes always looking into far\nspaces, and his erect muscular figure. Taciturn, sardonic, stern on occa-\nsion, but always a good just man at bottom. 5\nThere was one curious thing about the manning of the Hope. The\nman who signed on as first mate was a little, decrepit, broken fellow, ab-\nsolutely incapable of performing the duties. The cook\u2019s assistant, on the\nother hand, was a giant of a man, red-bearded, bronzed, with huge limbs,\nand a voice of thunder. But the moment that the ship cleared the harbour 10\nthe little, decrepit mate disappeared into the cook\u2019s galley, and acted as\nscullery-boy for the voyage, while the mighty scullery-boy walked aft and\nbecame chief mate. The fact was, that the one had the certificate, but was\npast sailoring, while the other could neither read nor write, but was as\nfine a seaman as ever lived; so, by an agreement to which everybody con- 15\ncerned was party, they swapped their berths when they were at sea.\nColin McLean, with his six foot of stature, his erect, stalwart figure,\nand his fierce, red beard, pouring out from between the flaps of his seal-\ning-cap, was an officer by natural selection, which is a higher title than\nthat of a Board of Trade certificate. His only fault was that he was a very 20\nhot-blooded man, and that a little would excite him to a frenzy. I have\na vivid recollection of an evening which I spent in dragging him off the\nsteward, who had imprudently made some criticism upon his way of at-\ntacking a whale which had escaped. Both men had had some rum, which\nhad made the one argumentative and the other violent, and as we were 25\nall three seated in a space of about seven by four, it took some hard work\nto prevent bloodshed. Every now and then, just as I thought all danger\nwas past, the steward would begin again with his fatuous, \u2018No offence,\nColin, but all I says is that if you had been a bit quicker on the fush \u2013 \u2019.\nI don\u2019t know how often this sentence was begun, but never once was it 30\nended; for at the word \u2018fush\u2019 Colin always seized him by the throat, and\nI Colin round the waist, and we struggled until we were all panting and\nexhausted. Then when the steward had recovered a little breath he would\nstart that miserable sentence once more, and the \u2018fush\u2019 would be the sig-\nnal for another encounter. I really believe that if I had not been there the 35\nmate would have hurt him, for he was quite the angriest man that I have\never seen.\nThere were fifty men upon our whaler, of whom half were Scotch-\n27 whaling in the arctic ocean\nmen and half Shetlanders, whom we picked up at Lerwick as we passed.\nThe Shetlanders were the steadier and more tractable, quiet, decent, and\nsoft-spoken; while the Scotch seamen were more likely to give trouble,\nbut also more virile and of stronger character. The officers and harpoon-\n5 ers were all Scotch, but as ordinary seamen, and especially as boatmen,\nthe Shetlanders were as good as could be wished.\nThere was only one man on board who belonged neither to Scot-\nland nor to Shetland, and he was the mystery of the ship. He was a tall,\nswarthy, dark-eyed man, with blue-black hair and beard, singularly hand-\n10 some features, and a curious, reckless sling of his shoulders when he\nwalked. It was rumoured that he came from the south of England, and\nthat he had fled thence to avoid the law. He made friends with no one,\nand spoke very seldom, but he was one of the smartest seamen in the\nship. I could believe from his appearance that his temper was Satanic, and\n15 that the crime for which he was hiding may have been a bloody one. Only\nonce he gave us a glimpse of his hidden fires. The cook \u2013 a very burly,\npowerful man \u2013 the little mate was only assistant \u2013 had a private store of\nrum, and treated himself so liberally to it that for three successive days\nthe dinner of the crew was ruined. On the third day our silent outlaw\n20 approached the cook with a brass saucepan in his hand. He said nothing,\nbut he struck the man such a frightful blow that his head flew through\nthe bottom and the sides of the pan were left dangling round his neck.\nThe half-drunken, half-stunned cook talked of fighting, but he was soon\nmade to feel that the sympathy of the ship was against him, so he reeled\n25 back, grumbling, to his duties while the avenger relapsed into his usual\nmoody indifference. We heard no further complaints of the cooking.\nI have spoken of the steward, and as I look back at that long voy-\nage, during which for seven months we never set foot on land, the kind-\nly open face of Jack Lamb comes back to me. He had a beautiful and\n30 sympathetic tenor voice, and many an hour have I listened to it with its\naccompaniment of rattling plates and jingling knives, as he cleaned up\nthe dishes in his pantry. He had a great memory for pathetic and sen-\ntimental songs, and it is only when you have not seen a woman\u2019s face\nfor six months that you realize what sentiment means. When Jack trilled\n35 out \u2018Her bright smile haunts me still,\u2019 or \u2018Wait for me at Heaven\u2019s Gate,\nsweet Belle Mahone,\u2019 he filled us all with a vague sweet discontent which\ncomes back to me now as I think of it. To appreciate a woman one has\nto be out of sight of one for six months. I can well remember that as we\n28 chapter 4\nrounded the north of Scotland on our return we dipped our flag to the\nlighthouse, being only some hundreds of yards from the shore. A figure\nemerged to answer our salute, and the excited whisper ran through the\nship, \u2018It\u2019s a wumman!\u2019 The captain was on the bridge with his telescope. I\nhad the binoculars in the bows. Everyone was staring. She was well over 5\nfifty, short skirts and sea boots \u2013 but she was a \u2018wumman.\u2019 \u2018Anything in\na mutch!\u2019 the sailors used to say, and I was of the same way of thinking.\nHowever, all this has come before its time. It was, I find by my log, on\nFebruary 28 at 2 p.m. that we sailed from Peterhead, amid a great crowd\nand uproar. The decks were as clean as a yacht, and it was very unlike 10\nmy idea of a whaler. We ran straight into bad weather and the glass went\ndown at one time to 28.375, which is the lowest reading I can remember\nin all my ocean wanderings. We just got into Lerwick Harbour before\nthe full force of the hurricane broke, which was so great that lying at an-\nchor with bare poles and partly screened we were blown over to an acute 15\nangle. If it had taken us a few hours earlier we should certainly have lost\nour boats \u2013 and the boats are the life of a whaler. It was March 11 before\nthe weather moderated enough to let us get on, and by that time there\nwere twenty whalers in the bay, so that our setting forth was quite an\noccasion. That night and for a day longer the Hope had to take refuge in 20\nthe lee of one of the outlying islands. I got ashore and wandered among\npeat bogs, meeting strange, barbarous, kindly people who knew nothing\nof the world. I was led back to the ship by a wild, long-haired girl holding\na torch, for the peat holes make it dangerous at night \u2013 I can see her now,\nher tangled black hair, her bare legs, madder-stained petticoat, and wild 25\nfeatures under the glare of the torch. I spoke to one old man there who\nasked me the news. I said, \u2018The Tay bridge is down,\u2019 which was then a\nfairly stale item. He said, \u2018Eh, have they built a brig ower the Tay?\u2019 After\nthat I felt inclined to tell him about the Indian Mutiny.\nWhat surprised me most in the Arctic regions was the rapidity with 30\nwhich you reach them. I had never realized that they lie at our very doors.\nI think that we were only four days out from Shetland when we were\namong the drift ice. I awoke one morning to hear the bump, bump of the\nfloating pieces against the side of the ship, and I went on deck to see the\nwhole sea covered with them to the horizon. They were none of them 35\nlarge, but they lay so thick that a man might travel far by springing from\none to the other. Their dazzling whiteness made the sea seem bluer by\ncontrast, and with a blue sky above, and that glorious Arctic air in one\u2019s\n29 whaling in the arctic ocean\nnostrils, it was a morning to remember. Once on one of the swaying,\nrocking pieces we saw a huge seal, sleek, sleepy, and imperturbable, look-\ning up with the utmost assurance at the ship as if it knew that the close\ntime had still three weeks to run. Further on we saw on the ice the long\n5 human-like prints of a bear. All this with the snowdrops of Scotland still\nfresh in our glasses in the cabin.\nI have spoken about the close time, and I may explain that, by an\nagreement between the Norwegian and British Governments, the sub-\njects of both nations are forbidden to kill a seal before April 3. The reason\n10 for this is that the breeding season is in March, and if the mothers should\nbe killed before the young are able to take care of themselves, the race\nwould soon become extinct. For breeding purposes the seals all come\ntogether at a variable spot, which is evidently prearranged among them,\nand as this place can be anywhere within many hundreds of square miles\n15 of floating ice, it is no easy matter for the fisher to find it. The means by\nwhich he sets about it are simple but ingenious. As the ship makes its\nway through the loose ice-streams, a school of seals is observed travel-\nling through the water. Their direction is carefully taken by compass and\nmarked upon the chart. An hour afterwards perhaps another school is\n20 seen. This is also marked. When these bearings have been taken several\ntimes, the various lines upon the chart are prolonged until they intersect.\nAt this point, or near it, it is likely that the main pack of the seals will be\nfound.\nWhen you do come upon it, it is a wonderful sight. I suppose it is the\n25 largest assembly of creatures upon the face of the world \u2013 and this upon\nthe open icefields hundreds of miles from the Greenland coast. Some-\nwhere between 71 deg. and 75 deg. is the rendezvous, and the longitude\nis even vaguer; but the seals have no difficulty in finding the address.\nFrom the crow\u2019s nest at the top of the main-mast, one can see no end of\n30 them. On the furthest visible ice one can still see that sprinkling of pep-\nper grains. And the young lie everywhere also, snow-white slugs, with a\nlittle black nose and large dark eyes. Their half-human cries fill the air;\nand when you are sitting in the cabin of a ship which is in the heart of the\nseal-pack, you would think you were next door to a monstrous nursery.\n35 The Hope was one of the first to find the seal-pack that year, but before\nthe day came when hunting was allowed, we had a succession of strong\ngales, followed by a severe roll, which tilted the floating ice and launched\nthe young seals prematurely into the water. And so, when the law at last\n30 chapter 4\nallowed us to begin work, Nature had left us with very little work to do.\nHowever, at dawn upon the third, the ship\u2019s company took to the ice, and\nbegan to gather in its murderous harvest. It is brutal work, though not\nmore brutal than that which goes on to supply every dinner-table in the\ncountry. And yet those glaring crimson pools upon the dazzling white of 5\nthe icefields, under the peaceful silence of a blue Arctic sky, did seem a\nhorrible intrusion. But an inexorable demand creates an inexorable sup-\nply, and the seals, by their death, help to give a living to the long line\nof seamen, dockers, tanners, curers, triers, chandlers, leather merchants,\nand oil-sellers, who stand between this annual butchery on the one hand, 10\nand the exquisite, with his soft leather boots, or the savant, using a deli-\ncate oil for his philosophical instruments, upon the other.\nI have cause to remember that first day of sealing on account of the\nadventures which befell me. I have said that a strong swell had arisen,\nand as this was dashing the floating ice together the captain thought it 15\ndangerous for an inexperienced man to venture upon it. And so, just as I\nwas clambering over the bulwarks with the rest, he ordered me back and\ntold me to remain on board. My remonstrances were useless, and at last,\nin the blackest of tempers, I seated myself upon the top of the bulwarks,\nwith my feet dangling over the outer side, and there I nursed my wrath, 20\nswinging up and down with the roll of the ship. It chanced, however, that\nI was really seated upon a thin sheet of ice which had formed upon the\nwood, and so when the swell threw her over to a particularly acute angle,\nI shot off and vanished into the sea between two ice-blocks. As I rose, I\nclawed on to one of these, and soon scrambled on board again. The ac- 25\ncident brought about what I wished, however, for the captain remarked\nthat as I was bound to fall into the ocean in any case, I might just as well\nbe on the ice as on the ship. I justified his original caution by falling in\ntwice again during the day, and I finished it ignominiously by having to\ntake to my bed while all my clothes were drying in the engine-room. I 30\nwas consoled for my misfortunes by finding that they amused the cap-\ntain to such an extent that they drove the ill-success of our sealing out of\nhis head, and I had to answer to the name of \u2018the great northern diver\u2019\nfor a long time thereafter. I had a narrow escape once through stepping\nbackwards over the edge of a piece of floating ice while I was engaged in 35\nskinning a seal. I had wandered away from the others, and no one saw\nmy misfortune. The face of the ice was so even that I had no purchase by\nwhich to pull myself up, and my body was rapidly becoming numb in the\n31 whaling in the arctic ocean\nfreezing water. At last, however, I caught hold of the hind flipper of the\ndead seal, and there was a kind of nightmare tug-of-war, the question be-\ning whether I should pull the seal off or pull myself on. At last, however, I\ngot my knee over the edge and rolled on to it. I remember that my clothes\n5 were as hard as a suit of armour by the time I reached the ship, and that I\nhad to thaw my crackling garments before I could change them.\nThis April sealing is directed against the mothers and young. Then, in\nMay, the sealer goes further north, and about latitude 77 deg. or 78 deg.\nhe comes upon the old male seals, who are by no means such easy vic-\n10 tims. They are wary creatures, and it takes good long-range shooting to\nbag them. Then, in June, the sealing is over, and the ship bears away fur-\nther north still, until in the 79th or 80th degree she is in the best Green-\nland whaling latitudes. There we stayed for three months or so, with very\nvarying fortunes, for though we pursued many whales, only four were\n15 slain.\nThere are eight boats on board a whaler, but it is usual to send out\nonly seven, for it takes six men to man each, so that when seven are out\nno one is left on board save the so-called \u2018idlers\u2019 who have not signed to\ndo seaman\u2019s work at all. It happened, however, that aboard the Hope the\n20 idlers were rather a hefty crowd, so we volunteered to man the odd boat,\nand we made it, in our own estimation at least, one of the most efficient,\nboth in sealing and in whaling. The steward, the second engineer, the\ndonkey-engine man, and I were the oars, with a red-headed Highlander\nfor harpooner and the handsome outlaw to steer. Our tally of seals was\n25 high, and in whaling we were once the lancing and once the harpooning\nboat, so our record was good. So congenial was the work to me that Cap-\ntain Gray was good enough to offer to make me harpooner as well as sur-\ngeon, with the double pay, if I would come with him on a second voyage.\nIt is well that I refused, for the life is dangerously fascinating.\n30 It is exciting work pulling on to a whale. Your own back is turned to\nhim, and all you know about him is what you read upon the face of the\nboat-steerer. He is staring out over your head, watching the creature as\nit swims slowly through the water, raising his hand now and again as a\nsignal to stop rowing when he sees that the eye is coming round, and\n35 then resuming the stealthy approach when the whale is end on. There are\nso many floating pieces of ice, that as long as the oars are quiet the boat\nalone will not cause the creature to dive. So you creep slowly up, and at\nlast you are so near that the boat-steerer knows that you can get there be-\n32 chapter 4\nfore the creature has time to dive \u2013 for it takes some little time to get that\nhuge body into motion. You see a sudden gleam in his eyes, and a flush\nin his cheeks, and it\u2019s \u2018Give way, boys! Give way, all! Hard!\u2019 Click goes\nthe trigger of the big harpoon gun, and the foam flies from your oars. Six\nstrokes, perhaps, and then with a dull greasy squelch the bows run upon 5\nsomething soft, and you and your oars are sent flying in every direction.\nBut little you care for that, for as you touched the whale you have heard\nthe crash of the gun, and know that the harpoon has been fired point-\nblank into the huge, lead-coloured curve of its side. The creature sinks\nlike a stone, the bows of the boat splash down into the water again, but 10\nthere is the little red Jack flying from the centre thwart to show that you\nare fast, and there is the line whizzing swiftly under the seats and over the\nbows between your outstretched feet.\nAnd this is the great element of danger \u2013 for it is rarely indeed that\nthe whale has spirit enough to turn upon its enemies. The line is very 15\ncarefully coiled by a special man named the line-coiler, and it is warrant-\ned not to kink. If it should happen to do so, however, and if the loop\ncatches the limbs of any one of the boat\u2019s crew, that man goes to his death\nso rapidly that his comrades hardly know that he has gone. It is a waste\nof fish to cut the line, for the victim is already hundreds of fathoms deep. 20\n\u2018Haud your hand, mon,\u2019 cried the harpooner, as a seaman raised his\nknife on such an occasion. \u2018The fush will be a fine thing for the widdey.\u2019 It\nsounds callous, but there was philosophy at the base of it.\nThis is the harpooning, and that boat has no more to do. But the lanc-\ning, when the weary fish is killed with the cold steel, is a more exciting 25\nbecause it is a more prolonged experience. You may be for half an hour\nso near to the creature that you can lay your hand upon its slimy side.\nThe whale appears to have but little sensibility to pain, for it never winces\nwhen the long lances are passed through its body. But its instinct urges\nit to get its tail to work on the boats, and yours urges you to keep poling 30\nand boat-hooking along its side, so as to retain your safe position near its\nshoulder. Even there, however, we found on one occasion that we were\nnot quite out of danger\u2019s way, for the creature in its flurry raised its huge\nside-flapper and poised it over the boat. One flap would have sent us to\nthe bottom of the sea, and I can never forget how, as we pushed our way 35\nfrom under, each of us held one hand up to stave off that great, threat-\nening fin \u2013 as if any strength of ours could have availed if the whale had\nmeant it to descend. But it was spent with loss of blood, and instead of\n33 whaling in the arctic ocean\ncoming down the fin rolled over the other way, and we knew that it was\ndead. Who would swap that moment for any other triumph that sport\ncan give?\nThe peculiar other-world feeling of the Arctic regions \u2013 a feeling so\n5 singular that if you have once been there the thought of it haunts you all\nyour life \u2013 is due largely to the perpetual daylight. Night seems more or-\nange-tinted and subdued than day, but there is no great difference. Some\ncaptains have been known to turn their hours right round out of caprice,\nwith breakfast at night and supper at ten in the morning. There are your\n10 twenty-four hours, and you may carve them as you like. After a month\nor two the eyes grow weary of the eternal light, and you appreciate what\na soothing thing our darkness is. I can remember as we came abreast of\nIceland, on our return, catching our first glimpse of a star, and being una-\nble to take my eyes from it, it seemed such a dainty little twinkling thing.\n15 Half the beauties of Nature are lost through over-familiarity.\nYour sense of loneliness also heightens the effect of the Arctic Seas.\nWhen we were in whaling latitudes it is probable that, with the exception\nof our consort, there was no vessel within 800 miles of us. For seven long\nmonths no letter and no news came to us from the southern world. We\n20 had left in exciting times. The Afghan campaign had been undertaken,\nand war seemed imminent with Russia. We returned opposite the mouth\nof the Baltic without any means of knowing whether some cruiser might\nnot treat us as we had treated the whales. When we met a fishing-boat\nat the north of Shetland our first inquiry was as to peace or war. Great\n25 events had happened during those seven months: the defeat of Maiwand\nand the famous march of Roberts from Cabul to Candahar. But it was all\nhaze to us; and, to this day, I have never been able to get that particular\nbit of military history straightened out in my own mind.\nThe perpetual light, the glare of the white ice, the deep blue of the wa-\n30 ter, these are the things which one remembers most clearly, and the dry,\ncrisp, exhilarating air, which makes mere life the keenest of pleasures. And\nthen there are the innumerable sea-birds, whose call is for ever ringing in\nyour ears \u2013 the gulls, the fulmars, the snow-birds, the burgomasters, the\nlooms, and the rotjes. These fill the air, and below, the waters are for ever\n35 giving you a peep of some strange new creature. The commercial whale\nmay not often come your way, but his less valuable brethren abound on\nevery side. The finner shows his 90 feet of worthless tallow, with the ab-\nsolute conviction that no whaler would condescend to lower a boat for\n34 chapter 4\nhim. The mis-shapen hunchback whale, the ghost-like white whale, the\nnarwhal, with his unicorn horn, the queer-looking bottle-nose, the huge,\nsluggish, Greenland shark, and the terrible killing grampus, the most for-\nmidable of all the monsters of the deep \u2013 these are the creatures who own\nthose unsailed seas. On the ice are the seals, the saddle-backs, the ground 5\nseals and the huge bladdernoses, 12 feet from nose to tail, with the power\nof blowing up a great blood-red football upon their noses when they are\nangry, which they usually are. Occasionally one sees a white Arctic fox\nupon the ice, and everywhere are the bears. The floes in the neighbour-\nhood of the sealing-ground are all criss-crossed with their tracks \u2013 poor 10\nharmless creatures, with the lurch and roll of a deep-sea mariner. It is for\nthe sake of the seals that they come out over those hundreds of miles of\nice; and they have a very ingenious method of catching them, for they\nwill choose a big icefield with just one blow-hole for seals in the middle\nof it. Here the bear will squat, with its powerful forearms crooked round 15\nthe hole. Then, when the seal\u2019s head pops up, the great paws snap togeth-\ner, and Bruin has got his luncheon. We used occasionally to burn some of\nthe cook\u2019s refuse in the engine-room fires, and the smell would, in a few\nhours, bring up every bear for many miles to leeward of us.\nThough twenty or thirty whales have been taken in a single year in 20\nthe Greenland seas, it is probable that the great slaughter of last century\nhas diminished their number until there are not more than a few hun-\ndreds in existence. I mean, of course, of the right whale, for the others,\nas I have said, abound. It is difficult to compute the numbers of a spe-\ncies which comes and goes over great tracts of water and among huge 25\nicefields, but the fact that the same whale is often pursued by the same\nwhaler upon successive trips shows how limited their number must be.\nThere was one, I remember, which was conspicuous through having\na huge wart, the size and shape of a beehive, upon one of the flukes\nof its tail. \u2018I\u2019ve been after that fellow three times,\u2019 said the captain, as 30\nwe dropped our boats. \u2018He got away in \u201971. In \u201974 we had him fast, but\nthe harpoon drew. In \u201976 a fog saved him. It\u2019s odds that we have him\nnow!\u2019 I fancied that the betting lay rather the other way myself, and so\nit proved, for that warty tail is still thrashing the Arctic seas for all that\nI know to the contrary. 35\nI shall never forget my own first sight of a right whale. It had been\nseen by the look-out on the other side of a small icefield, but had sunk\nas we all rushed on deck. For ten minutes we awaited its reappearance,\n35 whaling in the arctic ocean\nand I had taken my eyes from the place, when a general gasp of aston-\nishment made me glance up, and there was the whale in the air. Its tail\nwas curved just as a trout\u2019s is in jumping, and every bit of its glistening\nlead-coloured body was clear of the water. It was little wonder that I\n5 should be astonished, for the captain, after thirty voyages, had never\nseen such a sight. On catching it we discovered that it was very thickly\ncovered with a red, crab-like parasite, about the size of a shilling, and\nwe conjectured that it was the irritation of these creatures which had\ndriven it wild. If a man had short, nailless flippers, and a prosperous\n10 family of fleas upon his back, he would appreciate the situation.\nApart from sport, there is a glamour about those circum-polar\nregions which must affect everyone who has penetrated to them. My\nheart goes out to that old, grey-headed whaling captain who, having\nbeen left for an instant when at death\u2019s door, staggered off in his night\n15 gear, and was found by nurses far from his house and still, as he mum-\nbled, \u2018pushing to the norrard.\u2019 So an Arctic fox, which a friend of mine\nendeavoured to tame, escaped, and was caught many months after-\nwards in a gamekeeper\u2019s trap in Caithness. It was also pushing norrard,\nthough who can say by what strange compass it took its bearings? It\n20 is a region of purity, of white ice and of blue water, with no human\ndwelling within a thousand miles to sully the freshness of the breeze\nwhich blows across the icefields. And then it is a region of romance\nalso. You stand on the very brink of the unknown, and every duck that\nyou shoot bears pebbles in its gizzard which come from a land which\n25 the maps know not. It was a strange and fascinating chapter of my life.\nI went on board the whaler a big, straggling youth, I came off it a\npowerful, well-grown man. I have no doubt that my physical health\nduring my whole life has been affected by that splendid air, and that\nthe inexhaustible store of energy which I have enjoyed is to some ex-\n30 tent drawn from the same source. It was mental and spiritual stagna-\ntion, or even worse, for there is a coarsening effect in so circumscribed\na life with comrades who were fine, brave fellows, but naturally rough\nand wild. However I had my health to show for it, and also more mon-\ney than I had ever possessed before. I was still boyish in many ways,\n35 and I remember that I concealed gold pieces in every pocket of every\ngarment, that my mother might have the excitement of hunting for\nthem. It added some fifty pounds to her small exchequer.\nNow I had a straight run in to my final examination, which I passed\n36 chapter 4\nwith fair but not notable distinction at the end of the winter session of\n1881. I was now a Bachelor of Medicine and a Master of Surgery, fairly\nlaunched upon my professional career.\n37 Chapter 5\nTHE VOYAGE TO WEST AFRICA\n5 The Mayumba \u2013 Fearful Weather \u2013 An Escape \u2013 Hanno\u2019s Voyage \u2013 Atlantis \u2013\nA Land of Death \u2013 Blackwater Fever \u2013 Strange Fish \u2013Missionaries \u2013 Danger\nof Luxury \u2013 A Foolish Swim \u2013 The Ship on Fire \u2013 England Once More.\nIt had always been my intention to take a voyage as ship\u2019s surgeon\n10 when I had taken my degree, as I could in this way see something of the\nworld, and at the same time earn a little of the money which I so badly\nneeded if I were ever to start in practice for myself. When a man is in the\nvery early twenties he will not be taken seriously as a practitioner, and\nthough I looked old for my age, it was clear that I had to fill in my time in\n15 some other way. My plans were all exceedingly fluid, and I was ready to\njoin the Army, Navy, Indian Service or anything which offered an open-\ning. I had no reason to think that I would find a billet upon a passenger\nship and had nearly forgotten that I had my name down, when I suddenly\nreceived a telegram telling me to come to Liverpool and to take medical\n20 charge of the African Steam Navigation Company\u2019s Mayumba, bound for\nthe West Coast. In a week I was there, and on October 22, 1881, we start-\ned on our voyage.\nThe Mayumba was a trim little steamer of about 4,000 tons \u2013 a gi-\nant after my experience in the 200-ton whaler. She was built for com-\n25 merce, carrying mixed cargoes to the coast and coming back with palm\noil in puncheons, palm nuts in bulk, ivory and other tropical products.\nWhat with whale oil and palm oil there certainly seemed to be some-\nthing greasy about my horoscope. There was room for twenty or thirty\npassengers, and it was for their behoof that I was paid some \u00a312 a month.\n30 It was well that we were seaworthy, for we put out in a violent gale,\nwhich became so bad as we emerged from the Mersey that we were\nforced into Holyhead for the night. Next day, in vile and thick weather,\nwith a strong sea running, we made our way down the Irish Sea. I shall\nalways believe that I may have saved the ship from disaster, for as I was\n35 standing near the officer of the watch I suddenly caught sight of a light-\nhouse standing out in a rift in the fog. It was on the port side and I could\nnot imagine how any lighthouse could be on the port side of a ship which\nwas, as I knew, well down on the Irish coast. I hate to be an alarmist, so I\n38 chapter 5\nsimply touched the mate\u2019s sleeve, pointed to the dim outline of the light-\nhouse, and said: \u2018Is that all right?\u2019 He fairly jumped as his eye lit upon it\nand he gave a yell to the men at the wheel and rang a violent signal to the\nengine-room. The lighthouse, if I remember right, was the Tuskar, and\nwe were heading right into a rocky promontory which was concealed by 5\nthe rain and fog.\nI have been lucky in my captains, for Captain Gordon Wallace was\none of the best, and we have kept in touch during the later years. Our\npassengers were mostly for Madeira, but there were some pleasant ladies\nbound for the Coast, and some unpleasant negro traders whose manners 10\nand bearing were objectionable, but who were patrons of the line and\nmust, therefore, be tolerated. Some of these palm oil chiefs and traders\nhave incomes of many thousands a year, but as they have no cultivated\ntastes they can only spend their money on drink, debauchery and sense-\nless extravagance. One of them, I remember, had a choice selection of the 15\ndemi-monde of Liverpool to see him off.\nThe storms followed us all the way down the Channel and across the\nBay, which is normal, I suppose, at such a time of year. Everyone was\nseasick, so as doctor I had some work to do. However, before we reached\nMadeira we ran into fine weather and all our troubles were soon forgot- 20\nten. One never realizes the comfort of a dry deck until one has been an-\nkle-deep for a week. I missed the sea-boots and rough-and-ready dress of\nthe whaler, for when one is in blue serge and gilt buttons one does not\ncare to take a ducking. Just as we thought, however, that we were all right\na worse gale than ever broke over us, the wind luckily being behind us, 25\nso that it helped us on our way. With jib, trysail and main staysail, which\nwas as much as we could stand, we lurched and staggered, swept every\nnow and then by the big Atlantic combers, which were phosphorescent\nat night, so that flames of liquid fire came coursing down the decks. Very\nglad we were when after a week of storm we saw the rugged peaks of 30\nPorto Santo, an outlier of Madeira, and finally came to anchor in Funchal\nBay. It was dark when we reached our moorings and it was good to see\nthe lights of the town, and the great dark loom of the hills behind it. A lu-\nnar rainbow spanned the whole scene, a rare phenomenon which I have\nnever seen before or since. 35\nTeneriffe was our next stopping-place, Santa Cruz being the port of\ncall. In those days it did a great trade in cochineal, which was derived\nfrom an insect cultivated on the cacti. When dried they furnished the\n39 the voyage to west africa\ndye, and a packet of the creatures averaged \u00a3350 at that time, but now I\nsuppose that the German aniline dyes have killed the trade as completely\nas whaling has been killed by the mineral. A day later we were at Las Pal-\nmas, capital of Grand Canary, whence, looking back, we had a fine view\n5 of the famous Teneriffe Peak some 60 miles away. Leaving Las Palmas\nwe were in the delightful region of the northeast trade-winds, the most\nglorious part of the ocean, seldom rough, yet always lively, with foam-\ncapped seas and a clear sky. Day by day it grew hotter, however, and when\nwe lost the Trades, and sighted the Isle de Los off the Sierra Leone coast,\n10 I began to realize what the Tropics meant. When you feel your napkin at\nmeals to be an intolerable thing, and when you find that it leaves a wet\nweal across your white duck trousers, then you know that you really have\narrived.\nOn November 9 we reached Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone,\n15 our first port of call upon the African Main \u2013 a lovely spot but a place of\ndeath. Here our ladies left us, and indeed it was sad to see them go, for\nfemale lives are even shorter than male upon the coast. I speak of the days\nof malaria and blackwater fever, before Ronald Ross and others had done\ntheir great work of healing and prevention. It was a truly dreadful place in\n20 the early eighties, and the despair which reigned in the hearts of the white\npeople made them take liberties with alcohol which they would not have\ndared to take in a healthier place. A year\u2019s residence seemed to be about\nthe limit of human endurance. I remember meeting one healthy-looking\nresident who told me that he had been there three years. When I con-\n25 gratulated him he shook his head. \u2018I am a doomed man. I have advanced\nBright\u2019s disease,\u2019 said he. One wondered whether the colonies were really\nworth the price we had to pay.\nFrom Sierra Leone we steamed to Monrovia, which is the capital of\nthe negro republic of Liberia, which, as the name implies, was found-\n30 ed mainly by escaped slaves. So far as I could see it was orderly enough,\nthough all small communities which take themselves seriously have a\ncomic aspect. Thus at the time of the Franco-German War, Liberia is said\nto have sent out its single Customs boat, which represented its official\nNavy, and stopped the British mail-ship in order to send word to Europe\n35 that it did not intend to interfere in the matter.\nIt is a very monotonous view, for whether it is the Ivory Coast or the\nGold Coast, or the Liberian shore, it always presents the same features \u2013\nburning sunshine, a long swell breaking into a white line of surf, a margin\n40 chapter 5\nof golden sand, and then the low green bush, with an occasional palm\ntree rising above it. If you have seen a mile, you have seen a thousand.\nAs I write now, these ports at which we stopped, Grand Bassam, Cape\nPalmas, Accra, Cape Coast Castle, all form the same picture in my mind.\nOne incident only I can remember. At some small village, the name of 5\nwhich I have forgotten, there came off a tall young Welshman in a state of\nfurious excitement; his niggers had mutinied and he was in fear of his life.\n\u2018There they are waiting for me!\u2019 he cried, and pointed to a dusky group\nupon the distant beach. We offered to take him on, but he could not leave\nhis property, so all we could do was to promise to send a gunboat up 10\nfrom Cape Coast Castle. I have often wondered how such people got on\nafter the German menace compelled us to draw in all our outlying fleets.\nThis coast is dotted at night with native fires, some of them of great\nextent, arising no doubt from their habit of burning the grass. It is inter-\nesting that in Hanno\u2019s account of his journey down the coast \u2013 the only 15\npiece of Carthaginian literature which has reached us \u2013 he talks also of\nthe fires which he saw at night. As he speaks of gorillas it is probable that\nhe got as far as the Gaboon, or south of the Line. He saw great volcanic\nactivity, and the remains of it is still visible at Fernando Po, which is al-\nmost all volcanic. In Hanno\u2019s time, however, the hills were actually spout- 20\ning fire and the country was a sea of flame, so that he dare not set foot on\nshore. I have wondered sometimes whether the last cataclysm at Atlantis\nmay not have been much later than we think. The account of Plato puts\nit at about 9000 B.C., but it may well have been a gradual thing and the\nlast spasm have been that of which Hanno saw the traces. All this activity 25\nwhich he described is exactly opposite the spot where the old continent\nwas supposed to have been.\nOur ships have rough-and-ready ways as they jog down the coast.\nOnce we moved on while a hundred native visitors were still on board.\nIt was funny to see them dive off and make for their canoes. One of them 30\nhad a tall hat, an umbrella, and a large coloured picture of the Saviour \u2013\nall of which he had bought at the trading booths which the men rig up in\nthe forecastle. These impedimenta did not prevent him from swimming\nto his boat. At another minor port, since we were pressed for time, we\nsimply threw our consignment of barrel staves overboard, knowing that 35\nsoon or late they would wash up on the beach, though how the real own-\ner could make good his claim to them I do not know. Occasionally the\nnative scores in this game. Some years ago, before Dahomey was annexed\n41 the voyage to west africa\nby the French, the captain took the oil casks on board at Whydah by\nmeans of a long rope and a donkey engine, an ingenious way of avoiding\nthe surf, which came to a sudden stop when a company of the famous\nAmazons appeared and threatened to fire upon the ship if they did not\n5 pay their dues to the surf boats in the ordinary fashion.\nI had myself to pay my dues to the climate, for on November 18 I find\nan eloquent gap in my diary. We had reached Lagos, and there, rolling in\na greasy swell off that huge lagoon, the germ or the mosquito or whatever\nit was reached me and I was down with a very sharp fever. I remember\n10 staggering to my bunk and then all was blotted out. As I was myself doc-\ntor there was no one to look after me and I lay for several days fighting\nit out with Death in a very small ring and without a second. It speaks\nwell for my constitution that I came out a victor. I remember no psychic\nexperience, no vision, no fears, nothing save a nightmare fog from which\n15 I emerged as weak as a child. It must have been a close call, and I had\nscarcely sat up before I heard that another victim who got it at the same\ntime was dead.\nA week later found me, convalescent and full of energy once more, up\nthe Bonny River, which certainly never got its name from the Scotch ad-\n20 jective, for it is in all ways hateful with its brown smelling stream and its\nmango swamps. The natives were all absolute savages, offering up human\nsacrifices to sharks and crocodiles. The captain had heard the screams\nof the victims and seen them dragged down to the water\u2019s edge, while\non another occasion he had seen the protruding skull of a man who had\n25 been buried in an ant-heap. It is all very well to make game of the mis-\nsionaries, but how could such people ever be improved if it were not for\nthe labours of devoted men?\nWe called at Fernando Po, and later at Victoria, a lovely little settle-\nment upon the Main, with the huge peak of the Cameroons rising be-\n30 hind it. A dear homely Scotch lassie was playing the part of missionary\nthere, and if she did not evangelize she at least civilized, which is more\nimportant. It lies in a beautiful bay studded with islands and well wood-\ned all round. For some reason the whole style of the scenery changes\ncompletely here, and it is the more welcome after the thousand miles of\n35 monotony to the north. All this land went, for some reason, to Germany\nlater, and has now reverted to the French, who are not, as a rule, good\nColonial neighbours. I went ashore at Victoria, and I cannot forget\nmy thrill when what I thought was a good-sized blue bird passed me\n42 chapter 5\nand I found that it was a butterfly.\nTo reach Old Calabar we had to steam for 60 miles up the Old Cala-\nbar River, the channel lying so near the shore that we brushed the trees\non one side. I lay in wait with my rifle, but though I saw the swirl of sev-\neral alligators none emerged. Old Calabar seemed the largest and most 5\nprosperous place we had visited, but here also the hand of death was over\nall, and it was \u2018eat, drink, and be merry\u2019 for the old and unsatisfactory\nreason. Here again we met one of these young lady pioneers of civiliza-\ntion. Civilization is the better, but it is a stern and dreadful call which\nsummons a woman to such a work. 10\nGetting a canoe, I ascended the river for several miles to a place\ncalled Creektown. Dark and terrible mangrove swamps lay on either side\nwith gloomy shades where nothing that is not horrible could exist. It is\nindeed a foul place. Once in an isolated tree, standing in a flood, I saw\nan evil-looking snake, worm-coloured and about 3 feet long. I shot him 15\nand saw him drift down stream. I learned later in life to give up killing\nanimals, but I confess that I have no particular compunctions about that\none. Creektown is in native territory, and the King sent down a peremp-\ntory order that we should report ourselves to him, but as it sounded omi-\nnous and might mean a long delay we got our paddles out and were soon 20\nback in British waters.\nI had a curious experience one morning. A large ribbon-shaped fish,\nabout 3 or 4 feet long, came up and swam upon the surface near the ship.\nHaving my gun handy, I shot it. I don\u2019t think five seconds could have\nelapsed before another larger and thicker fish \u2013 a big catfish, I should 25\nsay \u2013 darted up from the depths, seized the wounded fish by the middle,\nand dragged it down. So murderous is the food-search, and so keen the\nwatch in Nature! I saw something similar in the mixed tank of an aquar-\nium once, where a fish stunned himself by swimming against the glass\nfront, and was instantly seized and devoured by his neighbour. A strange 30\nfish to which I was introduced at Calabar was the electrical torpedo fish.\nIt is handed to you in an earthenware saucer \u2013 a quiet little drab creature\nabout 5 inches long \u2013 and you are asked to tickle its back. Then you learn\nexactly how high you can jump.\nThe death-like impression of Africa grew upon me. One felt that the 35\nwhite man with his present diet and habits was an intruder who was nev-\ner meant to be there, and that the great sullen brown continent killed him\nas one crushes nits. I find in my diary:\n43 the voyage to west africa\n\u2018Oh Africa, where are the charms\nThat sages have seen in thy face?\nBetter dwell in Old England on alms\n5 Than be rich in that terrible place.\u2019\nThe life aboard ship, however, was an easy and, in some ways, a lux-\nurious one \u2013 too luxurious for a young man who had his way to make\nin the world. Premature comfort is a deadly enervating thing. I remem-\n10 ber considering my own future \u2013 I stood upon the poop with a raging\nthunderstorm around me \u2013 and seeing very clearly that one or two more\nsuch voyages would sap my simple habits and make me unfit for the hard\nstruggle which any sort of success would need. The idea of success in\nliterature had never crossed my mind. It was still of medicine only that I\n15 thought, but I knew by my Birmingham experience how long and rough\na path it was for those who had no influence and could not afford to buy.\nThen and there I vowed that I would wander no more, and that was surely\none of the turning-points of my life. A \u2018Wander-Jahr\u2019 is good, but two\n\u2018Wander-Jahre\u2019 may mean damnation \u2013 and it is hard to stop. I find that\n20 on the same day of fruitful meditation I swore off alcohol for the rest of\nthe voyage. I drank quite freely at this period of my life, having a head\nand a constitution which made me fairly immune, but my reason told me\nthat the unbounded cocktails of West Africa were a danger, and with an\neffort I cut them out. There is a certain subtle pleasure in abstinence, and\n25 it is only socially that it is difficult. If we were all abstainers as a matter of\ncourse, like the real Mahomedans, none of us would ever miss it.\nI did a mad thing at Cape Coast Castle, for, in a spirit either of brava-\ndo or pure folly, I swam round the ship \u2013 or at least for some length along\nher and back again. I suppose it was the consideration that black folk go\n30 freely into the water which induced me to do it. For some reason white\nfolk do not share the same immunity. As I was drying myself on deck I\nsaw the triangular black fin of a shark rise to the surface. Several times in\nmy life I have done utterly reckless things with so little motive that I have\nfound it difficult to explain them to myself afterwards. This was one of\n35 them.\nThe most intelligent and well-read man whom I met on the Coast\nwas a negro, the American Consul at Monrovia. He came on with us as\na passenger. My starved literary side was eager for good talk, and it was\n44 chapter 5\nwonderful to sit on deck discussing Bancroft and Motley, and then sud-\ndenly realize that you were talking to one who had possibly been a slave\nhimself, and was certainly the son of slaves. He had thought a good deal\nabout African travel. \u2018The only way to explore Africa is to go without\narms and with few servants. You would not like it in England if a body of 5\nmen came armed to the teeth and marched through your land. The Af-\nricans are quite as sensitive.\u2019 It was the method of Livingstone as against\nthe method of Stanley. The former takes the braver and better man.\nThis negro gentleman did me good, for a man\u2019s brain is an organ for\nthe formation of his own thoughts and also for the digestion of other 10\npeople\u2019s, and it needs fresh fodder. We had, of course, books aboard the\nship, but neither many nor good. I cannot trace that I made any men-\ntal or spiritual advancement during the voyage, but I added one more\nexperience to my chaplet, and I suppose it all goes to some ultimate re-\nsult in character or personality. I was a strong full-blooded young man, 15\nfull of the joy of life, with nothing of what Oliver Wendell Holmes calls\n\u2018pathological piety and tuberculous virtues.\u2019 I was a man among men. I\nwalked ever among pitfalls and I thank all ministering angels that I came\nthrough, while I have a softened heart for those who did not.\nOur voyage home \u2013 oil-gathering from port to port on the same but 20\nreversed route \u2013 was uneventful until the very last stride, when just as\nwe were past Madeira the ship took fire. Whether it was the combustion\nof coal dust has never been determined, but certainly the fire broke out\nin the bunkers, and as there was only a wooden partition between these\nbunkers and a cargo of oil, we were in deadly danger. For the first day 25\nwe took it lightly, as a mere smoulder, and for a second and third day we\nwere content to seal the gratings as far as possible, to play down on it with\nthe hose, and to shift the coal away from the oil. On the fourth morning,\nhowever, things took a sudden turn for the worse. I copy from my log\nbook: 30\n\u2018January 9. I was awakened early in the morning by the purser, Tom\nKing, poking his head in at my door and informing me that the ship was\nin a blaze, and that all hands had been called and were working down be-\nlow. I got my clothes on, but when I came on deck nothing was to be seen\nof it save thick volumes of smoke from the bunker ventilators, and a lurid 35\nglow down below. I offered to go down, but there seemed to be as many\nworking as could be fitted in. I was then asked to call the passengers. I\nwaked each in turn, and they all faced the situation very bravely and cool-\n45 the voyage to west africa\nly. One, a Swiss, sat up in his bunk, rubbed his eyes, and in answer to my\nremark: \u201cThe ship is on fire!\u201d said: \u201cI have often been on ships that were\non fire.\u201d \u201cSplendide mendax\u201d \u2013 but a good spirit! All day we fought the\nflames, and the iron side of the ship was red-hot at one point. Boats were\n5 prepared and provisioned and no doubt at the worst we could row or sail\nthem to Lisbon, where my dear sisters, now bravely governessing there,\nwould be considerably surprised if their big brother walked in. However,\nwe are getting the better of it, and by evening those ominous pillars of\nsmoke were down to mere wisps. So ends an ugly business!\u2019\n10 On January 14 we were in Liverpool once more, and West Africa was\nbut one more of the cinema reels of memory. It is, I am told, very much\nimproved now in all things. My old friend and cricket companion, Sir\nFred. Guggisberg, has been Governor at Accra and asked me to see the\nold ground under very different auspices. I wish I could, but the sands\n15 still ran and there was much to be done.\n46 Chapter 6\nMY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN PRACTICE\nA Strange Character \u2013 His Honeymoon \u2013 His Bristol Practice \u2013 Telegram 5\nfrom Plymouth \u2013 Six Amusing Weeks \u2013 A Deep Plot \u2013 My Southsea Venture\n\u2013 Furnishing on the Cheap \u2013 The Plot Explodes.\nI have now come to the temporary end of my voyages, which were to\nbe renewed in years to come, and I have reached the time when, under 10\nvery curious circumstances, I endeavoured to establish myself in medical\npractice. In a book written some years afterwards called The Stark Munro\nLetters, I drew in very close detail the events of the next few years, and\nthere the curious reader will find them more clearly and fully set out than\nwould be to scale in these pages. I would only remark, should any reader 15\nreconstruct me or my career from that book, that there are some few inci-\ndents there which are imaginary, and that, especially, the whole incident\nof the case of a lunatic and of Lord Saltire in Chapter IV occurred to a\nfriend and not to myself. Otherwise the whole history of my association\nwith the man whom I called Cullingworth, his extraordinary character, 20\nour parting and the way in which I was left to what seemed certain ruin,\nwere all as depicted. I will here simply give the essentials of the story.\nIn my last year of study at Edinburgh I formed a friendship with a\nremarkable student named George Budd. He came of a famous medical\nfamily, his father having been a great authority upon zymotic disease. He 25\ncame also of a famous athletic stock, and was a great Rugby forward him-\nself, though rather handicapped by the Berserk fury with which he would\nplay. He was up to international form, and his younger brother, Arthur\nBudd, was reckoned by good judges to be about the best forward who\never donned the rose-embroidered jersey of England. 30\nBudd was as strong mentally as physically. In person he was about 5\nft. 9 in. in height, perfectly built, with a bulldog jaw, bloodshot deep-set\neyes, overhanging brows, and yellowish hair as stiff as wire, which spurt-\ned up above his brows. He was a man born for trouble and adventure,\nunconventional in his designs and formidable in his powers of execution 35\n\u2013 a man of action with a big but incalculable brain guiding the action. He\ndied in early middle age, and I understand that an autopsy revealed some\ncerebral abnormality, so that there was no doubt a pathological element\n47 my first experience in practice\nin his strange explosive character. For some reason he took a fancy to me,\nand appeared to attach an undue importance to my advice.\nWhen I met him first he had just indulged in one of his wild esca-\npades, which ended usually in a fight or in a transitory appearance in a\n5 police court, but on this occasion was more serious and permanent. He\nhad run off with a charming young lady and married her, she being a\nward in Chancery and under age. However, the deed was done and all\nthe lawyers in the world could not undo it, though they might punish\nthe culprit. He told me how he and the lady had gone over a Bradshaw\n10 with the intention that when they came on a station of which neither of\nthem had ever heard, they would make for that place and spend their\nhoneymoon there. They came therefore upon some awful name, Clod-\npole-in-the-Marsh or something of the kind, and there they sojourned\nin the village inn. Budd stained his yellow hair black, but the stain took\n15 in some places and not in others, so that he looked as if he had escaped\nfrom Barnum\u2019s show. What Clodpole-in-the-Marsh could have thought\nof such an extraordinary couple I cannot imagine, and it is probably the\none occasion on which it ever buzzed. I cannot think of any surer way\nof getting publicity than that which Budd took to avoid detection. In\n20 London they would have been perfectly unobserved. I remember that\nfor years Budd\u2019s hair presented curious iridescent tints which were the\nremains of his disguise.\nHe brought his bride safely to Edinburgh, where they hired a flat and\nlived in it without furnishing it save for the absolutely needful. I have\n25 dined with them there on an apple dumpling, seated on a pile of thick\nvolumes as there was no chair. We introduced them to a few friends, did\nwhat we could for the lonely lady, and finally they drifted off, and for a\ntime we heard no more.\nJust before I started for Africa I got a long telegram from Budd im-\n30 ploring me to go to Bristol as he needed my advice. I was in Birming-\nham and I set forth at once. When I reached Bristol he conducted me\nto a fine mansion, and there poured out his tale of woe. He had started\nin great style, hoping to rally the remains of his father\u2019s patients, but his\nmoney had run out, he was dunned by his tradespeople, there were no\n35 patients, and what was he to do? We had a joyous riotous time for two\ndays, for there was an exuberant atmosphere about the man which rose\nabove all trouble. The only advice I could give was that he should make\na composition with his creditors. I heard afterwards that he assembled\n48 chapter 6\nthem, addressed them in a long and emotional speech, reduced them al-\nmost to tears with his picture of the struggles of a deserving young man,\nand finally got a unanimous vote of confidence from them with full con-\nsent that he should pay at his own leisure. It was the sort of thing that he\nwould do, and tell the story afterwards with a bull\u2019s roar of laughter which 5\ncould be heard down the street.\nWhen I had been back a couple of months from Africa, I received\nanother telegram \u2013 he always telegraphed and never wrote \u2013 which ran\nin some such way as this: \u2018Started here last June. Colossal success. Come\ndown by next train if possible. Plenty of room for you. Splendid open- 10\ning.\u2019 The telegram was stamped Plymouth. A second even more explosive\ntelegram upbraided me for delay and guaranteed me \u00a3300 the first year.\nThis looked like business, so off I went.\nThe events of the next six weeks, in the late spring and early summer\nof 1882, were more fitted for some rollicking novel than for the sober 15\npages of a veracious chronicle. The conditions which I found at Plym-\nouth were incredible. In a short time this man, half genius and half quack,\nhad founded a practice worth several thousand pounds of ready money\nin the year. \u2018Free consultations but pay for your medicine,\u2019 was his slo-\ngan, and as he charged a good price for the latter it worked out all the 20\nsame in the end. The mere words \u2018Free Consultations\u2019 attracted crowds.\nHe used drugs in a heroic and indiscriminate manner which produced\ndramatic results but at an unjustifiable risk. I remember one instance\nwhere dropsy had disappeared before a severe dose of croton oil in a way\nthat set all the gossips talking. People flocked into the town from 20 and 25\n30 miles round, and not only his waiting-rooms, but his stairs and his\npassages, were crammed. His behaviour to them was extraordinary. He\nroared and shouted, scolded them, joked them, pushed them about, and\npursued them sometimes into the street, or addressed them collectively\nfrom the landing. A morning with him when the practice was in full blast 30\nwas as funny as any pantomime and I was exhausted with laughter. He\nhad a well-worn volume on Medical Jurisprudence which he pretend-\ned was the Bible, and he swore old women on it that they would drink\nno more tea. I have no doubt he did a great deal of good, for there was\nreason and knowledge behind all that he did, but his manner of doing it 35\nwas unorthodox in the extreme. His wife made up the prescriptions at\na pigeon-hole at the end of a passage, and received the price which was\nmarked on the label carried down by the patient. Every evening Budd\n49 my first experience in practice\nwalked back to his great residential house upon the Hoe, bearing his bag\nof silver, his coat flying, his hat on the back of his head, and his great fangs\ngrinning up at every doctor whose disgusted face showed at a window.\nBudd had rigged me up a room, furnished with one table and two\n5 chairs, in which I could take surgical or other cases which he did not care\nto handle. I fear that my professional manners were very unexciting after\nhis more flamboyant efforts, which I could not imitate even if I would.\nI had, however, a steady dribble of patients, and it looked as if I might\nbuild something up. I went up country once, and operated upon an old\n10 fellow\u2019s nose which had contracted cancer through his holding the bowl\nof a short clay pipe immediately beneath it. I left him with an aristocratic,\nnot to say supercilious organ, which was the wonder of the village, and\nmight have been the foundation of my fame.\nBut there were other influences at work, and the threads of fate were\n15 shooting out at strange unexpected angles. My mother had greatly re-\nsented my association with Budd. Her family pride had been aroused,\nand justly as I can now see, though my wanderings had left me rather\ntoo Bohemian and careless upon points of etiquette. But I liked Budd \u2013\neven now I can\u2019t help liking him \u2013 and I admired his strong qualities and\n20 enjoyed his company and the extraordinary situations which arose from\nany association with him. This resistance upon my part, and my defence\nof my friend, annoyed my mother the more, and she wrote me several\nletters of remonstrance which certainly dealt rather faithfully with his\ncharacter as it appeared to her. I was careless of my papers and these let-\n25 ters were read both by Budd and his wife. I do them no injustice in saying\nthis, for they finally admitted it. Apparently he imagined \u2013 he was a man\nof strange suspicions and secret plottings \u2013 that I was a party to such sen-\ntiments, whereas they were actually called forth by my defence of him.\nHis manner changed, and more than once I caught his fierce grey eyes\n30 looking furtively at me with a strange sullen expression, so much so that I\nasked him what was the matter. He was actually scheming my ruin, which\nwould be nothing financially, since I had nothing to lose, but would be\nmuch both to my mother and me if it touched on my honour.\nOne day he came to me and told me that he thought my presence\n35 complicated his practice and that we had better part. I agreed in all good\nhumour, assuring him that I had not come to hurt him and that I was very\ngrateful for what he had done, even if it came to nothing. He then strong-\nly advised me to go into practice myself. I replied that I had no capital.\n50 chapter 6\nHe answered that he would see to that, that he would allow me a pound\na week until I got my feet under me, and that I could repay it at leisure. I\nthanked him warmly, and after looking at Tavistock I finally decided that\nPortsmouth would be a good place, the only reason being that I knew the\nconditions at Plymouth, and Portsmouth seemed analogous. I boarded 5\nan Irish steamer, therefore, and about July of 1882 I started off by sea,\nwith one small trunk containing all my earthly possessions, to start prac-\ntice in a town in which I knew no single soul. My cash balance was under\n\u00a310, and I knew not only that I had to meet all present expenses upon\nthis, but that I had to furnish a house upon it. On the other hand the 10\nweekly pound should easily cover all personal needs, and I had the devil-\nmay-care optimism of youth as to the future.\nWhen I arrived at Portsmouth I went into lodgings for a week. On\nthe very first night, with that curious faculty for running into curious sit-\nuations which has always been with me, I became involved in a street 15\nfight with a rough who was beating (or rather kicking) a woman. It was\na strange start, and after I began my practice one of the first people to\nwhom I opened my door was this very rascal. I don\u2019t suppose he recog-\nnized me, but I could have sworn to him. I emerged from the fray without\nmuch damage, and was very glad to escape some serious scandal. It was 20\nthe second time that I had got knocked about in defence of beauty in\ndistress.\nI spent a week in marking down the unoccupied houses, and finally\nsettled at \u00a340 a year into Bush Villa, which a kindly landlord has now\ncalled Doyle House. I was terrified lest the agent should ask for a deposit, 25\nbut the name of my C.B. uncle as reference turned the scale in my favour.\nHaving secured the empty house and its key, I went down to a sale in\nPortsea and for about \u00a34 secured quite a lot of second-hand \u2013 possibly\ntenth-hand \u2013 furniture. It met my needs and enabled me to make one\nroom possible for patients with three chairs, a table and a central patch 30\nof carpet. I had a bed of sorts and a mattress upstairs. I fixed up the plate\nwhich I had brought from Plymouth, bought a red lamp on tick, and fair-\nly settled down in receipt of custom. When all was done I had a couple\nof pounds in hand. Servants, of course, were out of the question, so I\npolished my own plate every morning, brushed down my front, and kept 35\nthe house reasonably clean. I found that I could live quite easily and well\non less than a shilling a day, so I could hold out for a long period.\nI had at this time contributed several stories to London Society, a mag-\n51 my first experience in practice\nazine now defunct, but then flourishing under the editorship of a Mr.\nHogg. In the April, 1882, number I had a story, now happily forgotten,\ncalled \u2018Bones,\u2019 while in the preceding Christmas number I had another,\n\u2018The Gully of Bluemansdyke,\u2019 both of them feeble echoes of Bret Harte.\n5 These, with the stories already mentioned, made up my whole output at\nthis time. I explained to Mr. Hogg how I was situated, and wrote for him\na new tale for his Christmas number entitled \u2018My Friend the Murderer.\u2019\nHogg behaved very well and sent me \u00a310, which I laid by for my first\nquarter\u2019s rent. I was not so pleased with him when, years later, he claimed\n10 the full copyright of all these immature stories, and published them in a\nvolume with my name attached. Have a care, young authors, have a care,\nor your worst enemy will be your early self!\nIt was as well that I had that \u00a310, for Budd, having learned that I was\nfairly committed, with my lease signed, now hurled his thunderbolt,\n15 which he thought would crush me. It was a curt letter \u2013 not a telegram\nfor a wonder \u2013 in which he admitted that my letters had been read, ex-\npressed surprise that such a correspondence should have gone on while\nI was under his roof, and declared that he could have nothing more to do\nwith me. He had, of course, no real grievance, but I am quite willing to\n20 admit that he honestly thought he had. But his method of revenge was a\nstrange example of the schemings of a morbid mind.\nFor a moment I was staggered. But my boats were burned and I must\ngo forward. I sent back a derisive reply to Budd, and put him out of my\nhead for ever \u2013 indeed, I heard of him no more until some five years later\n25 I read the news of his premature death. He was a remarkable man and\nnarrowly escaped being a great one. I fear that he lived up to his great\nincome and left his wife but poorly off.\n52 Chapter 7\nMY START AT SOUTHSEA\nA Strange Life \u2013 Arrival of my Brother \u2013 I Buy up a Shop \u2013 Cheap Servants 5\n\u2013 Queer Patients \u2013 Dangers of Medical Practice \u2013 Income Tax Joke \u2013 My\nMarriage \u2013 Tragedy in my House \u2013 A New Phase.\nWhat with cleaning up, answering the bell, doing my modest shop-\nping, which was measured in pennies rather than shillings, and perfect- 10\ning my simple household arrangements, the time did not hang heavily\nupon my hands. It is a wonderful thing to have a house of your own for\nthe first time, however humble it may be. I lavished all my care upon the\nfront room to make it possible for patients. The back room was furnished\nwith my trunk and a stool. Inside the trunk was my larder, and the top of 15\nit was my dining-room table. There was gas laid on, and I rigged a projec-\ntion from the wall by which I could sling a pan over the gas jet. In this way\nI cooked bacon with great ease, and became expert in getting a wonder-\nful lot of slices from a pound. Bread, bacon and tea, with an occasional\nsaveloy \u2013 what could man ask for more? It is (or was) perfectly easy to 20\nlive well upon a shilling a day.\nI had obtained a fair consignment of drugs on tick from a whole-\nsale house and these also were ranged round the sides of the back room.\nFrom the very beginning a few stray patients of the poorest class, some of\nthem desirous of novelty, some disgruntled with their own doctors, the 25\ngreater part owing bills and ashamed to face their creditor, came to con-\nsult me and consume a bottle of my medicine. I could pay for my food by\nthe drugs I sold. It was as well, for I had no other way of paying for it, and\nI had sworn not to touch the ten golden pieces which represented my\nrent. There have been times when I could not buy a postage stamp and 30\nmy letters have had to wait, but the ten golden coins still remained intact.\nIt was a busy thoroughfare, with a church on one side of my house\nand an hotel on the other. The days passed pleasantly enough, for it was\na lovely warm autumn, and I sat in the window of my consulting-room\nscreened by the rather dingy curtain which I had put up, and watched the 35\npassing crowd or read my book, for I had spent part of my scanty funds\non making myself a member of a circulating library. In spite of my sparse\nfood, or more probably on account of it, I was extraordinarily fit and well,\n53 my start at southsea\nso that at night when all hope of patients was gone for that day I would\nlock up my house and walk many miles to work off my energy. With its\nimperial associations it is a glorious place and even now if I had to live in\na town outside London it is surely to Southsea, the residential quarter of\n5 Portsmouth, that I would turn. The history of the past carries on into the\nhistory of to-day, the new torpedo-boat flies past the old Victory with the\nsame white ensign flying from each, and the old Elizabethan culverins\nand sakers can still be seen in the same walk which brings you to the huge\nartillery of the forts. There is a great glamour there to anyone with the\n10 historic sense \u2013 a sense which I drank in with my mother\u2019s milk.\nIt had never entered my head yet that literature might give me a ca-\nreer, or anything beyond a little casual pocket money, but already it was\na deciding factor in my life, for I could not have held on, and must have\neither starved or given in but for the few pounds which Mr. Hogg sent\n15 me, for they enabled all other smaller sums to be spent in nourishment.\nI have wondered sometimes as I look back that I did not contract scurvy,\nfor most of my food was potted, and I had no means of cooking vegeta-\nbles. However, I felt no grievance at the time nor any particular percep-\ntion that my mode of life was unusual, nor indeed any particular anxiety\n20 about the future. At that age everything seems an adventure \u2013 and there\nwas always the novel pleasure of the house.\nOnce I had a moment of weakness during which I answered an ad-\nvertisement which asked for a doctor to attend coolies in the tea gardens\nof the Terai. I spent a few unsettled days waiting for an answer, but none\n25 came and I settled down once more to my waiting and hoping. I had one\navenue of success open of which I could not avail myself. My Catholic\nrelatives had sent me introductions to the Bishop and I was assured that\nthere was no Catholic doctor in the town. My mind, however, was so\nperfectly clear and I had so entirely broken away from the old faith that I\n30 could not possibly use it for material ends. I therefore burned the letter\nof introduction.\nAs the weeks passed and I had no one with whom to talk I began\nto think wistfully of the home circle at Edinburgh, and to wonder why,\nwith my eight-roomed house, one or more of them should not come to\n35 keep me company. The girls were already governessing or preparing to\ndo so, but there was my little brother Innes. It would relieve my mother\nand yet help me if he could join me. So it was arranged, and one happy\nevening the little knicker-bockered fellow, just ten years old, joined me\n54 chapter 7\nas my comrade. No man could have had a merrier and brighter one. In a\nfew weeks we had settled down to a routine life, I having found a good\nday-school for him. The soldiers of Portsmouth were already a great joy\nto him, and his future career was marked out by his natural tastes, for he\nwas a born leader and administrator. Little did I foresee that he would 5\nwin distinction in the greatest of all wars, and die in the prime of his man-\nhood \u2013 but not before he knew that complete victory had been attained.\nEven then our thoughts were very military, and I remember how we wait-\ned together outside the office of the local paper that we might learn the\nresult of the bombardment of Alexandria. 10\nTurning over some old papers after these pages were written I came\nupon a letter written in straggling schoolboy script by my little brother to\nhis mother at home which may throw an independent light upon those\ncurious days. It is dated August 16, 1882. He says:\n\u2018The patients are crowding in. We have made three bob this week. 15\nWe have vaxenated a baby and got hold of a man with consumtion, and\nto-day a gipsy\u2019s cart came up to the door selling baskets and chairs so we\ndetermined not to let the man ring as long as he liked. After he had rong\ntwo or three times Arthur yelled out at the pitch of his voice, Go a way\nbut the man rang again so I went down to the door and pulled open the 20\nletter box and cried out go a way. The man began to swere at me and say\nthat he wanted to see Arthur. All this time Arthur thorght that the door\nwas open and was yelling Shut that door. Then I came upstairs and told\nArthur what the man had said so Arthur went down and opened the door\nand we found out that the gipsy\u2019s child had measles . . . After all we got 25\nsixpence out of them and that is all ways something.\u2019\nI remember the incident well, and certainly my sudden change of\ntone from the indignant householder, who is worried by a tramp, to my\nbest bedside manner in the hopes of a fee, must have been very amusing.\nMy recollection is, however, that it was the Gipsy who got sixpence out 30\nof us.\nFor some time Innes and I lived entirely alone, doing the household\ntasks between us, and going long walks in the evening to keep ourselves\nfit. Then I had a brain-wave and I put an advertisement in the evening\npaper that a ground floor was to let in exchange for services. I had numer- 35\nous applicants in reply, and out of them I chose two elderly women who\nclaimed to be sisters \u2013 a claim which they afterwards failed to make good.\nWhen once they were installed we became quite a civilized household\n55 my start at southsea\nand things began to look better. There were complex quarrels, however,\nand one of the women left. The other soon afterwards followed suit. As\nthe first woman had seemed to me to be the most efficient, I followed her\nup and found that she had started a small shop. Her rent was weekly, so\n5 that was easily settled, but she talked gloomily about her stock. \u2018I will buy\neverything in your shop,\u2019 I said in a large way. It cost me exactly seventeen\nand sixpence, and I was loaded up for many months with matches, cakes\nof blacking and other merchandise. From then onwards our meals were\ncooked for us, and we became in all ways normal.\n10 Month followed month and I picked up a patient here and a patient\nthere until the nucleus of a little practice had been formed. Sometimes it\nwas an accident, sometimes an emergency case, sometimes a newcomer\nto the town or one who had quarrelled with his doctor. I mixed with peo-\nple so far as I could, for I learned that a brass plate alone will never attract,\n15 and people must see the human being who lies in wait behind it. Some\nof my tradespeople gave me their custom in return for mine, and mine\nwas so small that I was likely to have the best of the bargain. There was\na grocer who developed epileptic fits, which meant butter and tea to us.\nPoor fellow, he could never have realized the mixed feelings with which\n20 I received the news of a fresh outbreak. Then there was a very tall, horse-\nfaced old lady with an extraordinary dignity of bearing. She would sit\nframed in the window of her little house, like a picture of a grande dame\nof the old r\u00e9gime. But every now and again she went on a wild burst,\nin the course of which she would skim plates out of the window at the\n25 passers-by. I was the only one who had influence over her at such times,\nfor she was a haughty, autocratic old person. Once she showed an incli-\nnation to skim a plate at me also, but I quelled her by assuming a gloomy\ndignity as portentous as her own. She had some art treasures which she\nheaped upon me when she was what we will politely call \u2018ill,\u2019 but claimed\n30 back again the moment she was well. Once when she had been particu-\nlarly troublesome I retained a fine lava jug, in spite of her protests, and I\nhave got it yet.\nIt is well that medical practice has its humorous side, for it has much\nto depress one. Most men never use their reasoning power at all on the\n35 religious side, but if they did they would find it difficult sometimes to\nreconcile the sights which a physician sees with a merciful providence. If\none loses the explanation that this life is a spiritual chastening for anoth-\ner, and thinks that death ends all, and that this is our one experience, then\n56 chapter 7\nit is impossible to sustain the goodness or the omnipotence of God. So I\nfelt at the time, and it made me a Materialist, but now I know well that I\nwas judging a story on the strength of one chapter.\nLet me give an example. I was called in by a poor woman to see her\ndaughter. As I entered the humble sitting-room there was a small cot at 5\none side, and by the gesture of the mother I understood that the sufferer\nwas there. I picked up a candle and walking over I stooped over the little\nbed, expecting to see a child. What I really saw was a pair of brown sullen\neyes, full of loathing and pain, which looked up in resentment to mine.\nI could not tell how old the creature was. Long thin limbs were twisted 10\nand coiled in the tiny couch. The face was sane but malignant. \u2018What is\nit?\u2019 I asked in dismay when we were out of hearing. \u2018It\u2019s a girl,\u2019 sobbed the\nmother. \u2018She\u2019s nineteen. Oh! if God would only take her!\u2019 What a life for\nboth! And how hard to face such facts and accept any of the common-\nplace explanations of existence! 15\nMedical life is full of dangers and pitfalls, and luck must always play\nits part in a man\u2019s career. Many a good man has been ruined by pure bad\nluck. On one occasion I was called in to a lady who was suffering from\nwhat appeared to be dyspepsia of a rather severe type. There was abso-\nlutely nothing to indicate anything more serious. I therefore reassured 20\nthe family, spoke lightly of the illness, and walked home to make up a\nbismuth mixture for her, calling on one or two other cases on the way.\nWhen I got home I found a messenger waiting to say that the lady was\ndead. This is the sort of thing which may happen to any man at any time.\nIt did not hurt me, for I was too lowly to be hurt. You can\u2019t ruin a practice 25\nwhen there is no practice. The woman really had a gastric ulcer, for which\nthere is no diagnosis; it was eating its way into the lining of her stomach,\nit pierced an artery after I saw her, and she bled to death. Nothing could\nhave saved her, and I think her relatives came to understand this.\nI made \u00a3154 the first year, and \u00a3250 the second, rising slowly to \u00a3800, 30\nwhich in eight years I never passed, so far as the medical practice went.\nIn the first year the Income Tax paper arrived and I filled it up to show\nthat I was not liable. They returned the paper with \u2018Most unsatisfactory\u2019\nscrawled across it. I wrote \u2018I entirely agree\u2019 under the words, and returned\nit once more. For this little bit of cheek I was had up before the assessors, 35\nand duly appeared with my ledger under my arm. They could make noth-\ning, however, out of me or my ledger, and we parted with mutual laughter\nand compliments.\n57 my start at southsea\nIn the year 1885 my brother left me to go to a public school in York-\nshire. Shortly afterwards I was married. A lady named Mrs. Hawkins, a\nwidow of a Gloucestershire family, had come to Southsea with her son\nand daughter, the latter a very gentle and amiable girl. I was brought into\n5 contact with them through the illness of the son, which was of a sud-\nden and violent nature, arising from cerebral meningitis. As the mother\nwas very awkwardly situated in lodgings, I volunteered to furnish an ex-\ntra bedroom in my house and give the poor lad, who was in the utmost\ndanger, my personal attention. His case was a mortal one, and in spite\n10 of all I could do he passed away a few days later. Such a death under my\nown roof naturally involved me in a good deal of anxiety and trouble \u2013\nindeed, if I had not had the foresight to ask a medical friend to see him\nwith me on the day before he passed away, I should have been in a dif-\nficult position. The funeral was from my house. The family were natu-\n15 rally grieved at the worry to which they had quite innocently exposed\nme, and so our relations became intimate and sympathetic, which ended\nin the daughter consenting to share my fortunes. We were married on\nAugust 6, 1885, and no man could have had a more gentle and amiable\nlife\u2019s companion. Our union was marred by the sad ailment which came\n20 after a very few years to cast its shadow over our lives, but it comforts me\nto think that during the time when we were together there was no single\noccasion when our affection was disturbed by any serious breach or di-\nvision, the credit of which lies entirely with her own quiet philosophy,\nwhich enabled her to bear with smiling patience not only her own sad\n25 illness, which lasted so long, but all those other vicissitudes which life\nbrings with it. I rejoice to think that though she married a penniless doc-\ntor, she was spared long enough to fully appreciate the pleasure and the\nmaterial comforts which worldly success was able to bring us. She had\nsome small income of her own which enabled me to expand my simple\n30 housekeeping in a way which gave her from the first the decencies, if not\nthe luxuries, of life.\nIn many ways my marriage marked a turning-point in my life. A bach-\nelor, especially one who had been a wanderer like myself, drifts easily\ninto Bohemian habits, and I was no exception. I cannot look back upon\n35 those years with any spiritual satisfaction, for I was still in the valley of\ndarkness. I had ceased to butt my head incessantly against what seemed\nto be an impenetrable wall, and I had resigned myself to ignorance upon\nthat which is the most momentous question in life \u2013 for a voyage is bleak\n58 chapter 7\nindeed if one has no conception to what port one is bound. I had laid\naside the old charts as useless, and had quite despaired of ever finding\na new one which would enable me to steer an intelligible course, save\ntowards that mist which was all that my pilots, Huxley, Mill, Spencer and\nothers, could see ahead of us. My mental attitude is correctly portrayed 5\nin The Stark Munro Letters. A dim light of dawn was to come to me soon\nin an uncertain fitful way which was destined in time to spread and grow\nbrighter.\nUp to now the main interest in my life lay in my medical career. But\nwith the more regular life and the greater sense of responsibility, coupled 10\nwith the natural development of brain-power, the literary side of me be-\ngan slowly to spread until it was destined to push the other entirely aside.\nThus a new phase had begun, part medical, part literary, and part philo-\nsophical, which I shall deal with in another chapter.\nAt the time it was very dark. But I was mentally honest and there is 15\nalways hope if one is that. I remember trying to draw up a prayer which I\ncould really say with truth. A critic who read it said, \u2018This is not a prayer.\nIt is a legal document.\u2019\n59 Chapter 8\nMY FIRST LITERARY SUCCESS\n5 New Outlook \u2013 Cornhill Dinner \u2013 James Payn \u2013 A Study in Scarlet \u2013 Genesis\nof Holmes \u2013 Micah Clarke \u2013 Disappointments \u2013 Andrew Lang \u2013 Oscar Wilde\n\u2013 His Criticism of Himself \u2013 The White Company.\nDuring the years before my marriage I had from time to time writ-\n10 ten short stories which were good enough to be marketable at very small\nprices \u2013 \u00a34 on an average \u2013 but not good enough to reproduce. They\nare scattered about amid the pages of London Society, All the Year Round,\nTemple Bar, The Boy\u2019s Own Paper, and other journals. There let them lie.\nThey served their purpose in relieving me a little of that financial bur-\n15 den which always pressed upon me. I can hardly have earned more than\n\u00a310 or \u00a315 a year from this source, so that the idea of making a living by\nit never occurred to me. But though I was not putting out I was taking\nin. I still have notebooks full of all sorts of knowledge which I acquired\nduring that time. It is a great mistake to start putting out cargo when you\n20 have hardly stowed any on board. My own slow methods and natural lim-\nitations made me escape this danger.\nAfter my marriage, however, my brain seems to have quickened and\nboth my imagination and my range of expression were greatly improved.\nMost of the short stories which appeared eventually in my Captain of the\n25 Polestar were written in those years from 1885 to 1890. Some of them are\nperhaps as good honest work as any that I have done. What gave me great\npleasure and for the first time made me realize that I was ceasing to be a\nhack writer and was getting into good company was when James Payn ac-\ncepted my short story \u2018Habakuk Jephson\u2019s Statement\u2019 for Cornhill. I had\n30 a reverence for this splendid magazine with its traditions from Thackeray\nto Stevenson and the thought that I had won my way into it pleased me\neven more than the cheque for \u00a330, which came duly to hand. The tale\nwas, of course, anonymous \u2013 such was the law of the magazine \u2013 which\nprotects the author from abuse as well as prevents his winning fame. One\n35 paper began its review by the phrase \u2018Cornhill opens its new number with\na story which would have made Thackeray turn in his grave.\u2019 A dear old\ngentleman who knew me hurried across the road to show me the paper\nwith these cheering words. Another, more gracious, said, \u2018Cornhill be-\n60 chapter 8\ngins the New Year with an exceedingly powerful story in which we seem\nto trace the hand of the author of The New Arabian Nights.\u2019 It was great\npraise, but something less warm, which came straight to my own address,\nwould have pleased me better.\nI soon had two other stories in the Cornhill \u2013 \u2018John Huxford\u2019s Hia- 5\ntus\u2019 and \u2018The Ring of Thoth.\u2019 I also penetrated the stout Scottish barrier\nof Blackwood with a story, \u2018The Physiologist\u2019s Wife,\u2019 which was written\nwhen I was under the influence of Henry James. But I was still in the days\nof very small things \u2013 so small that when a paper sent me a woodcut and\noffered me four guineas if I would write a story to correspond I was not 10\ntoo proud to accept. It was a very bad woodcut and I think that the story\ncorresponded all right. I remember writing a New Zealand story, though\nwhy I should have written about a place of which I knew nothing I cannot\nimagine. Some New Zealand critic pointed out that I had given the exact\nbearings of the farm mentioned as 90 miles to the east or west of the 15\ntown of Nelson, and that in that case it was situated 20 miles out on the\nfloor of the Pacific Ocean. These little things will happen. There are times\nwhen accuracy is necessary and others where the idea is everything and\nthe place quite immaterial.\nIt was about a year after my marriage that I realized that I could go on 20\ndoing short stories for ever and never make headway. What is necessary\nis that your name should be on the back of a volume. Only so do you as-\nsert your individuality, and get the full credit or discredit of your achieve-\nment. I had for some time from 1884 onwards been engaged upon a sen-\nsational book of adventure which I had called The Firm of Girdlestone, 25\nwhich represented my first attempt at a connected narrative. Save for\noccasional patches it is a worthless book, and, like the first book of every-\none else, unless he is a great original genius, it was too reminiscent of\nthe work of others. I could see it then, and could see it even more clearly\nlater. When I sent it to publishers and they scorned it I quite acquiesced 30\nin their decision and finally let it settle, after its periodical flights to town,\na dishevelled mass of manuscript at the back of a drawer.\nI felt now that I was capable of something fresher and crisper and\nmore workmanlike. Gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dove-\ntailing of his plots, and Poe\u2019s masterful detective, M. Dupin, had from 35\nboyhood been one of my heroes. But could I bring an addition of my\nown? I thought of my old teacher Joe Bell, of his eagle face, of his curious\nways, of his eerie trick of spotting details. If he were a detective he would\n61 my first literary success\nsurely reduce this fascinating but unorganized business to something\nnearer to an exact science. I would try if I could get this effect. It was\nsurely possible in real life, so why should I not make it plausible in fic-\ntion? It is all very well to say that a man is clever, but the reader wants to\n5 see examples of it \u2013 such examples as Bell gave us every day in the wards.\nThe idea amused me. What should I call the fellow? I still possess the leaf\nof a notebook with various alternative names. One rebelled against the\nelementary art which gives some inkling of character in the name, and\ncreates Mr. Sharps or Mr. Ferrets. First it was Sherringford Holmes; then\n10 it was Sherlock Holmes. He could not tell his own exploits, so he must\nhave a commonplace comrade as a foil \u2013 an educated man of action who\ncould both join in the exploits and narrate them. A drab, quiet name for\nthis unostentatious man. Watson would do. And so I had my puppets and\nwrote my Study in Scarlet.\n15 I knew that the book was as good as I could make it, and I had high\nhopes. When Girdlestone used to come circling back with the precision of\na homing pigeon, I was grieved but not surprised, for I acquiesced in the\ndecision. But when my little Holmes book began to do the circular tour I\nwas hurt, for I knew that it deserved a better fate. James Payn applauded\n20 but found it both too short and too long, which was true enough. Ar-\nrowsmith received it in May, 1886, and returned it unread in July. Two or\nthree others sniffed and turned away. Finally, as Ward, Lock & Co. made\na speciality of cheap and often sensational literature, I sent it to them.\n25 \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 they said, \u2013 \u2018We have read your story and are pleased with\nit. We could not publish it this year as the market is flooded at pres-\nent with cheap fiction, but if you do not object to its being held over\ntill next year, we will give you \u00a325 for the copyright.\n30 \u2018Yours faithfully,\n\u2018ward, lock & co.\n\u2018Oct. 30, 1886.\u2019\nIt was not a very tempting offer, and even I, poor as I was, hesitated\n35 to accept it. It was not merely the small sum offered, but it was the long\ndelay, for this book might open a road for me. I was heart-sick, however,\nat repeated disappointments, and I felt that perhaps it was true wisdom\nto make sure of publicity, however late. Therefore I accepted, and the\n62 chapter 8\nbook became Beeton\u2019s Xmas Annual of 1887. I never at any time received\nanother penny for it.\nHaving a long wait in front of me before this book could appear, and\nfeeling large thoughts rise within me, I now determined to test my powers\nto the full, and I chose a historical novel for this end, because it seemed 5\nto me the one way of combining a certain amount of literary dignity with\nthose scenes of action and adventure which were natural to my young\nand ardent mind. I had always felt great sympathy for the Puritans, who,\nafter all, whatever their little peculiarities, did represent political liberty\nand earnestness in religion. They had usually been caricatured in fiction 10\nand art. Even Scott had not drawn them as they were. Macaulay, who was\nalways one of my chief inspirations, had alone made them comprehensi-\nble \u2013 the sombre fighters, with their Bibles and their broadswords. There\nis a great passage of his \u2013 I cannot quote it verbally \u2013 in which he says\nthat after the Restoration if ever you saw a carter more intelligent than his 15\nfellows, or a peasant who tilled his land better, you would be likely to find\nthat it was an old pikeman of Cromwell\u2019s. This, then, was my inspiration\nin Micah Clarke, where I fairly let myself go upon the broad highway of\nadventure. I was well up in history, but I spent some months over details\nand then wrote the book very rapidly. There are bits of it \u2013 the picture of 20\nthe Puritan household, and the sketch of Judge Jeffreys \u2013 which I have\nnever bettered. When it was finished early in 1888 my hopes ran high\nand out it went on its travels.\nBut, alas! although my Holmes booklet was out, and had attract-\ned some little favourable comment, the door still seemed to be barred. 25\nJames Payn had first peep, and he began his letter of rejection with the\nsentence \u2018How can you, can you, waste your time and your wits writing\nhistorical novels!\u2019 This was depressing after a year of work. Then came\nBentley\u2019s verdict: \u2018It lacks in our opinion the one great necessary point\nfor fiction, i.e. interest; and this being the case we do not think it could 30\never become popular with libraries and the general public.\u2019 Then Black-\nwood had its say: \u2018There are imperfections which would militate against\nsuccess. The chances of the book proving a popular success do not seem\nto be strong enough to warrant us in publishing it.\u2019 There were others\neven more depressing. I was on the point of putting the worn manuscript 35\ninto hospital with its mangled brother Girdlestone when as a last resource\nI sent it to Longmans, whose reader, Andrew Lang, liked it and advised\nits acceptance. It was to \u2018Andrew of the brindled hair,\u2019 as Stevenson called\n63 my first literary success\nhim, that I owe my first real opening, and I have never forgotten it. The\nbook duly appeared in February, 1889, and though it was not a boom\nbook it had extraordinarily good reviews, including one special one all to\nitself by Mr. Protheroe in the Nineteenth Century, and it has sold without\n5 intermission from that day to this. It was the first solid corner-stone laid\nfor some sort of literary reputation.\nBritish literature had a considerable vogue in the United States at this\ntime for the simple reason that there was no copyright and they had not\nto pay for it. It was hard on British authors, but far harder on American\n10 ones, since they were exposed to this devastating competition. Like all\nnational sins it brought its own punishment not only to American au-\nthors, who were guiltless, but to the publishers themselves, for what be-\nlongs to everyone belongs practically to no one, and they could not bring\nout a decent edition without being at once undersold. I have seen some\n15 of my early American editions which might have been printed on the pa-\nper which shopmen use for parcels. One good result, however, from my\npoint of view was that a British author, if he had anything in him, soon\nwon recognition over there, and afterwards, when the Copyright Act was\npassed, he had his audience all ready for him. My Holmes book had met\n20 with some American success and presently I learned that an agent of Lip-\npincott\u2019s was in London and that he wished to see me, to arrange for a\nbook. Needless to say that I gave my patients a rest for a day and eagerly\nkept the appointment.\nOnce only before had I touched the edge of literary society. That was\n25 when Cornhill was turned into a fully illustrated journal, an experiment\nwhich failed for it was quickly abandoned. The change was celebrated by\na dinner at the Ship, at Greenwich, to which I was invited on the strength\nof my short contributions. All the authors and artists were there, and I\nremember the reverence with which I approached James Payn, who was\n30 to me the warden of the sacred gate. I was among the first arrivals, and\nwas greeted by Mr. Smith, the head of the firm, who introduced me to\nPayn. I loved much of his work and waited in awe for the first weighty\nremark which should fall from his lips. It was that there was a crack in\nthe window and he wondered how the devil it had got there. Let me add,\n35 however, that my future experience was to show that there was no witti-\ner or more delightful companion in the world. I sat next to Anstey that\nnight, who had just made a most deserved hit with his Vice Versa, and I\nwas introduced to other celebrities, so that I came back walking on air.\n64 chapter 8\nNow for the second time I was in London on literary business. Stod-\ndart, the American, proved to be an excellent fellow, and had two oth-\ners to dinner. They were Gill, a very entertaining Irish M.P., and Oscar\nWilde, who was already famous as the champion of aestheticism. It was\nindeed a golden evening for me. Wilde to my surprise had read Micah 5\nClarke and was enthusiastic about it, so that I did not feel a complete\noutsider. His conversation left an indelible impression upon my mind.\nHe towered above us all, and yet had the art of seeming to be interested\nin all that we could say. He had delicacy of feeling and tact, for the mon-\nologue man, however clever, can never be a gentleman at heart. He took 10\nas well as gave, but what he gave was unique. He had a curious precision\nof statement, a delicate flavour of humour, and a trick of small gestures to\nillustrate his meaning, which were peculiar to himself. The effect cannot\nbe reproduced, but I remember how in discussing the wars of the future\nhe said: \u2018A chemist on each side will approach the frontier with a bottle\u2019 15\n\u2013 his upraised hand and precise face conjuring up a vivid and grotesque\npicture. His anecdotes, too, were happy and curious. We were discussing\nthe cynical maxim that the good fortune of our friends made us discon-\ntented. \u2018The devil,\u2019 said Wilde, \u2018was once crossing the Libyan Desert, and\nhe came upon a spot where a number of small fiends were tormenting 20\na holy hermit. The sainted man easily shook off their evil suggestions.\nThe devil watched their failure and then he stepped forward to give them\na lesson. \u201cWhat you do is too crude,\u201d said he. \u201cPermit me for one mo-\nment.\u201d With that he whispered to the holy man, \u201cYour brother has just\nbeen made Bishop of Alexandria.\u201d A scowl of malignant jealousy at once 25\nclouded the serene face of the hermit. \u201cThat,\u201d said the devil to his imps,\n\u201cis the sort of thing which I should recommend.\u201d\u2019\nThe result of the evening was that both Wilde and I promised to write\nbooks for Lippincott\u2019s Magazine \u2013 Wilde\u2019s contribution was The Picture\nof Dorian Gray, a book which is surely upon a high moral plane, while I 30\nwrote The Sign of Four, in which Holmes made his second appearance.\nI should add that never in Wilde\u2019s conversation did I observe one trace\nof coarseness of thought, nor could one at that time associate him with\nsuch an idea. Only once again did I see him, many years afterwards, and\nthen he gave me the impression of being mad. He asked me, I remem- 35\nber, if I had seen some play of his which was running. I answered that I\nhad not. He said: \u2018Ah, you must go. It is wonderful. It is genius!\u2019 All this\nwith the gravest face. Nothing could have been more different from his\n65 my first literary success\nearly gentlemanly instincts. I thought at the time, and still think, that the\nmonstrous development which ruined him was pathological, and that a\nhospital rather than a police court was the place for its consideration.\nWhen his little book came out I wrote to say what I thought of it. His\n5 letter is worth reproducing, as showing the true Wilde. I omit the early\npart in which he comments on my own work in too generous terms.\n\u2018Between me and life there is a mist of words always. I throw prob-\nability out of the window for the sake of a phrase, and the chance of an\nepigram makes me desert truth. Still I do aim at making a work of art,\n10 and I am really delighted that you think my treatment subtle and artis-\ntically good. The newspapers seem to me to be written by the prurient\nfor the Philistine. I cannot understand how they can treat Dorian Gray\nas immoral. My difficulty was to keep the inherent moral subordinate to\nthe artistic and dramatic effect, and it still seems to me that the moral is\n15 too obvious.\u2019\nEncouraged by the kind reception which Micah Clarke had received\nfrom the critics, I now determined upon an even bolder and more am-\nbitious flight. It seemed to me that the days of Edward III constituted\nthe greatest epoch in English History \u2013 an epoch when both the French\n20 and the Scottish kings were prisoners in London. This result had been\nbrought about mainly by the powers of a body of men who were re-\nnowned through Europe but who had never been drawn in British liter-\nature, for though Scott treated in his inimitable way the English archer,\nit was as an outlaw rather than as a soldier that he drew him. I had some\n25 views of my own, too, about the Middle Ages which I was anxious to set\nforth. I was familiar with Froissart and Chaucer and I was aware that the\nfamous knights of old were by no means the athletic heroes of Scott, but\nwere often of a very different type. Hence came my two books The White\nCompany, written in 1889, and Sir Nigel, written fourteen years later. Of\n30 the two I consider the latter the better book, but I have no hesitation in\nsaying that the two of them taken together did thoroughly achieve my\npurpose, that they made an accurate picture of that great age, and that\nas a single piece of work they form the most complete, satisfying and\nambitious thing that I have ever done. All things find their level, but I\n35 believe that if I had never touched Holmes, who has tended to obscure\nmy higher work, my position in literature would at the present moment\nbe a more commanding one. The work needed much research and I have\nstill got my notebooks full of all sorts of lore. I cultivate a simple style\n66 chapter 8\nand avoid long words so far as possible, and it may be that this surface\nof ease has sometimes caused the reader to underrate the amount of real\nresearch which lies in all my historical novels. It is not a matter which\ntroubles me, however, for I have always felt that justice is done in the end,\nand that the real merit of any work is never permanently lost. 5\nI remember that as I wrote the last words of The White Company I felt\na wave of exultation and with a cry of \u2018That\u2019s done it!\u2019 I hurled my inky\npen across the room, where it left a black smudge upon the duck\u2019s-egg\nwall-paper. I knew in my heart that the book would live and that it would\nilluminate our national traditions. Now that it has passed through many 10\neditions I suppose I may say with all modesty that my forecast has proved\nto be correct. This was the last book which I wrote in my days of doctor-\ning at Southsea, and marks an epoch in my life, so I can now hark back to\nsome other phases of my last years at Bush Villa before I broke away into\na new existence. I will only add that The White Company was accepted 15\nby Cornhill, in spite of James Payn\u2019s opinion of historical novels, and that\nI fulfilled another ambition by having a serial in that famous magazine.\nA new phase of medical experience came to me about this time, for I\nsuddenly found myself a unit in the British Army. The operations in the\nEast had drained the Medical Service, and it had therefore been deter- 20\nmined that local civilian doctors should be enrolled for temporary duty\nof some hours a day. The terms were a guinea a day, and a number of us\nwere tempted to volunteer where there were only a few vacancies. When\nI was called before the Board of Selection a savage-looking old army\ndoctor who presided barked out, \u2018And you, sir \u2013 what are you prepared 25\nto do?\u2019 To which I answered, \u2018Anything.\u2019 It seems that the others had all\nbeen making bargains and reservations, so my wholehearted reply won\nthe job.\nIt brought me into closer contact with the savage-looking medico,\nwho proved to be Sir Anthony Home, V.C. \u2013 an honour which he had 30\nwon in the Indian Mutiny. He was in supreme charge, and as he was\nas fierce in speech and in act as in appearance, everyone was terrified\nof him. On one occasion I had told the orderly to draw a man\u2019s tooth,\nknowing that he was a very much more skilful dentist than I. I was on my\nway home when I was overtaken by an excited soldier who told me that 35\nSergeant Jones was being court-martialled and would certainly lose his\nstripes because he had done a minor operation. I hurried back and on\nentering the room found Sir Anthony glaring at the unhappy man, while\n67 my first literary success\nseveral other orderlies stood round awaiting their own turn. Sir Antho-\nny\u2019s glare was transferred to me when I said that whatever the Sergeant\nhad done was by my express order. He grunted, banged the book he was\nholding, and broke up the meeting. He seemed a most disagreeable old\n5 man, and yet when I was married shortly afterwards he sent me a most\ncharming message wishing me good fortune. Up to then I had never had\nanything from him save a scowl from his thick eyebrows, so I was most\nagreeably surprised. Soon afterwards the pressure ceased and we civil-\nians were all dismissed.\n68 Chapter 9\nPULLING UP THE ANCHOR\nPsychic Studies \u2013 Experiments in Telepathy \u2013 My First S\u00e9ances \u2013 A Curious 5\nTest \u2013 General Drayson \u2013 Opinion on Theosophy \u2013 A.

I\nhad at that time the usual contempt which the young educated man feels\ntowards the whole subject which has been covered by the clumsy name of 15\nSpiritualism. I had read of mediums being convicted of fraud, I had heard\nof phenomena which were opposed to every known scientific law, and\nI had deplored the simplicity and credulity which could deceive good,\nearnest people into believing that such bogus happenings were signs of\nintelligence outside our own existence. Educated as I had been during 20\nmy most plastic years in the school of medical materialism, and soaked in\nthe negative views of all my great teachers, I had no room in my brain for\ntheories which cut right across every fixed conclusion that I had formed.\nI was wrong and my great teachers were wrong, but still I hold that they\nwrought well and that their Victorian agnosticism was in the interests of 25\nthe human race, for it shook the old iron-clad unreasoning Evangelical\nposition which was so universal before their days. For all rebuilding a\nsite must be cleared. There were two separate Victorian movements to-\nwards change, the one an attempt to improve the old building and make\nit good enough to carry on \u2013 as shown in the Oxford and High Church 30\ndevelopment, the other a knocking down of ruins which could only end\nin some fresh erection springing up. As I have shown, my own position\nwas that of a respectful materialist who entirely admitted a great central\nintelligent cause, without being able to distinguish what that cause was,\nor why it should work in so mysterious and terrible a way in bringing its 35\ndesigns to fulfilment.\nFrom my point of view the mind (and so far as I could see the soul,\nwhich was the total effect of all the hereditary or personal functionings\n69 pulling up the anchor\nof the mind) was an emanation from the brain and entirely physical in its\nnature. I saw, as a medical man, how a spicule of bone or a tumour press-\ning on the brain would cause what seemed an alteration in the soul. I saw\nalso how drugs or alcohol would turn on fleeting phases of virtue or vice.\n5 The physical argument seemed an overpowering one. It had never struck\nme that the current of events might really flow in the opposite direction,\nand that the higher faculties could only manifest themselves imperfectly\nthrough an imperfect instrument. The broken fiddle is silent and yet the\nmusician is the same as ever.\n10 The first thing which steadied me and made me reconsider my posi-\ntion was the question of telepathy, which was already being discussed by\nWilliam Barrett and others, even before the appearance of Myers\u2019 mon-\numental work on Human Personality \u2013 the first book which devoted to\nthese psychic subjects the deep study and sustained brain power which\n15 they demand. It may, in my opinion, take a permanent place in human\nliterature like the Principia or The Descent of Man or any other great root-\nbook which has marked a date in human thought. Having read some of\nthe evidence I began to experiment in thought transference, and I found\na fellow-researcher in Mr. Ball, a well-known architect in the town. Again\n20 and again, sitting behind him, I have drawn diagrams, and he in turn has\nmade approximately the same figure. I showed beyond any doubt what-\never that I could convey my thought without words.\nBut if I could verify such conclusions up to six feet I could not well\ndoubt them when they gave me the evidence that the same results could\n25 be obtained at a distance. With an appropriate subject, and some unde-\nfined sympathy between the two individuals, it was independent of space.\nSo the evidence seemed to show. I had always sworn by science and by\nthe need of fearless following wherever truth might lie. It was clear now\nthat my position had been too rigid. I had compared the thought-excre-\n30 tion of the brain to the bile-excretion of the liver. Clearly this was un-\ntenable. If thought could go a thousand miles and produce a perceptible\neffect then it differed entirely not only in degree but in kind from any\npurely physical material. That seemed certain, and it must involve some\nmodification of my old views.\n35 About this time (1886) the family of General Harward, whom I at-\ntended professionally, became interested in table turning and asked me\nto come and check their results. They sat round a dining-room table\nwhich after a time, their hands being upon it, began to sway and final-\n70 chapter 9\nly got sufficient motion to tap with one leg. They then asked questions\nand received answers, more or less wise and more or less to the point.\nThey were got by the tedious process of reciting the alphabet and writing\ndown the letter which the tap indicated. It seemed to me that we were\ncollectively pushing the table, and that our own wills were concerned 5\nin bringing down the leg at the right moment. I was interested but very\nsceptical. Some of these messages were not vague platitudes but were\ndefinite and from dead friends of the Harward family, which naturally\nimpressed them greatly, though it had not the same effect upon me, since\nI did not know them. I have the old records before me as I write. \u2018Don\u2019t 10\ntell the girls when you see them, but they will talk about me. Kiss my\nbaby for me. I watch her always. Francie.\u2019 This was the style of message,\nmixed up with a good many platitudes. We held twenty or more of such\nmeetings, but I never received anything evidential to my own address,\nand I was very critical as to the whole proceedings. 15\nNone the less there was a problem to be solved and I went on with\nits solution, reading the pros and the cons, and asking advice from those\nwho had experience, especially from General Drayson, a very distin-\nguished thinker and a pioneer of psychic knowledge, who lived at that\ntime at Southsea. I had known Drayson first as an astronomer, for he 20\nhad worked out a revolutionary idea by which there is a fatal mistake\nin our present idea as to the circle which is described in the heavens by\nthe prolonged axis of the earth. It is really a wider circle round a differ-\nent centre, and this correction enables us to explain several things now\ninexplicable, and to make astronomy a more exact science, with certain 25\nvery important reactions upon geology and the recurrent glacial epochs,\nthe exact date of which could be fixed. His views impressed me much\nat the time, and several books upholding them have appeared since his\ndeath, notably Draysoniana by Admiral de Horsey. If he makes good, as\nI think he will, Drayson will make a great permanent name. His opinion 30\ntherefore was not negligible upon any subject, and when he told me his\nviews and experiences on Spiritualism I could not fail to be impressed,\nthough my own philosophy was far too solid to be easily destroyed. I was\ntoo poor to employ professional mediums, and to work on such subjects\nwithout a medium is as if one worked at astronomy without a telescope. 35\nOnce only an old man with some reputed psychic power came for a small\nfee and gave us a demonstration. He went into a loud-breathing trance to\nthe alarm of his audience, and then gave each of us a test. Mine was cer-\n71 pulling up the anchor\ntainly a very remarkable one, for it was \u2018Do not read Leigh Hunt\u2019s book.\u2019\nI was hesitating at the time whether I should read his Comic Dramatists\nof the Restoration or not, for on the one hand it is literature and on the\nother the treatment repelled me. This then was a very final and excellent\n5 test so far as telepathy went, but I would not fully grant that it was more.\nI was so impressed, however, that I wrote a signed account of it to Light,\nthe psychic weekly paper, and so in the year 1887 I actually put myself on\npublic record as a student of these matters. That was thirty-seven years\nago, as I write, so I am a very senior student now. From that time onwards\n10 I read and thought a great deal, though it was not until the later phase of\nmy life that I realized whither all this was tending. This question I will\ntreat in a final section by itself, so that those to whom it is of less interest\ncan avoid it.\nI was deeply interested and attracted for a year or two by Theoso-\n15 phy, because while Spiritualism seemed at that time to be chaos so far\nas philosophy went, Theosophy presented a very well-thought-out and\nreasonable scheme, parts of which, notably reincarnation and Kharma,\nseemed to offer an explanation for some of the anomalies of life. I read\nSinnett\u2019s Occult World and afterwards with even greater admiration I read\n20 his fine exposition of Theosophy in Esoteric Buddhism, a most notable\nbook. I also met him, for he was an old friend of General Drayson\u2019s, and\nI was impressed by his conversation. Shortly afterwards, however, there\nappeared Dr. Hodgson\u2019s report upon his investigation into Madame Bla-\nvatsky\u2019s proceedings at Adyar, which shook my confidence very much.\n25 It is true that Mrs. Besant has since then published a powerful defence\nwhich tends to show that Hodgson may have been deceived, but the sub-\nsequent book, A Priestess of Isis, which contains many of her own letters,\nleaves an unpleasant impression, and Sinnett\u2019s posthumous work seems\nto show that he also had lost confidence. On the other hand, Colonel Ol-\n30 cott shows that the woman undoubtedly had real psychic powers, what-\never their source. As to Spiritualism, it seems to have only interested her\nin its lower phenomenal aspect. Her books show extraordinary erudition\nand capacity for hard work, even if they represent the transfer of other\npeople\u2019s conclusions, as they frequently do. It would be unjust, however,\n35 to condemn the old wisdom simply because it was introduced by this\nextraordinary and volcanic person. We have also had in our branch of the\noccult many dishonest mediums, but we have hastened to unveil them\nwhere we could do so, and Theosophy will be in a stronger position when\n72 chapter 9\nit shakes off Madame Blavatsky altogether. In any case it could never have\nmet my needs for I ask for severe proof, and if I have to go back to un-\nquestioning faith I should find myself in the fold from which I wandered.\nMy life had been a pleasant one with my steadily-increasing literary\nsuccess, my practice, which was enough to keep me pleasantly occupied, 5\nand my sport, which I treat in a later chapter. Suddenly, however, there\ncame a development which shook me out of my rut, and caused an ab-\nsolute change in my life and plans. One daughter, Mary, had been born\nto us, our household was a happy one, and as I have never had person-\nal ambitions, since the simple things of life have always been the most 10\npleasant to me, it is possible that I should have remained in Southsea per-\nmanently but for this new episode in my life. It arose when in 1890 Koch\nannounced that he had discovered a sure cure for consumption and that\nhe would demonstrate it upon a certain date in Berlin.\nA great urge came upon me suddenly that I should go to Berlin and 15\nsee him do so. I could give no clear reason for this, but it was an irresist-\nible impulse and I at once determined to go. Had I been a well-known\ndoctor or a specialist in consumption it would have been more intelli-\ngible, but I had, as a matter of fact, no great interest in the more recent\ndevelopments of my own profession, and a very strong belief that much 20\nof the so-called progress was illusory. However, at a few hours\u2019 notice\nI packed up a bag and started off alone upon this curious adventure. I\nhad had an interchange of letters with Mr. W. T. Stead over some matter\nand I called upon him at the Review of Reviews office as I passed through\nLondon to ask him if he could give me an introduction to Koch or to 25\nDr. Bergmann, who was to give the demonstration. Mr. Stead was very\namiable to this big unknown provincial doctor, and he gave me a letter\nfor the British Ambassador \u2013 Sir Edward Malet, if I remember right \u2013 and\nfor Mr. Lowe, The Times correspondent. He also asked me to do a char-\nacter sketch of Koch for him, adding that he would have Count Mattei 30\nas a feature of his magazine this month and Koch the next. I said, \u2018Then\nyou will have the greatest man of science and the greatest quack in Eu-\nrope following each other.\u2019 Stead glared at me angrily, for it seems that\nthe Mattei treatment with its blue electricity and the rest of it was at that\nmoment his particular fad. However, we parted amiably and all through 35\nhis life we kept in distant touch, though we came into sharp collision\nat the time of the Boer war. He was a brave and honest man, and if he\nwas impulsive at times it was only the sudden outflame of that fire which\n73 pulling up the anchor\nmade him the great force for good that he was. In psychic knowledge he\nwas a generation before his time, though his mode of expressing it may\nsometimes have been injudicious.\nI went on to Berlin that night and found myself in the Continental\n5 express with a very handsome and courteous London physician bound\nupon the same errand as myself. We passed most of the night talking and\nI learned that his name was Malcolm Morris and that he also had been a\nprovincial doctor, but that he had come to London and had made a con-\nsiderable hit as a skin specialist in Harley Street. It was the beginning of a\n10 friendship which endured.\nHaving arrived at Berlin the great thing was to be present at Berg-\nmann\u2019s demonstration, which was to be next day at twelve. I went to our\nAmbassador, was kept long waiting, had a chilly reception and was dis-\nmissed without help or consolation. Then I tried The Times correspond-\n15 ent, but he could not help me either. He and his amiable wife showed me\nevery courtesy and invited me to dinner that night. Tickets were simply\nnot to be had and neither money nor interest could procure them. I con-\nceived the wild idea of getting one from Koch himself and made my way\nto his house. While there I had the curious experience of seeing his mail\n20 arrive \u2013 a large sack full of letters, which was emptied out on the floor of\nthe hall, and exhibited every sort of stamp in Europe. It was a sign of all\nthe sad broken lives and wearied hearts which were turning in hope to\nBerlin. Koch remained a veiled prophet, however, and would see neither\nme nor anyone else. I was fairly at my wits\u2019 ends and could not imagine\n25 how I could attain my end.\nNext day I went down to the great building where the address was to\nbe given and managed by bribing the porter to get into the outer Hall.\nThe huge audience was assembling in a room beyond. I tried further\nbribing that I might be slipped in, but the official became abusive. People\n30 streamed past me, but I was always the waiter at the gate. Finally every-\none had gone in and then a group of men came hustling across, Berg-\nmann, bearded and formidable, in the van, with a tail of house surgeons\nand satellites behind him. I threw myself across his path. \u2018I have come\na thousand miles,\u2019 said I. \u2018May I not come in?\u2019 He halted and glared at\n35 me through his spectacles. \u2018Perhaps you would like to take my place,\u2019 he\nroared, working himself up into that sudden folly of excitement which\nseems so strange in the heavy German nature. \u2018That is the only place left.\nYes, yes, take my place by all means. My classes are filled with English-\n74 chapter 9\nmen already.\u2019 He fairly spat out the word \u2018Englishmen\u2019 and I learned af-\nterwards that some recent quarrel with Morell Mackenzie over the illness\nof the Emperor Frederick had greatly incensed him. I am glad to say that\nI kept my temper and my polite manner, which is always the best shield\nwhen one is met by brutal rudeness. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 I said. \u2018I would not in- 5\ntrude, if there was really no room.\u2019 He glared at me again, all beard and\nspectacles, and rushed on with his court all grinning at the snub which\nthe presumptuous Englishman had received. One of them lingered, how-\never \u2013 a kindly American. \u2018That was bad behaviour,\u2019 said he. \u2018See here! If\nyou meet me at four this afternoon I will show you my full notes of the 10\nlecture, and I know the cases he is about to show, so we can see them\ntogether to-morrow.\u2019 Then he followed on.\nSo it came about that I attained my end after all, but in a rounda-\nbout way. I studied the lecture and the cases, and I had the temerity to\ndisagree with everyone and to come to the conclusion that the whole 15\nthing was experimental and premature. A wave of madness had seized\nthe world and from all parts, notably from England, poor afflicted people\nwere rushing to Berlin for a cure, some of them in such advanced stages\nof disease that they died in the train. I felt so sure of my ground and so\nstrongly about it that I wrote a signed letter of warning to The Daily Tele- 20\ngraph, and I rather think that this letter was the very first which appeared\nupon the side of doubt and caution. I need not say that the event proved\nthe truth of my forecast.\nTwo days later I was back in Southsea, but I came back a changed\nman. I had spread my wings and had felt something of the powers within 25\nme. Especially I had been influenced by a long talk with Malcolm Morris,\nin which he assured me that I was wasting my life in the provinces and\nhad too small a field for my activities. He insisted that I should leave gen-\neral practice and go to London. I answered that I was by no means sure\nof my literary success as yet, and that I could not so easily abandon the 30\nmedical career which had cost my mother such sacrifices and myself so\nmany years of study. He asked me if there was any special branch of the\nprofession on which I could concentrate so as to get away from general\npractice. I said that of late years I had been interested in eye work and\nhad amused myself by correcting refractions and ordering glasses in the 35\nPortsmouth Eye Hospital under Mr. Vernon Ford. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Morris,\n\u2018why not specialize upon the eye? Go to Vienna, put in six months\u2019 work,\ncome back and start in London. Thus you will have a nice clean life with\n75 pulling up the anchor\nplenty of leisure for your literature.\u2019 I came home with this great sugges-\ntion buzzing in my head and as my wife was quite willing and Mary, my\nlittle girl, was old enough now to be left with her grandmother, there\nseemed to be no obstacle in the way. There were no difficulties about\n5 disposing of the practice, for it was so small and so purely personal that it\ncould not be sold to another and simply had to dissolve.\nThe Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society gave me a God-speed\nbanquet. I have many pleasant and some comic reminiscences of this So-\nciety, of which I had been secretary for several years. We kept the sacred\n10 flame burning in the old city with our weekly papers and discussions dur-\ning the long winters. It was there I learned to face an audience, which\nproved to be of the first importance for my life\u2019s work. I was naturally of\na very nervous, backward, self-distrustful disposition in such things and\nI have been told that the signal that I was about to join in the discussion\n15 was that the whole long bench on which I sat, with everyone on it, used\nto shake with my emotion. But once up I learned to speak out, to conceal\nmy trepidations, and to choose my phrases. I gave three papers, one on\nthe Arctic seas, one on Carlyle and one on Gibbon. The former gave me\na quite unmerited reputation as a sportsman, for I borrowed from a local\n20 taxidermist every bird and beast that he possessed which could conceiva-\nbly find its way into the Arctic Circle. These I piled upon the lecture table,\nand the audience, concluding that I had shot them all, looked upon me\nwith great respect. Next morning they were back with the taxidermist\nonce more. We had some weird people and incidents at these debates. I\n25 remember one very learned discussion on fossils and the age of the stra-\nta, which was ended by a cadaverous major-general of the Evangelical\npersuasion who rose and said in a hollow voice that all this speculation\nwas vain, and indeed incomprehensible, since we knew on an authority\nwhich could not possibly be questioned that the world was made exactly\n30 five thousand eight hundred and ninety years ago. This put the lid on the\ndebate and we all crept home to bed.\nMy political work also caused me to learn to speak. I was what was\ncalled a Liberal-Unionist, that is, a man whose general position was Lib-\neral, but who could not see his way to support Gladstone\u2019s Irish Policy.\n35 Perhaps we were wrong. However, that was my view at the time. I had\na dreadful first experience of platform speaking on a large scale, for at a\nhuge meeting at the Amphitheatre the candidate, Sir William Crossman,\nwas delayed, and to prevent a fiasco I was pushed on at a moment\u2019s notice\n76 chapter 9\nto face an audience of 3,000 people. It was one of the tight corners of my\nlife. I hardly knew myself what I said, but the Irish part of me came to my\naid and supplied me with a torrent of more or less incoherent words and\nsimiles which roused the audience greatly, though it read to me after-\nwards more like a comic stump speech than a serious political effort. But 5\nit was what they wanted and they were mostly on their feet before I fin-\nished. I was amazed when I read it next day, and especially the last crown-\ning sentence, which was: \u2018England and Ireland are wedded together with\nthe sapphire wedding ring of the sea, and what God has placed together\nlet no man pluck asunder.\u2019 It was not very good logic, but whether it was 10\neloquence or rhodomontade I could not even now determine.\nI was acting Secretary when Mr. Balfour came down to address\na great meeting, and, as such, when the Hall was full, I waited on the\nkerb outside to receive him. Presently his carriage drove up and out he\nstepped, tall, thin and aristocratic. There were two notorious partisans 15\nof the other side waiting for him and I warned them not to make trou-\nble. However, the moment Balfour appeared one of them opened a huge\nmouth with the intention of emitting a howl of execration. But it never\ngot out, for I clapped my hand pretty forcibly over the orifice while I held\nhim by the neck with the other hand. His companion hit me on the head 20\nwith a stick, and was promptly knocked down by one of my companions.\nMeanwhile Balfour got safely in, and we two secretaries followed, rather\ndishevelled after our adventure. I met Lord Balfour several times in after\nlife but I never told him how I once had my hat smashed in his defence.\nWhat with the Literary Society and the politicians I left a gap behind 25\nme in Portsmouth and so did my wife, who was universally popular for\nher amiable and generous character. It was a wrench to us to leave so\nmany good friends. However, towards the end of 1890 the die was cast,\nand we closed the door of Bush Villa behind us for the last time. I had\ndays of privation there, and days of growing success during the eight long 30\nyears that I had spent in Portsmouth. Now it was with a sense of wonder-\nful freedom and exhilarating adventure that we set forth upon the next\nphase of our lives.\n77 Chapter 10\nTHE GREAT BREAK\n5 Vienna \u2013 A Specialist in Wimpole Street \u2013 The Great Decision \u2013 Norwood\n\u2013 The Refugees \u2013 Reported Death of Holmes \u2013 Psychic Research Society\n\u2013 Literary Circles in London \u2013 Henry Irving \u2013 A Great Blow \u2013 Brigadier\nGerard \u2013 Davos \u2013 American Lecture Tour \u2013 Answer to Prayer.\n10 We set forth upon a bitter winter day at the close of 1890 with every\nchance of being snowed up on our long trek. We got through all right,\nhowever, and found ourselves in Vienna, arriving on a deadly cold night,\nwith deep snow under foot and a cutting blizzard in the air. As we looked\nfrom the station the electric lights threw out the shining silver drift of\n15 snow-flakes against the absolute darkness of the sky. It was a gloomy, om-\ninous reception, but half an hour afterwards when we were in the warm\ncosy crowded tobacco-laden restaurant attached to our hotel we took a\nmore cheerful view of our surroundings.\nWe found a modest pension which was within our means, and we put\n20 in a very pleasant four months, during which I attended eye lectures at\nthe Krankenhaus, but could certainly have learned far more in London,\nfor even if one has a fair knowledge of conversational German it is very\ndifferent from following accurately a rapid lecture filled with technical\nterms. No doubt \u2018has studied in Vienna\u2019 sounds well in a specialist\u2019s re-\n25 cord, but it is usually taken for granted that he has exhausted his own\ncountry before going abroad, which was by no means the case with me.\nTherefore, so far as eye work goes, my winter was wasted, nor can I trace\nany particular spiritual or intellectual advance. On the other hand I saw\na little of gay Viennese society. I received kind and welcome hospitali-\n30 ty from Brinsley Richards, The Times correspondent, and his wife, and\nI had some excellent skating. I also wrote one short book, The Doings\nof Raffles Haw, not a very notable achievement, by which I was able to\npay my current expenses without encroaching on the very few hundred\npounds which were absolutely all that I had in the world. This money was\n35 invested on the advice of a friend, and as it was almost all lost \u2013 like so\nmuch more that I have earned \u2013 it is just as well that I was never driven\nback upon it.\nWith the spring my work at Vienna had finished, if it can be said to\n78 chapter 10\nhave ever begun, and we returned via Paris, putting in a few days there\nwith Landolt, who was the most famous French oculist of his time. It was\ngreat to find ourselves back in London once more with the feeling that\nwe were now on the real field of battle, where we must conquer or perish,\nfor our boats were burned behind us. It is easy now to look back and 5\nthink that the issue was clear, but it was by no means so at the time, for I\nhad earned little, though my reputation was growing. It was only my own\ninward conviction of the permanent merits of The White Company, still\nappearing month by month in Cornhill, which sustained my confidence.\nI had come through so much in the early days at Southsea that nothing 10\ncould alarm me personally, but I had a wife and child now, and the stern\nsimplicity of life which was possible and even pleasant in early days was\nnow no longer to be thought of.\nWe took rooms in Montague Place, and I went forth to search for\nsome place where I could put up my plate as an oculist. I was aware that 15\nmany of the big men do not find time to work out refractions, which in\nsome cases of astigmatism take a long time to adjust when done by reti-\nnoscopy. I was capable in this work and liked it, so I hoped that some of it\nmight drift my way. But to get it, it was clearly necessary that I should live\namong the big men so that the patient could be easily referred to me. I 20\nsearched the doctors\u2019 quarters and at last found suitable accommodation\nat 2 Devonshire Place, which is at the top of Wimpole Street and close to\nthe classical Harley Street. There for \u00a3120 a year I got the use of a front\nroom with part use of a waiting-room. I was soon to find that they were\nboth waiting-rooms, and now I know that it was better so. 25\nEvery morning I walked from the lodgings at Montague Place,\nreached my consulting-room at ten and sat there until three or four, with\nnever a ring to disturb my serenity. Could better conditions for reflec-\ntion and work be found? It was ideal, and so long as I was thoroughly\nunsuccessful in my professional venture there was every chance of im- 30\nprovement in my literary prospects. Therefore when I returned to the\nlodgings at tea-time I bore my little sheaves with me, the first-fruits of a\nconsiderable harvest.\nA number of monthly magazines were coming out at that time, no-\ntable among which was The Strand, then as now under the editorship 35\nof Greenhough Smith. Considering these various journals with their\ndisconnected stories it had struck me that a single character running\nthrough a series, if it only engaged the attention of the reader, would bind\n79 the great break\nthat reader to that particular magazine. On the other hand, it had long\nseemed to me that the ordinary serial might be an impediment rather\nthan a help to a magazine, since, sooner or later, one missed one number\nand afterwards it had lost all interest. Clearly the ideal compromise was\n5 a character which carried through, and yet instalments which were each\ncomplete in themselves, so that the purchaser was always sure that he\ncould relish the whole contents of the magazine. I believe that I was the\nfirst to realize this and The Strand Magazine the first to put it into practice.\nLooking round for my central character I felt that Sherlock Holmes,\n10 whom I had already handled in two little books, would easily lend him-\nself to a succession of short stories. These I began in the long hours of\nwaiting in my consulting-room. Greenhough Smith liked them from the\nfirst, and encouraged me to go ahead with them. My literary affairs had\nbeen taken up by that king of agents, A. P. Watt, who relieved me of all\n15 the hateful bargaining, and handled things so well that any immediate\nanxiety for money soon disappeared. It was as well, for not one single\npatient had ever crossed the threshold of my room.\nI was now once more at a crossroads of my life, and Providence,\nwhich I recognize at every step, made me realize it in a very energetic\n20 and unpleasant way. I was starting off for my usual trudge one morning\nfrom our lodgings when icy shivers passed over me, and I only got back\nin time to avoid a total collapse. It was a virulent attack of influenza, at a\ntime when influenza was in its deadly prime. Only three years before my\ndear sister Annette, after spending her whole life on the family needs, had\n25 died of it at Lisbon at the very moment when my success would have en-\nabled me to recall her from her long servitude. Now it was my turn, and I\nvery nearly followed her. I can remember no pain or extreme discomfort,\nand no psychic experiences, but for a week I was in great danger, and\nthen found myself as weak as a child and as emotional, but with a mind\n30 as clear as crystal. It was then, as I surveyed my own life, that I saw how\nfoolish I was to waste my literary earnings in keeping up an oculist\u2019s room\nin Wimpole Street, and I determined with a wild rush of joy to cut the\npainter and to trust for ever to my power of writing. I remember in my\ndelight taking the handkerchief which lay upon the coverlet in my enfee-\n35 bled hand, and tossing it up to the ceiling in my exultation.\nI should at last be my own master. No longer would I have to con-\nform to professional dress or try to please anyone else. I would be free\nto live how I liked and where I liked. It was one of the great moments of\n80 chapter 10\nexultation of my life. The date was in August, 1891.\nPresently I was about, hobbling on a stick and reflecting that if I lived\nto be eighty I knew already exactly how it would feel. I haunted house-\nagents, got lists of suburban villas, and spent some weeks, as my strength\nreturned, in searching for a new home. Finally I found a suitable house, 5\nmodest but comfortable, isolated and yet one of a row. It was 12 Tenni-\nson Road, South Norwood. There we settled down, and there I made my\nfirst effort to live entirely by my pen. It soon became evident that I had\nbeen playing the game well within my powers and that I should have no\ndifficulty in providing a sufficient income. It seemed as if I had settled 10\ninto a life which might be continuous, and I little foresaw that an unex-\npected blow was about to fall upon us, and that we were not at the end,\nbut really at the beginning, of our wanderings.\nI could not know this, however, and I settled down with a stout heart\nto do some literary work worthy of the name. The difficulty of the Holm- 15\nes work was that every story really needed as clear-cut and original a plot\nas a longish book would do. One cannot without effort spin plots at such\na rate. They are apt to become thin or to break. I was determined, now\nthat I had no longer the excuse of absolute pecuniary pressure, never\nagain to write anything which was not as good as I could possibly make 20\nit, and therefore I would not write a Holmes story without a worthy plot\nand without a problem which interested my own mind, for that is the first\nrequisite before you can interest anyone else. If I have been able to sus-\ntain this character for a long time and if the public find, as they will find,\nthat the last story is as good as the first, it is entirely due to the fact that I 25\nnever, or hardly ever, forced a story. Some have thought there was a fall-\ning off in the stories, and the criticism was neatly expressed by a Cornish\nboatman who said to me, \u2018I think, sir, when Holmes fell over that cliff,\nhe may not have killed himself, but all the same he was never quite the\nsame man afterwards.\u2019 I think, however, that if the reader began the series 30\nbackwards, so that he brought a fresh mind to the last stories, he would\nagree with me that, though the general average may not be conspicuously\nhigh, still the last one is as good as the first.\nI was weary, however, of inventing plots and I set myself now to do\nsome work which would certainly be less remunerative but would be 35\nmore ambitious from a literary point of view. I had long been attracted\nby the epoch of Louis XIV and by those Huguenots who were the French\nequivalents of our Puritans. I had a good knowledge of the memoirs of\n81 the great break\nthat date, and many notes already prepared, so that it did not take me\nlong to write The Refugees. It has stood the acid test of time very well, so\nI may say that it was a success. Soon after its appearance it was translated\ninto French, and my dear old mother, herself a great French scholar, had\n5 the joy when she visited Fontainebleau to hear the official guide tell the\ndrove of tourists that if they really wanted to know about the Court of\nthe great monarch, they would find the clearest and most accurate ac-\ncount in an Englishman\u2019s book, The Refugees. I expect the guide would\nhave been considerably astonished had he then and there been kissed\n10 by an elderly English lady, but it was an experience which he must have\nnarrowly missed. I used in this book, also, a great deal which was drawn\nfrom Parkman, that great but neglected historian, who was in my opinion\nthe greatest serious writer that America has produced.\nThere was an amusing episode connected with The Refugees, when\n15 it was read aloud in some strict Irish convent, the innocent Reverend\nMother having mistaken my name and imagined that I was a canon, and\ntherefore of course a holy man. I am told that the reading was a tremen-\ndous success and that the good sisters rejoiced that the mistake was not\nfound out until the story was completed. My first name has several times\n20 led to mistakes, as when, at a big dinner at Chicago, I was asked to say\nGrace, as being the only ecclesiastic present. I remember that at the same\ndinner one of the speakers remarked that it was a most sinister fact that\nthough I was a doctor no living patient of mine had ever yet been seen.\nDuring this Norwood interval, I was certainly working hard, for be-\n25 sides The Refugees I wrote The Great Shadow, a booklet which I should\nput near the front of my work for merit, and two other little books on a\nvery inferior plane \u2013 The Parasite and Beyond the City. The latter was of a\ndomestic type unusual for me. It was pirated in New York just before the\nNew Copyright Act came into force, and the rascal publisher thinking\n30 that a portrait \u2013 any sort of portrait \u2013 of the author would look well upon\nthe cover, and being quite ignorant of my identity, put a very pretty and\nover-dressed young woman as my presentment. I still preserve a copy of\nthis most flattering representation. All these books had some decent suc-\ncess, though none of it was remarkable. It was still the Sherlock Holmes\n35 stories for which the public clamoured, and these from time to time I\nendeavoured to supply. At last, after I had done two series of them I saw\nthat I was in danger of having my hand forced, and of being entirely iden-\ntified with what I regarded as a lower stratum of literary achievement.\n82 chapter 10\nTherefore as a sign of my resolution I determined to end the life of my\nhero. The idea was in my mind when I went with my wife for a short hol-\niday in Switzerland, in the course of which we saw there the wonderful\nfalls of Reichenbach, a terrible place, and one that I thought would make\na worthy tomb for poor Sherlock, even if I buried my banking account 5\nalong with him. So there I laid him, fully determined that he should stay\nthere \u2013 as indeed for some years he did. I was amazed at the concern ex-\npressed by the public. They say that a man is never properly appreciated\nuntil he is dead, and the general protest against my summary execution\nof Holmes taught me how many and how numerous were his friends. 10\n\u2018You Brute\u2019 was the beginning of the letter of remonstrance which one\nlady sent me, and I expect she spoke for others besides herself. I heard of\nmany who wept. I fear I was utterly callous myself, and only glad to have a\nchance of opening out into new fields of imagination, for the temptation\nof high prices made it difficult to get one\u2019s thoughts away from Holmes. 15\nThat Sherlock Holmes was anything but mythical to many is shown\nby the fact that I have had many letters addressed to him with requests\nthat I forward them. Watson has also had a number of letters in which he\nhas been asked for the address or for the autograph of his more brilliant\nconfr\u00e8re. A press-cutting agency wrote to Watson asking whether Holm- 20\nes would not wish to subscribe. When Holmes retired several elderly la-\ndies were ready to keep house for him and one sought to ingratiate herself\nby assuring me that she knew all about bee-keeping and could \u2018segregate\nthe queen.\u2019 I had considerable offers also for Holmes if he would examine\nand solve various family mysteries. Once the offer \u2013 from Poland \u2013 was 25\nthat I should myself go, and my reward was practically left to my own\njudgment. I had judgment enough, however, to avoid it altogether.\nI have often been asked whether I had myself the qualities which I\ndepicted, or whether I was merely the Watson that I look. Of course I\nam well aware that it is one thing to grapple with a practical problem and 30\nquite another thing when you are allowed to solve it under your own\nconditions. I have no delusions about that. At the same time a man can-\nnot spin a character out of his own inner consciousness and make it really\nlife-like unless he has some possibilities of that character within him \u2013\nwhich is a dangerous admission for one who has drawn so many villains 35\nas I. In my poem \u2018The Inner Room,\u2019 describing our multiplex personality,\nI say:\n83 the great break\nThere are others who are sitting,\nGrim as doom,\nIn the dim ill-boding shadow\nOf my room.\n5 Darkling figures, stern or quaint,\nNow a savage, now a saint,\nShowing fitfully and faint\nIn the gloom.\n10 Among those figures there may perhaps be an astute detective also,\nbut I find that in real life in order to find him I have to inhibit all the oth-\ners and get into a mood when there is no one in the room but he. Then\nI get results and have several times solved problems by Holmes\u2019 meth-\nods after the police have been baffled. Yet I must admit that in ordinary\n15 life I am by no means observant and that I have to throw myself into an\nartificial frame of mind before I can weigh evidence and anticipate the\nsequence of events.\n84 Chapter 11\nSIDELIGHTS ON SHERLOCK HOLMES\nThe Speckled Band \u2013 Barrie\u2019s Parody on Holmes \u2013 Holmes on the Films 5\n\u2013 Methods of Construction \u2013 Problems \u2013 Curious Letters \u2013 Some Personal\nCases \u2013 Strange Happenings.\nI may as well interrupt my narrative here in order to say what may inter-\nest my readers about my most notorious character. 10\nThe impression that Holmes was a real person of flesh and blood may\nhave been intensified by his frequent appearance upon the stage. After\nthe withdrawal of my dramatization of Rodney Stone from a theatre upon\nwhich I held a six months\u2019 lease, I determined to play a bold and ener-\ngetic game, for an empty theatre spells ruin. When I saw the course that 15\nthings were taking I shut myself up and devoted my whole mind to mak-\ning a sensational Sherlock Holmes drama. I wrote it in a week and called\nit The Speckled Band after the short story of that name. I do not think that\nI exaggerate if I say that within a fortnight of the one play shutting down\nI had a company working upon the rehearsals of a second one, which 20\nhad been written in the interval. It was a considerable success. Lyn Hard-\ning, as the half epileptic and wholly formidable Doctor Grimesby Rylott,\nwas most masterful, while Saintsbury as Sherlock Holmes was also very\ngood. Before the end of the run I had cleared off all that I had lost upon\nthe other play, and I had created a permanent property of some value. It 25\nbecame a stock piece and is even now touring the country. We had a fine\nrock boa to play the title-r\u00f4le, a snake which was the pride of my heart,\nso one can imagine my disgust when I saw that the critic of the Daily Tel-\negraph ended his disparaging review by the words \u2018The crisis of the play\nwas produced by the appearance of a palpably artificial serpent.\u2019 I was in- 30\nclined to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake to go to bed with\nit. We had several snakes at different times, but they were none of them\nborn actors and they were all inclined either to hang down from the hole\nin the wall like inanimate bell-pulls, or else to turn back through the hole\nand get even with the stage carpenter who pinched their tails in order to 35\nmake them more lively. Finally we used artificial snakes, and everyone,\nincluding the stage carpenter, agreed that it was more satisfactory.\nThis was the second Sherlock Holmes play. I should have spoken\n85 sidelights on sherlock holmes\nabout the first, which was produced very much earlier, in fact at the time\nof the African war. It was written and most wonderfully acted by William\nGillette, the famous American. Since he used my characters and to some\nextent my plots, he naturally gave me a share in the undertaking, which\n5 proved to be very successful. \u2018May I marry Holmes?\u2019 was one cable which\nI received from him when in the throes of composition. \u2018You may marry\nor murder or do what you like with him,\u2019 was my heartless reply. I was\ncharmed both with the play, the acting and the pecuniary result. I think\nthat every man with a drop of artistic blood in his veins would agree that\n10 the latter consideration, though very welcome when it does arrive, is still\nthe last of which he thinks.\nSir James Barrie paid his respects to Sherlock Holmes in a rollick-\ning parody. It was really a gay gesture of resignation over the failure\nwhich we had encountered with a comic opera for which he undertook\n15 to write the libretto. I collaborated with him on this, but in spite of our\njoint efforts, the piece fell flat. Whereupon Barrie sent me a parody\non Holmes, written on the fly leaves of one of his books. It ran thus:\u2013\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE TWO COLLABORATORS\n20\nIn bringing to a close the adventures of my friend Sherlock Holmes I\nam perforce reminded that he never, save on the occasion which, as you\nwill now hear, brought his singular career to an end, consented to act in\nany mystery which was concerned with persons who made a livelihood\n25 by their pen. \u2018I am not particular about the people I mix among for busi-\nness purposes,\u2019 he would say, \u2018but at literary characters I draw the line.\u2019\nWe were in our rooms in Baker Street one evening. I was (I remem-\nber) by the centre table writing out \u2018The Adventure of the Man without\na Cork Leg\u2019 (which had so puzzled the Royal Society and all the other\n30 scientific bodies of Europe), and Holmes was amusing himself with a lit-\ntle revolver practice. It was his custom of a summer evening to fire round\nmy head, just shaving my face, until he had made a photograph of me on\nthe opposite wall, and it is a slight proof of his skill that many of these\nportraits in pistol shots are considered admirable likenesses.\n35 I happened to look out of the window, and perceiving two gentle-\nmen advancing rapidly along Baker Street asked him who they were. He\nimmediately lit his pipe, and, twisting himself on a chair into the figure\n8, replied:\n86 chapter 11\n\u2018They are two collaborators in comic opera, and their play has not\nbeen a triumph.\u2019\nI sprang from my chair to the ceiling in amazement, and he then ex-\nplained:\n\u2018My dear Watson, they are obviously men who follow some low call- 5\ning. That much even you should be able to read in their faces. Those little\npieces of blue paper which they fling angrily from them are Durrant\u2019s\nPress Notices. Of these they have obviously hundreds about their person\n(see how their pockets bulge). They would not dance on them if they\nwere pleasant reading.\u2019 10\nI sprang again to the ceiling (which is much dented), and shouted:\n\u2018Amazing! but they may be mere authors.\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Holmes, \u2018for mere authors only get one press notice a week.\nOnly criminals, dramatists and actors get them by the hundred.\u2019\n\u2018Then they may be actors.\u2019 15\n\u2018No, actors would come in a carriage.\u2019\n\u2018Can you tell me anything else about them?\u2019\n\u2018A great deal. From the mud on the boots of the tall one I perceive that\nhe comes from South Norwood. The other is as obviously a Scotch author.\u2019\n\u2018How can you tell that?\u2019 20\n\u2018He is carrying in his pocket a book called (I clearly see) Auld Licht\nSomething. Would anyone but the author be likely to carry about a book\nwith such a title?\u2019\nI had to confess that this was improbable.\nIt was now evident that the two men (if such they can be called) were 25\nseeking our lodgings. I have said (often) that my friend Holmes seldom\ngave way to emotion of any kind, but he now turned livid with passion.\nPresently this gave place to a strange look of triumph.\n\u2018Watson,\u2019 he said, \u2018that big fellow has for years taken the credit for my\nmost remarkable doings, but at last I have him \u2013 at last!\u2019 30\nUp I went to the ceiling, and when I returned the strangers were in the\nroom.\n\u2018I perceive, gentlemen,\u2019 said Mr. Sherlock Holmes, \u2018that you are at pres-\nent afflicted by an extraordinary novelty.\u2019\nThe handsomer of our visitors asked in amazement how he knew this, 35\nbut the big one only scowled.\n\u2018You forget that you wear a ring on your fourth finger,\u2019 replied Mr.\nHolmes calmly.\n87 sidelights on sherlock holmes\nI was about to jump to the ceiling when the big brute interposed.\n\u2018That Tommy-rot is all very well for the public, Holmes,\u2019 said he, \u2018but\nyou can drop it before me. And, Watson, if you go up to the ceiling again I\nshall make you stay there.\u2019\n5 Here I observed a curious phenomenon. My friend Sherlock Holmes\nshrank. He became small before my eyes. I looked longingly at the ceiling,\nbut dared not.\n\u2018Let us cut the first four pages,\u2019 said the big man, \u2018and proceed to busi-\nness. I want to know why \u2013 \u2019\n10 \u2018Allow me,\u2019 said Mr. Holmes, with some of his old courage. \u2018You want\nto know why the public does not go to your opera.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said the other ironically, \u2018as you perceive by my shirt stud.\u2019\nHe added more gravely, \u2018And as you can only find out in one way I must\ninsist on your witnessing an entire performance of the piece.\u2019\n15 It was an anxious moment for me. I shuddered, for I knew that if\nHolmes went I should have to go with him. But my friend had a heart of\ngold. \u2018Never,\u2019 he cried fiercely, \u2018I will do anything for you save that.\u2019\n\u2018Your continued existence depends on it,\u2019 said the big man menacingly.\n\u2018I would rather melt into air,\u2019 replied Holmes, proudly taking another\n20 chair. \u2018But I can tell you why the public don\u2019t go to your piece without\nsitting the thing out myself.\u2019\n\u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Because,\u2019 replied Holmes calmly, \u2018they prefer to stay away.\u2019\nA dead silence followed that extraordinary remark. For a moment the\n25 two intruders gazed with awe upon the man who had unravelled their\nmystery so wonderfully. Then drawing their knives \u2013\nHolmes grew less and less, until nothing was left save a ring of smoke\nwhich slowly circled to the ceiling.\nThe last words of great men are often noteworthy. These were the last\n30 words of Sherlock Holmes: \u2018Fool, fool! I have kept you in luxury for years.\nBy my help you have ridden extensively in cabs, where no author was ever\nseen before. Henceforth you will ride in buses!\u2019\nThe brute sunk into a chair aghast.\nThe other author did not turn a hair.\n35 To A. Conan Doyle, from his friend\nJ. M. Barrie.\nThis parody, the best of all the numerous parodies, may be taken as an\n88 chapter 11\nexample not only of the author\u2019s wit but of his debonnaire courage, for it\nwas written immediately after our joint failure which at the moment was\na bitter thought for both of us. There is indeed nothing more miserable\nthan a theatrical failure, for you feel how many others who have backed\nyou have been affected by it. It was, I am glad to say, my only experience 5\nof it, and I have no doubt that Barrie could say the same.\nBefore I leave the subject of the many impersonations of Holmes I\nmay say that all of them, and all the drawings, are very unlike my own\noriginal idea of the man. I saw him as very tall \u2013 \u2018over 6 feet, but so exces-\nsively lean that he seemed considerably taller,\u2019 said A Study in Scarlet. He 10\nhad, as I imagined him, a thin razor-like face, with a great hawks-bill of a\nnose, and two small eyes, set close together on either side of it. Such was\nmy conception. It chanced, however, that poor Sidney Paget who, before\nhis premature death, drew all the original pictures, had a younger brother\nwhose name, I think, was Walter, who served him as a model. The hand- 15\nsome Walter took the place of the more powerful but uglier Sherlock,\nand perhaps from the point of view of my lady readers it was as well. The\nstage has followed the type set up by the pictures.\nFilms of course were unknown when the stories appeared, and when\nthese rights were finally discussed and a small sum offered for them by a 20\nFrench Company it seemed treasure trove and I was very glad to accept.\nAfterwards I had to buy them back again at exactly ten times what I had\nreceived, so the deal was a disastrous one. But now they have been done\nby the Stoll Company with Eille Norwood as Holmes, and it was worth\nall the expense to get so fine a production. Norwood has since played the 25\npart on the stage and won the approbation of the London public. He has\nthat rare quality which can only be described as glamour, which compels\nyou to watch an actor eagerly even when he is doing nothing. He has the\nbrooding eye which excites expectation and he has also a quite unrivalled\npower of disguise. My only criticism of the films is that they introduce 30\ntelephones, motor cars and other luxuries of which the Victorian Holm-\nes never dreamed.\nPeople have often asked me whether I knew the end of a Holmes\nstory before I started it. Of course I do. One could not possibly steer\na course if one did not know one\u2019s destination. The first thing is to get 35\nyour idea. Having got that key idea one\u2019s next task is to conceal it and lay\nemphasis upon everything which can make for a different explanation.\nHolmes, however, can see all the fallacies of the alternatives, and arrives\n89 sidelights on sherlock holmes\nmore or less dramatically at the true solution by steps which he can de-\nscribe and justify. He shows his powers by what the South Americans\nnow call \u2018Sherlockholmitos,\u2019 which means clever little deductions, which\noften have nothing to do with the matter in hand, but impress the reader\n5 with a general sense of power. The same effect is gained by his offhand\nallusion to other cases. Heaven knows how many titles I have thrown\nabout in a casual way, and how many readers have begged me to satisfy\ntheir curiosity as to \u2018Rigoletto and his abominable wife,\u2019 \u2018The Adventure\nof the Tired Captain,\u2019 or \u2018The Curious Experience of the Patterson Fam-\n10 ily in the Island of Uffa.\u2019 Once or twice, as in \u2018The Adventure of the Sec-\nond Stain,\u2019 which in my judgment is one of the neatest of the stories, I did\nactually use the title years before I wrote a story to correspond.\nThere are some questions concerned with particular stories which\nturn up periodically from every quarter of the globe. In \u2018The Adventure\n15 of the Priory School\u2019 Holmes remarks in his offhand way that by looking\nat a bicycle track on a damp moor one can say which way it was heading.\nI had so many remonstrances upon this point, varying from pity to anger,\nthat I took out my bicycle and tried. I had imagined that the observa-\ntions of the way in which the track of the hind wheel overlaid the track\n20 of the front one when the machine was not running dead straight would\nshow the direction. I found that my correspondents were right and I was\nwrong, for this would be the same whichever way the cycle was moving.\nOn the other hand the real solution was much simpler, for on an undulat-\ning moor the wheels make a much deeper impression uphill and a more\n25 shallow one downhill, so Holmes was justified of his wisdom after all.\nSometimes I have got upon dangerous ground when I have taken\nrisks through my own want of knowledge of the correct atmosphere. I\nhave, for example, never been a racing man, and yet I ventured to write\n\u2018Silver Blaze,\u2019 in which the mystery depends upon the laws of training\n30 and racing. The story is all right, and Holmes may have been at the top\nof his form, but my ignorance cries aloud to heaven. I read an excellent\nand very damaging criticism of the story in some sporting paper, written\nclearly by a man who did know, in which he explained the exact penalties\nwhich would have come upon everyone concerned if they had acted as\n35 I described. Half would have been in jail and the other half warned off\nthe turf for ever. However, I have never been nervous about details, and\none must be masterful sometimes. When an alarmed Editor wrote to me\nonce: \u2018There is no second line of rails at that point,\u2019 I answered, \u2018I make\n90 chapter 11\none.\u2019 On the other hand, there are cases where accuracy is essential.\nI do not wish to be ungrateful to Holmes, who has been a good friend\nto me in many ways. If I have sometimes been inclined to weary of him\nit is because his character admits of no light or shade. He is a calculating\nmachine, and anything you add to that simply weakens the effect. Thus 5\nthe variety of the stories must depend upon the romance and compact\nhandling of the plots. I would say a word for Watson also, who in the\ncourse of seven volumes never shows one gleam of humour or makes\none single joke. To make a real character one must sacrifice everything\nto consistency and remember Goldsmith\u2019s criticism of Johnson that \u2018he 10\nwould make the little fishes talk like whales.\u2019\nI do not think that I ever realized what a living actual personality\nHolmes had become to the more guileless readers, until I heard of the\nvery pleasing story of the char-\u00e0-banc of French schoolboys who, when\nasked what they wanted to see first in London, replied unanimously that 15\nthey wanted to see Mr. Holmes\u2019 lodgings in Baker Street. Many have\nasked me which house it is, but that is a point which for excellent reasons\nI will not decide.\nThere are certain Sherlock Holmes stories, apocryphal I need not say,\nwhich go round and round the press and turn up at fixed intervals with 20\nthe regularity of a comet.\nOne is the story of the cabman who is supposed to have taken me\nto an hotel in Paris. \u2018Dr. Doyle,\u2019 he cried, gazing at me fixedly, \u2018I perceive\nfrom your appearance that you have been recently at Constantinople. I\nhave reason to think also that you have been at Buda, and I perceive some 25\nindication that you were not far from Milan.\u2019 \u2018Wonderful. Five francs for\nthe secret of how you did it?\u2019 \u2018I looked at the labels pasted on your trunk,\u2019\nsaid the astute cabby.\nAnother perennial is of the woman who is said to have consulted\nSherlock. \u2018I am greatly puzzled, sir. In one week I have lost a motor horn, 30\na brush, a box of golf balls, a dictionary and a bootjack. Can you explain\nit?\u2019 \u2018Nothing simpler, madame,\u2019 said Sherlock. \u2018It is clear that your neigh-\nbour keeps a goat.\u2019\nThere was a third about how Sherlock entered heaven, and by virtue\nof his power of observation at once greeted Adam, but the point is per- 35\nhaps too anatomical for further discussion.\nI suppose that every author receives a good many curious letters.\nCertainly I have done so. Quite a number of these have been from Rus-\n91 sidelights on sherlock holmes\nsia. When they have been in the vernacular I have been compelled to take\nthem as read, but when they have been in English they have been among\nthe most curious in my collection.\nThere was one young lady who began all her epistles with the words\n5 \u2018Good Lord.\u2019 Another had a large amount of guile underlying her sim-\nplicity. Writing from Warsaw, she stated that she had been bedridden for\ntwo years, and that my novels had been her only, etc., etc. So touched was\nI by this flattering statement that I at once prepared an autographed par-\ncel of them to complete the fair invalid\u2019s collection. By good luck, how-\n10 ever, I met a brother author on the same day to whom I recounted the\ntouching incident. With a cynical smile, he drew an identical letter from\nhis pocket.\nHis novels had also been for two years her only, etc., etc. I do not\nknow how many more the lady had written to; but if, as I imagine, her cor-\n15 respondence had extended to several countries, she must have amassed a\nrather interesting library.\nThe young Russian\u2019s habit of addressing me as \u2018Good Lord\u2019 had an\neven stranger parallel at home which links it up with the subject of this\narticle. Shortly after I received a knighthood, I had a bill from a trades-\n20 man which was quite correct and businesslike in every detail save that it\nwas made out to Sir Sherlock Holmes. I hope that I can stand a joke as\nwell as my neighbours, but this particular piece of humour seemed rather\nmisapplied and I wrote sharply upon the subject.\nIn response to my letter there arrived at my hotel a very repentant\n25 clerk, who expressed his sorrow at the incident, but kept on repeating the\nphrase, \u2018I assure you, sir, that it was bon\u00e2 fide.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean by bon\u00e2 fide?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018Well, sir,\u2019 he replied, \u2018my mates in the shop told me that you had been\nknighted, and that when a man was knighted he changed his name, and\n30 that you had taken that one.\u2019\nI need not say that my annoyance vanished, and that I laughed as\nheartily as his pals were probably doing round the corner.\nA few of the problems which have come my way have been very sim-\nilar to some which I had invented for the exhibition of the reasoning of\n35 Mr. Holmes. I might perhaps quote one in which that gentleman\u2019s meth-\nod of thought was copied with complete success. The case was as fol-\nlows: A gentleman had disappeared. He had drawn a bank balance of \u00a340\nwhich was known to be on him. It was feared that he had been murdered\n92 chapter 11\nfor the sake of the money. He had last been heard of stopping at a large\nhotel in London, having come from the country that day. In the evening\nhe went to a music-hall performance, came out of it about ten o\u2019clock, re-\nturned to his hotel, changed his evening clothes, which were found in his\nroom next day, and disappeared utterly. No one saw him leave the hotel, 5\nbut a man occupying a neighbouring room declared that he had heard\nhim moving during the night. A week had elapsed at the time that I was\nconsulted, but the police had discovered nothing. Where was the man?\nThese were the whole of the facts as communicated to me by his rel-\natives in the country. Endeavouring to see the matter through the eyes 10\nof Mr. Holmes, I answered by return mail that he was evidently either in\nGlasgow or in Edinburgh. It proved later that he had, as a fact, gone to\nEdinburgh, though in the week that had passed he had moved to another\npart of Scotland.\nThere I should leave the matter, for, as Dr. Watson has often shown, 15\na solution explained is a mystery spoiled. At this stage the reader can lay\ndown the book and show how simple it all is by working out the problem\nfor himself. He has all the data which were ever given to me. For the sake\nof those, however, who have no turn for such conundrums, I will try to\nindicate the links which make the chain. The one advantage which I pos- 20\nsessed was that I was familiar with the routine of London hotels \u2013 though\nI fancy it differs little from that of hotels elsewhere.\nThe first thing was to look at the facts and separate what was certain\nfrom what was conjecture. It was all certain except the statement of the\nperson who heard the missing man in the night. How could he tell such 25\na sound from any other sound in a large hotel? That point could be disre-\ngarded, if it traversed the general conclusions.\nThe first clear deduction was that the man had meant to disappear.\nWhy else should he draw all his money? He had got out of the hotel dur-\ning the night. But there is a night porter in all hotels, and it is impossible 30\nto get out without his knowledge when the door is once shut. The door\nis shut after the theatre-goers return \u2013 say at twelve o\u2019clock. Therefore,\nthe man left the hotel before twelve o\u2019clock. He had come from the mu-\nsic-hall at ten, had changed his clothes, and had departed with his bag.\nNo one had seen him do so. The inference is that he had done it at the 35\nmoment when the hall was full of the returning guests, which is from\neleven to eleven-thirty. After that hour, even if the door were still open,\nthere are few people coming and going so that he with his bag would\n93 sidelights on sherlock holmes\ncertainly have been seen.\nHaving got so far upon firm ground, we now ask ourselves why a man\nwho desires to hide himself should go out at such an hour. If he intended\nto conceal himself in London he need never have gone to the hotel at all.\n5 Clearly then he was going to catch a train which would carry him away.\nBut a man who is deposited by a train in any provincial station during the\nnight is likely to be noticed, and he might be sure that when the alarm was\nraised and his description given, some guard or porter would remem-\nber him. Therefore, his destination would be some large town which he\n10 would reach as a terminus where all his fellow passengers would disem-\nbark and where he would lose himself in the crowd. When one turns up\nthe timetable and sees that the great Scotch expresses bound for Edin-\nburgh and Glasgow start about midnight, the goal is reached. As for his\ndress-suit, the fact that he abandoned it proved that he intended to adopt\n15 a line of life where there were no social amenities. This deduction also\nproved to be correct.\nI quote such a case in order to show that the general lines of reason-\ning advocated by Holmes have a real practical application to life. In an-\nother case, where a girl had become engaged to a young foreigner who\n20 suddenly disappeared, I was able, by a similar process of deduction, to\nshow her very clearly both whither he had gone and how unworthy he\nwas of her affections.\nOn the other hand, these semi-scientific methods are occasionally\nlaboured and slow as compared with the results of the rough-and-ready,\n25 practical man. Lest I should seem to have been throwing bouquets ei-\nther to myself or to Mr. Holmes, let me state that on the occasion of a\nburglary of the village inn, within a stone-throw of my house, the village\nconstable, with no theories at all, had seized the culprit while I had got no\nfurther than that he was a left-handed man with nails in his boots.\n30 The unusual or dramatic effects which lead to the invocation of Mr.\nHolmes in fiction are, of course, great aids to him in reaching a conclu-\nsion. It is the case where there is nothing to get hold of which is the dead-\nly one. I heard of such a one in America which would certainly have pre-\nsented a formidable problem. A gentleman of blameless life starting off\n35 for a Sunday evening walk with his family, suddenly observed that he had\nforgotten something. He went back into the house, the door of which\nwas still open, and he left his people waiting for him outside. He never\nreappeared, and from that day to this there has been no clue as to what\n94 chapter 11\nbefell him. This was certainly one of the strangest cases of which I have\never heard in real life.\nAnother very singular case came within my own observation. It was\nsent to me by an eminent London publisher. This gentleman had in his\nemployment a head of department whose name we shall take as Mus- 5\ngrave. He was a hard-working person, with no special feature in his char-\nacter. Mr. Musgrave died, and several years after his death a letter was\nreceived addressed to him, in the care of his employers. It bore the post-\nmark of a tourist resort in the west of Canada, and had the note \u2018Confl-\nfilms\u2019 upon the outside of the envelope, with the words \u2018Report Sy\u2019 in 10\none corner.\nThe publishers naturally opened the envelope as they had no note of\nthe dead man\u2019s relatives. Inside were two blank sheets of paper. The letter,\nI may add, was registered. The publisher, being unable to make anything\nof this, sent it on to me, and I submitted the blank sheets to every possi- 15\nble chemical and heat test, with no result whatever. Beyond the fact that\nthe writing appeared to be that of a woman there is nothing to add to this\naccount. The matter was, and remains, an insoluble mystery. How the\ncorrespondent could have something so secret to say to Mr. Musgrave\nand yet not be aware that this person had been dead for several years is 20\nvery hard to understand \u2013 or why blank sheets should be so carefully reg-\nistered through the mail. I may add that I did not trust the sheets to my\nown chemical tests, but had the best expert advice without getting any\nresult. Considered as a case it was a failure \u2013 and a very tantalizing one.\nMr. Sherlock Holmes has always been a fair mark for practical jokers, 25\nand I have had numerous bogus cases of various degrees of ingenuity,\nmarked cards, mysterious warnings, cypher messages, and other curious\ncommunications. It is astonishing the amount of trouble which some\npeople will take with no object save a mystification. Upon one occasion,\nas I was entering the hall to take part in an amateur billiard competition, 30\nI was handed by the attendant a small packet which had been left for me.\nUpon opening it I found a piece of ordinary green chalk such as is used in\nbilliards. I was amused by the incident, and I put the chalk into my waist-\ncoat pocket and used it during the game. Afterward, I continued to use it\nuntil one day, some months later, as I rubbed the tip of my cue the face 35\nof the chalk crumbled in, and I found it was hollow. From the recess thus\nexposed I drew out a small slip of paper with the words \u2018From Arsene\nLupin to Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\n95 sidelights on sherlock holmes\nImagine the state of mind of the joker who took such trouble to ac-\ncomplish such a result.\nOne of the mysteries submitted to Mr. Holmes was rather upon the\npsychic plane and therefore beyond his powers. The facts as alleged are\n5 most remarkable, though I have no proof of their truth save that the lady\nwrote earnestly and gave both her name and address. The person, whom\nwe will call Mrs. Seagrave, had been given a curious secondhand ring,\nsnake-shaped, and dull gold. This she took from her finger at night. One\nnight she slept with it on and had a fearsome dream in which she seemed\n10 to be pushing off some furious creature which fastened its teeth into her\narm. On awakening, the pain in the arm continued, and next day the im-\nprint of a double set of teeth appeared upon the arm, with one tooth of\nthe lower jaw missing. The marks were in the shape of blue-black bruises\nwhich had not broken the skin.\n15 \u2018I do not know,\u2019 says my correspondent, \u2018what made me think the\nring had anything to do with the matter, but I took a dislike to the thing\nand did not wear it for some months, when, being on a visit, I took to\nwearing it again.\u2019 To make a long story short, the same thing happened,\nand the lady settled the matter for ever by dropping her ring into the hot-\n20 test corner of the kitchen range. This curious story, which I believe to be\ngenuine, may not be as supernatural as it seems. It is well known that in\nsome subjects a strong mental impression does produce a physical effect.\nThus a very vivid nightmare dream with the impression of a bite might\nconceivably produce the mark of a bite. Such cases are well attested in\n25 medical annals. The second incident would, of course, arise by uncon-\nscious suggestion from the first. None the less, it is a very interesting little\nproblem, whether psychic or material.\nBuried treasures are naturally among the problems which have come\nto Mr. Holmes. One genuine case was accompanied by a diagram here\n30 reproduced. It refers to an Indiaman which was wrecked upon the South\nAfrican coast in the year 1782. If I were a younger man, I should be seri-\nously inclined to go personally and look into the matter.\nThe ship contained a remarkable treasure, including, I believe, the\nold crown regalia of Delhi. It is surmised that they buried these near the\n35 coast, and that this chart is a note of the spot. Each Indiaman in those\ndays had its own semaphore code, and it is conjectured that the three\nmarks upon the left are signals from a three-armed semaphore. Some re-\ncord of their meaning might perhaps even now be found in the old pa-\n96 chapter 11\npers of the India Office. The circle upon the right gives the compass bear-\nings. The larger semi-circle may be the curved edge of a reef or of a rock.\nThe figures above are the indications how to reach the X which marks the\ntreasure. Possibly they may give the bearings as 186 feet from the 4 upon\nthe semi-circle. The scene of the wreck is a lonely part of the country, but 5\nI shall be surprised if sooner or later, someone does not seriously set to\nwork to solve the mystery \u2013 indeed at the present moment (1923) there\nis a small company working to that end.\n10\n15\nIt seems strange to me to hear that the original edition of Sherlock\nHolmes is now selling at about twenty pounds. I wish I had laid in a few 20\nof them. There is another book of mine which might increase in value as\na curiosity when the story is told. That is the illustrated edition of The\nLost World. In rather an impish mood I set myself to make the pictures in\nthat book realistic. I and two friends made ourselves up to resemble the\nmembers of the mythical exploring party, and were photographed at a 25\ntable spread with globes and instruments. I was made up by Clarkson to\nresemble Challenger, and the disguises were on the whole very adequate.\nI had an amusing morning touring London in a cab and calling upon\none or two friends in the character of their lost uncle from Borneo. I also\nmade two faked photographs of the plateau, and altogether the pictures 30\nof the book were quite unique. So far as I know, however, they excited no\nattention whatever, and certainly no one detected that behind the beard\nof Challenger lurked the author himself. It was an entirely new departure\nin book illustration, and was at least original.\n97 Chapter 12\nNORWOOD AND SWITZERLAND\n5 Psychic Leanings \u2013 Young Writers \u2013 Story of Waterloo \u2013 A Cruel Blow \u2013\nAmerican Lecturing in 1894 \u2013 Major Pond \u2013 First Lecture \u2013 Anti-British\nWave \u2013 A Prophecy.\nThe chief event of our Norwood life was the birth of my son Kingsley,\n10 who lived to play a man\u2019s part in the Great War, was badly wounded and\ndied shortly before its conclusion. My own life was so busy that I had lit-\ntle time for religious development, but my thoughts still ran much upon\npsychic matters, and it was at this time that I joined the Psychical Re-\nsearch Society, of which I am now one of the senior members. I had few\n15 psychic experiences myself, and my material philosophy, as expressed in\nThe Stark Munro Letters, which were written just at the end of the Nor-\nwood period, was so strong that it did not easily crumble. Yet as year by\nyear I read the wonderful literature of psychic science and experience, I\nbecame more and more impressed by the strength of the Spiritualist po-\n20 sition and by the levity and want of all dignity, accurate knowledge and\nintellectual honesty which characterized the attitude of its opponents.\nThe religious side of the matter had not yet struck me, but I felt more and\nmore that the case for the phenomena vouched for by such men as Sir\nWilliam Crookes, Barrett, Russel Wallace, Victor Hugo and Z\u00f6llner was\n25 so strong that I could see no answer to their exact record of observations.\n\u2018It is incredible but it is true,\u2019 said Crookes, and the aphorism seemed to\nexactly express my dawning convictions. I had a weekly impulse from\nthe psychic paper, Light, which has, I maintain, during its long career and\nup to the present day, presented as much brain to the square inch as any\n30 journal published in these islands.\nMy pleasant recollection of those days from 1891 to 1893 lay in my\nfirst introduction, as a more or less rising author, to the literary life of\nLondon. It is extraordinary to remember that at that time there was a\ngeneral jeremiad in the London press about the extinction of English lit-\n35 erature, and the assumed fact that there were no rising authors to take the\nplace of those who were gone. The real fact is that there was a most amaz-\ning crop, all coming up simultaneously, presenting perhaps no Dickens\nor Thackeray, but none the less so numerous and many sided and with so\n98 chapter 12\nhigh an average of achievement that I think they would match for varied\nexcellence any similar harvest in our literary history. It was during the\nyears roughly from 1888 to 1893 that Rudyard Kipling, James Stephen\nPhillips, Watson, Grant Allen, Wells, Barrie, Bernard Shaw, H. A. Jones,\nPinero, Marie Corelli, Stanley Weyman, Anthony Hope, Hall Caine, and 5\na whole list of others were winning their spurs. Many of these men I met\nin the full flush of their youth and their powers. Of some of them I will\nspeak more fully later. As to the old school they were certainly somewhat\nof a declension, and the newcomers found no very serious opposition\nin gaining a hearing. Wilkie Collins, Trollope, George Eliot and Charles 10\nReade had passed. I have always been a very great admirer of the last,\nwho was really a great innovator as well as a most dramatic writer, for it\nwas he who first introduced realism and founded his stories upon care-\nfully arranged documents. He was the literary father of Zola. George El-\niot has never appealed to me much, for I like my effects in a less leisurely 15\nfashion; but Trollope also I consider to be a very original writer, though I\nfancy he traces his ancestry through Jane Austen. No writer is ever abso-\nlutely original. He always joins at some point on to that old tree of which\nhe is a branch.\nOf the literary men whom I met at that time my most vivid recollec- 20\ntions are of the group who centred round the new magazine, The Idler,\nwhich had been started by Jerome K. Jerome, who had deservedly shot\ninto fame with his splendidly humorous Three Men in a Boat. It has all the\nexuberance and joy of life which youth brings with it, and even now if I\nhave ever time to be at all sad, which is seldom enough, I can laugh away 25\nthe shadows when I open that book. Jerome is a man who, like most hu-\nmourists, has a very serious side to his character, as all who have seen The\nThird Floor Back will acknowledge, but he was inclined to be hothead-\ned and intolerant in political matters, from pure earnestness of purpose,\nwhich alienated some of his friends. He was associated in the editorship 30\nof The Idler with Robert Barr, a volcanic Anglo- or rather Scot-American,\nwith a violent manner, a wealth of strong adjectives, and one of the kind-\nest of natures underneath it all. He was one of the best raconteurs I have\never known, and as a writer I have always felt that he did not quite come\ninto his own. George Burgin, like some quaint gentle character from 35\nDickens, was the sub-editor, and Barrie, Zangwill, and many other rising\nmen were among the contributors who met periodically at dinner. I was\nnot unfaithful to The Strand, but there were some contributions which\n99 norwood and switzerland\nthey did not need, and with these I established my connection with The\nIdler. It was at this time and in this way that I met James Barrie, of whom\nI shall have more to say when I come to that chapter which treats of some\neminent and interesting men whom I have known.\n5 Two isolated facts stand out in my memory during that time at Nor-\nwood. One was that there seemed to be an imminent danger of war with\nFrance and that I applied for the Mediterranean war-correspondentship\nof the Central News, guessing that the chief centre of activity and interest\nwould be in that quarter. I got the appointment and was all ready to start,\n10 but fortunately the crisis passed. The second was my first venture in the\ndrama. I had written a short story called \u2018A Straggler of \u201915,\u2019 which had\nseemed to me to be a moving picture of an old soldier and his ways. My\nown eyes were moist as I wrote it and that is the surest way to moisten\nthose of others. I now turned this into a one-act play, and, greatly daring,\n15 I sent it to Henry Irving, of whose genius I had been a fervent admirer\never since those Edinburgh days when I had paid my sixpence for the\ngallery night after night to see him in Hamlet and The Lyons Mail. To my\ngreat delight I had a pleasing note from Bram Stoker, the great man\u2019s sec-\nretary, offering me \u00a3100 for the copyright. It was a good bargain for him,\n20 for it is not too much to say that Corporal Gregory Brewster became one\nof his stock parts and it had the enormous advantage that the older he got\nthe more naturally he played it. The house laughed and sobbed, exactly as\nI had done when I wrote it. Several critics went out of their way to explain\nthat the merit lay entirely with the great actor and had nothing to do with\n25 the indifferent play, but as a matter of fact the last time I saw it acted it\nwas by a real corporal from a military camp, in the humble setting of a\nvillage hall and it had exactly the same effect upon the audience which\nIrving produced at the Lyceum. So perhaps there was something in the\nwriting after all, and certainly every stage effect was indicated in the man-\n30 uscript. I would add that with his characteristic largeness in money mat-\nters Irving always sent me a guinea for each performance in spite of his\npurchase of the copyright. Henry Irving the son carried on the part and\nplayed it, in my opinion, better than the father. I can well remember the\nflush of pleasure on his face when I uttered the word \u2018better\u2019 and how he\n35 seized my hand. I have no doubt it was trying for his great powers to be\ncontinually belittled by their measurement with those of his giant father,\nto whom he bore so remarkable a physical resemblance. His premature\ndeath was a great loss to the stage, as was that of his brother Lawrence,\n100 chapter 12\ndrowned with his wife in the great Canadian river of the same name as\nhimself.\nI now come to the great misfortune which darkened and deflected\nour lives. I have said that my wife and I had taken a tour in Switzerland.\nI do not know whether she had overtaxed herself in this excursion, or 5\nwhether we encountered microbes in some inn bedroom, but the fact re-\nmains that within a few weeks of our return she complained of pain in her\nside and cough. I had no suspicion of anything serious, but sent for the\nnearest good physician. To my surprise and alarm he told me when he\ndescended from the bedroom that the lungs were very gravely affected, 10\nthat there was every sign of rapid consumption and that he thought the\ncase a most serious one with little hope, considering her record and fam-\nily history, of a permanent cure. With two children, aged four and one,\nand a wife who was in such deadly danger, the situation was a difficult\none. I confirmed the diagnosis by having Sir Douglas Powell down to see 15\nher, and I then set all my energy to work to save the situation. The home\nwas abandoned, the newly bought furniture was sold, and we made for\nDavos in the High Alps where there seemed the best chance of killing\nthis accursed microbe which was rapidly eating out her vitals.\nAnd we succeeded. When I think that the attack was one of what is 20\ncalled \u2018galloping consumption\u2019, and that the doctors did not give more\nthan a few months, and yet that we postponed the fatal issue from 1893\nto 1906, I think it is proof that the successive measures were wise. The\ninvalid\u2019s life was happy too, for it was necessarily spent in glorious scen-\nery. It was seldom marred by pain, and it was sustained by that optimism 25\nwhich is peculiar to the disease, and which came naturally to her quietly\ncontented nature.\nAs there were no particular social distractions at Davos, and as our\nlife was bounded by the snow and fir which girt us in, I was able to de-\nvote myself to doing a good deal of work and also to taking up with some 30\nenergy the winter sports for which the place is famous. Whilst there I\nbegan the Brigadier Gerard series of stories, founded largely upon that\ngreat book, The Memoirs of General Marbot. This entailed a great deal\nof research into Napoleonic days, and my military detail was, I think,\nvery accurate \u2013 so much so that I had a warm letter of appreciation from 35\nArchibald Forbes, the famous war correspondent, who was himself a\ngreat Napoleonic and military student. Before the end of the winter we\nwere assured that the ravages of the disease had been checked. I dared\n101 norwood and switzerland\nnot return to England, however, for fear of a relapse, so with the summer\nwe moved on to Maloja, another health resort at the end of the Engadine\nvalley, and there we endeavoured to hold all we had won \u2013 which, with\noccasional relapses, we succeeded in doing.\n5 My sister Lottie, free at last from the work which she had so brave-\nly done, had now joined us. Connie, the younger sister, had come back\nfrom Portugal earlier, and had joined us at Norwood, where she had met\nand eventually married E. W. Hornung the novelist. Of Hornung I will\nspeak later. In the meantime Lottie\u2019s presence and the improvement of\n10 the invalid, which was so marked that no sudden crisis was thought at all\npossible, gave me renewed liberty of action. Before the catastrophe oc-\ncurred I had given some lectures on literature at home, and the work with\nits movement and bustle was not distasteful to me. Now I was strongly\npressed to go to America on the same errand, and in the late autumn of\n15 1894 I set out on this new adventure.\nMy brother Innes, he who had shared my first days in Southsea,\nhad since passed through Richmond Public School, and afterwards the\nWoolwich Academy, so that he was now just emerging as a subaltern.\nAs I needed some companion, and as I thought that the change would\n20 do him good, I asked him to come with me to the States. We crossed on\nthe ill-fated German liner Elbe, which a very short time afterwards was\nsunk after collision with a collier in the North Sea. Already I observed\nevidence of that irrational hatred of the British which in the course of\ntwenty years was to lead to so terrific a result involving the destruction\n25 of the German Empire. I remember that on some f\u00eate day on board, the\nsaloon was thickly decorated with German and American flags without\none single British one, though a fair proportion of the passengers were\nBritish. Innes and I then and there drew a Union Jack and stuck it up\naloft, where its isolation drew attention to our grievance.\n30 Major Pond was my impresario in America, and a quaint character\nhe was. He seemed the very personification of his country, huge, loose\nlimbed, straggling, with a goat\u2019s beard and a nasal voice. He had fought\nin the Civil War and been mixed up with every historical American event\nof his lifetime.\n35 He was a good, kind fellow and we formed a friendship which was\nnever broken. He met us in the docks, and carried us off to a little hotel\nbeside the Aldine Club, a small literary club, in which we had our meals.\nI have treated America and my impression of that amazing and per-\n102 chapter 12\nplexing country in later pages of these memoirs, when I visited it under\nmore detached conditions. At present it was all hard work with little time\nfor general observations. Pond had fixed me up a pretty hard schedule,\nbut on the other hand I had bargained to get back to Davos in time to\nspend Christmas with my wife, so that there was a limit to my servitude. 5\nMy first reading was given in a fashionable Baptist Church, which was\nthe usual launching slip for Pond\u2019s new lecturers. We had walked from\nthe retiring-room and were just coming in sight of the audience when I\nfelt something tickle my ear. I put up my hand and found that my collar\nwas undone, my tie had fallen off, and my stud, the first cause of all the 10\ntrouble, had disappeared. Standing there, on the edge of the platform,\nPond dragged out his own stud. I replaced everything, and sailed on\nquite as I should be, while Pond retired to refit. It is strange, and possibly\nmore than coincidence, how often one is prevented at the last moment\nfrom making some foolish appearance in public. 15\nThe readings went very well and the audience was generous in ap-\nplause. I have my own theory of reading, which is that it should be en-\ntirely disassociated from acting and should be made as natural and also as\naudible as possible. Such a presentment is, I am sure, the less tiring for an\naudience. Indeed I read to them exactly as in my boyhood I used to read 20\nto my mother. I gave extracts from recent British authors, including some\nwork of my own, and as I mixed up the grave and the gay I was able to\nkeep them mildly entertained for an hour. Some papers maintained that I\ncould not read at all, but I think that what they really meant was that I did\nnot act at all. Others seemed to endorse my method. Anyhow I had an 25\nexcellent first reception and Pond told me that he lay smiling all night af-\nter it. He had no difficulty afterwards in booking as many engagements as\nhe could fit into the time. I visited every town of any size between Boston\nin the north and Washington in the south, while Chicago and Milwaukee\nmarked my western limit. 30\nSometimes I found that it took me all my time to fit in the engage-\nments, however fast I might travel. Once, for example, I lectured at Daly\u2019s\nTheatre in New York at a matin\u00e9e, at Princeton College the same evening,\nsome 100 miles away, and at Philadelphia next afternoon. It was no won-\nder that I got very tired \u2013 the more so as the exuberant hospitality in 35\nthose pre-prohibition days was enough in itself to take the energies out\nof the visitor. It was all done in kindness, but it was dangerous for a man\nwho had his work to do. I had one little break when I paid a pleasant visit\n103 norwood and switzerland\nto Rudyard Kipling, of which I shall speak later. Bar those few days I was\ngoing hard all the time, and it is no wonder that I was so tired out that I\nkept to my bunk most of the way from New York to Liverpool.\nMy memories are the confused ones of a weary man. I recall one\n5 amusing incident when as I bustled on to the stage at Daly\u2019s Theatre I\ntripped over the wooden sill of the stage door, with the result that I came\ncantering down the sloping stage towards the audience, shedding books\nand papers on my way. There was much laughter and a general desire for\nan encore.\n10 Our visit was marred by one of those waves of anti-British feeling\nwhich sweep occasionally over the States, and which emanate from their\nown early history, every grievance being exaggerated and inflamed by the\nconstant hostility of Irish pressmen and politicians. It all seems very ab-\nsurd and contemptible to the travelling Briton, because he is aware how\n15 entirely one-sided it is, and how welcome, for example, is the American\nflag in every British public display. This was not known by the home-stay-\ning American, and probably he imagined that his own country was treated\nas rudely by us as ours by his. The Dunraven yacht race had given addi-\ntional acerbity to this chronic ill-feeling, and it was very active at the time\n20 of our visit. I remember that a banquet was given to us at a club at Detroit\nat which the wine flowed freely, and which ended by a speech by one of\nour hosts in which he bitterly attacked the British Empire. My brother\nand I, with one or two Canadians who were present, were naturally much\naffronted, but we made every allowance for the lateness of the evening. I\n25 asked leave, however, to reply to the speech, and some of those who were\npresent have assured me that they have never forgotten what I said. In the\ncourse of my remarks I said: \u2018You Americans have lived up to now within\nyour own palings, and know nothing of the real world outside. But now\nyour land is filled up, and you will be compelled to mix more with the\n30 other nations. When you do so you will find that there is only one which\ncan at all understand your ways and your aspirations, or will have the least\nsympathy. That is the mother country which you are now so fond of in-\nsulting. She is an Empire, and you will soon be an Empire also, and only\nthen will you understand each other, and you will realize that you have\n35 only one real friend in the world.\u2019 It was only two or three years later that\nthere came the Cuban war, the episode of Manilla Bay where the British\nCommander joined up with the Americans against the Germans, and sev-\neral other incidents which proved the truth of my remarks.\n104 chapter 12\nA writer of average income is bound to lose pecuniarily upon a lec-\nture tour, even in America, unless he prolongs it very much and works\nvery hard indeed. By losing I do not mean that he is actually out of pock-\net, but that he could have earned far more if he had never gone outside\nhis own study. In my own case I found after our joint expenses were paid 5\nthat there was about \u00a31,000 over. The disposal of this money furnished\na curious example of the power of prayer, which, as Mr. S. S. McClure\nhas already narrated it, I have no delicacy in telling. He tells how he was\nendeavouring to run his magazine, how he was down to his last farthing,\nhow he dropped on his knees on the office floor to pray for help, and how 10\non the same day an Englishman who was a mere acquaintance walked\ninto the office, and said: \u2018McClure, I believe in you and in the future of\nyour magazine,\u2019 and put down \u00a31,000 on the table. A critic might perhaps\nobserve that under such circumstances to sell 1,000 shares at face value\nwas rather hard upon the ignorant and trusting buyer. For a long time I 15\ncould clearly see the workings of Providence as directed towards Sam\nMcClure, but could not quite get their perspective as regards myself, but\nI am bound to admit that in the long run, after many vicissitudes, the deal\nwas justified both ways, and I was finally able to sell my holding twenty\nyears later at a reasonable advance. The immediate result, however, was 20\nthat I returned to Davos with all my American earnings locked up, and\nwith no actual visible result of my venture.\nThe Davos season was in full blast when I returned, and my wife was\nholding her own well. It was at this time, in the early months of 1895,\nthat I developed ski-running in Switzerland as described in my chapter 25\non Sport. We lingered late at Davos, so late that I was able to lay out a\ngolf course, which was hampered in its start by the curious trick the cows\nhad of chewing up the red flags. From Davos we finally moved to Caux,\nover the lake of Geneva, where for some months I worked steadily at my\nwriting. With the autumn I visited England, leaving the ladies at Caux, 30\nand it was then that events occurred which turned our road of life to a\nnew angle.\n105 Chapter 13\nEGYPT IN 1896\n5 Life in Egypt \u2013 Accident \u2013 The Men who made Egypt \u2013 Up the Nile \u2013 The\nSalt Lakes \u2013 Adventure in the Desert \u2013 The Coptic Monastery \u2013 Colonel\nLewis \u2013 A Surprise.\nThe wretched microbe which had so completely disorganized our\n10 lives, and which had produced all the sufferings so patiently borne, now\nseemed to be latent, and it was hoped that if we spent a winter in Egypt\nthe cure might be complete. During this short visit to England, whither I\nhad to rush every now and again in order to adjust my affairs, I met Grant\nAllen at luncheon, and he told me that he had also suffered from con-\n15 sumption and that he had found his salvation in the soil and air of Hind-\nhead in Surrey. It was quite a new idea to me that we might actually live\nwith impunity in England once more, and it was a pleasant thought after\nresigning oneself to a life which was unnatural to both of us at foreign\nhealth resorts. I acted very promptly, for I rushed down to Hindhead,\n20 bought an admirable plot of ground, put the architectural work into the\nhands of my old friend and fellow psychic researcher Mr. Ball of South-\nsea, and saw the builder chosen and everything in train before leaving\nEngland in the autumn of 1895. If Egypt was a success, we should have\na roof of our own to which to return. The thought of it brought renewed\n25 hope to the sufferer.\nI then set forth, picked up my wife and my sister Lottie at Caux and\ntook them on by easy stages through Italy, stopping a few days at Rome,\nand so to Brindisi, where we picked up a boat for Egypt. Once at Cairo\nwe took up our quarters at the Mena Hotel, in the very shadow of the\n30 Pyramids, and there we settled down for the winter. I was still doing the\nBrigadier Gerard stories at the time, which required a good deal of histor-\nical research, but I had brought my materials with me, and all I lacked was\nthe energy, which I found it most difficult to find in that enervating land.\nOn the whole it was a pleasant winter and led up to a most unfore-\n35 seen climax. I ascended the Great Pyramid once, and was certainly never\ntempted to do so again, and was content to watch the struggles of the\nendless drove of tourists who attempted that uncomfortable and useless\nfeat. There was golf of sorts and there was riding. I was still an immature\n106 chapter 13\nhorseman, but I felt that only practice would help me, so I set forth upon\nweird steeds provided by the livery stables opposite. As a rule they erred\non the side of dullness, but I have a very vivid recollection of one which\nrestored the average. If my right eyelid drops somewhat over my eye it is\nnot the result of philosophic brooding, but it is the doing of a black devil 5\nof a horse with a varminty head, slab-sided ribs and restless ears. I dis-\nliked the look of the beast, and the moment I threw my leg over him he\ndashed off as if it were a race. Away we went across the desert, I with one\nfoot in the stirrup, holding on as best I might. It is possible I could have\nkept on until he was weary, but he came suddenly on cultivated land and 10\nhis forelegs sank in a moment over his fetlocks. The sudden stop threw\nme over his head, but I held on to the bridle, and he, pawing about with\nhis front hoofs, struck me over the eye, and made a deep star-shaped\nwound which covered me with blood. I led him back and a pretty sight I\npresented as I appeared before the crowded verandah! Five stitches were 15\nneeded, but I was thankful, for very easily I might have lost my sight.\nMy wife was well enough now to join in society, while my sister was\njust at an age to enjoy it, so that we saw a little of the very jovial life of\nCairo, though the fact that Mena is some 7 miles out, on the most mo-\nnotonous road in the world, saved us from any excess. It was always a task 20\nto get in and out, so that only a great temptation would draw us. I joined\nin male society, however, a good deal and learned to know many of those\ngreat men who were shaping the new destinies of Egypt. I sketched some\nof them at the time in two paragraphs which may be quoted.\n\u2018There is a broad and comfortable sofa in the hall of the Turf Club, 25\nand if you sit there about luncheon time you will see a fair sprinkling of\nAnglo-Egyptians, men who have helped to make, and are still helping to\nmake, the history of our times. You have a view of the street from where\nyou are, and perhaps in the brilliant sunshine a carriage flies past with two\nrunning syces before it and an English coachman upon the box. Within, 30\none catches a glimpse of a strong florid face with a close-cropped soldier-\nly grey moustache, the expression good-humoured and inscrutable. This\nis Lord Cromer, whom Egypt has changed from a major of gunners to a\npeer of the realm, while he in turn has changed it from a province of the\nEast to one of the West. One has but to look at him to read the secret of 35\nhis success as a diplomatist. His clear head, his brave heart, his physical\nhealth, and his nerves of iron are all impressed upon you even in that\nmomentary glance at his carriage. And that lounging ennuy\u00e9 attitude is\n107 egypt in 1896\ncharacteristic also \u2013 most characteristic at this moment, when few men\nin the world can have more pressing responsibility upon their shoulders.\nIt is what one could expect from the man who at the most critical mo-\nment of recent Egyptian history is commonly reported to have brought\n5 diplomatic interviews to an abrupt conclusion with the explanation that\nthe time had come for his daily lawn-tennis engagement. It is no won-\nder that so strong a representative should win the confidence of his own\ncountrymen, but he has made as deep an impression upon the native\nmind, which finds it difficult under this veiled Protectorate of ours to\n10 estimate the comparative strength of individuals. \u201cSuppose Khedive tell\nLord Cromer go, Lord Cromer go?\u201d asked my donkey-boy, and so put his\nchocolate finger upon the central point of the whole situation.\n\u2018But this is a digression from the Turf Club, where you are seated\nupon a settee in the hall and watching the Englishmen who have done\n15 so much to regenerate Egypt. Of all the singular experiences of this most\nvenerable land, surely this rebuilding at the hands of a little group of\nbustling, clear-headed Anglo-Saxons is the most extraordinary. There\nare Garstin and Wilcocks, the great water captains who have coaxed the\nNile to right and to left, until the time seems to be coming when none\n20 of its waters will ever reach the Mediterranean at all. There is Kitchen-\ner, tall and straight, a grim silent soldier, with a weal of a Dervish bullet\nupon his face. There you may see Rogers, who stamped out the cholera,\nScott, who reformed the law, Palmer, who relieved the over-taxed fella-\nheen, Hooker, who exterminated the locusts, Wingate, who knows more\n25 than any European of the currents of feeling in the Soudan \u2013 the same\nWingate who reached his arm out a thousand miles and plucked Slatin\nout of Khartoum. And beside him the small man with the yellow-brown\nmoustache and the cheery, ruddy face is Slatin himself, whose one wish\nin the world now is to have the Khalifa at his sword-point \u2013 that Khalifa\n30 at whose heels he had to run for so many weary years.\u2019\nShortly after the opening of the New Year of 1896 we went in one of\nCook\u2019s boats up the river, getting as far as the outposts of civilization at\nWady Halfa. The banks in the upper reaches were not too safe, as raiders\non camels came down at times, but on the water one was secure from\n35 all the chances of Fate. At the same time I thought that the managers of\nthese tours took undue risks, and when I found myself on one occasion\non the rock of Abousir with a drove of helpless tourists, male and female,\nnothing whatever between us and the tribesmen, and a river between us\n108 chapter 13\nand the nearest troops, I could not but think what an appalling situation\nwould arise if a little troop of these far-riding camel men were to appear.\nWe had four negro soldiers as an escort, who would be helpless before any\nnormal raiding party. It was the strong impression which I there received\nwhich gave me the idea of taking a group of people of different types and 5\nworking out what the effect of so horrible an experience would be upon\neach. This became The Tragedy of the Korosko, published in America as A\nDesert Drama and afterwards dramatized by me as The Fires of Fate. All\nwent well as a matter of fact, but I thought then, and experienced British\nofficers agreed with me, that it was unjustifiable. As the whole frontier 10\nforce was longing for an excuse to advance, I am not sure that they would\nnot have welcomed it if the Dervishes had risen to the ground bait which\nevery week in the same place was laid in front of them.\nI do not know how many temples we explored during that tour, but\nthey seemed to me endless, some dating back to the mists of antiquity 15\nand some as recent as Cleopatra and the Roman period. The majestic\ncontinuity of Egyptian History seems to be its most remarkable feature.\nYou examine the tombs of the First Dynasty at Abydos and there you see\ncarved deep in the stone the sacred hawk, the goose, the plover, the signs\nof Horus and Osiris, of Upper and Lower Egypt. These were carved long 20\nbefore the Pyramids were built and can hardly be less ancient than 4000\nB.C. Then you inspect a temple built by the Ptolemies, after the date of\nAlexander the Great, and there you see the same old symbols cut in the\nsame old way. There is nothing like this in the world. The Roman and\nthe British Empires are mushrooms in comparison. Judged by Egyptian 25\nstandards the days of Alfred the Great would be next door to our own,\nand our customs, symbols and way of thinking the same. The race seems\nto have petrified, and how they could do so without being destroyed by\nsome more virile nation is hard to understand.\nTheir arts seem to have been high but their reasoning power in many 30\nways contemptible. The recent discovery of the King\u2019s tomb near Thebes\n\u2013 I write in 1924 \u2013 shows how wonderful were their decorations and the\namenities of their lives. But consider the tomb itself. What a degraded\nintelligence does it not show! The idea that the body, the old outworn\ngreatcoat which was once wrapped round the soul, should at any cost 35\nbe preserved is the last word in materialism. And the hundred baskets\nof provisions to feed the soul upon its journey! I can never believe that a\npeople with such ideas could be other than emasculated in their minds\n109 egypt in 1896\n\u2013 the fate of every nation which comes under the rule of a priesthood.\nIt had been suggested that I should go out to the Salt Lakes in the\nDesert some 50 miles from Cairo, and see the old Coptic Monastery\nthere. Those ancient monasteries, the abode alternately of saints and per-\n5 verts \u2013 we saw specimens of each \u2013 have always aroused my keen interest,\ndating as they do to very early days of Christianity. Indeed, their date is\noften unknown, but everything betokens great age and the spirit which\nfounded them seems to have been that of the hermits who in the third\nand fourth centuries swarmed in these wildernesses.\n10 Leaving my wife at Mena, I went with Colonel Lewis of the Egyp-\ntian army, an excellent companion and guide. On arriving at a wayside\nstation, we found a most amazing vehicle awaiting us, a sort of circus\ncoach, all gilding and frippery. It proved to be the coach of State which\nhad been prepared for Napoleon III on the chance that he would come\n15 to open the Suez Canal. It was surely a good bit of work, for here it was\nstill strong and fit, but absurdly out of place in the majestic simplicity of\nthe Libyan Desert.\nInto this we got and set forth, the only guide being wheel-marks\nacross the sand which in some of the harder places were almost invisible.\n20 The great sand waste rolled in yellow billows all around us, and far behind\nus the line of green trees marked the course of the Nile. Once a black dot\nappeared which, as it grew nearer, proved to be some sort of Oriental on\nfoot. As he came up to us he opened a blackened mouth, pointed to it,\nand cried, \u2018Moya! Moya!\u2019 which means water. We had none and could\n25 only point encouragingly to the green belt behind us, on which with a\ncurse he staggered upon his way.\nA surprising adventure befell us, for the heavens suddenly clouded\nover and rain began to fall, an almost unknown thing in those parts. We\nlumbered on, however, with our two horses, while Colonel Lewis, who\n30 was keen on getting fit, ran behind. I remember saying to him that in my\nwildest dreams I never thought that I should drive across the Libyan De-\nsert in an Emperor\u2019s coach with a full colonel as carriage dog. Presently\nin the fading light the horses slowed down, the Nubian driver descended,\nand began alternately scanning the ground and making gestures of de-\n35 spair. We realized then that he had lost the tracks and therefore that we\nhad no notion where we were, though we had strong reasons to believe\nthat we were to the south of the route. The difficulty was to know which\nwas north and which south. It was an awkward business since we had\n110 chapter 13\nno food or water and could see no end to our troubles. The further we\nmoved the deeper we should be involved. Night had closed in, and I was\nlooking up at the drifting scud above us when in the chink of two clouds I\nsaw for an instant a cluster of stars, and made sure that they were the four\nwheels of Charles\u2019s Wain. I am no astronomer, but I reasoned that this 5\nconstellation would lie to the north of us, and so it proved, for when we\nheaded that way, examining the ground every hundred yards or so with\nmatches, we came across the track once more.\nOur adventures, however, were not over, and it was all like a queer\ndream. We had great difficulty in keeping the track in the darkness, and 10\nthe absurd coach lumbered and creaked while we walked with lanterns\nahead of it. Suddenly to our joy we saw a bright light in the gloom. We\nquickened our pace, and came presently to a tent with a florid-bearded\nman seated outside it beside a little table where he was drawing by the\nlight of a lamp. The rain had cleared now, but the sky was still overcast. 15\nIn answer to our hail this man rather gruffly told us that he was a Ger-\nman surveyor at work in the desert. He motioned with his hand when\nwe told him whither we were bound, and said it was close by. After leav-\ning him we wandered on, and losing the tracks we were again very badly\nbushed. It seemed an hour or two before to our joy we saw a light ahead 20\nand prepared for a night\u2019s rest at the halfway house, which was our im-\nmediate destination. But when we reached the light what we saw was a\nflorid bearded man sitting outside a small tent with a lamp upon a table.\nWe had moved in a circle. Fresh explanations \u2013 and this time we really\ndid keep to the track and reached a big deserted wooden hut, where we 25\nput up the horses, ate some cold food, and tumbled, very tired, into two\nof the bunks which lined it.\nThe morrow made amends for all. It broke cold and clear and I have\nseldom felt a greater sense of exhilaration than when I awoke and walk-\ning out before dressing saw the whole endless desert stretching away on 30\nevery side of me, yellow sand and black rock, to the blue shimmering\nhorizon. We harnessed up and within a few hours came on the Natron\nLake, a great salt lake, with a few scattered houses at one end where the\nworkers dry out and prepare the salt. A couple of miles off was the lonely\nmonastery which we had come to see \u2013 less lonely now, but before the 35\nsalt works were established one of the most inaccessible places one could\nimagine. It consisted of a huge outer wall, which seemed to be made of\nhardened clay. It had no doors or windows save one little opening which\n111 egypt in 1896\ncould be easily defended against the prowling Arabs, but I fear the garri-\nson would not be very stout-hearted, for it was said to be the fear of mil-\nitary service which caused many of the monks to discover that they had\na vocation. On being admitted I was conscious that we were not too wel-\n5 come, though the military title of my companion commanded respect.\nWe were shown round the inner courtyard, where there were palm trees\nand a garden, and then round the scattered houses within the wall. Near\nthe latter there was, I remember, a barrel full of some substance which\nseemed to me, both by look and feel, to be rounded pieces of some light\n10 stone, and I asked if it were to hurl down at the Arabs if they attacked the\ndoor. It proved to be the store of bread for the Monastery. We were treat-\ned to wine, which was sweet tent wine, which is still used, I believe, in the\nHoly Communion, showing how straight our customs come from the\nEast. The Abbot seemed to me to be a decent man, but he complained\n15 of illness and was gratified when I overhauled him thoroughly, percussed\nhis chest, and promised to send him out some medicine from Cairo. I did\nso, but whether it ever reached my remote patient I never learned. Some\nof the brothers, however, looked debauched, and there was a general air\nof nothing-to-do, which may have been deceptive but which certainly\n20 impressed me that day. As I looked from the walls and saw the desert on\nall sides, unbroken save for one blue corner of the salt lake, it was strange\nto consider that this was all which these men would ever see of the world,\nand to contrast their fate with my own busy and varied existence. There\nwas a library, but the books were scattered on the floor, all of them old\n25 and some no doubt rare. Since the discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus I pre-\nsume that all these old Coptic libraries have been examined by scholars,\nbut it certainly seemed to me that there might be some valuable stuff in\nthat untidy heap.\nNext evening Colonel Lewis and I were back in Cairo. We heard no\n30 news upon the way, and we had reached the Turf Club and were in the\ncloak-room washing our hands before dinner when some man came in\nand said:\n\u2018Why, Lewis, how is it you are not with your brigade?\u2019\n\u2018My brigade!\u2019\n35 \u2018Have you been away?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, at the Natron Lakes.\u2019\n\u2018Good Heavens! Have you heard nothing?\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n112 chapter 13\n\u2018Why, man, war is declared. We are advancing on Dongola. The\nwhole army is concentrating on the frontier, and you are in command of\nan advanced brigade.\u2019\n\u2018Good God!\u2019 Lewis\u2019s soap splashed into the water, and I wonder he\ndid not fall plump on the floor. Thus it was that we learned of the next 5\nadventure which was opening up before both us and the British Empire.\n113 Chapter 14\nON THE EDGE OF A STORM\n5 The Storm Centre \u2013 To the Frontier \u2013 Assouan \u2013 Excited Officers \u2013 With the\nPress Men \u2013 A Long Camel Ride \u2013 Night Marches \u2013 Halfa \u2013 Gwynne of the\nMorning Post \u2013 Anley \u2013 A Sudden Voyage \u2013 Apricots and Rousseau.\nIt is impossible to be near great historical events and not to desire to\n10 take part in them, or at the least to observe them. Egypt had suddenly\nbecome the storm centre of the world, and chance had placed me there\nat that moment. Clearly I could not remain in Cairo, but must get up by\nhook or by crook to the frontier. It was March and the weather would\nsoon be too warm for my wife, but she was good enough to say that she\n15 would wait with my sister until April if I would promise to return by\nthen. At that time the general idea was that some great event would at\nonce occur, though looking back one can see that that was hardly possi-\nble. Anyhow I had a great urge to go South.\nThere was only one way to do it. The big morning papers had their\n20 men already upon the spot. But it was less likely that the evening papers\nwere provided. I cabled to the Westminster Gazette asking to be made\ntheir honorary correspondent pro tem. I had a cable back assenting.\nArmed with this I approached the proper authority, and so within a day\nor two I was duly appointed and everything was in order.\n25 I had to make my own way up and I had to get together some sort of\nkit. The latter was done hurriedly and was of fearsome quality. I bought\na huge revolver of Italian make with a hundred cartridges, an ugly unre-\nliable weapon. I bought also a water bottle, which was made of new res-\ninous wood and gave a most horrible flavour of turpentine to everything\n30 put into it. It was like drinking varnish, but before I got back there were\ntimes when I was ready to drink varnish or anything else that was damp.\nWith a light khaki coat, riding breeches, a small valise, and the usu-\nal Christmas tree hung round me, I started off from Cairo by train to\nAssiout, where a small river boat was waiting. It was filled with officers\n35 going to the front, and we had a pleasant few days journeying to Assouan\ntogether. There were, I remember, several junior officers who have since\nmade names in the world, Maxwell (now General Sir John Maxwell) and\nHickman, who also rose to the top. There was a young cavalry lieutenant\n114 chapter 14\nalso, one Smythe, who seemed to me to be too gentle and quiet for such\nrough work as lay ahead. The next time I heard of him was when he was\ngazetted for the Victoria Cross. In soldiering there is nothing more de-\nceptive than appearances. Your fierce, truculent man may always have a\nyellow streak where the gentle student has a core of steel. There lay one 5\nof the many mistakes which the Germans made later in judging those\n\u2018unwarlike islanders\u2019 the British.\nThe great question at the opening of the campaign was whether the\nnative fellah troops would stand. The five negro battalions were as good\nas could be, but the record of the eight or nine Egyptian ones was not 10\nreassuring. The Arab of the Soudan is a desperate fanatic who rushes to\ndeath with the frenzy of a madman, and longs for close quarters where\nhe can bury his spear in the body of his foeman, even though he carries\nseveral bullets in him before he reaches him. Would the Egyptians stand\nsuch onslaughts as these? It was thought improbable that they would, 15\nand so British battalions, the Connaughts, the Staffords and others, were\nbrought up to stiffen their battle line. One great advantage the native sol-\ndiers had \u2013 and without it their case would have been hopeless \u2013 and that\nwas that their officers were among the picked men of the British Army.\nKitchener would have none but the unmarried, for it was to be a whole- 20\nhearted and if need be a desperate service, and, as the pay and life were\ngood, he could accept or reject as he chose, so that his leaders were splen-\ndid. It was curious to see their fair faces and flaxen moustaches under the\nred tarbooshes, as they marched at the side of their men.\nThe relations between these officers and their men were paternal. If 25\nan officer of black troops came to Cairo he would go back with a pil-\nlow-case stuffed with candies for his men. The Egyptians were more in-\nscrutable, less sporting and less lovable, but none the less their officers\nwere very loyal to them, and bitterly resented the distrust shown by the\nrest of the army. One British officer at some early battle seized the ene- 30\nmy\u2019s flag and cried: \u2018Well, the English shall not have this anyhow.\u2019 It is this\nspirit, whether in Egypt or in India, which makes the British officer an\nideal leader of native troops. Even at the great Indian Mutiny they would\nnot hear a word against their men until they were murdered by them.\nAt Assouan we were held up for a week, and no one was allowed to 35\ngo further. We were already well within the radius of the Arab raiders, for\nin the last year they had struck even further north. The desert is like the\nsea, for if you have the camels, which correspond to the ships, your blow\n115 on the edge of a storm\nmay fall anywhere and your attack is not suspected until the moment that\nyou appear. The crowd of British officers who were waiting seemed little\nworried by any such possibility and were as unconcerned as if it was a\nCook\u2019s tour and not a particularly dangerous expedition \u2013 so dangerous\n5 that of the last army which went South, that of Hicks Pasha, hardly one\nsingle man was ever seen again. Only once did I see them really excited.\nI had returned to the hotel which was the general head-quarters, and as\nI entered the hall I saw a crowd of them all clustering round the notice\nboard to read a telegram which had just been suspended. They were on\n10 the toes of their spurred boots, with their necks outstretched and every\nsign of quivering and eager interest. \u2018Ah,\u2019 thought I, \u2018at last we have got\nthrough the hide of these impenetrable men. I suppose the Khalifa is\ncoming down, horse, foot, and artillery, and that we are on the eve of\nbattle.\u2019 I pushed my way in, and thrust my head among all the bobbing\n15 sun-helmets. It was the account of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race.\nI was struck by the splendid zeal of everyone. It was an inspiration.\nHickman had been full of combative plans all the way on the boat. When\nwe arrived there was a message for him to go down to Keneh and buy\ncamels. Here was a drop down for a man all on fire for action. \u2018It is quite\n20 right,\u2019 said he, when I condoled with him. \u2018The force must have camels. I\nam the man to buy them. We all work for one end.\u2019 Self-abnegation of this\nsort is general. The British officer at his best is really a splendid fellow, a\nlarge edition of the public schoolboy, with his cheery slang overlying a\nserious purpose which he would usually die rather than admit. I heard of\n25 three of them at rail-end, all doing essential work and all with a degree of\nfever on them which might well have excused them from work altogeth-\ner. Every evening each of them dropped a dollar into a hat, they then all\ntook their temperatures and the highest got the pool.\nAssouan is at the foot of the Cataract, which extends for some 30\n30 miles, and everything has to be transhipped and taken on a narrow toy\nrailway to be reloaded on fresh steamers at Shellal. It was a huge task and I\nremember sympathizing with Captain Morgan, who with fatigue parties\nof Egyptians and chain gangs of convicts was pushing the stuff through.\nMorgan had sold me a horse once and was shy of me in consequence, but\n35 he soon saw that I bore no grudge. Caveat emptor! I already saw in him\nthose qualities of organization which made him a real factor both in the\nBoer and in the European war. He has just died (1923) a general and full\nof honours. I remember seeing the 7th Egyptians after a long gruelling\n116 chapter 14\ndesert march working at those stores until they were so played out that it\ntook four of them to raise a sixty-pound biscuit box.\nThe big pressmen had now arrived \u2013 \u2018Where the carcass is there\nshall the eagles, etc.\u2019 \u2013 and I had luckily made friends with them, so it\nwas determined that we should all go on together. There were five of us 5\nwho started out, led by Knight of the Falcon, representing The Times, and\nlooking not unlike a falcon himself. He was a great man, tall and muscu-\nlar, a famous yachtsman and treasure-seeker, traveller, fighter and schol-\nar. He had just left the French in Madagascar. Next came Scudamore of\nthe Daily News, small, Celtic, mercurial, full of wit and go. He was a great 10\npurchaser of camels, which were of course all paid for by the paper, so\nthat when Robinson, the editor of the Daily News, heard of the Boer war\nhis first comment was, \u2018Well, thank God, there are no camels in South\nAfrica.\u2019 It was a study in Eastern ways to see Scudamore buying camels,\nand I learned from him how it is done. An Arab leads up the absurd-look- 15\ning creature. You look deprecatingly at the beast \u2013 and you cannot take\na better model than the creature\u2019s own expression as it looks at you. You\nask how much is wanted for it. The owner says \u00a316. You then give a shriek\nof derision, sweep your arm across as if to wave him and his camel out of\nyour sight for ever, and turning with a whisk you set off rapidly in the oth- 20\ner direction. How far you go depends upon the price asked. If it is really\nvery high, you may not get back for your dinner. But as a rule a hundred\nyards or so meet the case, and you shape your course so as to reach the\ncamel and its owner. You stop in front of them and look at them with a\ndisinterested and surprised look to intimate that you wonder that they 25\nshould still be loitering there. The Arab asks how much you will give. You\nanswer \u00a38. Then it is his turn to scream, whisk round, and do his hundred\nyards, his absurd chattel with its horn-pipey legs trotting along behind\nhim. But he returns to say that he will take fourteen, and off you go again\nwith a howl and a wave. So the bargaining goes on, the circles continually 30\nshortening, until you have settled upon the middle price.\nBut it is only when you have bought your camel that the troubles be-\ngin. It is the strangest and most deceptive animal in the world. Its appear-\nance is so staid and respectable that you cannot give it credit for the black\nvillainy that lurks within. It approaches you with a mildly interested and 35\nsuperior expression, like a patrician lady in a Sunday school. You feel that\na pair of glasses at the end of a fan is the one thing lacking. Then it puts\nits lips gently forward, with a far-away look in its eyes, and you have just\n117 on the edge of a storm\ntime to say, \u2018The pretty dear is going to kiss me,\u2019 when two rows of fright-\nful green teeth clash in front of you, and you give such a backward jump\nas you could never have hoped at your age to accomplish. When once\nthe veil is dropped, anything more demoniacal than the face of a camel\n5 cannot be conceived. No kindness and no length of ownership seem to\nmake them friendly. And yet you must make allowances for a creature\nwhich can carry 600 lb. for 20 miles a day, and ask for no water and little\nfood at the end of it.\nThis, however, is digression. The other pressmen were Beaman of the\n10 Standard, fresh from Constantinople, and almost an Eastern in his ways,\nand Julian Corbett, representing the Pall Mall, a gentle and amiable man\nwho was destined later to be the naval historian of the Great War. Like\nmyself he was an amateur among professionals, and had to return within\na given date to Cairo.\n15 As it was clear that nothing important could take place instantly, we\ndetermined to do part of the journey by road. A force of cavalry was go-\ning up, and we were ordered to join them and use them as an escort, but\nwe thought we would be happier on our own, and so we managed to lose\nthe Egyptians. There was some risk in our lonely journey along the right\n20 bank of the river with our left flank quite unprotected, but on the other\nhand the dust of a great body of horsemen would be insufferable. There-\nfore we set forth one evening, mounted upon our camels, with baggage\ncamels in attendance, and quite a retinue of servants. In four or five days\nwe reached Korosko, where we got boats which took us to the frontier at\n25 Wady Halfa, while the camels and servants came on by land.\nI shall never forget those days, or rather those nights, for we rose\nat two in the morning and our longest march was before or during the\ndawn. I am still haunted by that purple velvet sky, by those enormous\nand innumerable stars, by the half-moon which moved slowly above us,\n30 while our camels with their noiseless tread seemed to bear us without\neffort through a wonderful dream world. Scudamore had a beautiful roll-\ning baritone voice, and I can still hear it in my memory as it rose and fell\nin the still desert air. It was a wonderful vision, an intermezzo in real life,\nbroken only once by my performing the unusual feat of falling off a cam-\n35 el. I have taken many tosses off horses, but this was a new experience. You\nhave no proper saddle, but are seated upon a curved leather tray, so that\nwhen my brute suddenly threw himself down on his fore-knees \u2013 he had\nseen some green stuff on the path \u2013 I shot head foremost down his neck.\n118 chapter 14\nIt was like coming down a hose pipe in some acrobatic performance, and\nI reached the ground rather surprised but otherwise none the worse.\nOne or two pictures rise in mind. One was of some strange aquatic\nlizard \u2013 not a crocodile \u2013 lying on a sand bank. I cracked off my Italian\nrevolver, which was more likely to hurt me than the lizard, and I saw the 5\nstrange beast writhe into the stream. Once again, as I settled my couch\nat night, I saw a slug-like creature, with horned projections, the length\nabout 18 inches, which moved away and disappeared. It was a death ad-\nder \u2013 the sort perhaps which took Cleopatra to her fathers. Then again\nwe went into a ruined hut to see if we could sleep there. In the dim light 10\nof our candle we saw a creature which I thought was a mouse rush round\nand round the floor, close to the wall. Then suddenly to my amazement\nit ran right up the wall and down again on to the floor. It was a huge spi-\nder, which now stood waving its fore-legs at us. To my horror Scudamore\nsprang into the air, and came down upon it, squashing it into a square 15\nfoot of filth. This was the real tarantula, a dangerous creature, and com-\nmon enough in such places.\nYet another picture comes very clearly back to me. For some reason\nwe had not started in the night, and the early dawn found us still resting\nin our small camp in a grove of palm trees near the path which led along 20\nthe bank of the Nile. I awoke, and, lying in my blankets, I saw an amaz-\ning man riding along this path. He was a Negroid Nubian, a huge, fierce,\nhollow-cheeked creature, with many silver ornaments upon him. A long\nrifle projected over his back and a sword hung from his side. A more sin-\nister barbaric figure one could not imagine, and he was exactly the type 25\nof those Mahdi raiders against whom we had been warned. I never like\nto be an alarmist, especially among men who had seen much of war or\ndanger, so I said nothing, but I managed to stir one of my companions,\nwho sighted the newcomer with a muttered \u2018My God!\u2019 The man rode\npast us and on northwards, never glancing at our grove. I have no doubt 30\nthat he was really one of our own native tribesmen, for we had some in\nour pay; but had he been the other thing our fate would have been sealed.\nI wrote a short story, \u2018The Three Correspondents,\u2019 which was suggested\nby the incident.\nA strange wooden-faced Turkish soldier, Yussuf Bey, in the Egyptian 35\nservice, commanding the troops at Korosko, had us up in audience, gave\nus long pink glasses of raspberry vinegar, and finally saw us on board the\nboat which in a day or two deposited us on the busy river-bank of Wady\n119 on the edge of a storm\nHalfa, where the same military bustle prevailed as we had left behind us\nat Assouan.\nHalfa lies also at the base of a cataract, and again all the stuff had to\nbe transhipped and sent on 30 miles by a little track to Sarras. I walked\n5 the first day to the small station where the track began, and I saw a tall\nofficer in a white jacket and red tarboosh, who with a single orderly was\nsuperintending the work and watching the stores pass into the trucks. He\nturned a fierce red face upon me, and I saw that it was Kitchener himself,\nthe Commander of the whole army. It was characteristic of the man that\n10 he did not leave such vital things to chance, or to the assurance of some\nsubordinate, but that he made sure so far as he could with his own eyes\nthat he really had the tools for the job that lay before him. Learning who\nI was \u2013 we had met once before on the racecourse at Cairo \u2013 he asked me\nto dinner in his tent that night, when he discussed the coming campaign\n15 with great frankness. I remember that his chief-of-staff \u2013 Drage, I think,\nwas the name \u2013 sat beside me and was so completely played out that he\nfell asleep between every course. I remember also the amused smile with\nwhich Kitchener regarded him. You had to go all out when you served\nsuch a master.\n20 One new acquaintance whom I made in those days was Herbert\nGwynne, a newly-fledged war correspondent, acting, if I remember right,\nfor the Chronicle. I saw that he had much in him. When I heard of him\nnext he was Reuter\u2019s man in the Boer War, and not very long afterwards\nhe had become editor of the Morning Post, where he now is. Those days in\n25 Halfa were the beginning of a friendship of thirty years, none the less real\nbecause we are both too busy to meet. One of the joys of the hereafter is,\nI think, that we have time to cultivate our friends.\nI was friendly also with a very small but gallant officer, one Anley,\nwho had just joined the Egyptian Army. His career was beginning and\n30 I foresaw that he would rise, but should have been very surprised had\nI known how we should meet again. I was standing in the ranks by the\nroadside as a private of Volunteers in the Great War when a red-tabbed,\nbrass-hatted general passed. He looked along our ranks, his gaze fastened\non me, and lo, it was Anley. Surprised out of all military etiquette, he\n35 smiled and nodded. What is a private in the ranks to do when a general\nsmiles and nods? He can\u2019t formally stand to attention or salute. I fear that\nwhat I did was to close and then open my left eye. That was how I learned\nthat my Egyptian captain was now a war brigadier.\n120 chapter 14\nWe pushed on to Sarras and had a glimpse of the actual outpost of\ncivilization, all sandbags and barbed wire, for there was a Mahdi post at\nno distance up the river. It was wonderful to look south and to see distant\npeaks said to be in Dongola, with nothing but savagery and murder lying\nbetween. There was a whiff of real war in the little fortress but no sign of 5\nany actual advance.\nIndeed, I had the assurance of Kitchener himself that there was no\nuse my waiting and that nothing could possibly happen until the camels\nwere collected \u2013 many thousands of them. I contributed my own beast to\nthe army\u2019s need since I had no further use for it, and Corbett and I pre- 10\npared to take our leave. We were warned that our only course was to be\non the look-out and take a flying jump on to any empty cargo boat which\nwas going downstream. This we did one morning, carrying our scanty\nbelongings. Once on board we learned that there was no food and that\nthe boat did not stop for several days. The rope had not been cast off, so 15\nI rushed to the only shop available, a Greek store of a type which springs\nup like mushrooms on the track of an army. They were sold out save for\ntinned apricots, of which I bought several tins. I rushed back and scram-\nbled on board as the boat cast off. We managed to get some Arab bread\nfrom the boatmen, and that with the apricots served us all the way. I nev- 20\ner wish to see a tinned apricot so long as I live. I associate their cloying\nsweetness with Rousseau\u2019s Confessions, a French edition of which came\nsomehow into my hands and was my only reading till I saw Assouan once\nmore. Rousseau also I never wish to read again.\nSo that was the end of our frontier adventure. We had been on the 25\nedge of war but not in it. It was disappointing, but it was late in April be-\nfore I reached Cairo, and the heat was already becoming too much for an\ninvalid. A week later we were in London, and I remember that, as I sat as\na guest at the Royal Academy Banquet on May 1 of that year, I saw upon\nmy wrists the ragged little ulcers where the poisonous jiggers which had 30\nburrowed into my skin while I lay upon the banks of the Nile were hatch-\ning out their eggs under the august roof of Burlington House.\n121 Chapter 15\nAN INTERLUDE OF PEACE\n5 Hindhead \u2013 Rodney Stone \u2013 A Duet \u2013 A Haunted House \u2013 A Curious Society\n\u2013 Preternatural Powers \u2013 The Little Doctor \u2013 The Shadow of Africa.\nWhen we returned to England I found that the house in which we\nhoped that the cure would be completed was not yet ready. It was a con-\n10 siderable mansion planned upon a large scale, so that it was not surpris-\ning that it had taken some time to build. We were compelled to take a\nfurnished house at Haslemere until the early months of 1897, when we\nmoved up to Moorlands, a boarding-house on Hindhead close to the\nsite of my building. There we spent some happy and busy months until\n15 the house was ready in the summer. I had taken up riding, and though\nI was never a great horseman I was able from that time onwards to get\na good deal of health and pleasure out of it, for in that woody, heathy\ncountry there are beautiful rides in every direction, and the hunting, in\nwhich I joined, was at least picturesque. About June we moved into the\n20 new house, which I called Undershaw \u2013 a new word, I think, and yet one\nwhich described it exactly in good Anglo-Saxon, since it stood under a\nhanging grove of trees.\nI have said little, during these years spent in the quest of health, con-\ncerning my literary production. The chief book which I had written since\n25 The Refugees was a study of the Regency with its bucks and prizefight-\ners. I had always a weakness for the old fighting men and for the lore of\nthe prize-ring, and I indulged it in this novel. At the time boxing had\nnot gained the popular vogue which I have been told that this very book\nfirst initiated, and I can never forget the surprise of Sir George Newnes\n30 when he found out what the new serial was about. \u2018Why that subject of\nall subjects upon earth?\u2019 he cried. However, I think that the readers of The\nStrand found that I had not chosen badly, and the book is one which has\nheld a permanent place as a picture of those wild old days. I wrote a con-\nsiderable number of short tales during those years, and finally in 1898 a\n35 domestic study, A Duet, which was an attempt at quite a different form of\nliterature \u2013 a picture in still life, as it were. It was partly imaginative and\npartly founded upon early experiences of my own and of friends. It led, I\nremember, to a public bickering with a man who has done good work as\n122 chapter 15\na critic, Dr. Robertson Nicoll. He took exception to some passage in the\nbook, which he had every right to do. But he wrote at that time for six or\nseven papers, under different names, so that it appeared as if a number of\ncritics were all condemning me when it was really only one. I thought I\nhad a grievance, and said so with such vehemence that he stated that he 5\ndid not know whether to answer me in print or in the law courts. How-\never, it all blew over and we became very good friends. Another book of\nthose days was Uncle Bernac, which I never felt to be satisfactory, though\nI venture to claim that the two chapters which portray Napoleon give a\nclearer picture of him than many a long book has done, which is natural 10\nenough, since they are themselves the quintessence of a score of books.\nSo much for my work. I had everything in those few years to make\na man contented, save only the constant illness of my partner. And yet\nmy soul was often troubled within me. I felt that I was born for some-\nthing else, and yet I was not clear what that something might be. My 15\nmind felt out continually into the various religions of the world. I could\nno more get into the old ones, as commonly received, than a man could\nget into his boy\u2019s suit. I still argued on materialist lines. I subscribed to\nthe Rationalist Association and read all their literature carefully, but it\nwas entirely destructive and one cannot permanently live on that alone. 20\nBesides, I was sure enough of psychic phenomena to be aware that there\nwas a range of experience there which was entirely beyond any rational\nexplanation, and that therefore a system which ignored a great body of\nfacts, and was incompatible with them, was necessarily an imperfect sys-\ntem. On the other hand, convinced as I was of these abnormal happen- 25\nings, and that intelligence, high or low, lay behind them, I by no means\nunderstood their bearing. I still confused the knocking at the door with\nthe friend outside, or the ringing of the bell with the telephone message.\nSometimes I had the peace of despair, when one felt that one could nev-\ner possibly arrive at any conclusions save negative ones, and then again 30\nsome fresh impulse of the soul would start one upon a new quest. In\nevery direction I reached out, but never yet with any absolute satisfac-\ntion. I should have been relieved from all my troubles could I have giv-\nen heartfelt adhesion to any form of orthodoxy \u2013 but my reason always\nbarred the way. 35\nDuring all the Egyptian and other periods of our exile I had never\nceased to take the psychic subject very seriously, to read eagerly all that\nI could get, and from time to time to organize s\u00e9ances which gave indif-\n123 an interlude of peace\nferent but not entirely negative results, though we had no particular me-\ndium to help us. The philosophy of the subject began slowly to unfold,\nand it was gradually made more feasible, not only that life carried on,\nenclosed in some more tenuous envelope, but that the conditions which\n5 it encountered in the beyond were not unlike those which it had known\nhere. So far I had got along the road, but the overwhelming and vital im-\nportance of it all had not yet been borne in upon me.\nNow and then I had a psychic experience somewhat outside the gen-\neral run of such events. One of these occurred when I was at Norwood in\n10 1892 or 1893. I was asked by the Society of Psychical Research whether\nI would join a small committee to sit in and report upon a haunted house\nat Charmouth in Dorset. I went down accordingly together with a Dr.\nScott and Mr. Podmore, a man whose name was associated with such\ninvestigations. I remember that it took us the whole railway journey from\n15 Paddington to read up the evidence as to the senseless noises which had\nmade life unendurable for the occupants, who were tied by a lease and\ncould not get away. We sat up there two nights. On the first nothing oc-\ncurred. On the second Dr. Scott left us and I sat up with Mr. Podmore.\nWe had, of course, taken every precaution to checkmate fraud, putting\n20 worsted threads across the stairs, and so on.\nIn the middle of the night a fearsome uproar broke out. It was like\nsomeone belabouring a resounding table with a heavy cudgel. It was not\nan accidental creaking of wood, or anything of that sort, but a deafening\nrow. We had all doors open, so we rushed at once into the kitchen, from\n25 which the sound had surely come. There was nothing there \u2013 doors were\nall locked, windows barred, and threads unbroken. Podmore took away\nthe light and pretended that we had both returned to our sitting-room,\ngoing off with the young master of the house, while I waited in the dark\nin the hope of a return of the disturbance. None came \u2013 or ever did come.\n30 What occasioned it we never knew. It was of the same character as all the\nother disturbances we had read about, but shorter in time. But there was\na sequel to the story. Some years later the house was burned down, which\nmay or may not have a bearing upon the sprite which seemed to haunt it,\nbut a more suggestive thing is that the skeleton of a child about ten years\n35 old was dug up in the garden. This I give on the authority of a relation of\nthe family who were so plagued. The suggestion was that the child had\nbeen done to death there long ago, and that the subsequent phenomena\nof which we had one small sample were in some way a sequence to this\n124 chapter 15\ntragedy. There is a theory that a young life cut short in sudden and un-\nnatural fashion may leave, as it were, a store of unused vitality which may\nbe put to strange uses. The unknown and the marvellous press upon us\nfrom all sides. They loom above us and around us in undefined and fluc-\ntuating shapes, some dark, some shimmering, but all warning us of the 5\nlimitations of what we call matter, and of the need for spirituality if we are\nto keep in touch with the true inner facts of life.\nI was never asked for a report of this case, but Podmore sent one in,\nattributing the noises to the young man, though as a fact he was actually\nsitting with us in the parlour when the tumult broke out. A confederate 10\nwas possible, though we had taken every step to bar it, but the expla-\nnation given was absolutely impossible. I learned from this, what I have\noften confirmed since, that while we should be most critical of all psychic\nassertions, if we are to get at the truth, we should be equally critical of\nall negatives and especially of so-called \u2018exposures\u2019 in this subject. Again 15\nand again I have probed them and found them to depend upon prejudice\nor upon an imperfect acquaintance with psychic law.\nThis brings me to another curious experience which occurred about\nthis time, probably in 1898. There was a small doctor dwelling near me,\nsmall in stature, and also, I fear, in practice, named Pullen-Bury. He was 20\na student of the occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learning that\nhe had one room in his house which no one entered except himself, as\nit was reserved for mystic and philosophic purposes. Finding that I was\ninterested in such subjects, the Doctor suggested one day that I should\njoin a secret society of esoteric students. The invitation had been led up 25\nto by a good deal of preparatory inquiry. The dialogue between us ran\nsomewhat thus:\n\u2018What shall I get from it?\u2019\n\u2018In time, you will get powers.\u2019\n\u2018What sort of powers?\u2019 30\n\u2018They are powers which people would call supernatural. They are per-\nfectly natural, but they are got by knowledge of deeper forces of nature.\u2019\n\u2018If they are good, why should not everyone know them?\u2019\n\u2018They would be capable of great abuse in the wrong hands.\u2019\n\u2018How can you prevent their getting into wrong hands?\u2019 35\n\u2018By carefully examining our initiates.\u2019\n\u2018Should I be examined?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\n125 an interlude of peace\n\u2018By whom?\u2019\n\u2018The people would be in London.\u2019\n\u2018Should I have to present myself?\u2019\n\u2018No, no, they would do it without your knowledge.\u2019\n5 \u2018And after that?\u2019\n\u2018You would then have to study.\u2019\n\u2018Study what?\u2019\n\u2018You would have to learn by heart a considerable mass of material.\nThat would be the first thing.\u2019\n10 \u2018If this material is in print, why does it not become public property?\u2019\n\u2018It is not in print. It is in manuscript. Each manuscript is carefully\nnumbered and trusted to the honour of a passed initiate. We have never\nhad a case of one going wrong.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018it is very interesting and you can go ahead with the next\n15 step, whatever it may be.\u2019\nSome little time later \u2013 it may have been a week \u2013 I awoke in the very\nearly morning with a most extraordinary sensation. It was not a night-\nmare or any prank of a dream. It was quite different from that, for it per-\nsisted after I was wide awake. I can only describe it by saying that I was\n20 tingling all over. It was not painful, but it was queer and disagreeable, as a\nmild electric shock would be. I thought at once of the little doctor.\nIn a few days I had a visit from him. \u2018You have been examined and you\nhave passed,\u2019 said he with a smile. \u2018Now you must say definitely whether\nyou will go on with it. You can\u2019t take it up and drop it. It is serious, and\n25 you must leave it alone or go forward with a whole heart.\u2019\nIt began to dawn upon me that it really was serious, so serious that\nthere seemed no possible space for it in my very crowded and pre-occu-\npied life. I said as much, and he took it in very good part. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said\nhe, \u2018we won\u2019t talk of it any more unless you change your mind.\u2019\n30 There was a sequel to the story. A month or two later, on a pouring\nwet day, the little doctor called, bringing with him another medical man\nwhose name \u2013 Felkin \u2013 was familiar to me in connection with exploration\nand tropical service. They sat together beside my study fire and talked.\nOne could not but observe that the famous and much-travelled man was\n35 very deferential to the little country surgeon, who was the younger of the\ntwo.\n\u2018He is one of my initiates,\u2019 said the latter to me. \u2018You know,\u2019 he contin-\nued, turning to his companion, \u2018Doyle nearly joined us once.\u2019 The other\n126 chapter 15\nlooked at me with great interest and then at once plunged into a conver-\nsation with his mentor as to the wonders he had seen and, as I under-\nstood, actually done. I listened amazed. It sounded like the talk of two\nlunatics. One phrase stuck in my memory.\n\u2018When first you took me up with you,\u2019 said he, \u2018and we were hovering 5\nover the town I used to live in, in Central Africa, I was able for the first\ntime to see the islands out in the lake. I always knew they were there, but\nthey were too far off to be seen from the shore. Was it not extraordinary\nthat I should first see them when I was living in England?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Pullen-Bury, smoking his pipe and staring into the fire. \u2018We 10\nhad some fun in those days. Do you remember how you laughed when we\nmade the little steamboat and it ran along the upper edge of the clouds?\u2019\nThere were other remarks as wild. \u2018A conspiracy to impress a simple-\nton,\u2019 says the sceptic. Well, we can leave it at that if the sceptic so wills, but\nI remain under the impression that I brushed against something strange, 15\nand something which I am not sorry that I avoided. It was not Spiritual-\nism and it was not Theosophy, but rather the acquisition of powers latent\nin the human organization, after the alleged fashion of the old gnostics\nor of some modern fakirs in India, though some doubtless would spell\nfakirs with an \u2018e.\u2019 One thing I am very sure of, and that is that morals 20\nand ethics have to keep pace with knowledge, or all is lost. The Maori\ncannibals had psychic knowledge and power, but were man-eaters none\nthe less. Christian ethics can never lose its place whatever expansion our\npsychic faculties may enjoy. But Christian theology can and will.\nTo return to the little doctor, I came across him again, as psychic as 25\never, in Portland, Oregon, in 1923 and soon afterwards read of his death.\nFrom what I learned I should judge that the powers of the Society to\nwhich he belonged included that of loosening their own etheric bodies,\nin summoning the etheric bodies of others (mine, for example) and in\nmaking thought images (the steamboat) in the way that we are assured 30\nis possible by will-power. But their line of philosophy or development is\nbeyond me. I believe they represent a branch of the Rosicrucians.\nAll seemed placid at this time. My wife was holding her own in winter\nas well as in summer. The two children, Mary and Kingsley, were passing\nthrough the various sweet phases of human development, and brought 35\ngreat happiness into our lives. The country was lovely. My life was filled\nwith alternate work and sport. As with me so with the nation. They were\nyears of prosperity and success. But the shadow of South Africa was fall-\n127 an interlude of peace\ning upon England, and before it passed my personal fortunes, as well as\nso many more, were destined to be involved in it. I had a deep respect\nfor the Boers and some fear of their skill at arms, their inaccessible sit-\nuation, and their sturdy Teutonic tenacity. I foresaw that they would be\n5 a most dangerous enemy, and I watched with horror the drift of events\nwhich from the time of the ill-judged Jameson Raid never ceased to lead\nto open war. It was almost a relief when at last it came and we could clear-\nly see the magnitude of our task. And yet few people understood it at the\ntime. On the very eve of war I took the chair at a dinner to Lord Wolseley\n10 at the Authors\u2019 Club and he declared that we could send two divisions to\nAfrica. The papers next day were all much exercised as to whether such\na force was either possible to collect or necessary to send. What would\nthey have thought had they been told that a quarter of a million men, a\nlarge proportion of them cavalry, would be needed before victory could\n15 be won. The early Boer victories surprised no one who knew something\nof South African history, and they made it clear to every man in England\nthat it was not a wine-glass but a rifle which one must grasp if the health\nof the Empire was to be honoured.\n128 Chapter 16\nTHE START FOR SOUTH AFRICA\nThe Black Week \u2013 Volunteering \u2013 The Langman Hospital \u2013 The Voyage \u2013 5\nBloemfontein \u2013 Sir Claude de Crespigny \u2013 The Epidemic \u2013 Advance to the\nWater Works.\nFrom december 10 to 17, 1899, was the black week for England. In\nthat week General Gatacre lost a battle at Stormberg, Lord Methuen lost 10\none at Magersfontein and General Buller lost one at Colenso. The three\ntogether would not have made more than a minor action in the great war\nto come, but at the time it seemed portentous. There were ominous stir-\nrings on the Continent also and rumours of a coalition. It was lucky for\nus that the German fleet was not yet in being and that our own was able 15\nto keep the ring, or we should soon have had some Lafayette in South\nAfrica with perhaps a Yorktown to follow. However, it was bad enough\nas it was, but the nation as usual rose splendidly to the occasion, and\neveryone hastened to do what they could. Hence it was that I found my-\nself early one morning at Hounslow \u2013 if I remember right \u2013 standing in a 20\nlong queue of men who were waiting to enlist in the Middlesex Yeoman-\nry. I had one or two friends in the regiment and hence my choice.\nColonel Mitford, a grizzled soldier, sat behind a deal table in an or-\nderly room and dealt swiftly with the applicants. He had no idea who I\nwas, but seeing a man of forty before him he intimated that I surely did 25\nnot intend to go into the ranks. I said that I was prepared to take a com-\nmission. He asked if I could ride and shoot. I said that I could do both\nin moderation. He asked if I had had military experience. I said that I\nhad led an adventurous life and seen a little of military operations in the\nSoudan, which was stretching it about as far as it would go. Two white 30\nlies are permitted to a gentleman, to screen a woman, or to get into a fight\nwhen the fight is a rightful one. So I trust I may be forgiven.\nHowever Colonel Mitford would only put me on his waiting list, took\nmy name, still without recognizing me, and passed on to the next case.\nI departed somewhat crestfallen and unsettled, not knowing whether I 35\nhad heard the last of the matter or not. Almost immediately afterwards,\nhowever, I received an offer which took me out in a capacity which was\nless sporting but probably in my case and at my age a good deal more\n129 the start for south africa\nuseful. This came from my friend John Langman, whose son Archie I had\nknown well in Davos days. Langman was sending out a hospital of fifty\nbeds at his own expense to Africa, and had already chosen his staff of\nsurgeons but not his personnel. Archie Langman was to go with the Hos-\n5 pital as general manager. Langman\u2019s idea was that I should help him to\nchoose the personnel, that I should be a supplementary medico, and that\nI should exercise a general supervision over the whole in an unofficial ca-\npacity. To all this I agreed and spent a week at his house at Stanhope Ter-\nrace, choosing from many candidates those who seemed the most likely.\n10 On the whole they proved to be a worthy choice. There were many things\nto be done, and in the middle of them I received a note from Colonel\nMitford, re-opening the question of the Yeomanry, but by this time I was\nentirely committed to the Langman Hospital.\nWhen we were complete we were quite a good little unit, but our\n15 weakness was unfortunately at the head. Dr. O\u2019Callaghan had been a per-\nsonal friend of Langman\u2019s and had thus got the senior billet, but he was\nin truth an excellent gyn\u00e6cologist, which is a branch of the profession for\nwhich there seemed to be no immediate demand. He was a man too who\nhad led a sedentary life and was not adapted, with all the will in the world,\n20 for the trying experience which lay before us. He realized this himself and\nreturned to England after a short experience of South African conditions.\nWe were compelled to have one military chief, as a bond with the War\nOffice, and this proved to be one Major Drury, a most amusing Irishman\nwho might have come right out of Lever. To leave the service and to \u2018mar-\n25 ry a rich widow with a cough\u2019 was, he said, the height of his ambition. He\nwas a very pleasant companion in civil life, but when it came to duties\nwhich needed tact and routine he was rather too Celtic in his methods,\nand this led to friction and occasional rows in which I had to sustain the\npoint of view of Mr. Langman. I have no doubt he thought me an insub-\n30 ordinate dog, and I thought him \u2013 well, he has passed away now, and I\nremember him best as a very amusing companion.\nUnder O\u2019Callaghan and Drury were two really splendid younger\nsurgeons, Charles Gibbs and Scharlieb, the latter the son of the well-\nknown lady doctor. They were as good as they could be. Then we had our\n35 ward-masters, cooks, stewards, storekeepers, and finally some fifteen to\ntwenty orderlies. Altogether we numbered just fifty men, and were splen-\ndidly fitted out by the generosity of Mr. Langman.\nA month or two passed before we could get away, and I remember\n130 chapter 16\none amusing incident which occurred during that time. I had spent a\ngood deal of thought over the problem how best to attack men who lay\nconcealed behind cover. My conclusions were that it was useless to fire at\nthem direct, since, if they knew their business, very little of them would\nbe vulnerable. On the other hand, if one could turn a rifle into a portable 5\nhowitzer and drop a bullet with any sort of rough general accuracy within\na given area, then it seemed to me that life would hardly be possible with-\nin that area. If, for example, the position was 20,000 square yards in size,\nand 20,000 rifles were dropping bullets upon it, each square yard would\nsooner or later be searched and your mark would be a whole prostrate or 10\ncrouching body. What I was really evolving, though I could not know it,\nwas the machine gun barrage of dropping or vertical fire as practised in\nthe Great War. My principles were absolutely right and have not even yet\nreceived their full application. I wrote an article to The Times explaining\nmy views, but so far as I know it had no results. 15\nMeanwhile I was practising how to turn a rifle into a howitzer. I fas-\ntened a large needle at the end of a thread to the back sight. When the\ngun pointed straight up in the air the needle swung down across the stock\nand I marked the spot. Then the idea was to tilt the gun slowly forward,\nmarking advances of 200, 400 and so on in the range, so that you had a 20\ndial marked on the stock and could always by letting the needle fall across\nthe correct mark on the dial drop the bullet within a certain distance.\nBut the crux was to discover the exact ranges. To do this I went down\nto Frensham Pond and, standing among the reeds and tilting the gun\nvery slightly forward, I pulled the trigger. The bullet very nearly fell upon 25\nmy own head. I could not locate it, but I heard quite a loud thud. But\nwhat amazed me, and still amazes me, was the time it took. I counted fifty\nseconds on my watch between the discharge and the fall. I don\u2019t wonder\nif the reader is incredulous. I feel incredulous also, but such is the fact as\nI recorded it. 30\nMy idea was to mark the bullet splashes on the calm water of the lake,\nbut though I fired and fired at various angles not a splash could I see. Fi-\nnally a little man who may have been an artist broke in upon my solitude.\n\u2018Do you want to know where those bullets were going?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, sir, I do.\u2019 35\n\u2018Then I can tell you, sir, for they have been dropping all round me.\u2019\nI felt that unless my howitzer was to claim its first victim on the spot\nI had better stop. It was clear that the light bullet with so heavy a charge\n131 the start for south africa\nwent so high into the atmosphere that one lost all command over it. Twice\nthe weight and half the charge would have served my purpose better. Then\ncame other calls and I could never work it out, but I am very sure that with\na little care in detail I could have got a converging fire which would have\n5 cleared any kopje in South Africa.\nAs I was convinced that the idea was both practical and much needed\nI communicated full particulars to the War Office. Here is the letter I had\nin reply.\n10 WAR OFFICE,\nFeb. 16, 1900.\nSIR,\u2013\n15 With reference to your letter concerning an appliance for adapting\nrifles to high angle fire I am directed by the Secretary of State for War\nto inform you that he will not trouble you in the matter.\nI am, Sir, Your Obedient Servant,\n20 (Signature illegible),\nDirector General of Ordnance.\nThus, whether my invention was nonsense or whether it was, as I be-\nlieve, radical and epoch-making, I was given no chance to explain or to il-\n25 lustrate it. As I remarked in The Times: \u2018No wonder that we find the latest\ninventions in the hands of our enemies rather than ourselves if those who\ntry to improve our weapons meet with such encouragement as I have done.\u2019\nOur traditions were carried on in the Great War, for Pomeroy, the inventor\nof the inflammable bullet which brought down the Zeppelins, was about\n30 to return to New Zealand in despair and it was, as I am assured, private and\nnot official bullets which first showed how valuable was his discovery and\nforced a belated acceptance by the War Office.\nAt last our time drew near. My wife had gone to Naples, where it was\nhoped that the warmer climate would complete her cure. My affairs were all\n35 settled up. I was to go as an unpaid man, and I contributed my butler Cleeve,\na good intelligent man for the general use, paying him myself. In this way I\nretained my independence and could return when I felt that the time had\ncome \u2013 which, as events turned out, proved to be very valuable to me.\n132 chapter 16\nWe were reviewed by the old Duke of Cambridge in some drill-hall\nin London. There befell me on this occasion one of those quaint happen-\nings which seem to me to have been more common in my life than in that\nof most other men. We were drawn up in our new khaki uniforms, and\nwearing our tropical helmets, for the Royal Duke\u2019s inspection. If we had 5\nbeen asked to form fours we should have broken down completely, but\nluckily we were placed in double line and so we remained. I was standing\nin front on the right flank. With my eyes fixed rigidly before me I was still\nable out of the corner of them to be aware that the old Duke, with his\nsuite, was coming across to begin at my end. Presently he halted in front 10\nof me, and stood motionless. I remained quite rigid, looking past him. He\ncontinued to stand, so near me that I could hear and almost feel his puffy\nbreath. \u2018What on earth!\u2019 I wondered, but I gave no sign. At last he spoke.\n\u2018What is this?\u2019 he asked. Then louder, \u2018What is this?\u2019 and finally, in a sort\nof ecstasy, \u2018What is it?\u2019 I never moved an eyelash, but one of a group of 15\njournalists upon my right went into hysterical but subdued laughter.\nThere was whispering among the suite, something was explained, and\nthe funny old man passed on. But did ever Lever in his maddest moment\nrepresent that his hero on the first day of wearing uniform should have\nsuch an experience with the ex-Commander-in-Chief of the British army 20\nand the uncle of the Queen?\nIt seems that what was worrying the dear old gentleman \u2013 he was\nabout eighty at the time \u2013 was that my tunic buttons had no mark upon\nthem, a thing which he had never seen in Her Majesty\u2019s Army. Even a\ncrown or a star would do, but no mark at all completely upset him, for he 25\nwas a great stickler for correct military clothing. So, of course, was King\nEdward. A friend of mine at a ball in India (royalty being present) was\nswooped down upon by a very agitated aide-de-camp who began: \u2018His\nRoyal Highness desires me to say...\u2019 and went on to point out some defect\nin his dress kit. My friend answered: \u2018I will mention the matter to my 30\ntailor,\u2019 which was, I think, an admirable way of quietly putting the matter\ninto its true perspective.\nOn this occasion we officers all filed up to be presented and the old\nDuke made amends by blurting out some very kindly things, for it seems\nthat he greatly approved of my wooden soldier attitude, in spite of my 35\nreprehensible buttons. He had a day of agitations, for on the top of the\nbuttons one of the curtains of the hotel took fire during our luncheon at\nClaridge\u2019s, and there was great excitement for a few moments. He made, I\n133 the start for south africa\nremember, an extremely indiscreet speech in which he said: \u2018They turned\nme off because they said I was too old, but old as I am I wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen such a fool as to \u2013 \u2019 and then he strung off a number of things which\nLord Wolseley, his successor, was supposed to have done. The press was\n5 merciful and did not report.\nWe sailed on February 28, 1900, from Tilbury, in the chartered trans-\nport Oriental, carrying with us a mixed lot of drafts, and picking up the\nRoyal Scots Militia at Queenstown, where a noisy Irishwoman threw a\nwhite towel on board, crying, \u2018You may be afther findin\u2019 it useful.\u2019 The\n10 Scots were a rather rough crowd with a number of territorial magnates,\nLord Henry Scott, Lord Tewkesbury, Lord Newport, Lord Brackley and\nothers among their officers. Colonel Garstin of the Middlesex was in\ngeneral command of the whole of us. The monotony of the three weeks\u2019\nvoyage was broken only by a cricket match at the Cape de Verdes, by a\n15 lecture on the war which I delivered on deck under a tropical moon to\nall hands and by an enteric inoculation, which was voluntary but should\nhave been compulsory, for even as it was it saved many lives, and I am\nnot sure that my own was not among them. The Great War has shown for\never how effective this treatment is. We lost more from enteric than from\n20 the bullet in South Africa, and it is sad to think that nearly all could have\nbeen saved had Almroth Wright\u2019s discovery been properly appreciated.\nHis brother was on board, I remember \u2013 an officer of Sappers \u2013 and took\nthe virus particularly badly, though all of us were quite bad enough, for\nthe right dose had not yet been accurately determined.\n25 On the evening of March 21 we reached Capetown and found the\nbay full of shipping. There were fifty large steamers at anchor \u2013 mostly\nempty. Some of us had a run ashore, but we had some trouble getting\non board again, for there was a big swell and the little tug dare not come\nquite alongside. We had to jump therefore from the paddle-box as the\n30 roll favoured us, landing on a hanging ladder, where a quarter-master\nseized us. To some people such a feat is easy, while others evidently re-\ngarded it with horror, and I wondered that we escaped from having some\ntragedy. The only real mishap was a strange one. A row of soldier faces\nwas looking down on us over the bulwarks, when I saw the grin upon one\n35 of them change to a look of horrible agony and he gave a wild scream. He\nstill remained standing, but several men ran towards him, and then he\ndisappeared. Only afterwards did I learn that a huge iron bar had in some\nway fallen only an inch or two upon his foot, pinning him to the place.\n134 chapter 16\nHe fainted as they disengaged him, and was carried below with his bones\ncrushed.\nI spent next day ashore, with the Mount Nelson Hotel as my\nhead-quarters. It was full of a strange medley of wounded officers, ad-\nventuresses and cosmopolitans. Kitchener came down and cleared it out 5\nshortly afterwards, for the syrens were interfering with his fighting men.\nThe general war news was very good. Paardeburg had been fought, Lord\nRoberts had made his way to Bloemfontein and Kimberley had been re-\nlieved by French whose immediate return to head off Cronje was one of\nthe inspired incidents of the war. It was a consolation to find that Boers 10\nreally could be captured in large numbers, for their long run of success-\nes while the conditions were in their favour was getting badly upon the\npublic nerves and a legendary sort of atmosphere was beginning to build\nup around them.\nSome money had been given me for charitable purposes when I was 15\nin London, so I went down to the camp of the Boer prisoners to see if I\ncould spend some of it. It was a racecourse, pent in with barbed wire, and\nthey were certainly a shaggy, dirty, unkempt crowd but with the bearing\nof free men. There were a few cruel or brutal faces, some of them half\ncaste, but most were good honest fellows and the general effect was for- 20\nmidable. There were some who were maned like lions. I afterwards went\ninto the tents of the sick Boers. Several were sitting sullenly round and\none was raving in delirium, saying something in his frenzy which set all\nthe others laughing in a mirthless way. One man sat in a corner with a\nproud dark face and brooding eagle eyes. He bowed with grave courtesy 25\nwhen I put down some money for cigarettes. A Huguenot, or I am mis-\ntaken.\nWe had been waiting for orders and now we suddenly left Capetown\non March 26, reaching East London on the 28th. There we disembarked,\nand I was surprised to find Leo Trevor, of amateur theatrical fame, acting 30\nas transport officer. In spite of his efforts (I hope it was not through them)\nour hospital stuff was divided between two trains, and when we reached\nBloemfontein after days of travel we found that the other half had wan-\ndered off and was engulfed in the general chaos. There were nights of that\njourney which I shall never forget \u2013 the great train roaring through the 35\ndarkness, the fires beside the line, the dark groups silhouetted against the\nflames, the shouts of \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and the crash of voices as our mates\ncried back, \u2018The Camerons,\u2019 for this famous regiment was our compan-\n135 the start for south africa\nion. Wonderful is the atmosphere of war. When the millennium comes\nthe world will gain much, but it will lose its greatest thrill.\nIt is a strange wild place, the veldt, with its vast green plains and pe-\nculiar flat-topped hills, relics of some extraordinary geological episode.\n5 It is poor pasture \u2013 a sheep to two acres \u2013 so it must always be sparse-\nly inhabited. Little white farms, each with its eucalyptus grove and its\ndam, were scattered over it. When we crossed the Free State border by a\nmakeshift bridge, beside the ruins of the old one, we noticed that many\nof these little houses were flying the white flag. Everyone seemed very\n10 good-humoured, burghers and soldiers alike, but the guerilla war after-\nwards altered all that.\nIt was April 2, and 5 a.m. when we at last reached the capital of the\nFree State, and were dumped down outside the town in a great green\nexpanse covered with all sorts of encampments and animals. There was\n15 said to be a large force of Boers close to the town, and they had cut up\none of our columns a few days before at Sanna\u2019s Post. Some troops were\nmoving out, so I, with Gwynne whom I had known in Egypt, and that\ngreat sportsman Claude de Crespigny, set forth to see what we could, an\nartilleryman lending me his led horse. There was nothing doing, how-\n20 ever, for it was Brother Boer\u2019s way never to come when you wanted him\nand always when you didn\u2019t. Save for good company, I got nothing out of\na long hot day.\nGood company is always one of the solaces of a campaign. I ran across\nmany old friends, some soldiers, some medicos, some journalists. Knight\n25 of the Falcon had, alas, been hit in an early battle and was in hospital.\nJulian Ralph, a veteran American correspondent, Bennett Burleigh the\nrugged old war horse, queer little Melton Prior who looked like the prim\nheadmaster of a conventional school, dark-eyed Donohue of the Chroni-\ncle, Paterson the Australian, of Snowy River fame, they were a wonderful\n30 set of men. I had little time to enjoy their society, however, for among the\nmiles of loaded trucks which lay at the endless sidings I had to my great\njoy discovered the missing half of our equipment and guided a fatigue\nparty down to it. All day we laboured and before evening our beds were\nup and our hospital ready for duty. Two days later wagons of sick and\n35 wounded began to disgorge at our doors and the real work had begun.\nWe had been given the cricket field as our camp and the fine pavilion\nas our chief ward. Others were soon erected, for we had plenty of tents\n\u2013 one each for our own use and a marquee for the mess. We were ready\n136 chapter 16\nfor any moderate strain, but that which was put upon us was altogether\nbeyond our strength and for a month we had a rather awful time. The\nfirst intimation of trouble came to me in a simple and dramatic way. We\nhad a bath in the pavilion and I had gone up to it and turned the tap,\nbut not a drop of water appeared, though it had been running freely the 5\nnight before. This small incident was the first intimation that the Boers\nhad cut the water supply of the town, which caused us to fall back upon\nthe old wells, which in turn gave rise to an outbreak of enteric which cost\nus 5,000 lives. The one great blot in Lord Roberts\u2019 otherwise splendid\nhandling of the campaign was, in my opinion, that he did not buzz out at 10\nonce with every man he could raise, and relieve the water-works, which\nwere only 20 miles away. Instead of this he waited for his army to recu-\nperate; and so exposed them to the epidemic. However, it is always easy\nto be wise after the event.\nThe outbreak was a terrible one. It was softened down for public con- 15\nsumption and the press messages were heavily censored, but we lived in\nthe midst of death \u2013 and death in its vilest, filthiest form. Our accommo-\ndation was for fifty patients, but 120 were precipitated upon us, and the\nfloor was littered between the beds with sick and often dying men. Our\nlinen and utensils were never calculated for such a number, and as the 20\nnature of the disease causes constant pollution, and this pollution of the\nmost dangerous character and with the vilest effluvia, one can imagine\nhow dreadful was the situation. The worst surgical ward after a battle\nwould be a clean place compared to that pavilion. At one end was a stage\nwith the scene set for H.M.S. Pinafore. This was turned into latrines for 25\nthose who could stagger so far. The rest did the best they could, and we\ndid the best we could in turn. But a Verestschagin would have found a\nsubject in that awful ward, with the rows of emaciated men, and the silly\nchildish stage looking down upon it all. In the very worst of it two nurs-\ning sisters appeared among us and never shall I forget what angels of light 30\nthey appeared, or how they nursed those poor boys, swaddling them like\nbabies and meeting every want with gentle courage. Thank God, they\nboth came through safe.\nFour weeks may seem a short time in comfort, but it is a very long\none under conditions such as those, amid horrible sights and sounds and 35\nsmells, while a haze of flies spreads over everything, covering your food\nand trying to force themselves into your mouth \u2013 every one of them a\nfocus of disease. It was bad enough when we had a full staff, but soon the\n137 the start for south africa\nmen began to wilt under the strain. They were nearly all from the Lanca-\nshire cotton mills, little, ill-nourished fellows but with a great spirit. Of\nthe fifteen twelve contracted the disease and added to the labours of the\nothers. Three died. Fortunately we of the staff were able to keep going,\n5 and we were reinforced by a Dr. Schwartz of Capetown. The pressure was\ngreat, but we were helped by the thought that the greater the work the\nmore we proved the necessity of our presence in Africa. Above all, our\nlabours were lightened by the splendid stuff that we had for patients. It\nwas really glorious to see the steady patience with which they bore their\n10 sufferings. The British soldier may grouse in days of peace, but I never\nheard a murmur when he was faced with this loathsome death.\nOur hospital was no worse off than the others, and as there were\nmany of them the general condition of the town was very bad. Coffins\nwere out of the question, and the men were lowered in their brown blan-\n15 kets into shallow graves at the average rate of sixty a day. A sickening\nsmell came from the stricken town. Once when I had ridden out to get\nan hour or two of change, and was at least 6 miles from the town the wind\nchanged and the smell was all around me. You could smell Bloemfontein\nlong before you could see it. Even now if I felt that low deathly smell,\n20 compounded of disease and disinfectants, my heart would sink within\nme.\nAt last there came the turn. The army had moved on. Hospitals up\nthe line absorbed some of the cases. Above all the water-works had been\nretaken, and with hardly any resistance. I went out with the force which\n25 was to retake it, and slept for the night in a thin coat under a wagon, an\nexperience which left me colder than I can ever remember being in my\nlife \u2013 a cold which was not only on the surface, but like some solid thing\nwithin you. Next morning there was every prospect of a battle, for we had\nbeen shelled the night before and it looked as if the position would be\n30 held, so Ian Hamilton, who commanded, made a careful advance. How-\never, there was no resistance, and save for some figures watching us from\ndistant hills there was no sign of the enemy. He had slipped away in the\nnight.\nIn the advance we passed over the Drift at Sanna\u2019s Post where the\n35 disaster had occurred some weeks before. The poor artillery horses were\nstill lying in heaps where they had been shot down, and the place was\ncovered with every kind of litter \u2013 putties, cholera belts, haversacks, and\nbroken helmets. There were great numbers of Boer cartridge papers\n138 chapter 16\nwhich were all marked \u2018Split Bullets. Manufactured for the Use of the\nBritish Government, London.\u2019 What the meaning of this was, or where\nthey came from, I cannot imagine, for certainly our fellows had always\nthe solid Lee-Metford bullet, as I can swear after inspecting many a belt.\nIt sounded like some ingenious trick to excuse atrocities, and yet on the 5\nwhole the Boer was a fair and good-humoured fighter until near the close\nof the war.\nThe move of Hamilton\u2019s was really the beginning of the great advance,\nand having cleared the water-works he turned north and became the\nright wing of the army. On his left was Tucker\u2019s 7th Division, then Kelly 10\nKenny\u2019s 6th Division, Pole-Carew\u2019s 1st Division, including the Guards,\nand finally a great horde of mounted infantry, including the Yeomanry,\nthe Colonial and the Irregular Corps. This was the great line which set\nforth early in May to sweep up from Bloemfontein to Pretoria. Things\nhad become more quiet at the hospital and presently Archie Langman 15\nand I found a chance to get away and to join the army at the first stage of\nits advance. I wrote our experience out while it was still fresh in my mind,\nand the reader will forgive me if I reproduce some of this, as it is likely to\nbe more vivid and more detailed than the blurred impression now left in\nmy memory after more than twenty years. 20\n139 Chapter 17\nDAYS WITH THE ARMY\n5 Pole-Carew \u2013 Tucker \u2013 Snipers \u2013 The Looted Farm \u2013 Taking of Brandfort \u2013\nArtillery Engagement \u2013 Advance of the Guards \u2013 The Wounded Scout \u2013 The\nDead Australian \u2013 Return.\nStand in the pass at Karee, and look north in the clear fresh morn-\n10 ing air! Before you lies a great plain, dull green, with white farmhouses\nscattered here and there. One great donga slashes across it. Distant hills\nbound it on all sides, and at the base of those in front, dimly seen, are a\nline of houses and a steeple. This is Brandfort, 10 miles off, and we are\nadvancing to attack it.\n15 The troops are moving forward, line after line of red face and khaki,\nwith rumbling columns of guns. Two men sit their horses beside us on\na knoll, and stare with their glasses at the distant houses. Gallant figures\nboth of them; the one spruce, debonnaire, well-groomed, with laughing\neyes and upward-curved moustache, a suggestion of schoolboy mischief\n20 about his handsome face; the other, grim, fierce, all nose and eyebrow,\nwhite scales of sun-dried skin hanging from his brick-red face. The first\nis Pole-Carew, General of Division; the second is Brigadier Stephenson.\nWe are finding our men, and these are among them.\nHere is another man worth noting. You could not help noting him if\n25 you tried. A burly, broad-shouldered man, with full, square, black beard\nover his chest, his arm in a sling, his bearing a medieval knight-errant.\nIt is Crabbe, of the Grenadier Guards. He reins his horse for an instant\nwhile his Guardsmen stream past him.\n\u2018I\u2019ve had my share \u2013 four bullets already. Hope I won\u2019t get another\n30 to-day.\u2019\n\u2018You should be in hospital.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, there I must venture to disagree with you.\u2019 He rides on with his\nmen.\nLook at the young officers of the Guards, the dandies of Mayfair.\n35 No carpet soldiers, these, but men who have spent six months upon the\nveldt, and fought from Belmont to Bloemfontein. Their walk is dainty,\ntheir putties are well rolled \u2013 there is still the suggestion of the West End.\nIf you look with your glasses on the left you may see movement on\n140 chapter 17\nthe farthest skyline. That is Hutton\u2019s Mounted Infantry, some thousands\nof them, to turn the flank of any resistance. As far as you can see to the\nright is Tucker\u2019s Division. Beyond that again are Ian Hamilton\u2019s Mounted\nInfantry and French\u2019s Cavalry. The whole front is a good 30 miles, and\n35,000 men go to the making of it. 5\nNow we advance over the great plain, the infantry in extended order,\na single company covering half a mile. Look at the scouts and the flankers\n\u2013 we should not have advanced like that six months ago. It is not our ad-\nditional numbers so much as our new warcraft which makes us formida-\nble. The big donga is only 2,000 yards off now, so we halt and have a good 10\nlook at it. Guns are unlimbered \u2013 just as well to be ready. Pole-Carew\nrides up like a schoolboy on a holiday.\n\u2018Who\u2019s seen old Tucker?\u2019 I hear him say, with his glasses to his eyes.\nHe had sent a message to the scouts. \u2018There now, look at that aide of\nmine. He has galloped along the donga to see if any Boers are in it. What 15\nright had he to do that? When I ask him he will say that he thought I was\nthere... Halloa, you, sir, why don\u2019t you come back straight?\u2019\n\u2018I did, sir.\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t. You rode along that donga.\u2019\n\u2018I thought you were there, sir.\u2019 20\n\u2018Don\u2019t add lying to your other vices.\u2019\nThe aide came grinning back. \u2018I was fired at, but I dare not tell the\nold man.\u2019\nRap! Rap! Rap! Rifles in front. Every one pricks up his ears. Is it the\ntransient sniper or the first shot of a battle? The shots come from the 25\nfarmhouse yonder. The 83rd Field Battery begin to fidget about their\nguns. The officer walks up and down and stares at the farmhouse. From\neither side two men pull out lines of string and give long, monotonous\ncries. They are the range-finders. A gunner on the limber is deep in a six-\npenny magazine, absorbed, his chin on his hand. 30\n\u2018Our scouts are past the house,\u2019 says an officer.\n\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 says the major.\nThe battery limbers up and the whole force advances to the farm-\nhouse. Off-saddle and a halt for luncheon.\nHalloa! Here are new and sinister developments. A Tommy drives a 35\nsmart buggy and pair out of the yard, looted for the use of the army. The\nfarm is prize of war, for have they not fired at our troops? They could not\nhelp the firing, poor souls, but still this sniping must be discouraged. We\n141 days with the army\nare taking off our gloves at last over this war. But the details are not pretty.\nA frightened girl runs out.\n\u2018Is it right that they kill fowls?\u2019 Alas! the question is hardly worth de-\nbating, for the fowls are dead. Erect and indignant, the girl drives in her\n5 three young turkeys. Men stare at her curiously, but she and her birds are\nnot molested.\nHere is something worse. A fat white pig all smothered in blood runs\npast. A soldier meets it, his bayonet at the charge. He lunges and lunges\nagain, and the pig screams horribly. I had rather see a man killed. Some\n10 are up in the loft throwing down the forage. Others root up the vege-\ntables. One drinks milk out of a chamber pot, amid the laughter of his\ncomrades. It is a grotesque and medieval scene.\nThe General rides up, but he has no consolation for the women. \u2018The\nfarm has brought it upon itself.\u2019 He rides away again.\n15 A parson rides up. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine why they don\u2019t burn it,\u2019 says he.\nA little Dutch boy stares with large, wondering grey eyes. He will tell\nall this to his grandchildren when we are in our graves.\n\u2018War is a terrible thing,\u2019 says the mother, in Dutch. The Tommies,\nwith curious eyes, cluster round the doors and windows, staring in at the\n20 family. There is no individual rudeness.\nOne Kaffir enters the room. \u2018A Kaffir!\u2019 cries the girl, with blazing eyes.\n\u2018Yes, a Kaffir,\u2019 says he defiantly \u2013 but he left.\n\u2018They won\u2019t burn the house, will they?\u2019 cries the mother.\n\u2018No, no,\u2019 we answer; \u2018they will not burn the house.\u2019\n25 We advance again after lunch, the houses and steeple much nearer.\nBoom! Boom! Boom! Cannon at last!\nBut it is far away, over at Tucker\u2019s side. There are little white puffs on\nthe distant green hills. Those are shells bursting. If you look through your\nglasses you will see \u2013 eight miles off \u2013 a British battery in action. Some-\n30 times a cloud of dust rises over it. That is a Boer shell which has knocked\nup the dust. No Boers can be seen from here.\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\nIt becomes monotonous. \u2018Old Tucker is getting it hot!\u2019 Bother old\nTucker, let us push on to Brandfort.\n35 On again over the great plain, the firing dying away on the right. We\nhave had a gun knocked off its wheels and twelve men hit over there.\nBut now Hutton\u2019s turning movement is complete, and they close in on\nthe left of Brandfort. A pom-pom quacks like some horrid bird among\n142 chapter 17\nthe hills. Our horse artillery are banging away. White spurts of shrapnel\nrise along the ridge. The leading infantry bend their backs and quicken\ntheir pace. We gallop to the front, but the resistance has collapsed. The\nmounted men are riding forward and the guns are silent. Long, sunlit\nhills stretch peacefully before us. 5\nI ride through the infantry again. \u2018The bloody blister on my toe has\nbust.\u2019 \u2018This blasted water-bottle!\u2019 Every second man has a pipe between\nhis parched lips.\nThe town is to the right, and two miles of plain intervene. On the\nplain a horseman is rounding up some mares and foals. I recognize him 10\nas I pass \u2013 Burdett-Coutts \u2013 a well-known figure in society. Mr. Maxwell\nof the Morning Post suggests that we ride to the town and chance it. \u2018Our\nmen are sure to be there.\u2019 No sign of them across the plain, but we will try.\nHe outrides me, but courteously waits, and we enter the town together.\nYes, it\u2019s all right; there\u2019s a Rimington Scout in the main street \u2013 a group 15\nof them, in fact.\nA young Boer, new caught, stands among the horsemen. He is dis-\ncomposed \u2013 not much. A strong, rather coarse face; well-dressed; might\nappear, as he stands, in an English hunting-field as a young yeoman farm-\ner. 20\n\u2018Comes of being fond of the ladies,\u2019 said the Australian sergeant.\n\u2018Wanted to get her out of the town,\u2019 said the Boer. Another was\nbrought up. \u2018I\u2019d have got off in a minute,\u2019 says he.\n\u2018You\u2019d have got off as it was if you had the pluck of a louse,\u2019 says his\ncaptor. The conversation languished after that. 25\nIn came the Staff, galloping grandly. The town is ours.\nA red-headed Irish-American is taken on the kopje. \u2018What the hell is\nthat to you?\u2019 he says to every question. He is haled away to gaol \u2013 a foul-\nmouthed blackguard.\nWe find the landlady of our small hotel in tears \u2013 her husband in gaol, 30\nbecause a rifle has been found. We try to get him out, and succeed. He\ncharges us 4s. for half a bottle of beer, and we wonder whether we cannot\nget him back into gaol again.\n\u2018The house is not my own. I find great burly men everywhere,\u2019 he\ncries, with tears in his eyes. His bar is fitted with pornographic pictures to 35\namuse our simple farmer friends \u2013 not the first or the second sign which I\nhave seen that pastoral life and a Puritan creed do not mean a high public\nmorality.\n143 days with the army\nWe sit on the stoep and smoke in the moonlight. There comes a\ndrunken inhabitant down the main street. A dingy Tommy stands on\nguard in front.\n\u2018Halt! Who goes there?\u2019\n5 \u2018A friend.\u2019\n\u2018Give the countersign!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m a free-born Englishman!\u2019\n\u2018Give the countersign!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m a free-born \u2013 \u2019 With a rattle the sentry\u2019s rifle came to his shoulder\n10 and the moon glinted on his bayonet.\n\u2018Hi, stop!\u2019 cries a senior Correspondent. \u2018You Juggins, you\u2019ll be shot!\nDon\u2019t fire, sentry!\u2019\nTommy raised his rifle reluctantly and advanced to the man. \u2018What\nshall I do with him, sir?\u2019 he asked the Correspondent.\n15 \u2018Oh, what you like!\u2019 He vanished out of history.\nI talk politics with Free Staters. The best opening is to begin, in an\ninquiring tone, \u2018Why did you people declare war upon us?\u2019 They have\ngot into such an injured-innocence state that it comes quite as a shock\nto them when they are reminded that they were the attackers. By this\n20 Socratic method one attains some interesting results. It is evident that\nthey all thought they could win easily, and that they are very bitter now\nagainst the Transvaal. They are mortally sick of the war; but, for that mat-\nter, so are most of the British officers. It has seemed to me sometimes\nthat it would be more judicious, and even more honourable, if some of\n25 the latter were less open about the extent to which they are \u2018fed-up.\u2019 It\ncannot be inspiriting for their men. At the same time there would be a\nmutiny in the Army if any conditions short of absolute surrender were\naccepted \u2013 and in spite of their talk, if a free pass were given to-day, I am\nconvinced that very few officers would return until the job was done.\n30 Our railway engineers are great. The train was in Brandfort next day,\nin spite of broken bridges, smashed culverts, twisted metals, every sort of\nwrecking. So now we are ready for another 20 miles Pretoriawards. The\nVet River is our goal this time, and off we go with the early morning.\nAnother great green plain, with dotted farms and the huge khaki col-\n35 umn slowly spreading across it. The day was hot, and 10 miles out the\nGuards had about enough. Stragglers lay thick among the grass, but the\ncompanies kept their double line formation, and plodded steadily along.\nTen miles sounds very little, but try it in the dust of a column on a hot\n144 chapter 17\nday, with a rifle over your shoulder, a hundred rounds of ammunition, a\nblanket, a canteen, an empty water-bottle, and a dry tongue.\nA grey-bearded padre limped bravely beside his men.\n\u2018No, no,\u2019 says he, when offered my horse. \u2018I must not spoil my record.\u2019\nThe men are silent on the march; no band, no singing. 5\nGrim and sullen, the column flows across the veldt. Officers and men\nare short in their tempers.\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you,\u2019 etc., etc., bleats a subaltern.\n\u2018Because I never can hear what you say,\u2019 says the corporal.\nThey halt for a midday rest, and it seems to me, as I move among 10\nthem, that there is too much nagging on the part of the officers. We have\npaid too much attention to the German military methods. Our true mod-\nel should have been the American, for it is what was evolved by the An-\nglo-Celtic race in the greatest experience of war which the Anglo-Celtic\nrace has ever had. 15\nOn we go again over that great plain. Is there anything waiting for\nus down yonder where the low kopjes lie? The Boers have always held\nrivers. They held the Modder. They held the Tugela. Will they hold the\nVet? Halloa, what\u2019s this?\nA startled man in a night-cap on a dapple-grey horse. He gesticulates. 20\n\u2018Fifty of them \u2013 hot corner \u2013 captain shot \u2013 lost my helmet.\u2019 We catch bits\nof his talk. But what\u2019s that on the dapple-grey\u2019s side? The horse is shot\nthrough the body. He grazes quietly with black streaks running down the\nreeking hair.\n\u2018A West Australian, sir. They shot turble bad, for we were within 50 25\nyards before they loosed off.\u2019\n\u2018Which kopje?\u2019\n\u2018That one over yonder.\u2019\nWe ride forward, and pass through the open ranks of the Guards\u2019\nskirmishers. Behind us the two huge naval guns are coming majestically 30\nup, drawn by their thirty oxen, like great hock-bottles on wheels. In front\na battery has unlimbered. We ride up to the side of it. Away in front lies\na small, slate-roofed farm beside the kopje. The Mounted Infantry have\ncoalesced into one body and are moving towards us. \u2018Here\u2019s the circus.\nThere is going to be a battle,\u2019 was an infantry phrase in the American War. 35\nOur circus was coming in, and perhaps the other would follow.\nThe battery (84th R.F.A.) settles down to its work.\nBang! I saw the shell burst on a hillside far away.\n145 days with the army\n\u20183,500,\u2019 says somebody. Bang! \u20183,250,\u2019 says the voice. Bang! \u20183,300.\u2019 A\npuff shoots up from the distant grey roof as if their chimney were on fire.\n\u2018Got him that time!\u2019\nThe game seems to us rather one-sided, but who is that shooting in\n5 the distance?\n\u2018Wheeeeee\u2019 \u2013 what a hungry whine, and then a dull muffled \u2018Ooof!\u2019\nUp goes half a cartload of earth about 100 yards ahead of the battery. The\ngunners take as much notice as if it were a potato.\n\u2018Wheeeeeee \u2013 ooof!\u2019 Fifty yards in front this time.\n10 \u2018Bang! Bang!\u2019 go the crisp English guns.\n\u2018Wheeeeee \u2013 ooof!\u2019 Fifty yards behind the battery. They\u2019ll get it next\ntime as sure as fate. Gunners go on unconcernedly. \u2018Wheeeeee-ooof!\u2019\nRight between the guns, by George! Two guns invisible for the dust.\nGood heavens, how many of our gunners are left? Dust settles, and they\n15 are all bending and straining and pulling the same as ever.\nAnother shell and another, and then a variety, for there comes a shell\nwhich breaks high up in the air \u2013 wheeeeee \u2013 tang \u2013 with a musical, res-\nonant note, like the snapping of a huge banjo-string, and a quarter of an\nacre of ground spurted into little dust-clouds under the shrapnel. The\n20 gunners take no interest in it. Percussion or shrapnel, fire what you will,\nyou must knock the gun off its wheels or the man off his pins before you\nsettle the R.F.A.\nBut every shell is bursting true, and it is mere luck that half the bat-\ntery are not down. Once only did I see a man throw back his head a few\n25 inches as a shell burst before him. The others might have been parts of\nan automatic machine. But the officer decided to shift the guns \u2013 and\nthey are shifted. They trot away for half a mile to the right and come into\naction again.\nThe lonely hero is the man to be admired. It is easy to be collectively\n30 brave. A man with any sense of proportion feels himself to be such a mite\nin the presence of the making of history that his own individual welfare\nseems for the moment too insignificant to think of. The unit is lost in the\nmass. But now we find ourselves alone on the plain with the battery away\nto the right.\n35 The nerves of the novice are strung up by the sound of the shells, but\nthere is something of exhilaration in the feeling also.\nThere is a fence about 200 yards off, and to this we tether our horses,\nand we walk up and down trying with our glasses to spot where the Boer\n146 chapter 17\nguns are. We have suspicions, but nothing more. Our gunners may know,\nbut we do not feel confident about it. Surely the stealthy lurking gun is\nworth six guns which stand bravely forth in the open. These farmers have\ntaught our riflemen their business, and they bid fair to alter the artillery\nsystems of the world as well. Our guns and theirs are like a fight between 5\na blind man and one who can see.\nAn artillery colonel is wandering loose, and we talk. He has no job\nof his own, so he comes, like the coachman on a holiday, to watch some\nother man\u2019s guns at work. A shell falls some distance short of us.\n\u2018The next one,\u2019 says the colonel, \u2018will go over our heads. Come and 10\nstand over here.\u2019 I do so, with many mental reservations. Wheeeeeeee \u2013\n\u2018Here it comes!\u2019 says the colonel. \u2018Here I go!\u2019 think I. It burst on our\nlevel, but 40 yards to the right. I secure a piece as a souvenir.\n\u2018Shall we wait for another?\u2019 I began to be sorry that I met the colonel.\nBut a new sensation breaks upon us. Looking back we see that two 15\nmonster naval guns are coming into action not fifty yards from our teth-\nered horses, which stand in a dead line before their huge muzzles. We\nonly just got them clear in time. Bang! the father of all the bangs this\ntime, and a pillar of white smoke with a black heart to it on the farther\nhill. I can see some riders, like ants, going across it \u2013 Boers on the trek. 20\nOur men take the huge brass cartridge-case out of the gun.\n\u2018Can I have that?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly,\u2019 says the lieutenant.\nI tie it on to my saddle, and feel apologetic toward my long-suffering\nhorse. The great gun roars and roars and the malignant spouts of smoke 25\nrise on the farthest hill.\nA line of infantry in very open order comes past the great guns, and I\nadvance a little way with them. They are Scots Guards. The first line goes\nforward, the second is halted and lying down.\n\u2018That\u2019s right! Show where you are!\u2019 cries the second line, derisively. 30\nI seem to have missed the point, but the young officer in the first line is\nvery angry.\n\u2018Hold your tongues \u2013 !\u2019 he shouts, with his red face looking over his\nshoulder. \u2018Too many orders. No one gives orders but me.\u2019 His men lie\ndown. The sun is sinking low, and it is evident that the contemplated in- 35\nfantry assault will not come off. One of the great naval shells passes high\nover our heads. It is the sound of a distant train in a tunnel.\nA man canters past with a stretcher over his shoulder. His bay horse\n147 days with the army\nlollops along, but the stretcher makes him look very top-heavy. He passes\nthe guns and the infantry, and rides on along the edge of a maize field. He\nis half a mile out now, heading for the kopje. Every instant I expect to see\nhim drop from his horse. Then he vanishes in a dip of the ground.\n5 After a time the stretcher appears again.\nThis time two men are carrying it, and the horseman rides beside. I\nhave bandages in my pocket, so I ride forward also.\n\u2018Has a surgeon seen him?\u2019\n\u2018No, sir.\u2019 They lay the man down. There is a handkerchief over his face.\n10 \u2018Where is it?\u2019\n\u2018His stomach and his arm.\u2019 I pull up his shirt, and there is the Mauser\nbullet lying obvious under the skin. It has gone round instead of pene-\ntrating. A slit with a pen-knife would extract it, but that had better be left\nfor chloroform and the field hospital. Nice clean wound in the arm.\n15 \u2018You will do very well. What is your name?\u2019\n\u2018Private Smith, sir. New Zealander.\u2019 I mention my name and the\nLangman Hospital at Bloemfontein.\n\u2018I\u2019ve read your books,\u2019 says he, and is carried onwards.\nThere has been a lull in the firing and the sun is very low. Then after a\n20 long interval comes a last Boer shell.\nIt is an obvious insult, aimed at nothing, a derisive good-night and\ngood-bye. The two naval guns put up their long necks and both roared\ntogether. It was the last word of the Empire \u2013 the mighty angry voice call-\ning over the veldt. The red rim had sunk and all was purple and crimson,\n25 with the white moon high in the west. What had happened? Who had\nwon? Were other columns engaged? No one knew anything or seemed to\ncare. But late at night as I lay under the stars I saw on the left front signal\nflashes from over the river, and I knew that Hutton was there.\nSo it proved, for in the morning it was over the camp in an instant\n30 that the enemy had gone. But the troops were early afoot. Long before\ndawn came the weird, muffled tapping of the drums and the crackling of\nsticks as the camp-kettles were heated for breakfast. Then with the first\nlight we saw a strange sight. A monstrous blister was rising slowly from\nthe veldt. It was the balloon being inflated \u2013 our answer to the lurking\n35 guns. We would throw away no chances now, but play every card in our\nhand \u2013 another lesson which the war has driven into our proud hearts.\nThe army moved on, with the absurd windbag flapping over the heads of\nthe column. We climbed the kopjes where the enemy had crouched, and\n148 chapter 17\nsaw the litter of empty Mauser cases and the sangars so cunningly built.\nAmong the stones lay a packet of the venomous-looking green cartridges\nstill unfired. They talk of poison, but I doubt it. Verdigris would be an\nantiseptic rather than a poison in a wound. It is more likely that it is some\ndecomposition of the wax in which the bullets are dipped. Brother Boer 5\nis not a Bushman after all. He is a tough, stubborn fighter, who plays a\nclose game, but does not cheat.\nWe say good-bye to the army, for our duty lies behind us and theirs in\nfront. For them the bullets, for us the microbes, and both for the honour\nof the flag. Scattered trails of wagons, ambulance carts, private buggies, 10\nimpedimenta of all kinds, radiate out from the army. It is a bad drift, and\nit will be nightfall before they are all over. We pass the last of them, and it\nseems strange to emerge from that great concourse and see the 20 miles\nof broad, lonely plain which lies between us and Brandfort. We shall look\nrather foolish if any Boer horsemen are hanging about the skirts of the 15\narmy.\nWe passed the battlefield of last night, and stopped to examine the\nholes made by the shells. Three had fallen within 10 yards, but the ant-\nheaps round had not been struck, showing how harmless the most se-\nvere shellfire must be to prostrate infantry. From the marks in the clay 20\nthe shells were large ones \u2013 forty-pounders, in all probability. In a little\nheap lay the complete kit of a Guardsman \u2013 his canteen, water-bottle,\ncup, even his putties. He had stripped for action with a vengeance. Poor\ndevil, how uncomfortable he must be to-day!\nA Kaffir on horseback is rounding up horses on the plain. He gallops 25\ntowards us \u2013 a picturesque, black figure on his shaggy Basuto mount. He\nwaves his hand excitedly towards the east.\n\u2018Englishman there \u2013 on veldt \u2013 hurt \u2013 Dutchman shoot him.\u2019 He de-\nlivers his message clearly enough.\n\u2018Is he alive?\u2019 He nods. 30\n\u2018When did you see him?\u2019 He points to the sun and then farther east.\nAbout two hours ago apparently.\n\u2018Can you take us there?\u2019 We buy him for 2s., and all canter off togeth-\ner.\nOur road is through maize fields and then out on to the veldt. By 35\nJove, what\u2019s that? There is a single black motionless figure in the middle\nof that clearing. We gallop up and spring from our horses. A short, mus-\ncular, dark man is lying there with a yellow, waxen face, and a blood-clot\n149 days with the army\nover his mouth. A handsome man, black-haired, black moustached, his\nexpression serene \u2013 No. 410 New South Wales Mounted Infantry \u2013 shot,\noverlooked and abandoned. There are evident signs that he was not alive\nwhen the Kaffir saw him. Rifle and horse are gone. His watch lies in front\n5 of him, dial upwards, run down at one in the morning. Poor chap, he had\ncounted the hours until he could see them no longer.\nWe examine him for injuries. Obviously he had bled to death. There\nis a horrible wound in his stomach. His arm is shot through. Beside him\nlies his water-bottle \u2013 a little water still in it, so he was not tortured by\n10 thirst. And there is a singular point. On the water-bottle is balanced a red\nchess pawn. Has he died playing with it? It looks like it. Where are the\nother chessmen? We find them in a haversack out of his reach. A singular\ntrooper this, who carries chessmen on a campaign. Or is it loot from a\nfarmhouse? I shrewdly suspect it.\n15 We collect the poor little effects of No. 410 \u2013 a bandolier, a stylo-\ngraphic pen, a silk handkerchief, a clasp-knife, a Waterbury watch, \u00a32 6s.\n6d. in a frayed purse. Then we lift him, our hands sticky with his blood,\nand get him over my saddle \u2013 horrible to see how the flies swarm instantly\non to the saddle-flaps. His head hangs down on one side and his heels\n20 on the other. We lead the horse, and when from time to time he gives a\nhorrid dive we clutch at his ankles. Thank Heaven, he never fell. It is two\nmiles to the road, and there we lay our burden under a telegraph post. A\nconvoy is coming up, and we can ask them to give him a decent burial.\nNo. 410 holds one rigid arm and clenched fist in the air. We lower it, but\n25 up it springs, menacing, aggressive. I put his mantle over him; but still,\nas we look back, we see the projection of that raised arm. So he met his\nend \u2013somebody\u2019s boy. Fair fight, open air, and a great cause \u2013 I know no\nbetter death.\nA long, long ride on tired horses over an endless plain. Here and there\n30 mounted Kaffirs circle and swoop. I have an idea that a few mounted po-\nlice might be well employed in our rear. How do we know what these\nKaffirs may do among lonely farms held by women and children? Very\ncertain I am that it is not their own horses which they are rounding up\nso eagerly.\n35 Ten miles have passed, and we leave the track to water our horses at\nthe dam. A black mare hard-by is rolling and kicking. Curious that she\nshould be so playful. We look again, and she lies very quiet. One more\nhas gone to poison the air of the veldt. We sit by the dam and smoke.\n150 chapter 17\nDown the track there comes a Colonial corps of cavalry \u2013 a famous corps,\nas we see when our glasses show us the colour of the cockades. Good\nheavens, will we never have sense beaten into us? How many disasters\nand humiliations must we endure before we learn how to soldier? The\nregiment passes without a vanguard, without scouts, without flankers, 5\nin an enemy\u2019s country intersected by dongas. Oh, for a Napoleon who\nmight meet such a regiment, tear the epaulettes of the colonel from his\nshoulders, Stellenbosch him instantly without appeal or argument. Only\nsuch a man with such powers can ever thoroughly reorganize our army.\nAnother six miles over the great plain. Here is a small convoy, with an 10\nescort of militia, only a mile or two out from Brandfort. They are heading\nwrong, so we set them right. The captain in charge is excited.\n\u2018There are Boers on that hill!\u2019 The hill is only half a mile or so away on\nour left; so we find the subject interesting. \u2018Kaffirs!\u2019 we suggest.\n\u2018No, no, mounted men with bandoliers and rifles. Why, there they 15\nare now.\u2019 We see moving figures, but again suggest Kaffirs. It ends by our\nboth departing unconvinced. We thought the young officer jumpy over\nhis first convoy, but we owe him an apology, for next morning we learned\nthat the Mounted Infantry had been out all night chasing the very men\nwhom we had seen. It is likely that the accidental presence of the convoy 20\nsaved us from a somewhat longer journey than we had intended.\nA day at Brandfort, a night in an open truck, and we were back at the\nCaf\u00e9 Enterique, Boulevard des Microbes, which is our town address.\n151 Chapter 18\nFINAL EXPERIENCES IN SOUTH AFRICA\n5 Military Jealousies \u2013 Football \u2013 Cracked Ribs \u2013 A Mutiny \u2013 De Wet \u2013 A\nHistorian under Difficulties \u2013 Pretoria \u2013 Lord Roberts \u2013 With the Boers \u2013\nMemorable Operation \u2013 Altercation.\nMilitary men are more full of jealousies and more prone to divide\n10 into cliques than any set of men whom I have met. South Africa was rent\nwith their quarrels, and one heard on every side of how General This\nwas daggers drawn with General That. But the great cleavage of all was\nbetween the Roberts men and the Buller men. The former were certainly\nvery bitter against the reliever of Ladysmith, and the comments about\n15 the difference between his evening telegrams and those of next morning\nwere painful to hear. I had, however, less sympathy, as Buller was a\ncoarse-fibred man, though a brave soldier. Several authentic anecdotes\npointed to this want of perception. When, for example, he entered\nLadysmith the defenders saved up a few cakes and other luxuries for the\n20 day of their release. These they laid before Buller at the welcoming lunch.\n\u2018I thought you were a starving city,\u2019 said he, looking round at them. This\nstory I heard from several men who claimed to speak with knowledge as\nwell as bitterness. It would have been sad had Buller\u2019s long meritorious,\nhard-fighting career gone down in clouds, but it cannot be denied that\n25 in the French, or I think in any other service, he could not have survived\nColenso. The strange speech which he made at a London luncheon after\nthe war proved, I think, that his mind had lost something of its grip of re-\nalities. Roberts, as usual, played the noblest possible part in this unhappy\ncontroversy.\n30 \u2018I shall handle Buller with all possible tenderness,\u2019 he said to one of\nhis Staff, and he lived up to his words.\nI found the hospital upon my return to be in a very improved condi-\ntion. I fell ill myself, however, though it was not serious enough to inca-\npacitate me. I still think that if I had not been inoculated I should at that\n35 time have had enteric, and there was surely something insidious in my\nsystem, for it was a good ten years before my digestion had recovered\nits tone. My condition was not improved by a severe bruising of the ribs\ncaused by a foul in one of the inter-hospital football matches which we\n152 chapter 18\nhad organized in order to take the minds of the men from their incessant\nwork. Charles Gibbs strapped me up with plaster, as in a corset, but I was\ngetting too old for rough handling which I could have smiled at in my\nyouth.\nOne quaint memory of those days rises before me. There was a sharp 5\nquarrel between Drury, our Military C.O. representing routine disci-\npline, and our cooks and servants representing civilian ideas of liberty.\nIt was mishandled and had reached such a point when I returned from\nthe front that the men were on absolute strike, the work was disorgan-\nized and the patients were suffering. Drury was breathing fire and fury, 10\nwhich only made the men more obdurate. It really looked as if there\nmight be a considerable scandal, and I felt that it was just such a case as\nMr. Langman would have wished me to handle. I asked leave of Major\nDrury, therefore, that I might take the matter up, and he was, I fancy, very\nglad that I should, for he was at the end of his resources, and a public 15\nexposure of a disorganized unit means also a discredited Commander. I\ntherefore sat behind the long mess-table, and had the six ringleaders be-\nfore me, all standing in a line with sullen mutiny in their faces. I talked to\nthem gently and quietly, saying that I was in some sense responsible for\nthem, since several of them had been enlisted by me. I sympathized with 20\nthem in all they had gone through, and said that all our nerves had been\na little overstrained, but that Duty and Discipline must rise above our\nbodily weakness. No doubt their superiors had also been strained and\nsome allowance must be made on both sides. I then took a graver tone.\n\u2018This matter is just going forward for court martial and I have intervened 25\nat the last instant. You clearly understand your own position. You have\ndisobeyed orders on active service in the presence of the enemy. There\nis only one punishment possible for such an offence. It is death.\u2019 Six pairs\nof eyes stared wildly in front of me. Having produced my effect I went\ninto their grievances, promised that they should be considered, and de- 30\nmanded an apology to Major Drury as the condition for doing anything\nfurther. They were six chastened men who filed out of the marquee, the\napology was forthcoming, and there were no more troubles in the camp.\nAn anxiety came to us about this time from a very unexpected cause,\nfor Archie Langman, who had been my good comrade in my visit to the 35\narmy, went off again, trekking up country with the Imperial Yeomanry\nHospital and ran right into the arms of De Wet, who had just raided the\nline and won a small victory at a place called Roodeval. The famous gue-\n153 final experiences in south africa\nrilla leader was stern but just, and he treated the hospital men with con-\nsideration, so that Archie returned none the worse for his adventure. But\nthere was a bad day or two for me between our learning of his capture\nand of his release.\n5 The army had got forward with little fighting, and Pretoria was in our\nhands. It seemed to all of us that the campaign was over and that only\ncleaning-up remained to be done. I began to consider my own return\nto Europe, and there were two potent influences which drew me, apart\nfrom the fact that the medical pressure no longer existed. The first was\n10 that I had during all this time continued to write the History of the War,\ndrawing my material very often from the eye-witnesses to these events.\nBut there was a good deal which could only be got at the centre, and\ntherefore if my book was to be ready before that of my rivals it was neces-\nsary for me to be on the spot. The second was that a political crisis and a\n15 general election were coming on, and it was on the cards that I might be\na candidate. I could not, however, leave Africa until I had seen Pretoria,\nso, with some difficulty, I obtained leave and was off on the much-broken\nand precarious railway on June 22.\nThat journey was certainly the strangest railway journey of my life.\n20 From minute to minute one never knew what would happen. I was in\nthe good company of Major Hanbury Williams, Lord Milner\u2019s Secretary,\nwho allowed me to share his special carriage, and we had with us a lit-\ntle alert man named Amery, then unknown to fame, but now deservedly\nin the seats of the mighty. There were others but I have forgotten them.\n25 When the train stopped in the middle of the veldt, which it continually\ndid, one never knew whether it was for five minutes or for five hours, as\ndid actually occur, and as it went on again without warning one had to\nsit tight. We met a down train with its windows shattered and heard that\ntwenty folk had been injured in a Boer ambuscade. Every hour we ex-\n30 pected to be attacked. Once during one of our long halts we saw a horse-\nman come cantering over the great green expanse. We got out to see and\ninterview him. He was a tall, slab-sided fellow, unarmed, but with a rak-\nish debonnaire look to him. He said he was a loyal British farmer, but I\nhad no doubt in my own mind that he was a Boer scout who wanted to\n35 see what our train was carrying. He sat easy in his saddle for some little\ntime, chatting with us, and then suddenly wheeled his grey horse round\nand galloped away. Some way further down the line we saw a farm burn-\ning, and a fringe of our irregulars riding round it. I was told that it was one\n154 chapter 18\nof De Wet\u2019s farms and that it was a punishment for cutting the line. The\nwhole scene might have been the middle ages \u2013 say a company of Moss\ntroopers on a raid over the English border.\nWhen we came to the place of the Roodeval disaster, where our Der-\nbyshire militia had been sadly cut up by De Wet, the train had to stop, for 5\nthe line was under repair, and we were able to go over the ground. The\nplace was littered with shells for the heavy guns taken from some looted\ntrain. Then there were acres covered with charred or partly charred letters,\nblowing about in the wind, for De Wet had burned the mailbags \u2013 one\nof his less sportsmanlike actions. Napoleon went one better, however, on 10\na certain occasion when he published an intercepted British mail, which\nled to a British reprisal of the same sort, not at all conducive to the peace\nof families. I picked up one letter which fluttered up to me, and I read in\nrough handwriting, \u2018I hope you have killed all them Boers by now,\u2019 with\nmany x (kisses) underneath. Among other things were some of the band 15\ninstruments, across which De Wet had driven his heavy wagons.\nIt gave me a strange thrill when I looked out early one morning at a\ndeserted platform and saw the word Pretoria printed upon a board. Here\nwe were at last at the very centre of all things. The Transvaal Hotel was\nopen and for several days it was my head-quarters while I examined men 20\nand things. One of my first tasks was to see Lord Roberts, who desired to\ninterview me on account of some sensational articles by Burdett-Coutts\nwhich had appeared in the London Press upon the state of the hospitals.\nOf course that state had in many cases, possibly in all, been awful, but the\nreason lay in the terrible and sudden emergency. Everyone had done his 25\nbest to meet it and had met it to a surprising degree, but cases of hard-\nship were numerous all the same. This I explained to Lord Roberts \u2013 and\nalso to the Royal Commission in London. As an unpaid independent\nvolunteer my words may have had more weight than those of some far\ngreater authority who was personally involved. I can see Roberts now as 30\nhe sat behind a small desk in his room. His face looked red and engorged,\nbut that was due no doubt to his life in the sun. He was urbane and alert,\nreminding me at once of our former meeting in London. His light blue\neyes were full of intelligence and kindness, but they had the watery look\nof age. Indeed, I can hardly remember in all military history a case where 35\na man over seventy had been called out from retirement to conduct so\narduous a campaign, and it was his conception of the fine flank march\nto Paardeburg which had actually beaten the Boers, however long they\n155 final experiences in south africa\nmight keep up appearances of resistance. We had a short vivid talk and\nI never saw him again until he came to my own house at Hindhead to\ninspect my rifle range in 1902.\nOf Lord Kitchener I saw nothing at Pretoria, but on one occasion a\n5 big man on a huge bay horse went past me at a hand gallop on the veldt,\nand as he passed he waved his hand, and I knew it was the famous soldier.\nHe had been under a cloud since Paardeburg, and indeed it is hard to see\nhow his tactics can be justified, since he attacked the Boers and lost some\n2,000 men, when they were headed off and were bound to surrender in\n10 any case. There may be reasons unknown to a civilian, but I have heard\nsoldiers speak warmly about it, for some of the attackers were mounted\ntroops who had to gallop to the edge of the donga, and could do nothing\nwhen they got there. Colonel Hannay actually registered some protest\nbefore obeying the orders in which he and many of his men met their\n15 death. However, it was to Kitchener that all men turned now when the\norganization of the lines of communication was the vital point, and that\nrather than actual battle was his forte. I have been told by some who have\nbeen in action with him that he became nervously restless and impatient\nin a fight, while Roberts, on the other hand, became cooler and more\n20 quiet the greater the danger grew. In organization, however, Kitchener\nwas inhuman in his cool accuracy. \u2018Regret to report great dynamite ex-\nplosion. Forty Kaffirs killed,\u2019 was the report of one officer. \u2018Do you need\nmore dynamite?\u2019 was the answering telegram from Lord Kitchener.\nThere was a bench outside my hotel on which a group of old beard-\n25 ed burghers used to smoke their pipes every day. I went down and sat\namong them with my Boer pipe filled with the best Magaliesburg. I said\nnothing, so soon they began to make advances, speaking excellent Eng-\nlish in rough guttural fashion. Botha was not far from the town, and it\nwas notorious that spies took him out the news every night. These old\n30 fellows were clearly a collecting station, so I thought it would be useful\nto give them something to ponder. After conversational remarks one of\nthem said: \u2018Tell us, Mister, when are we to have peace?\u2019 They were under\nthe impression that the whole British nation was longing for peace, and\nit was this which encouraged the resistance. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said I, \u2018I hope not for\n35 a long time yet.\u2019 They all looked at each other, and then the spokesman\nsaid: \u2018Why do you say that, Mister?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s this way,\u2019 said I. \u2018This coun-\ntry, you see, is going to be a British Colony. It would be very awkward\nfor us to have a Colony which was full of dangerous men. We couldn\u2019t\n156 chapter 18\nkill them then, could we? They would be fellow-citizens and under the\nlaw\u2019s protection, the same as we. Our only chance is to kill them now, and\nthat\u2019s what we will do if we have the time.\u2019 The old fellows all grunted and\npuffed furiously at their pipes, but they could find no answer. Possibly\nsome version of the matter may have reached the point I was aiming at. 5\nOur longest excursion from Pretoria was to Waterval, whither Ben-\nnett Burleigh took me in his Cape cart. Once we got quite close to a Boer\npatrol, about a dozen horsemen. Burleigh could not believe that they\nwere actually the enemy until I pointed out that several of the horses\nwere white, which was hardly ever known in our service. He then ex- 10\namined them with his glass, and found I was right. They were clearly on\nsome quest of their own, for they took no notice of us, though they could\neasily have cut us off. Our drive took us to the great prison camp where\nso many British and Colonial soldiers had a humiliating experience. The\nprisoners had only got free a week or two before, and the whole place, 15\nmany acres in size, was covered with every sort of souvenir. I contented\nmyself with a Boer carbine which had been broken by a British prisoner,\na band triangle, a half-knitted sock, the knitting needles being made from\nthe barbed wire, and a set of leg fetters from the camp gaol. A tunnel\nhad been bored just before the general delivery by some captive Hus- 20\nsars. It was a wonderful work, considering that it was done chiefly with\nspoons, and it had just been finished when relief came. I descended into\nit, and was photographed by Burleigh as I emerged. I daresay many of my\nfriends have copies of it still, with my inscription: \u2018Getting out of a hole,\nlike the British Empire.\u2019 25\nI spent a day in Johannesburg, walking its deserted streets and seeing\nits great mines now dead or at least in suspended animation. I descended\none of the deep mines, the Robinson, but as the hoisting machinery was\nout of order, and we had to walk in darkness down hundreds (it seemed\nthousands) of slippery wooden steps, with buckets, which did the drain- 30\ning, clanking past one\u2019s ear, it was certainly an over-rated amusement. We\ngot the usual tips as to which mines were going to boom \u2013 on all of which\nI acted, and all of which proved to be wrong.\nOn July 4, after an uneventful journey, which proved in itself that our\ngrip was tightening upon the country, I found myself back in the Lang- 35\nman Hospital again. Times were quiet there, though another of our poor\norderlies had just died of erysipelas, which had broken out in the wards\n\u2013 not traumatic erysipelas, but a variety which came without apparent\n157 final experiences in south africa\ncause. I mention the fact because enteric had been so universal that there\nreally seemed no other disease, and this was the only appearance of any\nother ailment. If the army had all been inoculated, this would, I think,\nhave been absolutely the healthiest war on record. Of surgical cases we\n5 had few, but I remember one operation which is perhaps rather technical\nfor discussion and yet stands out very clearly in my memory. It was per-\nformed upon the Dutch military attach\u00e9 with the Boers, who was picked\nup wounded and paralyzed after some engagement. A shrapnel bullet\nhad broken one of his cervical vertebr\u00e6, the bone pressed on the nerves,\n10 and they had ceased to function. Watson Cheyne of London was the op-\nerator. He had cut down on the bone with a free incision and was en-\ndeavouring with a strong forceps to raise the broken arch of bone, when\nan amazing thing happened. Out of the great crimson cleft there rose a\ncolumn of clear water two feet high, feathering at the top like a little palm\n15 tree, which gradually dwindled until it was only a few inches long, and\nfinally disappeared. I had, I confess, no idea what it was, and I think many\nof the assembled surgeons were as taken aback as I was. The mystery was\nexplained by Charles Gibbs, my mentor in such matters, who said that\nthe cerebrospinal fluid, which is usually a mere moistening round the\n20 cord, had been greatly stimulated and increased by the pressure of the\nbroken bone. It had finally distended the whole sheath. The forceps had\npunctured a small hole in the sheath and then the fluid had been pressed\nthrough and shot into the air as I had seen it. Perhaps the release was too\nsudden, for the patient died shortly after he was removed from the table.\n25 Charles Gibbs is still in practice, and senior surgeon of Charing Cross\nHospital, but he will forgive me if I remind him that his pupil did once\nscore over him. One of my enteric patients was obviously dying and kept\nmurmuring that he would like some solid food.\nOf course the first law in treating enteric is, or was, that diet must be\n30 fluid, as the intestine is ulcerated and puncture of it means death by peri-\ntonitis. I said to Gibbs: \u2018Do you consider that this man is sure to die?\u2019 \u2018He\nis certainly as bad as he can be,\u2019 said Gibbs. \u2018Well then,\u2019 said I, \u2018I propose\nto give him a solid meal.\u2019 Gibbs shook his head and was shocked. \u2018It is a\ngreat responsibility you take.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the odds,\u2019 I asked, \u2018if he has to die\n35 anyhow?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s just the difference whether you kill him or the disease\ndoes.\u2019 \u2018Well, I\u2019ll take the chance,\u2019 said I\u2014and I did so. A year or so later I\nwas attending a public meeting at Edinburgh when the following letter,\nwhich I copy from my book of curiosities, was handed up to me.\n158 chapter 18\n128, royal road,\nkennington park,\nlondon, s.e.\nOctober 1, 1900.\n5\nSIR; \u2013\nAs one who was under your care at Bloemfontein in \u2018Langman\u2019s\nHospital\u2019 I hope you will forgive me in taking the liberty of wishing\nyou success at Edinburgh. I am actuated in this not only by political 10\nprinciples but by the fact that I (and others) owe my life to your\nkindness and care. You may not remember me, Sir, but I can assure\nyou the remembrance of you is written in my mind and can never\nbe removed. Again wishing you success and hoping you will pardon\nthis liberty, 15\nI remain, Sir,\nYours obediently,\n(Pte.) M. Hanlon, C.I.V.\n20\nM. Hanlon was my enteric patient and he had never looked back\nfrom the day he had that square meal. But I don\u2019t say it was an example\nfor the family practitioner to copy.\nOn July 11 I went on board the Briton at Capetown and we sailed\nfor England once more. I called upon Sir Alfred Milner before I left, and 25\nfound him a very much older man than when only a few years before I\nhad met him on the eve of his African experience. His hair was grizzled\nand his shoulders bowed, but his brave heart was as steadfast as ever, nor\ndid it ever fail until his hard and thankless task was done. He made one\nerror, I think, when he desired to keep South Africa under martial law 30\nwhen the war was over, but who could have done better, or as well, under\nthe intolerable conditions which he had to face?\nIt was a remarkable passenger list on the Briton, and a very joyous\nvoyage. The Duke of Norfolk and his brother Lord Edward Talbot were\ntwo of the most cheery people on the ship. It was a weird sight to see the 35\nsenior Baron of England and a lumpy Hollander sitting face to face on a\nspar, and slashing each other with bladders to see which could knock off\nthe other. Blood told, if I remember right. Then there was Sir John Wil-\n159 final experiences in south africa\nloughby, of Jameson Raid fame, Lady Sarah Wilson from Mafeking, the\nDuke of Marlborough, Lady Arthur Grosvenor, the Hon. Ivor Guest and\nmany famous soldiers. Especially was I fortunate in my friendship with\nFletcher Robinson and with Nevinson, which was cemented by this clos-\n5 er association. Only one cloud marred the serenity of that golden voyage.\nThere was a foreign officer on board, whose name I will not mention,\nwho had been with the Boers and who talked with great indiscretion as\nto his experiences and opinions. He stated in my presence that the Brit-\nish had habitually used Dum-Dum bullets, on which I lost my temper\n10 and told him he was a liar. I must say that he behaved very well, for after\nthinking it over he saw that he was in the wrong and he sent down my\nfriend Robinson to my cabin with a query as to whether I would accept\nan apology. I answered that I would not, since it was the army, and not\nme, which had been insulted. In an hour Robinson reappeared with the\n15 following letter, which ended what might have been a serious incident.\ndear sir, \u2013\nAllow me to tell you that I regret lively what I said about expanding\n20 bullets \u2013 which I said but after hear saying evidence I request you to\nlet everybody know that I strongly wish on the contrary that I desire\nto be on best terms with every Englishman and beg you for that to\nbe my interpreter.\n25 Yours very truly.\nThe first days of August saw me in London once more, and soon\nall that strange episode \u2013 the green expanse of the veldt, the flat-\ntopped hills, the enteric wards \u2013 had become the vision of a dream.\n160 Chapter 19\nAN APPEAL TO THE WORLD\u2019S OPINION\nMisrepresentation \u2013 Sudden Resolve \u2013 Reginald Smith \u2013 A Week\u2019s Hard 5\nWork \u2013 \u2018The Cause and Conduct of the War\u2019 \u2013 Translations \u2013 German Letter\n\u2013 Complete Success \u2013 Surplus.\nOne of the most pleasing and complete episodes in my life was con-\nnected with the pamphlet which I wrote upon the methods and objects 10\nof our soldiers in South Africa. It was an attempt to stem the extraordi-\nnary outbreak of defamation which had broken out in every country \u2013 or\nnearly every country \u2013 in Europe, and which had attained such a height\nthat it really seemed that on this absolutely fictitious basis might be built\nup a powerful political combination which would involve us in a serious 15\nwar.\nI can well remember the inception of my enterprise! The date was\nJanuary 7, 1902. The day was a Tuesday. Sir Henry Thompson was hold-\ning that evening one of those charming \u2018octave\u2019 dinners at which it was\nmy occasional privilege to attend, and I was going up to town from Hind- 20\nhead to keep the engagement. Sitting alone in a carriage I read the foreign\ncorrespondence of The Times. In a single column there were accounts\nof meetings in all parts of Europe \u2013 notably one of some hundreds of\nRhineland clergymen \u2013 protesting against our brutalities to our enemies.\nThere followed a whole column of extracts from foreign papers, with gro- 25\ntesque descriptions of our barbarities. To anyone who knew the easy-go-\ning British soldier or the character of his leaders the thing was unspeak-\nably absurd; and yet, as I laid down the paper and thought the matter\nover, I could not but admit that these Continental people were acting\nunder a generous and unselfish motive which was much to their credit. 30\nHow could they help believing those things, and, believing them, was it\nnot their duty by meeting, by article, by any means, to denounce them?\nCould we accuse them of being credulous? Would we not be equally so if\nall our accounts of any transaction came from one side, and were support-\ned by such journalists and, above all, such artists as lent their pens and 35\npencils, whether venally or not, to the Boer cause? Of course we would.\nAnd whose fault was it that our side of the question was not equally laid\nbefore the jury of the civilized world? Perhaps we were too proud, per-\n161 an appeal to the world\u2019s opinion\nhaps we were too negligent \u2013 but the fact was obvious that judgment was\nbeing given against us by default. How could they know our case? Where\ncould they find it? If I were asked what document they could consult,\nwhat could I answer? Blue-books and State papers are not for the multi-\n5 tude. There were books like Fitz-Patrick\u2019s Transvaal from Within or E. T.\nCook\u2019s Rights and Wrongs; but these were expensive volumes, and not\nreadily translated. Nowhere could be found a statement which covered\nthe whole ground in a simple fashion. Why didn\u2019t some Briton draw it\nup? And then like a bullet through my head, came the thought, \u2018Why\n10 don\u2019t you draw it up yourself?\u2019\nThe next instant I was on fire with the idea. Seldom in my life have\nI been so conscious of a direct imperative call which drove every other\nthought from the mind. If I were a humble advocate, it was all the better,\nsince I could have no axe to grind. I was fairly well posted in the facts al-\n15 ready, as I had written an interim history of the war. I had seen something\nof the campaign, and possessed many documents which bore upon the\nmatter. My plans widened every instant. I would raise money from the\npublic and by the sale of the book at home. With this I would translate it\ninto every language.\n20 These translations should be given away wholesale. Every professor,\nevery clergyman, every journalist, every politician, should have one put\nunder his nose in his own language. In future, if they traduced us, they\ncould no longer plead ignorance that there was another side to the ques-\ntion. Before I reached London all my programme was sketched out in\n25 my head. There was no item of it, I may add, which was not eventually\ncarried through.\nFortune was my friend. I have said that I was dining that night with\nSir Henry Thompson. My neighbour at dinner was a gentleman whose\nname I had not caught. My mind being full of the one idea, my talk soon\n30 came round to it, and instead of my neighbour being bored, my remarks\nwere received with a courteous and sympathetic attention which caused\nme to make even greater demands upon his patience. Having listened\nfrom the soup to the savoury (often has my conscience rebuked me\nsince), he ended by asking me mildly how I proposed to raise the money\n35 for these wide-reaching schemes. I answered that I would appeal to the\npublic. He asked me how much would suffice. I answered that I could\nmake a start with \u00a31,000. He remarked that it would take much more\nthan that. \u2018However,\u2019 he added, \u2018if \u00a31,000 would go any way towards it, I\n162 chapter 19\nhave no doubt that sum could be got for you.\u2019 \u2018From whom?\u2019 I asked. He\ngave me his name and address and said: \u2018I have no doubt that if you carry\nout the scheme on the lines you suggest, I could get the money. When\nyou have done your work, come to me, and we will see how it is best to\nproceed.\u2019 I promised to do so, and thanked him for his encouragement. 5\nSir Eric Barrington of the Foreign Office was the name of this fairy god-\nfather.\nThis was my first stroke of good luck. A second came next morning.\nI had occasion to call upon the publishing house of Smith, Elder & Co.,\nover some other business, and during the interview I told Mr. Reginald 10\nSmith the plan that I had formed. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation he\nplaced the whole machinery of his worldwide business at my disposal,\nwithout payment of any kind. From that moment he became my partner\nin the enterprise, and I found his counsel at every stage of as great help\nto me as the publishing services which he so generously rendered. Not 15\nonly did he save heavy costs to the fund, but he arranged easily and suc-\ncessfully those complex foreign transactions which the scheme entailed.\nThat morning I called at the War Office and was referred by them\nto the Intelligence Department, where every information which they\npossessed was freely put at my disposal. I then wrote to The Times ex- 20\nplaining what I was trying to do, and asking those who sympathized with\nmy object to lend me their aid. Never was an appeal more generously\nor rapidly answered. My morning post on the day after brought me 127\nletters, nearly all of which contained sums drawn from every class of the\ncommunity, varying from the \u00a350 of Lord Rosebery to the half-crown of 25\nthe widow of a private soldier. Most of the remittances were accompa-\nnied by letters which showed that, however they might pretend in public\nto disregard it, the attitude of the foreign critics had really left a deep and\nbitter feeling in the hearts of our people.\nIt was on January 9 that I was able to begin my task. On the 17th I had 30\nfinished it. When the amount of matter is considered, and the number of\nresearches and verifications which it entailed, I need not say that I had\nbeen absorbed in the work, and devoted, I dare say, sixteen hours a day\nto its accomplishment. So far as possible I kept my individual opinions in\nthe background, and made a more effective case by marshalling the state- 35\nments of eye-witnesses, many of them Boers, on the various questions\nof farm-burnings, outrages, concentration camps, and other contentious\nsubjects. I made the comments as simple and as short as I could, while as\n163 an appeal to the world\u2019s opinion\nto the accuracy of my facts, I may say that, save as to the exact number of\nfarmhouses burned, I have never heard of one which has been seriously\nquestioned. It was a glad day for me when I was able to lay down my pen\nwith the feeling that my statement was as full and as effective as it was in\n5 me to make it.\nMeanwhile the subscriptions had still come steadily in, until nearly\n\u00a31,000 more had been banked by the time that the booklet was finished.\nThe greater number of contributions were in small sums from people\nwho could ill afford it. One notable feature was the number of govern-\n10 esses and others residing abroad whose lives had been embittered by\ntheir inability to answer the slanders which were daily uttered in their\npresence. Many of these sent their small donations. A second pleasing\nfeature was the number of foreigners resident in England who supported\nmy scheme, in the hope that it would aid their own people to form a just-\n15 er view. From Norwegians alone I received nearly \u00a350 with this object.\nIf Britain\u2019s own children too often betrayed her at a crisis of her fate, she\nfound at least warm friends among the strangers within her gates. Anoth-\ner point worth noting was that a disproportionate sum was from clergy-\nmen, which was explained by several of them as due to the fact that since\n20 the war began they had been pestered by antinational literature, and took\nthis means of protesting against it.\nThe proofs having been printed, I sent them to my Foreign Office\nfriend as I had promised, and presently received an invitation to see him.\nHe expressed his approval of the work, and handed me a banknote for\n25 \u00a3500, at the same time explaining that the money did not come from\nhim. I asked if I might acknowledge it as from an anonymous donor \u2013\n\u2018The donor would not object,\u2019 said my friend. So I was able to head my\nlist with \u2018A Loyal Briton,\u2019 who contributed \u00a3500. I daresay the Secret Ser-\nvice knew best whence the money came.\n30 By this time the banking account had risen to some two thousand\npounds, and we were in a position to put our foreign translations in hand.\nThe British edition had in the meantime been published, the distribution\nbeing placed in the hands of Messrs. Newnes, who gave the enterprise\nwhole-hearted aid. The book was retailed at sixpence, but as it was our\n35 desire that the sale should be pushed it was sold to the trade at about\nthreepence. The result was to leave the main profit of the enterprise in\nthe hands of the retailer. The sale of the pamphlet was very large \u2013 in fact,\nI should imagine that it approached a record in the time. Some 250,000\n164 chapter 19\ncopies were sold in Great Britain very quickly, and about 300,000 within\na couple of months. This great sale enabled us to add considerably to the\nfund by the accumulation of the small rebate which had been reserved\nupon each copy. Our financial position was very strong, therefore, in\ndealing with the foreign translations. 5\nThe French edition was prepared by Professor Sumichrast of Har-\nvard University, who was a French-Canadian by birth. This gentleman\npatriotically refused to take any payment for his work, which was admi-\nrably done. It was published without difficulty by Galignani, and several\nthousands were given away where they would do most good, in France, 10\nBelgium, and Switzerland. Twenty thousand copies of this edition were\nprinted.\nThe German edition was a more difficult matter. No German pub-\nlisher would undertake it, and the only courtesy which we met with in\nthat country was from Baron von Tauchnitz, who included the volume 15\nin his well-known English library. Our advances were met with coldness,\nand occasionally with insult. Here, for example, is a copy of an extreme\nspecimen of the kind of letter received.\nJanuary, 1902. 20\nmessrs. smith, elder & co., \u2013\ngent, \u2013 Doyle\u2019s book makes the impression as if it was ordered or\ninfluenced by the English Jingo party. 25\nNow, you know, this English war party (as well as the English\nofficers and soldiers in Transvaal) are contempted by the whole\ncivilised world as coward scoundrels and vile brutes who murder\nwomen and children. 30\nIt would be for me, as an importer of English literature to Germany,\nAustria and Russia, in the highest degree imprudent to do anything\nthat could awake the suspicion I was in connection with so despised\na party. 35\nI have shown your letter to several persons. Nobody was inclined to\ntake up the matter.\n165 an appeal to the world\u2019s opinion\nThere is a mixture of venom and smugness about this epistle which\ngives it a high place in my collection. In spite of rebuffs, however, I found\nan Anglo-German publishing house in Berlin to undertake the work, and\nwith the assistance of Herr Curt von Musgrave, who gave me an excel-\n5 lent translation, I was able to work off more than one very large edition,\nwhich had a perceptible effect in modifying the tone of that portion of\nthe German press which was open to reason. Altogether 20,000 copies\nwere distributed in the Fatherland and German-speaking Austria.\nI remember one whimsical incident at this time. Somewhat tired, af-\n10 ter the book was in the press, I went down to Seaford for a rest. While\nthere, a message reached me that a Pan-German officer of Landwehr had\ncome over to London, and desired to see me. I wired that I could not\ncome up, but that I should be happy to see him if he came down. Down\nhe came accordingly, a fine, upstanding, soldierly man, speaking excel-\n15 lent English. The German proofs had passed through his hands, and he\nwas much distressed by the way in which I had spoken of the hostility\nwhich his countrymen had shown us, and its effect upon our feelings to-\nwards them. We sat all day and argued the question out. His great point,\nas a Pan-German, was that some day both Germany and Britain would\n20 have to fight Russia \u2013 Britain for India, and Germany perhaps for the Bal-\ntic Provinces. Therefore they should keep in close touch with each other.\nI assured him that at the time the feeling in this country was much more\nbitter against Germany than against Russia. He doubted it. I suggested as\na test that he should try the question upon any \u2019bus driver in London as a\n25 fair index of popular opinion. He was very anxious that I should modify\ncertain paragraphs, and I was equally determined not to do so, as I was\nconvinced they were true. Finally, when he left me on his return to Lon-\ndon he said, \u2018Well, I have come 800 miles to see you, and I ask you now\nas a final request that in the translation you will allow the one word \u201cLei-\n30 der\u201d (\u201cAlas\u201d) to be put at the opening of that paragraph.\u2019 I was perfectly\nready to agree to this. So he got one word in exchange for 1,600 miles of\ntravel, and I think it was a very sporting venture.\nOne charming incident connected with this German translation was\nthat a small group of Swiss (and in no country had we such warm-heart-\n35 ed friends as among the minority in Switzerland) were so keen upon the\ncause that they had a translation and an edition of their own, with large\nprint and maps. It was published independently at Zurich, Dr. Angst,\nthe British Consul in that town, helping to organize it. Amongst other\n166 chapter 19\ngood friends who worked hard for the truth, and exposed themselves to\nmuch obloquy in doing so, were Professor Naville, the eminent Egyp-\ntologist of Geneva, and Monsieur Talichet, the well-known editor of the\nBiblioth\u00e8que Universelle of Lausanne, who sacrificed the circulation of his\nold-established magazine in upholding our cause. 5\nSo much for the French and German editions. The American and\nCanadian had arranged themselves. There remained the Spanish, Portu-\nguese, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian, all of which were rapidly prepared\nand circulated without a hitch, save that in the case of the Russian, which\nwas published at Odessa, the Censor suppressed it at the last instant. We 10\nwere successful, however, in getting his veto removed. In each of these\ncountries several thousands of the booklet were given away. In every case\nwe found a larger sale for these foreign editions than we expected, arising\nno doubt from the eagerness of English residents abroad to make their\nneighbours understand our position. 15\nThe Dutch edition was a stumbling-block. This gallant little nation\nfelt a most natural sympathy for their kinsfolk in arms against us, and\nhonestly believed that they had been very badly used. We should cer-\ntainly have felt the same. The result was that we were entirely unable to\nfind either publisher or distributor. The greater the opposition the more 20\nobvious was the need for the book, so Mr. Reginald Smith arranged that\na large edition should be printed here, and sent direct to all leaders of\nDutch opinion. I believe that out of some 5,000 copies not more than\ntwenty were sent back to us.\nThe Norwegian edition also presented some difficulties which were 25\novercome by the assistance of Mr. Thomassen of the Verdensgang. This\ngentleman\u2019s paper was entirely opposed to us, but in the interests of fair-\nplay he helped me to get my book before the public. I hope that some\nrelaxation in his attitude towards us in his paper may have been due to\na fuller comprehension of our case, and a realization of the fact that a 30\nnation does not make great sacrifices extending over years for an ignoble\ncause. One other incident in connection with the Norwegian edition is\npleasant for me to recall. I had prefaced each Continental edition with a\nspecial foreword, designed to arrest the attention of the particular people\nwhom I was addressing. In this case, when the book was going to press 35\nin Christiania, the preface had not arrived from the translator (the ac-\ncomplished Madame Brockmann), and as she lived a hundred miles off,\nwith all the passes blocked by a phenomenal snow-storm, it looked as if it\n167 an appeal to the world\u2019s opinion\nmust be omitted. Finally, however, my short address to the Scandinavian\npeople was heliographed across from snow-peak to snow-peak, and so\nfound its way to the book.\nThere was one other language into which the book needed to be\n5 translated, and that was the Welsh, for the vernacular press of the Princi-\npality was almost entirely pro-Boer, and the Welsh people had the most\ndistorted information as to the cause for which their fellow-countrymen\nfought so bravely in the field. The translation was done by Mr. W. Ev-\nans, and some 10,000 copies were printed for distribution through the\n10 agency of the Cardiff Western Mail. This finished our labours. Our total\noutput was 300,000 of the British edition, about 50,000 in Canada and\nthe United States, 20,000 in Germany, 20,000 in France, 5,000 in Hol-\nland, 10,000 in Wales, 8,000 in Hungary, 5,000 in Norway and Sweden,\n3,500 in Portugal, 10,000 in Spain, 5,000 in Italy, and 5,000 in Russia.\n15 There were editions in Tamil and Kanarese, the numbers of which I do\nnot know. In all, I have seen twenty different presentments of my little\nbook. The total sum at our disposal amounted to about \u00a35,000, of which,\nspeaking roughly, half came from subscriptions and the other half was\nearned by the book itself.\n20 It was not long before we had the most gratifying evidence of the\nsuccess of these efforts. There was a rapid and marked change in the tone\nof the whole Continental press, which may have been a coincidence, but\nwas certainly a pleasing one. In the case of many important organs of\npublic opinion there could, however, be no question of coincidence, as\n25 the arguments advanced in the booklet and the facts quoted were cit-\ned in their leading articles as having modified their former anti-British\nviews. This was the case with the Tagblatt of Vienna, whose London rep-\nresentative, Dr. Maurice Ernst, helped me in every way to approach the\nAustrian public. So it was also with the National Zeitung in Berlin, the\n30 Ind\u00e9pendance Belge in Brussels, and many others. In the greater number\nof cases, however, it was unreasonable to suppose that a journal would\npublicly eat its own words, and the best result for which we could hope\nwas that which we often attained, an altered and less acrimonious tone.\nMr. Reginald Smith and I now found ourselves in the very pleasant\n35 position of having accomplished our work so far as we could do it, and\nyet of having in hand a considerable sum of money. What were we to do\nwith it? To return it to subscribers was impossible, and indeed at least\nhalf of it would have to be returned to ourselves since it had been earned\n168 chapter 19\nby the sale of the book. I felt that the subscribers had given me a free\nhand with the money, to use it to the best of my judgment for national\naims.\nOur first expense was in immediate connection with the object in\nview, for we endeavoured to supplement the effect of the booklet by cir- 5\nculating a large number of an excellent Austrian work, Recht und Unrecht\nim Burenkrieg, by Dr. Ferdinand Hirz. Six hundred of these were distrib-\nuted where they might do most good.\nOur next move was to purchase half a dozen very handsome gold\ncigarette-cases. On the back of each was engraved, \u2018From Friends in Eng- 10\nland to a Friend of England.\u2019 These were distributed to a few of those\nwho had stood most staunchly by us. One went to the eminent French\npublicist, Monsieur Yves Guyot, a second to Monsieur Talichet of Lau-\nsanne, a third to Mr. Sumichrast, and a fourth to Professor Naville. By a\nhappy coincidence the latter gentleman happened to be in this country 15\nat the time, and I had the pleasure of slipping the small souvenir into his\nhand as he put on his overcoat in the hall of the Athen\u00e6um Club. I have\nseldom seen anyone look more surprised.\nThere remained a considerable sum, and Mr. Reginald Smith shared\nmy opinion that we should find some permanent use for it, and that this 20\nuse should bring benefit to natives of South Africa. We therefore for-\nwarded \u00a31,000 to Edinburgh University, to be so invested as to give a re-\nturn of \u00a340 a year, which should be devoted to the South African student\nwho acquitted himself with most distinction. There are many Afrikander\nstudents at Edinburgh, and we imagined that we had hit upon a pleasing 25\ncommon interest for Boer and for Briton; but I confess that I was rather\namazed when at the end of the first year I received a letter from a student\nexpressing his confidence that he would win the bursary, and adding that\nthere could be no question as to his eligibility, as he was a full-blooded\nZulu. 30\nThe fund, however, was by no means exhausted, and we were able to\nmake contributions to the Civilian Rifleman\u2019s movement, to the Union\nJack Club, to the Indian famine, to the Japanese nursing, to the Irish old\nsoldiers\u2019 institute, to the fund for distressed Boers, and to many other\ndeserving objects. These donations varied from fifty guineas to ten. Fi- 35\nnally we were left with a residuum which amounted to \u00a3309 0s. 4d. Mr.\nReginald Smith and I sat in solemn conclave over this sum, and discussed\nhow it might best be used for the needs of the Empire. The fourpence\n169 an appeal to the world\u2019s opinion\npresented no difficulty, for we worked it off upon the crossing sweeper\noutside, who had helped to relieve Delhi. Nine pounds went in tobacco\nfor the Chelsea veterans at Christmas. There remained the good round\nsum of \u00a3300. We bethought us of the saying that the safety of the Empire\n5 might depend upon a single shot from a twelve-inch gun, and we devot-\ned the whole amount to a magnificent cup, to be shot for by the various\nships of the Channel Squadron, the winner to hold it for a single year.\nThe stand of the cup was from the oak timbers of the Victory, and the\ntrophy itself was a splendid one in solid silver gilt. By the kind and ju-\n10 dicious co-operation of Admiral Sir Percy Scott, the Inspector of Target\nPractice, through whose hands the trophy passed to the Senior Admiral\nafloat, Sir Arthur Wilson, V.C., in command of the Channel Squadron,\nall difficulties were overcome and the cup was shot for that year, and has\nsince produced, I am told, great emulation among the various crews. Our\n15 one condition was that it should not be retained in the mess-room, but\nshould be put out on the deck where the winning bluejackets could con-\ntinually see it. I learn that the Exmouth came into Plymouth Harbour\nwith the cup on the top of her fore turret.\nThe one abiding impression left upon my mind by the whole episode\n20 is that our Government does not use publicity enough in stating and de-\nfending its own case. If a private individual could by spending \u00a33,000 and\nputting in a month\u2019s work make a marked impression upon the public\nopinion of the world, what could be done by a really rich and intelligent\norganization? But the first requisite is that you should honestly have a\n25 just cause to state. Who is there outside England who really knows the\nrepeated and honest efforts made by us to settle the eternal Irish question\nand hold the scales fair between rival Irishmen? We certainly do, as a\ngreat Frenchman said, \u2018defend ourselves very badly.\u2019 If we let cases go by\ndefault how can we imagine that the verdict can be in our favour?\n170 Chapter 20\nMY POLITICAL ADVENTURES\nCentral Edinburgh \u2013 A Knock-out \u2013 The Border Burghs \u2013 Tariff Reform \u2013 5\nHeckling \u2013 Interpolations \u2013 Defeat \u2013 Reflections.\nI have twice stood for Parliament, though if anyone were to ask me my\nreal reasons for doing so I should find it difficult to give them an intelligi-\nble answer. It certainly was from no burning desire to join that august as- 10\nsembly, for in each case I deliberately contested seats which every expert\nconsidered to be impossible, and though on one occasion I very nearly\nproved the experts to be wrong, my action is none the less a sign that I\nhad no great wish to be at the head of the poll, for other and easier seats\nhad been offered me. In the case of Central Edinburgh, for which I stood 15\nin the 1900 election, there may have been some sentimental call, for it\nwas the section of the city where I was educated and where much of my\nboyhood was spent. It was said to be the premier Radical stronghold of\nScotland, and to carry it would be a fine exploit, for though I was a good\ndeal of a Radical myself in many ways, I knew that it would be a national 20\ndisgrace and possibly an imperial disaster if we did not carry the Boer\nWar to complete success, and that was the real issue before the electors.\nI believe that Providence one way or another gets a man\u2019s full powers\nout of him, but that it is essential that the man himself should co-operate\nto the extent of putting himself in the way of achievement. Give your- 25\nself the chance always. If it is so fated, you will win through. If your path\nlies elsewhere, then you have got your sign through your failure. But do\nnot put yourself in the position later in life of looking back and saying,\n\u2018Perhaps I might have had a career there had I tried.\u2019 Deep in my bones\nI felt that I was on earth for some big purpose, and it was only by trying 30\nthat I could tell that the purpose was not political, though I could never\nimagine myself as fettered to a party or as thinking that all virtues lay with\none set of men.\nMy political work was not wasted. I stood in the two most heckling\nconstituencies in Scotland, and through that odious and much-abused 35\ncustom I gained a coolness on the platform and a disregard for interrup-\ntion and clamour, which have stood me in good stead since. Indeed, I\nhold that it was to fashion me more perfectly for my ultimate work that I\n171 my political adventures\nwas twice passed through this furnace. I remember that once at Hawick\nmy soldier brother came to see how I was getting on, and was struck by\nthe effect which I had upon my audience. \u2018It would be strange, Arthur,\u2019\nsaid he, \u2018if your real career should prove to be political and not literary.\u2019 \u2018It\n5 will be neither. It will be religious,\u2019 said I. Then we looked at each other\nin surprise and both burst out laughing. The answer seemed quite absurd\nand pointless, for no remote possibility of such a thing suggested itself.\nIt was a curious example of that unconscious power of prophecy which\nis latent within us.\n10 I had hardly landed from South Africa when I flung myself into the\nEdinburgh contest. Mr. Cranston, later Sir Robert Cranston, a well-\nknown citizen, was my chairman. When I arrived a small meeting was\nheld, and I, a weary man, listened while it was gravely debated, with\nmuch weighing of pros and cons, what my view was to be on each of the\n15 vital questions. Finally it was all settled to their satisfaction and written\ndown, preparatory to forming the election address. I had listened with\nsome amusement, and when it was all over I said: \u2018Gentlemen, may I ask\nwho is going to honour these promises that you are making?\u2019 \u2018Why, you,\nof course,\u2019 said they. \u2018Then I think it would be better if I made them,\u2019 said\n20 I, and, crumpling up their document, I picked up a pen and wrote out my\nown views and my own address. It was well received and would have won\nthe election against enormous odds \u2013 some thousands of votes at the last\ntrial \u2013 were it not for a very unexpected intervention.\nThose who remember the election will bear me out that it was an ex-\n25 citing affair. My opponent was a Mr. Brown, a member of Nelson\u2019s pub-\nlishing firm, which had large works in the constituency. I was fresh from\nthe scene of war and overflowing with zeal to help the army, so I spared\nmyself in no way. I spoke from barrels in the street or any other pedestal\nI could find, holding many wayside meetings besides my big meetings\n30 in the evening, which were always crowded and uproarious. There was\nnothing which I could have done and did not do. My opponent was not\nformidable, but I had against me an overwhelming party machine with\nits registered lists, and record of unbroken victory. It was no light matter\nto change the vote of a Scotsman, and many of them would as soon think\n35 of changing their religion. One serious mischance occurred. I was deter-\nmined to do and say nothing which I did not heartily mean, and this unit-\ned Ireland, North and South, for the first time in history. The Irish vote\nwas considerable, so that this was important. The South quarrelled with\n172 chapter 20\nme because, though I favoured some devolution, I was not yet converted\nto Home Rule. The North was angry because I was in favour of a Catho-\nlic University for Dublin. So I had no votes from Ireland. When I went\ndown to hold a meeting in a hall in the Cowgate, which is the Irish quar-\nter, I was told that it had been arranged to break my platform up. This 5\nseems to have been true, but fortunately I got on good human terms with\nmy audience, and indeed moved some of them to tears, by telling them\nof the meeting between the two battalions of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers\nat Ladysmith. So it happened that when a sinister-looking figure, a local\nhorse-slaughterer, appeared on the edge of the stage, he was received in 10\nsilence. He moved slowly across and said something about free speech. I\nfelt that if I or my people were violent there would be a riot, so I simply\nsaid: \u2018Trot along, sonny, trot along!\u2019 He did trot along and disappeared\non the other side of the stage. After the transit of this sinister star, and my\ntemporary eclipse, all went well to the end. 15\nAs the day of the election approached, it became more and more ev-\nident that I was getting dangerous, but I was knocked out \u2013 fortunately\nfor myself, as I now discern \u2013 by a curious interference. There was an\nEvangelical fanatic named Plimmer living at Dunfermline who thought\nit his special mission in life to keep Roman Catholic candidates out of 20\nParliament. Therefore at the eleventh hour, the very night before the vot-\ning, the whole district was placarded with big sheets to say that I was a\nRoman Catholic, that I had been educated by Jesuits, and in fact that my\nwhole candidature was an attack upon Kirk and Covenant and Lesser\nCatechism and everything dear to the Scottish heart. It was very cleverly 25\ndone, and of course this fanatic alone could not have paid the expenses,\nthough I cannot believe that Mr. Brown knew anything of the matter.\nMy unhappy supporters saw crowds of workmen reading these absurd\nplacards and calling out, \u2018I\u2019ve done with him!\u2019 As it was I very narrowly\nmissed the seat, being only beaten by a few hundred votes. The question 30\nof an appeal came along, but the thing was so clever that it really was\ndifficult to handle, since it was true enough that I had been educated by\nJesuits and yet absurdly untrue that this education influenced my present\nframe of mind. Therefore we had to leave it alone.\nLooking back, I am inclined to look upon Mr. Plimmer as one of the 35\ngreat benefactors of my life. He altered the points at the last moment and\nprevented me from being shunted on to a side-line which would perhaps\nhave taken me to a dead end. I could never have been a party man, and\n173 my political adventures\nthere seems no place under our system for anyone else. At the moment\nI was a little sore, and I wrote a letter to the Scotsman which defined my\nreligious position as it was then, and caused, I believe, no little comment.\nI had the following letter from Sir John Boraston, who was the party or-\n5 ganizer. The first sentence refers to the possibility of lodging a legal pro-\ntest.\n6 great george street,\nwestminster,\n10 london, s.w.\nOctober 18, 1900.\ndear dr. doyle, \u2013\n15 Probably your Edinburgh advisers are right, but it is undoubtedly a\nmisfortune that the perpetrators of attacks such as that which was\nmade upon you should be allowed to go unpunished.\nYour fight was indeed a phenomenal one, and you have the conso-\n20 lation of knowing that if you did not actually win a seat for yourself,\nyou did materially contribute to the Liberal Unionist victories in\ntwo other Edinburgh constituencies \u2013 this is generally admitted.\nI am sure you will feel that your first entry into active political life\n25 promises a full measure of success at no distant date, and I hope I\nmay see you again before long to talk matters over.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) john boraston.\n30\nI had no further urge to try political adventures, but when the Tar-\niff Reform election of 1905 came round I felt that I should make some\nsacrifice for the faith that was in me. Mr. \u2018Tommy\u2019 Shaw, as he was called\n\u2013 afterwards Lord Shaw \u2013 was one of the most energetic Radicals in Scot-\n35 land, and was reputed to be most firmly established in his seat, which was\ncalled \u2018The Border Burghs,\u2019 consisting of the small towns of Hawick, Ga-\nlashiels and Selkirk, all of them engaged in the woollen trade, and all of\nthem hard hit by German competition. It seemed to me that if there was a\n174 chapter 20\ngood field anywhere for Mr. Joseph Chamberlain\u2019s views on a protective\ntariff it should be there, where an open market had caused such distress\nand loss. My reasoning was sound enough, but I had not reckoned upon\nthe innate conservatism of the Scottish character, which cannot readjust\nits general principles to meet the particular case \u2013 a noble trait, but occa- 5\nsionally an unpractical one. Party politics are not a divine law, but simply\na means to an end, which must adjust itself as the end varies.\nThis time I really expended a good deal of work as well as money\nupon the attempt, for if you stand for others besides yourself you have\nno choice but to work up to the last pound of steam. I might have add- 10\ned my neck to the other things which I risked, for in an endeavour to\nget into comradeship with the people I joined in what is known as the\n\u2018common-riding\u2019 at Hawick, where a general holiday is proclaimed while\nthe bounds of the common are ridden over and defined. Part of the pro-\nceedings was that each mounted man had to gallop full-split down the 15\nhigh-road over a measured course of half a mile or so, the burghers lining\nthe way and helping one by waving sticks and umbrellas. I was mounted\non a hunter which I had never seen before, and which was full of spirit.\nFortunately this monstrous road performance came off late in the after-\nnoon, and I had taken some of the spirit out of him by our ride round the 20\ncommon. I do not profess to be a great horseman, and I certainly nearly\nmade the acquaintance of the Hawick turnpike. Sooner or later someone\nwill be killed at that game, and horses must be lamed every year. After-\nwards an interminable ballad was recited with a sort of jingling chorus to\nwhich all who are near the reciter keep time with their feet. As it would 25\nseem unsympathetic not to join in, I also kept time with the rhythm, and\nwas amused and amazed when I got back to London to see in the papers\nthat I had danced a hornpipe in public before the electors. Altogether I\nhad no desire to face another Hawick common-riding.\nThe trouble in dealing with a three-town constituency, each town 30\nvery jealous of the others, is that whatever you do has to be done thrice\nor you give offence. I was therefore heartily sick of the preparation and\nonly too pleased when the actual election came off. I thought then, and\nI think now, that a sliding tariff, if only as an instrument for bargaining,\nwould be altogether to our interest in this country, and would possibly 35\ncause some of our rivals to cease closing their markets to us, while they\nfreely use the open market which we present. I still think that Cham-\nberlain\u2019s whole scheme was an admirable one, and that it was defeated\n175 my political adventures\nby a campaign of misrepresentation and actual lying, in which Chinese\nlabour and dear food played a chief part. I stood among the ruins of a dis-\nmantled factory in the Border Burghs and I showed how it had been de-\nstroyed by German competition, and how while we let their goods in free\n5 they were levying taxes on ours and spending the money so gained upon\nwarships with which we might some day have to reckon. The answer to\nmy arguments consisted largely of coloured cartoons of Chinamen work-\ning in chains in the mines of the Transvaal, and other nonsense of the\nsort. I worked very hard; so hard that on the last night of the election I\n10 addressed meetings in each of the three towns, which, as they are separat-\ned by many miles of hilly roads, is a feat never done, I understand, before\nor since. However, it was of no avail and I was beaten, though I believe I\nam right in saying that the party showed a less decrease of votes than in\nany constituency in Scotland. The thing which annoyed me most about\n15 the election was that my opponent, Tommy Shaw, only appeared once,\nso far as I remember, in the constituency, and did everything by deputy,\nso that I found myself like a boxer who is punching his rival\u2019s second in-\nstead of himself all the time. I had the melancholy satisfaction of noting\nthat the Radical chairman who was so engrossed in the wrongs of China-\n20 men in the Transvaal went into liquidation within a few months, giving\nas his reason the pressure of foreign competition in the woollen trade.\nIt is a vile business this electioneering, though no doubt it is chas-\ntening in its effects. They say that mud-baths are healthy and purifying,\nand I can compare it to nothing else. This applies particularly, I think, to\n25 Scotland, where the art of heckling has been carried to extremes. This\nasking of questions was an excellent thing so long as it was honest in its\ndesire to know the candidate\u2019s opinion upon a public measure. But the\nhonest questions are the exception and the unfortunate man is baited by\nall sorts of senseless trick questions from mischievous and irresponsible\n30 persons, which are designed to annoy him and make him seem foolish\nor ignorant. Some reform is badly needed in this matter. Often, after a\nspeech of an hour, I had an hour of questions, one more absurd than\nanother. The press records will show, I hope, that I held my own, for I\nknew my subject well, and by this time I had had a good schooling on\n35 the platform. Sometimes I countered heavily. I remember one robust\nindividual coming down with a carefully prepared question which he\nshouted from the back of the hall. I had been speaking of retaliation in\ncommercial tariffs, and his question was: \u2018Mister Candidate, how do you\n176 chapter 20\nreconcile retaliation with the Sermon on the Mount?\u2019 I answered: \u2018We\ncannot in life always reach the highest ideals. Have you sold all and given\nto the poor?\u2019 The man was locally famous as having done nothing of the\nsort, and there was a howl of delight at my answer which fairly drove him\nout of the hall. 5\nThere is a peculiar dry Scottish wit which is very effective when you\nget it on your side. I remember one solemn person who had a loaf on\nthe end of a pole which he protruded towards me, as if it were a death\u2019s-\nhead, from the side box of the theatre in which I spoke. The implication\nwas, I suppose, that I would raise the price of bread. It was difficult to 10\nignore the thing and yet puzzling how to meet it, but one of my people in\nbroad Doric cried: \u2018Tak\u2019 it hame and eat it!\u2019 which quite spoilt the effect.\nUsually these interpolations are delivered in a dreamy impersonal sort\nof voice. When, in talking of the Transvaal War, I said with some pas-\nsion, \u2018Who is going to pay for this war?\u2019 a seedy-looking person standing 15\nagainst the side wall said, \u2018I\u2019m no\u2019 carin\u2019!\u2019 which made both me and the\naudience laugh. Again I remember my speech being quite interrupted by\na joke which was lost upon me. I had spoken of the self-respect and de-\ncent attire of American factory hands. \u2018Gang and look at Broon\u2019s,\u2019 said the\ndreamy voice. I have never yet learned whether Brown\u2019s factory was fa- 20\nmous for tidiness or the reverse, but the remark convulsed the audience.\nThe Radicals used to attend my meetings in great numbers, so that\nreally, I think, they were often hostile audiences which I addressed. Since\ntheir own candidate held hardly any meetings I was the only fun to be\nhad. Before the meeting the packed house would indulge in cries and 25\ncounter-cries with rival songs and slogans, so that as I approached the\nbuilding it sounded like feeding-time at the Zoo. My heart often sank\nwithin me as I listened to the uproar, and I would ask myself what on\nearth I meant by placing myself in such a position. Once on the platform,\nhowever, my fighting blood warmed up, and I did not quail before any 30\nclamour. It was all a great education for the future, though I did not real-\nize it at the time, but followed blindly where some strange inward instinct\nled me on. What tried me most was the personal liberties taken by vulgar\npeople, which is a very different thing from poor people, whom I usually\nfind to be very delicate in their feelings. I take a liberty with no man, and 35\nthere is something in me which rises up in anger if any man takes a liberty\nwith me. A candidate cannot say all he thinks on this matter, or his party\nmay suffer. I was always on my guard lest I should give offence in this\n177 my political adventures\nway, and I well remember how on one occasion I stood during a three\ndays\u2019 campaign a good many indignities with exemplary patience. I was\non edge, however, and, as luck would have it, at the very last moment, as I\nstood on the platform waiting for the London train, one of my own peo-\n5 ple, an exuberant young bounder, came up with a loud familiar greeting\nand squeezed my right hand until my signet ring nearly cut me. It opened\nthe sluice and out came a torrent of whaler language which I had hoped\nthat I had long ago forgotten. The blast seemed to blow him bodily across\nthe platform, and formed a strange farewell to my supporters.\n10 Thus ended my career in politics. I could say with my friend Ken-\ndrick Bangs: \u2018The electors have returned me \u2013 to the bosom of my family.\u2019\nA very pleasant constituency it is. I had now thoroughly explored that\npath, and had assured myself that my life\u2019s journey did not lie along it.\nAnd yet I was deeply convinced that public service was waiting for me\n15 somewhere. One likes to feel that one has some small practical influence\nupon the affairs of one\u2019s time, but I encourage myself by the thought\nthat though I have not been a public man, yet my utterances in several\npamphlets and numerous letters in the Press may have had more weight\nwith the public since I was disassociated from any political interest which\n20 could sway my judgment.\n178 Chapter 21\nTHE YEARS BETWEEN THE WARS\nHistory of the War \u2013 Sir Oliver Lodge \u2013 Military Arguments \u2013 Sir Nigel \u2013 The 5\nEdalji Case \u2013 Crowborough \u2013 The Oscar Slater Case.\nWhen i returned from South Africa, I found that my wife had im-\nproved in health during her stay at Naples, and we were able to settle\ndown once more at Hindhead, where, what with work, cricket, and hunt- 10\ning, I had some pleasant years. A few pressing tasks were awaiting me,\nhowever. Besides the barren contest at Edinburgh I had done a history\nof the war, but the war still continued, and I had to modify it and keep\nit up to date in successive editions, until in 1902 it took final shape. I\ncalled it The Great Boer War, not because I thought the war \u2018great\u2019 in the 15\nscale of history, but to distinguish it from the smaller Boer War of 1881.\nIt had the good fortune to please both friend and foe, for there was an\narticle from one of the Boer leaders in Cornhill commending its impartial\ntone. It has been published now by Nelson in a cheap edition, and shows\nevery sign of being the permanent record of the campaign. No less than 20\n\u00a327,000 was spent upon an Official History, but I cannot find that there\nwas anything in it which I had not already chronicled, save for those\nminute details of various forces which clog a narrative. I asked the chief\nofficial historian whether my book had been of use to him, and he very\nhandsomely answered that it had been the spine round which he built. 25\nThis history, which is a large-sized book, is not to be confused with\nthe pamphlet The Cause and Conduct of the War in South Africa, which\nwas a small concise defence of the British position. The inception and\nresult of this I have already described. I have no doubt that it was to the\nlatter that my knighthood, and my appointment as Deputy-Lieutenant of 30\nSurrey, both of which occurred in 1902, were due.\nI remember that on going down to Buckingham Palace to receive\nthe accolade, I found that all who were waiting for various honours were\nherded into funny little pens, according to their style and degree, there\nto await their turn. It chanced that Prof. Oliver Lodge, who was knighted 35\non the same morning, was penned with me, and we plunged at once into\npsychic talk, which made me forget where I was, or what I was there for.\nLodge was really more advanced and certain in his views than I was at\n179 the years between the wars\nthat time, but I was quite sure about the truth of the phenomena, and\nonly doubtful whether some alternative explanation might be found for\na discarnate intelligence as the force at the back of them. This possibility\nI weighed for years before the evidence forced me to the Spiritist con-\n5 clusion. But when, among the cloud of lies with which we are constantly\ngirt, I read that Lodge and I were converted to our present views by the\ndeath of our respective sons, my mind goes back very clearly to that ex-\nchange of thought in 1902. At that time we had both studied the subject\nfor many years.\n10 Among the many congratulations which I had on my knighthood\nthere were few which I valued more highly than that of my old comrade,\nH. A. Gwynne, who knew so much about South African affairs. He was\ngood enough to say: \u2018I look upon your work during this terrible South\nAfrican business as quite equal to that of a successful general.\u2019 This may\n15 well be the exaggeration of friendship, but it is at least pleasing to know\nthat those who were in a position to judge did not look upon me as a\nmere busybody who butts in without due cause.\nThere is one incident at this period which comes back to my memo-\nry, and seems very whimsical. I had taken a course of muscular develop-\n20 ment with Mr. Sandow, the strong man, and in that way had formed an\nacquaintance with him. In the winter of 1901 Mr. Sandow had a lauda-\nble desire to do something for the British wounded, and with that idea\nhe announced a competition at the Albert Hall. He was himself to show\nfeats of strength and then there was to be a muster of strong men who\n25 should exhibit their proportions and receive prizes. There were to be\nthree prizes, a golden statue about two feet high, a silver replica, and a\nbronze. Sandow asked Lawes the sculptor and myself to be the two judg-\nes, he being referee.\nIt proved to be a very big event. The Albert Hall was crowded. There\n30 were eighty competitors, each of whom had to stand on a pedestal, ar-\nrayed only in a leopard\u2019s skin. Lawes and I put them up ten at a time,\nchose one here and one there, and so gradually reduced the number until\nwe only had six left. Then it became excessively difficult, for they were all\nperfectly developed athletes. Finally the matter was simplified by three\n35 extra prizes, and then we got down to the three winners, but had still to\nname their order, which was all-important since the value of the three\nprizes was so very different. The three men were all wonderful specimens,\nbut one was a little clumsy and another a little short, so we gave the val-\n180 chapter 21\nuable gold statue to the middle one, whose name was Murray, and who\ncame from Lancashire. The vast audience was very patient during our\nlong judgment, and showed that it was in general agreement. After the\nmeeting Sandow had invited the prize-winners, the judges and a chosen\ncompany to a late supper, which was very sumptuous, with champagne 5\nflowing freely. When we had finished it was early in the morning. As I left\nthe place of banquet I saw in front of me the winning athlete going forth\ninto the London night with the big golden statue under his arm. I had\nseen that he was a very simple countryman, unused to London ways, so\nI overtook him and asked him what his plans were. He confided to me 10\nthat he had no money, but he had a return ticket to Bolton or Blackburn,\nand his idea was to walk the streets until a train started for the North.\nIt seemed to me a monstrous thing to allow him to wander about with\nhis treasure at the mercy of any murderous gang, so I suggested that he\nshould come back with me to Morley\u2019s Hotel, where I was residing. We 15\ncould not get a cab, and it seemed to me more grotesque than anything\nof Stevenson\u2019s London imaginings, that I should be wandering round at\nthree in the morning in the company of a stranger who bore a great gold-\nen statue of a nude figure in his arms. When at last we reached the hotel\nI told the night porter to get him a room, saying at the same time, \u2018Mind 20\nyou are civil to him, for he has just been declared to be the strongest man\nin England.\u2019 This went round the hotel, and I found that in the morning\nhe held quite a reception, all the maids and waiters paying homage while\nhe lay in bed with his statue beside him. He asked my advice as to selling\nit, for it was of considerable value and seemed a white elephant to a poor 25\nman. I told him he should open a gymnasium in his native town and have\nthe statue exhibited as an advertisement. This he did, and I believe he has\nbeen very successful.\nA post-African task was the building up of rifle clubs, for I was enor-\nmously impressed by the power of the rifle as shown in the recent war. 30\nA soldier was no longer a specialized creature, but every brave man who\ncould hold a rifle-barrel straight was a dangerous man. I founded the Un-\ndershaw Club, which was the father of many others, and which was in-\nspected by Lord Roberts, Mr. Seely and other great men. Within a year or\ntwo England was dotted with village clubs, though I fear that few of them 35\nstill hold their own.\nI was so struck by the factors in modern warfare and I had thought so\nmuch about them in Africa that I wrote about them with some freedom\n181 the years between the wars\nand possibly even with some bitterness, so that I speedily found myself\ninvolved in hot controversy with Colonel Lonsdale Hale, The Times ex-\npert, and also with Colonel Maude, a well-known military writer. Per-\nhaps as a civilian I should have expressed my views in a more subdued\n5 way, but my feelings had been aroused by the conviction that the lives of\nour men, and even the honour of our country, had been jeopardized by\nthe conservatism of the military and that it would so happen again unless\nmore modern views prevailed. I continued to advance my theories for\nthe next ten years, and I have no doubt, when I judge them by the expe-\n10 rience of the Great War, that in the main I was right. The points which I\nmade were roughly as follows:\nThat the rifle (or machine-gun, which is a modified rifle) is the su-\npreme arbiter in war, and that therefore everything must be sacrificed to\nconcentrate upon that.\n15 That the only place for swords, lances and all the frippery of the past\nwas a museum. Bayonets also are very questionable.\nThat cavalry could not divide their allegiance between rifle and\nsword since entirely different ground and tactics are needed for each,\nthe swordsman looking for level sward, the rifleman looking for cover.\n20 Therefore all cavalry should at once become Mounted Rifles.\nThat the very heaviest guns of our fortresses or battleships would be\ntransported by road and used in the field in our next campaign.\nThat field guns must take cover exactly as riflemen do.\nThat the Yeomanry, a very expensive force, should be turned into a\n25 Cyclist organization.\nIn view of the fine work done by the Yeomanry, especially in the\nEastern deserts, I should reconsider the last item, and the bayonet ques-\ntion is debatable, but all the rest will stand. I stressed the fact also that\nthe period of military training is placed too high, and that an excellent\n30 army could be rapidly vamped up if you had the right men. This also was\nproved by the war.\nI remember a debate which I attended as to the proper arms and use\nof cavalry. The cavalry were there in force, all manner of gallant fellows,\nmoustached and debonnaire, inclined to glare at those who would dis-\n35 arm them. Sir Taubman-Goldie was in the chair. Three of us, all civilians,\nupheld the unpopular view that they should lose all their glory and be-\ncome sombre but deadly riflemen. It is curious now to record that the\nthree men were Erskine Childers, Lionel Amery and myself. Childers\n182 chapter 21\nwas shot at dawn as a traitor to Ireland as well as to Britain, Amery be-\ncame First Lord of the Admiralty, and I write this memoir. I remember\nAmery\u2019s amusing comparison when he twitted the cavalry with wishing\nto retain the arme blanche simply because their Continental antagonists\nwould have it. \u2018If you fight a rhinoceros,\u2019 he said, \u2018you don\u2019t want to tie a 5\nhorn on your nose.\u2019 It is an interesting commentary upon this discussion\nthat on one morning during the war there were duels between two sep-\narate squadrons of British and German cavalry. The first two squadrons,\nwho were Lancers, rode through each others\u2019 ranks twice with loss on\neither side and no conclusive result. In the second case German Lancers 10\ncharged British Hussars, who dismounted, used their carbines, and sim-\nply annihilated the small force which attacked them.\nWhen my immediate preoccupations after the war had been got\nrid of, I settled down to attempt some literary work upon a larger and\nmore ambitious scale than the Sherlock Holmes or Brigadier Gerard 15\nstories which had occupied so much of my time. The result was Sir Ni-\ngel, in which I reverted to the spacious days of the White Company, and\nused some of the same characters. Sir Nigel represents in my opinion my\nhigh-water mark in literature, and though that mark may be on sand, still\nan author knows its comparative position to the others. It received no 20\nparticular recognition from critics or public, which was, I admit, a dis-\nappointment to me. In England versatility is looked upon with distrust.\nYou may write ballad tunes or you may write grand opera, but it cannot\nbe admitted that the same man may be master of the whole musical range\nand do either with equal success. 25\nIn 1906 my wife passed away after the long illness which she had\nborne with such exemplary patience. Her end was painless and serene.\nThe long fight had ended at last in defeat, but at least we had held the vital\nfort for thirteen years after every expert had said that it was untenable.\nFor some time after these days of darkness I was unable to settle to work, 30\nuntil the Edalji case came suddenly to turn my energies into an entirely\nunexpected channel.\nIt was in the year 1907 that this notorious case took up much of my\ntime, but it was not wasted, as it ended, after much labour, in partially\nrectifying a very serious miscarriage of justice. The facts of the case are 35\na little complex and became more so as the matter proceeded. George\nEdalji was a young law student, son of the Reverend S. Edalji, the Parsee\nVicar of the parish of Great Wyrley, who had married an English lady.\n183 the years between the wars\nHow the Vicar came to be a Parsee, or how a Parsee came to be the Vicar,\nI have no idea. Perhaps some Catholic-minded patron wished to demon-\nstrate the universality of the Anglican Church. The experiment will not, I\nhope, be repeated, for though the Vicar was an amiable and devoted man,\n5 the appearance of a coloured clergyman with a half-caste son in a rude,\nunrefined parish was bound to cause some regrettable situation.\nBut no one could have foreseen how serious that situation would be-\ncome. The family became the butt of certain malicious wags in the neigh-\nbourhood and were bombarded with anonymous letters, some of them\n10 of the most monstrous description. There was worse, however, to come.\nA horrible epidemic of horse-maiming had broken out, proceeding evi-\ndently from some blood-lusting lunatic of Sadic propensities. These out-\nrages continued for a long time, and the local police were naturally much\ncriticized for doing nothing. It would have been as well had they con-\n15 tinued to do nothing, for they ended by arresting George Edalji for the\ncrime, the main evidence being that there were signs that the writer of\nthe anonymous letters knew something about the crimes, and that it was\nthought that young Edalji had written the anonymous letters which had\nplagued his family so long. The evidence was incredibly weak, and yet the\n20 police, all pulling together and twisting all things to their end, managed\nto get a conviction at the Stafford Quarter Sessions in 1903. The prisoner\nwas sentenced to seven years\u2019 penal servitude.\nThere were some murmurs among discerning people at the time,\nand Mr. Voules, of Truth, has an honourable record for having kept some\n25 sort of agitation going, but nothing practical was done until the unhappy\nyouth had already served three years of his sentence. It was late in 1906\nthat I chanced to pick up an obscure paper called The Umpire, and my eye\ncaught an article which was a statement of his case, made by himself. As\nI read, the unmistakable accent of truth forced itself upon my attention\n30 and I realized that I was in the presence of an appalling tragedy, and that\nI was called upon to do what I could to set it right. I got other papers on\nthe case, studied the original trial, went up to Staffordshire and saw the\nfamily, went over the scene of the crimes and finally wrote a series of\narticles on the case, which began in the Daily Telegraph of January 12,\n35 1907. As I bargained that they should be non-copyright they were largely\ntransferred to other papers, sold for a penny at street kerbs and generally\nhad a very wide circulation, so that England soon rang with the wrongs\nof George Edalji.\n184 chapter 21\nThese wrongs would have been almost comic had they not had so\ntragic an upshot. If the whole land had been raked, I do not think that\nit would have been possible to find a man who was so unlikely, and in-\ndeed so incapable, of committing such actions. He was of irreproachable\ncharacter. Nothing in his life had ever been urged against him. His old 5\nschoolmaster with years of experience testified to his mild and tractable\ndisposition. He had served his time with a Birmingham solicitor, who\ngave him the highest references. He had never shown traits of cruelty. He\nwas so devoted to his work that he had won the highest honours in the\nlegal classes, and he had already at the age of twenty-seven written a book 10\nupon Railway Law. Finally he was a total abstainer, and so blind that he\nwas unable to recognize anyone at the distance of six yards. It was clear\nthat the inherent improbability of such a man committing a long succes-\nsion of bloody and brutal crimes was so great that it could only be met by\nthe suggestion of insanity. There had never, however, been any indication 15\neven of eccentricity in George Edalji. On the contrary, his statements of\ndefence were measured and rational, and he had come through a series of\nexperiences which might well have unhinged a weaker intellect.\nThe original theory at the trial had been that Edalji had committed\nthe particular mutilations with which he was charged some time in the 20\nevening. This line of attack broke down completely, and he was able to ad-\nvance a certain alibi. In the middle of the case, therefore, the police pros-\necution shifted its ground and advanced the new theory that it was done\nin the early hours of the morning. George Edalji, as it happened, slept in\nthe same room as his father, the parish vicar. The latter is a light sleeper 25\nand is accustomed, as many people are, to assure privacy by turning the\nkey of his room. He swore that George never left the room during the\nnight. This may not constitute an absolute alibi in the eye of the law, but\nit is difficult to imagine anything nearer to one unless a sentinel had been\nplaced outside the door all night. It is so near an alibi that nothing but 30\nthe most cogent considerations could shake it, but far from there being\nany such considerations, the case was such a thing of threads and patches\nthat one cannot imagine how any sane jury could have accepted it, even\nthough the defence was weakly conducted. So bad was this defence that\nin the whole trial no mention, so far as I could ascertain, was ever made 35\nof the fact that the man was practically blind, save in good light, while\nbetween his house and the place where the mutilation was committed lay\nthe full breadth of the London and North-Western Railway, an expanse\n185 the years between the wars\nof rails, wires and other obstacles, with hedges to be forced on either side,\nso that I, a strong and active man, in broad daylight found it a hard matter\nto pass.\nWhat aroused my indignation and gave me the driving force to carry\n5 the thing through was the utter helplessness of this forlorn little group of\npeople, the coloured clergyman in his strange position, the brave blue-\neyed, grey-haired wife, the young daughter, baited by brutal boors and\nhaving the police, who should have been their natural protectors, adopt-\ning from the beginning a harsh tone towards them and accusing them,\n10 beyond all sense and reason, of being the cause of their own troubles and\nof persecuting and maligning themselves. Such an exhibition, sustained,\nI am sorry to say, by Lord Gladstone and all the forces of the Home Of-\nfice, would have been incredible had I not actually examined the facts.\nThe articles caused a storm of indignation through the country. Truth,\n15 Sir George Lewis and other forces joined in the good work. A committee\nwas formed by the Government to examine and report. It consisted of Sir\nArthur Wilson, the Hon. John Lloyd Wharton and Sir Albert de Rutzen.\nTheir finding, which came to hand in June, was a compromise document,\nfor though they were severe upon the condemnation of Edalji and saw no\n20 evidence which associated him with the crime, they still clung to the the-\nory that he had written the anonymous letters, that he had therefore been\nhimself contributory to the miscarriage of justice, and that for this reason\nall compensation for his long period of suffering should be denied him.\nIt was a wretched decision, and the Law Society at the prompting\n25 of Sir George Lewis showed what they thought of it by at once read-\nmitting Edalji to the roll of solicitors with leave to practise, which they\nwould never have done had they thought him capable of dishonourable\nconduct. But the result stands. To this day this unfortunate man, whose\nhumble family has paid many hundreds of pounds in expenses, has never\n30 been able to get one shilling of compensation for the wrong done. It is a\nblot upon the record of English Justice, and even now it should be wiped\nout. It is to be remembered that the man was never tried for writing the\nletters \u2013 a charge which could not have been sustained \u2013 so that as the\nmatter stands he has got no redress for three years of admitted false im-\n35 prisonment, on the score that he did something else for which he has\nnever been tried. What a travesty of Justice! The Daily Telegraph got up a\nsubscription for him which ran to some \u00a3300. The first use that he made\nof the money was to repay an old aunt who had advanced the funds for\n186 chapter 21\nhis defence. He came to my wedding reception, and there was no guest\nwhom I was prouder to see.\nSo far, my work had been satisfactory. Where I caused myself great\ntrouble was that in my local exploration at Wyrley I had come across\nwhat seemed to me a very direct clue as to both the writer, or rather 5\nwriters, of the letters, and also of the identity of the mutilator \u2013 though\nthe latter word may also have been in the plural. I became interested, the\nmore so as the facts were very complex and I had to do with people who\nwere insane as well as criminal. I have several letters threatening my life\nin the same writing as those which assailed the Edaljis \u2013 a fact which did 10\nnot appear to shake in the least the Home Office conviction that George\nEdalji had written them all. Mentally I began to class the Home Office\nofficials as insane also. The sad fact is that officialdom in England stands\nsolid together, and that when you are forced to attack it you need not ex-\npect justice, but rather that you are up against an unavowed Trade Union 15\nthe members of which are not going to act the blackleg to each other,\nand which subordinates the public interest to a false idea of loyalty. What\nconfronts you is a determination to admit nothing which inculpates an-\nother official, and as to the idea of punishing another official for offences\nwhich have caused misery to helpless victims, it never comes within their 20\nhorizon. Even now, after the lapse of so many years, I can hardly think\nwith patience of the handling of this case.\nThe mistake that I made, so far as my own interests were concerned,\nwas that having got on the track of the miscreant I let the police and the\nHome Office know my results before they were absolutely completed. 25\nThere was a strong prim\u00e2 facie case, but it needed the goodwill and co-op-\neration of the authorities to ram it home. That co-operation was wanting,\nwhich was intelligible, in the case of the local police, since it traversed\ntheir previous convictions and conclusions, but was inexcusable in the\nHome Office. The law officers of the Crown upheld their view that there 30\nwas not a prim\u00e2 facie case, but I fear that consciously or unconsciously\nthe same trade union principle was at work. Let me briefly state the case\nthat the public may judge. I will call the suspect X. I was able to show:\nThat X had shown a peculiar knife or horse-lancet to someone and\nhad stated that this knife did the crimes. I had this knife in my possession. 35\nThat this knife or a similar knife must have been used in some of the\ncrimes, as shown by the shallow incision.\nThat X had been trained in the slaughter-yard and the cattle-ship, and\n187 the years between the wars\nwas accustomed to brutal treatment of animals.\nThat he had a clear record both of anonymous letters and of destruc-\ntive propensities.\nThat his writing and that of his brother exactly fitted into the two\n5 writings of the anonymous letters. In this I had strong independent evi-\ndence.\nThat he had shown signs of periodical insanity, and that his house-\nhold and bedroom were such that he could leave unseen at any hour of\nthe night.\n10 There were very many corroborative evidences, but those were the\nmain ones, coupled with the fact that when X was away for some years\nthe letters and outrages stopped, but began again when he returned. On\nthe other hand, when Edalji was put in prison the outrages went on the\nsame as before.\n15 It will hardly be believed that after I had laid these facts before the\nHome Office they managed to present the House of Commons with the\nofficial legal opinion that there was not a prim\u00e2 facie case, while a high\nofficial, Mr. Ernley Blackwell, said to me: \u2018I see no more evidence against\nthese two brothers than against myself and my brother.\u2019 The points I\n20 mention are taken from the paper I laid before the law officers of the\nCrown, which lies before me as I write, so the facts are exactly as stated.\nI had one letter in sorrow and also in anger from the Staffordshire\npolice complaining that I should be libelling this poor young man whose\nidentity could easily be established.\n25 I do not know what has become of X or how often he has been con-\nvicted since, but on the last occasion of which I have notes the magistrate\nsaid in condemning him to six months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour:\n\u2018His character was extremely bad, he having been convicted of arson, of\nstealing on three occasions and of damage. On his own confession he\n30 had committed a deliberate and cruel theft from his aged mother and\nit was impossible to overlook the seriousness of the case.\u2019 So much for\nthe inoffensive youth whom I had libelled! But what about Edalji\u2019s three\nyears of gaol?\nOn September 18, 1907, I married Miss Jean Leckie, the younger\n35 daughter of a Blackheath family whom I had known for years, and who\nwas a dear friend of my mother and sister. There are some things which\none feels too intimately to be able to express, and I can only say that the\nyears have passed without one shadow coming to mar even for a moment\n188 chapter 21\nthe sunshine of my Indian summer which now deepens to a golden au-\ntumn. She and my three younger children with the kindly sympathy of\nmy two elder ones have made my home an ideally happy one.\nMy wife\u2019s people had a house at Crowborough, and there they had\ngone to reside. As they were very attached I thought it would be a happy 5\narrangement not to separate them, so I bought a house close by, named\n\u2018Windlesham.\u2019 As I paid for it by a sum of money which I recovered af-\nter I had been unjustly defrauded of it, my friends suggested \u2018Swindlesh-\nam\u2019 as a more appropriate name. Thus it came about that in 1907 I left\nUndershaw, Hindhead, after ten years\u2019 residence, and moved myself and 10\nmy belongings to the highlands of Sussex, where I have dwelt in the few\nmonths of settled life which give me a rest between my wanderings.\nVery soon after my marriage, having just got clear of the Edalji case, I\nbecame entangled in that of Oscar Slater. The one was in a way the cause\nof the other, for since I was generally given credit for having got Edal- 15\nji out of his troubles, it was hoped by those who believed that Slater\u2019s\ncondemnation was a miscarriage of justice that I might be able to do the\nsame for him. I went into the matter most reluctantly, but when I glanced\nat the facts, I saw that it was an even worse case than the Edalji one, and\nthat this unhappy man had in all probability no more to do with the mur- 20\nder for which he had been condemned than I had. I am convinced that\nwhen on being convicted he cried out to the judge that he never knew\nthat such a woman as the murdered woman existed he was speaking the\nliteral truth.\nIn one respect the Oscar Slater case was not so serious as the Edalji 25\none, because Slater was not a very desirable member of society. He had\nnever, so far as is known, been in trouble as a criminal, but he was a gam-\nbler and adventurer \u2013 a German Jew by extraction, living under an alias.\nEdalji, on the other hand, was a blameless youth. But in another aspect\nSlater\u2019s case was worse than that of Edalji, since the charge was murder. 30\nHe was very nearly hanged, and finally the life sentence was actually car-\nried out. It is a dreadful blot upon the administration of justice in Scot-\nland, and such judicial crimes are not, I am convinced, done with impu-\nnity even to the most humble. Somehow \u2013 somewhere, there comes a\nnational punishment in return. 35\nThe case was roughly this: an elderly woman, Miss Gilchrist, was\ndone to death most brutally in her flat, while her servant-maid, Helen\nLambie, was absent for ten minutes on an errand. Her head was beaten\n189 the years between the wars\nto pieces by some hard instrument. The neighbours were alarmed by the\nnoise, and one of them, together with the maid, actually saw the murder-\ner, a young man, leave the flat and pass him at the door. The police de-\nscription at the time was by no means in agreement with Slater\u2019s appear-\n5 ance. Robbery did not appear to be the motive of the crime, for nothing\nwas missing unless it was a single diamond brooch. On the other hand,\na box of papers had been broken into and left in disorder. The date was\nDecember 21, 1908.\nAnd now comes the great fact which is admitted by all, and which\n10 makes the whole case wildly improbable if not utterly impossible. It was\nthought that a diamond brooch had been taken. It was found out that\na diamond brooch had also been pawned by the Bohemian Slater, who\nhad started for America. Was it not clear that he was the murderer? New\nYork was warned. Slater was arrested and in due time was returned to\n15 Glasgow. Then came the fiasco. It was found beyond all doubt that the\nbrooch in question had been in Slater\u2019s possession for years, and that it\nhad nothing to do with Miss Gilchrist at all.\nThis should have been the end of the case. It was too preposterous\nto suppose that out of all the folk in Glasgow the police had arrested the\n20 right man by pure chance \u2013 for that was what it amounted to. But the\npublic had lost its head, and so had the police. If the case had completely\ngone to pieces surely it could be reconstructed in some fresh form. Slat-\ner was poor and friendless. He had lived with a woman, which shocked\nScotch morality. As one writer boldly said in the press: \u2018Even if he did\n25 not do it, he deserved to be condemned, anyhow.\u2019 A case was made up in\nthe most absurd manner. A half-crown card of tools was found in his box\nwith the sort of tools which are found on such cards. The frail hammer\nwas evidently the instrument which had beaten in the woman\u2019s skull. The\nhandle might have been cleaned. Then surely there had been blood on it.\n30 The police description was already amended so as to be nearer to Slater.\nHe, a sallow, dark-haired Jew, was picked out by witnesses from among\na group of fair Scotsmen. Someone had been seen waiting in the street\nfor some nights before. This someone was variously described by many\nwitnesses. Some descriptions would fit Slater, some were his very oppo-\n35 site. The people who saw the murderer leave thought it might be Slater,\nbut were not sure. The chief witness, Adams, was very short-sighted and\nhad not his glasses. A clear alibi was proved by Slater, but as his mistress\nand his servant girl were the witnesses, it was not allowed. Whom could\n190 chapter 21\nhe produce save the inmates of his house? No attempt was ever made\nto show that Slater had any connection with Miss Gilchrist, or with the\nmaid, Lambie, and as Slater was really a stranger in Glasgow, it was im-\npossible to see how he could have known anything about this retired\nold maid. But he was not too well defended, while Mr. Ure, the Advo- 5\ncate-General of Scotland, prosecuting for the State, thundered away in a\nmost violent speech in which several statements were made, uncorrected\nby Judge Guthrie, which were very inexact, and which must have power-\nfully swayed the jury. Finally, the Crown got a conviction by nine votes\nto six (five \u2018not proven\u2019) \u2013 which, of course, would have meant a new trial 10\nin England, and the wretched foreigner was condemned to death. The\nscaffold was actually erected, and it was only two mornings before his\nexecution that the order came which prevented a judicial murder. As it\nwas, the man became a convict for life.\nIt is an atrocious story, and as I read it and realized the wickedness 15\nof it all, I was moved to do all I could for the man. I was aided by the\nopinion of Sir Herbert Stephen, who read the evidence and declared that\nthere was not even a prim\u00e2 facie case against the man. I, therefore, started\na newspaper agitation and wrote a small book with an account of the\nwhole matter. The consciences of some people responded, and finally we 20\ngot up sufficient pressure to induce the Government to appoint a Com-\nmissioner, Sheriff Miller, to examine the case. It was all to no purpose,\nand the examination was a farce. The terms of reference were so narrow\nthat the conduct of the police was entirely excluded, which was really the\nvery thing at issue, since we held that where their original evidence failed 25\nthem, they had strained many points in trying to build up a case and to\nobtain a verdict. It was also decided that evidence should not be on oath.\nThe result was that there was no result, nor could there be with such lim-\nitations. None the less, some fresh evidence was put forward which fur-\nther weakened the already very weak case for the prosecution. For exam- 30\nple, at the trial it had been stated that Slater, on reaching Liverpool from\nGlasgow, had gone to a Liverpool hotel under a false name, as if he were\ntrying to throw the police off his track. It was shown that this was not\ntrue, and that he had signed the register with his own Glasgow name. I\nsay his Glasgow name, for he had several pseudonyms in the course of his 35\nnot too reputable career, and, as a fact, he took his actual passage under a\nfalse name, showing that he intended to make a clear start in America. He\nwas, according to his own account, pursued by some woman \u2013 probably\n191 the years between the wars\nhis lawful wife \u2013 and this covering of tracks was to escape this huntress.\nThe fact that he used his own name at the hotel showed that the new\nname was for American rather than for British use, and that he had no\nfear of Glasgow pursuit.\n5 We could do no more, and there the matter rested. There was a very\nugly aftermath of the case, which consisted of what appeared to be the\nshameful persecution of Mr. Trench, a detective who had given evidence\nat the inquiry which told in favour of our view. A charge was shortly af-\nterwards made against both him and a solicitor, Mr. Cook, who had been\n10 conspicuous upon Slater\u2019s side, which might well have ruined them both.\nAs it was, it caused them great anxiety and expense. There had been a\nmost unpleasant political flavour to the whole proceedings; but on this\noccasion the case came before a Conservative Judge, Mr. Scott Dickson,\nwho declared that it should never have been brought into court, and\n15 dismissed it forthwith with contempt. It is a curious circumstance that\nas I write, Judge Guthrie, Ure, Cook, Trench, Miller and others have all\npassed on.\nOne strange psychic fact should be mentioned which was brought\nto my notice by Mr. Marshall Hall. There was a Spiritualist circle which\n20 used to meet at Falkirk, and shortly after the trial messages were received\nby it which purported to come from the murdered woman. She was\nasked what the weapon was which had slain her. She answered that it\nwas an iron box-opener. Now I had pondered over the nature of certain\nwounds in the woman\u2019s face, which consisted of two cuts with a little\n25 bridge of unbroken skin between. They might have been caused by the\nclaw end of a hammer, but on the other hand, one of the woman\u2019s eyes\nhad been pushed back into her brain, which could hardly have been done\nby a hammer, which would have burst the eyeball first. I could think of\nno instrument which would meet the case. But the box-opener would ex-\n30 actly do so, for it has a forked end which would make the double wound,\nand it is also straight so that it might very well penetrate to the brain,\ndriving the eye in front of it. The reader will reasonably ask why did not\nthe Spiritualists ask the name of the criminal. I believe that they did and\nreceived a reply, but I do not think that such evidence could or should\n35 ever be used or published. It could only be useful as the starting point of\nan inquiry.\nThere was one intervention during those years to which I look back\nwith satisfaction, and that was my protest against the King\u2019s Oath before\n192 chapter 21\nthe Coronation of King Edward. The Oath was actually changed, and\nthough my protest may have had no effect upon that historic fact, it was\nnone the less the first letter in The Times upon the subject.\nIt ran thus:\n5\nsir, \u2013\nSurely Colonel Sandys and the members of the Protestant Refor-\nmation Society should, looking at the matter simply from their own\npoint of view, recognize that the surest way to strengthen any creed 10\nis, as the whole history of the world has proved, to persecute it. And\nit is mere juggling with words to attempt to show that it is anything\nother than persecution to hold up the Roman Catholic faith to\nobloquy in the Coronation Oath, while every other creed, Christian\nor non-Christian, is left unassailed. Is it not a shocking thing that, 15\nwhile Roman Catholic chapels throughout the whole Empire are\nstill draped in black for a deceased Monarch, his successor should\nbe compelled by law to insult the most intimate convictions of these\nsame mourners?\n20\nAnd is it not a most narrow and foolish policy, unworthy of this tol-\nerant age, that a young King should be forced to offend the feelings\nof great numbers of Irishmen, Canadians and other subjects? I feel\nsure that, apart from Catholics, the great majority of broadminded\nthinkers of any or of no denomination in this country are of opinion 25\nthat the outcry of fanatics should be disregarded, and that all creeds\nshould receive the same courteous and respectful treatment so long\nas their adherents are members of the common Empire. To bring\nthese medieval rancours to an end would indeed be an auspicious\nopening of a new reign. 30\nYours faithfully,\nARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.\n193 Chapter 22\nTHE YEARS BETWEEN THE WARS (CONTD.)\n5 Constantinople \u2013 A Strange Creature \u2013 The Night of Power \u2013 Dorando \u2013\nDramatic Adventures \u2013 Psychic Experience \u2013 The Congo Agitation \u2013 Olympic\nGames \u2013 Divorce Reform \u2013 Speculation.\nYears of peaceful work followed my marriage, broken only by two\n10 journeys to the Mediterranean, in the course of which we explored some\nout-of-the-way portions of Greece, and visited Egypt, where I found hard-\nly one single man left of all the good fellows whom I had once known. In\nthe course of our travels we visited Constantinople, looking at the great\nguns in the forts on the Dardanelles, with little thought of all the British\n15 lives which were to be sacrificed upon those low, dark hills which slope\ndown to the Northern shore. In Constantinople we attended the weekly\nselamlik of Abdul Hamid, and saw him with his dyed beard and the ladies\nof his harem as they passed down to their devotions. It was an incredible\nsight to Western eyes to see the crowd of officers and officials, many of\n20 them fat and short of wind, who ran like dogs behind his carriage in the\nhope that they might catch the Imperial eye. It was Ramadan, and the old\nSultan sent me a message that he had read my books and that he would\ngladly have seen me had it not been the Holy month. He interviewed\nme through his Chamberlain and presented me with the Order of the\n25 Medjidie, and, what was more pleasing to me, he gave the Order of the\nChevakat to my wife. As this is the Order of Compassion, and as my wife\never since she set foot in Constantinople had been endeavouring to feed\nthe horde of starving dogs who roamed the streets, no gift could have\nbeen more appropriate.\n30 We were admitted secretly and by very special favour into the great\nMosque of Sophia during the sacred festival which is known as the Night\nof Power. It was a most marvellous spectacle as from the upper circle of\npillared arches we looked down upon 60,000 lighted lamps and 12,000\nworshippers, who made, as they rose and fell in their devotions, a sound\n35 like the wash of the sea. The priests in their high pulpits were screaming\nlike seagulls, and fanaticism was in the air. It was at this moment that I\nsaw a woman \u2013 I will not call her a lady \u2013 young and flighty, seat herself\njauntily on the edge of the stone parapet, and look down at the 12,000\n194 chapter 22\nmen who were facing us. No unbeliever should be tolerated there, and a\nwoman was the abomination of abominations. I heard a low deep growl\nand saw fierce bearded faces looking up. It only needed one fiery spirit to\nhead the rush and we should have been massacred \u2013 with the poor con-\nsolation that some of us at least had really asked for it. However, she was 5\npulled down, and we made our way as quickly and as quietly as possible\nout of a side door. It was time, I think.\nOne curious incident of our journey stands out in my memory. We\nwere steaming past \u00c6gina on a lovely day with calm water around us. The\ncaptain, a courteous Italian, had allowed us to go upon the bridge, and we 10\n\u2013 my wife and I \u2013 were looking down into the transparent depths when\nwe both clearly saw a creature which has never, so far as I know, been\ndescribed by Science. It was exactly like a young ichthyosaurus, about 4\nfeet long, with thin neck and tail, and four marked side-flippers. The ship\nhad passed it before we could call any other observer. I was interested 15\nto notice that Admiral Anstruther in the Evening News some years later\ndescribed, and drew, an exactly similar creature which he had seen under\nwater off the Irish coast. This old world has got some surprises for us yet.\nHere and there, as I look back at those long and happy years, some\nparticular episode flashes vividly into my memory. I do not often do 20\njournalistic work \u2013 why should one poach upon the preserves of others?\n\u2013 but on the occasion of the Olympic Games of 1908 I was tempted,\nchiefly by the offer of an excellent seat, to do the Marathon Race for the\nDaily Mail. It was certainly a wonderful experience, for it will be known\nto history as the Dorando Race. Perhaps a few short paragraphs from my 25\ndescription may even now recapture the thrill of it. The huge crowd \u2013\nsome 50,000 people \u2013 were all watching the entrance to the stadium, the\ndark gap through which the leader must appear. Then \u2013\n\u2018At last he came. But how different from the exultant victor whom\nwe expected! Out of the dark archway there staggered a little man, with 30\nred running-drawers, a tiny boy-like creature. He reeled as he entered\nand faced the roar of the applause. Then he feebly turned to the left and\nwearily trotted round the track. Friends and encouragers were pressing\nround him.\n\u2018Suddenly the whole group stopped. There were wild gesticulations. 35\nMen stooped and rose again. Good heavens! he has fainted; is it possible\nthat even at this last moment the prize may slip through his fingers? Every\neye slides round to that dark archway. No second man has yet appeared.\n195 the years between the wars (contd.)\nThen a great sigh of relief goes up. I do not think in all that great assembly\nany man would have wished victory to be torn at the last instant from this\nplucky little Italian. He has won it. He should have it.\n\u2018Thank God, he is on his feet again \u2013 the little red legs going inco-\n5 herently, but drumming hard, driven by a supreme will within. There is\na groan as he falls once more and a cheer as he staggers to his feet. It is\nhorrible, and yet fascinating, this struggle between a set purpose and an\nutterly exhausted frame. Again, for a hundred yards, he ran in the same\nfurious and yet uncertain gait. Then again he collapsed, kind hands sav-\n10 ing him from a heavy fall.\n\u2018He was within a few yards of my seat. Amid stooping figures and\ngrasping hands I caught a glimpse of the haggard, yellow face, the glazed,\nexpressionless eyes, the lank black hair streaked across the brow. Surely\nhe is done now. He cannot rise again.\n15 \u2018From under the archway has darted the second runner, Hayes, Stars\nand Stripes on his breast, going gallantly, well within his strength. There\nis only twenty yards to do if the Italian can do it. He staggered up, no\ntrace of intelligence upon his set face, and again the red legs broke into\ntheir strange automatic amble.\n20 \u2018Will he fall again? No, he sways, he balances, and then he is through\nthe tape and into a score of friendly arms. He has gone to the extreme of\nhuman endurance. No Roman of the prime ever bore himself better than\nDorando of the Olympic of 1908. The great breed is not yet extinct.\u2019\nOf course the prize went to the American, as his rival had been\n25 helped, but the sympathy of the crowd, and I am sure of every sporting\nAmerican present, went out to the little Italian. I not only wrote Dorando\nup, but I started a subscription for him in the Daily Mail, which realized\nover \u00a3300 \u2013 a fortune in his Italian village \u2013 so that he was able to start a\nbaker\u2019s shop, which he could not have done on an Olympic medal. My\n30 wife made the presentation in English, which he could not understand;\nhe answered in Italian, which we could not understand; but I think we\nreally did understand each other all the same.\nThere is no denying that the American team were very unpopular\nin London, though the unpopularity was not national, for the stadium\n35 was thick with American flags. Everyone admitted that they were a splen-\ndid lot of athletes, but they were not wisely handled and I saw with my\nown eyes that they did things which would not have been tolerated if\ndone by an English team in New York. However, there may well have\n196 chapter 22\nbeen some want of tact on both sides, and causes at work of which the\npublic knew nothing. When I consider the Dunraven Yacht race, and\nthen these Olympic Games, I am by no means assured that sport has\nthat international effect for good which some people have claimed for it.\nI wonder whether any of the old Grecian wars had their real origin in the 5\nawards at Olympia. I may add that we had a dozen or so of the American\nboys down to \u2018Windlesham,\u2019 where we had a very pleasant day together.\nI found them all excellent fellows. I put up a billiard Olympic prize, and\none of them bore it off with him. The whole incident was very pleasant.\nMy work for a few years after my marriage ran largely in the direction 10\nof drama, and if it was not lucrative it at least provided us with a good\ndeal of amusement and excitement. In the case of one venture this ex-\ncitement became a little too poignant, though all ended well in the end. I\nhad dramatized Rodney Stone under the name of The House of Temperley,\nwith all the ring scenes and prize fights included, and treated in the most 15\nrealistic fashion. We had an excellent boxing instructor who took one of\nthe smaller parts and who not only fought himself but trained the others\nto a remarkable degree of skill. So realistic was it that when on the first\nnight the bully, Berks, after a long encounter, went down with a crash\nfrom a fine raking uppercut, there was an involuntary groan from the 20\nwhole house, which meant as clearly as could be, \u2018There now, you have\nkilled a man for our amusement.\u2019 It was really incredibly well done and\nI could never have believed that such scenes could be so cleverly faked,\nthough it was not always done with impunity, for Rex Davies, who played\nGloucester Dick, assured me that he lost a tooth and broke both a finger 25\nand a rib during his engagement. The play itself was unequal, but was so\nvery novel and sensational in its best scenes that it should have been a\nconsiderable success. I found no manager who would take the risk, and\nI had myself to take the Adelphi Theatre for a six months\u2019 lease, at a rent\nwhich with the Company worked out at about \u00a3600 a week. As on the 30\ntop of this the production cost about \u00a32,000, it will be seen that I was\nplunging rather deep.\nAnd luck did not favour us. The furore for boxing had not yet set in.\nLadies were afraid to come, and imagined it would be a brutal spectacle.\nThose who did come were exhilarated beyond measure, but the preju- 35\ndice still weighed heavily against us. Then there came one of those theat-\nrical slumps when everything goes wrong, and finally King Edward died\nand that killed it outright. It was a very serious situation. I still had the\n197 the years between the wars (contd.)\ntheatre upon my hands. I might sublet it, or I might not. If I did not, the\nexpense was simply ruinous.\nIt was under these circumstances that, as I have already said, I wrote\nand rehearsed The Speckled Band in record time, and so saved the situa-\n5 tion. The real fault of this play was that in trying to give Holmes a worthy\nantagonist I overdid it and produced a more interesting personality in\nthe villain. The terrible ending was also against it. However, it was a con-\nsiderable success and saved a difficult \u2013 almost a desperate \u2013 situation.\nYet another theatrical venture was my Fires of Fate, some of which is\n10 certainly the best dramatic work that I have ever done. It was unlucky,\nas it was produced in a very hot summer. I carried it at my own expense\nthrough the two impossible holiday months, but when Lewis Waller,\nwho played the hero, returned from a provincial tour to London, he was\nkeen on some new play and my Fires were never really burned out. I fancy\n15 sometimes that they might even now flame up again if given a chance. I\nstage managed most of this play myself, and with curious results. There\nare certain dramatic conventionalities which can only be broken through\nby one who is not himself an actor. There was a scene where a number of\nhelpless tourists, men and women, were brutally ill-treated by Arabs. The\n20 brutality in rehearsal was conventional. I made the Arabs get imitation\nwhips and cudgels and really savage the poor travellers. The effect was\nnovel and appalling. There was a young Welsh officer in the front of the\nstalls who was a friend of my brother\u2019s. He held both the V.C. and the\nD.S.O. So stirred was he by the sight that he could hardly be restrained\n25 from clambering on to the stage in order to help the unhappy tourists.\nThe end of that act, when the drove of bleeding captives are led away and\nyou hear the monotonous song of the Arabs as they march, and you see\nLewis Waller, who has been left for dead, struggle up on his elbow and\nsignal across the Nile for assistance, was one which brought the whole\n30 house to its feet. Such moments to a dramatist give a thrill of personal\nsatisfaction such as the most successful novelist never can feel. There is\nno more subtle pleasure if you are really satisfied with your work than to\nsit in the shadow of a box and watch not the play but the audience.\nI had one other dramatic venture, Brigadier Gerard, which also was\n35 mildly successful. In fact, I have never known failure on the stage save in\nthe case of the unfortunate Jane Annie. Lewis Waller played the Brigadier\nand a splendid dashing Hussar he made. It was a glorious performance. I\nremember that in this play also I ran up against the conventionalities of\n198 chapter 22\nthe stage. I had a group of Hussar officers, the remnants of the regiment\nwhich had gone through Napoleon\u2019s last campaign. When it came to the\ndress rehearsal, I found them, to my horror, dressed up in brand new uni-\nforms of chestnut and silver. \u2018Good heavens!\u2019 I cried. \u2018This is not a comic\nopera!\u2019 \u2018What do you want done?\u2019 asked Waller. \u2018Why,\u2019 said I, \u2018these men 5\nare warriors, not ballet dancers. They have been out in all weathers day\nand night for months. Every scrap of truth goes out of the play if they\nappear like that.\u2019 The uniforms had cost over a hundred pounds, but I\ncovered them with mud and dust and tore holes in them. The result was\nthat, with begrimed faces, I got a band of real Napoleonic soldiers. Waller 10\nhimself insisted on retaining his grease paint and his nice new clothes,\nbut I am sure every man in the audience, if not every woman, would have\nliked him better as I had made the others. Poor Willie Waller! There was\nsome strange and wonderful blood in his veins. He was a glorious fel-\nlow, and his premature death a great blow to our stage. What virility! 15\nWhat a face and figure! They called him the \u2018Flappers\u2019 idol,\u2019 and it re-\nflects credit on the flapper, for where could she find a less sickly and more\nmanly type? He caught his fatal illness in serving the soldiers. One of his\ngreatest possessions was his voice. He came down to \u2018Windlesham\u2019 once,\nand as he was reciting in the music-room that wonderful resonant voice 20\nchanced to catch the exact note which corresponded to the curve of all\nthe glass lampshades on the walls. They all started thrilling as a wine-\nglass does when it is touched. I could quite believe after that, that matter\ncould be disintegrated by sound if the sound were strong enough. I am\nnot clear what blood ran in Waller\u2019s veins, Hebrew or Basque or both. I 25\nonly know that it went to make a very wonderful man. His intense feeling\nabout everything that he did was one of his characteristics and no doubt\na cause of his success. It did not carry him far in golf, however. I remem-\nber hearing him as he approached the last tee mutter, \u2018God, give me one\ngood drive.\u2019 I fear, however, that the betting was against it. 30\nIn 1910 a fresh task opened up before me. It arose from my being\ndeeply moved by reading some of the evidence concerning the evil rule,\nnot of Belgium, but of the King of the Belgians in the Congo. I examined\nthis evidence carefully before I accepted it, and I assured myself that it\nwas supported by five British Consuls and by Lord Cromer, as well as by 35\ntravellers of many races, Belgian, French, American, Swedish and others.\nAn attempt has been made since to minimize the facts and to pretend\nthat Roger Casement had been at the back of the agitation for sinister\n199 the years between the wars (contd.)\npurposes of his own. This contention is quite untenable and the evidence\nfor the atrocities is overwhelming and from very many sources, the Bel-\ngians themselves being among the best witnesses. I put in some two years\nworking with Mr. Morel and occasionally lecturing in the country upon\n5 this question, and it was certainly the efforts of the Congo Association\nwhich we represented, that eventually brought the question to the notice\nof that noble man King Albert which meant setting it right so that the\ncolony is now, so far as I know, very well managed. Casement, whom I\nshall always regard as a fine man afflicted with mania, has met his tragic\n10 end, and Morel\u2019s views upon the war have destroyed the feelings which\nI had for him, but I shall always maintain that they both did noble work\nin championing the wrongs of those unhappy and helpless negroes. My\nown book The Crime of the Congo, which was translated into all European\nlanguages, had also, I hope, some influence towards that end.\n15 In the early summer of 1912 I had a telegram from Lord Northcliffe\nwhich let me in for about as much trouble as any communication which\nI have ever received. It was to the effect that Britain must regain her place\namong the athletic nations which had been temporarily eclipsed by the\nOlympic Games at Stockholm, and that I was the one man in Great Brit-\n20 ain who could rally round me the various discordant forces which had\nto be united and used. This was very complimentary, but it was Lord\nNorthcliffe\u2019s sole contribution to the matter for a very long time, and I\nwas left to my own devices entirely in carrying out a complex task. So\nbadly co-ordinated were Northcliffe\u2019s papers that I had some of them ac-\n25 tually attacking me while I was working on their chief\u2019s suggestion.\nWhen I examined I found chaos. On the one hand was the British\nOlympic Committee, a most sound and respectable body, under Lord\nDesborough. In some way they had lost touch with press and public and\nwere generally in disfavour, though really they had done their best. On\n30 the other hand was The Times, which had worked itself into a fury about\nthe misdeeds of the Committee, and had set a tone which poisoned the\nwhole press against them. Lord Northcliffe would have nothing to do\nwith anything which emanated from the Committee; the Committee\ndefied Lord Northcliffe. It was clear that this had to be cleared up as a\n35 preliminary, and the matter took enough diplomacy to have settled the\nBalkan question. I called upon the Committee and suggested that an in-\ndependent body be formed on which they could be represented. To this\nthey agreed. I then called on The Times and said: \u2018You are no longer deal-\n200 chapter 22\ning with the old Olympic Committee, but with a new body. Do you agree\nto this?\u2019 Yes, that was all in order. I may have omitted the trifling fact that\nthe new body did not yet exist. I then asked Mr. Studd, the famous crick-\neter of old and head of the Polytechnic to help me to form the new body.\nWe soon had a very effective one, including several leading athletes and 5\nLord Forster, later Governor-General of Australia. I served, of course, on\nthe Committee, and soon we were in touch with everyone and all prom-\nised to go smoothly.\nBut presently a huge mistake was made. I don\u2019t wish to represent my-\nself as the fount of all wisdom, and no doubt I make as many slips as my 10\nfellows, but that particular one would never have been made had I been\npresent, but I was called away and was out of the country at that crucial\nCommittee meeting. It had been already determined that an appeal to\nthe public over all our names should be issued. The amount had not been\ndiscussed, but in my own mind I had thought that \u00a310,000 would suf- 15\nfice. I was horrified, therefore, when I returned from my holiday to find\nthat they had appealed for \u00a3100,000. The sum was absurd, and at once\nbrought upon us from all sides the charge of developing professionalism.\nMy position was very difficult. If I protested now it would go far to ruin\nthe appeal. After all it might succeed. I could only fall into line with the 20\nothers and do my best for the sake of the cause to defend a policy which I\nlooked upon as mistaken. We actually collected about \u00a37,000, and finally,\nas we found that the general feeling was either hostile or apathetic, we\nhanded over this sum to the Olympic Committee. Then came the war,\nand so in any case our labour was in vain, for the Games were to be in 25\nBerlin in 1916. We were all playing another game by then. This matter\nwas spread over a year of my life and was the most barren thing that I ever\ntouched, for nothing came of it, and I cannot trace that I ever received\none word of thanks from any human being. I was on my guard against\nNorthcliffe telegrams after that. 30\nI remember one curious episode about that time. I was staying in\na Northumberland Avenue Hotel, and I walked out at night in pensive\nmood, strolling down the Embankment and watching the great dark river\nwith the gleam of the lights upon it. Suddenly a man passed me, walking\nvery rapidly and muttering in an incoherent way. He gave me an impres- 35\nsion of desperation and I quickened my pace and followed him. With\na rush he sprang up on the parapet and seemed to be about to throw\nhimself into the river. I was just in time to catch his knees and to pull him\n201 the years between the wars (contd.)\ndown. He struggled hard to get up, but I put my arm through his and led\nhim across the road. There I reasoned with him and examined into the\ncause of his troubles. He had had some domestic quarrel, I believe, but\nhis main worry was his business, which was that of a baker. He seemed\n5 a respectable man and the case seemed genuine, so I calmed him down,\ngave him such immediate help as I could, and made him promise to re-\nturn home and to keep in touch with me afterwards.\nWhen the excitement of the incident was over, I had grave doubts as\nto whether I had not been the victim of a clever swindler. I was consid-\n10 erably relieved, therefore, to get a letter a few days later, giving name and\naddress, and obviously genuine. I lost sight of the case after that.\nAnother matter which preoccupied me much in the years before the\nwar, and preoccupies me still, is the Reform of our Divorce Laws. I was\npresident of the Reform Union for ten years and vacated the position in\n15 order to make room for a far more efficient successor in Lord Birken-\nhead. I am quite alive to all the arguments of our opponents, and quite\nunderstand that laxity in the marriage tie is an evil, but I cannot under-\nstand why England should lag behind every other Protestant country in\nthe world, and even behind Scotland, so that unions which are obviously\n20 disgusting and degrading are maintained in this country while they can\nbe dissolved in our Colonies or abroad. As to morality I cannot, I fear,\nadmit that our morality here is in the least better than in Scandinavia,\nHolland or Germany, where they have more rational laws. I think that\nin some States in America they have pushed Divorce to an extreme, but\n25 even in America I should say that married happiness and morality gener-\nally are quite as high as with us. The House of Lords has shown itself to\nbe more liberal in this matter than the Commons, possibly because the\nlatter have a fear of organized Church influence in their constituencies. It\nis one of several questions which makes me not sorry to see Labour, with\n30 its larger outlook, in power for a time in this country. Our marriage laws,\nour land laws, the cheapening of justice and many other things have long\ncalled out for reform, and if the old parties will not do it then we must\nseek some new one which will.\nDuring these long and happy years, when the smooth current of our\n35 national life was quietly sliding toward Niagara, I did not lose my inter-\nest in psychic matters, but I cannot say that I increased my grasp of the\nreligious or spiritual side of the subject. I read, however, and investigated\nwhenever the chance arose. A gentleman had arranged a series of physi-\n202 chapter 22\ncal s\u00e9ances in a large studio in North London, and I attended them, the\nmediums being Cecil Husk and Craddock. They left a very mixed im-\npression upon my mind, for in some cases, I was filled with suspicion\nand in others I was quite sure that the result was genuine. The possibility\nthat a genuine medium may be unscrupulous and that when these very 5\nelusive forces fail to act he may simulate them is one which greatly com-\nplicates the whole subject, but one can only concentrate upon what one\nis sure is true and try to draw conclusions from that. I remember that\nmany sheeted ghosts walked about in the dim light of a red lamp on these\noccasions, and that some of them came close to me, within a foot of my 10\nface, and illuminated their features by the light of a phosphorescent slate\nheld below them. One splendid Arab, whom the medium called Abdul-\nlah, came in this fashion. He had a face like an idealized W. G. Grace,\nswarthy, black-bearded and dignified, rather larger than human. I was\nlooking hard at this strange being, its nose a few inches from my own, 15\nand was wondering whether it could be some very clever bust of wax,\nwhen in an instant the mouth opened and a terrific yell was emitted. I\nnearly jumped out of my chair. I saw clearly the gleaming teeth and the\nred tongue. It certainly seemed that he had read my thought and had tak-\nen this very effective way of answering it. 20\nSome of the excitements of my life during these and the subsequent\nyears were due to financial entanglements which arose from a certain\nspeculative element in my own nature, depending rather upon the love of\nadventure than upon any hope of gain. If when I earned money I had dug\na hole in the garden and buried it there I should be a much richer man to- 25\nday. I can hardly blame the punter on the racecourse when I remember\nthe outside chances which I have taken in the past in every possible form\nof speculation. But I have the advantage over the mere gambler in this,\nthat every pound of my money went to develop something or other and\nlined the pocket of the working man, who, by the way, when he grumbles 30\nover the profits of the Capitalist never even alludes to his losses. If a bal-\nance sheet were struck it would be interesting to see what, if any, is the\nexact margin of profit.\nIt is true that sometimes I have indulged in a pure gamble but never\nfor any sum which would hurt me. I have painful memories of a guano 35\nisland off South Africa on which our treasure seekers were not even al-\nlowed to land, though every bird\u2019s nest was rumoured to contain a dia-\nmond. The Spanish galleon in the bay of Tobermory also took treasure\n203 the years between the wars (contd.)\nrather than gave it, and the return for my shares was a lump of glass and a\nrusted bar. That was more than ever I had from certain spots in Kalgurli\nand Coolgardie and other alleged goldbearers, which have nearly all been\ngold consumers so far as I am concerned. I fear some of those mines were\n5 like that legendary one where the manager, getting a cable which ordered\nhim to start crushing, replied, \u2018I have nothing to crush until you return\nsamples.\u2019\nI have played my involuntary part also in the development of the\nRand and Rhodesia, from those early and unsophisticated days when I\n10 misread the quotation and meaning to invest \u00a360 was faced next morn-\ning with a bill for \u00a3900. Occasionally it is true that I backed a winner, but\nas a rule I must confess that I was not judicious in my selections.\nBut it was at home that I expended myself most freely. I saw the\nenormous possibilities of Kent coal, which even now are not fully un-\n15 derstood; but I did not sufficiently weigh the impossibilities, which are\nthat an enterprise can be successful which is wildly financed and extrav-\nagantly handled. I and many others lost our money sinking the shafts\nwhich may bring fortunes to our successors. I even descended 1,000 feet\nthrough the chalk to see with my own eyes that the coal was in situ. It\n20 seems to have had the appearance and every other quality of coal save\nthat it was incombustible, and when a dinner was held by the sharehold-\ners which was to be cooked by local coal, it was necessary to send out\nand buy something which would burn. There were, however, lower strata\nwhich were more sensitive to heat. Besides Kent Coal I lost very heavily\n25 in running a manufacturing plant in Birmingham, into which I was led\nby those successive stages in which you are continually trying to save\nwhat you have already invested until the situation becomes so serious\nthat you drop it in terror. We turned from bicycles to munitions during\nthe war, and actually worked hard the whole four years, with a hundred\n30 artisans making needful war material, without ever declaring a penny\nof dividend. This, I should think, must be a record, and at least no one\ncould call us profiteers. The firm was eventually killed dead by the suc-\ncessive strikes of the moulders and the miners. It is amazing how one set\nof workmen will ruin another set without apparently any remonstrance\n35 from the sufferers. Another bad egg was a sculpture machine for architec-\ntural work, which really had great possibilities, but we could not get the\norders. I was chairman of this company, and it cost me two years of hard\nwork and anxiety, ending up by my paying the balance out of my own\n204 chapter 22\npocket, so that we might wind up in an honourable way. It was a dismal\nexperience with many side adventures attached to it, which would make\na sensational novel.\nSuch are some of the vicissitudes which cannot be disregarded in a\nretrospect of life, for they form a very integral and absorbing part of it. 5\nI have had my ill luck and I have had my good. Amid the latter I count\nthe fact that I have been for twenty-five years a director of Raphael Tuck\n& Co., without the least cloud to darken the long and pleasant memo-\nry. I have also been for many years chairman of Besson\u2019s famous brass\ninstrument firm. I think a man should know all sides of life, and he has 10\nmissed a very essential side if he has not played his part in commerce. In\ninvestments, too, I would not imply that I have always been unfortunate.\nMy speculative adventures are over, and I can at least say that unless the\nBritish Empire goes down I shall be able to retain enough for our modest\nneeds. 15\n205 Chapter 23\nSOME NOTABLE PEOPLE\n5 President Roosevelt \u2013 Lord Balfour \u2013 Mr. Asquith \u2013 Lord Haldane \u2013 George\nMeredith \u2013 Rudyard Kipling \u2013 James Barrie \u2013 Henry Irving \u2013 Bernard Shaw\n\u2013 R.L.S. \u2013 Grant Allen \u2013 James Payn \u2013 Henry Thompson \u2013 Royalty.\nWhen i have chanced during my life to come in contact with notable\n10 people, I have often made some short record at the time of what they said\nand how they impressed me. It is difficult, however, to use these notes for\npublication when you happen to have been a guest, and it can only be\ndone, I think, by using one\u2019s judgment and never consciously harming\none\u2019s host. If everyone were altogether silent upon such occasions the\n15 most pleasing side of great contemporaries would never be chronicled,\nfor the statesman in slippers is a very much more human and lovable per-\nson than the politician on the platform.\nAmong the great men that I have known President Roosevelt occu-\npied a prominent place. He was not a big, nor, so far as one could see, a\n20 powerful man, but he had tremendous dynamic force and an iron will\nwhich may account for his reputation as an athlete. He had all the sim-\nplicity of real greatness, speaking his mind with great frankness and in\nthe clearest possible English. He had in him a great deal of the boy, a mis-\nchievous, adventurous, high-spirited boy, with a deep, strong, thought-\n25 ful manhood in the background. We were present, my wife and I, at the\nGuildhall when he made his memorable speech about Egypt, in which\nhe informed a gathering, which contained the Foreign Secretary, Sir Ed-\nward Grey, and many of our Cabinet, that we should either rule more\nstrictly or clear out altogether. It was, of course, a most unwarrantable\n30 intrusion into our affairs, but it was a calculated indiscretion, and very\nwelcome, I believe, to those who were dealing with Egypt. As he made\nhis way through the dense crowd afterwards he passed me and said with\na grin: \u2018I say, I let them have it that time, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 There was the mischie-\nvous boy coming out.\n35 He had a quick blunt wit which showed itself often in his metaphors.\nHe spoke to me, I remember, of someone who had a nine guinea-pig-pow-\ner brain. One of his entourage told me how the President had been awak-\nened once to address some prairie folk at a wayside station. \u2018They have\n206 chapter 23\ncome sixty miles to see you,\u2019 said his secretary. \u2018They would have come a\nhundred to see a cat with two heads,\u2019 said the ruffled President.\nI met him once at a small luncheon party at the invitation of Lord\nLee, who had soldiered with him in Cuba. He was extremely talkative\n\u2013 in fact I can hardly remember anyone else saying anything. Thinking 5\nit over afterwards I concluded that two ideas were running through his\nmind, and every now and then coming to the surface. They were formi-\ndable ideas, and may have been some temporary wave of feeling, but they\nwere certainly in his thoughts. The one was that there would be another\ncivil war in the States. The second, that if you had the farmer class on 10\nyour side they presented the best military material. From this I gathered\nthat it was not a geographical but an economic struggle that was in his\nmind. Absit omen, but great men are often pessimists, and the Duke of\nWellington was deeply convinced that Britain could not long survive his\ndeath. 15\nWhen Roosevelt was shot I sent him a cable to express that sympathy\nwhich every Englishman felt. I have his answer before me, written only a\nday or so after the event:\nmercy hospital, 20\nchicago,\nOctober 19, 1912.\ndear mr. doyle, \u2013\n25\nMany thanks for your kind message of sympathy. As you know, a\nbullet wound is rather a serious thing, but all conditions seem to\nbe favourable, and I hope in a few days we will all be relieved from\nanxiety.\n30\nSincerely yours,\ntheodore roosevelt.\nIt is typewritten, but signed by his own hand. I do not think that a\nmore brave and detached letter was ever written by a sufferer. 35\nRoosevelt was a very loud hearty man, with a peculiar wild-beast\ntoothy grin, and an explosive habit of slapping his hand down for empha-\nsis. I jotted down a few of his obiter dicta after our conversation. He had\n207 some notable people\nno good word for Henry James. \u2018He is not a whole man. All that subtlety\nis really decadence.\u2019 He was very virile, not to say heroic in his views. \u2018A\nman should guard particularly against being led from his duty, especially\na dangerous duty, by his women. I guess a woman would have had a bad\n5 time if she had tried to lead Leonidas from the pass.\u2019 Of the German Em-\nperor he said that he was jealous of the King\u2019s dog at the King\u2019s funeral\nbecause he attracted the more notice. Altogether he was one of the raci-\nest talkers I have ever met.\nAmong the occasional great ones of earth whom I have met there is\n10 hardly anyone who stands out more clearly than Arthur Balfour, with\nhis willowy figure, his gentle intellectual face, and, as I read it, his soul of\nsteel. I should think that of all men of our day he was the last who would\nbe turned from any path which he had deliberately taken, but, on the\nother hand, he was capable of standing a most unconscionable time at\n15 the place where paths divide, for his mind was so subtle and active that\nhe would always see the two sides of every question and waver between\nthem. He could never have been a pioneer.\nThe occasion of our first meeting was a most ridiculous one. Old\nLord Burnham, the first of his line, had invited me down to his country\n20 house at Beaconsfield \u2013 a wonderful house which had been built origi-\nnally by Waller, the Royalist poet. Burke had lived close by, and the dag-\nger which, in a melodramatic moment, he threw upon the floor of the\nHouse, in order to show the dangers of French Republican propaganda,\nis still on exhibition. I can remember the party well, though nearly all\n25 of them are now on the farther side. I see Lady Dorothy Nevill with her\nmittened hands and her prim pussy-cat manner, retailing gossip about\nDisraeli\u2019s flirtations. Sir Henry James walks under the trees with bended\nhead, talking to the rising barrister who is destined as Lord Reading to be\nViceroy of India. The Duchess of Cleveland, mother of Lord Rosebery, is\n30 listening with her old face wreathed in smiles to Lady Dorothy\u2019s scandal.\nYoung Harry Irving looks unutterably bored as Lord Burnham explains\ngolf to him, bending his head over to get a glimpse of the ball round the\ncurve of his goodly waistcoat. Mr. Asquith stands smiling beside them.\nAs one looks back they seem all to have been shadows in a world of shad-\n35 ow.\nLord Burnham\u2019s hobby was Turkish baths, and he had an excellent\none in the front of the house, the drying room being the first door on the\nright as one entered, and being a simple sitting-room as far as appearance\n208 chapter 23\nwent. With his usual kind hospitality Lord Burnham had urged me to try\nhis bath, and having done so I was placed, arrayed in a long towel, and\nwith another towel screwed round my head, in the drying room. Pres-\nently the door opened, and entered Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister of\nEngland. He knew nothing of the house or its ways, and I can remember 5\nthe amazement with which he gazed at me. Lord Burnham following at\nhis heels introduced me, and I raised the towel on my head. There were\nno explanations, and I felt that he went away with the impression that\nthis was my usual costume.\nI did not see him after that week-end \u2013 he kept his room, I remember, 10\nuntil midday on the Sunday \u2013 until some years later when, after heavy\ndomestic loss, I was endeavouring to collect myself again in a little inn\nnear Dunbar. He heard of my presence, and in his kindness sent a car\nover from Whittingehame, only a few miles away, with a request that I\nshould come over for a couple of days. There was present his brother, 15\nGerald Balfour, a man with a beautifully refined face and manner, not un-\nlike that of Andrew Lang. His wife is the famous Lady Betty Balfour, the\ndaughter of Lord Lytton. When one thinks of that group of inter-allied\nfamilies \u2013 the Balfours, Cecils, Sedgwicks, and Lyttons \u2013 it seems a sort\nof nerve ganglion of British life. There was also Lady Frances Balfour, 20\nwho was a daughter of the Duke of Argyll, and not unlike him, as I can\nremember him. Her husband was Arthur Balfour\u2019s brother, an architect\nand antiquary, while another brother was Colonel of the London Scot-\ntish. Finally, there was Miss Alice Balfour, a very sweet and gently intel-\nlectual person, who was my actual hostess. 25\nI found Arthur Balfour in great spirits because he had just won a golf\nmedal at North Berwick. He seemed as pleased as any schoolboy, and his\nsister told me that no political success ever gave him the keen pleasure\nwhich he had from his golf victory. He was an average player, orthodox in\nstyle, and about 10 or 12 in handicap. He proved to be a charming host, 30\nfor he was a good listener, seeming to be really eager to hear your opin-\nion, laughed heartily at small provocation, and talked always very frankly\nand modestly of himself. After my long solitude I was more loquacious, I\nremember, than is my way, but he bore it with good humour.\nEvery night \u2013 or at least on the Sunday night \u2013 the whole staff of the 35\nlarge rambling establishment, maids and grooms, some twenty in all,\ncame in for prayers, which were read by the head of the house. It was\nfine to hear groom and statesman praying humbly together that they be\n209 some notable people\nforgiven the sins of the day, and merging all earthly distinctions in the\npresence of that which is above us all.\nHe was very interesting when he spoke of the outrage which the Rus-\nsian fleet had committed when, on their way to Japan, they opened fire at\n5 the British trawlers on the Dogger Bank. It was curious to hear his gentle\nvoice and to note his listless impersonal manner while he spoke in this\nfashion: \u201cI was very angry, really very angry about that affair. If our fleet\nhad been at home I should have been inclined to have stopped them in\nthe Straits. Of course, one would not do that unless one had overpow-\n10 ering force, so as to avoid bloodshed and save the Russian face. Their\nAmbassador called that morning and gave complete assurances, or really\nI should have had to do something. He got himself into trouble with his\nown Government, who felt that he had given away their case.\u201d\nI asked him how Cabinet Councils were worked. He said that they\n15 voted upon points and went by majorities, unless it was a vital thing,\nwhen of course the dissenters must resign.\nI observed in his character a very great horror of cowardice. Nothing\nseemed to arouse such scorn in him. He grew quite red, I remember, as\nhe spoke of Lord George Sackville, and recalled that though he had been\n20 broken and should have been shot at the Battle of Minden in 1759, he\nwas none the less Minister of War during the American campaign. He\nwas also, as I reminded him, a most debauched man; and the murder\nof his mistress, Miss Reay, the actress, by her true lover, the clergyman\nHackman, was one of the causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres of that century.\n25 I shall always carry away the memory of that visit \u2013 a bright gleam\nin a dark passage of life. I see very clearly the old house, the huge broken\ntree outside, inside which a State conspiracy was once hatched, the fine\nlibrary with its wealth of French memoirs, and above all the remarkable\nman who stood for so much in the life of the country. I was not at that\n30 time so convinced of the primary importance of psychic things as I be-\ncame later, and I regret it, as this would have been my one opportunity\nto explore a knowledge which at that time was certainly greater than my\nown. Years later, when the fight was heavy upon me, and when I was al-\nmost alone in the polemical arena, I wrote to Mr. Balfour, and charged\n35 him with sharing all my convictions and yet leaving me to defend them\nsingle-handed. His answer was: \u2018Surely my opinions upon this subject\nare already sufficiently well known,\u2019 which is surely an admission that\nI was right in my description of them, and yet was not much of a prop\n210 chapter 23\nto me in my time of need.\nI cast my mind back to other statesmen whom I have known, and\nMr. Asquith\u2019s kindly personality comes into my memory. I remember\nplaying a round of golf with him once \u2013 and a very bad player he was \u2013\nbut his conversation as we went round was plus four. He was a naturally 5\nsweet-natured man, but under that gentleness there lay judgment and\nfirmness, as was shown at the great crisis of history. He never said too\nmuch, but what he did say he lived up to. In conducting us safely through\nthose first two years of war he did that for which he has never had suffi-\ncient credit, and the more light we have had since, the more clear it has 10\nbeen that Lord Kitchener and he were really doing all that men could do,\nin munition work and all other ways. Because he had the solid Yorkshire\nstolidity, more nervous and excitable people thought that he did not take\nthe war sufficiently seriously, while the constant lies about the pro-Ger-\nman tendencies of his wife increased the evil impression. We owe him a 15\nreparation which is second only to that which is due to Lord Haldane.\nAnd that is indeed a heavy one. If one man could be named who was\nabsolutely indispensable to victory it was Haldane. He it was who built\nup the whole splendid weapon which flashed so swiftly from its sheath,\nand which Germany was so amazed to find directed at its breast as it 20\nrushed forward upon its furious course. He could not work miracles;\nhe could not introduce conscription when a candidate with such a pro-\ngramme would have been chased from the hustings; he could not prepare\nthe public mind in some dramatic way which would have precipitated\nthe very crash which there was still some chance of avoiding. But all we 25\nhad he gave us \u2013 the eight divisions which saved France, the Territorials\nwho carried on the good work until the new armies were ready, and the\nOfficers\u2019 Training Corps, which strengthened us where we should have\nbeen fatally weak. There has never been so foolish and ungrateful a clam-\nour as that which has been raised against Haldane. I remember that when 30\nhe took the chair for me in the first war lecture which I gave in London\nthere were cries of \u2018Traitor!\u2019 from people, chiefly women, among the au-\ndience. I had never seen Haldane before, and have never seen him since,\nso I have no personal bias in the matter, but I am proud that it was in my\nfirst volume of the History of the War, published in 1915, that I first put 35\nforward the unpopular view which will now be more fully accepted.\nWith George Meredith I had several interesting connections. I have\nthe greatest possible admiration for him at his best, while his worst is\n211 some notable people\nsuch a handicap that I think it will drag four-fifths of his work to oblivion.\nIf his own generation finds him hard to understand, what will our de-\nscendants make of him? He will be a cult among a few \u2013 a precious few in\nevery sense. And yet I fully recognize that his was the most active original\n5 brain and the most clever pen of any man, novelist or otherwise, of my\ntime. Knowing this well, it is strange that I can see so limited a future for\nhim. His subtle and intricate mind seemed unable to realize the position\nof the plain outsiders who represent the world. He could not see how his\nstained-glass might be less effective than the plain transparent substance\n10 as a medium for vision. The first requisite is to be intelligible. The second\nis to be interesting. The third is to be clever. Meredith enormously filled\nthe third, but he was unequal upon the other two. Hence he will never,\nin spite of the glories of Richard Feverel, be on an equality with Dickens\nor Thackeray, who filled all three. He had simply no idea how his words\n15 would strike a less complex mind. I remember that once in the presence\nof Barrie, Quiller-Couch and myself, he read out a poem which he had\ninscribed \u2018To the British Working-Man\u2019 in the Westminster Gazette. I\ndon\u2019t know what the British working-man made of it, but I am sure that\nwe three were greatly puzzled as to what it was about.\n20 I had written some articles on his work, which had been one of my\nyouthful cults, and that led to his inviting me to see him at his villa at Box\nHill \u2013 the first of several such visits. There had been a good deal in the\npapers about his health, so that I was surprised when, as I opened the gar-\nden gate, a slight but robust gentleman in a grey suit and a red tie swung\n25 out of the hall door and came singing loudly down the path. I suppose\nhe was getting on to seventy at the time but he looked younger, and his\nartistic face was good to the eye. Greeting me he pointed to a long steep\nhill behind the house and said: \u2018I have just been up to the top for a walk.\u2019\nI looked at the sharp slope and said: \u2018You must be in good trim to do it.\u2019\n30 He looked angry and said: \u2018That would be a proper compliment to pay to\nan octogenarian.\u2019 I was a little nettled by his touchiness, so I answered: \u2018I\nunderstood that I was talking to an invalid.\u2019 It really seemed as if my visit\nwould terminate at the garden gate, but presently he relented, and we\nsoon became quite friendly.\n35 He had in his youth been a judge of wine, and had still a reverence for\na good vintage, but unfortunately some nervous complaint from which\nhe suffered had caused the doctors to prohibit it absolutely. When lunch\ncame round he asked me with a very earnest air whether I could under-\n212 chapter 23\ntake to drink a whole bottle of Burgundy. I answered that I saw no in-\nsuperable difficulty. A dusty old bottle was tenderly carried up, which I\ndisposed of, Meredith taking a friendly interest in its dispatch. \u2018The fact\nis,\u2019 said he, \u2018I love my wine, and my little cellar was laid down with care\nand judgment, so that when some guest comes and drinks a glass and 5\nwastes the rest of the bottle it goes to my heart. It really did me good to\nsee you enjoy that one.\u2019 I need not say that I intimated that I was always\nprepared to oblige.\nHis conversation was extraordinarily vivid and dramatic, uttered in\na most vehement tone. It may have been artificial, and it may have been 10\nacting, but it was very arresting and entertaining. The talk got upon Na-\npoleon\u2019s Marshals, and you would have thought that he knew them inti-\nmately, and he did Murat\u2019s indignation at being told to charge au bout, as\nif he ever charged any other way, in a fashion which would have brought\ndown the house. Every now and then he brought out a Meredithian sen- 15\ntence which sounded comic when applied to domestic matters. When\nthe jelly swayed about as the maid put it on the table he said: \u2018The jelly,\nMary, is as treacherous as the Trojan Horse.\u2019 He laughed when I told him\nhow my groom, enlisted as a waiter for some special dinner, said, \u2018Hud-\ndup, there,\u2019 to the jelly under similar circumstances. 20\nAfter lunch we walked up a steep path to the little chalet or sum-\nmer-house where he used to write. He wished to read me a novel which\nhe had begun twenty years before, but which he had not had the heart to\ngo on with. I liked it greatly \u2013 and we roared with laughter at his descrip-\ntion of an old sea-dog who turned up the collar of his coat when he went 25\ninto action as if the bullets were rain. He said that my hearty enjoyment\nencouraged him to go on with it, and it has since appeared as The Amaz-\ning Marriage, but whether I really had anything to do with it I do not\nknow. I should be proud to think so.\nThe nervous complaint from which he suffered caused him to fall 30\ndown occasionally. As we walked up the narrow path to the chalet I heard\nhim fall behind me, but judged from the sound that it was a mere slither\nand could not have hurt him. Therefore I walked on as if I had heard\nnothing. He was a fiercely proud old man, and my instincts told me that\nhis humiliation in being helped up would be far greater than any relief I 35\ncould give him. It was certainly a nice point to decide.\nGeorge Meredith\u2019s religious convictions were very difficult to decide.\nHe certainly had no glimmering so far as I could see of any psychic ele-\n213 some notable people\nment in life, and I should imagine that on the whole he shared the opin-\nions of his friend, John Morley, which were completely negative. And yet\nI remember his assuring me that prayer was a very necessary thing, and\nthat one should never abandon prayer. \u2018Who rises from prayer a better\n5 man, his prayer is granted,\u2019 says the Aphorist in Richard Feverel. How far\nthese positions can be harmonized I do not know. I suppose that one\nmay say that God is unknown, and yet rear a mental temple to the un-\nknown God.\nRudyard Kipling I know far less than I should, considering how deep-\n10 ly I admire his writings, and that we live in the same county; but we are\nboth absorbed in work, and both much away from home, which may ex-\nplain it. I can well remember how eagerly I bought his first book, Plain\nTales from the Hills, in the old Southsea days, when buying a book was a\nrare strain upon my exchequer. I read it with delight, and realized not only\n15 that a new force had arisen in literature, but that a new method of story\nwriting had appeared which was very different from my own adherence\nto the careful plot artfully developed. This was go-as-you-please take-it-\nor-leave-it work, which glowed suddenly up into an incandescent phrase\nor paragraph, which was the more effective for its sudden advent. In form\n20 his stories were crude, and yet in effect \u2013 which, after all, is everything \u2013\nthey were superb. It showed me that methods could not be stereotyped,\nand that there was a more excellent way, even if it were beyond my reach.\nI loved the Barrack Room Ballads also, and such poems as \u2018The Bolivar,\u2019\n\u2018East and West,\u2019 and above all the badly named \u2018Envoi\u2019 became part of my\n25 very self. I always read the last one aloud to my little circle before we start\non any fresh expedition, because it contains the very essence of travel,\nromance, and high adventure.\nI saw Kipling most nearly in his very early days when he lived at Brat-\ntleboro\u2019, a little village in Vermont, in a chivalrous desire to keep his new-\n30 ly married wife in touch with her own circle. In 1894, as I have recorded,\nthere was a good deal of tail-twisting going on in the States, and Kipling\npulled a few feathers out of the Eagle\u2019s tail in retaliation, which caused\nmany screams of protest, for the American was far more sensitive to such\nthings than the case-hardened Briton. I say \u2018was,\u2019 for I think as a nation\n35 with an increased assurance of their own worth and strength they are\nnow more careless of criticism. The result at the time was to add oil to\nflames, and I, as a passionate believer in Anglo-American union, wrote to\nKipling to remonstrate. He received my protest very good-humouredly,\n214 chapter 23\nand it led to my visit to his country home. As a matter of fact, the concern\nshown in America, when the poet lay at death\u2019s door a few years later,\nshowed that the rancour was not very deep. Perhaps he was better known\nat that time in America than in England, for I remember sitting beside a\nbusman in London, who bowed his red face to my ear and said: \u2018Beg your 5\npardon, sir, but \u2019oo is this \u2019ere Kilpin?\u2019\nI had two great days in Vermont, and have a grateful remembrance of\nMrs. Kipling\u2019s hospitality. The poet read me \u2018McAndrew\u2019s Hymn,\u2019 which\nhe had just done, and surprised me by his dramatic power which ena-\nbled him to sustain the Glasgow accent throughout, so that the angular 10\nScottish greaser simply walked the room. I had brought up my golf clubs\nand gave him lessons in a field while the New England rustics watched us\nfrom afar, wondering what on earth we were at, for golf was unknown in\nAmerica at that time. We parted good friends, and the visit was an oasis\nin my rather dreary pilgrimage as a lecturer. 15\nMy glimpses of Kipling since then have been few and scattered, but I\nhad the pleasure several times of meeting his old father, a most delightful\nand lovable person, who told a story quite as well as his famous son. As\nthe mother was also a very remarkable woman, it is no wonder that he\ncarried such a cargo. 20\nJames Barrie is one of my oldest literary friends, and I knew him\nwithin a year or two of the time when we both came to London. He had\njust written his Window in Thrums, and I, like all the world, acclaimed it.\nWhen I was lecturing in Scotland in 1893 he invited me to Kirriemuir,\nwhen I stayed some days with his family \u2013 splendid types of the folk who 25\nhave made Scotland great. His father was a fine fellow, but his mother\nwas wonderful with a head and a heart \u2013 rare combinations \u2013 which\nmade me class her with my own mother. Kirriemuir could by no means\nunderstand Barrie\u2019s success, and looked upon their great son as an inex-\nplicable phenomenon. They were acutely aware, however, that tourists 30\nwere arriving from all parts to see the place on account of Barrie\u2019s books.\n\u2018I suppose you have read them,\u2019 I said to the wife of the local hotel man.\n\u2018Aye, I\u2019ve read them, and steep, steep, weary work it was,\u2019 said she. She\nhad some theory that it was a four-horse coach which her good man was\nrunning, and not the books at all which accounted for the boom. 35\nGreat as are Barrie\u2019s plays \u2013 and some of them I think are very great\n\u2013 I wish he had never written a line for the theatre. The glamour of it and\nthe \u2013 to him \u2013 easy success have diverted from literature the man with the\n215 some notable people\npurest style of his age. Plays are always ephemeral, however good, and are\nlimited to a few, but Barrie\u2019s unborn books might have been an eternal\nand a universal asset of British literature. He has the chaste clarity which\nis the great style, which has been debased by a generation of wretched\n5 critics who have always confused what is clear with what is shallow, and\nwhat is turbid with what is profound. If a man\u2019s thought is precise, his\nrendering of it is precise, and muddy thoughts make obscure paragraphs.\nIf I had to make my choice among modern stylists, I should pick Barrie\nfor the lighter forms of expression and our British Winston Churchill for\n10 the more classical.\nBarrie\u2019s great play \u2013 one of the finest in the language \u2013 is of course\nThe Admirable Crichton. I shall always hope that I had a hand in the fash-\nioning of it. I say this not in complaint but in satisfaction, for we all drop\nseeds into each other, and seldom know whence they come. We were\n15 walking together on the Heath at Kirriemuir when I said: \u2018I had a quaint\nthought in the night, Barrie. It was that a king was visiting India and was\nwrecked on the way on some island far from the track of ships. Only he\nand one rather handy sailor were saved. They settled down to spend their\nlives together. Of course the result would be that the sailor would be-\n20 come the king and the king the subject.\u2019 We chuckled over the idea, and\nwhen Crichton appeared, I seemed to see the fine plant which had grown\nfrom the tiny seed.\nBarrie and I had one unfortunate venture together, in which I may\nsay that the misfortune was chiefly mine, since I had really nothing to do\n25 with the matter, and yet shared all the trouble. However, I should have\nshared the honour and profit in case of success, so that I have no right to\ngrumble. The facts were that Barrie had promised Mr. D\u2019Oyly Carte that\nhe would provide the libretto of a light opera for the Savoy. This was in\nthe Gilbert days, when such a libretto was judged by a very high standard.\n30 It was an extraordinary commission for him to accept, and I have nev-\ner yet been able to understand why he did so, unless, like Alexander, he\nwanted fresh worlds to conquer. On this occasion, however, he met with\na disastrous repulse, and the opera, Jane Annie, to which I alluded in an\nearly chapter, was one of the few failures in his brilliant career.\n35 I was brought into the matter because Barrie\u2019s health failed on ac-\ncount of some family bereavement. I had an urgent telegram from him\nat Aldeburgh, and going there I found him very worried because he had\nbound himself by this contract, and he felt in his present state unable\n216 chapter 23\nto go forward with it. There were to be two acts, and he had written the\nfirst one, and had the rough scenario of the second, with the complete\nsequence of events \u2013 if one may call it a sequence. Would I come in with\nhim and help him to complete it as part author? Of course I was very\nhappy to serve him in any way. My heart sank, however, when, after giv- 5\ning the promise, I examined the work. The only literary gift which Barrie\nhas not got is the sense of poetic rhythm, and the instinct for what is\npermissible in verse. Ideas and wit were there in abundance. But the plot\nitself was not strong, though the dialogue and the situations also were\noccasionally excellent. I did my best and wrote the lyrics for the second 10\nact, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the predestined shape.\nThe result was not good. However, the actual comradeship of production\nwas very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly painful to\nus because it let down the producer and the cast. We were well abused by\nthe critics, but Barrie took it all in the bravest spirit. 15\nI find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from\nBarrie which is good reading.\nin account with j. m. barrie.\n20\nWhy.

How I collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is\ntold in my chapter on Sport.\nHenry Irving is one of the other great men whom I have met at close\n217 some notable people\nquarters, for his acting of Gregory Brewster brought us in contact. When\nhe was producing Coriolanus he came down to Hindhead and used to\ndrop in of an evening. He was fond of a glass of port \u2013 indeed, he was\none of the four great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the\n5 Hon. G. Russell to drink a bottle each night \u2013 being the only trait which\nthese great men had in common. The others, I remember, were Tenny-\nson, Gladstone and Moses Montefiore, and the last I believe was really\ntrue. Like all bad habits, it overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off\nat the age of 116.\n10 Irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and\nill-natured. I can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion\nfor heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. The unex-\npectedness of his remarks took one aback. I remember when my friend\nHamilton sat up with me into the \u2018wee sma\u2019 hours\u2019 with the famous man,\n15 he became rather didactic on the subject of the Deity or the Universe or\nsome other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at\ngreat length. Irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker\u2019s\nface, which encouraged Hamilton to go on and on. When at last he had\nfinished, Irving remarked: \u2018What a low comedian you would have made!\u2019\n20 He wound up his visit by giving me his copy of Coriolanus with all his\nnotes and stage directions \u2013 a very precious relic.\nMany visions of old times rise before my eyes as I write, but my book\nwould lose all proportion should I dwell upon them. I see Henley, the\nformidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who\n25 could only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. He was a great poet\nand critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of Marlowe of the\nmighty line and the pothouse fray. I see Haggard too, first as the young\nspruce diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange\nvague tendencies to mysticism. Shaw, too, I see with the pleasant silky\n30 voice and the biting phrase. It was strange that all the mild vegetables\nwhich formed his diet made him more pugnacious and, I must add, more\nuncharitable than the carnivorous man, so that I have known no literary\nman who was more ruthless to other people\u2019s feelings. And yet to meet\nhim was always to like him. He could not resist a bitter jest or the pervert-\n35 ed pleasure of taking up an unpopular attitude. As an example I remem-\nber Harry Irving telling me that when Shaw was invited to his father\u2019s\nfuneral he wrote in reply: \u2018If I were at Westminster Henry Irving would\nturn in his grave, just as Shakespeare would turn in his grave were Henry\n218 chapter 23\nIrving at Stratford.\u2019 I may not have it verbally exact, but that was near\nenough. It was the kind of outrageous thing that he would say. And yet\none can forgive him all when one reads the glorious dialogue of some of\nhis plays. He seems subhuman in emotion and superhuman in intellect.\nShaw was always a thorn in Irving\u2019s side, and was usually the one 5\njarring note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh pro-\nduction. At a first night \u2013 at the Lyceum \u2013 those wonderful first nights\nwhich have never been equalled \u2013 the lanky Irishman with his blood-\nless face, his red beard, and his sardonic expression must have been like\nthe death\u2019s-head at the banquet to Irving. Irving ascribed this animosity 10\nto Shaw\u2019s pique because his plays were not accepted, but in this I am\nsure that he did an injustice. It was simply that contrary twist in the man\nwhich makes him delight in opposing whatever anyone else approved.\nThere is nothing constructive in him, and he is bound to be in perpetual\nopposition. No one for example was stronger for peace and for non-mili- 15\ntarism than he, and I remember that when I took the chair at a meeting at\nHindhead to back up the Tsar\u2019s peace proposals at The Hague, I thought\nto myself as I spied Shaw in a corner of the room: \u2018Well, this time at any\nrate he must be in sympathy.\u2019 But far from being so he sprang to his feet\nand put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these proposals for 20\npeace would be disastrous. Do what you could he was always against you.\nPerhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continu-\nally stated, and the British stand that sort of thing better than other na-\ntions. Had Shaw said in America what he said in England about the war\nwhilst it was in progress he would have been in personal danger. There 25\nwere times, however, when his queer contrary impulses became perfect-\nly brutal in their working. One was at the time of the Titanic disaster,\nwhen he deliberately wrote a letter at a time when the wounds were raw,\noverwhelming everyone concerned with bitter criticism. I was moved to\nwrite a remonstrance, and we had a sharp debate in public, which did not 30\nin any way modify our kindly personal relations. I can recall a smaller but\neven more unjustifiable example of his sour nature when he was staying\nat Hindhead. A garden-party had been got up for some charity, and it\nincluded the woodland scenes of As You Like It, which were done by am-\nateurs, and very well done too. Shaw with no provocation wrote a whole 35\ncolumn of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors and their\nperformance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though\nindeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. One mentions these things\n219 some notable people\nas characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, I fear, that the\nadoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts\nor actions to an end. But with it all Shaw is a genial creature to meet, and\nI am prepared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature\n5 though it has not been presented to the public. It took a good man to\nwrite Saint Joan.\nWells, too, I have known long, and indeed I must have often entered\nthe draper\u2019s shop in which he was employed at Southsea, for the propri-\netor was a patient of mine. Wells is one of the great fruits which popular\n10 education has given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the\nheart of the people. His democratic frankness and complete absence of\nclass feeling are occasionally embarrassing. I remember his asking me\nonce if I had played cricket at Liphook. I said that I had. He said: \u2018Did\nyou notice an old fellow who acts as professional and ground-keeper?\u2019 I\n15 said that I had. \u2018That was my father,\u2019 said Wells. I was too much surprised\nto answer, and could only congratulate myself that I had made no un-\npleasant comments before I knew the identity of the old man.\nI have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the\nfuture in which Wells indulges. He has, it is true, made a couple of good\n20 shots which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine\nwhich would deliver news in our own houses. But he has never shown\nany perception of the true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his\nhistory of the world, elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to\nbe a body without a soul. However, this also may be given him, and it will\n25 make his equipment complete. I remember discussing the matter with\nhim, when George Gissing, Hornung, he and I foregathered in Rome\nearly in this century, but apparently my words had no effect.\nWillie Hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memo-\nries. He was a Dr. Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No\n30 one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never\nadequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his\nbrain. These things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat\nin the telling, but I remember how, when I showed him the record of\nsomeone who claimed to have done 100 yards under ten seconds, he\n35 said: \u2018It is a sprinter\u2019s error.\u2019 Golf he could not abide, for he said it was\n\u2018unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting ball.\u2019 His criticism upon my Sherlock\nHolmes was: \u2018Though he might be more humble, there is no police like\nHolmes.\u2019 I think I may claim that his famous character Raffles was a kind\n220 chapter 23\nof inversion of Sherlock Holmes, Bunny playing Watson. He admits as\nmuch in his kindly dedication. I think there are few finer examples of\nshort-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think\nthey are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put\npen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make 5\nthe criminal a hero.\nJerome, too, was an old friend. He was an adventurous soul, and at\none time started a four-in-hand. I remember sitting on the top of it, and\nwhen one of the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the\ndriver I thought it was time to get down. Maxwell also is an old friend. 10\nHe is, of course, the son of Miss Braddon, who married a publisher of\nthat name. I respect him for doing a man\u2019s work in the war when, though\nhe was fifty years of age, and had led a sedentary life, he volunteered for\na fighting battalion, a credit which he shares with A. E. W. Mason. Max-\nwell\u2019s work has always greatly appealed to me, and I have long looked 15\nupon him as the greatest novelist that we possess.\nI never met Robert Louis Stevenson in the flesh, though I owe so\nmuch to him in the literary spirit. Never can I forget the delight with\nwhich I read those early stories of his in the Cornhill, before I knew the\nname of the author. I still think that \u2018The Pavilion on the Links\u2019 is one 20\nof the great short stories of the world, though there were alterations in\nthe final form which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon\nthe part of the publishers. Stevenson\u2019s last year at Edinburgh University\nmust have just about coincided with my first one, and Barrie must also\nhave been in that grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. Strange to 25\nthink that I probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded\nportal.\nFrom his far-away home in Samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye\nupon literary matters in England, and I had most encouraging letters\nfrom him in 1893 and 1894. \u2018O frolic fellow-spookist\u2019 was his curious 30\nterm of personal salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared\nmy interest in psychic research but did not take it very seriously. I cannot\nguess how at that time he had detected it, though I was aware that he had\nhimself in early days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to\na spiritualist society in Edinburgh, which studied the remarkable medi- 35\numship of Duguid. His letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of\nmy work. \u2018I have a great talent for compliment,\u2019 he said, \u2018accompanied by\na hateful, even a diabolic, frankness.\u2019 He had been retailing some of my\n221 some notable people\nSherlock Holmes yarns to his native servants \u2013 I should not have thought\nthat he needed to draw upon anyone else \u2013 and he complained to me in\na comical letter of the difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt\nevery moment to explain what a railway was, what an engineer was, and\n5 so forth. He got the story across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, \u2018If\nyou could have seen the bright feverish eyes of Simite you would have\ntasted glory.\u2019 But he explained that the natives took everything literal-\nly, and that there was no such thing as an imaginary story for them. \u2018I,\nwho write this, have had the indiscretion to perpetrate a trifling piece\n10 of fiction, \u201cThe Bottle Imp\u201d. Parties who come up to visit my mansion,\nafter having admired the ceiling by Vanderputty and the tapestry by\nGobbling, manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves\nthem to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. They may be seen to shrug a\nbrown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the secret bursts\n15 from them: \u201cWhere is the bottle?\u201d\u2019 In another letter he said that as I had\nwritten of my first book in the Idler he also would do so. \u2018I could not hold\nback where the white plume of Conan Doyle waved in front of me.\u2019 So,\nat least, I may boast that it is to me that the world owes the little personal\nsketch about Treasure Island which appeared in that year. I cannot forget\n20 the shock that it was to me when driving down the Strand in a hansom\ncab in 1894 I saw upon a yellow evening poster \u2018Death of Stevenson.\u2019\nSomething seemed to have passed out of my world.\nI was asked by his executors to finish the novel St. Ives, which he had\nleft three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was\n25 done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It\nis a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man\u2019s story, and must\nbe a more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my\nneighbour at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much\nworried because there were two numbers of his serial, Hilda Wade, which\n30 was running in The Strand Magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure\nfor me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult\ncollar work, and I expect they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a\nstranger, who evidently confused Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife\nhad given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her\n35 Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight.\nI well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen\u2019s. He was an agnostic\nof a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an ami-\nable and benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death\n222 chapter 23\nmust have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of\nextreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued\nthe case with him, I from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view,\nbut I did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn\nmoment. Death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, 5\nare really vain things. His brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his\nmind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he im-\nparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which\nwas characteristic. I can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal\npain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the 10\nsheet, while he creaked out: \u2018Byzantine art, my dear Doyle, was of three\nperiods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the Ro-\nman Empire. The characteristics of the first period \u2013 \u2019 and so on, until he\nwould give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain\npassed before resuming his lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devot- 15\nedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the\nvery happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. One thinks,\nas a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson\u2019s impatient cry, \u2018I can hardly wait for death!\u2019\nGrant Allen\u2019s strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took\nin defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, 20\nwhich was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress\nball which we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all\nthe quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how\nmuch our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used\nto tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close 25\nfriends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife\nsaid to the husband: \u2018Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave\nthe room.\u2019 He had, I remember, very human relations with the maids who\ntook a keen interest in their employer\u2019s scientific experiments. On one\noccasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into 30\nthe drawing-room and cried: \u2018Oh, sir, Araminta has got a wasp.\u2019 Araminta\nwas the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time.\nGrant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was ag-\nile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On\nthe other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the hon- 35\nour with Samuel Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent\nshort story \u2018John Creedy,\u2019 where he combined science with fiction, with\nremarkable results.\n223 some notable people\nAt the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was\ncertainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had\nall departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were\nmemories. There was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The\n5 novelist was Mrs. Humphry Ward, who was just beginning her career\nwith Robert Elsmere, the first of that series of novels which will illuminate\nthe later Victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think\nit was Hodgkin who said, when he read Count Robert of Paris: \u2018Here have\nI been studying Byzantium all my life, and I never understood it until this\n10 blessed Scotch lawyer came along.\u2019 That is the special prerogative of im-\nagination. Trollope and Mrs. Ward have the whole Victorian civilization\ndissected and preserved.\nThen there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant.\nThere was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally\n15 there was James Payn.\nPayn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather\nmechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his\n\u2018Literary Reminiscences,\u2019 and especially his \u2018Backwater of Life.\u2019\nHe had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a com-\n20 pensation to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays\nhe would have rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days,\nwhen he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with\nrheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely\npessimistic as to his own fate. \u2018Don\u2019t make any mistake, Doyle, death is\n25 a horrible thing \u2013 horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!\u2019 But five\nminutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his\nown high treble laugh would be the loudest of all.\nHis own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember\nhow he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and\n30 how they carried him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the\nfir-woods through which he passed. \u2018I thought it was my funeral, and that\nthey had done me well in the matter of plumes.\u2019 When he told a story he\nwas so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the\nend out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. An American had called\n35 upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon Assyrian tablets.\n\u2018I thought they were something to eat,\u2019 he screamed. He was an excellent\nwhist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send three members to his\nhouse on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his\n224 chapter 23\ngame. This game was very scientific. He would tell with delight how he\nasked some novice: \u2018Do you play the penultimate?\u2019 To which the novice\nanswered: \u2018No \u2013 but my brother plays the American organ.\u2019\nMany of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was\na human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It 5\nwas of him that the story was told that an author handed one of his letters\nto a chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned\nwith a bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man\nwho received an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free\npass upon the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a 10\nvery real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted\nor rejected one\u2019s story. There was one letter in which I could only read the\nwords \u2018infringement of copyright.\u2019 He was very funny when he described\nthe work of the robust younger school. \u2018I have received a story from Mor-\nley Roberts,\u2019 he said, \u20185,000 words, mostly damns.\u2019 15\nI knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was\nfrequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at\nwhich eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They\nalways seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfish-\nness, for Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the 20\nmost simple viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of\nburgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from the enjoyment of oth-\ners. He had been a wonderful viveur and judge of what was what, and I\nfear that I disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the con-\nversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument 25\nwas interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a\nWestphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in\nwine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. But it\nwas part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize\nexactly what it was that was set before them. I have never heard more in- 30\nteresting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though\nladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from\nthe quality of the talk. Few men are ever absolutely natural when there\nare women in the room.\nThere was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the 35\nseries, which was particularly interesting as the Prince of Wales, now\nGeorge V, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of\nthe voyage round the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest\n225 some notable people\nof the company I can only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir\nCrichton Browne. Twenty years later I met the King when he visited a\ntrade exhibition, and I attended as one of the directors of Tuck\u2019s famous\npostcard firm. He at once said: \u2018Why, I have not seen you since that pleas-\n5 ant dinner when you sat next to me at Sir Henry Thompson\u2019s.\u2019 It seemed\nto me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory.\nI have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My\nlife has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from\nmy beaten path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the\n10 one occasion when I was privileged to entertain \u2013 or to attempt to enter-\ntain \u2013 the present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited\nby the courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine\nStanley daughter of Lady St. Helier, I could remember since her girl-\nhood. Upon this occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner,\n15 the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside\nher own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who\nwere to be introduced to her. I was led up in due course, made my bow,\nand sat down at her request. I confess that I found it heavy going at first,\nfor I had heard somewhere that Royalty has to make the first remark, and\n20 had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that I should\nnot have known where to begin. However she was very pleasant and\ngracious and began asking me some questions about my works which\nbrought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so interested in our\ntalk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was led up, and\n25 I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair.\nThere was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had\nbeen asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of In-\ndia, had been unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there\nwas a moment\u2019s hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon\n30 and I were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement\nfrom the lady we filed through. I thought nothing of the incident but\nsome great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great\nexcitement. \u2018Do you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018that you have established a precedent\nand solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette\n35 that has ever caused ill-feeling in British Society? The Lord Chancellor\nand the College of Heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have\ngiven them a definite lead. There has never been so vexed a question as\nwhether a Vicereine when she is away from the country where she repre-\n226 chapter 23\nsents royalty shall take precedence over a Duchess. There was a Duchess\nin the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for\never.\u2019 So who shall say that I have done nothing in my life?\nOf the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to\ntime I think that Sir Henry Hawkins \u2013 then become Lord Brampton \u2013 5\nmade the most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering\nat Cliveden, when Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner,\nbefore the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-\njudge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and\nwas wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. 10\nHis appearance was so jovial that I remarked to the lady upon my left: \u2018It\nis curious to notice the appearance of our vis-\u00e0-vis and to contrast it with\nhis reputation,\u2019 alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. She\nseemed rather puzzled by my remark, so I added: \u2018Of course you know\nwho he is.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018his name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels.\u2019 15\nI was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that I\nwas amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list\nof guests. I put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we\ngot to know each other.\nHawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one 20\nnever knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was cer-\ntainly Hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case,\nand did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned\nto death. Sir Edward Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this oc-\ncasion that he gave notice when Hawkins retired from the bench that 25\nif there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So\nthey were dropped.\nI might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story\nwhich he told me with his own lips. A prisoner had a pet mouse. One\nday the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. The prisoner caught 30\nup his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the\nknife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. Hawkins as judge want-\ned to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the\nlaw equally clear. What was he to do? In his charge to the jury he said:\n\u2018If a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, 35\nit becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. If, for example, a man in\nLondon discharged a pistol to hurt a man in Edinburgh, we could only\nlaugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs an iron-plated door\n227 some notable people\nwhile another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.\u2019\nThe jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought\nin a verdict of \u2018Not guilty.\u2019\nAnother distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impres-\n5 sion upon my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I\nattended several of Lady Jeune\u2019s famous luncheon parties, which were\nquite one of the outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone\u2019s\nbreakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted\nto this lady for very many kind actions. Her husband always impressed\n10 me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. He told me that\nif every copy of Horace were destroyed he thought that he could recon-\nstruct most of it from memory. He presided over the Divorce Courts,\nand I remember upon one occasion I said to him: \u2018You must have a very\nlow opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of it is\n15 for ever presented towards you.\u2019 \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said he very earnestly,\n\u2018my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion of\nhumanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much dispo-\nsition upon the part of everyone to make the best of a bad business that\nit is extremely edifying.\u2019 This view seemed to me to be worth recording.\n228 Chapter 24\nSOME RECOLLECTIONS OF SPORT\nRacing \u2013 Shooting \u2013 A Fish Story \u2013 Boxing \u2013 Past and Present \u2013 Carpentier 5\nand France \u2013 The Reno Fight \u2013 Football \u2013 Golf with the Sirdar \u2013 Billiards \u2013\nCricket \u2013 W.

It\nmay best be fitted in at this spot as my sporting life one way and another\nmay be said to have reached its modest zenith about that time.\nAs one grows old one looks back at one\u2019s career in sport as a thing\ncompleted. Yet I have at least held on to it as long as I could, for I played 20\na hard match of Association football at forty-four, and I played cricket for\nten years more. I have never specialized, and have therefore been a sec-\nond-rater in all things. I have made up for it by being an all-rounder, and\nhave had, I daresay, as much fun out of sport as many an adept. It would\nbe odd if a man could try as many games as I for so many years without 25\nhaving some interesting experiences or forming a few opinions which\nwould bear recording and discussion.\nAnd first of all let me \u2018damn the sins I have no mind to\u2019 by record-\ning what most of my friends will regard as limitation. I never could look\nupon flat-racing as a true sport. Sport is what a man does, not what a 30\nhorse does. Skill and judgment are shown, no doubt, by the professional\njockeys, but I think it may be argued that in nine cases out of ten the\nbest horse wins, and would have equally won, could his head be kept\nstraight, had there been a dummy on his back. But making every allow-\nance, on the one side, for what human qualities may be called forth, and 35\nfor any improvement of the breed of horses (though I am told that the\nsame pains in other directions would produce infinitely more fruitful\nand generally useful results), and putting on the other side the demor-\n229 some recollections of sport\nalization from betting, the rascality among some book-makers, and the\ncollection of undesirable characters brought together by a race meeting,\nI cannot avoid the conclusion that the harm greatly outweighs the good\nfrom a broadly national point of view. Yet I recognize, of course, that it\n5 is an amusement which lies so deeply in human nature \u2013 the oldest, per-\nhaps, of all amusements which have come down to us \u2013 that it must have\nits place in our system until the time may come when it will be gradually\nmodified, developing, perhaps, some purifying change, as prize-fighting\ndid when it turned to contests with the gloves.\n10 I have purposely said \u2018flat-racing,\u2019 because I think a stronger case, though\nnot, perhaps, an entirely sound one, could be made out for steeplechasing.\nEliminate the mob and the money, and then, surely, among feats of hu-\nman skill and hardihood there are not many to match that of the winner\nof a really stiff point-to-point, while the man who rides at the huge barri-\n15 ers of the Grand National has a heart for anything. As in the old days of\nthe ring, it is not the men nor the sport, but it is the followers who cast a\nshadow on the business. Go down to Waterloo and meet any returning\nrace train, if you doubt it.\nIf I have alienated half my readers by my critical attitude to the Turf,\n20 I shall probably offend the other half by stating that I cannot persuade\nmyself that we are justified in taking life as a pleasure. To shoot for the\npot must be right, since man must feed, and to kill creatures which live\nupon others (the hunting of foxes, for example) must also be right, since\nto slay one is to save many; but the rearing of birds in order to kill them,\n25 and the shooting of such sensitive and inoffensive animals as hares and\ndeer, cannot, I think, be justified. I must admit that I shot a good deal\nbefore I came to this conclusion. Perhaps the fact, while it prevents my\nassuming any airs of virtue, will give my opinion greater weight, since\ngood shooting is still within my reach, and I know nothing more exhil-\n30 arating than to wait on the borders of an autumn-tinted wood, to hear\nthe crackling advance of beaters, to mark the sudden whirr and the yell\nof \u2018Mark over,\u2019 and then, over the topmost branches, to see a noble cock\npheasant whizzing down wind at a pace which pitches him a 100 yards\nbehind you when you have dropped him. But when your moment of ex-\n35 ultation is over, and you note what a beautiful creature he is and how one\ninstant of your pleasure has wrecked him, you feel that you had better\nthink no longer if you mean to slip two more cartridges into your gun\nand stand by for another. Worse still is it when you hear the child-like\n230 chapter 24\nwail of the wounded hare. I should think that there are few sportsmen\nwho have not felt a disgust at their own handiwork when they have heard\nit. So, too, when you see the pheasant fly on with his legs showing be-\nneath him as sign that he is hard hit. He drops into the thick woods and\nis lost to sight. Perhaps it is as well for your peace of mind that he should 5\nbe lost to thought also.\nOf course, one is met always by the perfectly valid argument that the\ncreatures would not live at all if it were not for the purposes of sport,\nand that it is presumably better from their point of view that they should\neventually meet a violent death than that they should never have existed. 10\nNo doubt this is true. But there is another side of the question as to the\neffect of the sport upon ourselves \u2013 whether it does not blunt our own\nbetter feelings, harden our sympathies, brutalize our natures. A coward\ncan do it as well as a brave man; a weakling can do it as well as a strong\nman. There is no ultimate good from it. Have we a moral right then, to kill 15\ncreatures for amusement? I know many of the best and most kind-heart-\ned men who do it, but still I feel that in a more advanced age it will no\nlonger be possible.\nAnd yet I am aware of my own inconsistency when I say I am in sym-\npathy with fishing, and would gladly have a little if I knew where to get 20\nit. And yet, is it wholly inconsistent? Is a cold-blooded creature of low\norganization like a fish to be regarded in the same way as the hare which\ncries out in front of the beagles, or the deer which may carry the rifle bul-\nlet away in its side? If there is any cruelty it is surely of a much less degree.\nBesides, is it not the sweet solitude of Nature, the romantic quest, rather 25\nthan the actual capture which appeals to the fisherman? One thinks of\nthe stories of trout and salmon which have taken another fly within a\nfew minutes of having broken away from a former one, and one feels that\ntheir sense of pain must be very different from our own.\nI once had the best of an exchange of fishing stories, which does not 30\nsound like a testimonial to my veracity. It was in a Birmingham inn, and\na commercial traveller was boasting of his successes. I ventured to back\nthe weight of the last three fish which I had been concerned in catching\nagainst any day\u2019s take of his lifetime. He closed with the bet and quot-\ned some large haul, 100 lbs. or more. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 he asked triumphantly, 35\n\u2018what was the weight of your three fish?\u2019 \u2018Just over 200 tons,\u2019 I answered.\n\u2018Whales?\u2019 \u2018Yes, three Greenland whales.\u2019 \u2018I give you best,\u2019 he cried; but\nwhether as a fisherman, or as a teller of fish stories, I am not sure. As a\n231 some recollections of sport\nmatter of fact, I had only returned that year from the Arctic seas, and the\nthree fish in question were, in truth, the last which I had helped to catch.\nMy experiences during my Arctic voyage both with whales and bears\nI have already touched upon, so I will not refer to them again, though it\n5 was the greatest period of sport which has ever come my way.\nI have always been keen upon the noble old English sport of boxing,\nand, though of no particular class myself, I suppose I might describe my\nform as that of a fair average amateur. As I was just over six feet high\nand was forty-three round the chest, weighing over sixteen stone in the\n10 buff, I was well qualified for the heavy-weight division, and I came of that\nbrown-haired, grey-eyed stock which George Borrow declares to be apt\nat the game. I should have been a better man had I taught less and learned\nmore, but after my first tuition I had few chances of professional teaching.\nHowever, I have done a good deal of mixed boxing among many different\n15 types of men, and had as much pleasure from it as from any form of sport.\nIt stood me in good stead aboard the whaler. On the very first evening I\nhad a strenuous bout with the steward, who was an excellent sportsman.\nI heard him afterwards, through the partition of the cabin, declare that I\nwas \u2018the best sur-r-r-geon we\u2019ve had, Colin \u2013 he\u2019s blacked my ee.\u2019 It struck\n20 me as a singular test of my medical ability, but I daresay it did no harm.\nI remember when I was a medical practitioner going down to exam-\nine a man\u2019s life for insurance in a little Sussex village. He was the gen-\ntleman farmer of the place, and a most sporting and jovial soul. It was\na Saturday, and I enjoyed his hospitality that evening, staying over till\n25 Monday. After breakfast it chanced that several neighbours dropped in,\none of whom, an athletic young farmer, was fond of the gloves. Conver-\nsation soon brought out the fact that I had a weakness in the same direc-\ntion. The result was obvious. Two pairs of gloves were hunted from some\ncupboard, and in a few minutes we were hard at it, playing light at first\n30 and letting out as we warmed. It was soon clear that there was no room\ninside a house for two heavy-weights, so we adjourned to the front lawn.\nThe main road ran across the end of it, with a low wall of just the right\nheight to allow the village to rest its elbows on it and enjoy the spectacle.\nWe fought several very brisk rounds, with no particular advantage either\n35 way, but the contest always stands out in my memory for its queer sur-\nroundings and the old English picture in which it was set. It is one of sev-\neral curious bye-battles in my career. I recollect another where another\nman and I, returning from a ball at five of a summer morning, went into\n232 chapter 24\nhis room and fought in our dress clothes several very vigorous rounds as\na wind-up to the evening\u2019s exercise. I have often wondered how my laun-\ndry woman accounted for the blood-stains on the shirt.\nThey say that every form of knowledge comes useful sooner or later.\nCertainly my own experience in boxing and my very large acquaintance 5\nwith the history of the prize-ring found their scope when I wrote Rodney\nStone. No one but a fighting man would ever, I think, quite understand\nor appreciate some of the detail. A friend of mine read the scene where\nBoy Jim fights Berks to a prize-fighter as he lay in what proved to be his\nlast illness. The man listened with growing animation until the reader 10\ncame to the point where the second advises Boy Jim, in technical jargon,\nhow to get at his awkward antagonist. \u2018That\u2019s it! By God, he\u2019s got him!\u2019\nshouted the man in the bed. It was an incident which gave me pleasure\nwhen I heard it.\nI have never concealed my opinion that the old prize-ring was an 15\nexcellent thing from a national point of view \u2013 exactly as glove-fighting\nis now. Better that our sports should be a little too rough than that we\nshould run a risk of effeminacy. But the ring outlasted its time. It was ru-\nined by the villainous mobs who cared nothing for the chivalry of sport\nor the traditions of British fair play as compared with the money gain 20\nwhich the contest might bring. Their blackguardism drove out the good\nmen \u2013 the men who really did uphold the ancient standards, and so the\nwhole institution passed into rottenness and decay. But now the glove\ncontests carried on under the discipline of the National Sporting or oth-\ner clubs perpetuate the noble old sport without a possibility of the more 25\nevil elements creeping into it once more. An exhibition of hardihood\nwithout brutality, of good-humoured courage without savagery, of skill\nwithout trickery, is, I think, the very highest which sport can give. People\nmay smile at the mittens, but a twenty-round contest with four-ounce\ngloves is quite as punishing an ordeal as one could wish to endure. There 30\nis as little room for a coward as in the rougher days of old, and the stand-\nard of endurance is probably as high as in the average prize-fight.\nOne wonders how our champions of today would have fared at the\nhands of the heroes of the past. I know something of this end of the ques-\ntion, for I have seen nearly all the great boxers of my time, from J. L. Sulli- 35\nvan down to Tommy Burns, Carpentier, Bombardier Wells, Beckett and\nthat little miracle Jimmy Wilde. But how about the other end \u2013 the men\nof old? Wonderful Jem Mace was the only link between them. On the one\n233 some recollections of sport\nhand, he was supreme in the \u2019sixties as a knuckle-fighter; on the other, he\ngave the great impetus to glove-fighting in America, and more especial-\nly in Australia, which has brought over such champions as Frank Slavin\nand Fitzsimmons, who, through Mace\u2019s teaching, derive straight from\n5 the classic line of British boxers. He of all men might have drawn a just\ncomparison between the old and the new. But even his skill and experi-\nence might be at fault, for it is notorious that many of the greatest fighters\nunder the old r\u00e9gime were poor hands with the mittens. Men could bang\npoor Tom Sayers all round the ring with the gloves, who would not have\n10 dared to get over the ropes had he been without them. I have seen Mace\nbox, and even when over sixty it is wonderful how straight was his left,\nhow quick his feet, and how impregnable his guard.\nAfter the Great War, one can see that those of us who worked for the\nrevival of boxing wrought better than we knew, for at the supreme test\n15 of all time \u2013 the test which has settled the history of the future \u2013 it has\nplayed a marked part. I do not mean that a man used his fists in the war,\nbut I mean \u2013 and every experienced instructor will, I am sure, endorse\nit \u2013 that the combative spirit and aggressive quickness gave us the attack-\ning fire and helped especially in bayonet work. But it was to our allies of\n20 France that the chief advantage came. I believe that Carpentier, the box-\ner, did more to win the war for France than any other man save the actual\ngenerals or politicians. The public proof that a Frenchman could be at\nthe very head of his class, as Ledoux was also at a lighter weight, gives\na physical self-respect to a nation which tinges the spirit of every single\n25 member of it. It was a great day for France when English sports, boxing,\nRugby football and others came across to them, and when a young man\u2019s\nideal ceased to be amatory adventure with an occasional duel. England\nhas taught Europe much, but nothing of more value than this.\nTo return to my own small experiences of the game, I might have had\n30 one very notable one, for I was asked to referee the great contest when\nthe champions of the white and black races fought for what may prove to\nbe almost the last time.\nMy first intimation was a cable followed by the following letter:\u2013\n35 new york,\nDecember 9, 1909.\nmy dear sir, \u2013\n234 chapter 24\nI hope you will pardon the liberty I took as a stranger in cabling to\nyou asking if you would act at the championship battle between\nJeffries and Johnson. The fact is that when the articles were signed\nrecently your name was suggested for referee, and Tex Rickard,\npromoter of the fight, was greatly interested, as were many others. 5\nI believe it will interest you to know that the opinion was unan-\nimous that you would do admirably in the position. In a voting\ncontest several persons sent in your name as their choice. Believe\nme among sporting men of the best class in America you have many\nstrong admirers; your splendid stories of the ring, and your avowed 10\nadmiration for the great sport of boxing have made you thousands\nof friends.\nIt was because of this extremely friendly feeling for you in America\nthat I took the liberty of cabling to you. I thank you for your reply. 15\nIt would indeed rejoice the hearts of the men in this country if you\nwere at the ring side when the great negro fighter meets the white\nman Jeffries for the world\u2019s championship.\n20\nI am, my dear Sir,\nYours sincerely,\nirving jefferson lewis,\nManaging Editor New York Morning Telegraph.\n25\nI was much inclined to accept this honourable invitation, though my\nfriends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor\nat the other. However, the distance and my engagements presented a fi-\nnal bar.\nIf boxing is the finest single man sport, I think that Rugby football is 30\nthe best collective one. Strength, courage, speed and resource are great\nqualities to include in a single game. I have always wished that it had\ncome more my way in life, but my football was ruined, as many a man\u2019s\nis, by the fact that at my old school they played a hybrid game peculiar\nto the place, with excellent points of its own, but unfitting the youngster 35\nfor any other. All these local freak games, wall games, Winchester games,\nand so on are national misfortunes, for while our youths are wasting their\nenergies upon them \u2013 those precious early energies which make the in-\n235 some recollections of sport\nstinctive players \u2013 the young South African or New Zealander is brought\nup on the real universal Rugby, and so comes over to pluck a few more\nlaurel leaves out of our depleted wreath. In Australia I have seen in Vic-\ntoria a hybrid, though excellent game of their own, but they have had\n5 the sense in other parts to fall into line, and are already taking the same\nhigh position which they hold in other branches of sport. I hope that our\nheadmasters will follow the same course.\nIn spite of my wretched training I played for a short time as a for-\nward in the Edinburgh University team, but my want of knowledge of\n10 the game was too heavy a handicap. Afterwards I took to Association,\nand played first goal and then back for Portsmouth, when that famous\nclub was an amateur organization. Even then we could put a very fair\nteam in the field, and were runners-up for the County Cup the last sea-\nson that I played. In the same season I was invited to play for the county.\n15 I was always too slow, however, to be a really good back, though I was a\nlong and safe kick. After a long hiatus I took up football again in South\nAfrica and organized a series of inter-hospital matches in Bloemfontein\nwhich helped to take our minds away from enteric. My old love treated\nme very scurvily, however, for I received a foul from a man\u2019s knee which\n20 buckled two of my ribs and brought my games to a close. I have played\noccasionally since, but there is no doubt that as a man grows older a brisk\ncharge shakes him up as it never did before. Let him turn to golf, and be\nthankful that there is still one splendid game which can never desert him.\nThere may be objections to the \u2018Royal and Ancient\u2019 \u2013 but a game which\n25 takes four miles of country for the playing must always have a majesty of\nits own.\nPersonally I was an enthusiastic, but a very inefficient golfer \u2013 a ten\nat my best, and at my worst outside the pale of all decent handicaps. But\nsurely it is a great testimony to the qualities of a game when a man can be\n30 both enthusiastic and inefficient. It is a proof at least that a man plays for\nthe game\u2019s sake and not for personal kudos. Golf is the coquette of games.\nIt always lures one on and always evades one. Ten years ago I thought I\nhad nearly got it. I hope so to-day. But my scoring cards will show, I fear,\nthat the coquette has not yet been caught. The elderly lover cannot hope\n35 to win her smile.\nI used in my early golfing days to practise on the very rudimentary\nlinks in front of the Mena Hotel, just under the Pyramids. It was a weird\ncourse, where, if you sliced your ball, you might find it bunkered in the\n236 chapter 24\ngrave of some Rameses or Thothmes of old. It was here, I believe, that\nthe cynical stranger, after watching my energetic but ineffectual game,\nremarked that he had always understood that there was a special tax for\nexcavating in Egypt. I have a pleasant recollection of Egyptian golf in a\nmatch played with the late Sirdar, then head of the Intelligence Depart- 5\nment. When my ball was teed I observed that his negro caddie pointed\ntwo fingers at it and spat, which meant, as I was given to understand, that\nhe cursed it for the rest of the game. Certainly I got into every hazard\nin the course, though I must admit that I have accomplished that when\nthere was no Central African curse upon me. Those were the days before 10\nthe reconquest of the Soudan, and I was told by Colonel Wingate \u2013 as he\nthen was \u2013 that his spies coming down from Omdurman not infrequent-\nly delivered their messages to him while carrying his golf clubs, to avoid\nthe attention of the Calipha\u2019s spies, who abounded in Cairo. On this\noccasion the Sirdar beat me well, but with a Christian caddie I turned 15\nthe tables on him at Dunbar, and now we have signed articles to play off\nthe rubber at Khartoum, no cursing allowed. When that first match was\nplayed we should as soon have thought of arranging to play golf in the\nmoon.\nEvery now and then I give up the game in disgust at my own incom- 20\npetence, but only to be lured on once more. Hunting in an old desk I\ncame upon an obituary which I had written for my game at some mo-\nment of special depression. It ran, \u2018Sacred to the memory of my golf. It\nwas never strong, being permanently afflicted with a deformed stance\nand an undeveloped swing. After long weakness cheerfully borne it fi- 25\nnally succumbed, and was buried in the eighteenth hole, regretted by nu-\nmerous caddies.\u2019 However it came out and about once more, none the\nworse for this premature interment.\nThere is said to be a considerable analogy between golf and billiards,\nso much so that success in the one generally leads to success in the oth- 30\ner. Personally, I have not found it so, for though I may claim, I suppose,\nto be above the average amateur at billiards, I am probably below him\nin golf. I have never quite attained the three-figure break, but I have so\noften topped the eighty, and even the ninety, that I have lived in constant\nhope. My friend, the late General Drayson, who was a great authority on 35\nthe game, used to recommend that every player should ascertain what he\ncalled his \u2018decimal,\u2019 by which he meant how many innings it took him,\nwhether scoring or not, to make 100. The number, of course, varies with\n237 some recollections of sport\nthe luck of the balls and the mood of the player; but, taken over a dozen\nor twenty games, it gives a fair average idea of the player\u2019s form, and a\nman by himself can in this way test his own powers. If, for example, a\nplayer could, on an average, score 100 in twenty innings then his average\n5 would be five, which is very fair amateur form. If a man finds his \u2018decimal\u2019\nrise as high as ten over a sequence of games, he may be sure that he can\nhold his own against most players that he is likely to meet. I daresay my\nown decimal when I was in practice would be from six to eight.\nI was never good enough for the big matches, and though I once went\n10 in for the Amateur championship it was not out of any illusions about my\ngame, but because I was specially asked to do so, as it was advisable to\nstrengthen the undoubted amateur element in the contest. By the luck\nof a bye, and by beating a player who was about my own form, I got into\nthe third round, when I ran across Mr. Evans, who eventually reached\n15 the final with my scalp as well as several others at his girdle. I made 650\nagainst his 1,000, which, as I was not helped by a bad fall from a motor\nbike a few days before, was as much as I could expect. Forty-two off the\nred was my best effort. Surely billiards is the king of all indoor games, and\nshould have some writer who would do for it in prose what John Nyren\n20 did for cricket. I have never seen any worthy appreciation of its infinite\nvarieties from the forcing losing hazard which goes roaring into a top\npocket with a clash upon the rail, to the feather stroke so delicate that it\nis only the quiver of reflected light upon the object ball which shows that\nit has indeed been struck. Greatest of all is the ball heavily loaded with\n25 side which drifts down the long cushion and then is sucked against every\napparent law into the pocket as though it were the centre of a whirlpool.\nMr. E. V. Lucas is one who could do it with discernment.\nI have one funny recollection of billiards, when I wandered into some\nsmall hotel in a south-coast watering place, and for want of something to\n30 do played the marker. He was a pompous person in a frock coat with a\nvery good opinion of his own game, which was really ruined by a habit\nhe had of jerking. I won the match, which was not difficult to do, and\nthen I thought it a kindness to point out to the man how he could im-\nprove his game. He took this badly, however, and hinted that he allowed\n35 gentlemen who played him to get the better of him. This in turn annoyed\nme, so I said: \u2018Look here. I will come in after dinner and you can show\nall you can do, and you shall have a sovereign if you win.\u2019 After dinner his\ngame was worse than ever, while I had amazing luck and made the 100\n238 chapter 24\nin about three shots. As I put on my coat and was leaving the room the\nqueer little fellow sidled up to me and said: \u2018I beg pardon, sir, but is your\nname Roberts?\u2019\nMy earliest recollection of cricket is not a particularly pleasant one.\nWhen I was a very small boy at a preparatory school I was one of a group 5\nof admirers who stood around watching a young cricketer who had just\nmade his name hitting big hits off the school bowlers. One of the big hits\nlanded on my knee-cap and the cricketer in his own famous arms carried\nme off to the school infirmary. The name, Tom Emmett, lingers in my\nmemory, though it was some years before I appreciated exactly what he 10\nstood for in the game. I think, like most boys, I would rather have been\nknocked down by a first-class cricketer than picked up by a second-rater.\nThat was the beginning of my acquaintance with a game which has on\nthe whole given me more pleasure during my life than any other branch\nof sport. I have ended by being its victim, for a fast bowler some years ago 15\nhappened to hit me twice in the same place under my left knee, which\nhas left a permanent weakness. I have had as long an innings as one could\nreasonably expect, and carry many pleasant friendships and recollections\naway with me.\nI was a keen cricketer as a boy, but in my student days was too occu- 20\npied to touch it. Then I took it up again, but my progress was interrupted\nby work and travel. I had some cause, therefore, to hold on to the game as\nI had lost so much of it in my youth. Finally, I fulfilled a secret ambition\nby getting into the fringe of first-class cricket, though rather, perhaps,\nthrough the good nature of others than my own merits. However, I can 25\ntruly say that in the last season when I played some first-class cricket,\nincluding matches against Kent, Derbyshire, and the London County,\nI had an average of thirty-two for those games, so I may claim to have\nearned my place. I was more useful, however, in an amateur team, for\nI was a fairly steady and reliable bowler, and I could generally earn my 30\nplace in that department, while with the M.C.C. the professional talent\nis usually so strong that the amateur who fails in batting and is not a par-\nticularly good field has no chance of atoning with the ball. Yet even with\nthe M.C.C. I have occasionally had a gleam of success. Such a one came\nsome years ago, when the team presented me with a little silver hat for 35\ngetting three consecutive clean-bowled wickets against the Gentlemen\nof Warwick. One of my victims explained his downfall by assuring me\nthat he had it thoroughly in his head that I was a left-handed bowler, and\n239 some recollections of sport\nwhen the ball came from my right hand he was too bewildered to stop it.\nThe reason is not so good as that of an artist who, when I had bowled him\nout, exclaimed: \u2018Who can play against a man who bowls in a crude pink\nshirt against an olive-green background?\u2019\n5 A bowler has many days when everything is against him, when a\nhard, smooth wicket takes all the spin and devil out of him, when he goes\nall round and over the wicket, when lofted balls refuse to come to hand,\nor, if they do come, refuse to stay. But, on the other hand, he has his rec-\nompense with many a stroke of good fortune. It was in such a moment\n10 that I had the good luck to get the wicket of W. G. Grace, the greatest of\nall cricketers.\nW. G. had his speedy revenge. There was nothing more childlike and\nbland than that slow, tossed-up bowling of his, and nothing more sub-\ntle and treacherous. He was always on the wicket or about it, never sent\n15 down a really loose ball, worked continually a few inches from the leg,\nand had a perfect command of length. It was the latter quality which was\nmy downfall. I had made some thirty or forty, and began to relax in the\ndeep respect with which I faced the Doctor\u2019s deliveries. I had driven him\nfor four, and jumped out at him again the next ball. Seeing my intention,\n20 as a good bowler does, he dropped his ball a foot or two shorter. I reached\nit with difficulty, but again I scored four. By this time I was very pleased\nwith myself, and could see no reason why every one of these delightful\nslows should not mean a four to me. Out I danced to reach the next one\non the half volley. It was tossed a little higher up in the air, which gave the\n25 delusion that it was coming right up to the bat, but as a matter of fact it\npitched well short of my reach, broke sharply across and Lilley, the wick-\net-keeper, had my bails off in a twinkling. One feels rather cheap when\none walks from the middle of the pitch to the pavilion, longing to kick\noneself for one\u2019s own foolishness all the way. I have only once felt smaller,\n30 and that was when I was bowled by A. P. Lucas, by the most singular ball\nthat I have ever received. He propelled it like a quoit into the air to a height\nof at least 30 feet, and it fell straight and true on to the top of the bails. I\nhave often wondered what a good batsman would have made of that ball.\nTo play it one would have needed to turn the blade of the bat straight up,\n35 and could hardly fail to give a chance. I tried to cut it off my stumps, with\nthe result that I knocked down my wicket and broke my bat, while the ball\nfell into the midst of this general chaos. I spent the rest of the day wonder-\ning gloomily what I ought to have done \u2013 and I am wondering yet.\n240 chapter 24\nI have had two unusual experiences upon Lord\u2019s ground. One was\nthat I got a century in the very first match that I played there. It was an\nunimportant game, it is true, but still the surprising fact remained. It was\na heavy day, and my bat, still encrusted with the classic mud, hangs as\na treasured relic in my hall. The other was less pleasant and even more 5\nsurprising. I was playing for the Club against Kent, and faced for the first\ntime Bradley, who was that year one of the fastest bowlers in England.\nHis first delivery I hardly saw, and it landed with a terrific thud upon my\nthigh. A little occasional pain is one of the chances of cricket, and one\ntakes it as cheerfully as one can, but on this occasion it suddenly became 10\nsharp to an unbearable degree. I clapped my hand to the spot, and found\nto my amazement that I was on fire. The ball had landed straight on a\nsmall tin vesta box in my trousers pocket, had splintered the box, and\nset the matches ablaze. It did not take me long to turn out my pocket\nand scatter the burning vestas over the grass. I should have thought this 15\nincident unique, but Alec Hearne, to whom I told it, assured me that he\nhad seen more than one accident of the kind. W. G. was greatly amused.\n\u2018Couldn\u2019t get you out \u2013 had to set you on fire!\u2019 he cried, in the high voice\nwhich seemed so queer from so big a body.\nThere are certain matches which stand out in one\u2019s memory for their 20\npeculiar surroundings. One was a match played against Cape de Verde\nat that island on the way to South Africa. There is an Atlantic telegraph\nstation there with a large staff, and they turn out an excellent eleven. I\nunderstand that they played each transport as it passed, and that they had\ndefeated all, including the Guards. We made up a very fair team, however, 25\nunder the captaincy of Lord Henry Scott, and after a hard fight we defeat-\ned the islanders. I don\u2019t know how many of our eleven left their bones in\nSouth Africa; three at least \u2013 Blasson, Douglas Forbes (who made our\ntop score), and young Maxwell Craig never returned. I remember one\neven more tragic match in which I played for the Incogniti against Alder- 30\nshot Division a few months before the African War. The regiments quar-\ntered there were those which afterwards saw the hardest service. Major\nRay, who made the top score, was killed at Magersfontein. Young Stanley,\nwho went in first with me, met his death in the Yeomanry. Taking the two\nteams right through, I am sure that half the men were killed or wounded 35\nwithin two years. How little we could have foreseen it that sunny summer\nday!\nIt is dangerous when an old cricketer begins to reminisce, because so\n241 some recollections of sport\nmuch comes back to his mind. He has but to smell the hot rubber of a\nbat handle to be flooded with memories. They are not always glorious. I\nremember three ladies coming to see me play against one of the Bedford\nschools. The boys politely applauded as I approached the wicket. A very\n5 small boy lobbed up the first ball which I played at. It went up into the\nair, and was caught at point by the very smallest boy I have ever seen\nin decent cricket. It seemed to me about a mile as I walked back from\nthe wicket to the pavilion. I don\u2019t think those three ladies ever recovered\ntheir confidence in my cricketing powers.\n10 As a set-off to this confession of failure let me add a small instance of\nsuccess, where by \u2018taking thought\u2019 I saved a minor international match.\nIt was at the Hague in 1892, and the game was a wandering British team\nagainst Holland. The Dutch were an excellent sporting lot, and had one\nremarkable bowler in Posthuma, a left-hander, who had so huge a break\n15 with his slow ball that it was not uncommon for him to pitch the ball\nright outside the matting on which we played and yet bring it on to the\nwicket. We won our various local matches without much difficulty, but\nwe were aware that we should have a stiff fight with United Holland, the\nmore so as Dutch hospitality was almost as dangerous to our play as\n20 Dutch cricket.\nSo it proved, and we were in the position that with four wickets in\nhand they had only fifteen runs to make with two batsmen well set. I had\nnot bowled during the tour, for as we were a scratch team, mostly from\nthe schoolmaster class, we did not know each other\u2019s capacity. Seeing,\n25 however, that things were getting desperate, I went the length of asking\nour skipper to give me a chance.\nI had observed that the batsmen had been very well taught by their\nEnglish professional, and that they all played in most orthodox fashion\nwith a perfectly straight bat. That was why I thought I might get them\n30 out. I brought every fielder round to the off, for I felt that they would not\nthink it correct to pull, and I tossed up good length balls about a foot on\nthe off side. It came off exactly as I expected. The pro. had not told them\nwhat to do with that particular sort of tosh, and the four men were all\ncaught for as many runs by mid-off or cover. The team in their exultation\n35 proceeded to carry me into the pavilion, but whether it was my sixteen\nstone or the heat of the weather, they tired of the job midway and let me\ndown with a crash which shook the breath out of me \u2013 so Holland was\navenged. I played against them again when they came to England, and\n242 chapter 24\nmade sixty-seven, but got no wickets, for they had mastered the off-side\ntheory.\nSome of my quaintest cricket reminiscences are in connection with\nJ. M. Barrie\u2019s team \u2013 the \u2018Allah-Akbarries,\u2019 or \u2018Lord help us\u2019 as we were\ncalled. We played in the old style, caring little about the game and a 5\ngood deal about a jolly time and pleasant scenery. Broadway, the coun-\ntry home of Mr. Navarro and his wife, formerly Mary Anderson, the fa-\nmous actress, was one of our favourite haunts, and for several years in\nsuccession we played the Artists there. Bernard Partridge, Barrie, A. E.\nW. Mason, Abbey the Academician, Blomfield the architect, Marriott 10\nWatson, Charles Whibley, and others of note took part, and there were\nmany whimsical happenings, which were good fun if they were not good\ncricket. I thought all record of our games had faded from human ken,\nbut lately a controversy was raised over Mr. Armstrong, the Australian\ncaptain, bowling the same man from opposite ends on consecutive overs. 15\nThis led to the following paragraph in a Birmingham paper, which, I may\nsay, entirely exaggerates my powers but is otherwise correct.\nBARRIE AND ARMSTRONG.\n20\n\u2018I am not surprised that in the matter of Mr. Armstrong\u2019s conduct\nin bowling two consecutive overs from different ends, no reference has\nbeen made to the important precedent which on a similar occasion Sir\nJames Barrie failed to establish (writes a correspondent of the Nation).\nThe occasion was his captaincy (at Broadway, in Worcestershire) of an 25\neleven of writers against a strong team of alleged artists. The circum-\nstances were these. One side had compiled seventy-two runs, chiefly, if\nnot wholly, contributed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\u2018The sun-worshippers had thereupon responded with an equal num-\nber of runs for the loss of all but their last wicket. The ninth wicket had 30\nfallen to the last ball of Sir Arthur\u2019s over, the other eight having suc-\ncumbed to the same performer, then in his prime. Actuated, apparently,\nby the belief that Sir Arthur was the only bowler of his side capable of\ntaking or reaching a wicket, even in Worcestershire, Sir James thereupon\nput him on at the opposite end. 35\n\u2018Before, however, he could take a practice ball, a shout was heard\nfrom the artists\u2019 pavilion, and the nine unengaged players were seen is-\nsuing from it to contest our captain\u2019s decision. After an exciting contest,\n243 some recollections of sport\nit was ultimately given in their favour, with the result that the first ball of\nthe new bowler was hit for two, assisted by overthrows, and the innings\nand match were won by the artists.\u2019\nOf Barrie\u2019s team I remember that it was printed at the bottom of our\n5 cards that the practice ground was in the National Observer Office. Mr.\nAbbey, the famous artist, usually captained against Barrie, and it was part\nof the agreement that each should have a full pitch to leg just to start his\nscore. I remember my horror when by mistake I bowled a straight first\nball to Abbey, and so broke the unwritten law as well as the wicket. Ab-\n10 bey knew nothing of the game, but Barrie was no novice. He bowled an\ninsidious left-hand good length ball coming from leg which was always\nlikely to get a wicket.\nTalking of bowling, I have twice performed the rare feat of getting all\nten wickets. Once it was against a London Club, and once I ran through\n15 the side of a Dragoon Regiment at Norwich. My best performance at\nLord\u2019s was seven wickets for fifty-one against Cambridgeshire in 1904.\nOf fencing my experience has been limited, and yet I have seen\nenough to realize what a splendid toughening exercise it is. I nearly had\nan ugly mishap when practising it. I had visited a medical man in South-\n20 sea who was an expert with the foils, and at his invitation had a bout with\nhim. I had put on the mask and glove, but was loath to have the trouble\nof fastening on the heavy chest plastron. He insisted, however, and his in-\nsistence saved me from an awkward wound, for, coming in heavily upon a\nthrust, his foil broke a few inches from the end, and the sharp point thus\n25 created went deeply into the pad which covered me. I learned a lesson\nthat day.\nOn the whole, considering the amount of varied sport which I have\ndone, I have come off very well as regards bodily injury. One finger bro-\nken at football, two at cricket (one after the other in the same season),\n30 the disablement of my knee \u2013 that almost exhausts it. Though a heavy\nman and quite an indifferent rider, I have never hurt myself in a fair selec-\ntion of falls in the hunting field and elsewhere. Once, as I have narrated,\nwhen I was down, the horse kicked me over the eye with his forefoot,\nbut I got off with a rather ragged wound, though it might have been very\n35 much more serious.\nIndeed, when it comes to escapes, I have had more than my share\nof luck. One of the worst was in a motor accident, when the car, which\nweighed over a ton, ran up a high bank, threw me out on a gravel drive\n244 chapter 24\nbelow, and then, turning over, fell upon the top of me. The steering wheel\nprojected slightly from the rest, and thus broke the impact and undoubt-\nedly saved my life, but it gave way under the strain, and the weight of the\ncar settled across my spine just below the neck, pinning my face down on\nthe gravel, and pressing with such terrific force as to make it impossible 5\nto utter a sound. I felt the weight getting heavier moment by moment,\nand wondered how long my vertebr\u00e6 could stand it. However, they did\nso long enough to enable a crowd to collect and the car to be levered off\nme. I should think there are few who can say that they have held up a ton\nweight across their spine and lived unparalyzed to talk about it. It is an 10\nacrobatic feat which I have no desire to repeat.\nThere is plenty of sport in driving one\u2019s own motor and meeting the\nhundred and one unexpected roadside adventures and difficulties which\nare continually arising. These were greater a few years ago, when motors\nwere themselves less solidly and accurately constructed, drivers were less 15\nskilled, and frightened horses were more in evidence. No invention of\nmodern civilization has done so much for developing a man\u2019s power of\nresource and judgment as the motor. To meet and overcome a sudden\nemergency is the best of human training, and if a man is his own driver\nand mechanician on a fairly long journey he can hardly fail to have some 20\nexperience of it.\nI well remember in the early days of motoring going up to Birming-\nham to take delivery of my new 12 horse-power Wolseley. I had invest-\ned in the sort of peaked yachting cap which was considered the correct\nbadge of the motorist in those days, but as I paced the platform of New 25\nStreet Station a woman removed any conceit I might have over my head-\ngear, by asking me peremptorily how the trains ran to Walsall. She took\nme for one of the officials. I got the car safely home, and no doubt it was\na good car as things went at that time, but the secret of safe brakes had\nnot yet been discovered, and my pair used to break as if they were glass. 30\nMore than once I have known what it is to steer a car when it is flying\nbackwards under no control down a winding hill. Looking back at those\ndays it seems to me that I was under the car nearly as much as on the top\nof it, for every repair had to be done from below. There were few acci-\ndents from smashing my differential, seizing my engines, and stripping 35\nmy gears, which I have not endured. It was a chain-driven car, and I can\nwell remember one absurd incident when the chain jumped the cogs and\nfell off. We were on a long slope of 3 miles and ran on with the engine\n245 some recollections of sport\nturned off quite unconscious of what had occurred. When we reached\nlevel ground the car naturally stopped, and we got out, opened the bon-\nnet, tested the electricity, and were utterly puzzled as to what was amiss,\nwhen a yokel in a cart arrived waving our motive power over his head. He\n5 had picked it up on the road.\nOur descendants will never realize the terror of the horses at this in-\nnovation, nor the absurd scenes which it caused. On one occasion I was\nmotoring down a narrow lane in Norfolk, with my mother in the open\ntonneau. Coming round a curve we came upon two carts, one behind\n10 the other. The leading horse, which had apparently never seen a motor\nbefore, propped his forelegs out, his ears shot forward, his eyes stared\nrigidly and then in a moment he whirled round, ran up the bank, and\ntried to escape behind his comrade. This he could have done but for the\ncart, which he also dragged up the bank. Horse and cart fell sideways on\n15 the other horse and cart, and there was such a mixture that you could\nnot disentangle it. The carts were full of turnips and these formed a top\ndressing over the interlaced shafts and the struggling horses. I sprang out\nand was trying to help the enraged farmer to get something right end\nup, when I glanced at my own car which was almost involved in the pile.\n20 There was my dear old mother sitting calmly knitting in the midst of all\nthe chaos. It was really like something in a dream.\nMy most remarkable motor car experience was when I drove my\nown 16 horse-power Dietrich-Lorraine in the International Road Com-\npetition organized by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1911. This affair is dis-\n25 cussed later, when I come to the preludes of war. I came away from it\nwith sinister forebodings. The impression left on my mind by the whole\nincident is shown by the fact that one of the first things I did when I got\nto London was to recommend a firm of which I am director to remove a\nlarge sum which it had lying in Berlin. I have no doubt that it would have\n30 continued to lie there and that we might have lost it. As to the contest\nitself it ended in a British victory, which was owing to the staunch way in\nwhich we helped each other when in difficulties, while the Germans were\nmore a crowd of individuals than a team. Their cars were excellent and\nso was their driving. My own little car did very well and only dropped\n35 marks at Sutton Bank in Yorkshire, that terrible hill, one in three at one\npoint, with a hair-pin bend. When we finally panted out our strength I\nput my light-weight chauffeur to the wheel, ran round, and fairly boosted\nher up from behind, but we were fined so many marks for my leaving the\n246 chapter 24\ndriving wheel. Not to get up would have meant three times the forfeit, so\nmy tactics were well justified.\nNo doubt the coming science of aviation will develop the same qual-\nities as motor driving to an even higher degree. It is a form of sport in\nwhich I have only aspirations and little experience. I had one balloon as- 5\ncent in which we covered some 25 miles and ascended 6,000 feet, which\nwas so delightful an expedition that I have always been eager for another\nand a longer one. A man has a natural trepidation the first time he leaves\nthe ground, but I remember that, as I stood by the basket with the gas-\nbag swinging about above me and the assistants clinging to the ropes, 10\nsomeone pointed out an elderly gentleman and said: \u2018That is the famous\nMr. So-and-So, the aeronaut.\u2019 I saw a venerable person and I asked how\nmany ascents he had made. \u2018About a thousand,\u2019 was the answer. No elo-\nquence or reasoning could have convinced me so completely that I might\nget into the basket with a cheerful mind, though I will admit that for the 15\nfirst minute or so one feels very strange, and keeps an uncommonly tight\ngrip of the side-ropes. This soon passes, however, and one is lost in the\nwonder of the prospect and the glorious feeling of freedom and detach-\nment. As in a ship, it is the moment of nearing land once more which is\nthe moment of danger \u2013 or, at least, of discomfort; but beyond a bump 20\nor two, we came to rest very quietly in the heart of a Kentish hop-field.\nI had one aeroplane excursion in rather early days, but the experience\nwas not entirely a pleasant one. Machines were under-engined in those\ndays and very much at the mercy of the wind. We went up at Hendon\n\u2013 May 25, 1911, the date \u2013 but the machine was a heavy bi-plane, and 25\nthough it went down wind like a swallow it was more serious when we\nturned and found, looking down, that the objects below us were station-\nary or even inclined to drift backwards. However, we got back to the field\nat last, and I think the pilot was as relieved as I. What impressed me most\nwas the terrible racket of the propeller, comparing so unfavourably with 30\nthe delicious calm of the balloon journey.\nThere is one form of sport in which I have, I think, been able to do\nsome practical good, for I can claim to have been the first to introduce\nskis into the Grisons division of Switzerland, or at least to demonstrate\ntheir practical utility as a means of getting across in winter from one val- 35\nley to another. It was in 1894 that I read Nansen\u2019s account of his cross-\ning of Greenland, and thus became interested in the subject of ski-ing. It\nchanced that I was compelled to spend that winter in the Davos valley,\n247 some recollections of sport\nand I spoke about the matter to Tobias Branger, a sporting tradesman\nin the village, who in turn interested his brother. We sent for skis from\nNorway, and for some weeks afforded innocent amusement to a large\nnumber of people who watched our awkward movements and complex\n5 tumbles. The Brangers made much better progress than I. At the end of a\nmonth or so we felt that we were getting more expert, and determined to\nclimb the Jacobshorn, a considerable hill just opposite the Davos Hotel.\nWe had to carry our unwieldy skis upon our backs until we had passed\nthe fir trees which line its slopes, but once in the open we made splendid\n10 progress, and had the satisfaction of seeing the flags in the village dipped\nin our honour when we reached the summit. But it was only in returning\nthat we got the full flavour of ski-ing. In ascending you shuffle up by long\nzig-zags, the only advantage of your footgear being that it is carrying you\nover snow which would engulf you without it. But coming back you sim-\n15 ply turn your long toes and let yourself go, gliding delightfully over the\ngentle slopes, flying down the steeper ones, taking an occasional cropper,\nbut getting as near to flying as any earth-bound man can. In that glorious\nair it is a delightful experience.\nEncouraged by our success with the Jacobshorn, we determined to\n20 show the utility of our accomplishment by opening up communications\nwith Arosa, which lies in a parallel valley and can only be reached in win-\nter by a very long and roundabout railway journey. To do this we had to\ncross a high pass, and then drop down on the other side. It was a most\ninteresting journey, and we felt all the pride of pioneers as we arrived in\n25 Arosa.\nI have no doubt that what we did would seem absurdly simple to\nNorwegians or others who were apt at the game, but we had to find\nthings out for ourselves and it was sometimes rather terrifying. The sun\nhad not yet softened the snow on one sharp slope across which we had\n30 to go, and we had to stamp with our skis in order to get any foothold.\nOn our left the snow slope ended in a chasm from which a blue smoke\nor fog rose in the morning air. I hardly dared look in that direction, but\nfrom the corner of my eye I saw the vapour of the abyss. I stamped along\nand the two gallant Switzers got on my left, so that if I slipped the shock\n35 would come upon them. We had no rope by which we could link up. We\ngot across all right and perhaps we exaggerated the danger, but it was not\na pleasant experience.\nThen I remember that we came to an absolute precipice, up which no\n248 cchhaapptteerr 2244\ndoubt the path zig-zags in summer. It was not of course perpendicular,\nbut it seemed little removed from it, and it had just slope enough to hold\nthe snow. It looked impassable, but the Brangers had picked up a lot in\nsome way of their own. They took off their skis, fastened them together\nwith a thong, and on this toboggan they sat, pushing themselves over the 5\nedge, and going down amid a tremendous spray of flying snow. When\nthey had reached safety they beckoned to me to follow. I had done as\nthey did, and was sitting on my ski preparatory to launching myself when\na fearsome thing happened, for my ski shot from under me, flew down\nthe slope, and vanished in huge bounds among the snow mounds be- 10\nyond. It was a nasty moment, and the poor Brangers stood looking up at\nme some hundreds of feet below me in a dismal state of mind. However,\nthere was no possible choice as to what to do, so I did it. I let myself go\nover the edge, and came squattering down, with legs and arms extended\nto check the momentum. A minute later I was rolling covered with snow 15\nat the feet of my guides, and my skis were found some hundreds of yards\naway, so no harm was done after all.\nI remember that when we signed the hotel register Tobias Branger\nfilled up the space after my name, in which the new arrival had to de-\nscribe his profession, by the word \u2018Sportesmann,\u2019 which I took as a com- 20\npliment. It was at any rate more pleasant than the German description\nof my golf clubs, which went astray on the railway and turned up at last\nwith the official description of \u2018Kinderspieler\u2019 (child\u2019s toys) attached to\nthem. To return to the skis they are no doubt in very general use, but I\nthink I am right in saying that these and other excursions of ours first 25\ndemonstrated their possibilities to the people of the country and have\ncertainly sent a good many thousands of pounds since then into Switzer-\nland. If my rather rambling career in sport has been of any practical value\nto anyone, it is probably in this matter, and also, perhaps, in the opening\nup of miniature rifle-ranges in 1901, when the idea was young in this 30\ncountry, and when my Hindhead range was the pioneer and the model\nfor many others.\nA pleasing souvenir of my work on Rifle Clubs is to be found in the\nConan Doyle Cup, which was presented by my friend Sir John Langman,\nand is still shot for every year at Bisley by civilian teams. 35\nOn the whole as I look back there is no regret in my mind for the time\nthat I have devoted to sport. It gives health and strength, but above all it\ngives a certain balance of mind without which a man is not complete. To\n249 some recollections of sport\ngive and to take, to accept success modestly and defeat bravely, to fight\nagainst odds, to stick to one\u2019s point, to give credit to your enemy and\nvalue your friend \u2013 these are some of the lessons which true sport\nshould impart.\n250 Chapter 25\nTO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS IN 1914\nBaseball \u2013 Parkman \u2013 Ticonderoga \u2013 Prairie Towns \u2013 Procession of Ceres \u2013 5\nRelics of the Past \u2013 A Moose \u2013 Prospects for Emigrants \u2013 Jasper Park \u2013 The\nGreat Divide \u2013 Algonquin Park.\nIn 1914, with little perception of how near we were to the greatest event\nof the world\u2019s history, we accepted an invitation from the Canadian Gov- 10\nernment to inspect the National Reserve at Jasper Park in the Northern\nRockies. The Grand Trunk Railway (Canadian) made matters easy for\nus by generously undertaking to pass us over their system and to place\na private car at our disposal. This proved to be a gloriously comforta-\nble and compact little home consisting of a parlour, a dining-room and a 15\nbedroom. It belonged to Mr. Chamberlin, the president of the line, who\nallowed us the use of it. Full of anticipation we started off in May upon\nour long and pleasant journey. Our first point was New York, where we\nhoped to put in a week of sight-seeing, since my wife had never been to\nAmerica. Then we were to go North and meet our kind hosts of Canada. 20\nAt the Plaza Hotel of New York we found ourselves in pleasant quarters\nfor a hectic week. Here are a few impressions.\nWe went to see a baseball game at New York \u2013 a first-class match, as\nwe should say \u2013 or \u2018some ball,\u2019 as a native expert described it. I looked on\nit all with the critical but sympathetic eyes of an experienced though de- 25\ncrepit cricketer. The men were fine fellows, harder looking than most of\nour professionals \u2013 indeed they train continually, and some of the teams\nhad even before the days of prohibition to practise complete abstinence,\nwhich is said to show its good results not so much in physical fitness as\nin the mental quickness which is very essential in the game. The catching 30\nseemed to me extraordinarily good, especially the judging of the long\ncatches by the \u2018bleachers,\u2019 as the outfields who are far from any shade\nare called. The throwing in is also remarkably hard and accurate, and, if\napplied to cricket, would astonish some of our batsmen. The men earn\nanything from \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 in the season. This money question is 35\na weak point of the game, as it is among our own Soccer clubs, since it\nmeans that the largest purse has the best team, and there is no necessary\nrelation between the player and the place he plays for. Thus we looked\n251 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nupon New York defeating the Philadelphia Athletics, but there was no\nmore reason to suppose that New York had actually produced one team\nthan that Philadelphia had produced the other. For this reason the small-\ner matches, such as are played between local teams or colleges, seem to\n5 me to be more exciting, as they do represent something definite.\nThe pitcher is the man who commands the highest salary and has\nmastered the hardest part of the game. His pace is remarkable, far faster,\nI should say, than any bowling; but of course it is a throw, and as such\nwould not be possible in the cricket field. I had one uneasy moment\n10 when I was asked in Canada to take the bat and open a baseball game.\nThe pitcher, fortunately, was merciful, and the ball came swift but true. I\nsteadied myself by trying to imagine that it was a bat which I held in my\ngrasp and that this was a full toss, which asked to be hit over the ropes.\nFortunately, I got it fairly in the middle and it went on its appointed way,\n15 whizzing past the ear of a photographer, who expected me to pat it. I\nshould not care to have to duplicate the performance \u2013 nor would the\nphotographer.\nI took the opportunity when I was in New York to inspect the two fa-\nmous prisons, The Tombs and Sing Sing. The Tombs is in the very heart\n20 of the city, and a gloomy, ill-boding place it is when seen from without.\nWithin it is equally dismal. I walked round in a somewhat shamefaced\nway, for it makes you feel so when you encounter human suffering which\nyou cannot relieve. Warders and prisoners seemed however to be cheer-\nful enough, and there was an off-hand way of doing things which seemed\n25 strange after our rigid methods. A Chinese prisoner, for example, was\nstanding at the bottom of the lift, and I heard the warder shout through\nthe tube, \u2018Have you got room for another Chink in number three?\u2019 I had\na talk with one strange Englishman who was barred in like a wild beast.\nHe spoke of the various prisons, of which he had a wide acquaintance,\n30 exactly as if they were hotels which he was recommending or condemn-\ning. \u2018Toronto is a very poor show. The food is bad. I hope I may never see\nToronto Gaol again. Detroit is better. I had quite a pleasant time in De-\ntroit.\u2019 And so on. He spoke and looked like a gentleman, but I could quite\nimagine, in spite of his genial manner, that he was a dangerous crook.\n35 When I left him he said: \u2018Well, bye-bye! Sorry you have to go! We can\u2019t\nall be out and about, can we?\u2019\nIn the same week I went to Sing Sing, the State Penitentiary, which\nis some twenty miles from the city on the banks of the Hudson. It is an\n252 chapter 25\nancient building, dating from the middle of last century, and it certainly\nshould be condemned by a rich and prosperous community. By a strange\ncoincidence the convicts were having one of their few treats in the year\nthat day, and I was able to see them all assembled together in the great\nhall, listening to a music-hall troupe from New York. Poor devils, all the 5\nforced, vulgar gaiety of the songs and the antics of half-clad women must\nhave provoked a terrible reaction in their minds. Many of them had, I\nobserved, abnormalities of cranium or of features which made it clear\nthat they were not wholly responsible for their actions. There was a good\nsprinkling of coloured men among them. Here and there I noticed an 10\nintelligent and even a good face. One wondered how they got there.\nI was locked up afterwards in one of the cells \u2013 seven feet by four \u2013\nand I was also placed in the electrocution chair, a very ordinary, stout,\ncane-bottomed seat, with a good many sinister wires dangling round it.\nI had a long talk with the Governor, who seemed in himself to be a hu- 15\nmane man, but terribly hampered by the awful building which he had to\nadminister.\nOne morning of early June \u2018my Lady Sunshine\u2019 and I \u2013 (if I may be\nallowed to quote the charmingly appropriate name which the New York\nPress had given to my wife) left New York for Parkman Land, which I had 20\nlong wished to explore. We were glad to get away as we had been consid-\nerably harassed by the ubiquitous and energetic American reporter.\nThis individual is really, in nine cases out of ten, a very good fellow,\nand if you will treat him with decent civility he will make the best of\nyou with the public. It is absurd for travellers to be rude to him, as is 25\ntoo often the attitude of the wandering Briton. The man is under orders\nfrom his paper, and if he returns without results it is not a compliment\nupon his delicacy which will await him. He is out to see you and describe\nyou, and if he finds you an ill-tempered, cantankerous curmudgeon, he\nvery naturally says so and turns out some excellent spicy reading at your 30\nexpense. The indignant Briton imagines that this is done in revenge. The\nreporter would not be human if it did not amuse him to do it, but it very\noften represents the exact impression which the vituperative traveller\nhas made upon the pressman, himself as often as not an overworked and\nhighly-strung man. 35\nReminiscences of interviews are occasionally amusing. I can remem-\nber that on my previous visit I was approached one night by an inter-\nviewer in a very marked state of intoxication. He was so drunk that I\n253 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nwondered what in the world he would make of his subject, and I bought\nhis paper next day to see. To my amusement I found that I had made the\nworst possible impression upon him. He had found no good in me at all.\nHe may even have attributed to me his own weakness, like the Scotch\n5 toper who said: \u2018Sandy drank that hard that by the end of the evening I\ncouldn\u2019t see him.\u2019\nTo return to Parkman Land. I am surprised to find how few Ameri-\ncans and fewer Canadians there are who appreciate that great historian\nat his true worth. I wonder whether any man of letters has ever devoted\n10 himself to a task with such whole-hearted devotion as Parkman. He knew\nthe old bloody frontier as Scott knew the border marches. He was soaked\nin New England tradition. He prepared himself for writing about Indians\nby living for months in their wigwams.\nHe was intimate with old French life, and he spent some time in a\n15 religious house that he might catch something of the spirit which played\nso great a part in the early history of Canada. On the top of all this he\nhad the well-balanced, unprejudiced mind of the great chronicler, and he\ncultivated a style which was equally removed from insipidity and from\naffectation. As to his industry and resolution, they are shown by the fact\n20 that he completed his volumes after he had been stricken by blindness. It\nis hard to name any historian who has such an equipment as this. From\nhis Pioneers of the New World to his Conspiracy of Pontiac I have read his\ntwelve volumes twice over, and put some small reflection of them into\nmy Refugees.\n25 We explored not only the beautiful tragic Lake George, but also its\ngreat neighbour Lake Champlain, almost as full of historical reminis-\ncence. Upon this, level with the head of the smaller lake, stood Ticondero-\nga, the chief seat of the French Canadian power. Some five miles separate\nit from Lake George, up which the British came buzzing whenever they\n30 were strong enough to do so. Once in front of the palisades of Ticondero-\nga, they met with heavy defeat, and yet once again, by the valour of the\nnewly-enrolled Black Watch, they swept the place off the map. I wonder\nif Stevenson had actually been there before he wrote his eerie haunting\nballad \u2013 the second finest of the sort, in my opinion, in our literature. It\n35 is more than likely, since he spent some time in the neighbouring Adi-\nrondacks. Pious hands were restoring the old fort of Ticonderoga, much\nof which has been uncovered. All day we skirted Lake Champlain, into\nwhich the old French explorer first found his way, and where he made the\n254 chapter 25\ndreadful mistake of mixing in Indian warfare, which brought the whole\nblood-thirsty vendetta of the five nations upon the young French settle-\nments. Up at the head of the lake we saw Plattsburg, where the Ameri-\ncans gained a victory in the war of 1812. The sight of these battlefields,\nwhether they mark British or American successes, always fills me with 5\nhorror. If the war of 1776 was, as I hold, a glorious mistake, that of 1812\nwas a senseless blunder. Had neither occurred, the whole of North Amer-\nica would now be one magnificent undivided country, pursuing its own\nindependent destiny, and yet united in such unblemished ties of blood\nand memory to the old country that each could lean at all times upon the 10\nother. It is best for Britishers, no doubt, that we should never lean upon\nanything bigger than ourselves. But I see no glory in these struggles, and\nlittle wisdom in the statesmen who waged them. Among them they split\nthe race from base to summit, and who has been the gainer? Not Britain,\nwho was alienated from so many of her very best children. Not America, 15\nwho lost Canada and had on her hands a civil war which a United Empire\ncould have avoided. Ah well, there is a controlling force somewhere, and\nthe highest wisdom is to believe that all things are ordered for the best.\nAbout evening we crossed the Canadian frontier, the Richelieu River,\ndown which the old Iroquois scalping parties used to creep, gleaming 20\ncoldly in the twilight. There is nothing to show where you have crossed\nthat border. There is the same sort of country, the same cultivation, the\nsame plain wooden houses. Nothing was changed save that suddenly I\nsaw a little old ensign flying on a gable, and it gives you a thrill when you\nhave not seen it for a time. 25\nIt is not until one has reached the Prairie country that the traveller\nmeets with new conditions and new problems. He traverses Ontario\nwith its prosperous mixed farms and its fruit-growing villages, but the\ngeneral effect is the same as in Eastern America. Then comes the enor-\nmous stretch of the Great Lakes, those wonderful inland seas, with great 30\noceangoing steamers. We saw the newly built Noronic, destined altogeth-\ner for passenger traffic, and worthy to compare, both in internal fittings\nand outward appearance, with many an Atlantic liner. The Indians looked\nin amazement at La Salle\u2019s little vessel. I wondered what La Salle and his\nmen would think of the Noronic! For two days in great comfort we voy- 35\naged over the inland waters. They lay peaceful for our passage, but we\nheard grim stories of winter gusts and of ships which were never heard of\nmore. It is not surprising that there should be accidents, for the number\n255 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nof vessels is extraordinary, and being constructed with the one idea of\ncarrying the maximum of cargo, they appeared to be not very stable. I\nam speaking now of the whaleback freight carriers and not of the fine\npassenger service, which could not be beaten.\n5 I have said that the number of vessels is extraordinary. I have been\ntold that the tonnage passing through Sault Ste. Marie, where the lakes\njoin, is greater than that of any port in the world. All the supplies and\nmanufactures for the West move one way, while the corn of the great\nprairie, and the ores from the Lake Superior copper and iron mines move\n10 the other. In the Fall there comes the triumphant procession of the har-\nvest. Surely in more poetic days banners might have waved and cymbals\nclashed, and priests of Ceres sung their hymns in the vanguard, as this\nflotilla of mercy moved majestically over the face of the waters to the aid\nof hungry Europe. However, we have cut out the frills, to use the vernac-\n15 ular, though life would be none the worse could we tinge it a little with\nthe iridescence of romance.\nWe stopped at Sault Ste. Marie, the neck of the hourglass between the\ntwo great lakes of Huron and Superior. There were several things there\nwhich are worthy of record. The lakes are of a different level, and the lock\n20 which avoids the dangerous rapids is on an enormous scale; but, beside\nit, unnoticed save by those who know where to look and what to look for,\nthere is a little stonelined cutting no larger than an uncovered drain \u2013 it is\nthe detour by which for centuries the voyageurs, trappers, and explorers\nmoved their canoes round the Sault or fall on their journey to the great\n25 solitudes beyond. Close by it is one of the old Hudson Bay log forts, with\nits fireproof roof, its loopholed walls, and every other device for Indian\nfighting. Very small and mean these things look by the side of the great\nlocks and the huge steamers within them. But where would locks and\nsteamers have been had these others not taken their lives in their hands\n30 to clear the way?\nThe twin cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, at the head of Lake\nSuperior, form the most growing community of Canada. They call them\ntwin cities, but I expect, like their Siamese predecessors, they will grow\ninto one. Already the suburbs join each other, though proximity does\n35 not always lead to amalgamation or even to cordiality, as in the adjacent\ntowns of St. Paul and Minneapolis. When the little American boy was\nasked in Sunday school who persecuted Saint Paul, he \u2018guessed it was\nMinneapolis.\u2019 But in the case of Fort William and Port Arthur they are\n256 chapter 25\nso evidently interdependent that it is difficult to believe that they will fail\nto coalesce; when they do, I am of opinion that they may grow to be a\nCanadian Chicago, and possibly become the greatest city in the country.\nAll lines converge there, as does all the lake traffic, and everything from\nEast to West must pass through it. If I were a rich man and wished to be- 5\ncome richer, I should assuredly buy land in the twin cities. Though they\nlie in the very centre of the broadest portion of the continent, the water\ncommunications are so wonderful that an oceangoing steamer from Liv-\nerpool or Glasgow can now unload at their quays.\nThe grain elevators of Fort William are really majestic erections, and 10\nwith a little change of their construction might be aesthetic as well. Even\nnow the huge cylinders into which they are divided look at a little dis-\ntance not unlike the columns of Luxor. This branch of human ingenuity\nhas been pushed at Fort William to its extreme. The last word has been\nsaid there upon every question covering the handling of grain. By some 15\nprocess, which is far beyond my unmechanical brain, the stuff is even di-\nvided automatically according to its quality, and there are special hospi-\ntal elevators where damaged grain can be worked up into a more perfect\narticle.\nBy the way, it was here, while lying at a steamship wharf on the very 20\nedge of the city, that I first made the acquaintance of one of the original\ninhabitants of Canada. A cleared plain stretched from the ship to a wood\nsome hundreds of yards off. As I stood upon deck I saw what I imagined\nto be a horse wander out of the wood and begin to graze in the clearing.\nThe creature seemed ewenecked beyond all possibility, and looking clos- 25\ner I saw to my surprise that it was a wild hornless moose. Could anything\nbe more characteristic of the present condition of Canada \u2013 the great\nmechanical developments of Fort William within gunshot of me on one\nside, and this shy wanderer of the wilderness on the other? In a few years\nthe dweller in the great city will read of my experience with the same 30\nmixture of incredulity and surprise with which we read the occasional\ncorrespondent\u2019s letter whose grandfather shot a woodcock in Maida Vale.\nThe true division between the East and West of Canada is not the\nGreat Lakes, which are so valuable as a waterway, but lies in the 500 miles\nof country between the Lakes and Winnipeg. It is barren, but beautiful, 35\ncovered with forest which is not large enough to be of value as lumber.\nIt is a country of rolling plains covered with low trees with rivers in the\nvalleys. The soil is poor. It is really a problem what to do with this belt,\n257 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nwhich is small according to Canadian distance, but is none the less broad-\ner than the distance between London and Edinburgh. Unless minerals\nare found in it, I should think that it will be to Canada what the High-\nlands of Scotland are to Britain \u2013 a region set apart for sport because it\n5 has no other economic use. The singular thing about this barren treeland\nis that it quite suddenly changes to the fertile prairie at a point to the east\nof Winnipeg. I presume that there is some geological reason, but it was\nstrange to see the fertile plain run up to the barren woods with as clear a\ndivision as there is between the sea and the shore.\n10 And now one reached the west of Winnipeg and on that prairie which\nmeans so much both to Canada and to the world. It was wonderfully im-\npressive to travel swiftly all day from the early summer dawn to the latest\nevening light, and to see always the same little clusters of houses, always\nthe same distant farms, always the same huge expanse stretching to the\n15 distant skyline, mottled with cattle, or green with the half-grown crops.\nYou think these people are lonely. What about the people beyond them\nand beyond them again, each family in its rude barracks in the midst of\nthe 160 acres which form the minimum farm? No doubt they are lone-\nly, and yet there are alleviations. When men or women are working on\n20 their own property and seeing their fortune growing, they have pleasant\nthoughts to bear them company. It is the women, I am told, who feel it\nmost, and who go prairie-mad. Now they have rigged telephone circles\nwhich connect up small groups of farms and enable the women to relieve\ntheir lives by a little friendly gossip, when the whole district thrills to the\n25 news that Mrs. Jones has been in the cars to Winnipeg and bought a new\nbonnet. At the worst the loneliness of the prairie can never, one would\nthink, have the soul-killing effect of loneliness in a town. \u2018There is always\nthe wind on the heath, brother.\u2019 Besides, the wireless has now arrived,\nand that is the best friend of the lonely man.\n30 Land is not so easily picked up by the emigrant as in the old days, when\n160 acres beside the railroad were given away free. There was still in 1914\nfree land to be had, but it was in the back country. However, this back coun-\ntry of to-day is always liable to be opened up by the branch railway lines\nto-morrow. On the whole, however, it seems to be more economical, if the\n35 emigrant has the money, to buy a partially developed well-situated farm\nthan to take up a virgin homestead. That is what the American emigrants\ndo who have been pouring into the country, and they know best the value\nof such farms, having usually come from exactly similar ones just across\n258 chapter 25\nthe border, the only difference being that they can get ten acres in Canada\nfor the price of one in Minnesota or Iowa. They hasten to take out their\npapers of naturalization, and make, it is said, most excellent and contented\ncitizens. Their energy and industry are remarkable. A body of them had\nreached the land which they proposed to buy about the time that we were 5\nin the West; they had come over the border with their wagons, their horses,\nand their ploughs. Being taken to the spot by the land agent, the leader of\nthe party tested the soil, cast a rapid glance over the general prairie, and\nthen cried: \u2018I guess this will do, boys. Get off the ploughs.\u2019\nThe agent who was present told me that they had broken an acre of 10\nthe prairie before they slept that night. These men were German Luther-\nans from Minnesota, and they settled in the neighbourhood of Scott. The\ngains on the farms are very considerable. It is not unusual for a man to\npay every expense which he has incurred, including the price of the land,\nwithin the first two years. After that, with decent luck, he should be a pros- 15\nperous man, able to bring up a family in ease and comfort. If he be British,\nand desires to return to the Old Country, it should not be difficult for\nhim to save enough in ten or twelve years to make himself, after selling\nhis farm, more or less independent for life. That is, as it seems to me, an\nimportant consideration for many people who hesitate to break all the old 20\nties and feel that they are leaving their motherland for ever.\nSo much about farms and farming. I cannot see how one can write\nabout this western part and avoid the subject which is written in green and\ngold from sky to sky. There is nothing else. Nowhere is there any sign of\nyesterday \u2013 not a cairn, not a monument. Life has passed here, but has left 25\nno footstep behind. But stay, the one thing which the old life still leaves\nis just this one thing \u2013 footsteps. Look at them in the little narrow black\npaths which converge to the water \u2013 little dark ruts which wind and twist.\nThose are the buffalo runs of old. Gone are the Cree and Blackfoot hunt-\ners who shot them down. Gone, too, the fur-traders who bought the skins. 30\nChief Factor MacTavish, who entered into the great Company\u2019s service as\na boy, spent his life in slow promotion from Fort This to Fort That, and\nmade a decent Presbyterian woman of some Indian squaw, finally saw with\nhorror in his old age that the world was crowding his wild beasts out of\ntheir pastures. Gone are the great herds upon which both Indian hunter 35\nand fur-trader were parasitical. Indian, trader and buffalo all have passed,\nand here on the great plains are these narrow runways as the last remaining\nsign of a vanished world.\n259 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nEdmonton is the capital of the western side of the prairie, even as\nWinnipeg of the eastern. I do not suppose the average Briton has the\nleast conception of the amenities of Winnipeg. He would probably be\nsurprised to hear that the Fort Garry Hotel there is nearly as modern and\n5 luxurious as any hotel in Northumberland Avenue. There were no such\nluxuries in 1914 in Edmonton. The town was in a strangely half-formed\ncondition, rude and raw, but with a great atmosphere of energy, bustle,\nand future greatness. With its railway connections and waterways it is\nbound to be a large city. At the time of our visit the streets were full of\n10 out-of-works, great husky men, some of them of magnificent physique,\nwho found themselves at a loss, on account of cessations in railroad\nconstruction. They told me that they would soon be reabsorbed, but\nmeantime the situation was the rudest object-lesson in economics that\nI have ever witnessed. Here were these splendid men, ready and willing\n15 to work. Here was a new country calling in every direction for labour.\nHow come the two things to be even temporarily disconnected? There\ncould be but one word. It was want of capital. And why was the capital\nwanting? Why was the work of the railroads held up? Because the mon-\ney market was tight in London \u2013 London which finds, according to the\n20 most recent figures, 73 per cent of all the moneys with which Canada is\ndeveloped. Such was the state of things. What will amend it? How can\ncapital be made to flow into the best channels? By encouragement and\nsecurity and the hope of good returns. I never heard of any system of\nsocialism which did not seem to defeat the very object which it had at\n25 heart. And yet it was surely deplorable that the men should be there, and\nthat the work should be there, and that none could command the link\nwhich would unite them.\nA line of low distant hills broke the interminable plain which has ex-\ntended with hardly a rising for 1,500 miles. Above them was, here and\n30 there, a peak of snow. Shades of Mayne Reid, they were the Rockies \u2013 my\nold familiar Rockies! Have I been here before? What an absurd ques-\ntion, when I lived here for about ten years of my life in all the hours of\ndreamland. What deeds have I not done among Redskins and trappers\nand grizzlies within their wilds! And here they were at last glimmering\n35 bright in the rising morning sun. At least, I have seen my dream moun-\ntains. Most boys never do.\nJasper Park is one of the great national playgrounds and health re-\nsorts which the Canadian Government with great wisdom has laid out\n260 chapter 25\nfor the benefit of the citizens. When Canada has filled up and carries a\nlarge population, she will bless the foresight of the administrators who\ntook possession of broad tracts of the most picturesque land and put\nthem for ever out of the power of the speculative dealer. The National\nPark at Banff has for twenty years been a Mecca for tourists. That at Al- 5\ngonquin gives a great pleasure-ground to those who cannot extend their\ntravels beyond Eastern Canada. But this new Jasper Park is the latest and\nthe wildest of all these reserves. Some years ago it was absolute wilder-\nness, and much of it impenetrable. Now, through the energy of Colonel\nRogers, trails have been cut through it in various directions, and a great 10\nnumber of adventurous trips into country which is practically unknown\ncan be carried out with ease and comfort. The packer plays the part of a\ndragoman in the East, arranging the whole expedition, food, cooking,\nand everything else on inclusive terms; and once in the hands of a first-\nclass Rocky Mountain packer, a man of the standing of Fred Stephens or 15\nthe Otto Brothers, the traveller can rely upon a square deal and the com-\npanionship of one whom he will find to be a most excellent comrade.\nThere is no shooting in the park \u2013 it is a preserve for all wild animals \u2013 but\nthere is excellent fishing, and everywhere there are the most wonderful\nexcursions, where you sleep at night under the stars upon the balsamic 20\nfir branches which the packer gathers for your couch. I could not imagine\nan experience which would be more likely to give a freshet of vitality\nwhen the stream runs thin. For a week we lived the life of simplicity and\nnature.\nThe park is not as full of wild creatures as it will be after a few years of 25\npreservation. The Indians who lived in this part rounded up everything\nthat they could before moving to their reservation. But even now, the\nbear lumbers through the brushwood, the eagle soars above the lake, the\ntimber wolf still skulks in the night, and the deer graze in the valleys.\nAbove, near the snow-line, the wild goat is not uncommon, while at a 30\nlower altitude are found the mountain sheep. On the last day of our visit\nthe rare cinnamon bear exposed his yellow coat upon a clearing within a\nfew hundred yards of the village. I saw his clumsy good-humoured head\nlooking at me from over a dead trunk, and I thanked the kindly Canadian\nlaw which has given him a place of sanctuary. What a bloodthirsty ba- 35\nboon man must appear to the lower animals! If any superhuman demon\ntreated us exactly as we treat the pheasants, we should begin to reconsid-\ner our views as to what is sport.\n261 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nThe porcupine is another creature which abounded in the woods. I\ndid not see any, but a friend described an encounter between one and his\ndog. The creature\u2019s quills are detachable when he wishes to be nasty, and\nat the end of the fight it was not easy to say which was the dog and which\n5 the porcupine.\nLife in Jasper interested me as an experience of the first stage of a raw\nCanadian town. It will certainly grow into a considerable place, but at\nthat time, bar Colonel Rogers\u2019 house and the station, there were only log-\nhuts and small wooden dwellings. Christianity was apostolic in its sim-\n10 plicity and in its freedom from strife \u2013 though one has to go back remark-\nably early in apostolic times to find those characteristics. Two churches\nwere being built, the pastor in each case acting also as head mason and\ncarpenter. One, the corner-stone of which I had the honour of laying,\nwas to be used in turn by several Nonconformist bodies. To the ceremo-\n15 ny came the Anglican parson, grimy from his labours on the opposition\nbuilding, and prayed for the well-being of his rival. The whole function,\nwith its simplicity and earnestness, carried out by a group of ill-clad men\nstanding bareheaded in a drizzle of rain, seemed to me to have in it the\nessence of religion. As I ventured to remark to them, Kikuyu and Jasper\n20 can give some lessons to London.\nWe made a day\u2019s excursion by rail to the T\u00eate Jaune Cache, which is\nacross the British Columbian border and marks the watershed between\nEast and West. Here we saw the Fraser, already a formidable river, rush-\ning down to the Pacific. At the head of the pass stands the village of the\n25 railway workers, exactly like one of the mining townships of Bret Harte,\nsave that the bad man is never allowed to be too bad. There is a worse\nman in a red serge coat and a Stetson hat, who is told off by the State to\nlook after him, and does his duty in such fashion that the most fire-eating\ndesperado from across the border falls into the line of law. But apart from\n30 the gunman, this village presented exactly the same queer cabins, strange\nsigns, and gambling-rooms which the great American master has made\nso familiar to us.\nAnd now we were homeward bound! Back through Edmonton, back\nthrough Winnipeg, back through that young giant, Fort William \u2013 but\n35 not back across the Great Lakes. Instead of that transit we took train, by\nthe courtesy of the Canadian Pacific, round the northern shore of Supe-\nrior, a beautiful wooded desolate country, which, without minerals, of-\nfers little prospect for the future. Some 200 miles north of it, the Grand\n262 chapter 25\nTrunk, that enterprising pioneer of empire, has opened up another line\nwhich extends for a thousand miles, and should develop a new corn and\nlumber district. Canada is like an expanding flower; wherever you look\nyou see some fresh petal unrolling.\nWe spent three days at Algonquin Park. This place is within easy dis- 5\ntance of Montreal or Ottawa, and should become a resort of British fish-\nermen and lovers of nature. After all, it is little more than a week from\nLondon, and many a river in Finland takes nearly as long to reach. There\nis good hotel accommodation, and out of the thousand odd lakes in this\nenormous natural preserve one can find all sorts of fishing, though the 10\nbest is naturally the most remote. I had no particular luck myself, but my\nwife caught an eight-pound trout, which Mr. Bartlett, the courteous su-\nperintendent of the park, mounted, so as to confound all doubters. Deer\nabound in the park, and the black bear is not uncommon, while wolves\ncan often be heard howling in the night-time. 15\nWhat will be the destiny of Canada? Some people talk as if it were in\ndoubt. Personally, I have none upon the point. Canada will remain exact-\nly as she is for two more generations. At the end of that time there must\nbe reconsideration of the subject, especially on the part of Great Britain,\nwho will find herself with a child as large as herself under the same roof. 20\nI see no argument for the union of Canada with the United States.\nThere is excellent feeling between the two countries, but they could no\nmore join at this period of their history than a great oak could combine\nwith a well-rooted pine to make one tree. The roots of each are far too\ndeep. It is impossible. 25\nThen there is the alternative of Canada becoming an independent\nnation. That is not so impossible as a union with the States, but it is in\nthe last degree improbable. Why should Canada wish her independence?\nShe has it now in every essential. But her first need is the capital and the\npopulation which will develop her enormous territory and resources. 30\nThis capital she now receives from the Mother-Country to the extent in\n1914 of 73 per cent, the United States finding 14 per cent, and Canada\nherself the remaining 13. Her dependence upon the Mother-Country for\nemigrants, though not so great as her financial dependence, is still the\ngreatest from any single source. Besides all this, she has the vast insurance 35\npolicy, which is called the British Navy, presented to her for nothing \u2013\nthough honour demands some premium from her in the future \u2013 and she\nhas the British diplomatic service for her use unpaid. Altogether, looking\n263 to the rocky mountains in 1914\nat it from the material side, Canada\u2019s interests lie deeply in the present\narrangement. But there is a higher and more unselfish view which works\neven more strongly in the same direction. Many of the most representa-\ntive Canadians are descendants of those United Empire Loyalists who in\n5 1782 gave up everything and emigrated from the United States in order\nto remain under the flag. Their imperialism is as warm or warmer than\nour own. And everywhere there is a consciousness of the glory of the em-\npire, its magnificent future, and the wonderful possibilities of these great\nnations all growing up under the same flag with the same language and\n10 destinies. This sentiment joins with material advantages, and will prevent\nCanada from having any aspiration towards independence.\nYes, it will remain exactly as it is for the remainder of this century. At\nthe end of that time her population and resources will probably consid-\nerably exceed those of the Mother Land, and problems will arise which\n15 our children\u2019s children may have some difficulty in solving. As to the\nFrench-Canadian, he will always be a conservative force \u2013 let him call\nhimself what he will. His occasional weakness for flying the French flag\nis not to be resented, but is rather a pathetic and sentimental tribute to\na lost cause, like that which adorns every year the pedestal of Charles at\n20 Whitehall.\nI had some presentiment of coming trouble during the time we were\nin Canada, though I never imagined that we were so close to the edge of a\nworld-war. One incident which struck me forcibly was the arrival at Van-\ncouver of a ship full of Sikhs who demanded to be admitted to Canada.\n25 This demand was resisted on account of the immigration laws. The whole\nincident seemed to me to be so grotesque \u2013 for why should sun-loving\nHindoos force themselves upon Canada \u2013 that I was convinced some\nlarger purpose lay behind it. That purpose was, as we can now see, to\npromote discord among the races under the British flag. There can be no\n30 doubt that it was German money that chartered that ship.\nI had several opportunities of addressing large and influential Cana-\ndian audiences, and I never failed to insist upon the sound state of the\nhome population. The Canadians judge us too often by our ne\u2019er-do-\nweels and remittance men, who are the sample Englishmen who come\n35 before them. In defence even of these samples it should be stated that\nthey bulked very large in the first Canadian Division. I told the Cana-\ndians of our magnificent Boy Scout movement, and also of the move-\nment of old soldiers to form a national guard. \u2018A country where both the\n264 chapter 25\nold and the young can start new, unselfish, patriotic movements is a live\ncountry,\u2019 I said, \u2018and if we are tested we will prove just as good as ever our\nfathers were.\u2019 I did not dream how near the test would be, how hard it\nwould press, or how gloriously it would be met.\nAnd now I turn to the war, the physical climax of my life as it must be 5\nof the life of every living man and woman. Each was caught as a separate\nchip and swept into that fearsome whirlpool, where we all gyrated for\nfour years, some sinking for ever, some washed up all twisted and bent,\nand all of us showing in our souls and bodies some mark of the terrible\nforces which had controlled us so long. I will show presently how the war 10\nreacted upon me, and also if one may speak without presumption, how\nin a minute way I in turn reacted upon the war.\n265 Chapter 26\nTHE EVE OF WAR\n5 The Prologue of Armageddon \u2013 The \u2018Prince Henry\u2019 Race \u2013 Bernhardi \u2013\n\u2018England and the Next War\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Danger!\u2019 \u2013 General Sir H. Wilson \u2013 The\nChannel Tunnel \u2013 Naval Defects \u2013 Rubber Collars \u2013 Mines \u2013 Willie Redmond.\nFor a long time I never seriously believed in the German menace. Fre-\n10 quently I found myself alone, in a company of educated Englishmen, in\nmy opinion that it was non-existent \u2013 or at worst greatly exaggerated.\nThis conclusion was formed on two grounds. The first was, that I knew it\nto be impossible that we could attack Germany save in the face of mon-\nstrous provocation. By the conditions of our government, even if those\n15 in high places desired to do such a thing, it was utterly impracticable, for\na foreign war could not be successfully carried on by Great Britain unless\nthe overwhelming majority of the people approved of it. Our foreign, like\nour home, politics are governed by the vote of the proletariat. It would be\nimpossible to wage an aggressive war against any Power if the public were\n20 not convinced of its justice and necessity. For this reason we could not\nattack Germany. On the other hand, it seemed to be equally unthinkable\nthat Germany should attack us. One failed to see what she could possibly\nhope to gain by such a proceeding. She had enemies already upon her\neastern and western frontiers, and it was surely unlikely that she would\n25 go out of her way to pick a quarrel with the powerful British Empire. If\nshe made war and lost it, her commerce would be set back and her rising\ncolonial empire destroyed. If she won it, it was difficult to see where she\ncould hope for the spoils. We could not give her greater facilities for trade\nthan she had already. We could not give her habitable white colonies, for\n30 she would find it impossible to take possession of them in the face of\nthe opposition of the inhabitants. An indemnity she could never force\nfrom us. Some coaling stations and possibly some tropical colonies, of\nwhich latter she already possessed abundance, were the most that she\ncould hope for. Would such a prize as that be worth the risk attending\n35 such a war? To me it seemed that there could be only one answer to such\na question.\nI am still of the same opinion. But unhappily the affairs of nations\nare not always regulated by reason, and occasionally a country may be af-\n266 chapter 26\nflicted by a madness which sets all calculations at defiance. Then, again, I\nhad looked upon the matter too much as between Great Britain and Ger-\nmany. I had not sufficiently considered the chance of our being drawn\nin against our will in order to safeguard Belgium, or in order to stop the\nannihilation of France. It was so perfectly clear that Britain by her treaty 5\nobligations, and by all that is human and honourable, would fight if Bel-\ngium were invaded, that one could not conceive Germany taking such\na step with any other expectation. And yet what we could not conceive\nis exactly what happened, for it is clear that the delusions as to our de-\ngeneration in character had really persuaded the Germans that the big 10\ncowardly fellow would stand by with folded arms and see his little friend\nknocked about by the bully. The whole idea showed an extraordinary ig-\nnorance of the British psychology, but absurd as it was, it was none the\nless the determining influence at the critical moment of the world\u2019s his-\ntory. The influence of the lie is one of the strangest problems of life \u2013 that 15\nwhich is not continually influences that which is. Within one generation\nimagination and misrepresentation have destroyed the Boer republics\nand Imperial Germany.\nOne of my most remarkable pre-war experiences, which influenced\nmy mind deeply, has already been alluded to, namely my participation 20\nin the amateur motor race called the Prince Henry Competition. It was\nrather a reliability test than a race, for the car had to go some 150 miles a\nday on an average at its own pace, but marks were taken off for all involun-\ntary stoppages, breakdowns, accidents, etc. Each owner had to drive his\nown car, and I had entered my little 16 horse-power landaulette. There 25\nwere about forty British cars and fifty German, so that the procession\nwas a very considerable one. Starting from Homburg, the watering-place,\nour route ran through North Germany, then by steamer to Southampton,\nup to Edinburgh and back to London by devious ways.\nThe competition had been planned in Germany, and there can be no 30\ndoubt in looking back that a political purpose underlay it. The idea was\nto create a false entente by means of sport, which would react upon the\nvery serious political development in the wind, namely, the occupation\nof Agadir on the south-west coast of Morocco, which occurred on our\nsecond day out. As Prince Henry, who organized and took part in the 35\ncompetition, was also head of the German Navy, it is of course obvious\nthat he knew that the Panther was going to Agadir, and that there was\na direct connection between the two events, in each of which he was a\n267 the eve of war\nleading actor. It was a clumsy bit of stage management and could not\npossibly have been effective.\nThe peculiarity of the tour was that each car had an officer of the\narmy or navy of the other nation as a passenger, to check the marks. Thus\n5 my wife and I had the enforced company for nearly three weeks of Count\nCarmer, Rittmeister of Breslau Cuirassiers, who began by being stiff and\ninhuman, but speedily thawed and became a very good fellow. The ar-\nrangements were very peculiar. Some British paper \u2013 the Mail if I remem-\nber right \u2013 had stated that the Competition was really a device to pass a\n10 number of German officers through Great Britain in order to spy out the\nland. I think there may have been some truth in this, as our good Count\nwhen we reached London went off to a hotel down in the East End, which\nseemed a curious thing for a wealthy Junker to do. This criticism seems to\nhave annoyed the Kaiser, and he said \u2013 or so it was reported \u2013 that none\n15 but junior officers should go as observers. I should think that ours was\nthe senior of the lot, and the others were mostly captains and lieuten-\nants. On the other hand, the British Government, out of compliment to\nPrince Henry, had appointed the very best men available as observers. If\nthere had been a sudden crisis over Agadir, and Germany had impound-\n20 ed us all, it would have been a national disaster and would have made\na difference in a European war. Speaking from an imperfect memory, I\ncan recall that we had General Grierson, Charles Munro, Rawlinson, I\nthink, Captain \u2013 now General \u2013 Swinton of Tanks fame, Delme Ratcliffe,\nColonel \u2013 now General \u2013 Holman, Major \u2013 now General \u2013 Thwaites, and\n25 many other notables both of the Army and Navy.\nFrom the first relations were strained. There was natural annoy-\nance when these senior officers found that their opposite numbers were\nyoungsters of no experience. Then, again, at Cologne and Munster I un-\nderstand that the German military did not show the proper courtesies,\n30 and certainly the hospitality which the whole party received until we\nreached England was negligible. The Germans themselves must have felt\nashamed of the difference. Personally the competitors were not a bad set\nof fellows, though there were some bounders among them. We were not\nall above criticism ourselves.\n35 Of the Competition itself little need be said, as I have treated the\nsporting side of it elsewhere. Some of the Germans seemed to me to be\na little mad, for they seemed consumed by the idea that it was a race,\nwhereas it mattered nothing who was at the head of the procession or\n268 chapter 26\nwho at the tail, so long as you did the allotted distance in the allotted\ntime. I saw a German bound into his car after some stoppage: \u2018How many\nahead? Three Englishmen! Forwards! Forwards!\u2019 he cried. They barged\ninto each other, dashed furiously round corners, and altogether behaved\nin a wild fashion, while our sedate old fellows pursued their course in 5\na humdrum fashion and saved their marks. There were, however, some\ngood fellows among the Germans. I have not forgotten how one of them,\nanonymously, used to place flowers in my wife\u2019s corner every morning.\nBut as an attempt at an entente it was a great failure. The British of-\nficer who was compelled to spend weeks with a car-load of Germans was 10\nnot expansive and refused to be digested. Some of the Germans, too, be-\ncame disagreeable. I saw a large German car \u2013 they were all Benz and\nMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s, generally 70-80 horse-power \u2013 edge a little British car right\noff the road on to the grass track beside it. The driver of the British car\nwas a pretty useful middle-weight boxer, but he kept his temper or there 15\nmight have been trouble. There was very little love lost on either side,\nthough I, as one of the few German-speaking competitors, did my very\nbest to bring about a more cordial atmosphere. But war was in the air.\nBoth sides spoke of it. Several of the British officers were either of the\nIntelligence branch, or had special German experience, and they were 20\nunanimous about it. My attempts towards peace were rejected. \u2018The only\nthing I want to do with these people is to fight them,\u2019 said Colonel Hol-\nman. \u2018Same here,\u2019 said the officer with him. It was a deep antagonism on\neither side. They were not only sure of the war, but of the date. \u2018It will be\non the first pretext after the Kiel Canal is widened.\u2019 The Kiel Canal was 25\nfinished in June, 1914, and war came in August, so that they were not far\nwrong. There was some little German chaff on the subject. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you\nlike one of these little islands?\u2019 I heard a German say as we steamed out\npast Heligoland and the Frisian Belt.\nIt was this experience which first made me take the threat of war se- 30\nriously, but I could have persuaded myself that I was misled, had it not\nbeen that I read soon afterwards Bernhardi\u2019s book Germany and the Next\nWar. I studied it carefully and I put my impression of it into print in an ar-\nticle called \u2018England and the Next War,\u2019 which appeared in the Fortnightly\nReview in the summer of 1913. It lies before me now, as I write, and it is 35\ninteresting to see how, as I projected my mind and my imagination over\nthe possibilities of the future, I read much aright and some little wrong.\nI began by epitomizing Bernhardi\u2019s whole argument, and showing\n269 the eve of war\nthat, however we might disagree with it, we were bound to take it serious-\nly, since he was undoubtedly a leader of a certain class of thought in his\nown country \u2013 that very military class which was now predominant. I de-\nmurred at his assumption that the German Army in equal numbers must\n5 overcome the French. \u2018It is possible,\u2019 I remarked, \u2018that even so high an au-\nthority as General Bernhardi has not entirely appreciated how Germany\nhas been the teacher of the world in military matters and how thoroughly\nher pupils have responded to that teaching. That attention to detail, per-\nfection of arrangement for mobilization, and careful preparation which\n10 have won German victories in the past may now be turned against her,\nand she may find that others can equal her in her own virtues.\u2019 I then ex-\namined Bernhardi\u2019s alleged grievances against Great Britain, and showed\nhow baseless they were, and how little they could hope to gain by victory.\nI quoted one poisonous sentence \u2018Even English attempts at a rapproche-\n15 ment must not blind us to the real situation. We may at most use them to\ndelay the necessary and inevitable war until we may fairly imagine that\nwe have some prospect of success.\u2019 \u2018This last sentence,\u2019 I remarked, \u2018must\ncome home to some of us who have worked in the past for a better feeling\nbetween the two countries.\u2019\n20 I then gave an epitome of Bernhardi\u2019s plan of campaign as outlined in\ncharming frankness in his volume, and I sketched out how far we were in\na position to meet it and what were the joints in our armour. My general\nconclusions may be given as follows: \u2013\n25 1. That invasion was not a serious danger and that the thought of it\nshould not deflect our plans.\n2. That if invasion becomes impossible then any force like the Terri-\ntorials unless it is prepared to go abroad becomes useless.\n3. That we should not have conscription save as a very last resource,\n30 since it is against the traditions of our people.\n4. That our real danger lay in the submarine and in the airship,\nwhich could not be affected by blockade.\nIn discussing the submarine I said: \u2018What exact effect a swarm of\n35 submarines, lying off the mouth of the Channel and the Irish Sea, would\nproduce upon the victualling of these islands is a problem which is be-\nyond my conjecture. Other ships besides the British would be likely to\nbe destroyed, and international complications would probably follow. I\n270 chapter 26\ncannot imagine that such a fleet would entirely, or even to a very large ex-\ntent, cut off our supplies. But it is certain that they would have the effect\nof considerably raising the price of whatever did reach us. Therefore, we\nshould suffer privation, though not necessarily such privation as would\ncompel us to make terms. From the beginning of the war every home 5\nsource would naturally be encouraged, and it is possible that before our\nexternal supplies were seriously decreased, our internal ones might be\nwell on the way to make up the deficiency.\u2019\nThis did, I think, roughly outline the actual course of events.\n10\n5. That the submarines would affect military operations should we\nsend a force to France or Belgium.\n6. That therefore the Channel Tunnel was a vital necessity.\n7. That all unnecessary expenses should be at once cut down, so that\nBritish credit should stand at its highest when the strain came. 15\nThese are only the general conclusions. The article attracted some\nattention, but I do not suppose that it had any actual influence upon the\ncourse of events. To reinforce it I wrote an imaginary episode called \u2018Dan-\nger!\u2019 in the Strand Magazine, to show how even a small Power might pos- 20\nsibly bring us to our knees by the submarine. It was singularly prophetic,\nfor not only did it outline the actual situation as it finally developed, but\nit contained many details, the zig-zagging of the merchant ships, the use\nof submarine guns, the lying for the night on sandy bottoms, and so forth\n\u2013 exactly as they occurred. The article was sent round in proof to a num- 25\nber of high naval officers, mostly retired, for their opinions. I am afraid\nthat the printed results, which I will not be so cruel as to quote, showed\nthat it was as well they were retired, since they had no sense of the possi-\nbilities of the naval warfare of the future.\nOne result of my Fortnightly article was that General Henry Wil- 30\nson, late Chief of the Staff College as he then was, desired to see me to\ncross-question me, and a meeting was arranged at the house of Colonel\nSackville-West, Major Swinton being also present. There, after lunch-\neon, General Wilson machine-gunned me with questions for about an\nhour. He was fierce and explosive in his manner, and looked upon me, 35\nno doubt, as one of those pestilential laymen who insist upon talking\nof things they don\u2019t understand. As I could give reasons for my beliefs, I\nrefused to be squashed, and when the interview was over I went straight\n271 the eve of war\ndown to the Athen\u00e6um Club and wrote it all down from memory. It\nmakes such curious reading that I give it exactly as I reported it that day,\nin dialogue, with one or two comments from Colonel Sackville-West. Af-\nter saying with some asperity that I had made many statements which I\n5 could not substantiate, and so might give the public far too optimistic a\nview of the position, he said: \u2018Why do you say that we would never pay\nan indemnity to Germany?\u2019\nACD It is a matter of individual opinion. I go upon history and upon\nthe spirit of our people.\n10 GEN. W. Had not France equal spirit in 1870? How is it that they\npaid an indemnity?\nACD Because Germany was sitting on the top of them, and she had\nto pay to get from under.\nGEN. W. Why may she not sit on the top of us?\n15 ACD Because we live on an island and she cannot occupy us in the\nsame way.\nCOLONEL S.-W. I believe a little pressure on London would cause\nus to pay an indemnity.\nACD The man who suggested it would get hanged.\n20 MAJOR Sw. They would hang the man who made the war.\nACD No, they would back him but hang the traitor.\nGEN. W. You say that they would gain nothing by war. What about\nthe carrying trade of the world?\nACD The carrying trade depends on economic questions and upon\n25 geographical situation. For example, the Norwegians, who have no fleet,\nare one of the principal carriers.\nGEN. W. At least they could starve us out if they held the seas.\nACD Well, that is where my tunnel would come in; but of course I\nam entirely with you as to the need of holding the seas.\n30 GEN. W. Well, now, you admit that we must go to the help of France?\nACD Certainly.\nGEN. W. But what can six divisions do?\nACD Well, my point is that six divisions with a tunnel are better\nthan six divisions without a tunnel.\n35 MAJOR Sw. If we have a tunnel we must have a force worth sending\nto send through it.\nACD If you are going to couple the tunnel with compulsory service,\nyou will get neither one nor the other.\n272 chapter 26\nGEN. W. I think, so far as submarines go, that the British patrols\nwould make it a very desperate service. Some desperate man might get\nhis boat through.\nACD Some desperate man might command a flotilla and get it\nthrough. 5\nGEN. W. Many things seem possible theoretically which cannot be\ndone in practice, but no doubt there is a danger there. In your view the\nTerritorials are simply a support for the fighting Army?\nACD Yes.\nGEN. W. But they are too untrained to go into action. 10\nACD They would be reserves and have time to train.\nGEN. W. Your idea of troops coming back in case of a raid through\nthe tunnel is impossible. You could not withdraw troops in that way from\ntheir positions.\nACD Well, with all respect, I do not believe either in a raid or in an 15\ninvasion.\nGEN. W. A war with Germany would be short and sharp \u2013 seven\nmonths would see it finished.\nACD You mean, no doubt, the continental part. I could imagine the\nnaval part lasting ten years. 20\nCOLONEL S.-W. If your fleet was crushed, you would have to\ngive in.\nACD A fleet can never be annihilated as an army is. There always\nremain scattered forces which can go on fighting. I don\u2019t think we need\ngive in because the fleet is crushed. 25\nGEN. W. You don\u2019t suppose that the Englishman is a better soldier\nby nature than the Frenchman or the German?\nACD At least he is a volunteer.\nGEN. W. How would that affect the matter?\nACD I think he would rally better if he were beaten. There would be 30\nno end to his resistance, like the North in the American War.\nGEN. W. Don\u2019t you think, if war were declared with Germany, that\nthe public, fearing an invasion, would clamour against any regular troops\ngoing abroad at all?\nACD I think the public would leave it to the War Office. In the South 35\nAfrican War they allowed our troops to go 6,000 miles away, and yet there\nwas a danger of a European coalition.\nCOLONEL S.-W. But our Navy was supreme then.\n273 the eve of war\nACD Not against a coalition.\nGEN. W. When Cervera\u2019s fleet got loose, the Americans would not\nallow their troops to embark.\nMAJ. Sw. Even the Pacific coast was terrified.\n5 ACD Well, surely that is the reductio ad absurdum.\nMAJ. Sw. Still, the fact remains.\nGEN. W. If we could send fifteen divisions we could stop a war.\nACD But that means compulsory service.\nGEN. W. Why not?\n10 ACD Because I am convinced that you could not get it. I have twice\nstood for Parliament, and I am sure no candidate would have a chance on\nsuch a platform.\nGEN. W. Our descendants will say, \u2018Well, you saw the danger, and\nyet you made no effort.\u2019\n15 ACD Well, we have doubled our estimates. Surely that is an effort\nand must represent power somewhere.\nWe parted quite good friends, but the General\u2019s evident desire to\nrope me in as a compulsory-service man was vain. I venture to think that\nLord Roberts\u2019 efforts in that direction were a great mistake, and that if he\n20 had devoted the same great energy to the line of least resistance, which\nwas the Territorial force, we could have had half a million in the ranks\nwhen war broke out.\nFrom the time that I was convinced by my experiences at the Prince\nHenry race and by carefully reading German literature that a war was\n25 really brewing, I naturally began to speculate as to the methods of attack\nand of defence. I have an occasional power of premonition, psychic rath-\ner than intellectual, which exercises itself beyond my own control, and\nwhich when it really comes is never mistaken. The danger seems to be\nthat my own prejudice or reasonings may interfere with it. On this occa-\n30 sion I saw as clearly as possible what the course of a naval war between\nEngland and Germany would be. I had no doubt at all that our greatest\ndanger \u2013 a desperately real one \u2013 was that they would use their subma-\nrines in order to sink our food ships, and that we might be starved into\nsubmission. Even if we won every fleet action, this unseen enemy would\n35 surely bring us to our knees. It all worked out in exact detail in my mind \u2013\nso much so that Admiral Capelle mentioned my name afterwards in the\nReichstag, and said that only I had accurately seen the economic form\nwhich the war would assume. This was perhaps true, so far as the eco-\n274 chapter 26\nnomic side went, but Sir Percy Scott had spoken with far more authority\nthan I on the growing power of the submarines in warfare.\nI was made very uneasy by this line of thought, and all the more so\nbecause I asked several naval officers for some reassurance and could\nget none. One of them, I remember, said that it was all right because we 5\nshould put a boom across the Channel, which seemed to me like saying\nthat you could keep eels from going down a river by laying a plank across\nit. Among others I spoke to Captain Beatty, as he then was, whom I met\nat a weekend party at Knole, and though he could give me no reassurance\nabout submarines he impressed me by his vivid and alert personality, and 10\nI felt that a Navy with such men in command was safe enough where\nfighting was concerned. It could not, however, fill the platter if there was\nno loaf to place upon it. I pondered the matter, and could only see three\npalliatives, and no cure.\nThe first was to encourage home growth by a bonus or by a tariff. But 15\nhere our accursed party politics barred the way, as I had learned only too\nclearly after spending a thousand pounds in fighting the Hawick Burghs\nin order to get some form of agricultural protection.\nThe second was to meet submarines by submarine food-carriers. I\nthink that this may prove the final solution, but the ships were not yet 20\nplanned, far less launched.\nThe third and most obvious was the Channel Tunnel, or tunnels for\npreference. I had supported this scheme for years, and felt that as a nation\nwe had made fools of ourselves over it, exactly as we did over the Suez\nCanal. If we were an island the size of the Wight such timidity would be 25\nintelligible, but the idea of a great country being invaded through a hole\nin the ground twenty-seven miles long seemed to me the most fantas-\ntic possible, while the practical use of the tunnel both for trade and for\ntourists was obvious. But now I saw that far more serious issues were\nat stake, for if we were held up by submarines, and if France was either 30\nneutral or our ally, we could land all the Eastern portion of our supplies,\nwhich is not inconsiderable, at Marseilles and so run them safely to Lon-\ndon without breaking bulk. When I put this forward in the press some\nmilitary critic said: \u2018But if the submarines could hold up the Channel\nthey could hold up the Mediterranean also.\u2019 This did not seem a good 35\nargument, because Germany was the possible enemy and it had no port\nin the Mediterranean, while the radius of submarine action at that time\nwas not great enough to allow them to come so far. So strongly did I feel\n275 the eve of war\nabout the need for a Channel Tunnel in view of the coming war that I re-\nmember writing three memoranda and sending one to the Army, one to\nthe Navy, and one to the Council of Imperial Defence. Of course I got no\nsatisfaction of any kind, but Captain \u2013 now General \u2013 Swinton, who was\n5 acting as secretary to the latter body, told me that he had read my paper\nand that it had \u2018set him furiously thinking.\u2019 I wrote to Lord Northcliffe\nalso, without avail. I felt as if, like Solomon Eagle, I could go through\nLondon with a burning brazier on my head, if I could only get people to\nunderstand the need of the tunnel. The whole discussion had taken the\n10 utterly impossible and useless turn towards compulsory service, and the\nthings which were practical and vital were being missed.\nI spoke in public about the tunnel when I could, and on one occa-\nsion, just a year before the war, I raised a discussion in The Times, Mr.\nRonald McNeill giving me an opening by declaring in the House that the\n15 project was a crazy one. There was also about that time a meeting in the\nCity at the Cannon Street Hotel, where a very influential body of men\nsupported the scheme. My speech, as reported next day in The Times in a\nvery condensed form, ran thus:\n\u2018Sir A. Conan Doyle said there were possibilities in a future war that\n20 rendered it a matter of vital national importance that the tunnel should\nbe constructed without delay. The danger was that we were getting five-\nsixths of our food supplies from abroad, and submarine craft were de-\nveloping remarkable qualities which were not generally realized. They\nwere able to avoid a blockade squadron, and to pass under a patrol line of\n25 torpedo-boats without their existence being even suspected. If they were\nsent to the line of our commerce and told to sink a ship, they would tor-\npedo that ship for a certainty. What would be the condition of our food\nsupplies if there were twenty-five hostile submarines off the Kent coast\nand twenty-five in the Irish Channel? The price of food would reach an\n30 almost prohibitive figure. The Military Correspondent of The Times was\na great opponent of the Channel Tunnel and was always running it down\nand mocking at it. But the other day he wrote an article on the Mediterra-\nnean, and, forgetting the Channel Tunnel, he said: \u201cWe must remember\nthat more than half the food supply of this country now comes from the\n35 Mediterranean.\u201d If it came through the Mediterranean, and if it got to\nMarseilles and we had the Channel Tunnel, it was only a matter of man-\nagement to get it through to London.\u2019\nThe Military Correspondent of The Times, who was presumably\n276 chapter 26\nColonel Repington, had an article next day deriding the scheme, and\nmaking light of my picture of submarines in the Channel. Well, we have\nlived to see them, and I wish my argument had proved less sound. Colo-\nnel Repington has proved himself so clear-sighted an observer and com-\nmentator in the last war that he can be forgiven if, for once, he was on the 5\nwrong side; but if the Channel Tunnel had been put in hand at once after\nthat meeting and rushed to completion, I wonder if it would be an exag-\ngeration to say that a hundred million pounds would have been saved,\nwhile what it would have meant in evacuating wounded and in commu-\nnications in stormy weather could not be represented in words. Imagine 10\nthe convenience and saving of time and labour when munitions could be\nstarted at Woolwich and landed at Amiens without a break.\nIt has been argued that if the tunnel had been built the first swoop of\nthe Germans would have brought them to the end of it and it would have\nbeen destroyed. But this will not bear examination, for it is based on the 15\nidea that we should have left the end unprotected. It would as a matter\nof fact have been the most natural fortress in the world, the strongest\nand the strangest, for it would be the only fortress where you could in-\ncrease or withdraw your garrison at will, and introduce any supplies at\nany time you might desire. A very few forts and trenches on those con- 20\nvenient chalk slopes with their wide, smooth fields of fire, would hold the\ntunnel. In stretching their right wing as far as Amiens the Germans were\nvery nearly cut off, and it was by a very great effort that Von Kluck saved\nit. If instead of Amiens he had reached Calais with sufficient forces for a\nsiege he would have been unable to get away. An argument based upon 25\nthe supposition that we should leave the mouth of the tunnel in Picardy\nas unprotected as the mouth of a coal mine in Kent is surely an unsound\none. Now they are talking of building the tunnel. I wonder what our de-\nscendants will think of the whole business \u2013 probably what we think of\nthe men who opposed the Suez Canal. 30\nIt is a most singular thing that our Navy, with so many practical and\nclever men in it, with a genius like Winston Churchill at the head, and\nanother genius like Lord Fisher in continual touch, did not realize, until\nfaced with actual results, some of the most important and surely most\nobvious points in connection with naval warfare. It came, I suppose, 35\nfrom the iron bonds of tradition, and that there were so many things to\nsupervise, but the fact remains that a perfectly overwhelming case could\nbe made out against the higher brain department of our senior service. A\n277 the eve of war\nwar with Germany was anticipated, and, as the public imagined, was pre-\npared for, but save for the ship-building programme, which left us a nar-\nrow margin of safety, and for the concentration of our distant squadrons\ninto British waters and the elimination of many useless craft which con-\n5 sumed good crews, what evidence is there of foresight? It was known, for\nexample, that Scapa Flow and Cromarty were the two possible anchorag-\nes of the Fleet in a long-distance blockade, and yet no attempt had been\nmade to mount guns or to net the entrances, so that for months there\nwas a possibility of a shattering disaster; and Jellicoe, with the prudence\n10 which always distinguished him, had to put to sea every night lest his\nfleet should present a sitter to a torpedo attack. We showed intelligence\nin sticking always to the heavier guns, but our mines were wretchedly\ninefficient, our range-finders were very inferior, and our shells proved to\nhave less penetrating and explosive force.\n15 But the worst thing of all was the utter want of imagination shown in\npicturing the conditions of modern naval warfare, which must surely be\ndone before just preparation can be made. It was clear that the effect of\narmour protection on one side, and of the mine and the torpedo on the\nother, would mean that if the ship floated there would be little loss of life,\n20 but that she was very likely to sink, in which case the whole crew would\ngo. Therefore provision must be made for the saving of everyone on\nboard. The authorities, however, seem to have completely underrated the\ndangers of the mine and torpedo, and centred their attention upon the\nsurface naval action, where boats, being inflammable, would be a danger\n25 and where in any case they would probably be shot to pieces before the\nend of the fight. The pre-war idea was to throw the boats and every other\nwooden object overboard before the action began.\nThe very first day of naval warfare showed the importance of the\nmine, as on August 5 the Germans laid a minefield outside the mouth\n30 of the Thames which nearly blew up their own returning Ambassador,\nPrince Lichnowsky, and did actually cause the destruction of one of our\nlight vessels, the Amphion. It was clear that one of the great dangers of the\nsea lay in this direction, and it soon became equally clear that nothing had\nbeen done to think out some defence. Foresight would have anticipated\n35 this situation and would have set the brains of the younger naval officers\nat work devising some remedy. As a matter of fact the real solution had\nbeen roughly indicated by Colonel Repington in Blackwood\u2019s Magazine\nsome four years before, in which he spoke of a device called \u2018the otter\u2019\n278 chapter 26\nused by poachers for gathering up lines, and suggested that something\nof the sort would gather up the lines to which mines are attached. Af-\nter three years of war, and very many preventable losses, including the\ngreat battleship Audacious, the splendid auxiliary cruiser Laurentic with\nsix millions in gold on board, and many other fine vessels, the cure was 5\nfound in the paravane, which was an adaptation of \u2018the otter.\u2019 After its\nadoption ships could cruise over a minefield with little fear of injury, and\nour squadrons were no longer confined to the narrow lanes which had\nbeen swept clear.\nI was from the beginning greatly impressed by this danger, and I 10\nwrote early in the war both to the papers and the Admiralty, but my de-\nvice was crude and clumsy compared to what was actually done. My idea\nwas something like a huge trident or toasting fork which could be hauled\nup on the bows when the waters were safe, but could be pushed forward\nand dip down in front when there was danger, so as to explode any mine 15\nbefore the ship could actually reach it. Such an apparatus would be better\nthan nothing, but still I quite admit that it was an inadequate solution of\nthe problem. But at least it was an attempt \u2013 and no other attempt was\nvisible for years afterwards.\nBut the particular instance of mines was a small consideration beside 20\nthe huge permanent incredible fact that while it was clear that a battle-\nship could suddenly go down like a kettle with a hole in it, dragging a\nthousand men down with it, there was no provision by which the lives\nof these men could be saved. It was really unbelievable until there came\nthe terrible example when the three cruisers, Hogue, Aboukir, and Cressy, 25\nwere all put down in a single day. A young German lieutenant with twen-\nty men had caused us more loss than we suffered at Trafalgar. To learn\nhow the helpless men had nowhere to turn, and how they clung on to\nfloating petrol tins as their only safety, should have been terrible reading\nto those whose want of foresight had brought about such a situation. It 30\nwas a dreadful object-lesson, and there seemed no reason why it should\nnot be often repeated. I had already commented in the press upon the sit-\nuation which would arise in a general action, with ships sinking all round\nand no boats. I suggested that it might be possible to drop the boats be-\nfore battle and to have them in tow of a steam launch which could bring 35\nthem up if needed. Of course I saw all the difficulties and dangers of such\na course, but if one took the word of the sailors that the boats were a\ndanger on board then I could think of no other way of working it. When\n279 the eve of war\nI wrote about it, several naval critics, notably Commander Jane, rapped\nme hard over the knuckles, and deplored the intrusion of landsmen into\nmatters of which they knew nothing. But when this great catastrophe oc-\ncurred, I realized that the protection must be individual rather than col-\n5 lective, and that one must ventilate the thing in public with such warmth\nthat the authorities would be compelled to do something. If wooden\nboats were impossible, what about indiarubber collars which would at\nleast hold the poor fellows above the waves until some help could reach\nthem? I opened an agitation in several papers, notably the Daily Mail and\n10 the Daily Chronicle, and within a very few days \u2013 either post hoc or propter\nhoc \u2013 there was a rush order for a quarter of a million collars which could\nbe blown out by the men themselves, and which were henceforth to be\npart of their vital equipment. The Hampshire Telegraph, the best informed\nof naval papers, said:\n15 \u2018The Navy has to thank Sir Conan Doyle for the new life-saving ap-\nparatus the Admiralty are supplying. Some weeks ago he asked if it was\nnot possible to manufacture a simple and easily inflatable life-belt, and,\nthanks to the enterprise of a rubber-manufacturing firm, a swimming\ncollar is now being supplied to the men of the fleet in the North Sea as\n20 fast as they can be turned out. The apparatus is exceedingly simple. It is\nmade of rubber, enclosed in a stout web casing, and weighs complete\nunder three ounces. It can be carried in the pocket and can be inflated in\nposition round a man\u2019s neck in about ten seconds. Its effect is to keep the\nman\u2019s head above water indefinitely. There is little doubt that this swim-\n25 ming collar will result in the saving of many lives, and the Admiralty are\nto be congratulated upon the promptitude with which they have adopted\nthe suggestion of Sir Conan Doyle.\u2019\nI was by no means satisfied with this, however; for, however useful\nin calm water on a summer day, it was clear that men would soon perish\n30 by exhaustion in a rough winter sea, and the collars would only prolong\ntheir agony. If wooden boats took up too much room and were inflamma-\nble, how about indiarubber collapsible boats? I wrote in the Daily Mail:\n\u2018We can spare and replace the ships. We cannot spare the men. They\nmust be saved, and this is how to save them. There is nothing so urgent as\n35 this. We can view all future disasters with equanimity if the ship\u2019s compa-\nny has only a fair chance for its life.\u2019 Of course one recognized that there\nwere some situations where nothing would avail. The Formidable was a\ncase in point, which was torpedoed near Plymouth on January 1, 1915.\n280 chapter 26\nCaptain Miller, of the Brixham trawler which rescued seventy men, said\nto the Daily Mail representative that I was doing a national work in my\nefforts to get better life-saving appliances for the men of the Navy. He\nremarked that in calm weather collapsible boats would be of use, but they\ncould not possibly have lived in the seas which were breaking over the 5\nFormidable\u2019s whaler. The weather here was exceptional, and one cannot\nhope to provide for every case.\nThe final result of the agitation was the provision of collars, of safety\nwaistcoats, and (as I believe) of a better supply of boats. I need hardly\nsay that I never received a word of acknowledgment or thanks from the 10\nAdmiralty. One is not likely to be thanked by a Government department\nfor supplementing its work. But it may be that some poor seaman strug-\ngling in the water sent me his good wish, and those are the thanks that\nI desired. There was nothing in the war which moved me more than the\nthought of the helpless plight of these gallant men who were sacrificed 15\nwhen they could so easily have been saved.\nLike every man with Irish blood in his veins, I was deeply moved by\nthe tragedy of Ireland during the war \u2013 her fine start, the want of tact with\nwhich it was met, her sad relapse, and finally her failure to rise to the great\nworld crisis. 20\nA letter which I value very much is one which I received from Major\nWilliam Redmond just before his lamented death. What an abyss of evil\nIreland would have been saved from had the spirit of this letter been the\ninspiration upon which she acted!\n25\n18.12.16.\ndear sir arthur conan doyle, \u2013\nIt was very good of you to write to me and I value very much the 30\nexpression of your opinion. There are a great many Irishmen to-day\nwho feel that out of this War we should try and build up a new\nIreland. The trouble is men are so timid about meeting each other\nhalf-way. It would be a fine memorial to the men who have died so\nsplendidly, if we could over their graves build up a bridge between 35\nthe North and South. I have been thinking a lot about this lately in\nFrance \u2013 no one could help doing so when one finds that the two\nsections from Ireland are actually side by side holding the trenches!\n281 the eve of war\nNo words \u2013 not even your own \u2013 could do justice to the splendid\naction of the new Irish soldiers. They never have flinched. They\nnever give trouble, and they are steady and sober. Had poor Kettle\nlived he would have given the world a wonderful account of things\n5 out there. I saw a good deal of Kettle, and we had many talks of the\nUnity we both hoped would come out of the War. I have been an\nextreme Nationalist all my life, and if others as extreme, perhaps, on\nthe other side will only come half-way, then I believe, impossible as\nit may seem, we should be able to hit upon a plan to satisfy the Irish\n10 sentiment and the Imperial sentiment at one and the same time. I\nam sure you can do very much, as you already have done, in this di-\nrection. I am going back for Christmas with the men I have become\nattached very deeply to during the last two years.\n15 With many thanks for your letter,\nYours very truly,\nwilliam redmond.\nMajor.\n20 If this letter, even now, were posted up by the Free State and North-\nern Governments at every cross-roads of Ireland the spirit of Willie Red-\nmond might heal the wounds of the unhappy country.\n282 Chapter 27\nA REMEMBRANCE OF THE DARK YEARS\nNightmares of the Morning \u2013 The Civilian Reserve \u2013 The Volunteers \u2013 5\nDomestic Life in War Time \u2013 German Prisoners \u2013 Cipher to our Prisoners \u2013\nSir John French \u2013 Empress Eugenie \u2013 Miracle Town \u2013 Armour \u2013 Our Tragedy.\nI can never forget, and our descendants can never imagine, the strange\neffect upon the mind which was produced by seeing the whole European 10\nfabric drifting to the edge of the chasm with absolute uncertainty as to\nwhat would happen when it toppled over. Military surprises, starvation,\nrevolution, bankruptcy \u2013 no one knew what so unprecedented an epi-\nsode would produce. It was all so evidently preventable, and yet it was\nso madly impossible to prevent it, for the Prussians had stuck their mon- 15\nkey-wrench into the machinery and it would no longer work. As a rule\none has wild dreams and wakes to sanity, but on those mornings I left\nsanity when I woke and found myself in a world of nightmare dreams.\nOn August 4, when war seemed assured, I had a note from Mr. Gold-\nsmith, a plumber in the village: \u2018There is a feeling in Crowborough that 20\nsomething should be done.\u2019 This made me laugh at first, but presently I\nthought more seriously of it. After all, Crowborough was one of a thou-\nsand villages, and we might be planning and acting for all. Therefore I had\nnotices rapidly printed. I distributed them and put them at road corners,\nand the same evening (August 4) we held a village meeting and started 25\nthe Volunteers, a force which soon grew to 200,000 men.\nThe old Volunteers had become extinct when the Territorials had\nbeen organised some ten or twelve years before. But this new force which\nI conceived was to be a universal one, where every citizen, young and old,\nshould be trained to arms \u2013 a great stockpot into which the nation could 30\ndip and draw its needs. We named ourselves the Civilian Reserve. No\none, I reflected, could be the worse in such days for being able to drill and\nto shoot, or for being assembled in organized units. Government was too\npreoccupied to do anything, and we must show initiative for ourselves.\nAfter I had propounded my scheme, I signed the roll myself, and 120 35\nmen signed after me. Those were the first men in the Volunteer Force.\nNext evening we assembled at the drill-hall, found out who could drill us,\nchose our non-commissioned officers and set to work to form ourselves\n283 a remembrance of the dark years\ninto an efficient company. Gillette, my American actor friend, had got\nstranded in England, and he was an interested spectator on this occasion.\nFor the time being I took command.\nI had notified the War Office what we had done and asked for official\n5 sanction. We were careful not to stand in the way of recruiting and deter-\nmined to admit none who could reasonably join up at once. When the\nplan began to work I wrote a description of our methods to The Times.\nAs a consequence I received requests for our rules and methods from\n1,200 towns and villages. My secretary and I worked all day getting these\n10 off, and in many cases the inquiries led to the formation of similar com-\npanies.\nFor about a fortnight all went well. We drilled every day, though we\nhad no weapons. At the end of that time there came a peremptory order\nfrom the War Office: \u2018All unauthorized bodies to be at once disbanded.\u2019\n15 Unquestioning and cheerful obedience is the first law in time of war. The\ncompany was on parade. I read out the telegram and then said: \u2018Right\nturn! Dismiss!\u2019 With this laconic order the Civilian Reserve dissolved\nfor ever.\nBut it had a speedy and glorious resurrection. There was a central\n20 body in London with some remote connection with the old Volunteer\nForce. Lord Desborough was chairman of this, and there could not have\nbeen a better man. The Government put the formation of a Volunteer\nForce into the charge of this committee, to which I was elected. Mr. Percy\nHarris was the secretary and showed great energy. I wrote to all the 1,200\n25 applicants referring them to this new centre, and we, the Crowborough\nbody, now became the Crowborough Company of the Sixth Royal Sus-\nsex Volunteer Regiment. That we were the first company in the country\nwas shown by the Volunteer Gazette when a prize was awarded for this\ndistinction. Under its new shape Captain St. Quintin, who had been a\n30 soldier, became our leader, and Mr. Gresson and Mr. Druce, both of them\nfamous cricketers, our lieutenants. Goldsmith was one of the sergeants,\nand I remained a full private for four years of war, and an extra half-year\nbefore we were demobilized. Our ranks fluctuated, for as the age limit of\nservice gradually rose we passed many men into the regular Army, but we\n35 filled up with new recruits, and we were always about a hundred strong.\nOur drill and discipline were excellent, and when we received our rifles\nand bayonets we soon learned to use them, nor were our marching pow-\ners contemptible when one remembers that many of the men were in\n284 chapter 27\nthe fifties and even in the sixties. It was quite usual for us to march from\nCrowborough to Frant, with our rifles and equipment, to drill for a long\nhour in a heavy marshy field, and then to march back, singing all the way.\nIt would be a good 14 miles, apart from the drill.\nI have very pleasant recollections of that long period of service. I 5\nlearned to know my neighbours who stood in the same ranks, and I hope\nthat they also learned to know me as they could not otherwise. We had\nfrequent camps, field days and inspections. On one occasion 8,000 of\nus were assembled, and I am bound to say that I have never seen a finer\nbody of men, though they were rather of the police-constable than of 10\nthe purely military type. The spirit was excellent, and I am sure that if\nwe had had our chance we should have done well in action. But it was\nhard to know how to get the chance save in case of invasion. We were the\nremaining pivots of national life, and could only be spared for short peri-\nods or chaos would follow. But a week or two in case of invasion was well 15\nwithin our powers, and such a chance would have been eagerly hailed.\nNo doubt our presence enabled the Government to strip the country\nof regular troops far more than they would have dared otherwise to do.\nTwice, as Repington\u2019s Memoirs show, there was a question of embodying\nus for active service, but in each case the emergency passed. 20\nI found the life of a private soldier a delightful one. To be led and not\nto lead was most restful, and so long as one\u2019s thoughts were bounded\nby the polishing of one\u2019s buttons and buckles, or the cleansing of one\u2019s\nrifle, one was quietly happy. In that long period I shared every phase\nof my companions\u2019 life. I have stood in the queue with my pannikin to 25\nget a welcome drink of beer, and I have slept in a bell-tent on a summer\nnight with a Sussex yokel blissfully snoring upon each of my shoulders.\nSometimes amusing situations arose. I remember a new adjutant arriv-\ning and reviewing us. When he got opposite to me in his inspection, his\neyes were caught by my South African medal. \u2018You have seen service, my 30\nman,\u2019 said he. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 I answered. He was a little cocky fellow who might\nwell have been my son so far as age went. When he had passed down the\nline, he said to our C.O., St. Quintin: \u2018Who is that big fellow on the right\nof the rear rank?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s Sherlock Holmes,\u2019 said C.O. \u2018Good Lord!\u2019 said\nthe adjutant, \u2018I hope he does not mind my \u201cMy manning\u201d him!\u2019 \u2018He just 35\nloves it,\u2019 said St. Quintin, which showed that he knew me.\nThe other big factor which covered the whole period of the war, and\nsome time after it, was my writing the History of the European campaign,\n285 a remembrance of the dark years\nwhich I published volume by volume under the name of The British Cam-\npaign in France and Flanders. My information was particularly good, for\nI had organized a very extensive correspondence with the generals, who\nwere by no means anxious for self-advertisement, but were, on the other\n5 hand, very keen that the deeds of their particular troops should have full\njustice done them. In this way I was able to be the first to describe in\nprint the full battle-line with all the divisions, and even brigades in their\ncorrect places from Mons onwards to the last fight before the Armistice.\nWhen I think what a fuss was made in the old days when any Corre-\n10 spondent got the account of a single Colonial battle before his comrades,\nit is amazing to me that hardly a single paper ever commented, in review-\ning these six successive volumes, upon the fact that I was really the only\npublic source of supply of accurate and detailed information. I can only\nsuppose that they could not believe it to be true. I had no help but only\n15 hindrance from the War Office, and everything I got was by means which\nwere equally open to anyone else who took the trouble to organize them.\nOf course, I was bowdlerized and blue-pencilled by censors, but still the\nfact remains that a dozen great battle-lines were first charted by me. I\nhave since read the official account so far as it has gone, and find little\n20 to change in my own, though the German and French records are now\navailable to broaden the picture. For the moment war literature is out\nof fashion, and my war history, which reflects all the passion and pain\nof those hard days, has never come into its own. I would reckon it the\ngreatest and most undeserved literary disappointment of my life if I did\n25 not know that the end is not yet and that it may mirror those great times\nto those who are to come.\nFor the rest I had a great deal of literary propaganda work to do. Once\nit was the To Arms! pamphlet written in conjunction with Mr. Smith,\nsoon to become Lord Birkenhead. Once again it was an appeal for our ill-\n30 used prisoners. Sometimes Norway, sometimes South America, always\nthe United States, needed treatment. As to my special missions, those I\ntreat in separate chapters.\nThere are many small but very important details of domestic life dur-\ning the war which have never been properly described, and could indeed\n35 best be described by a woman, for they were usually an invasion of her\ndepartment. Our descendants will never realize how we were all regis-\ntered and docketed and rationed, so that the State could give the least\nto and take the most from each of us. One had food-cards for practically\n286 chapter 27\neverything, and the card only entitled you to get your meagre portion if\nit was to be had. Often it wasn\u2019t. I have been at a great lunch with half the\ngrandees of the land, and the Prime Minister to speak. The fare was Irish\nstew and rice-pudding.\nWhat could man ask for more, but it will need another war to bring it 5\nround again. There was a pleasing uncertainty about all meals. There was\nalways a sense of adventure and a wonder whether you would really get\nsomething. It all made for appetite. Then there were the darkened win-\ndows, the sharp knocking of the police if the blind emitted any light, the\nvexatious summons for very small offences, the pulling down of every 10\nblind on the railway trains. At night one never knew what evil bird was\nflying overhead or what foul egg would be dropped. Once, as we sat in\nthe theatre at Eastbourne, the whirr of a Zeppelin was heard above us.\nHalf the audience slipped out, the lights were put out, and the play was\nfinished with candles on the stage. When I was lecturing in London the 15\nsame thing happened, and I finished my lecture in the dark.\nEveryone found themselves doing strange things. I was not only a\nprivate in the Volunteers, but I was a signaller and I was for a time num-\nber one of a machine gun. My wife started a home for Belgian refugees\nin Crowborough. My son was a soldier, first, last, and all the time. My 20\ndaughter Mary gave herself up altogether to public work, making shells\nat Vickers\u2019 and afterwards serving in a canteen. If I may quote a passage\nfrom my history: \u2018Grotesque combinations resulted from the eagerness\nof all classes to lend a hand. An observer has described how a peer and\na prize-fighter worked on the same bench at Woolwich, while titled la- 25\ndies and young girls from cultured homes earned sixteen shillings a week\nat Erith and boasted in the morning of the number of shell-cases which\nthey had turned and finished in their hours of night-shift. Truly it had\nbecome a national war. Of all its memories none will be stranger than\nthose of the peaceful middle-aged civilians who were seen eagerly read- 30\ning books of elementary drill in order to prepare themselves to meet the\nmost famous soldiers in Europe, or of the schoolgirls and matrons who\ndonned blue blouses and by their united work surpassed the output of\nthe great death factories of Essen.\u2019\nEvery house had its vegetable garden and every poor man his allot- 35\nment, that we might at the worst exist until we could win our peace. The\nwant of sugar and the limitation of tea were the worst privations. My\nwife, greatly helped by a faithful servant, Jakeman, did wonders in saving\n287 a remembrance of the dark years\nfood, and we always lived well within our legal rations. This did not save\nus once from a police raid, because some tea, sent us as a present from\nIndia, had arrived. We had already distributed a good deal of it, however,\nto our less fortunate neighbours, so we came well out of the matter.\n5 I have one singular memory in having to guard German prisoners at\nwork. The Volunteers had a turn at this work, and we spent the night at\nLewes Prison. In the early morning, dark and misty, we were mustered,\nand five prisoners handed over to each of us. Mine worked on a farm\nsome four miles from the town, and thither I had to march them, walk-\n10 ing behind them with my rifle on my shoulder. When I had reached the\nlonely country road, I thought I would get into human touch with these\npoor slouching wretches, who were still in their stained grey uniforms,\nand wearing their service caps with the bright red bands which formed\na wonderful advertisement of the excellence of German dyes. I halted\n15 them, drew them up, and asked them their nationality. Three were from\nWurtemburg and two from Prussia. I asked the Wurtemburgers how long\nthey had been prisoners. They said, \u2018Fourteen months.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said I, \u2018you\nwere taken by the Canadians at Ypres upon such and such a date.\u2019 They\nwere considerably astonished, since I was simply a second-line Tommy\n20 from their point of view. Of course, I had the details of the war very clear-\nly in my mind, and I knew that our one big haul of Wurtemburgers had\nbeen on that occasion. To this day they must wonder how I knew. I shall\nnot forget that day, for I stood for eight hours leaning on a rifle, amid\ndrizzling rain, while in a little gap of the mist I watched those men load-\n25 ing carts with manure. I can answer for it that they were excellent work-\ners, and they seemed civil, tractable fellows as well.\nIt was in 1915 that I managed to establish a secret correspondence\nwith the British prisoners at Magdeburg. It was not very difficult to\ndo, and I dare say others managed it as well as I, but it had the effect of\n30 cheering them by a little authentic news, for at that time they were only\npermitted to see German newspapers. It came about in this way. A dear\nfriend of my wife\u2019s, Miss Lily Loder Symonds, had a brother, Captain\nWillie Loder Symonds, of the Wiltshires, who had been wounded and\ntaken in the stand of the 7th Brigade on the evening before Le Cateau.\n35 He was an ingenious fellow and had written home a letter which passed\nthe German censor, because it seemed to consist in the description of a\nfarm, but when read carefully it was clear that it was the conditions of\nhimself and his comrades which he was discussing. It seemed to me that\n288 chapter 27\nif a man used such an artifice he would be prepared for a similar one in a\nletter from home. I took one of my books, therefore, and beginning with\nthe third chapter \u2013 I guessed the censor would examine the first \u2013 I put\nlittle needle-pricks under the various printed letters until I had spelled\nout all the news. I then sent the book and also a letter. In the letter I said 5\nthat the book was, I feared, rather slow in the opening, but that from\nChapter III onwards he might find it more interesting. That was as plain\nas I dared to make it. Loder Symonds missed the allusion altogether, but\nby good luck he showed the letter to Captain the Hon. Rupert Keppel,\nof the Guards, who had been taken at Landrecies. He smelled a rat, bor- 10\nrowed the book, and found my cipher. A message came back to his father,\nLord Albemarle, to the effect that he hoped Conan Doyle would send\nsome more books. This was sent on to me, and of course showed me that\nit was all right. From that time onwards every month or two I pricked off\nmy bulletin, and a long job it was. Finally, I learned that the British pa- 15\npers were allowed for the prisoners, so that my budget was superfluous.\nHowever, for a year or two I think it was some solace to them, for I always\nmade it as optimistic as truth would allow \u2013 or perhaps a little more so,\njust to get the average right.\nI had some dealings with General French, but only one interview 20\nwith him. No one can help feeling a deep respect for the soldier who\nrelieved Kimberley and headed off Cronje, or for the man who bore the\nfirst hard thrust of the German spear.\nMy only interview with the General was at the Horse Guards, when\nhe talked very clearly about the military position, though most of what he 25\nsaid as to the changes which modern tactics and heavy guns had caused\nwas rather self-evident. \u2018Your problem always is how to pass the wire and\nthe machine guns. There is no way round. What is the good of talking\nof invading Austria from the south? You will find the same wire and the\nsame machine guns. We may as well face it in Flanders as anywhere else.\u2019 30\nThis talk was shortly after Loos, when he had returned from the Army\nand was at the head of Home Defence. \u2018If you want any point looked\nup for your history, mind you let me know and I will see that it is done.\u2019\nThis sounded very nice to me, who was in a perpetual state of wanting to\nknow; but as a matter of fact I took it as a mere empty phrase, and so it 35\nproved when a week or two later I put it to the test. It was a simple ques-\ntion, but I never got any clear answer.\nOne pleasing incident occurred in 1917, when a Hull steam trawl-\n289 a remembrance of the dark years\ner which had been named after me, under the able handling of Skipper\nAddy and Lieutenant McCabe of the Naval Reserve, had an action with\na heavily armed modern submarine, the fight lasting for some hours.\nThe Conan Doyle was acting as flagship of a little group of trawlers, and\n5 though their guns were popguns compared with that of the German,\nthey so peppered him that he was either sunk or took flight \u2013 anyhow, he\nvanished under the water. The little boat sent me its ship\u2019s bell as a sou-\nvenir of the exploit, and I sent some small remembrances in exchange.\nIt was a fine exploit, and I was proud to be connected with it, even in so\n10 remote a way.\nI have in my war chapters expressed my admiration for General Haig.\nOn one occasion I called upon Lady Haig, when she was administering\nsome private hospital at Farnborough. It was, so far as I could under-\nstand, one wing of the Empress Eugenie\u2019s house, and the Empress in-\n15 vited me to lunch. There were present also Prince Victor Napoleon and\nhis wife, who was, I think, a daughter of my old aversion, Leopold, King\nof the Belgians and Overlord of the Congo. The Empress interested me\ndeeply \u2013 a historical relic whom one would expect to study in old pic-\ntures and memoirs, yet there she was moving and talking before me. If\n20 Helen launched a thousand ships, Eugenie, by all accounts, did far more.\nIndeed, if the first German War was really from her inspiration, as Zola\ninsists, she was at the root of all modern history. In spite of her great age,\nher face and figure preserved the lines of elegance and breed, the fea-\ntures clearly cut, the head set proudly upon the long neck. I glanced into\n25 her sitting-room as I passed the open door and noticed that she was en-\ngaged upon an enormous jig-saw puzzle, a thousand pieces if there were\none. Children\u2019s toys engaged the mind which once played with Empires.\nThere is surely something fatal in that Spanish blood with its narrow fa-\nnatical religion and its masterful intolerance, magnificent but medi\u00e6val\n30 like the Church which inspires it.\nShe talked very freely with me and in the most interesting manner.\nIt was surprising to see how fresh her mind was, and what curious infor-\nmation she had at her command. She told me, for example, that tetanus\nin France depended very much upon what soil had got into the wound,\n35 while that in turn depended upon what manures had been used for the\nsoil \u2013 thus the percentage of tetanus cases would be quite different in a\nvine-growing district and in one where ordinary crops were cultivated.\nShe spoke seriously about the war, but was confident as to the ultimate\n290 chapter 27\nresult. This graceful, withered flower in its strange setting was one of the\noutstanding memories of those days.\nAll sorts of queer odd jobs came to me as to many others in the war. I\nwas, of course, prepared always to do absolutely anything which was sug-\ngested, though the suggestions were sometimes not very reasonable. One 5\nmust not argue, but simply put one\u2019s whole weight, for what it is worth,\ninto the scrum. Once I was directed to go up to Scotland and write up the\ngreat new munition works at Gretna, as the public needed reassurance\nupon the point. Pearson, the younger brother of Lord Cowdray, had built\nthem, and they certainly deserved the name of \u2018Miracle Town,\u2019 which I 10\ngave them in my article. The great difficulty always was to give our own\npeople what they wanted and yet not to give the Germans that which\nthey wanted also. Winston Churchill\u2019s remarkable memoirs \u2013 the best, in\nmy opinion, of all the war books \u2013 have shown how heavily this pressed\nin high quarters. His volume is certainly a wonderful vindication of his 15\nterm of office, and it was a loss to the country when he left it.\nChurchill was very open to ideas and sympathetic to those who were\ntrying for some ideal. I had pondered much over armour for the troops,\nand he commented on it in an inspiring letter, in which he said that the\nbullet-proof man and the torpedo-proof ship were our two great objects. 20\nI worked a good deal upon the question of shields, and wrote several\narticles about it in The Times and other papers, but the forces against us\nwere strong. When I saw Mr. Montague on the subject at the Ministry\nof Munitions, he said: \u2018Sir Arthur, there is no use your arguing here, for\nthere is no one in the building who does not know that you are right. The 25\nwhole difficulty lies in making the soldiers accept your views.\u2019\nOne has, of course, to be reasonable on the point, and to admit that\nthere is a limit to what a man can carry, and that greater weight means\nslower movement, and therefore longer exposure. That is fully granted.\nBut when the helmet in actual practice was found so useful, why should 30\nit not be supplemented by steel shoulder-guards, since the helmet might\nactually guide the bullets down on to the shoulders? And why not a plas-\ntron over the heart? The vital points in a man\u2019s anatomy are not really so\nnumerous. If many a life was saved by a buckle or a cigarette-case, why\nshould such protection not be systematized? And why in trench war- 35\nfare should not strong breastplates be kept for the temporary use of any\ntroops in the front line? I experimented with my own service rifle upon\nsteel plates, and I was surprised to find how easy it was at twenty paces\n291 a remembrance of the dark years\nto turn a bullet. I am convinced that very many lives would have been\nsaved had my views been adopted, and that the men in the hour of dan-\nger would have been only too glad to carry that part of their equipment.\nThe Tank, however, was a device which carried the armour and\n5 the men also, so that it was an extension of these ideas. We can never\nbe grateful enough to the men who thought out the Tank, for I have no\ndoubt at all that this product of British brains and British labour won the\nwar, which would otherwise have ended in a peace of mutual exhaustion.\nChurchill, D\u2019Eyncourt, Tritton, Swinton and Bertie Stern, \u2013 these were\n10 in sober fact, divide the credit as you may, the men who played a very\nessential part in bringing down the giant.\nOur household suffered terribly in the war. The first to fall was my\nwife\u2019s brother Malcolm Leckie, of the Army Medical Service, whose gal-\nlantry was so conspicuous that he was awarded a posthumous D.S.O.\n15 While he was actually dying himself, with shrapnel in his chest, he had\nthe wounded to his bedside and bandaged them. Then came the turn of\nMiss Loder Symonds, who lived with us and was a beloved member of\nthe family. Three of her brothers were killed and the fourth wounded.\nFinally, on an evil day for us, she also passed on. Then two brave neph-\n20 ews, Alec Forbes and Oscar Hornung, went down with bullets through\nthe brain. My gallant brother-in-law, Major Oldham, was killed by a\nsniper during his first days in the trenches. And then finally, just as all\nseemed over, I had a double blow. First it was my Kingsley, my only son\nby the first marriage, one of the grandest boys in body and soul that ever\n25 a father was blessed with. He had started the war as a private, worked\nup to an acting captaincy in the 1st Hampshires, and been very badly\nwounded on the Somme. It was pneumonia which slew him in London,\nand the same cursed plague carried off my soldier brother Innes, he who\nhad shared my humble strivings at Southsea so many years ago. A career\n30 lay before him, for he was only forty and already Adjutant-General of a\ncorps, with the Legion of Honour, and a great record of service. But he\nwas called and he went like the hero he was. \u2018You do not complain at all,\nsir,\u2019 said the orderly. \u2018I am a soldier,\u2019 said the dying General. Thank God\nthat I have since found that the gates are not shut, but only ajar, if one\n35 does show earnestness in the quest. Of all these that I have mentioned,\nthere is but one from whom I have been unable to obtain clear proof of\nposthumous existence.\n292 Chapter 28\nEXPERIENCES ON THE BRITISH FRONT\nLord Newton \u2013 How I Got Out \u2013 Sir W. Robertson \u2013 The Destroyer \u2013 First 5\nExperience of Trenches \u2013 Ceremony at B\u00e9thune \u2013 Mother \u2013 The Ypres Salient\n\u2013 Ypres \u2013 The Hull Territorial \u2013 General Sir Douglas Haig \u2013 Artillery Duel \u2013\nKingsley \u2013 Major Wood \u2013 Paris.\nI had naturally wished to get out to the British front and to see things 10\nfor myself. And yet I had scruples also, for when soldiers are doing a diffi-\ncult job mere spectators and joy-riders are out of place. I felt what a perfect\nnuisance they must be, and hesitated to join them. On the other hand, I\nhad surely more claims than most, since I was not only compiling a history\nof the campaign, but was continually writing in the press upon military 15\nsubjects. I made up my mind, therefore, that I was justified in going, but I\nhad as yet no opportunity.\nHowever, it came along in a very strange way. It was in the early summer\nof 1916 that I had a note from Lord Newton, saying that he wished to see me\nat the Foreign Office. I could not conceive what he wanted to see me about, 20\nbut of course I went. Lord Newton seemed to be doing general utility work\nwhich involved the interests of our prisoners in Germany, as well as press\narrangements, missions, etc. The former alone would be enough for anyone,\nand he was exposed to severe criticism for not being sufficiently zealous in\nthe cause. \u2018Newton, the Teuton,\u2019 sang the prisoners, a parody on \u2018Gilbert, 25\nthe Filbert,\u2019 one of the idiotic popular songs of pre-war days. However, I am\nconvinced that he really did his very best, and that his policy was wise, for if\nit came to an interchange of revenge and barbarity between Germany and\nus, there was only one in it. There is no use starting a game in which you\nare bound to be beaten. Winston Churchill had tried it in the case of the 30\nsubmarine officers, with the result that thirty of our own picked officers had\nendured much in their prisons and the policy had to be reconsidered.\nLord Newton is a wit and has a humorous face which covers a good\ndeal of solid capacity. He plunged instantly into the business on hand.\n\u2018It is the Italian army,\u2019 said he. \u2018They want a bit of limelight. We propose 35\nto send several fellows on short missions to write them up. Your name has\nbeen mentioned and approved. Will you go?\u2019\nI never thought more quickly in my life than on that occasion. I had\n293 experiences on the british front\nno plan when I entered the room, since I was ignorant of the proposition,\nbut I saw my opening in a flash.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said I.\nLord Newton looked surprised.\n5 \u2018Why not?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Because I should be in a false position,\u2019 I answered. \u2018I have nothing\nto compare them with. I have not even seen the British front yet. How\nabsurd it would be for me to approve or to condemn when they could\nreasonably ask me what I knew about the matter!\u2019\n10 \u2018Would you go if that were set right?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, certainly.\u2019\n\u2018Then I don\u2019t think there will be an insuperable difficulty.\u2019\n\u2018Well, if you can arrange that, I am entirely at your disposal.\u2019\n\u2018By the way,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you go to the front, and especially to the Ital-\n15 ian front, a uniform will be essential. What have you a right to wear?\u2019\n\u2018I am a private in the Volunteers.\u2019\nHe laughed.\n\u2018I think you would be shot at sight by both armies,\u2019 said he. \u2018You\nwould be looked upon as a rare specimen. I don\u2019t think that would do.\u2019\n20 I had a happy thought.\n\u2018I am a deputy-lieutenant of Surrey,\u2019 said I. \u2018I have the right to wear a\nuniform when with troops.\u2019\n\u2018Excellent!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Nothing could be better. Well, you will hear\nfrom me presently.\u2019\n25 I went straight off to my tailor, who rigged me up in a wondrous kha-\nki garb which was something between that of a Colonel and a Brigadier,\nwith silver roses instead of stars or crowns upon the shoulder-straps. As\nI had the right to wear several medals, including the South African, the\ngeneral effect was all right, but I always felt a mighty impostor, though\n30 it was certainly very comfortable and convenient. I was still a rare speci-\nmen, and quite a number of officers of three nations made inquiry about\nmy silver roses. A deputy-lieutenant may not be much in England, but\nwhen translated into French \u2013 my French anyhow \u2013 it has an awe-inspir-\ning effect, and I was looked upon by them as an inscrutable but very big\n35 person with a uniform all of his own.\nIt was in May when I had my meeting with Lord Newton, and to-\nwards the end of the month I received a pass which would take me to\nthe British lines. I remember the solicitude of my family, who seemed to\n294 chapter 28\nthink that I was going on active service. To quiet their kindly anxieties I\nsaid: \u2018My dears, I shall be held in the extreme rear, and I shall be lucky\nif ever I see a shell burst on the far horizon.\u2019 The sequel showed that my\nestimate was nearly as mistaken as theirs.\nI had had some correspondence with General Robertson, and had 5\ndedicated my History of the war to him, so much was I impressed with\nthe splendid work he had done behind the line in the early days, when\nCowans and he had as much strain and anxiety from their position in the\nwings as any of those who were in the limelight of the stage. He was, as\nit happened, going over to France, and he sent me a note to ask whether 10\nI would like to share his private compartment on the train and then use\nhis destroyer instead of the ordinary steamer. Of course I was delighted.\nGeneral Robertson is a sturdy, soldierly, compact man, with a bull-dog\nface, and looks as if he might be obstinate and even sullen if crossed. Such\nmen are splendid if they keep their qualities for the enemy, but possibly 15\ndangerous if they use them on their associates. Certainly Robertson had\na great deal of fighting to do at home as well as abroad, and was in the lat-\nter days of the war in constant conflict with the authorities, and with an\nopen feud against the Prime Minister, but it is hard to say who was right.\nPerhaps, if it were not for the pressure which Robertson, Repington and 20\nothers exercised, it would have been more difficult to raise those last few\nhundred thousand men who saved us in 1918. Like so many big men, his\nappearance was most deceptive, and though he looked every inch the\nsoldier, there was nothing to show that great capacity for handling a large\nbusiness, which would surely have put him at the head of any commercial 25\nconcern in the country. There was a Cromwellian touch in him which\npeeped out in occasional religious allusions. He was very engrossed in\npapers and figures, and I hardly had a word with him between London\nand Newhaven.\nWe went straight on to the destroyer and she cast off her moorings 30\nwithin a few minutes. The Channel crossing was a great experience for\nme, and I stood on the bridge all the time looking about for traces of\nwar \u2013 which were not numerous. Just under the bridge stood a sturdy\nseaman in pea jacket and flapped cap, an intent, crouching, formidable\nfigure, with his hand on the crank of a quick-firing gun. He never relaxed, 35\nand for the whole hour, as we tore across, his head, and occasionally his\ngun, was slowly traversing from right to left. The captain, a young lieuten-\nant whose name I have forgotten, told me what hellish work it was in the\n295 experiences on the british front\nwinter, though perhaps \u2018hellish\u2019 is not the mot juste for that bitterly cold\nvigil. His ship was called the Zulu. Shortly afterwards it was blown up, as\nwas its consort the Nubian, but as two of the halves were still serviceable,\nthey stuck them together and made one very good ship, the Zubian. You\n5 can\u2019t beat the British dockyard any more than you can the British Navy\nwhich it mothers. That evening we ran through some twenty miles of\nNorthern France, and wound up at the usual guest-house, where I met\nseveral travelling Russians. Colonel Wilson, a dark, quiet, affable man,\nwho had the thorny job of looking after the press, and Brig.-General\n10 Charteris, a pleasant, breezy, fresh-complexioned soldier, head of the\nBritish Intelligence Department, joined us at dinner. Everything was\nquite comfortable, but at the same time properly plain and simple. There\nis nothing more hateful than luxury behind a battle-line. Next day I had\na wonderful twelve hours in contact with the soldiers all the time, and I\n15 will take some account of it from the notes I made at the time, but now I\ncan expand them and give names more freely.\nThe crowning impression which I carried away from that wonder-\nful day was the enormous imperturbable confidence of the Army and\nits extraordinary efficiency in organization, administration, material,\n20 and personnel. I met in one day a sample of many types, an army com-\nmander, a corps commander, two divisional commanders, staff officers\nof many grades, and, above all, I met repeatedly the two very great men\nwhom Britain has produced, the private soldier and the regimental of-\nficer. Everywhere and on every face one read the same spirit of cheerful\n25 bravery. Even the half-mad cranks whose absurd consciences prevented\nthem from barring the way to the devil seemed to me to be turning into\nmen under the prevailing influence. I saw a batch of them, neurotic and\nlargely bespectacled, but working with a will by the roadside. There was\nno foolish bravado, no underrating of a dour opponent, but a quick, alert,\n30 confident attention to the job in hand which was an inspiration to the\nobserver.\n\u2018Get out of the car. Don\u2019t let it stay here. It may be hit.\u2019 These words\nfrom a staff officer gave you the first idea that things were going to hap-\npen. Up to then you might have been driving through the black country\n35 in the Walsall district with the population of Aldershot let loose upon its\ndingy roads. \u2018Put on this shrapnel helmet. That hat of yours would infu-\nriate the Boche\u2019 \u2013 this was an unkind allusion to my uniform. \u2018Take this\ngas-mask. You won\u2019t need it, but it is a standing order. Now come on!\u2019\n296 chapter 28\nWe crossed a meadow and entered a trench. Here and there it came\nto the surface again where there was dead ground. At one such point an\nold church stood, with an unexploded shell sticking out of the wall. A\ncentury hence folk may journey to see that shell. Then on again through\nan endless cutting. It was slippery clay below. I had no nails in my boots, 5\nan iron pot on my head, and the sun above me. I remember that walk.\nThe telephone wires ran down the side. Here and there large thistles and\nother plants grew from the clay walls, so immobile had been our lines.\nOccasionally there were patches of untidiness. \u2018Shells,\u2019 said the officer\nlaconically. There was a racket of guns before us and behind, especially 10\nbehind, but danger seemed remote with all these Bairnsfather groups of\ncheerful Tommies at work around us. I passed one group of grimy, tat-\ntered boys. A glance at their shoulders showed me that they were of a\npublic-school battalion, the 20th Royal Fusiliers. \u2018I thought you fellows\nwere all officers now,\u2019 I remarked. \u2018No, sir, we like it better so.\u2019 \u2018Well, it will 15\nbe a great memory for you. We are all in your debt.\u2019\nThey saluted, and we squeezed past them. They had the fresh brown\nfaces of boy cricketers. But their comrades were men of a different type,\nwith hard, strong, rugged features, and the eyes of men who have seen\nstrange sights. These were veterans, men of Mons, and their young pals 20\nof the public schools had something to live up to.\nUp to this we only had two clay walls to look at. But now our inter-\nminable and tropical walk was lightened by the sight of a British aero-\nplane sailing overhead. Numerous shrapnel bursts were all around it, but\nshe floated on serenely, a thing of delicate beauty against the blue back- 25\nground. Now another passed \u2013 and yet another. All the morning we saw\nthem circling and swooping, and never a sign of a Boche. They told me\nit was nearly always so \u2013 that we held the air, and that the Boche intrud-\ner, save at early morning, was a rare bird. \u2018We have never met a British\naeroplane which was not ready to fight,\u2019 said a captured German aviator. 30\nThere was a fine, stern courtesy between the airmen on either side, each\ndropping notes into the other\u2019s aerodromes to tell the fate of missing of-\nficers. Had the whole war been fought by the Germans as their airmen\nconducted it (I do not speak, of course, of the Zeppelin murderers), a\npeace would eventually have been more easily arranged. 35\nAnd now we were there \u2013 in what was surely the most wonderful\nspot in the world \u2013 the front firing trench, the outer breakwater which\nheld back the German tide. How strange that this monstrous oscillation\n297 experiences on the british front\nof giant forces, setting in from east and west, should find their equilibri-\num across this particular meadow of Flanders. \u2018How far?\u2019 I asked. \u2018One\nhundred and eighty yards,\u2019 said my guide. \u2018Pop!\u2019 remarked a third per-\nson just in front. \u2018A sniper,\u2019 said my guide; \u2018take a look through the peri-\n5 scope.\u2019 I did so. There was some rusty wire before me, then a field sloping\nslightly upwards with knee-deep grass, and ragged dock and fennel and\nnettles, then rusty wire again, and a red line of broken earth. There was\nnot a sign of movement, but sharp eyes were always watching us, even\nas these crouching soldiers around me were watching them. There were\n10 dead Germans in the grass before us. You need not see them to know that\nthey were there. A wounded soldier sat in a corner nursing his leg. Here\nand there men popped out like rabbits from dug-outs and mine-shafts.\nOthers sat on the fire-step or leaned smoking against the clay wall. Who\nwould dream, who looked at their bold, careless faces, that this was a\n15 front line, and that at any moment it was possible that a grey wave might\nsubmerge them? With all their careless bearing, I noticed that every man\nhad his gas-mask and his rifle within easy reach.\nA mile of front trenches and then we were on our way back down that\nweary walk. Then I was whisked off upon a ten-mile drive. There was a\n20 pause for lunch at Corps Head-quarters, and after it we were taken to a\nmedal presentation in the market square of B\u00e9thune. Generals Munro,\nHaking, and Landon, famous fighting soldiers all three, were the British\nrepresentatives. Munro, with a ruddy face, all brain above, all bulldog be-\nlow; Haking, pale, distinguished, intellectual; Landon, a pleasant genial\n25 country squire. An elderly French General stood beside them. British\ninfantry kept the ground. In front were about fifty Frenchmen in civil\ndress of every grade of life, workmen and gentlemen, in a double rank.\nThey were all so wounded that they were back in civil life, but today they\nwere to have some solace for their wounds. They leaned heavily on sticks,\n30 their bodies twisted and maimed, but their faces shining with pride and\njoy. The French General drew his sword and addressed them. One caught\nwords like \u2018honneur\u2019 and \u2018patrie.\u2019 They leaned forward on their crutches,\nhanging on every syllable which came hissing and rasping from under\nthat heavy white moustache. Then the medals were pinned on. One poor\n35 lad was terribly wounded and needed two sticks. A little girl ran out with\nsome flowers. He leaned forward and tried to kiss her, but the crutches\nslipped and he nearly fell upon her. It was a pitiful but beautiful little\nscene.\n298 chapter 28\nNext the British candidates marched up one by one for their medals,\nhale, hearty men, brown and fit. There was a smart young officer of Scot-\ntish Rifles; and then a selection of Worcesters, Welsh Fusiliers and Scots\nFusiliers, with one funny little Highlander, a tiny figure with a soup-bowl\nhelmet, a grinning boy\u2019s face beneath it, and a bedraggled uniform. \u2018Many 5\nacts of great bravery\u2019 \u2013 such was the record for which he was decorated.\nEven the French wounded smiled at his quaint appearance, as they did\nat another Briton who had acquired the chewing-gum habit, and came\nup for his medal as if he had been called suddenly in the middle of his\ndinner, which he was still endeavouring to bolt. Then came the end, with 10\nthe National Anthem. The British battalion formed fours and went past.\nTo me that was the most impressive sight of any. They were the Queen\u2019s\nWest Surreys, a veteran battalion of the great Ypres battle. What grand\nfellows! As the order came, \u2018Eyes right,\u2019 and all those fierce, dark faces\nflashed round at us I felt the might of the British infantry, the intense in- 15\ndividuality which is not incompatible with the highest discipline. Much\nthey had endured, but a great spirit shone from their faces. I confess that\nas I looked at those brave English lads, and thought of what we owed to\nthem and to their like who have passed on, I felt more emotional than\nbefits a Briton in foreign parts. How many of them are left alive to-day! 20\nNow the ceremony was ended, and once again we set out for the\nfront. It was to an artillery observation post just opposite the Loos Sa-\nlient that we were bound. In an hour I found myself, together with a ra-\nzor-keen young artillery observer and an excellent old sportsman of a\nRussian prince, jammed into a very small space, and staring through a slit 25\nat the German lines. In front of us lay a vast plain, scarred and slashed,\nwith bare places at intervals, such as you see where gravel pits break a\ngreen common. Not a sign of life or movement, save some wheeling\ncrows. And yet down there, within a mile or so, was the population of a\ncity. Far away a single train was puffing at the back of the German lines. 30\nWe were here on a definite errand. Away to the right, nearly three miles\noff, was a small red house, dim to the eye but clear in the glasses, suspect-\ned as a German post. It was to go up this afternoon. The gun was some\ndistance away, but I heard the telephone directions. \u2018\u201cMother\u201d will soon\ndo her in,\u2019 remarked the gunner boy cheerfully. \u2018Mother\u2019 was the name of 35\nthe gun. \u2018Give her five six three four,\u2019 he cried through the \u2019phone. \u2018Moth-\ner\u2019 uttered a horrible bellow from somewhere on our right. An enormous\nspout of smoke rose ten seconds later from near the house. \u2018A little short,\u2019\n299 experiences on the british front\nsaid our gunner. \u2018Two and a half minutes left,\u2019 added a little small voice,\nwhich represented another observer at a different angle. \u2018Raise her sev-\nen five,\u2019 said our boy encouragingly. \u2018Mother\u2019 roared more angrily than\never. \u2018How will that do?\u2019 she seemed to say. \u2018One and a half right,\u2019 said\n5 our invisible gossip. I wondered how the folk in the house were feeling\nas the shells crept ever nearer. \u2018Gun laid, sir,\u2019 said the telephone. \u2018Fire!\u2019 I\nwas looking through my glass. A flash of fire on the house, a huge pillar\nof dust and smoke \u2013 then it settled, and an unbroken field was there. The\nGerman post had gone up. \u2018It\u2019s a dear little gun,\u2019 said the officer boy.\n10 \u2018And her shells are reliable,\u2019 remarked a senior behind us. \u2018They vary\nwith different calibres, but \u201cMother\u201d never goes wrong.\u2019 The German\nline was very quiet. \u2018Pourquoi ne r\u00e9pondent-ils pas?\u2019 asked the Russian\nprince. \u2018Yes, they are quiet to-day,\u2019 answered the senior. \u2018But we get it in\nthe neck sometimes.\u2019 We were all led off to be introduced to \u2018Mother,\u2019\n15 who sat, squat and black, amid twenty of her grimy children who waited\nupon her and fed her. A dainty eater was \u2018Mother,\u2019 and nothing served\nher but the best and plenty of it. But she was an important person and\nas the war progressed it became more and more evident that in spite\nof that upstart family of quick-firers it was really the only big, heavy,\n20 well-established gun which could flatten out a road to the Rhine.\nI had the great joy that night of seeing my brother Innes, who had been\npromoted to Colonel, and was acting as Assistant Adjutant-General of the\n24th Division, the Head-quarters of which were at Bailleul, where I\ndined at mess and occupied a small lodging in the town, which was\n25 about six miles from the front. One more experience wound up that\nwonderful day. That night we took a car after dark and drove north, and\never north, until at a late hour we halted and climbed a hill in the dark-\nness. Below was a wonderful sight. Down on the flats, in a huge semicir-\ncle, lights were rising and falling. They were very brilliant, going up for a\n30 few seconds and then dying down. Sometimes a dozen were in the air at\none time. There were the dull thuds of explosions and an occasional rat-\ntat-tat. I have seen nothing like it, but the nearest comparison would be\nan enormous ten-mile railway station in full swing at night, with signals\nwinking, lamps waving, engines hissing and carriages bumping. It was a\n35 terrible place, a place which will live as long as military history is written,\nfor it was the Ypres Salient. What a salient too! A huge curve, as outlined\nby the lights, needing only a little more to be an encirclement. Something\ncaught the rope as it closed, and that something was the British soldier.\n300 chapter 28\nBut it was a perilous place by day and by night. Never shall I forget the\nimpression of ceaseless, malignant activity which was borne in upon me\nby the white, winking lights, the red sudden flares, and the horrible thud-\nding noises in that place of death beneath me.\nIn old days we had a great name as organizers. Then came a long peri- 5\nod when we deliberately adopted a policy of individuality and \u2018go as you\nplease.\u2019 Now once again in our sore need we had called on all our power\nof administration and direction. And it had not deserted us. We still had\nit in a supreme degree. Even in peace time we have shown it in that vast,\nwell-oiled, swift-running noiseless machine called the British Navy. But 10\nour powers had risen with the need of them. The expansion of the Navy\nwas a miracle, the management of the transport a greater one, the forma-\ntion of the new Army the greatest of all time. To get the men was the least\nof the difficulties. To put them in the field, with everything down to the\nlid of the last field saucepan in its place, that was the marvel. The tools of 15\nthe gunners and of the sappers, to say nothing of the knowledge of how\nto use them, were in themselves a huge problem. But it had all been met\nand mastered. So don\u2019t let us talk too much about the muddling of the\nWar Office. It has become just a little ridiculous.\nI was the guest at Head-quarters of a divisional General, Capper, 20\nbrother of the heroic leader of the 7th Division, who might truly be\ncalled one of the two fathers of the British flying force, for it was he, with\nTempler, who laid the first foundations from which so great an organiza-\ntion has arisen. My morning was spent in visiting two fighting brigadiers,\nMitford and Jelf, cheery weather-beaten soldiers, respectful, as all our 25\nsoldiers are, of the prowess of the Hun, but serenely confident that we\ncould beat him. In company with one of them I ascended a hill, the re-\nverse slope of which was swarming with cheerful infantry in every stage\nof d\u00e9shabille, for they were cleaning up after the trenches. Once over the\nslope we advanced with some care, and finally reached a certain spot 30\nfrom which we looked down upon the German line. It was an observa-\ntion-post, about 1,000 yards from the German trenches, with our own\ntrenches between us. We could see the two lines, sometimes only a few\nyards, as it seemed, apart, extending for miles on either side. The sinister\nsilence and solitude were strangely dramatic. Such vast crowds of men, 35\nsuch intensity of feeling, and yet only that open rolling countryside, with\nnever a movement in its whole expanse.\nIn the afternoon my brother drove me to the Square at Ypres. It was\n301 experiences on the british front\nthe city of a dream, this modern Pompeii, destroyed, deserted and dese-\ncrated, but with a sad, proud dignity which made you involuntarily lower\nyour voice as you passed through the ruined streets. It was a more con-\nsiderable place than I had imagined, with many traces of ancient gran-\n5 deur. No words can describe the absolute splintered wreck that the Huns\nhad made of it. The effect of some of the shells had been grotesque. One\nboiler-plated water tower, a thing 40 or 50 feet high, was actually stand-\ning on its head like a great metal top. There was not a living soul in the\nplace save a few pickets of soldiers, and a number of cats which had be-\n10 come fierce and dangerous. Now and then a shell still fell, but the Huns\nprobably knew that the devastation was already complete.\nWe stood in the lonely grass-grown Square, once the busy centre of\nthe town, and we marvelled at the beauty of the smashed cathedral and\nthe tottering Cloth Hall beside it. Surely at their best they could not have\n15 looked more wonderful. If they were preserved even so, and if a heav-\nen-inspired artist were to model a statue of Belgium in front, Belgium\nwith one hand pointing to the treaty by which Prussia guaranteed her\nsafety and the other to the sacrilege behind her, it would make the most\nimpressive group in the world. It was an evil day for Belgium when her\n20 frontier was violated, but it was a worse one for Germany. I venture to\nprophesy that it will be regarded by history as the greatest military as\nwell as political error that has ever been made. Had the great guns that\ndestroyed Li\u00e8ge made their first breach at Verdun, what chance was there\nfor Paris? Those few weeks of warning and preparation saved France, and\n25 left Germany like a weary and furious bull, tethered fast in the place of\ntrespass and waiting for the inevitable pole-axe.\nWe were glad to get out of the place, for the gloom of it lay as heavy\nupon our hearts as the shrapnel helmets did upon our heads. Both were\nlightened as we sped back past empty and shattered villas to where, just\n30 behind the danger line, the normal life of rural Flanders was carrying\non as usual. A merry sight helped to cheer us, for scudding down wind\nabove our heads came a Boche aeroplane, with two British at her tail\nbarking away with their machine-guns, like two swift terriers after a cat.\nThey shot rat-tattatting across the sky until we lost sight of them in the\n35 heat haze over the German line.\nThe afternoon saw us on the Sharpenburg, from which many a mil-\nlion will gaze in days to come, for from no other point can so much be\nseen. It was a spot forbid, but a special permit took us up, and the sentry\n302 chapter 28\non duty, having satisfied himself of our bona-fides, proceeded to tell us\ntales of the war in a pure Hull dialect which might have been Chinese for\nall that I could understand. That he was a \u2018Terrier\u2019 and had nine children\nwere the only facts I could lay hold of. But I wished to be silent and to\nthink \u2013 even, perhaps, to pray. Here, just below my feet, were the spots 5\nwhich our dear lads, three of them my own kith, had sanctified with their\nblood. Here, fighting for the freedom of the world, they cheerily gave\ntheir all. On that sloping meadow to the left of the row of houses on the\nopposite ridge the London Scottish fought to the death on that grim No-\nvember morning when the Bavarians reeled back from their shot-torn 10\nline. That plain away on the other side of Ypres was the place where the\nthree grand Canadian brigades, first of all men, stood up to the damnable\ngases of the Hun. Down yonder was Hill 60, that blood-soaked kopje.\nThe ridge over the fields was held by the cavalry against two army\ncorps, and there where the sun struck the red roof among the trees I 15\ncould just see Gheluvelt, a name for ever to be associated with Haig and\nthe most vital battle of the war. As I turned away I was faced by my Hull\nTerritorial, who still said incomprehensible things. I looked at him with\nother eyes. He had fought on yonder plain. He had slain Huns, and he\nhad nine children. Could anyone better epitomize the duties of a good 20\ncitizen in days like these? I could have found it in my heart to salute him\nhad I not known that it would have shocked him and made him unhappy.\nNext day, it was June 1, I left my brother\u2019s kindly care. I had fears for\nhim, for he was much over-worked and worried as Adjutant-Generals of\nbusy divisions are likely to be. However, he was never one to admit it or 25\nto pity himself, and he begged me to carry the cheeriest report back to\nhis wife. It was a great pleasure to me that so many officers took me aside\nto say how efficient he was, and how popular. He would not have wished\nme to say it were he alive, but I can leave it on record now.\nYesterday had been full, but the next day was not less so, for I had 30\nbeen asked (or ordered) to lunch at the General Head-quarters at Mon-\ntreuil, the funny old town on a hill which I had learned to know well\nin days of peace. As we drove down a winding drive I saw two officers\nwalking towards us. The younger of them stooped and beat the ground\nwith his stick, from which we gathered that we were to go slow and raise 35\nno dust. We rightly conjectured that so curt an order could only come\nfrom the Chief\u2019s own aide. We saluted as we passed and carried away an\nimpression of a heavy moustache and of abstracted blue eyes.\n303 experiences on the british front\nI had a very much more definite impression when he came back pres-\nently, and we were all shown into the dining-room. I should certainly put\nDouglas Haig, as I saw him that day, among the handsomest men I have\never known. He was not tall, but he was upright and well proportioned\n5 with every sign of strength and activity. But his face was remarkable for\nbeauty and power. His eyes were very full and expressive, devoid of the\nfierceness of Kitchener and yet with quite as much determination. But\nthe long powerful jaw was the feature which spoke particularly of that\nnever-to-be-beaten quality which saved the army when the line was bro-\n10 ken in the first Ypres battle and was destined to save it again in April,\n1918, when he gave out his \u2018back to the wall\u2019 order of the day. He was\ncourteous but not talkative at lunch. After lunch he took me into a side\nroom where he showed me the line of the divisions on the map, saying\nthat I could remember but should not take notes, which was rather mad-\n15 dening. Then we had a long talk over the coffee, but there were sever-\nal present and nothing intimate was said. He must be worried to death\nwith casual visitors, but still I suppose he need not invite all of them to\nHead-quarters. He had, I thought, a truly British distrust of foreigners.\n\u2018He is the worst foreigner I have met yet,\u2019 he said, speaking of some Ital-\n20 ian General. His kind heart was shown when I said that my son was in the\nline. He gave a curt order, and then nodded and smiled. \u2018You\u2019ll see him\nto-morrow,\u2019 said he.\nI naturally heard a good deal about our Generalissimo, besides what I\nactually saw. I think that he had some of the traits of Wellington, though\n25 since the war he has concerned himself with the fortunes of his com-\nrades-in-arms a great deal more than the Iron Duke seems ever to have\ntroubled himself to do. But in other things the parallel is close. Haig is\nnot a game-playing man, though fond of horse exercise. Neither was the\nDuke. Both were abstemious with wine and tobacco. Both were reserved,\n30 reticent and had no magnetic connection with those under them. Nei-\nther Haig nor the Duke were human figures to the soldiers, nor were\nthey often if ever seen by them, and yet in each case there was the same\nconfidence in their judgment. Haig was a very serious man, he seldom\njoked and did not meet a joke half way, so that his mess was the dullest\n35 in France. I have known a staff officer apply for an exchange so weary was\nhe of this oppressive atmosphere. All this could equally have been said of\nthe Duke. But these are trivialities compared to the great main fact that\neach brought rare qualities to the service of their country at critical mo-\n304 chapter 28\nments of the world\u2019s history. There was only one other man who might\nhave filled Haig\u2019s place, and that man was the conqueror of Palestine.\nExtraordinary are the contrasts of war. Within three hours of leaving\nthe quiet atmosphere of the Head-quarters Ch\u00e2teau I was present at what\nin any other war would have been looked upon as a brisk engagement. 5\nAs it was it would certainly figure in one of our desiccated reports as an\nactivity of the artillery. The noise as we struck the line at this new point\nshowed that the matter was serious, and indeed we had chosen the spot\nbecause it had been the storm centre of the last week. The method of\napproach chosen by our experienced guide was in itself a tribute to the 10\ngravity of the affair. As one comes from the settled order of Flanders into\nthe actual scene of war, the first sign of it is one of the stationary, sau-\nsage-shaped balloons, a chain of which marks the ring in which the great\nwrestlers are locked. We passed under this, ascended a hill, and found\nourselves in a garden where for a year no feet save those of wanderers like 15\nourselves had stood. There was a wild, confused luxuriance of growth\nmore beautiful to my eye than anything which the care of man can pro-\nduce. One old shell-hole of vast diameter had filled itself with forget-me-\nnots, and appeared as a graceful basin of light blue flowers, held up as\nan atonement to Heaven for the brutalities of man. Through the tangled 20\nbushes we crept, then across a yard \u2013 \u2018Please stoop and run as you pass\nthis point\u2019 \u2013 and finally to a small opening in a wall, whence the battle\nlay not so much before us as beside us. For a moment we had a front seat\nat the great world-drama, God\u2019s own problem play, working surely to its\nmagnificent end. One felt a sort of shame to crouch here in comfort, a 25\nuseless spectator, while brave men down yonder were facing that pelting\nshower of iron.\nThere was a large field on our left rear, and the German gunners had\nthe idea that there was a concealed battery therein. They were systemat-\nically searching for it. A great shell exploded in the top corner, but got 30\nnothing more solid than a few tons of clay. You could read the mind of\nGunner Fritz. \u2018Try the lower corner!\u2019 said he, and up went the earth-\ncloud once again. \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s hid about the middle. I\u2019ll try.\u2019 Earth again,\nand nothing more. \u2018I believe I was right the first time after all,\u2019 said hope-\nful Fritz. So another shell came into the top corner. The field was full of 35\npits as a Gruy\u00e8re cheese, but Fritz got nothing by his perseverance. Per-\nhaps there never was a battery there at all. One effect he obviously did at-\ntain. He made several other British batteries exceedingly angry. \u2018Stop that\n305 experiences on the british front\ntickling, Fritz!\u2019 was the burden of their cry. Where they were we could no\nmore see than Fritz could, but their constant work was very clear along\nthe German line. We appeared to be using more shrapnel and the Ger-\nmans more high explosives, but that may have been just the chance of the\n5 day. The Vimy Ridge was on our right, and before us was the old French\nposition, with the Labyrinth of terrible memories and the long hill of\nLorette. When, the year before last, the French, in a three weeks\u2019 battle,\nfought their way up that hill, it was an exhibition of sustained courage\nwhich even their military annals can seldom have beaten.\n10 Next day we travelled through Acheux and hit the British line once\nmore to the east of that place. Our official chauffeur had had his instruc-\ntions, and so had other people, with the result that as we swung into the\nbroad main street of a village \u2013 Mailly, I think, was the name \u2013 there was\na tall young officer standing with his back turned. He swung round at\n15 the noise of the car, and it was my boy Kingsley with his usual jolly grin\nupon his weather-stained features. The long arm of G.H.Q. had stretched\nout and plucked him out of a trench, and there he was. We had an hour\u2019s\ntalk in a field, for there was nowhere else to go. He was hard and well\nand told me that all was nearly ready for a big push at the very part of the\n20 line where his battalion, the 1st Hampshires, was stationed. This was the\nfirst intimation of the great Somme battle, on the first day of which every\nofficer of the Hampshires without exception was killed or wounded. I\nlearned afterwards that before the battle for ten nights running Kings-\nley crept out to the German wire and stuck up crosses where he found\n25 the wire uncut, which were brown towards the enemy and white towards\nthe British, as a guide to the gunners. He lay on his face sometimes with\nthe machine-guns firing just above him. For this service Colonel Palk\nthanked him warmly and said he should certainly have a decoration, but\nPalk and both majors were killed and no recommendations went for-\n30 ward. Two shrapnel bullets in the neck were all Kingsley got out of the\nbattle, and two months on his back in a hospital. However, he was not\na medal hunter and I never heard him complain, nor would he wear his\nwound badges until he was compelled.\nAn hour later I met another member of my household, for my Sec-\n35 retary, Major Wood of the 5th Sussex Territorials, was Town Major of\nBeauquesne, where I found him at the convenient hour of lunch. He had\ndone nearly two years of hard active service, which was pretty good for\na civilian of fifty; and had led his company at Festubert and other en-\n306 chapter 28\ngagements. He was now using his excellent powers of organization and\nadministration in making Beauquesne a well-ordered village, as later he\nmade Doullens a well-ordered town. I expect that the British adminis-\ntration will remain as a wonderful legend of sanitation and cleanliness in\nmany of these French towns of the North-East. 5\nAfter inspecting Major Wood\u2019s work I went on to Amiens with him\nand he packed me into the train to Paris, the first part of my task thor-\noughly done so far as time would permit. I came away with a deep sense\nof the difficult task which lay before the Army, but with an equally deep\none of the ability of those men to do all that soldiers can be called upon 10\nto perform. But I saw no end to the war.\nI had two days in Paris \u2013 a very dead and alive Paris, such a Paris\nas had seldom or never been seen before, with darkened streets and the\nshops nearly all closed. I stayed at the Hotel Crillon, where were a few\nRussian and British officers. It was extraordinary the difference which 15\nthe public made between the two. A British officer was disregarded,\nwhile a Russian General \u2013 I took a walk with one \u2013 was looked upon\nwith an adulation which was quite comic. Men came up and made a low\nobeisance before him. And yet it was our Army, our purse, our factories,\nabove all our Navy, which were saving the situation both for France and 20\nRussia, to whom we were bound by no alliance. There was certainly not\nmuch sign of appreciation or gratitude. It is a very singular thing how the\nwhole world alternately leans upon and depreciates the British Empire.\n307 Chapter 29\nEXPERIENCES ON THE ITALIAN FRONT\n5 The Polite Front \u2013 Udine \u2013 Under Fire \u2013 Carnic Alps \u2013 Italia Irredenta \u2013\nTrentino \u2013 The Voice of the Holy Roman Empire.\nTwo days later I found myself, after an uneventful journey, at Padua\non my way to the Italian front. The Italian front seemed to have politely\n10 come back to meet me, for I was awakened in the night by a tremendous\ndropping of bombs, with the rattle of anti-aircraft guns. I thought I was\nas safe in bed as anywhere, and so it proved. Little damage was done, but\nPadua and the other Italian cities were having a bad time, and it was a\none-sided arrangement, since the Italians can do nothing without injur-\n15 ing their own kith and kin across the border. This dropping of explosives\non the chance of hitting one soldier among fifty victims was surely the\nmost monstrous development of the whole war, and was altogether Ger-\nman in its origin. If international law cannot now stamp it out, the next\nwar will send the people flying to the caves and calling upon the moun-\n20 tains to cover them, even as was foretold.\nI arrived at last at Udine, the capital of the Friulian Province, where\nwere the Italian Head-quarters \u2013 a funny little town with a huge mound\nin the centre, which looked too big to be artificial, but was said to have\nbeen thrown up by Attila. My recommendation was to the British Mis-\n25 sion, which was headed by Brig.-General Delme-Radcliffe, who received\nme with hospitality, a bluff, short-spoken and masterful British soldier.\nThe Mission owned a white house on the edge of the town. On the sec-\nond floor under a window which proved to be that of my bedroom there\nwas a long dark smear upon the whitewashed wall. \u2018That\u2019s the stomach\n30 of a baker,\u2019 said the soldier-servant with a grin. I thought it was a joke on\nhis part, but it was literally true, for a bomb a few days before had blown\nthe man to bits as he passed the house, and had plastered bits of him on\nthe stonework. The ceiling of my bedroom was full of holes from that or\nsome other explosion.\n35 There was some tendency at this time to cavil at the Italians and to\nwonder why they did not make more impression upon the Austrians.\nAs a matter of fact they were faced by the same barbed wire and ma-\nchine-gun problem which had held up everyone else. I soon saw, when\n308 chapter 29\nI was allowed next morning to get to the front, that the conditions were\nvery like those of Flanders in a more genial climate and in all ways less\naggravated. I had been handed over to the Italian Intelligence people,\nwho were represented by a charmingly affable nobleman, Colonel the\nMarquis Barbariche, and Colonel Claricetti. These two introduced me at 5\nonce to General Porro, chief of the Staff, a brown, wrinkled, walnut-faced\nwarrior, who showed me some plans and did what he could to be helpful.\nIt was about a seven-miles drive from Udine before we reached the\nnearest point of the trenches. From a mound an extraordinary view\ncould be got of the Austrian position, the general curve of both lines be- 10\ning marked, as in Flanders, by the sausage balloons which float behind\nthem. The Isonzo, which had been so bravely carried by the Italians, lay\nin front of me, a clear blue river, as broad as the Thames at Hampton\nCourt. In a hollow to my left were the roofs of Gorizia, the town which\nthe Italians were endeavouring to take. A long desolate ridge, the Carso, 15\nextended to the south of the town, and stretched down nearly to the sea.\nThe crest was held by the Austrians, and the Italian trenches had been\npushed within 50 yards of them. A lively bombardment was going on\nfrom either side, but so far as the infantry went there was none of that\nconstant malignant petty warfare with which we were familiar in Flan- 20\nders. I was anxious to see the Italian trenches, in order to compare them\nwith our British methods, but save for the support and communication\ntrenches I was courteously but firmly warned off.\nHaving got this general view of the position, I was anxious in the af-\nternoon to visit Monfalcone, which is the small dockyard captured from 25\nthe Austrians on the Adriatic. My kind Italian officer guides did not rec-\nommend the trip, as it was part of their great hospitality to shield their\nguest from any part of that danger which they were always ready to incur\nthemselves. The only road to Monfalcone ran close to the Austrian posi-\ntion at the village of Ronchi, and afterwards kept parallel to it for some 30\nmiles. I was told that it was only on odd days that the Austrian guns were\nactive in this particular section, so determined to trust to luck that this\nmight not be one of them. It proved, however, to be one of the worst\non record, and we were not destined to see the dockyard to which we\nstarted. 35\nThe civilian cuts a ridiculous figure when he enlarges upon small ad-\nventures which may come his way \u2013 adventures which the soldier en-\ndures in silence as part of his everyday life. On this occasion, however,\n309 experiences on the italian front\nthe episode was all our own, and had a sporting flavour in it which made\nit dramatic. I know now the feeling of tense expectation with which the\ndriven grouse whirrs onwards towards the butt. I have been behind the\nbutt before now, and it is only poetic justice that I should see the matter\n5 from the other point of view. As we approached Ronchi we could see\nshrapnel breaking over the road in front of us, but we had not yet realized\nthat it was precisely for vehicles that the Austrians were waiting, and that\nthey had the range marked down to a yard. We went down the road all\nout at a steady 50 miles an hour. The village was near, and it seemed that\n10 we had got past the place of danger. We had, in fact, just reached it. At this\nmoment there was a noise as if the whole four tyres had gone simultane-\nously, a most terrific bang in our very ears, merging into a second sound\nlike a reverberating blow upon an enormous gong. As I glanced up I saw\nthree clouds immediately above my head, two of them white and the\n15 other of a rusty red. The air was full of flying metal, and the road, as we\nwere told afterwards by an observer, was all churned up by it. The metal\nbase of one of the shells was found plumb in the middle of the road just\nwhere our motor had been. It was our pace that saved us. The motor was\nan open one, and the three shells burst, according to one of my Italian\n20 companions, who was himself an artillery officer, about 10 metres above\nour heads. They threw forward, however, and we travelling at so great a\npace, shot from under. Before they could get in another we had swung\nround the curve and under the lee of a house. The good Colonel wrung\nmy hand in silence. They were both distressed, these good soldiers, un-\n25 der the impression that they had led me into danger. As a matter of fact it\nwas I who owed them an apology, since they had enough risks in the way\nof business without taking others in order to gratify the whim of a visitor.\nOur difficulties were by no means over. We found an ambulance lor-\nry and a little group of infantry huddled under the same shelter, with\n30 the expression of people who had been caught in the rain. The road be-\nyond was under heavy fire as well as that by which we had come. Had the\nOstro-Boches dropped a high explosive upon us they would have had a\ngood mixed bag. But apparently they were only out for fancy shooting\nand disdained a sitter. Presently there came a lull and the lorry moved\n35 on, but we soon heard a burst of firing which showed that they were af-\nter it. My companions had decided that it was out of the question for us\nto finish our excursion. We waited for some time, therefore, and were\nable finally to make our retreat on foot, being joined later by the car. So\n310 chapter 29\nended my visit to Monfalcone, the place I did not reach. I hear that two\n10,000-ton steamers were left on the stocks there by the Austrians, but\nwere disabled before they retired. Their cabin basins and other fittings\nwere adorning the Italian dug-outs.\nMy second day was devoted to a view of the Italian mountain warfare 5\nin the Carnic Alps. Besides the two great fronts, one of defence (Tren-\ntino) and one of offence (Isonzo), there were very many smaller valleys\nwhich had to be guarded. The total frontier line is over 400 miles, and it\nhad all to be held against raids if not invasions. It was a most picturesque\nbusiness. Far up in the Roccolana Valley I found the Alpini outposts, 10\nbacked by artillery which had been brought into the most wonderful po-\nsitions. They had taken 8-inch guns where a tourist could hardly take his\nknapsack. Neither side could ever make serious progress, but there were\ncontinual duels, gun against gun, or Alpini against Jaeger. In a little way-\nside house was the brigade Head-quarters, and here I was entertained 15\nto lunch. It was a scene that I shall remember. They drank to England.\nI raised my glass to Italia irredenta \u2013 might it soon be redenta. They all\nsprang to their feet and the circle of dark faces flashed into flame. They\nkeep their souls and emotions, these people. I trust that ours may not\nbecome atrophied by self-suppression. 20\nThe last day spent on the Italian front was in the Trentino. From Vero-\nna a motor drive of about twenty-five miles takes one up the valley of the\nAdige, and past a place of evil augury for the Austrians, the field of Rivoli.\nFinally, after a long drive of winding gradients, always beside the Adige, we\nreached Ala, where we interviewed the Commander of the sector, a man 25\nwho has done splendid work during the recent fighting. \u2018By all means you\ncan see my front. But no motor-car, please. It draws fire, and others may\nbe hit besides you.\u2019 We proceeded on foot, therefore, along a valley which\nbranched at the end into two passes. In both very active fighting had been\ngoing on, and as we came up the guns were baying merrily, waking up most 30\nextraordinary echoes in the hills. It was difficult to believe that it was not\nthunder. There was one terrible voice that broke out from time to time in\nthe mountains \u2013 the angry voice of the Holy Roman Empire. When it came\nall other sounds died down into nothing. It was \u2013 so I was told \u2013 the master\ngun, the vast 42-centimetre giant which brought down the pride of Li\u00e8ge 35\nand Namur. The Austrians had brought one or more from Innsbruck. The\nItalians assure me, however, as we have ourselves discovered, that in trench\nwork beyond a certain point the size of the guns makes little matter.\n311 experiences on the italian front\nWe passed a burst dug-out by the roadside where a tragedy had oc-\ncurred recently, for eight medical officers were killed in it by a single shell.\nThere was no particular danger in the valley, however, and the aimed fire\nwas all going across us to the fighting lines in the two passes above us.\n5 That to the right, the Valley of Buello, has seen some of the worst of the\nfighting. These two passes form the Italian left wing which has held firm\nall through. So has the right wing. It is only the centre which has been\npushed in by the concentrated fire.\nWhen we arrived at the spot where the two valleys forked we were\n10 halted, and were not permitted to advance to the front trenches which\nlay upon the crests above us. There were about 1,000 yards between the\nadversaries. I have seen types of some of the Bosnian and Croatian pris-\noners, men of poor physique and intelligence, but the Italians speak with\nchivalrous praise of the bravery of the Hungarians and of the Austrian\n15 Jaeger. Some of their proceedings disgusted them, however, and espe-\ncially the fact that they used Russian prisoners to dig trenches under\nfire. There is no doubt of this, as some of the men were recaptured and\nwere sent on to join their comrades in France. On the whole, howev-\ner, it may be said that in the Austro-Italian war there was nothing which\n20 corresponded with the extreme bitterness of our Western conflict. The\npresence or absence of the Hun makes all the difference.\nIt was a moment of depression at the Trentino front, as there had\nbeen a set-back. I may flatter myself when I think that even one solitary\nfigure in a British uniform striding about among them was good at that\n25 particular time to their eyes. They read of allies, but they never saw any. If\nthey had, we might have been spared the subsequent disaster at Caporet-\nto. Certainly I was heartily welcomed there, and surrounded all the time\nby great mobs of soldiers, who imagined, I suppose, that I was someone\nof importance.\n30 That night found me back at Verona, and next morning I was on my\nway to Paris with sheaves of notes about the Italian soldiers which would,\nI hoped, make the British public more sympathetic towards them. I was\ntold afterwards by the Foreign Office that my mission had been an un-\nmixed success.\n35 I have one other association with the Italian front which I may in-\nclude here. It is embalmed in the Annals of the Psychic Research Society.\nI have several times in my life awakened from sleep with some strong im-\npressions of knowledge gained still lingering in my brain. In one case, for\n312 chapter 29\nexample, I got the strange name Naldera so vividly that I wrote it down\nbetween two stretches of insensibility and found it on the outside of my\ncheque-book next morning. A month later I started for Australia in the\ns.s. Naldera of which I had then never heard. In this particular Italian in-\nstance I got the word Piave, absolutely ringing in my head. I knew it as a 5\nriver some 70 miles to the rear of the Italian front and quite unconnected\nwith the war. None the less the impression was so strong that I wrote the\nincident down and had it signed by two witnesses. Months passed and\nthe Italian battle line was rolled back to the Piave, which became a famil-\niar word. Some said it would go back further. I was sure it would not. I 10\nargued that if the abnormal forces, whatever they may be, had taken such\npains to impress the matter upon me, it must needs be good news which\nthey were conveying, since I had needed cheering at the time. Therefore\nI felt sure that some great victory and the turning-point of the war would\ncome on the Piave. So sure was I that I wrote to my friend Mr. Lacon 15\nWatson, who was on the Italian front, and the incident got into the Italian\npress. It could have nothing but a good effect upon their morale. Finally\nit is a matter of history how completely my impression was justified, and\nhow the most shattering victory of the whole war was gained at that very\nspot. 20\nThere is the fact, amply proved by documents and beyond all possi-\nble coincidence. As to the explanation some may say that our own sub-\nconscious self has power of foresight. If so it is a singularly dead instinct,\nseldom or never used. Others may say that our \u2018dead\u2019 can see further than\nwe, and try when we are asleep and in spiritual touch with us, to give us 25\nknowledge and consolation. The latter is my own solution of the mystery.\n313 Chapter 30\nEXPERIENCES ON THE FRENCH FRONT\n5 A Dreadful Reception \u2013 Robert Donald \u2013 Clemenceau \u2013 Soissons Cathedral\n\u2013 The Commandant\u2019s Cane \u2013 The Extreme Outpost \u2013 Adonis \u2013 General\nHenneque \u2013 Cyrano in the Argonne \u2013 Tir Rapide \u2013 French Canadian \u2013\nWound Stripes.\n10 When i got back to Paris I had a dreadful reception, for as I dismount-\ned from the railway car a British military policeman in his flat red cap\nstepped up to me and saluted.\n\u2018This is bad news, sir,\u2019 said he.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 I gasped.\n15 \u2018Lord Kitchener, sir. Drowned!\u2019\n\u2018Good God!\u2019 I cried.\n\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 Suddenly the machine turned for a moment into a human\nbeing. \u2018Too much talking in this war,\u2019 he said, and then in a moment was\nhis stiff formal self again, and bustled off in search of deserters.\n20 Kitchener dead! The words were like clods falling on my heart. One\ncould not imagine him dead, that centre of energy and vitality. With a\nheavy spirit I drove back to my old quarters at the Hotel Crillon, full-\ner than ever of red-epauletted, sword-clanking Russians. I could have\ncursed them, for it was in visiting their rotten, crumbling country that\n25 our hero had met his end.\nAt the hotel I met by appointment Mr. Robert Donald, editor of the\nDaily Chronicle, which paper had been publishing my articles. Donald,\na fine, solid Scot, had the advantage of talking good French and being\nin thorough touch with French conditions. With him I called upon M.\n30 Clemenceau, who had not at that time played any conspicuous part in\nthe war, save as violent critic. He lived modestly in a small house which\nshowed that he had not used his power in the State and in journalism to\nany unfair personal advantage He entered, a swarthy, wrinkled, white-\nhaired man, with the face of a crabbed bulldog, and a cloth cap upon\n35 his head. He reminded me of old Jim Mace the bruiser, as I remember\nhim in his final phase. His eyes looked angry, and he had a truculent,\nmischievous smile. I was not impressed by the judgment he showed in\nour conversation, if a squirt on one side and Niagara on the other can be\n314 chapter 30\ncalled conversation. He was railing loudly at the English rate of exchange\nbetween the franc and the pound, which seemed to me very like kicking\nagainst the barometer. Mr. Donald, who is a real authority upon finance,\nasked him whether France was taking the rouble at its face value; but the\nroaring voice, like a strong gramophone with a blunt needle, submerged 5\nall argument. Against Joffre he roared his reproaches, and intimated that\nhe had someone else up his sleeve who could very soon bring the war\nto an end. A volcano of a man, dangerous sometimes to his friends, and\nsometimes to his foes. Let me acknowledge that I did not at the time rec-\nognize that he would ever be the opposite number to Lloyd George, and 10\nthat the pair would lead us to victory.\nDonald had arranged that he and I should visit the French lines in\nthe Argonne, which was as near as we could get to Verdun, where the\nbattle was at its height. There were a few days to spare, however, and in\nthe meantime I got a chance of going to the Soissons front, along with 15\nLeo Maxse, editor of the National Review, and a M. Chevillon, who had\nwritten an excellent book on British co-operation in the war. Maxse, a\ndark little man, all nerves and ginger, might well plume himself that he\nwas one of those who had foreseen the war and most loudly demanded\npreparation. Chevillon was a grey-bearded, father-of-a-family type, and 20\ncould speak English, which promoted our closer acquaintance, as my\nFrench is adventurous but not always successful. A captain of French In-\ntelligence, a small, silent man, took the fourth place in the car.\nWhen our posterity hear that it was easy to run out from Paris to\nthe line, to spend a full day on the line, and to be back again in Paris 25\nfor dinner, it will make them appreciate how close a thing was the war.\nWe passed in the first instance the Woods of Villers Cotteret, where the\nGuards had turned upon the German van on September 1, 1914. Eighty\nGuardsmen were buried in the village cemetery, among them a nephew\nof Maxse\u2019s, to whose tomb we now made pious pilgrimage. Among the 30\ntrees on either side of the road I noticed other graves of soldiers, buried\nwhere they had fallen.\nSoissons proved to be a considerable wreck, though it was far from\nbeing an Ypres. But the cathedral would, and will, make many a patriotic\nFrenchman weep. Here, absolutely unchanged through the ages, was the 35\nspot where St. Louis had dedicated himself to the Crusade. Every stone\nof it was holy. And now the lovely old stained-glass strewed the floor, and\nthe roof lay in a huge heap across the central aisle. A dog was climbing\n315 experiences on the french front\nover it as we entered. No wonder the French fought well. Such sights\nwould drive the mildest man to desperation. The abb\u00e9, a good priest, with\na large humorous face, took us over his shattered domain. When I point-\ned out the desecration of the dog he shrugged his shoulders and said:\n5 \u2018What matter? It will have to be reconsecrated, anyhow.\u2019 He connived at\nmy gathering up some splinters of the rich old stained-glass as souvenirs\nfor my wife. He was full of reminiscences of the German occupation of\nthe place. One of his personal anecdotes was indeed marvellous.\nIt was that a lady in the local ambulance had vowed to kiss the first\n10 French soldier who re-entered the town. She did so, and it proved to be\nher husband. The abb\u00e9 was a good, kind, truthful man \u2013 but he had a\nhumorous face.\nA walk down a ruined street brought one to the opening of the\ntrenches. There were marks upon the walls of the German occupation,\n15 \u2018Berlin-Paris,\u2019 with an arrow of direction, adorning one corner. At anoth-\ner the 76th Regiment had commemorated the fact that they were there\nin 1870 and again in 1914. If the Soissons folk are wise, they will keep\nthese inscriptions as reminders to the rising generation. I could imagine,\nhowever, that their inclination will be to whitewash, fumigate, and forget.\n20 A sudden turn among some broken walls took one into the communi-\ncation trench. Our guide was a Commandant of the Staff, a tall, thin man\nwith hard, grey eyes and a severe face. It was the more severe towards us,\nas I gathered that he had been deluded into the belief that only about one\nout of six of our soldiers went to the trenches. For the moment he was\n25 not friends with the English. As we went along, however, we gradually\ngot on better terms, we discovered a twinkle in the hard, grey eyes, and\nthe day ended with an exchange of walking-sticks between him and me\nand a renewal of the Entente. May my cane grow into a marshal\u2019s baton!\nA charming young artillery subaltern was our guide in that maze of\n30 trenches, and we walked and walked and walked, with a brisk exchange\nof compliments between the \u201875\u2019s\u2019 of the French and the \u201877\u2019s\u2019 of the Ger-\nmans going on high over our heads. The trenches were boarded at the\nsides, and had a more permanent look than those of Flanders. Presently\nwe met a fine, brown-faced, upstanding boy, as keen as a razor, who com-\n35 manded this particular section. A little farther on a helmeted captain of\ninfantry, who was an expert sniper, joined our little party. Now we were\nat the very front trench. I had expected to see primeval men, bearded\nand shaggy. But the \u2018Poilus\u2019 have disappeared. The men around me were\n316 chapter 30\nclean and dapper to a remarkable degree. I gathered, however, that they\nhad their internal difficulties. On one board I read an old inscription:\n\u2018He is a Boche, but he is the inseparable companion of a French soldier.\u2019\nAbove was a rude drawing of a louse.\nI was led to a cunning loop-hole, and had a glimpse through it of a 5\nlittle framed picture of French countryside. There were fields, a road, a\nsloping hill beyond with trees. Quite close, about 30 or 40 yards away,\nwas a low, red-tiled house. \u2018They are there,\u2019 said our guide. \u2018That is their\noutpost. We can hear them cough.\u2019 Only the guns were coughing that\nmorning, so we heard nothing; but it was certainly wonderful to be so 10\nnear the enemy and yet in such peace. I suppose wondering visitors from\nBerlin were brought up also to hear the French cough. Modern warfare\nhas certainly some extraordinary sides.\nThen we were shown all the devices which a year of experience had\nsuggested to the quick brains of our Allies. Every form of bomb, cata- 15\npult, and trench mortar was ready to hand. Every method of cross-fire\nhad been thought out to an exact degree. There was something, however,\nabout the disposition of a machine-gun which disturbed the Comman-\ndant. He called for the officer of the gun. His thin lips got thinner and his\ngrey eyes more austere as we waited. Presently there emerged an extraor- 20\ndinarily handsome youth, dark as a Spaniard, from some rabbit-hole.\nHe faced the Commandant bravely, and answered back with respect but\nfirmness. \u2018Pourquoi?\u2019 asked the Commandant, and yet again \u2018Pourquoi?\u2019\nAdonis had an answer for everything. Both sides appealed to the big cap-\ntain of snipers, who was clearly embarrassed. He stood on one leg and 25\nscratched his chin. Finally the Commandant turned away angrily in the\nmidst of one of Adonis\u2019 voluble sentences. His face showed that the mat-\nter was not ended. War is taken very seriously in the French Army, and\nany sort of professional mistake is very quickly punished. Many officers\nof high rank had been broken by the French during the war. There was no 30\nmore forgiveness for the beaten General than there was in the days of the\nRepublic when the delegate of the National Convention, with a patent\nportable guillotine, used to drop in at Head-quarters to support a more\nvigorous offensive.\nIt had come on to rain heavily, and we were forced to take refuge 35\nin the dug-out of the sniper. Eight of us sat in the deep gloom huddled\nclosely together. The Commandant was still harping upon that ill-placed\nmachine-gun. He could not get over it. My imperfect ear for French\n317 experiences on the french front\ncould not follow all his complaints, but some defence of the offender\nbrought forth a \u2018Jamais! Jamais! Jamais!\u2019 which was rapped out as if it\ncame from the gun itself. There were eight of us in an underground bur-\nrow, and some were smoking. Better a deluge than such an atmosphere\n5 as that. But if there was a thing upon earth which the French officer shied\nat it was rain and mud. The reason is that he was extraordinarily natty in\nhis person. His charming blue uniform, his facings, his brown gaiters,\nboots and belts were always just as smart as paint. He was the dandy of\nthe European War. I noticed officers in the trenches with their trousers\n10 carefully pressed.\nThe rain had now stopped, and we climbed from our burrow. Again\nwe were led down that endless line of communication trench, again we\nstumbled through the ruins, again we emerged into the street where our\ncars were awaiting us. Above our heads the sharp artillery duel was going\n15 merrily forward. The French were firing three or four to one, which had\nbeen my experience at every point I had touched upon the Allied front.\nThanks to the extraordinary zeal of the French workers, especially of the\nFrench women, and to the clever adaption of machinery by their engi-\nneers, their supplies were abundant.\n20 Our next expedition carried us to Ch\u00e2lons, where the Huns of old\nmet disaster. From Ch\u00e2lons we drove some twenty miles to St. Mene-\nhould, and learned that the trenches were about ten miles north. On this\nexpedition there were Donald and I with an extraordinary Spaniard, half\nDon Quixote, half Gipsy troubadour, flat hatted and clad in brown cor-\n25 duroy, with a single arm, having, as we heard, lost the other in some broil.\nAs he spoke no tongue but his own we were never on terms with him.\nThe front at the sector which we struck was under the control of\nGeneral Henneque of the 10th Division. A fine soldier this, and Heaven\nhelp Germany if he and his division had invaded it, for he was, as one\n30 could see at a glance, a man of iron who had been goaded to fierceness by\nall that his beloved country had endured. He was a man of middle size,\nswarthy, hawk-like, very abrupt in his movements, with two steel-grey\neyes, which were the most searching that mine have ever met. His hos-\npitality and courtesy to us were beyond all bounds, but there is another\n35 side to him, and it is one which it were wiser not to provoke. In person\nhe took us to his lines, passing through the usual shot-torn villages be-\nhind them. Where the road dipped down into the great forest there was\none particular spot which was visible to the German artillery observers.\n318 chapter 30\nThe General mentioned it at the time, but his remark seemed to have no\npersonal interest. We understood it better on our return in the evening.\nWe then found ourselves in the depths of the woods \u2013 primeval woods\nof oak and beech in the deep clay soil that the great oak loves. There had\nbeen rain, and the forest paths were ankle deep in mire. Everywhere, 5\nto right and left, soldiers\u2019 faces, hard and rough from a year of open air,\ngazed up at us from their burrows in the ground. Presently an alert, blue-\nclad figure stood in the path to greet us. It was the Colonel of the sector.\nHe was ridiculously like Cyrano de Bergerac as depicted by the late M.\nCoquelin, save that his nose was of more moderate proportion. The rud- 10\ndy colouring, the bristling, feline, full-ended moustache, the solidity of\npose, the backward tilt of the head, the general suggestion of the bantam\ncock, were all there facing us as he stood amid the leaves in the sunlight.\nGauntlets and a long rapier \u2013 nothing else was wanting. Something had\namused Cyrano. His moustache quivered with suppressed mirth and his 15\nblue eyes were demurely gleaming. Then the joke came out. He had spot-\nted a German working-party, his guns had concentrated on it, and after-\nwards he had seen the stretchers go forward. A grim joke, it may seem.\nBut the French saw this war from a different angle to us. If we had had the\nBoche sitting on our heads for two years, and were not quite sure wheth- 20\ner we could ever get him off again, we should get Cyrano\u2019s point of view.\nWe passed in a little procession among the French soldiers, and\nviewed their multifarious arrangements. For them we were a little break\nin a monotonous life, and they formed up in lines as we passed. My own\nBritish uniform and the civilian dresses of my two companions interested 25\nthem. As the General passed these groups, who formed themselves up in\nperhaps a more familiar manner than would have been usual in the Brit-\nish service, he glanced kindly at them with those singular eyes of his, and\nonce or twice addressed them as \u2018Mes enfants.\u2019 One might conceive that\nall was \u2018go as you please\u2019 among the French. So it was as long as you went 30\nin the right way. When you strayed from it you knew it. As we passed a\ngroup of men standing on a low ridge which overlooked us there was\na sudden stop. I gazed round. The General\u2019s face was steel and cement.\nThe eyes were cold and yet fiery, sunlight upon icicles. Something had\nhappened. Cyrano had sprung to his side. His reddish moustache had 35\nshot forward beyond his nose, and it bristled out like that of an angry\ncat. Both were looking up at the group above us. One wretched man de-\ntached himself from his comrades and sidled down the slope. No skipper\n319 experiences on the french front\nand mate of a Yankee blood boat could have looked more ferociously at a\nmutineer. And yet it was all over some minor breach of discipline which\nwas summarily disposed of by two days of confinement. Then in an in-\nstant the faces relaxed, there was a general buzz of relief, and we were\n5 back at \u2018Mes enfants\u2019 again.\nTrenches are trenches, and the main speciality of those in the Ar-\ngonne were that they were nearer to the enemy. In fact, there were places\nwhere they interlocked, and where the advanced posts lay cheek by jowl\nwith a good steel plate to cover both cheek and jowl. We were brought\n10 to a sap-head where the Germans were at the other side of a narrow for-\nest road. Had I leaned forward with extended hand and a Boche done\nthe same we could have touched. I looked across, but saw only a tangle\nof wire and sticks. Even whispering was not permitted in those forward\nposts.\n15 When we emerged from these hushed places of danger Cyrano took\nus all to his dug-out, which was a tasty little cottage carved from the side\nof a hill and faced with logs. He did the honours of a humble cabin with\nthe air of a seigneur in his ch\u00e2teau. There was little furniture, but from\nsome broken mansion he had extracted an iron fire-back, which adorned\n20 his grate. It was a fine, medi\u00e6val bit of work, with Venus, in her tradition-\nal costume, in the centre of it. It seemed the last touch in the picture of\nthe gallant virile Cyrano. I only met him this once, nor shall I ever see\nhim again, yet he stands a thing complete within my memory. Always in\nthe cinema of memory he will walk the leafy paths of the Argonne, his\n25 fierce eyes searching for the Boche workers, his red moustache bristling\nover their annihilation. He seems a figure out of the past of France.\nThat night we dined with yet another type of the French soldier,\nGeneral Antoine, who commanded the corps of which my friend had\none division. Each of these French generals had a striking individuality\n30 of his own which I wish I could fix upon paper. Their only common point\nwas that each seemed to be a rare good soldier. The Corps General was\nAthos with a touch of d\u2019Artagnan. He was well over six feet high, bluff, jo-\nvial, with huge, upcurling moustache, and a voice that would rally a reg-\niment. It was a grand figure, which should have been done by Van Dyck,\n35 with lace collar, hand on sword, and arm akimbo. Jovial and laughing was\nhe, but a stern and hard soldier was lurking behind the smiles. His name\nhas appeared in history, and so has Humbert\u2019s, who ruled all the army\nof which the other corps is a unit. Humbert was a Lord Roberts figure,\n320 chapter 30\nsmall, wiry, quick-stepping, all steel and elastic, with a short, upturned\nmoustache, which one could imagine as crackling with electricity in mo-\nments of excitement like a cat\u2019s fur. What he does or says is quick, abrupt,\nand to the point. He fires his remarks like pistol-shots at this man or that.\nOnce to my horror he fixed me with his hard little eyes and demanded; 5\n\u2018Sherlock Holmes, est-ce qu\u2019il est un soldat dans l\u2019arm\u00e9e Anglaise?\u2019 The\nwhole table waited in an awful hush. \u2018Mais, mon general,\u2019 I stammered,\n\u2018il est trop vieux pour service.\u2019 There was general laughter, and I felt that I\nhad scrambled out of an awkward place.\nAnd talking of awkward places, I had forgotten about that spot upon 10\nthe road whence the Boche observer could see our motor-cars. He had\nactually laid a gun upon it, the rascal, and waited all the long day for our\nreturn. No sooner did we appear upon the slope than a shrapnel shell\nburst above us, but somewhat behind me, as well as to the left. Had it\nbeen straight the second car would have got it, and there might have 15\nbeen a vacancy in one of the chief editorial chairs in London. The Gen-\neral shouted to the driver to speed up, and we were soon safe from the\nGerman gunners. One got perfectly immune to noises in these scenes,\nfor the guns which surrounded you made louder crashes than any shell\nwhich burst about you. It is only when you actually saw the cloud over 20\nyou that your thoughts came back to yourself, and that you realized that\nin this wonderful drama you might be a useless super, but none the less\nyou were on the stage and not in the stalls.\nNext morning we were down in the front trenches again at another\nportion of the line. Far away on our right, from a spot named the Obser- 25\nvatory, we could see the extreme left of the Verdun position and shells\nbursting on the Fille Morte. To the north of us was a broad expanse of\nsunny France, nestling villages, scattered ch\u00e2teaux, rustic churches, and\nall as inaccessible as if it were the moon. It was a terrible thing this Ger-\nman bar \u2013 a thing unthinkable to Britons. To stand on the edge of York- 30\nshire and look into Lancashire feeling that it was in other hands, that our\nfellow-countrymen were suffering there and waiting, waiting for help,\nand that we could not, after two years, come a yard nearer to them \u2013\nwould it not break our hearts? Could I wonder that there was no smile\nupon the grim faces of those Frenchmen! But when the bar was broken, 35\nwhen the line swept forward, when French bayonets gleamed upon those\nuplands and French flags broke from those village spires \u2013 ah, what a day\nthat was! Men died that day from the pure delirious joy of it.\n321 experiences on the french front\nYet another type of French General took us round that morning!\nHe, too, was a man apart, an unforgettable man. Conceive a man with a\nlarge, broad, good-humoured face, and two placid, dark, seal\u2019s eyes which\ngazed gently into yours. He was young, and had pink cheeks and a soft\n5 voice. Such was one of the most redoubtable fighters of France, this Gen-\neral of Division Dupont. His former Staff officers told me something of\nthe man. He was a philosopher, a fatalist, impervious to fear, a dreamer\nof distant dreams amid the most furious bombardment. The weight of\nthe French assault upon the terrible Labyrinth fell at one time upon the\n10 brigade which he then commanded. He led them day after day gathering\nup Germans with the detached air of the man of science who is hunting\nfor specimens. In whatever shell-hole he might chance to lunch he had\nhis cloth spread and decorated with wild flowers plucked from the edge.\nI wrote of him at the time: \u2018If Fate be kind to him, he will go far.\u2019 As a\n15 matter of fact, before the end of the war he was one of the most influ-\nential members of the General Staff, so my prophetic power was amply\nvindicated.\nFrom the Observatory we saw the destruction of a German trench.\nThere had been signs of work upon it, so it was decided to close it down.\n20 It was a very visible brown streak a thousand yards away. The word was\npassed back to the \u201875\u2019s\u2019 in the rear. There was a \u2018tir rapide\u2019 over our\nheads. My word, the man who stands fast under a \u2018tir rapide\u2019, be he Bo-\nche, French or British, is a man of mettle! The mere passage of the shells\nwas awe-inspiring, at first like the screaming of a wintry wind, and then\n25 thickening into the howling of a pack of wolves. The trench was a line of\nterrific explosions. Then the dust settled down and all was still. Where\nwere the ants who had made the nest? Were they buried beneath it? Or\nhad they got from under? No one could say.\nThere was one little gun which fascinated me, and I stood for some\n30 time watching it. Its three gunners, enormous helmeted men, evidently\nloved it, and touched it with a swift but tender touch in every movement.\nWhen it was fired it ran up an inclined plane to take off the recoil, rushing\nup and then turning and rattling down again upon the gunners who were\nused to its ways. The first time it did it, I was standing behind it, and I\n35 don\u2019t know which jumped quickest \u2013 the gun or I.\nFrench officers above a certain rank develop and show their own in-\ndividuality. In the lower grades the conditions of service enforce a cer-\ntain uniformity. The British officer is a British gentleman first, and an\n322 chapter 30\nofficer afterwards. The Frenchman is an officer first, though none the less\nthe gentleman stands behind it. One very strange type we met, however,\nin these Argonne Woods. He was a French-Canadian who had been a\nFrench soldier, had founded a homestead in far Alberta, and had now\ncome back of his own will, though a naturalized Briton, to the old flag. He 5\nspoke English of a kind, the quality and quantity being equally extraordi-\nnary. It poured from him and was, so far as it was intelligible, of the wool-\nly Western variety. His views on the Germans were the most emphatic\nwe had met. \u2018These Godam sons of\u2019 \u2013 well, let us say \u2018Canines!\u2019 he would\nshriek, shaking his fist at the woods to the north of him. A good man was 10\nour compatriot, for he had a very recent Legion of Honour pinned upon\nhis breast. He had been put with a few men on Hill 285, a sort of volcano\nstuffed with mines, and was told to telephone when he needed relief. He\nrefused to telephone, and remained there for three weeks. \u2018We sit like\none rabbit in his hall,\u2019 he explained. He had only one grievance \u2013 there 15\nwere many wild boars in the forest, but the infantry were too busy to get\nthem. \u2018The Godam Artillaree he get the wild pig!\u2019 Out of his pocket he\npulled a picture of a frame house with snow round it, and a lady with\ntwo children on the stoep. It was his homestead at Trochu, seventy miles\nnorth of Calgary. 20\nIt was the evening of the third day that we turned our faces towards\nParis once more. It was my last view of the French. The roar of their guns\nwent far with me upon my way. I wrote at the time: \u2018Soldiers of France,\nfarewell! In your own phrase, I salute you! Many have seen you who had\nmore knowledge by which to judge your manifold virtues, many also 25\nwho had more skill to draw you as you are, but never one, I am sure, who\nadmired you more than I. Great was the French soldier, under Louis the\nSun-King, great too under Napoleon, but never was he greater than to-\nday.\u2019\nBut in spite of all their bravery only two things saved France, her field 30\nguns and the intervention of England. Surely she should have a reckon-\ning with her pre-war military authorities. Imagine unwarlike Britain, pro-\ntected by the sea, and yet having a high standard of musketry, heavy guns\nwith every division, and khaki uniforms, while warlike France, under the\nvery shadow of Germany, had poor musketry, primeval uniforms and no 35\nheavy guns. As to her early views of strategy they were lamentable. Every\nBritish critic, above all Lord Kitchener, knew that the attack would swing\nround through Belgium. France concentrated all her preparation upon\n323 experiences on the french front\nthe Eastern frontier. It was clear also that the weaker power should be\non the defensive and so bring her enemy by heavier losses down to her\nown weight. France attacked and broke herself in an impossible venture.\nThere should have been a heavy reckoning against someone. The fate of\n5 England as well as of France was imperilled by the false estimates of the\nFrench General Staff.\nOne small visible result of my journey was the establishment of\nwound stripes upon the uniforms of the British. I had been struck by\nthis very human touch among the French, which gave a man some credit\n10 and therefore some consolation for his sufferings. I represented the mat-\nter when I came back. Lest I seem to claim more than is true, I append\nGeneral Robertson\u2019s letter. The second sentence refers to that campaign\nfor the use of armour which I had prosecuted so long, and with some\nsuccess as regards helmets, though there the credit was mostly due to Dr.\n15 Saleeby, among civilians. The letter runs thus:\nwar office,\nAugust 14, 1916.\n20 Many thanks for sending me a copy of your little book. I will cer-\ntainly see what can be done in regard to armour. You will remember\nthat I took your previous tip as regards badges for wounded men.\nYours very truly,\n25 w. r. robertson.\n324 Chapter 31\nBREAKING THE HINDENBURG LINE\nLloyd George \u2013 My Second Excursion \u2013 The Farthest German Point \u2013 Sir 5\nJoseph Cook \u2013 Night before the Day of Judgment \u2013 The Final Battle \u2013 On a\nTank \u2013 Horrible Sight \u2013 Speech to Australians \u2013 The Magic Carpet.\nI find in my diary that the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, invited\nme to breakfast in April 1917. Some third person was, I understand, to 10\nhave been present, but he did not arrive, so that I found myself alone in\nthe classic dining-room of No. 10, Downing Street, while my host was\nfinishing his toilet. Presently he appeared, clad in a grey suit, smart and\nsmiling, with no sign at all that he bore the weight of the great European\nWar upon his shoulders. Nothing could have been more affable or demo- 15\ncratic, for there was no servant present, and he poured out the tea, while\nI, from a side table, brought the bacon and eggs for both. He had certain-\nly the Celtic power of making one absolutely at one\u2019s ease, for there was\nno trace at all of pomp or ceremony \u2013 just a pleasant, smiling, grey-haired\nbut very virile gentleman, with twinkling eyes and a roguish smile. No 20\ndoubt there are other aspects, but that is how he presented himself that\nmorning.\nHe began by talking about the great loss which the country had sus-\ntained in Lord Kitchener\u2019s death, speaking of him in a very kindly and\nhuman way. At the same time he was of opinion that long tropical ser- 25\nvice and the habit of always talking down to subordinates had had some\neffect upon his mind and character. He was a strange mixture of rather\nmorose inactivity and sudden flashes of prevision which amounted to\ngenius. He was the only man who had clearly foreseen the length of the\nwar, and but for Turkey, Bulgaria, and other complications he probably 30\noverstated it at three years. There were times when he became so dictato-\nrial as to be almost unbearable, and he had to be reminded at a Cabinet\nCouncil by Lloyd George himself that he was in the presence of twenty\nmen who were his peers, and that he could not refuse them information\nor act above their heads. I confess that it struck me as very natural that a 35\nbig man with vital knowledge in his brain should hesitate in a world crisis\nto confide it to twenty men, and probably twenty wives, each of whom\nwas a possible leak. In spite of his genius Kitchener was not accessible to\n325 breaking the hindenburg line\nnew ideas. He could not see clearly why such enormous munitions were\nnecessary. He opposed tanks. He was against the Irish and Welsh sepa-\nrate divisions. He refused the special flags which the ladies had worked\nfor these divisions. He was as remote from sentiment as a steam hammer,\n5 and yet he was dealing with humans who can be influenced by sentiment.\nHe obstructed in many things, particularly in the Dardanelles. On the\nother hand, his steps in organizing the new armies were splendid, though\nhe had attempted \u2013 vainly \u2013 to do away with the Territorials, another ex-\nample of his blindness to the practical force of sentiment. Miss Asquith\n10 had said of him, \u2018If he is not a great man he is a great poster,\u2019 and certainly\nno one else could have moved the nation to such a degree, though the\nlong series of provocations from the Germans had made us very recep-\ntive and combative.\nLloyd George was justly proud of the splendid work of the Welsh\n15 Division at the front. He had been to Mametz Wood, the taking of which\nhad been such a bloody, and also such a glorious, business. He listened\nwith interest to an account which I was able to give him of some inci-\ndents in that fight, and said that it was a beautiful story. He had arranged\nfor a Welsh painter to do the scene of the battle.\n20 He was interested to hear how I had worked upon my history, and\nremarked that it was probably better done from direct human documents\nthan from filed papers. He asked me whether I had met many of the di-\nvisional Generals, and on my saying that I had, he asked me if any had\nstruck me as outstanding among their fellows. I said I thought they were\n25 a fine level lot, but that in soldiering it was impossible to say by mere talk\nor appearance who was the big man at a pinch. He agreed. He seemed to\nhave a particular feeling towards General Tom Bridges, of the 19th Divi-\nsion, and shortly afterwards I noticed that he was chosen for the Ameri-\ncan mission.\n30 I talked to him about my views as to the use of armour, and found\nhim very keen upon it. He is an excellent listener, and seems honestly in-\nterested in what you say. He said he had no doubt that in the problem of\narmour lay the future of warfare, but how to carry it was the crux. He said\nthat the soldiers always obstructed the idea \u2013 which was my experience\n35 also \u2013 with a few notable exceptions. I mentioned General Watts of the\n7th Division as being interested in armour, and he agreed and seemed to\nknow all about Watts who, though a \u2018dug-out,\u2019 was one of the finds of the\nwar.\n326 chapter 31\nHe was much excited about the revolution in Russia, news of which\nhad only just come through. The Guards had turned, and that meant that\nall had turned. The Tsar was good but weak. The general character and\nprobable fate of the Tsarina were not unlike those of Marie Antoinette\n\u2013 in fact, the whole course of events was very analogous to the French 5\nRevolution. \u2018Then it will last some years and end in a Napoleon,\u2019 said I.\nHe agreed. The revolt, he said, was in no sense pro-German. The whole\naffair had been Byzantine, and reminded one of the old histories.\nAs I left he came back to armour, and said that he was about to see\nsomeone on that very subject. When I was in the hall it struck me that 10\na few definite facts which I had in my head would be useful in such an\ninterview, so, to the surprise of the butler, I sat down on the hall chair\nand wrote out on a scrap of paper a few headings which I asked him to\ngive the Prime Minister. I don\u2019t know if they were of any use. I came away\nreassured, and feeling that a vigorous virile hand was at the helm. 15\nI had not expected to see any more actual operations of the war, but\nearly in September 1918 I had an intimation from the Australian Gov-\nernment that I might visit their section of the line. Little did I think that\nthis would lead to my seeing the crowning battle of the war. It was on\nSeptember 26 that we actually started, the party consisting of Sir Joseph 20\nCook, Naval Minister of the Australian Commonwealth, Commander\nLatham, his aide-de-camp, who in civil life is a rising barrister of Mel-\nbourne, and Mr. Berry, soon to be Sir William Berry, proprietor of the\nSunday Times. We crossed in a gale of wind, with a destroyer sheeted in\nfoam on either side of the leave boat, each of us being obliged to wear 25\nlife-belts. Several American newspaper men were on board, one of them\nan old friend, Bok, of the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal. It was too late to continue\nour journey when we got across, so we stayed at an inn that night, and\nwere off to the Australian line at an early hour in the morning, our way\nlying through Abbeville and Amiens. The latter place was nearly deserted 30\nand very badly knocked about, far more so than I had expected.\nThe enemy had, as we knew, been within seven miles of Amiens \u2013 it\nwas the Australian line which held the town safe, and the Allied cause\nfrom desperate peril if not ruin. It did not surprise us, therefore, that we\nsoon came upon signs of fighting. A little grove was shown us as the abso- 35\nlute farthest ripple of the advanced German wave. A little farther on was\nthe sheltered town of Villers Brettoneux, with piles of empty cartridge\ncases at every corner to show where snipers or machine-guns had lurked.\n327 breaking the hindenburg line\nA little farther on a truly monstrous gun \u2013 the largest I have ever seen \u2013\nlay near the road, broken into three pieces. It was bigger to my eyes than\nthe largest on our battleships, and had been brought up and mounted\nby the Germans just before the tide had turned, which was on July 5. In\n5 their retreat they had been compelled to blow it up. A party of British\nGuardsmen were standing round it examining it, and I exchanged a few\nwords with them. Then we ran on through ground which was intensely\ninteresting to me, as it was the scene of Gough\u2019s retreat, and I had just\nbeen carefully studying it at home. There was the Somme on our left, a\n10 very placid, slow-moving stream, and across it the higher ground where\nour III Corps had been held up on the historical August 8, the day which\nmade Ludendorff realize, as he himself states, that the war was lost. On\nthe plain over which we were moving the Australian and Canadian Di-\nvisions had swept, with the tanks leading the British line, as Boadicea\u2019s\n15 chariots did of old. Though I had not been over the ground before, I\nhad visualized it so clearly in making notes about the battle that I could\nname every hamlet and locate every shattered church tower. Presently a\nhill rose on the left, which I knew to be Mount St. Quentin, the taking\nof which by the Australians was one of the feats of the war. It had been\n20 defended by picked troops, including some of the Prussian Guards, but\nthey were mostly taken or killed, though a flanking attack by the British\nYeomanry Division had something to do with the result.\nThe old walled town of P\u00e9ronne, sacred for ever to Sir Walter, Quen-\ntin Durward, and the archers of the Scots Guards, lay before us, almost if\n25 not quite surrounded by the river, the canal, and broad moats. It seemed\nan impossible place to take, which is of course the greatest possible trap\nin modern warfare, since something occurring fifty miles away may place\ntroops behind you and cut you off. Here our long drive finished, and we\nwere handed over to the care of Colonel Bennett, commanding the camp,\n30 a tall, bluff warrior who, if he had doffed his khaki and got into a velvet\ntunic, would have been the exact image of the veteran warrior in Scott\u2019s\nnovel. He was indeed a veteran, having fought, if I remember right, not\nonly in South Africa, but even in the Australian Suakim contingent.\nA little wooden hut was put at our disposal, and there we slept, Sir\n35 Joseph Cook and I, with a small partition between us. I was bitterly cold,\nand so I can tell was he, for I could hear him tossing about just as I did\nfor warmth. We had neither of us made the discovery that you may pile\nall the clothes you like on the top of you, but so long as there is only one\n328 chapter 31\nlayer of canvas beneath you, you are likely to be cold. We don\u2019t usually\nrealize that the mattress is also part of the bedclothes. We both got little\nsleep that night.\nNext morning, September 28, we were off betimes, for we had much\nto see, the old town for one thing, which I vowed I would visit again 5\nin time of peace. We descended Mount St. Quentin and saw ample ev-\nidence of the grim struggle that had occurred there. There were many\nrude graves, some of them with strange inscriptions. One of them, I was\ntold, read: \u2018Here lies a German who met two diggers.\u2019 The Australian\nTommy was of course universally known as a digger. They make a rough, 10\nvaliant, sporting but rude-handed crew. They went through the prison-\ners for loot, and even the officers were ransacked. Colonel Bennett told\nme that a Colonel of the Germans was impudent when he came into his\npresence, so Bennett said: \u2018Mend your manners, or I will hand you over\nto the diggers!\u2019 They were waiting outside the tent for just such a chance. 15\nOne German had an iron cross which was snatched from him by an Aus-\ntralian. The German shaped up to the man in excellent form and knocked\nhim down. The other Australians were delighted, gave him back his cross,\nand made him quite a hero. I expect the looter had been an unpopular\nman. 20\nThe younger Australian officers were all promoted from the ranks,\nand many of them had their own ideas about English grammar. Bennett\ntold me that he tried to get the reports better written. One subaltern\nhad reported: \u2018As I came round the traverse I met a Bosch and we both\nreached for our guns, but he lost his block and I got him.\u2019 Bennett re- 25\nturned this for emendation. It came back: \u2018As I came round the traverse\nI met a German, and we both drew our automatic pistols, but he lost his\npresence of mind and I shot him.\u2019 I think I like the first style best.\nI lunched that day at the Head-quarters of Sir John Monash, an ex-\ncellent soldier who had done really splendid work, especially since the 30\nadvance began. Indeed, it was his own action on July 5 which turned the\ntide of retreat. He showed that the long line of fighting Jews which began\nwith Joshua still carries on. One of the Australian Divisional Generals,\nRosenthal, was also a Jew, and the Head-quarters Staff was full of ea-\ngle-nosed, black-haired warriors. It spoke well for them and well also for 35\nthe perfect equality of the Australian system, which would have the best\nman at the top, be he who he might. My brother was acting as Assistant\nAdjutant-General to General Butler with the III British Corps on the left\n329 breaking the hindenburg line\nof the Australians, and they had kindly wired for him, so that I had the joy\nof having him next me at lunch, and he invited me to join the Head-quar-\nters mess of his corps for dinner.\nIt was a wonderful experience that dinner. The great advance was to\n5 be next morning, when it was hoped that the Hindenburg Line, which\nwas practically the frontier of Germany, would be carried. There were\nonly six who dined in that little farm-house messroom: Butler himself\nwith hard composed face, his head of sappers, head of gunners, my broth-\ner, the first and second Staff officers, a little group of harassed and weary\n10 men. Yet there was no word of the huge drama on the edge of which we\nwere standing. Every now and then a telephone tinkled in the next room,\na Staff officer rose, there were a few short words, a nod, and the incident\nwas closed. It was a wonderful example of quiet self-control. I said to my\nbrother, when we were alone: \u2018Don\u2019t you think I am out of the picture at\n15 such a moment talking about such frivolous things?\u2019 \u2018For God\u2019s sake keep\non at it,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is just what they need. Give their brains something\nnew.\u2019 So I tried to do so and we had a memorable evening.\nI shall never forget the drive back of 10 miles in a pitch-dark night,\nwith not a gleam anywhere save that far aloft two little gold points glim-\n20 mered now and again, like the far-off headlights of a motor transferred\nsuddenly to the heavens. These were British aeroplanes, so lit to distin-\nguish them from the German marauders. The whole Eastern horizon was\nyellow-red with gunfire, and the distant roar of the artillery preparation\nwas like the Atlantic surge upon a rock-bound coast. Along the road no\n25 lights were permitted, and several times out of the black a still blacker\ngloom framed itself into some motor-lorry with which only our cries\nsaved a collision. It was wonderful and awesome, the eve of the day of\njudgment when Germany\u2019s last solid defence was to be smashed, and she\nwas to be left open to that vengeance which she had so long provoked.\n30 We were awakened early, part of our party getting away to some point\nwhich they imagined would be more adventurous than that to which we\nseniors should be invited, though in the sequel it hardly proved so. They\nsaw much, however, and one of them described to me how one of the first\nand saddest sights was that of eighteen splendid young Americans lying\n35 dead and lonely by the roadside, caught in some unlucky shell burst. Mr.\nCook, Commander Latham, and I had been placed under the charge\nof Captain Plunket, a twice-wounded Australian officer, who helped us\nmuch during the varied adventures of our exciting day.\n330 chapter 31\nThe general programme of attack was already in our minds. Two\nAmerican divisions, the 27th and 30th, one from New York, the other\nfrom the South, were to rush the front line. The Australian divisions were\nthen to pass over or through them and carry the battlefront forward. Al-\nready, as we arrived on the battle-field, the glad news came back that the 5\nAmericans had done their part, and that the Australians had just been\nunleashed. Also that the Germans were standing to it like men.\nAs our car threaded the crowded street between the ruins of Tem-\npleux we met the wounded coming back, covered cars with nothing vis-\nible save protruding boots, and a constant stream of pedestrians, some 10\nlimping, some with bandaged arms and faces, some supported by Red\nCross men, a few in pain, most of them smiling grimly behind their ciga-\nrettes. Amid them came the first clump of prisoners, fifty or more, pitia-\nble enough, and yet I could not pity them, the weary, shuffling, hang-dog\ncreatures, with no touch of nobility in their features or their bearing. 15\nThe village was full of Americans and Australians, extraordinarily like\neach other in type. One could well have lingered, for it was all of great\ninterest, but there were even greater interests ahead, so we turned up a\nhill, left our car, which had reached its limit, and proceeded on foot. The\nroad took us through a farm, where a British anti-aircraft battery stood 20\nready for action. Then we found open plain, and went forward, amid old\ntrenches and rusty wire, in the direction of the battle.\nWe had now passed the heavy gun positions, and were among the\nfield guns, so that the noise was deafening. A British howitzer battery was\nhard at work, and we stopped to chat with the Major. His crews had been 25\nat it for six hours, but were in great good humour, and chuckled mightily\nwhen the blast of one of their guns nearly drove in our ear-drums, we\nhaving got rather too far forward. The effect was that of a ringing box\non the exposed ear \u2013 with which valediction we left our grinning Brit-\nish gunners and pushed on to the east, under a screaming canopy of our 30\nown shells. The wild, empty waste of moor was broken by a single shal-\nlow quarry or gravel-pit, in which we could see some movement. In it\nwe found an advanced dressing station, with about a hundred American\nand Australian gunners and orderlies. There were dug-outs in the sides of\nthis flat excavation, and it had been an American battalion Head-quarters 35\nup to a few hours before. We were now about 1,000 yards from the Hin-\ndenburg Line, and I learned with emotion that this spot was the Egg Re-\ndoubt, one of those advanced outposts of General Gough\u2019s army which\n331 breaking the hindenburg line\nsuffered so tragic and glorious a fate in that great military epic of March\n21 \u2013 one of the grandest in the whole war. The fact that we were now\nactually standing in the Egg Redoubt showed me, as nothing else could\nhave done, how completely the ground had been recovered, and how the\n5 day of retribution was at hand.\nWe were standing near the eastward lip of the excavation, and look-\ning over it, when it was first brought to our attention that it took two to\nmake a battle. Up to now we had seen only one. Now two shells burst in\nquick succession 40 yards in front of us, and a spray of earth went into\n10 the air. \u2018Whizz-bangs,\u2019 remarked our soldier-guide casually. Personally,\nI felt less keenly interested in their name than in the fact that they were\nthere at all.\nWe thought we had done pretty well to get within 1,000 yards of the\nfamous line, but now came a crowning bit of good fortune, for an Aus-\n15 tralian gunner captain, a mere lad, but a soldier from his hawk\u2019s eyes to\nhis active feet, volunteered to rush us forward to some coign of vantage\nknown to himself. So it was Eastward Ho! once more, still over a dull,\nbarren plain sloping gently upwards, with little sign of life. Here and\nthere was the quick fluff of a bursting shell, but at a comfortable distance.\n20 Suddenly ahead of us a definite object broke the skyline. It was a Tank,\nupon which the crew were working with spanners and levers, for its com-\nrades were now far ahead, and it would fain follow. This, it seems, was the\ngrandstand which our young gunner had selected. On to the top of it we\nclambered \u2013 and there, at our very feet, and less than 500 yards away, was\n25 the rift which had been torn a few hours before in the Hindenburg Line.\nOn the dun slope beyond it, under our very eyes, was even now being\nfought a part of that great fight where at last the children of light were\nbeating down into the earth the forces of darkness. It was there. We could\nsee it. And yet how little there was to see!\n30 The ridge was passed, and the ground sloped down, as dark and\nheathy as Hindhead. In front of us lay a village. It was Bellicourt. The\nHindenburg position ran through it. It lay quiet enough, and with the un-\naided eye one could see rusty red fields of wire in front of it. But the wire\nhad availed nothing, nor had the trench that lurked behind it, for beyond\n35 it, beside the village of Nauroy, there was a long white line, clouds of pale\nsteam-like vapour spouting up against a dark, rain-sodden sky. \u2018The Bo-\nche smoke barrage,\u2019 said our guide. \u2018They are going to counter-attack.\u2019\nOnly this, the long, white, swirling cloud upon the dark plain told of the\n332 chapter 31\nstrife in front of us. With my glasses I saw what looked like Tanks, but\nwhether wrecked or in action I could not say. There was the battle \u2013the\ngreatest of battles \u2013 but nowhere could I see a moving figure. It is true\nthat all the noises of the pit seemed to rise from that lonely landscape,\nbut noise was always with us, go where we would. 5\nThe Australians were ahead where that line of smoke marked their\nprogress. In the sloping fields, which at that point emerged out of the\nmoor, the victorious Americans, who had done their part, were crouch-\ning. It was an assured victory upon which we gazed, achieved so rapidly\nthat we were ourselves standing far forward in ground which had been 10\nwon that day. The wounded had been brought in, and I saw no corpses.\nOn the left the fight was very severe, and the Germans, who had been\nhidden in their huge dug-outs, were doing their usual trick of emerging\nand cutting off the attack. So much we gathered afterwards, but for the\nmoment it was the panorama before us which was engrossing all our 15\nthoughts.\nSuddenly the German guns woke up. I can but pray that it was not\nour group which drew their fire upon the half-mended tank. Shell after\nshell fell in its direction, all of them short, but creeping forward with each\nsalvo. It was time for us to go. If any man says that without a call of duty 20\nhe likes being under aimed shellfire, he is not a man whose word I would\ntrust. Some of the shells burst with a rusty-red out-flame, and we were\ntold that they were gas shells. I may say that before we were admitted on\nto the battle-field at all, we were ushered one by one into a room where\nsome devil\u2019s pipkin was bubbling in the corner, and were taught to use 25\nour gas-masks by the simple expedient of telling us that if we failed to\nacquire the art then and there a very painful alternative was awaiting us.\nWe made our way back, with no indecent haste, but certainly without\nloitering, across the plain, the shells always getting rather nearer, until we\ncame to the excavation. Here we had a welcome rest, for our good gunner 30\ntook us into his cubby-hole of a dug-out, which would at least stop shrap-\nnel, and we shared his tea and dried beef, a true Australian soldier\u2019s meal.\nThe German fire was now rather heavy, and our expert host explained\nthat this meant that he had recovered from the shock of the attack, had\nreorganized his guns, and was generally his merry self once more. From 35\nwhere we sat we could see heavy shells bursting far to our rear, and there\nwas an atmosphere of explosion all round us, which might have seemed\nalarming had it not been for the general chatty afternoon-tea appearance\n333 breaking the hindenburg line\nof all these veteran soldiers with whom it was our privilege to find our-\nselves. A group of sulky-looking German prisoners sat in a corner, while\na lank and freckled Australian soldier, with his knee sticking out of a rent\nin his trousers, was walking about with four watches dangling from his\n5 hand, endeavouring vainly to sell them. Far be it from me to assert that\nhe did not bring the watches from Sydney and choose this moment for\ndoing a deal in them, but they were heavy old Teutonic time-pieces, and\nthe prisoners seemed to take a rather personal interest in them.\nAs we started on our homeward track we came, first, upon the British\n10 battery which seemed to be limbering up with some idea of advancing,\nand so lost its chance of administering a box on our other ear. Farther\nstill we met our friends of the air guns, and stopped again to exchange a\nfew impressions. They had nothing to fire at, and seemed bored to tears,\nfor the red, white and blue machines were in full command of the sky.\n15 Soon we found our motor waiting in the lee of a ruined house, and be-\ngan to thread our way back through the wonderfully picturesque streams\nof men \u2013 American, Australian, British, and German \u2013 who were strung\nalong the road.\nAnd then occurred a very horrible incident. One knew, of course,\n20 that one could not wander about a battle-field and not find oneself soon-\ner or later involved in some tragedy, but we were now out of range of\nany but heavy guns, and their shots were spasmodic. We had halted the\ncar for an instant to gather up two German helmets which Command-\ner Latham had seen on the roadside, when there was a very heavy burst\n25 close ahead round a curve in the village street. A geyser of red brick-dust\nflew up into the air. An instant later our car rounded the corner. None of\nus will forget what we saw. There was a tangle of mutilated horses, their\nnecks rising and sinking. Beside them a man with his hand blown off\nwas staggering away, the blood gushing from his upturned sleeve. He was\n30 moving round and holding the arm raised and hanging, as a dog holds\nan injured foot. Beside the horses lay a shattered man, drenched crimson\nfrom head to foot, with two great glazed eyes looking upwards through a\nmask of blood. Two comrades were at hand to help, and we could only go\nupon our way with the ghastly picture stamped for ever upon our mem-\n35 ory. The image of that dead driver might well haunt one in one\u2019s dreams.\nOnce through Templeux and on the main road for P\u00e9ronne things\nbecame less exciting, and we drew up to see a column of 900 prisoners\npass us. Each side of the causeway was lined by Australians, with their\n334 chapter 31\nkeen, clear-cut, falcon faces, and between lurched these heavy-jawed,\nbeetle-browed, uncouth louts, new caught and staring round with bewil-\ndered eyes at their debonair captors. I saw none of that relief at getting\nout of it which I have read of; nor did I see any signs of fear, but the pre-\nvailing impression was an ox-like stolidity and dullness. It was a herd of 5\nbeasts, not a procession of men. It was indeed farcical to think that these\nuniformed bumpkins represented the great military nation, while the\ngallant figures who lined the road belonged to the race which they had\ndespised as being unwarlike. Time and Fate between them have a pretty\nsense of humour. One of them caught my eye as he passed and roared out 10\nin guttural English, \u2018The old Jairman is out!\u2019 It was the only words I heard\nthem speak. French cavalry troopers, stern, dignified, and martial, rode\nat either end of the bedraggled procession.\nThey were great soldiers, these Australians. I think they would admit\nit themselves, but a spectator is bound to confirm it. There was a reckless 15\ndare-devilry, combined with a spice of cunning, which gave them a place\nof their own in the Imperial ranks. They had a great advantage too, in\nhaving a permanent organization, the same five divisions always in the\nsame corps, under the same chief. It doubled their military value \u2013 and\nthe same applied equally, of course, to the Canadians. None the less, they 20\nshould not undervalue their British comrades or lose their sense of pro-\nportion. I had a chance of addressing some 1,200 of them on our return\nthat evening, and while telling them all that I thought of their splendid\ndeeds, I ventured to remind them that 72 per cent of the men engaged\nand 76 per cent of the casualties were Englishmen of England. 25\nI think that now, in these after-war days, the whole world needs to\nbe reminded of this fact as well as the Australians did. There has been,\nit seems to me, a systematic depreciation of what the glorious English,\napart from the British, soldiers did. England is too big to be provincial,\nand smaller minds sometimes take advantage of it. At the time some of 30\nthe Australian papers slanged me for having given this speech to their sol-\ndiers, but I felt that it needed saying, and several of their officers thanked\nme warmly, saying that as they never saw anything save their own front,\nthey were all of them losing their sense of proportion. I shall not easily\nforget that speech, I standing on a mound in the rain, the Australian sol- 35\ndiers with cloaks swathed round them like brigands, and half a dozen aer-\noplanes, returning from the battle, circling overhead, evidently curious as\nto what was going on. It seems to me now like some extraordinary dream.\n335 bbrreeaakkiinngg tthhee hhiinnddeennbbuurrgg lliinnee\nSuch was my scamper to the Australian front. It was as if some huge\nhand had lifted me from my study table, placed me where I could see\nwhat I was writing about, and then within four days laid me down once\nmore before the familiar table, with one more wonderful experience add-\n5 ed to my record.\nAnd then at last came the blessed day of Armistice. I was in a staid\nLondon hotel at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, most prim of all the hours\nof the day, when a lady, well-dressed and conventional, came through the\nturning doors, waltzed slowly round the hall with a flag in either hand,\n10 and departed without saying a word. It was the first sign that things were\nhappening. I rushed out into the streets, and of course the news was\neverywhere at once. I walked down to Buckingham Palace and saw the\ncrowds assembling there, singing and cheering. A slim, young girl had\ngot elevated on to some high vehicle, and was leading and conducting the\n15 singing as if she was some angel in tweeds just dropped from a cloud. In\nthe dense crowd I saw an open motor stop with four middle-aged men,\none of them a hard-faced civilian, the others officers. I saw this civilian\nhack at the neck of a whisky bottle and drink it raw. I wish the crowd\nhad lynched him. It was the moment for prayer, and this beast was a blot\n20 on the landscape. On the whole the people were very good and orderly.\nLater more exuberant elements got loose. They say that it was when the\nAustralian wounded met the War Office flappers that the foundations of\nsolid old London got loosened. But we have little to be ashamed of, and\nif ever folk rejoiced we surely had the right to do so. We did not see the\n25 new troubles ahead of us, but at least these old ones were behind. And we\nhad gained an immense reassurance. Britain had not weakened. She was\nstill the Britain of old.\n336 Chapter 32\nTHE PSYCHIC QUEST\nI have not obtruded the psychic question upon the reader, though it 5\nhas grown in importance with the years, and has now come to absorb the\nwhole energy of my life. I cannot, however, close these scattered mem-\nories of my adventures in thought and action without some reference,\nhowever incomplete, to that which has been far the most important thing\nin my life. It is the thing for which every preceding phase, my gradual 10\nreligious development, my books, which gave me an introduction to the\npublic, my modest fortune, which enables me to devote myself to unlu-\ncrative work, my platform work, which helps me to convey the message,\nand my physical strength, which is still sufficient to stand arduous tours\nand to fill the largest halls for an hour and a half with my voice, have each 15\nand all been an unconscious preparation. For thirty years I have trained\nmyself exactly for the r\u00f4le without the least inward suspicion of whither\nI was tending.\nI cannot in the limited space of a chapter go into very lengthy detail\nor complete argument upon the subject. It is the more unnecessary since 20\nI have already in my psychic volumes outlined very clearly how I arrived\nat my present knowledge. Of these volumes the first and second, called\nrespectively The New Revelation and The Vital Message, show how gradual\nevidence was given me of the continuation of life, and how thorough and\nlong were my studies before I was at last beaten out of my material agnos- 25\ntic position and forced to admit the validity of the proofs.\nIn the days of universal sorrow and loss, when the voice of Rachel\nwas heard throughout the land, it was borne in upon me that the knowl-\nedge which had come to me thus was not for my own consolation alone,\nbut that God had placed me in a very special position for conveying it to 30\nthat world which needed it so badly.\nI found in the movement many men who saw the truth as clearly as I\ndid; but such was the clamour of the \u2018religious,\u2019 who were opposing that\nwhich is the very essence of living religion, of the \u2018scientific,\u2019 who broke\nthe first laws of Science by pronouncing upon a thing which they had 35\nnot examined, and of the Press, who held up every real or imaginary ras-\ncality as being typical of a movement which they had never understood,\nthat the true men were abashed and shrank from the public exposition of\n337 the psychic quest\ntheir views. It was to combat this that I began a campaign in 1916 which\ncan only finish when all is finished.\nOne grand help I had. My wife had always been averse from my psy-\nchic studies, deeming the subject to be uncanny and dangerous. Her own\n5 experiences soon convinced her to the contrary, for her brother, who was\nkilled at Mons, came back to us in a very convincing way. From that in-\nstant she threw herself with all the whole-hearted energy of her generous\nnature into the work which lay before us.\nA devoted mother, she was forced often to leave her children; a lover\n10 of home, she was compelled to quit it for many months at a time; dis-\ntrustful of the sea, she joyfully shared my voyages. We have now travelled\na good 50,000 miles upon our quest. We have spoken face to face with\na quarter of a million of people. Her social qualities, her clear sanity, her\nardent charity, and her gracious presence upon the platforms all united\n15 with her private counsel and sympathy, have been such an aid to me that\nthey have turned my work into a joy. The presence of our dear children\nupon our journeys has also lightened them for both of us.\nI began our public expositions of the subject by three years of inter-\nmittent lecturing in this country, during which period I visited nearly\n20 every town of importance, many of them twice and thrice. Everywhere I\nfound attentive audiences, critical, as they should be, but open to convic-\ntion. I roused antagonism only in those who had not heard me, and there\nwere demonstrations outside the doors, but never in the halls. I cannot\nremember a single interruption during that long series of addresses. It\n25 was interesting to notice how I was upheld, for though I was frequent-\nly very weary before the address, and though my war lectures had often\nbeen attended by palpitation of the heart, I was never once conscious of\nany fatigue during or after a lecture upon psychic subjects.\nOn August 13, 1920, we started for Australia. In proportion to her\n30 population she had lost almost as heavily as we during the war, and I felt\nthat my seed would fall upon fruitful ground. I have written all details of\nthis episode in my Wanderings of a Spiritualist, in which the reader will\nfind among other things some evidences of that preternatural help which\nwent with us in our journeys. I addressed large audiences in all the big\n35 towns of Australia and New Zealand. An unfortunate shipping strike pre-\nvented me from reaching Tasmania, but otherwise the venture was an\nunalloyed success. Contrary to expectation I was able to pay all the ex-\npenses of our large party (we were seven) and to leave a balance behind\n338 chapter 32\nme to help the successor whom I might choose.\nAt the end of March, 1921, we were back in Paris again, where, great-\nly daring, I lectured in French upon psychic subjects. Our stay at home\nwas not a very long one, for urgent invitations had come from America,\nwhere the Spiritual movement had fallen into a somewhat languishing 5\nstate. On April 1, 1922 our whole party started for the States. What hap-\npened to us I have recorded in Our American Adventure. Suffice it to say\nthat the trip was very successful, and that from Boston to Washington,\nand from New York to Chicago, I spoke in all the larger cities and brought\nabout a great revival of interest in the subject. We were back in England at 10\nthe beginning of July 1922.\nI was by no means satisfied about America, however, as we had not\ntouched the great West, the land of the future. Therefore we set forth\nagain in March 1923, getting back in August. Our adventures, which\nwere remarkable upon the psychic side, are recorded in Our Second 15\nAmerican Adventure. When I returned from that journey I had travelled\n55,000 miles in three years, and spoken to quarter of a million of people.\nI am still unsatisfied, however, for the Southern States of the Union have\nnot been touched, and it is possible that we may yet make a journey in\nthat direction. 20\nI have placed on record our experiences, and no doubt they have lit-\ntle interest at the moment for the general public, but the day will come,\nand that speedily, when people will understand that this proposition for\nwhich we are now fighting is far the most important thing for two thou-\nsand years in the history of the world, and when the efforts of the pio- 25\nneers will have a very real interest to all who have sufficient intelligence\nto follow the progress of human thought.\nI am only one of many working for the cause, but I hope that I may\nclaim that I brought into it a combative and aggressive spirit which it\nlacked before, and which has now so forced it upon public attention that 30\none can hardly pick up a paper without reading some comment upon it.\nIf some of these papers are hopelessly ignorant and prejudiced, it is not\na bad thing for the cause. If you have a bad case, constant publicity is a\nmisfortune, but if you have a good one, its goodness will always assert\nitself, however much it may be misrepresented. 35\nMany Spiritualists have taken the view that since we know these\ncomforting and wonderful things, and since the world chooses not to\nexamine the evidence, we may be content with our own happy assurance.\n339 the psychic quest\nThis seems to me an immoral view.\nIf God has sent a great new message of exceeding joy down to earth,\nthen it is for us, to whom it has been clearly revealed, to pass it on at any\ncost of time, money and labour. It is not given to us for selfish enjoyment,\n5 but for general consolation. If the sick man turns from the physician, then\nit cannot be helped, but at least the healing draught should be offered.\nThe greater the difficulty in breaking down the wall of apathy, igno-\nrance and materialism, the more is it a challenge to our manhood to at-\ntack and ever attack in the same bulldog spirit with which Foch faced the\n10 German lines.\nI trust that the record of my previous life will assure the reader that\nI have within my limitations preserved a sane and balanced judgment,\nsince I have never hitherto been extreme in my views, and since what I\nhave said has so often been endorsed by the actual course of events. But\n15 never have I said anything with the same certainty of conviction with\nwhich I now say that this new knowledge is going to sweep the earth and\nto revolutionize human views upon every topic save only on fundamen-\ntal morality, which is a fixed thing.\nAll modern inventions and discoveries will sink into insignificance\n20 beside those psychic facts which will force themselves within a few years\nupon the universal human mind.\nThe subject has been obscured by the introduction of all sorts of\nside issues, some of interest but not vital, others quite irrelevant. There\nis a class of investigator who loves to wander round in a circle, and to\n25 drag you with him if you are weak enough to accept such guidance. He\ntrips continually over his own brains, and can never persuade himself\nthat the simple and obvious explanation is also the true one. His intellect\nbecomes a positive curse to him, for he uses it to avoid the straight road\nand to fashion out some strange devious path which lands him at last\n30 in a quagmire, whilst the direct and honest mind has kept firmly to the\nhighway of knowledge. When I meet men of this type, and then come\nin contact with the lowly congregations of religious Spiritualists, I think\nalways of Christ\u2019s words when He thanked God that He had revealed\nthese things to babes and withheld them from the wise and the prudent.\n35 I think also of a dictum of Baron Reichenbach: \u2018There is a scientific in-\ncredulity which exceeds in stupidity the obtuseness of the clodhopper.\u2019\nBut what I say in no way applies to the reasonable researcher whose\nexperiences are real stepping-stones leading to his fixed conclusion.\n340 chapter 32\nThere must to every man be this novitiate in knowledge. The matter is\ntoo serious to be taken without due intellectual conviction.\nIt must not be imagined that I entirely deny the existence of fraud.\nBut it is far less common than is supposed, and as for its being universal,\nwhich is the theory of the conjurers and some other critics, such an opin- 5\nion is beyond reason or argument. In an experience with mediums which\nhas been excelled by very few living men, and which has embraced three\ncontinents, I have not encountered fraud more than three or four times.\nThere is conscious and unconscious fraud, and it is the existence of\nthe latter which complicates the question so badly. Conscious fraud usu- 10\nally arises from a temporary failure of real psychic power, and a conse-\nquent attempt to replace it by an imitation. Unconscious fraud comes in\nthat curious half-way state which I have called the \u2018half-trance condition\u2019\nwhen the medium seems normal, and yet is actually hardly responsible\nfor his actions. 15\nAt such a time the process by which his personality leaves his body\nseems to have set in, and his higher qualities have already passed, so that\nhe can apparently no longer inhibit the promptings received from the\nsuggestion of those around him, or from his own unchecked desires.\nThus one will find mediums doing stupid and obvious things which 20\nexpose them to the charge of cheating. Then if the observer disregards\nthese and waits, the true psychic phenomena of unmistakable character\nwill follow as he sinks more deeply into trance.\nThis was, I gather, noticeable in the case of Eusapia Paladino, but I\nhave seen it with several others. In those cases where a medium has left 25\nthe cabinet, and is found wandering about among the sitters, as has hap-\npened with Mrs. Corner, with Madame d\u2019Esperance, and with Craddock\n\u2013 all of them mediums who have given many proofs of their real powers \u2013\nI am convinced that the very natural supposition that they are fraudulent\nis really quite a mistaken one. 30\nWhen, on the other hand, it is found that the medium has introduced\nfalse drapery or accessories, which has sometimes occurred, we are in\nthe presence of the most odious and blasphemous crime which a human\nbeing can commit.\nPeople ask me, not unnaturally, what is it which makes me so per- 35\nfectly certain that this thing is true. That I am perfectly certain is surely\ndemonstrated by the mere fact that I have abandoned my congenial and\nlucrative work, left my home for long periods at a time, and subjected\n341 the psychic quest\nmyself to all sorts of inconveniences, losses, and even insults, in order to\nget the facts home to the people.\nTo give all my reasons would be to write a book rather than a chapter,\nbut I may say briefly that there is no physical sense which I possess which\n5 has not been separately assured, and that there is no conceivable method\nby which a spirit could show its presence which I have not on many oc-\ncasions experienced. In the presence of Miss Besinnet as medium and of\nseveral witnesses I have seen my mother and my nephew, young Oscar\nHornung, as plainly as ever I saw them in life \u2013 so plainly that I could\n10 almost have counted the wrinkles of the one and the freckles of the other.\nIn the darkness the face of my mother shone up, peaceful, happy,\nslightly inclined to one side, the eyes closed. My wife upon my right and\nthe lady upon my left both saw it as clearly as I did. The lady had not\nknown my mother in life but she said, \u2018How wonderfully like she is to her\n15 son,\u2019 which will show how clear was the detail of the features.\nOn another occasion my son came back to me. Six persons heard his\nconversation with me, and signed a paper afterwards to that effect. It was\nin his voice and concerned itself with what was unknown to the medium,\nwho was bound and breathing deeply in his chair. If the evidence of six\n20 persons of standing and honour may not be taken, then how can any hu-\nman fact be established?\nMy brother, General Doyle, came back with the same medium, but\non another occasion. He discussed the health of his widow. She was a\nDanish lady, and he wanted her to use a masseur in Copenhagen. He gave\n25 the name. I made inquiries and found that such a man did exist. Whence\ncame this knowledge? Who was it who took so close an interest in the\nhealth of this lady? If it was not her dead husband then who was it?\nAll fine-drawn theories of the subconscious go to pieces before the\nplain statement of the intelligence, \u2018I am a spirit. I am Innes. I am your\n30 brother.\u2019\nI have clasped materialized hands.\nI have held long conversations with the direct voice.\nI have smelt the peculiar ozone-like smell of ectoplasm.\nI have listened to prophecies which were quickly fulfilled.\n35 I have seen the \u2018dead\u2019 glimmer up upon a photographic plate which\nno hand but mine had touched.\nI have received through the hand of my own wife, notebooks full of\ninformation which was utterly beyond her ken.\n342 chapter 32\nI have seen heavy articles swimming in the air, untouched by human\nhand, and obeying directions given to unseen operators.\nI have seen spirits walk round the room in fair light and join in the\ntalk of the company.\nI have known an untrained woman possessed by an artist spirit, and 5\nrapidly produce a picture now hanging in my drawing-room which few\nliving painters could have bettered.\nI have read books which might have come from great thinkers and\nscholars, and which were actually written by unlettered men who acted\nas the medium of the unseen intelligence, so superior to his own. I have 10\nrecognized the style of a dead writer which no parodist could have cop-\nied, and which was written in his own handwriting.\nI have heard singing beyond earthly power, and whistling done with\nno pause for the intake of breath.\nI have seen objects from a distance projected into a room with closed 15\ndoors and windows.\nIf a man could see, hear, and feel all this, and yet remain unconvinced\nof unseen intelligent forces around him, he would have good cause to\ndoubt his own sanity. Why should he heed the chatter of irresponsible\njournalists, or the head-shaking of inexperienced men of science, when 20\nhe has himself had so many proofs? They are babies in this matter, and\nshould be sitting at his feet.\nIt is not, however, a question to be argued in a detached and imper-\nsonal way, as if one were talking of the Baconian theory or the existence\nof Atlantis. It is intimate, personal, and vital to the last degree. 25\nA closed mind means an earthbound soul, and that in turn means\nfuture darkness and misery. If you know what is coming, you can avoid it.\nIf you do not, you run grave risk. Some Jeremiah or Savonarola is needed\nwho will shriek this into the ears of the world. A new conception of sin\nis needed. The mere carnal frailties of humanity, the weaknesses of the 30\nbody, are not to be lightly condoned, but are not the serious part of the\nhuman reckoning. It is the fixed condition of mind, narrowness, bigotry,\nmaterialism \u2013 in a word, the sins not of the body, but of the spirit, which\nare the real permanent things, and condemn the individual to the lower\nspheres until he has learnt his lesson. 35\nWe know this from our rescue circles when these poor souls come\nback to bewail their errors and to learn those truths which they might\nhave learnt here, had their minds not been closed by apathy or prejudice.\n343 the psychic quest\nThe radical mistake which science has made in investigating the sub-\nject is that it has never troubled to grasp the fact that it is not the medium\nwho is producing the phenomena. It has always treated him as if he were\na conjurer, and said, \u2018Do this or do that,\u2019 failing to understand that little\n5 or nothing comes from him, but all or nearly all comes through him. I say\n\u2018nearly\u2019 all, for I believe that some simple phenomena, such as the rap,\ncan within limits be produced by the medium\u2019s own will.\nIt is this false view of science which has prevented sceptics from real-\nizing that a gentle and receptive state of mind on the part of sitters and an\n10 easy natural atmosphere for the medium are absolutely essential in order\nto produce harmony with the outside forces.\nIf in the greatest of all s\u00e9ances, that of the upper room on the day of\nPentecost, an aggressive sceptic had insisted upon test conditions of his\nown foolish devising, where would the rushing wind and the tongues\n15 of fire have been? \u2018All with one accord,\u2019 says the writer of the Acts of the\nApostles, and that is the essential condition. I have sat with saintly peo-\nple, and I too have felt the rushing wind, seen the flickering tongues and\nheard the great voice, but how could such results come where harmony\ndid not reign?\n20 That is the radical mistake which science has made. Men know well\nthat even in her own coarse, material work the presence of a scrap of met-\nal may upset the whole balance of a great magnetic installation, and yet\nthey will not take the word of those who are in a position to speak from\nexperience that a psychic condition may upset a psychic experiment.\n25 But indeed when we speak of science in this connection it is a con-\nfusion of thought. The fact that a man is a great zoologist like Lankester,\nor a great physicist like Tyndall or Faraday, does not give his opinion any\nweight in a subject which is outside his own specialty. There is many an\nunknown Smith and Jones whose twenty years of practical work have\n30 put him in a far stronger position than that of these intolerant scientists;\nwhile as to the real Spiritualist leaders, men of many experiences and\nmuch reading and thought, it is they who are the real scientific experts\nwho are in a position to teach the world. One does not lose one\u2019s judg-\nment when one becomes a Spiritualist. One is as much a researcher as\n35 ever, but one understands better what it is that one is studying and how\nto study it.\nThis controversy with bumptious and ignorant people is a mere\npassing thing which matters nothing. The real controversy, which does\n344 chapter 32\nmatter very much, is with the Continental school who study ectoplasm\nand other semi-material manifestations, but who have not got the length\nof seeing independent spirit behind them. Richet, Schrenk-Notzing and\nother great investigators are still in this midway position, and Flammari-\non is little more advanced. Richet goes the length of admitting that he has 5\nassured himself by personal observation of the materialized form that it\ncan walk and talk and leave moulds of its hands. So far he has gone. And\nyet even now he clings to the idea that these phenomena may be the ex-\nternalization of some latent powers of the human body and mind.\nSuch an explanation seems to me to be the desperate defence of the 10\nlast trench by one of those old-time materialists, who say with Brewster:\n\u2018Spirit is the last thing which we will concede,\u2019 adding as their reason \u2018it\nupsets the work of fifty years.\u2019 It is hard when a man has taught all his life\nthat the brain governs spirit to have to learn after all that it may be spirit\nwhich acts independently of the human brain. But it is their super-mate- 15\nrialism which is the real difficulty with which we now have to contend.\nAnd what is the end of it all?\nI have no idea. How could those who first noted the electric twitch-\ning of muscles foresee the Atlantic cable or the arc lamp? Our informa-\ntion is that some great shock is coming shortly to the human race which 20\nwill finally break down its apathy, and which will be accompanied by\nsuch psychic signs that the survivors will be unable any longer to deny\nthe truths which we preach.\nThe real meaning of our movement will then be seen, for it will be-\ncome apparent that we have accustomed the public mind to such ideas, 25\nand provided a body of definite teaching, both scientific and religious, to\nwhich they can turn for guidance.\nAs to the prophecy of disaster, I admit that we have to be on our\nguard. Even the Christ circle was woefully deceived, and declared con-\nfidently that the world would not survive their own generation. Various 30\ncreeds, too, have made vain predictions of the end of the world.\nI am keenly aware of all this, and also of the difficulty in reckoning\ntime when seen from the other side. But, making every allowance for this,\nthe information upon the point has been so detailed, and has reached me\nfrom so many entirely independent sources, that I have been forced to 35\ntake it seriously, and to think that some great watershed of human expe-\nrience may be passed within a few years \u2013 the greatest, we are told, that\nour long-suffering race has yet encountered.\n345 tthhee ppssyycchhiicc qquueesstt\nPeople who have not gone into the subject may well ask, \u2018But what\ndo you get out of it? How are you the better?\u2019 We can only answer that all\nlife has changed to us since this definite knowledge has come. No longer\nare we shut in by death. We are out of the valley and up on the ridge, with\n5 vast clear vistas before us.\nWhy should we fear a death which we know for certain is the door-\nway to unutterable happiness?\nWhy should we fear our dear ones\u2019 death if we can be so near to them\nafterwards?\n10 Am I not far nearer to my son than if he were alive and serving in\nthat Army Medical Service which would have taken him to the ends of\nthe earth? There is never a month, often never a week, that I do not com-\nmune with him. Is it not evident that such facts as these change the whole\naspect of life, and turn the grey mist of dissolution into a rosy dawn?\n15 You may say that we have already all these assurances in the Christian\nrevelation. It is true, and that is why we are not anti-Christian so long\nas Christianity is the teaching of humble Christ and not of his arrogant\nrepresentatives.\nEvery form of Christianity is represented in our ranks, often by cler-\n20 gymen of the various denominations. But there is nothing precise in the\ndefinitions of the other world as given in the holy writings. The informa-\ntion we have depicts a heaven of congenial work and of congenial play,\nwith every mental and physical activity of life carried on to a higher plane\n\u2013 a heaven of art, of science, of intellect, of organization, of combat with\n25 evil, of home circles, of flowers, of wide travel, of sports, of the mating\nof souls, of complete harmony. This is what our \u2018dead\u2019 friends describe.\nOn the other hand, we hear from them, and sometimes directly, of the\nhells, which are temporary spheres of purification. We hear of the mists,\nthe darkness, the aimless wanderings, the mental confusion, the remorse.\n30 \u2018Our condition is horrible,\u2019 wrote one of them to me recently at a\ns\u00e9ance. These things are real and vivid and provable to us. That is why we\nare an enormous force for the resuscitation of true religion, and why the\nclergy take a heavy responsibility when they oppose us.\nThe final result upon scientific thought is unthinkable, save that the\n35 sources of all force would be traced rather to spiritual than to material causes.\nIn religion one can perhaps see a little more clearly. Theology and dog-\nma would disappear.\nPeople would realize that such questions as the number of persons in\n346 chapter 32\nGod, or the process of Christ\u2019s birth, have no bearing at all upon the de-\nvelopment of man\u2019s spirit, which is the sole object of life.\nAll religions would be equal, for all alike produce gentle, unselfish\nsouls who are God\u2019s elect. Christian, Jew, Buddhist, and Mohammedan\nwould shed their distinctive doctrines, follow their own high teachers 5\non a common path of morality, and forget all that antagonism which has\nmade religion a curse rather than a blessing to the world.\nWe shall be in close touch with other-world forces, and knowledge\nwill supersede that faith which has in the past planted a dozen different\nsignposts to point in as many different directions. 10\nSuch will be the future, so far as I can dimly see it, and all this will\nspring from the seed which now we tend and water amid the cold blasts\nof a hostile world.\nDo not let it be thought that I claim any special leadership in this\nmovement. I do what I can, but many others have done what they could 15\n\u2013 many humble workers who have endured loss and insult, but who will\ncome to be recognized as the modern Apostles. For my part, I can only\nclaim that I have been an instrument so fashioned that I have had some\nparticular advantages in getting this teaching across to the people.\nThat is the work which will occupy, either by voice or pen, the re- 20\nmainder of my life. What immediate shape it will take I cannot say. Hu-\nman plans are vain things, and it is better for the tool to lie passive until\nthe great hand moves it once more.\nTHE END 25\n347 "}
