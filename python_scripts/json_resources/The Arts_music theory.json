Cook serves as Director for Music Theory\nand Composition at Shepherd University. He is also a\nmember of the Jazz Studies Faculty. Prior to his\nappointment at Shepherd, he served as a member of the\nMusic Theory Faculty and was the Jazz Ensemble\nDirector at The Catholic University of America.\nAdditionally, he served as an Adjunct Music Theory\nInstructor at Towson University. He also taught Music Theory, Jazz Studies, History\nand Applied subjects at Montgomery College. He served as the Director of Jazz\nEnsembles and Wind Ensemble, and as Music Director and Conductor for The\nMontgomery College Symphony Orchestra. In addition to teaching at Shepherd\nUniversity, Dr. Cook is Guest Lecturer in Music Theory and Composition at The\nBarbara Ingram School for the Arts.\nHe received his B.M.ed. from the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University,\nand both his Master\u2019s degree and Ph.D. in Music Theory from The Catholic\nUniversity of America, his dissertation being an analysis (proportional organization\nand set analysis) of Paul Hindemith\u2019s symphonyDie Harmonie der Welt.\nHe is an active composer and performer in both the Classical and Jazz styles and has\nmany performing and recording credits.\n1 Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank the following colleagues who have reviewed the text\nand provided comprehensive feedback and suggestions for improving the material:\n\u2022 Kurtis Adams, Shepherd University\n\u2022 Laura Renninger, Shepherd University\n\u2022 David Gonzol, Shepherd University\n\u2022 Scott Beard, Shepherd University\n\u2022 Chris Vadala, University of Maryland, College Park\n\u2022 William Hollin, The Barbara Ingram School for the Arts\n\u2022 Scott Benford, Washington County (MD) Public Schools\n\u2022 Michael Thorsen, Principal, The Barbara Ingram School for the Arts\n\u2022 Paul Garvin Taylor, The Catholic University of America\n\u2022 Steven Strunk, The Catholic University of America\n\u2022 Lawren Diana Hill\nIn addition, a select group of instructors assisted the development of this material\nby actually using it in their classrooms. Their input, along with their students\u2019\nfeedback, has provided us critical confirmation that the material is effective in the\nclassroom:\n2 Dedication\nIn Memoriam\nDr. Robert Wayne Ricks\nHe always compelled me to \u201ctake a closer look and let the Music tell its own story.\u201d\n3 Foreword\nThis text is primarily designed to serve as a textbook for a college-level music\ntheory fundamentals course. However, it also has the flexibility to serve equally\nwell for a typical core curriculum college-level Music Theory I or Harmony I course.\nOur goal is to deliver sufficient information to enable the student to be able to\nevaluate and analyze select music from the literature as quickly as is practical.\nSecondly, we seek to provide sufficient instruction to enable a student to begin\nwriting music as quickly as is practical.\nIn order to develop a complete argument, it is important that the student\nunderstand that this text \u201cassumes a blank slate.\u201d No prior knowledge on the part\nof the student is assumed.\nIn order to give Instructors greater flexibility we have intentionally provided\ncontent that may exceed the course objectives in some institutions. We anticipate\nthat instructors may want to adjust the material in the text to match their current\ncourse content, or adjust their courses to make use of all of the content in this text.\n4 Preface\nThe manner in which music theory has been traditionally taught is now in a state of\nflux. Originally, the study of music theory was designed to acquaint the music\nstudent or knowledgeable amateur with the composer\u2019s working materials in\n\u201cClassical\u201d music roughly spanning the 17th- through the 19th Centuries.\nThe role of music theory has expanded far beyond this mandate: theory training\nnow incorporates greater or lesser explanations of music after 1900, music before\n1600, idiomatic Jazz practices, elements of World Music, and Popular Song idioms.\nSuch an expansion of means and methods in learning and teaching the fundamental\nlanguage of music presents a formidable and almost daunting challenge: what to\nteach, how to teach it, and in what sequence?\nAdditionally, music theory has become a favored required Arts elective in College\nand University curricula, and most music programs have a developmental music\ntheory class to address the needs of under-prepared music majors. Often, music\ntheory is required companion material for private instruction as well.\nThis textbook seeks to address these multiple needs: to serve as a basic to moderate\ntext for the typical fundamentals of music course and to serve as an introductory\ntext for those interested in acquiring a rudimentary knowledge of the language of\nmusic.\nThe text also provides supplemental information, such as chord symbolization,\naspects of Jazz harmony, vernacular song form and its attributes, and so on. Usually\nwhen this material is added to existing texts, it is incomplete and delivered in a\nmanner that reflects only limited real-world experience.\nThis author is fortunate to have had extensive experience as a teacher of music\ntheory at the college and university level, as a teacher of AP music theory in an Arts\nMagnet high school, as a teacher of the Jazz idiom, as a practicing Classical and Jazz\nmusician, and as a composer in many styles.\nTherefore the scope of this text is to:\n5 Preface\n\u2022 Provide clear and concise explanations regarding the basic language of\nmusic;\n\u2022 Address appropriate subject matter for use by the instructor of college-\nlevel introductory/developmental theory courses, as well as typical\nMusic Theory I courses;\n\u2022 Add other relevant information, usually acquired informally by the\nstudent outside the classroom;\n\u2022 Support each learning objective or skill set with reinforcement in the\nform of exercises;\n\u2022 Prepare the student for a continuing study of music theory at\nintermediate to advanced levels.\nThe format of the text and its scope will easily adapt itself to any of these\ncircumstances for the instructor or for the student. The modular approach and the\ncomplete flexibility in terms of the online access and individualized customization\nenhance the facility with which the text may be employed.\nFor example, a typical Fundamentals class may not require an examination of the\nSATB style and part-writing procedures. In contrast, these would be critical skills\nfor a Music Theory I course. The Instructor can freely choose what material suits a\ngiven need without resorting to an additional text. The multiple methods of access,\nelectronically and in print, offer both instructor and student an elastic approach to\nthe subject matter.\nIntroduction\nA Definition of Music\nIn it\u2019s broadest possible sense, music is defined as \u201corganized sound.\u201d This open-\nended and safe definition is coherent regardless of era, style, culture, or the\nmechanics of musical organization. Each successive historical era produces\nmusically artistic expressions of its own time, its own musical aura. The study of\nMusic Theory is the means by which we investigate this.\nA Definition of Music Theory\nMusic Theory is the study of music and its organizational characteristics. We define\nand examine aspects of music:\n\u2022 How do we perceive music aurally?\n\u2022 How do we experience music aesthetically and?\n\u2022 How do we symbolize music visually?\n6 Preface\nWe learn to associate sound with symbol (or notation), so to increase our ability to\nperceive music at levels of increasing depth and comprehension, both\nexperientially and analytically.\nThe Purpose of Music Theory\nThe study of the language of music yields three unshakeable tenets:\n\u2022 We learn to analyze music in order to gain an understanding of the\nhow great composers create. We use it as a \u201cwindow\u201d into their minds,\nif you will;\n\u2022 We learn to analyze music in order to deepen our own understanding,\neither as musicians or consumers of this form of artistic expression.\n\u2022 We employ the knowledge gained in the study of music to stimulate\nand enhance our own creativity.\nAmong the community of musicians, the greater our comprehension, the more\nsublime our interpretation. This creates a more meaningful experience for our\naudience. This is the ultimate focus of the study of music.\nAs consumers, the more we understand about music, the more refined is our ability\nto intelligently evaluate what we enjoy. It is the intelligent consumer of Art who is\nthe greatest supporter of Art.\nThe Means by which We Investigate Music\nExamining music involves evaluation. At any level of experience, this begins with\npersonal taste and preference. As we learn more, our method of evaluation evolves,\nbecoming both more fluent and more critical. Clearly, over time and study, this\nshapes our perceptions and our tastes, regardless of what general direction these\nmay take.\nAny study begins with an examination of fundamental precepts or principles. Music\nis no different. The nature of perception, the basic constructs, craftsmanship in\nmusical construction: all must be mastered in the study of music.\nTwo broad approaches are employed in the study of music:\n\u2022 Analysis: we learn to employ commonly accepted techniques and\nspecialized language to describe musical organization. These\n7 Preface\ntechniques are a shared analytical language throughout the\ncommunity of musicians. This is conceptual knowledge and evaluation.\n\u2022 Composition: either by actively creating our own works, or (more\nlikely for the beginner), imitating or emulating the works of earlier\ncomposers. This is active knowledge and procedure.\nBoth of these approaches will evolve as the student acquires more knowledge, skill,\nand greater understanding.\nHow We Perceive Music\nAt the most primary level, we experience music by five principal distinctive\ncharacteristics.\n\u2022 Pitch: we perceive the sensation of sound (or tone) as relatively high or\nlow.\n\u2022 Duration: we perceive how much time sound (or silence) occupies.\n\u2022 Timbre: we perceive various qualities or \u201ccolors\u201d of sound.\n\u2022 Intensity: we perceive differences in volume or sound pressure levels.\n\u2022 Events in time: we perceive pitch collections (events) in the context of\nmusical space (time).\nThese broad generalized definitions and concepts serve us well as a departure\npoint. We can now progress from the general to the specific in our study.\nEpigraph\n\u201cThe man that hath no music in himself,\nNor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,\nIs fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.\u201d\n-The Merchant of Venice (V, i)\n8 Chapter 1\nThe Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nIntroduction\nThe first musical stimulus anyone reacts to is rhythm. Initially, we perceive how\nmusic is organized in time, and how musical elements are organized rhythmically\nin relation to each other. Early Western music, centering upon the chant traditions\nfor liturgical use, wasarhythmicto a great extent: the flow of the Latin text was the\nprincipal determinant as to how the melody progressed through time.\nAs Western music moved frommonodytopolyphony(\u201csingle voice\u201d to \u201cmultiple\nvoices\u201d), sets of symbols developed gradually that allowed musical time to be\nestablished against a recurring background pulse. This also allowed multiple\nelements in music to be established in tandem with one another. These symbols\nevolved into thedurational values(\u201cnote values\u201d) that form the foundation for music\nnotation.\n9 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describing durational values orthographically: how they are drawn.\n2. Defining durational values in proportional relationship to one another.\n3. Defining durational values in musical time and space.\nDurational values1are symbols that represent time and action in musical space:\nthey delineate and mark off varying values of sound (and silence) in a composition.\nAdditionally, they are proportional to one another as to how they may be divided\nfrom larger into smaller values.\nThere have been many differing notational systems throughout the history of\nmusic. In the context of other study, you may encounter these various and sundry\nsystems from early Western notational traditions. Our current system of notation\nevolved from these early systems, incorporating aspects of many.\nComponents of Notes\nLet us first examine how durational values are drawn:\nFigure 1.1 Components\nNote values may be \u201copen notes\u201d (not filled in or blackened), or \u201cfilled-in notes.\u201d In\nthe context of how musical time is organized (discussed below), these will have\ngreater or lesser lengths or time spans.Chapter 2 \"The Elements of Pitch:Sound,\nSymbol, and Tone\"will discuss general rules and practices as to how note values are\ndrawn in the context of pitch placement.In the following example they are not yet\nassigned any particular value: only proportional values in relation to each other.\n1.Durational Values are those\nsymbols (\u201cnote values\u201d) that\nare used to represent the\nrelative length of a particular\nsound in music.\n10 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nDurational Values and Proportional Chain\nBelow are examples of basic durational values and their common names. Proper\nnames for these values are in parentheses. These names are commonly used in the\nUnited Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, as well as by some academics.\nFigure 1.2 Durational Values and Nomenclature\nThere are rare examples of \u201cOne-hundred and twenty-eighth-notes.\u201d A notable\nexample is found in the First Movement Introduction to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cPathetique\u201d\nSonata No. 8, Opus 13.\n\u201cPathetique\u201d Sonata\nThese occur at the end of the Introduction. See this link:\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No.8,_Op.13_(Beethoven,_Ludwig_van)\nDurational values are held in proportion to one another. Observe that each value is\nproportionally related to adjacent values. If we assign the arbitrary value \u201c1n\u201d to a\nwhole-note, then the half-note equals 1/2n. Therefore two half-notes are required\nto equal a whole note, two quarter-notes equal a half-note and so on.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 11 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.3 Durational Value Chain\nTremolo\nAt times notes may have a diagonal slash (or slashes) through the stem, or below a\nnote value that has no stem. These slashes are interpreted one of two ways:\n1. These indicate atremolo, the performer rapidly repeating the note, or;\n2. As a notational convenience, slashes represent flags, denoting\nembedded smaller durational values:\nFigure 1.4 Smaller Value \u201cSlashes\u201d (Tremolo)\nThese can be interpreted as \u201ceighth-notes in the space of a half-note\u201d (4), or\nsixteenth-notes in the space of a quarter,\u201d (4) and so on. This is merely a notational\nconvenience employed as needed.\n2.Durational Values may be non-\ndotted or dotted. Dotted Values\nhave three interpretations: (1) Dotted Values\nThe dot represents the\naddition of half the original\nvalue; (2) The dotted value may Durational values may have small periods (\u201cdots\u201d) appended to them. Originally,\ndivide into two lower dotted\nthis evolved as a notational \u201cconvenience,\u201d a proportional division indication, or as\nvalues; (3) Or the dotted value\na segment boundary.Dotted values2have three different interpretations:\nmay divide into three non-\ndotted values. This potential\ndivision into three is critical\nfor comprehending Compound\nMeter.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 12 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\n1. A dotted value may represent the addition of half of the original\nduration, or \u201chalf again as much as the original value\u201d (\u201c1+1/2n\u201d).\nFigure 1.5 Dotted Values: First Interpretation\n2. A dotted value may be divisible into three non-dotted values:\nFigure 1.6 Dotted Values: Second Interpretation\n3. A dotted value may be divisible into two smaller dotted values:\nFigure 1.7 Dotted Values: Third Interpretation\nThese varying uses of dotted values shall come into focus in subsequent discussions\nconcerning meter and notational practice inSection 1.2 \"Pulse, Tempo, and Meter\"\nandSection 1.3 \"Music Notation Practices\"below. As with non-dotted values, dotted\nvalues are in proportion to one another as well.Figure 1.8 \"Dotted Values\"shows\nthe proportional chain of dotted values.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 13 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.8 Dotted Values\nRests\nJust as durational values represent the length of sound in music, symbols of\nequivalent value represent the length of silence. These are calledrests3.Figure 1.9\n\"Rests\"shows rests and their labels. As with durational values, rests are\nproportional to one another also.\nFigure 1.9 Rests\n3.Rests are the symbols used to\nrepresent the relative length of\nsilence in music. They are\nequivalent in value to\ndurations.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 14 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe student should understand:\n\u2022 Musical time is represented by symbols called durational values. They\nmay be dotted or non-dotted.\n\u2022 Durational values: specific components and specific ways how they are\ndrawn.\n\u2022 Durational values are proportional to one another.\n\u2022 Durational values have equivalent rest values.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 15 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nEXERCISES\n1. Practice drawing durational values and rests following the model\nbelow. Make sure to draw noteheads correctly (no \u201cstick figures\u201d\nplease!).\nFigure 1.10\nDurations and Rests\n2. For each value given, draw three lower divisions: for example,\ngiven a whole-note, draw two half-notes, four quarter-notes,\neight eighth-notes. Use flags and beams (ligatures). Make sure to\nalign and space properly. See sample solution.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 16 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.11\nDuration Divisions\n3. For each value given below, draw the appropriate equivalent\nrest.\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 17 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.12\nEquivalent Rests\n4. For each dotted value:\na. Draw the appropriate dotted lower divisions, for example, a\ndotted half-note dividing into two dotted quarter-notes.\nb. Draw the appropriate non-dotted lower divisions, for\nexample, a dotted half-note dividing into three quarter-\nnotes.\nc. Draw the appropriate durational values that represent the\naddition of half the basic value. For example, a dotted half-\nnote is a half-note plus a quarter-note (\u201chalf again as\nmuch\u201d).\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 18 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.13\nDotted Values\n5. For each incomplete example below, add the appropriate\ndurational value that will complete the background value.\nFigure 1.14\nIncomplete Values\n1.1 Durational Values: Symbols Representing Time in Music 19 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Definitions of the elements of rhythmic organization.\n2. Perception of Tempo and commonly used terms.\n3. Mapping out meter (time signatures): the perception of Simple and\nCompound Time.\n4. How these elements interact in music.\nWe perceive the organization of time in music in terms of three fundamental\nelements,Pulse,Tempo, andMeter. Use prompts to assist you in understanding these\nelements:\n\u2022 Pulse\u2014\u201cbeat\u201d: the background \u201cheartbeat\u201d of a piece of music.\n\u2022 Tempo\u2014\u201crate\u201d: the relatively fast or slow speed at which we perceive\nthepulsein a piece of music.\n\u2022 Meter\u2014\u201cratio\u201d: how durational values are assigned to represent the\npulseare organized in discrete segments in a piece of music.\nPulse and Tempo\nPulse4, orbeat, is the regularly recurring underlying pulsation that we perceive that\ncompels music to progress through time. Pulse makes us reactkinestheticallyto\nmusic: in other words, it compels motion. We tap our feet, we dance, we march, or\nwe may just \u201cfeel\u201d the pulse internally.\nIn a piece of music, some durational value is assigned to be the pulse. All other\ndurations are proportionally related to that fundamental background pulse.\nTempo5(Latin:tempus-\u201ctime\u201d) is the rate (or relative speed) at which the pulse\nflows through time. This is determined by numerous methods:\n4.Pulse (or beat) is the regularly\nrecurring background\npulsation in music.\n1. A metronome marking: for example, MM=120 means the pulse\n5.Tempo is the rate at which we\nprogresses at 120 beats per minute (two beats per second). Often, in\nperceive the pulse in time. This\npractice, the background durational value will be drawn and assigned a\nis indicated by metronome\nmarkings, pulse value\nmarkings and terms.\n20 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nmetronomic value. (You will sometimes encounter the markingbpm,\n\u201cbeats per minute.\u201d)\nFigure 1.15 Metronome Marking and Pulse Marking\n2. Around the 17th Century (roughly!), Italian terms came to be used to\nindicate tempo. These terms were descriptive and therefore rather\nloosely interpreted as to exact tempo. These terms indicate a narrow\n\u201crange\u201d of metronomic speeds. For example, the termAndantemeans\n\u201cgoing\u201d or \u201ca walking tempo.\u201d This usually equates to roughly 76 beats\nper minute, but may be interpreted at a slightly faster or slightly\nslower pace.\n3. In an attempt to refine these terms, to make them more precise,\ndiminutives were added:Andantinoindicates a slightly faster pace than\nAndante. Other modifiers came into common practice as well. For\nexample,Andante con moto(\u201cgoing, with motion\u201d) is self-explanatory.\nBeginning in the 19th Century, composers often used equivalent tempo\nand performance descriptions in their native languages, or mixed\nItalianate terms and vernacular terms within the same piece.\n4. It is important to understand that the use of these terms exceeded\nmere indications of relative speed. Often, they also carry the\nconnotation of style or performance practice. For example,Allegro con\nbrio(\u201clively, with fire or brilliance\u201d) implies a stylisticmannerof\nperformance, not merely a rate at which the pulse progresses through\ntime.Chapter 19 \"Appendix A: Common Musical Terms\"lists common\nterms and their commonly accepted meanings along with some\nequivalents in other languages.\nMeter and Time Signatures\nMeter6, expressed in music as atime signature, determines:\n1. Which durational value is assigned to represent the fundamental\nbackground pulse;\n6.Meter is the \u201cratio\u201d of how 2. How these pulses are grouped together in discrete segments;\nmany of what type of pulse\n3. How these pulses naturally subdivide into lesser durational values,\nvalues are grouped together.\nand;\nSimple Meter divides the pulse\ninto two equal portions; 4. The relative strength of pulses (perceived accents) within segments or\nCompound Meter divides the groupings of pulses.Concerning accentuation of pulse, you will\npulse into three equal portions.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 21 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nencounter the termsArsisandThesis, terms adapted from Hellenistic\npoetic meter. These have come to mean \u201cupbeat\u201d and \u201cdownbeat\u201d\nrespectively. These are nearly slang definitions or, at best, jargon.Arsis\nis best described as \u201cpreparatory,\u201d hence perceived as a relatively\nweak pulse. Thesis is best described as \u201caccentuated,\u201d hence relatively\nstrong. It is interesting to note that, at various times in the history of\nmusic, the meaning of these two terms has been reversed from time to\ntime.\nTime signatures7consist of two numbers, one over another, placed at the\nbeginning of a composition. They may occur anywhere in a composition where a\nmeter change is required. They are NEVER written as fractions!\nSimple and Compound Meter\nTo understand meter fully, we must first determine the fundamental nature of the\nprevailing background pulse or beat. In given meters, we perceive beats as having\nthe potential (or capacity) of being divided in two ways:\n1. The prevailing background pulse may be subdivided intotwo\nproportionally equal portions. Meters having this attribute are labeled\nSimple Meter(orSimple time).\n2. The prevailing background pulse may be subdivided intothree\nproportionally equal portions. Meters having this attribute are labeled\nCompound Meter(Compound time).\nWe name meters according to two criteria:\n1. Is itSimpleorCompoundtime?\n2. How many prevailing background pulses are grouped together?\nFigure 1.16 Simple and Compound Divisions of Given Pulses\n7.Meter is expressed as time\nsignatures, indicating how\nmany pulses (beats) are\ngrouped together into cogent\nunits.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 22 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nSo, a time signature wherein (a) the pulse subdivides into two portions, and (b) two\npulses are grouped together is calledSimple Duple. Three pulses grouped together,\nSimple Tripleand so forth. A time signature wherein (a) the pulse subdivides into\nthree portions, and (b) two pulses are grouped together is calledCompound Duple,\nthree pulses,Compound Triple, and so forth.\nFigure 1.17 Time Signatures and Labels\nSimple Meter\nLet us address simple meter first. Analyze this by answering two questions\nconcerning the stated time signature:\n1. For the top number: \u201cHow many\u2026?\u201d In other words, how many\nprevailing background pulse values (or their relative equivalent\nvalues and/or rests) are grouped together?\n2. For the bottom number: \u201c\u2026of what kind?\u201d In other words, what\ndurational value has been assigned to represent the prevailing\nbackground pulse?\nSo the time signature 2has two quarter-notes grouped together, therefore, we label\n4\nthis as Simple Duple.\nFigure 1.18 Typical Simple Meters\nIn Renaissance music, specialized symbols were employed that were the forerunner\nof time signatures. These symbols determined how relative durational values were\nheld in proportion to one another. We continue to employ two holdovers from this\nsystem.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 23 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.19 \u201cCommon Time\u201d and \u201cCut Time\u201d\n\u201cCommon Time\u201d and \u201cCut Time,\u201d are slang terms. Other names for \u201cCut Time\u201d are\n\u201cMarch Time\u201d and the proper name,Alla Breve.\nThe Time Signature Table\nThe characteristics of individual time signatures are perceived in multiple layers\nthat can be reduced to three basic levels:\n1. The prevailing backgroundPulseor beat.\n2. First Division: the level wherein we determine if the pulse divides into\ntwo equal portions (simple meter) or three equal portions (compound\nmeter).\n3. Subdivisions: how First Division values subdivide into proportionally\nsmaller values.\nTherefore, we can graph time signatures using the following table.\nTable 1.1Time Signature Table\nPulse (The fundamental background pulse.)\nFirst Division (The level determining pulse division into two portions or three portions.)\nSubdivisions (Subsequent divisions into smaller values.)\nFigure 1.20 Time Signature Table Example\nUse this table to map out time signatures and their component organizational\nlayers.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 24 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nCompound Meter\nUnderstanding compound meters is somewhat more complex. Several preparatory\nstatements will assist in comprehension:\n1. Compound Meters have certain characteristics that will enable\nprompt recognition:\na. The upper number is 3 or a multiple of 3.\nb. The prevailing background pulse must be a dotted value:\nremember, in compound meter, the pulse must have the capacity\nto divide into three equal portions.\nc. Subdivisions of the background pulse are usually grouped in sets of\nthree by the use of beams (ligatures).\n2. In theory, any Compound Meter may be perceived as Simple\nMeter,depending upon the tempo:\na. If a tempo is slow enough, any compound time signature may be\nperceived as a simple meter.\nb. In practice, this is limited by style and context in compositions.\n3. In Compound Meter, the written time signature represents the\nlevel of First Division,not Pulse:\na. In order to find the pulse value in compound time signatures, use\nthe Time Signature Table. List First Division values (the written\ntime signature) in groupings of three.\nb. Sum these to the dotted value representing Pulse. List these\naccordingly in the Table.\nAs with Simple time signatures, let us employ the same Time Signature Table to\ngraph Compound time signatures. ReviewingStatement 3above, we will follow a\nslightly different procedure than that used for graphing Simple Meter:\n1. For the Compound Duple time signature 6list six eighth-notes in two\n8\ngroupings of three in the First Division row:\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 25 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.21 Compound Meter, First Division Groupings\n2. Next, sum these groupings of three into dotted values (\u201ctwo eighth-\nnotes equal a quarter-note, the additional quarter-note represented by\na dot\u201d); list the two resulting dotted quarter-notes in the Pulse row:\nFigure 1.22 Sum to Find Compound Pulse Value\n3. Lastly, draw subdivisions of the First Division values in the Subdivision\nrow:\nFigure 1.23 Subdivision\nBelow are typical compound meters and their respective labels.\nFigure 1.24 Typical Compound Meters\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 26 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nNote that Simple meters divide all values into two subdivisions in each level of the\nTable. Compound meters divide the First Division level into three (seeStatement 1\nabove). Subsequent subdivisions divide into two.\nSimple Triple Interpreted as Compound Meter\nSome Simple Triple time signatures may be perceived as either simple or\ncompound, again depending upon tempo. In practice, this is a limited list: The time\nsignatures:\n3 3 3\n16 8 4\nmay be perceived as Simple Triple if the tempo is relatively slow. In other words,\nyou perceive the \u201clower number\u201d of the time signature as the fundamental\nbackground pulse value. As the tempo for any of these becomes relatively faster, we\ncease to perceive the lower number as Pulse. Instead we perceive the lower number\nas the First Division of a Compound meter.\nThe Time Signature Table will show this:\nFigure 1.25 Simple Triple, Compound \u201cSingle\u201d\nIn the next section, these fundamental elements of sound, symbol, and time will be\nplaced in full musical context by uniting them with common notational practices.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 27 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe student should be able to define and understand:\n\u2022 Pulse (\u201cbeat\u201d), Tempo (\u201crate\u201d), and Meter (\u201cratio\u201d).\n\u2022 Simple Meter: recognizing and analyzing Simple Time Signatures.\n\u2022 Compound Meter: recognizing and analyzing Compound Time\nSignatures.\n\u2022 Time Signatures that may be perceived as either Simple or Compound\nand why they are so perceived.\n\u2022 Using the Time Signature Table as a tool for graphing Time Signatures.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 28 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nEXERCISES\n1.

In class (or some group), practice tapping a slow beat with your left foot.\nAgainst that beat tap two equal (\u201ceven\u201d) divisions with your right hand\n(simple division). Next, keeping that same slow beat in your left foot,\npractice tapping three equal (\u201ceven\u201d) divisions with your right hand\n(compound division). Lastly, switch hands and feet. Good luck.\n4. The following exercises alternate between simple duple and\ncompound duple. Tap these rhythms while keeping the same\nconstant background pulse. Practice each segment separately at\nfirst: then practice in sequence, switching from simple to\ncompound time as you go.\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 30 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.26\nRhythm Drill\n1.2 Pulse, Tempo, and Meter 31 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\n1.3 Music Notation Practices\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Defining and understanding measures and bar lines.\n2. Defining and recognizing sectional directions: \u201cRoadmaps\u201d in music.\n3. Learning basic conducting patterns.\nInSection 1.2 \"Pulse, Tempo, and Meter\", when describing meter and time\nsignatures, we spoke of \u201cgrouping pulse values together\u201d to form discrete units. In\nmusic these groupings are delimited, or \u201cbounded\u201d by vertical strokes called bar\nlines. Bar lines serve as boundaries, defining a \u201cmeasure\u201d of music.For these\nexamples we will employ a five-line staff. Use of the staff will be explained fully in\nChapter 2 \"The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\".\nThe crossover period between Renaissance and Baroque music at end of the 16th\nCentury and the beginning of the 17th Century witnessed many changes as to how\nmusic was written. The rise of the \u201cSecond Practice,\u201d (Seconda prattica) or \u201cNew\nStyle\u201d (Stile moderno) of composition (early opera) and the concomitant rise of\ninstrumental music necessitated changes in notational practice.\nSince rhythmic durations in Renaissance music were organized in proportion to one\nanother (differing forms ofmensuralnotation), measures and their separating bar\nlines were not in use, nor were time signatures, as we know them. These elements\ncame into gradual use. Scholars offer many explanations for this: practicality and\nease of reading and interpretation, a shift away from multi-voiced music and\ntoward solo or homophonic settings in dramatic music, the desire for segmenting\nmusic into discrete segments, and so forth.\nMeasure and Bar lines\nThis became common notational practice. Ameasure8of music constituted beat\ngroupings (or their durational equivalents) within the context of the stated time\nsignature, bounded by a bar-line. Composers may use a double bar line to denote\nsectional divisions in a piece. A final bar line ends the composition.\n8.A measure of music is a span of\nmusic, bounded by a bar line. It\nis a discrete grouping of pulse\nvalues dictated by the time\nsignature.\n32 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.27 Measure, Bar lines, Double bar line, Final bar line\nWithin measures, specified beats received greater of lesser accentuation, referred to\nsimply as \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d beats. This perception is based upon how the relative\nstrength of beats is perceived in a given time signature.\nFigure 1.28 Sample Time Signatures and Beat Accents\nConducting Patterns\nAs performers, as teachers, and as potential ensemble leaders, all musicians must\nhave a basic understanding of typical conducting patterns. In conducting, the terms\narsisandthesiswill be encountered. In this context, synonyms for these terms are\n\u201cupbeat\u201d (preparatory beat) and \u201cdownbeat\u201d (commencement beat). The common\nconducting patterns are shown inFigure 1.29 \"Two-Pattern\"throughFigure 1.33\n\"Six-Pattern\".\nThe Basic Two-Pattern: for example any simple duple or compound duple time\nsignature. When practicing this, think \u201caway (from the body)-up, away-up\u2026\n1.3 Music Notation Practices 33 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.29 Two-Pattern\nAll conducting figures by Michael Paolantonio\nThe Basic Three-Pattern: any simple triple or compound triple time signature.\nThink \u201cdown-away-up\u2026\u201d\n1.3 Music Notation Practices 34 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.30 Three-Pattern\nAll conducting figures by Michael Paolantonio\nThe Basic Four-Pattern: any simple or compound quadruple time signature.

Specific\nsymbols, calledrepeat signs9orrepeats, came into use whereby a composer could\nindicate the repetition of a measure, a group of measures, or an entire passage.\nFigure 1.34 Repeats, Measure Repeats, Section Repeats\n9.Special symbols indicating that\nsegments of the music\npreviously performed are to be\nrepeated.\n1.3 Music Notation Practices 38 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nA repeated section might end differently than its first iteration: the repeated\nsection might end differently or it might make a transition to a new section.\nComposers employ \u201cFirst and Second Endings\u201d to serve this function.\nFigure 1.35 First and Second Endings\nA passage repeated multiple times is so indicated by listing the number of\nrepetitions in the first ending. In Jazz notation and vernacular music, this may be\naccompanied by an instruction at the beginning of the passage that indicates the\nnumber of iterations, for example,3x\u2019s, meaning \u201crepeat this passage three times.\u201d\nFigure 1.36 Multiple Endings\nAt times in a composition, it is desirable or necessary to repeat an entire earlier\npassage, or return to the beginning of the piece. Rather than re-write the particular\npassage, specific notational expedients evolved to accommodate this. These\nshortcuts employed Italian phrases, accompanied by specific symbols. These phases\nand symbols are directions to the performer as to what segment is repeated and\nhow to conclude the piece.\n1. Da Capo(\u201cfrom the head\u2026\u201d): return to the beginning of the piece.\nAbbreviated asD.C.\n2. Dal Segno(\u201cfrom the sign\u2026\u201d): return to the \u201csign.\u201d Abbreviated asD.S.\nThesegnois a special symbol, shown inFigure 1.37 \"D.C. al Fine, D.S. al\nCoda\".\n3. \u2026al Fine(\u201cto the finish\u201d): Most often used in conjunction withDa Capo,\nthe wordFineappears above the music at the point which tells the\nperformer to end the piece.\n4. \u2026Al Coda(\u201c to the tail\u201d): Most often used in conjunction withDal Segno,\nthis symbol (seeFigure 1.37 \"D.C. al Fine, D.S. al Coda\") instructs the\nperformer to \u201cjump\u201d to a final, separate, concluding section of the\npiece.\n1.3 Music Notation Practices 39 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nFigure 1.37 D.C. al Fine, D.S. al Coda\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe student should be able to define and understand:\n\u2022 Measures and Bar lines.\n\u2022 Basic Conducting Patterns\n\u2022 Repeats\n\u2022 D.C. al Fine, D.S. al Coda\n1.3 Music Notation Practices 40 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nEXERCISES\n1.

Introduction to Asymmetrical Meter\nSlurs, Phrase Markings and Ties\nCurves lines have several uses in music notation. Curves lines may be drawn above\nor below segments of a composition (slursorphrase markings). A curved line may\nalso connect two note values across a bar-line (ties).\n1. Aslur10is a performance indication in music, used to instruct the\nperformer to connect those notes encompassed by the slur. A wind\nplayer will not articulate (\u201ctongue\u201d) these notes, a string player will\nplay them all in one bow stroke, a pianist will strive to connect the\nnotes fluidly.\nFigure 1.41 Slurs\nSlurs should be drawn connecting or encompassing note-heads. A\ncommon mistake by students is to draw slurs connecting stems. The\nexception to this general practice occurs when a slur is drawn over\nnote stems that change direction. (See measure 1 ofFigure 1.41\n\"Slurs\".)\n2. Aphrase marking11is also a performance indication. A composer will\nencase a passage of music within a phrase marking to indicate a\n10.Slurs are curved lines above or\nbelow notes showing complete idea, a complete musical statement.

At times a durational value exceeds the bounds of a measure in a given\ntime signature: the note value occupies more \u201cbeats\u201d than the measure\nwill allow. To accommodate this, we use atie12, a short curved line\nconnecting one durational value to another in the succeeding measure.\nFigure 1.43 Ties\nDynamic Markings and Articulations\nDynamic markings indicate relative degrees of volume in a composition or a\npassage of music. Articulations are common symbols (and their associated terms)\ndirecting how notes are performed. These are listed inChapter 19 \"Appendix A:\nCommon Musical Terms\"with other common musical terms.\nThe basic dynamic markings are:\n1. pianissimo: very \u201csoft\u201d (quiet)\n2. piano: \u201csoft\u201d\n3. mezzo-piano: medium \u201csoft\u201d\n4. mezzo-forte: medium \u201cstrong\u201d or loud\n5. forte: strong or loud\n6. fortissimo: very strong or loud\nSome composers expand this range, adding dynamic markings using three or four\n\u201cp\u2019s\u201d or three or four \u201cf\u2019s.\u201d\nFigure 1.44 Basic Dynamic Markings\n12.A tie is a short slur used to\nconnect notes across a bar line.\n1.4 Additional Information 44 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nComposers employ special markings that serve as performance \u201cindicators,\u201d\ndenoting how notes are to be performed. Those commonly used are listed below.\n1. Staccato: originally interpreted as \u201chalf the written value,\u201d it has come\nto mean \u201cdetached\u201d (not necessarily \u201cshort\u201d).\nFigure 1.45 Staccato Examples\n2. Legato: properlyTenuto(\u201cheld\u201d), meaning held to full value and\nimplying connection to the following note value.\nFigure 1.46 Legato Examples\n3. Marcato: (\u201cmarked\u201d), accented.\nFigure 1.47 Marcato Examples\n4. Marcatisimo: heavily accented.\nFigure 1.48 Marcatissimo Examples\n5. Martel\u00e9: in writing for strings, this marking is used to denote a very\nheavy accent, heavy bow pressure being achieved by the use of\n\u201cdownbow.\u201d\nFigure 1.49 Martel\u00e9 Examples\n1.4 Additional Information 45 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nArtificial Divisions\nReview the fundamental attributes defining simple and compound meter. Simple\nmeter divides the fundamental pulse into two portions, compound meter into three.\nAt times it is desirable (or necessary) to insert a compound division into simple\ntime, or a simple division into compound time. This process is calledartificial\ndivision13, commonly calledtuplets.\nIn a simple meter, inserting a compound division (artificially dividing the beat into\nthree equal portions) is called atripletand is written thus:\nFigure 1.50 Triplets in Simple Meter\nConversely, inserting a simple division into a compound meter (artificially dividing\nthe beat unto two equal portions) is called a duplet, and is written thus:\nFigure 1.51 Duplets in Compound Meter\nA triplet may occur across multiple beats in Simple Meter, called asuper-triplet. In\nCompound Meter, a larger tuplet across multiple beats may occur.\nFigure 1.52 Super-triplet, Tuplet\nComposers have employed many othertupletfigures, inserting larger artificial\ndivisions within beats or groups of beats.\nFigure 1.53 Examples of Larger Tuplets\n13.Inserting a compound division\ninto simple time (triplets) or\nsimple divisions into\ncompound time (duplet).\n1.4 Additional Information 46 Chapter 1 The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\nArtificial division is used as a process for making rigid time and beat division much\nmore fluid and irregular. This technique is especially prevalent in music from the\n19th Century onwards.\nSyncopation\nSyncopation is another common rhythmic device. The simplest definition of\nsyncopation is:\n1. An arrangement of durational values that places accents or \u201cstress\u201d\nwhere it is unexpected.\n2. This translates to \u201caccents on the off-beats\u201d (or weak beats).\u201d\n3. Originating as a rhythmic device in early music, it has become an\nespecially prevalent attribute of music after 1900.\n4. Syncopation does occur in certain contexts throughout the evolution\nof Western music.\nHere are some typical rhythmic patterns demonstrating this device:\nFigure 1.54 Examples of Syncopation Patterns\nAsymmetrical Meter\nAsymmetrical meter has become a very common device in the composer\u2019s arsenal.\nOften called \u201cOdd-meters\u201d (a slang term) because the top number of such time\nsignatures is an \u201codd number,\u201d these are time signatures that mix simple and\ncompound beats within a measure or pulse grouping.

Unlike the Plastic Arts (painting, sculpture), music is\nnot a temporally fixed entity: it exists in its own time, calculated by the progression\nof rhythm and meter across a compositionally predetermined time span.\nAn intimate and close understanding of rhythm and its attributes is the first\nessential skill any musician must acquire. From performance through analysis,\naspects of rhythmic organization permeate the entire range of all skill-sets that\nserves as the basis for becoming a competent, literate, functional musician.\nThe next chapter will discuss the other half of this equation: pitch and its\nattributes. These skill-sets, in tandem with rhythm, will prepare the student for\nexploring first the grammar, then the syntax of the musical language.\n53 Chapter 2\nThe Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nIntroduction\nInChapter 1 \"The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time\"we discovered\nhow music is organized temporally and how that temporal organization is\nsymbolized in written notation. Aspects of rhythm and rhythmic notation, meter,\nand basic formal organization were discussed.\nIn this chapter we shall explore how tone is represented in music. In early music\nsound or tone was not precisely notated. Rather, a system of mnemonic symbols\ncalledneumesgave only an approximate indication of where tones sounded in\nrelationship to one another in terms of relative highness or lowness. Many notation\ntraditions and practices evolved in early Western music: there was no uniform\npractice as to how sound in music was notated.\nFrom this early use as a memory device, notational practice evolved over time\ntoward a standardized system of notation and, more importantly, toward an exact\nsystem of tone placement.\nMusicologists credit Guido d\u2019Arezzo (c. 990\u20131050) for this all-important\ndevelopment. Among his many pedagogical contributions, Guido adapted and\nsynthesized elements of numerous notational practices in order to formulate a\nstandardized notational system. The significance of his contributions and\npedagogical tools forms the basis of how music notation evolved into recognized\nstandard notation.\n54 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Defining and understanding pitch versus pitch class.\n2. Understanding the staff (staves) and the Grand Staff.\n3. Understanding the use of clefs.\n4. Understanding the use of ledger lines.\nPitch1is defined as the relative highness or lowness of sound. This is a general\ndefinition: in music we speak of pitch as a specific tone that is specifically placed\nand notated.Pitch-class2, a relatively recent term, describes a generalized or\ngeneric relationship of pitches that sound essentially identical but are separated by\na sense of highness or lowness. Pitch-class also refers to tones that share the same\n\u201cpitch-space,\u201d that is, they sound identical, but are \u201cspelled\u201d differently.\nThe Staff\nSince early notation was not specific as to exact placement of pitch, a system of\nparallel horizontal lines came into use in order to show exact\nplacement.Interestingly, earlier systems of notation employing parallel lines had\nbeen in use. Many usedonlythe lines themselves to locate pitch, not the spaces\nbetween.Thisstaff3originated as a system of eleven parallel lines that\nencompassed the theoretical span of available pitches, which was the range of the\nmale voice from Bass to male Soprano.In St. Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Corinthians he\ndelivers an injunction to \u201cLet your women keep silence in the Church\u2026\u201d This\nbecame the rationale for the exclusion of women from participation in the early\nchurch.In practice, this complete system was limited to four or five parallel lines\nencompassing the range of a given chant melody or voice part.\n1.Pitch is relative highess or\nlowness of sound. Individual\npitches are specifically located\nand notated on the staff.\n2.Pitch-classes are all those\npitches which share the same\nletter name, or share the same\n\u201cpitch-space\u201d but have\ndifferent spellings.\n3.The Staff (or staves) is a system\nof parallel lines used to locate\nand notate specific pitches.\n55 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.1 The Guidonian Staff\nPitches were assigned specific names. The lowest pitch, calledgamma, extended to\nthe highest pitch,ut: the contraction of these two terms,gamut, has entered the\nlanguage to mean \u201ca complete range or scope.\u201d\nThe eleven-line system is visually cumbersome. In early music specific lines were\ncolored with different dyes, each line locating a specific pitch. All other pitches\nwere held in relation to these. In time, the eleven-line staff was separated into two\nfive-line staves. The remaining line between the two staves was not drawn, but was\nunderstood as being \u201cshared\u201d by each staff.\nSpecific symbols came into use, replacing the colored lines. Clefs (French-\u201ckey\u201d)\nserved the same purpose as colored lines, locating exact pitches around which all\nother pitches were calculated. These clefs represented general voice ranges and\ntheir names reflect this.\nWe label pitch-classes by the use of letter-names. Other labels are discussed in\nSection 2.2 \"Chromatic Alteration: Accidentals\". The Treble Clef (or \u201cG-clef\u201d),\nnominally indicating a high voice, locates the pitch \u201cG\u201d on the second line up on the\nstaff.\nThe Bass Clef (or \u201cF-clef\u201d) locates the pitch \u201cF\u201d on the fourth line up on the staff.\nFrom these two fixed points, all other pitches were calculated and placed on the\nfive-line staff.Figure 2.2 \"Treble Clef and Staff; Bass Clef and Staff\"shows the Treble\nand Bass Clefs and pitch placement on lines and spaces.\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class 56 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nTreble and Bass Clefs, The Grand Staff\nFigure 2.2 Treble Clef and Staff; Bass Clef and Staff\nThese two staves are combined into asystem4calledThe Grand Staff5.In notation\nwe call complete lines of music asystem.This reflects its origins from the Guidonian\nstaff: two five-line staves, slightly separated, the remaining invisible middle line\nshared by both. The Grand Staff now yields the potential for locating and notating\nall pitches, from lowest to highest.\nFigure 2.3 The Grand Staff\nInFigure 2.3 \"The Grand Staff\"pitches are listed just outside the boundaries of each\nclef on the Grand Staff. Since the two staves (Treble and Bass) are separated from\none another in the Grand Staff, it is necessary to use symbols to extend each beyond\n4.A staff or collection of staves\ngrouped together. It may also its five-line boundaries.\nrefer to one complete line of\nmusic.\nLedger Lines\n5.A system of two five-line staves\nused to locate and notate pitch.\nShort horizontal dashes are used to extend the range of either staff, above or below.\nThis evolved from the early\neleven-line staff. These dashes, calledledger lines6, serve as truncated staff lines. They may occur\nabove or below a notehead, or they may bisect a notehead.\n6.Ledger lines are small\nhorizontal dashes above,\nbelow, or through a notehead\nused to extend the range of the\nstaff.\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class 57 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.4 Ledger Lines\nThe student should exercise particular care when drawing ledger lines. A common\nmistake of nascent music students is placing the ledger line on the wrong side of\nthe notehead. When drawing notes observe several other properties:\n1. Stems extend up or down from the notehead to the next pitch-class of\nthe same name.This practice for notating stem length has its early\norigins as a pitch designation, not as a durational value.\n2. Stems are drawn down from noteheads on the middle line of the staff\nand above. Below the middle line, stems are drawn up.\n3. In extended passages across the middle line of the staff, stems may be\nthe same direction. There is no rule for this: it is a matter of visual\nuniformity.\n4. For stems up: the stem is always on the right side of the notehead. For\nstems down: the stem is always on the left side of the notehead.Stem\nplacement has not always been uniform. When studying scores of\nearlier music, one will readily observe that stem placement in relation\nto the notehead seemed to be a matter of choice, style, or convenience\nPitch Placement on the Staff\nUsing these notational devices and practices, exact pitch placement can be shown.\nNote that the pitch that is one ledger line above Bass Clef is identical to the pitch\nthat is one ledger line below Treble Clef (both are \u201cMiddle C\u201d). This shared,\nconnective pitch is reminiscent of the middle line from the Guidonian staff and\nserves to connect the two staves.\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class 58 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.5 Pitch Placement on the Grand Staff\nObserve the Grand Staff. Note that pitches of the same letter name occur\nthroughout the system. Individual tones are specifically recognized as such. Pitches\nhaving the same letter name but separated by range are recognized as pitch-classes.\nTherefore the note one ledger line below the Treble Staff is designated as the pitch\n\u201cC\u201d (or \u201cMiddle C\u201d), but all notes so labeled constitute the pitch-class \u201cC.\u201d\nAlso, observe that ledger lines extending notes below Treble Clef may be written in\nBass Clef. Similarly, ledger lines extending notes above Bass Clef may be written in\nTreble Clef. At times, it is more appropriate to write pitches using ledger lines,\nrather than switching to another staff and clef. Exercise caution when writing or\nlabeling pitches that cross over \u201cbetween\u201d the staves.\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class 59 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Pitch is relative highness or lowness of sound. The term is also used to\ndescribe specific tones. Pitch-class is a generic designation referring to\ntones sounding the same but separated by relative highness or lowness.\n\u2022 The staff is a five-line system used to locate pitches. The Grand Staff is a\nsystem of two five-line staves spanning the complete useable range of\npitches (with the use of ledger lines).\n\u2022 Clefs are specialized symbols denoting specific pitches on a staff. All\nother pitches are located in relation to these.\n\u2022 Ledger lines are horizontal dashes that are used to extend the range of a\ngiven staff, above or below its five-line boundaries.\n2.1 Pitch and Pitch-Class 60 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nEXERCISES\n1.

Defining diatonic pitches and chromatic alteration.\n2. Definingmusica ficta, accidentals, precautionary accidentals.\n3. Understanding enharmonic equivalence.\nThe termdiatonicdenotes pitches that occur naturally in a theoretical system of\nmusic with respect to its components. A simplistic (and incorrect) view describes\ndiatonic pitches as \u201cthe white notes\u201d on the piano. The wordchromaticcomes from\nthe Greek word for \u201ccolor,\u201dkromos. In early music, this term was employed to\ndescribe those pitches lying outside of the theoretical collection of pitches, pitches\nthat were altered for various reasons. The termchromaticism7will recur from time\nto time to describe altered pitches and their effects in music.\nEarly music made use of a fixed number of pitches organized into a system of\noverlapping six-tone sequences (hexachords). As compositional styles evolved and\nnew resources added, composers routinely altered pitches for a variety of reasons.\nSometimes a pitch was considered to sound too \u201chard\u201d and was therefore\n\u201csoftened\u201d (lowered). Sometimes pitches were altered (raised) to provide a more\npronounced resolution to a following pitch. These altered pitches were called\nmusica ficta(\u201ccontrived\u201d or \u201cfeigned\u201d music; \u201cfalse\u201d music). Originally the\nconditional use of these alterations was understood, therefore not notated. In time,\nthe symbols representing an altered pitch were added above the note, almost as an\neditorial marking. Eventually these symbols were incorporated into the music,\npreceding the note they modified.\nAccidentals\nThese symbols became what we callaccidentals8. The need for these alterations\ncame about because of our inherently flawed system of notating pitch: we have\ntwelve pitches in our system yet only seven letter names. Accidentals accommodate\nthese alterations. The \u201csharp\u201d sign (the octothorpe or \u201cpound\u201d sign) raises a pitch,\n7.Chromaticism refers to those\naltered pitches that lie the \u201cflat\u201d sign (lower-case \u201cb\u201d) lowers a pitch. The natural sign cancels any other\n\u201coutside\u201d the range of a accidental. Double flats and double sharps may occur occasionally, their use\nparticular collection.\ndetermined by context.\n8.Accidentals are those\nspecialized symbols used to\nshow chromatic alterations.\n62 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.8 Accidentals\nAccidentals are always placed before the note that they modify, never behind. As a\nnotational convenience, an accidental will stay in effect throughout the measure\nwhere it occurs. Any repetitions of that modified note within the measure remain\nmodified. The note reverts to its diatonic form in subsequent measures.In much\nmusic of the modern era, accidentals only modify those notes that they\nimmediately precede. If this is the case, it is so indicated in performance notes.\nOften however, as a reminder, composers will place a precautionary accidental\nbefore the note that was previously chromatically altered.\nEnharmonic Equivalence\nAll pitches, but chromatic pitches especially, may be \u201cspelled\u201d in different ways.\nThese differing spellings are context-dependent (or a matter of convenience) as will\nbe discussed below. Notes that share the same pitch space but employ different\nspellings are said to beenharmonically equivalent.Enharmonic equivalence9is an\nattribute that will come to have greater significance as our argument progresses.\nFigure 2.9 Enharmonic Equivalents\n9.Enharmonic equivalence\ndescribes pitches that share\nthe same pitch-space (sound\nidentical) but are \u201cspelled\u201d\ndifferently.\n2.2 Chromatic Alteration: Accidentals 63 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Diatonic versus chromatic pitches.\n\u2022 Musica ficta, accidentals, precautionary accidentals.\n\u2022 Enharmonic equivalence.\n2.2 Chromatic Alteration: Accidentals 64 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nEXERCISES\n1.

Familiarization with the layout of the keyboard.\n2. Recognition of note placement on the keyboard.\n3. Understanding the use of the keyboard as a visual tool.\nThe keyboard serves as a visual reference for locating and identifying pitches.\nObserveFigure 2.12 \"Small Keyboard Diagram\"below. Notice the layout of the\nkeyboard: there are two black keys grouped together, then three black keys\ngrouped together. These visual reference points will help the familiarization\nprocess. Also observe the labels for the keys on the keyboard.\nFigure 2.12 Small Keyboard Diagram\n\u00a9 Thinkstock\n67 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nAll musicians, regardless of discipline or instrument, should familiarize themselves\nwith the keyboard. We are all visual learners to a greater or lesser extent. The\nvisual layout of the keyboard will foster an understanding of pitch placement,\nregister designation, scale construction, interval distance, chord construction-\nvirtually every acquired skill in the study of music. The keyboard is a powerful and\nvaluable tool.\nInFigure 2.12 \"Small Keyboard Diagram\"observe that some white note pairs have\nan intervening black note and two pairs do not. Let us focus upon those two.\nAdjacent pitches are calledsemi-tones(or \u201dhalf steps\u201d). The pitches E-F and B-C (the\ntwo white key pairs) are calleddiatonic half steps. Half steps that are measured from\na white key to a black, or vice-versa, are calledchromatic half steps.\nThe distance of asemi-toneor half step is the same for any two adjacent pitches\nacross the keyboard.Figure 2.13 \"Keyboard and Half Steps\"shows this relationship\nin pitches.\nFigure 2.13 Keyboard and Half Steps\n\u00a9 Thinkstock\n2.3 The Keyboard as a Visual Tool 68 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nNotes that are separated by an intervening note are calledtones, or whole steps.\nWhole steps are formed by spanning the distance of two half steps.Figure 2.14\n\"Keyboard and Whole Steps\"shows representative whole steps.\nFigure 2.14 Keyboard and Whole Steps\n\u00a9 Thinkstock\nFigure 2.15 \"Piano Keyboard\"shows the entire piano keyboard.

Understanding the use of register designations and labeling specific\npitches.\n2. Understanding the term octave and its use.\n3. Understanding8vaand8vbas notation conventions.\nBy using the Grand Staff, we can locate specific pitches from low to high. However it\nis necessary to assign more precise values to pitches according to their specific\nrange in this spectrum. For this task we employregister designations10.\nThe Octave\nTo do this, we first separate the entire span of pitches into discrete segments\nlabeledoctaves(Italian:ottava\u201ceight\u201d). In this context, an octave is a segment of\npitches spanning the distance from one pitch to its pitch-class counterpart above or\nbelow. Further, it is customary to speak of pitches as residing in some particular\n\u201coctave.\u201d\nFigure 2.17 Octave\nUsing theoctave11as a range-specific designator, pitches can be precisely located\nand identified by letter name as well as by register. Originally, a register\ndesignation system evolved that employed upper- and lower-case letter names.\nMultiple lower case letters (C, CC, CCC) denoted lower octaves while upper-case\nletter names followed by one or more apostrophes denoted higher octaves. While\nthis system may still be encountered occasionally, it is gradually being abandoned\nin favor of a more malleable system.\n10.The labeling system used to\nRegister Designation\nlocate pitch based upon the\npiano keyboard.\nIn the 1970\u2019s, the Acoustical Society of America instituted a register designation\n11.In this context, an eight-tone\nspecies, or sequence of pitches. system based upon the layout of the piano keyboard. This system uses letter names\n72 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nto denote pitch. Each letter name is followed by a number denoting the octave\nwithin which that pitch resides. Each octave begins with the note \u201cC\u201d and extends\nto the \u201cB\u201d seven steps above.\nThere are three pitches below the lowest C (C1) on the average piano keyboard.\nThese notes are labeled in two ways: A0, Bb0, B0, or simply A, Bb, B. So, the entire\npiano keyboard spans the range from A0 to C8.Figure 2.18 \"Keyboard with Octave\nDesignations\"shows this entire keyboard with each octave designation labeled.\nFigure 2.18 Keyboard with Octave Designations\n\u00a9 Wikicommons, Artur Jan Fijalkowski\nThe use of register designations is coupled with, and reinforced by, the visual tool\nof the piano keyboard. This becomes an indispensable skill for every musician.\nOften the range of a particular segment of music will be written in extremes of\nregister, high or low. This is notated using multiple ledger lines. Often, as a\nnotational convenience and to make for ease of reading, composers may employ\nsymbols denoting that a passage is played an octave higher than written (8va-\nottava), or an octave lower than written (8vb-ottava bassa). In order to avoid using\nledger lines, the passage is written in a lower octave, then labeled above the staff if\n8va, below the staff if8vb. A bracket extends from theottavasymbol to the end of\nthe passage that is raised or lowered.\n2.4 Register Designation, The Octave, 8va, and 8vb 73 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.19 8va, 8vb\nAt times composers will use the symbols15maand15mbto denote that the passage\nis to be played two octaves higher or lower. While uncommon, this is occasionally\nused, especially as a notational convenience. A composer may indicate that a\npassage is to be performed two octaves higher or lower by including this as an\ninstruction.\nFigure 2.20 15ma\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Understanding and employing register designations for locating pitch.\n\u2022 Use of the piano keyboard to support recognizing registral designations.\n\u2022 8vaand8vb,15maand15mb\n2.4 Register Designation, The Octave, 8va, and 8vb 74 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nEXERCISES\n1.

Understanding how pitches may be labeled.\n2. Understandingsolf\u00e9gesyllables as pitch labels and aural reference.\n3. Understand scale degree number notation.\nIn our system we label pitches using letter names. In other countries pitches are\nlabeled usingsolf\u00e9ge12syllables. This tradition originated as a pedagogical device\ninvented by Guido. The syllables, originallyUt,Re,Mi,Fa,Sol,La, come from the\ninitial syllable of each line ofUt queant laxis, an Ambrosian hymn to St. John the\nBaptist. Each line of music starts on a successively higher pitch. Guido employed\nthis as a pedagogical tool for training singers.\nFigure 2.23 Ut queant laxis\n12.Syllables adapted to denote\npitches. Originally used as a\n\u00a9 David J. Gonzol. Used by permission.\npedagogical mnemonic.\n77 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nSinceUtis the only syllable in the collection ending on a hard consonance, it was\neventually replaced by the syllableDo(fromDomine-Latin-\u201cLord\u201d) to facilitate\nsinging. In the 15th-century a seventh tone and syllable was added,Si, an acronym\nforSancte Ioannes, the last two words fromUt queant laxis,.

Understanding Moveable C-Clef.\n2. Understanding Alto Clef and Tenor Clef.\n3. Other Clefs.\nIn discussing the evolution and formation of the staff, we saw that the eleven-line\nGuidonian staff separated into two five-line staves. The remaining line was not\ndiscarded as such, but rather served as a connective or \u201cshared\u201d line between the\ntwo staves.\nThis invisible middle line locates the pitch C4 (\u201cMiddle C\u201d). On the grand staff this\nappears as a note one ledger line below the staff in Treble Clef, or a note one ledger\nline above the staff in Bass Clef.\nFigure 2.26 C4 (\u201cMiddle C\u201d) on the Grand Staff\nMoveable C-Clef\nFrom the Guidonian staff a separate clef evolved denoting this particular pitch. This\n13.A clef derived from the eleven-\nclef is called \u2018C-Clef,\u201d or properly, \u201cMoveable C-clef13.\u201d\nline staff. This clef locates C4\nregardless of what line of the\nstaff it is placed upon.\n80 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.27 C4 C-Clef\nThis clef may occur on any line in the staff. Regardless of which line it occurs on, it\nalways locates C4, \u201cMiddle C.\u201d Originally, the use of this clef was concerned with\nparticular voice ranges. The moveable C-Clef kept the majority of pitches of a given\nvoice within the boundaries of the staff conforming to the typical range of that\nvoice. Hence the common names for this clef as it occurs on each line reflect the\nassociated voice part.\nFigure 2.28 C-Clefs by Voice\nAlto and Tenor Clefs\nThe C-Clef on the lowest line of the staff is called Soprano Clef, the second line\nMezzo-Soprano Clef, the third lineAlto Clef14, the fourth lineTenor Clef15and the\ntop line Baritone Clef. Until the 19th Century (approximately) choral music was\nwritten in open score, each voice part on a separate staff with the appropriate clef.\nGradually this became an arcane procedure.\n14.The C-clef placed on the second\nline of the staff. Used primarily\nfor Viola.\nTwo of the Moveable C-Clefs have been retained in common use in instrumental\n15.The C-clef placed on the fourth writing, primarily because of the ranges of certain instruments. Alto Clef is\nline of the staff. Used for \u2018Cello, predominantly used in writing for the Viola. If Treble or Bass Clefs were used, the\nBassoon, and Trombone.\n2.6 Moveable C-Clef; Other Clefs 81 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nViola part would need to be written with a surfeit of ledger lines-it\u2019s general range\noccupies the space \u201cbetween\u201d and \u201coverlapping\u201d Treble and Bass Clefs. The \u2018Cello\noften employs Tenor Clef (in addition to Bass Clef). In orchestral and more\nadvanced wind ensemble literature (but curiously, not in Jazz), Tenor Clef may be\nused for the upper register of the Trombone. Again, the purpose is to keep the\nmajority of the pitches within the boundaries of the staff.\nOther Clefs\nThe remaining C-Clefs are not normally encountered except in autograph scores\nand facsimile editions of earlier music. There are several other clefs, one of which\nhas become very common, the others rarely seen. In Choral writing, Tenor Clef is\ncommonly replaced by a Treble Clef with an \u201c8\u201d (ottava) sign appended to the\nbottom of the clef.\nAs open score became less common, and as fewer musicians were trained to read\nTenor Clef efficiently, this \u201ccompromise\u201d clef came into general use. It reads exactly\nas Treble Clef but \u201csounds\u201d down an octave, conforming to the range of the Tenor\nvoice.\nFigure 2.29 Octave Tenor Clef\nTwo clefs are no longer in use, French Violin Clef (locating G4) on the lowest line of\nthe staff, and a Bass Clef (F-Clef) located on the middle line of the staff. This is called\nFrench Baritone Clef.\nFigure 2.30 French Violin and French Baritone Clefs\nThe Neutral Clef is used for non-pitched percussion instruments.\n2.6 Moveable C-Clef; Other Clefs 82 Chapter 2 The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone\nFigure 2.31 The Neutral Clef\nSince Alto and Tenor Clefs have been retained in common usage, it is necessary to\nlearn to read these with some facility. When first encountered, this can be a\ndaunting task. Some say that familiarization and memorization is the only method\nfor learning these clefs. There are expedient shortcuts however, that may help to\nfacilitate the process:\n1. For Alto Clef:\na. Think of the note name in Treble Clef and \u201cread\u201d this one line or\nspacehigher.\nb.

More commonly labeledwhole steps1andhalf steps2, these foundation\nscale-steps serve as the building materials from which we construct sequential\norderings of pitches calledscales3.\nThe construction of various scales shall also be examined, especially the Major Scale\nand the Minor Scale. Additionally, other important scale patterns will be shown.\n1.Adjacent scale steps that have\nan intervening half step.\n2.Adjacent tones, the smallest\ndistance between tones in the\ncurrent system of tuning.\n3.A sequential collection of five\nor more pitches.\n87 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\n3.1 Scales and Scale-Steps\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Define scales and foundation scale-steps.\n2. Define scale types.\n3. The Chromatic Scale.\nIn examining the notation of pitch, we observe that notes climbed or \u201cscaled\u201d the\nlines and spaces of staves from low to high. Ordered sequential collections of these\npitches are called scales (Italian:scala-\u201cladder\u201d).\nScales\nScales are comprised of five or more pitches arranged in sequential patterns of\nwhole steps and half steps spanning anoctave species. We label scales as to the\nnumber of differing elements they contain:\n1. Pentatonic: a five-tone scale.A true pentatonic scale divides the octave\ninto five-equal steps. This is true in the music of many cultures.\nBecause of the adopted tuning system employed by Western Music\n(called equal temperament), we must employ elements larger than\nwhole- and half- steps when constructing pentatonic scales. Play only\nthe black keys on the piano and you will readily see and hear this\nfamiliar sound.\n2. Hexatonic: a six-tone scale.\n3. Heptatonic: a seven-tone scale.\n4. Octatonic: an eight-tone scale, and so forth.\nFour-note sequences are calledtetrachords(Greek: \u201cfour tones\u201d). In this context,\nthey are regarded as constituent components of larger scale patterns.\nSince scales are orderings of whole steps and half steps, these serve as the\nfoundation \u201cbuilding-blocks\u201d for scale construction. As we learn to construct and\nidentify scales, we do so by recognizing their content in terms oftones(whole steps)\nandsemi-tones(half steps).Althoughtoneandsemi-toneare proper names, whole step\nand half step are commonly used terms. In some instances you may encounter the\ntermswhole toneandhalf tonealso.For now, avoid calling whole steps and half steps\n88 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nby any other name, for example, \u201cmajor-seconds\u201d or \u201cminor\u2013seconds.\u201d Proper\ninterval identification for whole steps and half steps shall be addressed in Chapter 5\n\"Intervals\".\nThroughout the history of music, various systems of referential tuning have\nevolved, been adopted, been modified, and been discarded in favor of other\nsystems. It is not within the purview of this discussion to examine these various and\nsundry systems of tuning.An exceptionally clear and concise discussion of the\nhistory and theory of tuning systems may be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of\nChromaticism: Theory and Practice, Howard Boatwright, Walnut Grove Press, 1994.\nFor our purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the standardized tuning system\nknown asequal temperament4. Music in the transitional period between the\nRenaissance and Baroque employed different tuning systems that limited\ncompositional resources. A \u201ccompromise\u201d tuning system was proposed and\ngradually adopted, whereby pitches were slightly altered enabling the division of\nthe octave into twelve equal portions orsemi-tones(half steps). This \u201cevenly-tuned,\u201d\nor \u201cequal-tempered\u201d system allowed composers to employ the full resources of the\nchromatic collection.This will come into focus inChapter 4 \"Key Sense, Key\nSignatures, and The Cycle of Fifths\"andChapter 5 \"Intervals\".\nTherefore, the source collection for Western music is theChromatic Scale5.The\nChromatic Scale, so called because it contains all the pitch \u201ccolors,\u201d is also known as\ntheDuodecuple scale(Latin:duo-deca, \u201ctwo and ten\u201d). It is also labeled theNon-\nSelective Scale, so-called because, all pitches being of equal quality, no one pitch\nasserts itself over the others.\nThe Chromatic Scale\nFigure 3.1 The Chromatic Scale\n4.The current system of tuning\nwhereby pitches have been\nadjusted to allow division of\nthe octave into twelve equal\nportions.\nAudio 1\n5.The source set or collection for\npitch materials as defined\nThe Chromatic Scale\nwithin equal temperament.\n3.1 Scales and Scale-Steps 89 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\n(click to see video)\nThe Chromatic Scale is comprised entirely of half steps. When constructing this, it is\ncustomary to use sharps when ascending and to use enharmonically equivalent flats\nwhen descending.\nMusic of the mid-17th Century through end of the 19th Century saw the\nformulation of a more or less unified system of composition and its supportive\ntheory. Alingua francaof music was established, essentially a common language\nshared by all musicians. Music of the period (roughly!) from Corelli through Brahms\nis called theCommon Practice Period6, or the Common Practice style.\nOne of the fundamental attributes of this Common Practice style was the use of two\nscale types. These two types,MajorandMinorwere \u201cdistilled\u201d from the multiple\nscale types employed in early music. Major and Minor scales became the\npredominant resource for Common Practice music. These scale types shall become\nessential tools for many of the acquired tasks and skill-sets in the study of music.\nUnderstanding and recognizing these constructs is a fundamental and necessary\nattribute of the music student.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe student should understand:\n\u2022 The definition of scales and scale types.\n\u2022 The Foundation (\u201cbuilding-block\u201d) scale steps,tonesandsemi-tones\n(whole steps and half steps).\n\u2022 The Chromatic Scale.\n\u2022 The definition of the Common Practice Period.\nEXERCISES\n1.

The Major scale and its attributes.\n2. The Minor scale and its attributes.\n3. Relative and Parallel Major/Minor.\n4. Scale degree nomenclature.\n5. The evolution of Minor scales: the three forms of the Minor scale\nAny initial discussion of scales inevitably centers around these two seven-tone\nscales employed in the composition of Common Practice music.\nThe Major Scale\nThe most common scale pattern used is theMajor Scale7. It is an arrangement of\nwhole and half steps as follows:\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nW W H W W W H\nNote that half steps occur between scale degrees 3\u20134 and 7\u20138. This is shown in\npitches and the keyboard inFigure 3.2 \"Major Scale, Keyboard and Pitches\".\nFigure 3.2 Major Scale, Keyboard and Pitches\n7.A heptatonic (\u201cseven-tone\u201d)\nscale consisting of the\nfollowing arrangement: W-W-\nH-W-W-W-H.\n91 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nAudio 2\nThe Major Scale\n(click to see video)\nThis arrangement of whole steps and half steps is maintained for any major scale on\nany given starting pitch. Accidentals are used to modify pitches in order to retain\nthis same arrangement of whole and half steps. Compare the samples below to the\nkeyboard diagram. Observe the placement of whole and half steps on the keyboard\nthat maintain the proper ordering.\nFigure 3.3 Other Examples of Major Scales\nAudio 3\nOther Major Scales\n(click to see video)\nObserve that in each new octave species, some chromatic alteration is required in\norder to retain the same arrangement of scale steps.\nAn alternate view of major scale construction is an examination of its constituent\ntetrachords (from the Greek: \u201cfour tones\u201d). Observe that the arrangement of whole\nand half steps in the first tetrachord are identical to that of the second tetrachord.\nBoth tetrachords are W-W-H separated by a whole step.\nSo, two mnemonics are suitable for remembering Major scale construction:\n1. W-W-H-W-W-W-H\n2. Identical tetrachords (W-W-H) separated by a whole step.\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 92 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nThe keyboard diagram is another essential tool for familiarization and recognition\nof major scales. The visual reinforcement of whole step and half step placement will\nhasten the learning process.\nThe individual scale steps have specific labels. These terms have come into general\nuse, having their origins in early 18th-century theoryFrench composer and theorist\nJean Phillipe Rameau employs versions of these terms in his seminal work Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019harmonie(1728). Our current usage of these terms is adapted from this work.\nFigure 3.4 \"Scale-step Labels\"shows the major scale and its accompanying scale\nstep labels.\nScale-Step Labels\nFigure 3.4 Scale-step Labels\n1. The first degree of any scale is called theTonicpitch. This is the pitch\nthat asserts itself over all the others in the collection, the pitch that\nour ear naturally seeks as being the strongest.These terms will be\naffiliated with chords in keys as well.\n2. The next strongest pitch is the fifth scale degree, theDominant. It is\nconsidered to be the \u201cpolar opposite\u201d ofTonic: whereasTonic\nrepresents stability and sense of conclusion,Dominantrepresents\ninstability and a sense of tension.\n3. The third scale degree lies halfway between these and so is labeled the\nMediant.\n4. Dominantis five scale-steps up fromTonic. Five steps belowTonicis the\nfourth scale degree, labeledSubdominant.\n5. Since theMediantlies three steps up fromTonic, three steps down is\nlabeledSubmediant(the sixth scale degree).\n6. The second scale degree is labeledSupertonic.\n7. Lastly, the most powerful melodic motion we respond to is the\nascending half step, from scale degree seven to the octave. Our ear is\ncompelled to resolve thisLeading Tone.\nFigure 3.5 Scale-steps in Order of Importance\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 93 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nThe Minor Scale\nThe other heptatonic scale used in Common Practice music is called theMinor\nScale8. It is arranged as follows:\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nW H W W H W W\nFigure 3.6 The Minor Scale\nAudio 4\nThe Minor Scale\n(click to see video)\nFor this example, the pitches are identical to the Major scale example above, re-\narranged from scale degree six.Figure 3.7 \"Minor Scales on a; on c; Major Scale on\nC\"shows the same Minor scale pattern, but constructed from the same starting\npitch. Both are then compared to the Major scale.\nFigure 3.7 Minor Scales on a; on c; Major Scale on C\nAs with major scales, minor scales use accidentals to retain the same \u201cshape\u201d when\nstarting on differing pitches.\n8.A heptatonic scale having three\ndistinct forms, Natural,\nHarmonic, and Melodic Minor.\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 94 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nFigure 3.8 Other Examples of Minor Scales\nAudio 5\nOther Minor Scales\n(click to see video)\nThe previous examples demonstrate particular relationships between Major and\nMinor scales:\n1. Major and Minor scales that have the same pitch content but different\nstarting pitches are said to berelativeto one another, for example C\nmajor and a minor.\n2. Major and Minor scales that have differing pitch content but the same\nstarting pitch are said to beparallelto one another, for example C\nmajor and c minor.\nIn order to discover theRelative Major/Minor9relationship, follow this procedure:\n1. To find theRelative Minorscale of any Major scale:\na. Go to the sixth degree (Submediant) of the Major scale.\nb. Re-order the scale content from that pitch.\nc.

This leads to confusion on the part of the student. Inevitably, the student\nMajor and Minor scales will go down the wrong specific pitch distance, or will confuse which relationship is\nwherein they share the same\nwhich direction.\npitch content but have a\ndifferent order.\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 95 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nIn order to discover theParallel Major/Minor10relationship, simply construct\nmajor or minor from the same starting pitch.\nRelative and Parallel Major/Minor\nRelativeandParallel Major/Minorwill extend to our discussion of keys inChapter 4\n\"Key Sense, Key Signatures, and The Cycle of Fifths\".When labeling scales it is\ncustomary to use upper case letter names for major and lower case letter names for\nminor. When hand-drawn, a dash is placed above the letter c only. This should not\nbe used for other lower case letters.These relations commute from each form to the\nother: one speaks of Major and itsrelativeMinor, or Minor and itsrelativeMajor. The\nsame is true for theparallelrelationship.\nFigure 3.9 Relative and Parallel Scales: Major to Minor and Minor to Major\nAudio 6\nRelative and Parallel Scales\n(click to see video)\nJust as the Major scale has labels for its constituent scale-steps, these labels are also\nused for Minor scales. There is one notable exception: since the distance between\nscale degree seven and the octave is a whole step, it does not possess the same\nsensation of required resolution as its major counterpart (theLeading Tone).\nTherefore it is labeledSubtonic.\nScale-Step Labels for Minor\nFigure 3.10 Minor Scale-Step Labels\n10.The relationship between\nMajor and Minor scales\nwherein they share the same\nstarting pitch but different\npitch content.\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 96 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nEarlier, theLeading Tonewas described as the most powerful melodic step that we\nrespond to in terms of demanding resolution. This half step between scale degrees\nseven and eight is not present in the naturally occurring Minor scale. Beginning\nwith its antecedents in early music, the minor sonority was routinely altered to\naddress this perceived flaw.\nHarmonic Minor\nComposers chromatically raised the seventh scale degree in minor as a matter of\nroutine in order to provide a more powerful melodic resolution. Additionally, this\nalteration affected the accompanying harmonies, engendering a more powerful\nharmonic resolution as well.\nThis led to an additional, altered form of the minor scale. The original diatonic form\nof the minor scale is calledNatural (or Pure) Minor11. Because of its implied\nharmonic consequence, the altered version (raised 7, or +7) is called the Harmonic\nForm of the Minor scale, or simplyHarmonic Minor12.\nFigure 3.11 Natural and Harmonic Minor\nAudio 7\nNatural and Harmonic Minor Scales\n(click to see video)\nThe component scale steps for Harmonic minor are:\n11.The naturally occurring\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\ndiatonic \u201cparent\u201d version of\nthe Minor scale.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n12.The most commonly used and\nW H W W H (1+1/2) H\nexpected form of the Minor\nscale.

The seventh scale degree is raised in this form of minor. Depending\nupon the starting pitch and the scale, this may use an accidental in the\nform of either a sharp sign or a natural sign.\n2. There are three instances of half steps in this form: 2\u20133, 5\u20136, and now\n+7\u20138.\n3. Because of the alteration the distance between 6 and 7 has been\nexpanded to form a \u201cstep and a half.\u201d This was considered to be a\nmelodic \u201cflaw.\u201d While inherent and necessary to the form, it was\nconsidered to be \u201cun-singable\u201d and in need of correction in\nperformance practice.\nFigure 3.12 Other Examples of Harmonic Minor Scales\nAudio 8\nOther Harmonic Minor Scales\n(click to see video)\nMelodic Minor\nThis perceivedmelodicflaw in Harmonic minor, the \u201cstep and a half\u201d between scale\ndegrees 6 and 7, was subject to routine alteration as well. In order to eliminate this\nawkward gap, composers routinely raised the sixth scale degreeas well as the\nseventh. Since this was done to correct the perceived melodic flaw, a third form of\nthe minor scale came to be recognized, called the Melodic Form of the Minor scale,\nor simplyMelodic Minor13.\nFigure 3.13 Natural, Harmonic, and Melodic Minor Scales\n13.The second altered version of\nthe Minor scale. It is altered by\nraising both the sixth and\nseventh scale degrees.\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 98 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nAudio 9\nNatural, Harmonic, and Melodic Minor Scales\n(click to see video)\nThe component scale steps for Melodic minor are:\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nW H W W W W H\nObserve several properties:\n1. Both the sixth and seventh scale degrees have been raised. Depending\nupon the starting pitch and the scale, this uses accidentals in the form\nof sharp signs, natural signs, or a combination of the two.\n2. The second tetrachord of this scale is identical to the second\ntetrachord of the Major scale.\n3. It is customary torevertto the Natural minor form when descending.\nThismustbe shown using the appropriate accidentals. In some melodic\nminor scales double sharp signs must be used to alter sixth and\nseventh scale degrees. When reverting back to Natural minor, a\nNatural signfollowedby a sharp sign is used,not merely a sharp alone.\nFigure 3.14 Other Examples of Melodic Minor Scales\nAudio 10\nOther Melodic Minor Scales\n3.2 Heptatonic Scales: The Major Scale, The Three Forms of the Minor Scale 99 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\n(click to see video)\nBefore continuing several very important points must be made:\n1. Minor is considered to be only one entity. It is not appropriate to speak\nof \u201cthree separate minor scales,\u201d as if they are inherently different\nspecies.\n2. Although one entity, minor has three distinctforms, Natural,\nHarmonic, and Melodic. These forms evolved to accommodate musical\nand compositional needs over the evolutionary history of Western\nmusic.\n3. The three forms have distinct properties:\na. Natural (or Pure) Minor has noLeading Tone. This was considered to\nbe an inherent weakness or flaw.\nb. Harmonic Minor seeks to correct this weakness by raising the\nseventh scale degree, artificially creating aLeading Tone. This in\nturn generates amelodicflaw in the gap between scale degrees 6\nand 7.\nc. This melodic flaw was corrected by raising the sixth scale degree\n(in the presence of the raised seventh scale degree). Since this\nyields a second tetrachord equivalent to its Major scale\ncounterpart, this process is undone in its descending form by\nreverting to Natural Minor.\n4. Lastly, Harmonic minor is the expected, normal form of Minor used by\ncomposers in practical composition.\nComposers seemed to require the motion from theLeading Toneto theTonic.

Defining Modes as heptatonic scales and in historical context.\n2. Identifying Modes.\n3. Constructing Modes.\nBrief Survey\nPre-Tonal (pre-Common Practice) music is generally considered to be music prior to\n1587 or16001600 is a convenient benchmark. 1587 is sometimes used as a more\nspecific date. This coincides with the establishment of theFlorentine Camerata, (or\nCamerata di Bardiafter its patron), a colloquium of Northern Italian Humanists,\nPoets, Musicians, and aesthetes. In attempting to \u201crediscover\u201d and recreate ancient\nGreek dramatic forms, they developed a new style of music, the \u201cSecond Practice,\u201d\nor \u201cNew Style.\u201d This was the origin of Opera.. This period is often referred to as the\nModal Era(as opposed to theTonal Erathat is the Common Practice period).\nThe source materials for Tonal practice consist of the Major/Minorduality. Music of\nthis period essentially relied upon Major and Minor scales and their extrapolated\nconstructs as the formative resources for composition.\nIn the Modal Era, the source materials were a collection of scalar constructs called\nModes18. Originating as tetrachords in early Greek theory, in early Western music\nthey consisted of a collection of interlocking hexachords, each with specific\nattributes. In time, as compositional resources evolved, supported by accompanying\ntheoretical principles, Modes became a series of heptatonic scales, each with very\nspecific attributes.\nAlthough these were the theoretical basis for early music, modes languished during\nthe Tonal Era. Composers in the 20th-Century, looking for alternative resources to\nMajor and Minor scales, \u201cre-discovered\u201d modes. Modal \u201cflavors\u201d are found in\nabundance throughout examples of music since 1900.\nModes have become an integral resource in the Jazz style as well. Since the mid-to-\n18.Heptatonic scales used in early late 1950\u2019s, modes are considered to be the initial, or primary source scales for Jazz\nmusic. Also used in post-Tonal improvisation, especially in the pedagogical practice called chord/scale\nmusic.\n106 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nequivalency.Most Jazz scholars identify the seminal recordings of Miles Davis in the\nlate 1950\u2019s as heralding the advent of modal use in Jazz. There is evidence that\ntrumpet player Don Cherry may have used modal resources earlier in the decade.\nThe Ecclesiastical Modes (or \u201cChurch\u201d Modes) were seven-tone scales built upon D,\nE, F, and G. Each was ordered as an octave species from the modalfinal19(modal\n\u201ctonic\u201d). Each also had a re-ordered version wherein the top tetrachord of each was\nplaced below the modalfinal(Latin:finalis). The original ordering was called the\nAuthentic20form of the mode, the transposed version was called thePlagal21form.\nThese alternatePlagalorderings were not new modes: each pair,Authenticand\nPlagal, had the samefinal. A particular form was so labeled based upon the range of\nthe modal melody as well as upon the perceived modal dominant within each form.\nEcclesiastical (\u201cChurch\u201d) Modes\nOriginally, modes had specific names. These names reflect regional or place names\nfrom the Hellenistic world but were really stylistic indicators. In early church music\nmodes were numbered sequentially. Eventually, the early names were re-used\nreflecting their early origins. We label modes using these names.\nFigure 3.16 Ecclesiatical Modes\nAudio 11\n19.The modal equivalent ofTonic\nor keynote.\nThe \u201cChurch\u201d Modes\n20.The original ordering of a\nmode as an octave species from\nthefinal. (click to see video)\n21.A re-ordering of the mode\nIn and of themselves, the theoretical modes were considered to have certain flaws\nwherein the top tetrachord is\nplaced below thefinal. in regard to their use in practical composition. These perceived flaws were treated\n3.4 Heptatonic Scales: Introduction to Modes 107 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nby the use ofmusia ficta: composers routinely altered pitches to achieve the desired\nresult. For example, the \u201csoftening\u201d of the fourth scale degree in Lydian, or adding\naLeading Toneto Dorian and Mixolydian.Because of its unique character, Phrygian\nwas resistant to any alteration.\nFigure 3.17 Modes andmusic ficta\nGreater Modal System\nIn practical composition, the altered version of the mode became the version used.\nThe resulting mixtures of mode and alteration in time yielded new scales,\nrecognized as such by established practice. This was codified in the Greater Modal\nSystem.\nFigure 3.18 The Greater Modal System (Abbreviated)\nAudio 12\nThe Modes\n(click to see video)\nNote that Ionian is the Major scale and Aeolian is the Natural Minor scale. The other\nearlier modes (again by established practice) gradually polarized toward one or the\nother of these two forms. Due to the perceived flaws of each mode, they eroded\nunder the weight of their own inefficiency and distilled into either the \u201cMajor\u201d\nmode, or the \u201cMinor\u201d mode. The Locrian mode, while recognized as a theoretical\nmode was not used in practical composition due to its unstable final\nresolution.Locrian was not included in the system of modes until 1482 where it was\n3.4 Heptatonic Scales: Introduction to Modes 108 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\ndescribed in the treatisede Musicaof the Spanish composer and theoretician\nBartolom\u00e9 Ramos de Pareja.\nAssociative Method\nThis sense of polarization toward either Major or Minor becomes one useful\ntechnique for learning modes and familiarization with their characteristics. The\nAssociative Method22classifies modes as having the same basic characteristics as\neither Major or Minor and then recognizes the variances.\nMajor Sounding Modes Minor Sounding Modes\nIonian: Major Aeolian: Natural Minor\nLydian: Major, raised 4 Dorian: Minor, raised 6\nMixolydian: Major, lowered 7 Phrygian: Minor, lowered 2\nLocrian: Minor, lowered 2 & 5\n(or Locrian: Phrygian, lowered 5)\nFigure 3.19 The Associative Method for Modes\nAudio 13\nAssociative Modes\n(click to see video)\n22.Recognition of modes by\nassociation with either the\nMajor or the Minor scale and\nThis method is extremely useful in many instances, especially for recognition\nobserving the variances from\npurposes and as a tool for learning to hear and sing modes.Some advocate a similar\nthese.\n3.4 Heptatonic Scales: Introduction to Modes 109 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nsystem wherein the student is compelled to memorize modes as variances from the\nmajor scale. We reject this as being unwieldy and narrow. As such, it cannot be\nrecommended.Modes are labeled by the letter name they begin upon followed by\nthe mode name.\nFigure 3.20 Sample Modes and Labels\nAudio 14\nOther Modes\n(click to see video)\nRevolving Scale Method\nA second method is more complete and serves well for the identification of modes,\nas well as the construction and transposition of modes to other pitches. Observe\nFigure 3.21 \"The Revolving Scale Method for Modes\". This diagram of the\nabbreviated Greater Modal System is projected as arevolving major scale. In other\nwords, it appears to be a C major scale constructed upon successively higher scale\ndegrees. In thisRevolving Scale Method23, each successive reordering of the scale\ncorresponds to one of the modes.\nFigure 3.21 The Revolving Scale Method for Modes\n23.Recognition of modes by their\nconsistent order in the context\nof the Revolving Major Scale.\n3.4 Heptatonic Scales: Introduction to Modes 110 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nThis modal ordering remains constant regardless of the major scale used.\nTherefore, it can be used as an \u201calgorithm,\u201d a known value for comparative\nproblem solving, and used as a tool for identifying, constructing, and transposing\nmodes.

Introduction to other commonly used scales.\n2. Pentatonic, Whole Tone, \u201cAugmented,\u201d Octatonic, Lydian-Mixolydian\nand \u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone.\nThefin de si\u00e9cleperiod, the crossover period between the 19th- and 20th Centuries,\nwitnessed monumental changes as to how music was composed. By this point in the\nevolution of Western music, Tonal music had not exhausted itself, but had\ndeveloped as fully as it could in terms of compositional resources.\nPentatonic Scale\nComposers began to explore alternate scalar resources to Major and Minor. Modes\nwere employed as was thePentatonic scale24. The absence of aLeading Tonein the\nPentatonic scale, as well as its folk music associations, made it an attractive,\nnaturalistic alternative to Major and Minor scales.\nIn Jazz pedagogy, two distinct forms of the Pentatonic scale are recognized, called\nMajor PentatonicandMinor Pentatonic. They are so-called due to their inherently\nMajor or Minor sounding qualities.\nFigure 3.23 Pentatonic Scale Rotation\nAudio 15\nPentatonic Scale\n24.Properly, a scale that divides\nthe octave into five equal\nportions. In equal (click to see video)\ntemperament, this is most\nclosely approximated aurally\nby playing the black keys at the\npiano.\n113 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nSymmetrical Scale Patterns\nComposers in this historically transitional period and throughout the 20th Century\nseemed fascinated by aspects of symmetry in musical constructs.The symmetrical\nnature of the Pentatonic scale is not overtly obvious. The symmetry is there, but its\nexplanation must be held in abeyance contingent upon other acquired information.\nIn scale construction, this took the form of division of the octave into symmetrical\nportions. This is apparent in the types of scale patterns that came into common use\nin the late 19th Century and continued throughout the 20th Century.\nWhole Tone Scale\nTheWhole Tone Scale25, properly considered to be a Hexatonic (six-tone) scale,\ndisplays numerous symmetrical traits.There are numerous \u201caxes of symmetry\u201d in\nwhole tone scales. Only those pertinent to this discussion are included here.It is\ncomprised of all whole steps, dividing the octave symmetrically into six portions of\ntwo half steps each.\nFigure 3.24 The Whole Tone Scale\nSince this symmetrical division accounts for six of the possible twelve pitch-classes\nfrom the chromatic collection, the other six pitch-classes of the chromatic\ncollection form one other whole tone scale.\nFigure 3.25 Whole Tone I (WT I) and Whole Tone II (WT II)\nAudio 16\nWhole Tone Scales\n25.A hexatonic scale comprised of\nonly whole steps that divides (click to see video)\nthe octave symmetrically into\nsix equal portions of two half\nsteps each.\n3.5 Other Commonly Used Scales 114 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nEach whole tone scale replicates itself when re-ordered in a revolving manner.\nPitch-classes remain identical, the \u201cspacing\u201d remains identical, although\nenharmonic spellings are freely used.\nFigure 3.26 Revolving Whole Tone Scales\nAudio 17\nWhole Tone Scale Rotations\n(click to see video)\nBecause of these properties there are only two whole tone scales aurally. All other\nversions are re-orderings of eitherWT IorWT II, but will assume individual\nidentities according to their use is specific contexts.\nOctatonic Scale\nAnother commonly used symmetrical scale is called theOctatonic\nScale26.Theoretically, any scale with eight constituent members is an octatonic\nscale. The versions described here are those most commonly used. In Jazz pedagogy,\nthese versions are called \u201cdiminished scales\u201d or \u201csymmetrical diminished scales\u201d\nbecause of the structures formed by alternate scale degrees.The two related forms\nof the Octatonic Scale divide the octave into eight portions consisting of either\n26.An eight-tone scale. The most\nalternating half steps and whole steps, or alternating whole and half steps.\ncommon form is the\nsymmetrical division of the\noctave into eight portions of\neither alternating half steps\nand whole steps, or alternating\nwhole steps and half steps\n3.5 Other Commonly Used Scales 115 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nFigure 3.27 Octatonic I (Oct I) and Octatonic II (Oct II)\nAudio 18\nOctatonic Scales\n(click to see video)\nOct IandOct IIhave only three forms each.Figure 3.28 \"Octatonic Rotations\"shows\nOct Iwith additional re-orderings on successively higher scale degrees. Observe\nthat, after the original form and two additional transpositions have been listed, the\nfourth ordering is equivalent to the first, the fifth is equivalent to the second, and\nso forth. The same holds true forOct II.\nFigure 3.28 Octatonic Rotations\n\u201cAugmented\u201d Scale\nAnother commonly used hexatonic scale pattern is sometimes called the\n\u201cAugmented\u201d scale27.This hexachord, along with the Whole Tone, Octatonic, and\nChromatic scales are labeled \u201cModes of Limited Transposition\u201d in 20th-century\ncomposer Olivier Messiaen\u2019sTechniques de mon langage musical.This label refers to\nthe chords built upon alternate scale degrees. This is also a symmetrical construct,\nevenly dividing the octave by the pattern, \u201chalf step and a step and a half.\u201d It\u2019s\nrelated counterpart divides the octave by the reverse pattern, \u201cstep and a half and\nhalfstep.\u201d\n27.A hexatonic scale that\nsymmetrically divides the\noctave by alternating half step\nand step-and-a-half, or the\nreverse.\n3.5 Other Commonly Used Scales 116 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nFigure 3.29 \u201cAugmented\u201d Scale\nAudio 19\nThe \u201cAugmented\u201d Scale\n(click to see video)\n\u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone and Lydian-Mixolydian\nTwo other scales having great currency in 20th Century music are identical in pitch\ncontent and identical in their potential origin, but vastly different in context and\nusage.Figure 3.30 \"\u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone and Lydian-Mixolydian\"compares the\nWhole Tone scale to the\u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone28Hexachord and theLydian-\nDominant29scale.Lydian-Dominant is only one label for this scale and is used here\nas a convenience only. Other names are Lydian-Dominant (common to Jazz\npedagogy) or (the proper name) the Overtone Scale. These additional names will\nnot acquire meaning until the student has acquired additional information.Observe\nthat, despite differing orderings, the pitch-class content is identical for the\n\u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone and Lydian-Dominant scales.\nFigure 3.30 \u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone and Lydian-Mixolydian\n28.A six-tone scale that is an\naltered whole tone scale.

While the primary focus of the student\nshould be upon Major and Minor scales at this juncture, at least a passing\nfamiliarity with other scalar constructs is desirable.\nOne cannot begin to understand and perform early music without an understanding\nof modes. Much music since 1900 has been composed using modes or, at least,\nmodal \u201cflavors.\u201d One cannot improvise credibly in the Jazz style without\nunderstanding and employing modes.\nThese same remarks may be made concerning the other scales discussed. One\ncannot begin to understand and perform modern music without an understanding\nof these various scale patterns. In time, with the proper investment of effort, these\nscales (and others) will open new worlds in a deepening musical experience.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThe student should understand:\n\u2022 The Pentatonic Scale.\n\u2022 Whole Tone Scales, Octatonic Scales, Augmented Scales.\n\u2022 \u201cNearly\u201d Whole Tone and Lydian-Mixolydian.\n3.5 Other Commonly Used Scales 118 Chapter 3 The Foundations Scale-Steps and Scales\nEXERCISES\n1.
