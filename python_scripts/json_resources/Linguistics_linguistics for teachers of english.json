Basically,\nit is the study of language. Oh, but it is so much more. Linguistics is culturally based.\nIt is also rules based.\nMy goal is to help you explore linguistics in ways you have never considered. You will\ncertainly begin to analyze your own speech patterns and variations as well as those\naround you.\nThis text will encourage you to think about your language and communication in ways\nnot thought of before. You might think of your communication from social aspects, or\nyour language from dialectal differences.\nThe link below is a broad overview of Linguistics and may answer a few of your\nquestions.\nThis E-Lecture discusses the term language and summarizes the goals of the central\nbranches of linguistics before it eventually deals with the main principles of collecting\ndata in linguistics.\nIntroduction 1 When speaking about languages, it is common to speak of them in the feminine case.\nWhen diagramming a language, we use a tree and call the branches sister languages,\nor mother tongues.\nEnglish follows the West Germanic branch to Proto Indo-European. Note also, that\nEnglish may have close ties to French, which has its main branch through Latin to\nProto Indo-European.\n2 Introduction Unit 1\nHistory\nThe history of our language is a colorful and exciting one. To begin, our\nlanguage has not always sounded like it does today. Believe it or not, to today\u2019s\nspeaker of English, our language may have sounded much more like German\nand Latin from its origins.\nIn this unit you will:\n\u2022 Learn the history (and some very interesting stories) of English from\nOlde English, Middle English, and Early Modern English time periods\n\u2022 Listen to Olde, Middle, and Early Modern English as it was spoken\n\u2022 Practice speaking some of each time period\nHistory 3 Olde English\nOlde English Timeline\n4 History A Little History\nRome\nRoman Occupation 55 BC - 410 AD\nWhen Rome was in the process of conquering\nthe world, Englalond (England), was very\nmuch in their sights. Mostly because England\nhas strong sea ports and trade routes already in\nplace.\nRome in England from 55 BC to 410 AD\nBy the 1st century AD, Roman Empire\ngoverned all of the Italian peninsula, Romania,\nSwitzerland, England, France, and most of the\nMediterranean region as well as parts of North\nAfrica.\nLatin CC0\nLanguage:\n\u2022 Romans force language change in many ways, but primarily through forcing merchants\nto do all their trade in Latin.\n\u2022 Soon after infiltrating the commerce, they force the use of Latin in government.\n\u2022 Next, they force the use of Latin in Religion and education.\nOlde English 5 The Germanic Invasion\nRome Leaves England\nWhen the Romans begin to\nleave England, other groups\nbegin to invade. They were\nnot as concerned with\nmaintaining a language,\nso the use of Latin as the\nlanguage of commerce,\ngovernment, religion and\neducation remained.\nGroups That Invade\nEngland Through 1066:\nNorth\u2014Irish/Gaelic,\nScots, Picts\nSouth/East\u2014Angles,\nSaxons, Frisians\nThroughout England\u2014\nScandinavian (Vikings)\n(See Map Left)\nFrom Germanic to Modern English\nWhy was Latin not the \u201ccommon\u201d language?\nConsider what you know already about the way the Romans forced the Latin\nlanguage. Why, then, when the English went home, did they not speak Latin?\n6 History Scandinavian Influences\nThe Scandinavians influences in the English language from about 700 to 1066 have\nremained, for the most part, unchanged. They include:\n\u2022 Patronymics:\nEarly England: Created by Three Invasions\nThe idea of knowing who you\n\u00b7 Roman Occupation \u00b7 Germanic Invasions\nare based on your father\u2019s\nname. For example, if your\nfather\u2019s name was Peter,\nyou become Peter\u2019sson or\nPeter\u2019stadtter. So, Leonard\nHofstadter (of The Big Bang\nCC2.5\nfame) is actually an ancestor of\na man whose name was Hof,\n\u00b7 French\nwho had a daughter!\n\u2022 Personal Pronouns:\nThe Scandinavians brought\nCC0 CC0\nwith them the idea of third\nperson plural pronouns.\nThe words include: they, them, their, and themselves. Can you imagine carrying on a\nconversation without those pronouns?\n\u2022 \u201csk\u201d\nMost interesting is the sound signified by the Scandinavian letters [s k]. There is a story,\nthat may or may not be true, the name for the garment \u2018skirt\u2019or \u2018skyrta\u2019 was pronounced\n[sh ee r t a] by the Scandinavians. Now this was confusing for the English who also had\na word \u2018scyrte\u2019 which was pronounced [sh ee r t uh]. So, to reduce the confusion, the\nEnglish began pronouncing the \u2018sc\u2019 as we would pronounce the \u2018sk\u2019 today and \u2018scyrte\u2019\nbecame \u2018skirt\u2019 and \u2018skyrta\u2019 became \u2018shirt\u2019.\nInteresting note: in many Norwegian countries today the \u2018sk\u2019 sound is pronounced [sh].\nOlde English 7 \u2022 Place Names:\nMany places in England were\nnamed by the Scandinavians.\nThey used suffixes, such as:\nby, thwaite, and dale.\nDal(e): to signify a valley\nCC0\nThwaite: to signify\na place in or near a\nmeadow\nCC0\nBy: to signify\nwho owned\nthe property\nDepartment of the Environment,UK. CC0.\n8 History Ruthwell Cross\n(see Map page 5)\nThe story of the Ruthwell Cross and the\nstory written on it is very important to our\nlanguage.\nThe Ruthwell Cross gives us one of the first\npoems written in the Runic alphabet. This\ncross tells the story of Christ and his walk to\nGolgotha. What is most interesting is that this\npoem is told from the perspective of the cross.\nThe title of the poem is \u201cThe Dream of the\nRood.\u201d Rood in Olde English translates to\nwood.\n\u201cKrist w\u00e6s on rodi. Hwethr\u00e6 ther fus\u00e6 ferran\nkwomu \u00e6ththil\u00e6 til anum.\u201d\nCC BY: Daniel O'Donnell\n(July 25, 2012)\nOlde English 9 Runes\nIt is not known exactly why\nthe Runes have faded from\nexistence. What is important,\nis that the pagan peoples who\nlived in the northern part of\nEngland, what is now Scotland,\nused this alphabet and now do\nnot.\nHave you ever considered what\nit might be like if our ancestors\nmight have continued using this\nalphabet instead of the Roman\nalphabet?\nCaedmon\u2019s Hymn\nThe story of Caedmon\u2019s Hymn is one of a man who wanted to be a priest. In\nthe days of the Olde English time period, it was expected that priests would\nsing and write their own music. Caedmon was not talented in either of these\n(or so the story goes). He was a simple cow/sheep herder. His lifelong dream\nwas to live among the priests at the abbey.\nHowever, one night, while Caedmon slept, he had a dream that he wrote a song.\nHe quickly shared this with the leader of the abbey where he lived.\nHis hymn is the oldest poem written in English. It is dated to approximately\n658 and 680.\n10 History Musical Composition of the West Saxon version of Caedmon\u2019s Hymn, lyrics by Caedmon;\nmusic and performance by Clay Paramore, with Laura Aaron on piano.

Elected by the Court, not the people.\nThe conflict continues as there are others who claim the throne, too.\n\u2022 First, William of Normandy, who has some distant claim, that may not be strong\n\u2022 Also, Edgar of Hungary, has a mother who is certain he has a claim to the throne\n\u2022 Next in line is Harald of Norway also claims to be successor, as well\nThe Plot Thickens\nFrom April to September forces gather against each other\nHarold had a brother (Tostig). He was estranged and lived in France. He sided with\nHarald and fought battles with him.\nHarold had the support of the Normans. Remember, they are French.\nWilliam began gathering the Germanic peoples from villages all across England.\nBy September he has a very strong army.\nHe has the support of nearly all of England\u2019s commoners. He cannot seem to conquer\nLondon.\nNOTE: London is the seat of Government, Education, Religion. It has the busiest ports,\nand had the most inhabitants of all major cities.\nOlde English 15 Through the months of September\u2013December\nHarold defeated and killed Harald and Tostig.

He is crowned King on Dec. 23, 1066.\nThere you have it\u2026four rulers in one year. Two Anglo Saxon, one Hungarian, one French.\nThis year, 1066, began for England two things. The first, the concept of pride of\nnationality. William helped with that by gathering the villagers together. The second was\nthe idea that the aristocracy would befriend the French, or hate them. Depending on who\nwas King or Queen, would depend on the relationship between England and France.

People are\nfree, now, to pursue personal enlightenment and knowledge.\nDuring the early 1600s, English is\nnow, not only spoken in England,\nbut is transplanted to North America\nwith the founding of Jamestown.\nThis also pushes the Age of Reason\ninto the colonies. As man felt the\ncall to find his own path in regards\nto religion, many felt they must\nleave England to do so.\nIt was during this time that leaders\nin circles of intellect and writing\nbegin calling for changes in how\nJamestown: the first English speaking community in\nthe English view their language.\nAmerica. CC0 PD.\nPrescriptivism is born.\n28 History Early Modern English Timeline\nEarly Modern English 29 The Age of Reason:\nThe Early Presciptivists\n1564\u20131616 Lifetime of Shakespeare\nAlthough not always considered one of the founding Prescriptivists, Shakespeare did\ninfluence the language of those early Prescriptivists. He made up words, definitions,\netc., which certainly may have helped those who were on the mission to set and refine\nthe English language.\n1611 King James Bible\nSome claim that the King James Bible was\nprinted on Caxton\u2019s Press. It is possible.\nOne interesting note is that Samuel\nJohnson\u2019s did use King James\u2019 Bible as\na source for his definitions in his early\neditions of his dictionary.\nPicture by Jeremylinvip: CCBY-SA 3.0.\n1679 Dryden wants \u201crules and standards\u201d\nJohn Dryden was most noted as being a straight forward poet and writer. Many claim\nthat it is Dryden who established the rule that English sentences should not end in\nprepositions. He believed that standards for English would enhance not diminish its\nfunction.\n1697 Defoe proposes an English Academy\nDaniel Defoe is most famous for his novel, Robinson Crusoe. He was a prolific\npamphleteer. He was imprisoned for a libel case. Yet he wrote in favor of\ncreating an Academy in which English be established as the formal language of\nthe unified England.\n30 History 1712 Swift proposes an English Academy to parliament\nJonathan Swift also wanted an academy and proposes the idea to Parliament. He believed\nin the power of the people and wanted a country where national pride was foremost.\n1755 Johnson publishes dictionary\nSamuel Johnson writes the first English dictionary. He was\nunder contract to write his dictionary in 1746. It was published\nin 1755. He was to known to state that what took the French\nAcademy nearly 40 years to do for their language was\naccomplished by one man in only 9 years.\n1761 Priestley publishes first\ngrammar book\nJoseph Priestley is the first to write\na book on English grammar in,\nRudiments of English Grammar. CC0 PDUS\n1762 Lowth publishes second grammar book\nJust a year later, Robert Lowth publishes his grammar book,\nA Short Introduction to English Grammar, With Critical Notes.\nIt is from these men we have what is called Prescriptivism,\nCC0 PDUS\ntoday. These men wanted to prescribe for its speakers what the\nEnglish language ought to be and to refine the language. They\nsought to keep language in a fixed and permanent state.\nEarly Modern English 31 Prescriptivism\nWhat is Prescriptivism? Picture by\nHayKranen: CC0.\nPrescriptivism is prescribing language.\nIt is how a group of 6 men wanted to \u2018fix\u2019 the\nEnglish language in a permanent way. To put\nlanguage in a box and keep it from changing.\nWhat these six guys stood for was order and regulation.\nWhat they did not sanction among many others was clipped words, contractions,\nand slang.\nThink of the language we speak today. Can you imagine speaking and never using\na contraction or a word that has been clipped?\nAnd, oh my, the slang we use today! I imagine the 6 guys would turn over in their\ngraves to hear the language we use today.\nEnd Results\nThe end result of prescriptivism left people thinking that language must be fixed.\nPrescriptivism did not allow for changes in the language either in pronunciation or\nspelling. Prescriptivism sought to logically order language using grammar rules and\nregulations, which we have adopted and maintained ever since.\n32 History The Growth of our Lexicon\nPicture by Derivation\nHayKranen: CC0.\nHow to make:\nThese kinds of words are very common\nroot word + suffix/prefix = new word\nand have been useful in creating ways of\nspeaking and being understood.\nYou begin with a root word like \u2018lock\u2019.\nUN + + ABLE = Unlockable\nBy adding a prefix or a suffix a new word\ncan be created.\nCC0\nThis is especially helpful in understanding\nif some can or cannot be done, in this case,\nlocked.\nCompounding\nThese kinds of words are very common today. Compounding begins with two words that\ndo not have anything in common.\nIn this case a neck and a lace. By\nHow to make: combining the two, we get a new\nWord A + Word B = Word AB\nword \u2018necklace\u2019.\nAnother favorite is dug and out.\nYet, when we compound them, we\n+ = Necklace\nget a new noun which we all know\nas dugout.\nCC0\nEarly Modern English 33 Blending\nThese kinds of words are\nHow to make:\nmade by blending two\nTake 2 words, put together and take letters off\nwords that have something\nin common. This example\nblends breakfast and lunch,\n+ = Brunch\nwhich are words for meals,\ninto brunch.\nThis category is not as CC0\npopular as some of the other\nways to grow the lexicon, but\nit certainly is more creative.\nClipping\nHow to make:\nThis way to add to the lexicon is closely tied to\nClip word to make it short\nease of articulation, in that it shortens a longer\nTelephone\nword to make it easier to say.\nYouth often clip words and they become\nPhone\nmainstream. Very much the way telephone\nCC0 becomes phone.\n34 History Acronyms\nOne way to create:\nThere are several ways that\nTake the first letter of each word to create\nacronyms are created. The most\na new word\ncommon is to create a word using\nthe first letter of each word, as in\nNational Aeronautics and\nNASA. Space Administration\nMany acronyms can be credited to\nthe military.\nNASA\nCan you think of others?\nCC0\nThe Legacy...\nWhat these six guys left us was a system of rules and regulations upon which we base\nour language today. For example, they tried to banish multiple negatives, they created\nterms and definitions for comparatives and superlatives and so much more. Whole\ngrammar books full!\nThey ultimately began asking speakers of English to think of their language as a set of\nprescribed rules. They established for us, through these rules, a way to judge whether\none speaks well or poorly.\nEarly Modern English 35 Standardization\nThe standardization of the English language began long before the 6 Guys began\ncalling for refinement and prescribing what language ought to be.\nIn your own words, how did the following help standardize English?\n\u2022 Bubonic Plague 1319 (Middle English)\n\u2022 Caxton\u2019s Press (Middle English)\n\u2022 Regionalism (Early Modern English)\n\u2022 Prescriptivism (Early Modern English)\nYou should be able to discuss how each of these are related to the\nstandardization of our language.

However, by the time we reach the Middle English era, thou and\nye functioned more like their German equivalents. Thou, thy, and thee were used in\naddressing children, your friends, and persons of inferior rank. These forms were often\nused to address those in a lower social class and to express anger or contempt. Ye, your,\nand you were used when addressing a superior or a stranger. Children often used the \u201cy\u201d\nforms of address.\nShakespeare ALWAYS used \u201cthou\u201d (thee, thy) to refer to the lower classes.\nUsing the above information and the following line:\n\u201cGet thee to a nunnery!\u201d\nHow did Hamlet view Ophelia?\nThe Lord\u2019s Prayer (King James Version)\nOur Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\nThy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\nAnd lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom,\nAnd the power, and the glory, for ever.

When most people speak of a dialect, they usually have in mind features of\ngrammar, more than differing pronunciations. In the United States pronunciations do\nnot seem to be terribly important. Thus, there are varieties of SAE that are labeled\nNorthern, New England, Southern, Midwest etc. yet, all are considered Standard.\nThis is not to say we do not make evaluations of speech based on dialect, because\nwe do! In general we tend to be far more tolerant of variation in dialect than we are\nof grammatical variation.\u201d \u2014 Language Files, 2004.\nPoints to Remember:\nWhen considering Standard American English:\n\u2022 Most lay-people often associate SAE with the written word\nHowever, for this course, we will be concentrating on the spoken word\n\u2022 Relates to social class and level of education (see G-Dropping chart page 48)\n\u2022 In media is vital\n\u2022 The status of any group is more important in determining the standard\n\u00bb Remember the London dialect?\n\u2022 Norms of any \u201cstandard\u201d dialect are ALWAYS based on judgement of\nsocial acceptability\nDialects 53 BABA WAWA\nIn the 60\u2019s there was a woman who wanted to become a lead television news reporter.\nThe network she worked for would not allow her to because she spoke with an \u201cr-less\u201d\nspeech pattern common to Boston, where she was from.\nThe three major networks wanted (and still do) their anchors and reporters to sound as\nif they could come from everywhere and nowhere.
