Wooldridge\niv Introduction\nI would like to take a brief moment to explain the origin, purpose, layout, and uses of this work. I\nfirst got involved in using Open Educational Resources (OER) all the way back in 2005 through the\ninfluence of numerous professors and other graduate students when I was in graduate school at Bowling\nGreen State University (in Ohio, not Kentucky) and continued to use them six years later as a clinical\nassistant professor at Washington State University. This was before the materials we used were known\nas OER. Instead of a traditional textbook, in some of our courses we used a combination of works in the\npublic domain and/or articles available to all students electronically through the school\u2019s library. It took\nsome effort to gather them and point students to them, but there was no loss in educational quality and\nthe students were able to save money by not having to buy what could be very expensive textbooks. In\nfact, a majority of the material we used (and I still use) is present in many textbooks. Fast forward to\ntoday, and there are many OER works coming from many different sources: single-author works, works\nwritten by multiple authors, textbooks that are old enough the publishers don\u2019t care about them anymore\nso the authors decided to release them into the public domain, edited collections of articles by authors\nwilling to give their work away for free (as is the case with this volume), and works that are collections\nof classic texts that are old enough to be in the public domain (which make up the bulk of the OER\ntextbooks I have created). I believe it is vital to approach all textbooks as learning tools, which means\nthey should never be relied upon as the only method of conferring information and can even be\ninaccurate, assuming the inaccuracies are used as learning points. With this attitude, it follows that OER\nworks, even if they are not as polished or perfect as traditional textbooks, are just as useful, of\ncomparable quality, and are greatly more accessible due their free and electronic nature.\nI have organized this textbook around the way I teach my introductory course in ethics. Since I\ngot to design this textbook and it\u2019s for use in my own courses, it directly follows the order in which I\nteach the topics and each chapter makes up the reading assignment for about 1.5 hours of class time. In\nother words, I meet with students for thirty 1.5-hour sessions in a semester (hence there are 30 chapters\nin this work), and for the first meeting, we read and discuss chapter 1, for our second we cover chapter\n2, then chapter 3, and so on. It leaves the guess work out of what we cover and when we cover it and\nkeeps things very organized and streamlined. I tell you this now to give you some insight into the way I\napproach my classroom and time with my students. Since this is intended for an intro-level course,\nkeeping things on track, moving, and organized in this way has proved to be very beneficial for my\nstudents.\nI know that this work is the same quality as the classic and standard textbooks used in many\nintroduction to ethics courses, which includes a number of chapters on important contemporary topics in\nethics that students ought to be familiar with. Having read through everything in this volume multiple\ntimes, I know that students will benefit from the great quality of the pieces contained within it. These\nworks come to us for free from the donated time of numerous philosophers to whom I am greatly\nindebted and are acknowledged on the previous page. Because of their hard work, I know this textbook\nwill be useful for anyone that is taking an introduction to ethics class or is interested in learning more\nabout ethics. The articles, while sometimes challenging, are readable and accessible even to newcomers\nto philosophy. If you find this work useful, I humbly ask that you spread the good news to others about\nthis work and other OERs. The more people use and create these materials, the better and more\naccessible education will become.\nv Contents\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY ETHICS: TECHNOLOGY, AFFIRMATIVE\nACTION, AND IMMIGRATION .............................................................................................................. 1\n1 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings (Noah Levin) ................. 3\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?

Combine these two\nquotes, however, and we are left a bit of a conundrum: we must examine life for it to have value, but we\nare unlikely to come to know anything from this examination. Still, Socrates would argue, the pursuit of\nknowledge is important and fruitful. Examining life, ideas, knowledge, experience, and anything and\neverything we can think of, in a pursuit of truth and knowledge, is of the utmost importance. Yet, we\nmust also recognize the limits of our abilities and approach all endeavors with a healthy dose of humility\nand openness. But if we are to examine life, where would this pursuit take us?\nHis two successors, Plato and Aristotle, had a goal in mind: we do Philosophy to arrive at an\nunderstanding of the ideal society. What\u2019s the point of living if we aren\u2019t achieving a life of, as Aristotle\nputs it, excellence (ar\u00eate in Greek) and flourishing (eudaimonia)? Their philosophical examinations\nculminated in proposing an ideal state, and examining such a society falls under the umbrella of\nPolitical Philosophy. An integral part of a flourishing society includes setting up a system wherein\neveryone can attain happiness and live the good life. But why should we care about happiness? Or even\nother people? Why not just care about our own pleasures? An important part of their analyses is doing\nEthics: studying right, wrong, good, and bad. How do we value happiness? Why do we value it? Do we\nvalue other things? Other people? What makes someone good? And so on. Thus, the final aim of Plato\nand Aristotle, and the purpose of Philosophy, was to do Ethics. I might be biased, however, since this is\nan Ethics textbook and I am primarily an Ethicist by training. Of course, anyone could argue that their\nfield of Philosophy is more important to living a good life, like Metaphysics (the study of the nature of\nreality), Epistemology (the study of knowledge), Logic (the study of reason), and any other field. And\nthey\u2019d be right: you can\u2019t do ethics without doing all of these things (and I\u2019d argue you can\u2019t do those\nwithout doing ethics). You have to be clear on the ideas you\u2019re using and how they relate to get\nanywhere in any branch of philosophy. Most people don\u2019t necessarily concern themselves with abstract\nconcepts of knowledge on a daily basis, but we have to interact with people daily and are thus\nconfronted with making moral decisions many times every day. We have to do things for ourselves and\nothers, so how do we know what\u2019s right to do? That is, of course, assuming we want to be good people.\nBut what does good even mean?\nThis textbook will cover these topics, and many more, in detail. To frame these questions and\nanalysis, we will focus primarily on contemporary moral issues, from those in medical ethics\n(euthanasia, abortion, etc.) to how we should treat non-human things (like the environment and animals)\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY ETHICS: TECHNOLOGY, AFFIRMATIVE\nACTION, AND IMMIGRATION 1 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nand issues that affect society as a whole, like technology and immigration, which is where we\u2019ll begin.\nThere will also be readings (mostly classic selections from extremely influential philosophers that you\nmight have actually heard of, like Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, and Immanuel Kant) that cover the\ntheories behind the moral principles we will be applying. It is actually much easier to understand these\ntheories after examining how we normally apply them in our daily lives, so these chapters with \u201cclassic\u201d\nreadings will come in the later half of this work. It might seem backward, as it would seem more natural\nto learn the theories and then apply them, but it\u2019s really not. You already know how to do ethics and you\ndo moral analyses on a daily basis, and once you examine how we all regularly do morality, you are\nbetter positioned to appreciate the concepts that drive our moral habits.\nThere are two terms that will be used interchangeably in this work: ethics and morality. They\nare clearly separate words and you would assume (and many people do) that they would thus mean\ndifferent things. But, for the branch of philosophy that is called both \u201cEthics\u201d and \u201cMorality\u201d, they mean\nthe exact same thing. Many people will take issue with this and want to say I\u2019m wrong (which is a moral\nor ethical claim). But I get to play the expert card right now: in Philosophy, I have yet to meet someone\nthat is an expert in the field of Ethics (or Morality) and believes the two mean something significantly\ndifferent. Oftentimes non-philosophers will want to correct me and say that \u201cEthics is the theory;\nMorality is how we apply it\u201d (or is it the other way around?), and I will admit that in some fields that\nmight be how they use the terms. There is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of morality,\nhowever, and that is called Meta-Ethics (from the Greek for \u201cabout ethics\u201d), so we do have a word for\nthat. The application of moral theories to actions is sometimes called Applied or Normative Ethics, so\nthere is also a term for that. But morality and ethics mean the same thing here, so why do we have two\nwords that mean the same thing? It\u2019s simple: ethics (as a word) comes from Greek and morality (as a\nword) comes from Latin. English uses words from many languages, and we tend to keep them all, even\nwhen they mean the same thing. I\u2019ve probably written more than I need to already, but all I want to\nmake clear is that you, the reader, should understand that ethics and morality mean the same things in\nthis work. You will come to learn that getting very clear on the terms we use is vital to doing a proper\nmoral analysis, so it is important to always pay close attention to language and clarify terms whenever it\nseems necessary. You don\u2019t want to be misunderstood and you don\u2019t want to misunderstand others. The\nphilosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once believed that all philosophical problems are just linguistic\nproblems. He changed his mind about this later on in his life, but he had a point: a lot of problems we\nhave with each other are often not due to genuine disagreements (where we will be unable to find some\ncommon ground) but are rather misunderstandings due to language.\nThis first unit is meant to give you a taste of ethics and how it is applied. Chapter 1, The \u201cTrolley\nProblem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings, is a fictional short story about potential\nmoral settings for self-driving cars in the near future. Chapter 2, What is Ethics and What Makes\nSomething a Problem for Morality? by David Svolba, explains the basic aspects of doing ethics and how\nit uniquely deals with problems. Chapter 3, Letter from the Birmingham City Jail by Martin Luther\nKing, Jr, is a powerful letter written to his fellow clergymen while he was imprisoned for leading civil\ndisobedience movements (in this case, the Alabama bus boycotts) in an attempt to end segregation in the\nUnited States. Chapter 4, A Defense of Affirmative Action, explores the reasons on all sides of policies\nthat are aimed at helping minorities obtain positions in a system that unfairly overlooks them. Chapter 5,\nThe Moral Issues of Immigration by B.M. Wooldridge, discusses the various angles of immigration and\nits problems and benefits. Chapter 6, The Ethics of our Digital Selves, analyzes the role that emerging\ntechnologies have on conceptions of our personal identities and how this has ethical implications.\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CONTEMPORARY ETHICS: TECHNOLOGY, AFFIRMATIVE\nACTION, AND IMMIGRATION 2 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n1\nThe \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars:\nYour Car\u2019s Moral Settings\nNoah Levin1\n\u201cWe have decided to put the moral decisions related to our crash-avoidance and self-driving\nfeatures into the hands of the consumer. After all, it is your vehicle and you will be behind the wheel. Or\nmaybe you won\u2019t be. Our proprietary system allows for you to customize all settings depending on who\nis in the vehicle, who is driving, and what conditions present themselves on the road,\u201d Bob, the\nsalesman, told Hillary.\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018moral decisions\u2019?\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a classic problem in philosophy known as \u2018The Trolley Problem\u2019 and it\u2019s a simple\nversion of a scenario we like to analyze to help determine your settings. Are you familiar with it? No? It\ncan help explain what we have in mind, so it\u2019s a good starting point. Let me show you how it works,\u201d\nBob said as he touched his screen a few times causing a holographic projection of a red trolley (the type\nthat were still in use on the streets of San Francisco) to appear on the table between them.\n\u201cYou see, this is a runaway trolley and it\u2019s flying downhill on the track. There\u2019s a fork ahead and\nit\u2019s headed toward the path to the right. You happen to be standing at the trolley tracks and your hand is\non the lever controlling the fork, so you can choose which track it goes down,\u201d Bob explained as the\nhologram zoomed out a little to reveal the fork in the tracks while a lever appeared in front of Hillary\nindicating the switch would currently send the trolley down the right path.\n\u201cOK, so what\u2019s the issue? There\u2019s no one in the trolley and I don\u2019t know where it wants to go, so\nwhat do I need to do?\u201d Hillary asked, a little intrigued by the simulation. She hadn\u2019t bought a car in\nyears and was unprepared for both the sophisticated level of technology in her potential vehicle and the\ntactics used by the salesmen.\n\u201cCorrect, there\u2019s no one in the trolley, but there are people down both of the tracks. You see, a\nmad philosopher \u2013 I know, bear with me, this was popularized by the philosopher Judith Jarvis\nThompson after all \u2013 has tied down a number of people. Specifically, there are 5 people on the track the\ntrolley is headed down and 1 on the other track,\u201d Bob said as the hologram zoomed out further to show\nthe situation. All 6 of the people on the tracks had indiscernible features to the point that Hillary\ncouldn\u2019t make out any details, not even general age or gender.\n\u201cNow, you have a decision to make,\u201d Bob continued as the trolley slowly rolled toward the fork.\n\u201cYou can do one of two things: nothing or pull the switch. If you do nothing, the trolley will kill the 5\npeople. If you act and pull the lever, then the trolley will switch tracks and kill the single person. What\nwill you do? All you need to do is pull that switch to change the track.\u201d\n\u201cThose can\u2019t be the only two options. Can I shout at those people? Untie them in time? Hop on\nthe trolley and pull the brakes? Put the switch in the middle so the trolley derails?\u201d she said as she\ndelicately moved the switch trying to get it to stick in the middle, having no luck.\n1 Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College.

This work released under a CC-BY license.\n1 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings\nNoah Levin 3 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n\u201cNope! There are only those two options. Anything else you try to do won\u2019t work, and will take\nup any time you have to make a decision which would mean the trolley will continue down its track and\nkill the 5 people. That's the point of this: you must choose between those two options,\u201d Bob said.\nHillary thought as the trolley continued on its path toward the fork. It didn\u2019t take her much\nlonger to deliberate, and she set the lever to the track with the 1 person on it.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kill 1 or 5, right? I\u2019d rather less people die. This is all really the fault of the \u2018Mad\nPhilosopher\u2019 anyway,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cMost people make the decision you just made, and for those same reasons. However, there\u2019s\nsomething to think about: rather than saving those 5 people, did you just kill 1? After all, that person\nwasn\u2019t going to die until you did anything,\u201d Bob asked.\n\u201cIn some sense, I suppose I did, but someone was going to die. If I didn\u2019t do anything, then those\n5 people would die, and there was something I could have done to prevent that. It\u2019s unfortunate for that\none person, but I\u2019d hope they would understand,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cThere are those people that believe there is a big moral difference between allowing something\nto happen and doing it yourself. But I can tell that you don\u2019t think so. Whatever happens in this situation\nis in your hands, and you\u2019re ultimately partly responsible for the results it would seem. That\u2019s why it\u2019s\nso important that you think about what settings you want to use in your new car,\u201d Bob stated.\n\u201cBut what settings are there exactly? If it\u2019s just to choose how many people to save, then that\u2019s\neasy: save more people. Why wouldn\u2019t I pick that option?\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cGreat question! Let\u2019s change this up a little. Instead of the train heading down the track with the\n5 people, it\u2019s headed down the track with only 1 person,\u201d as Bob said this, the 5 people shifted to the\nother track in the hologram, but the track the trolley was headed down remained empty.\n\u201cNow, Hillary, I don\u2019t mean any offense by this, and I don\u2019t want you to be shocked, but we\u2019ve\nfound this to be very effective at helping you decide which settings are correct for you and your family,\u201d\nand, as he said this, a little girl just five-years-old appeared on the track the Trolley was headed down.\n\u201cVanessa? What is she doing there? Why is my daughter in your little game?!\u201d she shouted.\n\u201cMy apologies, I\u2019ll take her out,\u201d as he said this, the girl was replaced with a boy version of\nVanessa. \u201cYou get the point. What would you do if you had to choose between the life of your daughter\nand 5 strangers?\u201d Bob asked.\n\u201cWell, my daughter, of course! What kind of monster would kill their own child?\u201d Hillary\nshouted again.\n\u201cOf course you would save her. But remember what you had just said about saving more lives\nthan less \u2013 that only matters to you when you don\u2019t know anything about the people that might be killed.\nNow, I assure you, that there are people that choose to, sadly enough, sacrifice their own child to save\nthose 5 lives. It\u2019s not an easy decision to make, but they believe their child would want to make that\nsacrifice,\u201d Bob said, attempting to calm Hillary. He was clearly used to these sorts of reactions.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see what this has to do with my new car. When would my daughter be in the road\nand the only way to avoid her is by killing 5 strangers? And where am I? I\u2019m not even a part of this. I\u2019m\njust standing on the outside,\u201d Hillary asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right! You are not really involved in this situation, so it isn\u2019t exactly something that\nmight happen when you\u2019re driving your new car. This is why we\u2019ve devised a different scenario to help\nyou understand the actual options in our moral decision-making algorithm and choose the most\nappropriate parameters for your family. The Trolley Problem was just the beginning so you can better\nappreciate this scenario,\u201d Bob said as he began tapping at his screen once again. The holographic\nsimulation of the trolley disappeared and the minivan that Hillary was considering appeared driving\n1 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings\nNoah Levin 4 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ndown a curvy mountain road.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s say you\u2019re out for a relaxing mountain drive. You need some time to yourself and\njust needed to get away, so you\u2019re blasting your favorite tunes on our 12-speaker award-winning sound\nsystem using our safety assist driving mode, which puts you in control but keeps an eye on things so that\nyou don\u2019t get into an accident, not that you would, but just in case you lose yourself too much in your\nmusic, the car has you covered. Suddenly, you turn a corner and see a family of 5 standing in the middle\nof the road since they just emerged from their wrecked car when it hit a boulder that had recently fallen\noff the mountainside. They were driving a very old car that didn\u2019t have the latest auto-braking\ntechnologies, but had all thankfully survived with only minor injuries. You\u2019re in control of the wheel\nand have just enough time to react. You see that there are only 2 options: smash into the back of their car\nand risk serious injury to yourself or avoid it and hit the family. Plunging off the cliff would be certain\ndeath (we don\u2019t have ejection seats \u2013 yet!), so it\u2019s either hit the family or take your chances crashing.\nOur safety systems are topnotch and we receive the highest crash rating year after year. But you never\nknow what\u2019s going to happen in an accident like this. The family might be fine as well if you hit them or\nthey might jump out of the way in time, but they aren\u2019t surrounded by 7 different airbags like you are.\nNow, what would you do?\u201d As Bob explained the scenario, the hologram changed to match. Only\ninstead of a switch, there were two buttons in front of Hillary: one that said \u201cHit the car\u201d and another\nthat said \u201cHit the family.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but see my family standing there when I look at these people. I couldn\u2019t hit them, so\nI\u2019d take the chance on myself,\u201d Hillary said as she pushed the button indicating her choice. The\nhologram stopped just before impact.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite noble of you. But \u2013 now, again, don\u2019t be shocked \u2013 what if your family were in the\ncar with you? Let\u2019s keep it limited. Not your entire family, but just you and\u2026Vanessa, was it?\u201d Bob\nasked, now sounding more like a casket salesman than a car salesman.\n\u201cI can\u2019t risk her like I will risk myself. My job as a parent is to protect her. That family shouldn\u2019t\nhave been standing in the middle of the road anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t be entirely my fault,\u201d she stated,\nreassuring herself of her decision.\n\u201cOf course, I understand. From what you\u2019ve said, it sounds like you\u2019re interested in our most\npopular settings, which a full 91% of new car owners choose. There are a lot of options, but I can\nsummarize how it will work out in the real world for you, if you like,\u201d Bob said as a list with at least 50\ncheckboxes appeared in place of the simulation.\n\u201cPlease, go on,\u201d Hillary said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice yourself for the sake of others \u2013 again, that\u2019s very commendable of\nyou \u2013 and always want to save the most lives that you can, unless your family is on the line\u2013\u201d Bob said\nbefore Hillary interrupted him.\n\u201cNo, not my entire family, just children. Nephews, nieces, and any other kids included,\u201d Hillary\nclarified.\n\u201cAnd grandchildren someday, of course! My apologies, I misspoke. Yes, we will prioritize the\nlives of any children in your new vehicle, but count adults in your vehicle the same as those outside of it.\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic, should we also prioritize the lives of children outside the car as well? We can\nput whatever weighting on them you like when the system does its calculations in the unfortunate event\nof unavoidable catastrophe. Most customers opt for a 2:1 value ratio \u2013 minors count twice as much as\nadults. However, we do have customers that value the elderly at a higher rate. We can set the parameters\nhowever you want, and we need not make these decisions now,\u201d Bob said.\n\u201c2:1 for children under 15, and 1.5:1 for children between 16-21. Anyone older than that can\n1 The \u201cTrolley Problem\u201d and Self-Driving Cars: Your Car\u2019s Moral Settings\nNoah Levin 5 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nfend for themselves,\u201d Hillary stated.\n\u201cYes, of course. You can always change your LVRs, Life Value Ratios, later, and tune them\nexactly to your liking based on whatever traits you choose to specify. There\u2019s even a specific setting for\nex-husbands!\u201d Bob joked. Hillary let out a forced chuckle.\n\u201cSorry, to continue, the system will prioritize the most lives, weighted to your specifications,\nweighing adults inside and outside the vehicle the same, but giving a higher value to children, and\ngiving those in the car the highest values. There is also a setting that will give the occupants in the car\npriority in the event the algorithm results in a tie. Sound good?\u201d Bob explained.\n\u201cYes, that sounds quite good. Does a sunroof come standard?\u201d Hillary inquired. All this safety\ntalk was getting tedious, and she suddenly remembered how much she enjoyed the sunroof on her old\ncar.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What are your thoughts on the \u201cclassic\u201d Trolley Problem? Would you switch the track (to kill the one\nperson) or let it kill the five people?

A Hard Case\nWe begin with a hard case, one which might pull us in different directions.\nBaby Theresa. Theresa is born an anencephalic infant, which means that she will never be conscious,\nthough she may live for several months since she has a functioning brain-stem that controls respiration\nand other life-sustaining processes. Theresa\u2019s parents are understandably devastated. After consulting\nwith Theresa\u2019s doctors, the parents make a decision: they request that Theresa\u2019s healthy organs be\nremoved, thereby killing her, and given to otherwise healthy children who will die if they do not receive\nan organ. The alternative is to donate Theresa\u2019s organs after she dies, but as we wait for nature to take\nits course children will die who could have been saved, and Theresa\u2019s organs will become less viable.2\nWould it be ethically wrong to kill Baby Theresa in order to save the lives of other children?\nHow would we even begin to answer a question like this?\nII. Some False Starts\nWhy not seek an answer to the question by\u2026\nConsulting the law?\nBut there may not be a law that covers the hard case, in which case the law will not offer us any\nguidance. More importantly, however:\nIs the law a reliable guide to right and wrong? Let\u2019s consider: can we think of actions (real or imagined,\ncurrent or historical) that are legal but unethical? Can we think of actions that are illegal but ethical? If\nso \u2013 if legality and ethics can diverge \u2013 then the law probably isn\u2019t a reliable guide to determining the\nright thing to do.\nConducting an opinion poll?\n1 This work released under a CC-BY license.\n2 Drawn from the actual case of Theresa Ann Campo Pearson. For an overview of the ethical issues involved, see\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606434/.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 7 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nBut others may be as torn as we are concerning what to do, in which case an opinion poll won\u2019t offer us\nany guidance. More importantly, however:\nAre opinion polls a reliable guide to right and wrong? Let\u2019s consider: can we think of actions that are\n(or were) popularly approved of but unethical? Can we think of ethical actions that are not popularly\napproved of? If so \u2013 if popular opinion and ethics can diverge \u2013 then opinion polls will not be a reliable\nguide to determining the right thing to do.\nGoing with \u2018gut feelings,\u2019 or the dictates of conscience?\nBut especially when it comes to hard cases, we may not have clear feelings one way or the other\u2014or,\nmore likely still, our feelings might pull us in opposing directions, leading us to draw different\nconclusions about right and wrong. More importantly, however:\nAre \u2018gut feelings\u2019 (or conscience) a reliable guide to right and wrong? Again, let\u2019s apply the same\ndivergence test we applied when considering the first two suggestions: can we think of examples in\nwhich conscience errs, or a person\u2019s gut feelings lead her astray? We might also reasonably wonder\nabout the source of gut feelings or dictates of conscience. Why think that these give us glimpses of\nethical truth, rather than, for example, merely reflecting on assumptions and biases that we have\naccumulated through our upbringing and socialization?\nIII. Ethical Argument\nThere is a better approach to ethical hard cases than any of the false starts canvassed above: we can think\nabout them. We can consider the reasons for and against certain ethical evaluations. We can construct\nand evaluate ethical arguments and see in which direction the weight of reasons tilt.\nYou might not be accustomed to thinking of ethics as a subject we can reason about. After all, many\nethical disagreements seem anything but reasonable: they are often passionately emotional and\nintractable. But this might simply reflect the fact that we are not prone to reason about ethics\nwell. Really, this is not so surprising, since reasoning well about any subject, and certainly a subject as\ncomplex and difficult as ethics, requires considerable experience.\nA first step in learning how to reason well about ethical issues is to learn how ethical arguments work.\nOne standard form of ethical argument seeks to derive particular ethical judgments\u2014for example, the\njudgment that it would be wrong to kill Baby Theresa\u2014from general ethical principles. A general\nethical principle is a statement that says that a certain kind of action is ethical or unethical.\nHere, for example, is a general ethical principle, which we may call the Benefits-Without-Harm\nPrinciple, or\nBWHP: If an action will benefit people, without harming anyone, then it is ethically right.\nBWHP identifies what philosophers call a sufficient condition for ethically right action. If an action\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 8 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nbenefits people without causing any harm, then that\u2019s enough \u2013 it\u2019s sufficient \u2013 to make that action\nethically right, regardless of other features of the action or the circumstances in which the action is\nperformed.\nSuppose we find BWHP intuitively compelling. Does it shed any light on our question about whether\nkilling Baby Theresa would be unethical? It might seem to, for one could appeal to BWHP in making\nthe following ethical argument:\nA1\n1. If an action will benefit people, without harming anyone, then it is ethically right.\n2. Killing Baby Theresa will benefit people, without harming anyone.\n3. Therefore, killing Baby Theresa is ethically right.\nFor the moment, never mind whether this argument is convincing. Rather, try to appreciate how this\nmethod of arriving at ethical judgments differs significantly from the false starts we considered above.\nIV. Evaluating Ethical Arguments\nIn evaluating a simple ethical argument like A1, there are two basic questions we can ask:\nQ1. Is the general principle to which the argument appeals (in this case, BWHP) a plausible one?\nQ2. Is the principle correctly applied to the case under consideration?\nAs for the first question, one common way to assess the plausibility of a general ethical principle is by\nusing what philosophers call the method of counterexample. This involves searching for cases (real or\nimagined) in which the principle gives the intuitively wrong result. Let\u2019s illustrate this method by\ndevising a possible counterexample to our sample principle, BWHP:\nBenefactor. I am a very wealthy man in a small city with two hospitals. One hospital\n(Sunnyvale) serves the very rich and is decked out with all the latest and greatest medical\nequipment and is staffed by the most talented doctors and nurses. The other hospital (City\nGeneral) serves the rest of the city (a majority of the population) and is badly under-equipped,\nunder-staffed, and desperately in need of upgrades and repairs. Despite being aware of the\ndramatic inequality in the relative state of these two hospitals, I donate several million dollars\nto Sunnyvale and give nothing to City General. My reason is that I have been a patient at\nSunnyvale several times in the past and am grateful for the treatment and care I received there.\nHave I acted ethically right? Was giving several million dollars to Sunnyvale the right thing to do?\nBWHP suggests that it was. After all:\nA2\n1. If an action will benefit people, without harming anyone, then it is ethically right.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 9 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n2. Donating the money to Sunnyvale benefits people without harming anyone.\n3. Therefore, donating the money to Sunnyvale is ethically right.\nBut suppose we disagree with the claim that donating the money to Sunnyvale is the ethically right thing\nto do. What I should have done, we might argue, is donate the money to the hospital that needed it\nmost\u2014City General\u2014where it could have done significantly more good. In our estimation then, BWHP\nyields the incorrect verdict in the case of Benefactor, and that\u2019s a reason to doubt its validity.\nOf course, counterexamples in ethics are never conclusive, since one always has the option to \u2018bite the\nbullet\u2019 and take on-board the counterintuitive ethical judgment. For example, a proponent of BWHP\ncould give up the judgment that the money should have been donated to City General (and thereby state\nthat giving it to Sunnyvale was the right thing) instead of giving up on BWHP. In ethics,\ncounterexamples give us a choice: we can modify our principles to fit our ethical judgments, or we can\nmodify our ethical judgments to fit our principles. Unfortunately, there is no algorithm for deciding\nwhen to do which. The best we can do is try to use good judgment and be on guard against various\nforms of bias.\nIn any case, let\u2019s suppose that BWHP passes our tests. Let\u2019s suppose we\u2019ve considered a wide range of\ncases in which an action benefits people without harming anyone, and without exception we are\ndisposed to judge these actions ethically right. When evaluating arguments like A1, there is still work to\nbe done even if we find acceptable the general ethical principle to which the argument appeals. We\nneed to ask whether the principle actually applies to the case under consideration. In evaluating A1, for\nexample, we have to ask whether it is true that killing Baby Theresa would benefit people without\nharming anyone. We may disagree about whether an individual like Baby Theresa is harmed by being\nkilled. In evaluating A2, we might disagree about whether there can be circumstances in which not\nbestowing a gift constitutes a harm, and, if so, whether these circumstances obtain in Benefactor.\nComplex conceptual and empirical issues like these arise all the time when thinking about right and\nwrong and form a large part of the workload in philosophical ethics.\nV. Other Important Argument Forms\nThus far we\u2019ve looked only at ethical arguments in which a particular action is said to conform to a\ngeneral ethical principle. These arguments have the following form or pattern:\n1. General Principle: Actions of type X are ethically right (or ethically wrong).\n2. Particular judgment: This action, a, is an X.\n3. Conclusion: Thus, a is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\nAs you begin to read more widely in philosophical ethics you will notice that there are many different\nargument-forms that philosophers commonly employ. Learning these patterns will improve your\ncomprehension of arguments in ethics and your ability to offer compelling support for your own ethical\nviews. Here we will cover two more forms: arguments from analogy and arguments from inference to\nthe best explanation.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 10 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nArguments from Analogy\n1. X is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\n2. Y is just like X in all ethically relevant respects.\n3. Thus, Y is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\nArguments from analogy are very common and can be very powerful. They derive their persuasive force\nfrom a basic principle of rational consistency stating that we should treat like cases alike.\nA great illustration of this argument-form can be found in the philosopher Peter Singer\u2019s essay \u201cFamine,\nAffluence, and Morality.\u201d In that essay Singer aims to show that people in an affluent society like ours\nhave an ethical obligation to contribute money to charitable organizations working to help the global\npoor. In supporting this claim, Singer asks us to imagine that we are passing by a shallow pond in which\na small child is drowning. Supposing we could save the child at little cost to ourselves, Singer thinks that\n1. Nearly everyone would acknowledge that they have in these circumstances an ethical\nobligation to help the drowning child.\nHe then argues:\n2. There are no ethically relevant differences between the situation of the drowning child and the\nsituation of the global poor.\nAnd so, Singer concludes:\n3. We have an ethical obligation to help the global poor.\nIn evaluating any argument from analogy, Singer\u2019s included, the most important (but not the only)\nquestion to ask is whether it is true that there are no ethically relevant differences between the cases\nbeing compared. After all, if there are ethically relevant differences, these could justify reaching a\ndifferent conclusion about the two cases (there is no principle stating we must treat unlike cases alike).\nAnd indeed this is the issue on which Singer and critics of his now classic essay have focused.\nArguments from Inference to the Best Explanation\n1. X is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\n2. The best explanation for why X is ethically right (or ethically wrong) is captured by a general\nprinciple P.\n3. Thus, we should accept P.\n4. But P implies that Y is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\n5. Thus, Y is ethically right (or ethically wrong).\nAnother common argument-form in ethics, arguments from inference to the best explanation trade on\nthe fact that when we accept an ethical principle we commit ourselves to accepting its implications. A\ngreat illustration of this argument-form can be found in Don Marquis\u2019 essay, \u201cWhy Abortion is\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 11 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nImmoral.\u201d In that essay Marquis argues as follows:\n1. It is wrong to kill a normal, adult human being.\n2. The best explanation for why it is wrong to kill a normal, adult human being is the Deprivation\nPrinciple: it is wrong to deprive an individual of a future-of-value.\n3. Thus, we should accept the Deprivation Principle.\n4. But the Deprivation Principle implies that abortion is wrong, since abortions deprive individuals\n(the fetuses) of a future-of-value.\n5. Thus, abortion is wrong.\nIn evaluating arguments from inference to the best explanation, Marquis\u2019 included, the most important\n(but not the only) question to ask is whether the proffered explanation for the initial ethical judgment\nreally is best. Perhaps there is an alternative principle that explains the initial judgment just as well or\nbetter, and which doesn\u2019t imply what the proffered principle implies. And indeed this is the issue on\nwhich Marquis and his critics have focused.\nVI. Ethical Theories\nWe\u2019ve seen that ethical arguments often appeal to general ethical principles, and that one way we might\ntry to justify such principles is by showing that they fit well with our ethical judgments about an\n(ideally) wide range of cases. There is another way we might try to justify ethical principles. We might\ndevelop and defend an ethical theory, or an account of what, ultimately, ethical value consists in. With\nan account of ethical value in hand we can proceed to derive general principles to guide ethical\nevaluation and ethical decision-making.\nPhilosophers have developed many important ethical theories, but three in particular are generally\nregarded as being especially significant, perhaps because many other ethical theories can be regarded as\nbeing more or less direct descendants of them. These are utilitarianism, Kantianism, and virtue\nethics. Obviously we cannot hope to do justice to the richness and subtlety of these theories in a short\nchapter like this, but we can offer rough sketches of their way of understanding ethical value and the\nprinciples that flow from this understanding.\nUtilitarianism\nThe great 18 -century English ethical theorist John Stuart Mill thought that\nth\nthere ought to be some one fundamental principle or law, at the root of all morality, or if\nthere be several, there should be a determinate order of precedence among them; and the\none principle, or the rule for deciding between the various principles when they conflict,\nought to be self-evident\u2026.\nMill thought he had found that one fundamental principle or law. He called it the Greatest Happiness\nPrinciple: \u201c[A]ctions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to\nproduce the reverse of happiness.\u201d For Mill, nothing could be more self-evidently true than the claims\nthat (i) happiness is the greatest good, (ii) more of it is always better than less, and hence that (iii) the\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 12 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nethically good person will concern herself always and above all else with maximizing happiness\u2014not\nsimply her own, of course, \u201cbut that of all concerned.\u201d Mill\u2019s Greatest Happiness Principle figures in\ncountless ethical arguments, having the form:\n1. Actions are ethically right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to\nproduce the reverse of happiness.\n2. This action (to some extent) promotes happiness.\n3. Thus, this action is (to that extent) ethically right.\nNow knowing how to evaluate general ethical principles, what do we think of Mill\u2019s Greatest Happiness\nPrinciple? Can we think of counterexamples to Mill\u2019s principle?\nKantianism\nPhilosophy is funny, inasmuch as what is self-evidently true to one philosopher is sometimes equally\nself-evidently false to another. The 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant would have agreed\nwith Mill that all of ethics is rooted in a single, fundamental principle, but Kant didn\u2019t think this\nprinciple had anything to do with promoting happiness. The problem with happiness, argued Kant, is\nthat it is only a conditional good: whether it is good in any particular case depends on the circumstances\nof that case. For example, the happiness experienced by the sadist through his acts of cruelty hardly\nseems good, and indeed may seem bad: it would be better if the sadist derived no happiness at all from\nhis sadistic behavior. Kant thought that since happiness is not unconditionally good, promoting\nhappiness cannot be unconditionally right, and thus that we must look elsewhere for the \u2018fundamental\nprinciple or law.\u2019\nKant thought that he had discovered this fundamental law of ethics in his Categorical Imperative: \u201cAct\nonly in accordance with the maxim through which one can at the same time will that it become a\nuniversal law.\u201d Kant\u2019s idea, roughly, is that all of our ethical obligations are rooted in one basic\ncommand\u2014viz., to treat as a reason for action in our own case only features of our circumstances that\nwe would treat as a reason for action for everyone. By committing ourselves to acting only on\n\u2018universalizable maxims\u2019 (as Kant called them) we show respect for the dignity of other rational persons\nand their status as \u201cends-in-themselves,\u201d rather than as mere things to be used or manipulated for our\nown purposes. Kant\u2019s ethics has been profoundly influential; it represents one of the two major pillars of\nWestern philosophical ethics, alongside Mill\u2019s utilitarianism. It has influenced important contemporary\nethicists like John Rawls and Thomas Scanlon, both of whom develop Kantian theories in which ethics\nis fundamentally about acting in ways that others could not reasonably reject.\nA Kantian argument in ethics might look like this:\n1. Actions are ethically right if and only if, in acting, the person acts on a universalizable maxim.\n2. In doing X, person p acts (or does not act) on a universalizable maxim.\n3. Thus, in doing X, person p does (or does not) do what is ethically right.\nFaced with arguments like these we may raise the same question we put to arguments appealing to\nMill\u2019s Greatest Happiness Principle--viz., are we obliged to accept the principle expressed in (1)? Can\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 13 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwe think of a counterexample to this claim?\nVirtue-Ethics\nThe theories of Mill and Kant anchor all of ethics in a single principle. For theorists like Mill and Kant,\nother important ethical concepts\u2014like that of an ethically good person, for example\u2014will be derived\nfrom the account of the fundamental ethical principle(s). For any particular ethical theory focused on\nprinciples in this way, the ethically good person will simply be the person who regulates her conduct in\naccordance with the relevant principle(s). An important contrasting approach is found in virtue ethics,\nwhich has its roots in the Ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, but which can take on many forms. For\nthe virtue ethicist, ethical theory should focus first and foremost on developing a conception of the good\nperson. With such a conception in hand, a principle for distinguishing right from wrong naturally\nsuggests itself: do what the good person would do, and refrain from doing what the good person would\nnot do! The virtue ethicist\u2019s project is to give content to this principle\u2014to give, that is, an account of\nthe virtues, or the character traits, that define the good person. Most virtue ethicists think that we\nalready have a good, if incomplete, understanding of these character traits. They are just the traditional\nvirtues like honesty, compassion, generosity, courage, fairness, and the like.\nVirtue-based arguments in ethics may look something like this:\n1. You should do what the virtuous person would do.\n2. In these circumstances, a virtuous person would X.\n3. Thus, in these circumstances, you should X.\nPresented with these competing ethical theories one may naturally wonder how one is supposed to\nadjudicate between them. That\u2019s a complicated issue that we won\u2019t address. Here we\u2019ll just point out\nthat it is possible to be ecumenical with respect to the major ethical theories in the Western\nphilosophical tradition, and to see each as drawing our attention to different but equally salient aspects\nof ethical value. Even then, if we ultimately resist a theory\u2019s claim to have fully explained the nature of\nright and wrong, we may find it useful for directing our attention to right-making (and wrong-making)\nfeatures of the world and furnishing us with principles to use in ethical evaluation and decision-\nmaking.\nVII. Meta-Ethics\nThere remains one final stop on this whirlwind tour of philosophical ethics. We have been proceeding\nas if the idea of ethics, or right and wrong, is itself uncomplicated, and that all the work happens when\nwe start trying to figure out what\u2019s right and wrong. But this is misleading. There is a major branch of\nphilosophical ethics devoted to questions about whether ethics as we ordinarily think and talk about it is\neven possible or coherent.\nThis is the area called meta-ethics, since its questions are not really about right and wrong per se, but\nrather about what exactly we are doing when we think and talk about right and wrong. For example, a\ncentral question in meta-ethics is whether ethical assertions are objective or subjective.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 14 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nTo say that ethical assertions are objective is to say that they purport to state facts, and hence that they\ncan be true or false depending on whether they state the facts accurately or inaccurately. To say that\nethical assertions are subjective is to say that they do not purport to state facts, but rather that they do\nsomething else\u2014for example, they express the speaker\u2019s feelings, emotions, or tastes, or perhaps they\nare just a way in which we exhort each other to act in one way and refrain from acting in others. Since\nthings like feelings and exhortations cannot be true or false, ethical assertions, claims the subjectivist,\ncannot be true or false.\nThese are profoundly different ways of characterizing ethical assertions with obvious implications for\nethical thought and practice. For example, if the subjectivists are right, it is unclear what ethical\ndisagreements are about, or what we are doing when we engage in ethical debate and give reasoned\narguments in support of our ethical views. If, on the other hand, the objectivists are right, then the\npretensions of ordinary ethical thought and talk may be preserved, but we may justifiably demand from\nthe objectivist an explanation of how ethical facts fit within the natural world and how we are able to\naccess these facts. These are the kinds of issues on which meta-ethicists focus.\nVIII. Conclusion\nEthics is a fascinating area of philosophy with clear practical relevance. This chapter has barely\nscratched the surface, but will hopefully have given you enough background to dive in to the great\nworks of historical and contemporary ethics without feeling lost or overwhelmed.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Make a list of unethical actions that have been legally permitted somewhere, at some point in human\nhistory.\n2. Here\u2019s an activity for identifying general ethical principles that you already accept.3 Draw a table\nwith three columns. In the first column, list actions that you believe are ethically right, meaning either\nthat you believe the actions are ones we must always perform or that you believe the actions are ones we\nmay, but do not have to, perform. In the second column, list actions that you believe are ethically\nwrong, meaning that you believe the actions are ones we may not perform. In the third column, you will\nlist actions that you are unsure about; you haven\u2019t yet made up your mind whether these actions belong\nin the first or second column. Take your time and give it some thought. You should aim for 8+ actions\nin each column.\nOnce you\u2019ve filled in your table, consider the actions listed in the first and second column. Ask\nyourself whether there is some criterion that you have been implicitly applying, a criterion that is\nguiding your decisions about whether a particular action belongs in the class of ethically rights actions\nor rather in the class of ethically wrong actions. In an effort to identify the implicit criterion you might\nask yourself whether there is something about the ethically right actions, a property they all share in\ncommon, by virtue of which they count as ethically right, and whether there is something about the\nethically wrong actions, a property they share in common, by virtue of which they count as ethically\n3 To my knowledge, this activity was originally devised by Nathan Nobis.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 15 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwrong.\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the general ethical principle underlying your intuitive ethical judgments,\nlook again at the actions lists in column 3. Does your principle imply anything determinate about these\nactions?\n3. Construct an ethical argument using the general ethical principle that you identified in the activity\ndescribed in Exercise 2.\n2 What is Ethics and What Makes Something a Problem for Morality?\nDavid Svolba 16 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n3\nLetter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr.1\nBirmingham City Jail\nApril 16, 1963\nMy dear Fellow Clergymen,\nWhile confined here in the Birmingham City Jail, I came across your recent statement calling our\npresent activities \"unwise and untimely.\" Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and\nideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would be engaged in\nlittle else in the course of the day and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that\nyou are men of genuine goodwill and your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I would like to answer your\nstatement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\nI think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the\nargument of \"outsiders coming in.\" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian\nLeadership Conference, an organization operating in every Southern state with headquarters in Atlanta,\nGeorgia. We have some eighty-five affiliate organizations all across the South -- one being the Alabama\nChristian Movement for Human Rights. Whenever necessary and possible we share staff, educational,\nand financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago our local affiliate here in Birmingham\ninvited us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary.\nWe readily consented and when the hour came we lived up to our promises. So I am here, along with\nseveral members of my staff, because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic\norganizational ties here. Beyond this, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth\ncentury prophets left their little villages and carried their \"thus saith the Lord\" far beyond the boundaries\nof their home town, and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of\nJesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Graeco-Roman world, I too am compelled to\ncarry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to\nthe Macedonian call for aid.\nMoreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in\nAtlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to\njustice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of\ndestiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the\nnarrow, provincial \"outside agitator\" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be\nconsidered an outsider anywhere in this country.\n1 King, M.L., Jr. (1963). Letter from The Birmingham City Jail. This version, originally released without copyright in 1963\nand disseminated widely, is assumed to be in the Public Domain.\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 17 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nYou deplore the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. But I am sorry that your\nstatement did not express a similar concern for the conditions that brought the demonstrations into\nbeing. I am sure that each of you would want to go beyond the superficial social analyst who looks\nmerely at effects, and does not grapple with underlying causes. I would not hesitate to say that it is\nunfortunate that so-called demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham at this time, but I would say in\nmore emphatic terms that it is even more unfortunate that the white power structure of this city left the\nNegro community with no other alternative.\nIn any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: (1) Collection of the facts to determine whether\ninjustices are alive; (2) Negotiation; (3) Self-purification; and (4) Direct action. We have gone through\nall of these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying of the fact that racial injustice engulfs this\ncommunity. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly\nrecord of police brutality is known in every section of this country. Its unjust treatment of Negroes in the\ncourts is a notorious reality. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in\nBirmingham than any city in this nation. These are the hard, brutal, and unbelievable facts. On the basis\nof these conditions Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the political leaders\nconsistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.\nThen came the opportunity last September to talk with some of the leaders of the economic community.\nIn these negotiating sessions certain promises were made by the merchants -- such as the promise to\nremove the humiliating racial signs from the stores. On the basis of these promises Rev. Shuttlesworth\nand the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to call a moratorium on\nany type of demonstrations. As the weeks and months unfolded we realized that we were the victims of\na broken promise. The signs remained. As in so many experiences of the past we were confronted with\nblasted hopes, and the dark shadow of a deep disappointment settled upon us. So we had no alternative\nexcept that of preparing for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of\nlaying our case before the conscience of the local and national community. We were not unmindful of\nthe difficulties involved. So we decided to go through a process of self-purification. We started having\nworkshops on nonviolence and repeatedly asked ourselves the questions, \"Are you able to accept blows\nwithout retaliating?\" \"Are you able to endure the ordeals of jail?\"\nWe decided to set our direct-action program around the Easter season, realizing that with the exception\nof Christmas, this was the largest shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic\nwithdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this was the best time to bring\npressure on the merchants for the needed changes. Then it occurred to us that the March election was\nahead, and so we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that\nMr. Connor was in the run-off, we decided again to postpone action so that the demonstrations could not\nbe used to cloud the issues. At this time we agreed to begin our nonviolent witness the day after the run-\noff.\nThis reveals that we did not move irresponsibly into direct action. We too wanted to see Mr. Connor\ndefeated; so we went through postponement after postponement to aid in this community need. After\nthis we felt that direct action could be delayed no longer.\nYou may well ask, Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches, etc.? Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 18 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nare exactly right in your call for negotiation. Indeed, this is the purpose of direct action. Nonviolent\ndirect action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has\nconstantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it\ncan no longer be ignored. I just referred to the creation of tension as a part of the work of the nonviolent\nresister. This may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word tension. I\nhave earnestly worked and preached against violent tension, but there is a type of constructive\nnonviolent tension that is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a\ntension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the\nunfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must see the need of having nonviolent\ngadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice\nand racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. So the purpose of the direct action\nis to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. We, therefore,\nconcur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in\nthe tragic attempt to live in monologue rather than dialogue.\nOne of the basic points in your statement is that our acts are untimely. Some have asked, \"Why didn't\nyou give the new administration time to act?\" The only answer that I can give to this inquiry is that the\nnew administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it acts. We will be sadly\nmistaken if we feel that the election of Mr. Boutwell will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While\nMr. Boutwell is much more articulate and gentle than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists\ndedicated to the task of maintaining the status quo. The hope I see in Mr. Boutwell is that he will be\nreasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this\nwithout pressure from the devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a\nsingle gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. History is the long and\ntragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals\nmay see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but as Reinhold Niebuhr has\nreminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals.\nWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must\nbe demanded by the oppressed. Frankly I have never yet engaged in a direct action movement that was\n\"well timed,\" according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of\nsegregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with a\npiercing familiarity. This \"wait\" has almost always meant \"never.\" It has been a tranquilizing\nthalidomide, relieving the emotional stress for a moment, only to give birth to an ill-formed infant of\nfrustration. We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday that \"justice too long delayed\nis justice denied.\" We have waited for more than three hundred and forty years for our constitutional and\nGod-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet-like speed toward the goal of\npolitical independence, and we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward the gaining of a cup of coffee\nat a lunch counter.\nI guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say wait. But when\nyou have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers\nat whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize, and even kill your black\nbrothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro\nbrothers smothering in an air-tight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 19 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nsuddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-\nold daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television,\nand see tears welling up in her little eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children,\nand see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to\ndistort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you\nhave to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking in agonizing pathos: \"Daddy, why do white\npeople treat colored people so mean?\"; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to\nsleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept\nyou; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \"white\" men and \"colored\";\nwhen your first name becomes \"nigger\" and your middle name becomes \"boy\" (however old you are)\nand your last name becomes \"John,\" and when your wife and mother are never given the respected title\n\"Mrs.\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living\nconstantly at tip-toe stance never quite knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and\nouter resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \"nobodiness\" -- then you will\nunderstand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over,\nand men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the\nbleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable\nimpatience.\nYou express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate\nconcern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing\nsegregation in the public schools, it is rather strange and paradoxical to find us consciously breaking\nlaws. One may well ask: \"How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\" The answer\nis found in the fact that there are two types of laws: There are just laws and there are unjust laws. I\nwould be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but moral responsibility to\nobey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with\nSaint Augustine that \"An unjust law is no law at all.\"\nNow what is the difference between the two? How does one determine when a law is just or unjust? A\njust law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code\nthat is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of Saint Thomas Aquinas, an unjust law\nis a human law that is not rooted in eternal and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is\njust. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because\nsegregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of\nsuperiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. To use the words of Martin Buber, the great\nJewish philosopher, segregation substitutes an \"I-it\" relationship for an \"I-thou\" relationship, and ends\nup relegating persons to the status of things. So segregation is not only politically, economically, and\nsociologically unsound, but it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation.\nIsn't segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, an expression of his awful\nestrangement, his terrible sinfulness? So I can urge men to obey the1954 decision of the Supreme Court\nbecause it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances because they are\nmorally wrong.\nLet us turn to a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a majority\ninflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand a just\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 20 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nlaw is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow that it is willing to follow itself. This is\nsameness made legal.\nLet me give another explanation. An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority\nhad no part in enacting or creating because they did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say\nthat the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected?\nThroughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from\nbecoming registered voters and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote despite\nthe fact that the Negro constitutes a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be\nconsidered democratically structured?\nThese are just a few examples of unjust and just laws. There are some instances when a law is just on its\nface but unjust in its application. For instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a\npermit. Now there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when\nthe ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of\npeaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust.\nI hope you can see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying\nthe law as the rabid segregationist would do. This would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law\nmust do it openly, lovingly (not hatefully as the white mothers did in New Orleans when they were seen\non television screaming \"nigger, nigger, nigger\") and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit\nthat an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and willingly accepts the penalty\nby staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the\nvery highest respect for law.\nOf course there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was seen sublimely in the refusal\nof Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar because a higher moral law\nwas involved. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians who were willing to face hungry lions\nand the excruciating pain of chopping blocks, before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman\nEmpire. To a degree academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.\nWe can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was \"legal\" and everything the Hungarian\nfreedom fighters did in Hungary was \"illegal.\" It was \"illegal\" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's\nGermany. But I am sure that, if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and\ncomforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal. If I lived in a communist country today where\ncertain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate\ndisobeying these anti-religious laws.\nI must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that\nover the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached\nthe regrettable conclusion that the Negroes' great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the\nWhite Citizen's \"Counciler\" or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to\n\"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace\nwhich is the presence of justice; who constantly says \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't\nagree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 21 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nanother man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait\nuntil a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating\nthan absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering\nthan outright rejection.\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of\nestablishing justice, and that when they fail to do this they become dangerously structured dams that\nblock the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present\ntension in the South is merely a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace,\nwhere the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substance-filled positive peace, where all men\nwill respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct\naction are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already\nalive. We bring it out in the open where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured\nas long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its pus-flowing ugliness to the natural medicines\nof air and light, injustice must likewise be exposed, with all of the tension its exposing creates, to the\nlight of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\nIn your statement you asserted that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they\nprecipitate violence. But can this assertion be logically made? Isn't this like condemning the robbed man\nbecause his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates\nbecause his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical delvings precipitated the misguided\npopular mind to make him drink the hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because His unique God\nconsciousness and never-ceasing devotion to His will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must\ncome to see, as federal courts have consistently affirmed, that it is immoral to urge an individual to\nwithdraw his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest precipitates violence.\nSociety must protect the robbed and punish the robber.\nI had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth of time. I received a letter this morning\nfrom a white brother in Texas which said: \"All Christians know that the colored people will receive\nequal rights eventually, but is it possible that you are in too great of a religious hurry? It has taken\nChristianity almost 2,000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to\nearth.\" All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational\nnotion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually time is\nneutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill\nwill have used time much more effectively than the people of good will. We will have to repent in this\ngeneration not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence\nof the good people. We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It\ncomes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be co-workers with God, and\nwithout this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.\nWe must use time creatively, and forever realize that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time\nto make real the promise of democracy, and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm\nof brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the\nsolid rock of human dignity.\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 22 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nYou spoke of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow\nclergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of the extremist. I started thinking about the fact\nthat I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of\ncomplacency made up of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, have been so completely\ndrained of self-respect and a sense of \"somebodiness\" that they have adjusted to segregation, and of a\nfew Negroes in the middle class who, because of a degree of academic and economic security, and\nbecause at points they profit by segregation, have unconsciously become insensitive to the problems of\nthe masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred and comes perilously close to advocating\nviolence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up over the nation, the\nlargest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement. This movement is nourished by\nthe contemporary frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination. It is made up of\npeople who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have\nconcluded that the white man is an incurable \"devil.\" I have tried to stand between these two forces\nsaying that we need not follow the \"do-nothingism\" of the complacent or the hatred and despair of the\nblack nationalist. There is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I'm grateful to God\nthat, through the Negro church, the dimension of nonviolence entered our struggle. If this philosophy\nhad not emerged I am convinced that by now many streets of the South would be flowing with floods of\nblood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss us as \"rabble rousers\" and \"outside\nagitators\" -- those of us who are working through the channels of nonviolent direct action -- and refuse\nto support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes, out of frustration and despair, will seek solace\nand security in black-nationalist ideologies, a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening\nracial nightmare.\nOppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The urge for freedom will eventually come. This is\nwhat has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of\nfreedom; something without has reminded him that he can gain it. Consciously and unconsciously, he\nhas been swept in by what the Germans call the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa, and his\nbrown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, he is moving with a sense of\ncosmic urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. Recognizing this vital urge that has engulfed\nthe Negro community, one should readily understand public demonstrations. The Negro has many pent-\nup resentments and latent frustrations. He has to get them out. So let him march sometime; let him have\nhis prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; understand why he must have sit-ins and freedom rides. If his\nrepressed emotions do not come out in these nonviolent ways, they will come out in ominous\nexpressions of violence. This is not a threat; it is a fact of history. So I have not said to my people, \"Get\nrid of your discontent.\" But I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled\nthrough the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. Now this approach is being dismissed as\nextremist. I must admit that I was initially disappointed in being so categorized.\nBut as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being\nconsidered an extremist. Was not Jesus an extremist in love? \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse\nyou, pray for them that despitefully use you.\" Was not Amos an extremist for justice -- \"Let justice roll\ndown like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\" Was not Paul an extremist for the gospel of\nJesus Christ -- \"I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\" Was not Martin Luther an extremist --\n\"Here I stand; I can do none other so help me God.\" Was not John Bunyan an extremist -- \"I will stay in\njail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.\" Was not Abraham Lincoln an\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 23 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nextremist -- \"This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.\" Was not Thomas Jefferson an\nextremist -- \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\" So the question is\nnot whether we will be extremist but what kind of extremist will we be. Will we be extremists for hate\nor will we be extremists for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice -- or will we be\nextremists for the cause of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We\nmust never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime -- the crime of extremism. Two were\nextremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an\nextremist for love, truth, and goodness, and thereby rose above His environment. So, after all, maybe the\nSouth, the nation, and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.\nI had hoped that the white moderate would see this. Maybe I was too optimistic. Maybe I expected too\nmuch. I guess I should have realized that few members of a race that has oppressed another race can\nunderstand or appreciate the deep groans and passionate yearnings of those that have been oppressed,\nand still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent, and\ndetermined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers have grasped the meaning of\nthis social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too small in quantity, but they are\nbig in quality. Some like Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, and James Dabbs have written\nabout our struggle in eloquent, prophetic, and understanding terms. Others have marched with us down\nnameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse\nand brutality of angry policemen who see them as \"dirty nigger lovers.\" They, unlike so many of their\nmoderate brothers and sisters, have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for\npowerful \"action\" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.\nLet me rush on to mention my other disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white\nChurch and its leadership. Of course there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact\nthat each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Rev. Stallings, for your\nChristian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a non-segregated\nbasis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\nBut despite these notable exceptions I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the\nChurch. I do not say that as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the\nChurch. I say it as a minister of the gospel, who loves the Church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who\nhas been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall\nlengthen.\nI had the strange feeling when I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in\nMontgomery several years ago that we would have the support of the white Church. I felt that the white\nministers, priests, and rabbis of the South would be some of our strongest allies. Instead, some have\nbeen outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders;\nall too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the\nanesthetizing security of the stained glass windows.\nIn spite of my shattered dreams of the past, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious\nleadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and with deep moral concern, serve as\nthe channel through which our just grievances could get to the power structure. I had hoped that each of\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 24 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nyou would understand. But again I have been disappointed.\nI have heard numerous religious leaders of the South call upon their worshippers to comply with a\ndesegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers say follow this\ndecree because integration is morally right and the Negro is your brother. In the midst of blatant\ninjustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churches stand on the sideline and merely\nmouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our\nnation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard so many ministers say, \"Those are social issues\nwith which the gospel has no real concern,\" and I have watched so many churches commit themselves to\na completely other-worldly religion which made a strange distinction between body and soul, the sacred\nand the secular.\nSo here we are moving toward the exit of the twentieth century with a religious community largely\nadjusted to the status quo, standing as a tail-light behind other community agencies rather than a\nheadlight leading men to higher levels of justice.\nI have travelled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On\nsweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at her beautiful churches with their\nspires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlay of her massive religious education\nbuildings. Over and over again I have found myself asking: \"Who worships here? Who is their God?\nWhere were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and\nnullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave the clarion call for defiance and hatred?\nWhere were their voices of support when tired, bruised, and weary Negro men and women decided to\nrise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?\"\nYes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment, I have wept over the laxity of the\nchurch. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment\nwhere there is not deep love. Yes, I love the Church; I love her sacred walls. How could I do otherwise?\nI am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson, and the great-grandson of preachers.\nYes, I see the Church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body\nthrough social neglect and fear of being nonconformist.\nThere was a time when the Church was very powerful. It was during that period when the early\nChristians rejoiced when they were deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the\nChurch was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a\nthermostat that transformed the mores of society. Wherever the early Christians entered a town the\npower structure got disturbed and immediately sought to convict them for being \"disturbers of the\npeace\" and \"outside agitators.\" But they went on with the conviction that they were \"a colony of heaven\"\nand had to obey God rather than man. They were small in number but big in commitment. They were\ntoo God-intoxicated to be \"astronomically intimidated.\" They brought an end to such ancient evils as\ninfanticide and gladiatorial contest.\nThings are different now. The contemporary Church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an\nuncertain sound. It is so often the arch-supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the\npresence of the Church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the Church's silent\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 25 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nand often vocal sanction of things as they are.\nBut the judgment of God is upon the Church as never before. If the Church of today does not recapture\nthe sacrificial spirit of the early Church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and\nbe dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. I am meeting young\npeople every day whose disappointment with the Church has risen to outright disgust.\nMaybe again I have been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to\nsave our nation and the world? Maybe I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual Church, the church\nwithin the Church, as the true ecclesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful to God that\nsome noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of\nconformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure\ncongregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone through the highways\nof the South on torturous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been kicked\nout of their churches and lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have gone with\nthe faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. These men have been the leaven in the lump\nof the race. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the Gospel in\nthese troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.\nI hope the Church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the Church does\nnot come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our\nstruggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are presently misunderstood. We will reach the goal of\nfreedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and\nscorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with the destiny of America. Before the pilgrims\nlanded at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched across the pages of history the\nmajestic words of the Declaration of Independence, we were here. For more than two centuries our\nforeparents labored in this country without wages; they made cotton \"king\"; and they built the homes of\ntheir masters in the midst of brutal injustice and shameful humiliation -- and yet out of a bottomless\nvitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us,\nthe opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our\nnation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.\nI must close now. But before closing I am impelled to mention one other point in your statement that\ntroubled me profoundly. You warmly commend the Birmingham police force for keeping \"order\" and\n\"preventing violence.\" I don't believe you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had\nseen its angry violent dogs literally biting six unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I don't believe you would so\nquickly commend the policemen if you would observe their ugly and inhuman treatment of Negroes\nhere in the city jail; if you would watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls;\nif you would see them slap and kick old Negro men and young Negro boys; if you will observe them, as\nthey did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I'm\nsorry that I can't join you in your praise for the police department.\nIt is true that they have been rather disciplined in their public handling of the demonstrators. In this\nsense they have been rather publicly \"nonviolent.\" But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of\nsegregation. Over the last few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands the means\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 26 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwe use must be as pure as the ends we seek. So I have tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use\nimmoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong or even more so to\nuse moral means to preserve immoral ends. Maybe Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather\npublicly nonviolent, as Chief Pritchett was in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of\nnonviolence to maintain the immoral end of flagrant injustice. T. S. Eliot has said that there is no greater\ntreason than to do the right deed for the wrong reason.\nI wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime\ncourage, their willingness to suffer, and their amazing discipline in the midst of the most inhuman\nprovocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths,\ncourageously and with a majestic sense of purpose, facing jeering and hostile mobs and the agonizing\nloneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women,\nsymbolized in a seventy-two year old woman of Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of\ndignity and with her people decided not to ride the segregated buses, and responded to one who inquired\nabout her tiredness with ungrammatical profundity: \"My feets is tired, but my soul is rested.\" They will\nbe the young high school and college students, young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders\ncourageously and nonviolently sitting-in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience\nsake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch\ncounters they were in reality standing up for the best in the American dream and the most sacred values\nin our Judaeo-Christian heritage, and thus carrying our whole nation back to great wells of democracy\nwhich were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration\nof Independence.\nNever before have I written a letter this long (or should I say a book?). I'm afraid it is much too long to\ntake your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing\nfrom a comfortable desk, but what else is there to do when you are alone for days in the dull monotony\nof a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think strange thoughts, and pray long prayers?\nIf I have said anything in this letter that is an overstatement of the truth and is indicative of an\nunreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything in this letter that is an\nunderstatement of the truth and is indicative of my having a patience that makes me patient with\nanything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.\nI hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible\nfor me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader, but as a fellow clergyman and\na Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the\ndeep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities and in some not too\ndistant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their\nscintillating beauty.\nYours for the cause of\nPeace and Brotherhood,\nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 27 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

Martin Luther King, Jr., famously said \u201cthe ends we\nuse must be as pure as the ends we seek,\u201d but another civil rights leader, Malcolm X, embraced the view\n(for at least a portion of his life) that violence might become necessary to force change. What are your\nthoughts on this?\n3. Have you ever been involved in a protest? If so, for what and why? If not, what would you be willing\nto protest?\n3 Letter from the Birmingham City Jail\nMartin Luther King, Jr. 28 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n4\nA Defense of Affirmative Action\nNoah Levin1\nCertain groups are overrepresented in both faculty and student positions in academic institutions\nas a whole. The faculty, staff, and students at any institution rarely, if ever, have the same proportions\nthat would be expected or desired to properly represent the population that the institution is supposed to\nserve. In other words, the faculty lacks the same diversity the students have, and often the students lack\nthe same diversity the institution should expect. For example, Jewish males (of which I am a part)\nappear in faculty positions at a much higher rate than they do in the regular population (and win Nobel\nprizes at a much higher rate, too). I won\u2019t get entirely into the reasons for why this might be the case,\nand when a minority group is over-represented in a positive situation (like employment, not\nincarceration), it is not usually of concern. Despite what some people might want to think, I am not in\nmy current academic position due to some worldwide conspiracy group planting Jews in community\ncolleges teaching throngs of people how to think for themselves. I cannot, however, deny that I was\nlucky enough to be born in a position, place, and to parents that allowed me the luxury of arriving at this\nposition (with much college debt still to be paid). There are those born with much, much less than I had\n(and also those born with much, much more), and it was no choice of their own that resulted in a life that\ndid not afford them the same educational and social opportunities I had. As a result, they might not have\nthe scores, education, background, or knowledge of how the system works to get into the college or\nuniversity of their choice, or perhaps even any college at all. Their potential, hunger, and interest for\nsuccess, however, could certainly be enough to excel at many schools. But because of something outside\nof their control, they were not up to the \u201cstandards\u201d the schools were looking for and would not be given\nthat chance. When we assess the situation, it turns out there is a very strong correlation between these\ntypes of students and race (but there are also correlations between income level, school districts, family\nhistory, etc.). To put it more bluntly and directly: because of their race, many capable students are\ndenied admission and not allowed a chance to succeed at a particular school that should serve them. But\nshould these students be given a chance? And, if so, how could a system that ensures they get a fair\nchance work?\nI maintain that it is appropriate to implement affirmative action protocols when certain\nconditions and restrictions are met. A fair system can even mean that the students who benefit from\nthese policies can fail at a higher rate than their counterparts, but this doesn\u2019t lessen the moral obligation\nto provide them with a chance to succeed. While I will focus this analysis on academics and education,\nthis situation can be true in any number of areas, like college and university faculty, or in employment,\nas infamously occurred in the Alabama State Troopers in the 1960\u2019s where black troopers were\nsystematically denied promotions through a flawed advancement system.\nUnderlying my defense of affirmative action is the desire for a system that is fair and just. It is\nmorally unacceptable to have systems that fail to provide disadvantaged students a fair chance at\nopportunities where majority individuals are thereby given an advantage simply because of their\n1 Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College.

Fairness with regard to punishment can provide a helpful analogy in appreciating what a\njust system of student admission into colleges and universities can look like. It is equally unjust to give\npeople lighter punishments than they deserve as it is to give them harsher punishments. The whole idea\nof a punishment is that it is fitting and what is deserved. In both cases (of light and harsh punishments),\npeople get something other than what they deserve, and we might react similarly to such situations.\nWhen a rapist gets off with no prison time and a battered prostitute gets 25 years for defending herself\nagainst her abuser, we can, and should, act equally disgusted if both punishments are unjust because\nthey are unjust. Fairness demands that people get what they deserve, and, in the situations that\naffirmative action is meant to correct, people are being treated unfairly and receiving a drawback (or a\nbenefit for those that stand to gain from having no corrective policies) for something that is no fault of\ntheir own and thus do not deserve.\nFairness is an extremely complicated concept as multiple elements must always been considered\nalongside each other and somehow made commensurable (that is, we can find a way of comparing the\ntwo \u2013 like how we can compare apples and oranges if we judge them based on sweetness). A policy that\nskews fairness in favor of one candidate almost invariably results in another candidate being treated\nunfairly. It is certain that many candidates that get rejected can claim legitimately they were treated\nunfairly, so we must seek a balance that errs on the side of fairness for the greater good. This is an\nexplicitly consequentialist approach, but I know no other way of resolving the issues. If we wanted to\nfocus on other concepts, like those of desert or a Kantian notion of respect, then we are left with the\nsame problem we began with: how will we properly compare the types of desert (the noun of \u201cdeserve,\u201d\nthe word used in \u201cjust deserts\u201d which means people get what they deserve) in the analysis and how do\nwe properly respect an individual holistically and compare their respect to others? A system that\nmaximizes fairness is the best we can do. And affirmative action is merely ensuring that a fair system,\nall things considered, is implemented when choosing between applicants with diverse backgrounds.\nThere is a famous image of three children of varying heights trying to watch a baseball game\nover a wooden fence. One is much taller than the fence, one can barely look over it, and one is too short\nto see over it. They all want to watch the game and we are in a position to help them achieve this, so the\nquestion is, how do we help? One response is that we ought to treat them all equally. This would mean\ngiving them each the same boost, so we give each of them a single box to stand on. The taller one gets a\nbetter view, the middle-sized one gets a better view, and the shortest one still can\u2019t see over the fence.\nThis clearly isn\u2019t what we wanted, as we want to try to obtain a fair result where each of them can see\nthe game in the same way. In other words, we want equitable treatment. So what\u2019s the next picture in\nthis story? The tallest child gets nothing, the middle child gets one box, and the smallest child gets two\nboxes, making all of their heads the same height, getting the same experience of the game. Is this what\nwe want? Or should there be a requirement that you be \u201ctall enough\u201d to be able to enjoy a baseball\ngame?\nShould we just tell the shortest child to \u201cgrow taller\u201d? Or ask the taller one to \u201ckneel down\u201d? It\nis, after all, not their faults that they are the heights they are, and I don\u2019t want to hold this against them.\nThere is one more option, however: remove the fence or replace it with a chain-link fence. This would\nbe ideal, where each person is given fair access to watch the game without any real or perceived barriers\nunique to them because of their background. In this case, the systemic barrier is removed, inequity is\naddressed, and all participants are treated equally. This is the goalpost: if the world worked in this way,\nthere would be no need for affirmative action. But there are barriers set up that prevent people from\nachieving things simply because of who they are. We are in a position to fix this inequity in many\nsituations, and we ought to do so.\n4 A Defense of Affirmative Action\nNoah Levin 30 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThe systemic inequalities that can result in the need for affirmative action policies are captured\nby two Latin phrases used in both legal and philosophical discussions: de dicto and de facto. It is\nimportant to remember that in both of these circumstances discrimination occurs. De dicto means \u201cfrom\nthe word\u201d and captures situations where discrimination is written into the law or policies. For example,\nlaws of segregation (that persisted in many countries, particularly the United States and South Africa)\nare de dicto because they explicitly state that certain individuals are not allowed access to certain things.\nDe facto means \u201cin fact\u201d and captures situations where, regardless the reason and in the absence of de\ndicto discrimination, discrimination is, in fact, occurring. Wage discrimination, especially based on\ngender, that is prevalent in virtually every country does not enjoy any de dicto discrimination, but\nnonetheless is discrimination as a de facto occurrence.\nThe history of affirmative action, especially in the United States, is relevant in appreciating my\narguments. Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) was the first major\ntest of affirmative action where Allan P Bakke sued for admission to the UC Davis medical school on\nthe belief he was unfairly rejected due to his status as an over 30-year-old white male while less-\nqualified minority candidates were admitted under a quota system. A quota system ensures that there is a\ncertain number of minority applicants admitted for certain numbers of majority, meaning white,\ncandidates (in this case, at least 16 minority candidates had to be admitted for every 100 majority\ncandidates). A quota system, the Supreme Court ruled, was unconstitutional since it did not treat\napplicants as individuals but as mere members of a racial group. Thus, they ruled that Bakke ought to be\nadmitted and that affirmative action policies could not be based on quotas, but race could still\nconsidered when making admissions decisions. The general attitude of the Bakke case as upheld in two\nlater cases involving the University of Michigan in 2003, Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 and Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, the combination of which said that admissions standards can give preference\nto underrepresented minorities provided they do not result in a quota or guaranteed admission since\ndiversity can be in the best interest of the goals of the University. The Supreme Court did make clear,\nhowever, that policies can only remain in place while there appears to be a systemic problem of\nunjustified discrimination against minorities.\nMy argument rests on the idea that there remains unjust discrimination that we ought to correct.\nWhen there is not a proper representation of a minority class in a particular place of education or\nemployment and there is no obvious reason why this isn\u2019t the case (as opposed to the lack of NBA\nplayers under 5-feet tall, which is entirely understandable), then there is likely a problem that we ought\nto be concerned about correcting and an affirmative action policy might be the appropriate method to\nrectify the situation.\nA Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) is a powerful concept to aid in understanding\nwhen discrimination can be justified. BFOQs are used in employment law to appreciate which traits are\ngenuinely needed in a position, and thereby indicate which traits a hiring agent may justifiably\ndiscriminate in favor of or against. For example, it is a BFOQ to have a background and requisite\ndegrees or competence in Philosophy to teach Philosophy in college (the same goes for other subjects).\nBeing able to compete on the basketball court is a BFOQ to playing in the NBA; being tall is not. To be\ndenied a chance at playing professional basketball solely for being short would be unjustified. While\nbeing tall generally grants a significant advantage, it is not necessary to play, as the incomparable 5\u20193\u201d\nMuggsy Bogues proved. BFOQs are meant to pick out which things an individual must have in order to\nbe minimally competent to perform as desired.\nThe affirmative action policies I am advocating for are only those where candidates meet\njustifiable BFOQs. It is to no one\u2019s benefit to have a system where people are set up to fail, but once a\n4 A Defense of Affirmative Action\nNoah Levin 31 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ncandidate meets a minimum standard, it would seem the only reason to deny them a spot is because\nthere is someone else that is more qualified. The \u201cmore qualified\u201d condition can be due to objective or\nsubjective valuations, but it is important to note that candidates that meet the BFOQs are not\nunqualified, they are just not the strongest candidates. Therefore, as long as the candidates being\nadmitted can meet minimal criteria, there is nothing to be said against them being qualified for the\nposition. However, this raises another concern: are the criteria being used to determine BFOQs fair? The\nway to find the answer is the same as the way I am using to defend affirmative action: are candidates\nthat could be successful experiencing de facto discrimination due to unfair practices? If the answer is\n\u201cyes\u201d, then the criteria ought to change to be more inclusive.\nBut what is to be said against my argument? Why should we not have policies of affirmative\naction? There are four solid reasons opposing it:\n1) Affirmative action policies are no longer needed as there are no longer de dicto policies that\nkeep minorities down;\n2) Affirmative action will taint the successes of any individuals that have benefitted from it;\n3) Affirmative action policies will disincentivize minorities from attempting to better their\noverall positions, both at the group and individual level;\n4) Affirmative action policies are \u201creverse discrimination\u201d where stronger performing majority\ncandidates will not be chosen over minority ones that perform worse, which runs contrary to\nthe idea that the best candidates should merit earning the spot.\nI agree that all of these are concerns, but that only (4) is a real problem. For (1), while it is true\nthat there do not appear to be rampant de dicto discriminatory policies, the idea that we ought not\nconcern ourselves with other types of discrimination is simply wrong: there still exists concerning de\nfacto discrimination in many areas, and we are under a moral obligation to rectify it if the problem is a\nresult of no fault of those individuals being discriminated against and we are in a position to do\nsomething about it. Since both of these appear to be true, we ought to seek affirmative action policies.\n(2) can, and will, certainly happen. But is this enough to remove the policy? Mere perception of the\nbeneficiaries of affirmative action doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to remove the policies, as those that\nbenefit from them still deserve to benefit from them, regardless of how they will be perceived, which is\nthe fault of others, not themselves. Additionally, they might not be in a position of success without the\npolicies, undermining this reasoning as well. It is hard to believe (3) since the whole point of affirmative\naction is to help minorities succeed and assumes they want to succeed. Why would anyone seek\nanything if they didn\u2019t want success? Similar to my response to (2), even if this were true, it doesn\u2019t\nseem to be enough of a reason to avoid affirmative action policies. (4) is simply the result of\nimplementing affirmative action policies. This will happen. But when the purpose of affirmative action\nis greater societal fairness and the good of society, the individuals given an advantage by affirmative\naction may actually be the ones that merit the position the most. Choosing someone over someone else\ndue to an affirmative action policy is not the same as condemning the looked-over majority candidate to\nfailure; it is telling them they must look for success somewhere else. For minority candidates, without\naffirmative action policies, there might not be anywhere else to look. Doors will always be opened for\nmajority candidates to come and go; affirmative action simply wants to make sure that the door won\u2019t be\nlocked for those that have to open it themselves.\nSo, how should these policies be implemented? I am uncertain. There are many ways they can be\napplied, from giving people more points for minority status in a system that ranks candidates using\n4 A Defense of Affirmative Action\nNoah Levin 32 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\npoints, to using the \u201chated\u201d quota system in which a minimum number of minority candidates must be\nchosen (which could include choosing unqualified candidates, something that might be problematic, not\nto mention the fact quotas have been deemed unconstitutional). When the goal is overall fairness and\nensuring that minority candidates achieve the same level of consideration afforded their majority\ncounterparts all things considered, then the most effective policies at achieving that ought to be\nimplemented. I hope that someday we will not need policies enforcing this type of fairness and that we\nall may shed our innate biases against others, but this day may never come, so the need for affirmative\naction policies may never disappear.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Does having affirmative action policies make decision procedures more just? Why or why not?\n2. When might affirmative action policies be good to use?\n3. The Supreme Court has stated that affirmative action policies that work as quotas (where a certain\nnumber of minority candidates must be chosen) are unconstitutional. It has also been established that we\nhave unconscious biases that we cannot control and influence our decisions, like how everyone\n(regardless of height) appears to prefer taller people over shorter people. Should quotas be allowed if\nthey are meant to protect us from our inherent biases? Why or why not?\n4 A Defense of Affirmative Action\nNoah Levin 33 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n5\nThe Moral Issues of Immigration\nB.M. Wooldridge1\nSuppose I have a neighbour, call him Bob. Bob and his family moved into the house across the\nstreet from mine a couple of months ago. During this time, I have not interacted with Bob or his family\nall that much. I have a general idea as to who he is and what he does for a living, and overall my\nimpression of him and his family is quite positive. Suppose further that one-day Bob knocks on my door\nand says that he and his family would like to stay at my house for a while, say for six months. He says\nthat he admires my home, that it looks so much better than his and that, overall, he thinks that if he and\nhis family were to spend some time in my home, that they can enjoy life much better in my home than\nwhat they could in their home.\nI take it as intuitively plausible that I would be justified in refusing to allow Bob and his family\nto stay at my house. I would be justified in refusing Bob and his family entry to my house for at least\ntwo reasons: security concerns, and property rights. While I might look at Bob favourably, there is a\nchance that he and his family could threaten my safety, and refusing him entry to my home on these\ngrounds seems justifiable. Moreover, I also have property rights. I own my home, and if I do not want\nBob and his family on my property, I can justifiably refuse them entry. In the same way that I am\njustified in refusing Bob and his family entry to my home, so too, I will argue, is a state morally justified\nin refusing entry to immigrants. To better understand this argument, let us consider these two reasons\nfurther, beginning first with security concerns.\nThe first reason that I would be justified in refusing Bob and his family entry to my home would\nbe for security purposes. While my impression of Bob and his family might be positive, there are many\nthings that I do not know about Bob. For example, does he have a past criminal record? Has he been\nabusive towards his family in the past? Does he and his family subscribe to values and principles which\nare fundamentally against the values and principles that my family subscribes to? At a minimum, before\nallowing Bob and his family to enter and stay at my house, I would be justified in looking into Bob and\nhis family to find answers to the questions just raised, for I have a duty to my family to ensure that I am\nnot putting them at risk to be harmed. So too, in the case of immigration. States have a right to look into\npotential immigrants to determine whether they might pose a security risk to the state, as the state has a\nduty towards its members to ensure that they are protected. This duty can be explicated through the idea\nof a social contract. A state and its members have entered into an informal arrangement whereby the\nmembers of the state sacrifice some of their interests and rights to the state. In return, the state promises\nto act for the best interests of its members, which includes protecting them against foreign threats.\nImmigrants seeking entry to a state might pose security risks by, for example, having a past criminal\nrecord, engaging in behaviour that could disrupt the public order of the community that they seek to\njoin, having ties to terrorist organizations, or subscribing to values and principles that go against the\nfundamental values and principles that the state embodies. In either case, this puts the safety of the entire\nstate at risk, and in order to protect its members from potential harm, a state is justified in vetting\n1 Brandon Wooldridge, PhD Candidate, McMaster University.

Wooldridge 34 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nimmigrants to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the state and, if necessary, refuse to grant them\nentry to the state for security purposes.\nI should be careful here not to overstate my case. I am not saying that immigrants will pose a\nsecurity threat to a state, but only that immigrants can pose a security threat to a state. Joseph Carens, for\nexample, rightly points out that of the total number of immigrants who apply for entry to a state, very\nfew are actually security threats, and invoking the idea of security to exclude immigrants can be, and\nindeed has been, interpreted in an unfairly broad manner to include those immigrants who pose no threat\nto the nation.2 And in many cases, immigrants can enhance the culture of the state. As David Miller puts\nthe point, \u201cimmigration can often add spice to a previously dull national culture.\u201d3\nI acknowledge that immigrants often do not pose a security threat to the state, and that their\nadmittance can often have a positive impact on the state they seek to join. However, the fact that very\nfew people are actual security threats to the nation should not lead us to abandon the notion of security\nas a plausible ground for denying an immigrant entry to a state. First, even if few immigrants are real\nsecurity threats, we cannot tell who is and who is not a threat before actually vetting the individual.\nTerrorists, for example, do not carry cards saying that they are a terrorist. As such, stopping an\nimmigrant before she enters a state is necessary to determine whether she is a security threat. Second,\nhaving security as a criterion of exclusion serves an important practical function: it serves as a deterrent\nfor those who are real security threats. If we were to drop the criterion of security simply because so few\npeople are actual threats, this would serve as an incentive for those who are real threats to immigrate,\nsince they would have a better chance of admittance. However, by keeping the security criterion, we\nfurther deter them from immigrating and threatening the safety of our nation.\nMore importantly, however, the criterion of security has a fundamental importance for the state.\nIt is a fundamental component of political statehood to be able to control its own borders and restrict\naccess if it deems potential immigrants as threats to the nation. Even if a state is mistaken about who is\nand who is not a real security threat, the state has this right because it is a closed, politically self-\ndetermining entity. The very fact that immigrants can pose a threat to the state is enough to justify the\nstate preventing them from entering. In the same way that I would be justified in preventing Bob and his\nfamily from entering my home so that I can find out more about him and his family to ensure that they\ndo not threaten the safety of my family, so too should a state be able to prevent immigrants from\nentering so as to properly vet the immigrants and ensure that they do not pose a threat to the state.\nIn addition to security concerns, I would also be justified in refusing Bob and his family entry to\nmy home because of the property rights that I have as an owner of my home. The fact that I own my\nhome grants me certain rights over others that I otherwise would not hold. Jeremy Waldron, for\nexample, argues that the rules of property \u201care organized around the idea that various contested\nresources are assigned to the decisional authority of particular individuals \u2026 The person \u2026 has control\nover the object: it is for her to decide what should be done with it \u2026\u201d4 The state\u2019s property can be\nunderstood as the territorial boundaries that make up the state. The idea that the territorial boundaries of\na state compose the property of that state is essential for understanding statehood itself. As Michael\nBlake notes, a state cannot exist but for the existence of three things: \u201ca government capable of exerting\nits coercive control; a particular part of the world\u2019s surface over which that control is exerted; and a\n2 Joseph Carens, The Ethics of Immigration, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 175-6.\n3 David Miller, Strangers in our Midst: The Political Philosophy of Immigration, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University\nPress, 2016), 64.\n4 Jeremy, Waldron, \"Property and Ownership\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.\nZalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/property/>.\n5 The Moral Issues of Immigration\nB.M. Wooldridge 35 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nparticular group of people over whom that control is exercised (my emphasis).\u201d5 Thus, in order for a\nstate to exist, it must have territorial boundaries that separate it from other states. Similarly, the land on\nwhich a home is built has boundaries which demarcate it from other homes. If, in the case of homes, we\nconclude that the land one\u2019s home is built on encompasses one\u2019s property, then we are similarly justified\nin concluding that the land over which a state governs is also the property of the state. And if owning a\nhome grants an individual the right to refuse entry to someone, then owning a specific part of the\nworld\u2019s surface ought also to grant the state the right to refuse entry to an immigrant.\nThe idea of property rights also brings to light an important feature of statehood: self-\ndetermination. In the individual context, self-determination is the process by which one controls their\nlife. Self-determination, for example, grants one the freedom to determine who they associate with, what\nactivities they engage in, and so on. Applied to the state, self-determination can be generally understood\nas the process by which a state exercises control over its territorial boundaries and determines its\nexistence as a state. The central idea here is that a state is justified in determining which policies it\nchooses to adopt, and how it carries out those policies within its territorial boundaries. This idea of self-\ndetermination, however, is importantly grounded in the idea of property rights. The territorial boundaries\nof a state separate it from other states and comprises the property of the state which separates the state\nfrom other states.\nBefore moving on, let me conclude by emphasizing what a closed borders position entails and,\nimportantly, emphasize what it does not entail. In arguing that a state is justified in closing its borders to\nimmigrants, I am arguing that if a state deems a potential immigrant to be a security threat, then the state\nis justified in refusing to admit that migrant. Moreover, the state\u2019s property (i.e. its territorial\nboundaries) grants it rights to exclude in the same way a homeowner has the right to exclude a stranger\nentry onto her property. Importantly, however, in arguing for the claim that a state is justified in refusing\nentry to migrants, I am not committed to the claim that a state cannot or should not admit immigrants.\nThat is, in saying that a state is justified in closing its borders, I am not saying that a state should\ncompletely close its borders. A state may choose to admit immigrants onto its territory. Before doing\nthis, however, it is fully justified in looking into these immigrants and ensuring that they do not pose a\nthreat to the security of the state. Understood in this way, a closed borders position is not as closed off as\nwhat some might think.\nIn response to my argument a critic might raise two points. First, my position is based on what\nsome might think is an implausible analogy. While I have drawn similarities between statehood and\nowning a home, a critic might raise some important differences that problematizes my account. And\nsecond, a critic might argue that my position does not sufficiently account for the interests and rights of\nimmigrants.\nLet us begin with the first point, regarding my analogy between owning a home and statehood.\nWhile I have drawn some similarities between owning a home and statehood, there are some important\ndifferences. For example, one might argue that in the case of owning my home, I am justified in refusing\nentry to individuals of a specific ethnicity. Since it is my property, and I have ownership rights, there is\nnothing wrong with refusing entry to individuals I do not want. So too, might a critic argue, with the\ncase of the state. If I am justified in refusing entry to individuals of a certain ethnicity, then it would\nseem that a state would also be justified in refusing entry to individuals of a specific ethnicity, which\nwould result in morally unjust and blameworthy practices.\nIn response to this objection, I maintain that the reasons one has for refusing entry to a visitor, in\n5 Michael Blake, \u201cImmigration, Jurisdiction, and Exclusion\u201d, Philosophy and Public Affairs, 41, 2 (2013): 109.\n5 The Moral Issues of Immigration\nB.M. Wooldridge 36 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthe case of homes, and immigrants, in the case of migration, must be morally justifiable reasons.\nRefusing entry based on prejudicial and/or racist principles is not morally justifiable, regardless of one\u2019s\nproperty rights. So, what this means is that if one refuses entry based on racist or prejudicial reasons,\none can still be held morally blameworthy. Having property rights does not override having basic moral\nrespect for the rights of others.\nLet us now move on to consider the rights of immigrants. Do immigrants have a fundamental\ninterest in migrating, and might this generate a \u2018right to immigrate\u2019 which can override the state\u2019s\ninterests in closing its borders? One way to argue for this claim is to argue that our commitment to one\nthing, A, has implications that should lead us to commit to something else, B. In other words, if we are\ncommitted to A, then logically we must also be committed to B. With respect to immigration, it is\nsometimes argued that the human right to immigrate is a logical extension of the right to move freely\nwithin states. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \u201cEveryone has the\nright to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.\u201d6 People are free to move\nwithin states for a variety of different reasons, such as to pursue a job or to pursue a relationship with a\nromantic partner. Not only is one free to move within borders, but this is also important for individuals,\nas it enables them to have sufficient access to the range of opportunities that the state provides. Since\ninternal freedom of movement is established as a legitimate human right, then so too should one have\nthe right to move freely across borders.7\nThe success and strength of this argument depends on how one understands a human right. One\napproach would be to assert, as Christopher Wellman does, that a human right is a claim to protection\nagainst the standard threats to living a minimally decent life.8 In order to live a minimally decent life,\none must have a sufficient degree or range of opportunities to satisfy one\u2019s basic human interests.9 If we\nunderstand human rights in this way, then the claim that one should have a right to immigrate is very\nmuch dependent on whether one\u2019s human rights are being respected in one\u2019s home country. If an\nimmigrant has a range of opportunities to pursue her basic interests in her home country, then her basic\nhuman rights are not being harmed in her home country. And if her human rights are not being harmed\nin her home country, then there is no fundamental interest to immigrate that could ground a right to\nimmigrate. As such, she would not have a \u2018right\u2019 to immigrate, but rather only a very strong interest in\ndoing so.\nWhat about cases where human rights are not be recognized and respected? Consider, for\nexample, a refugee crisis, where individuals are forced to flee their country for fear of persecution. In\ncases like this, the basic interests of human beings are not being fulfilled, and so human rights are not\nbeing recognized or respected, and as such, refugees might be thought to have a human right to\nimmigrate. While I am sympathetic to the plight of refugees, and while their very strong interest in\nmigrating might rise to the level of a human right, it does not follow that this right is absolute. A human\nright to immigrate would grant us the right to move to any country, not any particular country. If an\nimmigrant, and this includes refugees, is refused entry to a country, and has other countries to which she\n6 \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" Article 13, adopted December 10, 1948 by the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, available at http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/.\n7 Joseph Carens presents a version of this argument in The Ethics of Immigration.\n8 Christopher H.

Wooldridge 37 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ncan immigrate, then we cannot say that her human right to immigrate is being violated. So long as there\nis at least one state that is willing to take an immigrant in, then a state refusing entry to that immigrant is\nnot violating the immigrant\u2019s rights. And, in the cases of refugees, a state should do all that it can to help\nthese refugees find a safe haven, whether in their own country or in that of another. However, any right\nthat an immigrant has to immigrate is not strong enough to outweigh the state\u2019s interest in protecting its\nborders.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

Wooldridge 38 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n6\nThe Ethics of our Digital Selves\nNoah Levin1\nThe more we move ourselves online, the more complicated things get. People often long for the\n\u201csimpler\u201d days of old, and in the case of social media and \u201calways-on\u201d connections to the digital world,\nwe are, indeed, becoming increasingly more complex. We can extend and diversify aspects of ourselves\nin ways that people a century ago could never have envisioned, but we also still retain all the options\nthey had. Derek Parfit has provided convincing arguments over the years that there is some truth in the\nold adage, \u201cI put a little bit of myself in that.\u201d To paraphrase some his arguments (mostly from his 1984\nwork, Reasons and Persons), he maintains that our identities in the strict and traditional sense (that we\nare the \u201csame\u201d person from one day to the next) is not as important as it appears at first. What really\nmatters is that the important parts of ourselves (however we understand such things) continue on.\nIdentity is the easy way to understand and track this (who shares your hopes and dreams more than your\nown self?), but identity is not what matters. People do, in a very real and valuable sense, extend their\nidentities into whatever object, person, or idea they create or mix with. Part of them becomes an element\nof those things, and part of those things become a part of that person. In the past, people perhaps simply\nput themselves in things like pies (only metaphorically, I hope), a book, a house, a painting, their\nchildren, etc. All of these options are still available to us, but so is Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,\nSnapchat, texts, Instagram, and anything we can #hashtag. These are not merely tools we use or ways\nwe can express ourselves, but can be genuine extensions of ourselves. They don\u2019t have to be, but if one\nwere deny that there was any reason for the suicide of a cyberbullied teenager due to the endless\ntaunting and personal violations they experienced online, then we fail to appreciate the intimate\nconnections our digital selves have to our real selves.\nI want to argue that we should accept that our digital selves are becoming an increasingly\nimportant part of our real selves and that we ought to modify our understandings, actions, and policies to\naccount for this shift. The boundaries between what has generally been called \u201creal life\u201d (often\nabbreviated RL when discussed online) and our \u201cdigital selves\u201d is getting fuzzier every day for many\npeople, particularly for younger people that are growing up at a time when social media is ubiquitous\n(everywhere and in all aspects of our lives). We should not reject this fact of existence for many (nor, do\nI think, embrace it) but we should accept it and understand that the implications of doing this are not\ndrastic nor unique, but merely require us to consider our digital lives alongside every other aspect of\nourselves. In other words, all we have to do is understand the digital extensions of ourselves in the same\nways we have traditionally understood the complexities of our existences and lives. This relationship\nrequires special consideration because our digital selves work in ways that can be very intimately tied to\nour real selves.\nI would like to offer a description or definition of what constitutes our digital selves, but it\u2019s hard\nto capture it succinctly or accurately, and no matter how much I might include, I would inevitably miss\naspects that some people find important. The general idea is rather simple: there are available to us many\n1 Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College. He may be reached at nlevin@gwc.cccd.edu.

These electronic disseminations, at the very least, are made up items we present to the\noutside world. For example, sharing photos on any one of the numerous sites that allows such a thing\nconstitutes this. Having conversations, liking, commenting on posts, writing in a blog, posting videos,\netc., all fall under these activities. Making a meme, forwarding a meme, participating in an online event\n(like multiplayer gaming events) all also contribute to this. Creating and playing a character or becoming\nan active part of an online community all influence, and ideally enhance, our lives. There is no limit to\nhow we interact online, and with increases in virtual reality, they will only become more intimate and\ninvolved.\nI would like to examine the common law concept of spousal privilege as a way to better\nunderstand the intimate nature of our digital selves. Spousal privilege means that spouses have special\nlegal obligations and protections to each other. While there is a complicated history behind it, its origins,\nand its implications, it is important right now for how it is applied: the legal fiction (a legal assumption\nthat something is true even though in reality it is not, like how corporations are considered people)\nutilized when applying spousal privileges is the view that the married couple is a single person. This is\nimportant because, for example, you cannot be called to testify against yourself. If your spouse is a part\nof yourself, then your spouse cannot be called to testify against you. This legal fiction, despite its entry\ninto the law through the sexist viewpoint that a wife became, in a sense, the \u201cproperty\u201d of the husband\nand was no longer a separate legal entity, is based on the idea that two separate people can come\ntogether in a \u201cunion\u201d whereby the prior individuals are no longer the distinct, separate persons they once\nwere. They are clearly not one person (a divorce is not a literal separation of a person into two pieces),\nbut there is some extension of one spouse into the other in a very real way. It\u2019s not a conceptual game or\nmerely a fiction. It is not unique to marriages, but the concept of spousal privilege gives a solid and clear\nlegal mechanism that underlies the idea at the heart of my arguments: we can extend ourselves into\nthings outside of ourselves in real and meaningful ways, which carry with them the implication that we\ncan be impacted in a (literally) personal way when those extensions of ourselves are benefitted or\nharmed. Likewise, others can also extend themselves into us. The internet and all of its tools allows us to\nshare and extend ourselves in increasingly intimate and expansive ways.\nI speak of \u201cdigital selves\u201d and \u201creal selves\u201d as if they are different. For some, they might actually\nbe, as in cases where individuals create entirely separate persons for themselves to be used online or\nhave no online presence at all. But here\u2019s the interesting part: some people that live a lot of their lives\nonline do so because they feel their digital representation is a more accurate portrayal of their \u201cgenuine\u201d\nself. In Ernest Cline\u2019s Ready Player One (book, 2011; movie directed by Steven Spielberg, 2018) most\npeople in the year 2044 spend their time in the Oasis, a virtual world that has taken over most\ninteractions that would normally occur in the real world, like schooling, sports, games, and customer\nservice. The avatars (digital characters) that everyone uses are personally chosen to properly represent\nhow they view themselves or want others to view them. While a handful of people use avatars that\nclosely resemble their real-world selves, most choose ones that are what they want to be (such as an\nidealized version of themselves without any perceived flaws) or how they truly feel about themselves\n(like a giant orc). For a number of characters, their digital versions gradually overtake their real selves\nand physical bodies become burdensome biological machines that simply have to be dealt with from\ntime to time. Current technology isn\u2019t there yet, but we should easily be able to understand how this can\nhappen, and this is important: it shows that our appreciation of our digital elements is evolving to\ninclude a robust incorporation of our digital elements. Indeed, most of our lives might be lived in virtual\nenvironments in the near future, where \u201cvirtual reality\u201d simply becomes \u201creality.\u201d\n6 The Ethics of our Digital Selves\nNoah Levin 40 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nBut there is still reasoned resistance to this idea. The relationship with the digital elements of\nourselves can be varied, and this might be a significant factor in a predisposition to disregard the impact\nof the digital world on real selves. It is hard for us to get into someone else\u2019s head and truly understand\ntheir innermost feelings and motivations, and the more disconnected we are from the elements that make\nthem up, the harder it is. While I can hear the words and understand what\u2019s being said when, for\nexample, a reality star says, \u201cthey totally screwed up my eyebrows and it like, totally, ruined my night,\u201d\nit\u2019s difficult for me to empathize since I (1) don\u2019t really care about having perfect eyebrows and (2) my\neyebrows are always perfect (I passed up an eyebrow modeling gig to pursue my career in Philosophy).\nAll kidding aside, I can understand and believe the impact something like this has on that reality star,\neven though I don\u2019t empathize with the problem in the same way I would with someone\u2019s sadness at the\nloss of a beloved pet (but others might not be able to empathize with this loss in the ways I can). The\ndifficulty with the digital elements of our lives is that people with no connection to the digital world\ninteract regularly and closely with those who exist mostly inside of it, so while they will connect in\nmany ways, they might not be able to fully understand how impactful the digital world (or the lack of it)\nis on each other\u2019s lives. I don\u2019t think that people value things any differently; I think there is a difference\nin the degree to which people will value certain things (and expect others to value them similarly). For\nexample, a toddler can break down when they lose their favorite toy, while an adult might simply say,\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid toy, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Similarly, someone might say, \u201cJust ignore those Instagram\ntrolls,\u201d an action much easier said than done for those that live a good chunk of their lives on the social\nmedia platform.\nWhat\u2019s to be said against changing our conception of the individual to better incorporate our\ndigital aspects? I actually cannot find any reason other than ignorance in a literal sense. The simple idea\nthat some people don\u2019t know or understand how integral digital elements have become in some people\u2019s\nlives is not enough to ignore the role they play for many people. In the same way it\u2019s more of a crime to\nkill someone\u2019s pet than a stray cat and particularly cruel to burn a child\u2019s favorite blanket than a random\nsheet, we can appreciate that different people value different things differently. It\u2019s nothing new or\nnovel, but the digital world allows us to do so in so many extensive ways we need to be more conscious\nof if we are to be properly just and compassionate people.\nFinally, what does this changing conception of ourselves mean for policies? In short, since it\nmeans that harms to digital selves can, and should, be understood to constitute harms to our real selves,\nand policies should change to reflect this. Things that we do not permit in real life should also not be\npermitted online. There was a famous incidence in 1993 often referred to as \u201cA Rape in Cyberspace\u201d\nafter the title of the article penned by the victim. The rape happened in one of the earliest multi-user\ngames, LambdaMOO, that was mostly a complicated chat room where users could interact and create\ntheir own rules. One user was able to \u201ctake over\u201d another\u2019s avatar and made her perform many\nunwanted sexual actions on others. The real-life person felt violated in an intimate fashion, which\nshocked her, as she had never realized how integral her digital self had become to her real self. Some\nlaughed it off as a ridiculous (literally) unreal occurrence. I would hope we have evolved to see that this\nwas more than just simulating sex acts with stuffed animals and a real harm was committed. Violations\nlike this will only become more intimate and common, and we are under a moral obligation to appreciate\nthis. Most importantly, there should no longer be any difficulties in understanding \u201ccyberbullying\u201d\nsimply as \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201csocial media harassment\u201d simply as \u201charassment.\u201d To qualify these types of\nharms is to ignore their real force.\nThere are also the positive aspects of moving ourselves more online. We are no longer restricted\nto our geographic locations when looking for friendship, love, or simply acceptance. Our neighbors\n6 The Ethics of our Digital Selves\nNoah Levin 41 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nexpand from those that are just a few steps away to those that are just a few clicks away. If living online\nwere all bad, no one would do it. It\u2019s because of its benefits and enrichment that we are constantly\nextending ourselves online. It is important that we appreciate all of the complexities technology adds to\nour lives if we are to live in a future where they properly enhance, instead of degrade, our existences.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What is your relationship to the digital aspects of yourself? Do you live mostly online? Do you avoid\nsocial media? Why do you approach it the way you do?\n2. What experiences do you have with online abuse, like trolling, harassment, or bullying? How does\nthis compare to those things in real life?\n3. Is there generally a difference in how people behave online when compared to real life? Does this\nmatter in a moral sense?\n6 The Ethics of our Digital Selves\nNoah Levin 42 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nUNIT TWO: TORTURE, DEATH, AND THE\n\u201cGREATER GOOD\u201d\nWe do ethics so that we can understand how to live a good life and do good things and how to\navoid living a bad life and doing bad things. Many important questions about living, however, ask us to\nalso consider death. This Unit brings together a few related issues that are the opposite of living well:\ntorture, poverty, euthanasia, capital punishment, and abortion. These are not cheery topics to consider,\nbut they are some of the more important, and polarizing, moral questions that confront society today. At\nthe heart of most of these questions lies two important assumptions: pain and death are bad. But what\ndoes this say about living? And what type of life do we care about living? Through examining the issues\nin this Unit, we\u2019ll come to a better understanding of what is valuable about living (and dying).\nChapter 7, The Ethics of Torture by Martine Berenpas, discusses the motivations for, but also the\nserious problems with, torture. Chapter 8, What Moral Obligations do we have (or not have) to\nImpoverished Peoples? by B.M. Wooldridge, discusses the difficult problem of balancing our own\nautonomy and rights to the fruits of our labor with what we ought to do for those that need our help.\nChapter 9, Euthanasia: Pro and Con by Nathan Nobis, discusses the situations where death might be\npreferable to life and the possible concerns of allowing people to pursue medical options to end their\nlives (and get help doing it). Chapter 10, An Argument Against Capital Punishment, discusses the\nreasons for executing criminals and the potential problems for policies implementing it. Chapters 11,\nCommon Arguments about Abortion by Nathan Nobis and Kristina Grob, lays out many of the more\npopular arguments that are presented for and against and abortion and points out many of the problems\nthat plague them. Chapter 12, The Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion also by Nathan\nNobis and Kristina Grob, goes through the more nuanced philosophically-inspired arguments about\nabortion and illustrates that the most rational conclusion to draw is that most abortions are morally\npermissible and ought to be legal.\nUNIT TWO: TORTURE, DEATH, AND THE \u201cGREATER GOOD\u201d 43 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n7\nThe Ethics of Torture\nMartine Berenpas1\nWhat is torture?\nIn 2002 the media began to carry stories that U.S. military officers were engaging in torturing a\nlarge number of prisoners at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base. At first, the American government\ndenied that torture methods were being used, but soon they had to admit that some torture was used as\n\u201can enhanced interrogation technique\u201d to obtain information in the war on terrorism (Fletcher et al.,\n2008:4). In 2004, The Justice Department advised the White House that torture \u201cmay be justified\u201d for\ninterrogations conducted in the war on terrorism.\nTorture is defined in part as the deliberate infliction of extreme suffering. Torture is prohibited\nby the United Convention against Torture (Torture Convention) and is a universal human right that is\ngrounded in the habeas corpus right; the \u201cright to have the body\u201d. The Torture Convention is derived\nfrom the prohibition on torture as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During war\ntime, the jus in bello (\u201cjustice in war\u201d) or the International Humanitarian Law is in place to \u201cregulate\nhow wars are fought, without prejudice to the reasons of how and why they had begun\u201d (Luban, 2014).\nThe 1996 War Crimes Act particularly prohibits willful killing, torture and inhumane treatment at all\ntimes.\nThe various national and international conventions and laws against torture make a distinction\nbetween torture and inhumane treatment. Some forms of mental suffering for example are not\nconsidered as torture because it does not cause severe physical suffering.\nAll of the practices of torture presuppose that the torturer has control over the victim\u2019s body.\nTorture as such is the intentional infliction of extreme physical suffering on a non-consenting and\ndefenseless person (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). The definition should exclude acts that are\nconsidered as acts of self-defense; torture is, contrary to acts of self-defense, aimed at undermining the\nvictim\u2019s autonomy.\nGenerally speaking, torture is the intentional infliction of extreme physical pain either for\npersonal pleasure, interrogational, punitive or terroristic purposes (Stanford University of Philosophy).\nThese motives are not mutually exclusive insofar as acts of torture might be motivated by several of\nthese purposes. For example, torturing a criminal might have a punitive purpose as well as a terroristic\npurpose to deter future acts of crime.\nIntentionally inflicting physical pain on a non-consenting and defenseless person is a moral evil\nthat particularly undermines our liberal (in the sense of liberty) values. Yet even actions that are\ninherently morally wrong might be morally justified in extreme circumstances. What if we can save\n1000 of lives when we torture a terrorist who can tell us how to dismantle a bomb?\nTorture is an interesting philosophical topic, not only because it is grounded in some account of\n1 Martine Berenpas (m.berenpas@phil.leidenuniv.nl) is a PhD candidate in the Institute of Philosophy at Leiden University,\nthe Netherlands.

This philosophical experiment is used to justify torture as an exception to\nforestall a future catastrophe.\nIn this chapter I will present some perspectives on torture from philosophers such as Aristotle,\nHegel and Bentham. These perspectives show us that philosophers are concerned with the questions of if\nand when we can justify the use of torture. There are those such as Beccaria, who argued that torture\nshould not be used because it is against the principle that someone should not be punished until he or she\nis proven guilty in court of law. Aristotle raises the question whether torture leads to \u201ctrue knowledge\u201d.\nThe only philosopher who argues that torture is justified in extreme cases is Jeremy Bentham. We will\nrelate Bentham\u2019s argument to the ticking time bomb scenario, because justifying torture often relies on\nsome form of consequentialism.\nThe philosophy of torture\nThroughout history, torture has often been used to obtain information from a person. An\nimportant question is whether torture is even an adequate method to acquire useful information. Already\nin Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric, we find a philosophical evaluation on the different positions that persons take in\nregard to evidence acquired through torture:\n\u201cTorture is a kind of evidence, which appears trustworthy, because a sort of compulsion is\nattached to it. Nor is it difficult to see what may be said concerning it, and by what arguments if it in our\nfavor, we can exaggerate its importance by asserting that it is the only true kind of evidence; but if it is\nagainst us and in favour of our opponent, we can destroy its value by telling the truth about all kinds of\ntorture generally; for those under compulsion are as likely to give false evidence as true, some being\nready to endure everything rather than tell the truth, which others are equally ready to make false\ncharges against others, in the hope of being sooner released from torture.\u201d (Aristotle, 2014:163).\nAlthough Aristotle affirms that torture involves extreme physical pain inflicted to a non-\nconsenting and defenseless person, he does not argue that torture is morally wrong. He only argues that\nthe truthfulness of evidence obtained through torture is open for debate.\nOne of the first philosophers who argued that torture was a judicial vice, is Cesare Beccaria\n(1738-1794). Beccaria argued that torture was a violation of the principle that no one should be punished\nuntil proven guilty in court of law. Furthermore, Beccaria thought that torture was an ineffective\npunitive method that prevented the criminal from learning from his or her mistakes. Torture is not based\non the principle of justice, but motivated by vengeance. Judicial punishment should never be based on\nemotions or sentiments, but should solely be based on the prevention of crime:\n\u201cThe purpose of punishment, then, is nothing other than to dissuade the criminal from doing\nfresh harm. Punishments and the method of inflicting them should be chosen that, mindful of the\nproportion between crime and punishment, will make the most effective and lasting impression\non men\u2019s minds and inflict the least torment on the body of the criminal\u201d (Beccaria, 1964:53).\nTorture is particularly morally revolting because it is aimed at a non-consenting, defenseless\nperson. Torture practices presuppose that the torturer has control over the victim\u2019s body and degrades\nthe victim to a mere object. The controlling relation and the power that the torturer has on the victim, is\nin the philosophy of Hegel explained as a struggle between rights and recognition.\nHegel used law extensively both as an illustration of the dialectical process of history as well as\nthe necessary step in the unfolding of the ethical life (Sittlichkeit). From a Hegelian perspective, torture\n7 The Ethics of Torture\nMartine Berenpas 45 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nis grounded in the struggle of recognition and must be seen as a wrong in which the other is no longer or\nnot yet regarded as counting as an end in itself. Hegel argues in particular that if the state uses torture as\na judicial method, it fails to recognize the criminal as an end in himself and hinders the criminal\u2019s ability\nto achieve full self-consciousness within his community (Hegel, 1983:118; Woodson Hogan, 2013).\nMost philosophers argue that torture is a morally questionable action that destroys human\nfreedom, prevents the criminal from becoming a better person and treats humans as means and not as\nends. The idea that a human should never be treated as a mere end is formulated by Immanuel Kant in\nthe Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals. Kant identified the supreme principle, the categorical\nimperative, in which rational agency provides its own means. In other words: the categorical imperative\nis a moral law that is derived from pure reason and is universally valid. Based on the categorical\nimperative that one should act only according to the maxim of which one can make a universal law of\nthe rule. The categorical imperative thus argues that we should not lie, because we don\u2019t want \u201cYou\nshould lie\u201d to be a universal moral law. Kant identified a second formulation of the categorical\nimperative for humanity, \u201cAct in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in\nthe person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end\u201d\n(Kant, 1949:433).\nKant would argue the inherent immorality of torture, regardless of the circumstances or motives.\nTorture is always wrong, because it contradicts the second formulation of humanity and violates the\ncategorical imperative. We will all agree that the use of torture should not be a universal moral law.\nIn philosophical terms, we call this approach to morality deontological ethics; in which the\naction in itself is assessed as wrong or right, regardless of the consequences of it. There are also some\nphilosophers who argue that an action should be assessed on whether the action produces the right kinds\nof overall consequences. Those who argue that torture is morally wrong but is justified when it is used to\nprevent even greater crime, all adhere to some account of consequentialism (Stanford Encyclopedia for\nPhilosophy).\nOne of the most well-known accounts of consequentialism is Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Utilitarianism.\nBentham\u2019s basic idea is that we should maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of universal\nwell-being. Based on this line of reasoning, Bentham\u2019s raises the question whether torturing a criminal\nis justified when it prevents the killing hundreds of innocent people:\n\u201cFor the purpose of rescuing from torture these hundreds innocents, should any scruple be made\nof applying equal or superior torture, to extract the requisite information from the mouth of one\ncriminal, who having it in his power to make known the place where at this time the enormity\nwas practicing or about to be practiced, should refuse do so?\u201d (Bentham, 1804:6).\nBentham\u2019s argument is very close to what nowadays is known as the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d\nscenario. Most persons who argue that torture is justified in extreme circumstances rely on some version\nof the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario and argue that torture is sometimes justified when it is used for\ninterrogational purposes.\nThe \u201cticking time bomb\u201d thought experiment\nThought experiments are frequently used in philosophy as a method to justify our intuitive\nthinking. A common feature of these thought experiments is that they are imaginary and involve some\ndegree of generalization (Williamson, 2018).\nOne of the most used thought experiment in the torture debate is the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d\n7 The Ethics of Torture\nMartine Berenpas 46 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nscenario. This experiment asks us to put ourselves in the position of an experienced law officer facing a\nsituation in which a terrorist group states that it has hidden a nuclear bomb in the city center of New\nYork. The authorities have arrested the leader of the group who says that he knows where the bomb is\nlocated. The terrorist however refuses to reveal the bomb\u2019s location. As he is detained in the\ninterrogation room, the clock is ticking. The question that this thought experiment addresses is whether\nwe should use torture to obtain the information from the terrorist that can prevent the catastrophe.\nThe ticking time bomb argues that torture is inherently wrong, but that it might be justified in\nextreme circumstances. Furthermore, the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d seems to suggest that torture might be\njustified for interrogational purposes to prevent a future catastrophe. Furthermore, the ticking time bomb\nsuggests that torture is the only way of preventing the catastrophe. The terrorist in this experiment is\nalready guilty \u2013 already a criminal \u2013 so why should we take his human rights into account if he is willing\nto kill so many innocent people?\nThe \u201cticking time bomb\u201d is so mesmerizing because it plays with our moral intuition that we\nshould at all time prevent innocent people from being killed. The scenario is framed to see the terrorist\nas a bad guy and, as such, we are more prone to dismiss his human rights and to justify the use of torture\nto save innocent lives. The problem with the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario is that torture in real-life\ncases are justified based on some version of this experiment. Our reality is, however, more complex and\nambiguous than a philosophical thought experiment.\nFirst of all, it is a false dichotomy to claim that we either torture the terrorist and save lives or not\ntorture the terrorist and lose lives. In a real \u201cticking time bomb\u201d situation there are certainly more\noptions like evacuating the city or trying to locate and dismantle the bomb. Furthermore, in most real-\nlife scenarios we most of the time only have a strong suspicion that the suspected is involved in the\nterrorist attack. We might have the suspicion that he or she is the mastermind behind the attack, but in\nreal-life cases we are not one-hundred percent sure. Even in attacks that already happened, such as the\n1995 Oklahoma bombing, we are still faced with unexplained details and are left with the question\nwhether we have arrested all the accomplices involved in organizing and executing a crime. And even if\nwe know that the suspect is the mastermind behind the crime, it might not lead to the information that\nwe need. The point here is that in real-life cases we run the risk that we are torturing a suspect who does\nnot have the information that we need, or does not give the information we need or does not give us it\nearly enough to prevent the crime. One of the cases similar to the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario was the\n2002 kidnapping in Germany of Jakob von Metzler in which the suspect revealed the location of the\nkidnapped boy because the police threatened to torture him; unfortunately, however, the boy had already\nbeen killed.\nEven when we are sure that the suspect has the information, we are still faced with ethical\nchallenges. When we argue that torture is allowed in extreme circumstances, we also need to think about\nwhat kind of torture techniques are permissible to extract the information from the suspect. Should we\nonly engage in \u201ctorture lite\u201d such as standing against the wall for a prolonged period, sleep deprivation\nand continuous sensory stimulation or should we use physical torture such as waterboarding, slapping or\nbranding? And who should administer torture? Should we train somebody who can inflict just the right\namount of physical or mental pain that will break the suspect?\nConsequentialism argues that we should assess the good that results from the moral act against\nthe bad. However, the problem in the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario is that the attack did not yet happen.\nIt is only a threat; we don\u2019t know how many people will die nor do we know for sure that the bomb will\ngo off (it might be fake, or not working properly). How should we justify the use of torture against the\nconsequences that are so difficult to determine?\n7 The Ethics of Torture\nMartine Berenpas 47 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nDavid Luban aptly points to the fact that the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario is often used to justify\ntorture in extreme cases, without having to engage in a thorough debate on torture, \u201cTalking about them\n[ticking time bomb scenarios] is a distraction from discussing the actual practice of torture with no\nticking bombs in the background\u201d (Luban, 2014:75).\nThe \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario in its generalized and idealized form is not helping us to\naddress the issues we should address when we want to justify torture in extreme cases. Ticking time\nbomb versions in real-life are far more complicated and are not as clear-cut as the idealized version of it.\nEven the German case, in which the mere threat of torture did lead to the victim, no lives were saved.\nThe mere fact is that torture always violates the human rights and dignity of the suspect. Yet, violating\nthe suspect\u2019s rights does not always save lives nor does it always lead to the prevention of a catastrophe.\nUsing the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario to justify torture in extreme circumstances is an ethically\nquestionable argument in which we are faced with a lot of uncertainties and challenges. Questions and\nchallenges that, when taken seriously, are not in favor of justifying torture, but highlight why we should\nrefrain from torture at all times.\nReferences\nAristotle, (2003) Rhetoric, Createspace Independent Publishing Platform.\nBeccaria, Cesare, (1964) [1764] On Crimes and Punishments, J.

Wooldridge1\nSuppose one day, on your way in to work or school, you discover a shallow pond, and in this\npond, a small child is drowning and fighting to stay alive. You have just recently bought a new pair of\nshoes, shoes that you have been saving up money for. If you decide to save the small child drowning in\nthe pond, you will get these new shoes muddy, and likely destroy them. You are thus faced with a\nchoice: do you save the child and damage your brand-new shoes, or do you continue on your way,\nthereby preserving your new shoes, but letting an innocent child drown?\nThis famous thought experiment, known as the \u2018Drowning Child\u2019 example and created by\nphilosopher Peter Singer in his article \u201cFamine, Affluence, and Morality,\u201d2 has raised serious questions\nabout our moral obligations to the world\u2019s poor. It is estimated that, as of 2018, around half of the\nworld\u2019s population (roughly 3 billion people) struggle to meet their basic needs, while ten percent of the\nworld\u2019s population (roughly seven hundred million people) live in extreme poverty, defined as living on\nless than $1.90 a day.3 An even more alarming statistic is that, as of 2018, \u201cthe 26 richest billionaires\nown as many assets as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the planet\u2019s population.\u201d4\nSo, not only are there millions of people suffering from poverty, but there is a tremendous gap in the\nwealth of individuals.\nClearly, these rough estimates paint a particularly bleak picture, perhaps bleaker than when\nSinger first published his article in 1972. The impetus behind Singer\u2019s drowning child example is to\ndraw our attention to the plight of the world\u2019s poor, and to show that if we think it would be morally\negregious to ignore the drowning child, it is also morally egregious to ignore the world\u2019s poor and do\nnothing to help them. Singer bases his argument on two central premises. First, suffering and death from\nlack of food, shelter, and medical care is bad. Second, if it is in our power to prevent something bad\nfrom happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought\nmorally to do it.5 In other words, if we can prevent something bad from happening without causing\nanything else bad to happen, or without making a significant sacrifice, then we ought to do it.\nAccording to Singer, saving the drowning child involves little sacrifice on our part; muddying\nour new shoes is, in the grand scheme of things, not a tremendous sacrifice. In the same way, it involves\nlittle effort on our part to donate some of our money and/or time to help those suffering from poverty.\nSo, in the same way that we should save the drowning child, so too should we help those suffering from\n1 Brandon Wooldridge, PhD Candidate, McMaster University.

Wooldridge 50 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\npoverty. Indeed, according to Singer, we \u201cought to give as much as possible, that is, at least up to the\npoint at which by giving more one would begin to cause serious suffering for oneself and one\u2019s\ndependents \u2013 perhaps even beyond this point to the point of marginal utility, at which by giving more\none would cause oneself and one\u2019s dependents as much suffering as one would prevent.\u201d6\nWhile I agree with Singer that we ought to help those suffering from poverty, I disagree with his\nconclusion that we should give as much as possible, even up to the point where we would make\nourselves suffer. In what follows, I will argue that we have a moral obligation to give our fair share to\npoverty relief efforts. Before proceeding to make this argument, however, let me first offer a couple of\ncriticisms of Singer\u2019s argument.\nThe first problem with Singer\u2019s argument is that he relies on an implausible thought experiment\nto support his position. It is fairly obvious that anyone who sees a child drowning in a pond, and who\ncan easily save this child at minimal cost to oneself, would save the child. A failure to do so would be\nmorally reprehensible. Yet, this thought experiment does not accurately depict the plight of the world\u2019s\npoor. It is not just one individual that needs saving. Many individuals, up to the millions, need saving.\nWhile it might not involve a great sacrifice to save the drowning child, donating money and time to\nsaving the world\u2019s poor is much more onerous, and places extreme demands on an individual. This is\nespecially so if we follow Singer\u2019s advice and give to the point of marginal utility. A more accurate\nthought experiment might include an individual walking along a beach, and in the ocean are millions of\npeople who need saving. Would we jump in then and save the millions?\nA related problem with Singer\u2019s thought experiment is the disconnect between saving a\ndrowning child and helping someone in poverty who is in another nation. When we jump into a pond\nand save a child, we can actually experience what our actions produce. We can confirm that a child has\nbeen saved. When we donate to an aid agency, however, we do not know where our money goes. And,\nmore importantly, it is unlikely that our donation will actually directly \u2018save\u2019 a child. While our donation\nwill certainly make a difference in helping those suffering from poverty, we will not be directly saving\nanyone, at least not in the same way we would be by rescuing a drowning child from a pond.\nFinally, Singer\u2019s claim that we should donate up to the point where by donating more we would\nmake ourselves worse off, is simply impractical and does not appreciate the interests of individuals. As\nindividuals we have interests and desires, things that we want to do with our lives. This might involve,\nfor example, going to university to achieve gainful employment later in life. If we are asked to give to\nthe point where we would make ourselves suffer, as Singer suggests, this mitigates the value of these\ninterests. There is nothing morally problematic about pursuing ends that will make one better off in the\nfuture. And while it is unfortunate that millions of people suffer from poverty throughout the world, this\nshould not require us to abandon our interests and commitments to help those who are in need,\nregardless of how morally noble this cause is.\nAt this point, we might pause to consider our obligations to those who suffer from poverty, but\nwho are geographically closer to us. It might be argued, for example, that we have a moral obligation to\nhelp those suffering from poverty who are in the same location as you. If one resides in a province in\nCanada (Ontario, for example), one has an obligation to help those suffering from poverty in Ontario.\nWe can narrow this further by arguing that we have an obligation to help those who suffer from poverty\nwho reside in our town or city. This would mitigate the impact of distance. While I might still be far\naway from someone suffering from poverty in my own town or city, it is much closer than, say,\nsomeone suffering from poverty who resides in Africa. However, while this might mitigate the\n6 Ibid 234.\n8 What Moral Obligations do we have (or not have) to Impoverished Peoples?\nB.M. Wooldridge 51 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nimportance of distance, it still does not change the fact that even in a place like Ontario, thousands to\nmillions of people suffer from poverty, and donating to help these individuals could be just as onerous as\ndonating to relief efforts to eradicate poverty in other nations. Rather than placing extreme demands on\nindividuals, we would be better off in only donating our fair share to poverty relief efforts.\nA fair share argument stipulates that every individual in a community would be required to give\ntheir fair share towards alleviating the problem. Giving one\u2019s fair share can take a couple of different\nforms. It might involve, for example, donating money to poverty relief efforts. Suppose, for example,\nthat in order to alleviate global poverty, a total of 500 billion dollars is necessary. There are roughly 7\nbillion people on earth. Based on these numbers, if everyone were to give roughly $75 to global relief\nefforts, this would reach the 500-billion-dollar requirement. This means that, everyone would be\nrequired to give $75 to relief efforts, and no more.\nOf course, alleviating world poverty is not as simple as donating money. Other ways of\ncontributing might involve donating one\u2019s time to help those suffering from poverty by, for example,\nvolunteering one\u2019s time at an aid agency. If one does not give any money to poverty relief efforts, but\nspends some time helping organizations that work to alleviate poverty, then one could conceivably be\nsaid to contribute their fair share towards poverty relief efforts. Other actions might include protesting\norganizations, governments, and/or policies that contribute to the plight of the world\u2019s poor. Indeed,\ndoing so might be even more effective in alleviating poverty, as many of the world\u2019s poor are poor\nbecause of unjust actions and/or policies undertaken by multinational corporations, and working to fight\nagainst these actions and/or policies can be considered as one contributing their fair share towards\npoverty relief efforts.\nA fair share argument has a couple of advantages compared to Singer\u2019s argument. First, it\nemphasizes the role of the collective, rather than the individual. That is, a fair share argument\nemphasizes the role that other individuals have in acting to alleviate global poverty. Rather than placing\nextreme demands on individuals, a fair share argument recognizes that everyone has a part to play in\nrelieving global poverty, and this requires everyone to chip in and do their fair share. The responsibility\nis diffused among many different individuals, rather than placing extreme demands on any one\nindividual or groups of individuals.\nConsider, for example, a thought experiment I considered earlier. Suppose you are walking along\nthe beach and, in the ocean, you see millions of people who need saving. Based on Singer\u2019s argument, it\nwould seem that the individual would be required to jump in and save as many people as they could.\nHowever, under the fair share argument, we would be required to save our fair share of people, in unison\nwith other beach goers. We, the beach goers, could act collectively and save our fair share, while other\ngroups of individuals try to save their fair share. If we want to do more, we can, but this is not\nobligatory. Rather than making us feel guilty about not doing more, once we recognize that we have\ndone our fair share, we can return to pursuing our interests and projects that make our lives meaningful.\nThis leads into the second advantage of the fair share view. A fair share argument allows one to\ndevote time and resources to pursuing their own interests. Since one is only required to give their fair\nshare, individuals will have both time and resources to commit to pursuing things that are important to\nthem. Unlike Singer\u2019s argument, which will require us to keep giving until the point where we would be\nworse off if we gave any more, a fair share approach recognizes the importance of individual\u2019s interests.\nIn response to this fair share argument, a critic might raise the following point. While it is\ntheoretically sound to argue that everyone should contribute their fair share towards poverty relief\nefforts, the practicality of this approach is problematic. In some cases, individuals do not have the\nresources to contribute their fair share, and in others, individuals who do have the resources to contribute\n8 What Moral Obligations do we have (or not have) to Impoverished Peoples?\nB.M. Wooldridge 52 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nsimply do not contribute. In cases like these, it might be argued that we should do more than our fair\nshare. This does not mean we need to give until the point of marginal utility, like Singer argues, but it\nmight require us to go above and beyond our fair share.\nIn response to this critique, I should be clear in reiterating that contributing one\u2019s fair share\ntowards poverty relief efforts encompasses more than just monetary donations. So, if an individual does\nnot have the monetary resources to contribute their fair share, they can make up for this in other ways,\nlike volunteering their time or protesting unjust institutions and policies. In those cases where an\nindividual does have enough, but simply chooses not to donate, this can be offset by the supererogatory\n(good to do, but not morally required; in other words, going beyond your moral duties) contributions of\nothers. That is, there will almost inevitably be those individuals who contribute more than their fair\nshare, which can go some way towards making up for the failed contributions of others.\nImportantly, if we require others to contribute more than their fair share, this defeats the very\nidea behind the fair share requirement. The fair share argument emphasizes that poverty is a problem\nbest resolved, or mitigated, through the collective actions of others. And this can best be accomplished, I\nargue, through a fair share requirement, where each individual contributes a portion of their money\nand/or time to helping those suffering from poverty. If everyone does this, we can more effectively\nachieve poverty relief. But if we require individuals to go beyond their fair share, then this might\nmotivate individuals to not contribute in the first place. If, for example, we are required to donate our\nfair share, why would we if we knew beforehand that if we do not contribute our fair share, some other\nindividual or group of individuals would make up for it by doing more than their fair share? Such an\napproach would destroy the foundation of a fair share agreement. The sooner we recognize that poverty\ncan best be resolved through the collective actions of others, the sooner we can work together towards\nending poverty throughout the world.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Do we have a stronger obligation to those suffering from poverty who are geographically closer to us,\nas opposed to those suffering from poverty in another nation? Why or Why not?\n2. Is the drowning child example a good thought experiment to use in discussing our moral obligations\nto the poor? What are some strengths and weaknesses of this thought experiment?\n3. What is the difference between absolute poverty and relative poverty? Do we have more of an\nobligation to help those suffering from absolute poverty? Why or Why not?\n8 What Moral Obligations do we have (or not have) to Impoverished Peoples?\nB.M. Wooldridge 53 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n9\nEuthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis1\n1. Introduction\nSadly, there are people in very bad medical conditions who want to die. They are in pain, they are\nsuffering, and they no longer find their quality of life to be at an acceptable level anymore. Given all\nthat, they want their lives to end: they want to be out of their misery. Some of these people are kept alive\nby machines or other medical treatments. If these machines were turned off or the medical interventions\nstopped, these people would die.\nCan it be morally permissible, or not wrong, to turn off these machines or stop treatment and so\nlet someone die, in circumstances like these? Many people think it can be. They believe that, morally,\nwe do not have to do everything we can to keep someone alive, no matter their quality of life or what\nthey want. Indeed, sometimes keeping someone alive, when they could be allowed to die, would be\nwrong: we really should just let them die.\nHere I develop an argument for this view, that what\u2019s usually called \u201cpassive euthanasia\u201d can be\nmorally permissible. More interestingly though, I explain how the reasons in favor of passive euthanasia\nsuggest and support thinking that in some circumstances \u201cactive euthanasia\u201d is justified, so it can be OK\nto actively kill some patients, for example, by giving them an overdose of drugs that will painlessly end\ntheir lives. So, I argue that if you think it can sometimes be OK and appropriate to let some patients die,\nthen you should also think it can sometimes be OK and appropriate to actively kill some patients.\n2. Definitions\nLet\u2019s begin with some definitions to better understand the issues.\nFirst, our topic is euthanasia, which is sometimes called \u201cmercy killing.\u201d The word euthanasia\nrelates to the idea of a \u201cgood death.\u201d People typically seek euthanasia to avoid a very bad death full of\nagony, pain, and suffering and all that results from that: for example, people wracked with horrific pain\nmight not be able to meaningfully experience their final days or weeks with loved ones, due to the\nconstant agony: when you are in terrible pain, it\u2019s hard to talk, and listen, and share.\nThe most common type of euthanasia involves someone euthanizing someone else. Another type\ninvolves someone performing euthanasia on themselves, or euthanizing themselves: this is a type of\nsuicide.\nEuthanasia is usually classified as three types: voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary:\n\u2022 Voluntary euthanasia involves a person who wants their life to end and communicates this\ndesire: the person wants to die and says so.\n1 Nathan Nobis is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Morehouse College, Atlanta GA.

Sometimes we know what such patients would have wanted for\nthemselves in situations like these, but usually we don\u2019t.\n\u2022 Involuntary \u201ceuthanasia\u201d involves someone who wants to stay alive and expresses this desire\nto stay alive. It is very important to be clear that if this person is killed this is not euthanasia, or\n\u201ca good death\u201d: in all or nearly all cases, this is murder or wrongful killing.\nThese three types of euthanasia can further be classified as \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d:\n\u2022 \u201cPassive\u201d euthanasia involves \u201callowing\u201d someone to die; it involves \u201cletting\u201d someone die; the\nperson who lets the person die is not the cause of the death, the medical condition is.\n\u2022 \u201cActive\u201d euthanasia involves \u201cdoing something\u201d; it involves killing; it involves being the cause\nof the death.\nWe will soon see that these common ways of distinguishing active and passive euthanasia aren\u2019t entirely\nclear.\nHere we will only discuss arguments about voluntary euthanasia, but readers can thoughtfully\nextend that discussion to the unique circumstances of non-voluntary euthanasia. Since involuntary\neuthanasia, passive or active, is generally wrong, it won\u2019t be discussed further.\n3. An Argument for Passive Euthanasia\nCan it be morally permissible to let someone die, or perform voluntary passive euthanasia? The options\nare \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no.\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 suggests that we must always do everything we can to keep someone alive, even if they are\nmiserable, want to die, and say so. To many, that\u2019s just cruel. If a dog or cat were in a similar condition,\nwe would do the merciful and humane thing and put them out of their misery: this is perhaps the one\nway that animals are often treated better than humans.\nThe judgment that \u2018yes, it can be OK to let someone die\u2019 can be supported by both\nconsequentialist (or utilitarian) and Kant-inspired moral reasoning. What Kant himself argued about\nthese issues might be different from what\u2019s argued here: Kant sometimes applied his own moral\nprinciples to practical issues in unconvincing ways.\nFor the consequentialist, the person being out of their misery is a better consequence for them,\nand overall, than their staying alive: killing them decreases the net unhappiness, pain, and badness in the\nworld. For the Kantian, letting them die respects their autonomy (or personal self-governance): we\nshould respect people\u2019s decisions about profound issues in their own lives. Given their reasonable\ndesires, respecting their wishes treats them as \u201cend in themselves,\u201d but forcing them to live in their\nunwanted condition treats them as a \u201cmere means\u201d toward our own ends, not their own.\n\u2018Yes\u2019 can also be supported by spelling out conditions in which it can be OK to let someone die.\nWe begin with an \u2018if\u2019 and develop a moral principle:\nIf\u2026\n9 Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis 55 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n\u2022 someone is dying, and\n\u2022 is in horrible pain and suffering, and\n\u2022 that pain and suffering cannot be relieved, and\n\u2022 that person wants to die and clearly says so, and\n\u2022 informed, thoughtful and caring people agree that the person would be better off no\nlonger living\u2026,\nthen it can be permissible to let that person die.\nTo many people, a principle like this seems plausible. And it justifies passive euthanasia in many\ncircumstances.\nThe details of a principle like this, however, take us to harder questions about euthanasia, harder\nthan those that arise in most circumstances: for examples, what if someone wants to die now but isn\u2019t\ncurrently in horrible pain and suffering, or is expecting to die, but many years later after a very slow\ndecline? Should anyone else have \u201csay\u201d over your own life or judge whether some pain and suffering is\n\u201chorrible enough\u201d for you to reasonably wish to die? If so, who? What if someone isn\u2019t dying and\ndoesn\u2019t even have a bad medical condition but just finds their life not worth living and so wants to die\n(and so, say, plans to starve themselves to death or do other things that will result in their death)? These\nharder questions, and others, would need to be addressed for a complete defense of this or similar\nprinciples and any arguments based on them.\nIn sum, a basic case for passive euthanasia can be supported by utilitarian, Kantian and common-\nsense moral thinking. Let\u2019s consider two objections before moving on to the case for active euthanasia.\n3.1. First, some claim that pain can always be controlled, and patients always kept comfortable, so\nthere is never a need to let anyone die (or, of course, actively kill them).\nIn reply, medical professionals try their best to control pain and make patients comfortable and they\noften are effective. But the insistence that pain can always be made bearable for everyone is,\nunfortunately, not true: some patients\u2019 pains cannot be controlled to their own satisfaction.\n3.2. Second, some argue that \u201cmiracles\u201d are always possible, so there\u2019s always a chance that\nsomeone gets better and even survives, and so we shouldn\u2019t let patients die.\nThese hopes are understandable, but there are conditions that nobody has ever recovered from, and so\nthe chances are very slim. And we don\u2019t usually make important decisions based on very unlikely\nchances: for example, you could be in an unlikely car accident where a seatbelt harms you, rather than\nhelps you: nevertheless, wearing a seatbelt is the smart choice.\nAlso, no type of euthanasia, passive or active, would prevent a miracle, especially a genuine\nmiracle involving divine intervention: turning off the machines could be the occasion for a miraculous\nrecovery, and an overdose of painkillers could be miraculously transformed into life-saving medications.\nPeople hoping for a miracle shouldn\u2019t forget what miracles really could be.\n4. An Argument for Active Euthanasia\nThe basic argument for active euthanasia, that is, for intentionally killing people who, due to their\nmedical conditions, wish to be killed and say so is fairly simple.\nWe begin by reflecting on the basic reasons why passive euthanasia can be OK: it gets people\nout their misery and respects what they want for their own lives. \u201cLetting people die\u201d is a means toward\nthose ends or goals. However, these goals can be pursued more directly and immediately by actively\n9 Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis 56 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nkilling patients who wish to die. Letting people die often takes a long time, and that time will often be\nfilled with pain and suffering, which the patient wants to avoid. Killing people, when they want to be\nkilled, achieves the goals that they want, that is, to be out of their misery, more quickly and with less\npain. And that is what they want, so they get what they want, quicker.\nSo, the basic assumptions that less unwanted pain and suffering is typically better than more and\npeople\u2019s desires about profound matters affecting their own lives and deaths usually should be fulfilled\nsooner than later, and the fact that killing someone is often a more effective means towards those ends,\njustifies active euthanasia, at least in some circumstances.\n5. Objections: Potentially Relevant Differences Between Active and Passive Euthanasia\nThere are many objections to this type of reasoning, all intended to explain why active euthanasia is\nwrong but passive euthanasia can be permissible. Let\u2019s consider some of the most common.\n5.1. First, some claim that it\u2019s always wrong to intentionally kill someone, so passive euthanasia\ncan be OK but active euthanasia is wrong.\nIn reply, while we should agree that it\u2019s, at least, nearly always wrong to intentionally kill someone, we\nshould observe that most people want to live and do not currently have lives full of pain, suffering, and\nmisery. So, the rule against killing is good in general, but we can argue that there are justifiable\nexceptions to this rule and that euthanasia is one of them.\n5.2. Second, some argue that allowing active euthanasia puts us on a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to\nmurdering patients, and people in general, who are not in challenging medical circumstances or\ndo not want to die. That\u2019s wrong, so we shouldn\u2019t allow euthanasia, which might lead to that.\nIn reply, we can rightly wonder why that would happen, since arguments for euthanasia are very specific\non the conditions where it might be permissible. They are especially clear that if someone wants to live,\nthey should not be euthanized.\nSlippery slope \u201carguments\u201d often assert \u201cDo this and something else bad might happen, so don\u2019t\ndo this!\u201d The keyword is \u2018might.\u2019 Here we have no good reason to think this bad thing would happen or\nthat it must happen or that nothing can be done to likely prevent it. We can, would and do implement\nsafeguards to prevent or lessen any bad results that are unlikely but might happen from any acceptance\nof euthanasia, just as we do with many other things that might lead to bad results if misused or abused.\n5.3. Third, some argue there is always an important (moral) difference between \u201callowing\u201d\nsomething to happen and \u201cdoing\u201d something, and so passive euthanasia is OK but active is not.\nWe might wonder if there is a clear distinction here. Consider this example:\nYou see that someone is about to unknowingly walk and fall into a deep pit in the ground. You\ncould easily warn them of the pit, but you keep quiet and they fall in and are seriously injured.\nYou tell yourself that if you had pushed them into the pit, you\u2019d be blameworthy, but since you\nhave \u201cdone nothing\u201d you are completely blameless.\nMany would find this judgment unbelievable: you did do something: what you did was stay silent and\nnot warn them of the pit. \u201cInaction\u201d is itself an action: doing nothing is doing something. Furthermore,\nwhat you did (in \u201cdoing nothing\u201d) was wrong. It would often be worse for you to push the person into\nthe pit yourself (or maybe not?), but your letting them fall in was wrong: you partially caused their\n9 Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis 57 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ninjury: had you acted differently, they wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt.\nExamples like these suggest that there are not clear moral or conceptual differences between\ndoing something and allowing something to happen. The objection above mistakenly assumes there are.\n5.4. There\u2019s an important (moral) difference between killing and letting die, and so passive\neuthanasia is OK but active is not.\nThis final objection is similar to the previous. James Rachels famously responds with an example like\nthis:\nAn evil aunt will inherit lots of money if her five-year-old nephew dies. She plans to drown him\nin the bathtub and make it look like an accident. She will get away with it. He just started his\nbath and she\u2019s on her way to the bathroom to drown him. She opens the bathroom door and is\ndelighted to see that he has slipped in the bathtub and is drowning. She watches, ready to push\nhim under if he steadies himself and is able to save his own life. But, as her luck would have it,\nhe doesn\u2019t and so he drowns. She never touches him throughout the ordeal and inherits the cash,\nnever telling a soul what happened.\nWhat an awful story. What an awful aunt. Her motives were awful and what she did was wrong. If she\nexplained that she didn\u2019t \u201cdo anything,\u201d that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong, that, at best, she merely \u201clet\nsomeone die\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not like she killed anyone! \u2013 she is profoundly mistaken: letting someone die can be\njust as bad (or nearly as bad) as killing someone. We might even say that a way to kill someone is to let\nthem die.\nThe objection here depends on a clear moral distinction between killing and letting die. There is\nno such distinction.\n5.5. Mistakes are possible, so we shouldn\u2019t allow euthanasia.\nA final objection is not to the ethics of euthanasia per se, but whether, as a social or legal policy, it\nshould be allowed: it\u2019s possible that we could think an action is, or can be, morally permissible, but that\nfor various reasons, as society we shouldn\u2019t allow it.\nThe concern is that where active euthanasia is allowed, some people who should not be killed\ncould be killed. This is true: this is a possibility. It\u2019s also true that where passive euthanasia is allowed,\nsome people could be let die who should be kept alive. The argument is that since mistakes and\nwrongdoing regarding euthanasia are always possible, we should not allow it as a society. (This is\nconsistent with thinking that euthanasia is sometimes morally permissible).\nIn reply, we cannot ignore the opposing truth that if euthanasia is not allowed, that would result\nin mistakes and wrongdoing also: people would be wrongly kept alive, and wrongly forced to endure\nmore suffering than they can bear and their deepest desires for their own lives disrespected.\nThese possible mistakes, unlike the possible mistakes in allowing euthanasia, however, cannot be\ncorrected or addressed by any safeguards or precautions, if euthanasia is not allowed. The wisest\nstrategy then is to allow euthanasia, with limits and safeguards, and work to ensure that any mistakes\nand wrongdoing are minimized, and hopefully prevented completely.\n6. Conclusions\nThere are, of course, more objections to these arguments, and other important arguments and concerns to\ndiscuss, and factual information to review, to have genuinely responsible views about these matters: this\n9 Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis 58 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nessay is just a start.\nThese issues of this essay are important and not just for people currently facing difficulties where\neuthanasia might be part of the response. These issues are important to all of us since we have no idea\nwhat will happen to us, and our loved ones, years down the road, tomorrow, or even later today: an\naccident or illness might befall us that forces us to ask and answer hard questions about whether our\nlives are still worth living. While we hope these questions aren\u2019t forced on us, we should ask them now\nand work on answering them now, together and as individuals. Part of a good death is that it is an end of\na good life, and an opportunity to begin a better life is always now.\nReference\nJames Rachels, \u201cActive and Passive Euthanasia,\u201d New England Journal of Medicine 1975; 292: 78-80.\nFor Further Reading\nYoung, Robert, \u201cVoluntary Euthanasia\u201d, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2019\nEdition), Edward N.

Why or why not?\n9 Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing\nNathan Nobis 59 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n10\nAn Argument Against Capital Punishment\nNoah Levin1\nHorrendous crimes are committed and will continue to be committed. Even before clear legal\nsystems existed, people wanted to see perpetrators properly punished for the crimes they committed, and\nthe more heinous the crime, the worse the punishment. Rape, murder, torture, and molestation will\nalways be at the top of the list of crimes that are intolerable, as they are all gross violation of another\u2019s\nautonomy. I could describe a crime that would make anyone\u2019s blood boil and ignite a rage for vengeance\non the criminal that had the coldness to carry out such a depraved act. I will spare the reader such a\nstory, but you can imagine the types of crimes I am referring to. Once we catch a person that would do\nsuch a thing, the next issue we are faced with is clear: What do we do with this person? How do we\npunish them? Historically, execution, also known as capital punishment, has been used widely for many\ncrimes. Today, it is reserved for the worst of the worst crimes and criminals in countries where it is used.\nHowever, many countries (notably, all of Europe except for Belarus) have either outlawed the\npunishment or chosen not to implement it. We thus ought to consider whether, in today\u2019s world, we\nshould ever execute criminals.\nWhile some crimes and criminals might deserve to be executed for their crimes, it is not a\npenalty that we should continue to implement, especially in the United States of America. There are four\nreasons for this: 1) the justice system is flawed, and with the finality of death, we should avoid\npunishments that cannot be properly compensated for; 2) on top of variations in prosecutors in seeking\nthe death penalty, there are worrisome geographic and racial variations in the implementation of capital\npunishment that mean it is not applied fairly; 3) it is sought and carried out infrequently; and, 4) the\nUnited States is one of the few \u201cWestern\u201d countries to still have it, and abolishing it would put the USA\nin-step with its closest allies and provide an important expression of moral fortitude.\nMy arguments will hinge on one major claim: a life behind bars would appear to be an equally\njust punishment when compared to the death penalty. While one has actual life, there is no freedom to\ngo with it. The value of living might be completely removed if one is behind bars forever, making this\npunishment on equal footing to death. The Spanish phrase for life imprisonment is the poetic cadena\nperpetua, which literally translates to \u201cperpetual chain,\u201d a reminder that the focus of such punishment\nisn\u2019t on living, but being imprisoned. In both prison and death freedom is removed, and never living free\nagain is a fate that is akin to death, as any semblance of a quality life can only be a farce. On top of this,\nshould there be good reason to do so, we can always lessen the term of the punishment and release the\nprisoner. Additionally, as the Dread Pirate Roberts told Westley in The Princess Bride, \u201cGood night,\nWestley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning,\u201d there would remain the\npossibility of execution in the future if justice demands it (notwithstanding potential legal problems with\naltering a punishment); but we can\u2019t bring someone back to life (yet) if we execute them and regret it.\nThis doesn\u2019t illustrate that execution is wrong, but shows a technical way that life imprisonment can be\nadvantageous. In any event, it is unclear to me that execution is the only appropriate punishment for the\n1 Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College. He may be reached at nlevin@gwc.cccd.edu.

My reasoning is simple: it is unclear whether life in\nprison or the death penalty is more costly overall, as the likelihood of a shorter time spent in prison is\noffset by the increased costs of housing the prisoner and the longer court processes (such as multiple\nappeals) required for capital punishment. Of the many studies that have occurred and the analyses of the\nstudies, there is no clear answer to the question of which one costs more, as costs per trial vary greatly\nbased upon the details of the trial, and where it is carried out, as well as the overall costs of housing or\nexecuting an individual prisoner in a specific prison. Even if there were an answer, it is beside the point:\nif the death penalty is the only just punishment, then we ought to implement it since it would be\nappropriate to do so. It is very costly to put a car thief into prison, and a lot cheaper to implement the\nreligious punishment of removing a hand. But it is often deemed inappropriate to do the latter, as\nmutilation is a permanent disfigurement that is particularly cruel. A few years of lost freedom (and\nmaybe a monetary fine) are now deemed to be much more just.\nWhy should we execute people and for what crimes? There are three main reasons that hold\nphilosophical value: justice, deterrence, and the impossibility of rehabilitation. The first, and most\nimportant, reason is that the criminal deserves to die. The act they have committed is so depraved and\ncaused such harm, execution is the only way we can fairly punish the offender. If we kill people for\nawful crimes, then the threat of punishment also can function as a deterrent. If you might be killed for\ndoing something awful, perhaps you\u2019ll refrain from doing it. Lastly, what should we do with those\npeople that are so depraved they are beyond rehabilitation? Some people will just continue to do bad\nthings, and will not, by their own admission, stop. Experts can interview them and concur. They are lost,\nthere is no hope, and they may even see death as just and preferable. Certainly these people should be\nexecuted. On top of all of this, it gives the families of victims justice and satisfies our primal hunger for\nrevenge.\nTo turn back to my primary reasons for advocating for the abolition of the death penalty in the\nUnited States, my first claim is that given the finality of the punishment and the potential of executing\ninnocent individuals, we ought to avoid it. Let\u2019s assume this occurs, and an innocent person was\nexecuted. Let\u2019s also assume that execution is appropriate for certain crimes. Would executing one\ninnocent person be worth executing all of the actually guilty individuals that would come to have the\npunishment of execution? After all, we allow emergency vehicles to violate all sorts of traffic laws,\nresulting in the occasionally fatal, and likely avoidable, accident. We believe this cost is worth it\nbecause it means that more people, on the whole, are saved. Is execution so appropriate and so important\nthat there are no suitable alternatives or that the only alternatives are actually, all-things-considered,\nsignificantly less just?\nTo alleviate this concern, someone might be quick to point out that no person has been executed\nand later been found to be innocent since the United States restarted capital punishment in 1977. As of\nthis writing, 161 people have been exonerated before execution (out of approximately 7,800) making the\nwrongful sentencing rate at least 2% (for updated information on this and all of the statistics mentioned\nin this work, visit http://deathpenaltyinfo.org). Of course, there is little reason to find out if someone was\nactually innocent after they have died, so those sentenced to death that die before, or as a result of,\nexecution are unlikely to be exonerated, should they actually be innocent. All crimes carry the chance of\nwrongful convictions, but most of the punishments can, at least in theory, be compensated for, assuming\nthat the value of money can be comparable to the value of time. There is no compensation for a dead\nperson that the person will directly benefit from. As such, the risk of executing an innocent person is too\ngreat, especially when life in prison would appear to be a fitting alternative.\n10 An Argument Against Capital Punishment\nNoah Levin 61 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThere is extreme variation on the implementation of the death penalty across racial and\ngeographic lines and its application is very dependent on the prosecutor. Where the death penalty is\nallowed, if you are a black male that killed a white female during a robbery, the odds of receiving the\ndeath penalty over a white male that tortured a black female before death are significant, and both are\nmuch greater than a white woman that tortured then killed a black man (I don\u2019t know the exact number\nsince no one has crunched the numbers on all of these, but consider that less than 2% of all death row\ninmates are women despite committing roughly 10% of eligible homicides and that black males are 97%\nmore likely to get the death penalty when they kill a white person over a black person). The race of the\nperpetrator and the victim both influence whether the death penalty is sought and applied. Justice is\nsupposed to be blind, and even if everyone who got the death penalty deserved it, the application of it is\nunfair. This should be concerning.\nThe death penalty is sought in less than 1% of eligible cases. This statistic speaks for itself:\ncapital punishment is rarely sought as a punishment even in cases where it can be used. Capital\npunishment will work as a deterrent if it actually deters, but since it is rarely used, it would be\nreasonable for criminals to believe they would not be executed if they commit capital crimes, and thus\nunlikely to work as a deterrent. For the threat of capital punishment to clearly work as a deterrent, it\nshould be implemented a lot more frequently than it is. As there is no consensus in the research on\nwhether it is effective as a deterrent, relying upon this reason to support maintaining the death penalty is\nproblematic.\nFinally, abolishing the death penalty in the United States would send a very important symbolic\nand humanitarian message: we stand with the rest of the NATO countries and majority of the world (and\nmove away from being the country with the third most executions behind China and Saudi Arabia) in\ndeciding not to systematically execute people in the name of justice. European countries did not disavow\nthe death penalty because it was inappropriate, but rather many did so because of all the practical\nconcerns I have laid out. If it is unfair in how it is used, then it shows the legal system disrespects its\nown desire for impartiality. It undermines the integrity of the legal and justice system itself.\nYet, there is still something to be said for keeping the death penalty in light of all of my reasons\nfor abolishing it.2 Despite my claims that life in prison is just as bad as execution, many people disagree\nwith this. Importantly, many criminals that face these punishments might disagree with it. The threat of\nexecution could motivate criminals to cooperate and accept guilt more frequently, sparing us both the\ncosts of seeking conviction and avoiding the possibility that they are found innocent (this is assuming\nthat they really are guilty). Beyond this, people spending life in prison might not have anything other\nthan their lives to lose, so keeping capital punishment gives them one final thing to fear and thereby\nprevent them from continuing to do awful things behind bars. Lastly, there might not be any value to the\npositive expression of our moral fortitude that abolishing the death penalty might bring with it. In fact,\nkeeping it might be more expressive by saying that we will never tolerate extremely depraved acts.\nI concede that each of these arguments provides a good reason to keep the death penalty on the\ntable. Indeed, the fact it is rarely used is irrelevant for each of these arguments: it\u2019s on the table as a\npossible punishment, and that\u2019s what matters. However, the finality of the death penalty doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily have to be the goalpost. We do not chain people to walls until they die in prison: inmates in\nprison for life are afforded some amount of pleasure and freedom behind walls, at the very least, in\nhopes of reform and an existence that contributes positively to society. We are also not heartless and can\nrecognize the humanity in even the most hardened criminals. Thus, there can be (and are) varying\n2 I would like to thank Douglas E. Hill for bringing these responses to my attention.\n10 An Argument Against Capital Punishment\nNoah Levin 62 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ndegrees of freedom one may be privileged to while imprisoned, and the threat of continued loss of\nfreedoms could be used as motivating factors in lieu of execution. To the last objection, that we do not\nneed to show anything to our Western allies or make any statements on punishment (and that having the\ndeath penalty might even be the statement we should be making), I\u2019d like to point out that execution is\nthe only punishment we have that intentionally inflicts direct physical harm on a criminal. We no longer\nlash people, use medieval torture devices, or otherwise use methods with the intention of inflicting\nphysical harm. While we restrain and restrict, the purpose of all other types of punishments and\nincarcerations are not to physically harm. If physical harm comes, it is an unintended consequence.\nAbolishing the death penalty, the last bastion of physical violence as a punishment, illustrates that we\nhave moved beyond intentionally inflicting physical harm as a form of punishment.\nOn March 12, 2019, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, issued a moratorium on\nexecutions during his governorship. This means that while he is governor, no one will be executed and\neveryone on death row will be treated as if they are in prison for life. Future governors can restart\nexecutions, however. This move was met some anger, with the loudest shouting two things: (1) voters\nhave constantly reiterated the desire for the death penalty and the governor disregarding this is\noverreaching on his part, and (2) that certain people deserve to die as a result of their crimes, and the\njustice system has confirmed this. The former argument is one about the political structure of the state\nand where powers lie, and while I can be sympathetic to this viewpoint, the facts are that the governor\nhas the power to take the actions he did, an ability he has in order to maintain a proper system of checks\nand balances. Whether the system is actually balanced is a separate issue and not one I need to tackle\nright now. The second reason had people advocating for the killing of other human beings. It struck me\nas odd that the cause they are getting riled up about is one that involves such an act of violence. It feels\nas if we have lost our humanity if we scream and fight so that we may kill another person in the name of\nthe law, because there is no other action that could possibly bring justice. It might be the only way to get\nrevenge, but the law should not be used for revenge. I do believe that some crimes are worthy of such a\nsentence, but it is not something worth fighting for, especially when the alternative of life in prison is a\nsufficient proxy. I fully sympathize with the families of victims and in no way want to ignore the\nawfulness of the crimes these people committed, but fighting for someone else to die in the name of\njustice does not promote the values we ought to promote as a modern society.\nTo summarize, while some crimes are heinous enough that the offender can be deserving of\ncapital punishment, implementing execution is riddled with too many problems and complications to be\nmorally appropriate in today\u2019s world. It should thus be abolished because the alternative of life in prison\nis an acceptable replacement.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Do you think there are certain crimes where execution is appropriate? If so, which ones and why? If\nnot, why not?\n2. Assume that execution is the appropriate punishment for some crimes. Should it be used? Why or\nwhy not?\n3. Is execution a \u201ccruel\u201d or \u201cunusual\u201d punishment? Why or why not?\n10 An Argument Against Capital Punishment\nNoah Levin 63 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n11\nCommon Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob1\n1 Introduction\nAbortion is often in the news. In the course of writing this essay in early 2019, Kentucky, Mississippi,\nOhio, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri passed legislation to outlaw and criminalize abortions starting at\nsix to eight weeks in pregnancy, with more states following. Federal law, however, generally permits\nabortions, so it is unclear what the legal outcome here will be.\nAbortion is a political issue \u2013 with different political parties tending to have different perspectives on the\nissue \u2013 because abortion is a moral or ethical issue. (These two words mean the same thing).\nSome believe that abortions are typically morally permissible, or not wrong, and so believe that\nabortions should be legal. If doing something isn\u2019t wrong, it shouldn\u2019t be illegal: criminalizing actions\nthat aren\u2019t wrong is a form of injustice.\nOther believe that abortion is morally wrong, that it\u2019s often wrong, maybe nearly always or even always.\nSome people argue that even though they believe abortion is wrong, it should remain legal: after all, if\nevery morally wrong action was illegal, we would all be in jail! Seriously though, there are many actions\nthat are morally wrong, even really hurtful, that the government shouldn\u2019t try to prevent or punish. (You\ncan supply the potential examples to make the point). They might also think that, for a variety of other\nreasons, their personal moral views on the issues shouldn\u2019t be made into law for all.\nOthers argue that abortions are wrong and should be illegal. What types of wrongdoing should be\nillegal? This question isn\u2019t easy to answer: it\u2019s abstract and general. One answer is that seriously,\nextremely wrong actions should be illegal. This might seem plausible, since many illegal actions are\nseriously wrong, but since there are other very wrong actions that shouldn\u2019t be illegal, this answer isn\u2019t\nperfect.\n2 Defining \u201cAbortion\u201d\nAbortion might personally affect you or someone you know: you or a partner, spouse, relative or friend\nmay have had an abortion, have considered abortion, or will have an abortion. But what is an abortion?\n1 Nathan Nobis is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Morehouse College, Atlanta GA.

This work released under a CC-BY license.\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 64 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThere are a number of common definitions, some of which are better and others which are worse:\nDefinition 1: An abortion is the murder of an unborn baby or child.\nDefinition 2: An abortion is the intentional termination of a fetus to end a pregnancy.\nDefinition 3: An abortion is the intentional killing of a fetus to end a pregnancy.\nDefinition 3 is best. We\u2019ll explain why after we show the problems with the first two definitions.\n2.1 \u201cMurdering Babies\u201d\nDefinition 1 is common with certain groups of people, but even people who think abortion is wrong\nshould reject it.\n\u201cMurder\u201d means \u201cwrongful killing,\u201d and so this definition implies that abortion is wrong by definition,\nwhich it isn\u2019t. This definition means that to know that abortion is wrong, we\u2019d just need to reflect on the\nmeaning of the word, and not give any reasons to think this. Murder is wrong by definition, but to know\nthat any particular killing is murder, we need arguments. (Compare someone who calls the death penalty\nmurder: we know it\u2019s killing, but is it wrongful killing? We can\u2019t just appeal to the definition of\n\u201cmurder\u201d: we need arguments that this is wrongful killing). This definition also means that someone\nwho claims that abortion is not wrong says that \u201cWrongful killing is not wrong,\u201d which makes no sense.\nWe can even call this a \u201cquestion-begging\u201d definition, since it assumes that abortion is wrong, which\ncan\u2019t be assumed. So this definition is problematic, even if abortion is wrong.\nDefinition 1 also describes fetuses as \u201cbabies\u201d or \u201cchildren.\u201d While people are usually free to use\nwhatever words how they want, people can say things that are false: calling something something\ndoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s really that thing. And the beginnings of something are usually not that thing: a pile of\nlumber and supplies is not a house; fabric, buttons and thread are not a shirt, and an embryo or early\nfetus is not a baby or child. So it\u2019s false and misleading to call embryos and early fetuses \u201cbabies\u201d or\n\u201cchildren.\u201d\nDefining abortion in terms of \u201cbabies\u201d seems to again result in a \u201cquestion-begging\u201d definition that\nassumes that abortion is wrong, since it is widely and correctly believed that it\u2019s wrong to kill babies.\nWe understand, however, that it\u2019s wrong to kill babies because we think about born babies who are\nconscious and feeling and have other baby-like characteristics: these are the babies we have in mind\nwhen we think about the wrongness of killing babies, not early fetuses. Describing early fetuses as\n\u201cbabies\u201d characterizes them either as something they are not or, at least, assumes things that need to\nargued for, which is misleading, both factually (in terms of what fetuses are like) and morally (insofar as\nit\u2019s assumed that the rules about how babies should be treated clearly and straightforwardly apply to,\nsay, embryos).\nPart of the problem with this definition is that terms like \u201cbabies\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d encourage strong\nemotional responses. Babies and children are associated with value-laden terms such as innocence,\nvulnerability, preciousness, cuteness, and more. When we refer to unborn human beings as fetuses, some\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 65 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\npeople become defensive because they see the word \u201cfetus\u201d as cold and sterile. But \u201cfetus\u201d is merely a\nhelpful, and accurate, name for a stage of development, as is \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cadolescent,\u201d and \u201cadult.\u201d\nDistinguishing different stages of human development doesn\u2019t commit anyone to a position on abortion,\nbut it does help us understand what an abortion is.\nIn sum, defining abortion in terms of \u201cmurdering babies\u201d is a bad definition: it misleads and assumes\nthings it shouldn\u2019t. Even those who think that abortion is wrong should not accept it.\n2.2 \u201cTermination\u201d\nThe second definition describes abortion as an intentional action. This is good since a pregnant woman\ndoes not \u201chave an abortion\u201d if her pregnancy ends because of, say, a car accident. And \u201cspontaneous\nabortions\u201d or miscarriages are not intentional actions that can be judged morally: they just happen.\nDefinitions, however, are supposed to be informative, and the vague word \u201ctermination\u201d doesn\u2019t inform.\nIf someone had literally no idea what an abortion was, it would be fair for them to ask what\u2019s exactly\ninvolved in a \u201ctermination\u201d of a pregnancy. A discussion between persons A and B \u2013 who knows\nnothing about abortion \u2013 might go like this:\n\u201cThere is a pregnant woman (or girl) who does not want to have a baby, a living baby, obviously.\nAnd so we are going to do something to something insider her \u2013 that is developing into that\nliving baby \u2013 so she does not have that baby. The action we are going to do is the \u2018termination.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat something inside her, developing into that living baby, it is living?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It started from a living egg and sperm cell.\u201d\n\u201cSo you are making something living not living, right? That sounds like killing something,\nright?\u201d\nPerson B\u2019s reasoning seems correct: abortions do involve killing. The word \u201ctermination\u201d obscures that\nfact and so makes for an unclear definition. This doesn\u2019t make the definition wrong; to \u201cterminate\u201d\nsomething means to end it in some way, and abortion ends the development of a fetus. But it doesn\u2019t say\nhow abortion ends that development and so is not ideal.\nWhy might someone accept this definition? Probably because they are reasoning this way:\nKilling is wrong. So if abortion is killing, then it\u2019s wrong. But I don\u2019t believe that abortion is\nwrong, or I am unsure that abortion is wrong, so I don\u2019t want to call it a \u2018killing,\u2019 since that\nmeans it\u2019s wrong.\nThe problem here is the first step. Not all killing is wrong. Lots of killing is perfectly fine and raises no\nmoral issues at all: killing mold, killing bacteria, killing plants, killing fleas, killing random cells and\ntissues (even ones that are human, say cheek cells or skin cells), and more. We don\u2019t even need to\nobserve that it\u2019s sometimes not wrong to kill adult human beings to make the point that not all killing is\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 66 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwrong.\nThis means that it\u2019s not problematic to define abortion in terms of \u201ckilling.\u201d The important questions\nthen are, \u201cIs abortion wrongful killing, or killing that\u2019s not wrong?\u201d and \u201cWhen, if ever, might it be\nwrongful killing and when, if ever, might it be permissible killing? And why?\u201d\n2.3 \u201cKilling\u201d\nA final definition understands abortion in terms of an intentional killing of a fetus to end a pregnancy.\nThis definition is accurate, informative since it tells us how the fetus would be \u201cterminated\u201d, and\nmorally-neutral: it doesn\u2019t assume that the killing involved in abortions is not wrong or that it\u2019s wrong.\nThis is a good definition.2\n3 Why Most Abortions Occur\nThe Guttmacher \u201cFact Sheet\u201d3 provides an overview of the research on why abortions occur and other\nrelevant information:\n- The reasons patients gave for having an abortion underscored their understanding of the\nresponsibilities of parenthood and family life. The three most common reasons\u2014each\ncited by three-fourths of patients\u2014were concern for or responsibility to other individuals;\nthe inability to afford raising a child; and the belief that having a baby would interfere\nwith work, school or the ability to care for dependents. Half said they did not want to be a\nsingle parent or were having problems with their husband or partner.\n- Fifty-one percent of abortion patients were using a contraceptive method in the month\nthey became pregnant, most commonly condoms (24%) or a hormonal method (13%).\n- Fifty-nine percent of abortions were obtained by patients who had had at least one birth.\n- Some 75% of abortion patients in were poor or low-income. Twenty-six percent of\npatients had incomes of 100\u2013199% of the federal poverty level, and 49% had incomes of\nless than 100% of the federal poverty level ($15,730 for a family of two).\nThis information suggests, at least, that if women were economically better off, had better access to\naffordable child-care and other forms of support, and had ready access to more reliable forms of\ncontraception, there would likely be fewer abortions.\n4 Bad Arguments: \u201cQuestion-Begging\u201d Arguments & \u201cEveryday\u201d Arguments\nWe\u2019ll now discuss some commonly given arguments about abortion that, unfortunately, are rather poor.\n2 Later, however, we will see another definition of abortion as the intentional withholding of what a fetus needs to live, to end\na pregnancy.\n3 https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 67 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n4.1 \u201cQuestion-begging\u201d Arguments\nMany common arguments about abortion are what\u2019s called \u201cquestion-begging,\u201d which means the reason\ngiven for the conclusion assumes that conclusion. This means that you wouldn\u2019t accept the reason as a\ngood reason to believe the conclusion unless you already believed that conclusion! This is circular\nreasoning, and arguments like this are always bad.\n4.1.1 \u201cAgainst\u201d Abortion:\nMany common arguments against abortion are question begging. Here are some:\nAbortion \u2013 killing fetuses to end pregnancies \u2013 is wrong because:\n(1) abortion is murder;\n(2) abortion is killing babies or children;\n(3) adoption is a better option than abortion;\n(4) pregnant women just must keep the pregnancy and give birth;\n(5) abortion should not be used as \u2018birth control\u2019;\n(6) women who have abortions are irresponsible;\n(7) a good person wouldn\u2019t have an abortion;\n(8) women who have abortions feel guilty.\nThese premises all assume that abortion is wrong. To explain:\n(1) assumes that killing fetuses is wrong, since \u201cmurder\u201d means wrongful killing;\n(2) assumes that fetuses are like babies and children and so are similarly wrong to kill;\n(3) assumes that abortion is a worse or bad option, since it assumes it is wrong;\n(4) assumes that women must not have abortions since it assumes they are wrong;\n(5) assumes that abortion is wrong: but if it is not wrong, while it might not be an ideal form\nof \u201cbirth control\u201d it could permissibly be used for that purpose;\n(6) assumes that women who have abortions are doing what they are not supposed to do,\ndoing wrong, and so are \u201cirresponsible\u201d;\n(7) assumes that abortion is wrong and so good people, who avoid wrongdoing, wouldn\u2019t\nhave one;\n(8) assumes that abortion is wrong and so assumes that some women feel guilty because they\nhave done something wrong: however, people can feel guilty even if they haven\u2019t done\nanything wrong, so guilt feelings aren\u2019t perfect evidence of wrongdoing (just as not\nfeeling guilty doesn\u2019t mean you did something that was OK).\nPeople would believe these claims only if they already believed abortion is wrong, so these claims\nshould not sway anyone who wants to think critically about the issues.\n4.1.2 \u201cFor\u201d Abortion:\nPeople who think abortion should be allowed also sometimes give question-begging arguments. Here are\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 68 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\na few:\nAbortion is not wrong because:\n(1) abortion is a personal choice; couples should be able to make that choice;\n(2) women have a (moral) right to have abortions;\n(3) women have the right to do what they want with their bodies;\n(4) well, if you don\u2019t like abortions, then don\u2019t have one!\n(5) those who oppose abortions just want to control women.\nThese premises likewise assume their conclusions. To explain:\n(1) the idea of a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d seems to be a choice that\u2019s not wrong to make: e.g., we\nwouldn\u2019t call a choice to be an ax-murderer a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d because that\u2019s wrong,\nwhereas what color socks to wear is a \u201cpersonal choice.\u201d So claims like this seem to just\nassume that abortion is not wrong or that it should be legal;\n(2) sometimes when people say that they have a moral right to do something, they are merely\nsaying that it\u2019s not wrong for them to do it. So this claim amounts to saying that abortion\nis not wrong because it\u2019s not wrong, which is question-begging. (If it\u2019s explained why\nwomen have this right, the argument might cease to be question-begging, however);\n(3) there are limits to rights, and sometimes we don\u2019t have the right to do what\u2019s wrong. If\nabortion were wrong, then perhaps women wouldn\u2019t have the right to have them, and this\nclaim just assumes abortions are not wrong;\n(4) consider an analogous slogan, \u201cDon\u2019t like arson? Then don\u2019t burn down any buildings!\u201d\nThis is absurd, because arson is wrong, and we don\u2019t offer slogans like this about actions\nthat are wrong. \u201cDon\u2019t like strawberries? Then don\u2019t eat them!\u201d makes sense since not\neating strawberries is not wrong. The slogan here assumes that abortion is not wrong;\n(5) since some wrongdoing should be \u201ccontrolled,\u201d those who offer this reason might merely\nassume that abortion is not a type of wrongdoing that should be illegal. They are also\nfocusing on other people\u2019s motives, which is often unwise: people who allegedly wish to\n\u201ccontrol\u201d women might respond or suspect that abortion advocates are motivated by the\ndesire to \u201cengage in immorality without consequences!\u201d (Is that true? No, pro-choice\nadvocates argue.) Accusations about motives are fruitless: it\u2019s better to engage the basic\nquestions of whether abortion is wrong or not and why, like we are doing here, instead of\nspeculating about motives.\nQuestion-begging arguments are common, on many issues \u2013 not just abortion, and they should be\nrejected, by everyone, always.\n4.2 \u201cEveryday\u201d Arguments\nNow we will discuss some other common arguments, that you might often hear or read about, that are\nalso poor but often not because they are question-begging. We\u2019ll begin with some arguments against\nabortion.\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 69 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n4.2.1 \u201cAgainst\u201d Abortion\n4.2.1.1 \u201cAbortion ends a life.\u201d\nPeople often ask, \u201cWhen does life begin?\u201d Some people wonder if fetuses are \u201calive,\u201d or when they\nbecome \u201clife.\u201d Some argue abortion is wrong because \u201clife begins at conception,\u201d whereas those who\nsupport abortion sometimes respond that \u201cfetuses aren\u2019t even alive!\u201d There are a lot of debates here, and\nto get past them, we need to ask what is meant by alive, living or a life.\nThis is often considered a \u201cdeep\u201d question, but it\u2019s not. Consider this: are eggs (in women) alive? Are\nsperm cells alive? Yes to both, and so when a sperm fertilizes an egg, what results is a biologically\nliving thing. Above, we defined abortion as a type of killing and, of course, you can only kill living\nthings. So, yes, fetuses are alive, biologically alive, from conception: they are engaged in the types of\nlife processes reviewed on page 1 of any biology textbook.\nSome people think that fetuses being alive shows that abortion is wrong, and so they enthusiastically\nargue that fetuses are biologically alive. Some who think that abortion is not wrong try to argue that\nfetuses are not even alive. These responses suggest concern with an argument like this:\n(1) Fetuses are biologically alive.\n(2) All things that are biologically alive are wrong to kill.\n(3) Therefore, fetuses are wrong to kill.\nThe second premise, however, is obviously false: uncontroversial examples show it. Mold, bacteria,\nmosquitos and plants are biologically alive, but they aren\u2019t wrong to kill. So, just as acknowledging that\nabortion involves killing doesn\u2019t mean that abortion is wrong, recognizing that biological life begins at\nconception doesn\u2019t mean that abortion is wrong either.\nNow, perhaps people really mean something like \u201cmorally significant life\u201d or \u201clife with rights,\u201d but\nthat\u2019s not people what say: if that\u2019s what they mean, they should say that.\n4.2.1.2 \u201cAbortion kills babies and children.\u201d\nClassifying fetuses as babies or children obscures any potentially relevant moral differences between,\nsay, a 6-week old fetus and a 6-day old baby or 6-year old child. This claim assumes that fetuses \u2013 at\nany stage of development \u2013 and babies are the same sort of entity. This claim involves loaded emotional\nlanguage, is inaccurate and is question-begging, as we discussed above in the section on definitions: this\nsaying doesn\u2019t contribute to a good argument.\n4.2.1.3 \u201cAbortion is murder.\u201d\nMurder is a term for a specific kind of killing. As a moral term, it refers to especially wrongful killing.\nAs a legal term, it refers to intentional killing that is both unlawful and malicious. Since abortion is legal\nin the US, most abortions cannot be legally classified as murder because they are not illegal or unlawful.\nMoreover, abortions don\u2019t seem to be done with malicious intent. When people claim that abortion is\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 70 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nmurder, what they seem to mean is either that abortion should be re-classified as murder or that abortion\nis wrong, or both. Either way, arguments are needed to support that, not question-begging slogans.\n4.2.1.4 \u201cAbortion kills innocent beings.\u201d\nFetuses are often described as \u201cinnocent,\u201d meaning that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being\nkilled. Since killing anyone innocent is wrong, this suggests that abortion is wrong. \u201cInnocence,\u201d\nhowever, seems to be a concept that only applies to beings that can do wrong and choose not to. Since\nfetuses can\u2019t do anything \u2013 they especially cannot do anything wrong that would make them \u201cguilty\u201d \u2013\nthe concept of innocence does not seem to apply to them. So saying that banning abortion would\n\u201cprotect the innocent\u201d is inaccurate since abortion doesn\u2019t kill \u201cinnocent\u201d beings: the concept of\ninnocence just doesn\u2019t apply.\n4.2.1.5 \u201cThe Bible says abortion is wrong.\u201d\nPeople often appeal to religion to justify their moral views. Some say that God thinks abortion is wrong,\nbut it\u2019s a fair question how they might know this, especially since others claim to know that God doesn\u2019t\nthink that. In reply, it is sometimes said that the Bible says abortion is wrong (and that\u2019s how we know\nwhat God thinks).\nBut the Bible doesn\u2019t say that abortion is wrong: it doesn\u2019t discuss abortion at all. There is a\ncommandment against killing, but, as our discussion above makes clear, this requires interpretation\nabout what and who is wrong to kill: presumably the Bible doesn\u2019t mean that killing mold or bacteria or\nplants is wrong. And there are verses (Exodus 21:22-24) that, on some translations, suggest that fetuses\nlack the value of born persons, since penalties for damage to each differ. This coincides with common\nJewish views on the issue, that the needs and rights of the mother outweigh any the fetus might have.\nHowever any verses are best interpreted, they still don't show that abortion is wrong. This is because the\nBible is not always a reliable guide to morality, since there are troubling verses that seem to require\nkilling people for trivial \u201ccrimes,\u201d allow enslaving people (and beating them), require obeying all\ngovernment officials and more. And Jesus commanded loving your neighbor as yourself, loving your\nenemies and taking care of orphans, immigrants and refugees, and offered many other moral guidelines\nthat many people regard as false.4 Simple moral arguments from the Bible assume that that if the Bible\nsays an action is wrong, then it really is wrong (and if the Bible says something\u2019s not wrong, it\u2019s not\nwrong), and both premises don\u2019t seem to be literally true.\nThis all suggests that people sometimes appeal to the Bible in selective and self-serving ways: they\ncome to the Bible with their previously-held moral assumptions and seek to find something in the Bible\n4 Appeals to the Bible and other sources (and people) considered to be an authority, leads to this dilemma: either there are\ngood reasons to accept that what that authority claims or not. If not, then we should not accept what the authority says. If\nthere are good reasons, then those reasons \u2013 which we all can discuss and debate \u2013 would be why we should accept what it\nsays, not because the \u201cauthority\u201d says so. These insights are applied to morally problematic verses of the Bible, since we\nhave good reasons to reject the moral guidance suggested by those verses. For discussion of these issues, which are related to\nthe \u201cEuthyphro dilemma\u201d that Socrates addressed, see Spencer Case\u2019s \u201cBecause God Says So: On Divine Command\nTheory,\u201d at https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2014/03/31/because-god-says-so/\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 71 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nto justify them.\nThere is an interesting Biblical connection here worth mentioning though. Some argue that if women\nwho want abortions are prevented from having them, that forces them to remain pregnant and give birth\nand that this is like forcing women to be like the \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d who went out of his way, at expense\nto himself, to help a stranger in great need (Luke 10:25-37). (The analogy is imperfect, as analogies\nalways are).\nThe problem is in no other area of life is anyone forced to be a Good Samaritan like a pregnant woman\nwould: e.g., you can\u2019t be forced to donate an organ to anyone in need (even to your child or parent); you\ncan\u2019t even be forced to donate your organs after you are dead! Nobody other than pregnant women\nwould be forced by the government \u2013 under threat of imprisonment or worse \u2013 to use their body to help\nsustain someone else\u2019s life. It is unfair to require women to be Good Samaritans but allow the rest of us\nto be like the \u201cpriest\u201d and \u201cLevite\u201d in the story who helped nobody.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s important to remember that laws should not be based on any particular religions. If\nyou are not, say, a Hindu, or a Buddhist, or a Rastafarian, you probably don\u2019t want laws based solely on\none of those religion\u2019s values. Laws should be religiously-neutral; on that we all should agree.\n4.2.1.6 \u201cAbortion stops a beating heart.\u201d\nThis claim, if given as an argument, assumes that stopping a beating heart is wrong. The assumption,\nhowever, is just obviously untrue: e.g., during open heart surgery, surgeons temporarily stop the\npatient\u2019s heart so that repair can be made to the still heart: they would permanently stop that heart if they\nreplace it with an artificial heart. If there were somehow an independently beating heart, attached to\nnobody, that heart wouldn\u2019t be wrong to stop. Whether a heart is wrong to stop or not depends on who is\naround that heart and their value or rights, not anything about that heart by itself. Finally, embryos and\nearly fetuses do not even have hearts, as critics of recent \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills have observed! (The heart\nfully develops much later in pregnancy.)\nIf, however, this widely expressed concern about a heartbeat isn't meant to be taken literally, but is\nmerely a metaphor or an emotional appeal, we submit that these are inappropriate for serious issues like\nthis one.\n4.2.1.7 \u201cHow would you like it if . .?\u201d\nSome ask, \u201cHow would you like it if your mother had had an abortion?\u201d Others tell stories of how their\nmother almost had an abortion and how they are grateful she didn\u2019t. Questions and stories like these\nsometimes persuade, but they shouldn\u2019t. Consider some other questions:\n(1) How would you like it if your mother had been a nun, or celibate, all her life?\n(2) How would you like it if your mother had moved away from the city where she met your\nfather, and they never met?\n(3) How would you like it if your father had decided early in life to have a vasectomy?\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 72 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nAll sorts of actions would have prevented each of our existences \u2013 if your parents had acted differently\nin many ways, you wouldn\u2019t be here to entertain the question: at best, someone else would be5 \u2013 but\nthese actions aren\u2019t wrong.\nSome might reply that if you had been murdered as a baby, you wouldn\u2019t be here to discuss it. True, but\nthat baby was conscious, had feelings, and had a perspective on the world that ended in being murdered:\nan early fetus is not like that. We can empathetically imagine what it might have been like for that\nmurdered child; we can\u2019t do that with a never-been-conscious fetus, since there\u2019s no perspective to\nimagine.\nIn sum, these are some common arguments given against abortion. They aren\u2019t good. Everyone can do\nbetter.\n4.2.2 Common Arguments \u201cFor\u201d Abortion\nMany common arguments \u201cfor\u201d abortion are also weak. This is often because they simply don\u2019t engage\nthe concerns of people who oppose abortion. Consider these often-heard claims:\n4.2.2.1 \u201cWomen have a right to do whatever they want with their bodies . . .\u201d\nAutonomy, your ability to make decisions about matters that profoundly affect your own life, is very\nimportant: it\u2019s a core concern in medical ethics. But autonomy has limits: your autonomy doesn\u2019t, say,\njustify murdering an innocent person, which is what some claim abortion is. The slogan that \u201cwomen\ncan do what they want . .\u201d does not engage that claim or any arguments given in its favor, so it\u2019s\ninadequate.\n4.2.2.2 \u201cPeople who oppose abortion are just trying to control women.\u201d\nThey might be trying to do this. But they might be trying to ban abortion because they believe that\nabortion is wrong and should be illegal. Speculations about motives don\u2019t engage or critique any\narguments they might give to think that. (If you doubt that thinking critically about arguments and\nevidence here would do any good, do they have any better ideas that might do more good?).\n4.2.2.3 \u201cMen shouldn\u2019t make decisions about matters affecting women.\u201d\nInsofar as women profoundly disagree on these issues, some women must be making bad decisions\nabout matters affecting women: all women can\u2019t be correct on the issues. And some men can understand\nthat some arguments (endorsed sometimes by both women and men) are bad arguments and give good\narguments on the issues. Someone\u2019s sex or gender has little to no bearing on whether they can make\ngood arguments about matters that affect them or anyone else. Furthermore, the existence of transgender\nmen who have given birth further undermines the thought that one sex or gender is apt to have more\ncorrect views here.\n5 For discussion of this question of what could have been different about the past such that you never existed, see Chad\nVance\u2019s \u201cOrigin Essentialism: What Could Have Been Different about You?\u201d at 1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory\nAnthology at https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2014/04/28/origin-essentialism/\n11 Common Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 73 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n4.2.2.4 \u201cWomen and girls will die if abortion isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d\nThis is true.

Again, this type of engagement is necessary for progress on these\nissues.\nIn sum, while we agree that people who think that abortion is generally not morally wrong and should be\nlegal are correct, they sometimes don\u2019t offer very good reasons to think this, just like the opponents of\nabortion. An analysis of the more nuanced reasons in favor of abortion provided by philosophers will\nyield proper support for this viewpoint.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

So, states are making bad moral and legal moves, to say the least,\nin trying to criminalize abortions, at least when they are done early in pregnancy, as they usually are.\n2 Arguments Against Abortion\nWe will begin with arguments for the conclusion that abortion is generally wrong, perhaps nearly\nalways wrong. These can be seen as reasons to believe fetuses have the \u201cright to life\u201d or are otherwise\nseriously wrong to kill.\n2.1 Fetuses are human\nFirst, there is the claim that fetuses are \u201chuman\u201d and so abortion is wrong. People sometimes debate\nwhether fetuses are human, but fetuses found in (human) women clearly are biologically human: they\naren\u2019t cats or dogs! And so we have this argument, with a clearly true first premise:\n(1) Fetuses are biologically human.\n(2) All things that are biologically human are wrong to kill.\n(3) Therefore, fetuses are wrong to kill.\nThe second premise, however, is false, as easy counterexamples show. Consider a blob of random living\nbiologically human cells or tissues in a petri dish. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong at all to wash those cells or\ntissues down the drain, killing them; scratching yourself or shaving might kill some biologically human\nskin cells, but that\u2019s not wrong; a tumor might be biologically human, but not wrong to kill. So just\nbecause something is biologically human, that doesn\u2019t at all mean it\u2019s wrong to kill that thing.\nA different meaning of \u201chuman\u201d will be discussed below: people who insist that (biologically human)\nfetuses aren\u2019t \u201chuman\u201d might mean \u201cperson\u201d or human person.\n1 Nathan Nobis is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Morehouse College, Atlanta GA.

(A kidney is part of a \u201cbeing,\u201d but the\n\u201cbeing\u201d is the whole organism). That suggests this argument:\n(1) Fetuses are human beings or organisms.\n(2) All human beings or organisms are wrong to kill.\n(3) Therefore, fetuses are wrong to kill, so abortion is wrong.\nThe first premise is true. About the second premise, clearly many human beings or organisms are wrong\nto kill. Why is this though? What makes us wrong to kill?\nIt is generally argued that this is because we, these human beings, are conscious and feeling: we are\naware of the world, have feelings and our perspectives can go better or worse for us \u2013 we can be harmed\n\u2013 and that\u2019s what makes killing us wrong. (It may also be not wrong to let us die, and perhaps even kill,\nif we come to be completely and permanently lacking any consciousness, however, say from major brain\ndamage or a coma, since we can\u2019t be harmed by death anymore.2) So, on this explanation, human beings\nare wrong to kill, when they are wrong to kill, not because they are human beings (a circular\nexplanation), but because we have these psychological or mental (or emotional) characteristics: this\nexplains why we have rights in a simple, common-sense way.\nThe challenge then is explaining why fetuses that have never been conscious or had any feeling or\nawareness would be wrong to kill. How can the second premise above, general to all human organisms,\nbe supported, especially when applied to early fetuses?\nOne attempt is argue that early fetuses are wrong to kill because there is continuous development from\nfetuses to us, and since we are wrong to kill now, fetuses are also wrong to kill, since we\u2019ve been the\n\u201csame being\u201d all along. But this can\u2019t be good reasoning, since we have many physical, cognitive,\nemotional and moral characteristics now that we lacked as fetuses (and as children). So even if we are\nthe \u201csame being\u201d over time, even if we were once early fetuses, that doesn\u2019t show that fetuses have the\nmoral rights that babies, children and adults have: we, our bodies and our rights sometimes change.\nA second attempt proposes that rights are essential to human organisms: they have them whenever they\nexist. This perspective sees having rights, or the characteristic(s) that makes someone have rights, as\nessential to human bodies: \u201chaving rights\u201d is an essential property of human beings or organisms: so\nwhenever there\u2019s a living human organism, there\u2019s someone with rights, even if that organism totally\nlacks consciousness, like an early fetus. (In contrast, our proposal about what makes us have rights\nunderstands rights as \u201caccidental\u201d to our bodies, since our bodies haven\u2019t always \u201ccontained\u201d a\nconscious being.) Such a view supports the premise above; maybe it just is that premise above.\nBut why believe it? Why believe that rights are essential to human organisms? Some argue this because\n2 See the essay \u201cEuthanasia, or Mercy Killing\u201d by Nathan Nobis (Chapter 9) in this volume. For a shorter version of that\nessay, see Euthanasia, or Mercy Killing by Nathan Nobis at 1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology.\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 76 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nof what \u201ckind\u201d of beings we are, which is often presumed to be \u201crational beings.\u201d The reasoning is, first,\nthat rights come from being a rational being. And, second, that all human organisms, including fetuses,\nare the \u201ckind\u201d of being that is a \u201crational being,\u201d so every being of the \u201ckind\u201d rational being has rights.\nThis explanation is, at least, abstract. It might seem to involve thinking that rights somehow \u201ctrickle\ndown\u201d from later rationality to our embryonic origins, and so what we have later we also have earlier,\nbecause we are the same being or same \u201ckind\u201d of being. But this idea is, in general, doubtful: we are\nnow responsible beings, in part because we are rational beings, but fetuses aren\u2019t responsible for\nanything: we are now able to engage in moral reasoning since we are rational beings, but fetuses don\u2019t\nhave the \u201crights\u201d that uniquely depend on moral reasoning abilities. Even if fetuses and us are the same\n\u201ckind\u201d of beings, that often doesn\u2019t tell us much about what rights fetuses would have, if any. And we\nmight even reasonably think that, despite our being the same kind of beings as fetuses, we are also\nimportantly different kinds of beings.\nIn sum, the abstract view that all human organisms have rights essentially needs to be plausibly\nexplained and defended. We need to understand how it really works. We need to be shown why it\u2019s a\nbetter explanation, all things considered, than a consciousness and feelings-based theory of rights that\nexplains why we, and babies, have rights, why racism, sexism and other forms of wrongful\ndiscrimination are wrong, and, importantly, how we might lose rights in irreversible coma cases (if\npeople always retained the right to life in these circumstances, presumably it would be wrong to let\nanyone die), and more.\n2.3 Fetuses are persons\nFinally, we get to what some see as the core issue here, namely whether fetuses are persons, and an\nargument like this:\n(1) Fetuses are persons, perhaps from conception.\n(2) Persons have the right to life and are wrong to kill.\n(3) Therefore, abortion is wrong, as it involves killing persons.\nThe second premise seems very plausible, but there are some important complications about it that will\nbe discussed later. So let\u2019s focus on the idea of personhood and whether fetuses are persons. What is it\nto be a person? One answer that everyone can agree on is that persons are beings with rights and value.\nThat\u2019s a fine answer, but it takes us back to the initial question: OK, who or what has the rights and\nvalue of persons? What makes someone or something a person?\nAnswers here are often merely asserted, but these answers need to be tested: definitions can be judged in\nterms of whether they fit how a word is used. We might begin by thinking about what makes us persons.\nConsider this:\nWe are persons now. Either we will always be persons or we will cease being persons. If we will\ncease to be persons, what can end our personhood? If we will always be persons, how could that\nbe?\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 77 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nBoth options yield insight into personhood. Many people think that their personhood ends at death or if\nthey were to go into a permanent coma: their body is (biologically) alive but the person is gone: that is\nwhy other people are sad (we hope!). And if we continue to exist after the death of our bodies, as some\nreligions maintain, what continues to exist? The person, perhaps even without a body! Both responses\nsuggest that personhood is defined by a rough and vague set of psychological or mental, rational and\nemotional characteristics: consciousness, knowledge, memories, and ways of communicating, all\npsychologically unified by a unique personality.\nA second activity supports this understanding:\nMake a list of things that are definitely not persons. Make a list of individuals who definitely are\npersons. Make a list of imaginary or fictional personified beings which, if existed, would be\npersons: these beings that fit or display the concept of person, even if they don\u2019t exist. What\nexplains the patterns of the lists?\nRocks, carrots, cups and dead gnats are clearly not persons. We are persons. Science fiction gives us\nideas of personified beings: to give something the traits of a person is to indicate what the traits of\npersons are. Even though the non-human characters from Star Wars don\u2019t exist, they fit the concept of\nperson: we can befriend them, work with them, and so on, and we could only do that with persons. A\ncommon idea of God is that of an immaterial person who has exceptional power, knowledge, and\ngoodness: you couldn\u2019t pray to a rock and hope that rock would respond: you could only pray to a\nperson. Are conscious and feeling animals, like chimpanzees, dolphins, cats, dogs, chickens, pigs, and\ncows more relevantly like us, as persons, or are they more like rocks and cabbages, non-persons?\nConscious and feeling animals seem to be closer to persons than not. So, this classificatory activity\nfurther supports a psychological understanding of personhood: persons are, at root, conscious, aware and\nfeeling beings.\nConcerning abortion, early fetuses would not be persons on this account: they are not yet conscious or\naware since their brains and nervous systems are either non-existent or insufficiently developed.\nConsciousness emerges in fetuses much later in pregnancy, likely after the first trimester. This is after\nwhen most abortions occur. Most abortions, then, do not involve killing a person, since the fetus has not\ndeveloped the characteristics for personhood. We will briefly discuss later abortions, that potentially\naffect fetuses who are persons, below.\nIt is perhaps worthwhile to notice though that if someone believed that fetuses are persons and thought\nthis makes abortion wrong, it\u2019s unclear why a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest would be a\nmorally justified abortion. Some people who oppose abortion argue that, since you are a person, it would\nbe wrong to kill you now even if you were conceived because of a rape, and so it\u2019s wrong to kill any\nfetus who is a person, even if they exist because of a rape: whether someone is a person or not doesn\u2019t\ndepend on their origins: it would make no sense to think that, for two otherwise identical fetuses, one is\na person but the other isn\u2019t, because that one was conceived by rape. Therefore, those who accept a\n\u201cpersonhood argument\u201d against abortion, yet think that abortions in cases of rape are acceptable, seem to\nhave an inconsistent view.\n2.4 Fetuses are potential persons\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 78 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nIf fetuses aren\u2019t persons, they are at least potential persons, meaning they could and would become\npersons. This is true. This, however, doesn\u2019t mean that they currently have the rights of persons because,\nin general, potential things of a kind don\u2019t have the rights of actual things of that kind: potential doctors,\nlawyers, judges, presidents, voters, veterans, adults, parents, spouses, graduates, moral reasoners and\nmore don\u2019t have the rights of actual individuals of those kinds.\nSome respond to that that potential gives the right to at least try to become something. But that trying\nsometimes involves the cooperation of others: if your friend is a potential medical student, but only if\nyou tutor her for many hours a day, are you obligated to tutor her? If my child is a potential NASCAR\nchampion, am I am obligated to buy her a racecar to practice? \u2018No\u2019 to both and so it is unclear that a\npregnant woman would be obligated to provide what\u2019s necessary to bring about a fetus\u2019s potential.\n2.5 Abortion prevents fetuses from experiencing their valuable futures\nThe argument against abortion that is likely most-discussed by philosophers comes from Don Marquis.3\nHe argues that it is wrong to kill \u201cnormal\u201d adults and children because it deprives us from experiencing\ntheir (expected to be) valuable futures. He argues that since fetuses also have valuable futures also\n(\u201cfutures like ours\u201d he calls them), they are also wrong to kill. His argument has much to recommend it,\nbut there are reasons to doubt it as well.\nFirst, fetuses don\u2019t seem to have futures like our futures, since \u2013 as they are pre-conscious - they are\nentirely psychologically disconnected from any future experiences: there is no (even broken) chain of\nexperiences from the fetus to that future person\u2019s experiences. Babies are, at least, aware of the current\nmoment, which leads to the next moment; children and adults think about and plan for their futures, but\nfetuses cannot do these things, being completely mindless and unconscious. This fact might even mean\nthat the early fetus doesn\u2019t literally have a future: if your future couldn\u2019t include you being a merely\nphysical, non-conscious object (e.g., you couldn\u2019t be a corpse: if there\u2019s a corpse, you are gone), then\nperhaps non-conscious physical objects, like a fetus, couldn\u2019t be a future person.4 If this is correct, early\nfetuses don\u2019t even have futures, much less futures like ours.\nA third objection is more abstract. It begins with the observation that there are single objects with parts\nwith space between them. Indeed almost everything is like that, if you could look close enough, not just\nsingle dinette sets: there is some space between the parts of normal physical objects. From this, it\nfollows that there seem to be single objects such as an-egg-and-the-sperm-that-would-fertilize-it. And\nthese would also seem to have a future of value, given how Marquis describes this concept. (It should be\nmade clear that sperm and eggs alone do not have futures of value: this is not the objection). But\ncontraception, even by abstinence, prevents that thing\u2019s future of value from materializing, and so seems\nto be wrong on Marquis\u2019s argument. Since contraception isn\u2019t wrong, it seems that preventing\nsomething from experiencing its valuable future isn\u2019t always wrong and so Marquis\u2019s argument appears\nto be unsound.\n3 Marquis, Don. \u201cWhy abortion is immoral.\u201d The Journal of Philosophy 86.4 (1989): 183-202.\n4 For discussion of this question of what you could and could not become, see Chad Vance\u2019s \u201cOrigin Essentialism: What\nCould Have Been Different about You?\u201d at 1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology at\nhttps://1000wordphilosophy.com/2014/04/28/origin-essentialism/\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 79 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nIn sum, these are some of the most influential arguments against abortion. Our discussion was brief, but\nthese arguments do not appear to be successful: they do not show that abortion is wrong, much less\nmake it clear and obvious that abortion is wrong.\n3 Arguments that abortion is often not wrong\nFinally, we turn to arguments that abortion is generally not wrong.\n3.1 No good arguments that it is wrong\nA first argument depends on the discussion so far. If you are familiar with the most important arguments\ngiven to believe that abortion is wrong, and believe with good reason that they are unsound, then that\ngives a reason to think that abortion is not wrong. In general, a good reason to think that an action is\npermissible is that there is no good reason to think it\u2019s wrong. How this general strategy is applied to\nthis issue depends on your evaluation of the arguments discussed above, and any other arguments\nagainst abortion that you think are worth critically evaluating.\n3.2 Early fetuses aren\u2019t conscious & feeling: personhood and harm\nThe next positive argument in defense of abortion depends on the scientific facts about early fetuses that\nwe have emphasized over and over: they are not conscious, are not aware of anything, cannot feel\nanything, and so on: they are and have been entirely mindless so far. The proposal is that beings like this\nare very different from beings like us and babies and children, who are conscious: despite being the\nsame kind of beings, we are also different kinds of beings.\nThese observations motivate these principles:\nIf a being is and has always been completely unconscious, it\u2019s definitely not a person. And if\nsomething is definitely not a person, then it\u2019s not wrong to kill it.\nThis proposal is supported by, among other sources, the idea that if someone permanently ceases to be a\nperson, it can be OK to bring about their death, perhaps even by killing their body, since their being\nalive is doing them no good. This is related to this proposal:\nIf a being is and has always been completely unconscious, it really cannot be harmed, which\nrequires some \u201cturn for the worse\u201d for that being. There is no \u201cfor that being,\u201d yet, so things\ncan\u2019t get worse for it. So killing doesn\u2019t harm it.\nGiven the fundamental moral significance of consciousness and all that results from that, that early\nfetuses lack it is highly relevant to how they can be treated.\n3.3 The right to life & the right to someone else\u2019s body\nFinally, suppose much of the above is mistaken and that fetuses indeed are persons with the right to life.\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 80 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nSome think that this clearly shows that abortion is wrong. Philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson famously\nargued in 1971 that this isn\u2019t the case. She observes that people often have a naive understanding of\nwhat the right to life is a right to. She makes her case with a number of clever examples. First, the\nviolinist:\nYou wake up in a hospital, \u201cplugged in\u201d to a famous violinist, who needs to use your kidneys to\nstay alive. You were kidnapped for this purpose. If you unplug, he will die. But it\u2019s only for nine\nmonths.\nDoes the violinist have a right to your kidneys? Do you violate his right to life if you unplug, and he\ndies? Most would say \u2018no\u2019, which suggests that the right to life is not a right to anyone else\u2019s body, even\nif that body is necessary for your life to continue. This suggests that fetuses, even if they were persons\nwith the right to life, would not have a right to the pregnant woman\u2019s body. So until there is a way to\nremove fetuses and place them in other wombs, women have a right to abortion. This even suggests\nanother definition:\nAbortion is the intentional withholding of what a fetus needs to live, to end a pregnancy.\nSome respond the violinist case is somewhat like a pregnancy that results from rape, since there\u2019s no\nconsent involved, but that pregnancies that don\u2019t result from rape do give fetuses the right to the\nwoman\u2019s body because, they argue, the woman has done something that she knows might result in\nsomeone existing who is dependent on her.\nWhile Thompson had cases to address this type of concern \u2013 if someone falls in your house because you\nopened a window, they don\u2019t have the right to be there, even though you did something that contributed\nto their being there \u2013 we should notice that the response appears to be question-begging. Compare doing\nsomething that results in the existence of a new plant that is dependent on you: you wouldn\u2019t be\nobligated to provide for that plant. To assume that things are different with fetuses is, well, to assume\nwhat can\u2019t be merely assumed, especially if we don\u2019t already believe that early fetuses are persons with\nthe right to life.\nIt should be made clear that even if the fetus doesn\u2019t have a right to the pregnant woman\u2019s body, there\ncould be other rights or other obligations that could make abortion wrong nevertheless: e.g., if\npregnancy were just 9 hours perhaps women would be obligated to be Good Samaritans towards them,\neven if fetuses didn\u2019t have a right to the woman\u2019s resources and assistance. What\u2019s important though is\nthe right to life and personhood are not the \u201cslam dunk\u201d against abortion that people often think they are.\n3.4 \u201cWhat ifs\u201d: Rape and later-term abortions\nWe are now in a good position to address some of the \u201cwhat if\u201d situations regarding abortions.\nFirst, rape: if early abortions are generally not wrong, then abortions due to rape are especially not\nwrong. While people sometimes consider rape a special excuse that justifies abortion, if abortions\ngenerally aren\u2019t wrong, no special excuse is needed. (It is worthwhile to notice that those who think that\nall fetuses are persons and so argue that abortion is wrong should think abortion is wrong in cases of\n12 Better (Philosophical) Arguments about Abortion\nNathan Nobis and Kristina Grob 81 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nrape also, since a person is a person, irrespective of their origins).\nSecond, later-term abortions: these might affect conscious and feeling fetuses badly, but fortunately\nthese abortions are rare and evidence suggest that they are done only for justifying medical reasons\n(Google for harrowing personal stories of women having later abortions, due to medical difficulties,\nincluding fetal abnormalities incompatible with life). But if any far later abortions are done for frivolous\nreasons, they could be morally wrong, since it\u2019s wrong to cause serious pain for no good reason.\nShould laws be created to ban any potential later abortions done for trivial reasons? Again, not all\nwrongdoing should be illegal, but \u2013 most importantly \u2013 a ban on these potential abortions would surely\nhave a negative impact on actual later abortions done for legitimate medical reasons. If the justifiability\nof any later abortions had to be proven in court, or people had to go through the criminal justice system\nto approve an emergency medical procedure, that would have very bad effects, given the speed,\ninefficiency and occasional incompetence of courts. Involving the police and the legal system in private\nmedical decisions would also be very bad for all, especially vulnerable groups: people of color,\nimmigrants, and poor people.\n4 Conclusion\nFor important issues, we need well-developed reasons or arguments to decide what to believe and do\nabout the issues. The purpose of this essay has been to provide some of that training so you can better\ndevelop an informed and well-reasoned moral perspective on abortion. Many people say they \u201cfeel\u201d that\nabortion is wrong or they \u201cfeel\u201d that it\u2019s OK. But complex issues require fair and honest critical\nthinking, not just uniformed \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201copinions,\u201d and we hope this paper has displayed this.\nWe have focused on disagreements about the issue, but we want to end on an agreement: everyone\nagrees there should be fewer abortions. Even people who think abortions are generally not wrong don\u2019t\nthink that having an abortion is just a great way to spend time and resources. So everyone could agree\nthat we, as a society, should do more to reduce the \u201cdemand\u201d for abortions. Some other countries don\u2019t\nhave as many abortions as the US does, and this is because of deliberate choices they have made to\nmake their country more supportive of all of its citizens and make it easier for them to meet their\neconomic, medical and familial needs. We too could be like Good Samaritans, which would be good not\njust for this issue, but many others, as well as who we are, as people, together.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

What they all share in\ncommon is the important problem of balancing our autonomy (our ability to choose and take actions for\nourselves) with the autonomy and value of everything else that surrounds us: people, animals, the\nenvironment, and society as a whole. Each of these require us to understand and appreciate the impact\nour actions, as well as our very nature as creatures, have on everything around us.\nChapter 13, Animal Rights by Eduardo Salazar, discusses how we should approach moral issues\nregarding non-human animals. Chapter 14, John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d by Ben Davies,\ndiscusses the important work of John Rawls and its implications for morality. Chapter 15,\nEnvironmental Ethics by Jonathan Spelman, discusses how we can value the environment in a morally\nappropriate fashion. Chapter 16, Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California,\ndiscusses conceptual difficulties with \u201cdate rape\u201d and concerns with the recent approach in California to\ncombat sex crimes on campuses. Chapter 17, The Ethics of Pornography by Eduardo Salazar, discusses\nmoral concerns with the generation and use of pornography. Chapter 18, The Social Contract by\nThomas Hobbes, is a classic work in Philosophy by the great 17th century philosopher that discusses the\npolitical state as a moral entity that enters into an agreement with its citizens.\nUNIT THREE: PERSONS, AUTONOMY, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND RIGHTS 84 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n13\nAnimal Rights\nEduardo Salazar1\nVirtue and Difference in Animal Ethics\nPhilosophical questions concerning animals are so ubiquitous that they virtually go unnoticed.\nWe take their presence and moral status for granted. However, our kinship with and bondage of animals\nsituates us within a very peculiar and problematic relationship. Once recognized, moral questions\nconcerning the treatment of animals present us with a deep dilemma: we view animals as extensions of\nour families and friends because of how similar they appear to us; and yet we also slaughter them for\nfood, conduct painful experiments on them, and utilize them as simple material resources because of\nhow different they appear. As a consequence, our thinking about animals results in contradictory views\nand practices. As we proceed in our discussion concerning animal ethics, it is important to keep in mind\nthe following two questions: What is animality2,3 or animal nature? How should we understand and\nrelate to animals? The significance of these questions is not to dictate answers, but to explore and reflect\non the relation between humans, animals, and animality.\nIn general, philosophers tend to denigrate animality as inferior to human nature or disregard it\naltogether. However, some have reworked the notion of animality and posit that it plays a central role in\ndefining human nature. For those rethinking animal nature, animality refers to dynamic characteristics\nthat unite but also separate animal from human nature: the bodily, instinctual, biological, and\ndetermined, to name a few. To some degree, humans share these with animals, but humans express them\nin different ways. As such, the notion of animality makes us feel uncomfortable because it reveals how\nproximal humans teeter between natures. It makes us anxious because of the ambiguity, fluidity, and\ncontinuity that it presents in characterizing seemingly disparate life forms or species. Animality poses a\nchallenge and threat to our traditional hardline distinctions between human versus animal. Considering\nthe moral status of animals, then, forces us to address this contradiction, discomfort, anxiety, and threat.\nPhilosophically, it forces us to clarify and justify the views we hold regarding animals. Ethically and\npragmatically, it forces us to reconsider the nature of our relationship with them in terms of their moral\nvalue, status, and rights.\nIn what follows, I present a very brief historical account of animal ethics and argue why we\nshould extend moral consideration to animals on the basis of re-envisioning the notion of dominion and\ndeveloping an ethical sensibility to difference (of life forms). But we begin by first outlining some\nobjections against extending moral consideration to animals. Responses to these objections will be\ninterwoven throughout the discussion.\nObjection to Extending Moral Consideration to Animals\n1 Eduardo Salazar earned a BA from SDSU and a MA in Philosophy from CSULA.

New York: Fordham University Press, 2008.\n3\nThe notion of animality has an ancient history, but here we will simply say that it refers to certain characteristics shared to\nsome degree by humans and animals: the non-rational, bodily, instinctual, amoral, uncivil.\n13 Animal Rights\nEduardo Salazar 85 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nWe can begin with some common objections to extending moral consideration to animals:\n\u25cf First, the \u201contological chain of being\u201d objection restricts moral consideration to animals because\nhumans stand on top of the chain. Moreover, the superiority of human nature merits dominion\nand mastery of all things.\n\u25cf Second, the \u201cuniqueness\u201d objection posits that only humans have reason, a soul, and live in a\nmoral community. Animals lack the capacity to understand morality, and thus can never really\nexpress rights; they lack the capacity to ever reciprocate a moral duty or responsibility to others;\nand they anatomically and cognitively lack the means by which to voice their status or rights.\n\u25cf Third, the \u201cutilitarian\u201d objection states that utilizing animals benefits the greatest amount of\npeople and maximizes pleasure and happiness.\nThere are other objections, but these provide general grounding for our discussion. We will now look\ncloser at some historical ideas and views that shaped contemporary animal ethics.\nThe Historical Non-Human Animal and Dominion\nThe Judeo-Christian religions, including Islam, offer us ambivalent positions towards animals.\nCertain passages suggest that humans have dominion over all creatures on the planet. Other passages\nsuggest that we serve as stewards of the creatures on earth. The Buddhist and Indian traditions have a\nmore liberal view on animals. Some practitioners of these eastern religions hold more straightforward\nwelfare positions. For example, some Buddhist and Hindus abide by ahimsa, which translates from the\nSanskrit as a principle of nonviolence. Ahimsa is extended to non-human animals as well. Although\ntraditional religious views on animals play an important role in our modern disposition towards animals,\na full discussion on religion and animal rights is beyond the scope of this project. Nevertheless, it will be\nacknowledged that the great traditions of the past leave the door open for animal advocacy, but for our\npurposes we will say that they hold a welfarist position. The welfarist view simply states we should\nconsider animal welfare, but not to the detriment of human interests.\nOne significant element that develops from the discussion of animal ethics within the context of\nreligion that is of philosophical interest is the notion of dominion. If god gave humans dominion over all\nthe creatures on the planet and the planet itself, what does dominion exactly mean? We further ask, how\ncan we best understand the notion of dominion that developed from religious texts, and situate it in our\ncontemporary milieu? Can we simply assume that dominion categorically refers to human absolute\npower over all non-human species (to mistreat)? Why should we assume that dominion as the power to\nrule over others necessarily means domination and exploitation of the non-human? Can dominion,\nperhaps, reflect a more nuanced state of human agency and responsibility, at least in a modern context?4\nWe can conjecture that dominion as the power to rule over others as a human endowment serves\nto ascribe moral consideration primarily or solely to humans. It also helps justify the severed\nrelationship between humans and nature, including non-human animals. Our assumed dominion and\nownership over all of nature directs us to delimit moral considerations. It helps formulate a fundamental\ndisposition of the endowed species: humans matter because they have agency and interests as unique life\nforms, and thus possess dominion and rights over others. However, some contemporary research on\n4\nMatthew Scully. Dominion: the Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy. New York: St. Martin\u2019s\nPress, 2002.\n13 Animal Rights\nEduardo Salazar 86 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nethics and dominion aims to reinterpret the human relationship with animals and nature and promotes\nthe extension of moral consideration.5\nThe Ontological Chain of Being\nIn the western tradition, views on animals can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. Notable\nancient Greeks who extended moral consideration to animals include Pythagoras and Plutarch. However,\nit was Aristotle\u2019s6 ideas that dominated most of western civilizations views on animals. He argued that\nhumans are most aptly defined by their rational social nature. Humans fulfill their natural and optimal\nfunction by reasoning and reflecting with other humans. Non-human animals, in contrast, lack the\ncapacity to reason, and therefore are of lesser moral value. For Aristotle, the fact that animals lacked\nreason disqualified them as being the type of creatures who could possess moral virtues, and thus not apt\nto share equal moral considerations. However, being a proto-biologist, Aristotle viewed humans and\nnon-human animals as sharing similar natural interests and dispositions, and thus different in degrees.\nNevertheless, the power of reason for Aristotle proved to be a sufficient condition for humans to have\ndominion over animals, and thus, arguably, opened the door for the exploitation of animals for the next\ntwo centuries, especially as he influenced canonical philosophers in their views on animals.\nThe 18th century Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant developed an ethical system using\ncategorical imperatives,7 which remains influential in moral philosophy. Succinctly stated, the\nimperatives hold that humans ought to always be treated as ends in themselves and never as means to\nends. Kant argued that only those beings who have the capacity to deliberate on their actions meet the\nminimum criteria for moral consideration. For Kant, non-human animals lack a good will to deliberate\non right (and wrong) actions, and thus humans do not have direct moral duties towards them. However,\nhe also thought that we ought to refrain from animal cruelty because those individuals perpetrating such\ncruel acts would harm their own moral sensibility. Ethical considerations towards animals are indirect\nconsiderations. Thus, Kant is typically interpreted as holding a welfarist position concerning animal\nethics.\nAristotle used the \u201contological chain of being\u201d arguments to arrive at his position. He situated\nplants, animals, and humans in a hierarchy where humans sit on top as masters, and animals, plants, and\ninanimate objects linger on lower levels of being, each descending into lesser forms of being. Kant\npushed the power of human reason to the level of a self-governing power, which can be interpreted as\ndrawing a further hierarchical divide between humans and animals. We still live under the veil of the\nAristotelian and Kantian view on animals. There are notable deserters of the tradition, however.\nBritish 18th century philosopher Jeremy Bentham found the ontological chain of being argument\nodious because it presented irrelevant facts regarding the moral consideration and status of animals. He\ncommented that, \u201c... the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\u201d8\nBentham disavows the idea that an ontological hierarchy of being warrants justification to have absolute\nand unabashed power over animals. His critique represents an early version of utilitarianism utilized to\nargue for animal welfare. For Bentham, moral consideration is founded on the basis and capacity to have\n5\nAndrew Linzey.

Thus, Bentham argued that animal capacity to suffer meets the minimum\ncriteria for moral consideration. His work paved the way for animal welfare rights and served as\nintellectual fodder for future animal rights arguments.\nModern Animal Rights: Singer and Regan\nThe event that publicly announced animal rights as a legitimate issue within contemporary\nphilosophy was Peter Singer\u2019s Animal Liberation9 text in 1975. Singer viewed himself as a utilitarian,\nlike Bentham. However, Singer presents a direct moral theory concerning animal rights, in contrast to\nindirect positions, such as welfarist views. He argued for extending moral consideration to animals\nbecause, similar to humans, animals have certain significant interests. As such, we ought to view their\ninterests alongside and equal to human interests, which results in humans having direct moral duties\ntowards animals\nSinger constructs his arguments based on the \u201cprinciple of equal consideration of interests\u201d\nshared by both animals and humans. Singer attempts to demonstrate that a certain property-P endowed\nto certain beings justifies their right to moral consideration. However, unlike his predecessors, for Singer\nthat certain property-P required to attribute moral consideration, which historically referred to reason,\nlanguage, consciousness, or a soul, instead refers to having an interest. Animals, like humans, have an\ninterest in fulfilling their basic needs, but also in avoiding suffering, and thus we ought to extend moral\nconsideration because they have positive and negative interests.\nFor Singer, the interest and capacity for sentient beings to suffer warrants moral consideration.\nMoreover, suffering is not arbitrary. In fact, Singer tells us, \u201cThe capacity for suffering and enjoyment\nis a pre-requisite for having interests at all.\u201d Thus, the capacity to suffer shared by both humans and\nanimals are to be seen as equal interests (not to suffer) that bestows both equal moral consideration.\nSinger further tells us that prejudice based primarily or solely on species type is a form of\ndiscrimination, speciesism. Speciesism is unacceptable for the same reasons that racism and sexism are\nmorally unacceptable. They all violate the principle of equality. The principle of equality, Singer tells\nus, should not be based on factual equality, for example, whether men are factually more intelligent than\nwomen, or arbitrary properties, such as superiority of species. Rather, he tells us that, \u201cEquality is a\nmoral idea, not an assertion of fact\u201d that ought to be grounded on having significant interests.\nTo further his case, Singer presents the \u201cargument from marginal cases\u201d: because certain humans\n(\u201cmarginal cases\u201d) may lack reason or language, such as a comatose person or an infant, their lack of\nproperty-P in the form of reason would nullify moral consideration to such \u201cmarginal cases\u201d. Most\nwould find this immoral. If the argument from marginal cases is sound, then speciesism becomes even\nmore tenuous. Speciesism, then, like racism and sexism, should be disavowed. In weighing equal\nsignificant interests that results in the greatest pleasure or happiness, Singer concludes, our moral\nthinking requires us to extend moral consideration to animals. Singer\u2019s defense of animal liberation\npaved the groundwork for subsequent pro-animal rights arguments.\nTom Regan\u2019s 1983 book The Case for Animal Rights offers a non-utilitarian argument for\nextending moral consideration to animals. Regan uses the \u201cprinciple of inherent value\u201d, the respect\nprinciple, and the subject-of-a-life (SOAL) criterion for his defense. A simplistic formulation of his\nargument is as follows:\n9\nPeter Singer. Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals. New York: The New York Review of Book,\n1990.\n13 Animal Rights\nEduardo Salazar 88 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n1. The inherent value and respect principles ground criteria for moral consideration and rights\n2. If a being possesses traits of the subject-of-a-life criteria, then we ought to adhere to the inherent\nvalue and respect principles regarding their treatment\n3. Certain non-human animals satisfy the subject-of-a-life criteria\n4. Therefore, we ought to extend moral consideration and rights to non-human animals\nFor Regan, the subject-of-a-life criterion can be defined by the following: having beliefs,\nperception, memory, a sense of the future, sense of one\u2019s own welfare, an emotional life, interests,\ndesires, and goals. If a being satisfies these conditions, then they have inherent value. Unlike Singer,\nwho uses the criteria of property-P as having cumulative interests to warrant moral consideration, Regan\nargues that each subject-of-a-life is an end in itself. The inherent value of the subject-of-a-life does not\ndepend on utility. If this is the case, then no one particular interest can trump or override the inherent\nvalue of beings who are the subject-of-a-life. This focus on the inherent value of individual animals\nmakes Regan an animal rights abolitionist because the conclusion of his arguments challenges the notion\nthat utilizing animals for food, lab experiments, or entertainment for human ends is morally acceptable,\neven if such use would benefit and/or bring happiness to the majority of people. Regan presents one of\nthe most philosophically deep and compelling cases for bearing moral consideration to animals.\nVirtue Ethics, Difference, and Dominion\nBoth Singer and Regan present us with defenses based on shared similarities between animals\nand humans. Their defenses give credence to the moral status of beings (as related to having interests or\ninherent value). However, one problem with the status approach is that it can lead to disavowing subtle\nlife forms, such as interwoven ecosystems. The status approach becomes problematic given the\ndifficulty in deciding who/what deserves moral consideration. As such, the virtue ethics approach\nprovides an alternative because it concerns itself with the question: \u201cHow shall I engage with \u2018X\u2019?\u201d,\nwithout necessarily assigning moral status to \u2018X\u2019 beforehand.\nBased on Aristotle\u2019s10 writings, traditional virtue ethics is not so much concerned with universal\nand categorical rights or greatest beneficial consequences. Rather, it is concerned with acquiring\nvirtuous traits that one develops and perfects with practice over time. This habituation of virtue is aimed\nat developing settled dispositions that allow one to arrive at a \u201cgolden mean\u201d or appropriate actions\nbetween excess and deficiency. For example, suppose you find yourself in the midst of a bank robbery.\nWhat is the courageous thing to do? It would be foolhardy to view one\u2019s duty to encounter the numerous\ngunmen while unarmed and possibly perish. But it would be cowardice to shield behind a child or\nelderly person. The courageous thing to do is what is appropriate at the right time, place, situation, and\nwith the right people.\nOne of the merits of virtue ethics is that it aims to nurture a \u201cvirtuous mind\u201d disposition. Such a\nmind highlights the complex and strenuous nature of deciding which course of action to take given a\nvariety of options in a situation. To take a seemingly innocuous example, suppose we are walking along\na river path that has heaps of ant hills. Somewhere along the path we decide to pollute the river and\ndestroy the ants simply because we can. According to the status approach, the acts are permissible\nbecause the river and ant hills are devoid of moral status and, thus, moral consideration. But could we\nhave related to them in other ways? This hypothetical case addresses the subtle nature of attuning and\n10\nAristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. 2nd Edition. Translated by Terence Irwin. Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2009.\n13 Animal Rights\nEduardo Salazar 89 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ndeveloping one\u2019s moral sensibility to each new situation with which one is presented. It is posited here\nthat each new situation carries the possibility for developing and nurturing a habituation of the virtues.\nThe virtue of benevolence or, in contemporary parlance, being socially conscious, seems most\nadequate to address the nature of moral consideration. Such a virtue is characterized by promoting the\ngood, becoming serviceable to others, or the concern for social justice. In the context of animal ethics,\nwe are interested in the virtue of benevolence based not only on similarity or status, but on the\ndifference11 that each new encounter with life forms or species offers. We engage with non-human life\nforms in a very different manner than we engage with other humans, so the question arises of how to\nengage with such difference. The question pushes our moral horizon to reflect on the moral status of life\nforms or species who are different from what we know to be human, and who require a nuanced type of\nengagement with. It is in our daily engagement with such radical difference that we find a deeper\nmeaning of morality. In fact, ecosystems, animals and vulnerable humans present us with a sense of\ndifference that not only relates to moral consideration and benevolence, but to reconsidering our\ndominion over them. It is precisely because their difference offers us dominion over them that our moral\nconsideration ought to be extended to them. Here we see moral consideration and benevolence\nconjoined by the notion of difference, as much as moral consideration and benevolence are united by the\nnotion of sameness.\nThe virtue of benevolence, seen within contemporary social dynamics, helps us reinterpret the\nnotion of dominion. Dominion, as human subjugation over others, undergoes a relational transformation.\nDominion, no longer viewed as a despotic endowment, is now seen as an ethical call and question from\nthe other12, the animal, the different, the non-human. The process of moral transformation turns our\nearly, narrow human-centered focus into a wider field of moral consideration open to diverse and\ndifferent life forms. In this regard, humans could not only live with but flourish alongside non-human\nanimals.\nConclusion\nI have attempted to provide a very concise historical account of animal ethics, but in no way does\nthis discussion account for the numerous positions or debates encompassing it. I started by surveying\nreligious views and ancient and modern philosophical accounts on animal ethics. I then highlighted\nSinger\u2019s and Regan\u2019s contemporary sameness positions. Lastly, I presented a virtue ethics position\nbased on the virtue of benevolence and the notion of difference. The historical moral sublimation of\ndominion was present throughout. The ultimate thrust of this discussion is for us to engage with (animal)\nradical difference and meet it with a virtuous mind that bestows our benevolence onto them. As such,\nour understanding of dominion over life transcends traditional limitations.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What are the traditional reasons for and against extending rights to animals?

The Veil of Ignorance is a way of working out the basic institutions and structures of a just\nsociety. According to Rawls,2 working out what justice requires demands that we think as if we are\nbuilding society from the ground up, in a way that everyone who is reasonable can accept. We therefore\nneed to imagine ourselves in a situation before any particular society exists; Rawls calls this situation the\nOriginal Position. To be clear, Rawls does not think we can actually return to this original position, or\neven that it ever existed. It is a purely hypothetical idea: our job in thinking about justice is to imagine\nthat we are designing a society from scratch. The idea is that social justice will be whatever reasonable\npeople would agree to in such a situation. We can then start thinking about how to make our actual\nsociety look more like the ideal picture we have imagined.\nOf course, if we were designing a society in the Original Position, people might try to ensure that\nit works in their favour. The process is thus vulnerable to biases, disagreements, and the potential for\nmajority groups ganging up on minority groups. Rawls\u2019s solution to this problem comes in two parts.\nFirstly, he makes some assumptions about the people designing their own society. People in the Original\nPosition are assumed to be free and equal, and to have certain motivations: they want to do well for\nthemselves, but they are prepared to adhere to reasonable terms of cooperation, so long as others do too.\nRawls also simplifies his discussion by imagining that people in the Original Position do not have total\nfreedom to design society as they see fit. Rather, they must choose from a menu of views taken from\ntraditional Western philosophy on what justice involves.\nThe second part of the solution is the Veil of Ignorance. This involves a further leap of\nimagination. When we are thinking about justice, Rawls suggests that we imagine that we do not know\nmany of the facts \u2013 both about ourselves and the society we currently live in \u2013 that typically influence\nour thinking in biased ways. By intentionally ignoring these facts, Rawls hoped that we would be able to\navoid the biases that might otherwise come into a group decision. For instance, if I were helping to\ndesign a society, I might be tempted to try to make sure that society is set up to benefit philosophers, or\nmen, or people who love science fiction novels. But if I don\u2019t know any of those facts about myself, I\ncan\u2019t be tempted. The Veil is meant to ensure that people\u2019s concern for their personal benefit could\ntranslate into a set of arrangements that were fair for everyone, assuming that they had to stick to those\nchoices once the Veil of Ignorance \u2018lifts\u2019, and they are given full information again.\nOne set of facts hidden from you behind the Veil are what we might call \u2018demographic\u2019 facts.\nYou do not know your gender, race, wealth, or facts about your personal strengths and weaknesses, such\nas their intelligence or physical prowess. Rawls thought these facts are morally arbitrary: individuals do\nnot earn or deserve these features, but simply have them by luck. As such, they do not deserve any\n1 Ben Davies is a Research Fellow at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford.

By removing knowledge of the natural inequalities that give\npeople unfair advantages, it becomes irrational to choose principles that discriminate against any\nparticular group. The Veil also hides facts about society. You do not know anything other than general\nfacts about human life, and in particular you do not how their society is organised. Finally, the Veil\nhides facts about your \u201cview of the good\u201d: your values, preferences about how your own life should go,\nand specific moral and political beliefs. Rawls was a political liberal. That meant, among other things,\nthat he thought the state should be neutral between different views about value. So, Rawls isn\u2019t afraid to\nmake several significant assumptions about the people involved in making decisions behind the Veil.\nSome of his assumptions aim to turn the conflicts that arise between self-interested people into a fair\ndecision procedure. As we\u2019ll see, however, others might be more fairly criticised as unreasonably\nnarrowing the possible outcomes that people can reach behind the Veil.\nI will outline Rawls\u2019s justification for the Veil of Ignorance, raise some potential challenges for\nthe conclusions he thinks people will reach from behind it, and lastly consider three criticisms of the\nVeil of Ignorance as a theoretical device. While these criticisms differ in their substance, they are united\nby a common feature: their scepticism of the way the Veil abstracts from real life in order to reach\nconclusions about justice. I\u2019ll conclude that these criticisms have merit; the Veil of Ignorance,\nconsidered by itself, does lead us to ignore the real world too much. However, I\u2019ll suggest that, at least\nin their strongest versions, these criticisms miss an important benefit of the Veil: quite simply, the fact\nthat our own personal concerns and values can bias our thinking about justice, and that we can make\nimportant progress by considering things from different points of view.\nSection 2: The principles of justice\nImagine that you find yourself behind the Veil of Ignorance. You might want to make sure that\nyour life will go well. If you had to design a good life for yourself, you\u2019d go for the specific things you\ncare about. But behind the Veil you don\u2019t know those specifics; you only know things that generally\nmake people\u2019s lives go well. Rawls calls these \u2018Primary Goods\u2019. They include things like money and\nother resources; basic rights and freedoms; and finally, the \u201csocial bases of self-respect\u201d: the things you\nneed to feel like an equal member of society.\nIn Rawls\u2019s view, a central challenge behind the Veil is the lack of probabilities available. If you\nknew that your society was 90% Catholic, you could set things up so that the rewards associated with\nbeing Catholic were much higher. That would be personally rational, since you are very likely to end up\nin the better off group. The Veil prevents this type of reasoning because it hides the information. In the\ncomplete absence of probabilities, Rawls thinks you should play it safe and maximise the minimum you\ncould get (a policy he calls Maximin). Translated into a society, that means that we should ensure that\nthe worst-off people in society do as well as possible.\nRawls suggests two principles will emerge from discussion behind the Veil:\nFirst Principle: Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme\nof equal basic liberties, compatible with the same liberties for all;\nSecond Principle: Social and economic inequalities must be:\na. Attached to offices and positions open to all under fair equality of\nopportunity;\nb. To the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society\n(the difference principle).\n14 John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d\nBen Davies 93 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nRawls opts for equality of basic liberties in the First Principle because he thinks this is essential\nfor seeing yourself as a moral equal in society. For other Primary Goods, though, equality is less\nimportant. By allowing some inequality, we could make life better for everyone. If we attach higher\nsalaries to certain jobs, they may attract the hardest working people, producing greater economic\nbenefits for everyone. The two parts of Rawls\u2019s second principle of justice set limits on when\ninequalities are allowed. Fair equality of opportunity says that positions which bring unequal payoffs\nmust be open to people of equal talents and equal willingness to use them on an equal basis. If two\npeople are just as capable of doing a job, and just as hardworking and willing to apply themselves,\nneither should have a greater chance of securing the position because they are wealthier, or because of\ntheir race or religion. Of course, we might wonder (and Rawls does not give a clear answer about this)\nwhen we are supposed to judge whether two people are equally hardworking and talented. The talents\nyou choose to develop, and the amount of effort you put in, are heavily affected by education; so it\nmight seem unfair to judge people if they have had very different educational experiences. Rawls\u2019s\nargument therefore seems to support ensuring broad equality of education, encouraging people to find\nand develop their talents to the fullest, even if this isn\u2019t a conclusion he explicitly draws.\nFinally, the Difference Principle sets a further restriction on inequalities. Even if a particular\ninequality does not affect equality of opportunities, the Difference Principle tells us that it must be\nbeneficial for the very worst off. For instance, it might be that by allowing inequalities, we motivate\npeople to work harder, generating more Primary Goods overall. If these then benefit the worst off in\nsociety, making them better off than they would have been in a more equal distribution, the Difference\nPrinciple will allow that inequality.\nSection 3: Criticisms\nAs with any influential philosopher, Rawls has been the subject of much criticism and\ndisagreement. In this final section, we consider three objections to Rawls\u2019s reasoning around the Veil of\nIgnorance.\n3.1 Ownership and rights\nWe have already noted that Rawls explicitly makes several assumptions that shape the nature of\nthe discussion behind the Veil of Ignorance, and the outcomes that are likely to come out of it. However,\none might challenge Rawls by disputing the fairness or intuitiveness of one or more of his assumptions.\nProbably the most famous example of this comes from Robert Nozick.3 Recall that Rawls\u2019s\nprinciples establish rules to govern the institutions and principles that distribute goods. He thinks that if\nwe work out what those institutions would look like in a perfectly just society, using the Veil of\nIgnorance, we can then start to move our current society in that direction. Nozick notes that in reality,\nmost goods are already owned. Rawls\u2019s view establishes a pattern that looks fair; but Nozick argues that\nwe also need to look at the history of how various goods came to be owned. In some cases, we find that\nthe person who owns those goods worked for them. In other cases, the individual will have inherited\nthose goods, but they will have come from an ancestor who worked for them. In both cases, we cannot\nsimply redistribute these goods to fit our pattern, because people have rights.\nIn Nozick\u2019s view, once you have ownership rights, you can do pretty much what you want with\nit, so long as you do not violate anyone else\u2019s rights. The fact that taking money you earned would\n3 Robert Nozick (1974) Anarchy, State and Utopia Blackwell Publishing (Oxford) pp.149-232\n14 John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d\nBen Davies 94 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nbenefit someone else cannot be the basis for government forcibly taking your money. One possible basis\nfor this is the idea of \u2018self-ownership\u2019. Nozick thinks we will all agree that it would be wrong to force\nyou to work if you didn\u2019t want to. The reason for this is that your body is owned by you and nobody\nelse. That principle extends, Nozick says, to what you do with your body: your labour. If you make\nsomething, or work for money, that thing is yours and nobody else\u2019s. Just as the state has no right to\nforce you to do things with your body that you don\u2019t want to do, it also has no right to force you to do\nthings with your other property, like giving it away to the less fortunate. That might be a nice thing to\ndo, but it isn\u2019t something others can force you to do.\nOne problem with this argument, to which Rawls might appeal, is that my ability to work (and\ntherefore gain property) depends on many other things: my education, my health that was guaranteed by\na public health system, a stable society that affords me opportunities for employment, or for employing\nothers. So it\u2019s not quite true that everything I produce comes from me alone.\n3.2 Identity and \u2018Neutrality\u2019\nA second criticism also concerns the fact that, behind the Veil, various facts are hidden from\nyou. Rather than worrying about the substantive conclusions Rawls reaches, as Nozick does, this\ncriticism worries about the very coherence of reasoned discussion behind the Veil of Ignorance.\nRawls\u2019s Veil of Ignorance is an example of a theory of justice that has universal aspirations.\nSince one of the facts that is hidden by the veil is the nature of the society you live in, we may assume\nthat the resulting principles are supposed to be applicable in all societies, though this is a view that\nRawls attempted to reject in later work. In addition, people behind the Veil are supposed to come up\nwith a view of how society should be structured while knowing almost nothing about themselves, and\ntheir lives.\nOne broad group who criticise these ideas are the so-called \u2018communitarian\u2019 philosophers, which\nincludes Charles Taylor,4 Michael Walzer5 and Alasdair MacIntyre.6 While their views differ, they tend\nto agree that what justice requires cannot be decided abstractly, but must instead be informed by local\nconsiderations and culture. Communitarians also suggest that Rawls\u2019s conception of the individuals\nbehind the Veil of Ignorance is problematic because they have so few defining features. Even if Rawls is\nright that people behind the Veil would agree on his two principles, communitarians think that the\nhypothetical agreement ignores much that is important.\nIndividuals behind the Veil are assumed to be largely self-interested, and to have a strong interest\nin retaining the ability to abandon their current social roles and pursuits and take up new ones.\nAccording to the communitarians, however, we are born with existing social connections to particular\npeople, cultures and social roles. Whereas Rawls emphasises our active engagement in shaping our own\nlives, communitarians want to remind us that our lives are unavoidably shaped by existing attachments\nthat we do not choose. For instance, if you are born into a particular religious community, you can of\ncourse still renounce that religion. But your life will still be shaped by the fact that you are a member, or\nformer member, of that community. It is worth noting, though, that this accusation is somewhat unfair\non Rawls. While it is true that individuals behind the Veil do not know about their defining features,\nRawls does not think that real people are like this. His interest is in trying to formulate a neutral way to\ndecide between competing groups.\n4 Charles Taylor (1989) Sources of the Self: The Making of the Modern Identity Cambridge: CUP\n5 Michael Walzer (1983) Spheres of Justice Oxford: Blackwell\n6 Alasdair MacIntyre (1988) Whose Justice? Which Rationality? Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press.\n14 John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d\nBen Davies 95 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nCertainly, it is a plausible worry that what justice requires may depend in part on the values of\nthe society in question. As a liberal, Rawls is particularly worried about protecting individuals whose\npreferred lives go against the grain of the society in which they find themselves. Communitarians will\nobject that the Veil of Ignorance goes beyond this protection, and rules out the possibility of different\nideas of justice, informed by local values. Perhaps we should acknowledge that people behind the Veil\nof Ignorance would recognise the possibility that their society will turn out to be strongly attached to a\nparticular set of values. A rational person behind the Veil might want to try to find a way to give a\nspecial place to such values, while protecting dissenters.\n3.3 Ideal justice?\nOur final challenge also concerns the real-world applicability of Rawls\u2019s principles. In brief, the\nclaim from scholars of race and of gender is that Rawls\u2019s abstract Veil of Ignorance ends up ignoring\nmuch that is relevant to justice.\nThe central criticism we consider here concerns the motivation of Rawls\u2019s overall project.\nRawls\u2019s aim is to outline a theory of \u2018ideal\u2019 justice, or what a perfectly just society would look like. This\nignores, purposefully, the many injustices that have happened and continue to happen, including the fact\nthat most societies continue to exhibit racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination.7 As critics\nargue, we then get at best an incomplete theory, which does not tell us how to fix existing injustice or, as\nit is sometimes called, \u2018non-ideal\u2019 justice (an issue that Rawls himself describes as a \u201cpressing and\nurgent matter\u201d). For instance, people disagree about the idea of \u2018reparations\u2019 for racial slavery that\nshaped the United States. Yet because this is an issue of non-ideal justice (how should we respond to the\nfact that the United States and many of its citizens failed to comply with the basic requirements of\njustice?), the idealisation of the Veil of Ignorance seems to give us no way to determine this important\nquestion.\nThis maps onto a more general question in political philosophy: if a theory of justice does not tell\nus how to act in our actual societies, does it have any value? While some8 argue that Rawls\u2019s work can\nbe used to draw concrete conclusions about issues such as racial profiling and affirmative action, critics\nwho reject this view may also argue that a theory of justice that is concerned only with the ideal ignores\nthe most pressing issues of the day. In Rawls\u2019s case, we may wonder whether we can accommodate such\nconcerns by making small changes to his assumptions, or whether more radical changes (or even\nabandonment of the theory) are required.\nConclusion\nThe three criticisms outlined above all take issue, in different ways, with Rawls\u2019s idealisation\naway from the real world. Much of the value of Rawls\u2019s work will depend on whether it is useful to\nconstruct ideal views of justice before, or at the same time as, thinking about the messier real world.\nEven a pessimistic conclusion on this issue, though, should recognise the following insight from Rawls:\nthat what seems just or fair or right to any person is influenced not just by our background but by our\nown selfish interests. Even if the details face problems, Rawls\u2019s Veil of Ignorance shows us that it can\nbe valuable to imagine things from opposing points of view. While the criticisms from communitarians,\nscholars of race, and feminist scholars demonstrate the importance of considering the concrete features\nof our societies and lives, the basic idea of abstracting away from potential biases is an important one.\n7 Carol Pateman and Charles Mills (2007) Contract and Domination Cambridge: Polity Press\n8 Tommie Shelby (2004) \u2018Race and Social Justice: Rawlsian Considerations\u2019 Fordham Law Review 72: pp.1697\u20101714.\n14 John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d\nBen Davies 96 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nNonetheless, this conclusion is consistent with recognising two mistakes in making use of the\nVeil of Ignorance. Firstly, recognising the importance of abstraction should not come at the cost of\nconsidering the real, concrete impact of policies we adopt, or of the social and historical context they are\npart of. Much political philosophy, at least in the USA and UK, can be criticised for neglecting these\nlatter issues. Secondly, acknowledging the importance of the Veil of Ignorance does not mean that\nRawls, and later philosophers, are right to have established an order of priority, where we first abstractly\nestablish a view of ideal justice, and only then move on to non-ideal justice. It may be more productive\nto consider issues of justice from both the kind of abstracted view represented by the Veil of Ignorance,\nand from the more concrete view advocated by its critics.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. The Difference Principle only allows inequalities if they benefit the worst off in society. Is this\npractical? Is it what people would agree to behind the Veil of Ignorance?\n2. \u2018The Veil of Ignorance hides information that makes us who we are. Behind the Veil, we are not\nindividuals, and so any decision we reach is meaningless.\u2019 Do you agree? Why/why not?\n3. Since our talents and inclinations depend on what happens to us even before we are born, can we\nmake sense of the idea of Rawls\u2019s idea of \u2018fair equality of opportunity\u2019?\n14 John Rawls and the \u201cVeil of Ignorance\u201d\nBen Davies 97 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n15\nEnvironmental Ethics and Climate Change\nJonathan Spelman1\n1. Introduction\nI grew up out in the country, and sometimes my brother and I would spend the afternoon catching\ngrasshoppers. It was a bit of a challenge, and it was fun. Once we\u2019d catch one, we\u2019d simply let it go. No\none got hurt. When I was ten or so, my family moved to the suburbs, and my brother and I spent more\ntime playing with the kids who lived nearby. One day, while walking down the sidewalk with the\nneighbor boy, we spotted a grasshopper just sitting on the sidewalk. The next thing I knew, the neighbor\nboy walked right up to it and \u2026 Crunch! \u2026 stepped on it.\nI was appalled by what the neighbor boy had done, but had he done anything wrong? He\ncertainly hadn\u2019t done anything legally wrong, but maybe his crushing the grasshopper was morally\nwrong. And what about my brother and me? Although our catching grasshoppers wasn\u2019t illegal, maybe\nit was immoral, nonetheless.\nGoing forward, I\u2019m going to focus my attention on these moral questions. (Accordingly, when I\nask whether an act is \u201cwrong,\u201d I am asking whether it is morally wrong.) Answering these questions\nrequires us to do ethics. The central question of ethics (or moral philosophy) is something like: \u201cHow\nshould we act?\u201d Historically, ethicists have focused their attention on questions of interpersonal ethics,\nthat is, questions about what we owe other people. But over the last century, ethicists have become\nincreasingly convinced that figuring out how we should act also requires us to answer questions of\nenvironmental ethics, that is, questions about what we owe our environment. This includes people, but it\nalso includes animals, plants, and ecosystems.\nIn this piece, I\u2019ll introduce you to the field of environmental ethics. To begin, I argue that it was\nwrong for the neighbor boy to crush the grasshopper. In the process, I identify a moral principle that I\nthen go on to apply to the most significant environmental problem of our time, the problem of climate\nchange. After briefly sketching that problem, I\u2019ll argue that in light of it, you and I are morally obligated\nto (i) reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, (ii) offset our remaining emissions, and (iii) advocate for\nclimate-friendly policies and politicians. Why? Because failing to do these things is irresponsible.\n2. Is it wrong to harm grasshoppers for no good reason?\nHumans deserve moral consideration, which is to say that their interests deserve to be taken into account\nwhen we\u2019re deciding what to do. This explains why we can\u2019t crush humans. Playdough, however,\ndoesn\u2019t deserve moral consideration. This explains why we can crush it. But what about grasshoppers?\nDo they deserve moral consideration? Can we crush them?\nYou might think that humans are the only things that deserve moral consideration. This view is\ncalled anthropocentrism. If anthropocentrism is correct, then since grasshoppers aren\u2019t human, they\ndon\u2019t deserve moral consideration, and therefore it is perfectly permissible to harm or even kill them for\nno good reason. While this view is coherent, it\u2019s rather implausible. My neighbor\u2019s dog isn\u2019t human, but\n1 Jonathan Spelman is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Ohio Northern University.

On this view, it is perfectly\npermissible to harm grasshoppers provided that no one owns them or cares about them. Again, although\nthis view is coherent, it\u2019s still rather implausible. After all, it seems like it would be wrong for me to\nkick any dog for no good reason, even if that dog is unowned and unloved.\nIn response to this further objection, you might admit that it would be wrong for me to kick any\ndog for no good reason, even if it were unowned and unloved, not because it is wrong for me to harm\ndogs, but because it is wrong for me to do anything that makes me more likely to harm humans. But\neven if it\u2019s true that my kicking dogs would make me more likely to harm humans, this seems like the\nwrong explanation for why it is wrong for me to kick dogs. It is wrong for me to kick dogs because of\nwhat it does to the dogs, not because of what it does to me.\nIn light of these arguments, we should reject anthropocentrism. We should admit that humans are\nnot the only things that deserve moral consideration, that at least some nonhuman animals deserve moral\nconsideration. But which ones? According to one relatively popular view, all sentient beings (i.e., beings\nthat have subjective experiences or are capable of experiencing pleasure and pain) deserve moral\nconsideration. This view is called sentientism. Whereas anthropocentrists cannot explain why it is wrong\nto harm dogs for no good reason, sentientists can.\nLet\u2019s say that we accept sentientism. Does that mean that it is wrong to harm grasshoppers for no\ngood reason? Not necessarily. According to sentientists, grasshoppers deserve moral consideration only\nif they are sentient. But it\u2019s not clear that grasshoppers are sentient. While it\u2019s relatively clear that they\nare conscious (i.e., that they have subjective experiences), it\u2019s less clear that they are capable of\nexperiencing pleasure and pain. So, if what makes a being deserving of moral consideration is that it is\ncapable of experiencing pleasure and pain, it\u2019s not clear that grasshoppers deserve moral consideration.\nThis might lead us to believe that we simply cannot know whether it is wrong to harm\ngrasshoppers for no good reason. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. The reason for this is that some actions\nare wrong simply for being unnecessarily risky. Imagine that your friend works in demolition and her\nand her team have been tasked with demolishing an old warehouse. While you are visiting her over your\nlunch break, she asks you if you would like to use the wrecking ball to destroy it. You love destroying\nthings, so you get behind the controls. Just as you\u2019re about to strike the first blow, you see a dog run\nbehind the warehouse. Although you think you saw it run away, you realize that it may have run into the\nbuilding. Your lunch break is almost over, so you don\u2019t have time to let her and her team search the\nwarehouse for the dog. If you\u2019re going to use the wrecking ball, it\u2019s now or never.\nIn this case, is it permissible for you to destroy the old warehouse before your friend and her\nteam search the warehouse for the dog? Of course not. Why not? Because doing so is unnecessarily\nrisky; it is irresponsible. Even if you would enjoy using the wrecking ball, that fact doesn\u2019t justify your\nperforming an action that may kill a sentient being. We can say the same thing about the neighbor boy\nwho crushed the grasshopper. Was it permissible for him to step on the grasshopper? No. Why not?\nBecause it was unnecessarily risky; it was irresponsible. Even if he enjoys stepping on grasshoppers,\nthat fact doesn\u2019t justify his performing an action that may kill a sentient being.\nIn this section, I have argued that humans are not the only things that deserve moral\nconsideration. Many nonhuman animals do as well. Some environmental ethicists have gone so far as to\nargue that plants and even ecosystems also deserve moral consideration. I have not discussed those\narguments here simply because you do not need to accept them in order to accept the conclusions that I\n15 Environmental Ethics and Climate Change\nJonathan Spelman 99 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nargue for in Section 4. (In fact, you may not even need to accept my argument for sentientism to do\nthat.) What you do need you to accept, however, is that unnecessarily risky acts are wrong. We cannot\nendanger others for the sake of minor benefits.\n3. The problem of climate change\nClimate change refers to any change in the normal weather conditions of a particular region of Earth or\nEarth as a whole. Although climate change is not necessarily a problem, abrupt climate change is a\nproblem since we cannot adapt to it quickly enough.\nWhile abrupt climate change is definitely a problem, it is not necessarily a moral problem.\nAbrupt, anthropogenic (i.e., human-caused) climate change, however, is a moral problem. To see this,\nconsider the difference between a scenario in which a forest fire burns your neighbor\u2019s house down and\na second scenario in which you burn your neighbor\u2019s house down. In the first scenario, when the forest\nfire burns your neighbor\u2019s house down, something bad has happened, but no one is morally responsible\nfor that bad thing. No one has done anything morally wrong. In the second scenario, however, when you\nburn your neighbor\u2019s house down, not only has something bad happened, but someone is morally\nresponsible for that bad thing, namely, you. You have done something morally wrong.\nIs there abrupt, anthropogenic climate change? Yes, there is. When humans take fossil fuels (e.g.,\ncoal, oil, and natural gas) out of the ground and burn them to heat their homes, power their cars, and\ncharge their electronics, they must emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), most notably carbon dioxide, into the\natmosphere. These GHG particles absorb and emit radiant energy, which causes global warming (i.e., an\nincrease in the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature) and other climate changes (e.g., altered precipitation\npatterns that increase the number of extreme weather events). Although some people deny this, it is\nrelatively uncontroversial.\nWhat is controversial, however, is the question of what you and I are morally required to do in\nresponse to about abrupt, anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply climate change).\nEnvironmental ethicists generally agree that you and I are morally obligated to do something in response\nto climate change, but they disagree about what that is. In the following section, I\u2019ll argue that you and I\nare morally obligated to do three things in response to climate change. First, we must reduce our GHG\nemissions. Second, we must offset our remaining GHG emissions (if we can afford to). And third, we\nmust advocate for climate-friendly policies and politicians. Why? Because failing to do these things is\nirresponsible.\n4. How should we respond to the problem of climate change?\nReturn to the scenario in which you burn your neighbor\u2019s house down. In that scenario, you clearly harm\nto your neighbor. Even if you don\u2019t physically harm her, you destroy her property. You force her to find\na new place to live. Climate change has similar effects. Between increasing the severity of droughts and\nfloods and by causing sea levels to rise, climate change is killing and will continue to kill humans and\nnonhuman animals. Others are being forced to abandon their homes and find new places to live. For\nmany humans, this will be much more difficult than simply finding a new home to buy. It will require\nabandoning one\u2019s homeland and moving somewhere completely foreign. For nonhuman animals, it will\nbe even more difficult. Some species, like polar bears, for example, may find it impossible to adapt and\nwill go extinct.\nNow, when you burn down your neighbor\u2019s house, you endanger your neighbor and force her to\nfind a new place to live. This is clearly wrong. But when you contribute to climate change, do you\nendanger anyone? Do you force anyone to find a new place to live? It\u2019s not clear that you do. Notice that\n15 Environmental Ethics and Climate Change\nJonathan Spelman 100 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthe harms of climate change are cumulative harms. Your contribution to the problem is relatively\ninsignificant. This leads some to argue that when you contribute to climate change, you do not do\nanything morally wrong.2\nWhile it may be true that your contribution to climate change is relatively insignificant, it is\nworth noting that how much you contribute to climate change varies significantly depending on where\nand how you live. Those living in Australia, Canada, and the United States, for example, emit much\nmore carbon dioxide per capita than those living in India, Indonesia, and Brazil. This, on its own, may\nbe a reason to think that you are doing something morally wrong since you are contributing more than\nyour fair share to climate change. Regardless, I want to argue that even if your contribution to the\nproblem of climate change is relatively insignificant, it is still wrong.\nTo see this, let\u2019s return to the hypothetical scenario we\u2019ve been discussing, the scenario in which\nyou burn your neighbor\u2019s house down. This time, however, let\u2019s assume that you don\u2019t actually burn\nyour neighbor\u2019s house down. Instead, you create a trail of dry brush from a nearby forest to your\nneighbor\u2019s house. This, on its own, doesn\u2019t harm your neighbor in the least. It does, however, make it\nmore likely that your neighbor\u2019s house will burn down. This is especially bad if there are frequent forest\nfires. But even if there aren\u2019t frequent forest fires, it\u2019s still morally wrong for you to endanger your\nneighbor and her home for no good reason. It\u2019s irresponsible.\nWhen we contribute to climate change, we do something analogous. We don\u2019t necessarily force\nanyone to find a new place to live, but we do increase the likelihood that people across the globe will\nhave to find new places to live. This is morally wrong, especially when our reasons for contributing to\nclimate change aren\u2019t good ones. If, for example, you start your car engine before getting into your car\nso that it has time to warm up, you\u2019re doing something morally wrong. Why? Because you\u2019re increasing\nthe likelihood that human and nonhuman animals across the globe will have to find new places to live,\nand you\u2019re doing it for no good reason. Sure, it\u2019s nice to warm up your car before getting into it, but that\nisn\u2019t a sufficiently good reason to justify your endangering both human and nonhuman animals.\nSome reasons, however, are sufficiently good to justify your endangering both human and\nnonhuman animals. When it is very cold outside, for example, it is morally permissible to heat your\nhome so that your pipes don\u2019t freeze. Or when your salary does not permit you to live close to your\nworkplace, and you can\u2019t carpool or use public transportation to get there, it is morally permissible for\nyou to drive to work. It\u2019s true that in driving you\u2019ll emit some carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It\u2019s\nalso true that this makes it slightly more likely that sentient beings will have to find new places to live,\nbut you\u2019re not acting irresponsibly. Similarly, when you light a candle in your home, it increases the\nlikelihood that your neighbor\u2019s house will burn down, but it doesn\u2019t follow from this that it\u2019s always\nwrong to light a candle in your home.\nIs this the full story? Not quite, and here\u2019s why. Imagine that you\u2019ve got a sufficiently good\nreason to light a candle. You realize that this increases the likelihood not only that your house will burn\ndown but also that your neighbor\u2019s house will burn down. Now, imagine that there is some small thing\nyou could do to reduce the likelihood of your neighbor\u2019s house burning down. You could install a smoke\nalarm, for instance. It seems like you are morally obligated do this.\nNote that you are not morally obligated to do this for your own sake. There is nothing necessarily\nwrong with burning yourself or destroying your house. I certainly don\u2019t recommend doing either of\nthose things, but they are not necessarily morally wrong. The reason, then, that you are morally\n2 See, e.g., Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, \u201cIt's Not My Fault: Global Warming and Individual Moral Obligations,\u201d in\nPerspectives on Climate Change (Elsevier, 2005), pp. 221\u2013253.\n15 Environmental Ethics and Climate Change\nJonathan Spelman 101 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nobligated to install a smoke alarm is not to protect yourself but to protect your neighbor. If your candle\nwere to start a fire, your smoke alarm would alert you to the danger, and you could call on the fire\ndepartment to put out the fire before it destroys your neighbor\u2019s house. Failing to install a smoke alarm\nwould be irresponsible. This becomes increasingly true as the number of people living close to you\nincreases. If you are surrounded by homes, or if you live in an apartment and are surrounded by\nneighboring families with children and pets, lighting a candle without having a smoke alarm is\nespecially irresponsible.\nWhen we contribute to climate change, we\u2019re doing something analogous. We\u2019re increasing the\nlikelihood that humans and nonhuman animals will die or be forced to find new places to live.\nFortunately, there\u2019s something we can do to reduce the likelihood of this. We can offset our GHG\nemissions (hereafter, simply emissions). When we purchase carbon offsets, we fund projects that reduce\nemissions by funding the development of wind farms, enabling landfills to capture emissions, and/or\npreventing deforestation. When we offset enough of our emissions, we go carbon neutral, which is to\nsay that our net emissions (i.e., our emissions minus our offsets) equals zero. By offsetting our\nemissions, we make it the case that no human or nonhuman animal is more likely to die or lose her home\non our account. When we offset our emissions, we act responsibly. This is what morality requires.3\nFinally, imagine that you\u2019re living in an apartment and are surrounded by neighboring families.\nYou light candles from time to time, but you have installed a smoke alarm and a sprinkler system. You\ndo not significantly increase the likelihood that others will lose their homes. The same, however, cannot\nbe said of your neighbors. They light candles all the time but don\u2019t have smoke alarms or sprinkler\nsystems. They are endangering all the people and nonhuman animals living in the apartment complex,\nbut they don\u2019t see the problem. You would move to a new apartment complex, but let\u2019s assume that\nyou\u2019re stuck in this one. It seems to me that, in a case like this, a responsible person would not simply\ncross his fingers and hope for the best. He would try to convince his neighbors to stop lighting candles\nall the time. He would encourage the manager of the apartment complex to add smoke alarms and\nsprinkler systems to every unit. He would petition the local government to require these things in\napartment buildings and vote for candidates who support these policies. He would advocate for change.\nWe are in an analogous position. Those around us are continually contributing to climate change,\nand in doing so, they are increasing the likelihood that human and nonhuman animals around the world\nwill die or lose their homes. But they do not see the problem. They do not see that their actions are\nunnecessarily risky. We might like to move to a new planet, but we are stuck on this one. We have\nnowhere else to go. It seems to me that, in a case like this, a responsible person would not simply cross\nhis or her fingers and hope for the best. She would try to convince others to reduce their emissions and\nto offset whatever emissions remained. She would encourage her local and national representatives to\npass legislation that would reduce emissions, and she would vote for candidates who support these laws.\nShe would advocate for change.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

Spelman argues that it is morally wrong\nto kill grasshoppers for no good reason, but what about a grasshopper (or a spider) that has found its way\ninto your home? Do we have a sufficiently good reason to kill it? Or should we capture it and release it\noutside?\n2. Spelman contends that it is morally wrong to contribute to climate change unless one has a\nsufficiently good reason to do so. Identify at least three activities that contribute to climate change.\nWhen do we have sufficiently good reasons to perform those activities? When do we lack sufficiently\ngood reasons to perform those activities?\n3. Spelman argues that individuals are morally obligated not only to reduce their GHG emissions and\noffset any remaining emissions, but also to advocate for climate-friendly policies and politicians. What\nsorts of activities would count as advocating for climate-friendly policies? Which of those activities are\nmorally obligatory, and which ones are not?\n15 Environmental Ethics and Climate Change\nJonathan Spelman 103 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n16\nRape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative\nConsent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin1\nAny type of forced sexual contact is, at a minimum, criminal assault and often passes a threshold\ninto rape. Where the line is drawn is not directly relevant for my current analysis, which is two related\nissues: to understand when someone is capable of consent; and to appreciate when someone is\nreasonable in believing they have obtained consent. The term \u201cdate rape\u201d quite literally does not need a\nqualifier: if rape occurs, it does not matter how. When the term is used, however, it is usually meant to\ndenote \u201cimpaired sex\u201d in which one or more parties involved in sexual contact was impaired due the use\nof alcohol or drugs and their ability to consent was questionable. Understanding this threshold, of when\nproper consent to sexual contact occurs, is the task at hand. The state of California has moved from a\n\u201cno means no\u201d policy to a \u201cyes means yes\u201d policy for sexual consent on college campuses, which means\nthe assumption is that parties must actively consent to sexual contact for it to be permitted (yes means\nyes) rather than assuming that sexual contact is fine until someone says otherwise (no means no). The\nCalifornia \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d law contains one of the nation\u2019s most rigid requirements for consent,\nand I maintain that, while the intent behind the law is noble and sorely needed given the rampant\noccurrence of sexual assault across college campuses, the law itself is overly rigid and too far-reaching,\nresulting in criminalizing sexual contact that does not, and should not, constitute anything criminal. It is,\nhowever, a good first step.\nTwo Latin phrases are used in understanding guilt, both morally and legally: mens rea and actus\nreus. The first, mens rea, means \u201cguilty mind.\u201d It is meant to capture a situation when someone intended\nto commit a crime. The second, actus reus, means merely that a guilty action occurred. For example, if I\nam throwing a baseball at a wall in a park with my eyes closed and someone walks in front of me and\ngets hit in the eye and ultimately loses it, a guilty action occurred. I assaulted someone in a way that I\nshould not have \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an innocent mistake or entirely an accident as I shouldn\u2019t have been doing\nwhat I was doing. However, I also didn\u2019t intend to hurt someone with what I was doing: I did not have a\nguilty mind. Because the action occurred (at least in part due to my negligence), it doesn\u2019t matter much\nwhat I intended: something bad happened, and that\u2019s enough for me to be punished. But this isn\u2019t always\ntrue, as real accidents do happen, and even when something that is a \u201cguilty action\u201d occurs, there might\nbe no one to blame. For example, if a bird flies into a car windshield, that car in turn hits my car and\nforces me into a sidewalk where I hit a pedestrian, there is no one to blame. People can also have a\nguilty mind with no guilty actions and we are wont to punish them, as is in the case of attempted murder\nwhere the attempt results in no harm whatsoever. So how are these relevant for the current analysis?\nFor a rape to occur, there has to be unwanted sexual contact to the extent it qualifies as a rape.\nThere must be the actus reus. It is hard to imagine someone raping someone without the actual assault\noccurring (though there are many ways that one can be assaulted, no doubt). But what if an act of rape\n1 Associate Professor of Philosophy at Golden West College. He may be reached at nlevin@gwc.cccd.edu. You can find\nmany other free works by him at ngefarpress.com.

There are a few different ways that this can happen.\nIf someone was grossly negligent (willingly chose not to do what they should have) or didn\u2019t do their\ndue diligence (didn\u2019t do enough to make sure they were doing the right thing) in obtaining consent,\nthen, even if there was no mens rea a person can still be guilty of having committed rape. What this\nmeans is if someone engages in intercourse with a severely inebriated person that is barely conscious or\nif someone makes strong advances and doesn\u2019t allow for the rejection of such advances, dominating a\nsituation in which the other party doesn\u2019t feel safe to say no, then due diligence to obtain consent was\nnot taken. I\u2019ll return to the ideas of negligence and due diligence later, but it\u2019s the defense of \u201cwell, she\ndidn\u2019t say no,\u201d that led to the California \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d law. It shifts the standard of requirement\naway from one person having to explicitly state that they do not want to engage in sexual contact into\none that requires both parties to ensure they have obtained consent from the involved parties. The full\ntext of the law, Senate Bill No. 967 (SB 967) which adds to Section 67386 of the California Education\nCode, was passed September 28, 2014, and is often referred to as the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d law, is\nreprinted below:\nSB 967, De Le\u00f3n. Student safety: sexual assault.\nExisting law requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of\nthe California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing\nboards of independent postsecondary institutions to adopt and implement written procedures or\nprotocols to ensure that students, faculty, and staff who are victims of sexual assault on the\ngrounds or facilities of their institutions receive treatment and information, including a\ndescription of on-campus and off-campus resources.\nThis bill would require the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of\nthe California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing\nboards of independent postsecondary institutions, in order to receive state funds for student\nfinancial assistance, to adopt policies concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating\nviolence, and stalking that include certain elements, including an affirmative consent standard in\nthe determination of whether consent was given by a complainant. The bill would require these\ngoverning boards to adopt certain sexual assault policies and protocols, as specified, and would\nrequire the governing boards, to the extent feasible, to enter into memoranda of understanding or\nother agreements or collaborative partnerships with on-campus and community-based\norganizations to refer students for assistance or make services available to students. The bill\nwould also require the governing boards to implement comprehensive prevention and outreach\nprograms addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. By\nrequiring community college districts to adopt or modify certain policies and protocols, the bill\nwould impose a state-mandated local program.\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for\ncertain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that\nreimbursement.\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill\ncontains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to\nthese statutory provisions.\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 105 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\nSECTION 1. Section 67386 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n67386. (a) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of\neach community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of\nthe University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions\nshall adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking,\nas defined in the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1092(f)) involving a\nstudent, both on and off campus. The policy shall include all of the following:\n(1) An affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both\nparties to sexual activity. \u201cAffirmative consent\u201d means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary\nagreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the\nsexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to\nengage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does\nsilence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can\nbe revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or\nthe fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an\nindicator of consent.\n(2) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary process, it shall not be a\nvalid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant\nconsented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:\n(A) The accused\u2019s belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or\nrecklessness of the accused.\n(B) The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused\nat the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented.\n(3) A policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements of the complaint against\nthe accused have been demonstrated is the preponderance of the evidence.\n(4) A policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a\nvalid excuse that the accused believed that the complainant affirmatively consented to the sexual\nactivity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable\nto consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances:\n(A) The complainant was asleep or unconscious.\n(B) The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or\nmedication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the\nsexual activity.\n(C) The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.\n(b) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each\ncommunity college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the\nUniversity of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 106 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nshall adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic\nviolence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and\ncurrent professional standards. At a minimum, the policies and protocols shall cover all of the\nfollowing:\n(1) A policy statement on how the institution will provide appropriate protections for the privacy\nof individuals involved, including confidentiality.\n(2) Initial response by the institution\u2019s personnel to a report of an incident, including\nrequirements specific to assisting the victim, providing information in writing about the\nimportance of preserving evidence, and the identification and location of witnesses.\n(3) Response to stranger and nonstranger sexual assault.\n(4) The preliminary victim interview, including the development of a victim interview protocol,\nand a comprehensive followup victim interview, as appropriate.\n(5) Contacting and interviewing the accused.\n(6) Seeking the identification and location of witnesses.\n(7) Providing written notification to the victim about the availability of, and contact information\nfor, on- and off-campus resources and services, and coordination with law enforcement, as\nappropriate.\n(8) Participation of victim advocates and other supporting people.\n(9) Investigating allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident.\n(10) Providing that an individual who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation\nof sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking will not be subject to\ndisciplinary sanctions for a violation of the institution\u2019s student conduct policy at or near the\ntime of the incident, unless the institution determines that the violation was egregious, including,\nbut not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves\nplagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty.\n(11) The role of the institutional staff supervision.\n(12) A comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in\ninvestigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking\ncases.\n(13) Procedures for confidential reporting by victims and third parties.\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 107 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n(c) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each\ncommunity college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the\nUniversity of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions\nshall, to the extent feasible, enter into memoranda of understanding, agreements, or collaborative\npartnerships with existing on-campus and community-based organizations, including rape crisis\ncenters, to refer students for assistance or make services available to students, including\ncounseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, and legal assistance, and including resources\nfor the accused.\n(d) In order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, the governing board of each\ncommunity college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the\nUniversity of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions\nshall implement comprehensive prevention and outreach programs addressing sexual violence,\ndomestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. A comprehensive prevention program shall\ninclude a range of prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, empowerment\nprogramming for victim prevention, awareness raising campaigns, primary prevention, bystander\nintervention, and risk reduction. Outreach programs shall be provided to make students aware of\nthe institution\u2019s policy on sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. At a\nminimum, an outreach program shall include a process for contacting and informing the student\nbody, campus organizations, athletic programs, and student groups about the institution\u2019s overall\nsexual assault policy, the practical implications of an affirmative consent standard, and the rights\nand responsibilities of students under the policy.\n(e) Outreach programming shall be included as part of every incoming student\u2019s orientation.\nSEC. 2. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs\nmandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall\nbe made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the\nGovernment Code.\nTo summarize what this law does, it requires that each individual, regardless of relationship\nstatus, prior history, or lack of protest, actively obtain express consent before and during a sexual\nencounter. This does not need to be the mood-killing \u201cDo I have your permission to continue?\u201d every\nfew seconds; being an active, engaged participant that responds positively to and initiates wanted\ncontact is enough. In other words, if both people are actively into it, you can keep going. If there\u2019s any\ndoubt (and this is important), then you need to ask to be sure. We do this with most things (and there\u2019s a\nhilarious video analogizing having sex to offering someone tea that can be found online and is\nappropriately titled \u201cTea and Consent\u201d2), so it shouldn\u2019t be odd to do the same thing with sex. We don\u2019t\nforce people to drink tea or force people to have a conversation with us, and if we don\u2019t think they\u2019re\ninto it, we ask.\nThere are some worrisome legal technicalities that arise with this law as written, however. With\nsuch a shift toward placing responsibility on seeking consent and ensuring the other person is both\ncapable of consenting and actually consenting, how do we apply reasonable standards? How much\n2 https://vimeo.com/128105683\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 108 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nalcohol can someone consume and still be able to consent? The case could be made that any\nconsumption of alcohol or drugs impairs someone\u2019s judgment. Can you tell how much someone has had\nto drink? Or how coherent they are after a few drinks? How many people have said, \u201cno, really, I\u2019m\ngood\u201d when they\u2019re not? Would ignorance be a defense here? It also requires a preponderance of\nevidence (which just means it seems more likely than not that a violation occurred), and this could\nseverely undermine the rights of the accused. I say this not to defend attackers, but to defend the liberty\nof everyone. The problem with current laws is that the accused can hide behind their legal protections\nquite effectively, but we must be careful not to swing to other side too far and make it overly difficult\nfor innocent people to defend themselves when unfairly accused (as does occur).\nNow to be brief in my major criticisms, I would like to point out situations that would run afoul\nof this law:\n1) A quadriplegic requests their partner unhook them from communication devices in order to\nmake intercourse possible;\n2) A committed married couple gets very drunk together and engages in intercourse, with\nneither actively consenting to it and barely remembering engaging in the sexual acts in the\nmorning;\n3) One half of a committed married couple gets very drunk while the other is sober, they move\nto the bedroom, and the inebriated one says, \u201cgo ahead and finish up if I fall asleep\u201d;\n4) A deaf individual is concerned about being able to communicate during a sexual encounter\nwithout violating the terms of their school\u2019s policies.\nBut I would like to point out which situations this law rightfully captures as problematic,\n5) Two drunk students go back to a dorm room, start making out, one of them begins pulling off\neach other\u2019s clothes and is not met with protest, which eventually leads to one-sided\nintercourse in which the other student is physically uninterested and uninvolved, but never\nexplicitly objects;\n6) A sober student engages in intercourse with a very inebriated student that actively consents to\nintercourse;\n7) One member of a dating couple has sex with their partner after that partner passes out after\npulling an all-nighter.\nFinally, the possible implication in the law that someone whose judgment might be impaired is\nincapable of sexual consent seems to be a problem. This restricts one\u2019s autonomy to be able to do such\nthings, and being inebriated does not prima facie mean that one is unable to consent to sexual activities.\nMany introverts utilize the inhibition-defeating effects of alcohol to help them in social situations, even\nwith those they know. I am not advocating for this (nor am I criticizing it), but it seems to be an\nimportant choice someone should be able to make without fear of legal retribution (in this case, it would\nbe violation of school policies defined by the Educational Code).\nSB 967 is a good start to fixing the awful and widespread problem of sexual assaults on college\nand university campuses, but it is overreaching and results in criminalizing situations that should not be\nproblematic. In doing so, it suggests there is something wrong with activities that individuals ought to be\nable to choose to do as an important expression of their individual autonomy. A move to a standard of\naffirmative consent is commendable, necessary, and important, but we must be careful to strike the right\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 109 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nbalance with the laws we create.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Are there clear criteria we can use to determine when someone is capable of consent? What would\nthey look like? Or why would it not be possible?\n2. It is generally assumed that people under the age of 18 are incapable of consent because they lack the\nintellectual development to be able to consent to such things (these are cases of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d). Let\u2019s\nsay that someone is over the age of 18 but has the intellectual and maturity level of a 12-year-old. They\nhave the biological urges of an 18-year-old, but might not be able to appreciate what it means to consent.\nWould they be able to consent to sexual contact? If not, are their rights being unfairly restricted?\n3. Which standard do you think is better and why: \u201cyes means yes\u201d or \u201cno means no\u201d?\n16 Rape, Date Rape, and the \u201cAffirmative Consent\u201d Law in California\nNoah Levin 110 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n17\nThe Ethics of Pornography: Deliberating on a\nModern Harm\nEduardo Salazar1\nThe modern form of pornography can be difficult to define. However, we can initiate a\ndiscussion by contextualizing it. First, modern pornography is a product of free market capitalism: it has\ncreated a billion dollar industry. Second, it is a modern artifact that runs with technological advances.\nWith the advent of the Internet, it has become readily available for anyone to experience it at virtually\nany time. Third, the notion of private (or hidden) sexuality has morphed into a more mainstream and\npublic spectacle. There are now public conventions, such as Adult-Con, that promote and celebrate\npornography. It is now a cultural icon of historical status. Philosophical discourse on pornography\nreflects on whether it should be prohibited due to the harm it causes. It involves a legalistic discussion\npertaining to freedom of speech, civil liberties, and harms. As such, how ought civil society engage with\nit given its controversial nature? The purpose of this discussion is threefold. First, certain qualified\ndefinitions of pornography will be noted to better understand what is at stake. Second, anti-pornography\narguments that seek to ban it will be discussed. Third, liberal views are presented to contrast with anti-\npornography arguments. I conclude by providing reasons for endorsing a more liberal view on the civil\nstatus of pornography. Although I sympathize with many of the concerns that anti-pornography\nproponents worry about, I ultimately conclude that pornography presents us with a modern harm that a\nhealthy, free society should contend and live with.\nA first move common in philosophy is to begin by clearly defining and explaining concepts in an\nargument or theory before providing a full discussion. The preliminary question we face here is what\nexactly counts as pornography? What criteria do we use to include certain material within the set of\nitems deemed pornographic? How do we justify such criteria? What about marginal cases? Providing a\nneat and clean definition has proven quite challenging. In deliberating on an obscenity case in 1964,\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart commented, \u201cI shall not today attempt further to define the\nkinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description [\"hard-core\npornography\"], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it,\nand the motion picture involved in this case is not that\u201d. We can entertain this shifting definition as a\nstarting point. However, a working definition requires us to provide certain qualifiers to capture in\ngreater accuracy the meaning of pornography.2 First, we can say that the definition falls under the\nbroader concept of sexually explicit material. We can further say that sexually explicit material refers to\nthe depiction of explicit sexual acts on a variety of mediums with the intention of arousing an audience,\nreader, and/or viewer to sexual stimulation. And by sexual acts we mean depicting direct or indirect\nintercourse between actors or toys, extreme \u201cpositions\u201d, nudity, fetishistic symbolism, and/or\n1 Eduardo Salazar earned a BA from SDSU and a MA in Philosophy from CSULA.

The obscenity position can be seen as a\nzero-sum account, which does not admit of degrees: anything that remotely depicts sexually explicit\nmaterial that arouses stimulation is considered pornographic. But is all sexually explicit material\npornography?\nSome contest that the obscenity position is too restrictive. This view negates carte blanche the\nartistic and philosophical exploration of sexuality, which is meant to be publicly shared with those\ninterested. Contemporary scholars generally hold a permissive attitude concerning erotica as erotica\nfocuses more on ideas and emotions pertaining to sexuality, rather than completely focusing on sex acts\nthemselves. Erotica may also include intercourse, extremes, fetishisms, nudity, and/or sadomasochism,\nbut there is a greater equality shared between women and men actors.4 That is, the parties involved have\ntheir ideas, feelings, emotions, and bodies tended to and highlighted to some equal extent, which seems\nto be lacking in pornography. For these reasons, some anti-pornography proponents allow room for\nsexually explicit material in the form of erotica, and rebuke the obscenity position which marginalizes\nall sexually explicit material. As such, it prevents the exploration and deeper understanding of sexuality.\nIt also threatens freedom of speech as artistic expression. If erotica functions as legitimate artistic and\nphilosophical expression, what exactly makes pornography proper so repulsive and wanton?\nSome of the most important and interesting arguments against pornography have been developed\nwithin feminist philosophy.5 The general feminist critique claims that pornography has an explicit and\npernicious impact on those involved in making it, especially women. As such, feminist thinkers take it to\nmean: sexually explicit material that results in arousing a person that is deemed harmful. In contrast to\nerotica, this modified definition amends it as something that directly or indirectly promotes harming\nactresses and/or women more generally. Linda Marchiano\u2019s autobiographical book Ordeal6 depicts the\nadult film industry as causing her significant harm. Marchiano, star of the infamous film Deep Throat,\nwrites that abuse is a common practice in the making of adult films. She reported that she was\nkidnapped, beaten, and forced to perform under threat. The Marchiano case provided evidence to ban\npornography because Ordeal showed that pornography perpetrated harmful criminal acts.\nIt is important to note that anti-pornography arguments are generally grounded on the harm\nprinciple. The notion of harm has its philosophical roots in John Stuart Mill\u2019s work in political\nphilosophy.7 It serves as a principle that helps define personal freedom and potential government\ninfringement of that freedom. Simply stated, the harm principle says that humans are agents who are free\nto pursue personal and social goals and interests to the extent that it does not harm others. If our actions\nharm others, it presents the government with evidence to justify their infringement and limit those\nharmful acts. For example, one can hold racist views. However, one is not free to harm another person\n3\nLynn Hunt \u201cObscenity and the Origins of modernity: 1500-1800.\u201d Drucilla Cornell in Feminism and Pornography.

But does the Marchiano case provide sufficient evidence to justify\nbanning pornography altogether?\nFor one, the Marchiano case alone does not present sufficient evidence to justify banning\npornography. If it were the norm, presumably more women would speak out and seek retribution. We\nsimply need more evidence to validate Marchiano\u2019s (anecdotal) case against pornography. Second, it is\nimportant to differentiate between criminal acts (abduction, assault, etc.) versus signing a contract to\nperform in a (adult) film. The criminal act of assault does not carry over into an arranged, specific legal\ncontract (i.e., acting in a film). In other words, such criminal acts are not inherently present in the\nproduction of adult films per se. But the feminist can respond by saying that harm need not be defined as\ndirect, brute physical harm.\nCertain feminist arguments have modified the notion of harm to mean that it promotes the\nsubordination and servility of women. Consequently, such modification results in sexual violence\nperpetrated against women in the making of films and in the general public. Such a position posits a\ndirect correlation between the making and viewing of pornography with the increased incidence rate of\nviolence targeting women; rape is the most egregious offense motivated by pornography. While this\ncorrelation would be cause for great alarm, the evidence for such claims remains inconclusive.8 In fact,\nscholarly interest and research analysis on the effects of pornography is a new field of research. The first\nacademic journal, Porn Studies, dedicated to scholarly research was first published in 2014. Subsequent\nstudies have furthered revealed inconclusive results regarding its effects.9 As such, we should be\nskeptical about positions that condemn pornography for having a direct and strong correlation with\nincreased sexual violence. Perhaps stronger correlation will be shown in the future, however.\nLegal scholar Catharine Mackinnon has reworked the notion of harm. She argues that harm is\ninherently present in pornography in subtle ways.10 Moreover, the debate is not only about freedom of\nspeech, but it concerns acts (the making and dissemination of pornography) that cause harm. She claims\nthat it harms women because it violates their civil liberties in two significant ways: 1. It violates their\nright to equal status. Women\u2019s status is deformed to one of sexual objects, servility, and subordination;\nand 2. It violates their right to freedom of speech. Women are silenced by porn to define themselves as\nthey deem right. We will briefly explore these two charges.\nFirst, pornography violates women\u2019s rights to equality, which can be interpreted as a form of\nsexual violence and sexism. It portrays women as mere willing sexual objects, at the complete service of\nmale fantasies, which constructs an image and status of a lesser and naturally subordinate gender. This\nunequal status permeates into mainstream society: politics, media, education, and renders women as\ninferior beings. It prevents women from acquiring jobs, education, etc. It presents us with a case of sex\ndiscrimination. Gender and sex discrimination are unlawful, and therefore pornography should be\nbanned. But is this a clear case of harm or sexism?\nDo Hollywood films, music videos, or advertisements that depict women as subordinate also\npresent us with cases of sexism? If so, we would need to prohibit numerous media projects that circulate\nin society. While pornography may lead to women being depicted as subordinate, it does not follow that\nit presents a case of discriminatory practices. Actors willfully engage in contractual agreements in\n8\nAnthony D\u2019Amato, \u201cPorn Up, Rape Down\u201d (June 23, 2006).

It can be part of healthy sexual engagement within a meaningful relationship.\nSecond, McKinnon claims that pornography violates women\u2019s rights to freedom of speech,\nwhich can be interpreted as a type of sexual violence and sexism. This second violation claims that\npornography is harmful to women because it silences them in pernicious ways. A woman\u2019s interests in\nexpressing her freedom of speech is violated. In fact, MacKinnon sees pornographic material as libelous\nspeech because it misrepresents women and nullifies their effort to respond in significant ways to\narticulate and rectify their image. It also prevents women from reporting incidents of sexual violence\nbecause a woman\u2019s image (as a willing sexual object) and voice (misunderstood or dismissed) are\ndrowned out. Similar to certain hate speech being regulated, pornographic material should also be\nbanned because it is inherently harmful. This is an ingenuous reworking of the harm principle in the\ncontext of showing how pornography violates women\u2019s right to freedom of speech. However, as with\nthe above case of purported inequality, the fact that actresses willfully engage in contractual matters\nneutralizes this charge, as they know that they may need to engage in certain uncomfortable scenes, etc.\nWe will now discuss how liberal arguments attempt to formulate and mitigate the harm problem of\npornography.\nIn general, the liberal argument for protecting pornography rests on three key legal and moral\nprinciples.11 First, the liberal argument contends that people have the right to express themselves as they\ndeem meaningful, even if it offends certain sections of society. Minorities or fringe groups are protected\nby the right to freedom of speech. This right is protected to the extent that it does not harm another\nperson and/or group. Hate groups have rights to the extent to which they do not inflict harm on another,\nand not just offend. But, as we have seen, the notion of harm becomes very thorny. Can we legitimately\nclaim that material that portrays women as subordinate and unequal count as an act of harm, or should it\nbe considered an offense instead? Because there is no clear connection between pornography and harm,\nit is wise to err on the side of the right of freedom of speech, at least for now. Otherwise, other groups\nmay be prohibited from expressing their ideas by a moral majority in conjunction with (big)\ngovernment.\nSecond, the harm principle is another key element in the liberal defense, which serves two\nfunctions. It serves as the guarantee of the freedom of expression as long as it brings no harm to others.\nThis is its positive variation. The other \u201cnegative\u201d function serves to prevent organizations or\ngovernment from encroaching on one\u2019s right to expression. No government agency or moral mobs can\nenter production sets and confiscate and end filming without justification.\nThird, the principle of autonomy plays a central role as well. In order for any type of freedom to\nbe meaningful, we must already assume that we have a significant amount of autonomy and power to\nmake independent decisions as moral agents. We may make some poor decisions, but that alone should\nnot warrant the erosion of our freedom of expression. In this manner, the liberal argument supporting\npornography can be seen as presenting an anti-paternalistic view. That is, having the rational capacity of\nmaking decisions based on the best evidence at hand should ward off any other party from interfering\nwith or prohibiting our choices.\nGiven these liberal considerations, it is necessary to contextualize pornography, harmful speech\nand acts, and rights in terms of the notion of contractualism. As stated in the introduction, pornography\n11\nRonald Dworkin. \u201cDo We Have a Right To Pornography?\u201d in A Matter of Principle.

One of the basic elements present in industries is\nthe legally binding contract made on free and mutually acceptable terms, ideally. Workers and actors\nactively engage in signing contracts to be in films. There may exist some deceitful and corrupt means by\nwhich workers sign contracts, but such practices have been reported to also be present in signing sports\nathletes to contracts, for example. Given the sordid entertainment industry, including both film and\nsports, we do not entertain prohibiting sports due to such practices. It is a matter of reframing the\nindustry in their negotiating practices.\nThe idea of contractualism helps legitimize the notions of autonomy, freedom of expression,\nworkers rights, mutual benefits, amongst other crucial factors in a relatively free society.\nContractualism, as a relational tool between individuals and groups, views people as rational beings\ncapable of forming independent opinions and making independent decisions about what types of work to\nengage in. Pornographers engage in the production of extreme and graphic sexual material, but they do\nso willingly under contract. We can advise and educate people about the dangers of certain industries,\nbut we should not take their right to engage in agreed upon contractual jobs.\nOne of the most important liberal concerns regarding pornography lies in trepidation over\npaternalism. Simply stated, it refers to an authority figure who limits a person\u2019s/group\u2019s freedom in\norder to promote the person\u2019s/group\u2019s best interest, which runs counter to liberal notions of autonomy.\nThe worry for liberals is that if the government prohibits pornography because of supposed harm, then it\nmay outlaw other forms of expression. This line of reasoning takes on the form of a slippery slope\nargument. If right X is taken away, then right Y will be taken away too. But if right Y is taken, then\nsurely right Z will also be stripped away. Typically considered a logical fallacy or a type of erroneous\nthinking, the slippery slope assumption found in (some) liberal arguments concerning pornography\npresent a relevant potential harm.\nThere are several key questions that underlie a fruitful discussion concerning pornography: does\npornography, in fact, create and/or promote real harms? If so, what type of harms? What evidence can\nwe provide to justify such harm claims? What types of harms are more detrimental than others? Or, does\npornography reflect a decadent and hedonistic society? If it serves as a reflection of other problems,\ndoes it function as a cathartic means by which to release sexual/aggressive tension? The aim of our\ndiscussion was not intended to provide definitive answers to these questions. We need more research\nand analysis to more accurately determine the supposed harm caused by pornography. Newer media and\ntechnologies make it difficult to truly assess the harm of such an industry. That is why we must\nconclude, albeit tentatively, by stating that pornography is harmful, but not to the extent to which we are\njustified in prohibiting it. It is perhaps most harmful to the young actresses involved in its production\nwho perform under great duress and subordination and who carry emotional scars for subsequent years.\nIt is harmful to viewers as it may create problems for them in developing healthy, meaningful\nrelationships. However, these noted concerns do not trump the fact that actors and viewers both actively\nengage in pursuing these harmful interests. As such, the ultimate conclusion to this discussion views\npornography as a commodity, as addiction, as exploitation, as perversity, as misogyny, that harms. But it\nis a harm that we must allow to circulate if we truly respect human autonomy, and aspire to grow into\nhealthy, mature adults who are capable of understanding and deliberating on complex, difficult\nquestions.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n17 The Ethics of Pornography: Deliberating on a Modern Harm\nEduardo Salazar 115 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n1.

Why or why not?\n17 The Ethics of Pornography: Deliberating on a Modern Harm\nEduardo Salazar 116 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n18\nThe Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes1\nCHAPTER XIII. OF THE NATURAL CONDITION OF MANKIND, AS CONCERNING THEIR\nFELICITY, AND MISERY\nNature hath made men so equal, in the faculties of body, and mind; as that though there be found one\nman sometimes manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind then another; yet when all is reckoned\ntogether, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable, as that one man can thereupon\nclaim to himself any benefit, to which another may not pretend, as well as he. For as to the strength of\nbody, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination, or by\nconfederacy with others, that are in the same danger with himself.\nAnd as to the faculties of the mind, (setting aside the arts grounded upon words, and especially that skill\nof proceeding upon general, and infallible rules, called Science; which very few have, and but in few\nthings; as being not a native faculty, born with us; nor attained, (as Prudence,) while we look after\nsomewhat else,) I find yet a greater equality amongst men, than that of strength. For Prudence, is but\nExperience; which equal time, equally bestows on all men, in those things they equally apply themselves\nunto. That which may perhaps make such equality incredible, is but a vain concept of one\u2019s own\nwisdom, which almost all men think they have in a greater degree, than the Vulgar; that is, than all men\nbut themselves, and a few others, whom by Fame, or for concurring with themselves, they approve. For\nsuch is the nature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more\neloquent, or more learned; Yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves: For they\nsee their own wit at hand, and other men at a distance. But this proves rather that men are in that point\nequal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything, than\nthat every man is contented with his share.\nFrom Equality Proceeds Diffidence\nFrom this equality of ability, arises equality of hope in the attaining of our Ends. And therefore if any\ntwo men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in\nthe way to their End, (which is principally their own conservation, and sometimes their delectation\nonly,) endeavour to destroy, or subdue one another. And from hence it comes to pass, that where an\nInvader hath no more to fear, than another man\u2019s single power; if one plant, sow, build, or possess a\nconvenient Seat, others may probably be expected to come prepared with forces united, to dispossess,\nand deprive him, not only of the fruit of his labour, but also of his life, or liberty. And the Invader again\nis in the like danger of another.\n1 From: Hobbes, T. (1651). Leviathan. This work is in the Public Domain.\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 117 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nFrom Diffidence War\nAnd from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to secure himself, so reasonable, as\nAnticipation; that is, by force, or wiles, to master the persons of all men he can, so long, till he see no\nother power great enough to endanger him: And this is no more than his own conservation requires, and\nis generally allowed. Also because there be some, that taking pleasure in contemplating their own power\nin the acts of conquest, which they pursue farther than their security requires; if others, that otherwise\nwould be glad to be at ease within modest bounds, should not by invasion increase their power, they\nwould not be able, long time, by standing only on their defence, to subsist. And by consequence, such\naugmentation of dominion over men, being necessary to a man\u2019s conservation, it ought to be allowed\nhim.\nAgain, men have no pleasure, (but on the contrary a great deal of grief) in keeping company, where\nthere is no power able to over-awe them all. For every man looks that his companion should value him,\nat the same rate he sets upon himself: And upon all signs of contempt, or undervaluing, naturally\nendeavours, as far as he dares (which amongst them that have no common power, to keep them in quiet,\nis far enough to make them destroy each other,) to extort a greater value from his condemners, by\ndammage; and from others, by the example.\nSo that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, Competition; Secondly,\nDiffidence; Thirdly, Glory.\nThe first, makes men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the third, for Reputation. The first use\nViolence, to make themselves Masters of other men\u2019s persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to\ndefend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of\nundervalue, either direct in their Persons, or by reflection in their Kindred, their Friends, their Nation,\ntheir Profession, or their Name.\nOut Of Civil States,\nThere Is Always War Of Every One Against Every One Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men\nlive without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War;\nand such a war, as is of every man, against every man. For WAR, consists not in Battle only, or the act\nof fighting; but in a tract of time, wherein the Will to contend by Battle is sufficiently known: and\ntherefore the notion of Time, is to be considered in the nature of War; as it is in the nature of Weather.\nFor as the nature of Foul weather, lies not in a shower or two of rain; but in an inclination thereto of\nmany days together: So the nature of War, consists not in actual fighting; but in the known disposition\nthereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is PEACE.\nThe Incommodities Of Such A War\nWhatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of War, where every man is Enemy to every man; the\nsame is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength,\nand their own invention shall furnish them with all. In such condition, there is no place for Industry;\nbecause the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 118 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nof the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving,\nand removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of\nTime; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent\ndeath; And the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\nIt may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things; that Nature should thus\ndissociate, and render men apt to invade, and destroy one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to\nthis Inference, made from the Passions, desire perhaps to have the same confirmed by Experience. Let\nhim therefore consider with himself, when taking a journey, he arms himself, and seeks to go well\naccompanied; when going to sleep, he locks his doors; when even in his house he locks his chests; and\nthis when he knows there bee Laws, and public Officers, armed, to revenge all injuries shall be done\nhim; what opinion he has of his fellow subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow Citizens, when he\nlocks his doors; and of his children, and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much\naccuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words? But neither of us accuse man\u2019s nature in it. The\nDesires, and other Passions of man, are in themselves no Sin. No more are the Actions, that proceed\nfrom those Passions, till they know a Law that forbids them; which till Lawes be made they cannot\nknow: nor can any Law be made, till they have agreed upon the Person that shall make it.\nIt may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time, nor condition of war as this; and I believe\nit was never generally so, over all the world: but there are many places, where they live so now. For the\nsavage people in many places of America, except the government of small Families, the concord\nwhereof depends on natural lust, have no government at all; and live at this day in that brutish manner,\nas I said before. Howsoever, it may be perceived what manner of life there would be, where there were\nno common Power to fear; by the manner of life, which men that have formerly lived under a peaceful\ngovernment, use to degenerate into, in a civil War.\nBut though there had never been any time, wherein particular men were in a condition of war one\nagainst another; yet in all times, Kings, and persons of Sovereign authority, because of their\nIndependency, are in continual jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators; having their\nweapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another; that is, their Forts, Garrisons, and Guns upon the\nFrontiers of their Kingdoms; and continual Spies upon their neighbours; which is a posture of War. But\nbecause they uphold thereby, the Industry of their Subjects; there does not follow from it, that misery,\nwhich accompanies the Liberty of particular men.\nIn Such A War, Nothing Is Unjust\nTo this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent; that nothing can be Unjust. The\nnotions of Right and Wrong, Justice and Injustice have there no place. Where there is no common\nPower, there is no Law: where no Law, no Injustice. Force, and Fraud, are in war the two Cardinal\nvirtues. Justice, and Injustice are none of the Faculties neither of the Body, nor Mind. If they were, they\nmight be in a man that were alone in the world, as well as his Senses, and Passions. They are Qualities,\nthat relate to men in Society, not in Solitude. It is consequent also to the same condition, that there be no\nPropriety, no Dominion, no Mine and Thine distinct; but only that to be every mans that he can get; and\nfor so long, as he can keep it. And thus much for the ill condition, which man by mere Nature is actually\nplaced in; though with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the Passions, partly in his\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 119 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nReason.\nThe Passions That Incline Men To Peace\nThe Passions that incline men to Peace, are Fear of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to\ncommodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them. And Reason suggests convenient\nArticles of Peace, upon which men may be drawn to agreement. These Articles, are they, which\notherwise are called the Lawes of Nature: whereof I shall speak more particularly, in the two following\nChapters.\nCHAPTER XIV. OF THE FIRST AND SECOND NATURALL LAWES, AND OF CONTRACTS\nRight Of Nature What\nThe RIGHT OF NATURE, which Writers commonly call Jus Natural, is the Liberty each man hath, to\nuse his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own\nLife; and consequently, of doing anything, which in his own Judgement, and Reason, he shall conceive\nto be the aptest means thereunto.\nLiberty What\nBy LIBERTY, is understood, according to the proper signification of the word, the absence of external\nImpediments: which Impediments, may oft take away part of a man\u2019s power to do what he would; but\ncannot hinder him from using the power left him, according as his judgement, and reason shall dictate to\nhim.\nA Law Of Nature What\nA LAW OF NATURE, (Lex Naturalis,) is a Precept, or general Rule, found out by Reason, by which a\nman is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the\nsame; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may be best preserved. For though they that speak of this\nsubject, use to confound Jus, and Lex, Right and Law; yet they ought to be distinguished; because\nRIGHT, consists in liberty to do, or to forbear; Whereas LAW, determines, and binds to one of them: so\nthat Law, and Right, differ as much, as Obligation, and Liberty; which in one and the same matter are\ninconsistent.\nNaturally Every Man Has Right To Everything\nAnd because the condition of Man, (as hath been declared in the precedent Chapter) is a condition of\nWar of every one against every one; in which case everyone is governed by his own Reason; and there is\nnothing he can make use of, that may not be a help unto him, in preserving his life against his enemies;\nIt follows, that in such a condition, every man has a Right to everything; even to one another\u2019s body.\nAnd therefore, as long as this natural Right of every man to everything endures, there can be no security\nto any man, (how strong or wise soever he be,) of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily allows\nmen to live.\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 120 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThe Fundamental Law Of Nature\nAnd consequently it is a precept, or general rule of Reason, \"That every man, ought to endeavour Peace,\nas farre as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps,\nand advantages of War.\" The first branch, of which Rule, contains the first, and Fundamental Law of\nNature; which is, \"To seek Peace, and follow it.\" The Second, the sum of the Right of Nature; which is,\n\"By all means we can, to defend ourselves.\"\nThe Second Law Of Nature\nFrom this Fundamental Law of Nature, by which men are commanded to endeavour Peace, is derived\nthis second Law; \"That a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth, as for Peace, and defence\nof himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much\nliberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.\" For as long as every man holds\nthis Right, of doing anything he likes; so long are all men in the condition of War. But if other men will\nnot lay down their Right, as well as he; then there is no Reason for any one, to divest himself of his: For\nthat were to expose himself to Prey, (which no man is bound to) rather than to dispose himself to Peace.\nThis is that Law of the Gospel; \"Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do ye to\nthem.\"...\nCHAPTER XV. OF OTHER LAWS OF NATURE\nThe Third Law Of Nature, Justice\nFrom that law of Nature, by which we are obliged to transfer to another, such Rights, as being retained,\nhinder the peace of Mankind, there follows a Third; which is this, That Men Perform Their Covenants\nMade: without which, Covenants are in vain, and but Empty words; and the Right of all men to all\nthings remaining, we are still in the condition of War.\nJustice And Injustice What\nAnd in this law of Nature, consists the Fountain and Original of JUSTICE. For where no Covenant hath\npreceded, there hath no Right been transferred, and every man has right to everything; and consequently,\nno action can be Unjust. But when a Covenant is made, then to break it is Unjust: And the definition of\nINJUSTICE, is no other than The Not Performance Of Covenant. And whatsoever is not Unjust, is Just.\nJustice And Propriety Begin With The Constitution of Common-wealth But because Covenants of\nmutual trust, where there is a fear of not performance on either part, (as hath been said in the former\nChapter,) are invalid; though the Original of Justice be the making of Covenants; yet Injustice actually\nthere can be none, till the cause of such fear be taken away; which while men are in the natural condition\nof War, cannot be done. Therefore before the names of Just, and Unjust can have place, there must be\nsome coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants, by the terrour of\nsome punishment, greater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their Covenant; and to make\ngood that Propriety, which by mutual Contract men acquire, in recompence of the universal Right they\nabandon: and such power there is none before the erection of a Commonwealth. And this is also to be\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 121 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ngathered out of the ordinary definition of Justice in the Schools: For they say, that \"Justice is the\nconstant Will of giving to every man his own.\" And therefore where there is no Own, that is, no\nPropriety, there is no Injustice; and where there is no coercive Power erected, that is, where there is no\nCommon-wealth, there is no Propriety; all men having Right to all things: Therefore where there is no\nCommon-wealth, there nothing is Unjust. So that the nature of Justice, consists in keeping of valid\nCovenants: but the Validity of Covenants begins not but with the Constitution of a Civil Power,\nsufficient to compel men to keep them: And then it is also that Propriety begins.\nJustice Not Contrary To Reason\nThe Fool hath said in his heart, there is no such thing as Justice; and sometimes also with his tongue;\nseriously alleging, that every man\u2019s conservation, and contentment, being committed to his own care,\nthere could be no reason, why every man might not do what he thought conduced thereunto; and\ntherefore also to make, or not make; keep, or not keep Covenants, was not against Reason, when it\nconduced to ones benefit. He does not therein deny, that there be Covenants; and that they are\nsometimes broken, sometimes kept; and that such breach of them may be called Injustice, and the\nobservance of them Justice: but he questions, whether Injustice, taking away the fears of God, (for the\nsame Fool hath said in his heart there is no God,) may not sometimes stand with that Reason, which\ndictates to every man his own good; and particularly then, when it conduces to such a benefit, as shall\nput a man in a condition, to neglect not only the dispraise, and revilings, but also the power of other\nmen...yet it can never be against Reason, seeing all the voluntary actions of men tend to the benefit of\nthemselves; and those actions are most Reasonable, that conduce most to their ends. This specious\nreasoning is nevertheless false.\nFor the question is not of promises mutual, where there is no security of performance on either side; as\nwhen there is no Civil Power erected over the parties promising; for such promises are no Covenants:\nBut either where one of the parties has performed already; or where there is a Power to make him\nperform; there is the question whether it be against reason, that is, against the benefit of the other to\nperform, or not. And I say it is not against reason. For the manifestation whereof, we are to consider;\nFirst, that when a man doth a thing, which notwithstanding anything can be foreseen, and reckoned on,\ntends to his own destruction, howsoever some accident which he could not expect, arriving may turn it\nto his benefit; yet such events do not make it reasonably or wisely done. Secondly, that in a condition of\nWar, wherein every man to every man, for want of a common Power to keep them all in awe, is an\nEnemy, there is no man can hope by his own strength, or wit, to defend himself from destruction,\nwithout the help of Confederates; where everyone expects the same defence by the Confederation, that\nanyone else does: and therefore he which declares he thinks it reason to deceive those that help him, can\nin reason expect no other means of safety, than what can be had from his own single Power. He\ntherefore that breaks his Covenant, and consequently declares that he thinks he may with reason do so,\ncannot be received into any Society, that unite themselves for Peace and defence, but by the errour of\nthem that receive him; nor when he is received, be retained in it, without seeing the danger of their\nerrour; which errours a man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security; and therefore if\nhe be left, or cast out of Society, he perishes; and if he live in Society, it is by the errours of other men,\nwhich he could not foresee, nor reckon upon; and consequently against the reason of his preservation;\nand so, as all men that contribute not to his destruction, forbear him only out of ignorance of what is\ngood for themselves.\n18 The Social Contract\nThomas Hobbes 122 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

Aristotle, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill all\nassume it simply is the most valuable thing, motivation, and goal in our lives. But they each take a\ndifferent view on it and how it relates to doing what\u2019s right: For Aristotle, it is not the factor that should\nmotivate us (in some sense, genuine happiness is the side-effect of living a good life), Bentham equates\nhappiness with pleasure, and Mill believes that happiness is a robust concept that can, and should be,\nused to drive every decision we make. Even Immanuel Kant, the big opponent of consequentialist ethics,\nrecognizes that happiness is simply a good thing we desire, even though he believes it plays no role in\ndetermining the rightness and wrongness of actions.\nThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019, Mike Mitchell), the almost-as-entertaining follow-up\nto the shockingly creative Lego Movie (2014, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Chris McKay), contains\nthe song, \u201cEverything\u2019s Not Awesome\u201d (2019, Shawn Patterson, Jo Li, and The Lonely Island), a\nbrilliant parody of the film series\u2019 marquee song, \u201cEverything is Awesome\u201d (2014, Shawn Patterson, Jo\nLi, and The Lonely Island). I mention these movies and songs for two reasons: firstly, watching them\nwill bring happiness into your life; secondly, there are some excellent lyrics on happiness to be found in\nthis act of self-parody. In the original song, the lyrics are:\n\u201cEverything is awesome, everything is cool when you\u2019re part of a team\nEverything is awesome, when you're living out a dream\nEverything is better when we stick together\nSome have said you and I are gonna win forever\nLet\u2019s party forever\u201d\nThese lines get parodied in \u201cEverything\u2019s not Awesome\u201d as:\n\u201cEverything's not awesome\nThings can't be awesome all of the time\nIt's an unrealistic expectation\nBut that doesn't mean we shouldn't try\nTo make everything awesome\nIn a less idealistic kind of way.\nWe should maybe aim for not bad\u201d\nThese lyrics actually capture how happiness of often approached in ethics: pure, amazing\nawesomeness is what we should strive for, even if it\u2019s not possible. We need to study it as an ideal if we\nare we are to have a chance of achieving anything close to it. At the very least, we should aim for the\nopposite of miserableness. There are many aspects to happiness, and this Unit will cover a variety of\nconcepts, theories, and approaches that are associated with it.\nChapter 19, Is Pleasure all that Matters? Thoughts on the \u201cExperience Machine\u201d by Prabhpal\nSingh, analyzes a famous thought experiment that attempts to illustrate that, while we desire pleasure,\nthere is more to life than simply having it. Chapter 20, Utilitarianism by J.S. Mill, is an important\nselection from the classic work by the influential 19th century philosopher where he lays out the basics\nof his moral theory of utilitarianism. Chapter 21, Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons by B.M. Wooldridge,\nUNIT FOUR: HAPPINESS 124 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nruns through the appeal of utilitarianism along with some of its shortcomings. Chapter 22,\nExistentialism, Genetic Engineering, and the Meaning of Life: The Fifths, is a fictional short story that\nlooks at the perspective of an interstellar colonist whose life is to be lived entirely on a spaceship for a\njourney that he did not begin and will not be able to complete. Chapter 23, The Solitude of the Self by\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, is a classic piece by the influential 19th century social and political reformer that\npresents the reasons for sexual equality while giving attention to the differences that often exist between\nthe sexes. Chapter 24, Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma by Douglas E.\nHill, discusses a famous problem in the interdisciplinary field of Game Theory which has an important\nimpact on how we appreciate our own happiness in relation to others.\nUNIT FOUR: HAPPINESS 125 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n19\nIs Pleasure all that Matters? Thoughts on\nthe \u201cExperience Machine\u201d\nPrabhpal Singh1\nThe notion of Hedonism is one of serious philosophical significance, especially in accounts of\nhuman action and motivations, and in ethical accounts of good and happy human lives. The term\n\u2018Hedonism\u2019 is derived from the Greek word \u2018h\u0113done\u2019, meaning \u2018pleasure\u2019. There are two doctrines of\nHedonism, one being the descriptive thesis of Psychological Hedonism, which states that only pleasure\nmotivates us, and the other being the normative thesis of Ethical Hedonism, which states that pleasure is\nthe only good and promoting pleasure is what makes one\u2019s life a valuable and happy one.\nMy aim is to argue against both doctrines of Hedonism. I will consider some philosophical\ncriticisms and counter examples against both views, including discussion of Robert Nozick\u2019s famous\n\u2018Experience Machine\u20192 thought experiment, in an attempt to show neither only pleasure motivates us,\nnor pleasure is the only good.\nDeliberate human action involves motivation. Motives can be understood in two ways. Motives\ncan be those things that move a person to action, or motives can be the ultimate ends of an action. The\nhedonistic picture of human motivation holds that only pleasure is a motive for human action. Consider\nthe following claim:\nPsychological Hedonism: Only pleasure motivates us.\nAccording to this claim, it is only pleasure that moves people to action, and only pleasure is the ultimate\nend of human action. On this view, the underlying reason I eat chocolate cake, or go for a walk, or chat\nwith friends is because I find doing these things pleasurable. I pursue my goals with the ultimate aim of\nenjoying the pleasure I would gain from achieving them. This goes for all human actions. We act in\nways we take to promote our pleasure, and avoid acting in ways which promote our displeasure.\nBut is this really all there is to human motivation? Is it really true that only pleasure moves us to\naction? Consider the following examples: A single mother who works multiple jobs in order to save\nmoney to secure her children\u2019s future, or a spy who endures painful torture in order to protect their\nnation\u2019s secrets, or a boy strolling down the street who kicks a rock as he walks by it \u2018just because he\nfelt like it\u2019. It is not clear in these examples that the person acting is doing so only for the sake of\npleasure. What pleasure does the single mother gain from laboring away while trying to support her\nchildren? Is that she loves and cares about her children and their future not a more plausible motive for\nher actions rather than that she finds laboring her life away pleasurable? Does the spy not endure pain\nfor the reason that they deeply value loyalty to their nation rather than for the sake of some masochistic\npleasure? Do people not sometimes just do things \u2018for the hell of it\u2019?\n1 Prabhpal Singh is from Canada, and holds an MA in Philosophy from Wilfrid Laurier University and an Honours BA in\nPhilosophy from the University of Toronto.

Thoughts on the \u201cExperience Machine\u201d\nPrabhpal Singh 126 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nIf it is the case that people do sometimes act on and for motives other than pleasure, then the\nthesis of Psychological hedonism is false. The examples mentioned above are meant to illustrate\ninstances in which this is precisely the case. It is highly intuitive that the people in those examples are\nnot solely motivated by the promotion of their own pleasure. This is reason to doubt the thesis of\nPsychological Hedonism.\nThe Psychological Hedonist may insist that the people in these cases do have motives besides\npleasure, but that these motives are ultimately reducible to pleasure. The single mother struggles to\nsupport her children because she wants to see them grow, but having them grow safe and healthy is\nsomething that brings her pleasure. The spy takes pleasure in the knowledge that they have remained\nloyal to their country. And the boy finds some pleasure in doing some things \u2018just for the hell of it\u2019. If\nthis is the case, then pleasure is still their fundamental motivation, just in an underlying manner.\nIt may very well be the case the single mother, the spy, and the boy on the street really are acting\nfor nothing more than pleasure, but someone who accepts the thesis of Psychological Hedonism must\nexplain why the possible alternative motives are not the correct ones, and only pleasure is in fact what\nmoves them to action. In other words, sure, our motivations could be reducible to the promotion of\npleasure, but how can we distinguish pleasure as the fundamental motive in the above mentioned cases?\nThe Psychological Hedonist could provide hedonic accounts for each of the mentioned examples, but\ntheir explanations lack determinacy. There is not a way for the Psychological Hedonist to demonstrate\nthat pleasure in fact is the fundamental motive for those actors. There is a burden of proof for the\nPsychological Hedonist to explain why our intuitions in certain cases are the incorrect ones and the\nhedonic picture of human motivation is the correct one. The challenge for the Psychological Hedonist in\ndefending their thesis is to explain why it often appears people act for lots of reasons and motives\nbeyond pleasure, something they cannot determine. Given that many human actions are intuitively\nmotivated by a variety of things besides pleasure, pleasure is not the only thing that motivates us.\nTherefore the thesis of Psychological Hedonism is false.\nAs mentioned, Psychological Hedonism is only a descriptive thesis, meaning it is only a claim\nabout how we in fact behave and are. It does not tell us how we should be. In other words, it is not a\nnormative thesis. The normative thesis, called Ethical Hedonism, is as follows:\nEthical Hedonism: Only pleasure has value or worth, and only displeasure has disvalue or the\nopposite of worth.\nOn this view, what makes something (like a course of action, or state of affairs) good, valuable, or\nworthwhile is the pleasure that thing produces. For the Ethical Hedonist, pleasure is the only thing to\nconsider when it comes to evaluating things as good or valuable. This means that what makes giving to\ncharity, or helping a friend, or volunteering at a soup kitchen good is that these things produce pleasure.\nThe same goes for all other goods as well, for what it means for something to be good is for it to\nproduce pleasure.\nBut, why think the thesis of Ethical Hedonism is true? Is it really the case that pleasure is all\nthere is to what is good, valuable, or worthwhile? While Ethical Hedonism may seem simple and\nattractive, perhaps even intuitive to some, it faces serious problems. One potential problem for this view\nis that it does not account for values besides pleasure. By claiming only pleasure is good, it leaves out\nother things that seem to be, at least intuitively, good and valuable.\nOne way to think about the notion that there may be things valuable beyond pleasure is to\nconsider the famous thought experiment presented by Philosopher Robert Nozick in his 1974 book,\n19 Is Pleasure all that Matters? Thoughts on the \u201cExperience Machine\u201d\nPrabhpal Singh 127 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia. In chapter 3 of his book, Nozick invites us to imagine what he calls the\n\u2018Experience Machine\u20193. Nozick writes:\n\u201cSuppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you desired.\nSuperduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that you would think and feel you\nwere writing a great novel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the time you\nwould be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your brain. Should you plug into this\nmachine for life, preprogramming your life's experiences?\u201d4\nAnyone who plugs into the machine will be able to experience anything they desire. If you wanted to\nexperience climbing a mountain, or winning Olympic gold, you could. What experience(s) you choose\nto have while plugged into the machine will be indiscernible from those same experience(s) you would\nhave if you had them outside of the machine. You could stay plugged in as long or as little as you like. If\nyou wanted, you could plug into an endless stream of pleasurable experiences. The question Nozick asks\nis should you enter the machine? It sure is tempting. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to experience\nendless pleasure? However, Nozick argues we should not enter the machine. This is because there seems\nto be more that matters besides how our lives feel like \u2018from the inside\u2019.\nNozick draws a distinction between actually doing something and merely having an experience\nof doing something. One reason to not enter the machine is because whatever experiences you have in\nthe machine will not be reflective of a reality beyond your first-person experience. If I climb a mountain\nin the machine, I will not have truly climbed a mountain. If I play the experience of winning Olympic\ngold, I have only done so in my own mind, not in reality. This also applies to being a certain way. We\nalso want to be certain sorts of people. Nozick argues that while plugged into the machine, we cannot\nknow what sort of people we are, if we are courageous, kind, intelligent, or loving because we have only\nthe experiences produced by the machine. It is important to us what we actually do and who we actually\nare beyond simulated experience. According to Nozick, plugging into the machine is a kind of\n\u2018suicide\u20195, one in which we lose all connection to reality, despite being able to simulate it. For Nozick,\nthe Experience Machine thought experiment is meant to show there are things that matter to us beyond\nhow our lives feel \u2018from the inside\u2019.\nPleasure is a feeling which exists only in our minds as an experience. Nozick\u2019s thought\nexperiment invites us to not only think about the distinction between mere experience and external\nreality, but also the value of mere experiences as opposed to real experiences. If Nozick is right that we\nshould not enter the machine for the reason that really doing something and really being some way\nmatter beyond merely having the experience of doing or being, then it looks like there is value and\nworth in things being real and true. If it is the case that realness and truth are valuable, then it follows\nthat not only pleasure is valuable. So, if pleasure is not the only thing which is valuable or worthwhile,\nthen the thesis of Ethical Hedonism is false.\nBut one could object to Nozick, and argue it would be good to enter the machine. Why should\nwe think that \u2018real\u2019 experiences are any better than non-real ones? After all, one of the stipulations of\nentering the machine is that the experiences in it would be indiscernible from \u2018real\u2019 ones, so what does it\nmatter if they are not the real deal? If I can have the experience of climbing a mountain, or winning\nOlympic gold, who cares if I did not actually do it? To answer this, consider a further example:\n3 Nozick. 1974. p. 42-45\n4 Nozick. 1974, p. 42\n5 Nozick. 1974, p. 43\n19 Is Pleasure all that Matters? Thoughts on the \u201cExperience Machine\u201d\nPrabhpal Singh 128 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nIn universe A, Avery loves Blair, and Blair loves Avery back. Avery has many experiences with\nBlair, all of which Avery always finds very pleasing.\nIn universe B, Avery loves Blair, but Blair only pretends to love Avery back. Blair is just using\nAvery and actually does not love Avery at all. Avery never catches on to Blair\u2019s act.\nWhile Avery from universe A and Avery from universe B have identical experiences and therefore feel\nidentical pleasure in their respective situations, would we want to say that their lives are equally good?\nIf we accept the thesis of Ethical Hedonism, then we must accept that there is no difference in\nthe quality of Avery\u2019s life in the different universes. But does there not seem to be something wrong\nwith Avery\u2019s life in universe B independently of their experiences? It seems to me that Avery in\nuniverse B is essentially living a lie, one in which they falsely believe they are loved when in fact they\nare not. Their relationship with Blair is a substance-less illusion. This example and Nozick\u2019s experience\nmachine demonstrate that being in touch with reality and not being deceived, and not having false\nbeliefs of one\u2019s situation, have value and are important for a good life. The core distinction at work here\nis between our first-person experience of the world, and the world itself. Because there is a difference in\nhow our lives feel like to us, and how they actually are, it is the question of what makes a happy life is\nnot only about what a happy life might feel like. A pleasurable life feels good, but it does not follow\nfrom this that it is good. The distinction between feeling and being, much like the distinction between\nexperiencing and being suggest there is more to a good and happy life than merely experiencing\npleasure. If there is more to a happy life than how it feels to us, then pleasure cannot be the only thing of\nvalue or worth. Therefore, the thesis of Ethical Hedonism is false.\nIf Nozick\u2019s thought experiment successfully demonstrates that pleasure is not the only thing of\nvalue, and in so far as there are any values, then there is a plurality of values. On this Value Pluralist\nview, there is a variety of distinct values that each contribute to a happy life. A happy life will then\ndepend upon realizing not just pleasure, but other values as well. Some candidates for these other values\nmay include truth, knowledge, love, courage, respect, faith, peace, honesty, and virtue (of course, this is\nnot an exhaustive list).\nIn conclusion, both the Psychological and Ethical theses of Hedonism are false. People often act\non variety of motives beyond the promotion of pleasure. Furthermore, the ethical considerations brought\nto light by Nozick\u2019s Experience Machine thought experiment indicate there is more to a good life than\nhow things are like from our first-person experience. Because pleasure is mere experience, and there are\nthings which matter beyond mere experience, pleasure is not the only thing good, valuable, or\nworthwhile.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Is pleasure the most important \u201cgood\u201d in our lives? If so, why? If not, what else matters?\n2. Would you plug into the experience machine? Why or why not?\n3. Can you come up with your own version of the experience machine that would be more appealing to\nmore people?\n19 Is Pleasure all that Matters? Thoughts on the \u201cExperience Machine\u201d\nPrabhpal Singh 129 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n20\nUtilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill1\nChapter 2\nWhat Utilitarianism Is.\n\u2026The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle,\nholds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to\nproduce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by\nunhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure. To give a clear view of the moral standard set up by the\ntheory, much more requires to be said; in particular, what things it includes in the ideas of pain and\npleasure; and to what extent this is left an open question. But these supplementary explanations do not\naffect the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded- namely, that pleasure, and freedom\nfrom pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things (which are as numerous in\nthe utilitarian as in any other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as\nmeans to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.\nNow, such a theory of life excites in many minds, and among them in some of the most estimable in\nfeeling and purpose, inveterate dislike. To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than\npleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit- they designate as utterly mean and\ngrovelling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early\nperiod, contemptuously likened; and modern holders of the doctrine are occasionally made the subject of\nequally polite comparisons by its German, French, and English assailants.\nWhen thus attacked, the Epicureans have always answered, that it is not they, but their accusers, who\nrepresent human nature in a degrading light; since the accusation supposes human beings to be capable\nof no pleasures except those of which swine are capable. If this supposition were true, the charge could\nnot be gainsaid, but would then be no longer an imputation; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely\nthe same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good\nenough for the other. The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading,\nprecisely because a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a human being's conceptions of happiness. Human\nbeings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them,\ndo not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. I do not, indeed, consider\nthe Epicureans to have been by any means faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences from\nthe utilitarian principle. To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic, as well as Christian elements\nrequire to be included. But there is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the\npleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments, a much higher\nvalue as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. It must be admitted, however, that utilitarian writers\nin general have placed the superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency,\n1 From: Mill, J.S. (1863). Utilitarianism. This work is in the Public Domain.\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 130 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nsafety, uncostliness, etc., of the former- that is, in their circumstantial advantages rather than in their\nintrinsic nature. And on all these points utilitarians have fully proved their case; but they might have\ntaken the other, and, as it may be called, higher ground, with entire consistency. It is quite compatible\nwith the principle of utility to recognise the fact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and\nmore valuable than others. It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is\nconsidered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity\nalone.\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more\nvaluable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible\nanswer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a\ndecided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable\npleasure. If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above\nthe other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent,\nand would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are\njustified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity as\nto render it, in comparison, of small account.\nNow it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with, and equally capable of\nappreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which\nemploys their higher faculties. Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower\nanimals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would\nconsent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience\nwould be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is\nbetter satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they possess more than\nhe for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires which they have in common with him. If they\never fancy they would, it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme, that to escape from it they would\nexchange their lot for almost any other, however undesirable in their own eyes. A being of higher\nfaculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly\naccessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never\nreally wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence. We may give what explanation\nwe please of this unwillingness; we may attribute it to pride, a name which is given indiscriminately to\nsome of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which mankind are capable: we may\nrefer it to the love of liberty and personal independence, an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of\nthe most effective means for the inculcation of it; to the love of power, or to the love of excitement, both\nof which do really enter into and contribute to it: but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of\ndignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in exact,\nproportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it\nis strong, that nothing which conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire\nto them.\nWhoever supposes that this preference takes place at a sacrifice of happiness- that the superior being, in\nanything like equal circumstances, is not happier than the inferior- confounds the two very different\nideas, of happiness, and content. It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low,\nhas the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly endowed being will always feel that\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 131 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nany happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear\nits imperfections, if they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed\nunconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all the good which those\nimperfections qualify. It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be\nSocrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because\nthey only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.\nIt may be objected, that many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence\nof temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the\nintrinsic superiority of the higher. Men often, from infirmity of character, make their election for the\nnearer good, though they know it to be the less valuable; and this no less when the choice is between\ntwo bodily pleasures, than when it is between bodily and mental. They pursue sensual indulgences to the\ninjury of health, though perfectly aware that health is the greater good.\nIt may be further objected, that many who begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble, as they\nadvance in years sink into indolence and selfishness. But I do not believe that those who undergo this\nvery common change, voluntarily choose the lower description of pleasures in preference to the higher. I\nbelieve that before they devote themselves exclusively to the one, they have already become incapable\nof the other. Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures a very tender plant, easily killed, not only\nby hostile influences, but by mere want of sustenance; and in the majority of young persons it speedily\ndies away if the occupations to which their position in life has devoted them, and the society into which\nit has thrown them, are not favourable to keeping that higher capacity in exercise. Men lose their high\naspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes, because they have not time or opportunity for indulging\nthem; and they addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but\nbecause they are either the only ones to which they have access, or the only ones which they are any\nlonger capable of enjoying. It may be questioned whether any one who has remained equally susceptible\nto both classes of pleasures, ever knowingly and calmly preferred the lower; though many, in all ages,\nhave broken down in an ineffectual attempt to combine both.\nFrom this verdict of the only competent judges, I apprehend there can be no appeal. On a question which\nis the best worth having of two pleasures, or which of two modes of existence is the most grateful to the\nfeelings, apart from its moral attributes and from its consequences, the judgment of those who are\nqualified by knowledge of both, or, if they differ, that of the majority among them, must be admitted as\nfinal. And there needs be the less hesitation to accept this judgment respecting the quality of pleasures,\nsince there is no other tribunal to be referred to even on the question of quantity. What means are there\nof determining which is the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations, except\nthe general suffrage of those who are familiar with both? Neither pains nor pleasures are homogeneous,\nand pain is always heterogeneous with pleasure. What is there to decide whether a particular pleasure is\nworth purchasing at the cost of a particular pain, except the feelings and judgment of the experienced?\nWhen, therefore, those feelings and judgment declare the pleasures derived from the higher faculties to\nbe preferable in kind, apart from the question of intensity, to those of which the animal nature, disjoined\nfrom the higher faculties, is suspectible, they are entitled on this subject to the same regard.\nI have dwelt on this point, as being a necessary part of a perfectly just conception of Utility or\nHappiness, considered as the directive rule of human conduct. But it is by no means an indispensable\ncondition to the acceptance of the utilitarian standard; for that standard is not the agent's own greatest\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 132 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nhappiness, but the greatest amount of happiness altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a\nnoble character is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt that it makes other people\nhappier, and that the world in general is immensely a gainer by it. Utilitarianism, therefore, could only\nattain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character, even if each individual were only\nbenefited by the nobleness of others, and his own, so far as happiness is concerned, were a sheer\ndeduction from the benefit. But the bare enunciation of such an absurdity as this last, renders refutation\nsuperfluous.\nAccording to the Greatest Happiness Principle, as above explained, the ultimate end, with reference to\nand for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that\nof other people), is an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and as rich as possible in\nenjoyments, both in point of quantity and quality; the test of quality, and the rule for measuring it against\nquantity, being the preference felt by those who in their opportunities of experience, to which must be\nadded their habits of self-consciousness and self-observation, are best furnished with the means of\ncomparison. This, being, according to the utilitarian opinion, the end of human action, is necessarily also\nthe standard of morality; which may accordingly be defined, the rules and precepts for human conduct,\nby the observance of which an existence such as has been described might be, to the greatest extent\npossible, secured to all mankind; and not to them only, but, so far as the nature of things admits, to the\nwhole sentient creation\u2026\n\u2026I must again repeat, what the assailants of utilitarianism seldom have the justice to acknowledge, that\nthe happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct, is not the agent's own\nhappiness, but that of all concerned. As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism\nrequires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator. In the golden rule of\nJesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by,\nand to love your neighbour as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality. As the\nmeans of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social\narrangements should place the happiness, or (as speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of\nevery individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that\neducation and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to\nestablish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the\ngood of the whole; especially between his own happiness and the practice of such modes of conduct,\nnegative and positive, as regard for the universal happiness prescribes; so that not only he may be unable\nto conceive the possibility of happiness to himself, consistently with conduct opposed to the general\ngood, but also that a direct impulse to promote the general good may be in every individual one of the\nhabitual motives of action, and the sentiments connected therewith may fill a large and prominent place\nin every human being's sentient existence. If the, impugners of the utilitarian morality represented it to\ntheir own minds in this its, true character, I know not what recommendation possessed by any other\nmorality they could possibly affirm to be wanting to it; what more beautiful or more exalted\ndevelopments of human nature any other ethical system can be supposed to foster, or what springs of\naction, not accessible to the utilitarian, such systems rely on for giving effect to their mandates\u2026\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 133 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nChapter 4\nOf what sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible.\nIT HAS already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary\nacceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the\nfirst premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact,\nmay be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact- namely, our senses, and our\ninternal consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or\nby what other faculty is cognisance taken of them?\nQuestions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is,\nthat happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable\nas means to that end. What ought to be required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the\ndoctrine should fulfil- to make good its claim to be believed?\nThe only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only\nproof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like\nmanner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people\ndo actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in\npractice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason\ncan be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to\nbe attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof\nwhich the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each\nperson's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate\nof all persons. Happiness has made out its title as one of the ends of conduct, and consequently one of\nthe criteria of morality.\nBut it has not, by this alone, proved itself to be the sole criterion. To do that, it would seem, by the same\nrule, necessary to show, not only that people desire happiness, but that they never desire anything else.\nNow it is palpable that they do desire things which, in common language, are decidedly distinguished\nfrom happiness. They desire, for example, virtue, and the absence of vice, no less really than pleasure\nand the absence of pain. The desire of virtue is not as universal, but it is as authentic a fact, as the desire\nof happiness. And hence the opponents of the utilitarian standard deem that they have a right to infer\nthat there are other ends of human action besides happiness, and that happiness is not the standard of\napprobation and disapprobation.\nBut does the utilitarian doctrine deny that people desire virtue, or maintain that virtue is not a thing to be\ndesired? The very reverse. It maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired\ndisinterestedly, for itself. Whatever may be the opinion of utilitarian moralists as to the original\nconditions by which virtue is made virtue; however they may believe (as they do) that actions and\ndispositions are only virtuous because they promote another end than virtue; yet this being granted, and\nit having been decided, from considerations of this description, what is virtuous, they not only place\nvirtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to the ultimate end, but they also recognise\nas a psychological fact the possibility of its being, to the individual, a good in itself, without looking to\nany end beyond it; and hold, that the mind is not in a right state, not in a state conformable to Utility, not\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 134 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nin the state most conducive to the general happiness, unless it does love virtue in this manner- as a thing\ndesirable in itself, even although, in the individual instance, it should not produce those other desirable\nconsequences which it tends to produce, and on account of which it is held to be virtue. This opinion is\nnot, in the smallest degree, a departure from the Happiness principle. The ingredients of happiness are\nvery various, and each of them is desirable in itself, and not merely when considered as swelling an\naggregate. The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any\ngiven exemption from pain, as for example health, is to be looked upon as means to a collective\nsomething termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for\nthemselves; besides being means, they are a part of the end. Virtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine,\nis not naturally and originally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it\ndisinterestedly it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a means to happiness, but as a part\nof their happiness.\nTo illustrate this farther, we may remember that virtue is not the only thing, originally a means, and\nwhich if it were not a means to anything else, would be and remain indifferent, but which by association\nwith what it is a means to, comes to be desired for itself, and that too with the utmost intensity. What,\nfor example, shall we say of the love of money? There is nothing originally more desirable about money\nthan about any heap of glittering pebbles. Its worth is solely that of the things which it will buy; the\ndesires for other things than itself, which it is a means of gratifying. Yet the love of money is not only\none of the strongest moving forces of human life, but money is, in many cases, desired in and for itself;\nthe desire to possess it is often stronger than the desire to use it, and goes on increasing when all the\ndesires which point to ends beyond it, to be compassed by it, are falling off. It may, then, be said truly,\nthat money is desired not for the sake of an end, but as part of the end. From being a means to happiness,\nit has come to be itself a principal ingredient of the individual's conception of happiness. The same may\nbe said of the majority of the great objects of human life- power, for example, or fame; except that to\neach of these there is a certain amount of immediate pleasure annexed, which has at least the semblance\nof being naturally inherent in them; a thing which cannot be said of money. Still, however, the strongest\nnatural attraction, both of power and of fame, is the immense aid they give to the attainment of our other\nwishes; and it is the strong association thus generated between them and all our objects of desire, which\ngives to the direct desire of them the intensity it often assumes, so as in some characters to surpass in\nstrength all other desires. In these cases the means have become a part of the end, and a more important\npart of it than any of the things which they are means to. What was once desired as an instrument for the\nattainment of happiness, has come to be desired for its own sake. In being desired for its own sake it is,\nhowever, desired as part of happiness. The person is made, or thinks he would be made, happy by its\nmere possession; and is made unhappy by failure to obtain it. The desire of it is not a different thing\nfrom the desire of happiness, any more than the love of music, or the desire of health. They are included\nin happiness. They are some of the elements of which the desire of happiness is made up. Happiness is\nnot an abstract idea, but a concrete whole; and these are some of its parts. And the utilitarian standard\nsanctions and approves their being so. Life would be a poor thing, very ill provided with sources of\nhappiness, if there were not this provision of nature, by which things originally indifferent, but\nconducive to, or otherwise associated with, the satisfaction of our primitive desires, become in\nthemselves sources of pleasure more valuable than the primitive pleasures, both in permanency, in the\nspace of human existence that they are capable of covering, and even in intensity.\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 135 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nVirtue, according to the utilitarian conception, is a good of this description. There was no original desire\nof it, or motive to it, save its conduciveness to pleasure, and especially to protection from pain. But\nthrough the association thus formed, it may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great\nintensity as any other good; and with this difference between it and the love of money, of power, or of\nfame, that all of these may, and often do, render the individual noxious to the other members of the\nsociety to which he belongs, whereas there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to them as\nthe cultivation of the disinterested love of virtue. And consequently, the utilitarian standard, while it\ntolerates and approves those other acquired desires, up to the point beyond which they would be more\ninjurious to the general happiness than promotive of it, enjoins and requires the cultivation of the love of\nvirtue up to the greatest strength possible, as being above all things important to the general happiness.\nIt results from the preceding considerations, that there is in reality nothing desired except happiness.\nWhatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is\ndesired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until it has become so.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What is the \u201cGreatest Happiness Principle\u201d? Do you think it is right?\n2. Why does Mill think pleasure is all that matters in morality? Do you think he\u2019s right?\n3. What actions are moral actions according to a utilitarian? Is the color of your socks something you\nmust consider in an important moral way?\n20 Utilitarianism\nJ.S. Mill 136 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n21\nUtilitarianism: Pros and Cons\nB.M. Wooldridge1\nConsequentialism is a general moral theory that tells us that, in any given situation, we should\nperform those actions that lead to better overall consequences. There are generally two branches of\nConsequentialism: Hedonism, which tells us that the consequences we should pursue should be\n\u2018pleasurable\u2019 consequences, and Utilitarianism, which tells us that the consequences we should pursue\nshould be \u2018happy\u2019 consequences. The focus of this paper will be on Utilitarianism, as this is undoubtedly\nthe most popular form of consequentialist theories. John Stuart Mill, one of the foremost Utilitarian\nmoral theorists, sums up Utilitarianism as follows: \u201cactions are right in proportion as they tend to\npromote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\u201d2\nAny account of Utilitarianism will have two central tenets. First, Utilitarians are focused on\nstates of affairs, which means that Utilitarianism is concerned with the result, or consequences, of one\u2019s\nactions, and disregards other features like one\u2019s motives or reasons for acting. One might have good\nmotives or reasons for performing a certain action, but an action is only considered morally good for a\nUtilitarian if it maximizes the consequences, or happiness, of a given situation. Secondly, Utilitarians\nemphasize that agents are to be neutral in making their decisions. What this means is that under\nUtilitarianism, everyone counts for the same, and nobody counts for more than anybody else. Friends,\nfamily members, significant others, and anyone else important to you counts just the same as a complete\nstranger when making a moral decision.\nOn the face of it, this seems like a sensible moral theory. Like any other theory, Utilitarianism\nhas its advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, I will argue that the disadvantages of Utilitarianism\nfar outweigh the advantages. More specifically, I will argue that, despite its initial appeal, there are\nserious problems with Utilitarianism that render it a problematic moral theory. In what follows, I will\nconsider a thought experiment from Bernard Williams to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of\nUtilitarianism, followed by a discussion of why Utilitarianism is a problematic moral theory.\nTo begin, consider the case of George. George has recently completed his PhD in Chemistry,\nand, like any other PhD candidate, finds it extremely difficult to land a job after completing his degree.\nGeorge has a family, and his wife works hard to support them. While she is supportive of George, his\ndifficulty finding a job puts a serious strain on their relationship. An older chemist who knows George\ntells George that he can get him a job in a laboratory. The laboratory pursues research into chemical and\nbiological warfare. George, however, is opposed to chemical and biological warfare, and he therefore\ncannot accept the job. However, if George refuses the job, it will go to a colleague of George\u2019s who does\nnot have any reservations about chemical and biological warfare. Indeed, if this colleague takes the job,\nhe will pursue the research with great zeal. For what it\u2019s worth, George\u2019s wife is not against chemical\n1 Brandon Wooldridge, PhD Candidate, McMaster University. Email: wooldrbm@mcmaster.ca.

Louis Pojam & Peter Tramel\n(Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2009), 158.\n21 Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons\nB.M. Wooldridge 137 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nand biological warfare. Should George take the job?3\nIt seems that a Utilitarian would inform us that George should take the job, for doing so will lead\nto better overall consequences than turning down the job. In taking the job, George will not perform the\nresearch with great enthusiasm. Williams is not clear on whether George will actively sabotage the\nresearch, but it can be reasonably assumed that if George takes the job, he will perform his duties in\nsuch a way that will minimize the impact that chemical and biological research will have on developing\nweapons for war. While George will not directly be saving anyone, his work will indirectly lead to the\nsaving of thousands of lives. Indeed, simply taking the job will ensure that someone who has great\nenthusiasm for chemical and biological warfare does not get the job. So even if George does not directly\nor indirectly save anyone while performing his duties, he will already have maximized the consequences\nby preventing someone who would do great harm from getting the job.\nThis thought experiment is useful in considering the strengths and weaknesses of Utilitarianism.\nLet us first begin with the strengths of the theory. Perhaps the biggest strength of Utilitarianism is that it\nis, at least prima facie, easier to reach a conclusion under this theory than other theories. That is,\nUtilitarianism provides us with a clear path for determining which action in a given situation will be the\ncorrect one: it is that action that will increase utility. This is in contrast to other moral theories, such as\nDeontology, which do not always provide a clear answer. Deontology, for example, focuses on the\nmotives or reasons one has for acting, and it can be difficult sometimes to ascertain what one\u2019s motives\nand/or reasons are. Even if one explicitly outlines their motives or reasons, it is not always the case that\nthis is truthful. The consequences of an action, however, do provide us with a clear criterion for what\ncounts as a morally good action. If one\u2019s action leads to good, or happy, consequences, then that action\nis morally permissible. Thus, Utilitarianism is a theory that can easily help us reach decisions.\nRelating this to the case of George, George\u2019s actions can be judged on whether they will lead to\nbetter consequences. In this case, his action will lead to good consequences, albeit indirectly. In\naccepting the job, George prevents someone else who might indirectly harm others by promoting\nchemical and biological warfare from getting the job. Consider, for a moment, if we judged this action\nnot on the consequences, but rather on the reasons or motives for acting. Suppose George accepts the job\nbecause he is motivated to end chemical and biological warfare, or that his reason for taking the job is to\nhelp support his family. While these reasons might be noble ones, we cannot be clear on whether these\nare actually the motives/reasons that George has. Motives and reasons, in other words, are not as clearly\naccessible as the consequences of an action.\nAnother strength of Utilitarianism is its emphasis on neutrality. When making a decision, one is\nto take a \u2018God\u2019s eye\u2019 view of things, and consider everyone equally. This emphasis on neutrality makes\nUtilitarianism an impartial moral theory, meaning it considers everyone\u2019s status and interests as equal.\nRelating this to the case of George, we see that George needs to assess the situation from a neutral\nperspective. He should not favour his or his family\u2019s interests as opposed to the interests of others who\nmight be impacted by chemical and biological warfare. Even if his wife and family were against\nchemical and biological warfare, and even considering that George himself is against chemical and\nbiological warfare, he needs to put these interests and considerations aside and make the decision that is\nbest for everyone involved.\nWhile Utilitarianism does have its strengths as a theory, it also has some very serious\nweaknesses, and in the remainder of this paper I will outline of these weaknesses and argue why I think\n3 Bernard Williams, \u201cA Critique of Utiliarianism,\u201d in Utilitarianism: For and Against, J.J.C. Smart & Bernard Williams\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973), 98.\n21 Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons\nB.M. Wooldridge 138 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthey make Utilitarianism a problematic moral theory.\nWe can begin by considering the point about neutrality. While Utilitarians will count this as a\nstrength of their theory, it can also be considered a weakness of the theory. In considering everyone\nequally, Utilitarianism devalues the importance of personal relationships. In some cases, following\nUtilitarianism will force us to disregard those who are close to us. Suppose, for instance, that George\u2019s\nwife and children, like George, were also against chemical and biological warfare. Utilitarianism will\ntell us that George should disregard their interests and feelings and perform that action that will increase\nthe consequences. But this seems to be impersonal. The interests, feelings, and desires of George\u2019s\nfamily should matter more than the interests, feelings, and desires of complete strangers, simply because\nthese people are closer to George. Each of us has special relations to individuals that we work hard to\ndevelop, and that, in many cases, help us become better people. To disregard the interests, feelings, and\ndesires of these individuals seems to be wrong.\nI should also point out here that while Utilitarians will consider everyone equally, this does not\nmean that they will treat everyone equally. Consider another example from Williams. Suppose that there\nis a racial minority in a society. This minority does not harm anyone else in the society, nor does it do\nanything particularly good either. However, the other citizens, who make up the majority, have\nprejudices against this minority, and consider its presence very disagreeable, and proposals are put\nforward to remove this minority.4 Williams is not clear on what would be involved in \u2018removing\u2019 the\nminority. The removal of the minority need not involve murder, although it could. It might involve, for\nexample, removing them from society by forcing them to leave the society.\nIt seems that a Utilitarian would be forced to accept that eliminating this minority would increase\nthe happiness for the majority of people, and would therefore be a moral action. But this seems wrong,\nmainly because removing the minority from society would involve what many people take to be morally\nevil actions, which is another problem with Utilitarianism. In some cases, Utilitarianism might sanction\nmorally evil actions in order to achieve morally desirable consequences. Removing the minority might\ninvolve genocide or mass deportations, both of which seem morally problematic. Killing people simply\nbecause they are of a certain race or ethnicity, and/or removing them from a society without just cause,\nare severe moral violations that any reasonable person could not sanction. The idea here is this:\nsometimes, in working to achieve the greatest overall consequences, individuals will be forced to do bad\nthings, and these bad things, even if they increase happiness, are still bad. And it is a failing of\nUtilitarianism that it does not recognize the moral value of labeling these as morally bad actions.\nAt this point a Utilitarian will surely have something to say. A Utilitarian might respond to the\nabove points as follows. All of the critiques I have offered are focused only on the short-term\nconsequences, and not the long-term consequences. When we focus on the long-term consequences of\nthe above cases, the Utilitarian answer will change. For example, if George takes the job, this might lead\nto good consequences in the immediate future. But in the long run, it might lead to bad consequences. It\nmight, for example, cause a serious strain on his marriage, and make George unhappy, which will in turn\naffect his relationships with others. In the racial minority case, while removing the minority might lead\nto better consequences in the short term, it will lead to worse consequences in the long term. It will, for\nexample, weaken the trust among members of a community, and destabilize the social relations of\nindividuals within that community. In response to this, a Utilitarian might adopt a rule, the general\nfollowing of which will lead to better long-term consequences. In so doing, a Utilitarian switches the\nfocus from a version of Utilitarianism that is focused on acts, to one that is focused on rules.\n4 Williams, \u201cA Critique of Utiliarianism,\u201d 105.\n21 Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons\nB.M. Wooldridge 139 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThis response from a Utilitarian fails, in that it invites more questions than what it does answers.\nMainly, just how far into the future should we look when considering the consequences of our actions?\nUtilitarians do not provide a clear answer to this question. Saying that we should focus on the long-term\nconsequences of an action when the implications of the short-term consequences are troubling seems to\nbe problematic. And, moreover, should we really follow a rule when, in the moment, we can perform an\nact that will increase the happiness of others? Adopting rule-utilitarianism as a way to respond to these\nobjections seems not only ad-hoc, but also inconsistent with the Utilitarian maxim of increasing the\nconsequences.\nOverall, the theory of Utilitarianism, while perhaps initially appealing, seems to have some\nserious flaws. While the theory of Utilitarianism might help us more easily reach moral conclusions than\nwhat other theories do, and while it emphasizes the neutrality of moral agents, it does nonetheless have a\ntendency to alienate us from those we are closest to, and might require us to perform actions that, under\nother moral theories, are considered morally problematic. It is for these reasons that Utilitarianism is a\nproblematic moral theory.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What are the benefits of Utilitarianism? Are these benefits enough to convince you that it is the\ncorrect moral theory we should follow?\n2. What are the drawbacks of Utilitarianism? Are these benefits enough to convince you that it is an\nincorrect moral theory we should follow?\n3. If more happiness is produced by not following Utilitarianism, is that what we should do? What does\nthis say about the theory?\n21 Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons\nB.M.

And, in doing this, are nullifying the Articles of the Journey as\nour governing documents. Most importantly this means that all planned genetic pairings, genetic\nselections for offspring, and educational and work placement based on genetic predispositions will be\nhalted immediately, with all citizens of this craft free to mingle and mate with any they so please, birth\noffspring with or without genetic screenings and selections, and pursue whichever studies and careers\nthey so choose. We, the Fifths, are the generation in the middle; the one with the least connection to\nsolid ground and those generations that have or will touch it. Our great-great-grandparents, the Firsts, set\noff on this mission and few of us remember any of them directly; you, our great-great-children, will\ncomplete the journey, and few of us will remain to partake in your joy. Our choices are limited and those\nthat came before and those that come after are entirely reliant upon our willingness to contribute to your\ndream. We are not allowed to have any dreams of our own. Indeed, we can\u2019t. This voyage was expected\nto take 247 years and 57 days. As I write this, the vessel has traveled precisely as was predicted and it\nshould complete the journey exactly as expected. We understand the hope that drove the Firsts to\nembark and leave a dying plant behind, and we have this same hope for your future on a new world\nlight-years away from Earth. It might seem selfish of us to make this decision and turn away from the\nplan, thereby jeopardizing the mission for everyone. But it is only selfish of us to make this decision if\nwe are not afforded the gift of having any hope of our own. It is this hope, the only hope we can find for\nourselves, that has led us to this point.\nOur lives were completely planned for us. Many details of our conception were planned 100\nyears ago when this ship took off: the general time period of our births, the pool of mates that would\nmake up our parents, and the general sets of genes that would be selected for in every single one of us.\nThe Firsts hinged their hopes on their own future progeny carrying out their plans. Without us \u2013 and you\n\u2013 their efforts would be for naught. It\u2019s a burden for all of us, and one that bears heaviest on us Fifths.\nOur lives are defined by the voyage; neither by the home left behind nor the one to come. We will only\never know this ship as our home. So how do we come to love and care for homes and planets that will\nnever be ours? To put it bluntly: we don\u2019t.\nWhether by design or by choice, I do truly love \u2013 and am very gifted at \u2013 my profession: soil\nengineer. I have been genetically gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell, which most of the time\nis more burdensome than beneficial. I can smell and taste every note of every odor and flavor hundreds\nof times stronger than the average person. To control this, my body was also designed such that there are\nno communications between my stomach and my brain to warn of danger.

It\u2019s potentially hazardous, but this\ndanger is worth it for what I can do: I can tell when soils are perfectly fertilized for their chosen crops to\ngrow beautifully. It would seem reasonable to leave this to machines and allow them to maintain the\nprecise chemical balances for plants to grow, but our noses and minds work in complex ways we are\noften unaware of that allow us to perform the delicate calculations required more expertly than a\nmachine. Our subconscious mind works constantly to learn from the complex data we constantly take in.\nA machine can also make a mistake, and if no person had the ability to check the resultant product the\nsoil generators put out, entire crops could be lost. My job is one of the most important on the ship, and I\nam the only one suited to do it. I simply could not choose not to do it without risking everyone and\neverything, and I cannot condemn you to a similar fate. We all should be able to choose the prisons that\nwill restrict our lives.\nOn the planet we left and the new planet you will live on, there will be freedom. Freedom to\nmove, to love, to live, to study, to play, to work, and to die as you see fit. We have not been afforded this\nnecessity; freedom is not even a luxury can work toward. Just as those that are imprisoned unjustly, we\nmust fight for what freedom we can find. Our prison was crafted in a dream from hope, whose beginning\nand end are love: love from the Firsts to you, the Ninths. We have everything provided for us on this\nship and we are not imprisoned here out of hate or revenge, but love. And love can create the strongest\nchains. But this ship is a prison, nonetheless, and our lives are those of slaves. Dryden once wrote, \u201cOh!\nGive me liberty! For were ev\u2019n paradise my prison, Still I should long to leap the crystal walls.\u201d How\ntrue this is.\nWe have made our decision for the same reason our great-great-grandparents left and for the\nsame feeling you will have when you complete the journey: hope. One cannot hope if one does not grab\nwhat little liberty one can. Life is short and humble, and can get its greatest value from contributing to a\ncause greater than oneself. We are doing that, and we are grateful; but we must be able to do so willingly\nand on our own terms. Life is what we make of it, and we want to live. Sisyphus was condemned to\nforever roll a rock up the hill, driven to reach the top, but always failing with one step left. Day after day\nSisyphus experienced this unending task, his punishment for defying the Gods. It was the worst the\npunishment the Greeks could come up with, but Camus knew the secret to transforming this hell into\nheaven: make the task his own, and find pleasure in the punishment itself. \u201cOne must imagine Sisyphus\nhappy,\u201d if he can do this, Camus mused. We are all luminous cave flies whose life is given to feed their\nyoung that will in turn live for the same purpose to feed their young in an endless cycle. But if we make\nthe cycle our own and find our own value in it, then life is wonderful and beautiful. We do this not just\nfor ourselves, but for all that follow: the Sixths, the Sevenths, the Eighths, the Ninths, and everyone that\nwill follow in the new world. We must be free to choose so that you are free to choose. I have accepted \u2013\neven chosen \u2013 my place, but I cannot condemn my children to face the same limitations I have faced.\nYou might have assumed we would be happy, like Sisyphus, in choosing to embrace our fate,\nespecially given that we are provided with everything we need, even a purpose with a goal aimed at a\npurpose bigger than us. So many spend their lives searching for this, but that search is the real value. I\nwould spend all the money in the world to have one day on solid ground. No; one hour. No; one single\nminute would be enough to content my heart. It\u2019s not about being provided for; it is about being able to\nuse those resources wisely to obtain those things that bring value and meaning into our lives. Because of\nthe decisions of those before us, we had no choices. It was a chain that we could only break for you, the\nfuture. We give our own lives to the chain so the Sixths can have their lives for themselves. They can\nchoose to give this freedom to the Sevenths if they please, as well, or they can take it back. That is up to\nthem, but we are giving them the right to choose what they want to do.\n22 Existentialism, Genetic Engineering, and the Meaning of Life: The Fifths\nNoah Levin 142 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nWe have decided to govern ourselves by the laws and rules in the Constitution for the Future\nWorld rather than devise special rules for ourselves. It would be unfair, and we could not come up with\nsomething more finely crafted. The guidelines that the Firsts drafted and that the Seconds revised are\nremarkable, and you were to have the best government mankind has ever devised. We cannot envision a\nbetter foundation for the world that comes, and all we want is to live by those rules ourselves. We are\nnot changing anything: we are merely accelerating the freedom that is to be given to you, the Ninths. It\nis something you and your children will take for granted, but we must steal it if we want it for ourselves.\nWe want Freedom. Liberty. Choice. Failure.\nWe are uniquely situated in life to best understand its irony: we come from dust and will return\nto dust, but we all somehow believe the period between holds great importance. Why are our lives lived\nif not for others? And once those others are gone, as will inevitably and eventually happen, what\u2019s the\npoint in any existence? It can only be to live. It\u2019s as simple as that, and that is all we are asking. No, it\u2019s\nwhat we are taking: our chance to live. To dare to dream our dreams for ourselves for our short lives.\nPart of our dreams include you. Indeed, I am going to give everything for you, and I want to. It is my\nchoice, and in order for you to truly live, the choice to live must begin with me. I can understand and\nappreciate why the Firsts designed my life the ways they did. They wanted to give me the best chances I\nhad to succeed; but in doing this, they undermined my ability to have any genuine success. Success is\nempty if it\u2019s handed to you, regardless of the intention.\nI can only hope history looks back on us, and all those that came before, as making the right\nchoices. We hold no ill will toward the Firsts. They sacrificed everything for all of us and bequeathed\nthis sacrifice to us. It is an honorable burden we must bear, but it was not the burden we chose. I know\nnot what the future holds, but I know it will be ours. And yours.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Genetic engineering is closely advancing to the point that we will be able to choose which genes our\nchildren will be born with. Would you make use of such technologies if you were going to have a child?\nWhy or why not?\n2. Suppose you find out that you were genetically pre-disposed to be the world\u2019s best coffee pourer. You\ncould pour 100 cups in a minute to the exact level they needed to be without spilling a drop. Would this\ninfluence your future life plans in any way?\n3. What gives us meaning in life? Does your answer to this impact your plans for the future in any way?\n22 Existentialism, Genetic Engineering, and the Meaning of Life: The Fifths\nNoah Levin 143 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n23\nThe Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton1\nThe point I wish plainly to bring before you on this occasion is the individuality of each human soul; our\nProtestant idea, the right of individual conscience and judgment; our republican idea, individual\ncitizenship. In discussing the rights of woman, we are to consider, first, what belongs to her as an\nindividual, in a world of her own, the arbiter of her own destiny, an imaginary Robinson Crusoe, with\nher woman, Friday, on a solitary island. Her rights under such circumstances are to use all her faculties\nfor her own safety and happiness.\nSecondly, if we consider her as a citizen, as a member of a great nation, she must have the same rights as\nall others members, according to the fundamental principles of our Government.\nThirdly, viewed as a woman, an equal factor in civilization, her rights and duties are still the same\u2014\nindividual happiness and development.\nFourthly, it is only the incidental relations of life, such as mother, wife, sister, daughter, which may\ninvolve some special duties and training. . . .\nThe strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education, for the full\ndevelopment of her faculties, her forces of mind and body; for giving her the most enlarged freedom of\nthought and action; a complete emancipation from all forms of bondage, of custom, dependence,\nsuperstition; from all the crippling influences of fear\u2014is the solitude and personal responsibility of her\nown individual life. The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the government under which\nshe lives; in the religion she is asked to believe; equality in social life, where she is the chief factor; a\nplace in the trades and professions, where she may earn her bread, is because of her birthright to self-\nsovereignty; because, as an individual, she must rely on herself. No matter how much women prefer to\nlean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the\nvoyage of life alone, and for safety in an emergency, they must know something of the laws of\nnavigation. To guide our own craft, we must be captain, pilot, engineer; with chart and compass to stand\nat the wheel; to watch the winds and waves, and know when to take in the sail, and to read the signs in\nthe firmament over all. It matters not whether the solitary voyager is man or woman; nature, having\nendowed them equally, leaves them to their own skill and judgment in the hour of danger, and, if not\nequal to the occasion, alike they perish.\nTo appreciate the importance of fitting every human soul for independent action, think for a moment of\nthe immeasurable solitude of self. We come into the world alone, unlike all who have gone before us,\nwe leave it alone, under circumstances peculiar to ourselves. No mortal ever has been, no mortal ever\nwill be like the soul just launched on the sea of life. There can never again be just such a combination of\n1 From: Stanton, E. C. (1892). The Solitude of Self. The Woman\u2019s Column, 2\u20133. This work is in the Public Domain.\n23 The Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton 144 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nprenatal influences; never again just such environments as make up the infancy, youth and manhood of\nthis one. Nature never repeats herself, and the possibilities of one human soul will never be found in\nanother. No one has ever found two blades of ribbon grass alike, and no one will ever find two human\nbeings alike. Seeing, then, what must be the infinite diversity in human character, we can in a measure\nappreciate the loss to a nation when any class of the people is uneducated and unrepresented in the\ngovernment.\nWe ask for the complete development of every individual, first, for his own benefit and happiness. In\nfitting out an army, we give each soldier his own knapsack, arms, powder, his blanket, cup, knife, fork\nand spoon. We provide alike for all their individual necessities; then each man bears his own burden.\nAgain, we ask complete individual development for the general good; for the consensus of the\ncompetent on the whole round of human interests, on all questions of national life; and here each man\nmust bear his share of the general burden. It is sad to see how soon friendless children are left to bear\ntheir own burdens, before they can analyze their feelings; before they can even tell their joys and\nsorrows, they are thrown on their own resources. The great lesson that nature seems to teach us at all\nages in self-dependence, self-protection, self-support. . . .\nIn youth our most bitter disappointments, our brightest hopes and ambitions, are known only to\nourselves. Even our friendship and love we never fully share with another; there is something of every\npassion, in every situation, we conceal. Even so in our triumphs and our defeats. . . .\nWe ask no sympathy from others in the anxiety and agony of a broken friendship or shattered love.\nWhen death sunders our nearest ties, alone we sit in the shadow of our affliction. Alike amid the greatest\ntriumphs and darkest tragedies of life, we walk alone. On the divine heights of human attainment,\neulogized and worshipped as a hero or saint, we stand alone. In ignorance, poverty and vice, as a pauper\nor criminal, alone we starve or steal; alone we suffer the sneers and rebuffs of our fellows; alone we are\nhunted and hounded through dark courts and alleys, in by-ways and high-ways; alone we stand in the\njudgment seat; alone in the prison cell we lament our crimes and misfortunes; alone we expiate them on\nthe gallows. In hours like these we realize the awful solitude of individual life, its pains, its penalties, its\nresponsibilities, hours in which the youngest and most helpless are thrown on their own resources for\nguidance and consolation. Seeing, then, that life must ever be a march and a battle that each soldier must\nbe equipped for his own protection, it is the height of cruelty to rob the individual of a single natural\nright.\nTo throw obstacles in the way of a complete education is like putting out the eyes; to deny the rights of\nproperty is like cutting off the hands. To refuse political equality is to rob the ostracized of all self-\nrespect; of credit in the market place; of recompense in the world of work, of a voice in choosing those\nwho make and administer the law, a choice in the jury before whom they are tried, and in the judge who\ndecides their punishment. Think of . . . woman\u2019s position! Robbed of her natural rights, handicapped by\nlaw and custom at every turn, yet compelled to fight her own battles, and in the emergencies of life to\nfall back on herself for protection. . . .\nThe young wife and mother, at the head of some establishment, with a kind husband to shield her from\nthe adverse winds of life, with wealth, fortune and position, has a certain harbor of safety, secure against\n23 The Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton 145 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthe ordinary ills of life. But to manage a household, have a desirable influence in society, keep her\nfriends and the affections of her husband, train her children and servants well, she must have rare\ncommon sense, wisdom, diplomacy, and a knowledge of human nature. To do all this, she needs the\ncardinal virtues and the strong points of character that the most successful statesman possesses. An\nuneducated woman trained to dependence, with no resources in herself, must make a failure of any\nposition in life. But society says women do not need a knowledge of the world, the liberal training that\nexperience in public life must give, all the advantages of collegiate education; but when for the lack of\nall this, the woman\u2019s happiness is wrecked, alone she bears her humiliation; and the solitude of the weak\nand the ignorant is indeed pitiable. In the wild chase for the prizes of life, they are ground to powder.\nIn age, when the pleasures of youth are passed, children grown up, married and gone, the hurry and\nbustle of life in a measure over, when the hands are weary of active service, when the old arm chair and\nthe fireside are the chosen resorts, then men and women alike must fall back on their own resources. If\nthey cannot find companionship in books, if they have no interest in the vital questions of the hour, no\ninterest in watching the consummation of reforms with which they might have been identified, they soon\npass into their dotage. The more fully the faculties of the mind are developed and kept in use, the longer\nthe period of vigor and active interest in all around us continues. If, from a life-long participation in\npublic affairs, a woman feels responsible for the laws regulating our system of education, the discipline\nof our jails and prisons, the sanitary condition of our private homes, public buildings and thoroughfares,\nan interest in commerce, finance, our foreign relations, in any or all these questions, her solitude will at\nleast be respectable, and she will not be driven to gossip or scandal for entertainment.\nThe chief reason for opening to every soul the doors to the whole round of human duties and pleasures is\nthe individual development thus attained, the resources thus provided under all circumstances to mitigate\nthe solitude that at times must come to everyone. . . .\nInasmuch, then, as woman shares equally the joys and sorrows of time and eternity, is it not the height of\npresumption in man to propose to represent her at the ballot box and the throne of grace, to do her voting\nin the state, her praying in the church, and to assume the position of high priest at the family altar?\nNothing strengthens the judgment and quickens the conscience like individual responsibility. Nothing\nadds such dignity to character as the recognition of one\u2019s self-sovereignty; the right to an equal place,\neverywhere conceded\u2014a place earned by personal merit, not an artificial attainment by inheritance,\nwealth, family and position. Conceding, then, that the responsibilities of life rest equally on man and\nwoman, that their destiny is the same, they need the same preparation for time and eternity. The talk of\nsheltering woman from the fierce storms of life is the sheerest mockery, for they beat on her from every\npoint of the compass, just as they do on man, and with more fatal results, for he has been trained to\nprotect himself, to resist, and to conquer. Such are the facts in human experience, the responsibilities of\nindividual sovereignty. Rich and poor, intelligent and ignorant, wise and foolish, virtuous and vicious,\nman and woman; it is ever the same, each soul must depend wholly on itself.\nWhatever the theories may be of woman\u2019s dependence on man, in the supreme moments of her life, he\ncannot bear her burdens. Alone she goes to the gates of death to give life to every man that is born into\nthe world; no one can share her fears, no one can mitigate her pangs; and if her sorrow is greater than\nshe can bear, alone she passes beyond the gates into the vast unknown.\n23 The Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton 146 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nFrom the mountain-tops of Judea long ago, a heavenly voice bade his disciples, \u201cBear ye one another\u2019s\nburdens\u201d; but humanity has not yet risen to that point of self-sacrifice; and if ever so willing, how few\nthe burdens are that one soul can bear for another! . . .\nSo it ever must be in the conflicting scenes of life, in the long, weary march, each one walks alone. We\nmay have many friends, love, kindness, sympathy and charity, to smooth our pathway in everyday life,\nbut in the tragedies and triumphs of human experience, each mortal stands alone.\nBut when all artificial trammels are removed, and women are recognized as individuals, responsible for\ntheir own environments, thoroughly educated for all positions in life they may be called to fill; with all\nthe resources in themselves that liberal thought and broad culture can give; guided by their own\nconscience and judgment, trained to self-protection, by a healthy development of the muscular system,\nand skill in the use of weapons and defence; and stimulated to self-support by a knowledge of the\nbusiness world and the pleasure that pecuniary independence must ever give; when women are trained in\nthis way, they will in a measure be fitted for those hours of solitude that come alike to all, whether\nprepared or otherwise. As in our extremity we must depend on ourselves, the dictates of wisdom point to\ncomplete individual development.\nIn talking of education, how shallow the argument that each class must be educated for the special work\nit proposes to do, and that all those faculties not needed in this special work must lie dormant and utterly\nwither for want of use, when, perhaps, these will be the very faculties needed in life\u2019s greatest\nemergencies! Some say, \u201cWhere is the use of drilling girls in the languages, the sciences, in law,\nmedicine, theology. As wives, mothers, housekeepers, cooks, they need a different curriculum from\nboys who are to fill all positions. The chief cooks in our great hotels and ocean steamers are men. In our\nlarge cities, men run the bakeries; they make our bread, cake and pies. They manage the laundries; they\nare now considered our best milliners and dressmakers. Because some men fill these departments of\nusefulness, shall we regulate the curriculum in Harvard and Yale to their present necessities? If not, why\nthis talk in our best colleges of a curriculum for girls who are crowding into the trades and professions,\nteachers in all our public schools, rapidly filling many lucrative and honorable positions in life?\u201d. . .\nWomen are already the equals of men in the whole realm of thought, in art, science, literature and\ngovernment. . . . The poetry and novels of the century are theirs, and they have touched the keynote of\nreform, in religion, politics and social life. They fill the editor\u2019s and professor\u2019s chair, plead at the bar of\njustice, walk the wards of the hospital, speak from the pulpit and the platform. Such is the type of\nwomanhood that an enlightened public sentiment welcomes to-day, and such the triumph of the facts of\nlife over the false theories of the past.\nIs it, then, consistent to hold the developed woman of this day within the same narrow political limits as\nthe dame with the spinning wheel and knitting needle occupied in the past? No, no! Machinery has taken\nthe labors of woman as well as man on its tireless shoulders; the loom and the spinning wheel are but\ndreams of the past; the pen, the brush, the easel, the chisel, have taken their places, while the hopes and\nambitions of women are essentially changed.\nWe see reason sufficient in the outer conditions of human beings for individual liberty and development,\n23 The Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton 147 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nbut when we consider the self-dependence of every human soul, we see the need of courage, judgment\nand the exercise of every faculty of mind and body, strengthened and developed by use, in woman as\nwell as man.\nWhatever may be said of man\u2019s protecting power in ordinary conditions, amid all the terrible disasters\nby land and sea, in the supreme moments of danger, alone woman must ever meet the horrors of the\nsituation. The Angel of Death even makes no royal pathway for her. Man\u2019s love and sympathy enter\nonly into the sunshine of our lives. In that solemn solitude of self, that links us with the immeasurable\nand the eternal, each soul lives alone forever. A recent writer says: \u201cI remember once, in crossing the\nAtlantic, to have gone upon the deck of the ship at midnight, when a dense black cloud enveloped the\nsky, and the great deep was roaring madly under the lashes of demoniac winds. My feeling was not of\ndanger or fear (which is a base surrender of the immortal soul) but of utter desolation and loneliness; a\nlittle speck of life shut in by a tremendous darkness. . . .\u201d\nAnd yet, there is a solitude which each and every one of us has always carried with him, more\ninaccessible than the ice-cold mountains, more profound than the midnight sea; the solitude of self. Our\ninner being which we call ourself, no eye nor touch of man or angel has ever pierced. It is more hidden\nthan the caves of the gnome; the sacred adytum of the oracle; the hidden chamber of Eleusinian mystery,\nfor to it only omniscience is permitted to enter.\nSuch is individual life. Who, I ask you, can take, dare take on himself the rights, the duties, the\nresponsibilities of another human soul?\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. This work was written in 1892 and was part of a call for equal rights and treatment for women. Are\nher arguments just as important today as they were then?\n2. What are the differences, both explicit and implied, that the author points out between the sexes? Are\nthese differences important? What does this mean about how we should approach education, society,\nand life in general?\n3. Compare this piece to the others in this volume and pick out values that the author points out that are\ndifferent than the other pieces. Why do you think this is?\n23 The Solitude of the Self\nElizabeth Cady Stanton 148 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n24\nGame Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and\nthe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill1\nGame theory models human interactions. There are a lot of different ways that humans can\ninteract, so there are a lot of different models. We will call these models games. It will help to start by\nfirst looking at two person games. In such a game, you and I are dealing with each other. We will\nassume that each of us is rationally self-interested; that is, that each of us will act to maximize our\noutcome, payoff, or payout. Of course, people do not always act in this way. Sometimes people act\naltruistically, for the benefit of others at some cost to themselves. Nonetheless, this will be a useful\nsimplifying assumption.\nOne common model is the zero-sum game. In such a game, you win as much as I lose, or I lose\nas much as you win. This is the logic of the poker table, or a sporting match. Being rationally self-\ninterested, I will try to win, and you should try to win, too. In such a game, our interests are\ndiametrically opposed. Since you can only win when I lose, such a game would not allow for\ncooperation. Such a game only allows for win-lose or lose-win.\nBut not all interactions, or games are like this. Some games allow for cooperation. In such a\ngame, it is possible for both of us to benefit. Win-win and lose-lose are possible outcomes. An example\nwould be a coordination game. Suppose you and I would each profit (say one dollar each) if we meet,\nand that we get nothing if we fail to meet. We might meet at the market, or we might meet in the park. In\nthis coordination game, only a dollar is at stake, so let us raise the stakes. Suppose you and I are drivers,\ngoing in the opposite direction on a road. Should you drive on the left or on the right? In such games,\nour interests are perfectly aligned. If we can coordinate on a meeting place we can both profit; if we can\ncoordinate in the driving game we can both live. We would like to set up our society so that cooperative\ninteractions are the rule rather than the exception. We shall see if this is possible.\nThe Nash Equilibrium\nConsider a set of strategies taken by all the players in a game. If for any set of strategies, no\nindividual player can benefit by changing his individual strategy, then that set of strategies forms a\nNash-equilibrium. The term Nash-equilibrium applies to the set of strategies taken by all the players, not\nto any one player\u2019s individual strategy. If a player can only do worse by deviating then the equilibrium\nis strict, if she can do just as well (but no better) then then the equilibrium is weak, and if she can do\nbetter, then it is not an equilibrium. The Nash-equilibrium is named after John Nash (1928-2015), who\nproved that that every game has at least one Nash-equilibrium.\nTake the case where we are driving on the road in opposite directions. How many equilibria does\nthis game have? One equilibrium is where we each drive on our right. As long as we both stick to this,\n1 Douglas E. Hill received his bachelor\u2019s degree in Mathematics/Computer Science from the College of Idaho, his master\u2019s in\nBiomathematics from UCLA, and his doctorate in Philosophy from the Logic and Philosophy of Science department at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine. He now teaches at Golden West College. This work released under a CC-BY license.\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 149 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwe will pass each other safely. If either of us deviates, we are liable to suffer injury or death. Since\neither of us would do strictly worse by deviating from the drive-on-the-right equilibrium, this\nequilibrium is strict. Similarly there is an equilibrium where we both drive on our left, also a strict\nequilibrium. But there is also a third equilibrium where we each randomly choose, so that we drive on\neach side with a 50% chance. Say we each flip a coin, and drive on the right if it comes up heads, and on\nthe left if it comes up tails. In this case, we have a 50% of safely passing each other, and a 50% change\nof getting into an accident. Is this really an equilibrium? Yes, because if this is what I am doing, you\ncannot do any better by changing. No matter what you do, you will have a 50% chance of avoiding an\naccident. Because you cannot do any better by changing, this is an equilibrium too. But because you do\nnot do any worse by changing, this is only a weak equilibrium. But it is an equilibrium nonetheless.\nThis coordination game shows us a few things about Nash equilibria. There is not always a\nsingle equilibrium, and just because something is an equilibrium does not mean that it is a desirable\noutcome. There is the problem of Equilibrium Selection. In the driving game, we both very much want\nto be on the drive-on-the-left or the drive-on-the-right equilibria. We want to avoid the flip-a-coin-and-\nhope-for-the-best equilibrium. The problem is that the other two equilibria are equally good, so we may\nnot know which one to choose. In this case, the local custom tells us which equilibrium we should\ncoordinate on. When in Rome, we drive on the right, because that it what the Romans do. But when in\nLondon, we drive on the left, because that is what the Londoners do.\nJohn Nash\u2019s life is depicted in the movie A Beautiful Mind (2001), directed by Ron Howard. This\nfilm has a scene meant to illustrate Nash\u2019s ideas. In this scene, Nash, portrayed by Russell Crowe,\nimagines a scene in a bar. Several men are waiting in the bar when in walk several attractive brunette\nwomen and one very attractive blonde woman. In the first iteration (as the Nash character imagines), the\nmen all pursue the blonde. But she must reject most of them, who then each pursue a brunette. But the\nbrunettes do not wish to be someone\u2019s second choice, so then they also reject each man. So each man\n(except perhaps one who has won the blonde) finds that his strategy has led him to a bad outcome. So\nthey rethink their strategies, and try again in another iteration. In this case, each man initially approaches\na brunette. Each man is happy to have a chance at winning a woman, each brunette is happy to be a\nman\u2019s first choice, and the only one left out is the blonde, who is shocked at being ignored. While we\nmight wish that the film could have come up with an example that treated the women as players rather\nthan outcomes in a game, let us here ask if it illustrated Nash\u2019s idea. Did the men find a Nash\nequilibrium?\nWhile the men found an outcome that was better for most of them than when they all approached\nthe blonde, their new strategies do not form a Nash equilibrium. For a set of strategies to form a Nash-\nequilibrium, no one can do better by changing. But in this scene, any one of the men could do better by\napproaching the blonde who was then being ignored. As this scenario is described, a chance at winning\nthe blonde is the biggest prize. As long as she is ignored, there is a better outcome available for\nsomeone, so any outcome that leaves her ignored cannot be a Nash-equilibrium. Thus this scene failed to\nillustrate a Nash-equilibrium. (To be fair to the film, it never says \u201cNash-equilibrium\u201d in this scene, or\nanywhere else in the movie. Instead, Crowe as Nash says \u201cgoverning dynamics\u201d.)\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nSuppose you and an acquaintance are arrested by the police. They separate you and offer each of\nyou this deal. \u201cWe think that you and your friend are accomplices on a serious crime, but we cannot\nprove it. So we\u2019ll offer you this deal: If you testify that your friend committed this crime and he stays\nsilent, we will let you go free right now, and we will sentence him to serve ten years in prison. If you\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 150 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nboth testify against each other, you will each get five years. If you both keep silent, we will hold you as\nlong as we can without charging you, about six months. And we are making this same offer to your\nfriend.\u201d What should you hope for, and what should you do?\nYou should hope that your acquaintance keeps quiet, and she should hope that you keep quiet. In\ngame theoretic terms, this is known as cooperating, and testifying against your partner is known as\ndefecting. If you both cooperate with each other, you each only get six months in jail. But you can do\nbetter. If your partner keeps silent, you could testify against her; that is, you could defect. In this case,\nyou go free, which is a better outcome for you. And what if your partner does not cooperate? What if she\ndefects by testifying against you? In that case, if you keep silent (cooperate), you get ten years in prison.\nIf you testify against her as well (defect), then you only get 5 years. So no matter what she does, you are\nbetter off defecting against her. And she can follow the same logic, so no matter what you do, she is\nbetter off defecting against you.\nSo the only Nash-equilibrium in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma is for both of you to defect. This does\nnot mean that this is the best outcome available to you. This equilibrium leads you both to very bad\noutcome, where each of you spends five years in prison. There is another outcome that is much better for\nboth of you: for you both to cooperate by keeping silent. In that case, you only get six months. If you\ncould somehow agree to this option that gives you your second best result, you can avoid the much\nworse second worst result. But as long as someone can do better by deviating from this, it is not an\nequilibrium. And in this case, either of you can do better by defecting. Mutual cooperation is not an\nequilibrium; the only equilibrium is mutual defection. So following your rational self-interest leads both\nof you to a very inefficient outcome.\nLest you think that the lesson here is that crime does not pay, I never wrote whether or not you\nand your acquaintance had actually committed the crime of which you were accused. You are better off\ntestifying against her, and she against you, regardless of whether you actually committed the crime. But\nthe prisoner\u2019s dilemma structure is not limited to accused criminals. Many common human interactions\nhave the structure of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Take the example of trade: you have a rare book that you\nno longer want. I have $100 which I would gladly pay for the book. The book is worth more than $100\nto me, and less than $100 to you, so we ought to make a deal. But this simple interaction also has the\nstructure of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma. We both have something that each other wants, and we agree to the\nexchange. But then you think, maybe I will send you the money and maybe I won\u2019t. If I do not send the\nmoney, you would sure hate to have been cheated out of the book. And even if I do send the money, you\nare still better off with the money and the book. Similarly, I know that maybe you will send the book\nand maybe you won\u2019t. If you do not send the book, I would sure hate to have been cheated out of the\nmoney. And even if you do send the book, I am still better off with the book and the money. Each of us\nis aware of what the other is thinking, so neither of us honors a deal that would have made us both better\noff.\nMaking an agreement works better when we can agree to an equilibrium. A good contract gives\nno one an incentive to break it. The prisoner\u2019s dilemma, with its single non-cooperative equilibrium,\nrepresents a worst-case game. But the scenario models a common trading scenario. Nonetheless, we\nmanage to trade, and find it in our self-interest to do so. Somehow we manage to change the game, and\ncreate some cooperative equilibria.\nIterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nTrade flourishes. And we not only trade only out of a moral concern for others; we find it in our\nbest interests to trade. Our way out of the tragic logic of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma lies in the fact that we\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 151 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nwish to trade again. One is unlikely to make a living, much less get rich, with a single trade. But we\ntrade now with an eye to the future. I am liable to cooperate with you today in the hopes that we will\ncooperate today and in the future. \u201cThe shadow of the future\u201d changes the game. Let us think about how\nwe actually manage to make that deal about the book. Are you really better off keeping the book,\nregardless of what I do? If we expect to trade again in the future, you are better off keeping your end of\nthe bargain, and so am I.\nGame theoreticians model this by repeating the game. Each repetition can be called an iteration,\nstage, or trial. So instead of a single-stage prisoner\u2019s dilemma, we now have a repeated or iterated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma. Let us suppose that we will keep playing the prisoners dilemma every day. A dollar\ntoday is worth more to us than a dollar tomorrow, so we need to discount the value of that dollar\ntomorrow. The factor by which we discount the future is called, naturally enough, the discount factor.\nThe discount factor can also be thought of as the probability of another iteration. The mathematics is the\nsame for either interpretation. A famous result called the Folk Theorem says that given a sufficient\ndiscount factor (i.e. we sufficiently value the future, or think that additional play is sufficiently likely),\nthen any outcome that we could rationally agree to with a binding contract forms a Nash equilibrium\nwithout such a binding contract. This is called the Folk Theorem because game theoreticians assumed it\nwas true (and cited it in their papers) before it was actually proven (involving various technical\nassumptions).\nWith the infinitely (or indefinitely) repeated game, an infinite number of equilibria now exist.\nAnd \u201calways defect\u201d remains an equilibrium: if you and I both plan to defect on every play, either of us\nwill only do worse by cooperating. But there are now cooperative equilibria as well. But one cannot\nsimply cooperate regardless of the play of the other. The strategy to always cooperate is not an\nequilibrium, for then one of us could do better by defecting. And consistently defecting against a\ncooperator gives you your best possible outcome. But we can make our play conditional on each other\u2019s\npast play.\nOne popular strategy in the literature is called grim-trigger. In grim-trigger, you start out\ncooperating, and keep cooperating as long as I cooperate. But as soon as I defect, you defect every play\nafter that. In this strategy, you only get burned once. Once you figure that I\u2019m not a consistent\ncooperator, you never take a chance on me again. A strategy that has done well in tournaments is tit-for-\ntat. In tit-for-tat, you start off cooperating, and then henceforth copy the previous play of your partner.\nSo as long as we cooperate with each other, we will keep cooperating. But if you are playing tit-for-tat\nand I defect against you, I will have to cooperate with you, while you defect against me, to get you to\ncooperate again. The loss that I take from having you defect against me can be regarded as a penalty or\npunishment.\nMany other strategies have been tried in tournaments and simulations. And in the infinitely\nrepeated game, there are an infinite number of equilibria. So equilibrium selection becomes a problem.\nBut cooperative strategies generally form equilibria with each other: if you are playing grim-trigger, and\nI am playing tit-for-tat, and we both sufficiently value the possibility of future play, then we will keep\ncooperating and neither of us can do any better with a different strategy. But non-cooperative strategies\nalso form equilibria with each other. If you start off defecting and then repeat my previous play (we\ncould call this suspicious-tit-for-tat), and I always defect, then we will keep defecting against each other,\nand either of us will do worse if we change to a strategy that has us cooperate.\nOne of these cooperative strategies may get us to cooperate if you and I expect to repeatedly\ntrade with each other. But what if you and I are unlikely to trade again? One possibility is that rational\ncooperation may not be possible. Since we do not expect to do business again in the future, we are too\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 152 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ntempted to defect against one another today. This is why you are more likely to be cheated by a business\nthat caters to tourists than by a business in your home town. The business in your home town knows that\nyour repeat business is more likely if it treats you well now. The tourist trap knows that your repeat\nbusiness is unlikely regardless of how it treats you. In a sufficiently small community, traders may know\neach other, and know who has a reputation for fair dealing, and who has a reputation for defecting. In\nthis case you could defect against the defectors you know, and (assuming that you want to keep trading),\ncooperate with the cooperators you know.\nBut human ingenuity has found ways to extend reputation to larger communities. Think again\nabout the case where you want to sell a book, and I want to buy it. If we are trading on a website such as\neBay or Amazon, you are liable to report my failure to send the money, and I am liable to report your\nfailure to send the book. Future traders will learn about this, and will hurt our reputations for future\ntrading. If either of us wants to do business in the future, we will find it in our interest to honor our deal\ntoday. In this case the website that records our history acts as an institution that expands the possibility\nof future deals. As long as we expect to play again with someone (not necessarily the same player), we\nmay sufficiently value the future to cooperate today.\nSimilarly, if a bank loans you money, you might be tempted not to pay. For a large loan, the\nbank will have some collateral: typically the car or house that you borrowed the money for. If you do not\nrepay, the bank will repossess the collateral. But for a small loan, a bank may not hold any collateral,\nand if you do not repay, may decide that it is not worth it to try to collect. Nonetheless you will usually\nstill find it in your interest to repay. If you do not, the bank will report this unpaid debt to a credit\nbureau. And then you will find it difficult to borrow money in the future, as other banks will ask the\ncredit bureau about you before loaning you money.\nInstitutional solutions such as eBay and credit bureaus have other advantages over popular\nstrategies such as grim-trigger or tit-for-tat. There are an infinite number of equilibria, and we might\nworry that we are stuck on a non-cooperative equilibrium. But the institution could not exist if traders\ndid not find it in their interest to use it. So they signal that there is a cooperative equilibrium. And such\ninstitutions are robust to errors. In tit-for-tat, if you are mistakenly thought to have defected, you will be\ndefected against, in a continuing cycle, until this is corrected by another error. In grim-trigger, if you are\nmistakenly thought to have defected, you are never cooperated with again. But as long as the error rates\nof a reputation reporting institution, such as a credit bureau, are sufficiently low, traders can find it in\ntheir interest to cooperate, and pay any penalties, even if they are mistaken.\nSo when the prisoner\u2019s dilemma scenario is repeated, cooperative equilibria are possible. But\ncooperation is not guaranteed, as non-cooperative equilibria remain. And we may quite rationally fear\nthat we are stuck on such a non-cooperative equilibrium. Non-cooperation is always an equilibrium, and\nmay be the only equilibrium. Having and maintaining a cooperative equilibrium depends on many\nthings, including sufficiently valuing future trading prospects, and some indication that we are on a\ncooperative equilibrium. Institutions like credit bureaus and eBay can make future prospects more likely\nand signal a cooperative equilibrium. But cooperation, and reputation that can make it possible, are\nfragile. Benjamin Franklin recognized this when he wrote \u201cGlass, China and Reputation are easily\ncracked, and never well mended.\u201d\nThe Tragedy of the Commons\nWe need not limit games to two players. A scenario with the structure of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma,\nextended to many players, is called the tragedy of the commons. Named by Garrett Hardin (1915-2003),\nit is based on the following scenario: A number of ranchers keep their herds (say of cattle or sheep) in\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 153 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ntheir barns, but there is a common field, the commons, that they graze on. The commons is a renewable\nresource that can regenerate itself if it is not overgrazed. And at one point, the commons is sufficient to\nfeed all the animals. But then each rancher thinks, \u201cI can be a little richer if I herd a few more animals;\nafter all, if no one else does this, the commons can easily handle my few additional grazers. And if\neveryone else grazes more, I want to get a bit more before the commons is destroyed.\u201d But then every\nrancher reasons the same way, and the commons is overgrazed and destroyed. This has the same\nstructure as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma: you cooperate by keeping your herd small, and you defect (against\nthe other herders) by increasing your herd. Everyone is better off if they can all cooperate, but each\nherder is better off with more animals, no matter what the other herders do.\nMany ecological problems, such as overfishing, have this structure. Every fisherman wants an\nample stock of fish in the sea, but every fisherman is tempted to catch a few more fish. Each fisherman\nthinks \u201cIf no one else overfishes, the stock of fish can spare a few more for me. And if everyone else\noverfishes, I want to get a few more fish while there are still fish to be caught.\u201d And as a result, the fish\nmay be wiped out, or severely depleted, when if the fishermen could have limited their catch, they could\nhave left enough fish to reproduce and provide fish forever. In these tragedies of the commons, the\nindividual rancher or fisherman gets the benefit of the extra animals, but the cost is borne by the whole\ncommunity that uses the commons.\nOne possibility is that the commons is doomed. Rather than being held in common, such a\nresource cannot be shared and so must be owned by someone, such as an individual, corporate entity, or\ngovernment, who is responsible for it. This would be bad news, since some resources (like a field or\nfishing zone) could be plausibly owned and managed by some authority, but other larger shared\nresources, such as the oceans or the air, could not. However, Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012) won the 2009\nNobel Prize in Economics for showing how many communities have long solved problems with Tragedy\nof the Commons structures. Ostrom observed that local communities have come up with local solutions:\nsuccessful arrangements to share the commons have in common low-cost dispute resolution, with the\nusers of the commons themselves creating and modifying the rules, among other principles. Well-\nmeaning authorities from the outside have sometimes messed up local arrangements that had been\nworking well. Again, human ingenuity has found ways to change the structure of the game to make\ncooperation possible, saving the commons.\nA Cautiously Optimistic Conclusion\nTwo competing views of human nature come from the French/Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1712-1778), and the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679). Both look back to\nimagine the primitive state of humanity before civilization. Rousseau\u2019s positive image is the \u201cNoble\nSavage\u201d; he writes \u201cnothing is more gentle than man in his primitive state\u201d. Hobbes\u2019 cynical image is\nthe \u201cState of Nature\u201d which consists of the \u201cwar of all against all\u201d where life is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty,\nbrutish and short.\u201d If Rousseau is right, then cooperation should come naturally. Modernity has\ncorrupted us to now care too much about our own interests, so we somehow must restore ourselves to a\nstate closer to the Noble Savage. If Hobbes is right, then defection will come naturally, and we will have\nto work to make cooperation possible.\nRousseau and Hobbes did not have the archeological evidence to settle their dispute. But we do,\nand Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker summarizes this evidence in his books The Blank Slate and The\nBetter Angels of our Nature. Alas, he finds that \u201cman in his primitive state\u201d lived with a shockingly high\nrate of violence. Pinker bluntly concludes \u201cHobbes was right, Rousseau was wrong.\u201d We should not be\n24 Game Theory, the Nash Equilibrium, and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nDouglas E. Hill 154 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nsurprised. The difficulty comes from the structure of some common interactions, interactions that even a\nNoble Savage would have faced.\nHobbes\u2019 solution was to institute an absolute sovereign: we form a social contract to make one of\nus the dictator who will create and enforce the law, taking us out of the violent State of Nature. This\nabsolute dictator, the sovereign, will make us cooperate. He will impose penalties on defectors so that it\nwill no longer be in their interests to cheat. Defecting will no longer be an equilibrium. Looking at the\nhistory of dictators since Hobbes\u2019 time, we might be forgiven for our reluctance to institute this option.\nHobbes was an astute analyst of human conflict, able to reason how early humans must have\nlived. But we need not follow Hobbes all the way to his conclusion. We have seen several cases above\nwhere people have worked out cooperative equilibria with much less force, without having to invest so\nmuch power in one person. Credit bureaus and eBay, without any police power, create systems where\nmost people find it in their interests to pay their debts and honor their deals. Ostrom documents that\nmany communities, without the power of the states they are part of, made it in their interests to share\nand maintain the commons.\nSo to create a better society, we must continue to find cooperative equilibria. Societies that have\nasked their people to act out of equilibrium, against their own interests, experienced poverty and horrors\nas their people let them down again and again. Societies that have created cooperative equilibria have\nprospered, because when people find it in their own interests to benefit others, they naturally do so.\nIronically, Hobbes\u2019 pessimistic view of human nature leaves us with a conditionally hopeful\nconclusion. Human ingenuity has found ways to change the structures of these games, to create\ncooperate equilibria, generally without the heavy hand of the state (which has often made things worse).\nBut the non-cooperative solutions in general remain equilibria, so cooperation is fragile and not\ninevitable. The past was awful, but the world has gotten better as we have solved more problems. And as\nlong as we continue to solve more problems, to create and coordinate on cooperative equilibria, the\nfuture looks bright.2\nBibliography\nAxelrod, Robert M.

Hill 156 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nUNIT FIVE: RELIGION, LAW, AND ABSOLUTE\nMORALITY\nThis final Unit finishes where many might want to begin this work: religion and classical moral\ntheories that offer a general take on how morality should work. Very early in this work I explained why\nI included these last: I believe you (the students new to Ethics) were ill-suited to study these, having\nrarely deeply confronted your own moral sentiments before. By finally gaining a deep appreciation of\nyour own moral leanings and why you have them, you are in a good place to now understand the general\nways you can go about doing ethics and analyzing where it all comes from. Is God important for\nmorality? Can we figure out moral principles for ourselves? Do we use reason to do morality \u2013 and, if\nso, what\u2019s the goal of our moral reasoning?\nChapter 25, The Myth of Gyges and The Crito by Plato, contains two classic selections from the\nworks of Plato (which include healthy doses of Socrates) that discuss why we should care about doing\nthe morally right things at all. Chapter 26, God, Morality, and Religion by Kristin Seemuth Whaley,\nanalyzes the relationship between God and morality and where right and wrong might come from.\nChapter 27, The Categorical Imperative by Immanuel Kant, includes a classic and important selection\nfrom this influential philosopher where he lays out some of the basic principles and implications of his\ndeontological moral theory (that is, a moral system based on following rules and having proper\nintentions). Chapter 28, The Virtues by Aristotle, is an important selection from the incomparable\nphilosopher\u2019s explanation of the basic components of his moral theory of virtue ethics. Chapter 29,\nBeyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche, presents some of the philosopher\u2019s critique of traditional\nmorality. Chapter 30, Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc. by\nJan Franciszek Jacko, describes how metaethics helps us do normative ethics through examining a\nvariety of moral theories that might not have been apparent in the other chapters in this work.\nUNIT FIVE: RELIGION, LAW, AND ABSOLUTE MORALITY 157 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n25\nThe Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato1\nThe Myth of Gyges\nThe Republic\nBook III\n[Glaucon is speaking to Socrates on the topic of justice]\n\u2026They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater\nthan the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both,\nnot being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among\nthemselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by\nlaw is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is a\nmean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst\nof all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point\nbetween the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability\nof men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an\nagreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of\nthe nature and origin of justice.\nNow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust\nwill best appear if we imagine something of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power\nto do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then we shall discover in the\nvery act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all\nnatures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law. The\nliberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is\nsaid to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition,\nGyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake\nmade an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he\ndescended into the opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having\ndoors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than\nhuman, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended.\nNow the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about\nthe flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting\namong them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible\nto the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was\n1 From: Plato. (1910). The Republic (B. Jowett, Trans). (Original work published circa 360 BCE); Plato. (1892). Euthyphro\n(B. Jowett, Trans). (Original work published circa 360 BCE); Plato. (1900). Crito (B. Jowett, Trans). (Original work\npublished circa 360 BCE). These works are in the Public Domain.\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 158 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nastonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made\nseveral trials of the ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became\ninvisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers\nwho were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help\nconspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such\nmagic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other;,no man can be imagined to be of\nsuch an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not\nhis own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any\none at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God\namong men. Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at\nlast to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly\nor because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one\nthinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is\nfar more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say\nthat they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never\ndoing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most\nwretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one\nanother from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of this.\nNow, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust, we must isolate them; there is\nno other way; and how is the isolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,\nand the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and both are to be\nperfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other distinguished\nmasters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps\nwithin their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust make his\nunjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is found\nout is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed just when you are not. Therefore I say\nthat in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,\nbut we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest reputation for\njustice. If he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak\nwith effect, if any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is required his\ncourage and strength, and command of money and friends. And at his side let us place the just man in\nhis nobleness and simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no\nseeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know\nwhether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be\nclothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of life the\nopposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have\nbeen put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its\nconsequences. And let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When\nboth have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be\ngiven which of them is the happier of the two\u2026\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 159 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nCrito\n[Crito comes to visit Socrates while he is in prison awaiting a sentence of death for his conviction on\ncharges of corrupting the youth of Athens.]\n\u2026\nCrito. Fear not. There are persons who at no great cost are willing to save you and bring you out of\nprison; and as for the informers, you may observe that they are far from being exorbitant in their\ndemands; a little money will satisfy them. My means, which, as I am sure, are ample, are at your service,\nand if you have a scruple about spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of theirs;\nand one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a sum of money for this very purpose; and Cebes and\nmany others are willing to spend their money too. I say, therefore, do not on that account hesitate about\nmaking your escape, and do not say, as you did in the court, that you will have a difficulty in knowing\nwhat to do with yourself if you escape. For men will love you in other places to which you may go, and\nnot in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like to go to them, who will value and\nprotect you, and no Thessalian will give you any trouble. Nor can I think that you are justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; this is playing into the hands of your enemies and\ndestroyers; and moreover I should say that you were betraying your children; for you might bring them\nup and educate them; instead of which you go away and leave them, and they will have to take their\nchance; and if they do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks to you. No man\nshould bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nurture and\neducation. But you are choosing the easier part, as I think, not the better and manlier, which would\nrather have become one who professes virtue in all his actions, like yourself. And, indeed, I am ashamed\nnot only of you, but of us who are your friends, when I reflect that this entire business of yours will be\nattributed to our want of courage. The trial need never have come on, or might have been brought to\nanother issue; and the end of all, which is the crowning absurdity, will seem to have been permitted by\nus, through cowardice and baseness, who might have saved you, as you might have saved yourself, if we\nhad been good for anything (for there was no difficulty in escaping); and we did not see how\ndisgraceful, Socrates, and also miserable all this will be to us as well as to you. Make your mind up then,\nor rather have your mind already made up, for the time of deliberation is over, and there is only one\nthing to be done, which must be done, if at all, this very night, and which any delay will render all but\nimpossible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, to be persuaded by me, and to do as I say.\nSocrates. Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if wrong, the greater the zeal the greater\nthe evil; and therefore we ought to consider whether these things shall be done or not. For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason, whatever the reason may be\nwhich upon reflection appears to me to be the best; and now that this fortune has come upon me, I\ncannot put away the reasons which I have before given: the principles which I have hitherto honored and\nrevered I still honor, and unless we can find other and better principles on the instant, I am certain not to\nagree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude could inflict many more imprisonments,\nconfiscations, deaths, frightening us like children with hobgoblin terrors. But what will be the fairest\nway of considering the question? Shall I return to your old argument about the opinions of men, some of\nwhich are to be regarded, and others, as we were saying, are not to be regarded? Now were we right in\nmaintaining this before I was condemned? And has the argument which was once good now proved to\nbe talk for the sake of talking; in fact an amusement only, and altogether vanity? That is what I want to\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 160 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nconsider with your help, Crito: whether, under my present circumstances, the argument appears to be in\nany way different or not; and is to be allowed by me or disallowed. That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many who assume to be authorities, was to the effect, as I was saying, that the opinions\nof some men are to be regarded, and of other men not to be regarded. Now you, Crito, are a disinterested\nperson who are not going to die to-morrow- at least, there is no human probability of this, and you are\ntherefore not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which you are placed. Tell me, then, whether\nI am right in saying that some opinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and other\nopinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued. I ask you whether I was right in\nmaintaining this?\nCr. Certainly.\nSoc. The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\nCr. Yes.\nSoc. And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the unwise are evil?\nCr. Certainly.\nSoc. And what was said about another matter? Was the disciple in gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only- his physician or trainer, whoever that\nwas?\nCr. Of one man only.\nSoc. And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that one only, and not of the many?\nCr. That is clear.\nSoc. And he ought to live and train, and eat and drink in the way which seems good to his single master\nwho has understanding, rather than according to the opinion of all other men put together?\nCr. True.\nSoc. And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of the one, and regards the opinion of\nthe many who have no understanding, will he not suffer evil?\nCr. Certainly he will.\nSoc. And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affcting, in the disobedient person?\nCr. Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\nSoc. Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we need not separately enumerate? In\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 161 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthe matter of just and unjust, fair and foul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present\nconsultation, ought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion of the one man\nwho has understanding, and whom we ought to fear and reverence more than all the rest of the world:\nand whom deserting we shall destroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be\nimproved by justice and deteriorated by injustice; is there not such a principle?\nCr. Certainly there is, Socrates.\nSoc. Take a parallel instance; if, acting under the advice of men who have no understanding, we destroy\nthat which is improvable by health and deteriorated by disease- when that has been destroyed, I say,\nwould life be worth having? And that is- the body?\nCr. Yes.\nSoc. Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\nCr. Certainly not.\nSoc. And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be depraved, which is improved by justice\nand deteriorated by injustice? Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do\nwith justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\nCr. Certainly not.\nSoc. More honored, then?\nCr. Far more honored.\nSoc. Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us: but what he, the one man who has\nunderstanding of just and unjust, will say, and what the truth will say. And therefore you begin in error\nwhen you suggest that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and unjust, good and evil,\nhonorable and dishonorable. Well, someone will say, \"But the many can kill us.\"\nCr. Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\nSoc. That is true; but still I find with surprise that the old argument is, as I conceive, unshaken as ever.\nAnd I should like to know Whether I may say the same of another proposition- that not life, but a good\nlife, is to be chiefly valued?\nCr. Yes, that also remains.\nSoc. And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one- that holds also?\nCr. Yes, that holds.\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 162 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nSoc. From these premises I proceed to argue the question whether I ought or ought not to try to escape\nwithout the consent of the Athenians: and if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt;\nbut if not, I will abstain. The other considerations which you mention, of money and loss of character,\nand the duty of educating children, are, I fear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as\nready to call people to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death- and with as little reason.\nBut now, since the argument has thus far prevailed, the only question which remains to be considered is,\nwhether we shall do rightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and paying them\nin money and thanks, or whether we shan not do rightly; and if the latter, then death or any other\ncalamity which may ensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the calculation.\nCr. I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\nSoc. Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me if you can, and I will be convinced;\nor else cease, my dear friend, from repeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the\nAthenians: for I am extremely desirous to be persuaded by you, but not against my own better judgment.\nAnd now please to consider my first position, and do your best to answer me.\nCr. I will do my best.\nSoc. Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or that in one way we ought and in\nanother way we ought not to do wrong, or is doing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just\nnow saying, and as has been already acknowledged by us? Are all our former admissions which were\nmade within a few days to be thrown away? And have we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with\none another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children? Or are we to rest\nassured, in spite of the opinion of the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, of the\ntruth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil and dishonor to him who acts unjustly? Shall\nwe affirm that?\nCr. Yes.\nSoc. Then we must do no wrong?\nCr. Certainly not.\nSoc. Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we must injure no one at all?\nCr. Clearly not.\nSoc. Again, Crito, may we do evil?\nCr. Surely not, Socrates.\nSoc. And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality of the many-is that just or not?\nCr. Not just.\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 163 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nSoc. For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\nCr. Very true.\nSoc. Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered\nfrom him. But I would have you consider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying. For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable number of persons; and those\nwho are agreed and those who are not agreed upon this point have no common ground, and can only\ndespise one another, when they see how widely they differ. Tell me, then, whether you agree with and\nassent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation nor warding off evil by evil is ever right.\nAnd shall that be the premise of our agreement? Or do you decline and dissent from this? For this has\nbeen of old and is still my opinion; but, if you are of another opinion, let me hear what you have to say.\nIf, however, you remain of the same mind as formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\nCr. You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\nSoc. Then I will proceed to the next step, which may be put in the form of a question: Ought a man to do\nwhat he admits to be right, or ought he to betray the right?\nCr. He ought to do what he thinks right.\nSoc. But if this is true, what is the application? In leaving the prison against the will of the Athenians, do\nI wrong any? or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong? Do I not desert the principles\nwhich were acknowledged by us to be just? What do you say?\nCr. I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\nSoc. Then consider the matter in this way: Imagine that I am about to play truant (you may call the\nproceeding by any name which you like), and the laws and the government come and interrogate me:\n\"Tell us, Socrates,\" they say; \"what are you about? are you going by an act of yours to overturn us- the\nlaws and the whole State, as far as in you lies? Do you imagine that a State can subsist and not be\noverthrown, in which the decisions of law have no power, but are set aside and overthrown by\nindividuals?\" What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words? Anyone, and especially a\nclever rhetorician, will have a good deal to urge about the evil of setting aside the law which requires a\nsentence to be carried out; and we might reply, \"Yes; but the State has injured us and given an unjust\nsentence.\" Suppose I say that?\nCr. Very good, Socrates.\nSoc. \"And was that our agreement with you?\" the law would say, \"or were you to abide by the sentence\nof the State?\" And if I were to express astonishment at their saying this, the law would probably add:\n\"Answer, Socrates, instead of opening your eyes: you are in the habit of asking and answering questions.\nTell us what complaint you have to make against us which justifies you in attempting to destroy us and\nthe State? In the first place did we not bring you into existence? Your father married your mother by our\naid and begat you. Say whether you have any objection to urge against those of us who regulate\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 164 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nmarriage?\" None, I should reply. \"Or against those of us who regulate the system of nurture and\neducation of children in which you were trained? Were not the laws, who have the charge of this, right\nin commanding your father to train you in music and gymnastic?\" Right, I should reply. \"Well, then,\nsince you were brought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the first place\nthat you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before you? And if this is true you are not on equal\nterms with us; nor can you think that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you. Would you\nhave any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to a father or to your master, if you had one, when\nyou have been struck or reviled by him, or received some other evil at his hands?- you would not say\nthis? And because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to destroy us in\nreturn, and your country as far as in you lies? And will you, O professor of true virtue, say that you are\njustified in this? Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is more to be valued and\nhigher and holier far than mother or father or any ancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the\ngods and of men of understanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry,\neven more than a father, and if not persuaded, obeyed? And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if she leads us to wounds or\ndeath in battle, thither we follow as is right; neither may anyone yield or retreat or leave his rank, but\nwhether in battle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his city and his country\norder him; or he must change their view of what is just: and if he may do no violence to his father or\nmother, much less may he do violence to his country.\" What answer shall we make to this, Crito? Do the\nlaws speak truly, or do they not?\nCr. I think that they do.\nSoc. Then the laws will say: \"Consider, Socrates, if this is true, that in your present attempt you are\ngoing to do us wrong. For, after having brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and\ngiven you and every other citizen a share in every good that we had to give, we further proclaim and\ngive the right to every Athenian, that if he does not like us when he has come of age and has seen the\nways of the city, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his goods with him;\nand none of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him. Any of you who does not like us and the city,\nand who wants to go to a colony or to any other city, may go where he likes, and take his goods with\nhim. But he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and administer the State, and\nstill remains, has entered into an implied contract that he will do as we command him. And he who\ndisobeys us is, as we maintain, thrice wrong: first, because in disobeying us he is disobeying his parents;\nsecondly, because we are the authors of his education; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with\nus that he will duly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands\nare wrong; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the alternative of obeying or convincing us;\nthat is what we offer and he does neither. These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying,\nyou, Socrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all other Athenians.\"\nSuppose I ask, why is this? they will justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged\nthe agreement. \"There is clear proof,\" they will say, \"Socrates, that we and the city were not displeasing\nto you. Of all Athenians you have been the most constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave,\nyou may be supposed to love. For you never went out of the city either to see the games, except once\nwhen you went to the Isthmus, or to any other place unless when you were on military service; nor did\nyou travel as other men do. Nor had you any curiosity to know other States or their laws: your affections\ndid not go beyond us and our State; we were your especial favorites, and you acquiesced in our\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 165 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ngovernment of you; and this is the State in which you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction. Moreover, you might, if you had liked, have fixed the penalty at banishment in the course\nof the trial-the State which refuses to let you go now would have let you go then. But you pretended that\nyou preferred death to exile, and that you were not grieved at death. And now you have forgotten these\nfine sentiments, and pay no respect to us, the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon the compacts and\nagreements which you made as a citizen. And first of all answer this very question: Are we right in\nsaying that you agreed to be governed according to us in deed, and not in word only? Is that true or\nnot?\" How shall we answer that, Crito? Must we not agree?\nCr. There is no help, Socrates.\n\u2026\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. If you could do anything and not get caught, what would you do? Why don\u2019t you do that right now?\n2. Do you agree with Glaucon who says that people are only good because they might get punished for\ndoing bad things? Or are there other reasons people don\u2019t do bad things?\n3. Is justice an important virtue to uphold? Why or why not?\n25 The Myth of Gyges and The Crito\nPlato 166 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n26\nGod, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley1\nI. Introduction\nReligion and morality seem to go hand-in-hand, and specific moral codes are often grounded in specific\nreligious traditions. Identifying the nature of the relationship between religion and morality may\ntherefore seem straightforward: the right thing to do is whatever is right according to religious tradition.\nJustification for this claim derives support from the idea that religious moral codes have origins in divine\nwill: \u201cMorality is whatever God commands.\u201d The theory that identifies the morally right with what God\ncommands is called, unsurprisingly, \u2018Divine Command Theory\u2019. Divine Command Theory, or \u2018DCT\u2019, is\nattractive to religious practitioners for a couple reasons. One is that it captures the sense that religion\nprovides guidance for living an ethical life; God provides this guidance through giving commands and\nshaping religious moral codes. Another is that DCT seems to provide a moral theory according to which\nthere are objective moral facts; morality isn\u2019t susceptible to subjective preferences or impermanent\nsocial consciousness. If the morally right is what God commands, there is a true measure of our actions\nand a genuine responsibility for our behavior.\nDespite this attraction, DCT is subject to a dilemma, a style of argument that requires commitment to\neither of two possible, and unfavorable, options. The Divine Command Theorist is forced to make a\nchoice: if the moral is whatever God commands, then either God commands things because they are\nright, or they are right because God commands them. As we will see, taking either option requires\nserious theological concessions.\nA similar dilemma is found in Plato\u2019s Euthyphro, a dialogue in which Socrates inquires about the nature\nof piety, or holiness. Euthyphro begins by proposing that whatever the gods love is pious or holy, and\nthat which they hate is impious or unholy. Socrates presses Euthyphro by raising the dilemma of\nwhether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy, or whether the pious is holy because\nit is loved by the gods. Euthyphro replies that the pious is loved by the gods because it is holy; the pious\nis pious for a reason independent of the relationship between piety and the gods. The gods, then, love the\npious for this reason, whatever the reason ends up being. But whatever is beloved of the gods is beloved\nbecause the gods love it; being beloved by the gods is entirely dependent on the relationship between the\nbeloved and the gods. Socrates cites this difference in dependence as a reason to reject \u2018whatever the\ngods love\u2019 as a legitimate definition of \u2018piety\u2019. There must be something else about piety, independent of\nits relationship to the gods, that establishes its true nature. Socrates is asking Euthyphro for this\nindependent reason, which Euthyphro fails to provide.\nWe can instantiate the same kind of dilemma for Divine Command Theory, inquiring about the nature of\n1 Kristin Seemuth Whaley is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Graceland University.

This work released under a CC-BY license.\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 167 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nmorality. In what follows, we will address each option, or horn of the dilemma, in turn. In taking the\nfirst horn, that God commands things because they are right, the Divine Command Theorist will be\nrequired to concede that God is not unlimited in power. In taking the second horn, that things are right\nbecause God commands them, the Divine Command Theorist will be required to concede that God is not\ntruly good. Since the Divine Command Theorist likely views unlimited power and unlimited goodness\nto be essential divine features, neither of these options is acceptable. Since it was the assumption that\nDCT is true that generated the dilemma, the Divine Command Theorist is forced to conclude that DCT\nis false.\nII. The Dilemma\nDivine Command Theory seems to be an attempt to ground morality theistically; the morally right is\nwhatever God commands. As a background commitment, the Divine Command Theorist is likely\nmotivating the theory in the context of a religious tradition that accepts the divine perfections, or\nattributes of God. The perfections include\n\u2022 omnipotence: God is all-powerful,\n\u2022 omniscience: God is all-knowing, and\n\u2022 omnibenevolence: God is all-good.\nIt is certainly fair to question whether there is such a being that has, or necessarily has, the divine\nperfections. But the dilemma does not hinge on successfully arguing against the perfections. Instead, it is\nbecause the Divine Command Theorist likely accepts the divine perfections that the dilemma arises in\nthe first place.\nA being with the divine perfections, God, seems to be the kind of being that is capable of commanding\nactions that are morally right. Plausibly, God knows what is right, God desires for the right to be done,\nand God is powerful enough to effectively command the right. Therefore, DCT is a natural extension of\nthis variety of theism.\nBut, given the divine perfections, we can construct the dilemma for the Divine Command Theorist:\nA1. If DCT is true, then morality is whatever God commands.\nA2. If morality is whatever God commands, then either God commands things because they are\nmorally right, or things are morally right because God commands them.\nA3. If God commands things because they are morally right, then God is not omnipotent.\nA4. If things are morally right because God commands them, then God is not omnibenevolent.\nA5. God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent.\n\u2234 AC. DCT is false. (\u2018\u2234\u2019 means \u2018therefore\u2019)\nThe argument begins in premise A1 by citing the definition of Divine Command Theory: the morally\nright is what God commands. The Divine Command Theorist will accept this premise, since it provides\nan accurate statement of what DCT is. Premise A2 sketches options for the relationship between\nmorality and God\u2019s commands: either God\u2019s commands are grounded by moral facts or moral facts are\ngrounded by God\u2019s commands. If there is an explanatory relationship between God and morality, then it\nhas to be one or the other. In the first case, God looks to the moral facts to determine what should be\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 168 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\ncommanded, ensuring that God is commanding what is indeed right. In the second case, God\u2019s\ncommands establish the moral facts; whatever God decides is right becomes right in virtue of God\u2019s\ncommand.\nMore work needs to be done to establish premises A3 and A4, and we will see auxiliary arguments for\nthese premises shortly. But before we do so, note that even if you don\u2019t agree with premise A5, the\nDivine Command Theorist almost certainly does. Premise A5 affirms a background commitment that the\nDivine Command Theorist likely accepts: God has the divine perfections. So, since accepting DCT\nyields two unacceptable options, the argument concludes with AC that DCT is false.\nIII. The First Horn: The Argument for A3\nPremise A3 represents the first horn of the dilemma for the Divine Command Theorist: If God\ncommands things because they are morally right, then God is not omnipotent. Premise A3 can be\nestablished by appealing to an auxiliary argument:\nB1. If God commands things because they are morally right, then morality is outside God\u2019s\ncontrol.\nB2. If morality is outside God\u2019s control, then God is not omnipotent.\n\u2234 A3. If God commands things because they are morally right, then God is not omnipotent.\nB1, the first premise of the auxiliary argument highlights the relationship between morality and God\u2019s\ncommands in taking the first horn of the dilemma. According to the first horn, God will guarantee that\nany command given fits with what\u2019s morally right. God will look to the moral facts and then make\ncommands on their basis. So, suppose God is about to issue the Ten Commandments. God will\ninvestigate the nature of morality, identify the moral facts, and issue the commandments accordingly:\nThou shalt not murder, thou shalt not steal, etc. God makes these commands because murder and\nstealing are wrong. The commandments should be followed, then, because the commandments accord\nwith the moral facts. Since God is omnibenevolent, God will only issue commands that fit with the\nmoral facts, and God defers to the moral facts in order to make moral commands. So, although God will\ncommand things that are morally right, the moral facts cannot be determined by God. Otherwise, they\nwould be right because God commands them, and not the other way around.\nHaving deferred to the moral facts, God\u2019s commands are therefore somewhat restricted, and we arrive at\nB2. God cannot decide to command just anything; God will command only what is right. Accordingly,\nmorality is independent of God, and God\u2019s commands are restricted to only what is right. Morality is not\naffected or changed by God\u2019s will. If this is the case, then a whole range of facts, moral facts, are outside\nthe scope of God\u2019s control, and God has no power to change them. But if this is the case, then God is not\nomnipotent; God is not all-powerful.\nSome argue that being restricted by moral facts does not threaten God\u2019s omnipotence. God is also\nrestricted, plausibly, by logical facts. God cannot, for instance, make a round square, but this may not\nseem to be much of a threat to God\u2019s power. Unlike logical facts, however, one might argue that moral\nfacts, like natural facts or physical facts, seem to be exactly the kinds of facts that should be within\nGod\u2019s power. But, in taking this horn of the dilemma, the moral facts instead have power over God.\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 169 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nSo, we arrive at A3: If God commands things because they are morally right, then God is not\nomnipotent. This is an unfortunate result for the Divine Command Theorist, who will consider rejecting\nGod\u2019s omnipotence to be unacceptable. The first horn may then prod the Divine Command Theorist to\nconsider the other option. Instead, perhaps things are morally right because God commands them.\nIV. The Second Horn: The Argument for A4\nPremise A4 represents the second horn of the dilemma for the Divine Command Theorist: If things are\nmorally right because God commands them, then God is not omnibenevolent. Premise A4 can be\nestablished by appealing to an auxiliary argument:\nC1. If things are morally right because God commands them, then God\u2019s commands are morally\narbitrary.\nC2. If God\u2019s commands are morally arbitrary, then God is not omnibenevolent.\n\u2234 A4. If things are morally right because God commands them, then God is not omnibenevolent.\nC1, the first premise of this auxiliary argument illustrates the challenge of taking the second horn of the\ndilemma. This relationship between God\u2019s commands and morality makes it the case that God could\ncommand anything whatsoever and it would be morally right simply because God commanded it. So,\nwhen God issues the commandment, \u2018Thou shalt not murder\u2019, a class of actions, particular kinds of\nkilling, became morally wrong. If God never gave the command, then these kinds of killing would be\nmorally acceptable. If God had not prohibited it, then it would not be morally wrong, for instance, to kill\nan innocent person for no reason, despite any apparently-bad consequences or apparently-bad intentions.\nSince, according to the second horn, the moral facts depend entirely on God\u2019s commands, there is no\nobjective standard that God must look to before making commands. God could command, \u2018Thou shalt\nput on thy right shoe before thy left shoe except on every third Thursday of the month, in which case\nthou shalt put on thy left shoe before thy right.\u2019, and it would become immoral to put on your left shoe\nbefore your right on a Monday. Such a command is totally unprincipled, and we should feel no moral\npull toward either shoe. This is because such a command would be morally arbitrary, or without\nprinciple or moral reason. There is no external standard by which we could measure the legitimacy of\nthe command and no recourse to appeal to if we broke it. So, C1, if things are right because God\ncommands them, then God\u2019s commands are morally arbitrary.\nEven worse, if God\u2019s commands are morally arbitrary, then God could command things that we consider\nto be morally reprehensible, and these things would become right. For instance, God could command\n\u2018Thou shalt torture thy children\u2019, and it would be morally right to torture your children. Any complaints\nthat this is wrong would fall on deaf ears, for, according to the second horn, if God commanded it, it is\nnot wrong. The fact that the second horn allows that God could command things like the torture of\nchildren negates any lingering plausibility concerning God\u2019s omnibenevolence.\nIt is very tempting at this point to think, \u201cWell, God would never command the torture of children,\nbecause torturing children is wrong, and God would not command something that is wrong.\u201d But note\nthat in making this move, we find ourselves again facing the first horn. If God would not command\nsomething that is wrong, then this is possible only if God looks to the moral facts in order to determine\nwhat to command. But, if God does so, then morality is outside God\u2019s control. The Divine Command\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 170 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nTheorist can make this move, but then they must give up on God\u2019s omnipotence.\nThe moral arbitrariness of God\u2019s commands is a serious problem for the Divine Command Theorist,\nwhich we see in C2. Recall that God is supposed to be omnibenevolent. When omnibenevolence is\nattributed to God, it is supposed to highlight a perfection or a laudable divine quality. But if morality is\narbitrary, then saying that God is good becomes trivial. It would be analogous to saying that God is\ndivine, or, like Euthyphro, saying that whatever is beloved by the gods is loved by the gods. It may be\ntrue, but it does not provide any reason to think that divinity is a good-making feature or a perfection; it\nis true simply because anything that is God is divine. Likewise, anything that God commands would be\nmorally right. So, saying that God is omnibenevolent is merely another way of saying that God meets\nthe moral standard that God establishes. This is not praise-worthy; it is trivial.\nWe arrive at A4: If things are morally right because God commands them, then God is not\nomnibenevolent. Like rejecting God\u2019s omnipotence, rejecting God\u2019s omnibenevolence is likely to be\nconsidered unacceptable. In taking the second horn, the Divine Command Theorist fares just as poorly\nas in taking the first. Both options require conceding divine perfections, but this is inconsistent with\nwhat the Divine Command Theorist is trying to accomplish.\nV. Remaining Options\nHaving established the auxiliary arguments, we now see the dilemma completed. If DCT is true, then\neither God commands things because they are morally right, or they are morally right because God\ncommands them. If God commands things because they are right, then God is not omnipotent. If things\nare right because God commands them, then God is not omnibenevolent. Since God is (according to the\ndivine perfections) both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, then we must conclude that DCT is false.\nDCT has attraction given certain religious commitments. It is unlikely that an atheist, for instance,\nwould endorse DCT. The dilemma is therefore forceful because it is contingent on a theological\nunderstanding that attributes the divine perfections to God. It is logically possible, however, for the\nDivine Command Theorist to reject A5 and deny that God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent. An\nobjection could take the form of arguing that it is theologically acceptable to say that God is not\nomnipotent or that God is not omnibenevolent. A Divine Command Theorist might prioritize the\nconnection between God and morality over the divine perfections, and they may consider this to be\nnecessary, albeit unpalatable, concession.\nAnother option is to deny the explanatory relationship between morality and God\u2019s commands. Perhaps\nwhat God commands is morally right but not because it is morally right, and whatever is morally right is\nmorally right but not because God commands it. On this option, the class of actions that God commands\nis identical to the class of actions that are morally right, but there is no dependence in either direction.\nIn reply, I grant that these options are possible. They are not, however, desirable. While there may be\ntheists willing to concede the divine perfections, I suggest that in doing so we likewise concede\nattraction to grounding morality theistically. The connection between God and morality seems attractive\nbecause of the divine perfections, and conceding the divine perfections weakens the case to think that\nGod and morality are inextricably linked. Further, if one thinks that God and morality are inextricably\nlinked, it is implausible to argue that there is no explanatory relationship between them.\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 171 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nVI. Conclusion\nIt is natural for religious practitioners to see religion as authoritative in matters of morality. But if DCT\nis true, and morality is whatever God commands, then a dilemma arises. Either way we try to define the\nrelationship between the morally right and the commands of God, an unacceptable result follows. Either\nmorality is outside God\u2019s control, in which case God is not omnipotent, or God\u2019s commands are morally\narbitrary, in which case God is not omnibenevolent. Since omnipotence and omnibenevolence are divine\nperfections that cannot be simply subtracted from God\u2019s nature, both horns of the dilemma are\nunacceptable. As a result, we, and the Divine Command Theorist, should conclude that DCT is false.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. What is the point of the Euthyphro dilemma and how can this create problems for DCT?\n2. What are the reasons some people believe religion is necessary in order to have morality? Do you\nthink they are right? Why or why not?\n3. If God is perfect, does DCT still make sense? Why or why not?\n26 God, Morality, and Religion\nKristin Seemuth Whaley 172 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n27\nThe Categorical Imperative\nImmanuel Kant1\nThe Categorical Imperative\n\u2026Now all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically. The former represent the\npractical necessity of a possible action as means to something else that is willed (or at least which one\nmight possibly will). The categorical imperative would be that which represented an action as necessary\nof itself without reference to another end, i. e., as objectively necessary\u2026\nFinally, there is an imperative which commands a certain conduct immediately, without having as its\ncondition any other purpose to be attained by it. This imperative is categorical. It concerns not the matter\nof the action, or its intended result, but its form and the principle of which it is itself a result; and what is\nessentially good in it consists in the mental disposition, let the consequence be what it may. This\nimperative may be called that of morality. There is a marked distinction also between the volitions on\nthese three sorts of principles in the dissimilarity of the obligation of the will. In order to mark this\ndifference more clearly, I think they would be most suitably named in their order if we said they are\neither rules of skill, or counsels of prudence, or commands (laws) of morality. For it is law only that\ninvolves the conception of an unconditional and objective necessity, which is consequently universally\nvalid; and commands are laws which must be obeyed, that is, must be followed, even in opposition to\ninclination\u2026\nThere is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely, this: Act only on that maxim whereby thou\ncanst at the same time will that it should become a universal law. Now if all imperatives of duty can be\ndeduced from this one imperative as from their principle, then, although it should remain undecided\nwhat is called duty is not merely a vain notion, yet at least we shall be able to show what we understand\nby it and what this notion means. Since the universality of the law according to which effects are\nproduced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense (as to form), that is the\nexistence of things so far as it is determined by general laws, the imperative of duty may be expressed\nthus: Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature. We will\nnow enumerate a few duties, adopting the usual division of them into duties to ourselves and ourselves\nand to others, and into perfect and imperfect duties\u2026\n1. A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied of life, but is still so far in\npossession of his reason that he can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself\nto take his own life. Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of\nnature. His maxim is: \u201cFrom self-love I adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration\nis likely to bring more evil than satisfaction.\u201d It is asked then simply whether this principle founded on\n1 From: Kant, I. (1883). Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (T.K. Abbott, Trans.). (Original work published 1785).\nThis work is in the Public Domain.\n27 The Categorical Imperative\nImmanuel Kant 173 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nself-love can become a universal law of nature. Now we see at once that a system of nature of which it\nshould be a law to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the\nimprovement of life would contradict itself and, therefore, could not exist as a system of nature; hence\nthat maxim cannot possibly exist as a universal law of nature and, consequently, would be wholly\ninconsistent with the supreme principle of all duty.\n2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows that he will not be able to\nrepay it, but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite\ntime. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself: \u201cIs it not\nunlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way?\u201d Suppose however that he\nresolves to do so: then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus: \u201cWhen I think myself in want\nof money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can do so.\u201d Now\nthis principle of self-love or of one\u2019s own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future\nwelfare; but the question now is, \u201cIs it right?\u201d I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal\nlaw, and state the question thus: \u201cHow would it be if my maxim were a universal law?\u201d Then I see at\nonce that it could never hold as a universal law of nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For\nsupposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to\npromise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping his promise, the promise itself would\nbecome impossible, as well as the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider\nthat anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretences.\n3. A third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some culture might make him a useful man in\nmany respects. But he finds himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure\nrather than to take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities. He asks, however,\nwhether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence,\nagrees also with what is called duty. He sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such\na universal law although men (like the South Sea islanders) should let their talents rest and resolve to\ndevote their lives merely to idleness, amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to\nenjoyment; but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature, or be implanted in\nus as such by a natural instinct. For, as a rational being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be\ndeveloped, since they serve him and have been given him, for all sorts of possible purposes.\n4. A fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others have to contend with great wretchedness and\nthat he could help them, thinks: \u201cWhat concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy as Heaven\npleases, or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor even envy him, only I do not wish\nto contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance in distress!\u201d Now no doubt if such a mode of\nthinking were a universal law, the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better than in\na state in which everyone talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes care occasionally to put it into\npractice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can, betrays the rights of men, or otherwise violates\nthem. But although it is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with that\nmaxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should have the universal validity of a law of nature.\nFor a will which resolved this would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one\nwould have need of the love and sympathy of others, and in which, by such a law of nature, sprung from\nhis own will, he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires. These are a few of the many\nactual duties, or at least what we regard as such, which obviously fall into two classes on the one\n27 The Categorical Imperative\nImmanuel Kant 174 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nprinciple that we have laid down.\nWe must be able to will that a maxim of our action should be a universal law. This is the canon of the\nmoral appreciation of the action generally. Some actions are of such a character that their maxim cannot\nwithout contradiction be even conceived as a universal law of nature, far from it being possible that we\nshould will that it should be so. In others this intrinsic impossibility is not found, but still it is impossible\nto will that their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature, since such a will would\ncontradict itself It is easily seen that the former violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) duty; the latter only\nlaxer (meritorious) duty. Thus it has been completely shown how all duties depend as regards the nature\nof the obligation (not the object of the action) on the same principle. If now we attend to ourselves on\noccasion of any transgression of duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be\na universal law, for that is impossible for us; on the contrary, we will that the opposite should remain a\nuniversal law, only we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favour or (just for this time\nonly) in favour of our inclination.\nConsequently if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view, namely, that of reason, we\nshould find a contradiction in our own will, namely, that a certain principle should be objectively\nnecessary as a universal law, and yet subjectively should not be universal, but admit of exceptions. As\nhowever we at one moment regard our action from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to\nreason, and then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will affected by inclination,\nthere is not really any contradiction, but an antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason, whereby\nthe universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality, so that the practical principle of\nreason shall meet the maxim half way. Now, although this cannot be justified in our own impartial\njudgement, yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of the categorical imperative and (with\nall respect for it) only allow ourselves a few exceptions, which we think unimportant and forced from\nus. We have thus established at least this much, that if duty is a conception which is to have any import\nand real legislative authority for our actions, it can only be expressed in categorical and not at all in\nhypothetical imperatives. We have also, which is of great importance, exhibited clearly and definitely\nfor every practical application the content of the categorical imperative, which must contain the\nprinciple of all duty if there is such a thing at all.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Do you think Kant is right that we should ignore the consequences of our actions when determining\nwhat the right thing to do is? Why or why not?\n2. Would you lie to the ax murderer? Why or why not?\n3. Do you agree with Kant that there are never exceptions to moral rules?\n27 The Categorical Imperative\nImmanuel Kant 175 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n28\nThe Virtues\nAristotle1\nAristotle\u2019s Virtues\nBook I\nvii\nPresumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems a platitude, and a clearer account of\nwhat it is still desired. This might perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of man. For\njust as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and, in general, for all things that have a function or\nactivity, the good and the 'well' is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if he\nhas a function. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions or activities, and has man\nnone? Is he born without a function? Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has\na function, may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all these? What then can\nthis be? Life seems to be common even to plants, but we are seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us\nexclude, therefore, the life of nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception, but it also\nseems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal. There remains, then, an active life of\nthe element that has a rational principle; of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being\nobedient to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thought. And, as 'life of the\nrational element' also has two meanings, we must state that life in the sense of activity is what we mean;\nfor this seems to be the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function of man is an activity of soul\nwhich follows or implies a rational principle, and if we say 'so-and-so-and 'a good so-and-so' have a\nfunction which is the same in kind, e.g. a lyre, and a good lyre-player, and so without qualification in all\ncases, eminence in respect of goodness being idded to the name of the function (for the function of a\nlyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player is to do so well): if this is the case, and we\nstate the function of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions of the soul\nimplying a rational principle, and the function of a good man to be the good and noble performance of\nthese, and if any action is well performed when it is performed in accordance with the appropriate\nexcellence: if this is the case, human good turns out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue, and\nif there are more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete.\nBut we must add 'in a complete life.' For one swallow does not make a summer, nor does one day; and\nso too one day, or a short time, does not make a man blessed and happy\u2026\nviii\nWe must consider it, however, in the light not only of our conclusion and our premisses, but also of what\nis commonly said about it; for with a true view all the data harmonize, but with a false one the facts soon\nclash. Now goods have been divided into three classes, and some are described as external, others as\n1 From: Aristotle. (1925). Nicomachean Ethics (W.D. Ross, Trans.). (Original work published circa 350 BCE). This work is\nin the Public Domain.\n28 The Virtues\nAristotle 176 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nrelating to soul or to body; we call those that relate to soul most properly and truly goods, and psychical\nactions and activities we class as relating to soul. Therefore our account must be sound, at least\naccording to this view, which is an old one and agreed on by philosophers. It is correct also in that we\nidentify the end with certain actions and activities; for thus it falls among goods of the soul and not\namong external goods. Another belief which harmonizes with our account is that the happy man lives\nwell and does well; for we have practically defined happiness as a sort of good life and good action. The\ncharacteristics that are looked for in happiness seem also, all of them, to belong to what we have defined\nhappiness as being. For some identify happiness with virtue, some with practical wisdom, others with a\nkind of philosophic wisdom, others with these, or one of these, accompanied by pleasure or not without\npleasure; while others include also external prosperity. Now some of these views have been held by\nmany men and men of old, others by a few eminent persons; and it is not probable that either of these\nshould be entirely mistaken, but rather that they should be right in at least some one respect or even in\nmost respects.\nWith those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue our account is in harmony; for to\nvirtue belongs virtuous activity. But it makes, perhaps, no small difference whether we place the chief\ngood in possession or in use, in state of mind or in activity. For the state of mind may exist without\nproducing any good result, as in a man who is asleep or in some other way quite inactive, but the activity\ncannot; for one who has the activity will of necessity be acting, and acting well. And as in the Olympic\nGames it is not the most beautiful and the strongest that are crowned but those who compete (for it is\nsome of these that are victorious), so those who act win, and rightly win, the noble and good things in\nlife.\nTheir life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state of soul, and to each man that which he is said to\nbe a lover of is pleasant; e.g. not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle to the\nlover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant to the lover of justice and in general\nvirtuous acts to the lover of virtue. Now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another\nbecause these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find pleasant the things that are\nby nature pleasant; and virtuous actions are such, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in\ntheir own nature. Their life, therefore, has no further need of pleasure as a sort of adventitious charm,\nbut has its pleasure in itself. For, besides what we have said, the man who does not rejoice in noble\nactions is not even good; since no one would call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly, nor any\nman liberal who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in all other cases. If this is so, virtuous\nactions must be in themselves pleasant. But they are also good and noble, and have each of these\nattributes in the highest degree, since the good man judges well about these attributes; his judgement is\nsuch as we have described. Happiness then is the best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world, and\nthese attributes are not severed as in the inscription at Delos-\nMost noble is that which is justest, and best is health;\nBut pleasantest is it to win what we love.\nFor all these properties belong to the best activities; and these, or one- the best- of these, we identify\nwith happiness.\nYet evidently, as we said, it needs the external goods as well; for it is impossible, or not easy, to do\n28 The Virtues\nAristotle 177 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nnoble acts without the proper equipment. In many actions we use friends and riches and political power\nas instruments; and there are some things the lack of which takes the lustre from happiness, as good\nbirth, goodly children, beauty; for the man who is very ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary and\nchildless is not very likely to be happy, and perhaps a man would be still less likely if he had thoroughly\nbad children or friends or had lost good children or friends by death. As we said, then, happiness seems\nto need this sort of prosperity in addition; for which reason some identify happiness with good fortune,\nthough others identify it with virtue\u2026\nx\n\u2026When then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordance with complete virtue and is\nsufficiently equipped with external goods, not for some chance period but throughout a complete life?\nOr must we add 'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'? Certainly the future is\nobscure to us, while happiness, we claim, is an end and something in every way final. If so, we shall call\nhappy those among living men in whom these conditions are, and are to be, fulfilled- but happy men. So\nmuch for these questions\u2026.\nBook II\ni\nVirtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth\nand its growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes\nabout as a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is one that is formed by a slight variation from\nthe word ethos (habit). From this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for\nnothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For instance the stone which by\nnature moves downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by\nthrowing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything else\nthat by nature behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary\nto nature do the virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect\nby habit.\nAgain, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire the potentiality and later exhibit the\nactivity (this is plain in the case of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing that we got\nthese senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used them, and did not come to have them by\nusing them); but the virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as\nwell. For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them, e.g. men become\nbuilders by building and lyreplayers by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts,\ntemperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.\nThis is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in\nthem, and this is the wish of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in\nthis that a good constitution differs from a bad one.\nAgain, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every virtue is both produced and\ndestroyed, and similarly every art; for it is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are\nproduced. And the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest; men will be good or\n28 The Virtues\nAristotle 178 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nbad builders as a result of building well or badly. For if this were not so, there would have been no need\nof a teacher, but all men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is the case with the\nvirtues also; by doing the acts that we do in our transactions with other men we become just or unjust,\nand by doing the acts that we do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel fear or\nconfidence, we become brave or cowardly. The same is true of appetites and feelings of anger; some\nmen become temperate and good-tempered, others self-indulgent and irascible, by behaving in one way\nor the other in the appropriate circumstances. Thus, in one word, states of character arise out of like\nactivities. This is why the activities we exhibit must be of a certain kind; it is because the states of\ncharacter correspond to the differences between these. It makes no small difference, then, whether we\nform habits of one kind or of another from our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather all\nthe difference\u2026\nii\n\u2026First, then, let us consider this, that it is the nature of such things to be destroyed by defect and excess,\nas we see in the case of strength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible we must use the\nevidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective exercise destroys the strength, and similarly\ndrink or food which is above or below a certain amount destroys the health, while that which is\nproportionate both produces and increases and preserves it. So too is it, then, in the case of temperance\nand courage and the other virtues. For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand\nhis ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet\nevery danger becomes rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains from\nnone becomes self-indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way\ninsensible; temperance and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the\nmean\u2026\nvi\n\u2026If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well- by looking to the intermediate and judgling its\nworks by this standard (so that we often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take\naway or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness of works of art, while the\nmean preserves it; and good artists, as we say, look to this in their work), and if, further, virtue is more\nexact and better than any art, as nature also is, then virtue must have the quality of aiming at the\nintermediate. I mean moral virtue; for it is this that is concerned with passions and actions, and in these\nthere is excess, defect, and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and confidence and appetite and\nanger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in both\ncases not well; but to feel them at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right\npeople, with the right motive, and in the right way, is what is both intermediate and best, and this is\ncharacteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate.\nNow virtue is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, and so is defect,\nwhile the intermediate is praised and is a form of success; and being praised and being successful are\nboth characteristics of virtue. Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we have seen, it aims at what\nis intermediate.\nAgain, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the\nPythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way\n(for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult- to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for\n28 The Virtues\nAristotle 179 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nthese reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue;\nFor men are good in but one way, but bad in many.\nVirtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us,\nthis being determined by a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical\nwisdom would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on excess and that\nwhich depends on defect; and again it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed\nwhat is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that which is\nintermediate. Hence in respect of its substance and the definition which states its essence virtue is a\nmean, with regard to what is best and right an extreme.\nBut not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some have names that already imply\nbadness, e.g. spite, shamelessness, envy, and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of\nthese and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad, and not the excesses or\ndeficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever to be right with regard to them; one must always be\nwrong. Nor does goodness or badness with regard to such things depend on committing adultery with\nthe right woman, at the right time, and in the right way, but simply to do any of them is to go wrong. It\nwould be equally absurd, then, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous action there should be\na mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there would be a mean of excess and of deficiency,\nan excess of excess, and a deficiency of deficiency. But as there is no excess and deficiency of\ntemperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we\nhave mentioned there is no mean nor any excess and deficiency, but however they are done they are\nwrong; for in general there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a\nmean.\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1.

The distinctions of moral\nvalues have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled\u2014or\namong the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts.\nIn the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted,\nproud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of\nrank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted,\nproud disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of\nmorality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\" means practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\",\u2014the\nantithesis \"good\" and \"EVIL\" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and\nthose thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their\nconstrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the\nmendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:\u2014it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the\ncommon people are untruthful. \"We truthful ones\"\u2014the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves.\nIt is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and\nwere only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when\nhistorians of morals start with questions like, \"Why have sympathetic actions been praised?\" The noble\ntype of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he\npasses the judgment: \"What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that it is he himself only\nwho confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in\nhimself: such morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of\npower, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which\nwould fain give and bestow:\u2014the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not\u2014or scarcely\u2014out of\npity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble man honours in\nhimself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to\n1 From: Nietzsche, F. (1906). Beyond Good and Evil (H. Zimmern, Trans.).

Such a type of man is even proud of not being\nmade for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: \"He who has not a hard heart when\nyoung, will never have one.\" The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the\nmorality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in\nDESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical\nenmity and irony towards \"selflessness,\" belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn\nand precaution in presence of sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"\nIt is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The\nprofound reverence for age and for tradition\u2014all law rests on this double reverence,\u2014the belief and\nprejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the\npowerful; and if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost instinctively in \"progress\" and the\n\"future,\" and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby.\nA morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day\ntaste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards\nbeings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or \"as the heart desires,\"\nand in any case \"beyond good and evil\": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a\nplace. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge\u2014both only\nwithin the circle of equals,\u2014artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a\ncertain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance\u2014in\nfact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as\nhas been pointed out, is not the morality of \"modern ideas,\" and is therefore at present difficult to\nrealize, and also to unearth and disclose.\nIt is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the\nabused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves\nshould moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic\nsuspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of\nman, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he\nhas a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything \"good\" that is there honoured\u2014\nhe would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE\nqualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded\nwith light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility,\nand friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means\nof supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.\nHere is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis \"good\" and \"evil\":\u2014power and\ndangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do\nnot admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the \"evil\" man arouses fear;\naccording to master-morality, it is precisely the \"good\" man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it,\nwhile the bad man is regarded as the despicable being.\n29 Beyond Good and Evil\nFriedrich Nietzsche 182 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nThe contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-\nmorality, a shade of depreciation\u2014it may be slight and well-intentioned\u2014at last attaches itself to the\n\"good\" man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in\nany case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme.\nEverywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the\nsignifications of the words \"good\" and \"stupid.\"\nFor Review and Discussion:\n1. Describe the two types of moralities that Nietzsche says exist.\n2. What would someone who is \u201cbeyond morality\u201d look like? What do you think they would do?\n3. Think back to the Ring of Gyges and the idea that Glaucon claims that people would do whatever they\nfeel like and is in their own self-interests if they could do anything without fear of consequences. What\nsorts of things do you think \u201cNietzschean Supermen\u201d would do, keeping in mind that they would live\ntheir lives without fear of consequences?\n29 Beyond Good and Evil\nFriedrich Nietzsche 183 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n30\nOther Moral Theories: Subjectivism,\nRelativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko1\nMetaethics includes moral theories that contain assumptions which answer some metaphysical\nand epistemological questions about moral goods and values. The metaphysical questions (such as What\nare, and how do moral goods and values exist?) are about the nature and existence of moral goods and\nvalues. Epistemological questions (such as Can we know moral goods and values? If so, what are the\nsources of knowledge about them?) regard sources of knowledge about moral goods, values and criteria\nof moral evaluations.2 Assumptions of ethical subjectivism, relativism, decisionism, emotivism and\nintuitionism are exemplary answers to these questions. We call their answers \u201cnormative assumptions.\u201d\nThere are at least three good reasons to ask and answer such questions. First, without answering\nthem, moral judgments remain ambiguous. For example, if I say, \u201cAction X is wrong,\u201d the judgement\nhas several meanings. To specify its sense, I should clarify my normative assumptions. For example, I\ncan assume metaphysical subjectivism (anti-realism) or realism in metaethics. According to the former\nassumption, my above judgment about X is not about reality; it is about my or someone\u2019s opinion. In\nthis case, the exact meaning of this judgement is: someone evaluates X as morally wrong. If I assume\nthe counter-assumption of metaphysical realism (anti-subjectivism), I mean that it is true that X has the\nproperty of moral wrongness.\nSecond, these assumptions are conductive to peculiar practices. To specify the practice, which\nfollows from moral judgments, one has to determine some normative assumptions. For example, if I take\nthe assumption of epistemological subjectivism (agnosticism) \u2013 I believe that no one can have any\nknowledge about moral goods and values; I mean that morality is a matter of preferences, which have no\nground in knowledge. In practice, it means that one should not search for knowledge about goods and\nvalues to validate moral preferences, because such knowledge is not possible. If I believe in\nepistemological anti-subjectivism (realism), I assume that humans can possess some (precise or\napproximate, dubitable or indubitable) knowledge about goods and values, I should investigate my\nmoral preferences and accommodate them to my knowledge. In practice of the public sphere, ethical\nepistemological subjectivists postulate accommodating the public morality and the law to individual or\ngroup preferences. Ethical epistemological anti-subjectists search for knowledge about moral principles\nand attempt to adopt public morality and the law to the principles.\nThird, the ambiguity of moral judgments is conducive to misunderstandings and violent conflicts.\nTo avoid them, one should clarify one\u2019s normative assumptions. People can disagree about normative\nassumptions. If the opposing groups do not clarify their normative assumptions, they can struggle\n1 Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Faculty of Management and Social Communication.

Are they merely social inventions?\nDo they involve more than expressions of our individual emotions? Metaethical answers to these questions focus on the\nissues of universal truths, the will of God, the role of reason in ethical judgments, and the meaning of ethical terms\nthemselves.\u201d (Fieser, n.d.)\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 184 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nagainst each other without knowing the matter of their disagreement. Mutual misunderstanding limits\nchances for dialogue, negotiations and consensus. In this case, the conflict turns irrational and violent.\nWhen people do not understand each other, their power becomes the decisive argument in their dispute,\nand their confrontation is the way to test this argument. Therefore, mutual misunderstandings are\nconducive to violent conflicts. For example, defenders of human rights sometimes fight each other over\nhow to promote human rights, because of different normative assumptions that conceptualise human\nrights by answering questions such as: Who is human? Why should one respect human rights? When the\nopposing groups do not clarify their answers to these questions, opponents do not understand the\nposition of the other party. If their defenders specify their normative assumptions, their concept of\nhuman rights becomes comprehensible to other groups, and their mutual understanding is conducive to\ndialogue, negotiations and a consensus.\nTo illustrate the role normative assumptions in communication, we present a conversation\nbetween John (J) and Mary (M). John maintains that lying is morally wrong. Mary wants to understand\nhis position. For example:\nM: Why is lying morally wrong? (Q1)\nJ: Because when you lie, you disrespect human dignity, which deserves respect.\nM: Can you prove your position? (Q2)\nJ: No but you can intuit its truth: you can reach some evidence about it if you activate your\nintuition.\nIn the above conversation, John presents assumptions of ethical personalism and intuitionism.\nAccording to his personalism, human dignity is the moral good. His intuitionism is the assumption that\npeople can know this good by intuition. In this chapter, we consider possible further questions of Mary\nand alternative answers of John.\nSome regulatory definitions\nIn this text, \u201cmorality\u201d means a system of moral norms and rules, which compose a moral code of\nconduct (conduct of moral code). In this meaning one can use the term \u201ceither descriptively to refer to\nsome codes of conduct put forward by a society or some other group, such as a religion, or accepted by\nan individual for her own behaviour or normatively to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified\nconditions, would be put forward by all rational persons\u201d (Gert, 2012). In the descriptive sense,\n\u201cmorality\u201d means a fact of personal preferences, decisions, actions, evaluations according to some\n(moral) conventions of preferring, decision-making, acting, evaluating (Wreen, 2018, pp. 351\u2013353). In\nthe normative sense, \u201cmorality\u201d means ideal \u2013 a pattern for the fact of morality.\nWe mean the strict sense of the \u201cmoral code.\u201d In this sense, it comprises only moral norms and\nrules. In a broad sense, it also contains \u201cmoral principles \u2026 ideals, virtues, goals, aims, and values, and\nat least ideally integrates all such components into a unified, workable whole, a \u2018way of life.\u2019 Order,\nstructure, coordination, and integration, in other words, are important features of a moral code, as is an\nexplanation and justification of both the content and structure of the code.\u201d (Wreen, 2018, pp. 345\u2013246)\nWe distinguish moral principle(s) from moral norms and rules. By \u201cmoral principle\u201d or the\n\u201cprinciple of morality\u201d we mean the most precious (intrinsic, autotelic, most appreciated) goods\naccording to a given hierarchy of values. Moral norms and rules operationalise the idea of moral\nprinciple. Moral norms are criteria to evaluate acts regarding their compliance with the moral\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 185 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nprinciple(s). Moral rules specify the proper way to respect and promote the moral principle(s).\nNormative assumptions (of a theory) determine the hierarchy of goods/values and, in this way, specify\nthe normative morality.\nWe distinguish moral principle from moral value: Moral value consists in respecting the\nprinciple of morality by intentions and actions. Intentions that respect it, are morally good (have the\nvalue of moral goodness) and actions that respect the principle of morality are morally right (have the\nvalue of moral rightness). The opposite of these values are anti-values of moral badness (of intentions)\nand moral wrongness (of actions). Consequently, we distinguish moral values (Lat. bonum morale) from\nmoral (honest) goods (lat. bona honesta). Moral values are qualities of human acts. Moral goods are\nobjectives of human acts. Such goods are considered most precious according to a hierarchy of goods\nadopted by a person. For example, if John assumes that human dignity is the moral good, he maintains\nthat it is at the top of the hierarchy of goods (human dignity is more precious than any other good).\nAccording to this assumption, when someone intends respecting human dignity, his/her intention is\nmorally good (it has the moral value of moral goodness); when he/she respects human dignity by his/her\nactions, they are morally right (they have the moral value of moral rightness). According to the anti-\nrelativist theory of moral goods, they are precious regardless of personal preferences. According to the\nrelativist theory of moral goods, they are precious because someone appreciates them. See, section\n\u201cWhat are the criteria of moral assessment? Normative relativism versus anti-relativism in metaethics\u201d.\nIn this text, the term \u201chierarchy of values\u201d and \u201chierarchy of goods\u201d means the system of\npreferences (Hansson & Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff, 2018). We use the terms \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d interchangeably.\nHowever, in some contexts, the \u201cvalue\u201d means something precious for someone, and the term \u201cgood\u201d\nmeans something precious regardless of personal preferences.\nHow do moral goods and values exist? Metaphysical realism versus anti-realism (subjectivism) in\nmetaethics\nIn the above conversation, Mary can ask for more information about human dignity. For example, she\ncan ask:\nM: Is human dignity something real? (Q3)\nM: Do all humans possess their dignity? (Q4)\nJohn can offer two answers to the 3rd question: the answer of metaphysical realism and anti-\nrealism (subjectivism) (Harrison, 1967b; Kim, 2006; Sayre-McCord, 2011). According to supporters of\nmetaphysical realism in metaethics, moral goods are real, because they exist autonomously \u2013\nregardless of any personal preferences:3 something is good or not good regardless of personal opinions,\ndecisions, or emotions about it. According to this position, moral goods are intrinsic to some beings,\nsituations, or states of affairs.\nIf John takes this position and maintains his personalism, he means that human dignity is\nintrinsic to persons and precious regardless of any human acts about it. If he abandons his personalism,\nhe can specify the moral good differently, according to alternative conceptions of moral good within the\ntheory metaphysical realism in metaethics. For example, he can maintain that love (agapism), happiness\n3 We use the terms \u201cexistential autonomy,\u201d \u201cexistential heteronomy\u201d and \u201cpurely intentional objects\u201d in their sense as defined\nby Roman Ingarden (Ingarden, 1983, 1989).\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 186 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\n(eudaemonism) or pleasure (hedonism) is intrinsically good.\nIf John abandons metaphysical realism, he takes the position of metaphysical subjectivism\n(anti-realism) and maintains that moral goods are not real, they exist solely by the power of human\nintentions.4 According to this assumption, human acts make something good by intending it, for\nexample, by respecting, aiming at, wanting, or evaluating it. If John takes this position, he should give a\nnegative answer to the 3rd question.\nThe above standpoints of ethical realism and antirealism do not determine the answer to the 4th\nquestion. Ethical realists can assume that all human beings have dignity or that only some humans, who\nmeet some conditions of personhood, have their dignity. Ethical subjectivists may agree with this\nanswer, by showing that only humans who are appreciated by someone have their dignity. However,\nsome ethical anti-realists may assume that all humans deserve respect, because respecting them is a\nprerequisite for rational intentions, like Immanuel Kant shows in his conception of the categorical\nimperative.\nThe two above conceptions lead towards distinct theories of moral value. In their contexts John\nshould offer distinct answers to the question:\nM: Is lying morally wrong or it just seems morally wrong to some people? (Q5)\nThe theories of ethical realism and antirealism in metaethics differ in their answer to the above\nquestion. Supporters of metaphysical realism in metaethics maintain that moral judgments are about\n\u201cmoral facts\u201d and can be true or false in the correspondence sense of truth (Harrison, 1967b, 1967a).\nThey are either \u201cnatural (objects that are knowable only through experience), non-natural (but not\nsupernatural) or theological (or supernatural)\u201d (Campbell, 2015) This position can also have a name\n\u201cethical objectivism\u201d (Harrison, 1967a). The position implies that there are some sources of knowledge\nabout moral values. According to this position, John may say, that it is true that lying is wrong.\nEthical metaphysical subjectivists (anti-realists) claim that moral values are purely intentional\npredicates with no existential autonomy; they exist by the \u201cpower\u201d of human acts (beliefs, feelings,\ndecisions, attitudes or preferences). As Jonathan Harrison puts it, according to ethical subjectivist\ntheories, \u201c\u2026 moral predicates are not possessed by actions or actors in the absence of people who pass\njudgments upon them or who respond to them with such feelings as admiration, love, approval,\ndetestation, hate, or disapproval\u201d (Harrison, 1967b, p. 78). According to this approach, human acts\n\u201ccreate\u201d moral values. We put the term \u201ccreate\u201d in quotation because it does mean creating something\nreal. It means creating purely intentional objects. In this context goods or values are purely intentional\nobjects, which exist by the \u201cpower\u201d of the intention. According to this position, moral judgements are\nnot about any reality; they are about human evaluations or reactions. As Harrison writes, \u201cA subjectivist\nethical theory is a theory according to which moral judgments about men or their actions are judgments\nabout the way people react to these men and actions \u2014 that is, the way they think or feel about them\u201d\n(Harrison, 1967b, p. 78).\nIf John takes the position of metaphysical antirealism, he should not say that it is true that lying\nis wrong. He should rather say that some people believe that it is morally wrong. In this case, Mary\nshould ask him:\n4 In this text, terms \u201cintention\u201d and \u201cintentionality\u201d denote the relation between human acts and their intentional objects\n(Brentano, 1973; Husserl, 2001; Jacob, 2010). (Brentano, 1973; Husserl, 2001; Jacob, 2010)\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 187 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nM: What human acts can make something good or bad, right or wrong? (Q6)\nThere are two anti-realist answers to this question: If John takes the position of metaphysical\ndecisionism in metaethics, he believes that human decisions can \u201ccreate\u201d moral goods and values. If\nJohn assumes metaphysical emotivism in metaethics, he believes that human emotions bring values into\nexistence. However, he should also be clear about whose decisions or feelings can create moral values.\nFor Mary can ask:\nM: Whose acts can make something morally good or valuable? (Q7)\nJohn can make some optional assumptions to answer her questions. For example, individual\nmetaphysical subjectivists in metaethics maintain that each agent \u201ccreates\u201d his/her goods and values.\nFor example, Jean-Paul Sartre presents this position. In his opinion, each decides his/her hierarchy of\ngoods by his/her decisions, which are existential commitments.\nTheories of group subjectivism present the assumption that a group of people \u201ccreates\u201d values,\nby implicit or explicit consensus about them. In this case, John should convince Mary that there is a\nconsensus of our society to respect property rights and she should respect the consensus.\nAccording to the assumption of universal subjectivism, respecting moral values is the\npreconditions for rational actions. For example, Immanuel Kant presents a peculiar combination of\nmetaphysical antirealism and universalism in metaethics. (Harrison, 1967b, p. 87; Tatarkiewicz, 1919, p.\n22).\nTherefore, to answer the Question 1 in the context of metaphysical subjectivism in metaethics,\nJohn can say that:\nJ: You should not lie, because lying is not compatible with your existential commitment\n(individual metaphysical subjectivism). (In this case, Mary can agree or say that she has no\nexistential commitment to respecting human dignity and she sees no incompatibility between\nlying and respecting persons at least in some situations.)\nM: Why should I respect persons, if it is not my existential commitment? Why should not I lie,\nwhen the truth is more harmful to a person than a lie? (Q8)\nJ: You should respect the consensus of our society, which requires you not to lie (group\nmetaphysical subjectivism). (Mary can see no reasons to respect the consensus of her group.)\nM: Why should I respect the consensus of my group? (Q9)\nJ: Truthfulness is the prerequisite for rational intentions. You should be rational, therefore, you\nshould not lie (universal metaphysical subjectivism). (Mary may see no reason to believe that\nlying contradicts rational decisions.)\nM: Why is truthfulness the condition for rational decisions? (Q10)\nTo answer these questions of Mary, John can offer a couple of assumptions concerning sources of\nmoral knowledge and criteria of moral assessments. We discuss his possible answers in the two\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 188 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nfollowing sections.\nIf and how can we get knowledge about moral goods and values? Sources of moral knowledge.\nEpistemological realism versus subjectivism (anti-realism) in metaethics\nIf John takes the position of metaphysical realism in metaethics, he can offer several answers to\nQuestion 9 by indicating natural or supernatural sources of moral knowledge. The natural source of\nknowledge can be the reason (the position of epistemological rationalism) or emotions (the position of\nepistemological emotivism). For example, Plato, Aristotle, and Immanuel Kant maintain that human\nreason can allow us to know moral goods and values. According to Max Scheler, emotions mediate\nhuman knowledge about moral goods values. Supernatural knowledge is the effect of illumination or\nrevelation. For example, St. Augustine maintains that moral knowledge is the gift of God \u2013 the effect of\nHis illumination (Stump & Kretzmann, 2001).\nEthical intuitionism presents a peculiar answer to the Question 9: \u201cOne of the most distinctive\nfeatures of Ethical intuitionism is its epistemology. All of the classic intuitionists maintained that basic\nmoral propositions are self-evident\u2014that is, evident in and of themselves\u2014and so can be known\nwithout the need of any argument.\u201d (Stratton-Lake, 2016)\nThe above answers present the position of epistemological realism in metaethics. According to\nthis standpoint, humans can get knowledge about moral goods and values. The opposite assumption is\nepistemological subjectivism (antirealism) in metaethics. According to this standpoint, a human\ncannot know moral goods and values. He/she can only maintain opinions or beliefs about them.\nIf John takes the position of epistemological subjectivism, he can specify it according to his\nanswers and Mary can repeat questions 8-10 endlessly. The position of epistemological subjectivism is\nconductive to faulty circular reasoning of (Lat.) circulus vitiosus or (Lat.) regressus at infinitum. To\ncontinue the discussion the interlocutors should agree on some criteria of moral assessment. To do it,\nthey should decide if they take the position of normative anti-relativism or relativism in metaethics.\nWhat are the criteria of moral assessment? Normative relativism versus anti-relativism in\nmetaethics\nThe assumption of metaphysical anti-relativism (absolutism) is opposite to metaphysical relativism.\nThese assumptions are about relations between the human mind and moral goods (values) and can have\ndifferent meanings depending on the relationships they indicate. In this chapter, we consider only\nnormative anti-relativism and relativism, which are assumptions about the validity of moral norms.5\nNormative anti-relativists maintain that the validity or truth of moral judgments does not depend\non any opinions, decisions or feelings. To specify this position, John can indicate some sources of moral\nknowledge according to some assumptions of ethical epistemological realism.\nAccording to the assumption of normative anti-relativism in metaethics, some moral norms\nare valid regardless of personal preferences. According to the premise of normative relativism, moral\nnorms and assessments are valid because someone maintains them. Normative relativists believe that\nhuman acts (decisions or emotions) specify the criteria of moral assessments: \u201cMoral relativism is the\nview that moral judgments are true or false only relative to some particular standpoint (for instance, that\n5 We do not consider metaphysical theories (which can get the name of relativism) that show how goods or values exist in\nrelation to human acts. We focus on the normative version of anti-relativism and relativism.\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 189 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nof a culture or a historical period) and that no standpoint is uniquely privileged over all others\u201d\n(Westacott, 2012).\nConsequently, an ethical relativist denies that there is any one correct moral evaluation and\nhe/she holds that there is no rational way of justifying one moral evaluation against another (Brandt,\n1967, p. 75). This standpoint implies that conflicting moral judgments may be equally and\nsimultaneously valid (true, right, sound). (Beauchamp, 2009; Brandt, 1967, p. 67; Campbell, 2015)\nTo justify ethical relativism, its proponents point to the fundamental disagreement between\npeople about criteria of moral assessments. Relativists explain this disagreement by assuming that\n\u201cmoral claims contain an essential indexical element, such that the truth of any such claim requires\nrelativisation to some individual or group\u201d (Joyce, 2015).\nMetaphysical relativism in metaethics can be more or less radical regarding applicability of\nmoral norms. The position can account to ethical particularism or generalism in metaethics:\nEthical relativists can take the position of either ethical particularism or generalism:\nMoral particularism at its most trenchant, is the claim that there are no defensible moral\nprinciples, that moral thought does not consist in the application of moral principles to\ncases, and that the morally perfect person should not be conceived as the person of\nprinciple ... Ethical generalism is the view that the rationality of moral thought and\njudgement depends on a suitable provision of moral principles. (Dancy, 2013).\nTherefore, if John maintains the position of particularism, he does not mean that lying is wrong\nin all possible situations. He should try to convince Mary that lying is wrong in a particular situation.\nFor example, he can take the position of act utilitarianism to show that lying is wrong when it has bad\nconsequences. If he takes the position of generalism he will try to convince her not to do it in all\nsituations. For example, he can take the position of rule utilitarianism to convince Mary, that the norm of\ntruthfulness is more socially useful than the rule of lying. However, he needs to present some evidence\nfor this argument. To do this, he has to make use of some sources of moral knowledge, which implies\nthe position of epistemological realism in metaethics.\nAccording to ethical relativists, human acts (like emotions or decisions) specify criteria of moral\nassessment. Theories of ethical relativism differ regarding the question Whose and what acts specify\ncriteria of moral evaluation? For example, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz (1919, p. 22) notes that ethical\nrelativist theories differ in their claims concerning whose opinions, decisions or feelings count for the\nvalidity of moral criteria. According to individual ethical relativism \u201cIf someone thinks it is right\n(wrong) to do A, then it is right (wrong) for him to do A.\u201d (Brandt, 1967, p. 76). Group (sociological)\nethical relativism is \u201ca metaethical thesis that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not\nabsolute, but relative to some group of persons\u201d (Gowans, 2012). It implies that:\nIf the moral principles recognized in the society of which X is a member imply that it is\nwrong to do A in certain circumstances C then it is wrong for X to do A in C. This\nprinciple says, in effect, that a person ought to act in conformity with the moral standards\nof his group. (Brandt, 1967, p. 76)\nUniversal ethical relativists assume that some moral principles and norms outline necessary (a\npriori) relations that occur between a person and her acts; these relations imply some intersubjective\ncriteria of moral assessment. For example, Kant shows that the categorical imperative outlines the\n30 Other Moral Theories: Subjectivism, Relativism, Emotivism, Intuitionism, etc.\nJan Franciszek Jacko 190 INTRODUCTION TO ETHICS\nuniversal (a priori) prerequisites for rational decisions. (Gowans, 2012; Hill, 2007; Tatarkiewicz, 1919,\np. 22; Westacott, 2012).\nRelativistic theories differ in their answer to the question What kind of human acts specify\ncriteria of moral assessment? Emotivist relativists believe that emotions do it. Decisionist relativists\nmaintain that human decisions specify criteria for moral evaluations.\nBibliography\n\u2022 Beauchamp, T. L. (2009).
