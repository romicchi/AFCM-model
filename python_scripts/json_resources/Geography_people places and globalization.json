{"text":"Chapter 1: Introduction to the World\nGeography\nThe discipline of geography bridges the social sciences with the physical sciences and can provide a framework\nfor understanding our world. By studying geography, we can begin to understand the relationships and common\nfactors that tie our human community together. The world is undergoing globalization on a massive scale as\na result of the rapid transfer of information and technology and the growth of modes of transportation and\ncommunication. The more we understand our world, the better prepared we will be to address the issues that\nconfront our future. There are many approaches to studying world geography. This textbook takes a regional\napproach and focuses on themes that illustrate the globalization process, which in turn assists us in better\nunderstanding our global community and its current affairs.\nGeography helps us make sense of the world through four historical traditions:\n1. Spatial analysis of natural and human cultures\n2. Earth science\n3. Area studies\n4. Human-landscape interactions\nSpatial analysis includes many of the concepts tied to geographic information science (GIS): the analysis of\nthe interactions and distribution of many types of information using computer databases. The GIS data are\nentered into computer programs that convert location indicators to points or features on a map. Earth science\nincludes the study of landforms, climates, and the distribution of plants and animals. Area or regional studies\nfocuses on a particular region to understand the dynamics of a specific interaction between human activity and\nthe environment. Researchers studying human-landscape interaction examine the impact of humans on their\nlandscape and find out how different cultures have used and changed their environments. Geography provides the\ntools to integrate knowledge from many disciplines into a usable form by providing a sense of place to natural or\nhuman events. You will find that geography often explains why or how something occurs in a specific location.\nWorld geography utilizes the spatial approach to help understand the components of our global community.\n1 1.1 Geography Basics\nLearning Objectives\n1. Understand the focus of geography and the two main branches of the discipline.\n2. Learn about the tools geographers use to study the earth\u2019s surface.\n3. Summarize the grid system of latitude and longitude and how it relates to seasons and time zones.\n4. Distinguish between the different types of regional distinctions recognized in geography.\n5. Understand the spatial nature of geography and how each place or region is examined, analyzed, and\ncompared with other places or regions.\n6. Determine the basic geographic realms and their locations.\nWhat Is Geography?\nGeography is the spatial study of the earth\u2019s surface (from the Greek geo, which means \u201cEarth,\u201d and graphein,\nwhich means \u201cto write\u201d). Geographers study the earth\u2019s physical characteristics, its inhabitants and cultures,\nphenomena such as climate, and the earth\u2019s place within the universe. Geography examines the spatial\nrelationships between all physical and cultural phenomena in the world. Geographers also look at how the earth,\nits climate, and its landscapes are changing due to cultural intervention.\nThe first known use of the word geography was by Eratosthenes of Cyrene (modern-day Libya in North Africa),\nan early Greek scholar who lived between 276 and 194 BCE. He devised one of the first systems of longitude\nand latitude and calculated the earth\u2019s circumference. Additionally, he created one of the first maps of the world\nbased on the available knowledge of the time. Around the same time, many ancient cultures in China, southern\nAsia, Polynesia, and the Arabian Peninsula also developed maps and navigation systems used in geography and\ncartography.\nThe discipline of geography can be broken down into two main areas of focus: physical geography and human\n2 3 World Regional Geography\ngeography. These two main areas are similar in that they both use a spatial perspective, and they both include the\nstudy of place and the comparison of one place with another.\nPhysical geography is the spatial study of natural phenomena that make up the environment, such as rivers,\nmountains, landforms, weather, climate, soils, plants, and any other physical aspects of the earth\u2019s surface.\nPhysical geography focuses on geography as a form of earth science. It tends to emphasize the main physical\nparts of the earth\u2014the lithosphere (surface layer), the atmosphere (air), the hydrosphere (water), and the biosphere\n(living organisms)\u2014and the relationships between these parts.\nThe major forms of study within physical geography include the following:\n\u2022 Geomorphology (the study of the earth\u2019s surface features)\n\u2022 Glaciology (the study of glaciers)\n\u2022 Coastal geography (the study of the coastal regions)\n\u2022 Climatology (the study of climates and climate change)\n\u2022 Biogeography (the study of the geographic patterns of species distribution)\nSome physical geographers study the earth\u2019s place in the solar system. Others are environmental geographers,\npart of an emerging field that studies the spatial aspects and cultural perceptions of the natural environment.\nEnvironmental geography requires an understanding of both physical and human geography, as well as an\nunderstanding of how humans conceptualize their environment and the physical landscape.\nPhysical landscape is the term used to describe the natural terrain at any one place on the planet. The natural\nforces of erosion, weather, tectonic plate action, and water have formed the earth\u2019s physical features. Many\nUS state and national parks attempt to preserve unique physical landscapes for the public to enjoy, such as\nYellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon.\nHuman geography is the study of human activity and its relationship to the earth\u2019s surface. Human geographers\nexamine the spatial distribution of human populations, religions, languages, ethnicities, political systems,\neconomics, urban dynamics, and other components of human activity. They study patterns of interaction between\nhuman cultures and various environments and focus on the causes and consequences of human settlement and\ndistribution over the landscape. While the economic and cultural aspects of humanity are primary focuses of\nhuman geography, these aspects cannot be understood without describing the landscape on which economic and\ncultural activities take place.\nThe cultural landscape is the term used to describe those parts of the earth\u2019s surface that have been altered\nor created by humans. For example, the urban cultural landscape of a city may include buildings, streets,\nsigns, parking lots, or vehicles, while the rural cultural landscape may include fields, orchards, fences, barns,\nor farmsteads. Cultural forces unique to a given place\u2014such as religion, language, ethnicity, customs, or\nheritage\u2014influence the cultural landscape of that place at a given time. The colors, sizes, and shapes of the\ncultural landscape usually symbolize some level of significance regarding societal norms. Spatial dynamics assist\nin identifying and evaluating cultural differences between places.\nTraditionally, the field of cartography, or map making, has been a vital discipline for geographers. While 1.1 Geography Basics 4\ncartography continues to be an extremely important part of geography, geographers also look at spatial (space)\nand temporal (time) relationships between many types of data, including physical landscape types, economies,\nand human activity. Geography also examines the relationships between and the processes of humans and\ntheir physical and cultural environments. Because maps are powerful graphic tools that allow us to illustrate\nrelationships and processes at work in the world, cartography and geographic information systems have become\nimportant in modern sciences. Maps are the most common method of illustrating different spatial qualities, and\ngeographers create and use maps to communicate spatial data about the earth\u2019s surface.\nGeospatial techniques are tools used by geographers to illustrate, manage, and manipulate spatial data.\nCartography is the art and science of making maps, which illustrate data in a spatial form and are invaluable in\nunderstanding what is going on at a given place at a given time.\nMaking maps and verifying a location have become more exact with the development of the global positioning\nsystem (GPS). A GPS unit can receive signals from orbiting satellites and calculate an exact location in latitude\nand longitude, which is helpful for determining where one is located on the earth or for verifying a point on a\nmap. GPS units are standard equipment for many transportation systems and have found their way into products\nsuch as cell phones, handheld computers, fish finders, and other mobile equipment. GPS technology is widely\nimplemented in the transport of people, goods, and services around the world.\nRemote sensing technology acquires data about the earth\u2019s surface through aerial photographs taken from\nairplanes or images created from satellites orbiting the earth. Remotely sensed images allow geographers to\nidentify, understand, or explain a particular landscape or determine the land use of a place. These images can\nserve as important components in the cartographic (map-making) process. These technologies provide the means\nto examine and analyze changes on the earth\u2019s surface caused by natural or human forces. Google Earth is an\nexcellent example of a computer tool that illustrates remotely sensed images of locations on the earth.\nFigure 1.1 Low Elevation Air Photo of Cultural Landscape in Morehead, Kentucky 5 World Regional Geography\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nGeographic information science (GIS), often referred to as geographic information systems, uses a computer\nprogram to assimilate and manage many layers of map data, which then provide specific information about a\ngiven place. GIS data are usually in digital form and arranged in layers. The GIS computer program can sort 1.1 Geography Basics 6\nor analyze layers of data to illustrate a specific feature or activity. GIS programs are used in a wide range of\napplications, from determining the habitat range of a particular species of bird to mapping the hometowns of\nuniversity students.\nFigure 1.2 Illustration of Layers in a GIS Process\nGIS specialists often create and analyze geographical information for government agencies or private businesses.\nThey use computer programs to take raw data to develop the information these organizations need for making vital\ndecisions. For example, in business applications, GIS can be used to determine a favorable location for a retail\nstore based on the analysis of spatial data layers such as population distribution, highway or street arrangements,\nand the locations of similar stores or competitive establishments. GIS can integrate a number of maps into one to\nhelp analysts understand a place in relation to their own specific needs.\nGIS also focuses on storing information about the earth (both cultural and natural) in computer databases that\ncan be retrieved and displayed in the form of specialized maps for specific purposes or analyses. GIS specialists\nrequire knowledge about computer and database systems. Over the last two decades, GIS has revolutionized the\nfield of cartography: nearly all cartography is now done with the assistance of GIS software. Additionally, analysis\nof various cultural and natural phenomena through the use of GIS software and specialized maps is an important\npart of urban planning and other social and physical sciences. GIS can also refer to techniques used to represent,\nanalyze, and predict spatial relationships between different phenomena.\nGeography is a much broader field than many people realize. Most people think of area studies as the whole of\ngeography. In reality, geography is the study of the earth, including how human activity has changed it. Geography\ninvolves studies that are much broader than simply understanding the shape of the earth\u2019s landforms. Physical\ngeography involves all the planet\u2019s physical systems. Human geography incorporates studies of human culture,\nspatial relationships, interactions between humans and the environment, and many other areas of research that 7 World Regional Geography\ninvolve the different subspecialties of geography. Students interested in a career in geography would be well\nserved to learn geospatial techniques and gain skills and experience in GIS and remote sensing, as they are the\nareas within geography where employment opportunities have grown the most over the past few decades.\nThe Earth and Graticule Location\nWhen identifying a region or location on the earth, the first step is to understand its relative and absolute locations.\nRelative location is the location on the earth\u2019s surface with reference to other places, taking into consideration\nfeatures such as transportation access or terrain. Relative location helps one compare the advantages of one\nlocation with those of another. Absolute location, on the other hand, refers to an exact point on the earth\u2019s surface\nwithout regard to how that point is related to any other place. Absolute location is vital to the cartographic process\nand to human activities that require an agreed-upon method of identifying a place or point.\nJust as you were taught in geometry that there are 360 degrees in a circle or a sphere, the earth also has 360\ndegrees, and they are measured using a grid pattern called the graticule. Lines of latitude and longitude allow any\nabsolute location on the earth to have an identifiable address of degrees north or south and east or west, which\nallows geographers to accurately locate, measure, and study spatial activity.\nGeographers and cartographers organize locations on the earth using a series of imaginary lines that encircle the\nglobe. The two primary lines are the equator and the prime meridian. From these lines, the systems of longitude\nand latitude are formed, allowing you to locate yourself anywhere on the planet. The line is the longest when you\ntravel along in an east-west direction. At the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes,\nwhich occur in March and September. 1.1 Geography Basics 8\nFigure 1.3 Basic Lines of Longitude and Latitude 9 World Regional Geography\nParallels or Lines of Latitude\nFigure 1.4 Noted Lines of Latitude\nThe equator is the largest circle of latitude on Earth. The equator divides the earth into the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres and is called 0 degrees latitude. The other lines of latitude are numbered from 0 to 90 degrees going\ntoward each of the poles. The lines north of the equator toward the North Pole are north latitude, and each of the\nnumbers is followed by the letter \u201cN.\u201d The lines south of the equator toward the South Pole are south latitude,\nand each of the numbers is followed by the letter \u201cS.\u201d The equator (0 latitude) is the only line of latitude without\nany letter following the number. Notice that all lines of latitude are parallel to the equator (they are often called\nparallels) and that the North Pole equals 90 degrees N and the South Pole equals 90 degrees S. Noted parallels\ninclude both the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which are 23.5 degrees from the equator. At 66.5\ndegrees from the equator are the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle near the North and South Pole, respectively. 1.1 Geography Basics 10\nMeridians or Lines of Longitude\nThe prime meridian sits at 0 degrees longitude and divides the earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.\nThe prime meridian is defined as an imaginary line that runs through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich,\nEngland, a suburb of London. The Eastern Hemisphere includes the continents of Europe, Asia, and Australia,\nwhile the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America. All meridians (lines of longitude) east of the\nprime meridian (0 and 180) are numbered from 1 to 180 degrees east (E); the lines west of the prime meridian (0\nand 180) are numbered from 1 to 180 degrees west (W). The 0 and 180 lines do not have a letter attached to them.\nThe meridian at 180 degrees is called the International Date Line. The International Date Line (180 degrees\nlongitude) is opposite the prime meridian and indicates the start of each day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). Each day\nofficially starts at 12:01 a.m., at the International Date Line. Do not confuse the International Date Line with the\nprime meridian (0 longitude). The actual International Date Line does not follow the 180-degree meridian exactly.\nA number of alterations have been made to the International Date Line to accommodate political agreements to\ninclude an island or country on one side of the line or another.\nClimate and Latitude\nThe earth is tilted on its axis 23.5 degrees. As it rotates around the sun, the tilt of the earth\u2019s axis provides different\nclimatic seasons because of the variations in the angle of direct sunlight on the planet. Places receiving more direct\nsunlight experience a warmer climate. Elsewhere, the increased angle of incoming solar radiation near the earth\u2019s\npoles results in more reflected sunlight and thus a cooler climate. The Northern Hemisphere experiences winter\nwhen sunlight is reflected off the earth\u2019s surface and less of the sun\u2019s energy is absorbed because of a sharper\nangle from the sun.\nThe Tropic of Cancer is the parallel at 23.5 degrees north of the equator, which is the most northerly place on\nEarth, receiving direct sunlight during the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer. Remember that the earth is tilted 23.5\ndegrees, which accounts for seasonal variations in climate. The Tropic of Capricorn is the parallel at 23.5 degrees\nsouth of the equator and is the most southerly location on Earth, receiving direct sunlight during the Southern\nHemisphere\u2019s summer.\nThe tropics (Cancer and Capricorn) are the two imaginary lines directly above which the sun shines on the two\nsolstices, which occur on or near June 20 or 21 (summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere) and December 21 11 World Regional Geography\nor 22 (winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere). The sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer at noon on\nJune 20 or 21, marking the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn at noon on December 21 or 22, marking\nthe beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nSolstices are the extreme ends of the seasons, when the line of direct sunlight is either the farthest north or the\nfarthest south that it ever goes. The region between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn is known as the tropics.\nThis area does not experience dramatic seasonal changes because the amount of direct sunlight received does not\nvary widely. The higher latitudes (north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn) experience\nsignificant seasonal variation in climate.\nFigure 1.5 Road Sign South of Dakhla, Western Sahara (Claimed by Morocco), Marking the Tropic of Cancer\nThis sign was placed in this desert location by the Budapest-Bamako rally participants. The non-English portion is in Hungarian because of the European participants in the race. 1.1 Geography Basics 12\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Arctic Circle is a line of latitude at 66.5 degrees north. It is the farthest point north that receives sunlight\nduring its winter season (90 N \u2212 23.5 = 66.5 N). During winter, the North Pole is away from the sun and\ndoes not receive much sunlight. At times, it is dark for most of the twenty-four-hour day. During the Northern\nHemisphere\u2019s summer, the North Pole faces more toward the sun and may receive sunlight for longer portions of\nthe twenty-four-hour day. The Antarctic Circle is the corresponding line of latitude at 66.5 degrees south. It is the\nfarthest location south that receives sunlight during the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere (90 S \u2212 23.5 =\n66.5 S). When it is winter in the north, it is summer in the south.\nThe Arctic and Antarctic Circles mark the extremities (southern and northern, respectively) of the polar day\n(twenty-four-hour sunlit day) and the polar night (twenty-four-hour sunless night). North of the Arctic Circle, the\nsun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year and below the horizon for twenty-\nfour continuous hours at least once per year. This is true also near the Antarctic Circle, but it occurs south of the\nAntarctic Circle, toward the South Pole. Equinoxes, when the line of direct sunlight hits the equator and days and\nnights are of equal length, occur in the spring and fall on or around March 20 or 21 and September 22 or 23.\nFigure 1.6 Graphic of the Four Seasons 13 World Regional Geography\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nTime Zones\nUniversal Time (UT), Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu Time (Z): all\nfour terms can be defined as local time at 0 degrees longitude, which is the prime meridian (location of Greenwich,\nEngland). This is the same time under which many military operations, international radio broadcasts, and air\ntraffic control systems operate worldwide. UTC is set in zero- to twenty-four-hour time periods, as opposed to two\ntwelve-hour time periods (a.m. and p.m.). The designations of a.m. and p.m. are relative to the central meridian:\na.m. refers to ante meridiem, or \u201cbefore noon,\u201d and p.m. refers to post meridiem, or \u201cafter noon.\u201d UT, UTC, GMT,\nand Z all refer to the same twenty-four-hour time system that assists in unifying a common time in regard to global\noperations. For example, all air flights use the twenty-four-hour time system so the pilots can coordinate flights\nacross time zones and around the world.\nThe earth rotates on its axis once every twenty-four hours at the rate of 15 degrees per hour (15 \u00d7 24 = 360). Time 1.1 Geography Basics 14\nzones are established roughly every 15 degrees longitude so that local times correspond to similar hours of day\nand night. With this system, the sun is generally overhead at noon in every time zone that follows the 15-degree-\nwide system. The continental United States has four main time zones (see Table 1.1 \u201cFour Main Time Zones in\nthe Continental United States and Their Central Meridians\u201d and Figure 1.7 \u201cMajor Time Zones of the World\u201d).\nTable 1.1 Four Main Time Zones in the Continental United States and Their Central Meridians\nUSA Time Zones Central Meridian\nEastern standard time zone 75 degrees W\nCentral standard time zone 90 degrees W\nMountain standard time zone 105 degrees W\nPacific standard time zone 120 degrees W\nFigure 1.7 Major Time Zones of the World 15 World Regional Geography\nThe twenty-four times zones are based on the prime meridian in regard to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu Time (Z), which all operate on the twenty-four-hour time clock. Local\ntime zones are either plus or minus determined by the distance from the prime meridian.\nFigure 1.8 Diagram Illustrating the Width of a Time Zone 1.1 Geography Basics 16\nIn this diagram, 75 W is the central meridian for the eastern standard time zone in the United States.\nThe eastern standard time zone is five hours earlier than the time at the prime meridian (UTC) because it is about\n75 degrees west of 0 degrees (5 \u00d7 15 = 75). For example, if it is noon in London, then it is 7 a.m. in New York.\nIf it is 1 p.m. in New York, it is 10 a.m. in San Francisco, which is three times zones to the west. Since there are\ntwenty-four hours in a day, there are twenty-four time zones on Earth. Each time zone is 15 degrees wide.\nA problem with the 15-degree time zones is that the zones do not necessarily follow state, regional, or local\nboundaries. The result is that time zones are seldom exactly 15 degrees wide and usually have varied boundary\nlines. In the United States, the boundaries between the different time zones are inconsistent with the lines of\nlongitude; in some cases, time zones zigzag to follow state lines or to keep cities within a single time zone. Other\ncountries address the problem differently. China, for example, is as large in land area as the United States yet\noperates on only one time zone for the entire country. 17 World Regional Geography\nRegions in Geography\nA region is a basic unit of study in geography\u2014a unit of space characterized by a feature such as a common\ngovernment, language, political situation, or landform. A region can be a formal country governed by political\nboundaries, such as France or Canada; a region can be defined by a landform, such as the drainage basin of\nall the water that flows into the Mississippi River; and a region can even be defined by the area served by a\nshopping mall. Cultural regions can be defined by similarities in human activities, traditions, or cultural attributes.\nGeographers use the regional unit to map features of particular interest, and data can be compared between regions\nto help understand trends, identify patterns, or assist in explaining a particular phenomenon.\nRegions are traditionally defined by internal characteristics that provide a sense of place. Their boundaries vary\nwith the type of region, whether it is formal, functional, or vernacular; each type has its own meaning and defined\npurpose. A formal region has a governmental, administrative, or political boundary and can have political as well\nas geographic boundaries that are not open to dispute or debate. Formal boundaries can separate states, provinces,\nor countries from one another. Physical regions can be included within formal boundaries, such as the Rocky\nMountains or New England. An official boundary, such as the boundary of a national park, can be considered a\nformal boundary. School districts, cities, and county governments have formal boundaries.\nNatural physical geographic features have a huge influence on where political boundaries of formal regions are\nset. If you look at a world map, you will recognize that many political boundaries are natural features, such as\nrivers, mountain ranges, and large lakes. For example, between the United States and Mexico, the Rio Grande\nmakes up a portion of the border. Likewise, between Canada and the United States, a major part of the eastern\nborder is along the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes. Alpine mountain ranges in Europe create borders,\nsuch as the boundary between Switzerland and Italy.\nWhile geographic features can serve as convenient formal borders, political disputes will often flare up in adjacent\nareas, particularly if valuable natural or cultural resources are found within the geographic features. Oil drilling\nnear the coast of a sovereign country, for example, can cause a dispute between countries about which one has\ndominion over the oil resources. The exploitation of offshore fisheries can also be disputed. A Neolithic mummy\nof a man who died in 3300 BCE caused tension between Italy and Switzerland: the body was originally taken to\nInnsbruck, Switzerland, but when it was determined that the body was found about 90 meters (180 feet) inside the\nborder of Italy, Italian officials laid claim to the body.\nFunctional regions have boundaries related to a practical function within a given area. When the function of an\narea ends, the functional region ends and its boundaries cease to exist. For example, a functional region can be\ndefined by a newspaper service or delivery area. If the newspaper goes bankrupt, the functional region no longer\nexists. Church parishes, shopping malls, and business service areas are other examples of functional regions. They\nfunction to serve a region and may have established boundaries for limits of the area to which they will provide\nservice. An example of a common service area\u2014that is, a functional region\u2014is the region to which a local pizza\nshop will deliver.\nVernacular regions have loosely defined boundaries based on people\u2019s perceptions or thoughts. Vernacular\nregions can be fluid\u2014that is, different people may have different opinions about the limits of the regions.\nVernacular regions include concepts such as the region called the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d Many people have a rough idea 1.1 Geography Basics 18\nof the Middle East\u2019s location but do not know precisely which countries make up the Middle East. Also, in the\nUnited States, the terms Midwest or South have many variations. Each individual might have a different idea\nabout the location of the boundaries of the South or the Midwest. Whether the state of Kentucky belongs in the\nMidwest or in the South might be a matter of individual perception. Similarly, various regions of the United States\nhave been referred to as the Rust Belt, Sun Belt, or Bible Belt without a clear definition of their boundaries. The\nlimit of a vernacular area is more a matter of perception than of any formally agreed-upon criteria. Nevertheless,\nmost people would recognize the general area being discussed when using one of the vernacular terms in a\nconversation.\nUsing a State as a Comparison Guide\nIn comparing one formal political region with another, it is often helpful to use a familiar country, state, province, or\npolitical unit as a reference or guide. Wherever you are located, you can research the statistical data for a formal region\nfamiliar to you to provide a common reference. The US state of Kentucky is one example that can be used to compare\nformal political regions. Kentucky ranks close to the middle range of the fifty US states in terms of its population of 4.3\nmillion people. Kentucky is also within the median range of the fifty states in overall physical area. The state\u2019s\n40,409-square-mile physical area ranks it thirty-seventh in size in the United States. Kentucky is not as large in physical\narea as the western states but is larger in physical area than many of the eastern states. Kentucky includes part of the\nrural peripheral region of Appalachia, but the state also has cosmopolitan core urban centers such as Lexington and\nLouisville. Kentucky also borders the metropolitan city of Cincinnati. The rural peripheral regions of the state are home\nto agriculture and mining. The urban core areas are home to industry and service centers. Other US states could also be\nused as examples. Identifying a state\u2019s geographical attributes provides readers both in and outside the United States\nwith a comparison indicator for geographic purposes. 19 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.9\nThe state of Kentucky can be used as a comparison guide for understanding other formal political regions around the\nworld. 1.1 Geography Basics 20\nWorld Regional Geography\nWorld regional geography studies various world regions as they compare with the rest of the world. Factors for\ncomparison include both the physical and the cultural landscape. The main questions are, Who lives there? What\nare their lives like? What do they do for a living? Physical factors of significance can include location, climate\ntype, and terrain. Human factors include cultural traditions, ethnicity, language, religion, economics, and politics.\nWorld regional geography focuses on regions of various sizes across the earth\u2019s landscape and aspires to\nunderstand the unique character of regions in terms of their natural and cultural attributes. Spatial studies can\nplay an important role in regional geography. The scientific approach can focus on the distribution of cultural and\nnatural phenomena within regions as delimited by various natural and cultural factors. The focus is on the spatial\nrelationships within any field of study, such as regional economics, resource management, regional planning, and\nlandscape ecology.\nAgain, this textbook takes a regional approach with a focus on themes that illustrate the globalization process,\nwhich in turn helps us better understand our global community. The regions studied in world regional geography\ncan be combined into larger portions called realms. Realms are large areas of the planet, usually with multiple\nregions, that share the same general geographic location. Regions are cohesive areas within each realm. The\nfollowing eleven realms are outlined in this text:\n1. Europe (Eastern Europe and Western Europe)\n2. The Russian Realm (Russian republic of the former Soviet Union)\n3. North America (United States and Canada)\n4. Middle America (Caribbean, Mexico, Central America)\n5. South America\n6. North Africa, the Middle East and central Asia\n7. Subsaharan Africa (Africa south of the Sahara Desert)\n8. Southern Asia (India and its neighbors)\n9. Eastern Asia (China, Mongolia, Japan, and the Koreas)\n10. Southeast Asia (mainland region and the islands region)\n11. Australia and the Pacific (including New Zealand) 21 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.10 Major World Realms\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Geography is the spatial study of the earth\u2019s surface. The discipline of geography bridges the social sciences\nwith the physical sciences. The two main branches of geography include physical geography and human\ngeography. GIS, GPS, and remote sensing are tools that geographers use to study the spatial nature of\nphysical and human landscapes.\n\u2022 A grid system called the graticule divides the earth by lines of latitude and longitude that allow for the\nidentification of absolute location on the earth\u2019s surface through geometric coordinates measured in degrees.\nThere are twenty-four time zones that are set at 15-degree intervals each and organize time intervals around\nthe world.\n\u2022 The tilt of the earth\u2019s axis at 23.5 degrees helps create the earth\u2019s seasonal transitions by either absorbing or\nreflecting the sun\u2019s energy. The line of direct sunlight always hits the earth between 23.5 degrees north\n(Tropic of Cancer) and 23.5 degrees south (Tropic of Capricorn), depending on the time of year.\n\u2022 A region is the basic unit of study in geography. Three main types of boundaries define a region: formal,\nfunctional, and vernacular. World regional geography is the study of a particular group of world regions or\nrealms as each compares with the rest of the world.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nClimate and Human Habitation\nThe earth\u2019s ability to receive and absorb sunlight is a primary factor in the earth\u2019s environment, and it also has\na big impact on human populations. There are no large cities or human communities in Antarctica because it is\nso cold; most of the sunlight filtering down to Antarctica is reflected off the earth at that latitude because of the\ntilt of the earth\u2019s axis and the resulting angle of incoming solar radiation. Answering the basic questions of where\nmost humans live on Earth and why they live there depends on understanding climate. Moderate type C climates\nusually provide the greatest opportunities for human habitation.\nSince the region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn receives the most direct sunlight\nthroughout the year, it is favorable to plant and animal life, provided there is adequate moisture or precipitation.\nHumans have been living in the tropics for a long time, even when the ice sheets were covering parts of the\nmidlatitudes. The problem with the tropics is that the soils are usually of poor quality and the nutrients have been 25 World Regional Geography\nleached out. Today, when we look at the earth and the distribution of human population, two main factors attract\nhuman habitation: moderate climates and access to water.\nMore than 70 percent of the earth\u2019s surface is covered with water. The only problem is that less than 3 percent\nof the water is fresh, and most of that fresh water is stored in ice caps at the North or South Pole. This leaves\nless than 1 percent of the world\u2019s fresh water for human use, usually in lakes, rivers, streams, or groundwater and\nunderground aquifers. Climate plays an important role in where humans live because precipitation is necessary\nfor growing crops, raising livestock, and supplying fresh water to urban communities.\nSeveral geographers have developed categories to identify climate types. Climate can be defined as a long-term\naverage weather pattern evident in a particular region of the world. Weather is a term usually used to define\nconditions on a short-term or even daily basis. The two main elements in climate conditions are temperature and\nprecipitation. For the purposes of this overview of world geography, the various climate types have been broken\ndown into six basic types\u2014A, B, C, D, E, and H\u2014after the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification system. Type H climates\nare actually a subset of the type E climate category.\n\u2022 Type A: Tropical or equatorial climates\n\u2022 Type B: Dry or arid climates\n\u2022 Type C: Moderate or temperate climates\n\u2022 Type D: Cold or continental climates\n\u2022 Type E: Polar or extreme climates\n\u2022 Type H: (Unclassified) highland climates\nFigure 1.12 Basic Climate Regions Based on the\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger Classification System (Local Conditions\nMay Vary Widely) 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 26\nType A: Tropical or Equatorial Climates 27 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.13\nTropical type A climates experience warm temperatures year round and a higher annual\nrainfall, such as this location in coastal Belize.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe humid tropical type A climate, usually found in the tropics, has warm temperatures year round with a high\nlevel of precipitation, typically in the form of rain. Type A climates have various subgroups that indicate how\nvariably the rainfall is distributed throughout the year. Some type A climates produce a dry season and a wet\nseason (monsoon), while others receive consistent rainfall throughout the year.\nType B: Dry or Arid Climates\nThe dry type B climate is exemplified by the earth\u2019s desert regions. Temperatures can be extreme, with little\nprecipitation. Type B climate regions experience low rainfall and high temperatures during the day and cooler\ntemperatures at night or during the winter season. Terrain in type B climates can range from sand deserts to prairie\ngrasslands or steppes. Type B climates have fewer trees than most other climate areas.\nThere is a direct relationship between highlands and type B climates in various places in the world. This climate\ncondition, known as the rain shadow effect, or more accurately, the precipitation shadow effect, occurs when one 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 28\nside of a mountain range receives abundant rainfall while the region on the other side of the mountain range is\na desert or has more arid climate conditions. This phenomenon is evident wherever there is terrain with enough\nelevation to restrict the movement of precipitation-bearing clouds.\nFigure 1.14 Rain Shadow Effect\nRain shadows are created when prevailing winds carrying moisture rise quickly in elevation up a mountainside,\nwhere the air cools and condenses to precipitate out its moisture in the form of rain or snow. By the time the air\nmass hits the top of the mountain, its moisture is much reduced. The dried air rushes down the other side of the\nmountain range, where it increases in temperature. The warm, dry air coming off the mountains continues to pull\nmoisture out of the land, resulting in desert or arid climate conditions. 29 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.15\nDry or arid type B climates such as central Arizona have fewer trees than other climates. The saguaro cactus can withstand long periods with little precipitation.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe Hawaiian island of Kauai has an extreme example of the rain shadow effect. The island\u2019s windward side\nreceives more rain than almost any other place on Earth: as much as 460 inches (almost 40 feet) a year. Only a\npart of the island, however, receives that amount of rain. The height of the mountains causes a rain shadow on the\ndry leeward side, creating semidesert conditions and type B climates.\nDeath Valley in California is also a result of the rain shadow effect. Little rain falls on Death Valley because any\nmoisture in the prevailing winds falls on the western side of the bordering mountain ranges. The whole state of\nNevada is dry because of the rain shadow effect. All the rain coming off the Pacific Ocean falls on the coastal\nmountains and the Sierra Nevada in California. The mountains are high enough to shadow that region of Nevada,\nand the basin and ranges further the rain shadow effect on a local basis.\nOn the other side of the earth, the Himalayas are an excellent example of mountains that create the rain shadow\neffect. Most of western China has type B climates because of the rain shadow effect caused by high mountains\nthat stop rain clouds from ever reaching the region. The southern side of the Himalayas receives extensive rainfall\nbecause of monsoon rains arriving from the Indian Ocean, but western China is essentially a desert. It is sparsely\ninhabited compared with the high-density regions in China Proper to the east, where rainfall is plentiful. 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 30\nType C: Moderate or Temperate Climates\nFigure 1.16\nModerate type C climates are good for agriculture. For example, in Appalachia, tobacco and hardwood forests grow well.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nOften described as moderate in temperature and precipitation, type C climates are the most favorable to human\nhabitation in that they host the largest human population densities on the planet. Type C climates are found mostly\nin the midlatitudes bordering the tropics. Seasonal changes are pronounced, with a distinct winters and summers. 31 World Regional Geography\nWinters are cool to cold and summers are usually warm. Precipitation varies from low to high, depending on\nlocation. In the United States, C climates dominate the southeast and the West Coast.\nType C climates are not the most widespread on the planet, but they have attracted the largest human populations.\nOne reason for the attraction has been the abundance of forests, farmland, and fresh water found in type C regions.\nThe main population centers of the planet are in type C climates. With over seven billion people on the planet and\ngrowing, humans have populated most of the regions with type C climates and are now filling up the other areas\nthat have A, B, or D climate types.\nType D: Cold or Continental Climates\nFigure 1.17 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 32\nColder type D climates are prominent in states such as North Dakota, which has the coldest annual winter temperatures of the\ncontinental forty-eight states.\nGeof Wilson \u2013 Welcome to North Dakota \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nType D climate regions are often found in the interiors of continents away from the moderating influence of large\nbodies of water. They are often farther north than type C regions, resulting in colder winters. Seasonal variations\nexist, with cool to hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is usually in the form of rain in summer and snow\nin winter. Regions with type D climates can be found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, much of\nCanada, and a large portion of Russia.\nType E: Polar or Extreme Climates\nType E is an extreme climate type found in the polar regions near or to the north of the Arctic Circle and near or\nto the south of the Antarctic Circle. Regions with type E climates are cold with permanent ice or permafrost year\nround. Vegetation is minimal, and there are no trees. Temperatures may warm slightly during the short summer\nmonths but rarely rise above 50 degrees. 33 World Regional Geography\nType H: Highland Climates\nType H highland climates are usually listed as a subcategory of type E climates. Mountain ranges can create a\nvariety of climate types because of the change in elevation from the base of the range to the summit. Different\nclimate types can be found on the same mountain at different elevations. Type H climates designate highlands\nor mountain terrain. Variations in climate exist on most mountain ranges. Climates at the base of mountains will\nvary depending on whether the mountains are found in the tropics or in the higher latitudes. For example, high\nmountains near the equator may have a type A climate at their base and a type E climate at their summit with\nvarious type C and type D climates between them. Type H climates are found where elevation differences are\nprofound enough to provide different climate zones. Higher elevation relief can reach above the tree line and have\npermanent snow cover at the summit. The term relief is used in geography to indicate elevations of a land surface.\nElevation zones with permanent ice or snow can resemble a type E polar climate.\nDeforestation\nThe planet\u2019s growing population has increased demands on natural resources, including forest products. Humans\nhave been using trees for firewood, building homes, and making tools for millennia. Trees are a renewable\nresource, but deforestation occurs when they are removed faster than they can be replenished. Most people in\nrural areas in developing countries rely on firewood to cook their food. Many of these areas are experiencing a\nfast decline in the number of trees available. People living in mainly type B climates may not have access to a\nlot of trees to start with; therefore, when trees are cut down for firewood or for building materials, deforestation\noccurs. In the tropical areas, it is common for hardwood trees to be cut down for lumber to gain income or to clear\nthe land for other agricultural purposes, such as cattle ranching. Countries that lack opportunities and advantages\nlook to exploit their natural resources\u2014in this case, trees\u2014for either subsistence agriculture or economic gain.\nDeforestation has increased across the globe with the rapid rise in worldwide population.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, European countries chopped down their forests at a rapid rate. Much of the\nBritish Isles was forested at one point, but today few forests remain on the British Isles, and they are typically\nprotected. Colonialism brought the Europeans to the Americas. The United States, in its early development,\npushed west from the original thirteen colonies, and many old growth forests were cut down in the process. As\nrailroad tracks were laid down and pioneer development pushed west into the Great Plains, where there were few\ntrees, the great cutover occurred in the eastern and central forests\u2014cutover is a term indicating the systematic 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 34\ndeforestation of the eastern and central forests. Michigan and Wisconsin saw their trees removed in a systematic\ndeforestation.\nFigure 1.18\nForests are removed for timber, and burning the excess then clears the land for other purposes.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nSome areas were allowed to grow back, but many other areas were turned into farmland. Few old-growth forests\nremain in the United States. Today there are conflicts over how the timber industry is handling the forests in places\nsuch as the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.\nCountries that are better off economically no longer have to cut down their own trees but can afford to substitute\nother resources or import lumber from other places. Developing regions of the world in Latin America, Africa,\nand parts of Asia are experiencing serious problems with deforestation. Deforestation is widespread: Residents of\nHaiti have cut down about 99 percent of the country\u2019s forests; most of the wood has been used as fuel to cook 35 World Regional Geography\nfood. People in Afghanistan have cut down about 70 percent of their forests. Nigeria has lost about 80 percent of\nits old-growth forests since 1990. Ethiopia has lost up to 98 percent of its forested acreage, and the Philippines\nhas lost about 80 percent of its forests.\nBrazil\u2019s Amazon basin has undergone many projects that have driven deforestation. For example, about half the\nstate of Rond\u00f4nia in western Brazil has been deforested since 1990. The countries of Central America have lost\nabout half their original forests, and deforestation continues on a systematic basis. Tropical regions of Southeast\nAsia and Africa are being exploited for their timber at unsustainable rates, causing deforestation that the next\ngeneration will have to deal with. India, with over a billion people, still has a high demand for firewood and\nbuilding materials; their forests are declining faster than they can be replanted. China, with its billion plus\npopulation, has been attempting to address its deforestation problems by implementing a massive replanting\nprogram and conservation measures. Other countries are starting to adopt similar measures.\nFigure 1.19\nA man in Malawi carries firewood for cooking and heating purposes. 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 36\nDavid Stanley \u2013 Girls Carrying Firewood \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nTropical rain forests only make up about 5 percent of the earth\u2019s surface but contain up to 50 percent of the earth\u2019s\nbiodiversity. These forests are cut down for a variety of reasons. Norman Meyers, a British environmentalist,\nestimated that about 5 percent of deforestation in tropical regions is caused by the push for cattle production.\nNineteen percent of these forests are cut down by the timber industry, 22 percent are cut down for the expansion\nof plantation agriculture, and 54 percent are removed due to slash-and-burn farming. Most tropical rain forests\nare located in the Amazon basin of South America, in central Africa, and in Southeast Asia. All these areas are\nlooking for advantages and opportunities to boost their economies; unfortunately, they often target their tropical\nrain forests as a revenue source.\nWhat Are the Problems with Deforestation?\nDeforestation causes more than the loss of trees for fuel, building materials, paper products, or manufacturing.\nAnother related issue in the deforestation equation is soil erosion. Without the trees to hold the soil during heavy\nrains, soils are eroded away, leaving the ground in an unproductive state. In tropical areas, soils are often degraded\nand lack nutrients. Most of the nutrients in the tropical areas rest in decaying material at the base of the trees\nthat supplies energy back into the ecosystem. Once the trees are removed, there is little replenishing of this\nenergy supply. Soil erosion in tropical areas makes it hard for forests to grow back once they have been removed.\nLandslides can be a more severe component of the soil erosion problem. After heavy rainfall, entire hillsides\nsaturated with water can slide downward, causing serious structural damage to buildings, homes, and agricultural\nplots. Tree roots help hold hillsides together and therefore help prevent landslides.\nForests play an important role in the water cycle. Trees pull up moisture with their roots from the soil and transpire\nit through their leaves back into the atmosphere. Moisture in the atmosphere collects into clouds, condenses, and\nfalls back to Earth. Not only do trees store water, but organic matter at the base of the trees also stores water and\nmakes it available to the larger ecosystem, which may slow down water runoff. Forest canopies disperse water\nduring rainfall and create another layer of moisture in their leaves and branches, which either is used by other\norganisms or evaporates back into the atmosphere. Deforestation eliminates the role that forests play in the water\ncycle.\nForest ecosystems provide for a diverse community of organisms. Tropical rain forests are one of the most vibrant\necosystems on the planet. Their abundant biodiversity can provide insight into untapped solutions for the future. 37 World Regional Geography\nPlants and organisms in these habitats may hold the key to medical or biological breakthroughs, but wildlife\nand vegetation will be lost as deforestation eliminates their habitat and accelerates the extinction of endangered\nspecies.\nFigure 1.20 Lumber Mill Processing Hardwood Timber\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nTrees and plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the plant structure through the\nprocess of photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that is a part of the climate change process.\nCarbon dioxide and other similar gases reduce the amount of long-wave radiation (heat) that escapes from the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere, resulting in increased temperatures on the planet. As more carbon dioxide is emitted into\nthe atmosphere, climate change occurs. The removal of trees through deforestation results in less carbon dioxide\nbeing removed from the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. Slash-and-burn farming methods that\nburn forests release the carbon in the plant life directly into the atmosphere, increasing the climate change effect. 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 38\nClimate Change\nClimate change has been a constant activity in the planet\u2019s evolution. The increase in temperature in our\nenvironment is the activity that has gained the most attention in recent years. Questions have been raised about\nthe rate and extent of climate change around the world. Understanding the dynamics of the temperature increase\ncan assist in understanding how it is related to human activity.\nThe atmosphere is the gaseous layer that surrounds the earth and marks the transition between its surface and\nspace. The atmosphere consists of a mixture of gases, composed of nitrogen (77 percent), oxygen (21 percent),\nand minor elements (1 percent) including argon, helium, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The small amount of\ncarbon dioxide is a critical component in the control of the earth\u2019s temperature. The atmosphere extends over three\nhundred miles above the earth\u2019s surface, and the lower level makes up the earth\u2019s climatic system. This lowest\nlevel is called the troposphere and is responsible for the conditions that allow life to exist on the planet\u2019s surface.\nSince the 1960s, scientists have been concerned about the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\noxide, and chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. These so-called greenhouse gases can trap heat energy emitted\nfrom the earth\u2019s surface and may increase global temperatures and cause climate change. Since the Industrial\nRevolution, human activity\u2014the burning of fossil fuels and large-scale deforestation\u2014has increased the amount\nof heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and similar gases act like the glass panels\nof a greenhouse that allow shortwave radiation from the sun to enter but do not allow the long-wave radiation of\nheat to escape into space.\nAn increase in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will normally cause an increase in the\ntemperature of the planet\u2019s climate, which in turn may cause changes in weather conditions in various places\non Earth. Temperature changes may affect precipitation patterns and alter weather patterns, which may affect\nagricultural outputs and influence energy needs that can create increasing economic instability. Changes in climate\nalso impact environmental conditions for organisms adapted to specific habitat ranges. When climates change, an\norganism\u2019s habitable zone may also change, which in turn can impact entire ecosystems.\nDeforestation and the burning of fossil fuels can contribute to climate change. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and\nnatural gas are created when dead plant and animal life are under pressure, decay for long periods, and retain\ntheir carbon component. Burning fossil fuels releases the carbon back into the atmosphere. The increasing need\nfor energy and lumber by human activity will continue to contribute to climate change unless alternatives can be\nfound. The increase in temperatures may result in the melting of the ice caps, which in turn may raise sea levels,\nimpacting human activity around the world. More information about climate change is included in chapter 13 on\nAntarctica. 39 World Regional Geography\nTectonic Plates\nThe movement of tectonic plates is another aspect of the earth\u2019s dynamics that affects human activity. The earth\u2019s\ncrust, which is between 10 and 125 miles thick, is not one big solid chunk but rather a series of plates that cover a\nmolten iron core at the center of the planet. The plates that cover the earth\u2019s surface slowly shift and move. Plates\ncan slide away from each other or they can collide, and they can slide parallel to each other in opposite directions.\nWhen two plates collide and one plate slides under an adjacent plate, the process is called subduction. Movement\nor shift where two plates meet can cause earthquakes and is usually associated with volcanic activity.\nFigure 1.21 General Pattern of Tectonic Plates 1.2 The Environment and Human Activity 40\nImage courtesy of USGS.\nMountain chains, such as the Himalayas, are a direct result of two plates colliding. The collision pushes up the\nearth into a mountain chain, either by direct pressure or by volcanic activity. Plates can move up to an inch a year\nin active regions. Driven by the earth\u2019s internal heat, these plates have created the planet\u2019s mountain landscapes.\nEarthquakes and volcanic action along plate boundaries (called faults) continue to affect human activity and\ncan cause serious economic damage to a community. Plate boundaries can be found near many natural edges\nof continents. The continuous action of the plates causes serious earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that can\ndevastate human activities. Earthquakes near the sea often trigger tsunamis that can create enormous waves that\nbring destruction to coastal regions in their path. The earthquake off the east coast of Japan in 2011 created a\ntsunami that brought additional destruction to nuclear energy facilities, exposing parts of Japan and the rest of the\nworld to radiation.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Human activity on the planet correlates with the type of climate and terrain that presents itself to humans in\nthe form of natural resources or habitability. Six basic climate zones (A, B, C, D, E, and H) describe the\nearth\u2019s climate types. Temperature and precipitation are the two main variables that create a climate zone\nand its corresponding environmental attributes.\n\u2022 The earth\u2019s crust consists of a number of separate plates that move, creating earthquakes and volcanic\nactivity. Most mountain ranges on Earth are a product of tectonic plate activity.\n\u2022 Removing trees faster than they can grow back is called deforestation. Humans are cutting down the forests\nin many areas at an unsustainable rate. Deforestation can result in soil erosion, changes in weather patterns,\nand the loss of habitats. Trees are being cut down for firewood, building materials, or profit.\n\u2022 Mountains or high elevation relief can restrict the passage of rain clouds and cause the clouds to lose their\nprecipitation as the air mass increases in elevation. The other side of the mountain or range does not receive\nany precipitation and is reduced to a more arid or drier region, creating desert conditions.\n\u2022 Climate change is a phenomenon whereby gases such as carbon dioxide and methane increase in the\ntroposphere and restrict long-wave radiation from escaping the planet, which can result in warmer\ntemperatures on Earth. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which may reduce climate\nchange.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What climate type do you live in?\n2.

Understand the concept of carrying capacity as it relates to the\nplanet\u2019s human population.\n2. Outline the relationship between urbanization and family size. Show how rural-to-urban shift relates to\nindustrialization and the change in rural populations.\n3.

Distinguish between the concepts of culture and ethnicity as these terms are used in this textbook.\n5. Understand the difficulty in determining the number of languages and religions existing on Earth. Name the\nmain language families and the world\u2019s major religions.\nDemographic Transition\nDemography is the study of how human populations change over time and space. It is a branch of human\ngeography related to population geography, which is the examination of the spatial distribution of human\npopulations. Geographers study how populations grow and migrate, how people are distributed around the world,\nand how these distributions change over time.\nFor most of human history, relatively few people lived on Earth, and world population grew slowly. Only about\nfive hundred million people lived on the entire planet in 1650 (that\u2019s less than half India\u2019s population in 2000).\nThings changed dramatically during Europe\u2019s Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and into the 1800s, when\ndeclining death rates due to improved nutrition and sanitation allowed more people to survive to adulthood and\nreproduce. The population of Europe grew rapidly. However, by the middle of the twentieth century, birth rates\nin developed countries declined, as children had become an economic liability rather than an economic asset to\nfamilies. Fewer families worked in agriculture, more families lived in urban areas, and women delayed the age of\n42 43 World Regional Geography\nmarriage to pursue education, resulting in a decline in family size and a slowing of population growth. In some\ncountries (e.g., Russia and Japan), population is actually in decline, and the average age in developed countries\nhas been rising for decades. The process just described is called the demographic transition.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the world\u2019s population was about 1.6 billion. One hundred years later,\nthere were roughly six billion people in the world, and as of 2011, the number was approaching seven billion. This\nrapid growth occurred as the demographic transition spread from developed countries to the rest of the world.\nDuring the twentieth century, death rates due to disease and malnutrition decreased in nearly every corner of the\nglobe. In developing countries with agricultural societies, however, birth rates remained high. Low death rates\nand high birth rates resulted in rapid population growth. Meanwhile, birth rates\u2014and family size\u2014have also been\ndeclining in most developing countries as people leave agricultural professions and move to urban areas. This\nmeans that population growth rates\u2014while still higher in the developing world than in the developed world\u2014are\ndeclining. Although the exact figures are unknown, demographers expect the world\u2019s population to stabilize by\n2100 and then decline somewhat.\nIn 2010, the world\u2019s population was growing by about eighty million per year, a growth rate found almost\nexclusively in developing countries, as populations are stable or in decline in places such as Europe and North\nAmerica. World population increase is pronounced on the continent of Asia: China and India are the most\npopulous countries in the world, each with more than a billion people, and Pakistan is an emerging population\ngiant with a high rate of population growth. The continent of Africa has the highest fertility rates in the world,\nwith countries such as Nigeria\u2014Africa\u2019s most populous and the world\u2019s eighth most populous country\u2014growing\nrapidly each year. The most striking paradox within population studies is that while there has been marked decline\nin fertility (a declining family size) in developing countries, the world\u2019s population will grow substantially by\n2030 because of the compounding effect of the large number of people already in the world\u2014that is, even though\npopulation growth rates are in decline in many countries, the population is still growing. A small growth rate on a\nlarge base population still results in the birth of many millions of people.\nEarth\u2019s human population is growing at the rate of about 1.4 percent per year. If the current growth rate continues,\nthe human population will double in about fifty years to more than twelve billion. The current population increase\nremains at about eighty million per year. A change in the growth rate will change the doubling time. Between\n2010 and 2050, world population growth will be generated exclusively in developing countries.\nThe three largest population clusters in the world are the regions of eastern China, south Asia, and Europe.\nSoutheast Asia also has large population clusters. Additional large population centers exist in various countries\nwith high urbanization. An example is the urbanized region between Boston and Washington, DC, which includes\nNew York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and neighboring metropolitan areas, resulting in a region often called a\nmegalopolis. The coastal country of Nigeria in West Africa or the island of Java in Indonesia are good examples\nof large population clusters centered in the tropics.\nSocial dynamics and geography will determine where the new additions to the human family will live. Providing\nfood, energy, and materials for these additional humans will tax many countries of the world, and poverty,\nmalnutrition, and disease are expected to increase in regions with poor sanitation, limited clean water, and lack of\neconomic resources. In 2010, more than two billion people (one-third of the planet\u2019s population) lived in abject\npoverty and earned less than the equivalent of two US dollars per day. The carrying capacity of the planet is not 1.3 Population and Culture 44\nand cannot be known. How many humans can the earth sustain in an indefinite manner? There is the possibility\nthat we have already reached the threshold of its carrying capacity.\nFigure 1.22 Population Growth from Year 1 to Year 2010 AD\nHuman population will continue to grow until it either crashes due to the depletion of resources or stabilizes at a\nsustainable carrying capacity. Population growth exacts a toll on the earth as more people use more environmental\nresources. The areas most immediately affected by increased populations include forests (a fuel resource and a\nsource of building material), fresh water supplies, and agricultural soils. These systems get overtaxed, and their\ndepletion has serious consequences. Type C climates, which are moderate and temperate, are usually the most\nproductive and are already vulnerable to serious deforestation, water pollution, and soil erosion. Maintaining\nadequate food supplies will be critical to supporting a sustainable carrying capacity. The ability to transport\nfood supplies quickly and safely is a major component of the ability to manage the conservation of resources.\nDeforestation by humans using wood for cooking fuel is already a serious concern in the arid and dry type B\nclimates. 45 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.23\nThe three main human population clusters on the planet are eastern Asia, southern Asia, and Europe. Most\nof these regions with high population densities are in type C climates.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nUrbanization and Family Size\nAs countries move from an agricultural to an industrial economy, there is a major shift in population from rural to\nurban settings. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century ushered in major technological developments\nand changes in labor practices, which encouraged migration from the farm to the city. Because of increased\nmechanization, fewer farm workers are needed to produce larger agricultural yields. At the same time, factories\nin urban areas have a great need for industrial workers. This shift continued into the information age of the late\ntwentieth century and continues in many parts of the developing world in the current century. 1.3 Population and Culture 46\nFigure 1.24 Rural-to-Urban Shift\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nA basic principle of population growth that addresses this rural-to-urban shift states that as countries industrialize\nand urbanize, family size typically decreases and incomes traditionally increase. Though this may not be true in\nall cases, it is a general principle that is consistent across cultural lines. Agricultural regions generally have a\nlarger average family size than that of their city counterparts. Fertility rate is the average number of children a\nwoman in a particular country has in her lifetime, whether or not they all live to adulthood. If a fertility rate for\na given country is less than 2.1\u2014the replacement level\u2014the population of that country is in decline, unless there\nis significant immigration. A fertility rate greater than 2.1 indicates that the country\u2019s population is increasing.\nSome children will never reach reproductive age nor have children of their own, so the replacement rate has to be\nslightly greater than 2. The concept of fertility rate is slightly different from the term family size, which indicates\nthe number of living children raised by a parent or parents in the same household. In this textbook, family size is\nused to illustrate the concept of population growth and decline. 47 World Regional Geography\nPopulation Demands\nA country\u2019s demographic statistics can be illustrated graphically by a population pyramid. A population pyramid\nis essentially two bar graphs that depict male and female age cohorts either in absolute size or as a percentage of\nthe total population. Male cohorts are typically shown on the left side of the pyramid, and females are on the right\nside.\nThe shape of a country\u2019s population pyramid tells a story about the history of its population growth. For example,\na high-growth-rate country has a pyramid that is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, showing that every\nyear more children have been born than the year before. As family size decreases and women in a society have\nfewer children, the shape of the pyramid changes. A population pyramid for a postindustrialized country that has\nnegative growth would be narrower at the bottom than in the middle, indicating that there are fewer children than\nmiddle-aged people. Four basic shapes indicate the general trends in population growth:\n1. Rapidly expanding\n2. Expanding\n3. Stationary\n4. Contracting\nThese shapes also illustrate the percentage of a population under the age of fifteen or over the age of sixty-five,\nwhich are standard indicators of population growth. Many postindustrial countries have a negative population\ngrowth rate. Their population pyramids are narrow at the bottom, indicating an urbanized population with small\nfamily sizes.\nFigure 1.25 Population Pyramids 1.3 Population and Culture 48\nAngola had a fertility rate of 5.6 in 2011. Japan had a fertility rate of 1.4 in 2011.\nData courtesy of US Census Bureau International Programs.\nCulture and Ethnicity\nThe term culture is often difficult to differentiate from the term ethnicity. In this textbook, ethnicity indicates\ntraits people are born with, including genetic backgrounds, physical features, or birthplaces. People have little\nchoice in matters of ethnicity. The term culture indicates what people learn after they are born, including language,\nreligion, and customs or traditions. Individuals can change matters of culture by individual choice after they are\nborn. These two terms help us identify human patterns and understand a country\u2019s driving forces.\nThe terms culture and ethnicity might also be confused in the issue of ethnic cleansing, which refers to the forced\nremoval of a people from their homeland by a stronger force of a different people. Ethnic cleansing might truly\nindicate two distinct ethnic groups: one driving the other out of their homeland and taking it over. On the other\nhand, ethnic cleansing might also be technically cultural cleansing if both the aggressor and the group driven 49 World Regional Geography\nout are of the same ethnic stock but hold different cultural values, such as religion or language. The term ethnic\ncleansing has been used to describe either case.\nFigure 1.26 Major Language Families of the World 1.3 Population and Culture 50\nLanguages of the World\nLanguage is the communication mode of human culture, and it represents the complete diversity of thought,\nliterature, and the arts. All the billions of people on the planet speak at least one language. While Ethnologue,\na publication pertaining to the world\u2019s languages, estimates that there were 6,909 living languages in the world\nas of 2009, the exact number may never be determined. Other data sets count languages differently, but most\nagree that there are more than 6,000. There are even communities in various parts of the world where people can\ncommunicate by whistling messages to each other or by using clicking sounds.\nOf the more than 6,000 languages, about a dozen are spoken by more than one hundred million people each.\nThese are the world\u2019s main languages used in the most populous countries. However, the vast majority of the\nworld\u2019s languages are spoken by a relatively small number of people. In fact, many languages have no written\nform and are spoken by declining numbers of people. Language experts estimate that up to half the world\u2019s living\nlanguages could be lost by the end of the twenty-first century as a result of globalization. New languages form\nwhen populations live in isolation, and in the current era, as the world\u2019s populations are increasingly interacting\nwith each other, languages are being abandoned and their speakers are switching to more useful tongues.\nThere are nine dominant language families in the world. Each of the languages within a language family shares a\ncommon ancestral language. An example of a language family is the Indo-European family, which has a number\nof branches of language groups that come from the same base: a language called Proto-Indo-European that was\nprobably spoken about six thousand years ago. As populations migrated away from the ancestral homeland,\ntheir language evolved and separated into many new languages. The three largest language groups of the Indo-\nEuropean family used in Europe are the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic groups. Other Indo-European languages\ninclude Hindi (spoken in India) and Persian (spoken in Iran).\nTable 1.2 Languages of the Continents 51 World Regional Geography\nWorld Area Number of Languages Percentage of All Languages\nAfrica 2,110 30.5\nAmericas 993 14.4\nAsia 2,322 33.6\nEurope 234 3.4\nPacific 1,250 18.1\nTotals 6,909 100.0\nSource: M.

(Dallas: SIL International, 2009), accessed September 13, 2011,\nhttp:\/\/www.ethnologue.com.\nLanguage Characteristics\nThe following terms are used to describe language characteristics.\n\u2022 accent. An accent is the pronunciation of words within a language that is different from that used by a\ndifferent group of the same language. For example, people in Mississippi pronounce words differently from\npeople in North Dakota, but the differences are less severe than dialects.\n\u2022 creole. Similar to pidgin, a creole language arises from contact between two other languages and has\nfeatures of both. However, Creole is a pidgin that becomes a primary language spoken by people at home.\nCreole languages are often developed in colonial settings as a dialect of the colonial language (usually\nFrench or English). For example, in the former French colony of Haiti, a French-based creole language was\ndeveloped that is spoken by people at home, while French is typically used for professional purposes.\n\u2022 dead language. A dead language is one that is no longer used for local communication. For example, Latin\nis no longer used by local people to communicate but is still used by the Roman Catholic Church in some of\nits services.\n\u2022 dialect. A dialect is a regional variety of a language that uses different grammar or pronunciation. Examples 1.3 Population and Culture 54\ninclude American English versus British English. Linguists suggest that there are three main dialects of the\nEnglish language in the United States: a Southern dialect, a midland dialect, and a Northern dialect.\nTelevision and public media communication has brought a focus on more uniform speech patterns that have\ndiminished the differences between these three dialects.\n\u2022 isolated language. An isolated language is one not connected to any other language on Earth. For example,\nBasque is not connected to any other language and is only spoken in the region of the Pyrenees between\nSpain and France.\n\u2022 lingua franca. A lingua franca is a second language used for commercial purposes with others outside a\nlanguage group but not used in personal lives. For example, Swahili is used by millions in Africa for doing\nbusiness with people outside their own group but is not used to communicate within local communities.\n\u2022 official language. The official language is the language that is on record by a country to be used for all its\nofficial government purposes. For example, in India the official language is Hindi, though in many places\nthe lingua franca is English and several local languages may be spoken.\n\u2022 pidgin. A pidgin is a simplified, created language used to communicate between two or more groups that do\nnot have a language in common. For example, Residents of New Guinea mix English words with their own\nlanguage to create a new language that can bridge speakers of different local language groups. Though the\nwords are in English, the grammar and sentence structure is mixed up according to local vocabulary. There\nare many English-based pidgin languages around the world.\n\u2022 slang. Slang is the local use of informal words or phrases that are not part of the official language. For\nexample, a lot of musicians use slang in their lyrics.\nReligions of the World\nReligious geography is the study of the distribution of religions and their relationship to their place of origin.\nReligious geographers recognize three main types of religions: universal (or universalizing), ethnic (or cultural),\nand tribal (or traditional) religions. Universal religions include Christianity, Islam, and various forms of\nBuddhism. These religions attempt to gain worldwide acceptance and appeal to all types of people, and they\nactively look for new members, or converts. Ethnic religions appeal to a single ethnic group or culture. These\nreligions do not actively seek out converts. Broader ethnic religions include Judaism, Shintoism, Hinduism, and\nChinese religions that embrace Confucianism and Taoism. Finally, traditional religions involve the belief in some\nform of supernatural power that people can appeal to for help, including ancestor worship and the belief in spirits\nthat live in various aspects of nature, such as trees, mountaintops, and streams (this is often called animism).\nSubsaharan Africa is home to many traditional religions. 55 World Regional Geography\nFigure 1.27 Major Religions of the World and Their Respective Percentage of the World Population\nAlthough the world\u2019s primary religions are listed here, many other religions are practiced around the world, as\nwell as many variations of the religions outlined here. The top four religions by population are Christianity, Islam,\nHinduism, and Buddhism. Because the official doctrine of Communism was nonreligious or atheist, there are\nactually many more followers of Buddhism in China than demographic listings indicate. The percentage of the\nworld\u2019s population that follows Buddhism is probably much higher than the 6 percent often listed for this religion.\n\u2022 Christianity and Islam originated out of Judaism in the eastern Mediterranean and the Arabian\nPeninsula. Both are monotheistic religions that look to the Jewish patriarch Abraham as a founding\npersonage. Christianity, based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived in Palestine in the\nfirst century CE, spread rapidly through the Roman Empire. Islam is based on the teachings of\nMuhammad, a seventh-century religious and political figure who lived on the Arabian Peninsula. Islam\nspread rapidly across North Africa, east across southern Asia, and north to Europe in the centuries after\nMuhammad\u2019s death.\n\u2022 Buddhism is a religion or way of life based on the teachings and life of Siddhartha Gautama, who lived\nin what is now India\/Nepal around the fifth century BCE. There are three main branches of Buddhism:\nsouthern or Theravada Buddhism, eastern or Mahayana Buddhism, and northern or Vajrayana\n(Tibetan) Buddhism.\n\u2022 Hinduism, a religious tradition that originated on the Indian subcontinent, is one of the oldest major 1.3 Population and Culture 56\nreligions still practiced in the world, and it may date back to as far as 2000 BCE or earlier. Unlike\nother world religions, Hinduism has no single founder and is a conglomerate of diverse beliefs and\ntraditions. Hinduism has a large body of scripture, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, and epic tales\nsuch as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.\n\u2022 Sikhism, a religion founded in the Punjab region of southern Asia, is a monotheistic religion centered\non justice and faith. High importance is placed on the principle of equality between all people. The\nwritings of former gurus are the basis for the religion.\n\u2022 Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people, whose traditions and ethics are embodied in the Jewish\nreligious texts, the Tanakh, and the Talmud. According to Jewish tradition, Judaism began with the\ncovenant between God and Abraham around 2000 BCE.\n\u2022 Shintoism is a major ethnic religion of Japan focused on the worship of kami, which are spirits of\nplaces, things, and processes.\n\u2022 Confucianism and Taoism are ethnic Chinese religions based on morality and the teachings of religious\nscholars such as Confucius.\nFigure 1.28 Major Religions of the World\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0. 57 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The human population was approaching seven billion in 2011 and is increasing rapidly, mainly in\ndeveloping regions of Asia and Africa. No one can agree on the earth\u2019s carrying capacity for our human\npopulation, but unless the growth rate changes, the human population will double in about fifty years.\n\u2022 Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been moving from rural areas to urban areas. Workers were\nneeded in the factories and fewer workers were needed on the farms because of improved technology. This\ntrend is still happening in many rural areas of developing countries. Population pyramids are one method of\nillustrating demographic data for a country to show if the population is declining or increasing and at what\nrate.\n\u2022 Though often interchangeable in general terms, for the purpose of geography in this textbook, ethnicity is\nwhat you are born with and culture is what you learn after you are born.\n\u2022 There are about six thousand languages in the world today, with about thirteen of them spoken by over one\nhundred million people or more. Of the main language families, nine include at least 1 percent or more of\nthe human population.\n\u2022 There are thousands of religions or variants of them in the world. Religious geographers recognize three\nmain types of religions: universal, ethnic, and traditional. The four main religions of the world are\nChristianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What is the planet\u2019s current human population?\n2.

Understand the vital roles that labor and resources play in the economic situation for each country.\n5. Comprehend the patterns illustrated in the index of economic development\u2014especially in terms of how it\nillustrates a country\u2019s development status in regard to family size and economic indicators. Learn the\nrelationship between the concepts of rural-to-urban shift, core-periphery spatial relationships, opportunity\nand advantage, and haves and have-nots.\nFigure 1.29 Cultural Landscapes Representing the Urban Core Region of Los Angeles and the Peripheral\nRegions of Rural Montana\n59 1.4 Globalization and Development 60\nThe tall structures shown in Montana are grain elevators used to store grain of local farmers before loading it into railroad\ncars to be shipped to market.\nR. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nGlobalization\nUS President George H. W. Bush gave a speech during his presidency (1988\u201392) indicating the real possibility\nof a New World Order. The speech, given during the Persian Gulf War when Iraq occupied Kuwait, was\nquite surprising to many, and it created questions about what he meant. Geographers and professionals in\nother disciplines understand that the world is not static. Cultural forces continue to act on human activities as\nglobalization creates new alliances and global networks. The goal is to understand globalization and to make sense\nof what is happening. The better we understand the world and human dynamics, the better we will be prepared to\naddress the changes that are occurring. Geography provides a means to spatially examine these changes.\nGlobalization is a process with a long history. People have been exploring, migrating, and trading with each other\nthroughout human history, and these activities have created interactive networks connecting the different parts of\nthe planet and producing dependent economic relationships. In modern times, globalization can be recognized by\nnoting iconic global corporations, such as Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, or Toyota, that trade across international borders\nand integrate labor and resources from different countries to sell a product or service in the global marketplace.\nIn a number of countries, people have protested against the building of new Walmarts or McDonalds\u2019, and such\nprotests exemplify concerns about globalization and the growing expansion of dominant global economic units\ninto local communities. These ubiquitous corporations represent corporate interests that are primarily concerned\nwith company profits. Global corporations tend to view countries or communities as either markets for their\nproducts or sources of labor or raw materials. Globalization can seriously impact local communities for better or\nfor worse, depending on local circumstances. The main force that encourages globalization is economic activity\nbased on technological advancements. Cultural and societal changes often occur as a consequence and are no less\nsignificant.\nPolitical geography examines geography\u2019s influence on political systems and globalization, which are related\nto issues concerning the development of borders and the distribution of government types. One of the most\nsignificant events in political geography was colonialism, which is connected to the development of capitalism.\nEric Wolf, in his book Europe and the People without History, details the expansion of European powers\nthroughout the world to control both human and natural resources as well as expand a country\u2019s world power and 61 World Regional Geography\npromote Christianity. The British parliamentary system of government was exported to various areas of the British\nEmpire. Now the parliamentary system is used throughout the world in former British colonies and throughout\nthe British Commonwealth. Additionally, colonialism helped spread the English language throughout the world,\nfor example, to India and the United States.\nEuropean colonialism was an early wave of globalization that changed the planet and shaped most of the world\u2019s\ncurrent political borders. This early wave of global conquest was fueled by the Industrial Revolution. Colonialism\ntransferred technology, food products, and ideas around the globe in merchant ships that centered on the European\npower bases of the colonial empires of Europe\u2014mainly Britain, Spain, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands.\nWhen the United States became independent of these European colonial powers, it began to extend its power and\ninfluence around the world. Thus the first major wave of globalization was a result of European colonialism.\nFigure 1.30\nEuropean colonialism changed many things. The expansion of European empires was driven by the search for profits\nfrom resources and labor in the acquisition of new lands. European colonialism had a significant impact on people and\ncultures. 1.4 Globalization and Development 62\nThe space race and the information age of the latter portion of the twentieth century initiated a second major\nwave of globalization. The space race was a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to\ndevelop space-related technologies, including satellites, and to land on the moon. The end of the Cold War,\nwith the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, coincided with advancements in computer technology that fueled\nthe second major wave in modern globalization. Technology and corporate activity have stimulated a wave\nof globalization that is impacting the economies of countries around the world. In European colonialism, the\nland and people were physically conquered by the mother country and became colonies ruled by the European\ncolonizer\u2019s government. Great Britain was the most avid colonizer and amassed great fortunes through its\ncolonial possessions. One difference between European colonialism and globalization today is that globally active\nmultinational corporations do not wish to own the country or run the government directly. Corporations are not\nconcerned with what government type is in power or who is running the country as long as they can operate\nand make a profit. This neocolonialism (new colonialism or corporate colonialism), like European colonialism,\ncontinues to exploit natural resources, labor, and markets for economic profits. Its critics claim that corporate\ncolonialism is nothing more than a legal method of pillaging and plundering, and its supporters claim it is the most\nefficient use of labor and resources to supply the world with the lowest-priced products.\nFigure 1.31 63 World Regional Geography\nAfter the turn of the twenty-first century, Walmart became the world\u2019s largest corporation. Its global expansion and economic\nrelationships are good examples of the activities of corporate colonialism.\nWalmart \u2013 Walmart store exterior \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nExamples of corporate colonialism can be seen in the trade relationships between the United States and places\nsuch as Mexico and China. US corporations move their manufacturing plants to Mexico to earn more profits by\nexploiting cheap labor. The corporations do not take over Mexico politically; they exploit it economically. The\nmany US corporations that have started manufacturing their products in China do not attempt to overthrow the\nCommunist Chinese government; they want to exploit the cheap Chinese labor pool and open up markets to sell\nproducts to Chinese consumers. Desire for profits drives corporate colonialism. 1.4 Globalization and Development 64\nOpportunity and Advantage\nConsidering the drive of individuals to increase their opportunities or advantages is one way to understand our\nworld. People who have access to opportunities and advantages can generally achieve a higher standard of living\nthan people without. This can be true for individuals, global corporations, or whole countries. Countries that\nhave an opportunity or an advantage over others can achieve a higher standard of living for their people, and\ncountries without such opportunities or advantages will struggle in a global economy. A country\u2019s opportunities\nand advantages can be determined by various factors, such as the amounts of available natural or human resources,\narable land for farming, forests for timber, and freshwater for fishing or a specific location that provides a greater\naccess to the world markets. Examples of human resources are a large labor pool or a high percentage of educated\nprofessionals. Individuals seek to gain opportunities or advantages by increasing their education, learning new\nskills that can translate into higher earning power, or migrating to a place with improved employment prospects.\nRural-to-urban shift occurs when people move from rural agricultural areas to the cities for employment or in\nsearch of a better life and is an example of a migration pattern based on people seeking greater opportunities or\nadvantages. When people migrate from a poorer country to a postindustrial country, they are seeking opportunities\nor advantages in life. The \u201chave\u201d countries are those with opportunities and advantages; the \u201chave-not\u201d countries\nare those with fewer opportunities and advantages for their people or for their country\u2019s future. Migration patterns\naround the world usually shift people from places without resources to places with resources. These migration\npatterns, which are evident in rural-to-urban shift and periphery-to-core migration, allow individuals to seek a\ngreater opportunities or advantages for the future.\nCore-Periphery Spatial Relationship\nEconomic conditions vary across the globe. There are wealthy countries and there are poor countries, and the\ndetermination of which countries are wealthy and which countries are poor has generally been determined by\nthe availability of economic opportunities and advantages. There are three core areas of wealthy industrialized\ncountries, all of which are found in the Northern Hemisphere: North America, Western Europe, and eastern Asia.\nThe main market centers of these regions are New York City, London, and Tokyo. These three core areas and\ntheir prosperous neighbors make up the centers of economic activity that drive the global economy. Other wealthy\ncountries can be found dispersed in regions with large amounts of natural resources, such as the Middle East, or 65 World Regional Geography\nplaces of strategic location, such as Singapore. The world\u2019s poorer countries make up the peripheral countries. A\nfew countries share qualities of both and may be called semiperipheries.\nThe periphery countries and the core countries each have unique characteristics. Peripheral locations are providers\nof raw materials and agricultural products. In the periphery, more people earn their living in occupations related\nto securing resources: farming, mining, or harvesting forest products. For the workers in these occupations, the\nprofits tend to be marginal with fewer opportunities to advance. In the periphery, there is a condition known as\nbrain drain, which describes a loss of educated or professional individuals. Young people leave the peripheral\nareas for the cities to earn an education or to find more advantageous employment. Few of these individuals return\nto the periphery to share their knowledge or success with their former community.\nBrain drain also happens on an international level\u2014that is, students from periphery countries might go to college\nin core countries, such as the United States or countries in Europe. Many international college graduates do not\nreturn to their poorer countries of origin but instead choose to stay in the core country because of the employment\nopportunities. This is especially true in the medical field. There is little political power in the periphery; centers\nof political power are almost always located in the core areas or at least dominated by the core cities. The core\nareas pull in people, skills, and wealth from the periphery. Lack of opportunities in the periphery pushes people to\nrelocate to the core.\nPower, wealth, and opportunity have traditionally been centered in the core areas of the world. These locations\nare urbanized and industrialized and hold immense economic and political power. Ideas, technology, and cultural\nactivity thrive in these core areas. Political power is held in the hands of movers and shakers who inhabit the core.\nThe core depends on the periphery for raw materials, food, and cheap labor, and the periphery depends on the core\nfor manufactured goods, services, and governmental support.\nFigure 1.32 The Core-Periphery Spatial Relationship 1.4 Globalization and Development 66\nThe core-periphery spatial relationship can be viewed on various levels. On a local level, one can select eastern\nKentucky, with the city of Morehead as an example. Morehead has a population of about ten thousand people and\nis the only significant town in its county. Morehead, with a university, regional hospital and retail services, serves\nas a core hub for the surrounding periphery. The hinterland of Morehead has an economy based on agriculture,\ncoal mining, and timber, which is typical of a peripheral region. The city of Morehead has the political, economic,\nand educational power that serves the people of its local area.\nIf we move up a level, we can understand that entire regions of the United States can be identified as peripheral\nareas: the agricultural Midwest, rural Appalachia, and the mountain ranges and basins of the western United\nStates. The large metropolitan areas of the East and West Coasts and the Industrial Belt act as the core areas. Los\nAngeles and New York City anchor each coast, and cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, and Indianapolis\nrepresent the heartland. All the other large cities in the United States act as core areas for their surrounding\nperipheral hinterlands. Southern cities such as Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, or Phoenix act as core centers of\ncommerce for the South in a region known as the Sun Belt.\nFigure 1.33 Three Core Economic Areas of the World: North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the\nEuropean Union (EU); and the East Asian Community (EAC) 67 World Regional Geography\nEAC is not an \u201cofficial\u201d organization but is a recognized economic group.\nOn a global scale, we can understand why North America, Western Europe, and eastern Asia represent the three\nmain economic core areas of the world. They all possess the most advanced technology and the greatest economic\nresources. Core regions control the corporate markets that energize and fuel global activity. Peripheral regions\ninclude portions of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and all the other places that primarily make their living from local\nresources and support the economic core. These peripheral regions may include key port cities. A semiperiphery\nwould be a transitional area between the core and the periphery, which could include countries such as Russia,\nIndia, or Brazil that are not exactly in the core and not really in the periphery but might have qualities of both.\nWorld migration patterns follow the core-periphery spatial relationship in that people and wealth usually shift\nfrom the peripheral rural regions to the urban core regions. The \u201chave\u201d countries of the world are in the core\nregions, while the \u201chave-not\u201d countries are most likely in the peripheral regions.\nNational Income Methods\nIt is easier to understand why people move from rural to urban, from periphery to core, from Mexico to the\nUnited States when one begins to understand the global economy. Economic conditions are connected to how\ncountries gain national income, opportunities, and advantages. One way of gaining wealth is simply by taking\nsomeone else\u2019s wealth. This method has been common practice throughout human history: a group of armed\nindividuals attacks another group and takes their possessions or resources. This is regularly practiced through\nwarfare. Unfortunately, this pillage-and-plunder type of activity has been a standard way of gaining wealth 1.4 Globalization and Development 68\nthroughout human history. The taking of resources by force or by war is frowned upon today by the global\neconomic community, though it still occurs. The art of piracy, for example, is still practiced on the high seas in\nvarious places around the globe, particularly off the coast of Somalia.\nThe main methods countries use to gain national income are based on sustainable national income models and\nvalue-added principles. The traditional three areas of agriculture, extraction\/mining, and manufacturing are a\nresult of primary and secondary economic activities. Natural resources, agriculture, and manufacturing have been\ntraditionally targeted as the means to gain national income. Postindustrial activities in the service sector would\ninclude tertiary and quaternary economic activities, which make up a large part of a nation\u2019s economy but might\nnot hold the same value-added quotient for national income as the traditional three areas.\nAgriculture is the method of growing crops or trees or raising livestock that provides food and some raw materials.\nThe excess is usually sold for profits. This is a renewable method of gaining wealth, as long as conditions are\nfavorable. Profits for agricultural products might be low because of global competition. Countries with minerals,\noil, or other natural resources can earn income from the extraction and sale of those items. Saudi Arabia and other\ncountries with abundant petroleum reserves can gain wealth by selling that resource to other countries. Since these\nresources are not renewable, once the minerals or oil run out, the country must turn to other activities to gain\nnational income.\nPlaces around the world have sometimes been named after the methods used to gain wealth. For example, the Gold\nCoast of western Africa received its label because of the abundance of gold in the region. The term breadbasket\noften refers to a region with abundant agricultural surpluses. Another example is the Champagne region of France,\nwhich has become synonymous with the beverage made from the grapes grown there. Banana republics earned\ntheir name because their large fruit plantations were the main income source for the large corporations that\noperated them. Places such as Copper Canyon and Silver City are examples of towns, cities, or regions named\nafter the natural resources found there. The United States had its Manufacturing Belt, referring to the region from\nBoston to St. Louis, which was the core industrial region that generated wealth through heavy manufacturing for\nthe greater part of nineteenth and twentieth centuries\nManufacturing has offered the industrialized world the opportunity for the greatest value-added profits. From\nthe beginning of the Industrial Revolution, solid profits have been made by turning raw materials into useable\nproducts that can be mass-produced and sold in high quantities. The core areas of the world have all made\nenormous wealth from manufacturing profits. Today, information technology and high-tech manufactured\nproducts generate substantial wealth. The Microsoft Corporation manufactures information by placing data in the\nform of computer programs on inexpensive disks or in digital files that are then sold at a profit to a world computer\nmarket. The geographic region of California south of San Francisco was labeled Silicon Valley after this type of\ninformation-generating activity.\nFor a country to gain national wealth, income must be brought in from outside the country or be generated from\nwithin. Other than the big-three methods of agriculture, extraction\/mining, and manufacturing, there are additional\nways a country can gain wealth, such as through tourism and services. Postindustrial economic activities (the\nservice sector) contribute to a large percentage of employment opportunities in industrialized countries and\ngenerate a large percentage of their national economies. However, the service sector does not have the high value-\nadded profits traditionally provided by the manufacturing sector. In the gaming industry, for example, casinos do\nnot have a large wealth-generating potential for the country unless they can either attract gamblers from other 69 World Regional Geography\ncountries or provide for other wealth-generating services. Gambling shifts wealth from one person to another and\nprovides little national income. The activity of gambling does, however, generate service jobs for the gaming\nindustry.\nFigure 1.34 Major Methods of Gaining National Income Based on Sustainable National Income Models and Value-Added Principles\nMethods of Gaining National Income\nPillage and Plunder (Unnaceptable)\nDiscouraged by Civilized Nations\n1.

National debt is a major problem for national governments. National income can be\nconsolidated into the hands of a minority of the population at the top of the socioeconomic strata. These social\nelites have the ability to dominate the politics of their countries or regions. The elites may hold most of a\ncountry\u2019s wealth, while at the same time their government might not always have enough revenues to pay for\npublic services. To pay for public services, the government might need to borrow money, which then increases\nthat country\u2019s national debt. The government could have a high national debt even when the country is home\nto a large number of wealthy citizens or a growing economy. Taxes are a standard method for governments to\ncollect revenue. If economic conditions decline, the amount of taxes collected can also decline, which could\nleave the government in a shortfall. Again, the government might borrow money to continue operating and to\nprovide the same level of services. Political corruption and the mismanagement of funds can also cause a country\u2019s\ngovernment to lack revenues to pay for the services it needs to provide its citizens.\nFigure 1.35 Inflationary Banknote from Zimbabwe\u2014Considered the Largest Denomination Banknote Ever\nPrinted for Legal Tender\nR. Berglee \u2013 CC-BY-NC-SA.\nNational debt, defined as the total amount of money a government owes, is a growing concern across the\nglobe. Many governments have problems paying their national debt or even the interest on their national debt.\nGovernments whose debt has surpassed their ability to pay have often inflated their currency to increase the\namount of money in circulation, a practice that can lead to hyperinflation and eventually the collapse of the\ngovernment\u2019s currency, which could have serious negative effects on the country\u2019s economy. In contrast to the 71 World Regional Geography\nnational debt, the term budget deficit refers to the annual cycle of accounting of a government\u2019s excess spending\nover the amount of revenues it takes in during a given fiscal year.\nDevelopment and Demographics\nThe Industrial Revolution, which prompted the shift in population from rural to urban, also encouraged market\neconomies, which have evolved into modern consumer societies. Various theories and models have been\ndeveloped over the years to help explain these changes. For example, in 1929, the American demographer\nWarren Thompson developed the demographic transition model (DTM) to explain population growth based on an\ninterpretation of demographic history. A revised version of Thomson\u2019s model outlines five stages of demographic\ntransition, from traditional rural societies to modern urban societies:\n\u2022 Stage 1: High birth and death rates; rural preindustrial society\n\u2022 Stage 2: Declining death rate; developing country\n\u2022 Stage 3: Declining birth rate; high urbanization rate\n\u2022 Stage 4: Low birth and death rates; stabilized population\n\u2022 Stage 5: Declining population; urban postindustrial society\nFigure 1.36 The Five Stages of the Demographic Transition Model 1.4 Globalization and Development 72\nIn the 1960s, economist Walt Rostow outlined a pattern of economic development that has become one model for\ngrowth in a global economy. Rostow\u2019s model outlined the five stages of growth in the economic modernization of\na country:\n\u2022 Stage 1: Traditional society\n\u2022 Stage 2: Preconditions for take-off\n\u2022 Stage 3: Take-off\n\u2022 Stage 4: Drive to maturity\n\u2022 Stage 5: Age of high mass consumption\nThe human development index (HDI) was developed in 1990 and used by the United Nations Development\nProgram to measure a standard of human development, which refers to the widening opportunities available to\nindividuals for education, health care, income, and employment. The HDI incorporates variables such as standards\nof living, literacy rate, and life expectancy to indicate a measure of well-being or the quality of life for a specific\ncountry. The HDI is used as an indicator of a country\u2019s economic and technological development.\nThe basic principles of Rostow\u2019s DTM and the HDI can be illustrated in a general index for understanding\ndevelopment. Two variables of the DTM\u2019s correlating five stages are family size and economic income, which can\nillustrate the population pattern or development potential. All countries of the world are at one of the five stages.\nThe general index addresses how population growth rates relate to rural-to-urban shift, which has traditionally\nbeen a result of industrialization. By tracking both family size and economic conditions, a pattern of population\ngrowth and economic development can be illustrated and more clearly understood.\nFertility rate is often defined as the number of children born to a woman in her lifetime, regardless of whether\nthey all live to adulthood. Fertility rate may (or may not) vary from family size, which is an indication of the\nnumber of living children raised by a parent or parents in the same household. A high infant mortality rate may\naccount for a fertility rate that is greater than family size. To simplify the understanding, family size is used in this\ntextbook to illustrate economic dynamics. Though the statistical data may vary slightly between the two terms,\nthis should not present any problem in understanding basic patterns of development.\nAs a general trend, when a country experiences increasing levels of industrial activity and greater urban growth,\nthe outcome is usually a higher standard of living for its people. Additionally, rural-to-urban shift takes place,\ndriven by the pull of opportunities and advantages in the industrializing and urbanizing areas. Though there are 73 World Regional Geography\nexceptions, a decrease in family size usually coincides with a higher level of urbanization. There are cases in\nwhich only core regions within a country transition through the five development stages without the peripheral\nregions experiencing the coinciding levels of economic benefit. The five stages of the index of economic\ndevelopment assist in illustrating these general patterns.\nStage 1 indicates traditional rural societies, which are usually based on agriculture and not as dependent on\nthe outside world. Stage 1 families are larger, their income levels are low, and their advantages and economic\ndevelopment opportunities are low. Health care, education, and social services are in short supply or nonexistent.\nHigh birth and death rates maintain a high fertility rate\/family size and a low population-growth status.\nPopulations in stage 1 development have a stationary population pyramid. Though there may be regions of the\nworld that exhibit stage 1 development patterns, few if any entire countries fall into this category as of the year\n2000.\nStage 2 countries experience high population growth rates because family size remains high but modern medicine\nor improved nutrition allows people to live longer, which lowers the death rate. Population is exploding in\ncountries in stage 2. During this stage, young people from rural areas often migrate to the cities looking for\nemployment. Rural stage 2 regions are starting to urbanize and integrate their economic activities with the outside\nworld. Regions in stage 2 often have a surplus of cheap labor. Income levels remain low and family size continues\nto be large. Countries in this stage often have a rapidly expanding population pyramid.\nSocieties that have made business connections that provide for manufacturing of products, industrial activities, or\nan increased service sector might progress to stage 3, the rural-to-urban shift stage. These regions are experiencing\na high rate of rural-to-urban shift in their populations. These regions are often targeted by multinational\ncorporations for their labor supply, and as people migrate from rural areas to the cities looking for employment,\nurban populations grow and core or central cities experience high rates of self-constructed housing (slums).\nIncome levels start to increase and family size starts to drop significantly. Stage 3 countries have an expanding\npopulation pyramid.\nSocieties that have urbanized and industrialized and are members of the global marketplace might enter stage 4.\nMembers of an urban workforce assist in building a networked economy. Family size is lower as urban women\nenter the workforce and have fewer children. Health care, education, and social services become increasingly\navailable, and income levels continue to rise. In stage 4, there is typically a high level of growth in the industrial\nand service sectors with a great need for infrastructure in the form of transportation, housing, and human services.\nCountries in stage 4 development have populations that resemble a stationary population pyramid.\nAs incomes increase and family size decreases, a consumer society emerges, creating stage 5, where high mass\nconsumption can drive the economy. Many countries in stage 5 can eventually experience a negative population\ngrowth rate in which the fertility rate (family size) is below replacement levels (statistically around 2.1 children).\nWith a low number of young people entering the workforce, stage 5 regions become an attractive magnet for\npeople looking for opportunities and advantages in the job market. Illegal immigration might become an issue.\nEurope and the United States are now experiencing this condition. Japan has the same low family size, but because\nof their island location and strict laws, they have a different set of illegal immigration issues compared with\nEurope or the United States. Populations in stage 5 development have a contracting population pyramid. 1.4 Globalization and Development 74\nFigure 1.37 Index of Economic Development\nThe four basic shapes of population pyramids can parallel the various stages of a country\u2019s economic\ndevelopment. Many of the concepts used in this textbook are interrelated. The various methods, models, or\ntheories used in geography are often used by other disciplines as well. Understanding one concept usually assists\nthe reader in learning about the other concepts and how they apply to different geographic locations. In this case,\nthe stages of economic development and the population pyramids illustrate the contrast between rural and urban\nsocieties and the changes in family size during the industrialization process.\nGeography of Opportunity\nHighly industrialized countries in Western Europe, eastern Asia, or North America can offer more economic\nopportunities compared with developing countries. The push-pull factors that push people out of poorer countries\nand pull them to an industrialized country are strong. Portions of the population of countries in the earlier stages\nof the index of economic development often migrate to countries in the latter stages of the index looking for\nwork and other opportunities. This transition has created a dichotomy between people who have opportunities and\nadvantages and those who do not. People who do not have opportunities and advantages often want to move to\nplaces that do have them so they can work to attain greater economic security for themselves and their families.\nThe haves and have-nots are general categories of economic status and not necessarily cultural values. 75 World Regional Geography\nCountries in stage 4 or 5 of the index of economic development are often attractive places for those seeking\ngreater economic opportunities or advantages. Populations in these stages generally have fewer children, so the\ndemand for entry-level workers is often higher. Immigrants with fewer skills take the entry-level jobs to enter the\neconomic workforce. An established country with a long-standing history and culture does not always welcome\nan influx of new immigrants. The arrival of an immigrant labor pool often includes individuals who hold different\ncultural traditions or customs than those of the mainstream society. Social tensions arise if different ethnic groups\nare vying for the same cultural spaces and opportunities. One example is the large number of people entering\nthe United States across its southern border. Europe is experiencing a similar immigration issue, with immigrants\nfrom North Africa, the Middle East, and former colonies. Japan, on the other hand, has taken pride in holding on\nto its ubiquitous Japanese culture but is facing the same employment situation.\nOpportunities in Geography\nThe following information on careers in geography is from the website of the Association of American\nGeographers (AAG), which is a resource for those interested in pursuing employment in the field of geography\n(http:\/\/www.aag.org).\nMany occupations require knowledge of and skills in geography. Geographers work in many different areas, such\nas environmental management, education, disaster response, city and county planning, community development,\nand more. Geography is an interdisciplinary field that offers diverse career opportunities.\nMany geographers pursue rewarding careers in business; local, state, or federal government agencies; nonprofit\norganizations; and schools. Geographers with graduate (master\u2019s and doctorate) degrees may become educators\nin higher education (community colleges and universities).\nUsing information from the US Department of Labor, the AAG has compiled data on a broad list of occupations\nrelated to geography. Using this online career database, you can explore the diverse career opportunities available\nto geographers, as well as retrieve data on salaries, projected growth, demand for key skills, and much more\nto guide your career planning.

This activity is creating a second major wave of globalization, often referred to as\nneocolonialism or corporate colonialism.\n\u2022 The concepts of opportunity and advantage provide a means to understand the attractiveness or\nunattractiveness of a place to immigrants or economic activities. Opportunities and advantages drive rural-\nto-urban shift, migration, and movement of corporate activity.\n\u2022 Core areas are usually urban with high levels of industrial and economic development. Peripheral areas are\ntypically suppliers of food and raw materials used in the core. Political and economic power is held in the\ncore, while the periphery suffers from lower incomes and brain drain.\n\u2022 National income methods are based on standard economic practices and value-added principles. Agricultural\nactivities are renewable, but extractive activities are not. Manufacturing has historically provided the highest\nvalue-added profits and has been the main means of the core economic regions of the world to gain income.\nThe service sector provides a high number of jobs but might not contribute to national income at the same\nlevels as agriculture, extraction activities, or manufacturing.\n\u2022 Development and population models can help one understand a country\u2019s socioeconomic dynamics. Family\nsize and economic income are two indicators that can be tracked to assist in understanding the\nindustrialization or urbanization levels of a country or demographic region.\n\u2022 Globalization has prompted a greater understanding of how opportunities and advantages relate to haves and\nhave-nots. Whether it is individuals or countries, some have greater levels of opportunity and advantage\nthan others. Human migration patterns usually coincide with the push-pull forces of opportunity or\nadvantage levels.\n\u2022 Many of the concepts used to understand the dynamics of a region or place are related. The four main types\nof population pyramids can help illustrate the various stages of a country\u2019s socioeconomic situation as\nillustrated in the index of economic development.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

The dynamic discipline of geography bridges the social\nsciences with the physical sciences. Geography\u2019s spatial nature can be illustrated by the creation of maps as\nan important means of communicating information. Human geography and physical geography are the two\nmain fields of the discipline. GPS, GIS, and remote sensing are tools geographers use to spatially study a\nlocation or the physical or cultural landscape.\n\u2022 Geographers divide the earth into a geometric grid to provide location references to places on its surface.\nHuman activity is orientated around the grid system to provide time zones, navigation, and the organization\nof communication systems. Climate and seasonal changes can be tracked using this grid system of longitude\nand latitude.\n\u2022 Regions are the basic units of geographic study. World geography divides the world into sets of regions\ncalled realms that are used as comparison studies regarding human and physical landscapes and activities.\nClimate regions or zones are helpful in understanding the earth\u2019s environmental conditions. Historically,\nhuman activity has been strongly affected by the variation in climates. Type C climates have generally\nattracted large human populations.\n\u2022 The relationship between the environment and human activity is an important component of geography. The\nmovement of tectonic plates sometimes causes earthquakes and volcanic activity, which affects human\nactivity. The rain shadow effect can also impact where and how humans live. Human activity contributes to\nenvironmental problems such as deforestation, which impacts the environment through the loss of habitats,\nsoil erosion, and possibly climate change.\n\u2022 The human population continues to increase. The earth\u2019s carrying capacity for humans is debatable, but the\nimpact that humans have on the planet is undeniably extensive. Some factors and conditions encourage high\npopulation growth, while others discourage population growth. Migration, rural-to-urban shift, and\nurbanization are related to changes in population. As population increases, the number of languages\ncontinues to decrease\u2014an example of the impact of globalization.\n\u2022 European colonialism created a major wave of globalization that extended up until about the time of World\nWar II. After the Cold War ended, a second wave of globalization was fueled by the information age and the\nintroduction of new communication and transportation technologies. Concepts such as labor and resources,\nopportunity and advantage, or haves and have-nots can help explain the dynamics of globalization.\n\u2022 The core-periphery spatial relationship helps explain how human economic activity is organized around\n78 79 World Regional Geography\neither an urban core or a rural periphery. The methods countries use to gain national income are a means to\nunderstand the ways in which economic activity is categorized and explained. The index of economic\ndevelopment is a model relating to the stages a country may transition through to reach a postindustrial\ndevelopment level. All these concepts, models, and theories are tools used to understand the human\nactivities that are elements of the globalization process. Chapter 2: Europe\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nEurope is a continent of peninsulas, islands, and varied landforms. The traditional boundaries of the European\ncontinent include the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and Russia up to the Ural Mountains to the east.\nSince the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, Russia has been given its own identification and, in this text, is not\nincluded in the study of Europe. Russia will be discussed in Chapter 3. Greenland is located next to the North\nAmerican country of Canada but has traditionally been considered a part of Europe because of Denmark\u2019s colonial\nacquisition of the island. Greenland is physically more a part of North America. The Arctic Ocean creates a\nnatural boundary to the north. The southern boundary of Europe is the Mediterranean Sea and includes the\nislands of Malta and Cyprus as independent countries. A portion of Turkey is in Europe, but Turkey is considered\na part of Asia Minor and is usually included in the study of the Middle East region. The waterway in Turkey\nbetween the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea is the Bosporus, or the Istanbul Strait, which creates a natural border\nbetween Asia and Europe. Europe is also close to North Africa, and Morocco\u2019s coast can be seen across the Strait\nof Gibraltar from Spain.\n80 2.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Describe the various climate types and physical landforms of the European continent.\n2. Explain how Europe\u2019s physical geography has supported its development.\n3. List Europe\u2019s various natural resources.\n4. Summarize the environmental concerns Europe faces.\nFrom the Roman Empire to the European Union (EU), Europe\u2019s historical pattern of development is a model\nstudy in regional geography. From historic empires to diverse nation-states to a multicountry union, the continent\nstruggles to confront the cultural forces that unite and divide it. The powerful impact European colonialism has\nhad on the world since the Industrial Revolution is still felt today. The rural-to-urban shift prompted by the\nIndustrial Revolution first impacted Europe and continues to impact developing countries. Understanding the\ngeographic region of Europe is essential to understanding our world. This short summary of the basic concepts\nwill provide a valuable lesson in globalization, which affects every human being on the planet. The concepts and\nprinciples that apply to Europe can also apply to other countries and regions.\nFigure 2.1 Map of Europe\n81 2.1 Introducing the Realm 82\nUniversity of Texas Libraries 83 World Regional Geography\nLocation and Climate\nEurope is a northern continent. All the British Isles, for example, fall above the fiftieth parallel. If we compare\nEurope\u2019s position on a globe with that of the contiguous United States, we see that much of Europe lies north\nof the United States. Paris, France, is at about the same latitude as Fargo, North Dakota. Athens, Greece, is at\nabout the same latitude as St. Louis, Missouri. Europe\u2019s northern position affects its growing seasons and people\u2019s\nmoods, and it should be taken into consideration as an important influence in the evolution of the European\ncharacter. Europe is also surrounded by bodies of water: the Atlantic Ocean borders Europe on the west, the Arctic\nOcean borders Europe to the north, and many seas surround the various peninsulas and coastal regions.\nThe oceans exert significant influence on the world\u2019s climates. The oceans collect and store vast amounts of solar\nenergy, particularly around the equator, and transport that heat with their currents. Ocean currents can move water\nfor thousands of miles from one temperature zone to another. Because oceans can absorb so much heat, maritime\nclimates are often milder than continental ones, with smaller temperature variations from day to night as well as\nfrom winter to summer. This influences not only temperature but also precipitation patterns over wide regions\nof Europe and the rest of the world. Water moderates coast environments in a number of ways. Water heats and\ncools more slowly than land. This heat inertia allows coastal communities to have climates that tend to be more\nmoderate than one might imagine for places so far north. Interior Europe does not benefit from coastal waters and\ncan have winters as cold as those found within the upper midwestern United States.\nFigure 2.2 The Dominant Climate Types of Europe 2.1 Introducing the Realm 84\nThe Gulf Stream is perhaps the most important current for Western Europe\u2019s climate and is responsible for\nproducing a temperate climate for a northern latitude location. Most of Western Europe has a moderate type C\nclimate. The Gulf Stream originates in the Gulf of Mexico, where the waters are warmed. This powerful current\nfollows the Eastern Seaboard of the United States before crossing the Atlantic Ocean for Europe. The Gulf\nStream\u2019s most dramatic effect can be found in the western coastal islands of Scotland, which has a mild enough\nclimate to support some forms of tropical flora, even though it is a degree of latitude as far north as Hudson Bay,\nCanada.\nThe coast of Norway provides another example. While most of Norway\u2019s coastal area lies within the Arctic region,\nit remains free of ice and snow throughout the winter. People living farther inland and closer to Eastern Europe\nand Russia encounter the colder type D climates. Colder air sweeps down from the Arctic north or from eastern\nSiberia and provides colder winters in this eastern region. The Mediterranean Sea moderates the temperature to\nthe south, providing a type C climate around its shores. Type C climates meet up with type E climates at or near\nthe Arctic Circle in Norway and in Iceland. 85 World Regional Geography\nFour Main European Landforms\nEurope has four main landforms, many islands and peninsulas, and various climate types. The four main\nlandforms include the Alpine region, Central Uplands, Northern Lowlands, and Western Highlands. Each\nrepresents a different physical part of Europe. The wide-ranging physical environment has provided Europe with\nan abundance of biodiversity. Biodiversity refers to diversity of the number of species in an ecosystem and the\nquantity of members in each species. The physical environment also provides natural resources and raw materials\nfor human activities. Europe\u2019s moderate climates and favorable relative location are supported by its access to\nthe many rivers and seas. These advantageous developmental factors supported the development of the Industrial\nRevolution in Europe, which gave rise to highly technical and urban societies. Europe has emerged as one of\nthe core economic centers of the global economy. Associated with the urbanization of Europe are high human\npopulation densities that have placed a strain on the natural environment. As result, there has been significant\ndeforestation and the loss of natural habitat, which has in turn has decreased the realm\u2019s level of biodiversity.\nRivers are abundant in Europe and have provided adequate transportation for travel and trade throughout its\nhistory. Most of Europe is accessible by water transport either via the many rivers or along the extensive coastlines\nof the peninsulas and islands. Two main rivers divide Europe: the Danube and the Rhine. Both have their origins\nin the region of southern Germany on or near the border with Switzerland. The Rhine River flows north and\nempties into the North Sea in Rotterdam, Holland, one of the world\u2019s busiest ports. The Danube flows east through\nvarious major European cities, such as Vienna, Budapest, and Belgrade before emptying into the Black Sea.\nFigure 2.3 Four Main Landforms of Europe: Western Highlands, Northern Lowlands, Central Uplands, and the Alpine Region 2.1 Introducing the Realm 86\nAlpine Region\nThe High Alps, which range from eastern France to Slovenia, are central to the Alpine region. Included in the\nAlpine Range are the Pyrenees, located on the border between France and Spain; the Apennines, running the\nlength of Italy; the Carpathians, looping around Romania from Slovakia; and finally, the shorter Dinaric Alps in\nformer Yugoslavia. Mountains usually provide minerals and ores that were placed there when the earth\u2019s internal\nprocesses created the mountains. Mountains also isolate people by acting as a dividing range that can separate\npeople into cultural groups. 87 World Regional Geography\nFigure 2.4 The Alpine Region: Eiger, M\u00f6nch, and Jungfrau from M\u00e4nnlichen\u2014Swiss Alps\nUniversity of Texas Libraries\nThe Alpine region encircles the Mediterranean coastlines, which have more temperate type C climates that are\nparticularly warm with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. This climate type allows for the cultivation of food\nproducts such as olives, citrus fruit, figs, apricots, and grapes. Evergreen scrub oaks and other drought-resistant\nshrubs are common in the Mediterranean region.\nThe Central Uplands\nThe region bordering the main Alps to the north, which includes a large portion of southern Germany extending\neastward, is known as the Central Uplands. These foothills to the Alps are excellent sources of raw materials\nsuch as forest products and coal, which are valuable resources for industrial activities. The Central Uplands\nare also good locations for dairy farming and cattle raising. This middle portion of the continent has a mixed 2.1 Introducing the Realm 88\ndeciduous-coniferous forest, and the vegetation includes oak, elm, and maple trees intermingled with pine and fir\ntrees. There are four distinct seasons in this region with moderate amounts of precipitation year round.\nNorthern Lowlands\nFigure 2.5\nThe Western Highlands meet the lowlands in central Scotland.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA. 89 World Regional Geography\nSimilar to the breadbasket of the midwestern United States, Europe\u2019s Northern Lowlands possess excellent\nfarmland. Major agricultural operations here provide for a large European population. The land is flat to rolling\nwith relatively good soils. The Northern Lowlands are a great plain that extends across northern Europe from\nsouthern France, north through Germany, and then all the way to the Ural Mountains of Russia. This area is\ntypified by prairies and areas of tall grasses and is mostly used as farmland. The lowlands area also contains bogs,\nheaths, and lakes. The eastern part of this great plain around Ukraine is characterized by a steppe biome. It is a\nflat and relatively dry region with short grasses and is generally an agricultural region. This eastern area has great\nswings in temperature, both from day to night and from summer to winter. Winter temperatures in the eastern\nsteppe can drop to below \u221240 \u00b0F, with summer temperatures reaching as high as 105 \u00b0F. This is similar to the\nsteppes of eastern Montana or western North Dakota in the United States.\nWestern Highlands\nOn the western edges of the European continent arise short rugged mountains called highlands that extend\nthroughout Norway, parts of Britain, and portions of the Iberian Peninsula of Portugal and Spain. These Western\nHighlands hold sparser populations and are less attractive to large farming operations. Agriculture is usually\nlimited to grazing livestock or farming in the valleys and meadows. The Scottish Highlands are noted for their\nwool products and Highland cattle. In England, the central chain of highlands called the Pennines proved valuable\nduring the Industrial Revolution because they enabled hydropower and, later, coal mining. Coal mining was\nprominent in the highland regions of Wales. In the far northern regions of Scandinavia, tundra environments\nprevail. In this coldest and driest biome, permafrost dominates the landscape, and the land becomes soggy for\nbrief periods during the few weeks of summer. The flora consists primarily of lichens, mosses, low shrubs, and\nwildflowers. 2.1 Introducing the Realm 90\nNatural Resources in Europe\nThe physical landforms of Europe provide a diversity of geographic opportunities that have catapulted Europe\nthrough the Industrial Revolution and into the information age. With an abundance of natural resources, European\ncountries have gained wealth from the land and leveraged their geographic location to develop a powerhouse\nof economic activity for the global marketplace. Europe has placed a strong focus on manufacturing activity to\ntake advantage of its natural resources. The highly urbanized society has struggled to find a balance between\nmodernization and environmental concerns. Industrial activities have contributed to the degradation of the\nenvironment and the demise of a number of species.\nDifferent regions of Europe are blessed with fresh water supplies, good soils, and various minerals. Chief among\nthe mineral deposits in Europe is iron ore, which can be found in Sweden, France, and Ukraine. Other minerals\nexist in smaller quantities, including copper, lead, bauxite, manganese, nickel, gold, silver, potash, clay, gypsum,\ndolomite, and salt. Extraction activities have supported the continent\u2019s industrialization.\nThe ready access to vast areas of the Atlantic Ocean and a number of major seas, lakes, and rivers has elevated fish\nto an important natural resource in Europe. The seas around Europe provide about 10 percent of the world\u2019s fish\ncatches. Mirroring the situation around the world, European fishing activity increased as population increased.\nEuropeans are becoming increasingly aware of the effects of overfishing. Stocks of Atlantic cod and Atlantic\nmackerel are considered to be at risk because of the twin threats of overfishing and changes in the environment\nthat are affecting natural mortality and slowing spawning. Stocks of eastern North Atlantic bluefin tuna are\nalso attracting attention for the same reason. Other species of fish in the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea are\nconsidered overexploited. Changes to the fishery are a major concern for strictly ecological reasons and also\nbecause fish comprise such a significant portion of the European economy.\nThe countries of Europe, with the formation of the EU, began to work toward shared research and policies with\nrespect to the fishery. The Common Fisheries Policy was drafted and includes strict and extensive rules and\nguidelines for fishing, particularly of cod. The rules are so strict and thus so controversial that Norway and Iceland\ndecided to opt out of the EU rather than agree to abide by these rules. The effect of these rules is incompletely\nknown, but the cod stocks in the North Sea do not seem to be rebounding as quickly or substantially as expected.\nForest covers more than 40 percent of the continent\u2019s land area, with the majority on the Russian side. Forests\nexist primarily in the less populous Nordic and Baltic countries and in Central Europe. About half the forest\nland in Europe is privately owned. Interestingly, there are several different forms of private ownership, including\nlarge family holdings, holdings by forest industries, and small to very small holdings by thousands of individuals.\nMost of the forested land is managed, and about 85 percent of the forests produce exploitable resources. The\npercentage of forested land in Europe is rebounding because of an extensive tree-planting initiative since 2000.\nPollution has caused great harm to the forests of Poland, the Czech Republic, and eastern Germany, and acid rain\nand air pollution have seriously harmed forests such as the Black Forest of southern Germany, which has also\nexperienced heavy logging activity.\nSoil resources are of critical importance. Soil is necessary for growing food, supporting livestock, supporting other\nnatural resources such as the forests, and supplying groundwater. Soil resources are only just beginning to receive\nattention in Europe. Problems to be addressed include loss of topsoil from development and building activities, 91 World Regional Geography\nolder-style agricultural practices, mining, contamination from industries and other sources, and acidification as a\nresult of acid rain.\nCoal, now substantially depleted, is abundant in several areas of Great Britain, including some offshore areas, as\nwell as in the industrial centers of Germany and in Ukraine. Other coals deposits are found in Belgium, France,\nSpain, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Russia. The burning of coal has produced high levels of air\npollution. Acid rain has been a major concern in the northern countries, where wind currents carry pollutants\nnorth into Scandinavia from the industrial regions of Central Europe. In Scandinavia, acid rain has diminished\nfish populations in many of the lakes. Forest health is also being challenged, which is diminishing the economic\nconditions of regions that depend on forests for their economic survival.\nPetroleum and natural gas deposits exist underneath the North Sea and were first tapped in the 1970s. Five\nEuropean countries have rights to these resources, including Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the\nNetherlands, and Germany, with Norway holding the bulk of the rights. The governments of these five nations\nagree that, although tapped only decades ago, half the North Sea oil reserves have been consumed.\nBefore the extraction of petroleum products from the North Sea, Russia and the former Soviet Union\u2019s other\nrepublics supplied petroleum to Europe. These areas still have a number of active extraction operations.\nHydroelectric power has been important in Europe as well. With both coal and oil resources largely depleted and\nthe desire to avoid the environmental damage caused by dams, the European Energy Commission is devoting\nsubstantial energy and resources to encouraging use of renewable resources such as wind and solar energy. In\nMarch 2007, European leaders agreed that a binding target of 20 percent of all energy must be from alternative\nsources by 2020. Also, 10 percent of the transportation fuels used by EU members must be sustainable biofuels.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Gulf Stream provides a moderate type C climate for much of Western Europe. Eastern Europe can\nexperience colder type D climates.\n\u2022 Europe has four main physical landforms that provide a diversity of natural resources. The North European\nLowland holds the majority of its agricultural potential.\n\u2022 An increase in population has also increased the demand on the environment. Various environmental\nconcerns are becoming more evident. Acid rain from industrialization has caused extensive damage to\nforests and fish populations in northern Europe. Atlantic fisheries are also experiencing a decline in\nproduction.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. Identify and locate the four main physical landforms of Europe.

Identify the three main language groups and the three main religious denominations of Europe.\nEurope didn\u2019t become a center for world economics with high standards of living by accident. Historical\nevents in global development have favored this realm because of its physical geography and cultural factors. In\nsouthern Europe, the Greeks provided ideas, philosophy, and organization. Greek thinkers promoted the concept\nof democracy. The Romans carried the concept of empire to new levels. From about 150 BCE to 475 CE, the\nRomans brought many ideas together and controlled a large portion of Europe and North Africa. The Roman\nEmpire introduced a common infrastructure to Europe. The Romans connected their world by building roads,\nbridges, aqueducts, and port facilities. They understood how to rule an empire. By taking advantage of the best\nopportunities of each region they controlled, they encouraged the best and most-skilled artisans to focus on what\nthey did best. This created the specialization of goods and a market economy. No longer did everyone have to\nmake everything for themselves. They could sell in the market what they produced and purchase products made by\nothers, which would be of higher quality than what they could make at home. Regions that specialized in certain\ngoods due to local resources or specialty skills could transport those goods to markets long distances away. The\nRoman Empire connected southern Europe and North Africa.\nFigure 2.6 Extent of the Roman Empire, 117 CE\n93 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 94\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Vikings of Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, and Denmark; 900\u20131200 CE) are often inaccurately referred to as\nrogue bands of armed warriors who pillaged and plundered northern Europe. Though they were fierce warriors in\nbattle, they were actually farmers, skilled craftsmen, and active traders. They developed trade routes throughout\nthe north. Using their seafaring knowledge and skills, the Vikings used Europe\u2019s waterways for transportation.\nThey were the early developers of the northern world from Russia to Iceland and even to North America. They\ndeveloped colonies in Iceland, Greenland, and what is present-day Canada. Their longships were renowned for\nversatility and provided an advantage on the sea. The Vikings made advances deep into Europe\u2014all the way to\nConstantinople. History indicates that the Byzantine Empire employed Scandinavian Vikings as mercenaries.\nIn a general sense, the regions to the west of Scandinavia\u2014such as Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, and\nGreenland\u2014were targeted by the Norwegian Vikings. Southern regions such as England and France were more\noften destinations of the Danish Vikings. Russia and areas of Eastern Europe were standard trading grounds for\nthe Swedish Vikings, though the different Viking groups could occasionally be found in the same destinations.\nThe present-day Scandinavian countries were established after the main Viking period. The Vikings connected\nnorthern Europe with trade during the Dark Ages. 95 World Regional Geography\nColonialism\nIt wasn\u2019t until after the Dark Ages of Europe ended that a rebirth of ideas, technology, and progress took hold. The\nRenaissance of the late fifteenth century prompted activity in Europe that changed the world. In 1492, Columbus\nand his three ships crossed the Atlantic to land on the shores of the Americas. This event symbolized the beginning\nof the era of European colonialism, which only diminished after World War II. Colonialism\u2019s effects remain\nin the colonies or protectorates that European countries still possess. Colonialism was fueled by the economic\nconcept of mercantilism that included the drive of governments to control trade, promoting the acquisition of\nwealth by the quick gain of gold or silver from their colonies.\nColonialism included the development of colonies outside the home country, usually for the expansion of imperial\npower and the exploitation of material gain. The building of larger ships and an understanding of sea travel\nallowed an exchange of new goods and ideas between continents. North and South America were opened up to\nthe European explorers for colonial expansion. European colonialism brought newfound wealth from the colonies\nback to Europe. All the regions of the world outside Europe were targeted for colonialism. Africa was divided\nup, \u201cLatin\u201d America was created, and Asia became a target for resources and trade. The few powerful countries\nalong the Atlantic coast of Europe began the drive to dominate their world. If you live in the Western Hemisphere,\nconsider the language you speak and the borders of your country: both were most likely products of European\ncolonialism. Most of the current political geographic boundaries were drawn up or shaped through colonial\nconflict or agreement.\nThe Agrarian Revolution\nThe post-Renaissance era introduced a number of agricultural changes that impacted European food production.\nBefore this time, most agricultural methods were primitive and labor intensive, but new technologies were\nintroduced that greatly enhanced agricultural production. Plows, seeders, and harvesting technologies were\nintroduced, and land reform and land ownership transitioned to adapt to the changing times. These innovations\nsupported the expanding port cities that created urban markets for agricultural surpluses. Colonial ships returned\nfrom the colonies with new crops such as the potato that revolutionized crop production. This era\u2019s progress\nin agricultural advancements is often referred to as the agrarian revolution. The agrarian revolution led to\nthe industrial developments such as the steam tractor and steel implements that further advanced agricultural\nproduction worldwide. 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 96\nThe Industrial Revolution\nGreat Britain, being an island country, developed the world\u2019s largest navy and took control of the seas. Their\ncolonial reach extended from what is now Canada to Australia. The Industrial Revolution, initiated in northern\nEngland in the late 1700s, introduced an industrial period that changed how humans produced products. The shift\nto coal for energy, the use of the steam engine for power, the smelting of iron, and the concept of mass production\nchanged how goods were produced.\nFigure 2.7\nMass production during the Industrial Revolution prompted a rural-to-urban shift in the population. Coal for energy and steam for\npower energized industrial activities.\nBuzrael \u2013 Old train \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThe development of the steam-powered engine provided a mobile power source. Waterwheels powered by steep-\nflowing rivers or streams were an early source of power. With coal for fuel and steam for power, the engines\nof industry were mobile and moved full speed ahead. Power looms converted textiles such as cotton and wool 97 World Regional Geography\ninto cloth. Powered by a steam engine, a power loom could operate twenty-four hours a day and could be\nlocated anywhere. Industrialization with cheap labor and adequate raw materials brought enormous wealth to the\nindustrial leaders and their home countries.\nWith the mass production of goods and advancements in technology, there was a major shift in human labor.\nFewer people were needed on the farms, and more workers were needed in factories. There was a large rural-to-\nurban shift in the human population. Europe experienced the development of the major cities of its realm during\nthis period. In Britain, for example, in 1800 only 9 percent of the population lived in urban areas. By 1900, some\n62 percent were urban dwellers. As of 2010, it is more than 90 percent. Europe, as a whole, is about 75 percent\nurban. As a comparison, the US population is about 80 percent urban.\nAs discussed in earlier sections, the rural-to-urban shift that began with the Industrial Revolution in Europe\ncontinues today in developing countries. The Industrial Revolution, which started in northern England\u2019s Pennine\nmountain chain, rippled through Europe and across the Atlantic to the United States. The majority of countries\nin Europe are currently in stage 5 of the index of economic development. The five stages of the index of\neconomic development illustrate a pattern of development and population dynamics for a country or region. The\nmodel outlines how rural societies with an agrarian economy in stage 1 can make the transition to stage 5: the\nstage that indicates an urban society with a consumer economy. As a general trend, when a country\u2019s levels of\nindustrial activity and urban growth rise, the outcome is usually a higher standard of living and smaller family\nsizes. Additionally, rural-to-urban shift takes place, driven by the pull of opportunities and advantages in the\nindustrializing and urbanizing areas. Countries in stage 5 of the index have small families with a fertility rate\nbelow the replacement level. Their incomes, based on a consumer economy, are generally at high levels.\nAs Europe industrialized and progressed through the stages of the index of economic development, certain core\nregions reached the postindustrial stages earlier than others. Western Europe established a core industrial region\nwith an extended periphery. The postindustrial activity in this core area continues today in four main centers of\ninnovation: (1) Stuttgart in southern Germany, (2) Lyon in southeastern France, (3) Milan in northern Italy, and (4)\nBarcelona in northeastern Spain. These four industrial centers have been referred to by some as the Four Motors\nof Europe because they promote business and industry for the European community. The European core region\nextends as far as Stockholm in the north to Barcelona in the south.\nFigure 2.8 The Core Region of Europe and the Four Centers of Industrial Activity 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 98\nAttractive \u201cpull\u201d forces draw immigrants to the core economic area of Europe, seeking opportunity and advantage.\n\u201cPush\u201d forces cause people to leave an area due to negative cultural or environmental forces, and\/or the lack of\nopportunity and advantage.\nCentral Business Districts and Primate Cities\nEuropean urban development centered on port cities that had industrial activity. Ships could import raw materials,\nthe factories could manufacture the goods, and the ships could export the products. A central business district\n(CBD) developed around these activities. Since walking was the main transportation mode, all business activities\nhad to be located in the same vicinity. Banks, retail shops, food markets, and residential dwellings had to be close\nto the factories and port facilities. Modern cities emerged from this industrialization process, and Europe is one of\nthe more urban realms on the planet.\nMany European countries have one main primary city that is more than twice as large as their second city. The\nterm primate city indicates a city that is more than twice as large as their second city and exceptionally expressive 99 World Regional Geography\nof national feeling and heritage. One may instinctively think that the primate city is the same as the capital city of a\ncountry; this, however, is not always the case. For example, Washington, DC, is the US capital, but New York City\nis the country\u2019s primate city. Primate cities represent a country\u2019s persona and often are symbolic of the country\u2019s\nheritage and character. Though common, not all countries of the world have a primate city. Financial and business\ncenters in cities such as London, Rome, or Paris support the industrial activity that led to their development as\nprimate cities. Most primate cities are ports or are located on a major river.\nRural-to-Urban Shift and Population Growth\nConsider the trend that the Industrial Revolution brought to Europe. Do you remember the population growth\nprinciple? This principle states that as countries industrialize and urbanize, family size naturally goes down\nand incomes traditionally go up. Integrate this with the rural-to-urban shift that occurs when countries progress\nthrough the five stages of the index of economic development. By understanding these basic trends, one can\ndetermine the average family size in Europe and why it is declining.\nBecause Europe is an urbanized realm, one can understand why family size in Europe is small. As a matter of\nfact, various countries in Europe have negative population growth rates. Family size in Spain and Italy is around\n1.2, with the average family size in all of Europe at 1.4 children. The replacement rate to maintain an even\npopulation-growth pattern would be a fertility rate of about 2.1 children. Small families do not provide enough\nyoung people to cover the available entry-level service jobs. Europe, the United States, and Japan are all in stage\n5 of the index of economic development and are facing low or negative population growth and a deficit in their\ncheap labor supply. As a core economic global power, Europe has experienced an increase in immigration. With a\nlower fertility rate and an increase in postindustrial activity, Europe is a magnet for people from poorer peripheral\ncountries and even peripheral regions within Europe who are looking for opportunities and advantages.\nWith the planet\u2019s human population increasing overall, one might think that a smaller family size is a positive\ntrend. It may be, but there are problems along the way. If there are fewer young people in a community\u2014fewer\nchildren and fewer people of employment age\u2014consider how this affects the economic situation. With a declining\nEuropean population, who will apply for the entry-level jobs? Economic core areas attract immigrants seeking\nopportunities and advantages. Europe follows this pattern. There has been increasing tension between the long-\nstanding European cultural groups and immigrants from developing countries who often speak non-European\nlanguages or follow religions other than Christianity. The main religion of immigrants from North Africa or the\nMiddle East is Islam, which is the fastest-growing religion in Europe. 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 100\nDeclining Family Size in Europe\nThere are six main reasons for declining family size in Europe:\n1. The high cost of living makes supporting a large family expensive.\n2. Confined living spaces in urban areas are expensive for larger families.\n3. Young people are naturally putting off marriage and family until they are older.\n4. Family planning and health care for women is available.\n5. More people are earning an education and putting off having children.\n6. More women choose professional careers and have fewer children.\nThe following problems arise with the decline in family size in Europe:\n\u2022 Fewer children results in a shrinking workforce for entry-level jobs.\n\u2022 The workforce is getting older and more professionals are retiring.\n\u2022 Pension costs are increasing and there are fewer younger workers to pay for them.\n\u2022 The tax burden is shifting to fewer younger professionals in the workplace.\n\u2022 More revenues are needed to pay for the health care of a larger population of senior citizens.\n\u2022 Immigrants seeking employment may not share the same cultural heritage or values. 101 World Regional Geography\nNation-States and Devolution\nThe agrarian revolution and the Industrial Revolution were powerful movements that altered human activity in\nmany ways. New innovations in food production and the manufacturing of products transformed Europe, which\nin turn impacted the rest of the world. Even before the agrarian revolution was under way, other transitions in\nEuropean political currents were undermining the established empire mentality fueled by warfare and territorial\ndisputes. The political revolution that transformed Europe was a result of diverse actions that focused on ending\ncontinual warfare for the control of territory and introducing peaceful agreements that recognized sovereignty\nof territory ruled by representative government structures. Various treaties and revolutions continued to shift the\npower from dictators and monarchs to the general populace. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 and those that\nfollowed helped establish a sense of peace and stability for Central Europe, which had been dominated by the\nHoly Roman Empire and competing powers. The Holy Roman Empire, which was centered on the German states\nof Cental Europe from 962\u20131806, should not be confused with the Roman Empire, which was based in Rome and\nended centuries earlier. The French Revolution (1789\u201395) was an example of the political transformation taking\nplace across Europe to establish democratic processes for governance.\nThe political revolution laid the groundwork for a sense of nationalism that transformed Europe into nation-\nstates. The term nation refers to a homogeneous group of people with a common heritage, language, religion, or\npolitical ambition. The term state refers to the government; for example, the United States has a State Department\nwith a secretary of state. When nations and states come together, there is a true nation-state, wherein most citizens\nshare a common heritage and a united government.\nEuropean countries have progressed to the point where the concept of forming or remaining a nation-state is a\ndriving force in many political sectors. To state it plainly, most Europeans, and to an extent every human, want to\nbe a member of a nation-state, where everyone is alike and shares the same culture, heritage, and government. The\nresult of the drive for nation-states in Europe is an Italy for Italians, a united Germany for Germans, and a France\nfor the French, for example. The truth is that this ideal goal is difficult to come by. Though the political borders\nof many European countries resemble nation-states, there is too much diversity within the nations to consider the\nideal of creating a nation-state a true reality.\nVarious ethnic populations in Europe desire their own nation-states within their countries of residence. They\nwant to devolve or separate from the larger state. The term devolution refers to the process whereby regions or\npeople within a state demand independence and autonomy at the central government\u2019s expense. There are now\na number of cases where devolution is occurring in Europe. For example, Scotland and Wales seek to devolve\nfrom the United Kingdom. The Basque region between Spain and France would like to have its own nation-\nstate. Former Yugoslavia broke up into seven smaller nation-states. Various other minority groups in Europe seek\nsimilar arrangements. Thus both cohesive cultural forces and divisive cultural forces are active in the European\ncommunity. 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 102\nCentrifugal and Centripetal Forces\nCultural forces continually apply pressure on a country. Some of these cultural forces pull the nation together\n(centripetal forces) and others pull it apart (centrifugal forces). Primary sources of these cultural forces include\nreligion, language, ethnicity, politics, and economic conditions.\nTable 2.9\nCentripetal Forces Hold a State Together\nCentrifugal Forces Divide a State\n\u2022 Ethnic Unity and Tolerance\n\u2022 Ethnic Conflict\n\u2022 Social\/Economic Equity\n\u2022 Social Injustice\n\u2022 Just and Fair Legal System\n\u2022 Poverty\n\u2022 Charismatic Leadership\n\u2022 Dictatorial Leadership\n\u2022 Religious Acceptance\n\u2022 Religious Intolerance\n\u2022 Nationalism\n\u2022 Nationalism\n\u2022 Common Heritage\n\u2022 Loss of Rights\n\u2022 Common Language\n\u2022 Any Other Divisive Force\n\u2022 Any Other Unifying Force\nCentrifugal forces divide a state and centripetal forces hold a state together.\nWhen there is division, conflict, or confrontation, the centrifugal forces are at play. When unification, agreement,\nor nationalism are being exercised, centripetal forces are evident. The sources that tie a country together can also\nbe the sources that divide a country. Ethnic unity can be a positive force, while ethnic division and conflict can\nbe a divisive force. If centrifugal forces become strong, the result may be outright civil war, as was seen in the\nUnited States in the 1860s. Unity can also be evident through national struggles, such as the nationalism displayed\nimmediately after the 9\/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. After the attacks, an outpouring of goodwill and\nagreement strengthened the bonds within the United States.\nTo understand our world, it is helpful to understand the cultural forces that are active in any one location.\nDisagreement, inequity, or injustice related to the cultural factors of ethnicity, religion, language, and economics\nof a region or country is the cause of most conflicts. The strong personalities that provide leadership can similarly\nprove to be powerful forces that either divide or unite a nation. An example of cultural forces in conflict in Europe\ncan be found in Northern Ireland, where political forces use religious differences as a means of social division. 103 World Regional Geography\nReligion and Language in Europe\nEurope has historically been considered a Christian realm. The three main branches of Christianity in Europe are\nRoman Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox. Rome has been the geographical base for the Roman Catholic\nChurch since the Roman Empire. Operating on the Romance language, Latin, the Catholic Church has provided\nsouthern Europe with a common religion for over 1,500 years.\nThe Roman Catholic Church split when Constantinople, now called Istanbul, gained preeminence. The Eastern\nOrthodox Church launched itself as the primary organization in the Slavic lands of Eastern Europe and Russia.\nThe reformation of the fourteenth century, led by people such as Martin Luther, brought about the Protestant\nReformation and a break with the Roman Catholic Church. Protestant churches have dominated northern Europe\nto this day.\nTable 2.1 Three Main Language Groups\nGermanic Language Group (Found Romance Language Group (Latin Based; Slavic Language Group (Found\nMainly in Northern Europe) Found Mainly in Southern Europe) Mainly in Eastern Europe)\nEnglish, Dutch, German French, Italian, Spanish Polish, Russian, Czech\nDanish, Norwegian, Swedish Portuguese, Romanian, Walloon Ukrainian, Slovak, Slovene\nBelarussian, Serbo-Croatian,\nIcelandic, Faroese, Frysian Romancsh, Catalan, Provencal\nLusatian\nMacedonian, Bulgarian 2.2 Historical Development Patterns 104\nFigure 2.10 Three Dominant Language Groups and Three Dominant Christian Denominations of Europe\nThree main Indo-European language groups dominate Europe. Though there are additional language groups, the\ndominant three coincide with the three main religious divisions. In the east, where the Eastern Orthodox Church\nis dominant, the Slavic language group prevails. In the north, along with Protestant Christianity, one finds the\nGermanic language group. In southern Europe, where Roman Catholicism is dominant, the Romance languages\nare more commonly spoken.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Roman Empire connected southern Europe and created an infrastructure to help promote trade and\nintercultural connections. The Vikings connected northern Europe through trade and exploitation.\n\u2022 Technological advancements helped European colonialism dominate other countries and exploit their labor\nand resources. Coastal European countries created colonies and external sources of wealth.\n\u2022 The Industrial Revolution was promoted by the development of steam power with coal as a fuel source. The\nmass production of goods gave the European countries an advantage in the world marketplace.\n\u2022 The Industrial Revolution prompted a shift in population from the rural agricultural regions to the urban\ncenters. More people were needed in the factories and fewer workers were required on the farms because of\nimproved agricultural methods. This shift resulted in smaller families and more women entering the\nworkplace.\n\u2022 The early empires of Europe gave way to the concept of a similar people (the nation) unifying under a\ncommon government (the state) to create nation-states.\n\u2022 Divisive centrifugal cultural forces tend to divide and separate people in a state, whereas cohesive 105 World Regional Geography\ncentripetal cultural forces tend to unify a state.\n\u2022 The Indo-European language family has three dominant groups in Europe: Germanic in the north, Romance\nin the south, and Slavic in the east. The Christian religion has three main divisions in Europe: a Protestant\nnorth, Catholic south, and an Orthodox east.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Locate and describe the various traditional regions of Western Europe.\n2. Outline how the physical geography varies from region to region.\n3. Explain how each region has met the challenges of retaining its cultural identity or uniqueness.\n4. Summarize how each region has developed an industrialized economy.\nEurope has been traditionally divided into regions based on location according to the four points of the compass:\nEastern Europe, southern Europe, Western Europe, and northern Europe. The British Isles are often considered\na separate region but can be included as a part of Western Europe. These regions are purely geographical\nregions that may share similar physical geography or cultural traits based on physical geographical demands. For\nhistorical political purposes, Europe is divided into the two regions of Western Europe and Eastern Europe. In this\ncase, the region of Western Europe includes the regions of northern Europe, southern Europe, Central Europe, and\nthe British Isles. Eastern Europe is everything east of Germany, Austria, and Italy. These regional labels are used\nmore for identification than for regional analysis. They serve as traditional labels of geographic location.\nFigure 2.16 Traditional Regions of Europe\n106 107 World Regional Geography\nThe traditional regions of Europe are not as relevant today as they have been historically with the creation of the\nEuropean Union (EU). Economic and political relationships are more integrated than they were in past eras when\nnation-states and empires were more significant. Economic conditions have often superseded cultural factors\nand have intensified the need for increased integration. Cultural forces have traditionally supported nationalistic\nmovements that work to preserve the culture, heritage, and traditions of a people. Regional cultural differences\nremain the social fabric of local communities that support the retention of their identity. Modern transportation\nand communication technology has brought this cornucopia of European identities into one single sphere of global\nrecognition. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 108\nNorthern Europe\nEurope has many different cultural identities within its continent. Northern Europe has traditionally included\nIceland, Finland, and the three Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. These countries are\noften referred to as the Nordic countries. All these countries were influenced by Viking heritage and expansion.\nTheir capital cities are also major ports, and the largest cities of each country are their primate cities. The\nlanguages of the three Scandinavian countries are from the Germanic language group and are mutually intelligible.\nFinnish is not an Indo-European language but is instead from the Uralic language family. Most of Iceland\u2019s\ninhabitants are descendents of Scandinavian Vikings. Protestant Christianity has prevailed in northern Europe\nsince about 1000 CE. The Lutheran Church has traditionally been the state church until recent years. These\ncountries were kingdoms, and their royal families remain highly regarded members of society. The colder northern\nclimate has helped shape the cultural activities and the winter sports that are part of the region\u2019s heritage.\nPeripheral isolation from the rest of Europe because of their northern location and dividing bodies of water have\nallowed the northern culture to be preserved for centuries and shape the societies that now exist in northern\nEurope.\nFigure 2.17 Port in Stockholm, Sweden 109 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nHuman rights, education, and social concerns are high priorities of the governments of northern Europe, and the\nquality of these elements rank highly by global comparisons. Standards of living are among the highest in Europe.\nIsolation in northern Europe does create an element of economic cost, and transportation technology has been\nleveraged to address this. A modern bridge has been constructed across the Baltic Sea from Denmark to Sweden\nto increase the flow of people, goods, and materials between the Scandinavian Peninsula and mainland Europe.\nIceland is the most remote of the Nordic countries. Its small population\u2014less than a half million people\u2014is\nconnected to Europe by sea and air transportation and communication technologies. Almost all elementary school\nchildren in the Nordic countries are taught English as a second language. Fish, meat, and potatoes are traditional\ndietary staples; fish in particular has been an important food source. The cuisine of the region is not noted for\nbeing spicy. Northern Europe has worked diligently to integrate itself with the global community and yet maintain\nits cultural identity.\nAs a standard practice, the northern European countries have exploited the opportunities and advantages of their\nnatural resources to expand their economies. Sweden, northern Europe\u2019s largest country, has used its natural iron\nore supply to develop its manufacturing sector. Sweden was the production base of Saab and Volvo vehicles\nas well as other high-tech products; however, GM purchased the Saab auto division in 2000 and some of its\nautomobiles were manufactured in Mexico. In 2010, Saab was sold back to European investors and production\nresumed in Sweden. Volvo Car Corporation was purchased by Ford Motor Corporation in 1999 and then acquired\nby a Chinese automaker in 2010.\nFinland has vast timber resources and is one of Europe\u2019s major sources of processed lumber. It was the\noriginal manufacturer of Nokia cell phones, an example of its technological advancements. Nokia is the largest\nmanufacturer of mobile phones in the world and has production facilities in eight different countries.\nNorway has been benefiting from the enormous oil and natural gas reserves under the North Sea. Fishing and 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 110\nmodest agricultural activities had been Norway\u2019s traditional means of gaining wealth, but now it is the export of\nthe much-in-demand energy resources. Because of its economic and energy independence, Norway has opted not\nto join the EU.\nVikings were masters of the seas and colonized Greenland, which is located next to Canada and is considered to\nbe the world\u2019s largest island. Danish colonization in the eighteenth century included Greenland and the Faeroe\nIslands, which are located between Scotland and Iceland. Both are now under the government of Denmark but\nretain a high level of self-rule and autonomy, which has aided them in holding on to their cultural identity.\nGreenland has also opted not to become a part of the EU even though Denmark is a member. Greenland only had\na population of about 57,670 in 2011, and 80 percent of its surface is covered with ice. Fish is Greenland\u2019s main\nexport, but minerals, diamonds, and gold are also present in viable amounts.\nDenmark has a consumer economy with a high standard of living. This Scandinavian country is often ranked as the\nleast corrupt country in the world and has the happiest people. The country has supported a positive environment\nand implemented strong measures to protect its natural areas. Denmark\u2019s main exports are food products and\nenergy. The country has sizeable oil resources in the North Sea but also receives over 15 percent of its electricity\nfrom wind turbines.\nThe Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have often been included in the northern European designation\nbecause of their northern location. Estonia has the strongest similarities in religion, traditions, and culture, and\ngeographic literature often has included it as a part of northern Europe. The Baltic states have been associated\nwith Eastern Europe through the Soviet era but, like their neighbors to the north, are becoming more economically\nintegrated with Western Europe.\nNorthern Europe is a peripheral region. Southern Sweden has an advanced industrial base and resembles a core\narea. Sweden\u2019s northern portion and the main parts of the other Nordic countries act as sources of raw materials for\nEurope\u2019s urban core industrial region. In the core-peripheral spatial relationship, northern Europe most resembles\na semiperipheral region that has attributes of both the urban core and the rural periphery.\nNorway, Sweden, and Finland are quite large in area but are not densely populated compared with other European\nnations. Sweden ranks as the fourth-largest European country in physical area. Sweden is larger than the US state\nof California, but in the 2010 census, it had less than ten million people. In 2010, Finland, Norway, and Denmark\nall had less than six million people each.\nThe cultures and societies of northern Europe have progressed along similar paths; that is, they have advanced\nfrom once Viking-dominated lands into modern democratic and socially mature nations. Northern Europe is\nknown for its concern for the social welfare of its citizens. Their strong egalitarian ideals have contributed\nto extensive advancements in free medical care, free education, and free social services for all, regardless of\nnationality or minority status. Civil rights for minorities, women, and other groups is assured and protected.\nDenmark doesn\u2019t have a legal age for consumption of alcoholic beverages, though tradition sets the age at about\nfourteen. Culture and the arts are well developed; examples include everything from the Nobel Peace Prize to\nHans Christian Anderson to the 1970s chart-topping pop group ABBA. Sweden has become a major exporter of\nmusic worldwide. Rock, hip-hop, and pop music are common genres. With English as a widely spoken language\nin Scandinavia, music and cultural trends have a larger export market in places such as the United States and\nBritain. 111 World Regional Geography\nSouthern Europe\nSouthern Europe includes three large peninsulas that extend into the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Iberian Peninsula consists of Spain and Portugal. The Pyrenees mountain range separates the Iberian\nPeninsula from France. Greece, the most southern country on the Balkan Peninsula, includes hundreds of\nsurrounding islands and the large island of Crete. The Italian Peninsula is the shape of a boot with the Apennine\nMountains running down its center. Italy also includes the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. Technically, the island\ncountry of Cyprus is also included in southern Europe. There are five ministates in this region. The small island of\nMalta is located to the south of Sicily and is an independent country. Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, and Vatican\nCity are also independent states located within the region. Southern Europe\u2019s type C climate, moderated by the\nwater that surrounds it, is often referred to as a Mediterranean climate, which has mild, wet winters and hot, dry\nsummers.\nRural-to-urban shift in southern Europe has not been as strong as that of Western Europe. Only about 50 percent\nof the people in Portugal are urban; in Spain and Greece, about 60 percent are urban.\nItaly is more representative of Europe, with about 68 percent of the population urbanized. Italy is also divided,\nwith northern Italy being more industrialized than southern Italy. The southern regions of Italy, including the\nisland of Sicily, are more rural with fewer industries. Northern Italy has the metropolitan city of Milan as an\nanchor for its global industrial and financial sector in the Lombardy region, which includes the city of Turin\nand the port of Genoa. This northern region of Italy has the economic muscle to be one of Europe\u2019s leading\nmanufacturing centers. The so-called Ancona Line can be drawn across the middle of Italy from Ancona on the\neast coast to Rome on the west coast to separate the industrial north with the more agrarian south. The north also\nhas the noted cultural cities of Venice, Florence, and Pisa.\nA similar situation exists in Spain. The urbanized Catalonia region around Barcelona in the northeast has high-\ntech industries and a high standard of living. Southern Spain has large rural areas with economies heavily based\non agricultural production. Portugal and Greece are not as industrialized and do not have the same economic\nopportunities. Historically, southern Europe, Portugal, and Greece in particular each have had a much lower\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita than northern or Central Europe. Their economies have been much\nmore aligned with the economic periphery than with the industrial core region of Europe. Greece has had serious\neconomic difficulty in the past few years.\nSouthern European countries have much larger populations than their northern European counterparts. Italy has\nabout sixty million people in an area smaller than Norway, which has less than five million. Spain has about forty\nmillion; both Portugal and Greece have more than ten million. Cultural factors are also different here than in\nnorthern Europe. The culture of southern Europe has been built around agriculture. Traditional cuisine is based on\nlocally grown fresh food and wine. Olive oil and wine have been major agricultural exports. The main languages\nof Iberia and Italy are based on the Romance language group, and Greek is an independent branch of the Indo-\nEuropean language family. The most dominant religious affiliation in the south is Roman Catholicism, except in\nGreece, where the Eastern (Greek) Orthodox Church is prominent. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 112\nFigure 2.18 Spain\u2019s Autonomous Communities\nBecause of its diversity, Spain is not categorized as a nation-state.\nSpain is the most diverse nation in southern Europe with a number of distinct ethnic groups. The Basques in the\nnorth along the French border would like to separate and create their own nation-state. The region of Galicia in\nnorthwest Spain is an autonomous region and was once a kingdom unto itself. There are many other autonomous\ncommunities in Spain, each with its own distinct heritage and culture. Farther east in the Mediterranean is the\nisland state of Cyprus, which is divided by Greek and Turkish ethnic groups. The southern part of the island is\ndominated by Greek heritage and culture, and the northern part of the island is dominated by Turkish culture and\ntraditions. Islam is the main religion of the Turkish north. The people of southern Europe are diverse and hold to\nmany different traditions but are tied together by the sea and the land, which create similar lifestyles and economic\nactivities. 113 World Regional Geography\nSpecial Section: The Cities of Italy\nItaly has a population of about sixty million people, with about 68 percent living in cities. Italian culture balances the\nfood and lifestyle of the rural countryside with the history and heritage of the cities. Cultural regions such as Tuscany,\nalong the northwest coast, or Sicily, the island to the south, evoke thoughts of Italian heritage and culture. The large\ncities of Italy each have their own draw and persona that emulates the nation\u2019s heritage and history. Italy has four cities\nwith population estimates of over one million people each, and a number of others are major cultural centers. The\nmetropolitan areas around these cities can be extensive.\nTable 2.2 Major Italian Cities\nRank by Population Population Estimate\n1. Rome (capital) 3.357 million\n2. Milan 2.962 million\n3. Naples 2.27 million\n4. Turin (Torino) 1.662 million\n5. Palermo 872,000\n8. Florence 381,762\n13. Venice 297,743\nPopulation is for city only and not for metropolitan area. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 114\nSources: CIA Factbook: https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/publications\/the-world-factbook\/geos\/it.html\nhttp:\/\/www.citymayors.com\/gratis\/italian_cities.html.\nRome, Italy\u2019s capital and its largest city, was at the center of the Roman Empire and has a significant historical\nconnection to the culture and heritage of Italy. Rome is also home to Vatican City, which holds a separate political\nidentity. The Vatican City is home to the pope, who is the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Rome provides a\nhistorical and political center for the nation of Italy and is located along the Ancona Line, which distinguishes northern\nItaly from southern Italy.\nThe northern city of Milan is a core industrial center for the nation and for Europe. With a large metropolitan area, the\ncity of Milan has a long history as a center of industry and power. The city continues to hold its powerful status and has\nexpanded its international reach into the world of high-end fashion and the arts.\nNaples is located along the west coast to the south of Rome. Founded by the Greeks as a colony, Naples was transferred\nto the Roman Empire. This historic city is home to many artistic, musical, and cultural activities that emulate the\nheritage of the Italian people from the time of the Renaissance.\nFigure 2.19\nThe central part of the city of Naples, Italy, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Italy is densely populated with many historical cities\nemulating the culture and traditions of each part of the country. 115 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe industrial city of Turin (Torino) is located in northwest Italy in the Alpine region on the banks of the Po River.\nTurin is second only to Milan in its industrial capacity within Italy. Automobile manufacturing as well as prestigious\nuniversities, art galleries, and cultural centers can be found here. The hosting of the 2006 Winter Olympics gave witness\nto Turin\u2019s capacity and success.\nPalermo is located on the island of Sicily. Founded by the Phoenicians, this city became the capital of the kingdom of\nSicily. Palermo is the center of culture and cuisine for Sicily and has been a destination for tourists from around the\nworld. Italy\u2019s mild Mediterranean climate has enhanced tourism opportunities for many Italian cities such as Palermo.\nFlorence and Venice each have their own unique characteristics. Traditionally, Florence has been a city of commerce,\ntrade, and the arts. Located in the Tuscany region, it is often referred to as the birthplace of the Renaissance. Florence is\na UNESCO World Heritage Site and is noted for its art and architecture. Venice is located on the northeast coast of Italy\nat the edge of the Adriatic Sea. The city was a powerful trade and commerce center in the Middle Ages and during the\nRenaissance. Often referred to with romantic overtones, the city is built on 117 small islands using canals as streets. The\nuniqueness of the landscape, arts, food, and architecture make this city one of the major tourist destinations in Italy.\nCentral Europe\nIn the regional sense of location, when discussing the political geography of the European continent, the specific\nstates located in the western part of the European mainland are often referred to as Central Europe. The term\nWestern Europe is also applicable to this region when discussing regional variations within the realm outside\nof Eastern Europe. Germany and France are the two dominant states, with Belgium, the Netherlands, and\nLuxembourg making up the Benelux countries. Switzerland and Austria border the Alpine region. The ministate of\nLiechtenstein is located on the border between Switzerland and Austria. France is the only country with coastlines\non both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. These countries are located in the core economic region of\nEurope and have stable democratic governments and a relatively high standard of living by world comparisons. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 116\nFigure 2.20\nBarges transport goods along the beautiful Rhine River in Germany, where historic towns share the landscape.\nDaiLuo \u2013 Rail to Heaven \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nCentral Europe is a powerhouse of global economics. The Rhine River is a pathway for industrial activity from\nsouthern Germany to Europe\u2019s busiest port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Western France has the political\ncapital of the EU along the Rhine at Strasbourg. To the south is France\u2019s second-largest city, Lyon, which is a\nmajor industrial center for modern technology. Germany had the historical Ruhr industrial complex along the\nRhine that supported the high-tech industries in southern Germany in the cities of Stuttgart, Mannheim, and\nMunich. Germany is the most populous country in Europe, with over eighty-two million people in 2010. Germany\nis also Europe\u2019s largest economy and has the largest GDP overall as a country. Belgium has major business centers\nin Brussels and Antwerp. Switzerland is noted for its banking and financial markets. Luxembourg has one of the\nhighest GDP per capita in all of Europe. Austria is noted for its high level of cultural activities in Vienna and\nSalzburg. All these countries complement each other in creating one of the dominant economic core areas in the\nworld.\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, the political geography of Central Europe was not conducive to the high\nlevel of economic cooperation that now exists. In World War Iand World War II, Germany and France were on\nopposite sides, and the Benelux countries were caught in middle. The cultural differences between the Germans\nand the French start with the differences in language and religious affiliation. Germany was divided after World\nWar II into East Germany and West Germany, separated by the so-called Iron Curtain. East Germany was under\na Communist government, and West Germany was a capitalist democracy. They were reunited in 1990 when\nthe Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall came down. The two countries merged under one government. Europe is\ngradually being united economically, but each country or region still retains its cultural uniqueness. 117 World Regional Geography\nThe Benelux Countries\nThe Benelux countries have a great deal in common historically. Before the economic union that created the\nterm Benelux, these countries were collectively referred to as the Low Countries, so called because of their\nrelative position to sea level. The Benelux countries are some of the most densely populated countries. They have\nmanaged to work together toward a common economic objective in spite of their cultural differences.\nThe capital and largest city in Belgium is Brussels, with the other urban areas being the ports of Antwerp and\nGhent. Belgium is split into three large geographic areas. The dominant language in the northern region of\nFlanders is Dutch (Flemish), and the people are known as Flemings. In the southern region of Wallonia, most\npeople speak French and are known as Walloons. German is the third official language and is spoken along the\neastern border.\nWhen the Industrial Revolution diffused across the English Channel and arrived in Europe, Belgium was one of\nthe early countries to adapt to the technological developments. Belgium remains heavily industrialized and is a\nmajor exporter of products, including finished diamonds, food products, nonferrous metals, technology, petroleum\nproducts, and plastics. In general, Belgium imports the raw materials to manufacture these goods for export.\nBelgium also has a significant services sector. The services sector, including real estate, hotels, restaurants, and\nentertainment, thrives in part because Brussels is the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) and components of the EU. Many countries and organizations maintain offices in Brussels to have easy\naccess to these headquarters; therefore, Brussels is the temporary home to many diplomats and foreign business\npeople.\nFigure 2.21 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 118\nBrussels is connected to other European cities through high-speed rail networks.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe European country of the Netherlands also includes the colonies of the Netherlands Antilles in the Caribbean.\nThe Netherlands, sometimes called Holland, is actually the name of two provinces (North Holland and South\nHolland) in the northwest part of the country. The largest city is Amsterdam. The Hague is the seat of government\nand is home to the United Nations International Court of Justice. Rotterdam is located at the mouth of the Rhine\nRiver and is one of the busiest ports on the continent. The country is famous for its Zuider Zee, which is the large\ninland region below sea level that has been drained of water and surrounded with an extensive dike protecting\nit from the North Sea. Reclaiming land from the sea in areas called polders has provided this densely populated\ncountry with more land area for its people to expand their activities.\nFor a small country with few natural resources, the Netherlands has an impressive GDP. The Dutch have made\ngood use of their location on the North Sea and of the location of several large navigable rivers. This has facilitated\nvoluminous exports to the inland parts of Europe. The major industries include food processing, chemicals,\npetroleum refining, and electrical machinery. The Netherlands is a top exporter of agricultural products, which\ncontribute substantially to its economy. Dutch agricultural exports consist of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and bulbs\nas well as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers.\nThe main languages spoken in the small landlocked country of Luxemburg are French, German, and\nLuxembourgish. Luxembourg\u2019s one major city is Luxembourg City. Luxemburg has an enviable economic\nsituation with a stable and prosperous economy, low unemployment, and low inflation. Thanks to rich iron-ore\ndeposits, this country was able to develop a very robust steel industry, which was the cornerstone of the nation\u2019s\nprosperity until the 1970s. As steel declined, Luxemburg remade itself as an important world financial center.\nLuxembourg leads Europe as the center for private banking and insurance industries and is second only to the\nUnited States in terms of being an investment fund center. 119 World Regional Geography\nFrance\nFrance covers 211,209 square miles and is the second-largest European country; Ukraine is slightly larger in\nphysical area. The physical landscapes of France vary widely from the northern low-lying coastal plains to the\nAlpine ranges of the east. Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alpine range at 15,782 feet, is located in France\nnear the Italian border. In the far south, the Pyrenees run along the border with Spain. The south-central region of\nthe country is home to the Massif Central, which is a plateau and highland region made up of a large stretch of\nextinct volcanoes.\nDuring the colonial era, France was a major naval power and held colonies around the world. The French Empire\nwas the second largest at the time. The French language is still used for diplomacy in many countries. Though\nthe French Empire no longer exists, France has progressed into a postindustrial country with one of the most\ndeveloped economies in the world. It is a major player in European affairs, the EU, and the United Nations (UN).\nFrance is a democratic republic that boasts a high-quality public education system and long life expectancies.\nFigure 2.22 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 120\nThe Eiffel Tower, a symbol of the primate city of Paris, was built in 1889. The city of Paris started as a citadel on an\nisland in the middle of the Seine River.\nU.S. Library of Congress \u2013 public domain.\nIn 2010, France\u2019s population was about sixty-five million, with about ten million living in France\u2019s primate city\nof Paris. The city of Paris is on an excellent site, it is favorably situated with regard to its surrounding area. It is a\nmajor core area of France serving a large peripheral region of the country. The next largest city of Lyon, which is\na major high-tech industrial center for Europe\u2019s economy, can only boast a population of about 1.4 million. Even\nwith a large population, the country is able to produce enough food for its domestic needs and for export profits.\nFrance leads Europe in agricultural production.\nFrance enjoys a robust economy and is one of the world\u2019s leading industrial producers. Its industrial pursuits are\ndiverse, including the manufacture of planes, trains, and automobiles, as well as textiles, telecommunications,\nfood products, pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, and mechanical equipment and 121 World Regional Geography\nmachine tools. Additionally, defense-related industries make up a significant sector of the economy. France\u2019s\nproduction of military weapons is recognized worldwide. The country has been a leader in the use of nuclear\nenergy to produce electricity. Nuclear energy supplies about 80 percent of the country\u2019s electricity, which reduces\nthe need for fossil fuels and imported oil.\nAgriculture is an important sector of the French economy, as it has been for centuries, and is tied to industry\nthrough food processing. Food processing industries employ more people than any other part of the French\nmanufacturing sector. If you think of cheese and wine when you think of France, you have identified two of its\nlargest food processing endeavors, along with sugar beets, meats, and confectionaries. World-renowned wines\nare produced in abundance, sometimes in areas that bear their names, such as in Burgundy, around the city of\nBordeaux, and in Champagne in the Loire Valley. French cuisine and fashion have long been held in highest\nesteem worldwide and are a source of national pride. Food and wine are important elements of the French way of\nlife, and each region of France boasts a suite of famous dishes.\nThanks to the climate and favorable soil conditions, agriculture is highly productive and lucrative for France.\nFrance is second only to the United States in terms of agricultural exports. Exports mainly go to other EU\ncountries, to the United States, and to some countries in Africa. The plains of northern France are excellent for\nwheat, which is grown on vast agricultural operations. Dairy products are a specialty in the western regions of\nFrance, which also produce pork, poultry, and apples. Beef cattle are raised in the central portion, where a cooler,\nwetter climate provides ample tracts of grasslands for grazing. Fruit, including wine grapes, is grown in the central\nand southern regions, as are vegetables. The region around the Mediterranean is blessed with hot, dry weather\nideal for growing grapes and other fruits and vegetables.\nSpecial Section: France\u2019s Home Front\nFrench governments have been challenged by the country\u2019s high unemployment rates. In response to decades of high\nunemployment, the French government has, over time, introduced legislation to try to distribute available work more\nevenly among the population. Long periods of unemployment and underemployment put France at risk of developing a\npermanent underclass, along with the social ills, including crime and political unrest, that come with it. The\nunemployment rate continues to be higher for women, and women tend to have lower-paying jobs. Additionally, women\nare underrepresented in government. France has a significant immigrant population, which means that, as in many\ncountries with newcomers, the settlement and integration of new arrivals is an issue. Some have blamed the high youth\ncrime rate not just on unemployment but on governmental failure to fully integrate immigrants into French society.\nAnother demographic matter is a strong rural-to-urban shift. As people move to the cities, rural areas are significantly 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 122\ndepopulated. Though more than seventy languages are spoken in France due to its large immigrant population, French\nhas been recognized as the official language by law. Eighty percent of French people identify themselves as Roman\nCatholics, though the percentage of practicing Catholics is much lower and declining. Approximately one-third of\nEurope\u2019s Jewish population resides in France. About 5 percent of the population self-identifies with Islam, which is a\ngrowing population because of immigrants from North Africa, some of whom are Muslim and tend to have larger\nfamilies. Most of these immigrants target the urban areas in search of employment and opportunity.\nIn 1995, France experienced three terrorist attacks, which killed eight people and wounded more than a hundred. The\nattacks were, of course, troubling, but the real issue before France is how to ensure that it does not become a breeding\nground for Islamic extremists bent on terrorist activity. The situation of unemployed, disenfranchised youth can provide\nthe perfect setting from which to attract new terrorist recruits. After decades of dealing with this type of unrest, France\npassed laws in response to the 1995 Islamic terrorist bombings that some civil libertarians found unsettling. Many forms\nof surveillance are legal and routine, including forms of surveillance that violate private communications. France also\npassed a law prohibiting \u201cassociation with wrong-doers involved in a terrorist enterprise.\u201d This gives French authorities\nthe right to arrest, detain, try, and convict anyone suspected of any crime that might be even remotely related to terrorist\nactivity. Balancing civil liberties with the quashing of terrorist plans has become a constant challenge for many\ncountries, including France.\nGermany\nGermany\u2019s location in Central Europe has meant that throughout history many peoples\u2014all with their own\ncultures, ideas, languages and traditions\u2014have traversed Germany at one time or another. Thus Germany\u2019s culture\nhas received many influences over the centuries.\nGermany\u2019s present geopolitical configuration is quite young, as it reunified the eastern and western portions into\na single entity in 1990. Germany was formed in 1871 during the leadership of Otto von Bismarck in an attempt\nto create a Germanic power base. World War I was fought during the last years of the German Empire. Germany,\nas part of the Central powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria), was defeated by the Allies with much\nloss of life. The German Republic was created in 1918 when, having been defeated in World War I, Germany was\nforced to sign the Treaty of Versailles.\nIn 1933, with an environment of poverty, disenfranchisement of the people, and great instability in the\ngovernment, Germany gave way to the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany. Within a mouth of\ntaking office, Hitler suspended normal rights and freedoms and assumed absolute power. A centralized totalitarian\nstate quickly resulted. In a move to expand Germany, Hitler started to expand its borders. Germany\u2019s invasion\nof Poland in 1939 kicked off what would become World War II. In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union 123 World Regional Geography\nand declared war on the United States. After Germany\u2019s defeat, the country was divided into East Germany,\ncontrolled by the Soviet Union, and West Germany, controlled by the Allied powers. The Iron Curtain divided the\ntwo Germanys, with the Berlin Wall dividing the city of Berlin. The Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall were major\nsymbols of the Cold War. In 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, and the two Germanys were reunited in 1990.\nToday, Germany is a vibrant country and an active EU member.\nFigure 2.23 President Ronald Reagan Speaking at the Brandenburg Gate, Germany, June 12, 1987\nFrom this speech comes his famous quote, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nGermany is Europe\u2019s largest economy, with strong exports of manufactured goods. To gain national income,\nGermany has promoted manufacturing as a major component of its economy. Most exports are in automobiles,\nmachinery, metals, and chemical goods. Germany has positioned itself strategically to take economic advantage\nof the growing global awareness of environmental issues and problems by focusing on improvements and\nmanufacturing of wind turbines and solar power technology. The service sector also contributes heavily to the 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 124\neconomy. Deutsche Bank holds the enviable position of being one of the most profitable companies on the Fortune\n500 list. Germany is also a major tourist destination. The Black Forest, Bavaria, the Alpine south, a variety of\nmedieval castles, national parks, and a vibrant assortment of festivals such as Oktoberfest attract millions of\ntourists to Germany every year.\nGerman reunification in 1990 posed some challenges for the economy. Notably, the East German infrastructure\nwas far behind that of the West. In an effort to update transportation systems, telecommunications, and other areas\nneeded to support industry and commerce, enormous amounts of money had to be poured into the system. While\nthere has been considerable success in the renewal of infrastructure, unemployment in former East Germany is\nstill significantly higher, and the necessary retraining of the workforce is ongoing and expensive.\nLanguage, religion, and education have been strong cultural forces in Germany. German is the official language of\nthe country and the one spoken by most of its people. More than 60 percent of Germans self-identify as Christian,\nand another 30 percent self-identify as agnostic or atheistic. During the Cold War, East Germany was under a\nCommunist government that promoted a nonreligious ideology, resulting in a high percentage of people with\nagnostic or atheistic beliefs in that part of Germany. Historically, there has been a strong connection between\nthe religious reformation and education. The early leaders of the Christian Reformation were generally highly\neducated themselves and were strong advocates of education, which they viewed as a path to positive moral and\nsocial reform. The German tradition of excellence in education continues. Education is provided at no cost (other\nthan taxation) to students at all levels, including the university level, though some universities are now starting to\ncharge very modest amounts for tuition.\nThe Alpine Center\nLandlocked in the center of Europe are the two main states of Switzerland and Austria. Sandwiched on the border\nof these two states is the ministate of Lichtenstein. This region is dominated by the Alpine ranges. Switzerland,\nofficially known as the Swiss Confederation, is divided into twenty-six cantons (states). Because of its location\nand close ties with neighboring countries, four languages are spoken in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and\nRomansh. Typically, one language predominates in any given canton. Berne is the country\u2019s capital, and Geneva,\nZurich, and Basel are the other major cities. As of 2010, Switzerland\u2019s population was about 7.8 million. Its land\narea is just slightly larger than the US state of Maryland.\nInternationally, Switzerland is well known for its political neutrality. The UN European offices are located there.\nThe Red Cross and the main offices of many international organizations are located in Switzerland. Switzerland 125 World Regional Geography\njoined the UN in 2002 and has applied for EU membership. Swiss culture is thought to have benefited from\nSwitzerland\u2019s neutrality. During times of war and political turmoil, creative people found refuge within the Swiss\nborders. Swiss banking practices and policies are known throughout the world, and Swiss banks have benefited\ngreatly from the country\u2019s politically neutral status. Banking is one of the country\u2019s top employers and sources of\nincome. The Swiss people enjoy a high standard of living.\nSports are popular in Switzerland and football, or soccer, is popular as it is in much of Europe. Switzerland has\nalso produced excellence in hockey, skiing, and of late, tennis. There is an emphasis on science in Swiss culture\nwith good historical reason: the field of modern chemistry originated in Switzerland. The Bernoulli family, famed\nfor their significant contributions to mathematics over many years, hails from Basel. The Federal Institute of\nTechnology in Z\u00fcrich, one of the top-ranked universities in the world, has produced an unusually high number of\nNobel Prize winners. Albert Einstein, though born in Germany, relocated to Switzerland and later became a Swiss\ncitizen.\nFigure 2.24 Einspaenner Coffee 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 126\nA Viennese specialty, it is a strong black coffee served in a glass and topped with whipped cream; it comes with\npowdered sugar, which is served separately.\nLachlan Hardy \u2013 Vienna Coffee \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAustria is larger than its neighbor Switzerland and is similar in area to the US state of South Carolina. In 2010, the\npopulation was estimated at 8.4 million. Austria has various Alpine ranges, with the highest peak at 12,457 feet\nin elevation. Only about a fourth of the land area is considered low lying for habitation. The Danube River flows\nthrough the country, including the capital city of Vienna. Austria has a well-developed social market economy and\na high standard of living.\nFor more than six hundred years, beginning just before the dawn of the fourteenth century, Austria was tightly\nassociated with its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs. The Hapsburgs came to power in a new way with the formation\nof the Austrian Empire in 1804. In Germany\u2019s rise to power before World War II, Hitler annexed his native Austria 127 World Regional Geography\nto Germany. Austria regained its independence a decade after the war ended and joined the EU in 1995. Austria is\na German-speaking country, and nearly the entire population self-identifies as ethnic Austrian.\nAustria is predominantly Roman Catholic and was home to many monasteries in the Middle Ages, influencing a\nstrong Austrian literary tradition. Austria\u2019s best-known cities are its capital of Vienna and Salzburg and Innsbruck.\nVienna was the center of the Habsburg and Austrian Empires and earned a place as one of the world\u2019s great cities.\nIt is famed for its baroque architecture; its music, particularly waltzes; and theater. The Habsburgs were great\npatrons of the arts, and hence music, drama, and art thrived for centuries in Austria. The country has been home\nto many famous composers and musicians and is the setting for the story behind the movie The Sound of Music.\nAustria has a worldwide reputation in music and the arts.\nThe British Isles\nThe British Isles are an archipelago (group of islands) separated from the European mainland by the English\nChannel. The British Isles are often included in the region of Western Europe when discussing political\ngeography; however, the fact that they are separated from the mainland of Europe by water provides them with\na separate identity. The British Isles consists of two separate, independent countries: the Republic of Ireland and\nGreat Britain. The United Kingdom (UK) of Great Britain consists of the regions of England, Scotland, Wales,\nand Northern Ireland. All four regions are now under the UK government. The Republic of Ireland is independent\nof the United Kingdom and does not include Northern Ireland. The primate city and UK capital is London, which\nis a financial center for Europe. The capital city of the Republic of Ireland is Dublin.\nFigure 2.25 London on the Thames River 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 128\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nInfluenced by the Gulf Stream, the climate of the British Isles is moderate, in spite of its northern latitude location.\nThe UK and Ireland are located above the fiftieth degree of latitude, which is farther north than the US-Canadian\nborder. The northern latitude would normally place this region into the type D climates, with harsher winters\nand more extreme seasonal temperatures. However, the surrounding water moderates temperature, creating the\nmoderate type C climate that covers most of the British Isles. The Gulf Stream pulls warm water from the tropics\nand circulates it north, off the coast of Europe, to moderate the temperature of Western Europe.\nThe Western Highlands and the Northern Lowlands dominate the islands. Scotland, Wales, and parts of England\nhave highland regions with short mountains and rugged terrain. The lowlands of southern England, Ireland, and\ncentral Scotland offer agricultural opportunities. The Pennines mountain chain runs through northern England and\nwas the source of the coal, ores, and waterpower that fueled the Industrial Revolution. To the east of Britain is the\nNorth Sea, which provided an abundance of petroleum resources (oil) for energy and wealth.\nThough the heritage of the British Isles is unique to this region, the geographic dynamics are similar to Central\nEurope\u2014that is, smaller families, urbanization, industrialization, high incomes, and involvement with economic\nglobalization. The EU has had an enormous influence on the British Isles. Ireland has embraced EU\u2019s economic\nconnections, but the British people have been hesitant to relinquish full autonomy to the EU. This reluctance can\nbe noted in the fact that the United Kingdom kept the British pound sterling as their currency standard after the\neuro currency was implemented. However, the Republic of Ireland converted to the euro currency.\nThe regions of the British Isles follow similar dynamics to those of other countries in Western Europe. Though\nsome regions are not as wealthy as others, they all demonstrate a high level of industrialization, urbanization, and\ntechnology. These urban societies have smaller families and higher incomes and are heavy consumers of energy,\ngoods, and services. Just as the Industrial Revolution attracted cheap labor, the aging workforce has enticed people\nfrom former British colonies to migrate to the United Kingdom in search of increased employment opportunities.\nThe mix of immigrants with the local heritage creates a diverse community. London has diverse communities with\nmany ethnic businesses and business owners. 129 World Regional Geography\nDevolutionary forces are active in the United Kingdom. Scotland and Wales are already governing with their own\nlocal parliaments. Devolutionary cultural differences can be noted by studying the different heritages found in\neach region. Just as the Welsh language is lingering in Wales, Gaelic continues in Ireland and Scotland. Each\nregion has made efforts to retain local heritage and rally support for its own nation-state. However, this is all done\nwith the overall perspective of remaining under the umbrella of the EU.\nNorthern England\nFigure 2.26 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 130\nThe first iron bridge ever built (1879) was located in central England, home of the Industrial Revolution.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nHome to the Industrial Revolution, major industrial cities such as Manchester and Birmingham brought together\nthe labor, raw materials, and industry connections necessary to manufacture products. The port city of Liverpool\ngave access to the world markets established by Britain\u2019s extensive colonial empire, and the colonies provided\nraw materials, new ideas, and cheap labor for the new industrial factories. Great Britain was an avid colonizer and\ncontrolled colonies on all inhabited continents. Raw materials such as cotton, which did not grow well in Britain,\nbecame a major import that fueled the textile mills of the Industrial Revolution.\nIndustrialization caused a rural-to-urban shift in Britain. In 1800, only 9 percent of the population lived in urban\nareas, but by 1900 some 62 percent resided in cities and towns. As of 2010, over 90 percent of Britain\u2019s population\nis composed of urban dwellers. The British colonial empire also caused a migration pattern whereby people\nmoved from colonies to the home country, with the core area located in the Midlands of northern England.\nCheap immigrant labor and resources from the colonies provided the manufacturing enterprises of wealthy British\nindustrialists with good fortunes. Raw cotton was brought in from the colonies of India and Egypt. Cheap labor,\nbrought in from the Caribbean and South Asia, resulted in a more diverse population in the industrialized northern\nEngland.\nAs the information age developed, the industrial centers of northern England gave way to a postindustrialized\nsouthern England. The north\u2019s heavy industries experienced a decline in demand. Factories closed, production\nbecame automated, and unemployment increased. The transition from the Industrial Revolution to a postindustrial\nsociety turned northern England into the Rust Belt of the British Isles. The port of Liverpool has been updated\nwith modern and automated systems that do not require the high level of manual labor that was necessary during\nearlier industrial times. Rail service connects Liverpool with London, which is connected to Paris through a tunnel\nunder the English Channel called the Chunnel. 131 World Regional Geography\nThe postindustrial economic activities have shifted the focus of employment away from manual labor to the\nservice sector of information. Many places have looked to tourism to boost their economic situation. Northern\nEngland has many attractive physical environments that have been developed into major tourist attractions. The\nLake District of northern England is a noted vacation destination, and short mountains and scenic landscapes\nattracted a number of England\u2019s writers. The city of Blackpool on the Irish Sea, just north of Liverpool, is a\nmajor vacation destination for the English. The dales and moors of northern England, complemented by the short\nPennines, provide a sharp contrast to the urban metropolitan landscapes of London and southern England.\nSouthern England\nAnchored by the primate city of London, southern England also is home to the universities of Oxford and\nCambridge. This is Great Britain\u2019s most affluent region and is a center of postindustrial activity. Located on the\nThames River, London is a central player in the world economic markets. Southern England also houses about\none-third of the UK population. With immigration from the former colonies, this region is also becoming more\ndiverse. This is an urbanized region, where the cost of living, transportation, and housing is high. For example,\nthe price of gasoline in the United Kingdom might be two or three times that in the United States. Many urban\ndwellers do not own automobiles but instead use public transportation.\nEngland is the most populous region of the United Kingdom with a density of about one thousand people per\nsquare mile. About half the population increase is because of immigration. The UK population is aging as a result\nof smaller family sizes and a growing number of senior citizens. This trend is common in countries in stage 5 of\nthe index of economic development. Immigrants from many parts of the world have targeted the England as their\nnew home. Many are from former British colonies in Asia and Africa. England has a diverse population. Islam is\nthe fastest growing religion, even though Muslims make up less than 10 percent of the total population. London\nis even home to a growing Sikh community. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 132\nFigure 2.27 London and the Seat of British Parliament\nThe clock tower of Big Ben is a local landmark.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nLondon is not only the primate city and capital of the United Kingdom; it is the largest administrative municipality\nin the entire EU. Only Paris has a larger overall metropolitan area. London is a global center that holds prominence\nin world markets and the globalization process. About one-fifth of Europe\u2019s largest corporations have their\nheadquarters in London. The city\u2019s cultural influence is felt around the world in the fashion industry, media,\nentertainment, and the arts. London is an international city that has a powerful draw for tourists. The core\neconomic region of Europe is anchored by London\u2019s international recognition.\nSouthern England is also home to Great Britain\u2019s seat of government The UK government is considered a\nconstitutional monarchy with a king or queen as head of state. The parliament is the official legislative body with\na prime minister as head of government. The parliament has two bodies: the House of Commons, whose members\nare elected, and the House of Lords, whose members are appointed for life. As head of state, the monarch is\nmainly a figurehead with little actual political power. A number of dependencies remain under the British Crown\nas far as sovereignty is concerned. Small islands such as Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, and various islands in\nthe Caribbean and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans remain under the British government for administrative, economic,\nand defense purposes. 133 World Regional Geography\nWales\nA highland region to the west of England, Wales holds a Celtic heritage in which the Welsh language and stories\nof coal mining can still be heard. However, the English language has become more dominant and tourism has\nreplaced coal mining as the main economic activity. The decline in the use of coal depressed the economy but did\nnot depress the culture and heritage of the Welsh people. The largest city and capital of Wales is Cardiff. In the\nearly twentieth century, the port of Cardiff handled the largest amount of coal in the world and handled more tons\nof cargo than Liverpool or London. The decline in coal mining has reduced the shipping activity in the port of\nCardiff in the twenty-first century.\nDevolution is alive and well in Wales. Welsh nationalism prompted the declaration of a separate parliament in\nthe capital of Cardiff. The break with London provided local autonomy, but Wales is still reliant on the United\nKingdom in national and foreign affairs. Many of the young people in Wales emigrate to find work because of the\ndepressed economy. Emigration has caused a leveling off of population growth, and the number of people who\nspeak Welsh has diminished. Wales and England share a common Protestant Christian religion. Wales is turning\nto tourism as a means of economic income; the scenic and picturesque landscape of the highland region, with its\nmany castles, provides a pleasant experience for tourists.\nScotland\nUnited with England in 1707, Scotland has been integrated into the United Kingdom while keeping its separate\nheritage and culture. Scotland has strong centripetal forces uniting the Scottish people, including victories over\nthe British by Scottish clans lead by William Wallace in 1297 and Robert the Bruce in 1314; these forces within\nScotland have created a devolutionary split with the UK parliament. In the quest to become a nation-state unto\nitself, in 1997 Scotland received permission to create its own parliament to govern local affairs. Though Scotland\nwould like to separate into an independent state, they do not wish to isolate themselves from the EU or greater\nEurope. This contradictory trend, in which local states want autonomy and self-rule yet also want to remain within\nthe larger regional community for economic and national security, is common. The phrase \u201cseparate within the\nUnion\u201d is surfacing in Europe with stronger voices. For now, Scotland remains under the British Crown and shares\na Protestant Christian heritage with its UK associates.\nThe Scottish Highlands provide for livestock production, and the central Scottish Lowlands are favorable for 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 134\nagriculture. The North Sea has extensive oil resources. With resources such as these, Scotland is in a position\nto gain wealth and support its small population of about five million people. As an early export product, scotch\nwhisky has profited many whisky marketers and has become the largest export product of Scotland. Scotland\nbenefited and gained wealth during the Industrial Revolution. As a part of an island, early shipbuilding produced\nships that brought about trade and development that coincided with European colonialism.\nPostindustrial activities have become a focus of the current economy. High-tech computer industries have\nconcentrated in Silicon Glen, an information-age industrial sector that lies between Scotland\u2019s largest city,\nGlasgow, and its capital of Edinburgh. With natural resources and postindustrial opportunities, Scotland is in\na good position to compete in the global economic community. Scottish banking firms reach around the globe\nthrough their investment holdings. Scotland attracts a healthy tourism market with its Highlands and many castles.\nKilts and bagpipes are a part of Scottish history and often distinguish themselves as a part of the region\u2019s heritage.\nThe game of golf originated in Scotland and is still popular today.\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is a place in which strong cultural forces often erupt into violence. Officially part of the United\nKingdom, this small region with about 1.7 million people has developed a unique set of cultural problems. Most\npeople consider the religious differences to be the main problem in Northern Ireland. People of Irish heritage are\npredominately Roman Catholic, and those of Scottish and English heritages are usually Protestant Christians. But\nit is not so simple. If the troubles (as they are called in the United Kingdom) in Northern Ireland were based\nsolely on religion, then we should expect to see similar violence in other regions of the United States or of Europe.\nThe core of the cultural problems in Northern Ireland is actually based on political affiliations. Most of the\npopulation in the region is not Irish. About 55 percent of the population is of Scottish or English descent, with\nonly about 45 percent of Irish descent. The real problem centers on the governing of Ireland. The Irish would\nlike to see Northern Ireland join with the Republic of Ireland, which received its independence from the British\nin 1921. The Irish do not want to be under the UK parliament with the Queen of England as head of state. Irish\ncountrymen want total independence from the United Kingdom. The non-Irish population does not want to be a\npart of the Republic of Ireland and its Irish parliament and would rather remain under the British Crown. The\npeople of Scottish descent would prefer total independence from all outside forces. English people definitely want\nto remain with the UK parliament. 135 World Regional Geography\nFigure 2.28 Protestant Group in a Belfast Parade Celebrating King William of Orange\nIrishFireside \u2013 Belfast Parades \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThough the real problem is political, religion has become the scapegoat. Because cultural differences can be\nclearly witnessed between Catholics and Protestants, religion has become the identifier of the two sides. They are\nnot necessarily fighting over religious beliefs but rather over political power and control.\nThe troubles of Northern Ireland have diminished its economic and employment opportunities. Underground\nparamilitary groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) have heightened tensions between the two\ngroups for decades, with car bombings and other terrorist acts. Hope might lie with a generational change in the\npopulation. As the younger generation seeks more opportunities and advantages, the issues that separate the two\nsides could diminish. The hatred that has been built up over the years can be eased with each new generation if\ncentripetal forces work to bridge the differences and unite the social fabric. If the killing and hatred are passed\ndown to successive generations, it will only take longer to recover.\nIn 1998, after a series of terrorist acts that were condemned on all sides, a movement took place to create\nthe Northern Ireland Assembly with members of both sides of the division. Obstacles continue to surface to\ndisrupt this calming process, but there is hope that in the future solutions such as this assembly can work toward\nproducing a lasting peace. The devolutionary forces active in Wales and Scotland may act to create a more\nseparate Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly was only one step. Progress in Northern Ireland is an\nuphill battle with high unemployment, a poor resource base, and few economic opportunities. Only by working\ntogether will Northern Ireland become a stable, peaceful part of the British Isles. 2.3 Regions of Western Europe 136\nThe Republic of Ireland\nThe whole island of Ireland was under the control of the British Crown for centuries. In 1921 independence was\ngained from the British for all but Northern Ireland. This bitterly fought conflict has become well entrenched in\nIrish culture and literature. As an independent country separate from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland\nhas ascended the economic ladder to become a part of the global economic community. Because the climate is\ntype C, there is adequate rainfall for crops and vegetation, and the green landscape gives it the title, \u201cThe Emerald\nIsle.\u201d The island has few other natural resources. There are trees but no large forest reserves for commercial\nexploitation. Peat, which is an early version of coal, is cut from the bogs and burned as fuel.\nIreland is not a large country. It is just a bit larger than the US state of West Virginia, with a population of about\nfour million. There are no tall mountain ranges in Ireland. The soils are traditionally rocky with few nutrients.\nBefore colonial times, the traditional food crops included such turnips and rutabagas. When the potato was\nimported from the Americas, it was well received in Ireland. The potato plant grew well and replaced traditional\nroot crops as the main food source.\nIn the early 1800s the population of the whole of Ireland (including what is now Northern Ireland) was as high\nas eight million. Starting in the 1840s, blight and rot destroyed much of the potato crop year after year, causing\na serious famine in Ireland. More than a million people died, and another two million people left the island. The\npotato famine caused losses reminiscent of the Black Death, which had ravaged Europe centuries earlier. The\nhistory of the Black Death may have led to the term Black Irish, which referred to people who fled Ireland during\nthe potato famine and immigrated to the United States. They were often regarded as lower-class citizens and were\ndiscriminated against. Well-established Irish families having immigrated to the United States before the 1840s\nwere not considered Black Irish and assimilated into mainstream American society more easily.\nThe lack of natural resources and the lack of opportunities and advantages held back the Republic of Ireland from\ndeveloping a strong economy. It wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that conditions improved. With the creation of the EU and\nadvancements in communication, Ireland became an ideal location for expanding North American corporations.\nThe attractive elements included a mild climate, a similar English language, an educated workforce, and a low cost\nof living. Many high-tech computer firms, communication companies, and automated industries established their\nbase of operations in Ireland\u2014Dublin in particular. Because Ireland was a member of the EU, it was a convenient\nintermediary location between the United States and the European mainland. Business boomed in the 1990s, and\nincomes and the cost of living rose. Tourism also has become a growing sector of the economy. The economic\ngrowth in Ireland earned it the title Celtic Tiger to indicate its growing economic power.\nHowever, the rapidly expanding economic conditions of the 1990s have not extended into the twenty-first\ncentury. Since 2007, the global depression has taken its toll on the Irish economy. Starting in 2008, the country\nwitnessed a sharp increase in unemployment that coincided with serious banking scandals. Various banks have\nbeen targeted for bailout funds from the government, and the economy witnessed a sharp decline. Property values\nhave plummeted, and protesters have staged demonstrations in the streets demanding the government address the\neconomic situation. Tourism has taken up some of the slack and has expanded by highlighting the Emerald Isle\u2019s\nmild climate and green countryside. Cities such as Dublin are working with the growing pains of recovery in\nthe economic recession. Unemployment remains a concern, as well as declining economic opportunities. Overall,\nIreland is working to reposition itself for future economic growth. The country wants to maintain itself as an 137 World Regional Geography\nimportant link in the EU\u2019s relationship with the United States. Ireland is bracing itself for a sluggish economic\nroad ahead.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Western Europe can be divided into a number of smaller geographic regions, including northern Europe,\nsouthern Europe, Central Europe, and the British Isles.\n\u2022 The differences in climate, terrain, and natural resources provide for a diversity of economic activities that\ninfluence cultural development within the European community.\n\u2022 The countries of Western Europe have high standards of living compared with world standards. The\nsouthern countries of Portugal, Greece, and southern Italy are more agrarian and have been struggling\neconomically since the global recession began in 2007.\n\u2022 The British Isles comprise the two independent countries of Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Great\nBritain is made up of five geographical regions, with Wales and Scotland having more autonomy to govern\nlocal affairs.\n\u2022 Since World War II, the many states of Western Europe have been evolving into a more integrated realm.\nEach nation has worked to develop its economy to take advantage of its physical geography and its cultural\nhistory and heritage. Devolutionary forces remain strong in many areas to counterbalance the forces of\nsupranationalism.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Understand the cultural and political geography of former Yugoslavia and how the drive for nationalism and\nnation-state status has fractured and divided the region.\nFigure 2.29 Eastern Europe\n139 2.4 Eastern Europe 140\nTransitions of Eastern Europe after the Cold War\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, Europe was divided into Western Europe and Eastern Europe by the Iron\nCurtain. Eastern Europe fell under the influence of the Soviet Union, and the region was separated from the\nWest. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, all the Soviet Republics bordering Eastern Europe declared\nindependence from Russia and united with the rest of Europe. The transition Eastern Europe has experienced in\nthe last few decades has not been easy; however, most of the countries are now looking to Western Europe for 141 World Regional Geography\ntrade and economic development. Cooperation continues between Eastern and Western Europe, and the European\nUnion (EU) has emerged as the primary economic and political entity of Europe.\nThe collapse of Communism and the Soviet Union led to upheaval and transition in the region of Eastern Europe\nin the 1990s. Each country in the region was under Communist rule. The countries bordering Russia were once\npart of the Soviet Union, and those countries not part of the Soviet Union were heavily influenced by its dominant\nposition in the region. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the bordering countries declared independence\nand began the process of integration into the European community. Moldavia changed its name to Moldova. The\ncountries of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia each broke into multiple countries and, because of the diverse ethnic\npopulations, organized around the concept of nation-states. (See Section 2.2.6 \u201cNation-States and Devolution\u201d for\na discussion of nation-states.) Czechoslovakia peacefully agreed to separate into two states: the Czech Republic\nand the Republic of Slovakia. Yugoslavia was not so fortunate.\nMost Eastern European political borders resemble ethnic boundaries. Each of the regions once resembled nation-\nstates. In principle, Romania is set apart for Romanians, Hungary for Hungarians, and so on. Few are true nation-\nstates because of ethnic minorities located within their borders, but the countries held on to their common heritage\nthroughout the Communist era. In most Eastern European countries, cultural forces have brought people together\nto publicly support the move to unite and hold onto a heritage that is as old as Europe itself.\nGovernments that had been controlled by Communist dictators or authoritarian leaderships before 1991 were\nopened up to democratic processes with public elections. With the fall of Communism came economic reforms\nthat shifted countries from central planning to open markets. Under central planning, the governments dictated\nwhich products were produced and how many of each were to be produced. The open markets invited private\ncapitalism and western corporate businesses.\nFigure 2.30 Reforms in Eastern Europe in the 1990s 2.4 Eastern Europe 142\nThe power of the state was transferred from the Communist elite to the private citizen. People could vote for their\npublic officials and could choose businesses and work individually. With the EU looming over the realm, the now-\nindependent countries of Eastern Europe shifted their economic direction away from Moscow and the collapsing\nCommunist state and toward the core industrial countries of Western Europe and the EU.\nThe stage for the transition from communism to capitalism was further set by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,\nwho began to liberalize the Soviet Union by allowing multiparty elections and encouraging economic reform\nand societal openness (concepts known throughout the world by the Russian words perestroika and glasnost,\nrespectively). At the same time, the world watched as the Chinese government violently cracked down on student\nprotests in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, which strengthened the revolutionary sentiments and intentions\nof many people in the Eastern bloc, the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe. 143 World Regional Geography\nCountries of Eastern Europe\nHungary\nDuring the Communist period, Hungary enjoyed a higher standard of living than its neighbors. It was likely the\nmarked contrast in daily life between the Communist period and the post-Communist period that influenced the\noutcome of the 1994 elections, which gave the Hungarian Socialist Party, led by former Communists, an absolute\nmajority in parliament. Many were concerned that Hungary was signaling a wish to return to the past, but instead,\nall three main political parties joined together to work toward the common goals of continued liberalization of the\neconomy, closer ties with the West, and full EU membership.\nEconomic reforms have not been easy for Hungary and have resulted in a lower standard of living for most people.\nThe removal of government subsidies, a pillar of Communist rule, led to recession. To avoid massive inflation and\nattract investment, government fiscal policies had to be conservative to the point of austerity. Hungary\u2019s large-\nscale manufacturing and stable government have aided it through the latest global economic downturn.\nAn important characteristic of post-Communist Hungary is its desire to become an active member of the global\ncommunity by joining international organizations. In 1990, Hungary was the first Eastern bloc nation to join\nthe Council of Europe. In 2004, Hungary joined the EU. In addition, Hungary joined the other international\norganizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Another endeavor that would not\nhave been possible under the Communist rule was the development of tourism as an important economic sector.\nBudapest\u2019s reputation as a city of great elegance has helped it become one of the major tourist attractions in\nEastern Europe. Major movie studios have also traveled to the city to film. 2.4 Eastern Europe 144\nFigure 2.31 Parliament Building in Budapest, Hungary, Next to the Danube River\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (Slovakia)\nEach country in Eastern Europe has a different story to tell regarding its path from communism to independence.\nCountries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary were more prepared and better equipped to meet the\nchallenges and were early qualifiers for entry into the EU. Historically, the region occupied by the modern Czech\nRepublic was known as Bohemia and Moravia. The Czech Republic and Slovakia were, until recently, part of the\nsame country: Czechoslovakia, which was created in 1918 from part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World\nWar II ended. On January 1, 1993, they became two new independent nations. Slovakia is known officially as the\nSlovak Republic.\nCzechs and Slovaks alike descended from Slavic peoples. The national language of the Czech Republic is Czech,\nwhile the official language of Slovakia is Slovakian. Both languages are in the Slavic linguistic family. About 94\npercent of the population of the Czech Republic identify themselves as ethnically Czech. The others are Slovenian,\nPolish, German, Hungarian, and Roma (Gypsy). About 86 percent of the inhabitants of Slovakia self-identify as\nethnically Slovakian. Hungarians make up the largest minority population, and about 2 percent of the population\nidentify themselves as Roma. 145 World Regional Geography\nUnder Communist rule, the standard of living was very high in Czechoslovakia. When market reforms began in\nthe Czech Republic and Slovakia, the standard of living declined to some extent. In general, the Czech Republic\nhas more rapidly and effectively transferred state control of industry to private ownership than has Slovakia. Also,\nSlovakia was hit harder by the move away from defense industries, which had employed many people during the\nCommunist period. Unemployment has consistently been higher in Slovakia. Slovakia is not as industrialized as\nthe Czech Republic but has made strides since independence to provide economic opportunities for its people.\nBoth countries expanded their economic opportunities when they were admitted into the EU in 2004.\nThe Baltic Republics\nThe small Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania transitioned away from their old Soviet connections.\nAfter independence, they were quick to look toward Western Europe for trade and development. Most Eastern\nEuropean countries followed this pattern. Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania received their independence from\nthe Soviet Union in 1991. Russia withdrew its troops from the region in 1994. The North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the EU welcomed them as members in 2004. They have transitioned to market\neconomies with democratic governments. The people of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania rapidly expanded their\neconomic conditions after independence but have been hard hit by the downturn in the global marketplace in\n2008.\nPoland\nPoland has a long-standing history of working to oppose the Communist domination of its country. The 2.4 Eastern Europe 146\nSolidarity movement in Poland started out as an independent trade union in the 1980s but became a lightning\nrod for political change in Poland. The Communist Party dominated politics and suppressed any movement to\norganize labor or the people against the government. The strength of Solidarity became evident by the 1990\nelection, when Solidarity candidate Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa won the Poland\u2019s presidential election. Solidarity\u2019s victory\nsignified the collapse of the power of the Soviet Union and Communism in Eastern Europe. The country has\nemerged with democratic government and a thriving capitalist economy.\nSince the fall of Communism, Poland left behind its old state-directed economy and transitioned to a market\neconomy, in which businesses are privately owned and run. When the Communists controlled Poland, there was\na strong emphasis on heavy industry, and that focus remains alive today. Poland produces cars, buses, helicopters,\ntrains, and heavy military equipment, including tanks and ships. Before the Communists industrialized the Polish\neconomy, it was largely agrarian. Though Poland continues to be one of Europe\u2019s leading agricultural producers,\nwith a wide variety of crops and dairy and meat production, it is unable to meet the food demands of its large\npopulation. Poland\u2019s economy is still considered to be under development. Reforms, including privatization, must\ncontinue before Poland can adopt the euro, the common EU currency.\nFigure 2.32 Royal Castle Square in Warsaw, Poland\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain. 147 World Regional Geography\nUnemployment has at times presented very significant problems for the Polish economy and society.\nUnemployment skyrocketed to nearly 20 percent in the early 1990s. The situation improved, but unemployment\nwas still at about 14 percent in 2006. By 2010 the situation improved further, and the unemployment rate was\naround 7 percent. When Poland joined the EU, many people left Poland in search of work. Some of those workers\nwho left have recently returned, as the employment rate and wages are both increasing substantially.\nMoldova\nA variety of cultural and social forces provided different levels of civility in the transitions of Eastern Europe. The\npoor, agrarian economy of the small, landlocked country of Moldova provides few opportunities or advantages to\ngrow its economy and provide a stronger future for its people. As a result, young people earning an education or\ntechnical skills immigrate to other countries for opportunities or employment.\nBelarus\nIn 1991, independence came to the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, but Belarus took a different path from\nmost of the other Eastern bloc countries in that Belarus did not distance itself from its Russian connection. Belarus\nhas consequently experienced authoritarian governments well into the twenty-first century. In this case, Russia\nand Belarus created a stronger relationship by signing agreements to increase economic integration. Difficulties\nhave hindered implementation of many of these policies. For one thing, the government of Belarus has been slow\nto move toward democratic reforms. In fact, the president has taken on greater authoritarian powers. Some of the\npersonal freedoms that have been granted in other European countries\u2014freedom of the press, free speech, and the 2.4 Eastern Europe 148\nright to peacefully assemble\u2014are still restricted in Belarus. As of 2010, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova have not\nbeen admitted into the EU. Belarus has indicated that it might join with the Russian Republic and has not even\napplied for entry into the EU.\nUkraine\nWith the largest physical area in Europe, Ukraine is slightly larger than France. Its population in 2010 was\napproximately forty-six million, and 77 percent of the population is ethnically Ukrainian and 17 percent is\nRussian. Most of the population live in the industrial regions of the southeast or eastern parts of the country.\nThough the official language is Ukrainian, many Ukrainians still speak Russian. As is the case with neighboring\nstates, the Eastern Orthodox Church dominates the religious and cultural reflections of the arts, literature, and\narchitecture. Christian themes are often reflected in the paintings, books and performances.\nThe demographic trend in Ukraine follows a pattern of industrialization with smaller family sizes but continues\nto have a higher death rate than most European countries. The country is now losing about 150,000 people per\nyear. The low birth rates are similar to those of Russia and southern Europe. Poor health and childhood poverty\nin Ukraine are two of the main issues confirmed by the United Nations (UN). In 2010, Ukraine had a negative\npopulation growth rate of \u22120.62 percent. Fertility rates have been in decline throughout Europe over the past few\ndecades. The average fertility rate in Ukraine is 1.1, one of the world\u2019s lowest; in Europe as a whole, the average\nis about 1.3. The causes for some of these trends can be attributed to alcoholism, poor diets, smoking, and the lack\nof medical care. The average life expectancy for an adult male in Ukraine is about sixty-two years. In comparison,\nthe average life expectancy for men in France is about seventy-eight years.\nOf the former Soviet Union republics, excluding Russia, Ukraine was far and away the most important economic\ncomponent, producing about four times the output of the next-ranking Soviet republic. Its fertile black soil\ngenerated more than one-fourth of the overall Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial\nquantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied\nsteel pipes and raw materials to Russia\u2019s oil and mining industry. Ukraine\u2019s political relationship with Russia has\nbeen complicated since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but Russia still supplies enormous amounts of natural\ngas and oil to fuel the economy, and Russia\u2019s markets are still highly integrated with those of Ukraine.\nThough Ukraine has transitioned from a Soviet republic to a fully independent country, divisive centrifugal forces\nhave made Ukraine\u2019s path to free elections and democratically elected leaders difficult. The country has held\npolitical elections, but they have been challenged or tainted with corruption and accusations of fraud. Today, the 149 World Regional Geography\ncountry has a democratically elected government and is working toward improving its economy and creating\nstability for its people.\nRomania\nA number of countries of Eastern Europe have fully transitioned from Communist dictatorships to modern,\nintegrated economies. Romania is one of those countries. Romania encompasses an area equivalent to the US\nstate of Minnesota. Its population of 21.5 million people includes two million who live in Bucharest, the capital\nand largest city of the country. The Carpathian Mountains circle Romania, with the Transylvanian Alps to the\nsouth. The Danube River runs across the region and creates a natural border with Bulgaria and Serbia before\nflowing into the Black Sea. The Romanian forests are some of the largest in Europe, with about half (13 percent\nof the country) set aside from logging and placed in watershed conservation programs. The integrity of the\necosystems in the Romanian forests provide diverse habitats for plants and animals. Romania claims to have the\nmost European brown bears and about 40 percent of all European wolves living within its borders.\nTourism is growing in Romania. Almost 5 percent of Romania is placed in protected areas, including thirteen\nnational parks and three biosphere reserves, all of which are attractive to tourists. Tourist attractions also\ninclude medieval castles as well as historic Transylvanian cities. Rural tourism focuses on folklore and traditions\nincluding such sites as Bran Castle, referred to locally as the castle of Dracula, a mythical person patterned after\nthe stories and legends of Vlad III the Impaler.\nFigure 2.33 Bran Castle Near Brasov in Transylvania 2.4 Eastern Europe 150\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nRomania\u2019s Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, ruled from 1965 to 1989. The end of his domination came\nwhen the government was overthrown by a revolution. Ceau\u015fescu and his wife were arrested and shot to death.\nEven after his death, the Communist Party maintained strong ties to the government until the mid-1990s.\nThe transition to integrate Romania\u2019s economy with that of the greater European economy was delayed because of\nRomania\u2019s obsolete industrial infrastructure, established during the Communist era. Since joining the EU in 2007,\nRomania has developed a stronger export market with Western European countries. Investments and consumer\nconfidence have fueled the growth of the domestic economy. Romania has worked through a number of difficult\nissues in its attempts to provide a stable government and a growing market economy.\nAlbania\nThe southern Adriatic is home to the small country of Albania. The rugged mountainous country of Albania has\na Muslim majority. Poverty, unemployment, and a lack of opportunities to gain wealth have plagued the country. 151 World Regional Geography\nAlbania has even received Communist support from China. As a result of the war in Kosovo, Albania suffered a\nmajor setback in its progress toward an improved standard of living and integration with the rest of Europe. When\nstability is established, Albania can progress toward becoming more integrated with the European economy and\nraise its standard of living for its people. A parliamentary democracy has been installed since the Communist era,\nand foreign investments have aided in developing updated transportation and power grids.\nBulgaria\nLocated in the crossroads of the continents, Bulgaria has a major trans-European corridor running through its\nterritory that connects all the way to Asia. The country is home to diverse landscapes, which include the sunny\nBlack Sea coast and the higher elevations of the Balkan Mountains, which reach an elevation of 9,596 feet. The\nDanube River flows across the border with Bulgaria on its way to the Black Sea. About one-third of the country\nconsists of plains, which provide for extensive agricultural activity. Ore and minerals can also be found in Albania,\nwhich has allowed the country to gain wealth.\nUpon declaring independence from Russia, Bulgaria held multiparty elections. Its economy is emerging, but the\ntransition to a capitalist system has not been without the difficulties of unemployment, inflation, and corruption.\nBulgaria became a member of NATO in 2004 and was accepted for EU membership in 2007. The transition to a\nfree market economy is still in progress, with mining, industry, and agriculture as the main economic activities.\nTourism is an emerging segment of the economy that has been gaining international attention in recent years. The\ncountry has a milder climate than the northern states of Eastern Europe and has been marketing itself as a major\ntourist destination. Main points of interest include historical monasteries, coastal resorts on the Black Sea, and the\ncapital city of Sofia. 2.4 Eastern Europe 152\nSpecial Section: A Story of \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d in Bulgaria\nHere is an example of cultural differences between the United States and Bulgaria. This story is from Elizabeth Kelly, a\nUS Peace Corps volunteer working in Bulgaria (2003\u20135).\n\u201cI\u2019ll have coffee,\u201d I tell the waitress at a cafe during my first week in Bulgaria. She shakes her head from side to\nside. \u201cOK, tea,\u201d I say, thinking that maybe there\u2019s something wrong with the coffee machine. Again, she shakes her\nhead. \u201cUm. cola?\u201d Once more, she shakes her head. By now, she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m crazy, and I\u2019m totally\nconfused. Then I remember: A shake of the head by a Bulgarian means \u201cyes,\u201d and a nod\u2014what the rest of the world\ndoes for \u201cyes\u201d\u2014means \u201cno.\u201d\nEarly on, when I communicated with Bulgarians, it seemed like my head was moving in ways my brain hadn\u2019t told it\nto. Sometimes I wanted to grab my ears and use them as controls. Learning a language with a completely different\nalphabet was challenging enough without trying to figure out whether to nod or shake.\nWhen I began teaching, all this head bobbing made communication in the classroom interesting. Although I had\nmade sure my students knew about this cultural difference on the first day of school, we all frequently forgot what\nwe were doing. My students would answer a question correctly or say something really great, and I\u2019d nod. A second\nlater, they were trying to change their answer, since they thought the nod meant they had been wrong. But the\nconfusion went both ways. Sometimes I\u2019d ask a student a yes-or-no question and he or she would answer with a nod\nor a shake, without saying anything. Not remembering the difference, we\u2019d have to go through the motions several\ntimes before I understood. Frequently I found myself saying, \u201cDa or ne\u2014just tell me one or the other!\u201d\nI also had to deal with confused colleagues who couldn\u2019t figure out why I kept nodding my head while they talked,\nas if I were arguing with them. In truth, I was just trying to show that I understood and was following along with the\nstory. And then there was the even greater problem of how to act with Bulgarians who spoke English and were aware\nof the nodding\u2013shaking problem. Was I supposed to nod or shake for \u201cyes\u201d when I was speaking English with them?\nAnd what was I supposed to do when we were speaking Bulgarian? What if we were in a situation where both\nlanguages were being spoken? To make matters even more complicated, after going a couple of weeks without any\ncontact with other Americans, we\u2019d finally get together and I\u2019d find myself shaking when I should have been\nnodding. My head was spinning!\nTuning in to how the people around me communicate has brought me closer to the people and the culture of\nBulgaria. And whenever we slip up and forget to control our heads, the laughter that follows brings us together.\nLuckily, a smile is a smile the world over.\nSource: Peace Corps Coverdell World Wise Schools program.

Non-Slavic populations\nsurround Yugoslavia. The region\u2019s core is mountainous. The Dinaric Alps, with the highest peak at just below nine\nthousand feet in elevation, run through the center of the Balkan Peninsula. The rugged mountains separate and\nisolate groups of Slavic people who, over time, have formed separate identities and consider themselves different\nfrom those on the other sides of the mountain ridges. Distinct subethnic divisions developed into the Slovenes,\nMacedonians, Bosnians, Montenegrins, Croats, and Serbs, with various additional groups. These differences led\nto conflict, division, and war when the breakup of former Yugoslavia began.\nWorld War I started in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia, when a Serb advocate assassinated Archduke Ferdinand of\nthe Austria-Hungarian Empire. In the next conflict, World War II, there was also divisiveness within Yugoslavia:\nCroatia sided with Nazi Germany, but Serbia was an ally with the Communist Soviet Union. The region of\nBosnia, with a Muslim majority, faced religious opposition from its mainly Christian neighbors. A group headed\nby Marshal Tito (a.k.a. Josip Broz) led Yugoslavia after World War II ended in 1945. Tito created a Communist\nstate that attempted to retain its own brand of neutrality between the Warsaw Pact nations led by the Soviet Union\nand the NATO nations of the West.\nTito was a centripetal force for the region of Yugoslavia. For over forty years, he held the many ethnic Slavic\ngroups together under what he called Brotherhood and Unity, which was actually the threat of brute military force.\nIt appears to have been effective. The 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo as witness to the progress\nand unity of Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia. At the same time, Yugoslavia started manufacturing a model of automobiles called\nthe Yugo. While the Yugo was not in the same league as high-end European luxury cars, the ability to make and\npurchase automobiles was a testimony to the rising industrial level of the Yugoslav economy. This progressive\ntrend, unfortunately, was not to last. 2.4 Eastern Europe 154\nFigure 2.34 The Balkan Peninsula and Former Yugoslavia\nMacedonia is officially called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) because of a name conflict with Greece. Albania is an independent country and was never\na part of Yugoslavia.\nTable 2.3 Status of States in Former Yugoslavia 155 World Regional Geography\nYear of World War\nCountry Religion Population Size (Sq.

Its status is pending.\nThe Breakup of Former Yugoslavia\nTito died in 1980. The unity that had helped hold the country together began to break down in the early 1990s\nwith the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. With the dual loss of the Soviet Union and Tito\u2019s strong policies as centripetal\nforces, the power struggle for dominance among the various ethnic groups began.\nIn 1991, Slobodan Milo\u0161evik began pushing for the nationalistic goal of uniting all the ethnic Serbs that lived in\nthe various parts of Yugoslavia into a Greater Serbia. The efforts were not approved or supported by the UN,\nwhich rejected Yugoslavia for membership in 1992. At that time, Kosovo and Montenegro were part of the Serb\nstate. Milo\u0161evik first sent the Yugoslav military to Kosovo to take control from the majority Albanian population\nand secure the region for Greater Serbia. Fearing war, Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia declared independence\nin 1991. Yugoslavia was breaking up.\nMilo\u0161evik then moved into Croatia to secure Serb areas for his Greater Serbia. After a brief but bitter war between\nSerbia and Croatia, the UN stepped in to halt the conflict. The first signs of ethnic cleansing were reported during 2.4 Eastern Europe 156\nthis conflict. Serb military units would roll into a town or village and claim it as a Serb-only location. The Croats\nand any other people living there were forced to leave. Reports of assaults on women and the systematic killing\nof men of fighting age were documented. Sadly, ethnic cleansing began to be reported on all sides of the war. The\nbitter hatred between Croats and Serbs, which had been handed down from the World War II era, surfaced for a\nnew generation. After the UN stopped Milo\u0161evik in Croatia, he turned to the Serb areas of Bosnia to expand his\nGreater Serbia. Bosnia immediately declared independence and was approved by the UN in 1992.\nThe bitter battle for Bosnia extended from 1992 to 1995, and Europe wondered if the Bosnian war would develop\ninto World War III. The region of Bosnia included people of Serb, Croat, and Bosnian ethnic backgrounds. Bosnia\nbroke up along ethnic lines. The Serb group supported Greater Serbia; the Bosnian group wanted independence.\nIn March 1994, the Croat group signed an agreement joining with the Bosnian group against the Serbs. In 1995,\nwith strong pressure from Europe and the United States, the warring groups signed a peace agreement known\nas the Dayton Accord, named after a meeting in Dayton, Ohio. The Dayton Accord accepted Bosnia\u2019s borders\nand supported the creation of a unity government that was democratic and included the multiethnic groups. The\ncountry of Bosnia was divided into three parts: Serb, Croat, and Bosnian.\nFigure 2.35 Street Checkpoint in Kosovo in 2004 157 World Regional Geography\nU.S. Military \u2013 public domain.\nMilitary forces continue to monitor and secure the regions of Bosnia. Portions of Bosnia under Serb control\nhave declared themselves the Republic of Srpska and have attempted to create their own nation-state. The\nremaining territory of Bosnia (51 percent) consists of a joint Bosnian\/Croat federation. Both regions have sublevel\ngovernments within the formal country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzegovina is a small region extending from\nthe city of Mostar to the southern border with Montenegro. In June of 2006, the region of Montenegro declared\nitself independent of Serbia. Montenegro uses the euro as its currency and has applied for WTO membership.\nMontenegro has privatized its main industries and is soliciting a tourism industry. 2.4 Eastern Europe 158\nThe War for Kosovo\nYugoslavia, under the leadership of President Milo\u0161evik, sought to ensure that Kosovo would never leave the\numbrella of Greater Serbia. The 1.8 million Albanian Muslims who lived in Kosovo constituted 90 percent of the\npopulation by 1989. They did not want to live under Serb control. Serbia claimed that Kosovo was the heart of\nthe Serb Orthodox Church and the cradle of the medieval Serbian Empire. The historic battles against the Islamic\nTurkish Ottoman Empire in Kosovo have been memorialized in Serb tradition and history.\nThe main opposition to the Serb power structure in Kosovo in the early 1990s was the Kosovo Liberation Army\n(KLA). Many in the KLA wanted an independent Kosovo and an alliance with Albania. In 1998, Milo\u0161evik sent\ntroops into areas controlled by the KLA. The civil war in Kosovo between Serbs and Albanian Muslims was\ndevastating the region and creating thousands of refugees. The tension, hatred, and massacres by both forces\nfurther complicated the peace process. In March of 1999, NATO implemented a unified mission, called Operation\nAllied Force, to force Milo\u0161evik to discontinue the ethnic cleansing campaign and end the violence in Kosovo.\nIn June of 1999, Milo\u0161evik yielded to a peace agreement that brought Kosovo under the auspices of the UN and\nNATO forces, removed the Serb military, and allowed for the safe return of over eight hundred thousand refugees\nfrom Albania, Montenegro, and Macedonia. Milo\u0161evik lost his bid for the presidency in the elections of 2000, was\narrested for crimes against humanity in 2001, and was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal in The\nHague, the Netherlands. The charges brought against him included ethnic cleansing and torture. He died in 2006\nwhile in custody before the trial ended.\nFigure 2.36\nThe wars in former Yugoslavia were fueled by strong cultural forces.\nNATO forces continue to be stationed in Kosovo to keep the peace and work toward restoring order. After much\nnegotiation between the UN and regional entities, the Kosovo Assembly declared its independence from Serbia\nin 2008. Serb officials overwhelmingly opposed Kosovo\u2019s independence, as they had in 1991. Kosovo\u2019s status is\nnow pending in the UN. 159 World Regional Geography\nConclusion of Former Yugoslavia\nKosovo and the independent republics of former Yugoslavia provide an excellent study in the dynamics of\nethnicity, culture, and political geography. The lessons learned from this region could be applied to many other\nareas of the world suffering similar conflicts, such as Chechnya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Congo\/Zaire, or East\nTimor. Former Yugoslavia represents an example of how divisive centrifugal and devolutionary forces can lead\nto nationalism and eventually to war. The drive toward a nation-state has fueled nationalism and conflict in the\nBalkans. The civil wars within former Yugoslavia have cost thousands of lives and destroyed an infrastructure\nthat had taken decades to build. Geographers have called Eastern Europe a shatterbelt because of the conflicts\nand divisions that have occurred there.\nIn spite of the problems with the transition in Eastern Europe, the region has nonetheless seen enormous economic\ngains. Even Slovenia, once part of former Yugoslavia, has rebounded with strong economic growth. Many of the\nprogressive Eastern European countries have been accepted into the EU. The map of the EU includes many of the\ndeveloping Eastern bloc countries. Eastern Europe has experienced many transitions throughout its history. The\ntransition from communism to capitalism is only one part of the geography and history of Eastern Europe.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 After World War II ended in 1945, Europe was divided into Western Europe and Eastern Europe by the Iron\nCurtain. Western Europe promoted capitalist democracies, and Eastern Europe came under the Communist\ninfluence of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Eastern Europe began to\ntransition toward Western European ideals.\n\u2022 Eastern Europe has been shifting toward democratic governments, open market economies, private\nownership, and the EU rather than the old Soviet Union.\n\u2022 Countries with stable governments and industrial potential have been accepted into the EU and have\nexpanding economies. Other countries that have not reached that level of economic development or political\nreforms have not been admitted into the EU.\n\u2022 The transition of former Soviet republics to capitalist systems has not been without difficulties, including\nunemployment, inflation, corruption and crime, and poverty. Political infighting has been evident in the\ntransitioning countries that do not yet have a stable democratic government or economy.\n\u2022 The breakup of former Yugoslavia was an example of how strong devolutionary forces can promote\nnationalism resulting in open war. The once stable country of Yugoslavia split into seven separate countries\npatterned after the nation-state concept. Bosnia remains the most diverse state, with a majority Muslim\npopulation.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

The\nRussian segment of the European continent is usually studied with Russia as a whole. Europe is bordered by\nthe Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.\n\u2022 The Gulf Stream helps create a type C climate for much of Western Europe. Type D climates dominate the\nnorth and eastern portions of Eastern Europe. Europe has four main physical landforms that provide a\ndiversity of resources for human activity.\n\u2022 European colonialism brought increased wealth and economic activity to Western Europe. The Industrial\nRevolution also began here. Europe developed into an industrialized realm with powerful economic forces\nthat continue to drive the postindustrial engine of globalization. Rural-to-urban shift and urbanization were\nproducts of industrialization. The result for Europe has been smaller families and higher incomes.\n\u2022 The Roman Empire created early networks of infrastructure for southern Europe, while the Vikings\nconnected northern Europe through trade and warfare. The latest attempt to unify the European nations is\nthrough supranationalism in the formation of the European Union (EU). Countries that have strong\neconomies and stable governments are allowed to join the EU.\n\u2022 Western Europe can be divided into various geographic regions based on the points of the compass. The\ndistinctions often relate to the type of economic activity the people are engaged in or are based on cultural\ntraits such as the variations of Christianity or the branches of the Indo-European language.\n\u2022 Since the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, Eastern Europe has been transitioning from Communist\ngovernments to democratic governments with capitalist-style economies. Some countries have made this\ntransition more easily than others. Many of the more progressive countries have been accepted into the EU.\nOther countries continue to struggle to establish stable democratic governments and a growing economy.\n\u2022 The breakup of former Yugoslavia is an excellent example of how cultural forces shape geographic areas.\nThe Slavic region that makes up former Yugoslavia was separated through nationalism and strong\ndevolutionary forces. The largest state of Serbia dominated the breakup with the push for a Greater Serbia\nfor Serbs only. The result was the creation of seven smaller states following a nation-state design.\n161 Chapter 3: Russia\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nRussia is the largest country in physical area\u2014almost twice the size of the United States. The country extends\nfrom its European core, where most of the population live, across the Ural Mountains into Siberia and the Russian\nFar East, where residents have more economic and social connections with China than with Europe. A train\njourney from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, the western and eastern termini of the Trans-Siberian Railway, takes\nabout one week of constant travel. No paved highways cross the entire country. The main part of Russia is so\nbig that it requires eight time zones, with an additional time zone for the European enclave of Kaliningrad, near\nPoland. Russia includes world-class cities such as Moscow, with its many billionaires and famous Red Square;\nvast territories of the Arctic north; immense forests of Siberia; grain farms rivaling those in Kansas; and mountain\ncommunities in the Caucasus. Russia has a complicated history of monarchy and totalitarianism, rich natural\nresources, extremes of wealth and poverty, and a slowly declining population. It is a dynamic country transitioning\nfrom a Communist state to part of the global economy.\nFigure 3.1 Map of Russia\n162 163 World Regional Geography\nMap courtesy of the CIA World Factbook.\nRussia is located in both Europe and Asia. The Ural Mountains are considered the separation boundary for the two\ncontinents. The Asian side of Russia is physically bordered to the south by Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China, with\nan extremely short border shared with the tip of North Korea. The Amur River creates a portion of the boundary\nwith China. The Pacific Ocean is to the east with the Bering Strait separating Russia from North America. The\nArctic Ocean creates the entire northern boundary of Russia stretching all the way from Norway to Alaska. The\nArctic Ocean can be ice covered for much of the long winter season. Russia is a northern country with the majority\nof its physical area above the latitude of 50 degrees north. The Arctic Circle runs the entire length through the\nmiddle of the northern half of the country.\nThe boundaries of European Russian include its southern border in the Caucasus Mountains with Georgia and\nAzerbaijan. This portion of Russia protrudes south of 50 degrees latitude. The Caucasus Mountains are the tallest\nmountain chain in Russia and Europe. The Black Sea and the Caspian Sea create natural boundaries on either side\nof the Caucasus Mountains. The main borders with Eastern Europe include the large countries of Ukraine and\nBelarus. Farther north, Russia borders Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Norway. European Russia is much smaller\nthan its Asian counterpart but is the dominant core area for the country anchored by the capital city of Moscow. 3.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Identify Russia\u2019s climatic influences and physical regions.\n2. Determine how the czars expanded their territorial power to create the Russian Empire.\n3. Contrast the ways that the governments of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union dealt with the issue of\ndiverse nationalities within their countries.\n4. Describe some of the environmental problems facing the Russian republics today.\nThe massive expanse of Russia exhibits a variety of physical environments, such as tundras, steppes, mountains,\nand birch forests. Type D (continental) climates dominate most of the country and characterize large landmasses\nsuch as Eurasia and North America. Land in the center of a large continent, far from the moderating effects of\noceans, tends to heat up rapidly in the summer and cool down rapidly in the winter. These areas are known for hot\nsummers and cold, harsh winters. Northern Russia borders the Arctic Ocean, and frigid air masses from the Arctic\nswoop south across Russia each winter. Moreover, Russia\u2019s northerly latitude means that it experiences a short\ngrowing season and has never been an agricultural superpower; the country usually has to import grain to feed its\npeople. Mountain ranges to the south block summer rains and warm air masses that would otherwise come from\nSouth and Central Asia, thus creating deserts and steppes in southern Russia.\nMost of Russia\u2019s population live in the European part of the country on the Eastern European Plain, also known\nas the Western Russian Plain, or the Russian Plain, the most agriculturally productive land in Russia. The eastern\nedge of the plain is marked by the Ural Mountains, a low-lying mountain chain (about 6,000 feet) that crosses\nRussia from the Arctic Ocean to Kazakhstan. The mountains contain deposits of coal, iron ore, and precious and\nsemiprecious stones and are considered the boundary between Europe and Asia. To the south of the Russian Plain\nis another mountain range, the Caucasus Mountains, which bridges the gap between the Caspian and Black\nSeas. East of the Urals are the West Siberian Plain, the Central Siberian Plateau, the Yakutsk Basin, the\nEastern Highlands, and the Central Asian Ranges. Russia has rich natural resources, such as petroleum, natural\ngas, and forest products.\n164 165 World Regional Geography\nFigure 3.2 Physical Regions of Russia\nExpansion of the Empire\nThe territory that makes up the Russian Federation was gradually conquered by the Russian Empire as\nthe country expanded from its political core around Moscow\/St. Petersburg during the sixteenth through the\nnineteenth centuries. By the end of the eighteenth century, Czarina Catherine the Great had expanded Russia to\ninclude the area that is now Ukraine (the north side of the Black Sea), the northern Caucasus Mountains, and 3.1 Introducing the Realm 166\nAlaska (which Russia later sold to the United States). During the next century, the Russian Empire expanded\neastward into Central Asia (what is now Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the other Central Asian republics),\nsouthward into the rest of the Caucasus region, and westward into Poland and Finland. In the twentieth century,\nwhen the Russian Empire disintegrated and was replaced by the Soviet Union (the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics or USSR), the central government continued to expand and strengthen its control of the vast area from\nEastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean.\nBoth the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union were imperial powers. In other words, these governments ruled\na large variety of ethnic groups in distant places: people who spoke many languages, people who worshiped\ndifferent gods in different ways, people who had various skin and hair colors, and people who did not consider\nthemselves to be Russian. Although the British and some other European powers had an arguably more difficult\ntask of ruling empires that were widely scattered around the world, Russia had the largest empire in terms of\nterritory. Ruling this diverse, immense empire was an incredible challenge.\nThe czars ruled this empire with Russification and the sword. Russification refers to the attempt to minimize\ncultural differences and turn all Russian subjects into Russians, or at least to make them as Russian as possible.\nAs they were all subject to the Russian czars, people were taught the Russian language and were encouraged to\nconvert to Russian Orthodoxy. Russification was not very successful, and the farther people were from Moscow\nthe less likely they were to be Russified. When the Soviets took over the Russian Empire, millions of Muslims still\nlived in Central Asia, on the Crimean peninsula of southern Ukraine, in the Caucasus Mountains, and elsewhere.\nThe Soviets took a different tack when it came to taming the diversity of the empire. Instead of emphasizing\nunity under the Russian czar, the Russian language, and the Russian Orthodox religion, the Soviets decided to\norganize\u2014and thus try to control\u2014the diversity of ethnic groups found in the Soviet Union. They chose some\nof the major groups (Uzbek, Kazakh, and so forth) and established Soviet Socialist Republics that corresponded\nto these major groups. Thus they created the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (Uzbek SSR), the Kazakh Soviet\nSocialist Republic (Kazakh SSR), the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR), and a different\nrepublic for each of fourteen ethnic groups, plus the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. About eighty-\nfive other ethnic groups were not given their own republics, although some of them were allocated regions within\nthe Russian Republic. In theory, each of the Soviet Socialist Republics was an independent state choosing to ally\nwith the Soviet Union. In practice, of course, these republics were part of a totalitarian, centrally ruled state with\nfar fewer autonomous rights than states in the United States.\nFigure 3.3 Former Soviet Union 167 World Regional Geography\nThe creation of these republics strengthened certain ethnic\/national identities and weakened others. There had not\nbeen a fully developed Uzbek national identity before the formation of the Uzbek SSR. The same was true for\nthe Kazakh SSR, the Turkmen SSR, and others. Although people in a certain area might have spoken the same\nlanguage, they did not think of themselves as belonging to a nation of fellow Uzbeks, Kazakhs, or Turkmen until\nthey were put into one by the Soviet rulers. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, these Soviet Socialist\nRepublics were able to declare their independence from Russia, and the national identities fostered during the\nSoviet era came to fruition.\nAt the same time that the Soviets were organizing minority ethnic groups into republics, they were also sending\nethnic Russians to live in non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union. Some were sent by force\u2014such as Russians\nwho were sent to prison camps in Siberia and stayed in the area after they were eventually freed. Other Russians\nwere sent around the empire to work in factories, power plants, and other industries, or they were sent to help\nadminister the government. By sending Russians to the far reaches of the Soviet Union, the Russian government\nhoped to consolidate its control over the various republics and to dilute the strength of the minority ethnicities.\nThis policy also had unintended consequences: when the Soviet Union collapsed after 1991 and the various\nrepublics became independent countries, they each had to deal with sizable Russian minorities. For example, at\nthe time of its independence, nearly as many ethnic Russians lived in Kazakhstan (38 percent) as ethnic Kazakhs\n(40 percent). In the twenty years since then, many Russians moved to Russia from the former Soviet republics. In\n1\n2010, Kazakhstan\u2019s population was only about 24 percent ethnic Russian . 3.1 Introducing the Realm 168\nFigure 3.4 New Russian Federal Districts\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.5.\nThe Russian federation was created with eighty-three federal subjects: two autonomous federal cities; forty-six\nprovinces (oblasts) and nine territories (krais) that function in the same way and are the most common type\nof federal unit; twenty-one republics; four autonomous districts (okrugs); and one autonomous oblast. Moscow\nand St. Petersburg are the two federal cities that function as their own units. The oblasts and krais each have a\ngovernor appointed by the central government and a locally elected legislature. The governorship was an elected\nposition in the 1990s, but President Vladimir Putin changed the structure to strengthen the power of the central\nstate. The republics, designed to be home to certain ethnic minorities, are allowed to have their own constitutions\nand governments and to select an official language that will be used besides Russian, but they are not considered\nindependent countries with the right to secession. The autonomous districts were also formed for ethnic minorities\nand are administered either by the central state or by the province or territory in which they are located. The only\nautonomous oblast was created in the 1930s to be a home for Jews in the Russian Far East, but only about 1\npercent of the population remains Jewish today. 169 World Regional Geography\nRegional Environmental Problems\nEach region of the Russian republic has its own environmental issues. The core region surrounding Moscow, with\nall its industrial activity and large urban expanses, introduces sewage and chemicals to the country\u2019s waterways,\ncontributing to serious water pollution. The same water pollution is found east of the Ural Mountains\u2014and in the\nwaterways in that region\u2014because of the industrial cities found there. Moscow and the ring of industrial cities\nsurrounding it have seen a dramatic increase in automobile use since 1991, contributing to air pollution. Russia\nis blessed with abundant natural resources, but significant environmental damage has been the price of exploiting\nand extracting those resources. Massive oil spills have occurred in the taiga and tundra areas, where the lack of\nsafety management has increased environmental damage during oil exploration and development. The taiga is the\nlarge expanse of evergreen or boreal forests in the north just south of the tundra in North America, Europe, and\nAsia. The taiga is most common in type D climates and is one of the largest biomes on earth. The taiga is the\nlargest biome in Russia. Mining and smelting processes in Siberian cities have added to the region\u2019s air and water\npollution. These ecosystems are rather fragile and will take years to recover from such damage.\nWater pollution from the rivers extends into the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and other bodies of water. Lake\nBaikal, described as the largest freshwater lake in the world, was at one time pristine, but pollutants have\nentered its waters from nearby industrial activity. Increased pollution in the Black and Caspian Seas, as well as\noverfishing, the lack of fishing regulations, and the lack of law enforcement, has resulted in the devastation of fish\npopulations such as the caviar-producing sturgeon. The Arctic waters of the Barents Sea off the northern coast of\nRussia have been a dumping ground for nuclear waste products and expended nuclear reactors from naval vessels.\nThe consequences of this nuclear pollution are not widely known or studied. Many additional aging nuclear\nreactors from the Soviet era dot the landscape, and they will need to be decommissioned at some point, adding to\nthe nuclear waste issues. Various regions in Siberia were used for nuclear testing and are also contaminated with\nnuclear radiation.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s climate is characterized by long, cold winters and short summers, and because of a short growing\nseason, the country has such poor agriculture that usually it needs to import grain.\n\u2022 The Russian Empire gradually expanded its territory to the east, west, and south of Moscow and by the end\nof the nineteenth century had accumulated a vast area of land and a great variety of people of many\nethnicities, languages, and religions.\n\u2022 The Soviets sent ethnic Russians across the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to better control\nand govern the territory and its people.\n\u2022 When the Soviet Union collapsed, its internal nationality-oriented republics declared independence, and the\nRussians who had been sent to live around the USSR were now living in non-Russian countries. While most\nof the ethnic Russians stayed in their current countries, many others returned to Russia after 1991. 3.1 Introducing the Realm 170\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Define the main tenets of a socialist economy.\n2. Describe some of the conditions of life in the Soviet Union.\n3. Briefly explain why the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) collapsed.\n4. Describe the post-Soviet economic and political situation.\nAs we learned in Section 3.1 \u201cIntroducing the Realm\u201d, the Russian Empire was built by the czars over the course\nof a few hundred years. However, the economic and political systems of the Russian Empire were not sustainable\nin the modern era. The vast majority of the population were poor, and most were landless peasant farmers\u2014and\nin a place with short growing seasons, farming was not an easy path to riches. Political decisions were made by\na very small elite group. At the dawn of the twentieth century, one hundred years after the Industrial Revolution\nswept through Great Britain and Western Europe, Russia remained an agricultural country and had not yet begun\nlarge-scale industrialization. Outside of the aristocracy, few supported the status quo in Russia, and there was\nwidespread desire for a new political system and government.\nHowever, no one could agree on what a new government would look like. In the aftermath of the First World War,\na civil war erupted in Russia. During these chaotic times, the last czar, Nicholas II, was forced from office, and\nhe and his family were executed. The most powerful group battling for control of Russia was a Communist group\ncalled the Bolsheviks, which literally meant the \u201clarger group.\u201d Other groups, including the \u201csmaller group,\u201d the\nMensheviks, lost the civil war. The Bolshevik leader was Vladimir Lenin, and in 1917 he and his supporters\nembarked on a quest to turn Russia into a Communist state.\nThe capital city was moved back to Moscow from St. Petersburg, where it had been since the time of Czar Peter\nthe Great in the eighteenth century. St. Petersburg\u2019s name was changed to Petrograd and then Leningrad in honor\nof Vladimir Lenin, as the atheist Soviets did not want any references to Christian saints. The entire territory of\nthe Russian Empire was turned into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The Russian people traded\na monarchy for a Marxist totalitarian state (see the explanation of Marxism in Section 3.2.1 \u201cMarxist-Leninist\nCentral Planning\u201d).\n171 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 172\nFigure 3.5 Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain\nThe Soviet Union lasted from 1922 to 1991. Josef Stalin, the Soviet dictator who took over after Lenin, was\nincapacitated in 1922 (and died in 1924). He was a ruthless leader who murdered his way to power and killed\nor exiled anyone who got in his way. Stalin is famous for initiating economic plans that helped move Russia\nfrom a poor, agrarian state to a large, industrial superpower. He pushed for rapid industrialization, the eradication\nof family farms in lieu of large communal farms, the end of personal ownership of land or businesses, and the\ndramatic weakening of organized religion. All these changes came at a great price. During his reign of terror,\nan estimated thirty million people lost their lives. The forced collectivization of agriculture brought about a\ndevastating famine in 1932\u201333, in which between six and eight million people starved to death or were killed\noutright, many of them in Ukraine. Stalin led periodic purges of his perceived political enemies. The largest of\nthese is known as the Great Purge. At that time (1936\u201338), about one million so-called enemies of the state\nwere executed. More people lost their lives under Stalin than in all the concentration camps of Adolf Hitler\u2019s\nNazi regime. The full extent of Stalin\u2019s purges of his people may never be fully known. Stalin\u2019s rule ended in\n1953, when he reportedly died of natural causes. However, some historians believe he was poisoned by his close\nassociates. 173 World Regional Geography\nTable 3.1 Soviet Leaders and Russian Presidents\nSoviet Union Leaders Time as Leader Life Span\nVladimir Ilich Ulyanov (Lenin) 1917\u201324d 1870\u20131924\nJosef Vissarionovich Djugashvili (Stalin) 1924\u201353d 1879?\u20131953\nNikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev 1953\u201364 1894\u20131971\nLeonid Ilyich Brezhnev 1964\u201382d 1906\u20131982\nYuri Vladimirovich Andropov 1982\u201384d 1914\u201384\nKonstantin Ustinovich Chernenko 1984\u201385d 1911\u201385\nMikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev 1985\u201391 1931\u2013\nRussian Federation presidents (1991+)\nBoris Nikolayevich Yeltsin 1991\u201399 1931\u20132007\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin 2000\u20132008 1952\u2013\nDmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev 2008\u2013 1965\u2013\nd = died while in office\nMarxist-Leninist Central Planning\nThe Soviet Union espoused the philosophies of Karl Marx, a nineteenth-century German theorist. Marx wrote\nthat all political and economic life can be understood as a struggle between the various classes in society. People\nwho adhere to Marx\u2019s philosophy are called Marxists, and the Soviet version of Marxism is called Marxism-\nLeninism. In Marxist thought, capitalism is an oppressive economic system in which the working class (the\nproletariat) is oppressed by the bourgeoisie (the wealthy middle class). Marxists believe that the proletariat\nshould revolt, rise up against the bourgeoisie, take the property away from the rich, and give it to the government\nto control it for the benefit of the common people. Ultimately, a pure Communist system would result, with no\nsocial or economic classes, no private property, no rich people, and no poor people. In real life, governments that\nadopt these ideas practice socialism and are said to be socialist.\nAs a socialist state, the Soviet Union did not include open markets. The Soviet Union was a command economy, 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 174\nin which economic decisions were made by the state and not left to the market to decide. During the Soviet era, for\nexample, industrial production was planned by the central government. The government would decide what would\nbe produced, where it would be produced, the quantity produced, the number of workers who would produce it,\nwhere the raw materials would come from, and how the final product would be distributed. By mobilizing the\nentire country to work toward common goals, the USSR was able to achieve the rapid industrialization that it\nso desired. However, the Soviets underestimated the power and efficiency of free-enterprise capitalism, and their\nsocialist system was undermined by waste, fraud, and corruption.\nAnother main economic feature of the Soviet Union was collectivized agriculture. The Soviet leaders did not want\nindividual, capitalist farmers to become rich and threaten their economic system. Nor did they want thousands\nof small, inefficient farms when the country was perpetually unable to feed itself. Instead, they decided to\nstreamline agricultural production into large farm factories. All the farmland in each area was consolidated into\na government-owned collective operation. Some collective farms were run by the state, while others were run by\nprivate cooperatives. During the transition period to collective farming, individual farmers were forced to give\nup their land, animals, farm equipment, and farm buildings and donate them to the collective farm in their area.\nThe state also demanded a high percentage of the crops produced. At times, the government collected the entire\nharvest, not even allowing seed crops to be held for the following season. This brought about widespread famine\nin 1932\u201333. Collectivized agriculture remained the norm in the Soviet Union until the country\u2019s dissolution in\n1991 and even afterward in some areas.\nThe Cold War\nFrom the end of World War II in 1945 until the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the Soviet Union and the United\nStates competed in the global community for the control of labor, resources, and world power. Each side attracted\nallies, and most countries were on the side of either the United States or the Soviet Union; very few remained\nneutral. This era, known as the Cold War, did not involve direct military armed conflict between the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, but it transformed the world into a political chessboard, with each side wanting\nto block the other side from gaining ground. Whenever the Soviets would enter into an alliance with a certain\ncountry, the United States was right there to try to counter the move. Wars, armed conflicts, sabotage, spying, and\ncovert activities were the methods of the Cold War. Both sides stockpiled as much deadly weaponry as possible,\nincluding nuclear warheads and missiles. They also competed in the race to put people in outer space. 175 World Regional Geography\nFigure 3.6 October Revolution Celebration 1983, Moscow, during the Cold War\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Cold War led to wars fought in Vietnam, Korea, Grenada, Afghanistan, Angola, and the Middle East, with\nthe Soviet Union funding one side and the United States supplying the other. Covert wars or guerilla wars with\nsecret agents and political assassinations were fought in Cuba, Nicaragua, Chile, Guatemala, Mozambique, Laos,\nCambodia, and a host of other third-world countries. The Cold War divided the world into two main camps,\neach with a high number of nuclear weapons. Eastern Europe was sectioned off by the Iron Curtain, and the\nBerlin Wall divided the city of Berlin, Germany. These physical barriers divided the communist countries of\nEastern Europe with the capitalist democracies of Western Europe. Germany itself was divided into two separate\ncountries, as explained in Chapter 2 \u201cEurope\u201d.\nVarious Soviet dictators came to power and died in office before the end of the Cold War. The last Soviet leader\nwas Mikhail Gorbachev, who assumed power in 1985. The US president at the time was Ronald Reagan. During\nthe 1980s the United States was outspending the Soviets militarily, and its economy was growing at a much faster\nrate than that of the USSR. At the same time, the Soviets were engaged in a costly war in Afghanistan, and\ntheir economy was faltering and in danger of collapse. Gorbachev realized that reforms had to be implemented\nto modernize the Soviet system: political life needed to be more open so that people would feel ownership of the\ncountry, and the economy needed to be restructured. Gorbachev implemented perestroika (restructuring of the\neconomy with market-like reforms) and glasnost (openness and transparency of all government activities). The\nrestructuring exposed fundamental problems in the economy, and by 1990 the Soviet economy was in worse shape\nthan ever before. 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 176\nFigure 3.7\nThe first McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the former Soviet Union was in Moscow, Russia.\nFran Urbano \u2013 First McDonalds in Russia \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe end came in 1991: the Soviet Union collapsed when fourteen of the Soviet republics broke away and\ndeclared their independence. At this point, the Soviet state was too weak to prevent it. All the republics, including\nRussia itself (now called the Russian Federation), became independent countries. The only territories that did\nnot achieve independence were the smaller republics and autonomous regions that existed within the Russian\nFederation\u2019s boundaries. The Iron Curtain melted away seemingly overnight, and people were free to travel\nto and from the former Communist countries. The old Russian flag flew over the Kremlin\u2014the seat of the\nRussian government\u2014for the first time since Czar Nicholas II had been in power seventy-three years earlier. The\nCommunist era of the Soviet Union and the Cold War were over.\nFigure 3.8 Walls of the Kremlin in Moscow 177 World Regional Geography\nKremlin is a Russian word for a walled city. Inside Moscow\u2019s Kremlin is the famous Red Square.\nLarry Koester \u2013 Kremlin \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe post-Soviet transition was filled with political, economic, and social turmoil. Boris Yeltsin, the first president\nof the new Russian Federation, ushered in a series of economic reforms that privatized state-owned enterprises.\nRussian leaders tried to reverse socialism rapidly through what they called \u201cshock therapy,\u201d which they knew\nwould be painful but hoped would be brief. These reforms created a new class of capitalist entrepreneurs.\nWealth, once controlled by the political elite, was now being shifted to the business elite, a pattern found in most\ncapitalist countries. Many ordinary workers faced unemployment for the first time as the new owners of various\ncompanies trimmed unnecessary staff. Private ownership forced housing costs to skyrocket, and while families\nwere generally allowed to keep the homes they already lived in, purchasing houses or condominiums became out\nof reach for many people. The value of the ruble, Russia\u2019s currency, declined rapidly, and older people watched\nas their life savings evaporated overnight. Western goods were more easily accessible, and all kinds of consumer\nproducts became much more widely available than they were during the Soviet era. Bread lines and empty store\nshelves became distant memories as the former Communist state shifted over to a type of capitalist democracy.\nYeltsin became increasingly less popular as citizens became dissatisfied with corruption and the high social costs\nof the post-Soviet transition. He resigned in 1999 and was replaced by Vladimir Putin. 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 178\nOutline of Russia\u2019s Historical Geography\n1.

The export of Russia\u2019s vast quantities of natural resources, such as oil, natural gas,\nand timber, to Europe and the rest of the world helped the country rebound from the economic collapse of the\n1990s. Russia has benefited from the recent increase in energy prices, and oil, natural gas, metals, and timber\naccount for more than 80 percent of exports and 30 percent of government revenues. However, Russia still needs\nto modernize its dilapidated manufacturing base if it is to economically compete against the European Union,\nNorth America, or eastern Asia. During Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency (2000\u20132008), Russia witnessed substantial\neconomic growth that inspired foreign investors to pump money into the Russian economy and catapulted\nMoscow into an investment haven and one of the richest cities in the world. In 2008, Moscow claimed to have 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 180\nmore billionaires than any other city in the world. Russia has reestablished itself as a major player in the global\neconomy, although much of its population still suffers from poverty and social problems.\nRussia\u2019s population grew steadily during the Soviet era, except during periods of famine or warfare, and the\ncountry underwent a rural-to-urban shift as farm workers moved to cities to labor in factories. However, when the\nUSSR collapsed, Russia\u2019s population began a steep decline, falling from a peak of 149 million in 1991 to about\n143 million in 2005. The trend of low birth rates actually began during the Soviet period. The population decline\noccurred because birth rates always decline during periods of economic and social crisis as people delay or decide\nagainst having children, and the country experienced particularly high death rates because of alcoholism, heart\ndisease, and the collapse of the social safety net. Any time death rates surpass birth rates, a country\u2019s population\nwill decline unless the difference is offset by immigration. Russia\u2019s birth rate was also impacted by very high\nrates of abortion: in 1992, for example, there were 221 abortions in Russia for every 100 live births (Johnston\u2019s\nArchive). Although Russia\u2019s population has seemingly bottomed out, the only reason it is not continuing to decline\nis immigration from the former Soviet republics. Russia still has a negative rate of natural increase.\nTo put Russia\u2019s demographic profile in context, its fertility rate was only about 1.5 in 2010, meaning that the\naverage woman would have 1.5 children in her lifetime. This is below the 2.1 children each woman would need\nto have for the population to remain stable. The fertility rate in Russia is similar to that of countries in Europe\n(1.5) but lower than that of the United States (2.1) (Central Intelligence Agency). Life expectancy for Russian\nmen is variously reported as sixty years up to sixty-three years, while women can expect to live seventy-three to\nseventy-five years. In Western Europe, life expectancies are about eighty years.\nAbout 80 percent of Russia\u2019s population is ethnically Russian. The next largest group is Tatar (3.8 percent), a\ngroup that traditionally has spoken the Tatar language and practiced Islam. More than 150 ethnic groups are\nrepresented in Russia, including indigenous people of the Arctic who herd reindeer for a living. Each of the\nnationalities of the former Soviet republics has a presence in Russia, and because of its relatively strong economy,\nRussia (especially Moscow) is an immigration magnet for residents of those countries. Most of these groups have\ntheir own language and cultural traditions.\nFigure 3.10 The Cathedral of Intercession of the Virgin on the Moat, Also Known as the Cathedral of St. Basil\nthe Blessed, on the Red Square, Moscow 181 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is the dominant religious denomination in Russia. For generations, it was the\ncountry\u2019s official religion, and Russian people were automatically considered to be Orthodox, no matter what their\npersonal beliefs. During the Soviet era, the government did much to weaken the church, including killing tens of\nthousands of priests, monks, and nuns and closing most churches. The much smaller church that survived was\nlargely controlled by the state. Because of state-sanctioned atheism during the Soviet era, only 15 to 20 percent\nof Russia\u2019s population today actively practices Orthodoxy, although a much greater number claim to be Russian\nOrthodox Christians. Another 15 percent of the country\u2019s population practices Islam, especially in places such as\nthe Caucasus region and the southern Ural Mountains, and about 2 percent practice other forms of Christianity,\nsuch as Catholicism and Protestantism (Central Intelligence Agency). Even though Orthodoxy is practiced by a\nminority of Russia\u2019s population, the church has increased its influence since 1991 and often acts as an official\nchurch. A small percentage of the population are Buddhists, and various ethnic groups in Siberia and the Far East\npractice tribal religions and pagan rites. 3.2 The USSR and the Russian Federation 182\nThe Russian Language\nLike English, Russian is an Indo-European language. Russian is on the Slavic branch of the language tree, along\nwith languages such as Polish, Ukrainian, and Serbo-Croatian. A relatively new language, it developed from a\nlanguage called Old East Slavic that was spoken around 1100 CE. Medieval Russian developed in the thirteenth\ncentury, and modern literary Russian is usually traced back to the early nineteenth century. Russian uses the\nCyrillic alphabet, which was developed from Greek. The Russian language is the official language of the Russian\nrepublic. With over one hundred languages used in the country, twenty-seven of them are officially recognized in\nvarious regions within the republic.\nFigure 3.11 Apple Keyboard for a Russian Computer\nIwan Gabovitch \u2013 My current keyboard \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Communist state was created in 1917 as the result of a civil war, which evolved into the creation of the\nSoviet Union in 1922. During this era, the Russian people traded a monarchy for a Marxist totalitarian state.\n\u2022 One of the primary goals of the new USSR was rapid industrialization, and this goal was achieved through\ncentral planning and the collectivization of agriculture. Inefficiencies in the system persisted throughout the\nSoviet era. 183 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 The Soviet Union\u2019s Communist system was maintained at great cost: millions were killed by purges and in\ngovernment-produced famines.\n\u2022 A weakened USSR tried to reform in the 1980s through Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s policies of perestroika and\nglasnost but instead collapsed in 1991.\n\u2022 Early post-Soviet years were ones of democratization, rapid privatization, and the unraveling of the social\nsafety net. The shift to capitalism restructured the Russian economy.\n\u2022 The Russian economy strengthened after 2000, and Russian president Vladimir Putin strengthened the\npower of the central state.\n\u2022 Russia has a low fertility rate and a negative rate of natural increase. High rates of abortions and alcoholism\nhave been contributing factors.\n\u2022 The Russian Orthodox Church is the dominant religious denomination in Russia.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Name the major cities, rivers, and economic base of Russia\u2019s core region.\n2. Identify the economic base of cities in the Eastern Frontier and the identity of the world\u2019s most voluminous\nfreshwater lake.\n3.

Learn why Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and discover the role of fossil fuels in the economies of\nArmenia and Azerbaijan.\nThe Core Region\nMost of Russia\u2019s population and its major industries are located west of the Ural Mountains on the Russian\nPlain. Known as Russia\u2019s geographic core, this includes the Moscow region, the Volga region, and the Ural\nMountain region. Moscow, Russia\u2019s capital city, anchors a central industrial area that is home to more than\nfifty million people. Moscow alone has more than ten million residents, with about thirteen million in its\nmetropolitan area, making it slightly smaller than the Los Angeles, California, metro area. A ring of industrial\ncities surrounding Moscow contains vital production centers of Russian manufacturing. During the Communist\nera, Moscow expanded from its nineteenth-century core (although the city dates from at least the twelfth century)\nand became an industrial city with planned neighborhoods. This world-class city has an extensive subway and\nfreeway system that is expanding to meet current growth demands. Although rents, commodities, and domestic\ngoods had fixed prices during the Communist era, the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse changed all that. Today Moscow is\none of the most expensive places to live in the world, with prices based on supply and demand. Many want to live\nin Moscow, but it is financially out of reach for many Russians.\nRussia\u2019s second-largest city, with a population of about five million, is St. Petersburg. Located on the Baltic Sea,\n185 3.3 Regions of Russia 186\nit is western Russia\u2019s leading port city. The city was renamed Petrograd (1914\u201324) and Leningrad (1924\u201391) but\ntoday is often called Petersburg, or just \u201cPeter\u201d for short. Peter the Great built the city with the help of European\narchitects in the early eighteenth century to rival other European capitals, and he made it the capital of the Russian\nEmpire. Named after St. Peter in the Bible (not Peter the Great), it is a cultural center for Russia and a major\ntourist destination. It is also known for shipbuilding, oil and gas trade, manufacturing, and finance. Its greatest\ntragedy took place when it was under siege for twenty-nine months by the German military during World War\nII. About one million civilians died of starvation or during the bombardment, and hundreds of thousands fled the\ncity, leaving the city nearly empty by the end of the siege.\nFigure 3.12 Russia\u2019s Core Region 187 World Regional Geography\nSource: Map courtesy of the CIA World Factbook.\nTo the far north of St. Petersburg on the Barents Sea are the cities of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. Murmansk\nis a major military port for Russia\u2019s navy and nuclear submarine fleet. Relatively warm water from the North\nAtlantic drift circles around Norway to keep this northern port city fairly free of ice. Arkhangelsk (which literally\nmeans \u201carchangel\u201d), used as a port for lumber exports, has a much shorter ice-free season than Murmansk. Both\nof these cities are in Russia\u2019s far north, with long winters and exceedingly brief summers.\nThe Volga River flows through the core region of Russia, providing transportation, fresh water, and fishing. The\nVolga is the longest river in Europe at 2,293 miles, and it drains most of Russia\u2019s western core region. This river\nhas been a vital link in the transportation system of Russia for centuries and connects major industrial centers\nfrom the Moscow region to the south through an extensive network of canals and other waterways. The Volga\nRiver flows into the Caspian Sea, and a canal links the Volga with the Black Sea through a connecting canal via\nthe Don River.\nAt the eastern edge of Russia\u2019s European core lie the Ural Mountains, which act as a natural divide between\nEurope and Asia. These low-lying mountains have an abundance of minerals and fossil fuels, which make the Ural\nMountains ideal for industrial development. The natural resources of the Urals and the surrounding area provide 3.3 Regions of Russia 188\nraw materials for manufacturing and export. The eastern location kept these resources out of the hands of the Nazis\nduring World War II, and the resources themselves helped in the war effort. Oil and natural gas exploration and\ndevelopment have been extensive across Russia\u2019s core region and have greatly increased Russia\u2019s export profits.\nFigure 3.13 Russia\u2019s Eastern Frontier, the Far East, and Siberia\nSource: Map courtesy of the CIA World Factbook. 189 World Regional Geography\nThe Eastern Frontier\nEast of the Urals, in south-central Russia, is Russia\u2019s Eastern Frontier, a region of planned cities, industrial\nplants, and raw-material processing centers. The population is centered in two zones here: the Kuznetsk Basin\n(or Kuzbas, for short) and the Lake Baikal region.\nThe Kuzbas is a region of coal, iron ore, and bauxite mining; timber processing; and steel and aluminum\nproduction industries. Central industrial cities were created across the Eastern Frontier to take advantage of these\nresource opportunities. The most important of these is Novosibirsk, the third-largest city in Russia after Moscow\nand St. Petersburg and home to about 1.4 million people. The city is not only noted for its industries but it is also\nthe region\u2019s center for the arts, music, and theater. It is host to a music conservatory and a philharmonic orchestra,\na division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and three major universities.\nAgriculture, timber, and mining are the main economic activities in the eastern Lake Baikal region, which is more\nsparsely settled than the Kuzbas. Lake Baikal (400 miles long, 50 miles wide) holds more fresh water than all\nthe US Great Lakes together and about 20 percent of all the liquid fresh water on the earth\u2019s surface. Its depth\nhas been recently measured at 5,370 feet (more than a mile). Some of the longest river systems in the world flow\nthrough the Eastern Frontier. The Irtysh, Ob, Yenisey, and Lena are the main rivers that flow north through the\nregion into Siberia and on to the Arctic Ocean. To the east, the Amur River creates the border between Russia\nand China until it flows north into the Sea of Okhotsk. In addition to waterways, the Trans-Siberian Railway is\nthe major transportation link through the Eastern Frontier, connecting Moscow with the port city of Vladivostok\nin the Far East.\nSiberia\nSiberia, as a place name, actually refers to all of Asian Russia east of the Ural Mountains, including the Eastern\nFrontier and the Russian Far East. However, in this and some other geography textbooks, the term Siberia more\nspecifically describes only the region north of the Eastern Frontier that extends to the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nThe word Siberia conjures up visions of a cold and isolated place, which is true. Stretching from the northern Ural\nMountains to the Bering Strait, Siberia is larger than the entire United States but is home to only about fifteen\nmillion people. Its cities are located on strategic rivers with few overland highways connecting them.\nType D (continental) climates dominate the southern portion of this region, and the territory consists mainly of 3.3 Regions of Russia 190\nconiferous forests in a biome called the taiga. This is one of the world\u2019s largest taiga regions. Type E (polar)\nclimates can be found north of the taiga along the coast of the Arctic Sea, where the tundra is the main physical\nlandscape. No trees grow in the tundra because of the semifrozen ground. Permafrost may thaw near the surface\nduring the short summer season but is permanently frozen beneath the surface. On the eastern edge of the\ncontinent, the mountainous Kamchatka Peninsula has twenty active volcanoes and more than one hundred inactive\nvolcanoes. It is one of the most active geological regions on the Pacific Rim.\nFigure 3.14 Mount Koryasky, an Active Volcano, and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a Town on Russia\u2019s\nKamchatka Peninsula\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe vast northern region of Russia is sparsely inhabited but holds enormous quantities of natural resources such\nas oil, timber, diamonds, natural gas, gold, and silver. There are vast resources in Siberia waiting to be extracted,\nand this treasure trove will play an important role in Russia\u2019s economic future. 191 World Regional Geography\nThe Far East\nFigure 3.15 Vladivostok Tram Opposite the Admiral\u2019s Club on Its Way to the Railway Station, Vladivostok\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0.\nAcross the strait from Japan is Russia\u2019s Far East region, with the port of Vladivostok (population about 578,000)\nas its primary city. Bordering North Korea and China, this Far East region is linked to Moscow by the Trans-\nSiberian Railway. Before 1991, Vladivostok was closed to outsiders and was an important army and naval base\nfor the Russian military. Goods and raw materials from Siberia and nearby Sakhalin Island were processed here\nand shipped west by train. Sakhalin Island and its coastal waters have oil and mineral resources. Industrial and\nbusiness enterprises declined with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Today, the Far East is finding itself on\nthe periphery of Russia\u2019s hierarchy of productivity. However, it has the potential to emerge again as an important\nlink to the Pacific Rim markets. 3.3 Regions of Russia 192\nSouthern Russia\nIn the southern portion of the Russian core lies a land bridge between Europe and Southwest Asia: a region\ndominated by the Caucasus Mountains. To the west is the Black Sea, and to the east is the landlocked Caspian\nSea. The Caucasus Mountains, higher than the European Alps, were formed by the Arabian tectonic plate moving\nnorthward into the Eurasian plate. The highest peak is Mt. Elbrus at 18,510 feet. Located on the border between\nGeorgia and Russia, Mt. Elbrus is the highest peak on the European continent as well as the highest peak in\nRussia.\nMost of this region was conquered by the Russian Empire during the nineteenth century and held as part of the\nSoviet Union in the twentieth. However, only a minority of its population is ethnic Russian, and its people consist\nof a constellation of at least fifty ethnic groups speaking a variety of languages.\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Caucasus region has been the main location of unrest within Russia.\nWars between Russia and groups in the Caucasus have claimed thousands of lives. Some of the non-Russian\nterritories of the Caucasus would like to become independent, but Russia fears an unraveling of its country if their\nsecession is allowed to proceed. To understand why the Russians have fought the independence of places such\nas Chechnya but did not fight against the independence of other former Soviet states in the Caucasus such as\nArmenia, it is necessary to study the administrative structure of Russia itself.\nFigure 3.16 Republics of Southern Russia, Including Chechnya 193 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nOf the twenty-one republics, eight are located in southern Russia in the Caucasus region. One of these, the\nChechen Republic (or Chechnya), has never signed the Federation Treaty to join the Russian Federation; in\nfact, Chechnya proposed independence after the breakup of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\nAlthough other territories to the south of Chechnya, such as Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, also declared\ntheir independence from Russia after 1991, they were never administratively part of Russia. During the Soviet\nera, those countries were classified as Soviet Socialist Republics, so it was easy for them to become independent\ncountries when all the other republics (e.g., Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan) did so after 1991. However,\nChechnya was administratively part of the USSR with no right to secession. After 1991, Russia decided that it\nwould not allow territories that had been administratively governed by Russia to secede and has fought wars to\nprevent that from happening. It feared the consequences if all twenty-one republics within the Russian Federation\nwere declared independent countries.\nChechnya has fought against Russia for independence twice since the USSR\u2019s collapse. The First Chechen War\n(1994\u201396) ended in a stalemate, and Russia allowed the Chechens to have de facto independence for several\nyears. But in 1999, Russia resumed military action, and by 2009 the war was essentially over and Chechnya was\nonce more under Russia\u2019s control. Between twenty-five thousand and fifty thousand Chechens were killed in the\nwar, and between five thousand and eleven thousand Russian soldiers were also killed (Wikipedia). In 2003, the 3.3 Regions of Russia 194\nUnited Nations called Grozny, Chechnya\u2019s capital, the most destroyed city on Earth. Reconstruction of Grozny\nhas slowly begun.\nEven before the recent wars, Chechnya had a difficult past. Over the course of its history, it has been at\nthe boundary between the Ottoman Empire, the Persian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Most of the people\nconverted to Sunni Islam in the 1700s to curry favor with the Ottomans and seek their protection against Russian\nencroachment. Nevertheless, Chechnya was annexed by the Russian Empire. During Soviet leader Josef Stalin\u2019s\nreign of terror, more than five hundred thousand Chechens were loaded on train cars and shipped to Kazakhstan,\nwhere as many as half died.\nTranscaucasia\nThe independent countries of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan make up the region of Transcaucasia.\nAlthough they are independent countries, they are included in this chapter because they have more ties to Russia\nthan to the region of Southwest Asia to their south. They have been inextricably connected to Russia ever since\nthey were annexed by the Russian Empire in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they were all\nformer republics within the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, these three small republics\ndeclared independence and separated from the rest of what became Russia.\nGeographically, these three countries are located on the border between the European and Asian continents.\nThe Caucasus Mountain range is considered the dividing line. The region known as Transcaucasia is generally\ndesignated as the southern portion of the Caucasus Mountain area.\nFigure 3.17 Southern Russia and Transcaucasia 195 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe country of Georgia has a long history of ancient kingdoms and a golden age including invasions by\nthe Mongols, Ottomans, Persians, and Russians. For a brief three years\u2014from 1918 to 1921\u2014Georgia was\nindependent. After fighting an unsuccessful war to remain free after the Russian Revolution, Georgia was\nabsorbed into the Soviet Union. Since it declared independence in 1991, the country has struggled to gain a stable\nfooting within the world community. Unrest in the regions of South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Adjara (where the\npopulations are generally not ethnic Georgian) has destabilized the country, making it more difficult to engage in\nthe global economy. Russia and Georgia had a military conflict in 2008, when Russian troops entered the South\nOssetian region to support its move toward independence from Georgia. Georgia considered South Ossetia to\nbe a part of Georgia and called the Russians an occupying force. Many other countries, including the United\nStates, condemned Russia for their action. Russian troops pulled out of Georgia but supported the independence of\nSouth Ossetia and Georgia\u2019s westernmost region of Abkhazia. Neither South Ossetia nor Abkhazia are considered\nindependent states by most of the world\u2019s countries.\nA democratic-style central government has emerged in Georgia, and economic support has been provided by\ninternational aid and foreign investments. The country has made the switch from the old Soviet command\neconomy to a free-market economy. Agricultural products and tourism have been Georgia\u2019s main economic\nactivities. 3.3 Regions of Russia 196\nIn 2010, Armenia, to the south of Georgia, had a population of only about three million in a physical area smaller\nin size than the US state of Maryland. It is a country with its own distinctive alphabet and language and was the\nfirst country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion, an event traditionally dated to 301 CE. The\nArmenian Apostolic Church remains the country\u2019s central religious institution, and the Old City of Jerusalem in\nIsrael has an Armenian Quarter, an indication of Armenia\u2019s early connection with Christianity.\nThe small landlocked country has experienced invasions from every empire that controlled the region throughout\nhistory. The geographic area of the country decreased when the Ottoman Empire took control of western Armenia,\nand that region remains a part of Turkey to this day. A bitter conflict between Turks and Armenians during\nWorld War I resulted in the systematic deaths of as many as a million Armenians. This genocide continues to be\ncommemorated annually on April 24, the traditional date of the Armenian Martyrs\u2019 Day, but Turkey still denies\nthe events were genocide.\nLike the other former Soviet republics, Armenia has shifted from a centrally planned economy to a market\neconomy. Before independence in 1991, Armenia\u2019s economy had a manufacturing sector that provided other\nSoviet republics with industrial goods in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since then, its manufacturing\nsector has declined and Armenia has fallen back on agriculture and financial remittances from the approximately\neight million Armenians living abroad to support its economy. These remittances, along with international aid and\ndirect foreign investments, have helped stabilize Armenia\u2019s economic situation.\nAzerbaijan is an independent country to the east of Armenia bordering the Caspian Sea. It is about the same size\nin area as the US state of Maine. This former Soviet republic has a population of more than eight million in which\nmore than 90 percent follow Islam. Azerbaijan shares a border with the northern province of Iran, which is also\ncalled Azerbaijan. Part of Azerbaijan is located on the western side of Armenia and is separated from the rest of\nthe country.\nLocated on the shores of the Caspian Sea, Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan and is the largest city in the region,\nwith a population approaching two million. During the Cold War era, it was one of the top five largest cities\nin the Soviet Union. The long history of this vibrant city and the infusion of oil revenues have given rise to a\nmetropolitan center of activity that has attracted global business interests. Wealth has not been evenly distributed\nin the country, and at least one-fourth of the population still lives below the poverty line.\nAzerbaijan is rich with oil reserves. Petroleum was discovered here in the eighth century, and hand-dug oil wells\nproduced oil as early as the fifteenth century. Since the Industrial Revolution, the rising value of petroleum for\nenergy increased the industrial extraction of oil in Azerbaijan. At the end of the nineteenth century, this small\ncountry produced half the oil in the world. Oil and natural gas are the country\u2019s main export products and have\nbeen a central focus of its economy. Large oil reserves are located beneath the Caspian Sea, and offshore wells\nwith pipelines to shore have expanded throughout the Caspian Basin. As much as the export of oil and natural gas\nhas been an economic support for the country, it has not been without costs to the environment. According to US\ngovernment sources, local scientists consider parts of Azerbaijan to be some of the most devastated environmental\nareas in the world. Serious air, soil, and water pollution exist due to uncontrolled oil spills and the heavy use of\nchemicals in the agricultural sector. 197 World Regional Geography\nFigure 3.18 Oil Fields of Azerbaijan\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The vast majority of Russia\u2019s population live in the western core area of the country, the region around the\ncapital city of Moscow.\n\u2022 Most of the cities on the Barents Sea and in the Eastern Frontier were established for manufacturing or for\nthe exploitation of raw materials.\n\u2022 The Volga River and its tributaries have been an important transportation network for centuries.

It has abundant natural\nresources, continental and arctic climates, mountains, plains, and massive river systems.\n\u2022 Russia\u2019s vast size has made it challenging to govern, both for the Russian Empire and for the Soviet Union.\nEach government dealt with the size and cultural diversity in different ways.\n\u2022 Both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union were empires\u2014that is, they were large countries in which\nRussian political control dominated the many peoples of various cultures and ethnicities within its\nboundaries.\n\u2022 The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was founded through a violent rebellion and civil war. It\nwas ruled by the Bolshevik party, a socialist group led by Vladimir Lenin. The second leader of the USSR,\nJosef Stalin, was renowned for the millions of people that he killed as he consolidated his power and sought\neconomic growth for his country.\n\u2022 The USSR was a command economy, in which economic decisions were made by the central state.\nEconomic objectives of the early leaders included rapid industrialization and agricultural collectivization.\n\u2022 The Soviet economy was ultimately corrupt and inefficient\u2014two factors that, along with other problems,\nled to the unraveling of the Soviet Union in 1991. The reforms of the final Soviet leader, Mikhail\nGorbachev, were not enough to prevent its collapse.\n\u2022 The early post-Soviet years were ones of rapid privatization, immense wealth for a small few, economic\nhardship for most, and the disappearance of the social safety net.\n\u2022 Since 1999, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have strengthened Russia\u2019s economy\nand consolidated the power of the central state.\n\u2022 Most Russians live in the western part of the country near Moscow, and other large population centers are\nalso located in the country\u2019s European core. There are a few industrial cities in the Eastern Frontier region,\nbut most of Russia east of the Urals is a vast wilderness.\n\u2022 Southern Russia\u2014the Caucasus Mountain region\u2014is the portion of the country that has caused the most\nunrest for Moscow. Non-Russian groups such as the Chechens would like to be independent, but Russia has\nengaged in warfare to prevent them from seceding.\n\u2022 The countries of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan were once part of the USSR but are now independent\n200 201 World Regional Geography\nstates. They are south of the Russian border, in the southern Caucasus Mountains. These countries are not\nwithout their challenges, as they are influenced both by Russia and by the Middle East to their south. They\nare home to large components of Muslims and Christians and a variety of ethnic groups. While Armenia is\nthe poorest of the three countries, Georgia and Azerbaijan have some wealth from petroleum exports. Chapter 4: North America\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nFigure 4.1\n202 203 World Regional Geography\nThe geographic center of North America is located near Rugby, North Dakota. Notice the flags of Mexico, Canada, and the United\nStates.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe realm of North America as a continent extends from the polar regions of the Arctic in northern Canada and\nAlaska all the way south through Mexico and the countries of Central America. Geographers usually study the\ncontinent by dividing it into two separate realms based on differences in physical and cultural geography. Both\nthe United States and Canada share similar physical geography characteristics as well as a common development\nhistory with either a British or French colonial legacy. Mexico and Central America are dominated by more\ntropical climates and were colonized mainly by the Spanish. The United States and Canada\u2014the second- and\nthird-largest countries in the world in physical area, respectively\u2014make up more than 13 percent of the world\u2019s Chapter 4: North America 204\ntotal landmass. The Atlantic Ocean borders their eastern edge, and the Pacific Ocean creates their western\nboundary. To the north is the Arctic Ocean. The North American region is highly urbanized\u2014about 80 percent\nof the population lives in cities\u2014but other vast areas, especially in Canada, are sparsely populated. Although\nsome natives remain, most of North America\u2019s diverse population consists of immigrants or descendants of\nimmigrants from other world regions. The United States is the world\u2019s largest economy, and both countries enjoy\nhigh standards of living as technologically developed countries. 4.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Define the physiographic regions of North America.\n2. Explain the two dominant climate patterns in North America.\n3. Find out which three European countries had the most significant early influence on North America, what\nparts of the region they dominated, and what their long-term impacts have been.\n4. Determine the population distribution of the United States and Canada.\nNorth America is divided into a number of physical regions with distinct landforms. The western part of the\ncontinent is marked by north-south mountain ranges in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Mountains and\nValleys physiographic provinces, with the Intermontane Basins and Plateaus in between. The eastern portion of\nNorth America is defined by the ancient Appalachian Highlands, a mountain range that is much less rugged than\nthe Rockies but with no less influence on the history and development of the United States. The interior of the\ncontinent is characterized by plains\u2014the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains. To the north is the Canadian\nShield, geologically the oldest part of North America, and a sparsely populated area with poor soils. At the\nsouthern and eastern edge of the continent is the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain, a relatively flat zone that extends\nfrom New York to Texas.\nFigure 4.2 Physical Regions of the United States and Canada\n205 4.1 Introducing the Realm 206\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe climates of the United States and Canada include the frigid type E climate of the tundra of northern Canada\nand Alaska, the tropical type A climate of southern Florida and Hawaii, the type C climates of the humid eastern\nUnited States, the seasonal type D climates of the northern United States and most of Canada, and the arid type B\nclimates of the Southwest and Great Plains. In general, there are two different climate patterns common in North\nAmerica. The first pattern is that temperatures get warmer as you travel from north to south and get closer to the\nequator. The second pattern is that there is a decrease in precipitation as you move from east to west across the\ncontinent until you reach the Pacific Coast, where rainfall is abundant again.\nThe second climate pattern is created by the rain shadow effect of the western mountain ranges. As wet air masses\nmove from the Pacific Ocean over the North American continent, they run into the Cascades and the Sierra\nNevada. The Cascade ranges of Washington State and Oregon cut off moisture from falling on the leeward side\nof the mountains; thus eastern Washington State and eastern Oregon are semiarid. The western United States\nexperiences a strong rain shadow effect. As the air rises to pass the mountains, water vapor condenses and is\nreleased as rain and snow. This means that west of these mountain ranges there is much more precipitation than\nto their east, resulting in arid and semiarid lands. The entire Great Plains of the western United States are affected\nby the rain shadow effect and have a semiarid type B climate. 207 World Regional Geography\nEuropean Realms in North America\nBoth the United States and Canada are products of European colonialism. North America was inhabited by many\nNative American groups before the Europeans arrived. Complex native societies, federations, and traditional local\ngroups faced the European invasion. While the indigenous population of North America was robust at the time\nof the European encounter, within a few generations, these native peoples were overwhelmed by the diseases,\nweapons, and sheer numbers of the European arrivals.\nThe Europeans\u2014mainly the Spanish, French, and British\u2014left a strong imprint on their North American colonies.\nThe oldest colonial city in North America is St. Augustine, Florida (1565), founded by Spain when Florida was\na remote portion of the Spanish Americas. Spain also had outposts in what are now California, Arizona, New\nMexico, and Texas. The forms of settlement characteristic of those areas were similar to the Spanish colonies of\nCentral America. While Spain governed what is now the southern United States, France ruled Canada and much\nof the interior of the North American continent. The French first came to Canada in the late 1500s to engage in\nfishing in the North Atlantic and soon expanded their reach by creating a fur trade in the area surrounding the\nGreat Lakes and throughout the Mississippi River system.\nAlthough there were fewer settlers from France than from other European countries\u2014especially in what became\nthe United States\u2014this French era left behind place names (Baton Rouge and Detroit), patterns of land use, and\na French-speaking population in Canada. Despite the early influence of Spain and France in North America, most\nNorth Americans speak English as their native language as a result of Britain\u2019s colonial dominance in the United\nStates and Canada. The earliest permanent British colony, Jamestown, was founded in 1607 in what became\nVirginia. The British built up a successful empire in the New World. Their thirteen American colonies became\npopulous, economically robust, and militarily strong enough to gain independence in 1776. Canada functions as\nan independent country but remains part of the British Commonwealth.\nFigure 4.3 European Influence in the Colonial United States 4.1 Introducing the Realm 208\nMap courtesy of the National Park Service.\nPopulation Distribution in North America\nThe US population surpassed the three hundred million mark in 2006. Canada now has over thirty-four million\npeople. The US population is growing by about 2.5 million people each year. A little less than half the growth can\nbe attributed to immigration and the rest to birth rates. The pace of growth is slower than the world average but\nmore rapid than many other industrialized countries such as those in Europe.\nThe population is not uniformly spread over North America, nor are the population growth rates the same in all\nlocations. Most Canadians live in near proximity to the US border. The North American population tends to be\nclustered in cities, with about 80 percent of US citizens residing in urban\/suburban areas. Additionally, over time,\nthe population has been moving southward and westward. US states experiencing the greatest rates of population\ngrowth include those located on the southern portion of the eastern seaboard, as well as Texas, Nevada, Utah,\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington. Three states\u2014California, Texas, and Florida\u2014accounted for about a third of\nthe entire US population growth since 1990. Still, the Northeast is the most densely populated area of the country\nthanks, in large part, to the megalopolis that forms the corridor and encompasses the cities from Washington, DC, 209 World Regional Geography\nnorth to Boston. The largest concentration of Canadians lives in the most southern-reaching province of Ontario.\nFor this reason, the province of Ontario is often referred to as South Canada.\nIn general, the population of minorities is growing most rapidly. Some of the fastest-growing populations in the\nUnited States are Hispanics. Another interesting factor in population growth is the increase in life expectancy.\nAs more people live longer, the growth of the segment of the population aged sixty-five has doubled in the last\nfifty years. However, it appears that the growth of this population segment is slowing. Of this group, the greatest\nincrease was seen in people aged eighty-five years and older.\nThe American population tends to be on the move. The US Census Bureau data show that the average American\nmoves once every seven years; these data further predict that about forty million people move each year (US\nCensus Bureau). Data also indicate Americans will move to a metropolitan area. Urbanization has been a trend\nsince about 1950. Until that time, most Americans lived in small towns or more rural settings. The population\ndensity of the cities, and especially the suburban areas, has grown steadily since that time, bringing about a rural-\nto-urban population shift. Now a significant majority of people in North America live in suburban areas.\nUrbanization has brought some challenges. The layout of these areas often makes owning a car a necessity;\nthus traffic congestion is a major problem in many suburban and urban areas. Other issues that have arisen are\novercrowded schools, racial tensions, and a widening economic gap between the wealthy and impoverished. As\npeople move to the cities, housing and other resources might not be able to meet demand, forcing prices upward.\nThe gap between the cost of living in an urban area and the population\u2019s ability to pay has contributed to poverty\nand homelessness. Environmental issues also abound, including how to reduce or eliminate smog, manage waste,\nand ensure adequate clean water supplies.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The United States and Canada have mountain ranges along their eastern and western portions, with lowlands\nin the middle.\n\u2022 In general, temperatures get cooler as you move from south to north, and the climate gets more arid as you\nmove from east to west across the continent.\n\u2022 The Spanish were the earliest Europeans to establish a permanent settlement in the United States or Canada.\nThey controlled the territory in the southern edge of what is now the United States, and their influence is\nstill felt today through the Mexican American culture in that region.\n\u2022 The French colonized eastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River valley. Although the\nnumber of settlers was small outside Quebec, French place names and French land-use patterns are still\nevident.\n\u2022 The British colonized the eastern coast of what became the United States. The number of English-speaking\nsettlers was so high that the English culture dominated the region and left a strong long-term impact in terms\nof language, religion, and many other cultural aspects.\n\u2022 The more than 310 million people who live in the United States and the more than 34 million people who\nlive in Canada are not evenly distributed across North America. The realm continues to urbanize, and\nminority groups are the fastest-growing segment of the population. 4.1 Introducing the Realm 210\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Explain how the United States acquired its geographic boundaries.\n2. Examine patterns of immigration to and migration within the United States through the period of westward\nsettlement.\n3. Examine urban growth and its connection to development of new forms of transportation.\n4. Explain which economic patterns helped the United States become the world\u2019s largest economy.\n5. Consider how the concept of the American Dream has been exported globally.\nEarly Development Patterns\nWith abundant resources and opportunity, the original thirteen colonies prospered and expanded into what\nbecame the fifty US states. The political geography of this nation was a product of various treaties and acquisitions\nthat eventually resulted in the country extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Fueling the expansion\nwas the concept of Manifest Destiny: the belief of some Americans that the new nation was divinely predestined\nto expand across the continent. The United States negotiated with France for the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,\nacquiring millions of acres in the central United States (see Figure 4.5 \u201cGeopolitical Map of the Creation of the\nUnited States from the Atlantic to the Pacific\u201d). Florida was acquired from Spain in 1819, and Texas was annexed\nin 1845. The British sold portions of the Pacific Northwest to the United States, and the exact northern boundary\nbetween the United States and Canada was settled in 1846. Through conflicts with Mexico, large portions of the\nWest were ceded to the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. Alaska was purchased from the Russians in\n1867 for only $7.2 million. Alaska and Hawaii were the last two possessions to enter into statehood, which they\ndid in 1959.\n211 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 212\nFigure 4.4 The Thirteen Original Colonies\nFigure 4.5 Geopolitical Map of the Creation of the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific 213 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nManifest Destiny\nThe concept of Manifest Destiny came from the works of John O\u2019Sullivan in 1839. O\u2019Sullivan wrote,\nThe far-reaching, the boundless future will be the era of American greatness. In its magnificent domain of space and\ntime, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on\nearth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be\na hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation an Union of many Republics,\ncomprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God\u2019s natural and moral law\nof equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of \u201cpeace and good will amongst men\u201d (John L. O\u2019Sullivan).\nAs the United States developed, it acquired external colonial possessions. With victory over Spain in the Spanish-\nAmerican War of 1898, the US government gained control of the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and various\nPacific islands. Cuba and the Philippines later became independent countries, but Puerto Rico and Guam continue to be 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 214\npart of the United States. The US Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1918 after World War I as a location\nto provide strategic military support to protect the shipping lanes through the Caribbean and the Panama Canal.\nWestward Settlement Patterns and European Immigration\nThe thirteen original colonies are often grouped into three regions, each with its own economic and cultural\npatterns. These three areas\u2014New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South\u2014are considered culture hearths,\nor places where culture formed and from which it spread. The three regions were source areas for westward\nmigration, and migrants from these regions carried with them the cultural traditions of their culture hearths.\nNew England was characterized by poor soils, subsistence agriculture, and fishing communities and was the\nbirthplace of North America\u2019s Industrial Revolution. Its largest city was Boston. Settlers from New England\ntraveled west across New York State and into the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes region. The Mid-Atlantic\nregion, focused on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was known for its fertile soils, prosperous small-scale agriculture,\nand multinational population. Prosperous farming led to a vibrant economy and a robust network of towns and\ncities. People who wanted to migrate west from this region traveled down the Great Valley into the Appalachian\nMountains and across the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky, or they crossed Pennsylvania and traveled west via\nthe Ohio River valley. The heart of the South was Virginia, a region oriented around plantation agriculture. The\nSouth was overwhelmingly rural, and in time the bulk of its agricultural workforce consisted of slaves brought to\nthe United States from Subsaharan Africa.\nWestward migration was spurred along by the gold boom in California (1849) and by the completion of the\ntranscontinental railroad (1869). The settlement frontier pushed westward during the course of the nineteenth\ncentury and was declared \u201cclosed\u201d by the Bureau of the Census in 1890. This did not mean that settlers were\nspread uniformly across the continent by 1890; indeed, vast areas of the Great Plains and the mountain west\nremained sparsely populated by Europeans at that time. The Homestead Act of 1862 also encouraged westward\nmigration by offering 160 acres of free land to households willing to move west. The continental United States\nhad been organized into official states by the end of the nineteenth century, except Oklahoma (1907), Arizona\n(1912), and New Mexico (1912). 215 World Regional Geography\nFigure 4.6 The Holy Trinity Serb Orthodox Church in Butte, Montana\nThis church gives testimony to the impact that European immigration has had on the North American continent and the freedom of\nreligion that the US Constitution provides.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nMost US residents at its founding in 1776 had roots in Great Britain, with large numbers from other northern and\nwestern European countries and many others from Africa (most of whom were slaves in the South). During the\nnineteenth century, migrants continued to immigrate to the United States as its economy grew, especially after\nthe 1830s. Germans and Irish began arriving in large numbers, joining others from Britain and other countries,\npredominantly those in western Europe. As the century progressed, others from southern and eastern Europe, from\ncountries such as Italy, Russia, and Austria, became the most significant stream of immigrants to the United States.\nThe new arrivals were different from the early British immigrants: they practiced Roman Catholic or Eastern\nOrthodox Christianity (not Protestantism), they primarily moved to urban areas, and they found work in the new\nmanufacturing sector growing rapidly in the Northeast and around the Great Lakes. Very few immigrants came\nfrom Latin America or Asia at that time. 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 216\nIndustrial Development and Urbanization\nThe Industrial Revolution that began in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century eventually moved across\nthe Atlantic and took hold in the United States. Rapid industrial growth emerged in the nineteenth century and\nwas focused in the northeastern United States around the Great Lakes in an area called the Manufacturing\nBelt (Figure 4.7 \u201cManufacturing Belt Turned Rust Belt\u201d). Mechanized manufacturing began with textiles (New\nEngland), moved to steel and other metals (Pennsylvania and Indiana), and later was dominated by the\nmanufacture of automobiles (Michigan). Of course, manufacturing would not have been possible without an\nabundant supply of power. Coal mining became an important industry in western Pennsylvania and in Appalachia.\nManufacturing took place in the cities and towns of the Manufacturing Belt. Not until the second half of the\ntwentieth century did manufacturing move to rural areas; until then, it was almost entirely an urban activity. As\nthe United States went through its Industrial Revolution, its population shifted from being almost entirely rural to\nbeing mostly urban. In 1790, only about 5 percent of the US population lived in urban areas; by 1920, about 50\npercent lived in cities. As the rural to urban shift took place, the function and form of US cities also changed.\nFigure 4.7 Manufacturing Belt Turned Rust Belt 217 World Regional Geography\nTable 4.1 US Population and Percentage Urban 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 218\nYear Percentage Urban Population in Millions\n1790 5.1 3.9\n1810 7.3 7.2\n1830 8.8 12.9\n1850 15.4 23.2\n1870 25.7 38.6\n1890 35.1 63\n1910 45.6 92.2\n1930 56.1 123.2\n1950 60 151.3\n1970 73.6 203.3\n1990 75.2 248.7\n2010 82.0 308\nSource: \u201cThe World Factbook,\u201d Central Intelligence Agency, http:\/\/www.census.gov\/population\/censusdata\/table-4.pdf.\nFrom the colonial era until the late nineteenth century, US cities were walking cities. Because most Americans\nlived on farms, cities were small, compact, and centrally oriented: everything was located within walking distance.\nOnly wealthy people had access to transportation by horse, and city dwellers needed to live within a short\ndistance of where they worked, shopped, and carried out all their activities. The invention of the electric streetcar\n(1888) allowed cities to increase in size. People could live farther from their place of employment as long as\nthey lived within walking distance of a streetcar line. Streetcar suburbs grew up along streetcar lines, and these\nneighborhoods were often segregated by ethnicity and race. Fewer people lived in downtowns, which became\ndedicated to retail and manufacturing. Cities remained oriented around a central business district (CBD), which\nwas often located near the railway station. Factories needed to be near modes of transportation for both shipping\nin parts and shipping out completed products and so that workers could easily get to work.\nLarge numbers of middle class Americans began acquiring automobiles after about 1920; this eventually led to a\ncomplete rethinking of the spatial layout of the city. Automobile suburbs sprang up outside the traditional city\nlimits as people were able to buy homes far from streetcar lines or railway stations. Cities became increasingly\ndecentralized: people could go shopping in suburban malls instead of downtown department stores, factories\ncould spring up at highway interchanges and not only near rivers and the railroad, and people could live in one\nsuburb and work in another instead of living in the suburbs and working downtown. Neighborhoods became even\nmore racially and economically segregated than they had in the past as middle-class whites moved into the new\nautomobile suburbs and left the poorer African Americans behind in the cities.\nBy the late twentieth century, the automobile had led to a new urban form: the edge city. Edge cities are areas\nof dense urban development outside the boundaries of the traditional city. They often form at the intersection\nof major interstate highways and contain shopping malls, office complexes, high-rise apartment buildings, 219 World Regional Geography\nindustrial parks, restaurants, and hotels. Sometimes edge cities are called suburban downtowns. Edge cities have\nsupplanted the CBD as the destination of choice for Americans, whether they are heading to work or to play.\nEconomic Changes\nFor the purpose of understanding economic geography, all economic activities can be grouped into one of four\ncategories, each with its respective terms, depending on the nature of what is being produced:\n1. Primary economic sector activities include everything that pertains to the collection of raw materials,\nsuch as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining\u2014in other words, growing and extracting activities.\n2. Secondary economic sector activities involve the processing of those raw materials through\nmanufacturing, which has been the mainstay of economic growth for most developed countries.\n3. Tertiary economic sector activities are those that produce services, not physical products.\n4. Quaternary economic sector activities are those that deal with information collecting and processing,\nas well as management.\nThe tertiary and quaternary economic sectors are often thought of together as the service sector. In the explanation\nof how countries gain national income (Section 1.4 \u201cGlobalization and Development\u201d), only primary and\nsecondary activities produce actual physical products, and manufacturing traditionally earns the highest value-\nadded profits. Tertiary activities are selective in gaining national wealth. For example, service activities such as\ntourism can bring in national wealth if the visitors are from outside the country. Tourism within a country can also\ninfluence economic conditions by increasing the amount of consumer spending.\nDuring the colonial era and into the nineteenth century, when the majority of Americans lived on farms and\nworked in agriculture, most economic activity in the United States took place within the primary economic sector.\nToday, the primary sector is still an important component of the US economy, but far fewer people are employed\nin it. For example, less than 1 percent of Americans make their living by farming, but agricultural output has\ncontinued to grow because of advancements in mechanization and the development of high-tech seeds, fertilizers,\nand pesticides. The United States has been able to export surplus agricultural output to other parts of the world.\nFewer people work in coal mines than in the past, but because of new mining technologies and methods such as\nmountaintop removal, coal production remains high.\nThe geographic distribution of primary activities depends both on the location of natural features such as physical 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 220\ngeography and climate and on the location of the market for a particular crop or resource. The nineteenth-century\nGerman economist Johann von Th\u00fcnen created a model that predicted land use around a central market. In his\ntheory, land closest to the market would be used to produce crops that were expensive to transport, such as dairy.\nLand far from the market would be used for the production of crops that were less expensive to transport and\nless perishable, such as grain. The von Th\u00fcnen model predicts a series of concentric rings surrounding a central\nmarket, with each ring producing a different kind of crop. If the von Th\u00fcnen model is applied at a much larger\nscale to the United States as a whole, with the densely populated urban zone from Boston to Washington, DC\n(called a megalopolis), used as the central market, the model does a fairly good job predicting the United States\u2019\nagricultural land use. Dairy farms are found close to the market, grain farms are farther away, and ranch lands\nused for livestock production are even farther away.\nFigure 4.8 The von Th\u00fcnen Model 221 World Regional Geography\nThe von Th\u00fcnen model as it relates to the development west of the East Coast megalopolis. For example, New Jersey is called the\nGarden State, Appalachia has its forests, the Midwest has its agricultural production, and the Great Plains has its large cattle ranching\noperations. This model was more applicable in past centuries for local communities when modern transportation technology was not\navailable.\nFigure 4.9 Farm Resource Regions 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 222\nSource: Map courtesy of the US Department of Agriculture.\nAnything that involves the processing of raw materials\u2014manufacturing\u2014is a secondary activity. As the United\nStates moved into the Industrial Revolution and into the mid-twentieth century, the percentage of the US\nworkforce involved in manufacturing grew from almost nothing until it peaked in the late 1970s. It was the\nmain area of economic growth for decades. Although manufacturing was present in most areas of the country,\nit was focused in the northeastern United States and along the Great Lakes. Factories were close both to the\nreserves of labor and to the markets for manufactured products found in the densely populated Northeast. The steel\nindustry was located in Pittsburgh and its environs because of the area\u2019s access to iron ore (mined in Minnesota\nand transported via the Great Lakes) and to coal (mined in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other parts of\nAppalachia).\nAs manufacturing has grown in other parts of the world, the secondary economic sector has declined in the United\nStates. US labor statistics indicate that the United States lost about five million manufacturing jobs between 2000\nand 2010 (Nance-Nash, S.). Many of these jobs were lost to countries with lower labor costs, such as Mexico or\nChina.\nThe third group of economic activities takes place in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, commonly known as\nthe service sector. Tertiary and quaternary activities create services, not physical products. Service jobs include\neverything from engineering to finance, restaurants to sports, and childcare to medicine. The tertiary sector makes\nup more than three quarters of the US economy, as measured by its share of the gross domestic product (GDP),\nwhich is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year. The GDP is then divided by\nthe country\u2019s population to provide a GDP per capita statistic. The 2010 estimated GDP composition by sector\nfor the United States is shown in Table 4.2 \u201cUS GDP by Sector (2010 Data)\u201d. 223 World Regional Geography\nTable 4.2 US GDP by Sector (2010 Data)\nEconomic Sector GDP (%)\nAgriculture 1.2\nIndustry and mining 22.2\nServices 76.7\nSource: \u201cThe World Factbook,\u201d Central Intelligence Agency, https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/publications\/the-world-factbook\/geos\/us.html.\nThese figures show that the United States has shifted to a postindustrial service economy. The rise of the\ninformation age in the latter part of the twentieth century shifted the workforce into the information sector. By the\nstart of the twenty-first century, less than 2 percent of the US workforce was employed in agriculture, 15 percent\nin industry, and the rest in services (18 percent) and information activities (65 percent).\nThe locations of service-sector jobs are much more flexible than are jobs in the primary or secondary sectors.\nThey are called footloose jobs: an accountant can live in New York or in Denver, whereas it is much more\ndifficult for factories to move from one place to another and it is impossible for farms to relocate. Many of\nthe information-technology jobs are emerging in the southern regions of the United States called the Sun Belt.\nSouthern cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix are centers of innovation and population growth. The warmer\nclimate, combined with a lower cost of living and less congestion, makes the Sun Belt an attractive location for\nemerging information-based companies. Note that the popularity of the South and West for service-sector jobs\nonly came about after the invention and adoption of air-conditioning. Air-conditioning was not widespread until\nafter the Second World War in the 1950s.\nWhile the population of the Southern states has increased, the population of some Northern states has decreased.\nThe Sun Belt has always been a destination for people escaping the harsh winters of the Northern states. This\nhas usually been only a seasonal transition. However, the new trend is one of permanent growth because of the\nincrease in information technologies and in the service industry. Emerging companies looking to establish their\nbusinesses have targeted major cities from the Carolinas to the Southwest. 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 224\nMigration Patterns\nThe United States has not only undergone a massive rural-to-urban shift in its population; intermigration within\nthe United States from one region to another has also been prevalent. Each of the US regions has witnessed\nchanges in demographics because of migration patterns.\nIn the agricultural regions of the United States, such as the Midwest, the migration pattern has been caused\nby changes in farm technology. Portions of the United States were opened up for agriculture because of the\nHomestead Act of 1862, where each person could receive 160 acres from the government to start a farm. They\ncould keep the acres if they lived on them and farmed them for a period of years. In the 1800s, 160 acres was\nenough land to support a family if conditions were appropriate. The Industrial Revolution brought about improved\nfarm equipment and technology. Larger and more expensive tractors and improved farming methods pushed the\nsmall farmers to sell out. Farms increased in size and fewer people were required to operate them. Since fewer\nfarm workers are needed in rural areas, there has been a major rural-to-urban shift in the population. Central cities\nare increasing in population, while small towns and rural areas in the Midwest and across the nation are decreasing\nin population.\nAmericanism and Globalization\nThe freedom of personal expression in the United States has supported individual ingenuity and creative ambition\nto create the largest economy in the world. US citizens have pushed American corporations to become a major\nforce in the world markets. Products and franchises from the United States are being distributed throughout the\nworld. Items such as fast food, computers, news networks, and Hollywood movies have become the products\nof choice in countries across the globe. The English language dominates the Internet, which has been heavily\ninfluenced by US corporations. The power of the American Dream\u2014the idea that through hard work anyone can\nachieve upward mobility and financial success\u2014as it is portrayed in the US media holds sway in the minds of\npeople both in the United States and abroad. 225 World Regional Geography\nFigure 4.10 US Corporate McDonald\u2019s Franchise in Israel\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nUS news networks, such as CNN, are so dominant that small countries, having no resources to create networks,\nrely on the US networks to deliver their world news. US fast food franchises, of which McDonald\u2019s is the largest,\nexist in over one hundred countries. Despite humble beginnings in Arkansas, Walmart grew to become the world\u2019s\nlargest corporation. It has become the buyer and seller of retail trade that shapes and molds cultural attitudes and\nfashions internationally.\nThe size of the US population (more than 310 million strong as of 2010) and the country\u2019s vast resource base have\nallowed it to become a world military superpower. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States became\nthe most powerful military force in the world. The United States has also dominated the world\u2019s economy and its\ncommunications networks. The advancements of multinational corporations have in essence enabled the sale of\nAmerica to the rest of the world. The selling of American products and the large consumer market in the United\nStates have provided the profits that have fueled global economic markets. 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 226\nThe United States has become a worldwide franchise of its own. Corporate colonialism has advanced the\nAmerican brand to a level that is now synonymous with consumerism, success, and power worldwide. Media\nadvancements have promoted the concept of the American Dream across the seven seas. The reaction of the global\ncommunity includes both admiration and disdain. Many view Americanism as interchangeable with globalization.\nSome welcome it; others reject it. The country of Iran is an example of this dichotomy. Young people in Iran\nwearing blue jeans gather in secret to watch American television programming from a hidden illegal satellite dish,\nwhile at the same time the anti-American forces in their government condemn America as decadent, immoral, and\nimperialistic.\nCorporate colonialism has become a dominant force impacting the global cultural fabric. Supporters appreciate\naccess to American goods and services, while opponents claim that the English language and the American\ncorporate franchise system are destroying the culture and heritage of untold millions who see their unique\ntraditional ways of life being overshadowed and destroyed.\nSome argue that American television advertisements exemplify a trend that supports conformity and uniformity\nin American culture. They contend that America\u2019s unique cultural diversity, which historically has provided\ningenuity and creativity, is being eroded by the franchising of similar retail products, fast food, professional\nsports, and Hollywood entertainment that stifle the creative will of the American people. Others continue to see\nopportunities to pursue the American Dream and believe that innovation and ideas continue to emerge in spite of\nthese trends.\nFigure 4.11 227 World Regional Geography\nWalmart is one of the greatest success stories of the American Dream. It started in Arkansas with one store and grew to become the\nlargest corporation in the world. Now it is one of the most aggressive forces of corporate colonialism across the globe.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nMany people worry about the future of the American Dream. American culture continues to evolve as people face\nchanging economic and social conditions. Over the course of their history, Americans have faced both difficult\nand prosperous times, and now the future of this vibrant country is in the hands of the current generation. The\nUnited States has developed into one of the most powerful countries on the planet. Will the American Dream\ncontinue to motivate people in the future? Only time will tell.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The United States\u2019 territory expanded gradually through various treaties and land acquisitions and was\ninfluenced by the concept of Manifest Destiny.\n\u2022 The three main colonial regions in the United States\u2014New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South\u2014had\ntheir own distinct economic foundations, settlement patterns, and social structures. People from these\nregions moved westward in particular migration patterns.\n\u2022 In the beginning of the nineteenth century, most immigrants were from western and northern Europe. By the\nend of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, immigrants were coming in large\nnumbers from southern and Eastern Europe and moving to industrial cities of the Northeast.\n\u2022 City structure changed from the walking cities of colonial America, to the railroad and streetcar cities of the\nlate nineteenth century, to the automobile cities of the mid- and late-twentieth century.\n\u2022 The US economy was initially based in the primary economic sector (particularly farming), then was based\nin the secondary economic sector (manufacturing), and is now oriented around the tertiary and quaternary\neconomic sectors (services and information).\n\u2022 The diverse immigrants who have created American society have been unified by common aspirations and\ncommon ideals that created the concept of the American Dream. The concept indicates that regardless of\none\u2019s station in life, by working hard, applying oneself, and following the rules, one can obtain upward\neconomic mobility. 4.2 United States: Early Development and Globalization 228\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Explain the concepts of the cultural melting pot and the American Dream and how they have contributed to\nAmerican society and culture. 231 World Regional Geography\n2. Describe the current demographic profile of the United States.\n3. Identify the size, distribution, and other characteristics of the Hispanic population in the United States.\n4. Explain the two most significant processes that led to the spatial distribution of African Americans in the\nUnited States.\n5. Describe the distribution of the dominant religious affiliations in the United States.\nThe American \u201cMelting Pot\u201d\nEarly immigration to America was dominated by people from the British Isles, resulting in an American\npopulation for whom speaking English and practicing Protestant Christianity was the norm. There were some\nregional exceptions to this, such as Catholicism in Maryland and the widespread speaking of German in\nPennsylvania, but by and large English and Protestantism were standard in the American colonies. As migrants\narrived in the United States from non-English-speaking countries, within a generation they learned English and\nassimilated into American society, giving rise to the idea of the United States as a cultural melting pot. People\nwere drawn to the United States by the hope of economic opportunities; most immigrants were poor and came\nto the United States to make a living and improve their financial well-being. They viewed assimilation into\nmainstream society as a necessity for success. They believed in the American Dream\u2014that through hard work,\nyou could achieve upward mobility and financial success no matter your background. The dream came true for\nmillions of Americans but remains out of reach for many who live in poverty.\nAs of 2010, the United States was home to approximately 310 million people and was the third-most populated\ncountry in the world after China and India. Among developed countries, the US population is one of the fastest\ngrowing, at about 1 percent each year. This is thanks to a fertility rate of about 2.1 that is higher than the 1.5 for\nthat of most European countries, as well as a positive net migration rate (more people immigrating to the United\nStates than emigrating from it). In terms of human well-being, life expectancy is more than seventy-eight years\nfor men, and the average woman can expect to live more than eighty years. While this may seem high, especially\nwhen compared with a century ago, life expectancy in the United States is lower than in forty-nine other countries.\nAlthough English has remained the dominant language, as a country of immigrants, the United States is home to\npeople from all corners of the world and home to many cultural or ethnic minority groups. According to the 2010\ncensus, the ethnic minority groups in the United States included 16.3 percent Hispanic (who can be of any race); 4.3 United States: Population and Religion 232\n12.6 percent black or African American; 5.0 percent Asian and Pacific Islander; and 1.0 percent Native American\n(American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts) (US Census Bureau). An interesting trend is that Asians are growing\nfaster than any other ethnic group in California, the nation\u2019s largest state. The 2010 census reported that the Asian\npopulation in California had increased 31.5 percent since 2000 to a total of five million.\nThe US Hispanic Population\nOne of the most striking shifts in immigration patterns of the past few decades has been the dramatic increase\nin Hispanic\/Latino immigrants to the United States. While there have long been Spanish speakers living in the\nUnited States (recall that Spain colonized Florida, Texas, and the Southwest before those regions became part of\nthe United States), for most of American history the Hispanic minority had little impact outside of a few areas\nof the country. In 1970, Hispanics made up less than 5 percent of the US population, but by 2010, forty-eight\nmillion Hispanics made up about 16 percent of the population (Figure 4.13 \u201cHispanic Population in the United\nStates and the US Sun Belt\u201d). For the first time, Hispanics were the largest ethnic minority in the United States,\nsurpassing blacks as the largest minority starting with the 2000 US census (12.5 percent Hispanic compared with\n12.3 percent black). The US Hispanic population doubled between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Between 2000\nand 2006, Hispanic population growth accounted for about half the nation\u2019s growth and grew about four times\nfaster than the country\u2019s population as a whole.\nThe growth of the US Hispanic population is a direct result of increased immigration from Latin America to the\nUnited States in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries (Hoefer, M., et. al., 2011) and the Hispanic\npopulation having higher fertility rates than the non-Hispanic US population (Archibold, R. C., 2011). 233 World Regional Geography\nFigure 4.13 Hispanic Population in the United States and the US Sun Belt\nMap courtesy of NationalAtlas.\nNearly half the Hispanics in the United States live in California or Texas, although there has been a large\nincrease in the Hispanic population outside those states in the past decade, especially in the South. For example,\nArkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and North and South Carolina all experienced Hispanic population growth rates\nbetween 55 and 61 percent from 2000 to 2006. All regions of the country saw double-digit growth rates of their\nHispanic populations during that time. In places such as California, the large Hispanic population has an especially\nsignificant impact on the economy, politics, and every aspect of social life: more than one-third of Californians\nare Hispanic (37 percent), while 42 percent are non-Hispanic white, and a much smaller minority are African\nAmerican (7 percent).\nWho are the Hispanics living in the United States? Most were born in the United States (60 percent), while the\nrest are immigrants. Two thirds are either from Mexico or of Mexican descent, while others hail from the US\nterritory of Puerto Rico, Cuba, or the Dominican Republic. Note that all Puerto Ricans are US citizens and can\nmove to and from the US mainland without any special documentation requirements. More Hispanics come from\nCentral America than from South America. Hispanics work in all professions but are found in professions such as\nagriculture, construction, and food service at higher rates than the country\u2019s non-Hispanic population. 4.3 United States: Population and Religion 234\nFigure 4.14 Hispanic Population in the United States, 1970\u20132050\nSource: Data from the US Census Bureau, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 Decennial Censuses; Population Projections, July 1, 2010, to\nJuly 1, 2050.\nFigure 4.15 235 World Regional Geography\nTwo men tried to cross the US border from the Mexican side with a homemade ladder built of rebar. They hooked the ladder to the\nwall. One man climbed over and was arrested by the US Border Patrol; the other man ran away and was arrested by the Mexican\nborder police.\nOmar Barcena \u2013 La Frontera \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe draw of opportunities and advantages has always pulled people toward the United States. While many of 4.3 United States: Population and Religion 236\nthe Latin American immigrants enter the United States legally, according to the US Department of Homeland\nSecurity\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics, there were about 10.8 million undocumented immigrants residing in\nthe United States as of 2010; 62 percent are from Mexico (US Department of Homeland Security). This number\nis lower than it was in previous years, possibly because of the economic recession and higher-than-usual rates\nof unemployment. The US-Mexican border is about 1,970 miles long and runs through an arid and open region\nbetween the two countries. It is difficult to control the illegal immigration across this border, as the attraction to\nAmerican jobs is so compelling that people will risk death to cross the deserts of the Southwest. According to 2010\nestimates, undocumented workers make up about 5 percent of the United States\u2019 civilian workforce, including\napproximately 24 percent of the agricultural workforce.\nThe amount of remittances sent from undocumented workers in the United States to Mexico is estimated in the\nbillions of dollars. The remittances from Mexican nationals living outside Mexico and sending money home to\ntheir families are Mexico\u2019s second-largest source of foreign income. Without remittances, many Mexican families\nwould have a difficult time making ends meet.\nThe African American Population\nMost African Americans were concentrated in the South before the Civil War, where they worked as slaves in the\ncotton and tobacco plantations that supported the region. In some counties, blacks made up most of the population,\nand this did not change when the war was over. Many of the newly freed slaves remained as poor agricultural\nworkers in the South well into the twentieth century. Even as late as 1910, seven out of every eight African\nAmericans lived in the South. 237 World Regional Geography\nFigure 4.16 Civil War Division in the United States, 1861\u20131865\nUnion States are in the north, Confederate States are in the south, and border states are in the middle.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as the industrialization of northern cities was accelerating, the\nincreased need for factory workers was largely met by immigration from Europe, especially from southern and\neastern Europe. However, when the First World War began (1914), European immigration began to slow down.\nEuropean immigration then nearly ground to a halt in the 1920s as Americans set quotas in place to reduce the\nnumber of Eastern European immigrants. At that time, the factories in the Manufacturing Belt continued to need\nworkers, but instead of European workers, they recruited African Americans from the South.\nThis led to a massive migration of blacks from the South to cities of the North and West. This migration was so\nsignificant to African Americans in the United States that it is called the Great Migration. Between 1910 and\n1925, more than 10 percent of African Americans made the journey north, and even more followed. Examining\na map of the distribution of African Americans today shows the legacy of the Great Migration, as blacks live in\nmany parts of the United States, both in the South and in postindustrial cities of the north and the Midwest. Blacks\nalso now live in Sun Belt cities, as people of all races look for jobs related to the new information technologies\nand service industries. 4.3 United States: Population and Religion 238\nFigure 4.17 Black\/African American Population by County, 2000\nMap courtesy of NationalAtlas.\nGeography of Religion in the United States\nMost early settlers to the United States were Protestant Christians: Puritans lived in New England and Anglicans\n(later called Episcopalians) lived in Virginia. Roman Catholic immigrants settled in Maryland, and members of\nthe Society of Friends (Quakers) founded Pennsylvania. Even within that overall picture, there was a great deal of\nreligious diversity in the United States, and that diversity increased as new arrivals came from different countries\nwith different religious backgrounds. The current pattern of religious affiliation in the United States remains quite 239 World Regional Geography\ncomplex, and one can find observers of nearly every major religion, and many minor ones, in virtually every\narea of the country. That being said, there are clear patterns to the geography of religion in the United States that\ntell stories of immigration and migration history, as well as stories about other aspects of American history. The\nmap of leading church bodies (Figure 4.18 \u201cDistribution of Religious Organizations in the United States\u201d) shows\nregions of religious observance that are worth examining.\nFigure 4.18 Distribution of Religious Organizations in the United States\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe most striking feature of the map is the block of red in the Southeast in which Baptist churches are the leading\nchurch body. Although Baptist churches are the leading religious body in about 45 percent of all counties in the\nUnited States, most of those counties are found in the South. This region is considered the nation\u2019s Bible Belt, and\nit is a region in which churches are more likely than in other parts of the country to teach a literal interpretation of\nthe Bible. Baptist churches grew in popularity in the South after the Civil War as more liturgical denominations 4.3 United States: Population and Religion 240\nsuch as Methodists went into decline, and Baptist churches are popular among both African American and white\nresidents.\nFigure 4.19\nDehart\u2019s Bible and Tire is located in the peripheral region of eastern Kentucky in the Bible Belt. Customers get a free Bible with\nevery set of new tires.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nAnother interesting Protestant region is northern Appalachia and the lower Midwest from Ohio to Iowa and\nKansas. As seen on the map, some of these counties are Baptist, in some of them the strongest church presence\nis Methodist, and in others it is Christian churches (Disciples of Christ and historically similar denominations)\nthat prevail. The Methodist and other Christian areas were heavily influenced by the Second Great Awakening\nof the early nineteenth century, which promoted the theology that every person could be saved through revivals.\nThe movement provided for strong showings of Protestant denominations that arose during that time. The third\nProtestant region is the northern Midwest and Great Plains: Minnesota, the Dakotas, and surrounding areas. This\nwas the destination of German and Scandinavian Lutheran settlers during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, and the leading denominations today in much of that area remain Lutheran.\nThe Roman Catholic Church, which is the leading religious body in 40 percent of US counties, is well represented\nin the Northeast, West, and Southwest. In the Northeast and Midwest, the Catholic dominance points to\nnineteenth- and early twentieth-century immigration from Roman Catholic countries in Europe such as Italy,\nIreland, and Poland. Those earlier Catholics have been joined more recently by large numbers of Hispanic 241 World Regional Geography\nimmigrants. The dominance of Roman Catholics in the western United States, the Southwest, and even Florida in\nthe Southeast are a reflection of the strong Hispanic presence in those parts of the country.\nIn the western United States, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon church or LDS) dominates\na region including Utah and surrounding states.

As\nof 2011, Canada had a population of just over thirty-four million (2011), which is less than the population of\nCalifornia. Canada is larger than the United States, making it the second-largest country in the world. However,\ndespite this vast territory for a relatively small population, more than 90 percent of Canadians live within 150 245 World Regional Geography\nmiles of the US border. Northern Canada is not considered part of Canada\u2019s ecumene, or habitable zone, for\npermanent human settlement. Only a narrow band of territory in southern and eastern Canada has the climate and\nphysical geography suitable for agricultural production and widespread settlement. Moreover, Canada\u2019s economy\nis so closely tied to that of the United States that it makes sense for people to live close to the US border.\nCanada consists of ten provinces and three territories (see Table 4.3 \u201cCanadian Provinces, Territories, and\nCapitals\u201d). Ottawa is the nation\u2019s capital, and Toronto is its largest city.\nTable 4.3 Canadian Provinces, Territories, and Capitals\nPopulation Province\/Territory Capital\nNewfoundland St. Johns\nNova Scotia Halifax\nMaritime Provinces of the east 2.3 million\nNew Brunswick Fredericton\nPrince Edward Island Charlottetown\nFrench Canada 7.9 million Quebec Quebec (City)\nSouth Canada 13.2 million Ontario Toronto\nManitoba Winnipeg\nPrairie Provinces 6.0 million Saskatchewan Regina\nAlberta Edmonton\nPacific Canada 4.5 million British Columbia Victoria\nYukon Whitehorse\nTerritories About 110,000 Northwest Territories Yellowknife\nNunavut Iqaluit 4.4 Canada 246\nPhysical Geography of Canada\nAs you can see from Table 4.3 \u201cCanadian Provinces, Territories, and Capitals\u201d, Ontario has by far the largest\npopulation of any of Canada\u2019s provinces, with about 39 percent of the total. Quebec, the dominantly French-\nspeaking province, is home to about 23 percent. Almost everyone else lives in British Colombia, west of the\nRocky Mountains (13 percent); in the prairies (18 percent); or along the Atlantic coast (7 percent). The wide-open\nareas of Canada\u2019s far north are occupied by only one-third of 1 percent of the population.\nType D (continental) climates dominate most of central Canada, with their characteristically warm summers and\ncold winters, although the farther north you go, the cooler the summers are. Canada\u2019s west coast receives the\nmost rainfall\u2014between eighty and one hundred inches a year\u2014while coastal areas in the Maritime Provinces can\nreceive up to sixty inches per year. The northern territory of Nunavut barely receives ten inches per year, usually\nin the form of snow. Of course, far northern Canada has an arctic type E climate, and conditions there are so harsh\nthat only a very few people inhabit it. The cultural influence of the colder climates and the long winters on the\npeople is evident by the sports that are enjoyed by most Canadian citizens. Ice hockey is Canada\u2019s most prevalent\nsport and its most popular spectator sport. Other sports such as curling are also common in Canada.\nFigure 4.21 The Canadian Curling Team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino 247 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nCanada has abundant natural resources for its population. The Canadian Shield is an area of rock and forest\nthat covers much of central Canada around the Hudson Bay. This region, and the area to the east and west of\nit, provides timber and minerals for Canadian industries and for export. In the Maritime Provinces of the east,\nthe main economic activities include fishing and agriculture. Some of Canada\u2019s best farmland is located along\nthe St. Lawrence River and in the southern Prairie Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. The St.\nLawrence River region includes dairy farms and agriculture, which provide food for the larger cities of the region.\nThe province of Ontario has fertile farmland on the north and east sides of the Great Lakes. The farmland in the\nPrairie Provinces has much larger grain and beef operations.\nCentered in the province of Alberta is a large region of fossil fuel exploration. Coal, oil, and natural gas are found\nthere in abundance, and much of it is exported to the United States for profit. Oil is found absorbed in surface\nsoil called tar sands and is being extracted for energy. When tar sands are heated, the oil is separated and refined\nfor fuel. Projections are that there is more oil in the tar sands of Canada than in the underground reserves of\nSaudi Arabia. Natural resources have even filtered into the cultural arena: Edmonton\u2019s professional hockey team\nis called the Edmonton Oilers. 4.4 Canada 248\nFigure 4.22 Physical Features of Canada\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0.\nThe Rocky Mountains and the coastal ranges located in western Canada provide for mining and lumber mills.\nVancouver, on the coast in British Columbia, has become a major port for Canada to export and import goods\nto and from the Pacific Rim. The Yukon Territory, also located in the mountains, has experienced a gold rush in\nyears past. Canada has adequate natural resources to provide for its people and gain wealth. 249 World Regional Geography\nBritish versus French Canada\nAs explained in Section 4.1 \u201cIntroducing the Realm\u201d, French fishermen and fur traders initially colonized Canada,\nthe British later took it from the French, and immigrants from various other countries moved there to farm and\notherwise make a living. Although none of the provinces retain French names, countless cities\u2014especially in\nQuebec\u2014have French names, among them Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Charlesbourg, and Beauport.\nThe names of several provinces indicate the British connection: Nova Scotia means \u201cNew Scotland,\u201d and it was\nso named by the British when they took over the island from the French. Prince Edward Island was named for\nthe father of the famous nineteenth-century British queen, Victoria. You can see remnants of British colonialism\nin the way Canadian government is organized. Canada, like many countries of Europe, including Great Britain,\nis a parliamentary democracy. The monarch of the United Kingdom is still the top-ranking government official in\nCanada, but only as a figurehead. The queen (or king) appoints a governor general to be her (or his) representative\nin the Canadian federal government. Again, this is a symbolic position. There are two chambers, a House of\nCommons and a Senate. Members of the House of Commons are elected and are called members of Parliament\n(MPs). Senators are appointed to a lifelong term by the prime minister.\nAs of 2006, about 58 percent of Canadians spoke English as their primary language, French was the mother\ntongue of 22 percent, and another one-fifth of the population (20 percent) spoke a mother tongue other than\nEnglish or French (Province and Territory, 2006). For most of Canada the lingua franca remains English. The\nFrench-speaking portion of Canada is a reminder of Canada\u2019s history as a French colony. Many of today\u2019s French\nspeakers are descendants of those earlier French settlers. The proportion of French speakers in Canada is declining\nas more and more immigrants (who also have higher fertility rates than Francophones [French speakers]) arrive\nfrom other parts of the world and as more Francophones begin using English instead of French as their primary\nlanguage. The new immigrants (along with native peoples) make up the 20 percent of Canada\u2019s population who\nspeak neither English nor French as their native language. About 90 percent of Canadian Francophones live in\nQuebec, which is a center of French culture in Canada.\nThe separation between French Canada and British Canada goes back to colonial times. Beginning in the 1530s,\nthe French were the first to develop fur-trading activities in the region and colonize what is present-day Canada,\ncalling it New France. The French claimed much of the St. Lawrence River valley and the Great Lakes region,\nincluding the region that is now Ontario. When Britain began to dominate the eastern coast of North America in\nthe 1680s, they entered into a series of wars with France. As a result of these wars, New France was eventually\nturned over to Britain.\nNot wanting continued war with France, Britain allowed the French-dominated region to retain its land ownership\nsystem, civil laws, and Catholic faith. The Revolutionary War in 1776, which granted the United States\nindependence from Great Britain, also pushed many people of English descent\u2014especially those who had sided\nwith the British during the Revolutionary War\u2014from the United States into Canada. British North America no\nlonger included the United States; Canada became the main British colony in North America. 4.4 Canada 250\nFigure 4.23 Bilingual Stop Sign in Ottawa, Ontario 251 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nIn an attempt to keep the peace between French and English settlers, in 1791 the British Parliament divided\nQuebec into Upper and Lower Canada, which later evolved into the provinces of English-speaking Ontario and\nFrench-speaking Quebec. The Maritime Provinces of the east were then separated into individual provinces.\nThe cultural differences between Francophone Canada and the rest of Canada have since erupted into serious\npolitical conflicts. The Francophone areas, mainly southern Quebec, argue that they are treated unfairly, since they\nhave to learn English but the rest of the country is not required to learn French.\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, many people in Quebec supported a separatist movement that\nsought to break Quebec off from the rest of Canada into an independent country. In the 1980s, the separatist\ninitiative lost in a public vote, but only by a small margin. The issue of Quebec\u2019s sovereignty continued to be\nraised in the public arena. In 1998, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Quebec could not separate from the rest of\nCanada under international law but that the matter would have to be negotiated between Quebec and the rest of\nCanada if secession was to proceed.\nFrench and English are the two official languages of the Canadian government as a whole, but the French people\nin Quebec, fearing that English was dominating the media, the Internet, and industry to such an extent that it was\nendangering their French culture, have declared French as the only official language of the province. To combat\nthe encroachment of English, laws were enacted in Quebec requiring all public advertising to be in French, or if\nother languages are used, they must be half the size of the French letters. All businesses employing more than fifty\nemployees are required to conduct all business in French. Immigrants who wish to be citizens of Quebec must\nlearn French. All primary and secondary education takes place in French unless the child\u2019s parents were educated\nin English elsewhere in Canada. Civil servants dubbed the \u201clanguage police\u201d monitor and enforce the French\nlanguage laws. A business found to be out of compliance with the language laws could be fined or shut down.\nEven though the official language of Quebec is French, since the national government takes place in both English\nand French, some services are still available in Quebec in English.\nFrench Canada does not include the entire province of Quebec. Northern Quebec has traditionally been native\nCree territory. When the initiative for Quebec to secede from Canada was being considered, an additional initiative\nwas presented by the Cree to separate northern Quebec from the French region of Quebec. This would have\ncaused the French separatist region of Quebec to lose major hydroelectric dams and important mineral and timber\nreserves. Other regions of Quebec that did not hold a French majority would then have promoted separating from\nQuebec and joining Ontario.\nFor Quebec to remain economically competitive, they would need the northern Cree region to remain part of the\nprovince to use the resources and energy found there. They would also need the businesses currently in Quebec\nto stay there, although many would probably have left if Quebec had become an independent state with French\nas the only language. When secession was being considered, it was found that businesses that employed more\nthan fifty employees did not want to switch over and conduct all their business in French; they were conducting\nall their business in English to work with the global economic community. In 1994, the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) was established between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The goal was to\nopen up new lines of business operations between the three countries and to increase economic opportunities\nto better compete with the European Union and the Pacific Rim nations. What would Quebec do if it separated 4.4 Canada 252\nfrom Canada? Would Quebec be able to join the NAFTA agreement? What if the other NAFTA partners cut\noff Quebec? Quebec would have faced serious economic consequences if they had separated from Canada. A\nnumber of English-speaking businesses have already moved to Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, to\navoid changing to French. It appears Quebec will remain with the rest of Canada and work out any internal cultural\nissues.\nFigure 4.24 Skyline of Toronto, One of the Most Diverse Cities in North America\nMarcin Wichary \u2013 United \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 253 World Regional Geography\nOther Ethnic Groups in Canada\nOf course, we cannot forget the native groups who were displaced when the Europeans arrived. About 1.2 million\npeople who identify themselves as Aboriginal live in Canada, or about 3.8 percent of the total population. They\ninclude North American Indians (also called First Nations), M\u00e9tis (descendants of both Europeans and American\nIndians), and Inuit (inhabitants of the far Arctic north). Of those three groups, Inuit are the smallest, with only\nabout fifty thousand remaining. These native people represent more than six hundred recognized groups and sixty-\nfive language dialects, although only a handful of these languages are still spoken by a large enough core of people\nto remain viable languages for the long term.\nCountless place names in Canada, just as in the United States, derive from native words. For example, the city of\nQuebec is built at the original head of navigation on the St. Lawrence River. Its name comes from an Algonquin\nword for \u201cwhere the river narrows.\u201d The word Canada is likely derived from the St. Lawrence Iroquois word\nKanata, meaning \u201cvillage\u201d or \u201csettlement.\u201d While the French explorer Jacques Cartier was traveling up the St.\nLawrence River in 1535, the indigenous peoples directed him to a specific village, the future Quebec City, using\nthe word Kanata. He later used Canada to refer to the general area, and European mapmakers adopted it for the\nentire region.\nQuebec is not the only place where devolutionary forces have been dividing cultural groups in Canada. In 1999,\nNunavut officially broke from the Northwest Territory to become its own territory. Nunavut has only about thirty\nthousand people in an area larger than any other province or territory in Canada. It comprises about one-fifth of\nCanada\u2019s land area. Most of the people who had claimed the land before the Europeans arrived are Inuit. Iqaluit,\nthe capital city of Nunavut, is on Baffin Island near Canada\u2019s east coast.\nCanada has a great deal of ethnic diversity. One measure of this is the number of languages spoken there. One\nsource estimates that there are about 145 languages spoken in Canada, including English and French. This reflects\nboth the rich native heritage and the history of immigration from around the world. As of 2006, the foreign-born\npopulation was 6.2 million, or nearly 20 percent of Canada\u2019s population. There are few countries that match this\nlevel of immigration. Even the United States had only about a 12.5 percent foreign-born population in 2006. If\nCanada\u2019s current immigration rates continue, by 2017 more than 22 percent of Canada\u2019s population will be foreign\nborn, which equals the high rate seen in the early twentieth century, during the golden age of Eastern European\nimmigration to North America. During this period, people from all the countries of Eastern Europe immigrated to\nall parts of Canada (Statistics Canada). 4.4 Canada 254\nFigure 4.25 Evidence of Eastern European Immigration\nThis Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church is located in the southern region of the Prairie Province of Manitoba.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe current surge of immigrants to Canada does not include many Europeans. Instead, these immigrants come\nfrom Asian countries, especially China and countries in South Asia such as India and Pakistan. If immigration\npatterns stay the same, by 2017 about one in five people in Canada will belong to a nonwhite minority group.\nAccording to the 2010 Canadian census, more than a million Chinese and more than a half million South Asians\nlived in Canada. Other groups increasing rapidly include people from the Middle East and Korea.\nThe Canadian Economy\nNot surprisingly, Canada and the Unites States are each others\u2019 largest trading partners. More than 80 percent\nof Canadian exports go to the United States and 70 percent of imports to Canada come from the United States. 255 World Regional Geography\nExcept for some natural-resource industries, most businesses are centered in Canadian cities to take advantage of\nthe available labor force. Canada is rapidly moving toward a knowledge-based economy built on innovation and\ntechnology. Knowledge-intensive industries, such as biotechnology and information technology, are on the rise,\nand these are typically located in cities to facilitate partnering with universities and other researchers.\nAlthough Canada is developing into a knowledge-based economy, the foundations of the Canadian economy\nhave always been its abundant natural resources. Canada\u2019s primary industries have traditionally been agriculture,\nfishing, mining, fuel\/energy, and logging\/forestry. Success in tapping these natural resources for their economic\nbenefit allowed the country to double in population since 1960 while the economy has increased sevenfold. The\nprimary industries now make up less than 10 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Just as in the United\nStates, the most dramatic structural change in the economy has been the rise of the service sector, which now\nemploys about three-quarters of all Canadians and generates over 60 percent of the GDP. Canadian manufacturing\nhas been a strong sector of the economy with close ties to United States and multinational corporations.\nFigure 4.26 Bombardier CRJ900LR Jet Liner Taking Off\nfrom Heathrow Airport in London 4.4 Canada 256\nThe CRJ jet aircraft series is manufactured in Canada.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nCanada\u2019s economy is tightly tied to that of the United States. One of the best examples is how the Canadian\neconomy fluctuates depending on whether the Canadian dollar was weak or strong compared with the US dollar.\nFor example, in 2002, one American dollar was worth about $1.60 in Canada. For many years, the American\ndollar was much stronger on the world market than the Canadian dollar; therefore, Canadian goods and labor were\nless expensive for Americans than comparable US labor and goods. During the time of the weak Canadian dollar,\nmany film and television industries moved to Canada to film television shows and movies, as it was less expensive\nto do so in Canada. Many popular television shows and movies have been shot in Canada, particularly in Toronto\nand Vancouver.\nMore recently, the value of the American dollar declined against other major currencies. The Canadian dollar\nremained strong, which meant that goods produced in Canada became much less affordable in the United States,\ncausing the television and film industries to move back south of the border and Canadian exports to the United\nStates to decline. In 2007, the Canadian dollar and the US dollar reached parity for the first time in thirty years.\nThe two currencies continue to fluctuate with market values.\nAs mentioned earlier, NAFTA, the 1994 trilateral agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, was\none of the most significant economic events in North American history. For Canada, the agreement has meant\nmore secure, stable access to US and Mexican markets. The agreement eliminated many tariffs; opened previously\nprotected sectors in agriculture, energy, textiles, and automotive trade; and set specific rules for trade in services 257 World Regional Geography\nsuch as finance, transportation, and telecommunications. Perhaps most importantly for Canada, the agreement set\nrules for settling trade disputes.\nThe United States continues to exert its powerful influence on many countries in the world, but perhaps on none so\nstrongly as Canada. Because of the geographical proximity of the two countries and the fact that the vast majority\nof Canadians live very close the US border, speak English as their first language, and share a great number of\ncultural similarities, American trends tend to be adopted by Canadians. Canadians differentiate themselves from\nAmericans in legal issues, laws, and health care. For example, Canada has a health care system, funded by the\nprovinces with financial help from the federal government, that provides free services to its citizens. Canadians\noften point to this difference as a one of the defining elements of their culture that is different from the United\nStates.\nCanada is a great consumer of American popular culture. Canadians listen to, watch, and read tremendous\nquantities of American music; television and movies; and news, books, and other literature\u2014so much so that\nsome Canadians believed Canadian culture was in danger of being extinguished. In response to these concerns, a\nlaw was passed and a watchdog agency created so that a certain percentage of all radio and television broadcasts\nemanating from Canadian radio and television stations had to originate in Canada or have significant Canadian\ncontent. Others were less worried about the impact of American pop culture on Canadian culture. This segment of\nthe Canadian population felt that Canadians have long identified themselves in contrast to Americans; therefore,\nconsuming American books, newspapers, television shows, and movies would only give Canadian a greater basis\nof comparison and thus strengthen the Canadian identity and perception of Canadian culture.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Canada is a very large country with rich natural resources but a relatively small population that mostly lives\nin a narrow band in the southern part of the country.\n\u2022 Canada\u2019s English and French bilingualism is part of its British and French colonial past. The French culture\nis dominant in Quebec, where the population has considered seceding from Canada and becoming an\nindependent country.\n\u2022 Canada\u2019s native population makes up less than 4 percent of the country\u2019s population but represents a great\ndeal of cultural and linguistic diversity.\n\u2022 More than one in five Canadians is an immigrant, and most of the recent immigrants come from non-\nWestern countries, especially those in Asia.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Explain how physical geography has contributed to economic activities.\nFigure 4.27 Main Regions of the United States and Canada\n260 261 World Regional Geography\nThe Northeastern Core\nThe Northeastern Core includes the upper Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan); the mid-Atlantic\nstates of Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and New Jersey plus northern Virginia; and the southern New\nEngland states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. It also includes southern Ontario, Canada\u2019s\ncapital (Ottawa), and its largest city (Toronto). The physical environments of the Northeastern Core are quite\ndiverse, including the northern Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain, the northern Appalachians, and the area surrounding\nthe Great Lakes. This region, anchored by North America\u2019s largest metropolis, New York, is the economic heart of 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 262\nthe United States and Canada and home to more than a third of each country\u2019s population. The megalopolis\u2014the\nbuilt-up area from Washington, DC, to Boston\u2014is part of this region. The core region contains the Manufacturing\/\nRust Belt, which was once the main manufacturing region for North America but suffered decline with the advent\nof the information age. The core region hosts the headquarters of countless corporations, banks, financial markets\n(e.g., Wall Street), universities (from community colleges to the Ivy League), cultural institutions (e.g., Broadway,\nworld-class museums, dance and music organizations), and even global organizations such as the United Nations.\nFigure 4.28 Megalopolis 263 World Regional Geography\nFigure 4.29 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 264\nDowntown Philadelphia\u2019s city hall is an example of the urban qualities of the megalopolis that extends from Boston to Washington,\nDC.\nHenk Sijgers \u2013 A direct line to city hall \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThis large region includes geographic swaths of both wealth and economic suffering. Eight of the United States\u2019\nten wealthiest counties are in this region, most of them in the Washington, DC, area, and a number of billionaires\nlive in New York City. Meanwhile, cities such as Detroit and Cleveland have suffered from deindustrialization\nand have experienced a major population decline since the 1950s. Detroit, for instance, has lost 61 percent of its\npopulation since 1950, and the decline continues. The city decreased in population by 25 percent just between\n2000 and 2010. While manufacturing is not dead in the Northeastern Core, heavy industry has been in long-term\ndecline. 265 World Regional Geography\nNew England and the Canadian Maritimes\nNew England and the Canadian Maritimes overlap with the Northeastern Core because its major city\u2014Boston\u2014is\nconsidered the northern edge of the megalopolis. South of Boston, the low-lying states of New England were the\ncenter of colonial settlement in the region and were the birthplace of America\u2019s Industrial Revolution. Southern\nNew England began as an agricultural and fishing colony, and as industry developed in the nineteenth century,\nthe region attracted European immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and elsewhere to work in its factories. The highly\nskilled workforce helped maintain a strong economy in southern New England, although there have been times of\nincreased unemployment and economic hardship. Today the region has a more diverse economic base, including\nrecreation and tourism, finance, telecommunications, and health care. The mountains of western New England\nhave been particularly attractive for the development of ski resorts, and the coasts of New England are popular for\nsummer vacationing.\nAs you move north from Boston, the terrain becomes more rugged and the soil less fertile. There are fewer\neconomic reasons for people to live in northern New England, and the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and\nMaine have always been less densely populated than the southern New England states. Maine is the least densely\npopulated state in this region; about 90 percent of its land is forested, making it the most forested of the fifty\nUnited States. The vast Empty Quarter in western Maine consists of five million acres of privately owned forest\nand no permanent human inhabitants. Maine\u2019s leading economic activity is manufacturing, and the bulk of it is\noriented around paper and other wood products.\nNorthern New England transitions to the even more rugged and remote uplands of the Canadian Maritimes:\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The soil quality is quite\npoor, as glaciers removed most of it during the various ice ages. The region has a harsh climate and is removed\nfrom the major population centers of Canada and the eastern United States. The Maritime Provinces have always\nbeen oriented to the sea. Fishing and other sea-oriented businesses have historically been strong here, but in\nrecent decades overfishing of the North Atlantic has caused a decline in the fishing economy. Tourism has been\nincreasing as a source of revenue, especially in places such as Prince Edward Island, in which tourism is the\ndominant economic activity. Newfoundland, including Labrador, is Canada\u2019s poorest province. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 266\nFrench Canada\nWest of the Canadian Maritimes lies the province of Quebec, the heart of which is the St. Lawrence River valley,\na lowland separating the Appalachian Mountains to the south from the inhospitable Canadian Shield to the north.\nAs explained in Section 4.4.3 \u201cBritish versus French Canada\u201d, France was the first European country to colonize\nthe coastal regions of what is now Canada, the St. Lawrence River Valley, most of the land surrounding the Great\nLakes, and the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, south to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Great Britain obtained\nall that land from France in 1763 following the French and Indian War, enough French inhabitants occupied part\nof that territory that the region did not automatically become English speaking. The core of French Canada today\nis the St. Lawrence Valley from Montreal to the Atlantic coast and west of Montreal to Ottawa and north to\nthe Hudson Bay. These French speakers, the descendants of the early French settlers, created a vibrant French-\nCanadian culture. About 21 percent of Canadians speak French as their mother tongue, including about 80 percent\nof Canadians living in the province of Quebec.\nThroughout most of its history, the people of Quebec have been rural farmers, eking out a living on less-than-ideal\nland in a place with a short growing season. One unique characteristic of the farms in French Canada is their size\nand shape. Early on, the farms were laid out as long lots, maximizing the number of farms that would have access\nto the transportation artery\u2014usually a river, but sometimes a road. Each farm was about ten times longer than it\nwas wide and had a small access point to the river, some fertile riverfront land, and a woodlot at the rear of the\nfarm. This land-use pattern was common throughout French Canada and can even be seen today in the United\nStates in former French colonies such as Tennessee and Louisiana.\nFigure 4.30 Long Lot Farms Typical in French Canada 267 World Regional Geography\nSource: Image courtesy of E. Ratajeski.\nSince then, Quebec\u2019s economy has developed to include a manufacturing sector (fueled by abundant\nhydroelectricity), tourism, and a variety of tertiary and quaternary industries. Montreal, Canada\u2019s second-largest\nmetropolitan area with 3.9 million residents, is the largest French-speaking city in the Western hemisphere. It\ndeveloped as the region\u2019s most important city in the mid-nineteenth century, as it controlled access through the\nSt. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. It became a diverse industrial center, with oil refineries, steel mills,\nflour and sugar refineries, and shop yards for railroad companies. Montreal attracted English speakers as well as\nthe local Francophones, and at times in its history it has even had more English speakers than French speakers,\ndespite being surrounded by a Francophone countryside. Most of northern Quebec is sparsely populated because\nof the lack of quality soil for agriculture, but a paper and pulp industry based on its forests has developed over the\ntwentieth century, as well as hydroelectric power generation. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 268\nThe American South\nThe South includes the entire southeastern portion of the United States from Kentucky south to Louisiana, east\nto Florida, and north to Virginia. The South consists of most of the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain and the southern\nportion of the Appalachian Highlands.\nBefore the Civil War, the coastal plain was dedicated to plantation agriculture using African slave labor. Land not\nused for plantation crops such as tobacco, cotton, and rice was typically farmed by poor whites and later by poor\nblacks. Some were sharecroppers, while others farmed their own small plots, especially on the lesser-quality land\nin Appalachia. The South had little urbanization or industrialization at the time of the Civil War. Well into the\ntwentieth century, the region remained rural and economically deprived.\nFigure 4.31\nNames often reflect the cultural region of their location. Business names with \u201cDixie\u201d in them can be found throughout the South.\nThe Dixie Grill restaurant is located in Morehead, Kentucky. 269 World Regional Geography\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nCoal mining was a major source of employment in places such as West Virginia and eastern Kentucky for the\nfirst two-thirds of the twentieth century, but increased mechanization of mining methods, as well as new mining\ntechniques such as mountaintop removal mining, decreased the number of miners needed, even as coal production\nincreased.\nThe Appalachian South is perennially plagued by high unemployment, poverty, and difficult social conditions.\nOther areas of the rural South are also among the poorest in the nation, including the Mississippi Delta and the\nlower Mississippi River valley. Despite the continued swaths of poverty in the South, parts of the region have\nprospered in the past generation as Sun Belt migrants have moved to southern places such as Atlanta, Charlotte,\nTampa, Miami, and dozens of smaller cities. This has fueled a period of urbanization and economic growth, and\nthe newfound prosperity has helped integrate the South into the nation\u2019s economy.\nThe Midwest and Great Plains\nThe center of the continent contains a relatively level agricultural region: the Midwest and the Great Plains.\nThis land includes some of the most fertile agricultural land in the entire world and has been dubbed America\u2019s\nbreadbasket. The climate gets progressively more arid as you move to the west within this region, and the type of\nagriculture changes with the decrease in precipitation. Closer to the Rocky Mountains, the land is typically used\nfor raising cattle, but enormous grain farms are found where water is available (especially through irrigation). The\nwater for irrigation comes from the continent\u2019s largest aquifer, the Ogallala Aquifer. Water is often pumped to\nthe surface using a system called center pivot irrigation. The heart of the spring wheat belt is North Dakota, and\nthe crop is also common in eastern Montana and in Canada\u2019s Prairie Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and\nManitoba. Winter wheat is common in Kansas and surrounding states. Farther to the east, where precipitation is\nmore abundant, is the Corn Belt, focused in Iowa and Illinois. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 270\nFigure 4.32 Acres of Corn Harvested for Grain as a Percentage of Harvested Cropland Acreage, 2007\nThis map shows the extent of the Corn Belt.\nMap courtesy of US Department of Agriculture.\nFigure 4.33 Satellite Image of Corn, Sorghum, and Wheat Fields in Southwestern Kansas 271 World Regional Geography\nThe circular fields are between a half-mile and mile in diameter, and are characteristic of fields that use center-pivot irrigation.\nPhoto courtesy of NASA\/GSFC\/METI\/ERSDAC\/JAROS and U.S.\/Japan ASTER Science Team\nThe dominant city in this region is Chicago, which developed as a market town for the livestock and grain\nproduced in the surrounding states and was linked to its hinterland through a complex network of rail lines. In fact,\nnearly all the major cities of this region developed as places for the buying, selling, and processing agricultural\nproducts. Today the Midwest and the Great Plains remain the most important food-producing areas in North\nAmerica, although as agriculture has become increasingly mechanized and farms have gotten larger, the number of\nfarmers has decreased. This region, especially the Great Plains, is experiencing a period of long-term population\ndecline and aging. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 272\nThe American Southwest\nThe states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona are considered the Southwest. The climate of the Southwest is\nmore arid and receives a high amount of sunlight throughout the year. Desert conditions are integrated with higher\nelevations in the mountainous areas. Eastern Texas receives more rainfall from the Gulf of Mexico, and western\nTexas and the states of New Mexico and Arizona are quite arid and receive less rainfall. These conditions are\nmore favorable to cattle ranching than to other agricultural activities. Large farming operations exist where water\nis available for irrigation. The warmer climate has been attractive for development and people emigrating from\nthe colder regions of the north.\nFigure 4.34 Typical Home in a Phoenix Suburb, Where Water Is a Valued Commodity\nThere is no grass to mow, and cactus and palm trees are common.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe Southwest has a strong Hispanic heritage and was part of Spain\u2019s Mexican colony before England established\ncolonies on the East Coast (the first Spanish settlers arrived in New Mexico in 1598). All three states have a\nlarge contingency of Hispanic residents, some of whom have descended from early pre\u2013United States settlers, 273 World Regional Geography\nwhile others have come into the United States more recently across the long desert border between Mexico and\nthe United States. According to the 2010 census, about 46 percent of New Mexico\u2019s population was Hispanic or\nLatino, and in Texas and Arizona the figures were 37 percent and 30 percent, respectively (US Census Bureau).\nIn Arizona, strong centrifugal forces have been in play because of its tough legal measures against illegal\nimmigration. This issue exposes the social rift between the more European population of the state and the Hispanic\nimmigrants. In 2008, the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics estimated\nthat Arizona had one of the fastest-growing illegal immigrant populations in the country at 8.4 percent of the\npopulation (Hoefer, M., et. al., 2011). This was the second-highest percentage of undocumented residents in the\ncountry, after Nevada. In April 2010, the New York Times reported that Arizona\u2019s governor signed the nation\u2019s\ntoughest bill on illegal immigration into law, designed to identify, prosecute, and deport illegal immigrants\n(Archibold, R. C., 2011). At the same time, Reuters reported that the when the bill was debated in the Arizona\nsenate, the number of illegal immigrants was listed at 10 percent of the population (Reuters, 2011). Some\nopponents of the tough illegal immigration laws claimed that law enforcement officials would use racial profiling\nto target Hispanic residents, and the federal government took the state to court to halt its enforcement.\nThe Southwest also has a strong Native American presence, especially in New Mexico and Arizona. Twenty-\none federally recognized tribes with more than 250,000 people (4.9 percent of the state\u2019s population) live in\nArizona, and their reservations and traditional communities make up more than one-fourth of the state\u2019s land. The\nNavajo tribe is the largest in the United States, with more than 100,000 members in Arizona alone and others in\nsurrounding states. The considerable Native American and Hispanic population in the Southwest means that non-\nHispanic whites make up a minority of the population in New Mexico and Texas.\nFigure 4.35 Navajo Dancer Performing the Eagle Dance 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 274\nOne of the Pollen Trail Dancers, a Navajo group near Joseph City, Arizona, performs the Eagle Dance on September 21, 2010, on\nthe scenic South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park between Hopi House and Verkamp\u2019s Visitor Center.\nGrand Canyon National Park \u2013 Grand Canyon Eagle Dancer \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe three Southwestern states have been recipients of Sun Belt migrations over the past few decades, as people\nhave moved to the Southwest for tertiary-sector jobs and for the region\u2019s warm climate. The region is quite\nurbanized, and most of the new migrants are moving to cities. Three-fourths of Arizona\u2019s population live in\nthe Phoenix or Tucson metropolitan area. The most populous metropolitan area in the Southwest is Dallas\u2013Fort\nWorth, Texas, with 6.4 million residents in 2010, making it the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the United\nStates. The Houston metropolitan area is not far behind with 6.1 million residents. The economy of Texas used to\nbe based on oil and natural gas, but it has since become more diversified. Residents of these cities work in high-\ntech manufacturing, health care, business, and information. One of the most famous high-tech industries in Texas\nis space: Houston is home to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson\nSpace Center, where astronauts and thousands of others work in the space industry. 275 World Regional Geography\nThe Mountain West\nFrom the Rocky Mountains to the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades and the Intermontane Basins and Plateaus in\nbetween, this part of North America has gone from the old Wild West to an area of rapid economic and population\ngrowth. The region encompasses western Colorado; western Wyoming; western Montana; Idaho; Nevada; Utah;\nthe eastern portions of Washington, Oregon, and California; and the southern portion of the Canadian Rockies.\nFigure 4.36 Rocky Mountains of Western Montana on US Highway 2\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe population of the Mountain West is growing much faster than the population of the United States as a whole.\nFor example, Nevada\u2019s population grew 32.3 percent from 2000 to 2009, which is more than three times as much\nas the United States as a whole (9.1 percent). All US states in this region, except for Montana, grew at faster\nrates than the US average. Utah grew 24.7 percent, Idaho grew 19.5 percent, and Colorado grew 16.8 percent.\nWhat is fueling this growth? It is part of the larger pattern of Americans flocking to the Sun Belt, searching for\nan attractive climate and lifestyle. Jobs have been created in recreation (gambling, skiing), in high-tech firms, and\nin other tertiary sector industries. Many of the migrants come from southern California because the housing in\nthe Mountain West is more affordable and the region is much less crowded. Nearly all the growth is occurring in\nurban and suburban areas. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 276\nHowever, the rapid growth of the West since 1990 has come at a cost. In some areas the large population is putting\na strain on physical resources, such as water. Water is a hot-button political issue, particularly in the more arid\nstates such as Nevada. Las Vegas, for example, is a desert city that gets 90 percent of its water from a Colorado\nRiver reservoir: Lake Mead. This water comes from snowmelt in the Rocky Mountains far to the east, and due to\ndrought and high water demand, Lake Mead\u2019s water level has been dropping. If current patterns persist, Las Vegas\nwill have a water crisis soon. The water shortage is happening even though Las Vegas has managed to reduce per\ncapita water usage by raising prices for water and creating incentives to remove grass lawns. Las Vegas recycles\n94 percent of all sewage water, which is the highest rate in the United States.\nAs the West\u2019s population increased rapidly, the region\u2019s urban areas became part of the real estate bubble of the\nearly 2000s. Real estate prices grew and the housing industry built one residential subdivision after another in the\nsuburbs surrounding cities such as Las Vegas, Denver, and Salt Lake City. However, in the late 2000s the real\nestate market collapsed in many parts of the country, and Western cities were hard hit. As of early 2011, three\nof the five states with the highest foreclosure rates were in this region (Nevada, Utah, and Idaho), and the others\nwere bordering states (Arizona and California).\nFigure 4.37 Urban Growth in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1984 to 2009 277 World Regional Geography\nNotice the dark purple of city streets and the bright green of irrigated vegetation.\nImages courtesy of NASA\nThe Pacific Coast\nThe Pacific Coast includes the coastal portions of California, Oregon, and Washington, plus the southwestern\nportion of British Columbia in Canada. This region is typically thought of as two subregions: California and the\nPacific Northwest. The two areas are quite different from each other in terms of climate and economy. However,\nboth areas are part of the so-called Ring of Fire that encircles the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is a zone\nof earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that occur near where the Pacific tectonic plate meets the surrounding\nplates. In the United States, two areas of concern are the San Andreas Fault in California and Mount St. Helens\nin Washington. The 1906 earthquake that destroyed San Francisco was a result of activity on the San Andreas\nFault, and scientists predict that strong earthquakes will reappear along the fault in the future. Thousands of small 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 278\nearthquakes occur along the fault every year. Mount St. Helen\u2019s is a volcano in the Cascades that erupted in 1980,\nkilling fifty-seven people and destroying hundreds of square miles of forest.\nFigure 4.38 The San Andreas Fault 279 World Regional Geography\nThe Pacific tectonic plate is moving northward relative to the North American plate.\nImage courtesy of USGS\nThe Pacific Coast represents a large population center a continent away from what we consider the North\nAmerican core. Most of the region\u2019s population is urban, and Los Angeles and its metropolitan area is by far the\nlargest area of settlement. Twelve percent of the US population lives in California (thirty-seven million people),\nand the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area has nearly eighteen million people. Los Angeles is the second-\nlargest US city after New York. Los Angeles is the quintessential automobile city. It developed into a major city\nin the mid-twentieth century at the time that automobile ownership had become common, and people who lived 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 280\nin the area tended to move to suburbs that were connected to each other by an extensive highway system. Los\nAngeles is a highly decentralized city, unlike cities in other parts of North America that formed during other\ntransportation regimes.\nThe Pacific Coast region is also famous for its agriculture. California\u2019s Central Valley lies between the Coast\nRanges to the west and the Sierra Nevada to the east and is among the most productive agricultural areas in the\nworld. The irrigated farmland in the valley produces all types of nontropical crops and is the largest US producer\nof tomatoes, grapes, almonds, and other foods. When other parts of the country are still frozen in the winter\nmonths, the fields of the Central Valley are already producing bountiful harvests. California is also famous for its\nwine production, especially in Napa Valley near San Francisco.\nFigure 4.39 The Pacific Ocean from Venice Beach in Los Angeles\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nBesides agriculture, the economic base of the Pacific Coast is quite diverse and rich. If it were an independent\ncountry, California would be the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy. Los Angeles is considered the capital of the\nUS entertainment industry, and other major industries include aerospace, manufacturing, and foreign trade. The\nport of Los Angeles is the busiest in North America, receiving shipments of goods from China and other Asian\ncountries. Silicon Valley, near San Francisco, is a key area for high-tech research and Internet commerce. The\nPacific Northwest is home to major corporations such as Boeing (whose headquarters recently moved to Chicago), 281 World Regional Geography\nMicrosoft, and other famous companies such as Starbucks, Amazon.com, REI, T-Mobile, Costco, and Eddie\nBauer. One of the richest Americans, Bill Gates, lives near Seattle.\nAcross the border to the north, Vancouver is Canada\u2019s third-largest metropolitan area with over two million\nresidents. Vancouver is unlike any other city in North America. Nearly one-third of its residents are of Chinese\norigin, and more than half its population speak a language other than English at home. Vancouver began as a\nlogging town but developed into its position as the Asian gateway to Canada because of its port, the busiest in\nCanada. Vancouver is a popular location for the film industry and is sometimes dubbed as \u201cHollywood North.\u201d It\nis also growing in the biotechnology and software industries.\nThe North\nThe North is the least densely populated of any region in North America due to its brutally cold winters, short\ngrowing season, and poor soils. It includes the boreal forests of the upper Great Lakes region and the Canadian\nShield and the territory to the north of the tree line that extends beyond the Arctic Circle. Physically, this\nregion is immense, including the state of Alaska plus most of Canada. The climate is similar to that of Russia:\ncold continental and arctic climates, arctic air masses swooping down from the north, and long winters. Most\ninhabitants of the northern portions of North America live in the forested areas rather than in the frozen Arctic.\nTwo groups of people live in this region. First are the native peoples who have always lived there. They are small\nin number and traditionally make a living by hunting and fishing. More recently, the native populations such as\nthe Inuit and the First Nations in Canada subsist by combining wage employment with their traditional means of\nliving off the land. American Indians or Alaskan natives make up about 15 percent of Alaska\u2019s population, for a\ntotal of roughly 106,000 people. In Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, First Nations people make up just over half\nthe population, but the total population is quite small\u2014only about 41,000 in the entire territory. In Nunavut, the\nnative population is about 85 percent of the total 30,000 residents, living in a territory the size of Western Europe. 4.5 Regions of the United States and Canada 282\nFigure 4.40 Radar Station at Point Lay, Alaska\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe other residents are more recent immigrants who are there to exploit the land\u2019s natural resources. The economy\nis dominated by the primary economic sector: forestry, oil and natural gas extraction, and mining. In the Canadian\nShield, metallic ores such as copper, gold, nickel, silver, and uranium are found in the rocks and diamond mines\nare in operation, as are mines producing rare earth elements used in computer screens, electric car batteries,\nand computer hard drives. These elements include metals such as cerium, terbium, dysprosium, and neodymium.\nAlaska is an oil-producing state, and the decision of whether to open additional areas of Alaska\u2019s Arctic to oil\ndrilling remains controversial and uncertain.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The economic core of North America has traditionally been in the US Northeast and its surrounding\nterritory.\n\u2022 As you move north from Boston into the rest of New England, the Canadian Maritimes, and Quebec, the\neconomy is increasingly based on primary industries such as forestry and fishing.\n\u2022 Agriculture and mining have been in decline in the South, while tertiary and quaternary industries have\nattracted new migrants to the region\u2019s urban and suburban areas.\n\u2022 The Midwest and the Great Plains make up North America\u2019s breadbasket. The climate gets more arid as you\nmove west, but through irrigation, agricultural productivity remains high.\n\u2022 The Southwest is unique in its high proportion of Hispanic and Native American residents.\n\u2022 The Mountain West is growing rapidly, especially in its urban and suburban areas. This is putting stress on\nthe physical environment (particularly its water resources) and made the region susceptible to the real estate\nbubble collapse.\n\u2022 The Pacific Coast region is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity, yet it is home to the second-largest 283 World Regional Geography\nmetropolitan area in the United States and is known for its rich, diverse economic base.\n\u2022 The far northern stretches of North America are sparsely populated, with an economy based on primary\nindustries such as forestry and extraction. The North, both Canada and Alaska, is also known for its large\nnative populations.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. Where is the largest US megalopolis located? What region is it part of?\n2.

For Canada, the\nlargest group of immigrants is from Asia.\n\u2022 The United States and Canada are both countries with a small native population, although in Canada native\npeople have achieved more self-representation than in the United States, especially since the creation of\nNunavut.\n\u2022 Quebec, the French-speaking heart of Canada, has struggled for years to maintain its cultural uniqueness\nwithout risking its economic well-being.\n\u2022 Both countries are postindustrial, with service- and information-oriented economies. The United States is\nthe world\u2019s largest economy, and it has a history of spreading its culture, ideas, and military prowess around\nthe globe.\n\u2022 North America is made up of various regions with distinct cultural or physical features. Each region has\nmajority and minority populations based on immigration or native heritage. Economic conditions vary from\nregion to region. The Sun Belt is attracting an ever-growing number of information-based high-tech firms.\n285 Chapter 5: Middle America\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nMiddle America, the geographic realm between the United States and the continent of South America, consists\nof three main regions: the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Central American republics. The Caribbean region, the\nmost culturally diverse of the three, consists of more than seven thousand islands that stretch from the Bahamas to\nBarbados. The four largest islands of the Caribbean make up the Greater Antilles, which include Cuba, Jamaica,\nHispaniola, and Puerto Rico. Hispaniola is split between Haiti in the west and the Dominican Republic in the\neast. The smaller islands, extending all the way to South America, make up the Lesser Antilles. The island that is\nfarthest south is Trinidad, just off the coast of Venezuela. The Bahamas, the closest islands to the US mainland, are\nlocated in the Atlantic Ocean but are associated with the Caribbean region. The Caribbean region is surrounded\nby bodies of salt water: the Caribbean Sea in the center, the Gulf of Mexico to the west, and the North Atlantic\nto the east.\nCentral America refers to the seven states south of Mexico: Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,\nCosta Rica, and Panama. Panama borders the South American country of Colombia. During the colonial era,\nPanama was included in the part of South America controlled by the Spanish. The Pacific Ocean borders Central\nAmerica to the west, and the Caribbean Sea borders these countries to the east. While most of the republics have\nboth a Caribbean and a Pacific coastline, Belize has only a Caribbean coast, and El Salvador has only a Pacific\ncoast.\n286 287 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.1 Middle America: Caribbean, Mexico, and Central\nAmerica\nCentral America includes the countries south of Mexico through Panama.\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries\nMexico, the largest country in Middle America, is often studied separately from the Caribbean or Central America.\nMexico has an extensive land border with the United States, its neighbor to the north. The Baja Peninsula, the\nfirst of Mexico\u2019s two noted peninsulas, borders California and the Pacific Ocean and extends southward from\nCalifornia for 775 miles. The Baja region is mainly a sparsely populated desert area. The Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula\nborders Guatemala and Belize and extends north into the Gulf of Mexico. The Yucat\u00e1n was a part of the ancient\nMayan civilization and is still home to many Maya people.\nMiddle America is not a unified realm but is characterized by a high level of political and cultural diversity.

(people Chapter 5: Middle America 288\nnative to the Americas), African, European, and Asian ethnic backgrounds\u2014make up the cultural framework.\nThis realm is often associated with the term \u201cLatin America\u201d because of the dominance of colonialism from\nEuropean countries like Spain, France, and Portugal speaking a Latin-based language. The truth is that Latin is not\nan active language, and Middle America has created its own cultural identity in spite of the impact of colonialism,\nand the realm can be defined by its people and their activities as much as by its physical environment. 5.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Define the differences between the rimland and the mainland.\n2. Summarize the impact of European colonialism on Middle America.\n3. Distinguish between the Mayan and Aztec Empires and identify which the Spanish defeated.\n4. Describe how the Spanish influenced urban development.\nPhysical Geography\nMiddle America has various types of physical landscapes, including volcanic islands and mountain ranges.\nTectonic action at the edge of the Caribbean Plate has brought about volcanic activity, creating many of the islands\nof the region as volcanoes rose above the ocean surface. The island of Montserrat is one such example. The\nvolcano on this island has continued to erupt in recent years, showering the island with dust and ash and making\nhabitation difficult. Many of the other low-lying islands, such as the Bahamas, were formed by coral reefs rising\nabove the ocean surface. Tectonic plate activity not only has created volcanic islands but also is a constant source\nof earthquakes that continue to be a problem for the Caribbean community.\nThe republics of Central America extend from Mexico to Colombia and form the final connection between North\nAmerica and South America. The Isthmus of Panama, the narrowest point between the Caribbean Sea and the\nPacific Ocean, serves as a land bridge between the continents. The backbone of Central America is mountainous,\nwith many volcanoes located within its ranges. Much of the Caribbean and all of Central America are located\nsouth of the Tropic of Cancer and are dominated by tropical type A climates. The mountainous areas have varied\nclimates, with cooler climates located at higher elevations. Mexico has extensive mountainous areas with two\nmain ranges in the north and highlands in the south. There are no landlocked countries in this realm, and coastal\nareas have been exploited for fishing and tourism development.\n289 5.1 Introducing the Realm 290\nRimland and Mainland\nUsing a regional approach to the geography of a realm helps us compare and contrast a place\u2019s features and\ncharacteristics. Location and the physical differences explain the division of Middle America into two geographic\nareas according to occupational activities and colonial dynamics: the rimland, which includes the Caribbean\nislands and the Caribbean coastal areas of Central America, and the mainland, which includes the interior of\nMexico and Central America.\nColonialism thrived in the rimland because it consists mainly of islands and coastal areas that were accessible to\nEuropean ships. Ships could easily sail into a cove or bay to make port and claim the island for their home country.\nAfter an island or coastal area was claimed, there was unimpeded transformation of the area through plantation\nagriculture. On a plantation, local individuals were subjugated as servants or slaves. The land was planted with a\nsingle crop\u2014usually sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, or fruit\u2014grown for export profits. Most of these crops were not\nnative to the Americas but were brought in during colonial times. European diseases killed vast numbers of local\nAmerindian laborers, so slaves were brought from Africa to do the work. Plantation agriculture in the rimland was\nsuccessful because of the import of technology, slave labor, and raw materials, as well as the export of the harvest\nto Europe for profit.\nPlantation agriculture changed the rimland. The local groups were diminished because of disease and colonial\nsubjugation, and by the 1800s most of the population was of African descent. Native food crops for consumption\ngave way to cash crops for export. Marginal lands were plowed up and placed into the plantation system. The\nlabor was usually seasonal: there was a high demand for labor at peak planting and harvest times. Plantations were\ngenerally owned by wealthy Europeans who may or may not have actually lived there.\nThe mainland, consisting of Mexico and the interior of Central America, diverged from the rimland in terms\nof both colonial dynamics and agricultural production. The interior lacked the easy access to the sea that the\nrimland enjoyed. As a result, the hacienda style of land use developed. This Spanish innovation was aimed at\nland acquisition for social prestige and a comfortable lifestyle. Export profits were not the driving force behind the\noperation, though they may have existed. The indigenous workers, who were poorly paid if at all, were allowed to\nlive on the haciendas, working their own plots for subsistence. African slaves were not prominent in the mainland.\nIn the mainland, European colonialists would enter an area and stake claims to large portions of the land, often\nas much as thousands or even in the millions of acres. Haciendas would eventually become the main landholding\nstructure in the mainland of Mexico and many other regions of Middle America. In the hacienda system, the\nAmerindian people lost ownership of the land to the European colonial masters. Land ownership or the control of\nland has been a common point of conflict throughout the Americas where land transferred from a local indigenous\nownership to a colonial European ownership. 291 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.2 Mainland and Rimland Characteristics of Middle America Based on Colonial-Era Economic Activities\nThe rimland was more accessible to European ships, and the mainland was more isolated from European activity.\nThe plantation and hacienda eras are in the past. The abolition of slavery in the later 1800s and the cultural\nrevolutions that occurred on the mainland challenged the plantation and hacienda systems and brought about land\nreform. Plantations were transformed into either multiple private plots or large corporate farms. The hacienda\nsystem was broken up, and most of the hacienda land was given back to the people, often in the form of an ejidos\nsystem, in which the community owns the land but individuals can profit from it by sharing its resources. The\nejidos system has created its own set of problems, and many of the communally owned lands are being transferred\nto private owners.\nThe agricultural systems changed Middle America by altering both the systems of land use and the ethnicity of\nthe population. The Caribbean Basin changed in ethnicity from being entirely Amerindian, to being dominated\nby European colonizers, to having an African majority population. The mainland experienced the mixing of\nEuropean culture with the Amerindian culture to form various types of mestizo groups with Hispanic, Latino, or\nChicano identities. 5.1 Introducing the Realm 292\nThe European Invasion\nThough the southern region of the Americas has commonly been referred to as \u201cLatin America,\u201d this is a\nmisnomer because Latin has never been the lingua franca of any of the countries in the Americas. What, then, is\nthe connection between the southern region of the Americas and Latin? To understand this connection, the reader\nneeds to bring to mind the dominant languages as well as the origin of the colonizers of the region called \u201cLatin\nAmerica.\u201d Keep in mind that the name of a given country does not always reflect its lingua franca. For example,\npeople in Mexico do not speak a language called \u201cMexican\u201d; they speak Spanish. Likewise, Brazilians do not\nspeak \u201cBrazilian\u201d; they speak Portuguese.\nEuropean colonialism had an immense effect on the rest of the world. Among other things, colonialism diffused\nthe European languages and the Christian religion. Latin Mass has been a tradition in the Roman Catholic Church.\nConsider the Latin-based Romance language group and how European colonialism altered language and religion\nin the Americas. The Romance languages of Spanish and Portuguese are now the most widely used languages\nin Middle and South America, respectively. This is precisely why the term Latin America is not technically an\nappropriate name for this region, even though the name is widely used. Middle America is a more accurate term\nfor the region between the United States and South America, and South America is the appropriate name for the\nsouthern continent in spite of the connection to Latin-based languages.\nEuropean colonialism impacted Middle America in more ways than language and religion. Before Christopher\nColumbus arrived from Europe, the Americas did not have animals such as horses, donkeys, sheep, chickens, and\ndomesticated cattle. This meant there were no large draft animals for plowing fields or carrying heavy burdens.\nThe concept of the wheel, which was so prominent in Europe, was not found in use in the Americas. Food\ncrops were also different: the potato was an American food crop, as were corn, squash, beans, chili peppers, and\ntobacco. Europeans brought other food crops\u2014either from Europe itself or from its colonies\u2014such as coffee,\nwheat, barley, rice, citrus fruits, and sugarcane. Besides food crops, building methods, agricultural practices, and\neven diseases were exchanged.\nThe Spanish invasion of Middle America following Columbus had devastating consequences for the indigenous\npopulations. It has been estimated that fifteen to twenty million people lived in Middle America when the\nEuropeans arrived, but after a century of European colonialism, only about 2.5 million remained. Few of the\nindigenous peoples\u2014such as the Arawak and the Carib on the islands of the Caribbean and the Maya and Aztec on\nthe mainland\u2014had immunities to European diseases such as measles, mumps, smallpox, and influenza. Through\nwarfare, disease, and enslavement, the local populations were decimated. Only a small number of people still\nclaim Amerindian heritage in the Caribbean Basin, and some argue that these few are not indigenous to the\nCaribbean but are descendants of slaves brought from South America by European colonialists.\nColumbus landed with his three ships on the island of Hispaniola in 1492. Hispaniola is now divided into the\ncountries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. With the advantage of metal armor, weapons, and other advanced\ntechnology, the Spanish invaders quickly dominated the local people. Since Europe was going through a period\nof competition, warfare, and technological advancements, the same mind-set carried forward to the New World.\nIndigenous people were most often made servants of the Europeans, and resistance resulted in conflict, war, and\noften death. The Spanish soldiers, explorers, or adventurers called conquistadors were looking for profits and\nquick gain and ardently sought gold, silver, and precious gems. This quest for gain pitted the European invaders 293 World Regional Geography\nagainst the local groups. The Roman Catholic religion was brought over from Europe and at times was zealously\npushed on the local \u201cheathens\u201d with a \u201crepent or perish\u201d method of conversion.\nMany of the Caribbean islands have declared independence, but some remain crown colonies of their European\ncolonizers with varying degrees of autonomy. Mexico achieved independence from Spain by 1821, and most\nCentral American republics also gained independence in the 1820s. In 1823, the United States implemented the\nMonroe Doctrine, designed to deter the former European colonial powers from engaging in continued political\nactivity in the Americas. US intervention has continued in various places in spite of the reduction in European\nactivity in the region. In 1898, the United States engaged Spain in the Spanish-American War, in which Spain\nlost its colonies of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and others to the United States. Puerto Rico continues to be under US\njurisdiction and is not an independent country.\nThe Maya and the Aztec\nThough the region of Mexico has been inhabited for thousands of years, one of the earliest cultures to develop into\na civilization with large cities was the Olmec, which was believed to be the precursor to the later Mayan Empire.\nThe Olmec flourished in the south-central regions of Mexico from 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE. Anthropologists\ncall this region of Mexico and northern Central America Mesoamerica. It is considered to be the region\u2019s cultural\nhearth because it was home to early human civilizations. The Maya established a vast civilization after the Olmec,\nand Mayan stone structures remain as major tourist attractions. The classical era of the Mayan civilization lasted\nfrom 300 to 900 CE and was centered in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula region of Mexico, Belize, and Central America.\nGuatemala was once a large part of this vast empire, and Mayan ruins are found as far south as Honduras.\nDuring the classical era, the Maya built some of the most magnificent cities and stone pyramids in the Western\nHemisphere. The city-states of the empire functioned through a sophisticated religious hierarchy. The Mayan\ncivilization made advancements in mathematics, astronomy, engineering, and architecture. They developed an\naccurate calendar based on the seasons and the solar system. The extent of their immense knowledge is still being\ndiscovered. The descendants of the Maya people still exist today, but their empire does not. 5.1 Introducing the Realm 294\nFigure 5.3 Mayan Site of Uxmal in the Yucat\u00e1n Region of Mexico\nThe classical Mayan era lasted from 300 to 900 CE. Many magnificent cities were built with stone and remain today as major tourist\nattractions.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe Toltec, who controlled central Mexico briefly, came to power after the classical Mayan era. They also took\ncontrol of portions of the old Mayan Empire from the north. The Aztec federation replaced the Toltec and Maya\nas the dominant civilization in southern Mexico. The Aztec, who expanded outward from their base in central\nMexico, built the largest and greatest city in the Americas of the time, Tenochtitl\u00e1n, with an estimated population\nof one hundred thousand. Tenochtitl\u00e1n was located at the present site of Mexico City, and it was from there that\nthe Aztec expanded into the south and east to create an expansive empire. The Aztec federation was a regional\npower that subjugated other groups and extracted taxes and tributes from them. Though they borrowed ideas and\ninnovations from earlier groups such as the Maya, they made great strides in agriculture and urban development.\nThe Aztec rose to dominance in the fourteenth century and were still in power when the Europeans arrived. 295 World Regional Geography\nSpanish Conquest of 1519\u201321\nAfter the voyages of Columbus, the Spanish conquistadors came to the New World in search of gold, riches,\nand profits, bringing their Roman Catholic religion with them. Zealous church members sought to convert the\n\u201cheathens\u201d to their religion. One such conquistador was Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who, with his 508 soldiers, landed on\nthe shores of the Yucat\u00e1n in 1519. They made their way west toward the Aztec Empire. The wealth and power\nof the Aztecs attracted conquistadors such as Cort\u00e9s, whose goal was to conquer. Even with metal armor, steel\nswords, sixteen horses, and a few cannons, Cort\u00e9s and his men did not challenge the Aztecs directly. The Aztec\nleader Montezuma II originally thought Cort\u00e9s and his men were legendary \u201cWhite Gods\u201d returning to recover\nthe empire. Cort\u00e9s defeated the Aztecs by uniting the people that the Aztecs had subjugated and joining with them\nto fight the Aztecs. The Spanish conquest of the Aztec federation was complete by 1521.\nAs mentioned, the Spanish invasion of Middle America had devastating consequences for the indigenous\npopulations. It is estimated that there were between fifteen and twenty-five million Amerindians in Middle\nAmerica before the Europeans arrived. After a century of European colonialism, there were only about 2.5 million\nleft (Module 01). Cort\u00e9s defeated the Amerindian people by killing off the learned classes of the religious clergy,\npriestly orders, and those in authority. The local peasants and workers survived. The Spanish destroyed the\nknowledge base of the Maya and Aztec people. Their knowledge of astronomy, their advanced calendar, and\ntheir engineering technology were lost. Only through anthropology, archaeology, and the relearning of the culture\ncan we fully understand the expanse of these early empires. The local Amerindian descendants of the Maya and\nthe Aztec still live in the region, and there are dozens of other Amerindian groups in Mexico with their own\nlanguages, histories, and cultures.\nThe Spanish Colonial City\nAs the Spanish established urban centers in the New World, they structured each town after the Spanish pattern,\nwith a plaza in the center. Around the plaza on one side was the church (Roman Catholic, of course). On the other\nsides of the plaza were government offices and stores. Residential homes filled in around them. This pattern can\nstill be seen in almost all the cities built by the Spanish in Middle and South America. The Catholic Church not\nonly was located in the center of town but also was a supreme cultural force shaping and molding the Amerindian\nsocieties conquered by the Spanish. 5.1 Introducing the Realm 296\nIn Spain, the cultural norm was to develop urban centers wherever administration or military support was needed.\nSpanish colonizers followed a similar pattern in laying out the new urban centers in their colonies. Extending out\nfrom the city center (where the town plaza, government buildings, and church were located) was a commercial\ndistrict that was the backbone of this model. Expanding out on each side of the spine was a wealthy residential\ndistrict for the upper social classes, complete with office complexes, shopping districts, and upper-scale markets.\nFigure 5.4 Catholic Cathedral across from a Plaza in the Yucat\u00e1n City of Valladolid (left); Model of a Spanish Colonial Urban\nPattern (right)\nThe Spanish colonial urban pattern had a plaza in the center of the city with government buildings around the square and a Catholic\nchurch on one side.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nSurrounding the central business district (CBD) and the spine of most cities in Middle and South America are\nconcentric zones of residential districts for the lower, working, and middle classes and the poor. The first zone,\nthe zone of maturity, has well-established middle-class residential neighborhoods with city services. The second\nconcentric zone, the zone of transition (in situ accretion), has poorer working-class districts mixed with areas with\nmakeshift housing and without city services. The outer zone, the zone of periphery, is where the expansion of the\ncity occurs, with makeshift housing and squatter settlements. This zone has little or no city services and functions\non an informal economy. This outer zone often branches into the city, with slums known as favelas or barrios\nthat provide the working poor access to the city without its benefits. Impoverished immigrants that arrive in the 297 World Regional Geography\ncity from the rural areas often end up in the city\u2019s outer periphery to eke out a living in some of the worst living\nconditions in the world.\nCities in this Spanish model grow by having the outer ring progress to the point where eventually solid\nconstruction takes hold and city services are extended to accommodate the residents. When this ring reaches\nmaturity, a new ring of squatter settlements emerges to form a new outer ring of the city. The development\ndynamic is repeated, and the city continues to expand outward. The urban centers of Middle and South America\nare expanding at rapid rates. It is difficult to provide public services to the outer limits of many of the cities. The\nbarrios or favelas become isolated communities, often complete with crime bosses and gang activities that replace\nmunicipal security.\nFigure 5.5 Spanish-American City Structure According to the Ford-Griffin Model 5.1 Introducing the Realm 298\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Haciendas were located chiefly in the mainland and plantations were located mainly in the rimland.\n\u2022 Both the hacienda and the plantation structures of agriculture altered the ethnic makeup of their respective\nregions. The rimland had an African labor base, and the mainland had an Amerindian labor base.\n\u2022 In their quest for wealth, Spanish conquistadors destroyed the Aztec Empire and colonized the Middle\nAmerican mainland. Much historical knowledge was lost with the demise of the learned class of the Aztec\nEmpire. 299 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 Europeans introduced many new food crops and domesticated animals to the Americas and in turn brought\nnewly discovered agricultural products from America back to Europe.\n\u2022 The Spanish introduced the same style of urban planning to the Americas that was common in Spain. Many\ncities in Middle and South America were patterned after Spanish models.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What are the three main regions of Middle America?\n2.

Describe the physical geography of Mexico, identifying the core and peripheral areas.\n2. Outline the socioeconomic classes in Mexico and explain the ethnic differences of each.\n3. Explain how the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and maquiladoras have influenced the\neconomic and employment situations in Mexico.\n4. Understand how the drug cartels have become an integrated part of the Mexican economy and political\nsituation.\nPhysical Characteristics\nMexico is the eighth-largest country in the world and is about one-fifth the size of the United States. Bordered to\nthe north by the United States, Mexico stretches south to Central America, where it is bordered by Guatemala and\nBelize. One of Mexico\u2019s prominent geographical features is the world\u2019s longest peninsula, the 775-mile-long Baja\nCalifornia Peninsula, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of\nCortez). The Baja California Peninsula includes a series of mountain ranges called the Peninsular Ranges.\nThe Tropic of Cancer cuts across Mexico, dividing it into two different climatic zones: a temperate zone to the\nnorth and a tropical zone to the south. In the northern temperate zone, temperatures can be hot in the summer, often\nrising above 80 \u00b0F, but considerably cooler in the winter. By contrast, temperatures vary very little from season to\nseason in the tropical zone, with average temperatures hovering very close to 80 \u00b0F year-round. Temperatures in\nthe south tend to vary as a function of elevation.\nMexico is characterized by a great variety of climates, including areas with hot humid, temperate humid, and\narid climates. There are mountainous regions, foothills, plateaus, deserts, and coastal plains, all with their own\nclimatic conditions. For example, in the northern desert portions of the country, summer and winter temperatures\n301 5.2 Mexico 302\nare extreme. Temperatures in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts exceed 110 \u00b0F, while in the mountainous areas\nsnow can be seen at higher elevations throughout the year.\nTwo major mountain ranges extend north and south along Mexico\u2019s coastlines and are actually extensions of\nsouthwestern US ranges. The Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental run roughly parallel to each\nother. The Sierra Madre Occidental, an extension of the Sierra Nevada range, runs about 3,107 miles along the\nwest coast, with peaks higher than 9,843 feet. The Sierra Madre Oriental is an extension of the Rocky Mountains\nand runs 808 miles along the east coast. Between these two mountain ranges lies a group of broad plateaus,\nincluding the Mexican Plateau, or Mexican Altiplano (a wide valley between mountain ranges). The central\nportions, with their rolling hills and broad valleys, include fertile farms and productive ranch land. The Mexican\nAltiplano is divided into northern and southern sections, with the northern section dominated by Mexico\u2019s most\nexpansive desert, the Chihuahuan Desert.\nAnother prominent mountain range is the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica range, which as its name suggests, is a range\nof volcanoes that runs nearly 620 miles east to west across the central and southern portion of the country.\nGeologically speaking, this range represents the dividing line between North and Central America. The peaks of\nthe Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica can reach higher than 16,404 feet in height and are snow covered year-round.\nCopper Canyon, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, is about seven times larger than the Grand Canyon.\nCopper Canyon was formed by six rivers flowing through a series of twenty different canyons. Besides covering\na larger area than the Grand Canyon, at its deepest point, Copper Canyon is 1,462 feet deeper than the Grand\nCanyon.\nThough sandy beaches often come to mind when thinking about Mexico, the mountainous regions are home\nto pine-oak forests. More than a quarter of Mexico\u2019s landmass is covered in forests; as a result, timber is an\nimportant natural resource. Mexico ranks fourth in the world for biodiversity; it has the world\u2019s largest number\nof reptile species, ranks second for mammals, and ranks fourth for the number of amphibian and plant species. It\nis estimated that more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s species live here. Forest depletion is a key environmental\nconcern, but timber remains an important natural resource. The loss of natural habitat coincides with depletion of\nnatural resources and an increase in population.\nMexico is home to a range of volcanoes, some of which are active. Popocat\u00e9petl and Ixtacc\u00edhuatl (\u201cSmoking\nWarrior\u201d and \u201cWhite Lady,\u201d respectively, in the N\u00e1huatl language\u2014a primary language of the indigenous peoples\nin central Mexico) occasionally send out puffs of smoke clearly visible in Mexico City, reminding the city\u2019s\ninhabitants that eruption is a possibility. Popocat\u00e9petl is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, erupting\nfifteen times since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 CE. This volcano is close enough to populations to threaten\nmillions of people. 303 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.6 Major Volcanoes of Mexico\nSource: Map courtesy of USGS\/Cascades Volcano Observatory, http:\/\/vulcan.wr.usgs.gov\/Volcanoes\/Mexico\/Maps\/map_mexico_volcanoes.html.\nThree tectonic plates underlie Mexico, making it one of the most seismically active regions on earth. In 1985,\nan earthquake centered off Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast killed more than ten thousand people in Mexico City and did\nsignificant damage to the city\u2019s infrastructure.\nMany of Mexico\u2019s natural resources lie beneath the surface. Mexico is rich in natural resources and has robust\nmining industries that tap large deposits of silver, copper, gold, lead, and zinc. Mexico also has a sizable supply of\nsalt, fluorite, iron, manganese, sulfur, phosphate, tungsten, molybdenum, and gypsum. Natural gas and petroleum\nalso make the list of Mexico\u2019s natural resources and are important export products to the United States. There has\nbeen some concern about declining petroleum resources; however, new reserves are being found offshore in the\nGulf of Mexico.\nThough only about 13 percent of Mexico\u2019s land area is cultivated, favorable climatic conditions mean that\nfood products are also an important natural resource both for export and for the feeding the country\u2019s sizable\npopulation. Tomatoes, maize (corn), vanilla, avocado, beans, cotton, coffee, sugarcane, and fruit are harvested in\nsizable quantities. Of these, coffee, cotton, sugarcane, tomatoes, and fruit are primarily grown for export, with\nmost products bound for the United States.\nMexico has very pronounced wet and dry seasons. Most of the country receives rain between June and mid-\nOctober, with July being the wettest month. Much less rain occurs during the other months: February is usually\nthe driest month. More importantly, Mexico lies in the middle of the hurricane belt, and all regions of both coasts\nare at risk for these storms between June and November. Hurricanes along the Pacific coast are much less frequent\nand less violent than those along Mexico\u2019s Gulf and Caribbean coasts. Hurricanes can cause extensive damage to\ninfrastructure along the coasts where major tourist resorts are located. Mexico\u2019s extensive and beautiful coastlines\nprovide an important boon to the nation\u2019s tourism industry. 5.2 Mexico 304\nThe Core versus the Periphery\nIn the past few decades, the Mexican economy has slowly become less centralized and more focused on the private\nsector. The Mexican economy is a mix of modern industry, agriculture, and tourism. Current estimates indicate\nthat the service sector makes up about 60 percent of the economy, followed by the industrial sector at 33 percent.\nAgriculture represents just above 4 percent. Per-capita income in Mexico is about one-third of what it is in the\nUnited States. The Mexican labor force is estimated at forty-six million individuals; 14 percent of the labor force\nwork in agriculture, 23 percent in the industrial sector, and 62 percent in the service sector.\nMexico is an example of a country with a clear core-periphery spatial relationship. Mexico City and its\nsurrounding metropolitan centers represent the county\u2019s core: the center of activity, industry, wealth, and power.\nIndustries and manufacturing have been traditionally located in this region. The core region has most of the\ncountry\u2019s 110 million people (as of 2010). Mexico\u2019s population is about 77 percent urban, with the largest urban\nareas found in the core region.\nFigure 5.7 Mexican Economic Core Area Centered on Urban Areas around Mexico City 305 World Regional Geography\nThe periphery is the northern region, including the border area, and the southern region, including the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nMexico City is one of the largest cities in the world and anchors the core region of Mexico. In 2010, the official\npopulation of Mexico City was about eighteen million, but unofficial population estimates can reach thirty million.\nThe actual population of Mexico City is unknown because of the hundreds of slums that surround the city on the\nslopes of the central valley. Mexico City is growing at a rate of more than one thousand people per day through\na combination of the number of births and the number migrants. The lure of opportunities and advantages still\npulls migrants to the city in search of a better life. Higher populations tax the resources in rural areas, where jobs\nand opportunities are hard to find. This push-pull relationship creates a strong rural-to-urban shift in Mexico. This\nsame trend is found throughout the developing world.\nFigure 5.8 Mexico City on a Clear Day with the Ridge of the Mountains Visible in the Background 5.2 Mexico 306\nA day with extensive air pollution will restrict the view of the horizon.\nMatthew Rutledge \u2013 Wide view of Polanco \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nMexico City is a historic and vibrant city, but is not without problems. At higher than seven thousand feet in\nelevation, it is located between two mountain ranges. Air pollution is severe and is augmented by frequent air\ninversions that trap pollution over the city. To reduce air pollution, people are only allowed to drive their vehicles\non certain days according to odd or even license plate numbers. Older vehicles that do not pass emission standards\nare banned. Fresh water is in short supply, and wastewater from sewage is discharged into lakes down the valley.\nAmerindians who live by these lakes or on the islands have to deal with the pollution. Because about four to five\nmillion inhabitants of Mexico City have no utilities, human waste buildup has become a challenge. Fresh water\nis pumped into the city through pipelines from across the mountains. Leakage and inadequate maintenance cause\na large percentage of the water to be lost before it can be used in the city. Water is also drawn from underground\naquifers beneath the city, which has caused parts of the city to sink as much as two feet, causing serious structural\ndamage to historic buildings. 307 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.9 Mayan Home in the Rural Village of Yachachen in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula\nThis is located in a peripheral region of Mexico.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nOne of Mexico\u2019s largest peripheral regions lies to the south, along the country\u2019s border with Guatemala. It includes\nthe state of Chiapas and most of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and is primarily inhabited by Amerindians of Mayan\nancestry. As is typical of peripheral regions, little political or economic power is held by the residents, who find\nthemselves at the lowest end of the social and economic order. The highland region of Chiapas and the Yucat\u00e1n\nPeninsula are primarily agricultural regions with few industries. However, tourism has changed the northern\nYucat\u00e1n: Canc\u00fan has developed into a major tourist destination, and Mayan ruins in the region attract thousands\nof tourists each season. Unless the local population can benefit from tourism, there are few other opportunities for\nemployment in this part of Mexico. 5.2 Mexico 308\nMexican Social Order\nThe early European control of the land, the economy, and the political system created conflict for the people\nof Mexico. The country has experienced domination followed by revolution at various times, starting with\ncolonial domination, then economic domination, and lastly political domination. In each historic cycle, revolution\nand conflict were followed by change. The result was a mixing and acculturation of the Europeans and the\nAmerindians, which created the current mestizo mainstream society. Mestizos make up about 60 percent of the\ncurrent population, Europeans make up about 9 percent, and Amerindians make up about 30 percent. More\nthan sixty indigenous languages spoken by Amerindian groups are recognized in Mexico. At least seventeen\nindigenous languages are spoken by more than one hundred thousand people or more in Mexico, most of them\nliving in the southern part of the country.\nMexican society is regionally and ethnically diverse, with sharp socioeconomic divisions. Many rural\ncommunities have strong ties with their regions and are often referred to as patrias chicas (\u201csmall homelands\u201d),\nwhich helps to perpetuate the cultural diversity. The large number of indigenous languages and customs,\nespecially in the southern parts of Mexico, further emphasize cultural diversity. Idigenismo (\u201cpride in the\nindigenous heritage\u201d) has been a unifying theme of Mexico since the 1930s. However, daily life in Mexico can be\ndramatically different according to socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, rural or urban settlements, and other\ncultural differences. A peasant farmer in the rainforests of the Yucat\u00e1n will lead a very different life than a museum\ncurator in Mexico City or a lower-middle-class auto factory worker in Monterrey.\nFigure 5.10 Socioeconomic Classes in Mexico and Most of Latin America 309 World Regional Geography\nThe current social status of Mexican society can be illustrated by a pyramid shape (see Figure 5.10\n\u201cSocioeconomic Classes in Mexico and Most of Latin America\u201d). Those of European descent are at the top of\nthe pyramid and control a higher percentage of the wealth and power even though they are a minority of the\npopulation. The small middle class is largely mestizo, including managers, business people, and professionals.\nThe working poor make up most of the population at the bottom of the pyramid. The lower class contains the\nhighest percentage of people of Amerindian descent or, in the case of the Caribbean, African descent.\nThe most desirable type of social structure is illustrated by a diamond shape: in the middle is a large, employed\nmiddle class that can pay most of the taxes and purchase consumer goods that help bolster the economy. The\nnarrow top is made up of the richest, and the narrow bottom is made up of the poorest (see Figure 5.11 \u201cA More\nIdeal Socioeconomic Class Structure with a Large Middle-Class Tax Base\u201d). Unfortunately, this optimal type of\nsocial structure does not always materialize in the manner hoped for. As an example, a goal of the economic\nplanners of the United States has been to create a wide social profile. Unfortunately, in recent decades the US\nmiddle class has been declining, and the wealthy class and the working-class poor have increased. In Mexico,\nabout 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. 5.2 Mexico 310\nFigure 5.11 A More Ideal Socioeconomic Class Structure with a Large Middle-Class Tax Base\nOver the course of the past century, the people of Mexico have been working through a demographic transition.\nAs the rural regions of Mexico continued to have a high fertility rate, death rates declined, and the country\u2019s\npopulation grew exponentially. In 1970, the population of Mexico was about fifty million. By the year 2000, it\nhad doubled to more than one hundred million. However, the population estimate for 2010 was just greater than\n110 million. As Mexico urbanizes and industrializes, family size and fertility rates have been in decline, and\npopulation growth has slowed. 311 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.12 Population Pyramids for Mexico in 1980 and 2010\nPopulation pyramids for Mexico in 1980 and again in 2010. The 1980 pyramid indicates rapid population growth. The 2010 pyramid\nillustrates a slight decline in the past few years.\nSource: Data courtesy of US Census Bureau International Programs.\nRural-to-urban shift has increased the population of Mexico City, which is considered the primate city of the\ncountry. Rural Amerindian groups in the isolated and remote mountainous regions of Mexico have historically\nbeen self-sufficient for their daily needs and have relied on the land for their livelihoods. In the past few decades,\nhowever, large family sizes have forced many young people to look to the cities for employment. On a global\nscale, people in many countries are migrating from the periphery to the core.\nNAFTA and Maquiladoras\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), is a 1994 economic agreement between Canada, the\nUnited States, and Mexico that eliminated or reduced the tariffs, taxes, and quotas between the countries to\ncreate the world\u2019s largest trading bloc to compete with the European Union and the global economy. This\ntheoretically allows more corporate investments across borders and increases foreign ownership of business\nfacilities. It stimulated a shift in the location of industrial activity and in the migration patterns of people in\nMexico. Capitalizing on the old industrial locations of northern Mexico, such as Monterrey, corporations started\nto relocate manufacturing plants from the United States to the Mexican side of the border to take advantage of\nMexico\u2019s low-cost labor. The aspect of cheaper labor was a benefit understood to bolster corporate profits and 5.2 Mexico 312\nreduce product costs. The United States is one of the world\u2019s largest consumer markets, so these manufacturing\nplants, called maquiladoras (also known as maquilas), could benefit both countries.\nMaquiladoras are foreign-owned factories that import most of the raw materials or components needed for the\nproducts they manufacture, assemble, or process with local cheap labor, and then they export the finished product\nfor profit. US corporations own more than half the maquiladoras in Mexico, and about 80 percent of the finished\ngoods are exported back to the United States. Although most maquiladoras are located near the US-Mexican\nborder, additional factories are located around Monterrey and other cities with easy access to the United States. A\nmajor trade corridor is developing between Monterrey and Dallas\/Ft. Worth, which acts as a doorway to the US\nmarkets.\nFigure 5.13 Import\/Export System of a Maquiladora Operation\nThousands of maquiladoras flourish along the US-Mexican border, although the Mexican government has also\npromoted maquiladoras in other parts of Mexico. Maquiladoras provide jobs for workers in Mexico and provide\ncheaper goods for US consumers. However, this system has inherent problems. Labor unions in the United\nStates complain that the high-paying industrial jobs that support the US middle class are being lost to cheap\nMexican labor. Labor laws in Mexico are less rigorous than US laws, allowing for longer work hours and fewer\nbenefits for maquiladora employees. In addition, pollution standards in Mexico are not as restrictive as those\nin the United States, giving rise to environmental concerns. The central US-Mexican border region has dry or 313 World Regional Geography\narid type B climates with fresh water in short supply, and water is in high demand in industrial processes. With\nthe rapid increase in employment along the border, many of the people who work in the factories do not have\nadequate housing or utilities. Extensive slum areas have grown around maquiladora zones, which have little law\nenforcement, high crime, and few services.\nThe US-Mexican border region has become a strong pull factor, enticing poor people who seek greater\nopportunities and advantages to move from Mexico City and other southern regions of Mexico to the border\nregion to look for work. When they do not find work, they are tempted to cross the US border illegally. The United\nStates is considered a land of opportunity and attracts immigrants\u2014both legal and illegal\u2014from Mexico. For\npolitical and economic reasons, the main US political parties have been hesitant to seriously address the problem\nof the millions of illegal immigrants.\nFigure 5.14 US-Mexican Border 5.2 Mexico 314\nOpportunities and advantages drive the push-pull of migrants searching for improved economic conditions.\nIt is not only US corporations that have taken advantage of the explosion in the number of maquiladoras in\nMexico. European and Japanese companies have also muscled in on a share of the market. Capitalism thrives on\ncheap labor and accessible raw materials. With much of this industrial activity located in the northern sector of\nMexico, it becomes easier to understand the difficult issues that confront Mexico\u2019s southernmost state of Chiapas,\nwhere there is little benefit from this growth of economic activity.\nIn 1995, Chile was considered a possible addition to the countries participating in NAFTA. US congressional\ndifferences, however, have prevented Chile from being accepted as a full member. As a result, Chile remains a\n\u201csilent partner\u201d and conducts business according to similar rules. Agreements with Chile block Asian goods from\nmaking their way into the United States through Chile and Mexico. The United States, Mexico, and Canada all\nhave full-fledged independent free-trade agreements with Chile.\nThe Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is a plan to integrate the entire Western Hemisphere into one giant\ntrading bloc. The same concerns that the European Union faced regarding currency, language, and law confront\nthis proposal. A new currency called the Eagle was proposed as early as the 1990s to replace the Canadian dollar,\nthe US dollar, and the Mexican peso. In later years, a currency called the Amero was proposed for the same\npurpose, but its implementation is unlikely. Any change in the US dollar would affect a great number of countries:\nPuerto Rico (a territory of the United States) and the countries of Ecuador, Panama, and El Salvador already use 315 World Regional Geography\nthe US dollar as their standard currency. A one-currency solution might become a more viable option if the US\ndollar were to crash or significantly lose its value in the world marketplace.\nA goal of NAFTA is to exploit cheap labor until the Mexican economy rises to a level similar to that of the United\nStates and Canada, equalizing migration patterns and eventually bringing about a situation in which the border\ncheckpoints between the countries could be eliminated, as they have been within the European Union. Through the\ndevelopment of a larger middle class in Mexico, the three main countries of NAFTA would have similar standards\nof living. Mexico has a long way to go to arrive at this status but is making progress at the expense of the United\nStates and Canada. Corruption, organized crime, and drug wars have made progress in Mexico more difficult.\nCritics of NAFTA claim that the term free trade really means corporate trade. NAFTA is also viewed as a\ncomponent of globalization in the form of corporate colonialism, which only benefits those wealthy enough to\nhold investments at the corporate level. The exploitation of cheap labor has caused undue immigration across the\nUS-Mexican border, bringing millions of illegal workers into the United States. The Mexican government has not\nadequately addressed Mexico\u2019s economic conditions to provide jobs and opportunities for the people or to use the\nwealth held or controlled by the elite minority to enhance economic opportunities for the middle- and lower-class\nmajority.\nFigure 5.15 Labor and Resources in Globalization 5.2 Mexico 316\nSlave labor was prominent during European colonial era, whereas cheap labor is the target in neocolonial activity\u2014that is, corporate\ncolonialism.\nChiapas and NAFTA\nThe state of Chiapas in Mexico has an unequal distribution of wealth, a situation evident in most core-peripheral\nspatial relationships. Located in the rural highlands of Mexico and inhabited by a minority group that holds to the\nMayan language and traditions, Chiapas has few economic opportunities for its people. Wealthy landowners and\nthe ruling elite who have long held power have routinely taken advantage of peasant farmers. The aristocracy uses\nthe best land and pays low wages to local workers. Medical care, education, and government assistance have been\nslow in coming to this region and its people.\nIn the past few decades, various Amerindian groups have organized in the rural areas of Mexico in an attempt to\ncounter the power of the political elite. In Chiapas a group calling itself the Zapatista National Liberation Army\n(ZNLA) organized to coordinate an offensive against the Mexican government in various towns in the region.\nThe ZNLA was organized to coincide with the implementation of NAFTA among the United States, Canada,\nand Mexico in January of 1994. As each country claimed benefits from this agreement, the peripheral region of 317 World Regional Geography\nChiapas sought to receive their share of those benefits. The Mexican military was quick to react to the ZNLA\noffensive and rapidly drove them out of the towns they had occupied. The publicity and the international press\ncoverage assisted the ZNLA in getting their message out to the rest of the world.\nSince 1994, the ZNLA\u2019s guerilla forces have used their familiarity with the mountains for sanctuary and have\nfaced off against the Mexican military when negotiations with the federal government have broken down. The\nZNLA want greater recognition of their rights and their heritage and more autonomy over their region and lands.\nThis devolutionary process resembles that of various European regions desiring similar recognition of rights.\nSimilar conflicts are ongoing in other rural states of Mexico with majority Amerindian populations. There is a\ndirect relationship between social status and wealth and skin color in most regions of Mexico. The skin tone is\ndirectly related to a person\u2019s social status. On the one hand, Aztec and Mayan heritage is celebrated; on the other\nhand, their identity and darker skin relegates them to a lower socioeconomic status.\nIllegal Drug Trafficking in Mexico\nThe illegal drug trade is a multibillion-dollar industry, and Mexico has traditionally been the transitional area\nor stop-off point between the South American drug producing areas and entrance into US markets. Cocaine,\nmarijuana, and more recently heroin were produced in the Andes Mountains of South America and shipped north\nto the United States. Colombian cartels were once the main controllers of illegal drugs in the Western Hemisphere,\nbut in recent decades, organized crime units in Mexico have muscled in on the control of drugs coming through\nMexico, making deals with their South American counterparts to become the main traffickers of drugs into the\nUnited States, and the influence and power of Mexican drug cartels has increased immensely since the demise of\nthe Colombian cartels in the 1990s. Enormous profits fuel the competition for control. Just as the United States\nhas declared a war on drugs and has used its Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a main arm in combating\nthe industry, Mexico has had to address its own issues in the illegal drug trade.\nIllegal drug income flowing into Mexico has become a major part of the economy in specific areas. Drug kingpins\nhave used their economic power to buy off local police forces and silence opposition. They have also been\nknown to provide poor neighborhoods with funding for services that would normally be designated as government\nobligations. These actions have often provided a mixed reaction within the population in local areas. The drug\ncartels have become an integrated part of the fabric of Mexico.\nIn an attempt to combat the situation, the Mexican government has been engaged in its own internal war against 5.2 Mexico 318\nthe illegal drug trade. The battles between the drug cartels and the Mexican government have created a serious\ninternal conflict in the country, killing thousands of innocent bystanders in the cross fire. Armed conflicts between\nrival cartels or local gangs have increased the violence that has been intensifying since 2000. Mexican cities near\nthe US border have experienced increased incidences of major drug-related murders and gang violence. Higher\nvolumes of firearms trafficking from the United States and abroad into Mexico have been fueling the armed\nconflicts. Military and police casualties have increased, and the number of drug-related shootings are on the rise.\nFigure 5.16 Influence of Major Drug Cartels in Mexico\nMap courtesy of US Congress, Committee on Foreign Relations.\nCartels have been known to use jet airliners, semitrucks, and even submarines in their attempts to ship illegal\ndrugs into the United States. Large tunnels have been found beneath the US-Mexican border that were used to\nsmuggle drugs. Intimidation and corruption have been standard practices used by drug traffickers to protect their\ninterests. Bribes, payoffs, and corruption have been difficult to battle in a country with a high percentage of the\npopulation living in poor conditions. 319 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Mexico possesses extensive natural resources that provide for a wide range of biodiversity and economic\nactivities.\n\u2022 Mexico portrays a clear core-periphery spatial relationship. Mexico City and its urban neighbors anchor the\ncore, while the northern border region and states such as Chiapas represent the rural periphery.\n\u2022 People of European heritage continue to hold positions of power and privilege in Mexico\u2019s socioeconomic\nclass structure. Amerindian populations exist at the lowest level with the fewest economic opportunities.\n\u2022 Economic reforms that coincide with NAFTA have greatly enhanced the industrial capacity of Mexico and\nhelped integrate the country into the global economy.\n\u2022 Mexican drug traffickers have become the major controllers of illegal drugs entering the United States from\nthe south. Drug cartels in Mexico reap enormous profits and have become a major problem for the Mexican\ngovernment and the country.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Describe how the physical environment has affected human activity in Central America.\n2. Outline the various ways in which the United States has affected the region.\n3. Explain the similarities and the differences among the Central American republics.\n4. Understand how the Panama Canal came to be constructed and what role the United States has played in\nPanama.\nPhysical Environment\nCentral America is a land bridge connecting the North and South American continents, with the Pacific Ocean\nto its west and the Caribbean Sea to its east. A central mountain chain dominates the interior from Mexico to\nPanama. The coastal plains of Central America have tropical and humid type A climates. In the highland interior,\nthe climate changes with elevation. As one travels up the mountainsides, the temperature cools. Only Belize is\nlocated away from this interior mountain chain. Its rich soils and cooler climate have attracted more people to live\nin the mountainous regions than along the coast.\nHurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and volcanic activity produce recurring environmental problems for\nCentral America. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch swept through the region, devastating Nicaragua and El Salvador,\nwhich had already been devastated by civil wars in previous years.\nThe volcanic activity along the central mountain chain over time has provided rich volcanic soils in the mountain\nregion, which has attracted people to work the land for agriculture. Central America has traditionally been a\nrural peripheral economic area in which most of the people have worked the land. Family size has been larger\nthan average, and rural-to-urban shift dominates the migration patterns as the region urbanizes and industrializes.\n321 5.3 Central America 322\nNatural disasters, poverty, large families, and a lack of economic opportunities have made life difficult in much of\nCentral America.\nAltitudinal Zonation\nHigh mountains ranges run the length of Central and South America. The Andes Mountains of South America\nare the longest mountain chain in the world, and a large section of this mountain range is in the tropics. Tropical\nregions usually have humid type A climates. What is significant in Latin America is that while the climate at the\nbase of the Andes may be type A, the different zones of climate and corresponding human activity vary as one\nmoves up the mountain in elevation. Mountains have different climates at the base than at the summit. Type H\nhighland climates describe mountainous areas that exhibit different climate types at varying degrees of elevation.\nHuman activity varies with elevation, and the activities can be categorized into zones according to altitudinal\nzonation. Each zone has its own type of vegetation and agricultural activity suited to the climate found at\nthat elevation. For every thousand-foot increase in elevation, temperature drops 3.5 \u00baF. In the tropical areas of\nLatin America, there are five established temperature-altitude zones. Elevation zones may vary depending on a\nparticular location\u2019s distance from the equator.\n1. Tierra caliente (hot land): Sea level to 2,500 feet\n2. Tierra templada (temperate land): 2,500 to 6,000 feet\n3. Tierra fria (cold land): 6,000 to 12,000 feet\n4. Tierra helada (frozen land): 12,000 to 15,000 feet\n5. Tierra nevada (snowy land): Above 15,000 feet 323 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.17 Altitudinal Zonation System in Latin America\nTierra Caliente (Hot Land): Sea Level to 2,500 Feet\nFrom sea level to 2,500 feet are the humid tropical lowlands found on the coastal plains. The coastal plains on the\nwest coast of Middle America are quite narrow, but they are wider along the Caribbean coast. Vegetation includes\ntropical rain forests and tropical commercial plantations. Food crops include bananas, manioc, sweet potatoes,\nyams, corn, beans, and rice. Livestock are raised at this level, and sugarcane is an important cash crop. Tropical\ndiseases are most common, and large human populations are not commonly attracted to this zone. 5.3 Central America 324\nTierra Templada (Temperate Land): 2,501 to 6,000 Feet\nFrom 2,500 to 6,000 feet is a zone with cooler temperatures than at sea level. This is the most populated zone\nof Latin America. Four of the seven capitals of the Central American republics are found in this zone. Just as\ntemperate climates attract human activity, this zone provides a pleasant environment for habitation. The best\ncoffee is grown at these elevations, and most other food crops can be grown here, including wheat and small\ngrains.\nTierra Fria (Cold Land): 6,001 to 12,000 Feet\nFrom 6,000 to 12,000 feet is the highest zone found in Middle America. This zone is usually the limit of the\ntree line; few trees grow north of this zone. The shorter growing season and cooler temperatures found at these\nelevations are still adequate for growing agricultural crops of wheat, barley, potatoes, or corn. Livestock can graze\nand be raised on the grasslands. The Inca Empire of the Andes Mountains in South America flourished in this\nzone.\nTierra Helada (Frozen Land): 12,001 to 15,000 Feet\nSome classify this as the \u201cPuna\u201d zone. At this elevation, there are no trees. The only human activity is the raising\nof livestock such as sheep or llama on any short grasses available in the highland meadows. Snow and cold 325 World Regional Geography\ndominate the zone. Central America does not have a tierra helada zone, but it is found in the higher Andes\nMountain Ranges of South America.\nTierra Nevada (Snowy Land): Above 15,000 Feet\nThere is little human activity above 15,000 feet. Permanent snow and ice is found here, and little vegetation is\navailable. Many classification systems combine this zone with the tierra helada zone.\nEuropean Colonialism\nAmerindian groups dominated Central America before the European colonial powers arrived. The Maya are\nstill prominent in the north and make up about half the population of Guatemala. Other Amerindian groups\nare encountered farther south, and many still speak their indigenous languages and hold to traditional cultural\ncustoms. People of European stock or upper-class mestizos now control political and economic power in Central\nAmerica. Indigenous Amerindian groups find themselves on the lower rung of the socioeconomic ladder. 5.3 Central America 326\nFigure 5.18 Central American Republics\nDuring colonial times, the Spanish conquistadors dominated Central America with the exception of the area\nof Belize, which was a British colony called British Honduras until 1981. Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\nNicaragua, and Costa Rica were Spanish colonies and became independent of Spain in the 1820s. Panama was a\npart of Colombia and was not independent until the United States prompted an independence movement in 1903\nto develop the Panama Canal. As is usually the case with colonialism, the main religion and the lingua franca of\nthe Central American states are those of the European colonizers, in this case Roman Catholicism and Spanish.\nIn some locations, the language and religion take on variant forms that mix the traditional with the European to\ncreate a unique local cultural environment.\nPeople and Population\nAbout 50 percent of the people of Central America live in rural areas, and because the economy is agriculturally 327 World Regional Geography\nbased, family size has traditionally been large. Until the 1990s, family size averaged as high as six children. As the\npressures of the postindustrial age have influenced Central America, average family size has been decreasing and\nis now about half that of the pre-1990s and is declining. For example, the World Bank reports that in Nicaragua\nthe average woman has 2.68 children during her lifetime (The World Bank). Rural-to-urban shift is common, and\nas the region experiences more urbanization and industrialization, family size will decrease even more.\nDuring the twentieth century, much of Central America experienced development similar to stage 2 of the index\nof economic development. An influx of light industry and manufacturing firms seeking cheap labor has pushed\nmany areas into stage 3 development. The primate cities and main urban centers are feeling the impact of this\nshift.\nOver the years, larger family sizes have created populations with a higher percentage of young people and a\nlower percentage of older people. Cities are often overwhelmed with young migrants from the countryside with\nfew or no places to live. Rapid urbanization places a strain on urban areas because services, infrastructure,\nand housing cannot keep pace with population growth. Slums with self-constructed housing districts emerge\naround the existing urban infrastructure. The United States has also become a destination for people looking for\nopportunities or advantages not found in these cities.\nCAFTA and Neocolonialism\nJust as Canada, the United States, and Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\ninto law in 1994, the United States and five Central American states signed the Central American Free Trade\nAgreement (CAFTA) in 2006. The agreement was signed by trade representatives from El Salvador, Honduras,\nNicaragua, Guatemala, and the United States. The CAFTA-DR agreement, which includes the Dominican\nRepublic, was ratified in 2007. In 2010, Costa Rica\u2019s legislature approved a measure to join the agreement.\nCAFTA is supported by the same forces that advocated neocolonialism in other regions of the world.\nCAFTA\u2019s purpose is to reduce trade barriers between the United States and Central America, thus affecting labor,\nhuman rights, and the flow of wealth. During negotiations for CAFTA, US political forces cited CAFTA as a top\npriority and argued that it would help move forward the possibility of the larger Free Trade Area of the Americas\n(FTAA), which would create a single market for the Americas.\nCountries gain national wealth in the three main ways: by growing it, extracting it, or manufacturing it. These\nmethods, however, contribute to a nation\u2019s wealth only if the wealth stays within the country. With free-trade 5.3 Central America 328\nagreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA, the wealth gained from manufacturing, which has the highest value-\nadded profits, does not stay in the country of production. Instead, the profits are carted off to the foreign\ncorporation that controls the industrial factory. Multinational corporations see Central American countries as\nprofitable sites for industrial; they can exploit cheap labor sources and at the same time provide jobs for local\npeople. These advantages should result in lower product costs for consumers.\nThere have been protest marches and anti-CAFTA activities in many Central American countries. Costa Rica,\none of the most stable countries in the region, had problems passing the agreement because of voter opposition.\nOne of the primary arguments opponents to CAFTA make is that the wealth generated by the exploitation of the\navailable cheap labor will not stay in Central America; instead, it will be removed by the wealthy core nations,\njust as European colonialism removed the wealth generated by the conquistadors and shipped it back to Europe.\nThose who oppose CAFTA and corporate colonialism also cite the following arguments:\n\u2022 A popular argument against CAFTA is that \u201cfree trade\u201d is the same as corporate trade. Expanding\ncorporate-controlled free trade makes the global south more dependent on the global north, and the\ncorporations reap the profits.\n\u2022 CAFTA promotes corporate colonialism or neocolonialism. The \u201chave\u201d countries dominate and take\nadvantage of the \u201chave-not\u201d countries to an ever-greater extent. The small countries of Central\nAmerica cannot compete with large US corporations, which pressure and influence political systems to\nprovide advantages and opportunities to exploit the smaller, weaker nations of Central America.\n\u2022 CAFTA diminishes the power of Central American countries to regulate their own economies and\nprotect their own citizens; that is, concentration of power in the hands of corporations with strong ties\nto those in political power allows the elite to maintain control over a country\u2019s economy.\n\u2022 CAFTA forces small developing countries with no chance of competing successfully against the\nUnited States to open their markets to powerful US corporations.\n\u2022 CAFTA leads to further privatization of social services, decreases public access to basic services, and\ngives corporations more money and control.\n\u2022 CAFTA forces competition for the lowest wages and lowest production costs, which drives wages\ndown in the United States and keeps them down throughout Central America while at the same time\nproviding huge profits to multinational corporations.\nFigure 5.19 Protest against CAFTA in Central America 329 World Regional Geography\nThe banner reads, \u201cFor the sovereignty of the people\u2026we demand the repeal of CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement).\u201d\nLaura \u2013 For the sovereignty of the people\u2026 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSupporters of CAFTA claim that it provides jobs, infrastructure, and opportunities to the developing countries of\nCentral America. In return, cheap consumer goods are available to the people. The globalized economy is a mixed\ngame: on the one hand, consumer goods are inexpensive to purchase; on the other hand, the world\u2019s wealth flows\ninto the hands of a few people at the top and is not always shared with most of the people who contribute to it.\nThe Republics: Diverse Political Geography\nCentral American countries might share similar climate patterns, but they do not share similar political or\neconomic dynamics. The political geography of the region is diverse and ranges from a history of total civil war\nto peace and stability. The growing pains of each country as it competes and engages in the global economy\noften cause turmoil and conflict. Each state has found a different path, but each has dealt with similar issues with 5.3 Central America 330\nvarying degrees of success. Barriers to progress range from political corruption to gang violence. Stability has\ncome to the communities that have found new avenues of gaining wealth and creating a higher standard of living.\nGuatemala\nFigure 5.20 Woman Selling Fruit in a Guatemalan Market 331 World Regional Geography\nJohn Barrie \u2013 Antigua Market \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIn the late 1900s, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua experienced devastating civil wars that divided their\npeople and destroyed their economies. In the Mayan state of Guatemala, the 1960\u201396 civil war was fought\nbetween the right-wing Ladinos (urbanized mestizos and Maya) and the left-wing rural Amerindian Mayan\nmajority. The genesis of this war was democratically elected president Jacobo Arbenz\u2019s social reforms, which\nconflicted with the interests of the US-based United Fruit Company. In 1954, US-backed forces, funded by the\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA), overthrew Arbenz and laid the groundwork for civil unrest for the next four\ndecades. Right-wing and left-wing death squads terrorized the country until the latter 1990s, when the Catholic\nChurch brokered a peace accord. The poor and devastated country is now moving forward on its path to recovery. 5.3 Central America 332\nEl Salvador\nIn the coffee republic of El Salvador, the civil war of 1979\u201392 was fought between the government-backed\nwealthy land-owning elite and the peasants who worked the land and lived in poverty. A few powerful families\nowned almost the entire country. Coffee is a major export crop for El Salvador, a country with a mild climate at\nits higher elevations. Arabica coffee grows well at these elevations. To protect their economic interests, US coffee\ncompanies backed the wealthy elite in El Salvador and lobbied the support of the US government. US military\nadvisors and CIA support aided El Salvador\u2019s government forces. At the same time, the peasants of El Salvador\nwere soliciting support from Nicaragua and Cuba, which were backed by the Soviet Union.\nAfter the civil war devastated the country and killed an estimated seventy-five thousand people, a peace agreement\nthat included land reform was finally reached in 1992. El Salvador is a small country about the size of the US\nstate of New Jersey with a population of more than six million people. The war devastated this rural mountainous\ncountry and forced more than three hundred thousand people to become refugees in other countries. Many\nmigrated north to the United States. Recovery from the war has been difficult and has been hampered by natural\ndisasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.\nNicaragua\nAt the same time that civil wars were going on in Guatemala and El Salvador, there was conflict in Nicaragua.\nAfter US marines occupied the country from 1926 to 1933, the US-backed Somoza family took power and\nremained there for decades. By 1978, violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption engulfed\nthe country. An estimated fifty thousand people died in a bitter civil war that ousted the Somoza regime and\nbrought the Marxist Sandinista government to power in 1979.\nNicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the United States to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra (short for\ncounterrevolutionary) guerrillas through much of the 1980s and to bring about a second Nicaraguan civil war. In\n1982, the US Congress blocked direct US aid to the contra forces through the Boland Amendment. Covert activity\nby CIA operatives continued to fund the contra forces by selling surplus US arms to Iran, brokered through Israel.\nIn spite of a US embargo against Iran and animosity between Israel and Iran, the deals went through with hopes of\nnegotiating the release of US hostages in Lebanon. The profits from these illegal covert arms sales were funneled 333 World Regional Geography\ninto support for the contra forces in Nicaragua, and the scandal, known as the Iran-Contra Affair, has become a\nstandard reference for US intervention in Central America.\nFigure 5.21 Dynamics of the Iran-Contra Affair\nIn 1990, at the end of the Sandinista-Contra War, democratic elections were carried out. Regardless of the Iran-\nContra Affair, the US-backed candidate defeated the Sandinista incumbent. The civil war between the Sandinistas\nand the contras cost an estimated thirty thousand lives. The country\u2019s infrastructure and economy were both\nin shambles after this era. Despite this history, the people of Nicaragua have worked hard to move forward.\nIncreasing stability in the past decade has improved the country\u2019s potential for economic opportunities and has\nprompted the country to promote tourism and work to increase employment opportunities for its people. 5.3 Central America 334\nHonduras\nHonduras has not experienced civil war, even though it is located in the midst of three troubled neighbors. It\nis considered a banana republic. American fruit companies have dominated the economy of this poor country\nand have supported the buildup of arms to ensure its stability. The term banana republic applies here only in\nthe manner in which the region was dominated by foreign companies that grew bananas for export. Often the\nfruit companies would buy up large tracts of land and employ (for low wages) those displaced from the land\nto help grow the bananas. There have been incidences in history when US fruit companies involved themselves\nin the political affairs of Central American countries to gain an economic advantage. Foreign fruit companies\nhave monopolized the market in Central America to extract higher profits and control economic regulations. At\nthe present time, international corporations have started to invest in places such as Honduras to capitalize on the\ncountry\u2019s cheap labor pool and relatively stable economic and political conditions.\nFigure 5.22 Three Banana Republics of Central America: Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras 335 World Regional Geography\nAll three have been dominated by US corporate interests.\nMike Mozart \u2013 Chiquita Bananas Minions Movie Stickers \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nCosta Rica\nIf there is a bright spot in Central America, it is the democratic and peaceful Costa Rica, which does not have an\narmy. The stable, democratically elected government and growing economy has earned the country the nickname\nthe Switzerland of Central America. Multinational companies have been moving here to take advantage of the\nstable economic conditions, low labor costs, and supportive environment for its employees. The California-\nbased Intel Corporation has a large microchip-manufacturing site in Costa Rica, which contributes heavily to the\ncountry\u2019s economy. The tropical climate and stable economy of Costa Rica also attract US tourists and people\nlooking for a place to live after retirement. Costa Rica has borrowed heavily to finance social programs, education,\nand infrastructure and relies on tourism, outside forces, and economic development to help pay the bills.\nBelize 5.3 Central America 336\nFigure 5.23\nGeographer Dr. David Meyer examines a sugarcane stalk in Belize. Belize portrays traits of a rimland state, complete with plantation\nagriculture and African influence.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nAt the northern end of Central America is the former British colony of Belize, which in gained independence\nin 1981. Belize borders the Caribbean Sea and has a hot, tropical type A climate. It is small in size\u2014about the\nsize of El Salvador\u2014and in population, with only about three hundred thousand people. Belize\u2019s lingua franca is\nEnglish, but Spanish is increasing in usage because of immigration. It has the longest coral reef in the Western\nHemisphere and has been promoting ecotourism as a means of economic development to capitalize on this aspect.\nAfter hurricanes ravaged the coastal Belize City, the country shifted its capital forty-five miles inland to Belmopan\nas a protective measure. Belmopan is a small, centrally located city with only about ten thousand people. It is\ncalled a forward capital, a term used to describe a capital city of a country that has been moved to better serve or\nprotect the country\u2019s interests. 337 World Regional Geography\nPanama and the Panama Canal\nDuring the 1880s, the region of Panama was part of South America and was controlled by colonial Colombia,\nwhich was formerly colonized by Spain. To travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, ships had to sail\naround the southern tip of South America, which was time consuming and difficult to negotiate in some places\ndue to ocean currents.\nFrance made an agreement with Colombia to purchase a strip of land in Panama ten miles wide and about fifty\nmiles long to build a canal. The French had experience in building the Suez Canal between the Red Sea and the\nMediterranean and applied their skills in Panama. The tropical climate and swampy terrain, however, quickly\ndefeated the French workers with malaria, yellow fever, and other tropical diseases.\nIn the United States, there was an increasing need to shorten the shipping distance between California and New\nYork. Before the United States took over the canal project after the French abandoned it, Panama was separated\nfrom Colombia in a brief civil war and declared independent in 1903.\nUnderstanding the problems that the French had encountered, the United States first sent civil engineers and\nmedical professionals to Panama to drain the swamps and apply tons of chemicals such as the insecticide DDT\nto eradicate the mosquito population. These chemicals were later found to be toxic to humans but worked well in\neliminating the mosquito problem. The Panama Canal was finally completed by the United States and opened for\nbusiness in 1914 after tremendous difficulties had been overcome.\nMany workers were imported from the Caribbean to help build the canal, which changed the ethnic makeup of\nPanama\u2019s population. About 14 percent of the population of Panama has West Indian ancestry, and many of the\nlaborers were of African descent. The difference in ethnicity caused an early layering of society, with those from\nthe Caribbean finding themselves at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale.\nFigure 5.24 Locks on the Panama Canal 5.3 Central America 338\nAlmost fifteen thousand vessels pass through the Panama Canal every year.\nRobbie \u2013 Pedro Miguel Locks, Panama Canal \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nThe Panama Canal is a marvel of engineering. An interior waterway was dammed up to create the artificial Lake\nGat\u00fan at eighty-five feet above sea level. This large inland lake provides a freshwater channel extending most of\nthe way across the Isthmus of Panama. Canal channels on each end of Lake Gat\u00fan connect it with the sea. Locks\nraise and lower ships from sea level to the eighty-five-foot water level of the canal and the lake. Gravity provides\nfresh water from Lake Gat\u00fan to fill the locks that raise and lower ships. As ships travel through the locks, the\nfresh water is eventually emptied into the sea. Rainfall is critical to resupply the water in Lake Gat\u00fan to keep the\nwater channel constant and to keep the canal locks in operation. The canal channel has to be dredged periodically\nto keep it from silting in. In recent years, deforestation has reduced the number of trees around the lake, resulting\nin more silt entering the lake bed. A program to replant trees has been implemented to secure the lake and restore\nthe natural conditions.\nFigure 5.25 Panama Canal System 339 World Regional Geography\nThe water for the locks is from Lake Gat\u00fan, which is eighty-five feet above sea level.\nRecently, the politics of the Panama Canal have become more of an issue than the operation of the canal itself. In\n1977, US president Jimmy Carter entered into an agreement with Panamanian president Omar Torrijos to return\nthe canal to the government of Panama. Under this agreement, both the Panama Canal Zone and the actual canal\nwere to be returned to Panama by the end of 1999. Many Americans opposed the return of the canal to Panama.\nPresident Ronald Reagan campaigned on this position. The United States had military installations in the Canal\nZone and had used this area as a training ground for the Vietnam War and other military missions. The United\nStates operated the School of the Americas (SOA) in the Canal Zone, which was a place to train counterinsurgents\nand military personnel from other countries. The SOA was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1984 and was\nrenamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) in 2001.\nOne of the early graduates of the SOA was a young Panamanian officer by the name of Manuel Noriega, who\nwas placed on the CIA payroll in 1967. He was an important figure, helping with the US war against Nicaragua\nand generally serving US interests in the region in spite of the fact he was a known drug dealer. In May 1989,\nNoriega was elected president of Panama and became less supportive of US interests in the region. In December\n1989, the United States invaded Panama and captured Noriega. He was sentenced to forty years in a US prison\nfor drug trafficking and held as a political prisoner. Even after Noriega\u2019s arrest, the United States was not allowed\nto retain use of the Canal Zone for military purposes, which was a major reason for the US presence in Panama.\nThe Panama Canal Zone was an excellent geographical location for US military operations because it provided\nan excellent base to monitor military activity in South America. US military planes could fly from US bases to\nPanama without refueling, and the planes could then fly out of Panama to monitor activity in South America.\nOne of President Carter\u2019s arguments for the return of the canal to Panama was that after the US military had\nsupported the war with Colombia to make Panama independent in 1903, there had been no proper authorization\nfrom the Panamanian people to cede the Canal Zone to the United States. International law ruled that the Canal\nZone was still sovereign Panamanian territory. The US military claimed the reason for remaining in the Canal\nZone was to provide security for the canal.\nThe Canal Zone and the actual Panama Canal were returned to Panama in 2000. The question arises, does the\nsmall country of Panama, with only about three million people, have the resources to manage and maintain the\ncanal operations? To assist in economic development, Panama has established a free-trade zone next to the canal 5.3 Central America 340\nto entice international commerce. Originally established in 1948, the free-trade zone has become one of the largest\nof its kind in the world. Panama City has also become a hub of international banking with the dubious claim of\nbeing a main money-laundering center for Colombian drug money. Panama is striving to be a main economic\ncenter for the region, which would advance economic globalization and trade for Panama.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Central America shares a similar climate type and physical features. It has enormous potential for tourism\ndevelopment. The political history of the region is quite diverse, with each republic experiencing different\npolitical and economic conditions.\n\u2022 High population growth and rapid rural-to-urban shift has created higher unemployment rates and fewer\neconomic opportunities. CAFTA was implemented to help multinational corporations tap into the cheap\nlabor pool.\n\u2022 The United States has had a major impact on this region both politically and economically. The United\nStates has intervened in civil wars and invaded Panama. US companies have dominated much of the\nregion\u2019s fruit and coffee production. Most recently, the United States has supported industrial activities and\nthe implementation of CAFTA.\n\u2022 The Panama Canal has been a vital transportation link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for the\nUnited States and the world. The Panama Canal Zone was a valuable strategic location for the operation of\nUS military exercises. The United States was a major controller of the Panama Canal until the year 2000,\nwhen the canal and the Canal Zone was returned to Panama.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Identify the main music genres that have emerged from the Caribbean.\nThe regions of Middle America and South America, including the Caribbean, follow similar colonial patterns of\ninvasion, dominance, and development by outside European powers. The Caribbean Basin is often divided into\nthe Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles (the bigger islands and the smaller islands, respectively). The Greater\nAntilles includes the four large islands of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. The Lesser Antilles are\nin the eastern and southern region. The Bahamas are technically in the Atlantic Ocean, not in the Caribbean Sea,\nbut they are usually associated with the Caribbean region and are often affiliated with the Lesser Antilles. Middle\nAmerica can be divided into two geographic areas according to occupational activities and colonial dynamics.\nThe rimland includes the Caribbean islands and the Caribbean coastal areas of Central America. The mainland\nincludes the interior of Mexico and Central America.\nFigure 5.26 Caribbean Regions of the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles, and the Bahamas\n342 343 World Regional Geography\nMany of the Caribbean islands experience the rain shadow effect. Jamaica has as much as a twenty-inch difference\nin rainfall between the north side and south side of the island because most of the rain falls on the north side,\nwhere the prevailing winds hit the island. The Blue Mountains in the eastern part of the island provide a rain\nshadow effect. Puerto Rico has a tropical rain forest on the northeastern part of the island, which receives a large\namount of rainfall. The rain shadow effect creates semidesert conditions on the southwestern side of Puerto Rico\nbecause the southwestern side receives little rainfall. Low elevation islands such as the Bahamas do not receive as\nmuch rain because they are not high enough to affect the precipitation patterns of rain clouds.\nEuropean Colonialism in the Caribbean\nThe Spanish were not the only Europeans to take advantage of colonial expansion in the Caribbean: the English,\nFrench, Dutch, and other Europeans followed. Most of the European colonial countries were located on the west\ncoast of Europe, which had a seafaring heritage. This included smaller countries such as Denmark, Sweden, and 5.4 The Caribbean 344\nBelgium. The Caribbean Basin became an active region for European ships to enter and vie for possession of each\nisland.\nMany of the Caribbean islands changed hands several times before finally being secured as established colonies\n(see Table 5.1 \u201cHistorical Caribbean Colonizers\u201d). The cultural traits of each of the European colonizers were\ninjected into the fabric of the islands they colonized; thus, the languages, religions, and economic activities of\nthe colonized islands reflected those of the European colonizers rather than those of the native people who had\ninhabited the islands originally. The four main colonial powers in the Caribbean were the Spanish, English, Dutch,\nand French. Other countries that held possession of various islands at different times were Portugal, Sweden, and\nDenmark. The United States became a colonial power when they gained Cuba and Puerto Rico as a result of\nthe Spanish-American War. The US Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1918. Sweden controlled\nthe island of St. Barthelemy from 1784 to 1878 before trading it back to the French, who had been the original\ncolonizer. Portugal originally colonized Barbados before abandoning it to the British.\nTable 5.1 Historical Caribbean Colonizers\nColonizer European colonies\nSpain Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico\nBahamas, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent,\nBritish\nGrenada, Barbados, Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Montserrat, Anguilla, St. Kitts and Nevis\nDutch Curacao, Bonaire, Aruba, St. Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maarten (south half)\nFrench Haiti, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Martin (north half), St. Barthelemy\nUnited\nPuerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Cuba\nStates\nColonialism drastically altered the ethnic makeup of the Caribbean; Amerindians were virtually eliminated after\nthe arrival of Africans, Europeans, and Asians. The current social hierarchy of the Caribbean can be illustrated by\nthe pyramid-shaped graphic that was used to illustrate social hierarchy in Mexico (Figure 5.10 \u201cSocioeconomic\nClasses in Mexico and Most of Latin America\u201d). Those of European descent are at the top of the pyramid and\ncontrol a higher percentage of the wealth and power even though they are a minority of the population. In the\nCaribbean, the middle class includes mulattos, or people with both African and European heritage, many of\nwhich include managers, businesspeople, and professionals. In some countries, such as Haiti, the minority mulatto\nsegment of the population makes up the power base and holds political and economic advantage over the rest of 345 World Regional Geography\nthe country while the working poor at the bottom of the pyramid make up most of the population. In the Caribbean,\nthe lower economic class contains the highest percentage of people of African heritage.\nNot only was colonialism the vehicle that brought many Africans to the Caribbean through the slave trade, but\nit brought many people from Asia to the Caribbean as well. Once slavery became illegal, the colonial powers\nbrought indentured laborers to the Caribbean from their Asian colonies. Cuba was the destination for over\none hundred thousand Chinese workers, so Havana can claim the first Chinatown in the Western Hemisphere.\nLaborers from the British colonies of India and other parts of South Asia arrived by ship in various British\ncolonies in the Caribbean. At the present time, about 40 percent of the population of Trinidad can claim South\nAsian heritage and a large number follow the Hindu faith.\nThe Greater Antilles\nCuba: A Rimland Experience\nThe largest island in the Greater Antilles is Cuba, which was transformed by the power of colonialism, the\ntransition to plantation agriculture, and a socialist revolution. The island country of Cuba is slightly larger than\nthe US state of Kentucky, but it has more than eleven million people, while Kentucky has just over 4.2 million.\nThe elongated island has the Sierra Maestra mountains on its eastern end, the Escambray Mountains in the center,\nand the Western Karst region in the west, near Vi\u00f1ales. Low hills and fertile valleys cover more than half the\nisland. The pristine waters of the Caribbean that surround the island make for some of the most attractive tourism\nlocations in the Caribbean region. 5.4 The Caribbean 346\nIt has been estimated that as many as one hundred thousand Amerindians inhabited Cuba when Christopher\nColumbus first landed on the island in 1492. Except for brief control by the British, the island was a Spanish\ncolony until 1898. Plantation agriculture was established, and slaves provided the labor. History indicates that\nmore than eight hundred thousand African slaves were brought to Cuba between 1800 and 1870. Slave labor was\nin high demand on the extensive sugar plantations that dominated the island\u2019s economy. The African influence can\nstill be witnessed today in the main religion of the island, Santeria, which is an overlay of African-based spirits\non top of Catholic saints. At the present time, an estimated 70 percent of Cubans practice some aspect of Santeria.\nWith the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War, the United States gained possession of the Spanish\npossessions of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and various other islands and thus became a colonial\npower. Cuba technically became independent in 1902 but remained under US influence for decades. Sugar\nplantations and the sugar industry came to be owned and operated by US interests, and wealthy Americans bought\nup large haciendas (large estates), farmland, and family estates, as well as industrial and business operations.\nOrganized crime syndicates operated many of the nightclubs and casinos in Havana. As long as government\nleaders supported US interests, things went well with business as usual.\nFigure 5.27 US \u201cColonial\u201d Influence in Cuba 347 World Regional Geography\nThe old capitol building in Havana, a replica of the US Capitol, was built by the United States during their control of Cuba. The\nbuilding is a tourist area and no longer used for the government. The old US cars in the photo were made before the Cuban Revolution\n(1958) but are still used and make up about half the motor vehicles in Havana.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe Cuban Revolution\nIn January of 1934, with the encouragement of the US government, Fulgencio Batista led a coup that took\ncontrol of the Cuban government. Fidel Castro, once a prisoner under Batista and having fled to Mexico in exile\nfor a number of years, returned to Cuba to start a revolution. Joining him were his brother Ra\u00fal Castro and\nrevolutionaries such as Che Guevara, an Argentinean doctor turned comrade-in-arms. Starting in the remote and\nrugged Sierra Maestras in the east, Castro rallied the support of the Cuban people. By the end of 1958, the Cuban\nRevolution brought down the US-backed Batista government. Castro gained power and had the support of most\nof the Cuban population.\nFigure 5.28 Fidel Castro (left); Billboard in Havana Promoting the Virtues of Revolutionaries Antonio Maceo and Che\nGuevara (right) 5.4 The Caribbean 348\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0; R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nCastro worked to recover Cuba for Cubans. The government cleared rampant gambling from the island, forcing\norganized crime operations to shut down or move back to the United States. Castro nationalized all foreign\nlandholdings and the sugar plantations, as well as all the utilities, port facilities, and other industries. Foreign\nownership of land and businesses in Cuba was forbidden. Large estates, once owned by rich US families, were\ntaken over and recovered for Cuban purposes.\nThe US Embargo Era\nCastro\u2019s policy of seizing (nationalizing) businesses and property raised concerns in the United States. As a result,\nUS president Dwight D. Eisenhower severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1960 and issued an executive order\nimplementing a partial trade embargo to prohibit the importation of Cuban goods. Later presidents implemented a\nfull-scale embargo, restricting travel and trade with Cuba. In March 1960, the Central Intelligence Agency trained\nCuban exiles for an invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, on the south side of the island. This failed invasion\nattempt only resulted in consolidating the Cuban people\u2019s support for Castro and his socialist government.\nTo deter any further US plans of invading or destabilizing Cuba, Castro sought economic and military assistance\nfrom the Soviet Union. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to secretly send missiles armed with nuclear\nweapons capable of hitting targets within the United States. In September 1962, US spy planes identified the\nmissile sites. On October 22, 1962, President John F. Kennedy announced a naval blockade of the island and\ninformed Khrushchev that any Soviet ship crossing the blockade would be sunk. At the last second, the two 349 World Regional Geography\nleaders resolved this dispute (called the Cuban Missile Crisis) before it erupted into a potential nuclear war.\nKhrushchev recalled the ships and agreed to dismantle the Cuban missile sites. In return, the United States agreed\nnot to invade Cuba and to remove US missiles from sites in Turkey that were aimed at the Soviet Union.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a downturn in Cuba\u2019s economy. With the loss of Soviet aid, the\n1990s were a harsh time for Cubans, a period of transition. Castro turned to tourism and foreign investment to\nshore up his failing economy. Tensions between the United States and Cuba did not improve. In 1996, the United\nStates strengthened the trade embargo with the Helms-Burton Act. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Cuba\nemerged as the lone Communist state in the Americas. Castro was the longest-governing leader of any country\nin the world. He never kept his promises of holding free elections; instead, he cracked down on dissent and\nsuppressed free speech. He turned over power to his brother Ra\u00fal in 2006.\nA Post-Castro Cuba\nWith Fidel Castro no longer in power, Cuba\u2019s future looks more positive but difficult. The island has natural\nresources, a great climate, and an excellent location but is also struggling economically. Cuba has a high literacy\nrate and has standardized health care, though medical supplies are often in short supply. The Cubans who live in\ndire poverty look to the future for relief. Personal freedoms have been marginal, and reforms are slowly taking\nplace in the post-Fidel era. As the largest island in the Caribbean, Cuba has the potential to become an economic\npower for the region. There is vast US interest in regaining US dominance of the Cuban economy, and corporate\ncolonialists would like to exploit Cuba\u2019s economic potential. Keeping corporate colonialism out is what Fidel\u2019s\nsocialist experiment worked so hard to achieve, even at the expense of depriving the Cuban people of civil rights\nand economic reforms.\nCuba today is in transition from a socialist to a more capitalist economy and relies on outside sources for energy\nand food. In 2008, the average wage in Cuba was about twenty dollars per month. There was almost total\nemployment, and everyone was on an equal footing in regard to free health care, education, and housing. At\nthe same time, the underground informal economy was thriving and was pushing the formal economy to make\nchanges. That same year, Ra\u00fal Castro declared that workers with different skills and occupations could earn wages\nat varying levels. Cubans are now allowed to have cell phones and computers, though Internet access has been\nrestricted by the Cuban government. More goods and money are being brought in from Cuban family members\nwho live in the United States. The US government grants general licenses to allow a number of categories of\npeople to travel to Cuba. It is only a matter of time before full travel restrictions are lifted. 5.4 The Caribbean 350\nFigure 5.29 Dump Truck Taxi\nCubans use all available resources and opportunities to get by. These people are catching a ride on a dump truck to get where they\nwant to go.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nCuba is counting on tourism for an added economic boost. With some of the finest beaches and the clearest waters\nin the Caribbean, Cuba is a magnet for tourists and water sports enthusiasts. Its countryside is full of wonders\nand scenic areas. The beautiful Vi\u00f1ales Valley in western Cuba has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite for its outstanding karst landscape and traditional agriculture as well as for its architecture, crafts, and music.\nKarst topography is made up of soluble rock, such as limestone, which in the Vi\u00f1ales Valley results in unusual\nbread loaf\u2013shaped hills that create a scenic landscape attractive for tourism. This region is also one of Cuba\u2019s best\ntobacco-growing areas and has great potential for economic development. Cuba is gearing up for an increase in\ntourism when travel restrictions are lifted by the United States. There is already a focus on improving tourism\nservices to people traveling there from China, Australia, Japan, and other countries. Millions more from the United\nStates are expected to travel to Cuba once the travel restrictions are lifted. The Cuban economy is banking on\ntourism to forge a path to a more prosperous future. 351 World Regional Geography\nFigure 5.30 Vi\u00f1ales Valley in Western Cuba\nIn 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike devastated the tobacco crops, but the region is recovering and is a major tourist area.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\nPopulated for centuries by Amerindian peoples, the island of Puerto Rico was claimed by the Spanish Crown in\n1493, following Columbus\u2019s second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after four hundred years of colonial rule,\nduring which the indigenous population was nearly exterminated and African slave labor was introduced, Puerto\nRico was ceded to the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US\ncitizenship in 1917. Popularly elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted\nproviding for internal self-government. In elections held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, Puerto Rican voters chose to\nretain the commonwealth status, although they were almost evenly split between total independence and becoming\na US state. 5.4 The Caribbean 352\nPuerto Rico is the smallest of the four islands of the Greater Antilles and is only slightly larger than the US state\nof Delaware. Puerto Rico\u2019s population is about four million, similar to the population of Kentucky or Oregon. As\nUS citizens, Puerto Ricans have no travel or employment restrictions anywhere in the United States, and about\none million Puerto Ricans live in New York City alone. The commonwealth arrangement allows Puerto Ricans to\nbe US citizens without paying federal income taxes, but they cannot vote in US presidential elections. The Puerto\nRican Federal Relations Act governs the island and awards it considerable autonomy.\nFigure 5.31 US Government Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with Both US and Puerto Rican Flags\nRafael Torres \u2013 Puerto Rico Capitol Building \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nPuerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean Basin; still, about 60 percent of its\npopulation lives below the poverty line. A diverse industrial sector has far surpassed agriculture as the primary\narea of economic activity. Encouraged by duty-free access to the United States and by tax incentives, US\nfirms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s, even though US minimum wage laws apply. Sugar\nproduction has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the 353 World Regional Geography\nagricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income, with estimated arrivals of more\nthan five million tourists a year. San Juan is the number one port for cruise ships in the Caribbean outside Miami.\nThe US government also subsidizes Puerto Rico\u2019s economy with financial aid.\nThe future of Puerto Rico as a political unit remains unclear. Some in Puerto Rico want total independence, and\nothers would like to become the fifty-first US state; the commonwealth status is a compromise. Puerto Rico is not\nan independent country as a result of colonialism. Many of the islands and colonies in the Caribbean Basin have\nexperienced dynamics similar to Puerto Rico in that they are still under the political jurisdiction of a country that\ncolonized it.\nHispaniola: The Dominican Republic and Haiti\nSharing the island of Hispaniola are the two countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The island became\na possession of Spain under European colonialism after it was visited by Columbus in 1492 and 1493. The\nTiano-Arawak people were nonviolent and welcomed the Europeans, who in turn pressed them into servitude\nand slavery. French buccaneers settled on the western portion of Hispaniola and started growing tobacco and\nagricultural crops. France and Spain finally agreed to divide the island into two colonies: the western side would\nbe French, and the eastern side would be Spanish.\nThe Dominican Republic holds the largest share of Hispaniola. A former Spanish colony, the Dominican Republic\nhas weathered the storms of history to become a relatively stable democratic country. It is not, of course, without\nits problems. The Dominican Republic has long been viewed primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and\ntobacco, but in recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy\u2019s largest employer. The\nmountainous interior and the coastal beaches are attractive to the tourism market, and tourism remains the main\nsource of economic income. The economy is highly dependent on the United States, which is the destination for\nnearly 60 percent of its exports. Remittances from workers in the United States sent back to their families on\nthe island contribute much to the economy. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half\nof the population receives less than one-fifth of the gross domestic product (GDP), while the richest 10 percent\nenjoys nearly 40 percent of GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important long-term\nchallenge. The Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into play in\nMarch 2007, boosting investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment industry. In addition, the\nglobal economic downturn has not helped the Dominican Republic.\nPlantation agriculture thrived in Haiti during the colonial era, producing sugar, coffee, and other cash crops. The 5.4 The Caribbean 354\nlocal labor pool was insufficient to expand plantation operations, so French colonists brought in thousands of\nAfrican slaves to work the plantations, and people of African descent soon outnumbered Europeans. Haiti became\none of the most profitable French colonies in the world with some of the highest sugar production of the time.\nA slave revolt that began in 1792 finally defeated the French forces, and Haiti became an independent country\nin 1804. It was the first country ever to be ruled by former slaves. However, the transition to a fully functional\nfree state was difficult. Racked by corruption and political conflicts, few presidents in the first hundred years ever\nserved a full term in office.\nThe United States occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934 in an attempt to instill a US presence and bring some sense\nof stability. From 1957 to 1986, Dr. Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier and then his son Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d\nDuvalier controlled the government. They created a private army and terrorist death squads known as Tonton\nMacoutes. Many Haitians fled to the United States or Canada, especially to French-speaking Quebec. After the\nDuvalier era, a Catholic priest by the name of Jean-Bertrand Aristide won the presidency through democratic\nelections only to be deposed of by a military coup a few years later. Haiti has had a difficult time finding political\nand economic stability.\nHaiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, and many Haitians live in dire poverty with few\nemployment opportunities. An elite upper-class minority controls the bulk of the nation\u2019s wealth. Many people in\nHaiti have sought comfort in Voodou (Vodoo), a religious practice steeped in African beliefs brought over with the\nslave trade. Often misunderstood by outsiders, Vodou\u2019s its main objective is to bring good health and well-being.\nHaiti\u2019s January 12, 2010, earthquake was a major setback for such a poor country that was already in need of\naid and support. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake, with many aftershocks, struck Haiti about fifteen miles from\nPort-Au-Prince, resulting in as many as two hundred thousand deaths. More than two million were immediately\nhomeless, and about a million more were in need of aid. The lack of building standards in Haiti contributed to the\ncollapse of structures and the devastation. Food and other aid were brought in by many international agencies and\nother countries to address the situation. Efforts continue to address the needs of the Haitian people to stabilize the\nsituation and provide support and future opportunities.\nFigure 5.32 355 World Regional Geography\nUN peacekeeping troops patrol the streets of Port au Prince after Haiti\u2019s 2010 earthquake.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.5.\nJamaica\nThe tropical island of Jamaica is physically smaller than the US state of Connecticut. In 2010, it had a population\nof about 2.8 million. Jamaica was settled by the Spanish early in the sixteenth century. The Taino Indians, who had\ninhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually eradicated and replaced by African slaves. When England seized\nthe island from Spain in 1655, it established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. Two hundred\nyears later (1834), the abolition of slavery freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers.\nJamaica gradually obtained independence from Britain, with full independence achieved in 1962. Sugar, cocoa,\nand coffee production continue on the island, of which more than half is mountainous. The Blue Mountains of\neastern Jamaica are known for their Blue Mountain coffee production. 5.4 The Caribbean 356\nDeteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the\nmajor political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling\nand money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the country.\nNonetheless, many rural and resort compounds remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the tourism\nsector. The beautiful beaches and lush interior make for an attractive destination for cruise ships and other tourists.\nTourism and Economic Activity in the Rimland\nThe physical geography of the Caribbean region makes it a prime location for tourism. Its beautiful coastal waters\nand warm tropical climate draw in tourists from all over North America and the world. Tourism is the number\none means of economic income for many places in the Caribbean Basin, and the tourist industry has experienced\nenormous growth in the last few decades. Tourism is a major component of efforts by leaders of the islands of\nthe Lesser Antilles to achieve economic development for their people. In the last decade, there has been strong\ngrowth in the number of cruise ships operating in the Caribbean. Cruise ships from the southern coasts of the\nUnited States ply their trade around the islands and coastal regions. San Juan receives the largest number of cruise\nship travelers, but other areas well known to tourists include the Bahamas, St. Martin, and the Virgin Islands. Even\nthe poorest country in the Caribbean, Haiti, has tried to attract cruise ships to its ports. The western Caribbean\nitinerary includes the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Mexico or Central American ports. The main restriction on\ncruise ship travel is the hurricane season, from June to November.\nFigure 5.33 Carnival Victory Cruise Ship in San Juan Harbor 357 World Regional Geography\nLarge cruise ships in the Caribbean can hold up to four thousand passengers and crew members. The major cruise lines do not operate\nin the Caribbean during hurricane season.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nOne might reasonably think that the economic benefits of tourism would be entirely positive. However, this is not\nnecessarily the case. Even though tourism has become a vital economic component of the Caribbean Basin, in the\nlong term, tourism creates many problems. Large cruise ships and pleasure crafts can overtax the environment;\nthere have been occasions where there were actually more tourists than citizens on an island. An increase in tourist\nactivity brings with it an increase in environmental pollution.\nMost people in the Caribbean Basin live below the poverty line, and the investment in tourism infrastructure, such\nas exclusive hotels and five-star resorts, takes away resources that could be allocated to schools, roads, medical\nclinics, and housing. However, without the income from tourism, there would be no money for infrastructure.\nTourism attracts people who can afford to travel. Most of the jobs in the hotels, ports, and restaurants where\nwealthy tourists visit employ people from poorer communities at low wages. The disparity between the rich tourist\nand the poor worker creates strong centrifugal cultural dynamics. The gap between the level of affluence and\nthe level of poverty is wide in the Caribbean. In the model of how countries gain wealth, tourism is a mixed-\nprofit situation. Local businesses in the Caribbean do gain income from tourists who spend their money there;\nhowever, the big money is in the cruise ship lines and the resort hotels, which are mainly owned by international\ncorporations or the local wealthy elite.\nThere is little activity in the Caribbean Basin in the manufacturing sector. Although US firms have invested in\nPuerto Rico and the Dominican Republic has experienced growth in light industries and information technologies,\nthe remaining islands have had little industrial growth. Unless an island state has natural resources such as oil or\nminerals, as is the case with Trinidad and Tobago, there are few opportunities other than tourism to bolster the\neconomy. 5.4 The Caribbean 358\nAgricultural products have been traditionally a large part of the economic activity of the islands of the Lesser\nAntilles. Grenada, for example, is known for its nutmeg and other spices. Bananas, sugar, and other fruit and\nfood crops have also been export products. The problem has been that the profit margins on the products are low\nand prices are subject to international markets, which fluctuate widely. With an increasing population and few\nopportunities or advantages, countries such as Haiti suffer from poverty and unemployment. Being an island, there\nare few methods of expanding the economy. People often try to migrate to another county in search of employment\nand a more hopeful future.\nOffshore Banking\nOther methods of gaining wealth in the Caribbean include offshore banking and financial services. Various\nislands have established themselves as banking centers where one can set up financial accounts that are outside\nthe jurisdiction of other countries. These offshore accounts provide tax havens for individuals or corporations\nthat wish to evade taxes in their home countries. Many of these island banking centers do not share account\ninformation with tax agencies or government offices of other countries. Places such as the Cayman Islands have\na worldwide reputation for professional financial services for offshore banking. As a result, the people of the\nCayman Islands have a high standard of living with much national wealth. The Bahamas and the Turks and\nCaicos have also established offshore financial centers, and other Caribbean Islands are working to increase their\nvisibility with similar services. All are hoping to gain income from this low-impact and high-income enterprise.\nThe United States and other countries have made attempts to pressure these islands to share the financial account\ninformation of people evading taxes. If successful, there may be less of an incentive for individuals and businesses\nto use offshore accounts to shelter income from taxes or for those involved in illegal money-laundering schemes\nto hide money in the Caribbean.\nThe wide level of diversity in the Caribbean has not made it easy for outside entities to provide support\nand assistance for common economic goals. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization with\nfifteen Caribbean members established to promote economic integration and cooperation in the region. It hopes\nto coordinate foreign policy for the region and ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared.\nCARICOM is an attempt to compete with other trade organizations such as the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) and CAFTA-DR. 359 World Regional Geography\nCaribbean Music\nThe Caribbean culture includes many varieties of music that have developed on several islands. The region is a\nbreeding ground for innovative music and rhythms that emulate the cultural traditions and attitudes of the people.\nEvery island has its own traditional festivals that include parades, music, and dance. The music scene reveals\nthe uniqueness of the Caribbean. Listening to the myriad of sounds generated from the different islands opens a\nwindow to the assortment of cultural backgrounds found in the Caribbean.\nThe Caribbean is full of local musical variations, and many types of music are found only on a single island or\ntwo. For example, the Dominican Republic has meringue music, Dominica has bouyon, and Haiti has its festive\nrara music.\nThe Cuban influence on music is vividly evident in the spicy salsa tunes that have emanated from the Caribbean\nover the years. African and Spanish cultural influences have helped shape the salsa music that has evolved from\nCuba and neighboring islands of Puerto Rico and the Greater Antilles. With a strong percussion component,\nsnappy brass additions, and rhythmic guitar sections, salsa has become popular throughout many parts of Latin\nAmerica. Other genres of music coming out of Cuba include rumba, habanera, son, and timba, to name a few.\nCalypso music comes from a mix of African influences on the island of Trinidad. Calypso began taking shape at\nthe beginning of the twentieth century and gained popularity through Carnival and other Caribbean festivals. It\nhas evolved to incorporate the steel pan and other musical instruments. A commercial version of calypso became\npopular with Harry Belafonte\u2019s version of the Jamaican folk tune of \u201cDay-O,\u201d known as the \u201cBanana Boat Song\u201d;\nhowever, Belafonte\u2019s 1956 album Calypso had more of a Jamaican mento musical style and he was not from\nTrinidad. Mento is a more folksy rural style of acoustical music that influenced other forms of music such as\nreggae in Jamaica.\nThe pan (steel pan) is the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago, where it was created. The pan was\noriginally made from fifty-five-gallon oil drums. The bottom is cut off at various levels to provide different\nsounds. The top is then shaped into a chromatically pitched percussion instrument. It is struck with a pair of\nstraight sticks. An entire family of pans has been developed and can be assembled into a steel pan orchestra. The\ninstrument has become popular outside the Caribbean as well.\nFigure 5.34 Steel Pans from Trinidad 5.4 The Caribbean 360\nShane K \u2013 Trinidad (68) \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nReggae music started coming out of Jamaica in the 1960s with the music of such artists as Bob Marley and the\nWailers, which featured Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. The rhythmic style with offbeat accents evolved from\nearlier genres to become a standard of Jamaican music. Musicians from the Beatles to Eric Clapton have used\nreggae rhythms. Outside Jamaica, reggae has hit the charts thanks to groups such as UB40. Reggae music has\noften been associated with the Rastafarian movement or Rasta, which is based on a religious ideology including\nthe beliefs that former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie was God incarnate and the biblical Zion was in Africa.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Colonialism created a high level of ethnic, linguistic, and economic diversity in the Caribbean. The main\nshifts were the demise of indigenous groups and the introduction of African slaves. The African influence\ncan be witnessed in the religions of Santeria in Cuba, Vodoo (Voodou) in Haiti, and Rasta in Jamaica.\n\u2022 The Caribbean Basin faces many challenges, including natural elements such as hurricanes, earthquakes,\nand volcanic activity. Economic conditions are often hampered by environmental degradation, corruption,\norganized crime, or the lack of employment opportunities.\n\u2022 The Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro created a socialist state that nationalized foreign-owned assets\nand brought about a trade embargo by the United States. Cuba lost its aid from the Soviet Union after the\nUSSR\u2019s collapse in 1991 and has been increasing its focus on tourism and capitalistic reforms.\n\u2022 Tourism can bring added economic income for an island country, but it also shifts to the service sector\nresources that are needed for infrastructure and services. A high percentage of tourism income goes to\nexternal corporations.\n\u2022 The diversity of the Caribbean is evident in the wide range of musical types generated from the islands.\nIndividual islands are known for certain types of music; salsa, reggae, and calypso are examples. 361 World Regional Geography\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Describe how and why hurricanes form.\n2. Outline why hurricanes have the potential to be so dangerous.\n3. Explain why hurricanes mainly occur in the tropics.\nAbove the oceans just north and south of the equator, a weather phenomenon called a tropical cyclone can develop\nthat can drastically alter the physical and cultural landscape if it reaches land. In the North Atlantic Ocean and the\nCaribbean Sea, this weather pattern is called a hurricane. In the North Pacific Ocean, the same type of weather\npattern is called a typhoon. In the Indian Ocean region and in the South Pacific Ocean, it is called a tropical\ncyclone or just a cyclone. All these storms are considered tropical because they almost always develop between\nthe Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\nFigure 5.35 Cyclones, Hurricanes, and Typhoons and Their Respective Locations around the World\n362 363 World Regional Geography\nHurricanes develop over water that is warmer than 80 \u00baF. As the air heats, it rises rapidly, drawing incoming air\nto replace the rising air and creating strong wind currents and storm conditions. The rapidly rising humid air then\ncools and condenses, resulting in heavy rains and a downdraft of cooler air. The rotation of the earth causes the\nstorm to rotate in a cyclonic pattern. North of the equator, tropical storms rotate in a counterclockwise direction.\nSouth of the equator, tropical storms rotate in a clockwise direction.\nHurricanes start out as tropical depressions: storms with wind speeds between twenty-five and thirty-eight miles\nper hour. Cyclonic motion and warm temperatures feed the system. If a storm reaches sustained winds of thirty-\nnine to seventy-three miles per hour, it is upgraded to a tropical storm. Tropical depressions are numbered; tropical\nstorms are named. When winds reach a sustained speed of seventy-four miles per hour, a storm is classified as a\nhurricane. 5.5 Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) 364\nHurricane Dynamics\nHot air rises. A water temperature of at least 80 \u00baF can sustain rising air in the development of a tropical\ndepression. These storms continue to be driven by the release of the latent heat of condensation, which occurs\nwhen moist air is carried upward and its water vapor condenses. This heat is distributed within the storm to\nenergize it. As the system gains strength, a full-scale hurricane can develop. Rising warm air creates a low-\npressure area that draws in air from the surface. This action pushes water toward the center, creating what is called\na storm surge. Storm surges can average five to twenty feet or more depending on the category of the hurricane.\nCyclonic rotation is created by rotation of the earth in a process called the Coriolis effect. The Coriolis effect is\nless prominent along the equator, so tropical cyclones usually do not develop within five degrees north or south\nof the equator.\nWhen a hurricane makes landfall (comes ashore), the storm surge causes extensive flooding. More people are\nkilled by flooding because of the storm surge than by any other hurricane effect. At the center of the cyclonic\nsystem is the hurricane\u2019s eye, where there is a downdraft of sinking air but the wind is calm and there are no\nclouds. The eye can extend from one to one hundred miles or more. Many people who have been in the eye of the\nhurricane believe the storm has passed, but in reality they are in the center of it.\nBordering the eye of a storm is the eye wall, where the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall are found. This is\nthe most violent part of the hurricane. Beyond the eye wall are feeder bands, with thunderstorms and rain showers\nthat spiral inward toward the eye wall. Feeder bands can extend out for many miles and increase as the heat engine\nfeeds the storm. Hurricanes lose their energy when they move over land because of the lack of heat generation.\nOnce on land, the storm system breaks down. Rainfall and winds can continue, but with decreased intensity.\nFigure 5.36 Dynamics of Hurricane Components 365 World Regional Geography\nCenturies ago, the Spanish used the term hurakan, an indigenous word for \u201cevil spirits\u201d or \u201cdevil wind,\u201d to name\nthe storms that sank their ships in the Caribbean. Hurricanes are rated according to sustained wind speed using the\nSaffir-Simpson Scale. This scale rates a hurricane according to five categories (see Figure 5.37 \u201cSaffir-Simpson\nHurricane Scale\u201d). Category 1 hurricanes have sustained wind speeds of at least seventy-four miles per hour and\ncan inflict heavy damage to buildings, roofs, windows, and the environment. Category 5 hurricanes have sustained\nwinds of more than 155 miles per hour and destroy everything in their paths. Hurricanes can also spawn tornadoes,\nwhich increase their potential for destruction.\nFigure 5.37 Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale 5.5 Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) 366\nAnnually, more than one hundred tropical disturbances develop in the North Atlantic, but only about ten make it to\na tropical storm status and five to six become hurricanes. Only two or three hit the United States in a typical year.\nHurricane season for the North Atlantic lasts from June 1 to November 30. Tropical cyclones develop during the\nwarmest season of the year when the water temperature is the highest. Though these weather patterns can bring\nenormous devastation to the landscape, they also redistribute moisture in the form of rain and help regulate global\ntemperatures.\nThe devastating nature of tropical cyclones is the main concern when forecasting a potential storm. In 1970,\nthe Bholo cyclone hit the coast of Bangladesh, resulting in the death of between three hundred thousand and\none million people. A number of cyclones that killed more than one hundred thousand people each have hit\nBangladesh in the past century. Typhoon Tip in the Northwest Pacific in 1979 is the largest tropical cyclone on\nrecord, with wind speeds of more than 190 miles per hour and a total diameter of more than 1,350 miles\u2014equal to\nthe distance from the Mexican border to the Canadian border in the United States. Typhoons can be, on average,\ntwice the size of hurricanes.\nFigure 5.38 Hurricane Katrina at Various Stages of Its Development across the Gulf of Mexico 367 World Regional Geography\nHurricane Camille was the strongest US hurricane on record at landfall, with sustained winds of 190 miles per\nhour and wind gusts of up to 210 miles per hour. Camille hit the US Mississippi coast in 1969 as a category 5\nhurricane. It devastated everything in its path, killing 259 people. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was one of the most\ncostly storms to impact the United States. Katrina started out as a tropical depression while in the Bahamas. The\nstorm reached a category 5 hurricane as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico but diminished in strength when\nmaking landfall in Louisiana, with sustained winds of 125 miles per hour (a strong category 3 hurricane). Katrina\ncaused widespread devastation along the central Gulf Coast and devastated the city of New Orleans. At least 1,836\npeople lost their lives, and the cleanup cost an estimated $100 billion.\nSince records were started in 1851 for hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin, there have been thirty-two hurricanes that\nreached category 5 in the region. A few of them have reached all the way to the Central American coast. Hurricane\nMitch hit the coast of Central America in 1998 and dumped over seventy-five inches of rain across the countries\nof Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Devastating winds and heavy rain caused the deaths of\nup to twenty thousand people. Destructive category 5 hurricanes Edith and Felix made landfall in Nicaragua in\n1971 and 2007, respectively. The Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the coast of Mexico have also witnessed a number of\ndevastating category 5 hurricanes.\nThe Caribbean Basin is located in the path of many hurricanes developing out of the Cape Verde region of the\nNorth Atlantic. For example, 2008 was a particularly devastating hurricane season, with sixteen tropical storms\nand eight full-scale hurricanes, five of which caused massive devastation. Three category 4 hurricanes (Ike, 5.5 Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) 368\nGustav, and Paloma) cut through the northern Caribbean to hit the Greater Antilles. The most devastating was\nIke, which ripped through the Caribbean, across the entire length of Cuba, and then on to the Gulf Coast of\nLouisiana and Texas. Ike\u2019s immense size contributed to the fact that it was the third most costly hurricane on\nrecord. Ike caused an estimated $7.3 billion in damage to Cuba and more than $29 billion in damage in the United\nStates. Hurricane Gustav made landfall in Hispaniola and Jamaica before increasing in strength and causing about\n$3.1 billion in damage to Cuba. In November of 2008, Hurricane Paloma made landfall in Cuba and caused an\nadditional $300 million in damage to the island. Many of the other Caribbean islands were also devastated by the\nhurricanes that hit the region in 2008.\nFigure 5.39 Direct Path of Hurricane Activity\nThis photo indicates hurricane Gustav and tropical storm Hanna, as well as an existing tropical depression (which became Hurricane\nIke) and a tropical disturbance. Tropical Storm Hanna later developed into a full-scale hurricane.\nMap courtesy of National Hurrican Center. 369 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Tropical cyclones occur in the tropical regions over warm ocean water. In the North Atlantic, they are called\nhurricanes; in the North Pacific, they are called typhoons; and in the Indian Ocean, they are called cyclones.\n\u2022 Hurricanes start as tropical depressions with wind speeds of at least twenty-five miles per hour. As wind\nspeeds increase to thirty-nine miles per hour, the disturbances are called tropical storms and are named.\nWhen wind speeds reach seventy-four miles per hour, they become hurricanes.\n\u2022 Rising air pulls water to the center of the storm, creating a storm surge, the most dangerous feature of the\nstorm because of the immense flooding it can cause when reaching land.\n\u2022 Hurricane season is between June 1 and November 30. Cruise ships do not usually operate in the Caribbean\nduring this time.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. Why do tropical cyclones form near the equator?\n2.

Two types of\ndevelopment patterns emerged with European colonialism. The rimland, with its plantation agriculture,\ndominated the Caribbean and coastal regions. The mainland, with its haciendas, dominated Mexico and\ninterior regions of Central America.\n\u2022 European colonialism decimated the Amerindian population of the Caribbean and conquered the Aztec\nEmpire of the mainland. Colonialism altered the food production, building methods, urbanization, language,\nand religion of the realm.\n\u2022 African slave labor became prominent in the Caribbean and altered the ethnic makeup of most islands.\nAmerindians make up most of the lower working class on the mainland. A minority of wealthy Europeans\ncontinue to be at the top of the socioeconomic class structure. Most of Mexico\u2019s population is of mestizo\nheritage.\n\u2022 Mexico has transitioned from a Spanish colony to a partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement\n(NAFTA). Trade relations have helped industrialize Mexico\u2019s economy and provide employment, especially\nin maquiladoras that thrive in Mexico. Mexico has many natural resources but still struggles to provide\neconomic opportunities for its entire population. Wealth and power is controlled by an elite minority with a\nEuropean heritage.\n\u2022 Various geographic concepts and principles can be applied to this realm: rural-to-urban shift, core-periphery\nspatial relationship, altitudinal zonation, and the impact of climate types on human habitation.\n\u2022 Population growth and the lack of employment opportunities have contributed to the high poverty levels in\nmany areas. There is a wide disparity between the income levels of the wealthy and the poor. Haiti, for\nexample, is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.\n\u2022 The United States has had a major impact on this region, both politically and economically. The US military\nhas intervened in many places to control its interests. US companies have dominated the region\u2019s\neconomies. Most recently, the United States has supported industrial activities and the implementation of\nfree-trade agreements to take advantage of cheap labor.\n\u2022 Earthquakes, volcanoes, and hurricanes continue to bring devastation and destruction to human activity in\nMiddle America. Other environmental issues, such as deforestation and soil degradation, have also become\nserious problems.\n370 371 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 Central America is a diverse and fragmented realm with every country, island, or republic possessing a\ndifferent geography. The varied styles of music that have emerged from the region provide a good example\nof cultural diversity.\n\u2022 Tourism is an important economic sector that has mixed impacts on the local situation. Every part of the\nMiddle American realm has sought to improve their tourism draw to help bolster their economy.\n\u2022 The global economy has prompted the political entities of the region to work more closely together to\nadvance their economic interests. Trade associations such as NAFTA, the Central American-Dominican\nRepublic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are attempts to\ndevelop a greater level of economic integration. Some argue that multinational corporations stand to benefit\nthe most from free-trade agreements.\n\u2022 Tropical cyclones are storms that occur in the tropical regions over warm ocean water. In the North Atlantic,\nwhen wind speeds reach seventy-four miles per hour, they are called hurricanes. Hurricane season is\nbetween June 1 and November 30, and cruise ships do not usually operate in the Caribbean during this time.\nHigh winds and storm surges have caused serious flooding and damage to the human landscape. Chapter 6: South America\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nEuropeans called the Western Hemisphere the New World. South America is the realm consisting of the southern\nportion of the New World. This realm includes the entire continent of South America, which is smaller in physical\narea than North America. As a continent, South America is larger in physical area than Europe, Antarctica, or\nAustralia but is smaller in physical area than Africa or Asia. The South American continent is located farther\neast than North America and is smaller in physical area. Almost the entire landmass of South America lies to the\neast of the same meridian that runs through Miami, Florida. The Atlantic Ocean borders the continent to the east\nand the Pacific Ocean borders the continent on the west. The narrow Isthmus of Panama creates a natural break\nbetween the South American continent and its neighbors to the north. The Caribbean Sea creates the northern\nboundary.\nThe continent covers an extensive range of latitude. The equator cuts through the northern part of the continent\ndirectly through the mouth of the mighty Amazon River. The country of Ecuador is located on the\nequator\u2014hence its name. The equatorial region is dominated by the tropical climates of the immense Amazon\nBasin. The Tropic of Capricorn runs directly through the latitude of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Chile\u2019s Atacama\nDesert, which reveals that most of the continent is in the zone of the tropics to the north. South of the Tropic of\nCapricorn is the Southern Cone of South America, home to the physical regions of the Pampas and Patagonia.\nTierra del Fuego is the southern tip of the realm with territory in both Argentina and Chile. On the south side of\nthe Tierra del Fuego archipelago is Cape Horn, which is considered the southernmost land point of the continent.\nThe Diego Ram\u00edrez Islands south of Cape Horn mark the southern boundary of South America.\nA number of noted island groups are usually affiliated with the physical region of South America. The Galapagos\nIslands are territorially a part of the country of Ecuador. The Falkland Islands, often referred to as the Malvinas,\nare located off the southern coast of Argentina. They are physically associated with South America but are\nadministered and controlled by Great Britain as an overseas territory. Argentina has claimed the Falkland Islands\nand has battled Great Britain for them. Chile controls the noted Easter Island and the Robinson Crusoe Island\nin the Pacific Ocean. Various islands in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean\u2014such as the Dutch islands of Aruba,\nCuracao, and Bonaire\u2014are sometimes associated with South America because of their proximity to the continent.\n372 373 World Regional Geography\nThey are included in Section 5.4 \u201cThe Caribbean\u201d on the Caribbean and are more often associated with Middle\nAmerica.\nFigure 6.1 South America: Political Map of the Countries and Various Physical Regions\nThe main two physical features of South America are the Andes Mountains and the Amazon River. 6.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Summarize the main physical features and characteristics of South America.\n2. Explain how European colonialism dominated the realm and divided up the continent.\n3. Describe the ethnic, economic, and political patterns in the Guianas.\n4. Outline the main cultural realms of South America. Describe each realm\u2019s main ethnic majority and explain\nhow colonialism impacted each region.\n5. Summarize how the South American countries are attempting to integrate their economies.\nThe continent of South America has a wide diversity of physical landscapes, from the high Andes Mountains\nto the tropical forests of the Amazon Basin. This assortment of physical features offers many resource bases,\nallowing people to engage in economic activity, gain wealth, and provide for their needs. The long range of the\nAndes holds mineral riches that have been being extracted since ancient times. Precious metals have been mined\nfrom the mountains to grant great opportunities for those fortunate enough to be recipients of its wealth. Fossil\nfuels have been found in abundance in the far northern regions of Venezuela and Colombia. The Amazon Basin\nhas been a source of hardwood lumber and, more recently, extensive mineral wealth. Some of the largest iron-\nore mines in the world are located here. The massive plains of Brazil and the rich soils of the Pampas allow\nfor enormous agricultural operations that provide food products for the continent and for the world. Even the\ninhospitable Atacama region in northern Chile holds some of the world\u2019s largest copper reserves. In addition, the\nwide variety of climate zones allows a diverse range of species to develop. The extremes in physical geography\nin South America have created both barriers and opportunities to those who live there.\nBefore the era of European colonialism, many local groups organized themselves into states or empires. The\nInca Empire was the largest in existence at the time the Europeans arrived. The early empires developed massive\nstructures that required huge cut stones weighing many tons to be moved into place without the benefit of modern\ntools or technology. European colonialism altered the continent in several ways. Not only did the Europeans\ndefeat and conquer indigenous Amerindian groups such as the Inca, but cultural exchanges also took place that\naltered the way of life for countless South Americans. Colonialism created many of the current country borders\nand influenced trade relationships with the newly created colonies. The plantation system and the introduction\nof slaves from Africa drastically changed the ethnic makeup of the people living along the eastern coast. After\nslavery was abolished, indentured servitude brought workers from Asia to support the labor base.\nIndentured servants were usually poor individuals who agreed to work for an agreed upon period of time, usually\nless than seven years, in return for the necessities of life such as lodging, food, and transportation or clothing.\nThese individuals did not usually receive a salary but may have received a lump sum payment upon completion\nof the agreed upon service. Under favorable conditions indentured servants were treated like relatives and gained\nimportant experience and job skills to provide for their future. Many situations were much less favorable and\n374 375 World Regional Geography\nresembled a form of slavery where individuals did not survive their servitude but succumbed to disease, harsh\nconditions, or death.\nThe physical environment and the influence of colonialism were both responsible for the cultural attributes of\nthe regions of South America. The continent can be divided into regions by ethnic majorities influenced by early\ncolonial development. The mixing of ethnic groups from Europe, Africa, and Asia with each other or with the\nindigenous population has created a diverse cultural mosaic. For example, most people in Guyana and Suriname\nare from Asia, most people in Argentina and Uruguay are from Europe, most people in Peru and Bolivia are\nAmerindian, and most people in many areas along the eastern coast of Brazil are of African descent. A large\npercentage of the population of South America is of a mixed ethnic background. Understanding the cultural\ngeography of South American supports comprehension of the realm\u2019s human development patterns.\nSouth America\u2019s modern economic development has helped integrated it with the global economy. The levels\nof economic development vary widely within the realm. There are clear indications of core-peripheral spatial\npatterns within various regions of the continent, and rural-to-urban shift has been strong in many areas. The\nrural regions in the Andes or the interior suffer from a lack of economic support needed to modernize their\ninfrastructure. At the same time, metropolitan areas are expanding rapidly and are totally integrated with global\nmarkets and the latest technologies. Most of the large cities are located along the coastal regions. This pattern of\nurbanization is mainly a result of colonial activity and influence. The countries of South America are working\namong themselves to network trade and commerce activities. Trade agreements and economic unions have\nbecome standard methods of securing business partnerships to enhance the realm\u2019s economic opportunities.\nPhysical Geography\nThe far-reaching Andes Mountains and the massive Amazon River system dominate South America\u2019s physical\ngeography. The five-thousand-mile-long Andes Mountain chain extends along the entire western region of the\ncontinent from Venezuela to southern Chile. The Andes are the longest mountain chain on Earth and the highest\nin the Americas. The Andes Mountain range has more than thirty peaks that reach at least twenty thousand\nfeet in elevation, many of which are active volcanoes. The Andes has provided isolation to the Inca Empire,\nmineral wealth to those with the means for extraction, and a barrier to travelers crossing the continent. The Andes\u2019\nminerals include gold, silver, tin, and other precious metals. Mining became a major industry in the colonial era\nand continues to the present.\nAt the core of the continent is the mighty Amazon River, which is more than two thousand miles long and has 6.1 Introducing the Realm 376\nan enormous drainage basin in the largest tropical rain forest in the world. The Amazon\u2019s many tributaries are\nlarger than many other world rivers. Flowing parallel to the equator, the Amazon is in contention with the Nile\nas the longest river in the world. In 2007, a dispute arose over the actual length of the Amazon River. Brazilian\nscientists using satellite imagery and teams on the ground using a global positioning system (GPS) calculated a\nnew length for the Amazon. Using similar methods, the Nile River also had a new length calculated. Both were\ndetermined to be longer than originally measured. At this time, the actual length of each river is openly disputed.\nThe most accurate statement is that the Amazon River has the greatest discharge of any river in the world, and it\nis potentially also the longest river in the world.\nThe Amazon carries about a fifth of all river water in the world. The Amazon and its many tributaries drain the\nentire interior region of the continent, covering 40 percent of South America. During the rainy season, the Amazon\nRiver can be more than one hundred miles wide. No bridges span the Amazon River. Its source is a glacial stream\nlocated high in the Peruvian Andes, about 150 miles from the Pacific Ocean.\nThe Amazon\u2019s extended tributaries\u2014such as the Rio Negro, the Madeira, and the Xingu\u2014move massive\namounts of water through the Amazon Basin and are major rivers in their own right. The Amazon has more\nthan 1,100 tributaries; a dozen are more than one thousand miles long. Hydroelectric dams are located on the\ntributaries to produce electricity for the region\u2019s fast-growing development. South America has additional large\nrivers that drain the continent, including the Orinoco, which flows through Venezuela; the Sao Francisco, which\nflows through southeast Brazil; and the Paraguay and the Paran\u00e1 Rivers, which flow south from Brazil into the\nRio de la Plata between Argentina and Uruguay.\nLake Titicaca rests in the middle of the Altiplano Region of the Central Andes on the border between Peru and\nBolivia. The Altiplano Region is a wide basin between two main Andean mountain ranges. The word altiplano\nmeans \u201cvalley\u201d in Spanish. There are a substantial number of altiplanos in South America. They provide for\nagricultural production and human habitation. The Altiplano Region has been home to ancient civilizations that\ndate back to early human settlements. Lake Titicaca is a large freshwater lake about 120 miles long and 50 miles\nwide. The surface is at an elevation of about twelve thousand feet above sea level, and the lake is more than nine\nhundred feet deep in some areas. Usually at such high elevations, the temperature would dip below freezing and\nrestrict agriculture. However, the large lake acts as a solar energy collector by absorbing energy from the sun\nduring the day and giving off that energy in the form of heat during the night. The energy redistribution allows\nfor a moderate temperature around the lake that is conducive to growing food crops. With abundant fresh water\nand the ability to grow food and catch fish, the Altiplano Region has supported human habitation for thousands of\nyears. On the Bolivian side of the lake is the ancient stone site of Tiahuanaco, which has had some artifacts dated\nto 1500 BCE or earlier. People continue to live around and on Lake Titicaca and maintain a subsistence lifestyle. 377 World Regional Geography\nFigure 6.2 Lake Titicaca with Traditional Reed Boat Made by Amerindian Locals\nLake Titicaca is the highest-elevation navigable lake in the world.\nBenedict Adam \u2013 Peru \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAcross the Andes Mountains from the Altiplano Region is the Atacama Desert. The Atacama is one of the driest\nplaces on Earth: in some parts, no rain has fallen in recorded history. In normal circumstances, the Atacama would\nbe a desolate region without human activity, but that is not the case. Some of the world\u2019s largest copper reserves\nare found here. Nitrates, which are used in fertilizers, are also found in large quantities. Mining the Atacama has\nbrought enormous wealth to people fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of the profits. The rain shadow\neffect is responsible for the extraordinary dryness of the Atacama. The Andes are quite high at this latitude, and\nthe winds blow in rain clouds from the east. When the clouds reach the mountains, they ascend in elevation,\nreleasing their precipitation without ever reaching the western side of the Andes.\nSouth America has large agricultural plateaus east of the Andes, such as the Mato Grosso Plateau, which\nincludes a portion of the great cerrado agricultural region of central Brazil. The Cerrado is a vast plain that\nhas been developed for agriculture and produces enormous harvests of soybeans and grain crops. Bordering the\nCerrado to the southeast are the Brazilian Highlands, an extensive coffee-growing region. The Pampas in eastern\nArgentina, Uruguay, and southernmost Brazil is another excellent agricultural region with good soils and adequate\nrainfall. Farming, cattle ranching, and even vineyards can be found here, making the Pampas the breadbasket of\nthe Southern Cone. To the south of the Pampas is the lengthy expanse of Patagonia, which covers the southern\nportion of Argentina east of the Andes. Patagonia is a prairie grassland region that does not receive a very much\nrainfall because of the rain shadow effect of the Andes to the west. The main activities in Patagonia are the raising\nof cattle and other livestock. The region is starting to attract attention for the extraction of natural resources such\nas oil, natural gas, and valuable minerals. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 378\nTo the northern part of the continent in Venezuela and Colombia, sandwiched between the Andes Mountains\nand the Guiana Highlands, is a grassland region with scrub forests called the Llanos. The human population is\nsmall because of the remoteness of the region along the Orinoco River basin. The Guiana Highlands of southeast\nVenezuela and the Guianas are an isolated set of mountainous plateaus mixed with rugged landscapes and tropical\nclimates. Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world, with a free fall of more than 2,647 feet and a total drop of\nabout 3,212 feet (more than half a mile), is located here. To the northwest of the Llanos and the Guiana Highlands\nin Venezuela is Lake Maracaibo, a large inland lake open to the Caribbean Sea. A coastal lake, Maracaibo rests\natop vast oil reserves that provide economic wealth for Venezuela.\nEuropean Colonialism\nSouth America\u2019s colonial legacy shaped its early cultural landscape. The indigenous people, with their empires\nand local groups, were no match for the Iberian invaders who brought European colonialism to the continent.\nSouth America was colonized exclusively by two main Iberian powers: Spain colonized the western part of the\nSouth America, and Portugal colonized the east coast of what is present-day Brazil. The only region that was not\ncolonized by those two powers was the small region of the Guianas, which was colonized by Great Britain, the\nNetherlands, and France.\nFigure 6.3 Colonial Activity in South America 379 World Regional Geography\nEverything changed with the invasion of the Iberian colonizers. The underlying tenets of culture, religion, and\neconomics of the local indigenous people were disrupted and forced to change. It is no mystery why the two\ndominant languages of South America are Spanish and Portuguese and why Roman Catholicism is the realm\u2019s\ndominant religion. Colonialism also was responsible for transporting food crops such as the potato, which\noriginated in the Peruvian Andes, to the European dinner table. Today, coffee is a main export of Colombia, Brazil,\nand other countries in the tropics. Coffee was not native to South America but originated in Ethiopia and was\ntransferred by colonial activity. The same is true of sugarcane, bananas, and citrus fruits; oranges were not native\nto South America, but today Brazil is the number one exporter of orange juice. Colonialism was driven by the\ndesire for profit from the quick sale of products such as gold or silver, and there was a ready market for goods not\nfound in Europe, such as tobacco, corn, exotic animals, and tropical woods. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 380\nPlantation agriculture introduced by the Europeans led to a high demand for manual laborers. When the local\npopulations could not meet the labor demand, millions of African workers were brought through the slave trade.\nThese African slaves introduced their own unique customs and traditions, altering the culture and demographics\nof the Western Hemisphere. The current indigenous Amerindian population, a fraction of what it was before the\nEuropeans arrived, makes up only a small percentage of South America\u2019s total population. Europeans colonizers\ngenerally took the best land and controlled the economic trade of the region. The acculturation in South America\nis directly related to the European colonial experience.\nThe Inca Empire and Francisco Pizarro\nNot long after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztec Empire of Mexico in 1521, a young Spanish conquistador\nnamed Francisco Pizarro, stationed in what is now Panama, heard rumors of silver and gold found among the\nSouth American people. He led several sailing excursions along the west coast of South America. In 1531 CE, he\nfounded the port city of Lima, Peru. Since 1200 CE, the Inca had ruled a large empire extending out from central\nPeru, which included the high-elevation Altiplano Region around Lake Titicaca. The Inca Empire dominated an\narea from Ecuador to Northern Chile. The Inca were not the most populous people but were a ruling class who\ncontrolled other subjugated groups. Pizarro, with fewer than two hundred men and two dozen horses, met up with\nthe Inca armies and managed to defeat them in a series of military maneuvers. The Inca leader was captured by\nthe Spanish in 1533. Two years later, in 1535, the Inca Empire collapsed.\nFigure 6.4 Colonialism in South America 381 World Regional Geography\nThe two main colonizers in South America were Spain and Portugal. The Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca\nEmpire.\nThe Inca Empire was significant thanks to the high volume of gold and silver found in that region of the Andes.\nThe story is told that Pizarro placed the captured Inca leader in a small room and told him that if the room was\nfilled with gold to the top of the Inca leader\u2019s head, Pizarro would let the Inca leader go free. Gold was summoned\nfrom the people and the countryside, and the room was filled. The conquistadors forced the Inca leader to convert\nto Catholicism and be baptized and then killed him. The gold was melted down and transported back to Spain.\nThe mineral wealth of the Andes made the conquistadors rich. Lima was once one of the wealthiest cities in the\nworld. Europeans continued to dominate and exploit the mining of minerals in Peru and Bolivia throughout the\ncolonial era. European elites or a Mestizo ruling class has dominated or controlled the local Amerindian groups\nin the Andes since colonial times.\nFigure 6.5 The Jesuit Church of La Compa\u00f1ia de Jes\u00fas on the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco, Peru 6.1 Introducing the Realm 382\nThe original church was constructed in 1571 on the site of the ancient Incan palace. The earthquake of 1650 caused severe damage\nto the building, so it had to be reconstructed in about 1688. Many Catholic cathedrals in Latin America were built with stones from\nancient sites. This cathedral is claimed to be the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most ideal example of colonial baroque architecture.\nJames Preston \u2013 La Compania de Jesus, Cusco \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nMany Amerindian groups inhabited this region before the Inca Empire, such as the people who built and lived\nin the ancient city of Tiahuanaco, which could have bordered Lake Titicaca during an earlier climate period,\nwhen the lake was much larger. Clearly, humans have lived in South America for thousands of years. There is\nspeculation that travel between South America and the Mediterranean region occurred earlier than current historic\nrecords indicate. Many of the ruins in the western region of South America have not been thoroughly excavated\nor examined by archaeologists, and the size and scope of many of the stone structures stand as testimony to the\nadvancements in engineering and technology employed in an era that, according to historical records, had only\nprimitive tools. 383 World Regional Geography\nThe Iberian Division of the Continent\nThe Spanish conquistadors were not the only European invaders to colonize South America. Colonial\ninfluence\u2014which forced a change in languages, religion, and economics\u2014also came from the small European\nkingdom of Portugal. Portuguese ships sailed along the eastern coast of South America and laid claim to the region\nfor the king. The Portuguese did not find large gold or silver reserves, but they coveted the land for the expansion\nof their empire. Soon the Spanish and the Portuguese were fighting over the same parts of South America. In\n1494, the issue was brought before the Roman Catholic Church. The Tordesillas Line was drawn on a map to\ndivide South America into the Spanish west and the Portuguese east. The region that is now Brazil became the\nlargest Portuguese colonial possession in South America, a center for plantation agriculture similar to that in the\nCaribbean. For this reason, a large African population lives in Brazil, and most of the people in Brazil speak\nPortuguese and are Roman Catholics.\nIndependence did not come for the Spanish colonies until 1816 and 1818, when Chile and Argentina broke away\nin an independence movement in the south. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar led liberation movements in the north. By 1824, the\nSpanish were defeated in South America. Brazil did not gain independence from Portugal until 1822, when the\nprince of Portugal declared an independent Brazil and made himself Brazil\u2019s first emperor. It was not until 1889\nthat a true republic was declared and empire was abolished.\nColonialism and the Guianas\nThe Guianas in the northeast were the only European colonies in South America that were not under Spanish or\nPortuguese control. The British, Dutch, and French all held claims to different parts of the Guianas. French Guiana\nremains a colony (department) of France to this day. The transition from colony to independent state has required\npersistence, time, and patience. Guyana and Suriname only just received their independence in the latter part of\nthe twentieth century. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 384\nFigure 6.6 The Guianas of South America\nThe coastal location of the Guianas provided European colonialists with an excellent site for plantation\nagriculture. Coastal cities had easy access to the Atlantic trade system. The active slave trade in the Atlantic\nbrought African slaves to the Guianas to work the plantations. When slavery was abolished, indentured servants\nwere brought in from other parts of the world that were colonized by the same European powers. Colonialism\nand plantation agriculture entirely changed the cultural dynamics of the Guianas. Port cities along the coast are\nthe dominant urban centers. The Guianas follow a pattern similar to that of the rimland of the Caribbean and are\nincluded with the Caribbean in many studies. At the present time, bauxite (aluminum ore) mining and oil deposits\nalong the coast provide modest income, and many people make their living in subsistence agriculture.\nGuyana\nGuyana and its neighbors have a tropical type A climate. The main interior regions are covered with dense forests.\nSome deforestation has taken place in Guyana; even so, forests cover more than 80 percent of Guyana\u2019s land area\nwith a diverse range of forests, ranging from dry evergreen forests to tropical rain forests, and with thousands of 385 World Regional Geography\nspecies of plants that are only found in this region. Guyana\u2019s natural habitats and biodiversity are unparalleled,\nwhich is attributable to the climate, distinctive landforms, and largely well-preserved ecosystems. Its large rain\nforests play host to a myriad of species not found elsewhere. The interior regions remain more than 70 percent\npristine, but this will change if logging, mining, and deforestation are not managed appropriately.\nGuyana was called British Guiana before it became independent in 1966. The region was home to Carib and\nArawak groups before the arrival of the Dutch, who established the first colony there in 1616. By 1831, the British\nhad taken control and declared the colony British Guiana. African slaves were the main source of plantation labor\nuntil slavery was abolished in 1834. At that point, indentured servants from many countries were targeted for\nlabor; most were East Indians from South Asia. There were also thousands of servants from China and other\ncountries.\nThe ethnic background of Guyana\u2019s population, which is less than one million, is a mix of African (36 percent),\nEast Indian (50 percent), and Amerindian (7 percent). The remainder are mixed and European. The religious\nbackground of the East Indians includes both Hindus and Muslims. About 50 percent of the population has\nconverted to Christianity. Ethnic divisions create difficulties in organizing politics and social activities. For\nexample, one political concern is that minority groups with greater economic advantages will dominate the\npolitical arena without regard to the wishes of other ethnic groups.\nMost of Guyana\u2019s people live in the coastal regions. The almost impenetrable interior has large uninhabited\nareas with dense tropical forests. To protect its unique biodiversity, large areas have been placed in conservation\nareas and national parks. More than one million acres have been placed in the Konashen Community-Owned\nConservation Area (COCA) to help preserve the natural environment and provide a sustainable economic\nrelationship with local Waiwai people. In a similar effort, the government created the Kaieteur National Park,\nwhich features the spectacular Kaieteur Falls, which is about five times higher than Niagara Falls in North\nAmerica. For its size, the falls has an enormous amount of water volume flowing over its crest. Other areas of the\nGuyana are also being considered for preservation.\nFigure 6.7 Kaieteur Falls, Guyana 6.1 Introducing the Realm 386\nKaieteur Falls has the largest single-drop waterfall by volume in the world. A national park has been created in this area to include\nthe falls.\nPaul Arps \u2013 Kaietur falls from a distance (Guyana 2001) \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nGuyana\u2019s economy is based on agricultural activities and the export of extracted natural resources. Sugarcane is\na main cash crop, and timber sales are increasing. Fishing is common in the coastal areas. Bauxite mining has\nbeen the main mining activity, and mining of gold and other minerals has only advanced in recent years. Guyana\u2019s\neconomy is similar to that of many islands of the Caribbean, a relationship exemplified by its membership in\nCARICOM (the Caribbean Community). CARICOM\u2019s headquarters is located in Georgetown, the capital of\nGuyana.\nSuriname\nSuriname\u2019s colonial name was Dutch Guiana. The name was changed when independence was granted in 1975.\nThe cultural background of the colony is as diverse as its history. Dutch Guiana was divided between British\nand Dutch colonists. Slavery and plantation agriculture were introduced in the colonial period, and the harsh\nconditions of slavery caused many slaves to escape the plantations and live in the forests. These runaway slaves,\ncalled Maroons, eventually organized into viable independent groups. Peace treaties were finally made with the 387 World Regional Geography\nMaroons to grant them legitimate rights. After slavery was abolished, indentured servants from South Asia and\nthe Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) were conscripted into the colony\u2019s labor base.\nMost of the half-million people who live in Suriname today reside along the coast. The ethnic background of\nthe people includes East Indian (37 percent), Creole (31 percent), Indonesian (15 percent), African (10 percent),\nAmerindian (2 percent), Chinese (2 percent), and European (about 1 percent). All three of the Guianas are\nethnically diverse, and in this setting, the diversity creates tensions related to social and economic stability.\nGuyana and Suriname are the least Latin regions of South America; the Creoles, for example, are mainly a mix of\nAfrican and Dutch mixed with Asian or Amerindian. Establishing a stable government and conducting civil affairs\nare often complicated by the ethnic groups that vie for power and political control. The religious background in\nSuriname includes Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and a mix of African religions such as Winti.\nFigure 6.8 Ethnic Groups of Suriname by Percentage of the Population\nData courtesy of CIA World Factbook 2010.\nSuriname depends on agriculture and natural resources as its two main economic activities. Suriname has the\nsmallest physical area of all the independent South American states, and it has a limited ability to provide\nopportunities and advantages for its growing population. Bauxite is the country\u2019s main export product. In 1941,\nduring World War II, the United States occupied the country to secure the valuable bauxite mines that were critical\nto the war effort. Suriname has also been expanding its gold mining, oil extraction, logging, and fishing industries.\nTo protect its natural environment and its extensive biodiversity, the country has established national parks and\ncreated the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve, which UNESCO has named a World Heritage Site. Suriname\nhopes to benefit from these measures to create an ecotourism market. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 388\nBoth Guyana and Suriname have had border disputes with their neighbors. Guyana has been locked in a challenge\nwith Venezuela over its western region, which Venezuela claimed during the colonial era. A 1905 treaty ruled in\nGuyana\u2019s favor, but a small portion is still under dispute. The corner of Surname that borders Brazil and Guyana\nhas been an issue of contention fueled by the potential for mining of gold and other minerals in the area. The\nmaritime boundary between Suriname and Guyana is also a point of contention. Suriname\u2019s border with French\nGuiana has a disputed area along the southern corner next to Brazil. These disputes emerged out of colonial\nagreements and poorly defined treaty boundaries.\nFrench Guiana\nFrench Guiana is still a colony (department) of France. With fewer than 250,000 people in an area slightly smaller\nthan Kentucky, this is a sparsely inhabited area. Half the population lives in the capital city of Cayenne. Most of\nthe population is Creole, mainly a combination of African and French with various Asian groups mixed in. The\npeople work in subsistence agriculture or for the French government. A noted feature of the colony\u2019s heritage is\nthe former off-shore prison on Devil\u2019s Island, which France used to secure its most undesirable prisoners. More\nthan fifty thousand French prisoners were delivered to the Devil\u2019s Island facility during the colonial era, but less\nthan 10 percent survived. The prison was closed in 1951.\nFigure 6.9 The Ariane 42P Carrying the TOPEX\/Poseidon Spacecraft 389 World Regional Geography\nThis Ariane 42P was launched from the European Space Agency\u2019s Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, on August 10,\n1992.\nPhoto courtesy of NASA \u2013 public domain.\nThe European Space Agency maintains a launch center in French Guiana because of its favorable climate\nand launch conditions. France maintains the facility and has highly subsidized the department\u2019s economy. This\nEuropean support provides the population with a higher standard of living than in many other South American\ncountries. Economic activities have included fishing, agriculture (bananas and sugar), and logging. Deforestation\nfrom the sale of hardwood lumber has become a problem throughout the Guianas as it leaves the soil open for 6.1 Introducing the Realm 390\nerosion. Logging endangers the area\u2019s fragile but extensive biodiversity. Roads, dams, and gold mining have also\ncontributed to the erosive destruction of the environment.\nCultural Regions of South America\nIt is impossible to understand the current conditions in South America without first understanding what occurred\nto create those conditions. This is why studying European colonialism is so important. Colonialism changed the\nethnicity, religion, language, and economic activities of the people in South America. The past five hundred years\nhave tempered, stretched, and molded the current states and regions of the South American continent. To identify\nstandards of living, ethnic majorities, and economic conditions, it is helpful to map out South America\u2019s various\ncultural regions.\nIn South America, five main cultural regions indicate the majority ethnic groups and the main economic activities:\n1. Tropical Plantation Region\n2. Rural Amerindian Region\n3. Amazon Basin\n4. Mixed Mestizo Region\n5. European Commercial Region (Southern Cone)\nFigure 6.10 Cultural Spheres of South America. 391 World Regional Geography\nThese are generalized regions that provide a basic understanding of the whole continent. Technological\nadvancements and globalization have increased the integration of the continent to the point that these regions are\nnot as delineated as they once were, but they still provide a context in which to comprehend the ethnic and cultural\ndifferences that exist within the realm. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 392\nTropical Plantation Region\nFigure 6.11 Young Women in Salvador, Brazil 393 World Regional Geography\nSalvador, Brazil, is located along the coastal region of South America where the Tropical Plantation Region was prominent. Most\npeople in this region are of African descent.\nCarnal.com Studios \u2013 Salvador Carnaval Comanches 03 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nLocated along the north and east coast of South America, the Tropical Plantation Region resembles the Caribbean\nrimland in its culture and economic activity. The region, which extends as far south as the Tropic of Capricorn, has\na tropical climate and an agricultural economy. Europeans opened up this area for plantation agriculture because\nof coastal access for ships and trade. The local people were forced into slavery, but when the local people died off\nor escaped, millions of African slaves were brought in to replace them. After slavery was abolished, indentured\nservants from Asia were brought to the Guianas to work the plantations. The Tropical Plantation Region has a\nhigh percentage of people of African or Asian descent. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 394\nRural Amerindian Region\nFigure 6.12 Amerindians\nThe Amerindian woman and child in this photo live in the Sacred Valley of the Andes in Peru.\nThomas Quine \u2013 Mother and Child \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Rural Amerindian Region includes the countries of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The ruling Mestizo class\nthat inherited control from the European conquistadors mainly lives in urban areas. Most of the rural Amerindian\npopulation lives in mountainous areas with type H climates and ekes out a hard living in subsistence agriculture.\nThis is one of the poorest regions of South America, and land and politics are controlled by powerful elites. The\nextraction of gold and silver has not benefited the local Amerindian majority, which holds to local customs and\nspeaks local languages. 395 World Regional Geography\nAmazon Basin\nThe Amazon Basin, which is characterized by a type A climate, is the least-densely populated region of South\nAmerica and is home to isolated Amerindian groups. Development has encroached upon the region in the forms\nof deforestation, mining, and cattle ranching. Large deposits of iron ore, along with gold and other minerals, have\nbeen found in the Amazon Basin. Preservation of the tropical rain forest of this remote region has been hampered\nby the destructive pattern of development that has pushed into the region. The future of the basin is unclear\nbecause of development patterns that are expected to continue as Brazil seeks to exploit its interior peripheral\nregion. Conflicts over land claims and the autonomy of Amerindian groups are on the rise.\nFigure 6.13 Amazon River Drainage Basin\nThe Amazon has more than 1,100 tributaries.\nImage courtesy of NASA \u2013 public domain. 6.1 Introducing the Realm 396\nMixed Mestizo Region\nThe Mixed Mestizo Region includes the coastal area of the west and the interior highlands of the north and east.\nThis region between the Tropical Plantation Region and the Rural Amerindian Region includes a majority of\npeople who share a mixed European and Amerindian ethnicity. It is not as poor as the Rural Amerindian Region\nand yet not as wealthy as the European-dominated region to the south. Paraguay falls into the Mixed Mestizo\nRegion, as do other portions of other South American countries such as parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.\nParaguay is mainly Mestizo, but its economic qualities resemble that of the Rural Amerindian Region to the north,\neven though Paraguay is not located in the mountains.\nEuropean Commercial Region (Southern Cone)\nThe southern part of South America, called the European Commercial Region or the Southern Cone, includes\nChile, Argentina, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil. European ethnic groups dominate this region and include not only\nSpanish and Portuguese but also German, Austrian, Italian, and other European ethnic heritages. Fertile soils and\nEuropean trade provided early economic growth, and the region attracted industry and manufacturing in the later\ndecades of the twentieth century. There are not many Amerindians or people of African descent here. More than\n90 percent of all the people in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are of European descent and live in urban areas.\nWith a highly urbanized population and with trade connections to a globalized economy, it is no surprise that the\nSouthern Cone is home to South America\u2019s most developed economies. 397 World Regional Geography\nGlobalization and Trade\nSouth America has been fragmented by European colonialism, which established colonies and economic\ndependence on its European masters. The colonial economic patterns did not encourage the South American\ncountries to work together to create an integrated continental trade network. Countries outside the continent\nhave promoted trade partnerships to benefit from South America\u2019s natural resources and agricultural exports.\nThe establishment of the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) created\nglobalized trading blocs that challenged the South American countries to consider how to take advantage of\ntrading opportunities within their realm to protect and support their own economic interests.\nSince the 1990s, cooperation and business ventures have started to form within the realm to create a more\nintegrated network of trade and commerce to benefit the countries of South America. Transportation and\ncommunication systems are being developed through joint ventures by internal investment groups. River and\nroad systems continue to be managed and developed for improved transport of people and goods throughout the\ncontinent. Free-trade agreements have been implemented to support the integration of internal economic networks\nand competition in the global marketplace.\nIn 2008, the South American countries formed the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) to oversee\nthe customs unions and trade agreements within the realm. One of the more established trade associations is\nMercosur (the Southern Cone Common Market), created in 1995 by the southern countries. It has evolved to\ninclude most countries in South America and is the most dominant trade agreement in the realm. Full members\nof Mercosur include Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia\nare associate members. As of 2011, Venezuela\u2019s membership was under review. The Andean Community\n(Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) was established in 1969 but did not gain ground until 1995, when it\nestablished stronger trade measures. Multinational corporations have supported the creation of a Free Trade Area\nof the Americas (FTAA) to include all of the Western Hemisphere in one unified trade association. It has not been\napproved and has received strong opposition from Mercosur and economic forces that support a more localized\neconomy controlled by local people.\nSouth America faced division and competition during the colonial era between the Spanish and the Portuguese.\nToday\u2019s new era of corporate colonialism has created similar fragmentation and divisions. The level of trade\nbetween the countries of South America and the United States and Europe varies widely. Countries such\nas Colombia and Chile have well-established trade relationships with the United States and are unwilling to\njeopardize those trade connections to strengthen ties with their neighbors that have less-supportive political\nrelationships with the United States. External global trade arrangements often provide financial benefits to\nindividual countries that might not be shared by the bordering countries in the same region. South America\u2019s\nhistorical fragmentation has not made it easy to unify the continent under a singular trade agreement to complete\nagainst the European Union or NAFTA.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The extensive Andes Mountain chain and the massive Amazon River dominate the realm\u2019s physical 6.1 Introducing the Realm 398\ngeography.\n\u2022 The Spanish and the Portuguese were the two main colonial powers that dominated South America. The\nGuianas were the only part of the continent not dominated by these two European powers.\n\u2022 Britain, Holland, and France formed colonies in the Guianas. The slave trade brought many people of\nAfrican descent to the Guiana colonies. After slavery was abolished, indentured servants from Asia were\nbrought to the Guianas to support the labor base.\n\u2022 Identifying the majority ethnic groups in South America can be helpful in classifying the various cultural\nregions of the realm. Colonial activities and ethnic backgrounds are consistent enough to formulate regions\nwith similar characteristics.\n\u2022 Globalization and the creation of economic or political units such as the European Union and NAFTA have\nprompted the South American countries to work together to implement cooperative trade agreements and\ncreate the Union of South American Nations.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Outline how Paraguay\u2019s geographical setting has allowed it to gain wealth and provide opportunities for its\npeople.\nVenezuela: Oil, Politics, and Globalization\nBordering the Caribbean is the large urban country of Venezuela. The Andes Mountains reach into the northern\npart of the country and make up the terrain of the northern coastal region all the way to the capital city of\nCaracas. The large grassland plains of the Llanos extend farther south from the Colombian border to the Orinoco\nRiver delta. The Llanos is a large, sparsely populated region that makes up about one-third of the country. It\nis remote, susceptible to flooding, and used mainly for raising cattle. In the southeast of Venezuela are the\nGuiana Highlands, which make for a spectacular physical landscape of tropical forests and rugged mountainous\nterrain. The highlands include Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world. Angel Falls drops 2,647 feet and is\nVenezuela\u2019s most popular tourist attraction. Lake Maracaibo, a large inland sea located in the western region of\nthe country, is not a true lake in that it is open to the Caribbean Sea, but it is considered the largest inland body of\nwater in South America. Lake Titicaca, located in the Andean region of the Altiplano on the border between Peru\nand Bolivia, is considered the continent\u2019s largest freshwater lake.\n400 401 World Regional Geography\nFigure 6.14 Northern South America and Venezuela\nNotice that most of the main cities are located along the northern coast.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nFigure 6.15 Angel Falls, Venezuela 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 402\nThe total falls is estimated at 3,212 feet; the largest free fall is estimated to be about 2,647 feet\u2014about half a mile. Angel Falls is the\ncountry\u2019s number one tourist attraction.\nInti \u2013 El Sato Angel \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nVenezuela has an assortment of physical regions, but most of the population lives along the northern coast. About 403 World Regional Geography\n90 percent live in urban areas, and the capital Caracas has the highest population. Less than 5 percent of the\npopulation lives south of the Orinoco River, and Amerindian groups live in the interior and along the river.\nIncluded in the Mixed Mestizo Cultural Region, Venezuela has a heavy Spanish influence laid over an Amerindian\nbase in a plantation region known for its African infusion. There is also a strong Caribbean cultural flavor, which\nis evident in the region\u2019s music and lifestyle. The official language is Spanish, but more than thirty indigenous\nlanguages are still spoken in the country.\nVenezuela gained its independence from Spain in 1821 and has developed into an urban country with an economy\nbased on oil production. A large extent of the interior is undeveloped. Venezuela does not have extensively\ndeveloped agricultural production, so most food goods are imported. Lake Maracaibo has vast oil reserves beneath\nit that have provided substantial wealth to the country.\nAs much as 90 percent of Venezuela\u2019s export earnings are from the export of oil. Venezuela\u2019s national oil\ncompany, CITGO, has made extensive inroads into the US gas station market. The country was one of the\nfounding members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), which is usually associated with\nthe oil-rich states of the Persian Gulf. In the past decade, Venezuela has been one of the top five countries\nexporting oil to the United States. The other four are Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria.\nAs is the case with many countries, national wealth in Venezuela does not filter down to most of the population.\nThe wealthy elite who have benefited the most from the nation\u2019s wealth often find themselves on the opposite\nside of the political debate from the majority, who are likely to live in poor conditions. Caracas has many upscale\nneighborhoods, but it also has a large number of slums on the outskirts of the city. Slums in South America go by\ndifferent names, such as barrios in Venezuela or favelas in Brazil. Many of Venezuela\u2019s barrios are built on the\nmountainsides of the Andes.\nFigure 6.16 The Two Sides of Caracas, the Capital City of Venezuela 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 404\nThe photo on the left is of the main urban core, with upscale neighborhoods. The photo on the right is a barrio located on a steep\nmountainside. Barrios are usually self-constructed slum areas and are similar to favelas in Brazil.\nCrist\u00f3bal Alvarado Minic \u2013 Vista de Caracas \u2013 CC BY 2.0; Danila Medvedev \u2013 A tunnel and barrios surrounding it on the hill \u2013 CC\nBY 2.0.\nExporting oil to the United States does not inherently lead to a friendly political relationship between the United\nStates and Venezuela. There has been some political unrest within the country related to the current president,\nHugo Chavez, holding continuous terms in office without term limits. President Chavez has held close ties with\nsocialist Cuba and with the Castro regime and has made somewhat antagonistic statements about the world\u2019s\ncore economic countries. From time to time, his rhetoric and his positions are not geared toward enhancing the\ncountry\u2019s political relationship with the United States. This situation has caused concern within the US political\nestablishment with regard to the position that the United States takes toward Venezuela. Nevertheless, the United\nStates remains Venezuela\u2019s number one trading partner in both imports and exports.\nPolitics in Venezuela often plays the wealthy elites against the poorer majority, and President Chavez has not been\nan exception. Chavez has supported socialist political leaders from other Latin American states and has pushed a\nglobalization agenda along the same lines. The country\u2019s enormous oil revenues and its current political climate\nhave increased Venezuela\u2019s visibility in the global arena, but how this will play out over the long term is unclear.\nIn the past, Latin America has had a greater number of elected political leaders with more progressive or socialist\nviews. These trends continue to shape the economic trade agreements between countries. Venezuela has been\nworking to increase sales of oil to countries in Mercosur (the Southern Cone Common Market), which is the most\nsignificant trade association in South America.\nGlobalization is also evident in Venezuela\u2019s cultural and social dynamics. In many Latin American countries,\nsoccer (European football) is the most popular sport, but Venezuela\u2019s biggest sport is baseball because of the\ninfluence of early US activity in the country\u2019s oil industry. Soccer is gaining attention and support, however.\nOrchestras and classical music performances have also gained notoriety in recent years. Concert halls from\nthe Americas to Europe have experienced the performances of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra. The Miss\nVenezuela pageant is a major production for the country, and Venezuela has won the top title at least five times in\neach of the following pageants: Miss World, Miss Universe, and Miss International. 405 World Regional Geography\nColombia: Drugs, Coffee, and Oil\nThree ranges of the Andes Mountains run from north to south through Colombia, which is larger than the nine\nmost southeastern US states. With a land area covering about 440,839 square miles, Colombia is more than ten\ntimes larger than the US state of Kentucky and close to twice the size of France. Colombia borders five countries,\nwith the Caribbean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Orinoco River to the east, and a short segment\nof the Amazon River to the far south. Even though agriculture has been a mainstay of the country\u2019s economic\nactivities, because of the influence of the mountainous terrain, about 75 percent of the population lives in urban\nareas.\nFigure 6.17 Physical Size of Colombia: 440,839 Square Miles\nColombia was a Spanish colony during the time that Spain controlled most of western South America. Colombia\nbecame independent in 1819. The region of Panama, which was first a part of Colombia, broke away in 1903 when\nthe United States backed Panama\u2019s independence movement. After Colombia became independent of Spain, the 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 406\nconservatives (wealthy elite) and the liberals (poor workers) struggled to gain control of the government. Since\n1948, the conflict, known as La Violencia, has caused more than two hundred thousand casualties. During the\ntwentieth century the government in Colombia has not always been peaceful or stable. By the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century the government has become more unified and the country has even witnessed an increase in\ntourism.\nColombia and the Drug Trade\nColombia\u2019s tropical climate and its many remote areas contributed to its development as a major coca-growing\nregion. By the 1970s, extensive drug smuggling had developed, and powerful drug cartels became major political\nbrokers within the country, competing against the government for control of Colombia. The largest and most\norganized cartels operated out of Medellin and Cali, the second- and third-largest cities in the country after the\ncapital city of Bogot\u00e1.\nThe coca plant grows throughout the slopes of the Andes, from Colombia to Bolivia. Historically, locals have\nchewed it or brewed it into tea. Coca can alleviate elevation sickness and act as a mild stimulant. Using\nmodern methods and strong chemicals, the coca leaves can be converted into coca paste and then into cocaine\nhydrochloride, a powerful narcotic. It often takes up to a ton of such chemicals as sulfuric acid, kerosene, methyl\nalcohol, and additional substitutes to produce a kilo of cocaine. Once the process is completed, most of the\nchemicals are discarded and frequently find their way into nearby rivers and streams, which are the same water\nsupplies that local people drink, clean with, and bathe in. Birth defects have become a problem in coca-growing\nregions because of the high levels of chemical pollution in water supplies.\nIt must be noted that the short, leafy coca plant that cocaine comes from is not the same as the cacao tree that produces\nthe beans that chocolate or cocoa comes from. They are two completely different plants with separate processes.\nThe United States is the largest cocaine market. Secret airfields and private boats transport the cocaine from\nColombia to distribution centers in Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean. From there, the drugs are\nsmuggled into the United States. Colombian drugs are a multibillion-dollar industry that makes up a large portion\nof the Colombian economy. The effect of the drug industry on the people of Colombia is extensive\u2014from the\ngunfire on the streets to the corruption of government officials. In recent years, the same drug cartels that have\noperated the cocaine industry have imported opium poppies, which grow well on the higher and more arid slopes 407 World Regional Geography\nof the Andes. Opium poppies are native to Asia but have been transported to South America. Opium is extracted\nfrom the seedpod and can be further refined into heroin. Colombian drug cartels, with a Mexican distribution\nnetwork, have muscled into as much as 20 percent of the US heroin market. The US government has supported the\nColombian government in the fight against the drug cartels and the trafficking of illegal drugs out of Colombia.\nColombian Coffee and Oil\nColombia\u2019s two main legal exports to the United States are coffee and oil. Coffee is only grown in the tropics,\nsince coffee trees must be grown in a frost-free environment. Coffee trees, which originally grew in Ethiopia, have\nsince been grown throughout the world. Coffee trees can grow in elevations from sea level to six thousand feet,\nbut most of the best specialty coffee is grown at elevations between three thousand to six thousand feet. Colombia\nhas ideal conditions for growing coffee and was once the world\u2019s largest coffee producer; now Brazil and Vietnam\neach produce more.\nEarly coffee production in Colombia was initially promoted by Catholic priests who were influential in supporting\nlocal parishioners to grow the crop. The industry was greatly enhanced in 1927 with the formation of the National\nFederation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. Coffee production on the mountain ranges of the Andes in Colombia\nsupports up to a half million small farms and local growers that make up a large portion of the coffee economy.\nHarvesting coffee is labor intensive and can employ large numbers of workers. The seasonal nature of the harvest\nalso leaves workers to find employment during the rest of the growing season.\nIn recent years, there has been growing concern about how climate change will continue to affect the region\u2019s\ncoffee production. In the past century, parts of Colombia experienced up to a 1 \u00baC average temperature increase\nand up to a 25 percent increase in precipitation. These climate changes have negatively affected coffee output and\nreduced coffee production as much as 25 percent in some areas. New agricultural methods are being developed in\nan attempt to counter these effects.\nOil has now become Colombia\u2019s number one legal export. Oil is found in fields in the northern and central regions\nof Colombia. Immense quantities of coal are also found in the same regions, but oil is more valued on the export\nmarket. Pipelines connect the interior oil fields of Colombia with the northern ports. The US market size and\npopulation make it the world\u2019s largest oil consumer. US oil companies have been investing in the development\nof Colombian oil for many years. Colombia has been a developing oil source even though its total extractable\nresources are not as vast as in other countries. For example, in 2006 the United States imported more oil from\nColombia than from Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Yemen combined. 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 408\nFigure 6.18 Insurgent Areas\nInsurgent groups control regions in Colombia as large as US states.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nSince the United States is the largest consumer of Colombian oil, it is easy to understand why the United States\nhas a vested interest in the stability of the Colombian government. A sizable portion of Colombia is controlled\nnot by the government but by drug cartels or other insurgent groups. Dozens of guerilla organizations also control\nportions of Colombia. Some insurgent groups support the government and are against the drug lords, while\nothers fight the government and work independently or with the cartels. Drug sales, kidnappings, and extortion\nof legitimate businesses provide income to these groups. Thousands of children serve in these groups, and about\na third of them are female. The most powerful insurgent group is FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of\nColombia), which controls entire regions the size of many US states. FARC is a recognized political entity by\nneighboring countries but is not given the same recognition by the United States and many external countries of\nthe region. 409 World Regional Geography\nFigure 6.19 Colombian Exports\nThe three main export products of Colombia are illegal drugs, oil, and coffee. The United States is the largest consumer of all three.\nDEA \u2013 public domain; R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA; Wikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe relationship between Colombia and the United States is often conflicting. The US consumer supports the\nColombian drug cartels by being the largest consumer of illegal drugs. The US government, under the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA), has declared a war on drugs and has supported the Colombian government\nwith billions of dollars in foreign aid to fight that war. On another front, US oil corporations have paid insurgent\ngroups to protect their oil assets. Oil is exported to the United States, bringing billions of dollars into the\nColombian economy. The chaos in Colombia is directly related to the exploitation and marketing of their\nresources. It is the people of Colombia that suffer in the cross fire from this civil war of corruption, crime, death,\nand destruction. The United States is a counterforce partner in this situation but operates from the consumer end\nof the resource pipeline. The largest consumer market for Colombia\u2019s export of oil, drugs, and coffee is the United\nStates, which is also the largest contributor of foreign aid to Colombia.\nRural Amerindian States of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia\nThe Central Andes, which includes Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, were home to the Inca Empire. The empire had\ngone through some internal divisions and was working on unifying the region when Francisco Pizarro\u2019s small\narmy defeated the Incan warriors and brought about colonial rule beginning in the 1530s. Many cultures lived\nin the Central Andes before the Inca, and their legacy continues in the customs and the ways of the Amerindian\npeople who still live there today. Spanish is the official language, or the lingua franca, but indigenous languages\nare widely spoken and dominate in the rural areas and remote villages. Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia make up 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 410\nthe core of the Rural Amerindian Region of South America. There have been border disputes among the three\ncountries, and also with their neighbors. Nevertheless, they all share the Andes and have many things in common.\nFigure 6.20 Machu Picchu\nHigh in the Peruvian Andes, the Lost City of the Incas, Machu Picchu, was rediscovered in 1911 by Yale archaeologist Hiram\nBingham and is one of the most beautiful and enigmatic ancient sites in the world. The ruins are located at about 7,970 feet in\nelevation and are surrounded by higher peaks of the Andes.\nFunkz \u2013 Machu Picchu 12 \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 411 World Regional Geography\nPhysical Geography\nThe physical geography of the Central Andes includes more than just the high Andes Mountains, although they\ndominate the landscape. The coastal region to the west of the Andes is generally warmer than the cooler climate of\nthe mountains. The equatorial region is rather humid. The coastal region in southern Peru is dry and arid because\nof the ocean currents and the rain shadow effect of the Andes, which creates the Atacama Desert that extends up\nfrom northern Chile. Southwest Bolivia has some of the world\u2019s largest salt flats in this dry and barren region.\nIn the interior, on the eastern side of the mountain ranges, is the huge expanse of the Amazon Basin. Tropical\nand humid with heavy precipitation is generally the climate rule. Rain forests and jungle fauna can be found on\nthe eastern slopes. The Altiplano region has the high-elevation Lake Titicaca. The variations in physical terrain\nprovide extensive biodiversity in animal and plant species. It also supports a variety of economic activities to\nexploit the bountiful natural resources.\nEven though the Altiplano region borders the Pacific Ocean, it also links directly to the Atlantic Ocean. The\nheadwaters that create the Amazon River start in Peru, and by the time the water reaches the Peruvian city of\nIquitos, the river is large enough to accommodate large shipping vessels. Iquitos is a port city for the Atlantic\nOcean with access to Europe, Africa, or eastern North America. The port also links the region with Brazil\u2019s free-\ntrade zone in Manaus, which has access to large oceangoing shipping and an international market.\nEconomic Geography\nThe region\u2019s main income comes from exports of minerals, fossil fuels, and agricultural products. Oil is the\nnumber one means of gaining national wealth in Ecuador and Peru; natural gas is the number one export of\nBolivia. Gold, silver, tin, and other minerals are also abundant and are being exploited as conditions allow.\nThe Spanish opened up a large silver-mining operation in Potos\u00ed, Bolivia, which continues to be exploited with\nmodern mining methods. Potos\u00ed, one of the earth\u2019s highest-elevation cities at 13,420 feet above sea level, was\nonce the largest silver mine in the world.\nThe city of Lima, Peru, was built on wealth from gold and silver extracted from the Inca Empire and the Andes\nMountains. As is the case in many peripheral regions, the economic state of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia is\ndependent on global prices for their export products. There has been considerable conflict and political wrangling\nabout who controls the wealth from extractive economic activities. Originally, the Spanish conquistadors took the 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 412\nmaterials and the wealth. They were replaced by Mestizo land owners and wealthy elites who struck deals with\ninternational corporations. The corporations exploited the countries\u2019 natural resources, with little profit actually\nending up in the hands of most of the people. These issues remain at the top of the political agendas in all three\ncountries.\nFigure 6.21 Quito, Ecuador\nQuito, Ecuador, is an urban center high in the Andes, with a population of more than 1.5 million. This photo shows the large buildings\nof the central business district with the mountains in the background surrounding the city. Quito is at about 9,200 feet in elevation\nand is considered the second-highest-elevation capital in the world after La Paz in Bolivia.\nDavid Berkowitz \u2013 Panoramic View \u2013 Quito, Ecuador \u2013 South America \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nPoverty and the exploitation of natural resources usually result in environmental degradation unless proper\nmeasures are taken to prevent it. The area\u2019s heavy reliance on oil and gas extraction to gain national wealth has\ncome at a great cost to their environment. Many oil spills have caused oil to enter the freshwater supplies of local 413 World Regional Geography\nresidents and pollute the rivers and streams of the Amazon Basin. Mining has traditionally devastated the land\nbecause large portions of earth are removed to extract the ore or mineral. Pollution is causing a loss of habitats\nand destroying ecosystems, and few measures are being taken to prevent it. Deforestation is being caused by the\ntimber industry and by clearing for agriculture. Overgrazing and the removal of the trees leave the soil open to\nerosion.\nTourism\nTourism is expanding to connect travelers with opportunities to explore Incan and pre-Incan sites, which are the\nmain attractions. One of the main tourist attractions in Peru is the ancient city of Machu Picchu in the Andes\nnot far from Cuzco. In 2010, Peru gained over two billion dollars from the tourist activities of about two million\nforeign tourists (Andina). Ecuador\u2019s major tourist attraction is the Galapagos Islands, which aided Charles Darwin\nin understanding natural selection and the evolutionary process. Bolivia has a number of ancient sites that predate\nthe Inca and have become major tourism destinations. The ancient city of Tiahuanaco and the enigmatic Lake\nTiticaca are good examples.\nTourism can be a great source of economic income but it can come at a cost to the environment. There is always\nconcern that high-traffic tourism sites like Machu Picchu can be degraded by the sheer mass of people visiting\nthe site. The environmental imprint may be extensive. The term ecotourism has been used to indicate the activity\nof people traveling to experience and enjoy the natural world with an aim not to damage the environment in the\nprocess. The main objective was to make the tourism activity sustainable, which promoted stewardship of the\nland and respect for its attractions. Jonathan Tourtellot, director of the National Geographic Society\u2019s Center for\nSustainable Destinations, coined and prefers the term geotourism, which can be translated as the stewardship\nof place and the preservation of its essential character (Miller-McCune). These concepts are becoming more\nintegrated with the tourism industry to promote a sustainable model for high traffic sites like the Galapagos Islands\nwith fragile ecosystems. 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 414\nPolitical Issues\nEconomics usually drive politics. Accordingly, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia have endured some serious ups\nand downs in their political environment. Corruption, authoritarianism, and human rights violations have been\ncommon accusations toward the political leadership of the countries. To address the economic condition of\nhis country in 2000, Ecuador\u2019s president announced that the country would adopt the US dollar as its main\nmedium of exchange. This may have brought some economic stability, but it did not address the problems of a\nhigh national debt and a fluctuation in commodity prices. All three countries have undergone political turmoil.\nLarge percentages of the populations live in poverty. Bolivia is considered one of the poorest countries in South\nAmerica. In 2006, Bolivia elected a socialist president from the MAS (Movement for Socialism) party who was\nfrom a minority Amerindian group rather than a member of the wealthy elite. In Peru, a number of presidents have\nbeen forced to resign, and military coups have also produced leadership changes.\nFigure 6.22 Indigenous Women on Their Way Home from the MAS congress in Bolivia, January 2009\nMAS is the Movement for Socialism, which has been active in Bolivian politics.\nNorsk Folkehjelp Norwegian \u2013 Urfolk i Bolivia \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 415 World Regional Geography\nPopulation and Culture\nPopulation growth is a major factor in the future of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. In 2010, Bolivia had more than\nten million people, Ecuador had more than fourteen million, and Peru had about twenty-nine million. More than\n30 percent of the population of Ecuador and Bolivia resides in rural areas and make a living from subsistence\nagriculture. All three countries have large populations in relation to the production of adequate food. Peru and\nBolivia are large countries in physical area but do not have a high percentage of arable land. Rural-to-urban shift\nis increasing and the major cities are continuing to expand, overtaxing public works and social services.\nThe culture of the Central Andes is heavily influenced by its rural Amerindian heritage. The foundation of the\ntraditional agrarian society has been subsistence agriculture. One-third of the population in Ecuador and Bolivia\nand up to one-fourth of the population in Peru continue to live a traditional way of life. Local cuisine reflects\nthe connection to the land. Potatoes, maize, guinea pigs, and fish are common fare in rural areas. The cities are\nencountering international influences that are changing the demands in local cuisine and culture. Traditional food,\narts, and local crafts still thrive in the local districts and for the tourism market.\nFigure 6.23 The Andean West and Paraguay 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 416\nThis map also displays a part of the Amazon Basin, the Atacama Desert, Altiplano, and the Mato Grosso Plateau.\nUniversity of Texas Libraries.\nThis region\u2019s location on the Pacific Rim of South America has contributed to an Asian influence, which has\nintegrated itself with the local culture. Former president of Peru Alberto Fujimori had Japanese ancestry and held\ndual citizenship in both Peru and Japan. Similar to Havana, Cuba, in Middle America, Lima, Peru, is also home\nto one of the earliest Chinatowns in the Americas, where the Chinese culture has mixed with the Latino culture to\ncreate a unique cultural blend. Bolivia is landlocked and does not have the advantage of a west-coast port city to\ninteract with the Asian marketplace. However, its culture is still impacted by globalization and is evolving from\nwithin. 417 World Regional Geography\nParaguay\nParaguay is located in the Mixed Mestizo Cultural Region between Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia. This\nlandlocked country is not located in the Andes. The country\u2019s poor economic characteristics and troublesome\npolitical dynamics are similar to those of its neighbors in the Central Andes. Like other Latin American countries,\nmost of the population practices Catholicism. Spanish is one of the main languages along with Guarani, the local\nlanguage of the people. The country\u2019s name comes from the Paraguay River, which flows through the region\nand provides hydroelectric dams that provide all the electricity for the country. Paraguay suffers from a lack of\ninfrastructure. The government has not been able to provide for the needs of a growing population with a fertility\nrate of more than three children per family.\nAs much as 40 percent of the population makes its living from agriculture. However, conditions in the rural areas\nare poor: less than 10 percent of the land is arable. There is not much agricultural growth that could boost the\neconomy. Paraguay is the sixth-largest producer of soybeans in the world, and cattle ranching is its other strong\ncommodity. A large portion of the marshlands have been transformed for agricultural purposes, but this has caused\na loss of wetlands as a habitat.\nThe economy is afflicted by poverty and an absence of opportunities and advantages. Connections to global\nmarkets are hindered by the lack of an international port. Corruption and unstable governments are the political\nsystem\u2019s legacy. There is a wide disparity between the social elites, who own a high percentage of the land, and\nmost of the population, which remains in poverty with poor living conditions. Large family size and rural-to-\nurban shift has caused rapid growth of the urban areas. Sixty percent of the population lives in the cities, and they\noften suffer from insanitary conditions because of water pollution. The largest slums in the country are found in\nthe expanse of the capital city of Asuncion, which has almost two million people. In the urban areas, there is a\nstrong informal market economy that thrives on imported goods being redistributed to other countries, but there\nis no formal record-keeping system. An enormous number of black-market goods are brought in and resold to\nneighboring countries such as Brazil and Argentina, its two largest trading partners. In such conditions, crime and\nillegal activities thrive, and the rule of law is difficult to enforce.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Most of the people in Venezuela live in cities along the Caribbean coast. The country has always been urban\nand has not developed its agricultural production. Venezuela depends on oil exports to gain most of its\nnational wealth.\n\u2022 The United States is the largest consumer of products exported from Colombia. Illegal drugs, oil, and coffee\nand are the three main export products of Colombia. The United States directly or indirectly supports the\nthree main factions vying for power within Colombia.\n\u2022 The Andean countries of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia share similar developmental dynamics, including a\nlarge percentage of Amerindian people and reliance on the export of natural resources to gain national\nwealth. The wealth gained from exports is concentrated in the hands of elites rather than filtering down to\nmost of the people.\n\u2022 Paraguay is a landlocked country between the Andes and the Atlantic coast. It is a poor nation with few\nopportunities to advance its standard of living. The country has been a main staging ground for unregulated 6.2 Urban North and Andean West 418\ngoods to be redistributed throughout the region.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the ethnic composition of Brazil and learn why the population is so diverse.\n2. Explain how the core-periphery spatial relationship applies to the country. Be able to clarify how the\ndynamics of the country shape the core and the periphery.\n3. Describe the main activities that are involved in the development and exploitation of the Amazon Basin.\nLearn how deforestation affects the tropical rain forest and environmental conditions.\n4. Outline the main characteristics and economic activities of the main regions of Brazil.\nA Portuguese Colony\nBrazil, the largest country in South America, is similar in physical area to the continental United States (i.e., the\nUnited States without Alaska or Hawaii). Catholicism is the dominant religion and Portuguese is the primary\nlanguage. Once a Portuguese colony, the country\u2019s culture was built on European immigration and African slave\nlabor, making for a rich mixture of ethnic backgrounds.\nIn colonial times, Brazil was a part of the Atlantic Trade Triangle, which functioned as a transportation\nconveyor, moving goods and people around the regions bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Colonial merchant ships\nfinanced by Europe\u2019s wealthy elite brought goods and trinkets to the African coast to trade for slaves, who were\nshipped to the Americas and the Caribbean to diminish the labor shortage for the colonies. The last leg of the\nAtlantic Trade Triangle moved food crops, sugar, tobacco, and rum from the colonies back to the European ports.\nThe merchant ships never sailed with an empty hold, and their successful voyages provided enormous profits to\nthe European financiers.\n419 6.3 Brazil 420\nFigure 6.24 Atlantic Trade Triangle\nManufactured trinkets were sent to Africa from Europe, slaves were sent to the Americas, and plantation products\nand rum were sent to Europe. The Atlantic slave trade was responsible for bringing more than ten million African\nslaves to the Americas. Brazil received the largest number of slaves.\nThe total number of individuals taken as slaves from Africa is unclear and often debated. It is estimated that more\nthan ten million African slaves survived the Middle Passage from Africa to the Western Hemisphere, which is\nmore than the current population of Bolivia. Slavery supplied cheap labor for the plantations and agricultural\noperations in the New World. Brazil took in more African slaves than any other single country\u2014at least three\nmillion. Colonial Brazil thrived on early plantation agriculture. When slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888,\nthe freed slaves found themselves on the lower end of the socioeconomic hierarchy. People of mixed African\ndescent now make up more than one-third of Brazil\u2019s population. The Afro-Brazilian heritage remains strong and\ndominates the country\u2019s east coast. The African influence is evident in everything from the samba schools of the\nBrazilian carnival to the music and traditions of the people. In spite of Brazil being a culturally diverse country,\nAfricans still have not found themselves on an even playing field in terms of economic or political opportunities\nin positions of power in the country.\nFigure 6.25 Population of the Various Regions of Brazil Indicating the Core Region around the Cities of the Southeast 421 World Regional Geography\nThe peripheral region includes the large Amazon Basin of the north. Notice the many small states in the Northeast from Fortaleza to\nSalvador; these states are densely populated.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nSoutheast Core: Urbanize and Industrialize\nBrazil\u2019s human development patterns are an example of the core-periphery spatial relationship. The main\neconomic core area is located in the southeast region of Brazil, an area that is home to the largest cities of the 6.3 Brazil 422\nrealm and acts as the hub for industrial and economic activities. Political and economic power is held by elites\nresiding in the urban core areas. The rural northern Amazon Basin is the heart of the periphery, providing raw\nmaterials and resources needed in the core. The periphery has a small population density, and most are Amerindian\ngroups that make a living from subsistence agriculture, mining, and forestry. Rural-to-urban shift has prompted\nmany of the rural poor to migrate to the large cities.\nFounded in 1554 as a Catholic mission, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo rests at the heart of the core region. Its pattern\nof development is similar to that of Mexico City. Coffee production was the early basis of the local economy.\nS\u00e3o Paulo is located about thirty miles inland from the coast. It has grown to be the center of trade and industry\nfor Brazil, but Rio de Janeiro receives greater attention for tourism. With more than twenty million people, S\u00e3o\nPaulo is the largest industrial metropolis south of the Equator, the largest city in South America, and among the\nlargest cities on the planet.\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\u2019s best-known city, is a travel and international business center with a population of more\nthan ten million. The city is renowned for its carnival festivities and famous coastline. Tourists are attracted by\nits cultural attractions and coastal setting, with beautiful sandy beaches and the landmark Sugarloaf Mountain\nlocated in an open bay. Salvador, located on the coast, was Brazil\u2019s first capital. Rio de Janeiro became the capital\nin 1763, but to further develop Brazil\u2019s interior, in 1960 the capital was moved from Rio to the forward capital\nof Brasilia. Forward capitals are created to either shift development or to safeguard a geographical region. Brazil\nhas an enormous interior region that it wishes to continue to develop for economic gain and the creation of the\nforward capital of Brasilia is in line with this objective.\nFigure 6.26 Christ the Redeemer 423 World Regional Geography\nThis giant statue overlooks the immense urban landscape of Rio de Janeiro, with Sugarloaf Mountain in the background.\nKirilos \u2013 Rio de Janeiro \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe three cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia, along with their urban neighbors, anchor the core\nregion in the south. Brazil\u2019s internal migration to these cities follows a rural-to-urban or periphery-to-core pattern,\nso it is no mystery why these three cities continue to grow at an unprecedented rate. S\u00e3o Paulo is more than sixty\nmiles across. As migrant workers from the countryside and from the rural northeast migrate to the cities looking\nfor work, they expand the city through self-construction. Slums, called favelas, extend out from the central city\nfor miles.\nThe cultural fabric of Brazil has been built by immigrants from many countries. Brazil\u2019s diverse population has\nlinked the country to the homelands of its immigrants and established trade and cultural connections that benefit\nthe country in the global marketplace. The more than two hundred million people that make up Brazil\u2019s population\nare diverse and yet integrated, even if many still hold to the traditions or cultural heritage of their country of\norigin. After World War II, a large number of Japanese migrated to S\u00e3o Paulo. Today, Brazil boasts the largest\nJapanese population outside Japan. Many people from both Western and Eastern Europe have made Brazil their\nhome, and large numbers of people from Lebanon, Syria, and the Middle East have immigrated here.\nIn spite its cultural diversity, Brazil has two overarching cultural forces that have helped hold the country together:\nthe Portuguese language and Catholicism. These two centripetal forces help establish a sense of nationalism and\nidentity. The Portuguese language has been adapted to the Brazilian society to reflect a slightly different dialect\nthan the Portuguese spoken in Portugal. The Portuguese language has more of a unifying effect than religion.\nThough about 70 percent of the population claims to be Roman Catholic, additional religious affiliations in Brazil\nrange from the African influence of Umbanda to the Muslim minority. Protestant denominations are the second-\nlargest religious affiliations in Brazil. Secularism is on the rise, and many do not actively practice their specified\nreligion. 6.3 Brazil 424\nIn both population and physical area, Brazil ranks fifth in the world. Brazil is as urban as the United States\nor countries in the European Union. The index of economic development can be applied to Brazil: as a region\nurbanizes and industrializes, the family size usually decreases and incomes usually increase. Family size has\ndropped significantly, from 4.4 children in 1980 to 2.4 children in 2000, and continues to decline. Religious\ntraditions give way to the urban culture and secular attitudes of modernity when it comes to family size.\nBrazil is an urban country. Approximately 87 percent of Brazil\u2019s population lives in urban areas. Urbanization\nseldom eliminates poverty. Though the index of economic development indicates that urbanization will increase\nincomes for the population as a whole, poverty is a standard component of any large urban area in most places of\nthe world, and the favelas of Brazil are similar to slums elsewhere.\nFigure 6.27 Favela La Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nFavelas are usually self-constructed and start out as slums. Many lack ownership rights, police protection, or public services. With\ntime, some become established neighborhoods.\nPedro Lopez \u2013 Favela, Rio de Janeiro \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe favelas of Brazil\u2019s urban centers are dynamic places, where land ownership, law and order, and public 425 World Regional Geography\nservices are questionable. Millions of people live in the favelas of Brazil\u2019s large cities. Poverty and the search for\nopportunities and advantages are common elements of urban life. The core cities of Brazil suffer from the same\nproblems as other developing megacities: overcrowding, pollution, congestion, traffic jams, crime, and increased\nsocial tensions. The energy generated by the sheer magnitude of people, industry, and commerce continues to fuel\nBrazil\u2019s vibrant growth and its many large, dynamic cities.\nThe pattern of wealth developing in Brazil is quite common: wealth and the ability to obtain wealth are held in\nthe hands of those at the higher end of the socioeconomic ladder. The pyramid-shaped graphic used to illustrate\nMexico\u2019s social layers in Chapter 5 \u201cMiddle America\u201d, Section 5.2 \u201cMexico\u201d can also be applied to Brazil (see\nFigure 6.28 \u201cSocioeconomic Classes in Brazil, Also Common throughout Middle and South America\u201d). The\nminority wealthy elite own most of the land and businesses and control more than half the wealth. Corporate\ncolonialism is quite active in Brazil. Multinational corporations take advantage of the country\u2019s development\nactivities and muscle in on the profits, which seldom reach the hands of the majority at the lower end of society.\nFigure 6.28 Socioeconomic Classes in Brazil, Also Common throughout Middle and South America 6.3 Brazil 426\nBrazil is an emerging power in the world marketplace. Brazil has the largest economy in South America and is\na parallel force with the United States in the Northern Hemisphere. The country has urbanized and industrialized\nto compete with the global economic core areas in many ways. Brazil is among the ten largest economies in the\nworld.\nBrazil has favorable resources and labor to complete in the global marketplace. Its agricultural output has grown\nimmensely over the past few decades. Brazil is a major exporter of soybeans, coffee, orange juice, beef, and other\nagricultural products. Brazil is the largest coffee producer in South America, but coffee only constitutes about 5\npercent of its current annual exports. Coffee production is extensive in the Brazilian Highlands just inland from\nthe coast. In addition, Brazil exports more orange juice than any other country and is second in the world in\nsoybean production. The vast central interior regions such as the cerrado continue to be developed for industrial\nfarming of massive food crops. However, exports of industrial manufactured products have surpassed agricultural\nexports in 2010. The availability of abundant minerals and iron ore has supported an expanding steel industry\nand automotive manufacturing, and its industrial activity continues to develop. Competitive high-tech companies\ncontinue to emerge, and production has increased in semiconductors, computers, petrochemicals, aircraft, and a\nhost of other consumer-based products that provide economic growth.\nBrazil economically dominates and anchors South America. The economic integration being developed\nthroughout the South American continent has great potential because it combines the energy region of the north,\nthe commercial centers in the south, and the agricultural sectors as complementary forces within Brazil\u2019s industrial\nbase. Brazil is at both the physical center and the economic center of the continent.\nBrazil is not only emerging on the world\u2019s stage on the economic front, but it also has a strong social and cultural\npresence in the world. The large metropolitan areas of the country are a Mecca for fashion and the arts. Carnival\nis the most well known of Brazil\u2019s cultural festivals, but the country is host to a number of other international\nevents. Brazil is active in world sports competition and hosted the 2007 Pan American Games. Rio de Janeiro has\nbeen scheduled to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale\nde Football Association (International Federation of Association Football) is commonly known by the acronym\nFIFA and is the international governing body of soccer (football). The 2010 FIFA World Cup was held in South\nAfrica.\nNorthern Periphery: The Amazon Basin\nJust as the megacities of southern Brazil anchor the core of the country, it is the rural expanse of the Amazon 427 World Regional Geography\nNorth that makes up the periphery. A region the size of the US Midwest, the Amazon River basin is a frontier\ndevelopment area that has been exploited for its natural resources. Rubber barons of early years traveled up\nthe Amazon River and established the port city of Manaus to organize rubber plantations for automobile tires.\nThe Amazon River is large enough for oceangoing vessels to travel to Manaus. Today, Manaus has a free-trade\nzone with an entire industrial complex for the production of electronic goods and an ultramodern airport facility.\nSmaller ships can continue up the Amazon River all the way to Iquitos in Peru, which makes Manaus an ideal\ncore city for economic trade; smuggling; and transshipment of illegal goods, including exotic animals from the\nregion, such as monkeys, beautifully colored parrots, and other birds.\nFigure 6.29 Natural Vegetation of Brazil 6.3 Brazil 428\nThe immense area of the tropical rain forest can be seen on this map. The extensive cerrado region is noted on this map between the\ntropical rain forests of the Amazon Basin and the deciduous forests of the southeast. The soils of the thorny scrub region along the\nnortheast are not as conducive to large-scale agriculture as is the cerrado.\nSource: Based on map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe other regions of the Amazon Basin have not been as fortunate as Manaus. Deforestation from cattle\nranching, logging, and mining have devastated parts of the tropical rain forests of the Amazon Basin. The\nAmerindian populations have also suffered from encroachment into their lands. Only about two hundred thousand\nAmerindians are estimated to remain in Brazil, and most reside in the Amazon interior. This region boasts one\nof the world\u2019s leading reserves of iron ore; as much as one-third of Europe\u2019s iron ore demands are met through\nextensive mining southwest of Bel\u00e9m. In this area, a development scheme known as the Grande Caraj\u00e1s Project\nwas implemented to create the infrastructure to support the mining complex and aid in the exploitation of the\niron ore and other minerals. A large dam was built to provide hydroelectric power, and a railroad line was\nlaid down to transport the ore to the Atlantic coast. The availability of transportation and energy attract other\neconomic activities. Deforestation for cattle ranching and farming has increased. Many poor settlers have arrived\nseeking employment opportunities or a chance to obtain land. The rapidly expanding development activities in the\nAmazon basin have boosted the region\u2019s economic situation, but at the same time there is growing concern about\nthe preservation of the natural environment. 429 World Regional Geography\nGold mining, an activity that has been widespread in the Amazon region for many decades, also presents\nenvironmental problems. Toxic substances such as cyanide and mercury used in the collection of gold from rivers\nand streams have entered the waters and tributaries of the Amazon River. The pollutants then enter the food\nchain and harm the ecosystem. The mining of ores and minerals has enticed people to immigrate to the area,\ncreating frontier boomtowns with few public utilities or social services and poorly organized law and order. The\nexploitation of natural resources exacts a cost from the environment and the local indigenous Amerindian people.\nAmerindian groups have used the land as hunting grounds for centuries, but the rapid influx of gold miners and\nland speculators has caused conflicts with local groups who claim the land. Violence in the Amazon and battles\nfor control over land and resources have been well documented.\nFigure 6.30 Deforestation in the Amazon\nDeforestation in the Amazon is caused mainly by logging, agriculture, and mining. Agricultural practices can include slash-and-burn\nfarming and cattle ranching.\nMatt Zimmerman \u2013 Slash and burn agriculture in the Amazon \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 6.3 Brazil 430\nDeforestation has reduced the habitat critical to the survival of native species. An estimated 50 percent of the\nearth\u2019s species live in tropical rain forests, which only cover about 5 percent of the earth\u2019s surface. Tropical rain\nforests in the Amazon Basin are being cut down at an unsustainable rate, creating serious environmental problems.\nLoggers cut down the large trees, and the rest are usually burned to allow the ash to provide nutrients for other\nplants. The cleared areas are most often used by cattle ranchers until the soil is no longer viable. Then more forest\nis cut down and the process continues. Speculation that land prices will increase as the region becomes more\ndeveloped encourages this process.\nThe forest has many layers of habitat. Soils in the tropics are extremely low in nutrients, which have been leached\nout by the abundant rainfall. The nutrients are on the surface layer of the ground built up from falling leaves,\nbranches, and debris decomposing on the forest floor. The removal of the forests removes these nutrients and\nresults in serious soil erosion. Tropical forests usually expand along the edges where falling debris from the trees\ncollects and provides nutrients for young plants.\nThere is much discussion among environmentalists, scientists, and other concerned people about deforestation in\nthe Amazon region, usually with a focus on the devastation that results from the loss of forested areas. Forest\nstudies have indicated that tropical rain forests are actually quite resilient and can recover with proper forest\nmanagement. However, clear-cutting large, wide areas for timber leaves an area devastated for an extended period.\nClear-cutting could be replaced by strip cutting, which would harvest trees in narrower strips, leaving rows of\ntrees standing. Strip cutting allows for more edges to be available for young plants to get their start to replenish\nthe forest.\nFigure 6.31 Dynamics of a Tropical Rain Forest 431 World Regional Geography\nThis image illustrates that the nutrients of the tropical rain forest ecosystem rests on the forest floor because tropical soils are degraded. The forest canopy has many habitat layers\nproviding homes to a diversity of organisms. Dense tropical rain forests also contribute to the process of transpiration, which cycles precipitation from the ground back into the\natmospheres where it can collect and return in the form of rain.\nAdditional forest habitat is lost when rivers are dammed up for hydroelectric power and thousands of acres of\ntropical rain forests are flooded. Decomposing plant material in the reservoirs behind the dams increases the\nwater\u2019s acidity, causing erosion to the hydroelectric turbines. The turbines have a short life span, so the dams are\na short-term energy solution that creates long-term problems. The immense flooded areas reduce the habitat for\ntropical organisms and restrict the use of the land for other purposes. Flooding can extend into traditional hunting\ngrounds for indigenous groups, who have little political power to restrict this type of development.\nThe Amazon Basin is in the midst of a development pattern in which peripheral regions are exploited for natural\nresources or agricultural production. Much of the wealth generated ends up in the hands of investors who live\nin the core cities or in other countries rather than local people, a common and recurring pattern of economic\nexploitation of the periphery. The great frontier of the Amazon Basin continues to attract thousands of new\nimmigrants seeking out opportunities or employment. As roads and highways are built to open up new paths\nthrough the region, even more of the forest gets cut down to accommodate the development pattern. This region\nwill continue to be developed and altered, and the government of Brazil will have to continue to control its\nevolving dynamics in order to preserve the natural environment. 6.3 Brazil 432\nRegional Brazil\nThe core-peripheral spatial relationship can help us understand the power of Brazil\u2019s southeast core and the natural\nresource base of the country\u2019s peripheral north. This can explain the basic layout of Brazil\u2019s economic geography,\nbut the northeast, the west central, and the south are three additional regions to consider that contribute to the\ngeographic understanding of the country. Each has specific qualities that make it unique in Brazil\u2019s diversity of\nlandscapes.\nThe northeast region is anchored along the coast, where plantation agriculture thrived during the colonial era.\nAfrican slaves became the main labor base, and once freed, they made up most of the population. This agricultural\nregion still grows sugarcane along the coast and other crops inland where the rainfall is reduced. The inland region\nincludes parts of the Brazilian Highland, which runs parallel to the coast. Agriculture has traditionally required a\nlarge labor base, and family sizes in rural areas have been larger than their urban counterparts. This trend has given\nrise to a regional population of more than fifty million. However, the agriculture-based economy has not been able\nto supply the number of jobs and opportunities required for this large population. Poverty and unemployment in\nthe northeast are high and have a devastating effect on the people. Some farms are not large enough for families to\nmake a living on. Individuals in the northeast have developed a pattern of migration to the larger cities of the core\narea, looking for opportunities and employment\u2014a pattern that fuels the self-constructed housing in the favelas\nof Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.\nThe west central region has been opening up for development since the last part of the twentieth century and\nhas experienced enormous advancements in industrial agriculture. In this region, vast cerrado grasslands are\nbeing plowed and converted into colossal fields of soybeans, grains, and cotton. The northwest portion of the\ncerrado is the huge Motto Grosso Plateau, which almost covers the largest state of the region. The landscape of\nthis plateau is mainly scrub forest and savanna. Traditionally, the savanna portions have been used for grazing\nlivestock, but in recent years more of the land is being plowed for growing agricultural crops. The entire west\ncentral region of Brazil is a giant breadbasket for the country. Its full agricultural potential has not been reached.\nIndustrial agriculture requires infrastructure and transportation networks to transport the harvests to market, but\nthe government has not kept up with the development of infrastructure at the same rate as the private sector has\nbeen developing industrial agricultural production. This region has enormous potential for agricultural expansion\nin the future.\nFigure 6.32 Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasilia 433 World Regional Geography\nThe forward capital of Brasilia, built in 1960, showcases many architectural styles.\nCarla Salgueiro \u2013 Brasilia \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nLocated on the eastern edge of the west central region is the forward capital of Brasilia. Its creation was prompted\nby the need to further develop the country\u2019s interior. Built in 1960 and now a metropolitan center with more\nthan 3.8 million people, the city was planned and designed to be a capital city. Because of its rapid growth and\ndevelopment, the city faces issues similar to those found in Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo. Rural-to-urban shift has\nbrought many rural people to Brasilia in search of opportunities and employment. Just as Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o\nPaulo have favelas, Brasilia has slums and self-constructed districts, too. Moving the capital to Brasilia moved the\nfocus from the coastal region of the south to the interior. However, a large percentage of the interior lies beyond\nthe city of Brasilia. Highways that reach the Amazon can be accessed from the capital, but large areas of Brazil\u2019s\ninterior remain a frontier unexploited by development. Developing these areas may bring great opportunities and\nbenefits to the country; however, recent development activities have also brought devastation to the tropical rain\nforests in many parts of the frontier.\nThe three states of the south region are located well south of the Tropic of Capricorn and extend south to the\nborder with Uruguay. This extrusion is often called South Brazil. Brazil was colonized by the Portuguese, but\nmany of the immigrants to the south were from other parts of Europe, including Germany and Italy. The Italian\nimmigrants developed a growing wine industry, and the German immigrants raised cattle and grew other crops.\nThe region\u2019s good soils and moderate climate support many types of agriculture, which have dominated the early\ndevelopment of the region. Success in growing rice and tobacco and raising livestock has brought prosperity to\nthe people who live here. Brazil has been one of the world\u2019s main producers of tobacco for many years, and the\ntobacco from the south is highly regarded for its nicotine content. 6.3 Brazil 434\nFigure 6.33 Miolo Vineyard\nThe Miolo Vineyard is located in the interior of the Brazil\u2019s affluent south region. Many Italian immigrants settled here and developed\na wine industry that continues today.\nJeff Belmonte \u2013 Vinicola Miolo | Miolo Vineyard \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe south is one of Brazil\u2019s most affluent regions, and it has gained much wealth from agricultural activities.\nFarming is only one of the region\u2019s highly developed economic activities. The area is also blessed with natural 435 World Regional Geography\nresources such as coal that is shipped north to the main cities where steel is produced. The wealth of the region\nhas provided support for high-tech industries, which are attracted to the region because of the supply of skilled\nlabor, access to quality transportation, and communication links. Computer companies have established software\nfirms that have in turn attracted other new companies. A technology center similar to California\u2019s Silicon Valley\nhas combined with the manufacturing complex that has sprouted up along the coast of the south. The government\nand the business community have both provided economic incentives for these and other emerging enterprises.\nThe attractiveness of the region in terms of both physical geography and economic stability has prompted some\nwho live there to suggest that the region should separate from Brazil and become an independent country. Along\nthe same vein, residents of the region have discouraged immigrants from poorer regions of other Brazilian\nstates from moving here. Poor migrants seeking opportunities or employment are often rejected and provided\ntransportation back to where they came from just to keep them from becoming residents. Nevertheless, many\npeople have migrated to the south. The region is host to immigrants from Japan and the Middle East. The\nprogressive cities and striking environmental conditions will continue to attract people to live here.\nThe Brazilian City of Curitiba in the South\nBrazil\u2019s \u201cgreen city\u201d of Curitiba in the south region has been a model of urban planning that has been used in the\ndevelopment of cities around the world. Curitiba is an attractive city in its urban design, environmental friendly attitudes\nand its green spaces. The city even served as Brazil\u2019s capital for a few days in 1969 during a transition period before the\nforward capital of Brasilia was built.\nThe city is an industrial hub for southern Brazil and has diverse commercial activities\u2014from manufacturing to financial\nservices and tourism. Automobile manufacturing is a major part of the industrial sector and is the second largest car\nmaker in the country. The modern airport, bus system, and planned green spaces create a favorable environment for\ncommercial ventures, which are promoted via business incubators to attract new enterprises.\nIn 2010, Curitiba had an overall metropolitan population of about 2.3 million but has used mass transit and\nenvironmental planning with great efficiency. Urban planning has helped develop a combination of streets and districts\nthat encourage walking, bicycling, and mass transit as the main means of access. Pedestrian malls with shopping,\nrestaurants, and services are common. More than sixty miles of bike routes allow commuters to bicycle to work. The\nrapid transit system, regularly used by approximately 85 percent of the people in the city, is rated as one of the best in\nthe world. As much as 70 percent of the city\u2019s trash is recycled, providing additional employment opportunities. At the\nsame time that the population doubled, the use of automobiles declined by 30 percent. However, the city still has the\nhighest rate of automobile ownership per person in Brazil. The decline in automobile use has had a positive effect on air\nquality by reducing the amount of harmful exhaust emissions. Serious urban planning has gone into creating Curitiba as\nan efficient and yet progressive city. In 2010 Curitiba was awarded the Globe Sustainable City Award, which was set up\nto recognize cities and municipalities that excel in sustainable urban development around the world (EkonomiNyheter). 6.3 Brazil 436\nFigure 6.34 Rua XV de Novembro 437 World Regional Geography\nThe mayor of Curitiba developed a master plan for the city in 1972. One weekend, the mayor changed one of the main\ndowntown avenues into a pedestrian-only street without announcing it to the public. At first the local businesses objected to\nit, but once the concept caught on, the street became one of the most actively visited parts of the downtown area.\nLu \u2013 Canon-proimage \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Brazil was a Portuguese colony during the colonial era. This is why the Portuguese language and the\nCatholic religion are dominant components of the Brazilian culture. The strong African heritage comes from 6.3 Brazil 438\nthe many African slaves brought in during the colonial era to work the plantations. Immigrants from many\nother countries have settled in Brazil as well.\n\u2022 The urban southeast, with its large cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, represents the core economic area\nof the country. The large cities of Brazil continue to expand to accommodate the influx of new immigrants.\nThe outer edges of the cities expand through self-construction in slums called favelas.\n\u2022 The northern regions of the Amazon Basin represent the periphery of the country. The north is being\nexploited for its natural resources. Development patterns have caused extensive deforestation of the tropical\nrain forest of the region. The main causes are agriculture, logging, and mining.\n\u2022 Other regions of Brazil include the west central, with extensive agricultural activities; the northeast, heavily\npopulated with serious poverty; and the south in the protruded area bordering Uruguay, which is an affluent\nregion with high standards of living.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the main physical features and regions of the Southern Cone.\n2. Identify and locate the urban centers and understand the pattern of population distribution in the three\ncountries of the region.\n3. Describe the ethnic consistency of each country. Explain the pattern of immigration that created the region\u2019s\nheritage.\n4. Explain why Argentina has great potential for economic growth.\n5. Outline how Chile has emerged as a strong and stable country and discuss its human and natural resources.\nThe Southern Cone region of South America includes the countries of Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. The name\nis an indication of the physical shape of the southern portion of the continent. The region is located south of the\ntropics. The Tropic of Capricorn runs just north of Uruguay and cuts across the northern regions of Argentina\nand Chile. The Southern Cone has more moderate temperatures than the tropics. Type C climates dominate in\nUruguay, the Pampas region of Argentina, and central Chile. The region has extremes in weather and climate. The\nAtacama Desert and Patagonia both have type B climates because of a lack of precipitation, which stems from the\nrain shadow effect of the Andes Mountains. Highland type H climates follow the Andes chain through the region\nand exhibit their typical pattern of warmer temperatures at lower elevations and colder temperatures at higher\nelevations.\nFigure 6.35 The Three Main Regions of Chile (left); Argentina and Uruguay with the Regions of Argentina Outlined and Labeled (right)\n440 441 World Regional Geography\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nThe countries of the Southern Cone share similar economic and ethnic patterns. Agriculture has been a major\nfocus of the region\u2019s early development pattern, but today a large percentage of the population is urbanized.\nThe European heritage of most of the population ties this region to Europe as an early trading partner. The\nglobal economy has given cause for these countries to form trade relationships with many countries. The physical\ngeography has provided many opportunities for human activities. The mountains, plains, and coastal areas provide\na diversity of natural resources that have been exploited for national wealth. All three countries have primate cities\nthat hold a high percent of the country\u2019s population. Primate cities are usually twice as large as the next largest\ncity and usually are exceptionally expressive of the national feeling and culture. In this case, all three primate\ncities are also the capital cities of each country. The Southern Cone is an urban region with higher incomes and\nhigher standards of living than many other parts of South America. 6.4 The Southern Cone 442\nUruguay\nUruguay is located along the South Atlantic coast bordering Argentina and Brazil. The only South American\ncountry smaller in physical area is Suriname. French Guiana is also smaller than Uruguay but remains a\ndepartment of France. Uruguay has the location, natural resources, and global trade connections to provide ample\nopportunities and advantages for its people. The agricultural lands of the Pampas extend into Uruguay and provide\nfor an extensive agricultural industry with livestock, small grains, vegetables, and dairy. This agricultural base has\nbeen the foundation of Uruguay\u2019s growing economy.\nUruguay has been able to integrate itself into the global trade arena and has entered into a postindustrial\ndevelopment status. Postindustrial activities have included computer software development and advancements in\ninformation technologies. Uruguay is a modern and well-developed country. About 88 percent of the population\nis of European descent, and more than 92 percent of the population is urban. The capital city of Montevideo,\na cosmopolitan city with a population of about 3.5 million, is home to about 40 percent of the population. The\ncoastal region is an attractive place for tourists and locals who enjoy the beautiful beaches along the shores of the\nAtlantic.\nFigure 6.36 Beachfront in Punta del Este, Uruguay 443 World Regional Geography\nNotice the high-rise apartments and commercial buildings. Uruguay is highly urbanized and has been an attractive place for tourism.\nErnesto Jorysz \u2013 Punta del Este (Uruguay) \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nMontevideo is also the location of the headquarters for Mercosur (the Southern Cone Common Market). Mercosur\nwas created in 1991 to open trade of goods and services among South American countries and promote\ndevelopment within the realm. Current members of Mercosur include Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina.\nVenezuela\u2019s application for full membership is pending. Additional associate members of Mercosur include Peru,\nEcuador, Colombia, Chile, and Bolivia. Mercosur is on a parallel path to compete with the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the European Union, and\nother global trade associations.\nArgentina\nSouth America\u2019s second-largest country is Argentina. In physical area, Argentina is ranked eighth in the world.\nThe Andes Mountains span its entire western border with Chile. At the southern end of the continent is Tierra 6.4 The Southern Cone 444\ndel Fuego. Argentina is a land of extremes. Mt. Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere\nat 22,841 feet in elevation, and Laguna del Carbon is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere at \u2212344 feet\nbelow sea level. Parts of the northern region have a tropical climate; the southern region extends into tundra-like\nconditions with treeless plains. Argentina also claims the Falkland Islands, which are now controlled by Great\nBritain. In 1982, Argentina\u2019s ruling military junta attempted to retake control of the Falklands, but the British\nnavy halted the action in what became known as the Falklands War.\nPhysical Regions\nArgentina can be categorized into a number of regions that correlate roughly with the varied physical and\ncultural landscapes of the country. The main regions include Chaco, Northern, Mesopotamia, Cuyo, Pampas, and\nPatagonia. The Northern region of Argentina has one of the highest average elevations because of the Andes\nMountain Ranges. The Andes ranges widen as they proceed northward to the west of Chaco and are home to\nfertile river valleys. The northern ends of the ranges extend into Bolivia and enter the Altiplano of the Central\nAndes.\nThe Chaco region, which is formally called the Gran Chaco, extends from northern Argentina into western\nParaguay. Scrublands and subtropical forests dominate the landscape. There is a wet season as well as a dry\nseason suitable for raising livestock and some farming. Western Chaco, which is closer to the Andes, is drier with\nless vegetation and is known for its high temperatures during the summer months. To the east, the Chaco region\nreceives more rainfall and has better soils for agriculture. The agrarian lifestyle dominates the cultural heritage\nof this region. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Chaco region attracted a large number of Mennonite immigrants from\nCanada and Russia who established successful farming operations mainly on the Paraguay side of the border and\nalso extending into Argentina.\nTo the east of the northern region\u2014on the other side of the Paran\u00e1 River and reaching to the banks of the Uruguay\nRiver\u2014is the region called Mesopotamia, whose name means \u201cbetween rivers.\u201d This unique region has a variety\nof features, from flatlands for grazing livestock to subtropical rain forests. The most noteworthy feature is the\nexpansive Iguaz\u00fa Falls on the Iguaz\u00fa River, located on the border of Brazil and Argentina. It is a series of 275\nparallel waterfalls that are just short of two miles across. It has the greatest average annual flow of any waterfall\nin the world. Most of the falls are more than 210 feet high; the tallest is 269 feet. The spectacular Iguaz\u00fa Falls is\na major tourist attraction, drawing people from all over the world. 445 World Regional Geography\nFigure 6.37 The Iguaz\u00fa Falls on the Iguaz\u00fa River on the Border between Brazil and Argentina\nThe headwaters of the Iguaz\u00fa River are near Curitiba in Brazil. The river converges with the Paran\u00e1 River about 14 miles downstream\nfrom the Iguaz\u00fa Falls at the point where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet\u2014called the Triple Frontier. The falls is approximately\n1.7 miles along its edge, which is divided by rocky islands on both the Argentinean and Brazilian sides. The Iguaz\u00fa Falls are a major\ntourist attraction for the region.\nJeffrey Bary \u2013 Iguazu Falls \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Cuyo region is located along the Andes Mountains in the west central part of the country. Mt. Aconcagua\nis located here, along with other high mountain peaks. This arid region gets most of its moisture from melting\nsnow off the mountains, which irrigate the rich agricultural lands that produce fruits and vegetables. The Cuyo is\na major wine-producing region; it accounts for up to three-quarters of the country\u2019s wine production. Picturesque\nvineyards and farms make the Cuyo a favorite tourist destination in Argentina. Mendoza is the country\u2019s fourth-\nlargest city. Low mountain ranges form the eastern border between the Cuyo and the Pampas.\nThe Pampas is a large agricultural region that extends beyond Argentina and includes a large portion of Uruguay\nand the southern tip of Brazil. With adequate precipitation and a mild type C climate, the Pampas is well suited for\nboth agriculture and human habitation. The rich agricultural lands of the Pampas include the largest city and the\ncountry\u2019s capital, Buenos Aires, which is home to up to a third of the nation\u2019s population. The Pampas provides\nsome of the most abundant agricultural production on the planet. The western grasslands host large haciendas\n(prestigious agricultural units) with cattle ranching and livestock production. This area has elevated Argentina\nto its status as a major exporter of beef around the world. Agricultural production has been a major part of the\nnation\u2019s economy. One hundred years ago, the export of food products made Argentina one of the wealthiest\ncountries in the world. In today\u2019s global economy, the profit margins in agricultural products are not as lucrative, 6.4 The Southern Cone 446\nand industrialized countries have turned to manufacturing for national wealth. Argentina continues to have a\nstrong agricultural sector but has been increasing its industrial production in order to secure a strong economy.\nFigure 6.38 Rain Shadow Effect\nThe rain shadow effect in southern South America creates the Atacama Desert and an arid Patagonia.\nUniversity of Texas Librariers. 447 World Regional Geography\nPatagonia is a large expanse of the south that is semiarid because of the rain shadow effect. This area possesses\nenormous natural resources, including large amounts of oil and natural gas. Deposits of gold, silver, copper, and\ncoal can be found here. Raising livestock has been the main livelihood in Patagonia, which is otherwise sparsely\npopulated. Patagonia includes the southern region of Tierra del Fuego and the rugged Southern Andes, which\nhave some of the largest ice sheets outside Antarctica and many large glaciers that provide fresh water that feeds\nthe region\u2019s streams and rivers. Patagonia also has a number of scenic lakes. Abundant wildlife can be found\nalong the Atlantic coast, including elephant seals, penguins, albatrosses, and a host of other species. This region\ndemonstrates that Argentina is blessed with a variety of physical landscapes and natural resources that can help\nsupport its economy and its people.\nPopulation and Culture\nArgentina, with a population of about forty million, is a country of immigrants and a product of the colonial\ntransfer of European culture to the Western Hemisphere. During the colonial era, millions of people immigrated to\nArgentina from Western European countries such as France, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, Greece, the British\nIsles, and Scandinavia. Additional immigrants came from Eastern Europe and Russia. Eighty-five percent of the\npopulation is of European descent; the largest ethnic groups are Spanish and Italian. The Mestizo population is\nonly at about 8 percent. A small number of people from the Middle East or East Asia have immigrated and make\nup about 4 percent of the population. Less than 2 percent of Argentines declare themselves to be Amerindians.\nOld World European customs mix with New World Latin American traditions to form a cultural heritage unique\nto Argentina. This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets\nof society and culture can be found. With a population of about thirteen million\u2014one-third of Argentina\u2019s total\npopulation\u2014Buenos Aires is a world-class city. Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the\npopulation lives in cities. The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho\n(cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land. Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine\nin much of the country. The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in\nupscale night clubs. These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily\ninvested in the international trends of the modern world. The cultural landscape has become integrated with\nfashions and trends from across the globe. 6.4 The Southern Cone 448\nFigure 6.39 Palermo District, Buenos Aires\nThis photo illustrates the enormous expanse of the most populous area of Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nBlatant World \u2013 Palermo, the most populous district in Beunos Aires \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nPeople and Politics\nThe people of Argentina have a good standard of living, and the country is up-and-coming on a world scale. The\nmain problem has been the instability of the government during the twentieth century. The Argentine constitution\nprovides for a balance of powers between the judicial, legislative, and executive divisions, similar to that of the\nUnited States. For many decades in the twentieth century, the state vacillated between a democratically elected\ngovernment and military rule. The swings back and forth have been consistent and regular, which has wreaked\nhavoc on the economy, resulting in everything from hyperinflation to brutal authoritarian rule.\nAn example of the national swings in Argentina occurred between 1946 and 1955, when General Juan Per\u00f3n\nwas elected president. His wife, Eva (popularly known as Evita), became a public sensation. \u201cPeronism\u201d started\nout with populous support and a shift toward improving working conditions and increasing government spending.\nAt the same time, censorship, isolationism, and repression of civil rights were elevated to a point of social unrest.\nOpposition members were imprisoned or killed. Eva Per\u00f3n died of cancer in 1952, and Juan Per\u00f3n was eventually\nousted from office and fled to Spain. He later returned from exile to gain prominence in politics once again\nbut died in office in 1974. Other presidents came to power only to be deposed or ousted by military coups. 449 World Regional Geography\nThe instability in the political arena created problems for the economic sector, which had to deal with inflated\ncurrency and an unattractive environment for foreign investments. More recently, there has been some progress in\nstabilizing both the government and the economy, but political instability remains a factor. Argentina has abundant\nnatural resources, adequate infrastructure, and an educated work force. The country has all the necessary means\nto launch into the future with a strong economy\u2014as long as it is able to establish a stable government and a sound\neconomic agenda.\nChile\nChile is a long, narrow country on the western edge of southern South America. Chile is 2,500 miles long and only\n90 miles wide on average. This country borders the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Andes Mountains on the\nother. Chile has a variety of environmental zones, administrative districts, and climate patterns. Temperatures are\ncooler as one moves south toward Tierra del Fuego, which is split between Chile and Argentina. Rain has never\nfallen in select areas of northern Chile, which includes the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth and\nhome to one of the world\u2019s greatest copper and nitrate reserves. The sodium nitrates found in the Atacama Desert\nare used in plant fertilizers, pottery enamels, and solid rocket fuel.\nThe Rain Shadow Effect\nThe climate is due to the rain shadow effect. In northern Chile and the Atacama region, prevailing winds reach\nnorthern Chile from the east and hit the Andes Mountain chain, which are some of the highest mountains on the\ncontinent. The height of the Andes causes any moisture from rain clouds to precipitate on the eastern slopes. The 6.4 The Southern Cone 450\nwestern side of the Andes Mountains at that latitude receives little or absolutely no precipitation, causing extreme\ndesert conditions in the Atacama region of Chile. Southern Chile receives a large amount of rainfall because the\nprevailing winds at that latitude come from the west. Here the winds, which have picked up moisture over the\nSouth Pacific Ocean, hit the western side of the Andes. The air then precipitates out its moisture as it rises up\nthe mountainsides of the western slopes of the Andes. Less moisture reaches the eastern side of the mountains,\ncreating a rain shadow with arid and dry conditions for the region called Patagonia in southern Argentina. The\nAndes are not as high in elevation in the south, which allows some precipitation to fall on the rain shadow side.\nFigure 6.40 Mt. Fitz Roy\u2019s Rugged Landscape\nMt. Fitz Roy is in the Andes on the border between Chile and Argentina. The mountain range borders Patagonia on the Argentinean\nside in the remote region of the south. The village of El Chalt\u00e9n, which is the main access to the mountain, can be seen in the lower\nright of the photo. The unique terrain of the mountain is often photographed but seldom climbed.\nJosh and Erica Silverstein \u2013 Patagonia \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 451 World Regional Geography\nChile can be divided into three regions:\n1. Northern Chile, with the dry Atacama Desert\n2. Central Chile, with a mild type C climate, adequate rainfall, and good farmland\n3. Southern Chile, with lots of rainfall, rural, isolated islands, and mountains\nCentral Chile is the core region because it has a valuable port in Valparaiso and the country\u2019s capital city,\nSantiago, which is also Chile\u2019s most populous city. Central Chile is also home to more than 90 percent of the\ncountry\u2019s population.\nSocioeconomic Conditions\nThe people of Chile are 95 percent European and Mestizo. They have worked to establish a good education\nsystem and an increasing standard of living. The country had a relatively stable government until the 1970s\nwhen a short revolution brought a military dictatorship to power until 1989. The 1990s brought about a surge in\neconomic development that has continued into the twenty-first century. The political situation has stabilized, and\nthe first female president, Michelle Bachelet, was elected in 2006. The political system is faced with the unequal\ndistribution of wealth that is common in Latin America and many other countries of the world. Half the country\u2019s\nwealth is concentrated in the hands of about 10 percent of the population. About 50 percent of the population is\non the lower end of socioeconomic scale. Dire poverty exists in Chile, but it is not as prevalent here as it is in\nthe Central Andes, Paraguay, or Northeast Brazil. Chile has a thriving middle class that has made good use of the\nopportunities and education that Chile has offered them.\nChile is blessed with natural resources that include the minerals of the Atacama Desert, extensive fishing along the\ncoast, timber products from the south, and agricultural products from central Chile. All these factors have brought\nabout an emerging development boom and have attracted international trading partners. The stable government\nand the growing economy have successfully kept inflation low, kept employment high, reduced poverty, and\nbrought in foreign investment. In the globalized economy, Chile has managed to work with various trading\npartners to increase its advantages and opportunities in the international marketplace. 6.4 The Southern Cone 452\nChile and NAFTA\nChile has been increasing its trading activities with its counterparts in the Pacific Rim in Europe and North\nAmerica. Chile has an abundance of fish in its coastal waters and copper and minerals in the Atacama Desert and\nhas been exporting timber products from its southern region. The United States is one of Chile\u2019s main trading\npartners. Chile\u2019s main commodity exports to the United States include paper, minerals, metals, and copper. Major\nagricultural products that are shipped to the United States include processed fruits, tomatoes, grapes, vegetables,\nand wines. There are several good reasons why the United States trades with Chile even though it is the farthest\ncountry from the United States in South America. International trade and the seasonal patterns of agriculture have\nmuch to do with the benefits. The seasonal variations between the northern and southern hemisphere create a\nbalance between the two. When it is winter in the north, it is summer in the south. Each has an opposing growing\nseason for fruits and vegetables that can complement the other. Chile is an excellent counter to the opposite\ngrowing season in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIf you recall Section 5.2 \u201cMexico\u201d on Mexico and NAFTA, you will remember that after NAFTA was\nimplemented, Chile was considered a \u201csilent\u201d partner. In 1994 during a summit meeting, the president of Mexico,\nCanada\u2019s prime minister, and the US president agreed to allow Chile to join the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA). Chile\u2019s president declared his support for his country to join NAFTA. The agreement could\nnot be completed because of negotiation approval by the US Congress. At this time Chile entered into independent\nfree trade agreements with both Canada and Mexico. A free trade agreement was later signed between the US\nand Chile in 2003. Thus, Chile has free trade agreements with all three North American countries and can benefit\nby the mutual agreements that parallel NAFTA. In this situation, Chile is an associate trading partner and enjoys\nthe privileges of NAFTA membership without technically being listed as a member. The United States was really\nlooking to counter Chile\u2019s trade with Japan and Europe. Increased trade with North America diminished Chile\u2019s\ntrade with the European Union or the East Asian community.\nAs copper and natural resource prices fluctuate, creating unstable economic conditions, Chile has been expanding\ninto the manufacturing sector. To retain the highest value-added profits and expand its economy, Chile will have to\nenlarge its manufacturing sector. Today Chile produces modest quantities of basic chemicals and electronic goods.\nChile\u2019s expansion of business and commerce has been endorsed as a model of successful economic development\nto be emulated by other Latin American countries.\nFigure 6.41 NAFTA Members and US Dollar Users as of 2010 453 World Regional Geography\nChile is not a full member of NAFTA but has separate free-trade agreements with all three NAFTA countries and is\nconsidered an unofficial member.\nUniversity of Texas Librariers.\nChile has strong ties to the economies of North America, but in spite of close ties with the north, Chile has\nretained its unique status in the Southern Cone. Chile still has its own currency even though countries with smaller\neconomies, such as Ecuador and El Salvador, have adopted the US dollar as their medium of exchange. As of\n2010, the NAFTA members of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, along with their trading partner of Chile,\nall used different currencies. The US dollar is the most widely used currency in the world and is also used in other\nLatin American countries. There has been talk of creating a similar currency within NAFTA called the Amero that 6.4 The Southern Cone 454\nwould replicate the European Union\u2019s solution, which was to create a single currency, the euro. World currencies\nfluctuate in value, and a stable currency would increase the capacity for creating larger trading blocs that could\ndo business on a more even economic playing field. Chile has individual free-trade agreements with all three\nmembers of NAFTA, so any change in currency with the NAFTA countries would also affect Chile.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Southern Cone possesses large, diverse physical landscapes. Variations in terrain include tall Andean\nmountain peaks, desert conditions, prairie grasslands, and semitropical regions to the north.\n\u2022 The Southern Cone is an urban realm with high percentages of the population living in large cities. Primate\ncities dominate each country. Large sections of each country\u2019s interior make up the extensive rural periphery\nwith activities based on natural resources.\n\u2022 The Southern Cone is a European commercial area, and more than 85 percent of the population is of\nEuropean ancestry. There are few Amerindian minorities or immigrants from Africa or Asia in the Southern\nCone.\n\u2022 Argentina is a large country in physical area and has a number of important regions that provide\nopportunities for economic prosperity. The country, however, has lacked a stable government and a\nconsistent business climate to take advantage of Argentina\u2019s favorable geographic situation.\n\u2022 Chile has emerged on the global stage as a model for economic growth and stability. Its people have a\nhigher standard of living, and the country has abundant natural resources. Chile has been a trading partner\nwith NAFTA countries.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

The\nAndes, the longest mountain chain in the world, run from Venezuela to southern Chile. The Amazon River\nhas the largest flow of water of any river on Earth, and the Amazon Basin is home to the world\u2019s largest\ntropical rain forest. Rain forests cover less than 5 percent of the earth\u2019s surface but have the richest\nbiodiversity of any biome (environmental region), holding up to 50 percent of the world\u2019s organisms.\n\u2022 All of South America except for the Guianas was colonized by Spain and Portugal. The Guianas were\nlocated along the coast, where plantation agriculture was prominent. African slaves were the main labor\nbase on the plantations. When slavery was abolished, slaves were replaced by indentured servants from the\nAsian colonies. Most of the population in Guyana and Suriname is from Asia. The cultural geography of\nSouth American can be understood by identifying the cultural regions formed by the majority ethnic groups\nthe human activity in which they are engaged.\n\u2022 Venezuela and Colombia dominate the countries of northern South America. Venezuela is an urban country,\nand much of its wealth is generated from the export of oil. Colombia is mountainous with vast tropical\nforests bordering the Amazon. Illegal drugs, oil, and coffee are Colombia\u2019s three main export products. The\nUnited States is the main buyer of these products. The control of the physical territory of Colombia is\ndivided between the government, drug cartels, and insurgent groups.\n\u2022 South America\u2019s Andean West region was the home to the ancient Inca Empire, which was conquered by\nSpanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1533. Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia have regions with high\nelevations in the Andes, including the Altiplano region with Lake Titicaca. Most of the population is\nAmerindian and holds to the customs and traditions of their heritage. Oil and mineral resources have been a\nmain source of wealth for the region, but the profits have not always reached the majority population;\ninstead, they the wealth is often are held by a minority at the top of the socioeconomic layer.\n\u2022 Brazil was colonized by Portugal, which gave the country the Portuguese language and the Catholic faith.\nDuring the colonial era, a large number of African slaves were introduced to the country, which added to the\ncountry\u2019s multicultural society. Many other Europeans and Japanese also immigrated to Brazil. The\ncountry\u2019s large size allows for diverse human activities. The core urban area is located along the southeast\ncoast, where the large cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are located. The forward capital of Brasilia is\npositioned inland on the edge of the core area.\n456 457 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 The rural periphery of Brazil includes the large Amazon Basin, with tropical rain forests and large\nundeveloped regions. Originally inhabited by Amerindian groups, the Amazon Basin is being developed for\nagriculture, mining, and the timber industry. This type of development is devastating large tracts of rain\nforest and placing increasing pressure on the few remaining indigenous groups. Large mining operations\nhave fueled development, causing serious environmental concerns over habitat loss and the destruction of\nthe tropical rain forest.\n\u2022 The Southern Cone region of South America has a wide range of physical landscapes, from the semitropical\nareas of the north to the arid grasslands of the south in Patagonia. The Atacama Desert on the west coast is a\nproduct of the rain shadow effect from the high Andes. The rich agricultural lands of the Pampas are the\nbreadbasket of the region, producing large amounts of grain and livestock. Coastal areas are good for fishing\nand allow access to foreign markets.\n\u2022 The southern regions of South America also have heavily European populations. There are few Amerindians\nor people of African heritage. Most people live in urban areas, and one-third of Argentineans live in Buenos\nAires. Chile has been a major trading partner with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nnations and has a stable and growing economy. Argentina is a large country in physical area and has great\npotential for economic development. Chapter 7: Subsaharan Africa\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nSubsaharan Africa includes the African countries south of the Sahara Desert. The African Transition Zone cuts\nacross the southern edge of the Sahara Desert at the widest portion of the continent. Many of the countries in the\nAfrican Transition Zone are included in the realm of Subsaharan Africa. The realm can be further broken down\ninto regional components: Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, and Southern Africa. At the eastern end\nof the African Transition Zone is the Horn of Africa, which is often included in the region of East Africa. Maps\nvary in terms of which countries are included in each region, but this general geographic breakdown is helpful\nin identifying country locations and characteristics. Madagascar is a large island off the southeastern coast of\nAfrica and is usually not included with the other regions because its geographic qualities and biodiversity are quite\ndifferent from the mainland.\nThe continent of Africa is surrounded by salt water. The Indian Ocean borders it on the east, and the Atlantic is\non the west. The southern tip of the continent\u2014off South Africa\u2014is often referred to as the Cape of Good Hope,\nwhere the Atlantic Ocean meets the Indian Ocean. The continent of Africa has a number of small island groups\nthat are associated with the realm and are independent countries. Approximately 350 miles off the coast of West\nAfrica in the North Atlantic are ten islands that make up the independent country of Cape Verde. Just south of\nNigeria on the eastern side of the Gulf of Guinea near the equator are the two islands that make up the independent\ncountry of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, a former Portuguese colony. The small country of Equatorial Guinea also\nincludes an island off the coast of Cameroon where its capital is located. Three island groups in the Indian Ocean\naround Madagascar include the independent countries of the Seychelles, Comoros, and Mauritius.\n458 459 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.1 The Continent of Africa\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries. 7.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Summarize the basic geography of Subsaharan Africa. Identify the African Transition Zone, including the\ntransitions that are occurring in the zone. Locate the main features on a map.\n2. Understand how early kingdoms flourished in Subsaharan Africa before the colonial era. Identify how\nselective groups in these kingdoms participated in the supply operations for the slave trade.\n3. Explain how European colonialism divided up Africa and the role the Berlin Conference played in the\ncolonization process in Africa.\n4. Outline how countries have transitioned from colonies to independent nations, including the many issues\ninvolved in this transition.\nThere is considerable variation with respect to how the regions of Subsaharan Africa are delineated or identified\non maps. The debate is not about what regions are in Subsaharan Africa but rather about which countries are to\nbe included within each region. The regions have both similarities and differences. The cultural geography varies\nwidely from country to country and from one ethnic group to another, but at the same time, there are shared\ncultural patterns across all Subsaharan African regions. For example, colonialism has been a major historical\nfactor in the shaping of the countries. Families are large, and rapid rural-to-urban shift is occurring in all regions.\nEvery region has large urban centers\u2014often port cities that act as central core locations supported by a large\nperipheral rural hinterland.\nGlobalization has entered into the dynamics connecting these once-remote regions with the rest of the world.\nAdvancements in communication and transportation technology have created networks connecting Africa with\nglobal markets. Subsaharan Africa has a young population that is on the move, seeking to gain from any\nopportunities or advantages it can find. The political arena is dynamic: changes in political leadership through\ncoups or military takeovers are common, as is authoritarian rule. Subsaharan Africa is home to some of the poorest\ncountries in the world. Poverty is evident in the countryside and in the urban slums of the largest cities. Bitter civil\nwars are a part of every region\u2019s history. Violence and conflicts continue in some areas, while other areas exhibit\npolitical stability and thriving economies. The diversity in human geography is the most noteworthy dynamic in\nSubsaharan Africa. The variety of ethnic groups along with the multiplicity of languages and religious affiliations\ncreate strong centripetal and centrifugal forces that interact in a thriving sea of cultural diversity.\nMost of the population lives an agrarian lifestyle, but there are people who are developing the skills necessary to\nadapt to the rapid globalization wave that is importing new technology and new ideas to the continent. The urban\ncore areas of the continent are the main focus of the global trends in technology and communication. These urban\ncore areas exhibit the typical dynamics of the core-periphery spatial relationship. Subsaharan Africa has many\ncore areas and many peripheral areas. The core urban centers have political power thanks to the social elites who\nhave connections to the global economy and often dominate political activities.\n460 461 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.2 Regions of Africa\nTo help identify places discussed in this book, Africa has been divided into regions along traditional boundaries.\nUpdated from map courtesy of Andreas 06.\nThese core urban areas are often magnets for people from large families in rural peripheral areas seeking\nemployment. Millions of people in Africa who seek employment are willing to migrate to the cities or even other\ncountries to find work. The rural immigrants are often not of the same ethnic group as those in power, which sets\nup the basis for discriminatory policies that disadvantage the many minority groups that are not affiliated with the\ngovernment. These dynamics can fuel protest activities with a goal of overthrowing the powerful elite. Various\nideas have been proposed to help level the socioeconomic playing field. One of the more prominent options is the\nimplementation of a democratic government, where most of the people have a stake in electing those that hold\npositions of leadership and power.\nBroad patterns and dynamics of people and places are replicated throughout the Subsaharan realm. The regions\nshare common demographic trends of large family sizes, agrarian lifestyles, and low income levels. The patterns\nof an economy based on agricultural production and mineral extractive activities as well as disruptive changes in\npolitical leadership are common throughout the continent. Each region has diverse ethnic groups and an array of 7.1 Introducing the Realm 462\ndifferent languages. South of the African Transition Zone, the most prevalent belief systems are Christian based\nand animist, while north of the zone, Islam is widespread. Division and civil unrest can occur where the different\nreligions meet and compete for political control. These concepts will bear repeating throughout the chapter. The\ncultural mosaic of Subsaharan Africa is vast and complex, and this chapter will outline the basic trends and\npatterns with specific examples that will help place it all in perspective.\nPhysical Geography of Subsaharan Africa\nThe African Transition Zone divides North Africa from the rest of Africa because of climatic and cultural\ndynamics. Cultural conflicts and desertification are common in the zone. Dry, arid type B climates, common in the\nSahara Desert, are dominant north of the zone. Tropical type A climates prevail south of the zone. Global climate\nchanges continue to shape the continent. The shifting sands of the Sahara are slowly moving southward toward\nthe tropics. Desertification in the zone continues as natural conditions and human activity place pressure on the\nregion through overgrazing and the lack of precipitation. Type B climates resurface again south of the tropics in\nthe southern latitudes. The Kalahari and Namib Deserts are located in Southern Africa, mainly in the countries\nof Botswana and Namibia.\nFor a continent as large as Africa, Subsaharan Africa does not have extended mountain ranges comparable to the\nranges in North or South America, Europe, Asia, or Antarctica. There are, however, on the Ethiopian Highlands\nthe Ethiopian Plateau that reach as high as 15,000 feet in elevation. East Africa has a number of well-known\nvolcanic peaks that are high in elevation. The tallest point in Africa\u2014Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania near the\nborder with Kenya\u2014is 19,340 feet high. Nearby in Kenya, Mt. Kenya is 17,058 feet high. The Rwenzori\nMountains on The Congo\/Uganda border reach more than 16,000 feet in elevation and create a rain shadow effect\nfor the region. Permanent glaciers exist on these ranges even though they are near the equator. On the western\nside of the continent, Mt. Cameroon in Central Africa is more than 13,000 feet in elevation. The South Africa\u2019s\nCape Ranges are low-lying mountains no higher than about 6,000 feet. The continent of Africa consists of basins\nand plateaus without long mountain chains. The plateaus can range more than 1,000\u20132,500 feet in elevation. The\nonly continuous feature is the eastern rift valleys that run along the tectonic plate boundaries from the Red Sea\nthrough to South Africa. 463 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.3 A Giraffe with Mt. Kilimanjaro in the Background, Located in Tanzania on the Border with Kenya\nAfrica has many scenic areas and many national parks set aside as game preserves, which have become major tourist attractions for\nworld travelers.\nDiana Robinson \u2013 Two elephants doing a mock battle \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nThe main rivers of Africa include the Nile, Niger, Congo, and Zambezi. The Nile River competes with the\nAmazon for the status as the longest river in the world; the White Nile branch begins in Lake Victoria in East\nAfrica, and the Blue Nile branch starts in Lake Tana in Ethiopia. The Niger flows through West Africa; its mouth\nis in Nigeria. The Congo River crosses the equator with a large tropical drainage basin that creates a flow of water\nsecond only to the Amazon in volume. The Zambezi River in the south is famous for the extensive Victoria\nFalls on the Zambia and Zimbabwe border. Victoria Falls is considered the largest waterfall in the world. Other\nsignificant rivers exist such as the Orange River, which makes up part of the border between South Africa and\nNamibia.\nThere are a number of large lakes in Subsaharan Africa. The largest is Lake Victoria, which borders several East\nAfrican countries and is considered to be the second-largest lake in the world in surface area. Only Lake Superior\nin North America has a greater surface area. A number of large lakes are located in the rift valleys of the east.\nThree of the largest lakes along the western rift are Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Albert. To the\nnortheast of these in Kenya is Lake Turkana, which reaches to the Ethiopian border. Lake Chad is located in the\nAfrican Transition Zone on the border between Chad, Mali, and Nigeria. Lake Chad has been severely reduced in\nsize in recent years.\nThe equator runs through the center of Subsaharan Africa, providing tropical type A climates. These regions\nusually have more rainfall, resulting in lighter, leached-out soils that may not be as productive as regions with\nricher volcanic soils, such as those found in the rift valleys. Root crops are common in Africa, as are millet and\ncorn (maize). The savanna regions of the east and south have seasonal rains that affect the growing season. Soils\nin savanna areas are usually not as productive and cannot be depended on to fulfill the agricultural needs of 7.1 Introducing the Realm 464\ngrowing populations. Savannas are usually grasslands or scrub forests with a seasonal precipitation pattern. Cattle\nand livestock grazing are common in savannas, and migrations are frequent to follow seasonal grazing conditions.\nIn specific areas of Southern Africa, larger farming operations exist in type C climates. However, Subsaharan\nAfrica is not blessed with the large regions of rich alluvial soils found in the Northern Hemisphere. The ever-\ngrowing agrarian population has always depended on the land for food and sustenance, but these conditions are\nnot favorable for Africa\u2019s future. Populations are growing faster than any increase in agricultural production.\nIncreasing populations in Subsaharan Africa are taxing the natural environment. Where the carrying capacity\nhas been exceeded, the natural capital is being depleted at an unsustainable rate. Deforestation is occurring in\nareas where firewood is in high demand, and trees are cut down faster than they can grow back. Expanding\nhuman populations are also encroaching on the natural biodiversity for which the African continent is renowned.\nLarge game animals such as rhinoceroses, elephants, and lions have been hunted or poached with devastating\nconsequences. The creation of game preserves and national parks has stemmed this tide, but poaching remains\na serious problem even in these protected areas. Gorilla and chimpanzee populations have also been stressed by\nhuman population growth. These animals are being killed by humans for bush meat, and their habitats are being\nreduced by human activities.\nFigure 7.4 Physical Features of Subsaharan Africa 465 World Regional Geography\nSubsaharan Africa does not have long mountain chains such as those found in the other continents. The Nile, Congo, and Niger\nRivers are the main waterways. The Namib and Kalahari are the main deserts south of the African Transition Zone. The Great Rift\nValleys are the longest physical features in East Africa.\nKingdoms, Empires, and the Slave Trade\nWest Africa was home to a number of large empires that shaped the culture and people of present-day Africa.\nGold, salt, copper, and ivory were important early trading commodities. Mining and acquiring these items brought\nenormous wealth to the region. Slavery became a component in the warfare between groups, as the winner usually 7.1 Introducing the Realm 466\ntook the captives to serve as servants or slaves. The Ghana Empire (790\u20131076 CE) was responsible for one of\nthe early consolidations of power in West Africa. Though its power and wealth were vast, it was only the first of\na number of empires to arise in the region.\nAfter the Ghana Empire came the Mali Empire (1230\u20131600 CE), which was known for its wealth and size. The\nempire held major mining operations including gold, copper, and salt. Expanding along the Niger River and to the\nAtlantic coast, the Mali Empire extended over an area the size of Western Europe. Originally a federation of local\ngroups, the empire incorporated many smaller provinces or kingdoms and had a major influence on the region\u2019s\nlaws and cultural heritage.\nFigure 7.5 Empires of West Africa\nThe Niger River and the main empires of West Africa are indicated on this map. The shaded region indicates the furthest expanse of\nthe Songhai Empire at its peak in the sixteenth century.\nUpdated from map courtesy of Andreas 06 467 World Regional Geography\nOne of the indigenous states that evolved out of the Mali Empire was that of the Songhai people, who were located\nto the east of the main Mali Empire. The Songhai had been based around the city of Gao for centuries, and in\nfifteenth century, they established the Songhai Empire, one of the largest empires in African history. The city of\nTimbuktu became prominent during this period as an urban center, and its educational institutions became well\nknown. In the end, the Songhai Empire was defeated by Moroccan Berber forces that splintered the empire into\nmany smaller kingdoms and ethnic clans.\nSouth of the empires of the Niger River were coastal kingdoms, including the Ashanti and the Dahomey, which\nflourished during the colonial era. The local African groups had to contend with the colonial European traders and\ninvaders, which had superior weapons and different technology. Besides the mining resources of gold copper, salt,\nand ivory, the slave trade was a driving force that attracted trade ships from various European countries.\nThe Ashanti Empire was located along the Atlantic coast in an inland region of what is now Ghana and Ivory\nCoast; this area served as a trading corridor where goods from the northern regions crossed to make their way\nto the coastal trading towns. The Ashanti Empire took advantage of the trade opportunities and became wealthy.\nBy the time the Europeans arrived, Ashanti trade relationships were well established and capable of supplying\nthe colonial ships with slaves, ivory, and gold. The coastal area of Ghana was known as the Gold Coast during\ncolonial times. Similarly, the country of Ivory Coast (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) got its name from its participation in the\nelephant ivory trade. The Ashanti were known for their involvement in the slave trade and today must live with\nthat legacy.\nThis region of West Africa bordering the Atlantic was called the Slave Coast because of the high number of\nlocal people from this area who were sold into the European slave trade and shipped to the Americas. The once\npowerful Kingdom of Dahomey, east of the Ashanti Empire, was heavily involved in the slave trade. Slave\ntrading with Europeans brought them rifles and other firearms that were useful in conflicts with their regional\nadversaries. A major slave state along the Slave Coast, the kingdom attracted the spite of its neighbors as a pariah\nstate for selling its war captives into transatlantic slavery rather than killing them, as was the custom in warfare.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey became the country of Benin after the colonial era.\nThe slave trade brought wealth to many of the slave-trading kingdoms on the African coast. The demand for slaves\npushed many of the African kingdoms to expand their slave-trading activities, capturing more individuals whom\nthey could sell to European slave traders. Millions of Africans were captured by other Africans only to be sold\ninto slavery, placed on ships, and sent to slave owners in the Americas. The total number sold into the Atlantic\nslave trade will never be known, but estimates range somewhere between ten and twelve million. 7.1 Introducing the Realm 468\nFigure 7.6 The Door of No Return\nSlaves kept for shipment were held in dungeons awaiting the arrival of the slave ships. This was the last doorway that slaves from\nElmina, Ghana, saw on their way from the dungeon to the slave ship.\nPaul Arps \u2013 Dungeon entrance Elmina Castle \u2013 CC BY.\nStates and kingdoms existed throughout Subsaharan Africa. Early kingdoms flourished in the region that is now\nEthiopia. East Africa\u2019s Axum Empire was an example of the powers of the early African savanna kingdoms\nlocated in the east. The struggles between Islam and Christianity divided the region and gave way to the African\nTransition Zone, which serves as the dividing line between the two religions. Ethiopia has retained its Christian\nheritage, while to the north and east Islam has prevailed. South of the equator, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe\ngive testimony to the regional base of power that existed there in centuries past. The Zulu Empire thrived in the\nnineteenth century in the region that is now South Africa. 469 World Regional Geography\nColonialism in Subsaharan Africa\nWherever you go in the world, you cannot escape the impact of European colonialism. Subsaharan Africa was\nbroadly affected by colonial activities, the legacy of which can be recognized to this day. Colonial powers of\nEurope ventured into Africa to claim colonies. In the discussion on Brazil in Chapter 6 \u201cSouth America\u201d, Section\n6.3 \u201cBrazil\u201d, there is segment on slavery and the Trade Triangle of the North Atlantic. Slavery impacted Africa in\nother ways. Many African groups were instrumental in capturing and holding slaves to trade with the European\nmerchants. These groups still exist and have had to live with the fallout of their role in the supply side of the slave\ntrade.\nBy 1900, European colonial powers claimed most of Africa. Only the Kingdom of Ethiopia and the area of\nLiberia, which was established as a home for freed slaves, remained independent. In 1884, Otto von Bismarck\nof Germany hosted the Berlin Conference, which to a great degree determined how Africa was colonized. This\nconference included fourteen colonial European countries and the United States, and its purpose was to divide\nAfrica and agree on colonial boundary lines. Germany had few claims in Africa; Bismarck was hoping to benefit\nby playing the other countries against each other. At the time, more than 80 percent of Africa remained free of\ncolonial control. On a large map of Africa, claims were argued over and boundary lines were drawn according to\nEuropean agreements.\nThere was little regard for the concerns of local ethnic groups. Colonial boundaries divided close-knit\ncommunities into separate colonies. Ethnic boundaries were disregarded. Often-warring groups were placed\ntogether in the same colony. The Europeans, seeking profits from cheap labor and resources, did not consider the\nlocal people or culture and often employed brutal measures to subdue the local people. Most of the current borders\nin Africa are a result of the Berlin Conference, and many of the geopolitical issues that confront Africa today can\nbe traced back to this event specifically and to colonialism in general.\nEuropean colonialism remained strong in Africa until the end of World War II, which left many European\ncountries economically exhausted. In 1945, the United Nations (UN) was established. One of the primary UN\nobjectives was to oversee the decolonization of European colonies. Still, colonialism in Subsaharan Africa\nlingered on. It was not until the 1990s that the last colony was finally freed. The transition from colony to\nindependent nation itself caused conflict. Civil wars were fought over who would control the country after the\nEuropeans were pushed out. The transition to full independence has exacted a heavy toll from African countries\nbut has resulted in stronger political structures and greater democratic liberties in many cases. The first country to\ngain independence in Subsaharan Africa was Ghana in 1957. 7.1 Introducing the Realm 470\nFigure 7.7 Colonialism in Africa\nDuring the era of independence after World War II, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union\nenticed many of the African countries to support one or the other of the superpowers. The political pressure that\ndivided African countries during the Cold War has persisted and is the basis of some of the current political\nproblems. The European countries extracted raw materials and minerals from their African colonies, as well as\nslave labor. Varying degrees of attention were given to education, medical care, or infrastructure development.\nThe dependency that a colony had had on a European country for economic income in some cases continued long\nafter independence and may still continue today. On the other hand, major technology transfers from Europe to\nAfrica infused greater efficiencies into Africa\u2019s economic activities. The imperial nature of colonialism and the\ndivisive Cold War did bring about, in an unfortunate manner, the benefits of structured governments and greater\ndemocratic processes for many of the local areas of the realm.\nFigure 7.8 European Colonies in Africa, 1884 471 World Regional Geography\nUpdated from map courtesy of Andreas 06\nFrom Colonialism to Independence 7.1 Introducing the Realm 472\nFigure 7.9 Freedom Square in Ghana\nThis monument honors Ghana\u2019s independence in 1957 from the British.

In nearly\nall cases, removing the colonial powers from Africa was only half the battle toward independence. The other half\nwas establishing a functional, effective government.\nThough each country has taken a slightly different path, most former colonies have endured civil unrest, conflict,\nor warfare in their push for stable governments. Coups, fraudulent elections, military regimes, and corruption have\nplagued the leadership in a number of African countries. Civil unrest usually precedes a change in leadership:\npolitical power regularly changes hands by a military coup or an overthrow of the current leader.\nThe realm has had difficulty developing and maintaining effective political systems with democratic leadership.\nPolitical leaders have come and gone, many have been replaced before their terms were over, and a few have\nstayed long after their terms ended. When a leader is elected democratically, it is common to have widespread\naccusations of corruption, voter fraud, or ballot box scandals. Such government mismanagement and corruption\nhave been common problems.\nThe vacuum left by retreating colonial powers at times has been filled by authoritarian dictators or by leaders\nwho assumed control of the government and then proceeded to pillage and plunder the state for personal gain or\nfor the enrichment of their clan or political cronies. After the colonial era, it was not uncommon for new leaders 473 World Regional Geography\nto be connected to the old colonial power and to adopt the language and business arrangements of the European\ncolonizer. This gave them an advantage over their competitors and provided a means of income gained by the\nsupport of their former European colonial business partners, which often wanted to keep ties with their colonies to\ncontinue to exploit their resources for economic profits. Many of these leaders stayed in power because of military\nbacking or authoritarian rule funded by the profits from selling minerals or resources to their former colonial\nmasters.\nA few countries are still struggling to bring about some type of order and unity, and in spite of all the negative\nissues, there have been democratic and relatively stable progressive governments in Africa that have emerged\nfrom the transition in recent years, which is a hopeful trend for the long term.\nIt is important to note that the objective of colonialism was to connect a colony with the mother country, not to\nconnect African countries to each other. As a result, little cooperation occurs between African countries. Each\nindividual country interacts more with its European colonial counterpart with regard to trade, economics, and\ncultural dynamics. European colonialism has isolated African countries from their neighboring countries and does\nnot contribute to unity within or among African regions. Colonial powers often built new port cities to extract\ngoods and resources from their colonies and transportation systems from the new ports to the interior to collect\nthe resources and bring them to the port. However, the colonial powers did not build a network of transportation\nsystems that connected the region as a whole. Colonial powers were intent on continuing dependence on the\nmother country so their colonies could be controlled and dominated.\nThe current wave of globalization based on corporate colonialism continues to encourage the same pattern of\ndiscouraging interaction between counties and instead encouraging trade with more economically powerful non-\nAfrican countries. Most of the interaction between countries is a result of crisis or warfare, in which case large\nnumbers of refugees cross the border into neighboring countries for personal survival or security. To begin to\nwork together and promote trade, common transportation, security, and industry, fifteen West African states came\ntogether in 1975 to create the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Since then, additional\npolitical and economic agreements have been signed by various African countries. In 2001, the more expansive\nAfrican Union was created to help African states compete in the international marketplace.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Subsaharan Africa includes the African Transition Zone and the regions south of the Sahara. The African\nTransition Zone is a transitional zone between type A and type B climates and between the religions of\nIslam and Christianity.\n\u2022 Subsaharan Africa is a realm of plateaus and basins with four main river systems. Mountain ranges, volcanic\npeaks, and large lakes are found in or along the rift valleys of eastern Africa. The rift valleys were created\nby tectonic activity.\n\u2022 Before the colonial era, many African kingdoms dominated regions of Subsaharan Africa. West Africa had a\nnumber of great kingdoms. Kingdoms along the coast contributed to the slave trade.\n\u2022 European countries colonized almost the entire realm of Subsaharan Africa. European powers made\nagreements during the 1884 Berlin Conference to divide the realm and create boundary lines between their\nAfrican colonies. Many of the lines remain as the current borders today.\n\u2022 Colonies were designed to provide labor and resources to the mother country. Port cities, transportation 7.1 Introducing the Realm 474\nsystems, and other infrastructure were implemented to benefit the imperial power without regard for\ndevelopment of the colony.\n\u2022 African colonies received independence after World War II. The transition from colonies to independent\ncountries has been plagued by civil war, political chaos, or economic devastation.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Determine which of the countries in Subsaharan Africa are now experiencing civil war or national unrest\nover political leadership.\n2. Determine which countries of the realm have the most stable governments. 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa\nLearning Objectives\n1. Summarize how the core-periphery spatial relationship applies to Subsaharan Africa. Analyze how the\nconcept of rural-to-urban shift applies to the development pattern.\n2. Distinguish between the formal and informal sectors of the economy and understand how each would apply\nto the various core and peripheral regions of the realm.\n3. Explain how countries fit into the index of economic development model and the relationship between\nfamily size, urbanization rates and income levels.\n4. Understand the diversity of languages and religions in the realm. Develop a theory about why, with the\nincreasing population, the number of languages spoken decreases. Explain why many former European\ncolonies still retain the language of their colonizer as their lingua franca, or official language.\n5. Identify the various areas in Subsaharan Africa that have experienced devastating civil wars or political\nconflict in recent years.\n6. Outline the general pattern of HIV infections in the realm. Understand why it is difficult to contain and\nprevent the spread of AIDS.\n7. Explain why Subsaharan Africa has such great potential for economic development through tourism.\nArticulate the difficulties in creating a tourism market.\nEconomic Geography\nThe demographic data for each country in each region of Subsaharan Africa indicate the region\u2019s human\ngeography. Urban percentages, family size, income levels, and the other data that can indicate the lifestyle or\ndevelopment level are acutely helpful in understanding the trends in Subsaharan Africa. The index of economic\ndevelopment illustrates the dynamics and conditions that exist in the realm. The data indicate the consistency\nof economic and development trends across Africa. The data does not, however, indicate differences in cultural\ndynamics and uniqueness in the ways that local people live. The interesting part of studying Subsaharan Africa is\n476 477 World Regional Geography\nthe many ethnic and cultural groups in each country that bring to the surface a wide array of global diversity in our\nhuman community. Within each and every country are microcosms of human societies that hold particular customs\nthat may be thousands of years old. Globalization and technological advancements challenge every cultural group\nto adapt and innovate to make a living yet provide continuity in their heritage. The remote cultural groups of\nSubsaharan Africa are most susceptible to the volatile nature of globalization, which threatens their current way\nof life.\nSubsaharan Africa is a peripheral world region with neocolonial economic patterns. Peripheral regions usually\nsupply raw materials, food, and cheap labor to the core industrial countries. Most of the population in Subsaharan\nAfrica works in subsistence agriculture to make a living and feed their families. Families are large. In recent\ndecades, there has been enormous rural-to-urban migration to the major cities, which are extremely overcrowded.\nSubsaharan Africa has more than 750 million people, and most earn the US equivalent of only $1\u20133 per day.\nThere is no single major core economic area in Subsaharan Africa. This realm has many core cities and\nthe rest is periphery. Many of the core cities are improving their technology and infrastructure and entering\ninto the globalized economy. Even so, as much as 70 percent of the people still work in agriculture, leaving\nlittle time to develop a large educated group of professionals to assist with social services and administrative\nresponsibilities. The realm depends heavily on outside support for technical and financial assistance. Computers,\nmedical equipment, and other high-tech goods are all imported. African states have formed trade agreements and\nhave joined the African Union to assist each other in economic development and trade.\nFigure 7.10 Informal and Formal Sectors\nThe photo on the left is of side-street vendors in Senegal, who might contribute to the informal market system that is prevalent in 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 478\nmany Subsaharan African countries. Cash and bartering are the main methods of payment. The photo on the right is of a shopping\nmall in Zimbabwe, which is part of the formal market system that is regulated and taxed by the government.\nRadoslaw Botev; Gary Bembridge \u2013 Zimbabwe Harare Eastgate Shopping Mall \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSubsaharan Africa has nearly forty urban areas of more than one million people. At the center of the central\nbusiness districts (CBDs) are modern high-rise business offices well connected to the global economy. Outside the\nCBD are slums with no services and miserable, unsanitary conditions. The informal sector of the economy\u2014that\nwhich is not regulated, controlled, or taxed\u2014has become the primary system of doing business in most of the\ncities. The informal sector comprises trading, street markets, and any other business without financial records for\ncash transactions.\nThe lack of government regulation and control prevents taxes from being assessed or collected, which in turn\ndiminishes support for public services or infrastructure. The formal sector of the economy\u2014that which the\ngovernment can regulate, control, and tax\u2014is forced to foot the bill to operate the government and support public\nservices such as education, security, and transportation. In spite of the misery and unhealthy conditions of the\nslums where millions of people already live, more migrants from the countryside continue to shift to the city in\nsearch of jobs and opportunities. African cities are growing rapidly, many without organized planning.\nIf the index of economic development were applied to Subsaharan Africa, a clear pattern would emerge. Rural\nareas would be in the lower stages of development, and only a few developing areas would be higher than stage\n3. A large percentage of this realm would be in stage 1 or 2 of this model. Countries with higher standards of\nliving, such as South Africa or Botswana, would be working through stage 3 or 4. This region has one of the\nfastest-growing populations of the world and economically lags behind countries in the Northern Hemisphere,\nwhich have transitioned into the higher stages of the index of economic development.\nIncomes, Urbanization, and Family Size\nThe socioeconomic data illustrate well the conditions for people in Africa in comparison to the rest of the world.\nAfrican countries are at the lowest end of the statistics for development prospects. The larger cities are showing\npromise for advancement into the higher stages of development. Family sizes in the rural countries are some of\nthe largest in the world. The average fertility rate for much of Africa is about 5; in Mali and Niger, the rate is\nhigher than 7. One-third to half of the populations of these countries are under the age of fifteen. Children make 479 World Regional Geography\nup most of the population in many areas\u2014an indication that heavier burdens are placed on women, meaning that\nwomen are not easily able to get an education or work outside the home.\nFigure 7.11 Young Women and Child of the Maasai in Kenya\nDavida De La Harpe \u2013 maasai children \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nThe populations of West African countries are increasing rapidly and will double in about thirty years at the\ncurrent rate. This trend places an extra burden on the economy and on the environment. It is fueling one of the\nfastest rural-to-urban shifts in the world. West Africa is now only about 32 percent urban, and Burkina Faso and\nNiger are less than 20 percent urban\u2014clear indications that agriculture is the largest sector of their economies and\nthat most of the people live in rural areas or small villages. Personal income levels in West African countries are\namong the lowest in the world; as far as standard of living is concerned, these are poor countries. Few economic\nopportunities exist for the millions of young people entering the employment market. 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 480\nThe United Nations (UN) human development index lists all but two of West African countries in the lowest\ncategory of development. Sierra Leone is the lowest of the world. Ghana and Senegal were the two countries\nlisted in the medium range. Senegal is the lowest country in the medium category, just barely rising about the\nlowest tier. A country listed in the lowest tier of the medium category translates into a region with low availability\nof opportunities and advantages for its people. As a peripheral world region, the economic base is structured\naround agriculture with supportive extractive activities. Agricultural activities are renewable, but agricultural\nprofit margins are slim. These countries are in a subsistence mode with a rapidly expanding population and few\nindustrial or postindustrial activities to gain income.\nNo Subsaharan African nation is in stage 5 of the index of economic development. Nevertheless, the fact that\nthey are not consumer societies does not negate the rich cultural values and heritage of the realm. The energy of\nthe people does not revolve around consumerism but is instead focused on the people themselves. High levels of\nsocial interaction and community involvement bring about different cultural standards than those of a consumer\nsociety, which focuses more on the individual and less on community. Unless there is social unrest or open\nwarfare, which does exist in various places, the people work hard to bring about a civil society based on family\nand tradition.\nFigure 7.12 Population Pyramids of African Countries 481 World Regional Geography\nThe population pyramids of Niger, Tanzania, and South Africa illustrate the population growth dynamics of\nSubsaharan Africa. Niger\u2019s population pyramid illustrates large family size and rapid population growth.\nTanzania\u2019s pyramid is similar but shows signs of slowing population growth. South Africa, which is more\nurbanized and industrialized, shows signs of declining family sizes and fewer children.\nUS Census Bureau International Programs \u2013 public domain.\nLanguages in Subsaharan Africa\nSubsaharan Africa covers a large land area more than 2.3 times the size of the United States. Thousands of ethnic 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 482\ngroups are scattered throughout the realm. There is immense diversity within the 750 million people in Subsaharan\nAfrica, and within each country are cultural and ethnic groups with their own history, language, and religion.\nMore than two thousand separate and distinct languages are spoken in all of Africa. Forty are spoken by more\nthan a million people. Many local languages are not written down and have no historical record or dictionary.\nLocal languages without a written history are usually the first to be lost as globalization affects the realm. Nigeria,\nwith more than 130 million people, is the most populous country in Africa. It is about the size of Texas and\nOklahoma combined, and the African Transition Zone cuts through the country\u2019s northern portion. More than\nfive hundred separate languages are spoken in Nigeria alone. Three of the six dominant languages in Subsaharan\nAfrica\u2014spoken by at least ten million people or more\u2014are spoken in Nigeria: Hausa, Yoruba, and Ibo. The three\nremaining major languages of Subsaharan Africa are Swahili, Lingala, and Zulu.\nColonial activity changed much of how the African countries operated economically, socially, and politically.\nLanguage is one aspect of culture that indicates a colonial relationship. Many African countries today speak a\nEuropean language as the official language. Mauritania is the only country that has Arabic as its official language.\nNigeria has English plus other local languages. The official languages of most of West Africa are either French or\nEnglish, and Guinea-Bissau\u2019s official language is Portuguese.\nThis vestige of colonial power would seem inconsistent with the desire to be free of foreign domination. However,\nbecause often dozens to hundreds of local languages are spoken within the country, choosing the colonial language\nas the official language produces less of an advantage for one group wishing to dominate the political arena with\nits own local language and heritage.\nFor example, a language problem arises when a government needs to print material for the country. What language\ndo they use? In Nigeria, there would be more than five hundred possible languages. What if the leadership used\na language only spoken by a few people? The language of those in power would provide an advantage over\nthose that could not understand it. What if there were more than five hundred separate languages in Texas and\nOklahoma? How would they function? This is why many African countries have chosen a colonial language as\ntheir country\u2019s lingua franca, or national language. Ghana, which is the size of Minnesota, has more than eighty\nspoken languages. Ghana and Nigeria have both chosen English as their national language to provide a cohesive\nand inclusive method of addressing the language dilemma.\nA portion of the two thousand languages spoken on the African continent will not survive. A large number of the\nlanguages are spoken by a small number of local groups that may or may not have a written text or alphabet. The\ninfluence of globalization causes the country\u2019s lingua franca to overshadow local languages, which are relegated\nto the older generations that may not be fluent in the languages of global business and commerce. Young people\noften learn the lingua franca and may or may not pass their local language on to the next generation. This is how\nlanguages become extinct. Similar dynamics can be applied to local religious beliefs. Outside influence can often\nerode local beliefs and cause an evolution of religious tenets that eventually transform indigenous beliefs into\npatterns similar to the larger, more mainstream religions. 483 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.13 Language Families of Africa\nThere are six main language families with many variations of each. It is estimated that more than two thousand languages are spoken\nin all Africa.\nMap courtesy of Mark Dingemanse and Pmx \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0. 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 484\nReligion in Subsaharan Africa\nBefore the monotheistic religions from the Middle East were even in existence, the people of Africa followed\ntraditional animist beliefs. The diffusion of Christianity and Islam to the African continent convinced many\nAfrican people to abandon their animist beliefs. African religions spread with the slave trade and became a part of\nthe African Diaspora. Examples can be found in the Santeria religion in Cuba, Umbanda followers in Brazil, and\nVodou (Voodoo) practitioners in Haiti. Many of these examples indicate a high rate of mixing between traditional\nreligions and Christianity, something that is not as well accepted within Islam.\nThe current religious trends in Africa follow the pattern of the African Transition Zone. Most of the population\nnorth of the zone follows Islam, and most of the population living south of the zone follows Christianity. Large\npercentages of people in the region follow a wide array of traditional or animist beliefs. For example, as of 2010,\nmore than 50 percent of the people of Togo still followed local religions not affiliated with Christianity or Islam.\nOnly about 29 percent of the population claimed to be Christian, and even fewer claimed to follow Islam (Central\nIntelligence Agency).\nAlong the African Transition Zone, followers of one religion will clash with followers of the other. Countries\nsuch as Nigeria have a history of this type of social division, and Nigeria\u2019s government allows Islamic Sharia\nlaw to take precedence over civil law in the country\u2019s northern regions. For example, in 2002, the Miss World\nbeauty pageant was to be held in Nigeria\u2019s capital. At the same time, Nigerian news reported a case of a young\nwoman charged with adultery in Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria. The woman was to be stoned to death for\nher crime. Northern Nigeria is north of the transition zone and is staunchly Islamic. Southern Nigeria is mainly\nChristian or animist. The northern Muslims were protesting the \u201cdecadent\u201d Miss World beauty pageant, and riots\nspilled over into the streets. Buildings were burned, cars were overturned, and more than one hundred people were\nkilled. Meanwhile, people in the south were protesting the death sentence of the woman charged with adultery.\nContestants for the Miss World contest began to pull out of the competition, some in protest and some for personal\nsafety reasons. In the end, the woman sentenced to death was smuggled out of northern Nigeria to the safety of\nthe south. The Miss World contest was moved to London.\nBoth Islam and Christianity have been on the rise in Africa. As the local beliefs are replaced with monotheistic\nreligions, there is more integration with either the West (Europe and America) or the Middle East. Religious\nactivity through Christian missionaries or the advancement of Islam sometimes coincides with economic support\nbeing brought in through the same channels, which is often welcome and enhances the global relationships that\noccur.\nHowever, Africa is still full of traditional religions with rich spiritual histories. Spiritual forces are found in the\nenvironment. Deities of all kinds are worshipped throughout Africa. Christianity and Islam are latecomers to the\nregion but have made deep inroads into the African culture. Both compete for the souls of the African people. 485 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.14 Dominant Religions in Africa\nIslam is prominent north of the African Transition Zone, and Christianity is more prominent south of the African Transition Zone.\nUpdated from map courtesy of Andreas 06 \u2013 public domain. 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 486\nEthnic Divisions and Civil Wars\nSubsaharan Africa is home to thousands of ethnic or traditional groups. Each has a separate identity and history,\nand often one group is in conflict with another. The slave trade and the establishment of colonial political\nboundaries or policies exacerbated historical ethnic hostilities. Major civil wars have been fought throughout the\nhistory of throughout Subsaharan Africa and continue at the present time. Central Africa has endured ongoing\nbrutal conflict in the past decade, with no solution in sight. More than five million people have died as a result of\nthe civil war in The Congo (Zaire). Fighting continues between various factions over political control or control\nover natural resources, such as diamonds or gold. Civil wars are devastating some African countries. Many other\ncountries, such as Zimbabwe, Chad, and the Central African Republic, have also suffered economic disintegration\nas a result of severe political unrest.\nRwanda\u2019s Tutsi-Hutu conflict has been historic in its violence and in the senseless killing of innocent people. In\n1994, the centuries-old conflict erupted into violence of unprecedented proportions. Hutu militias took revenge\non the Tutsis for years of suppression and massacred anyone who did not support the Hutu cause. Tutsi rebels\nfinally gained strength, fought back, and defeated the Hutu militias. More than a million people were killed, and\nmore than a million defeated Hutus fled as refugees to neighboring countries, where many died of cholera and\ndysentery in refugee camps.\nFigure 7.15 Tragedy in Rwanda 487 World Regional Geography\nThe bones of victims killed in the Rwandan genocide are kept in this school in Rwanda. The total number of people killed in the war\nis unknown.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe civil war in Rwanda and the many refugees it created destabilized the entire Central African region. The shift\nin population and the increase in military arms along the Zairian border resulted in an extensive civil war in The\nCongo (Zaire) that has resulted in the deaths of more than five million people, many by disease or starvation.\nOver three million deaths are estimated to have been related directly to the war and another two million by the\nharsh conditions in the region (CBC). The civil wars in The Congo from 1996 to 2003 changed the cultural and\npolitical landscapes and destroyed valuable infrastructure. One of the driving forces in these wars is the control of\nvaluable mineral resources found in the Great Rift Valley along the eastern boundary of The Congo. Diamonds,\ngold, copper, zinc, and other minerals are abundant in this region, and wealth that can be gained from the mining\nof these products attracts political forces to compete for their control.\nCivil wars have wreaked havoc on the countries of Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Somalia. All have\nexperienced some amount of serious conflicts in the past decade. Many of the civil wars are not reported by the\nnews media worldwide, even though the number of people affected, injured, and killed is deplorable. In places\nsuch as Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, the streets have become a battleground.\nCreating stability in parts of Africa has been challenging, as civil unrest and political corruption continue in many\nAfrican countries. The core industrialized countries have been hesitant to step in or invest in the peace and stability\nof Africa. Governments of more than a few African countries have been unable to bring stability or to provide for\ntheir people. For example, Somalia has no central government; rather, it is ruled by warlords and village chiefs.\nCorruption, dictatorial rule, and military force have been major components of government rule in these cases. 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 488\nHIV and AIDS in Subsaharan Africa\nAs if Subsaharan Africa did not have enough to work through to achieve stability, it must also cope with high\nnumbers of people infected with HIV and AIDS. From South Africa to Kenya, there is a line of countries with\nsome of the highest percentages of HIV-infected people in the world. The HIV virus has infected more than 24\npercent of adults in Botswana, and some villages have lost an entire generation of adults to AIDS. The AIDS\npandemic has become a major health crisis for Subsaharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization,\nas many as thirty million people in this realm are HIV-infected.\nIt\u2019s possible to live with HIV for years before dying of AIDS. HIV-infected individuals can pass the virus to others\nwithout knowing they have it, and millions of people die of AIDS in Subsaharan Africa without ever knowing\nthey were infected. The lack of education, HIV testing, and medical services hinder progress toward stopping this\ndeadly disease. Prevention is an ideal that has not materialized yet. Many people do not want to be tested out of\nfear of rejection by their families and friends if they are infected. AIDS will surely kill millions more in Africa\nbefore a solution is found.\nMany other diseases are common in Subsaharan Africa. Some are spread by vectors in the environment.\nMosquitoes spread illnesses such as malaria and yellow fever, which are common throughout the realm. Sleeping\nsickness is spread by the tsetse fly, which can also infect cattle and livestock. Hepatitis is widespread.\nSchistosomiasis, tuberculosis, and typhoid are also common. Unsanitary conditions and polluted water are\nbreeding grounds for microbes that cause diseases. People living in less-than-sanitary conditions are more likely\nto come in contact with and become infected with these diseases and are also less likely to obtain medical attention\nat an early stage of the disease.\nFigure 7.16 HIV and AIDS 489 World Regional Geography\nThis map shows the estimated percentage of adults with HIV in Subsaharan Africa for each state based on best estimates by the\nWorld Health Organization and the UN.\nMap courtesy of Andreas 60 \u2013 public domain; data courtesy of UNAIDS 2010 Global Report \u2013 public domain.\nTourism Potential\nSubsaharan Africa has great potential for the development of tourism. Tourism is considered a postindustrial 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 490\nactivity with mixed income opportunities. If Africa can manage its resources and provide a safe environment for\ntravelers, tourism will have a strong impact on Africa\u2019s economic growth and will play a significant role in its\nfuture.\nTourism is a growing sector of the global economy. Travel and tourism jobs are increasing worldwide. Africa as a\nwhole attracts less than 5 percent of total world tourists and accounts for only a small percentage of international\ntourism income. Given the region\u2019s slim share of the tourism market and the expected dynamic growth of the\nsector worldwide, Africa can expect to substantially increase its share of global tourism activity.\nSubsaharan Africa has a strong supply-side potential to attract tourists. Beach resorts alone create a large draw\nfor tourists. The coastal waters of the Indian Ocean boast some of the finest beaches in the world, with plenty\nof opportunities for sailing, diving, or other water sports. South Africa is proud of its secluded beaches and\nbeautiful coastline. Other well-known coastal tourist destinations include Zanzibar-Tanzania, Benguerra Island in\nMozambique, and the Seychelles. Other areas with tourism potential are the wildlife parks and game preserves.\nCultural locations with a rich heritage of historical significance are growing in their attractiveness to and\naccessibility for world travelers.\nTourist Destinations in Subsaharan Africa\nAfrica excels in attracting tourists to its wildlife and game reserves. Safari tourism highlights exotic creatures, including\nelephants, lions, rhinos, hippos, and big game. Africa is full of extensive game reserves and national parks. The\nfollowing are some of the most visited animal safari destinations (* indicates a UNESCO World Heritage Site):\n\u2022 Kruger National Park, South Africa\n\u2022 Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania*\n\u2022 Amboseli Reserve, Kenya\n\u2022 Serengeti National Park, Tanzania*\n\u2022 Kalahari Game Reserve, Botswana\n\u2022 Berenty Nature Reserve, Madagascar\n\u2022 Virunga (Gorilla) National Park, Congo (Zaire)*\nSubsaharan Africa is replete with natural features or attractions that tourists gravitate toward, particularly tourists who\nare in search of outstanding scenic sites or desire an environmental adventure. There are dozens of awe-inspiring 491 World Regional Geography\nnational parks throughout Africa. The following are some of the more interesting physical geography locations in\nSubsaharan Africa (* indicates a UNESCO World Heritage Site):\n\u2022 Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania*\n\u2022 Mt.

National Park, South Africa\nCultural and heritage tourism has grown immensely in recent years. Cultural assets and heritage landscapes have always\nprovided for excellent tourist attractions. Subsaharan Africa has a great wealth of culture and heritage to attract tourists.\nThe following are a few of the most well-known cultural destinations in the realm (* indicates a UNESCO World\nHeritage Site):\n\u2022 Timbuktu (Tombouctou), Mali*\n\u2022 St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Ivory Coast\n\u2022 Ashanti-National Cultural Center, Ghana*\n\u2022 Great Zimbabwe Ruins, Zimbabwe*\n\u2022 Robben Island, South Africa*\n\u2022 Soweto City Tour, South Africa\n\u2022 Rock City of Lalibela, Ethiopia*\n\u2022 Ancient City of Abomey, Benin*\nFigure 7.17 African Elephants 7.2 Human Geography of Subsaharan Africa 492\nWildlife and big game are natural resources for tourism. Countries in Subsaharan Africa have created many protected areas for\nwildlife.\nMichael Jansen \u2013 Afrikanische Elefanten \/ African Bush Elephants \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nEvery African country, urban center, or rural village is its own unique tourism magnet. The tourism business,\nhowever, is broader than just the sites themselves. Considerations need to be made for transportation to and from\nthe country and final destination. Hotels and guest accommodations, such as food services, restaurants, and the\navailability of other types of consumer goods, need to be considered. Services need to be available that link the\nvarious components of a trip, such as guide services in national parks or city bus tours. The attractiveness and\ncompetitiveness of each tourism destination will depend on the site\u2019s quality and accessibility.\nA serious financial investment is needed to bring Subsaharan Africa up to par with the global marketplace. Africa\nhas huge potential for growth in its tourism market. Unfortunately, the same problems with tourism that were\ndiscussed in the lesson on tourism in the Caribbean (Chapter 5 \u201cMiddle America\u201d, Section 5.4 \u201cThe Caribbean\u201d)\ncan be applied to Africa. There are many positive and negative aspects to tourism, and a trade-off is usually\nneeded. Heavy tourism traffic might have a negative impact on the environment, cultural stereotypes tend to be\nexploited, and the disparity between wealthy tourists and service workers earning a modest wage may lend itself\nto divisions and social friction.\nTourism demands higher levels of security and public health at all levels. Money spent on tourism development is\nmoney not spent on schools or clinics. On the other hand, without the tourism income, there are no jobs. Tourism\nbrings to the surface both centrifugal and centripetal cultural forces. To be successful, Africa will need to balance\nout the economic need for tourism with its willingness to comply with the requirements of the tourism industry.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Subsaharan Africa\u2019s many core cities and peripheral regions create a high rural-to-urban shift. Much of the\nrealm\u2019s economic activity is conducted in the informal sector. 493 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 Most countries in this realm are in the earlier stages of the index of economic development. The integration\ninto global markets has brought urbanization and development to many of the major core cities.\n\u2022 The informal sector dominates many of the economic activities in Subsaharan Africa. The emergence of\nstable governments and economic structures usually results in a stronger formal sector of the economy,\nwhich in turn provides improved national infrastructure.\n\u2022 Subsaharan Africa is realm with a high diversity of languages and religions. In an attempt to provide an\nequal footing for all languages, many countries have chosen their colonial language as their official\nlanguage to avoid giving speakers of one language any political advantage over another.\n\u2022 Parts of Subsaharan Africa continue to experience social unrest and civil war. Armed conflicts in Rwanda\nand The Congo (Zaire) have either killed or affected millions of people.\n\u2022 A high percentage of people in Subsaharan Africa are infected with HIV\u2014up to one-fourth of the\npopulation of some countries. Health care, education, and cultural forces are important factors in combating\nAIDS and the tropical diseases common in the realm.\n\u2022 Subsaharan Africa has enormous potential to exploit their physical features and cultural heritage to expand\ntheir tourism market. It is often difficult to balance the investments for adequate infrastructure and services\nrequired for tourism with other needs, such as education and health care.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the main geographic aspects of each country in West Africa.\n2. Understand each country\u2019s development pattern and their current political situation.\n3. Explain how family size and economic activities are related to population growth.\n4. Outline the main economic activities of each country and how they are related to natural resources.\nThe region of West Africa includes the southern portion of the bulge of the continent, which extends westward\nto the Atlantic Ocean. This region is bisected by the African Transition Zone, which borders the southern edge\nof the Sahara Desert. The main physical features include the Sahara Desert and the Niger River. The Cameroon\nHighlands are located on the eastern border between Nigeria and Cameroon. At 4,100 miles long, the Nile River\nis the longest, while the Congo River is Africa\u2019s second longest at 2,922 miles in length. The Niger River is\nAfrica\u2019s third-longest river and extends more than 2,600 miles from the Guinea Highlands through Mali, Niger,\nand Nigeria before reaching the Atlantic Ocean in the Gulf of Guinea.\nSome geographers include the country of Chad or portions of it within the region of West Africa. In this textbook,\nChad is listed with Central Africa. The portions of Chad located north of the African Transition Zone share\nsimilar characteristics with North Africa. Off the coast of Mauritania are the Cape Verde Islands, which are united\nas an independent country associated with Africa. Cape Verde was once a Portuguese colony but received its\nindependence in 1975. Western Sahara has been in conflict with Morocco over independence and is most often\nassociated with the region of North Africa because of the influence of Islam and because of its connection to\nMorocco.\nThe African Transition Zone cuts across the region of West Africa, indicating a division between Islam and\nChristianity and between the Sahara Desert and the tropics. This diversity in religion and climate is usually\nexhibited with a north\/south division. Islam is the dominant religion on the north side of the African Transition\nZone; Christianity is more dominant to the south. The two religions often clash in the areas where they meet.\nTraditional beliefs and animist religions are also practiced in the African Transition Zone.\n495 7.3 West Africa 496\nFigure 7.18 West Africa\nThis map shows the region of West Africa as defined in this chapter. The African Transition Zone crosses the middle of this region.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe terms \u201cstate\u201d and \u201ccountry\u201d are often used interchangeably by the world community outside of the United States.\nBoth are meant to refer to a physical unit with a sovereign and independent government. In Sub-Saharan Africa the term\n\u201cstate\u201d is commonly used to refer to a country in any one of the various regions. 497 World Regional Geography\nNiger\nThe former French colony of Niger is landlocked, with the Sahara Desert making up its largest portion. Niger is\na land of subsistence farmers, and most of the population lives in the southern regions. The country is less than\n20 percent urban. Other economic activities include uranium mining, which is the country\u2019s main export. The\nworld demand for uranium has not been strong in recent years. Oil exploration has begun and international oil\ncorporations have garnered contracts for drilling.\nThe Sahara Desert is moving southward, and the agrarian culture at the base of Niger\u2019s society is often plagued\nby drought and famine. The Niger River flows through the southwestern region and provides fresh water, but the\nnorthern region is mainly the Sahara Desert, and large portions are covered with sand dunes.\nThe country has extreme demographics. Niger has the highest fertility rate (7.6) in the world, and half the\npopulation is under the age of fifteen, causing a population explosion that taxes the sparse natural resources and\nbrings even more poverty to a country at the bottom end of the index of economic development. Infant mortality\nrates in Niger have been the highest in the world.\nThe mainly Sunni Muslim country has a rich cultural base but suffers from economic problems that appear to\nincrease with the increase in population and desertification. Heavy national debt has hindered social services and\nhas required a considerable amount of foreign aid from a number of sources. As a former colony, Niger, France\nhas been a main contributor to providing economic aid along with the United Nations (UN).\nThe political conditions in Niger are typical of the region. For the first thirty years after independence from\nFrance, the country was ruled by a single political party and military rule. There have been several coups and\nvarious political leaders have been in power. A dispute remains with Libya over its northern border. Ethnic\ninfighting with a minority Taureg group has emerged in recent years, bringing conflict and discord. The Taureg,\nfound throughout northwest Africa in the interior Saharan region, have many ethnic clans and have been masters\nof camel caravans, often with a nomadic heritage. Their clothing is often made of cloth colored with an indigo dye\nthat distinguishes them from other ethnic groups. The Taureg fought historic battles for an independent homeland\nagainst the French during the colonial era. 7.3 West Africa 498\nMali\nTo the west of Niger is Mali, another landlocked Muslim country dominated by the Sahara Desert. Mali was home\nto various ancient empires. Wealth was historically gained from the mining of gold, salt, and copper. The Niger\nRiver flows through the entire southern region, providing a means of transportation and fishing as well as fresh\nwater. The ancient city of Timbuktu, once a port on the Niger River, was a center of commerce and trade for\nthe region and was used by the Taureg as early as the tenth century. Timbuktu has played an important role as\nan educational focal point for many of the peoples of the region. The University of Timbuktu is noted for its\neducational activities and comprises various colleges and madrasas (Islamic schools of learning). At one point in\nits history, it claimed to hold the largest collection of books in Africa. The capital city of Mali is not Timbuktu but\nBamako, which is located in the southwest. Timbuktu remains a main tourist destination for the country and the\nregion.\nInternational Culture and the Power of the Soap Opera\nTimbuktu (Tombouctou) is a key city for the country of Mali in the middle of the Sahel. The city has been stereotyped\nby people in Western culture as the farthest place from civilization on Earth. In reality, it is a thriving city that is well\nconnected to the globalization activities of the rest of the planet. It was once one of the wealthiest cities in the world.\nGold was plentiful, and the city was home to one of the largest universities in the ancient world. Today the city exhibits\ntraits similar to North Africa but is in the African Transition Zone. Modern technology has found its way into the lives\nof the people of Timbuktu. International exchanges are providing interesting insights into the globalization process.\nEven in the rural areas, the people have found innovative ways to share in the international dynamics of global cultures.\nDr. Ibrahim N\u2019diaye, originally from Mali and as of 2011 a history instructor at Morehead State University in\nMorehead, Kentucky, tells a story about his experience while visiting the rural Mali village of Koriyome as a member of\nthe planning committee for the \u201cTombouctou 2000\u201d millennium commemoration festival the Mali Ministry of Culture\nwas sponsoring at the time. He noticed that in the evening at a certain time, the people of the village started up gas-\npowered electric generators and then gathered around television sets connected to a satellite feed throughout the village.\nThe evening feature was a Brazilian soap opera called Mari Mar. It was broadcast in Portuguese, a language no one\nspoke in the village. The seminomadic villagers were totally immersed in the soap opera and had even altered the names\nof the key characters to match local names. For example, they referred to the main character Mari Mar as \u201cMariyama\u201d\n(which is the same as Mari\/Mary); Mari Mar\u2019s husband, Sergio, as \u201cSaajo\u201d; the cruel stepmother Angelika as \u201cJelika\u201d;\nand so on. Everyone in the village seemed to understand the plot and reveled in the drama of the characters and their\nexploits. The production became a centripetal force that brought the villagers together in a way that would not have\nbeen expected by anyone in Brazil or the United States. Who would have believed that soap operas would have become 499 World Regional Geography\na method of diffusing global culture to the planet? This story also indicates that human nature is similar in societies\nthroughout the world.\nFigure 7.19 Bamako, Mali\nThis scene shows the various modes of transportation that are common on the road outside Bamako, Mali.\nRobin Taylor \u2013 looking north from the old bridge \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nMali shares similar political dynamics and demographics with Niger and the rest of the region; however, Mali\nnow has a stable democratic government with little political conflict. There are issues with the Taureg in the north\nand refugees from Ivory Coast in the south, but the country is quite stable politically in spite of the low standard\nof living and high population growth. 7.3 West Africa 500\nMauritania\nMauritania is also dominated by Islam and the Sahara Desert. Niger, Mali, and Mauritania are the largest of the\nWest African states and together would cover the area of the United States east of the Mississippi River. The\nterm \u201cstate\u201d refers to countries with independent governments. Mauritania\u2019s access to the Atlantic coast provided\na shipping connection to the rest of the world. For years the country fought over control of portions of Western\nSahara but relinquished those areas in 1975.\nUnfortunately, the political and economic problems that are common in the region are evident in Mauritania.\nIn 1960, the country gained its independence from the French, and a number of political coups and changes in\ngovernment occurred as a result. Interethnic conflicts exist between the African groups of the south and the Arab-\nBerber groups of the north.\nPolitical unrest and economic hardships continue to add to the challenge of a growing population. Poverty, health\ncare, and education have been major issues that require government support. Foreign aid has been critical to the\noperation of the country.\nLarge amounts of iron ore make up about 40 percent of the country\u2019s exports. Fishing off the coast has great\npotential but has been exploited by international fishing vessels; thus Mauritania is in danger of losing revenues\nand a declining resource base if protection is not secured. Even though the country is largely desert, most of the\npopulation works in subsistence agriculture.\nFigure 7.20 Senegal and the Gambia 501 World Regional Geography\nThe Gambia is totally surrounded by the country of Senegal. The Gambia was once a British colony and Senegal was once a French\ncolony.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nWithin certain communities in Mauritania, especially within the Arab Moor group, the concept of female beauty\nand prosperity was often associated with ample body size. Young girls were encouraged to eat high-fat foods in\nhigh quantities and at times were force-fed to put on weight. Being fat was an indication of wealth, and being thin\nwas a sign of poverty and low esteem. This custom resulted in many women being considered overweight and\nobese by today\u2019s health standards. This trend is not as common today, though it still exists. Many Mauritanian\nwomen consider this old-fashioned, and natural eating habits are more the standard. Global views regarding\nwomen might be contributing to the country\u2019s current concept of beauty and health. 7.3 West Africa 502\nSenegal and the Gambia\nThe country of Senegal on the Atlantic coast totally surrounds the independent country of the Gambia. Senegal\nwas a French colony, while the Gambia was a British colony. The Gambia is an enclave of Senegal and extends\non both sides of the Gambia River for about 186 miles. It is the smallest country on the mainland of Africa and\nis about the size of the US state of Connecticut. The two countries of Senegal and the Gambia were united into\nthe confederation of Senegambia from 1982 to 1989 when it was dissolved. They have kept separate political\nidentities ever since.\nThe capital of Senegal, Dakar, is located on the Cap Vert Peninsula, which is most extreme western extension of\nthe African continent. Dakar was a main colonial port for French West Africa during colonial times. The French\ninfluence remains: the common currency in what were former French colonies is the West African CFA franc\n(Central African franc), which has a fixed rate in relation to the euro.\nGuinea and Guinea-Bissau\nFreeing itself from the grip of Portuguese colonial rule was a hard-fought battle for Guinea-Bissau, which became\nindependent in 1974. The political upheaval that followed up to the present has resulted in various coups, military\nrule, changes in leadership, and the assassination of their president in 2009. Without political stability, it is difficult\nto develop a growing economy. Graft, corruption, and civil war have devastated the country\u2019s infrastructure and\nhindered its economic development, making it among the poorest nations in the world. The country has to depend\non outside aid to supply its basic needs.\nThe French colony of Guinea, which is larger than Guinea-Bissau, holds more promise due to its generous natural\nresource base, but Guinea has suffered the same types of political and economic disasters as its smaller neighbor.\nThough mineral resources are abundant, there is potential for increased agricultural production, where most of the\npeople make their living. Guinea has a large amount of bauxite and other minerals, including diamonds and gold.\nThe lack of infrastructure and political stability has discouraged investors from helping to develop these natural\nresources and converting them into national wealth. 503 World Regional Geography\nSierra Leone\nSierra Leone has been devastated in the past decades due to brutal civil war and political turmoil; as a result,\nthe country was the lowest in the world on the human development index in 2010. There has been little political\nstability. Military factions have wreaked havoc on the country since it gained independence from Britain in the\nearly 1960s. After independence, the country\u2019s contested elections and multiple coups resulted in a ban on all but\none political party and established military rule. At the core of the conflicts was competition for the control of the\ndiamond industry, which was also a primary factor in the civil war.\nThe abuses of power escalated to a breaking point in the late 1980s, which set the stage for a decade-long civil\nwar in the 1990s. A group calling themselves the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) pushed to take control of the\neastern diamond mining sector through terrorist tactics and brute force. Thousands of people died and thousands\nmore were mutilated by having their arms, legs, or other body parts cut off by machetes. Whole villages were\ndestroyed and the residents killed, tortured, or maimed.\nThe government fell under various military coups and eventually resorted to hiring mercenaries to help push\nback the RUF forces. By 1998 the whole country resembled a military camp with arms and ammunition being\ntrafficked to all sides. There was a total breakdown in state structures and institutions. At various times, there\nwere agreements between the sides in hopes that a stable government could emerge, but the agreements broke\ndown and the country continued to scramble for civility. Nigerian forces were actively fighting in the conflict. In\n2000, British troops were employed to help evacuate foreign nationals and establish order. Military forces from\nneighboring Guinea also entered the country to attack RUF bases.\nUN forces with US support eventually established a sense of control of the country. By 2003, major fighting\nwas over and attempts were made to establish a civilian government. Approximately fifty thousand people were\nkilled in this civil war and as many as two million people were displaced, many of them refugees. Sierra Leone\nset up a special court to address crimes against humanity, and the country has been working to establish a stable\ngovernment and maintain a sense of order.\nFigure 7.21 Diamond Fever 7.3 West Africa 504\nA miner in Kono District, Sierra Leone, searches his pan for diamonds. Diamonds have been used as currency to fund armed conflicts\nin this region, hence the term conflict diamonds or blood diamonds. The term blood diamonds was first used in the wars in Angola.\nUnited States Agency for International Development \u2013 public domain.\nThe diamond trade still dominates and political factions still vie for control. Much of the diamond mining is\nuncontrolled, allowing considerable smuggling operations to operate. After the civil war, revenues from diamond\nmining increased from less than $10 million in 2000 to an estimated $130 million in 2004. The civil war destroyed\nthe infrastructure of the country, and most of the resources were looted by forces on one side or another. The\neconomy has had a difficult time recovering. Most of the people make their living in subsistence agriculture.\nMedicine, food, and goods have been in a short supply. Many people have died due to the lack of these items\nduring and after the civil war. Today the country struggles to recover and work toward stabilization.\nLiberia\nTo fully understand where Liberia is today as a country and as a people, one has to understand its background and\nits geopolitical history. Liberia has a unique background in that it was not a European colony and was not included 505 World Regional Geography\nin the Berlin Conference of 1884 as a country up for grabs in the scramble for African territory. The conference\nof colonial European powers who divided up Africa did establish borders for the majority of African countries.\nLiberia, which means \u201cLand of the Free,\u201d was a destination for freed slaves from the United States. In 1847,\nLiberia became an independent country patterned after the US government, even naming its capital Monrovia\nafter President James Monroe, the fifth US president. Many of the freed slaves from the United States returned\nto Africa and relocated to Liberia. The slavery experience in the United States gave returning Africans a different\nculture and history from those indigenous to the African continent. Assimilation between the two groups was\ndifficult. The division between the Americanized settler communities along the coast and the indigenous Africans\nof the interior continued to widen over the years.\nFigure 7.22 School Scene\nStudents in Liberia study by candlelight to catch up on missed time during the civil war.\nUnited States Agency for International Development \u2013 public domain. 7.3 West Africa 506\nCentrifugal forces within the country surfaced in 1980 when a military-backed coup overthrew the government.\nThis event became a turning point that escalated into social division and political unrest. Elections were held in\n1985, which resulted in accusations of election fraud. Successive coups by various factions continued to plague\nthe political arena. By 1989, civil war had commenced. Military forces from the neighboring countries of Ghana,\nGuinea, Senegal, and Nigeria entered the conflict. Whoever was in charge of the government at any one time had\nplenty of opposition from the various factions. A warlord by the name of Charles Taylor became a major player\nand eventually took control of the government in 1997 following a bloody insurgency in the capital.\nUS marines were deployed to protect the US embassy and personnel. Nigerian military troops pushed into the\nconflict. By 2003, more than fifteen thousand UN peacekeeping soldiers were active in Liberia. The power of\nthe government was reduced to a minimum, and the warlord president Taylor was allowed asylum in Nigeria\nand later brought before the UN court in The Hague for war crimes against humanity. In the end, more than two\nhundred thousand people were killed and the country was devastated. With UN troops bringing stability, the 2005\npresidential election brought Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, an economist with a Harvard degree. She became the first\nelected female head of state in Africa.\nPoverty and the lack of goods and services have been a persistent problem for the people of Liberia. An agrarian\nsociety, few global corporations have made investments because of the long-standing civil war. As was true for\nSierra Leone and other African countries such as Angola, the diamond trade helped fund the civil war. Diamonds\nfrom Sierra Leone had an estimated export value of more than $300 million annually in 2010. Diamonds from\nthese countries are often called blood diamonds because of their use as currency to fund death and destruction.\nThe concept of blood diamonds originated in the civil war in Angola years earlier. The UN banned the export of\nblood diamonds from Liberia during the war and finally lifted the ban in 2007. Looting and corruption by warlords\nand military forces pillaged the country\u2019s other resources, leaving most of the population with few opportunities\nand advantages for the future.\nIvory Coast (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire)\nThe former French colony of Ivory Coast is often referred to by its French name: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Before\nindependence in 1960, Ivory Coast was one of France\u2019s most prosperous West African colonies. During the 1960s\nand 1970s, the economy grew, and its production of cocoa beans became the largest in the world. Its coffee\nproduction became the third highest in the world after Brazil and Colombia. Ivory Coast is the leading exporter\nof palm oil and pineapples in Africa. The potential for economic prosperity remains but has been diminished over 507 World Regional Geography\nthe past two decades because of the economic downturn in commodity prices and political instability that resulted\nin a devastating civil war.\nFrom 1960 to 1993, the country only had one political leader. Though this brought continuity to the government\nand the economy grew in the early years, authoritarian rule resulted in civil unrest and dissatisfaction with the\nconditions in the country. Coups in 1999 and 2001 triggered the beginning of political division. Rebel leaders\nfrom the northern part of the country challenged the government\u2019s legitimacy and pushed for land reform and a\nchange in citizenship qualifications. Rebel groups took over the northern regions and vied for control over the\nprime cocoa-growing lands. Fighters under warlords and militias from Sierra Leone and Liberia encroached on\nthe western sectors to gain a foothold. By 2003, French troops patrolled the western border region to provide\nsecurity and stability. The country experimented with a unity government, but this broke down when the rebel\ngroups failed to disarm. By 2007 the government and rebel leaders from the north worked out an agreement to\nreunite the country and dismantle the dividing zone between the north and south. French and UN troops remain to\nhelp implement the peace process.\nFigure 7.23 A Woman in Abidjan, Ivory Coast 7.3 West Africa 508\nMuslims, Christians, and animists are about evenly split in Ivory Coast. An estimated sixty-five languages are spoken here. Family\nsize has been quite large but is slowly decreasing with urbanization.\nSteve Evans \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe people of Ivory Coast are highly diverse. Religious affiliations are evenly split between Muslim, Christian,\nand animist. The economic success in agricultural production and recent oil exploration have attracted people 509 World Regional Geography\nfrom neighboring countries seeking opportunities and advantages. After the 2007 political agreements,\napproximately 20 percent of the population was made up of immigrant workers from neighboring countries, which\nare predominantly Muslim. The small percentage of non-Africans are from France, Lebanon, Vietnam, and Spain.\nThere are also a high number of missionaries from North American Protestant churches. Attacks against non-\nnative-born citizens have occurred; qualification for citizenship is a major concern, and natural-born citizens often\nsupport stronger restrictions on nonnatives becoming citizens or holding political offices.\nGhana\nNamed after the former Ghana Empire, the region of the Gold Coast was home to the Ashanti kingdom, which\nthrived on the slave trade. Many of the European colonial powers had sought to build fortified beachheads on the\ncoast and profit from the lucrative trade in slaves, gold, and ivory. In the end it was the British that dominated\nthe region and established the Gold Coast colony. The push for independence came in 1957. Ghana was the first\nEuropean colony to gain independence in Subsaharan Africa.\nGhana remains a poor country, but it is endowed with natural resources. Even with half the population employed\nin agriculture, the country is experiencing positive economic growth. Gold and other mining operations contribute\nto the economy. Individual remittances and foreign aid remain a necessary component of the country\u2019s economic\nwell being.\nKwame Nkrumah was the first prime minister and the first president. He advocated for a Pan-African concept\nthat would pull the African countries together, oppose neocolonial activity, and increase trade and interaction\nwithin the African community. His ideas were welcome and are still celebrated, but his authoritarian rule brought\nabout his downfall. In 1966, he was ousted in a military coup and exiled to Guinea. The political dynamics\nthat followed were typical of the region: a pattern of corruption, coups, and authoritarian rule. It was not until\n1981, when Jerry Rawlings came to power, that all political parties were banned and a new constitution was\nintroduced. By 1992, the political parties were reinstated and the country began to experience political stability\nand democratic rule, which has endured to the present, making Ghana one of the most stable democracies in\nSubsaharan Africa. 7.3 West Africa 510\nFigure 7.24 Fishing Boats on the Coast of Ghana\nGhana is a former British colony and was one of the first African colonies to\ngain independence (1957). Fishing is still a major economic activity along the\ncoast.\nStephen \u2013 kokrobite catch \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nGhana is diverse in its people and in its physical geography. The physical terrain ranges from coastal plains and\ninterior hills to the large Volta basin in the center. The Volta River was dammed up to produce hydroelectric\npower, resulting in the world\u2019s largest artificial lake, Lake Volta, which covers a large portion of eastern Ghana.\nThe cultural diversity is exemplified by many ethnic groups, more than eighty languages, and at least double that\nin the number of dialects spoken within the country. English is the official language and is used in all public\neducation. Funding for education has been available, and the people have access to quality educational services\nand an increasing agenda of social services. Ghana is showing promise in providing its people with a stable and\nthriving prospect for growth and opportunities.\nBurkina Faso (Formerly Upper Volta)\nUpstream on the Volta River is the former French colony of Upper Volta. In 1960, the former French colony\nattained full independence, and its name was changed in 1984 to Burkina Faso, meaning \u201cthe country of honorable\npeople.\u201d Burkina Faso is a landlocked nation without a port city. The country lacks natural resources and has few\nindustries. Subsistence agriculture is the main economic activity for about 90 percent of the population. Droughts 511 World Regional Geography\nand desertification continue because of overgrazing of the land and the natural southward shift of the Sahara\nDesert. Rainfall varies from forty inches in the south to only ten inches in the north. This is one of the poorest\nnations on Earth.\nPolitical unrest and a series of military coups after independence have not provided stability. The current president\nhas been in power since 1987 and continues to win in presidential elections. New limits may restrict his term in\noffice past 2015. Many people seek employment in the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana. This\nextremely poor nation occupies the second-to-last place on the UN\u2019s human development index. At less than 25\npercent, Burkina Faso has the lowest literacy rate in the world. The poor economy offers few resources to increase\neducational services.\nTogo and Benin\nBoth Togo and Benin were French colonies at the time of independence. The Berlin Conference in 1884 accepted\nGermany\u2019s control over the coastal region that became Togoland in 1905. After World War I, Germany lost this\ncolony and the territory was administered between the British and the French. The French colony of Dahomey\neventually became independent in 1960 and changed its name to the People\u2019s Republic of Benin in 1975.\nTogo and Benin are both elongated countries with major port cities on the Gulf of Guinea along the Atlantic coast.\nBenin is about the same size in area as Liberia or the US state of Kentucky. Benin is twice the size in physical area\nas Togo. The south is a few degrees cooler than the north, where the scrub forests and grasslands of the savanna-\ntype landscape can be more arid, as it is closer to the African Transition Zone. A nature reserve and a national\npark in Benin\u2019s northern portion attract tourists to see big game animals such as elephants, lions, and hippos in\ntheir natural environment. Both countries have a poor economy with most of the people working in agriculture.\nThe political dynamics are similar to other West African states. 7.3 West Africa 512\nNigeria\nAfrica\u2019s most populous country is Nigeria. The exact population has been difficult to determine, but 2010\nestimates report the population to be just short of 150 million. This is a country of more than 250 different ethnic\ngroups with twice that many separate languages or dialects. English is the official language, along with Hausa,\nYoruba, and Igbo (Ibo), all of which are spoken by ten million people or more. The distribution of the major\nethnic groups is illustrated by the different regions of the country. Hausa groups are found mainly in the northern\nregion, Kanuri groups in the northeast, Yoruba in the southwest, and Igbo (Ibo) in the southeast. Ethnic division\nhas also caused serious confrontations and violence. In 1967, a separatist movement in the eastern Igbo region\ncreated the independent nation of Biafra. This sparked an all-out civil war that lasted more than two years and\nresulted in more than a million deaths. Political divisions did not end even after the two sides reconciled and the\ncountry was united under the same government in 1970. Political instability in Nigeria has resulted in an almost\nendless number of military coups and government leaders being removed from office.\nFigure 7.25 Linguistic Groups in Nigeria 513 World Regional Geography\nThere are many linguistic groups in Nigeria but only four main ethnic groups: Yoruba, Hausa, Kanuri, and Igbo (Ibo), each in the\nfour corners of the country.\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries. 7.3 West Africa 514\nFigure 7.26 Making Music in Nigeria\nYoruba drummers perform at a local event (left). A Hausa harpist (right). The Hausa are located in the northwest part of the country,\nwhich is mainly Muslim. The Yoruba are located in the south and are mainly Christian.\nMelvin \u201cBuddy\u201d Baker \u2013 Nigerian Drummers \u2013 CC BY 2.0.; Melvin \u201cBuddy\u201d Baker \u2013 The Harpist \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe size and diversity of this country create a host of centrifugal forces that can bring about divisions along any\nnumber of cultural lines. Religious issues add to the political instability. The north is mainly Muslim, as it is\nlocated in the African Transition Zone. The south is mainly Christian. A large percentage of the population follows\nanimist religions with many different traditional beliefs. Clashes have erupted in the streets that pit Muslims and\nChristians against each other. Several northern provinces have pushed to have the Sharia criminal code made into\nthe area\u2019s civil law. There are regions where it is not uncommon for people to have a mix Christian and animist\nbeliefs.\nFamily size has been large in Nigeria, which has caused an exploding population. Statistically, Nigeria has more\npeople of African heritage than any other country in the world. The population density is equivalent to having half\nthe population of the United States pushed into an area the size of Texas and Oklahoma. Most of the population\nmakes their living on subsistence agriculture, but millions are employed in the growing urban service sector.\nNigeria\u2019s main economic engine is the oil industry, which accounts for up to 80 percent of government revenues\nand is the number one export product. Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\n(OPEC) and is one of the world\u2019s top ten oil-exporting countries.\nThe lucrative oil business has attracted many seeking to share in the profits. The government\u2019s distribution of oil\nrevenues has brought about even more infighting, corruption, and mismanagement within the political leadership.\nRebels and militant groups along the Niger Delta, where most of the oil activity is located, have attacked the oil 515 World Regional Geography\nindustry\u2019s infrastructure and taken workers hostage. They want a larger share of the revenues to remain in Nigeria\nand to go to their people rather than the government or CEOs of international corporations.\nPoverty, a low standard of living, the lack of opportunities and advantages, a poor educational system, or the lack\nof social services does not diminish the human spirit. Confronting all these issues and more, the people of West\nAfrica and Nigeria are vibrant, energetic, and hard working and value the institutions of family and religion. Just\nbecause they have not transitioned to a consumer society does not mean they cannot find fulfillment and happiness\nin their lives. A survey conducted by social scientists in 2001 and reported by BBC News in 2003, indicated that\nNigeria had the highest percentage of happy people of any country in the world at that time. The status of each\ncountry may change from year to year, but the interesting part is that the survey confirmed that money or income\nlevel does not always equate to happiness. Countries such as Nigeria, with a low level of per-capita income, can\nstill highly value their heritage and the traditions that revolve around their family and community and transcend\nthe global push for economic gain and the possession of consumer items. Much can be said for the vibrant cultural\nattributes of the people of West Africa and its developing countries.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Most of West Africa lies in the African Transition Zone, with portions north and south of the transitional\nregion. Dry, desert conditions exist to the north and tropical conditions exist to the south.\n\u2022 The main economic activity in the region is subsistence agriculture. Minerals, diamonds, or oil are also\nextracted in varying amounts in West Africa.\n\u2022 West Africa has a large number of independent states that share similar economic qualities of poverty with\nrapidly expanding populations. Foreign aid and international assistance have been extensive.\n\u2022 The transition from colony to independent nation has not been without serious political conflicts. Bloody\ncivil wars, military coups, and political unrest have plagued the region.\n\u2022 In spite of the political difficulties, poverty and the lack of resources, the people of West Africa hold vibrant\ncultural values that revolve around family and religion. The diversity of languages, religious beliefs, and\nrich cultural traditions provide an African heritage that is celebrated and valued by its people.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the attributes of the Central African countries.\n2. Outline the major armed conflicts in the region and why they are occurring.\n3. Explain how local culture and tradition remain evident in the daily lives of Central African people.\n4. Understand the role of women in Central Africa.\nCentral African Republics\nCentral Africa covers a large physical area that can range from desert conditions to the north in Chad to tropical\nrain forests and mountains in the equatorial region of The Congo. The entire region is roughly the same size as the\nUnited States west of the Mississippi River. The countries included in the region vary with different organizations\nor geographic perspectives; in this textbook, the countries include Cameroon, Congo, Chad, the Central African\nRepublic, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, the Congo (Zaire), Rwanda, and Burundi. Located off the west coast of\nCentral Africa is the small twin island country of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Burundi and Rwanda are often included\nin the region of East Africa, but their connection to the Congo makes them more relevant to the Central African\nregion for the purposes of this textbook.\nThe equator runs through the middle of Central Africa. Type A climates are dominant in the region, complete\nwith tropical rain forests and jungle environments. In the north is the African Transition Zone, which runs through\nChad. In Chad, the arid region of the Sahara Desert transitions into the humid tropics. Central Africa usually only\nincludes portions of Subsaharan Africa south of the African Transition Zone. Southern Chad exhibits qualities\nsimilar to Central Africa, and the northern areas exhibit qualities similar to North Africa or the northern regions\nof Niger, Mali, or Mauritania.\nThe physical geography varies with each country in Central Africa. The most prominent physical landscape is\n517 7.4 Central Africa 518\nthe tropical rain forests of the equatorial region. Highlands can be found in both the western and eastern regions\nof Central Africa. The Cameroon Highlands are a product of a geologic rift in tectonic plates that created S\u00e3o\nTom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, the island portion of Equatorial Guinea, and the mountainous portions of the mainland on the\nborder between Nigeria and Cameroon. There are a number of volcanoes in Cameroon. The only currently active\nvolcano and the highest in elevation is Mt. Cameroon, at more than thirteen thousand feet. Mt. Cameroon emitted\na cloud of carbon dioxide in 1986, killing more than 1,700 people. The volcano last erupted in 2000. In the crater\nof one of the volcanic peaks is Lake Nyos (Mount Cameroon).\nLake Chad in the north is a large, shallow body of water that lies on the border of Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and\nCameroon. The size of Lake Chad varies widely because it expands and contracts with the seasonal variations in\nprecipitation. Lake Chad provides water for local livestock and fishing for millions of people. Its location on the\nborder of four countries has caused political infighting over local water rights, which are valuable commodities in\nsuch an arid climate. The average depth of Lake Chad ranges from five to thirty five feet. Climatic conditions and\ndiversion of the lake for human purposes have caused the water to recede. If these conditions continue, the lake\nmight virtually disappear by the end of the twenty-first century, which would have disastrous effects on both the\nhuman population around the lake and the biodiversity. Waterfowl, crocodiles, fish, and a host of other creatures\ndepend on Lake Chad for their survival, and its loss would create an environmental catastrophe.\nFigure 7.27 Central Africa 519 World Regional Geography\nChad is often included in other regions, but in this text it is included with Central Africa. The Congo River is the main river of this\nregion.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nOn the eastern border of the Congo is a portion of the Great Rift Valley, which extends from Southern Africa\nin Mozambique to Lebanon in the Middle East. Lake Tanganyika and Lake Albert are two of the larger lakes\nin Central Africa along the western section of the Great Rift Valley. Lake Tanganyika is more than 418 miles\nlong and runs the entire length of the boundary between the Congo and Tanzania. These are deepwater lakes.\nLake Tanganyika is the world\u2019s second-deepest lake, with a depth of 4,800 feet. Because of its depth, it is also\nthe world\u2019s second-largest lake by volume after Lake Baikal in Russia, which has the record for both volume and\ndepth.\nFish and fresh water from Lake Tanganyika support millions of people who make their living directly from the\nlake\u2019s resources or who live in the surrounding area. The Great Rift Valley is bordered by high mountains such as\nthe Rwenzori Range and its highlands, which include active volcanoes. A number of volcanoes are located in the\nCongo, not far from the border with Rwanda. In 2002, Mt. Nyiragongo, a volcano with an elevation of 11,358 feet\nin the eastern highlands of the Congo, experienced a series of eruptions that killed a few dozen people, destroyed 7.4 Central Africa 520\nthousands of buildings, and caused the evacuation of as many as four hundred thousand people. Various volcanoes\nin this range have active lava lakes in their craters at their peaks.\nAt the heart of Central Africa are the massive Congo River and all its tributaries. It is the deepest river system in\nthe world and has some stretches that run more than seven hundred feet deep, providing habitats for a wide range\nof organisms and fish species. The Congo River basin is second only to the size of the Amazon basin in South\nAmerica. Home to Africa\u2019s largest tropical rain forest, this region is host to a massive variety of plant and animal\nspecies, which create an extensive environmental resource base. Human activity has been encroaching on this\nvaluable environmental region filled with extensive biodiversity. Logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, and civil\nwar have devastated large areas of the Congo basin, resulting in the loss of habitat for many tropical species.\nFigure 7.28 Living on the Edge\nThis mountainside home is located in the Rwenzori Mountain range in the eastern region of the Congo. Elevations can reach as high\nas 16,761 feet. Some peaks are snow-capped with permanent glaciers.\nDylan Walters \u2013 DSC_0615 \u2013 CC BY 2.0. 521 World Regional Geography\nDeforestation activities have been on the rise in Central Africa and the Congo basin. Endangered primates such\nas chimpanzees and gorillas, along with monkeys and game animals, have struggled to adjust to the shrinkage\nof their habitat and the decline of their population. The endangered mountain gorillas in the northern region\nof the highlands have gained attention through the efforts of professional scientists such as Dian Fossey who\nhave attempted to understand and preserve their ecosystems. Mountain gorillas have been dwindling in numbers\nbecause of poaching, civil war, and hunting. It will take concerted preservation activities for gorillas to survive in\ntheir native habitat.\nConflicts and Unrest in Central Africa\nThe two landlocked countries of Chad and the Central African Republic have endured unstable conditions in\ntheir transitions to independent, stable democratic states. Chad had been in dispute with Libya over the Aozou\nStrip bordering their two countries, an area deemed rich in minerals and uranium, but in 1994, Chad was awarded\nsovereignty over the Aozou Strip by the United Nations (UN) International Court of Justice. Chad is a temporary\nhome of more than 250,000 refugees from the ethnic cleansing campaign in the Darfur region of the Sudan.\nThousands more from the Central African Republic have sought refuge in Chad. Meanwhile, Chad\u2019s government\nhas been plagued with corruption and mismanagement, a state of affairs that has hampered its efforts to offer\nhumanitarian aid to its refugees. Similarly, the Central African Republic is troubled by a history of unstable and\nshort-lived democratic governments. Military coups and transitional governments are frequent. Civil unrest erupts\ninto chaos. Rebel groups control large parts of the countryside. It is difficult for the people to access reliable\npublic services such as health care, education, and transportation systems when the government is not functioning\nadequately. 7.4 Central Africa 522\nFigure 7.29 A Tailor in Chad\nChad is a poor country with existing political conflicts and many refugees from Sudan. The man in this photo is using an old manual\nsewing machine to make clothes.\nMark Knobil \u2013 Tayor shop \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nCameroon and Gabon have more stable governments than Chad or the Central African Republic. Still, they are\nnot without political issues. Cameroon was a German colony as a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884 where\nthe colonial European countries divided up Africa. It remained so until after World War I, when it was divided\nbetween the British and the French. Finally, in 1961, the two sides were merged into one country under one\ngovernment. The two hundred or so different ethnic groups place pressure on the government to address social\nconcerns. Even though the government has become stable more recently, social pressures between traditional\ngroups and groups with a European colonial background have erupted into social unrest. The European Anglo\nfactions have gone so far as to threaten to separate the once-British portion and secede from Cameroon.\nFormerly a French colony, Gabon has transitioned to independence successfully. The country\u2019s small population\nof about 1.5 million people, along with adequate natural resources, has facilitated Gabon\u2019s development into a\ncountry with a relatively stable democratic government and a higher standard of living. Gabon is geared toward\nattracting more foreign investments and continues to progress forward in the index of economic development. As\nof 2010, Gabon was edging toward stage 3, the highest level in Central Africa for a country as a whole.\nEquatorial Guinea and the island nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are small countries on the west coast\nof Central Africa. Serious violence erupted in the former Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea after it gained\nindependence in 1968. The first elected president governed through authoritarian rule, and after a few years in\noffice, he unleashed a reign of terror that resulted in the death of more than one-third of the population and\ntotally neglected the country\u2019s public service sector and infrastructure. He was overthrown and executed by his 523 World Regional Geography\nsuccessor, who then implemented authoritarian measures to make sure he would remain in power and continue to\ncontrol all the revenues from the extensive oil activity in the offshore waters around his country. The billions in\noil revenues have remained in the hands of the president and his family-controlled cabinet. Equatorial Guinea is\nSubsaharan Africa\u2019s third-largest oil exporter; however, most of the country\u2019s citizens have benefited little from\nthe vast wealth of the lucrative oil industry.\nFigure 7.30 Cultural Artifacts 7.4 Central Africa 524\nA mask from Gabon, in the Ogowe River region, made by the Tsogo people.

Masks are a common part of cultural rituals or festival events.\nCliff \u2013 Mask, Tsogo peopls, Ogowe River region \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe former Portuguese colony of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe consists of two small islands off the coast of Gabon. The\nislands received their independence in 1975, but that\u2019s when their problems in establishing a stable government 525 World Regional Geography\nbegan. Political turmoil delayed the arrival of democratic reforms for a decade. Elections for leadership were not\nheld until 1991, and after the elections, leadership changed repeatedly because of political infighting. In 1995 and\n2003, two coups were attempted without success. The democratic process has been complicated by offshore oil\ndiscovery, which has brought an influx of outside workers and media attention to the country. Multinational oil\ncompanies have begun to invest heavily in the development of oil production in the region.\nRwanda has been severely affected by the difficulties typically associated with the transition between colony\nand independent nation. Ethnic divisions manipulated by the colonial masters erupted to challenge the country\u2019s\nstability and future. The division between the Tutsis and the Hutus has deep historic roots. In 1994, the centuries-\nold conflict between the two ethnic groups erupted into violence of unprecedented proportions and resulted in the\nsenseless killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. The Hutus amassed large militias and took revenge\non the Tutsis for years of oppression. Hutu militias rounded up and killed all Tutsis, moderates, and anyone not\nsupporting the Hutu cause. The killing of hundreds of thousands of people continued from city to city throughout\nthe countryside. Within a few months, the genocide is estimated to have caused the death of as many as a million\npeople.\nThe atrocities of the Rwandan genocide extended across the population. Men, women, and children were\nencouraged to kill their neighbors by hacking them to death with machetes. If they refused to comply, they\nthemselves were threatened with death. Victims were herded into schools and churches, where they were\nmassacred and the buildings would be burned to the ground. As people fled the region, the number of Tutsi\nrefugees entering neighboring countries ballooned to more than a million.\nFigure 7.31 Refugee Camp 7.4 Central Africa 526\nAn estimated 1.2 million Rwandan refugees fled to the Congo (Zaire) after a civil war erupted in Rwanda. Many are still in the\nKibumba refugee camp, shown here covered a smoky haze.\nCDC \u2013 public domain.\nTutsi rebels finally gained strength, defeated the Hutu militias, and ended the slaughter. Fearing retribution for\nthe more than one million Tutsis who had been massacred, more than a million defeated Hutus fled as refugees\nacross the borders into Uganda, Burundi, the Congo, Uganda, and Tanzania. Refugee camps housing thousands\nof people each were hastily constructed without proper sanitation or supplies of drinking water. Diseases such as\ncholera and dysentery swept through the camps and killed thousands of refugees. The country of Rwanda was left\ndivided and devastated.\nThe aftermath of the genocide and conflict continues to incite civil unrest and political division in Rwanda. The\nsearch for common ground between the different ethnic groups is divisive and conflict ridden. Now Tutsi leaders\ndominate the Rwandan government.\nThe entire Central African region was devastated by the massive shifts of refugees and the brutal killing of so\nmany people. The competition for the control of resources and the increase in military arms along the Zairian\nborder became a major component of the civil war that plagued the Congo (Zaire) during the same period. Up to\nfive million people died in the Congo because of warfare, disease, and starvation. The wars in the Congo involved\nmilitary actions by the Tutsis from the Rwandan and Ugandan governments and Hutu militias.\nThe small country of Burundi also has been caught up in the conflicts in Rwanda and the Congo. Germany\nclaimed the region of Burundi as a colony in the European scramble for Africa\u2019s resources. After World War I,\nthey handed Burundi over to Belgium. Burundi and Rwanda were both part of Belgium\u2019s African colonial empire\nand were together called Ruanda-Urundi. The two countries were later separated. Burundi achieved independence\nin 1962. Unfortunately, the ethnic conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis that tore apart Rwanda in the\ngenocidal war in 1994 had also plagued Burundi. In 1965, the military was controlled by Tutsi leadership. When 527 World Regional Geography\nthe Hutus revolted, they were repressed. The entire government came under Tutsi control. Hutu attacks in 1972\nresulted in a systematic retaliation by the Tutsis that killed approximately 200,000 Hutus and forced another\n150,000 to flee the country. Civil unrest between these two groups continues to plague the political and social\nstructures of Burundi.\nThe names of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (a former Belgian colony) and the Republic of the Congo\n(a former French colony) are confusing. At one point after they had become independent, both countries chose\nthe name Republic of Congo. To keep them straight, they were commonly referred to by their respective capital\ncities\u2014that is, Congo-Leopoldville (the larger eastern country, also known as Zaire) and Congo-Brazzaville (the\nsmaller western country). The larger former Belgian colony has since become simply The Congo or is referred\nto unofficially as the Belgian Congo, and the smaller former French colony has become Congo. In 1966, Joseph\nMobutu, the political leader of the Congo, officially changed the nation\u2019s name to Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. In 1971, the name was changed to the Republic of Zaire. In 1997, after a bitter civil war and the\noverthrow of Mobutu, the new president, Laurent Kabila, changed Zaire back to the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, often referred to as the Congo. To keep the two names separate, many refer to the Congo as Congo-Zaire.\nThe confusing name situation exemplifies the difficulties and changes in government leadership that have\ntranspired since colonial times in the two countries. The former French colony to the west side of the Congo\nRiver has survived with fewer conflicts than its eastern neighbor but has not escaped civil war. From 1997 to\n1999, Congo had a harsh civil war, and the end result was the overthrow of a democratically elected president and\nthe installation of a former president. Tens of thousands are reported to have been killed. Related conflicts erupted\nin various regions that extended into 2003 before they were finally resolved.\nThe former Belgian colony of The Congo is nearly as large as the United States east of the Mississippi River\nand is a challenge to govern. The population\u2014distributed between about 250 different ethnic groups and about as\nmany languages\u2014was estimated at about seventy million in 2010. Authoritarian rule from political leaders such\nas Mobutu from 1965 to 1997 polarized the country\u2019s many factions and played world leaders against each other.\nThe Congo acted as a swing state in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. As mentioned,\nMobutu changed the name of the country and pillaged the country\u2019s finances for personal gain. He stashed away\nfor himself billions of dollars in public funds in foreign bank accounts that should have been spent on the people\nof the country.\nThe two wars in The Congo has resulted in the highest number of deaths since World War II. The First Congo\nWar (1996 to 1997) occurred when President Mobutu was overthrown by militant forces led by rebel leader\nKabila, who was a long-standing political opponent of Mobutu and was backed by Ugandan and Rwandan militant\ngroups. Mobutu was eventually forced from office and fled the country. Kabila declared himself president and\nchanged the official title of the country from Zaire back to Democratic Republic of the Congo. This transition in\npolitical power caused a shift in the militant rebel groups, which created the conditions for the Second Congo\nWar (1998 to 2003), which was even more brutal than the first. The assassination of President Kabila in 2001\npermitted his adopted son Joseph Kabila to take power and run the country up to the present. 7.4 Central Africa 528\nFigure 7.32 Soldiers in The Congo\nIn this photo, General Kisempia, former chief of staff for Joseph Kabila, inspects his troops. About five million people died in warfare\nin the Congo 1996\u20132003.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Second Congo War raged through the Congo, bringing destruction to the country and the deaths of millions\nof people. Besides political control of the country, a main objective of the combatants was to dominate the\nresource-rich eastern sector of the country, where valuable reserves of zinc, diamonds, copper, and gold can be\nfound in the eastern region. Before the war ended, the surrounding countries of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia,\nUganda, and Rwanda had troops fighting on one side or the other. The civil war formally ended in 2003 when\nrebel groups and the government worked out a shared political arrangement. Many rebel groups remained engaged\nin the eastern region of the Congo long after the agreement was reached. The total number of deaths resulting\nfrom the civil wars in the Congo was estimated in 2008 at about 5.4 million\u2014the majority by the war and the\nremaining by disease or starvation (CBC).\nArmed military conflicts in the Congo did not end with the Second Congo War. Conflicts continue in the eastern\nregion. These armed confrontations are often referred to as the Kivu conflict because they are taking place in the\nprovinces of North and South Kivu in the Congo\u2019s eastern region along the borders with Rwanda and Burundi.\nRebels are fighting against forces from the Congo and Rwanda. As recently as 2009, fighting continued deep in\nthe interior of Central Africa near the Rwandan border between various militias. Such conflicts are not widely\nreported by news outlets in core areas such as the United States.\nPeople in the Congo are still dying because of the devastation of the war. Those not killed in actual warfare are\ndying of hunger and disease where food, medicine, and health care are not available. The death rate in 2008 was\nestimated to be as high as forty-five thousand people per month in the eastern and central regions\u2014many of them 529 World Regional Geography\nchildren. Survivors of the bloody civil war report horrendous terrorist campaigns conducted by various militias\nthat used mass rape, mutilation, and torture as a means of control and social pressure. The UN had more than\neighteen thousand troops in the Congo as of 2007 to help curb the civil unrest and militant activities.\nUnderstanding that most wars are fought over the control of resources is a major step in comprehending the\nconflicts in Central Africa. The conflicts in the Congo are likely to continue because of vast caches of mineral\nwealth in the country that have yet to be extracted. Economic pressure to control the extraction activities of\nsaleable raw materials is often the driving force behind rebel groups in places such as the Congo. Local factions\nusually sell the raw materials for prices well below market value.\nThe sale of precious minerals such as cobalt, coltan, gold, and diamonds has helped fund the wars in the Congo.\nThe country produces more cobalt ore than any other country in the world. Cobalt is a valued metal used in aircraft\nengines, medical implants, and high-performance batteries. The major mining operations for cobalt ore are located\nin the southeastern Katanga state, where there are also large reserves of copper.\nFigure 7.33 Minerals in The Congo 7.4 Central Africa 530\nThis map shows the locations of major minerals in the Congo. Other minerals can also be found in the region.\nUpdated from map courtesy of Andreas 06.\nColtan is a mineral that tantalum comes from, which is highly prized for its use in capacitors for electronic circuits.\nTantalum is found in most modern electronic devices in high demand worldwide, from video game systems to cell\nphones. Most of the coltan in the world comes from mines in the Congo in the eastern Kiva regions. The eastern\nregion is also home to a high percentage of the world\u2019s industrial diamond reserves. Other minerals and ores are 531 World Regional Geography\nalso found in abundance in the region. The sale of precious gems and rare minerals can bring huge profits, but the\nwealth seldom reaches the hands of those that labor in the mines in the extraction process.\nLearning about the geopolitics of Central Africa is critical to developing an understanding of how colonial activity\ngave shape to Central African countries and why multinational corporations are now highly involved in creating\nthe demand and markets for the resources found there. The core economic regions of the world require the\nraw materials and resources that are extracted from peripheral places such as the Congo to fuel their economic\nactivities and to bring profits to their shareholders. The core economic players in the global markets are also some\nof the largest arms manufacturers that sell weapons to the local factions involved in the battle for control of the\nvaluable resources. Globalization connects the core to the periphery. In resource-rich places such as the Congo,\nthis relationship is only going become more interactive.\nThe Other Side of Life in Central Africa\nFigure 7.34 Football in Burundi 7.4 Central Africa 532\nA Sunday-afternoon football match takes place in Bujumbura, Burundi. The government has instituted a law that forbids any\nBurundians from participating in any activity that does not contribute to the communal good before 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning.\nStreet cleaning, family events, and government tasks are examples of acceptable activities. Notice the livestock grazing on the edge\nof the field.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSports and entertainment seem to be a universal human activity. Football (American soccer) is the dominant sport\nin the Central African states. Football can be found in even the poorest areas. The low-cost sport is accessible to\nmost citizens of each country. Other traditional sports include wrestling, archery, and track-and-field events. In\nChad, for example, a type of freestyle wrestling in which the wrestlers wear animal hides and cover themselves\nwith dust to prepare for the match is widely practiced. Canoe racing can be seen in Cameroon. Board games such\nas mancala, a count-and-capture African stone game, are also common. Western-style sports such as basketball,\nbaseball, and cricket are played in many of the urban areas. Olympic sports are practiced in countries as skill,\nability, and funding provides.\nA great variety of cultural traditions spring from the thousands of ethnic groups, distinct languages, and different\nreligious beliefs found in Africa. Cuisine and drink vary as widely as the people\u2019s traditions and are important\nelements of any celebration or festivity. Every country has its own unique way of promoting and celebrating\nits cultural diversity. Even poor countries such as Chad possess a rich cultural heritage. Chad has opened its\nown Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Center. Rwanda, with its civil wars and ethnic divisions,\nstill honors its holidays with ceremonies and celebrations. The people of Central Africa find time and energy to\ncelebrate life. 533 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.35 African Beer 7.4 Central Africa 534\nTusker is a popular African beer sold throughout the world.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nFood and drink differ with location, but most African countries brew some type of beer or alcoholic beverage.\nGinger and honey beers are commonly brewed. Local resources, customs, and tastes determine the types of beer\nbrewed in a particular region. In Cameroon, palm wine or millet beers are the traditional mealtime drinks. In\nBurundi, when close friends gather, they may drink beer from a large container, each with his or her own straw, as\na symbol of unity. Popular in the Subsaharan side of Chad is a red millet beer called billi-billi. Beer brewed from\nwhite millet in Chad is called coshate. The Muslim populations in most countries do not traditionally consume\nalcohol, but alcoholic beverages are more common south of the African Transition Zone, where there is a mainly\nChristian population.\nMany rural and urban women in the Central African Republic transform food crops into beverages for sale in\nthe informal economy. Hard liquor and beer are common products that can be brewed or distilled from grains,\nsorghum, or other local crops. For religious reasons, some people do not drink alcoholic beverages. Juices and\nsoft drinks are available as well as coffee and tea, which are the more traditional beverages of the region. Coffee\nis grown in the tropics, a climate prevalent in many of the countries in Subsaharan Africa. Coffee or tea is a major\nexport product of almost all the Central African countries. In many areas, tea was introduced through colonial\ndiffusion and has become not only a preferred beverage but an export product. Coffee has been the number one\nexport product of Rwanda and Burundi for many years. Neighboring Uganda is the third-largest coffee producer\nin Africa after Ethiopia and Ivory Coast; all three are among the top dozen coffee producers in the world.\nFigure 7.36 African Coffee 535 World Regional Geography\nGrowing coffee is a major economic activity in Africa.\nRex Roof \u2013 African And Costa Rican Coffee \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe cuisines of Central Africa can be as diverse as each local population, but they have retained much of\ntheir local tastes and flavors based on available ingredients. The slave trade introduced items that are now\nquite common, such as chili peppers, peanuts, and cassavas. Nevertheless, food preparation is based mainly\non traditional methods. Plantains and cassavas are mainstays often served with spicy sauces and grilled meat.\nTomatoes, onions, and spinach are common ingredients. Root crops of yams, sweet potatoes, and maniocs are\nwidely served. Fruits and vegetables are popular. Specialty stews are choice entrees that may contain ginger,\nokra, chicken, and various spices. Bambara is a favorite sugary porridge with peanuts and rice that is common in\nCentral Africa. Traditional meats of chicken, goat, or beef are universal, but wild game such as antelope, monkey,\ncrocodile, or whatever is available is widespread. Fish is a main protein source served with other spicy dishes or\ndried to be eaten later. 7.4 Central Africa 536\nThe Role of Women\nWomen\u2019s issues remain a concern in Central Africa regarding social equality, economic development, and\npopulation growth. The treatment of women reflects the attitudes and traditions of a society. Attitudes and\ntraditions vary with location and with the cultural heritage of an ethnic group indigenous to a given area. Most of\nthe Central African countries in are male dominated, a trend that can be witnessed in local activities or sports, in\nthe construction of the government, or in the sex ratio of the business sector. With an average family size of five\nor more, few opportunities exist for women to break out of their traditional roles within their culture and receive\na secondary education or enter a professional field of employment.\nThe Central African region has different types of marriages that vary from country to country. Some traditional\nsocieties still arrange their children\u2019s marriages, but this practice is becoming less common as tradition confronts\nmore contemporary views. Marriages between two people with different ethnic backgrounds are becoming more\nwidespread in the urban areas. Cities are places where people with diverse backgrounds come together to live\nand work, which can lead to an increase in mixed marriages. Cosmopolitan areas are also more likely to have\nconnections with outside cultures through media and communication technology and might be more tolerant of\ndiverse traditions.\nOne of the marriage traditions that exists in regions of Central Africa is polygamy, which is the practice of a man\nor a woman having more than one spouse. In Africa, as in most places in the world, it is far more likely for a man\nto have more than one spouse than for a woman to have more than one spouse. Polygamy is practiced in areas\nwhere traditional beliefs allow it. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of women in the Central African Republic are\nin polygamous unions. The law sanctions polygamy as long as spouses are aware of the arrangement and agree\nto it before they marry. In Cameroon, both monogamous and polygamous marriages are practiced. The average\nfamily is large and extended. Monogamous relationships are the standard in Christian areas such as Burundi and\nin more contemporary urban societies.\nWomen caring for large families do not always have the opportunity to earn an education or obtain the training\nrequired for employment opportunities or professional positions. Circumstances shaped by culture, tradition, or\neconomic necessity are not necessarily supportive of women advancing in the private or public sectors. Even if\nthe legal code of the country does not discriminate against women, traditional practices and the social status of\nmen often keep women from making socioeconomic strides. Many societies are male dominated, and violence\nagainst women is still common and even accepted in Central Africa. 537 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.37 Congo Woman Weaving\nDi bo di \u2013 woman_weaves_basket \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nOne of the worst cases of violence and discrimination against women exists in the eastern regions of the Congo,\nwhere abuse against women, including sexual violence and rape, is listed by UN humanitarian officials as the\nworst in the world. The civil wars in the Congo have created a difficult climate for women, often with tragic\nresults. Violence against women has become an accepted practice in some areas. During the Congo wars, women\nwere often raped and taken as slaves to serve the soldiers. If and when the women were released from captivity, it\nwas not uncommon for them to commit suicide. Improvements in health care, education, and child care are needed\nto improve living circumstances for women and may in turn positively affect population growth in the region.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Central Africa covers a large physical area about the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River.\nMost of the region is in the tropics and has a type A climate. 7.4 Central Africa 538\n\u2022 Central Africa is a relatively poor region economically. National wealth has been garnered traditionally from\nthe export of food crops such as coffee or tea but more recently from mineral and oil extraction.\n\u2022 The civil war in Rwanda in 1994 was the result of conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups. The\nhistoric division was manipulated by colonial powers and erupted into brutal violence that led to the death\nof as many as a million innocent people; nearly as many refugees took shelter in neighboring countries.\n\u2022 The civil wars in the Congo are based on political control as well as control over valuable resources in the\neastern states. The two main Congo wars resulted in an estimated 5.4 million deaths from either direct\nmilitary conflict or the devastation that resulted through starvation and disease.\n\u2022 Central Africa resonates with cultural and ethnic diversity. Hundreds of ethnic groups live and work\ntogether with a high degree of interaction. Traditional cuisine and beverages such as coffee, tea, or beer can\nbe found throughout the region.\n\u2022 Women\u2019s issues range from cosmopolitan in the urban areas, where mixed marriages are common, to harsh\nconditions in which violence and abuse is commonplace. Large family sizes and male-dominated traditions\nmake it difficult for women to transition to positions of equality.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Explain how each country in East Africa is different from the others and what geographic attributes they\nhave in common.\n4. Analyze the affect the African Transition Zone has had on the Horn of Africa.\n5. Learn how and why the country of Somalia is divided into several political regions and what difficulties\nSomalia has to contend with.\nPhysical Geography\nEast Africa is a region that begins in Tanzania in the south and extends north through the great grasslands and\nscrub forest of the savannas of Kenya and Uganda and then across the highlands of Ethiopia, including the Great\nRift Valley. The region also comprises the countries of Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea, which are located in the\nAfrican Transition Zone between North Africa and Subsahran Africa. Rwanda and Burundi are physically in East\nAfrica but are covered in the lesson about Central Africa because of their border activities with the Congo. The\nworld\u2019s second-largest lake by surface area is Lake Victoria, which borders Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. (Lake\nSuperior, on the border between the United States and Canada, is considered the lake with the largest surface\narea.) Lake Victoria provides fish and fresh water for millions of people in the surrounding region. The White\nNile starts at Lake Victoria and flows north to the city of Khartoum in Sudan, where it converges with the Blue\nNile to become the Nile River. The source of the Blue Nile is Lake Tana in the highlands of Ethiopia.\n540 541 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.38 East Africa\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe highest mountain in Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet), is located in Tanzania near the border with\nKenya. The second highest peak, Mt. Kenya (17,058 feet), located just north of the country\u2019s capital of Nairobi,\nnear the equator, is the source of Kenya\u2019s name. Both mountains are inactive volcanoes and have permanent\nsnow at their peaks. They provide fresh water, which flows down their mountainsides, to the surrounding areas.\nMountain ranges in the Western Highlands of the Congo have a greater effect on climate than these two massive\npeaks. For example, the Rwenzori Mountains on the Congo\u2013Uganda border have permanent snow and glaciers\nand reach elevations of more than sixteen thousand feet. These ranges create a rain shadow effect that cuts off\nmoisture for the region from the westerly equatorial winds. 7.5 East Africa 542\nFigure 7.39 Great Rift Valley of East Africa\nThe African portion of the rift extends from Mozambique to the Red Sea. The valley is created by the movement of tectonic plates.\nUSGS \u2013 public domain.\nThis same effect is created by the highlands of Ethiopia, which reach as high as fifteen thousand feet in elevation\nand restrict precipitation in areas to the east. The lower level of rainfall transforms much of the region from a\ntropical rain forest into a savanna-type landscape with few forests, more open grasslands, and sporadic trees. Dry\ndesert-like conditions can be found in a number of places along the Great Rift Valley. 543 World Regional Geography\nThe Great Rift Valley\nThe Great Rift Valley provides evidence of a split in the African Plate, dividing it into two smaller tectonic plates:\nthe Somalian Plate and the Nubian Plate. The Great Rift Valley in East Africa is divided into the Western Rift\nand the Eastern Rift. The Western Rift runs along the border with the Congo. A series of deepwater lakes run\nalong its valley. On the western edge of the Western Rift are the highlands, which have a series of high-elevation\nmountain ranges, including the Rwenzori Mountains, the highest in the series. The Virunga Mountains on the\nCongo\u2013Uganda border are home to endangered mountain gorillas. The Western Rift includes a series of deepwater\nlakes, such as Lake Tanganyika, Lake Edward, and Lake Albert. Lake Victoria is located between the Western\nRift and the Eastern Rift.\nThe Eastern Rift does not have deepwater lakes; rather, it is a wide valley or basin with shallow lakes that do\nnot have outlets. The lakes have higher levels of sodium carbonate and mineral buildup because of a high rate\nof evaporation. The differences in water composition of the lakes along the Eastern Rift vary from freshwater to\nextremely alkaline. Alkaline water creates an ideal breeding ground for algae and other species of fish, such as\ntilapia, which thrive in this environment. Millions of birds feed off the abundant supply of algae and fish. Birds\nattract other wildlife, which in turn creates a unique set of environmental ecosystems. The eastern edge of the\nEastern Rift is home to the inactive volcanic peaks of Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. A number of other volcanic\npeaks are present in the Eastern Rift, such as Ol Doinyo Lengai, an active volcano.\nThe erosion patterns of the highlands have caused a buildup of sediments on the rift valley floor, creating a\nfavorable environment for the preservation of biological remains, including both human and animal remains.\nImportant fossils and bones of several hominid species have been found in the Great Rift Valley. One of the most\nfamous finds came in 1974 when the nearly complete skeleton of an australopithecine nicknamed \u201cLucy.\u201d Lucy\nwas discovered by anthropologist Donald Johanson. Noted anthropologists Richard and Mary Leakey have also\ndone significant work in this region. Since the 1970s, remains of hominids from about ten million years ago were\ndiscovered in the northern region of the Great Rift Valley. Discoveries at the thirty-mile-long Olduvai Gorge\nindicate that early hominid species might have lived in the region for millions of years.\nFigure 7.40 The Great Rift Valley 7.5 East Africa 544\nHiking into the Great Rift Valley region in Tanzania.\nGuillaume Baviere \u2013 2007-08-21 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSerengeti and Game Reserves\nThe Great Rift Valley and the surrounding savannas in Kenya and Tanzania are home to some of the largest game\nreserves in Africa, with a broad variety of big game animals. One of these large regions is the vast Serengeti\nPlain, located in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. The governments of Tanzania and Kenya maintain\nnational parks, national game reserves, and wildlife sanctuaries in their countries, most notably in the Serengeti\nPlain. Legal protection for as much as 80 percent of the Serengeti has been provided. The protections restrict\nhunting and commercial agriculture and provide protection status for the wildlife. The word Serengeti means\n\u201cEndless Plains.\u201d\nThe Serengeti Plain is host to an extraordinary diversity of large mammals and fauna. The largest migration of\nland animals in the world occurs in the Serengeti. Every fall and spring, as many as two million wildebeests,\nantelope, and other grazing animals migrate from the northern hills to the southern plains in search of grass and 545 World Regional Geography\nfood. The Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Ngorongoro Crater\nare located on the Tanzanian side of the border. The enormous crater is the basin of an extinct volcano that has\nbeen transformed into a protected national park for the animals that graze on the grassy plains. This is a dry region\nbecause the Ngorongoro Highlands create a rain shadow for the area.\nFigure 7.41 The Serengeti Plains in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nDozens of other protected areas throughout Eastern Africa have been established in an effort to protect and sustain\nthe valuable ecosystems for the large animals that have found their habitat encroached upon elsewhere by the\never-expanding human population. Kenya has more than fifty-five nationally protected areas that serve as parks,\nreserves, or sanctuaries for wildlife. The Amboseli National Reserve and Mt. Kenya National Park are two of\nthe more well-known protected areas. The \u201cbig five\u201d game animals\u2014elephants, rhinoceroses, lions, leopards, and\nbuffalo\u2014and all the other unique animals found in the same ecosystems, translate into economic income from\ntourists from around the world that wish to experience this type of environment. The national park systems in\nUganda and Ethiopia have made provisions to provide more sanctuaries for wildlife in areas where the human\npopulation is growing and the political situation has not always been stable. 7.5 East Africa 546\nTanzania\nGermany gained control of the region of what is now Tanzania in their scramble for African territory in the late\n1800s. Germany relinquished the colony to Britain after World War I. Off the coast of East Africa is the island of\nZanzibar, which has been an island trading post for centuries and drew in shipping trade from the Middle East,\nIndia, and other parts of Africa. The spice trade attracted European ships throughout colonial times. During British\noccupation, the mainland region was called Tanganyika, named after the large lake on the eastern edge. In 1960,\nthe colony gained independence from Great Britain, and four years later Zanzibar and Tanganyika came together\nto form the country of Tanzania. Zanzibar remains an important travel destination; major tourism infrastructure\nhas been developed there. The coastal city of Dar es Salaam is the primate city of the country and acts as the\ncapital. In 1996, Dodoma was declared the official capital. Dodoma is a type of forward capital, because the\ndeclaration of Dodoma as the official capital was intended to move the political power inland, toward the country\u2019s\ncenter. The parliament meets in Dodoma, but major government offices remain in Dar es Salaam, making Dar es\nSalaam the de facto capital of the country.\nTanzania is an agricultural country; as much as 80 percent of the people make their living off the land. The rural\nnature of the population signifies that the country is at the lower end of the index of economic development with\nlarger families and lower incomes. An emphasis on tourism is a growing trend in Tanzania. The government has\nstepped up efforts to expand the tourism sector of the economy. Oil and natural gas exploration has also been\nemphasized in hopes of raising the level of national wealth.\nFigure 7.42 Elephant Tusks in Mombassa, Kenya 547 World Regional Geography\nWildlife and game reserves are a large part of the tourism economy in places such as Kenya and Tanzania.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThere are more than one hundred ethnic groups in Tanzania. Swahili, an indigenous language, is the lingua franca,\nand English is used in the higher legal courts and in the universities for higher education. Swahili is used as a\nsecond language throughout much of East Africa and serves as a major cultural connection between the many\nethnic groups. Tanzania is unique in this aspect; an indigenous language\u2014that is, Swahili\u2014was chosen as the\nlingua franca rather than the colonial language. Most people learn at least two or three languages, depending on\ntheir circumstances. The religious balance of Tanzania\u2019s population of more than forty million people is almost\nevenly split three ways between Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions. 7.5 East Africa 548\nKenya\nDuring colonial times, the British considered the land area now called Kenya to be a Crown protectorate area. The\ncoastal city of Mombassa has been an international shipping port for centuries and is now the busiest port in the\nregion. Persian, Arab, Indian, and even Chinese ships made port in Mombassa during its earliest years to take part\nin the lucrative trade of slaves, ivory, and spices. Portugal sought early control of the trade center but eventually\nlost out to Britain. Arab and Middle Eastern shippers brought Islam to the region; Europeans brought Christianity.\nHinduism and Sikhism from India found their way into the country with workers brought over by the British to\nhelp build a railroad to Uganda. Kenya gained independence in 1963 and has worked throughout the latter part of\nthe twentieth century to establish a stable democratic government.\nNairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, has become a central core urban area that serves the greater East African region as an\neconomic hub for development and globalization. The largest city in the region, Nairobi is an ever-expanding\ncity that draws in people from rural areas seeking opportunities and advantages. It also has become a destination\nfor international corporations planning to expand business ventures into Africa. Kenya has experienced economic\ngrowth and decline as market prices and agricultural production have fluctuated. The Kenyan government has\nbeen working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to support its economic reform\ninitiatives and reduce waste and corruption in its fiscal processes. The countries of Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya\ndeveloped the East African Community (EAC) as a trading bloc to support mutual development and economic\npartnerships.\nKenya has no one culture that identifies it. There are more than forty different ethnic groups in Kenya, each\nwith its own unique cultural history and traditions. Of the many ethnic groups in Kenya, the Maasai have gained\ninternational attention and are often given wide exposure in tourism information. The Maasai are a small minority\nof Kenya\u2019s population but are known for wearing vivid attire and unique jewelry. Their historical lands have\nbeen the border region between Kenya and Tanzania. Cattle, a sign of wealth, have been at the center of Maasai\ntraditions and culture and provide for their subsistence and livelihood. Tourism brings to the surface the diversity\nof cultures that coexist within Kenya\u2019s environmental attractions, and the country is working to enhance its\ninternational draw in the tourism marketplace. 549 World Regional Geography\nUganda\nUganda is a small, landlocked country on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. The Western Rift borders it on\nthe west, forming both high mountains and deep lakes. Lakes Albert, Edward, and George are three of the larger\nbodies of water. The Nile River flows out of Lake Victoria through Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert on its way north,\nproviding an abundant fresh water supply and a transportation route. The Rwenzori Mountains and the Virunga\nMountains shadow the country from the west. Mountain gorillas, an eastern gorilla subspecies, inhabit this region.\nThey are extremely endangered: only about seven hundred mountain gorillas live in Africa. One of the two main\npopulations of gorillas lives in the national parks of the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Congo.\nThe second population is found only in a national park in Uganda. The lowland eastern gorilla population is also\nthreatened; their population continues to decline. Poaching, habitat loss, disease, and warfare have devastated their\npopulations in the past century.\nUganda is a poor country and has experienced serious political and ethnic conflicts in recent decades. In 1971,\nthe brutal dictator Idi Amin sought to rid the country of his opponents and many foreigners. He killed many of\nUganda\u2019s own people and destroyed the economy in the process. He was ousted in 1979 and lived in exile in Saudi\nArabia until his death. Uganda was in conflict with Sudan in the 1990s, during the bloody civil war in neighboring\nRwanda. Uganda sided with the Tutsi groups in the region and has had to deal with ethnic division within its own\nborders. Uganda has many troops engaged in the conflict along the unstable border region of The Congo.\nFigure 7.43 Silverback Male Western Gorilla 7.5 East Africa 550\nIt has been reported that a number of eastern mountain gorillas in Virunga National Park were slaughtered and eaten by rebel troops\nin January of 2007.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nUganda is an agrarian state with natural mineral wealth. The potential for added national wealth through mineral\nextraction exists, but there is no way to fund the extraction operations. Agriculture is the principal employment\nof Uganda\u2019s labor force, and most workers earn fewer than two dollars per day US equivalent. Coffee has been\nand continues to be a main export crop. Uganda is about the same size in terms of land area as the US state of\nWyoming, but whereas Uganda has an estimated population of more than thirty-two million people, Wyoming has\nfewer than half a million. Population growth without economic growth places a heavy strain on Uganda\u2019s natural\nresources. 551 World Regional Geography\nEthiopia\nWith more than eighty-five million inhabitants, Ethiopia has the second-largest population in Africa; Nigeria has\nthe largest population. Ethiopia was never colonized by the Europeans in the scramble for Africa, but during\nWorld War II, it suffered a brief occupation by Italy (1936\u201341). From 1930 to 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie ruled\nthe country until he was deposed in a military coup. Many Rastafarians in Jamaica consider Selassie to be the\nsecond coming of Christ and a messiah for the African people. According to Rastafarian traditions, Ethiopia was\nthe biblical Zion. After Selassie was deposed, the government shifted to a one-party Communist state. Successive\nyears in Ethiopia were filled with massive uprisings, bloody coups, and devastating droughts, which brought about\nmassive refugee problems and civil unrest. Famine in the 1980s caused the deaths of more than a million people.\nThe Communist element in Ethiopia diminished when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The country\u2019s first\nmultiparty elections were held in 1995.\nThe region of Eritrea had been a part of a federation with Ethiopia. In 1993, Eritrea declared independence,\nsparking a boundary war with Ethiopia that eventually concluded in a peace treaty and independence in 2000. The\nfinal boundary is still disputed. The breaking off of Eritrea left Ethiopia a landlocked country with no port city.\nThe capital and largest city in Ethiopia is Addis Ababa, which is the center for various international organizations\nserving East Africa and Africa in general, such as the African Union and the United Nations (UN) Economic\nCommission for Africa. This city is the hub of activity for the country and for international aid for the region.\nThe Great Rift Valley bisects Ethiopia. Highlands dominate the northwest, and minor highlands exist southwest\nof the rift. The Ethiopian Plateau encompasses the Northwest Highlands and is home to Lake Tana, the source\nof the Blue Nile. Elevations on the Ethiopian Plateau average more than 5,000 feet, and the highest peak, Ras\nDashan, reaches up to 14,928 feet. The climate includes sporadic rain in early spring. The typical rainy season\nextends from June to September, but the rest of the year is usually dry. The high elevations of the highlands cause a\nrain shadow effect in the deep valleys or basins on the dry side of the region. Eastern Ethiopia is arid, with desert-\nlike conditions. The impact of overpopulation on the natural environment has been deforestation and higher rates\nof soil erosion; thus continued loss of animal species is inevitable. Fortunately, Ethiopia has established natural\nparks and game reserves to protect wildlife and big game.\nEthiopia has been inhabited by divergent kingdoms and civilizations, giving rise to a rich heritage and many\ncultural traditions\u2014so much so that Ethiopia is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites. More than 60\npercent of the population claims Christianity as its belief system; about 30 percent of the population is Muslim.\nMany traditional religions prevail in rural areas. In contrast to other African countries, Christianity came to\nEthiopia directly from the Middle East rather than from European colonizers or missionaries from Western\ncountries. In Ethiopia, Christianity was structured into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, a church that has\nendured through centuries. Religious tradition claims that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is in possession of the\nlost Ark of the Covenant, which once rested in the holy of holies in the great temple of Solomon in Jerusalem.\nHowever, no direct evidence supports this claim. Ethiopia does not use the Gregorian calendar, which is the\ncalendar used in the most of the Western world; rather, Ethiopia uses a calendar based upon the calendar of the\nCoptic Christian Church, which is about eight years behind the Gregorian calendar because of differences in how\nthe year is calculated and in differences in the dating of the life of Jesus. 7.5 East Africa 552\nFigure 7.44 Old Man in Harer, Ogaden Region of Eastern Ethiopia\nGustavo Jeronimo \u2013 Anciano \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe large and growing population of Ethiopia is made up of an array of ethnic groups. The three largest ethnic\ngroups are Oromo (35 percent), Amhara (27 percent), and Tigray (6 percent). A number of minority ethnic\ngroups make up the remaining 32 percent. The dominance of the Oromo, Amhara, and Tigray groups provides\nadvantages when it comes to determining which language to use for primary education or in community politics\nin a region. At least eighty-four separate local languages are spoken in Ethiopia. The lingua franca for higher\neducation and for common use is English. The tradition in many elementary schools is to use Amharic as the\nprimary language for instruction, but this is breaking down as other languages increase in usage because of\npopulation increases. 553 World Regional Geography\nEritrea\nEritrea was an Italian colony before joining with Ethiopia in a federation in 1952. Since declaring independence\nin 1993, Eritrea has had a difficult time balancing positive economic growth with its border dispute with Ethiopia.\nThe border war with Ethiopia drained this small, poor country of economic resources and destroyed valuable\ninfrastructure. The agrarian culture and economic activities common in Africa also exist in Eritrea. Farming and\nraising livestock are the main activities of as much as 80 percent of its citizens. The government has controlled\nalmost every aspect of business and industry within its command economy structure. In 2008, in an attempt to\nattract business and connect with global markets, the port city of Massawa opened a free-trade zone and has been\nattracting business connections. Mineral extraction is being explored by multinational corporations, and various\nforeign governments have been working to establish stronger ties.\nEritrea is located north of the African Transition Zone. Most countries north of the African Transition Zone have\nan Islamic majority, but that is not necessarily the case in Eritrea. Statistical data are difficult to confirm, but\nChristianity is believed to be as prominent as Islam in Eritrea. The main Christian denomination is the Eritrean\nOrthodox Church, with smaller percentages of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Most Muslims are Sunni. The\ngovernment highly regulates religious activities and requires all churches to register with the state and provide\npersonal information regarding its members. Members of religious groups not registered with the state may be\nsubject to arrest or imprisonment for violation of this requirement. Examples of groups not approved by the\ngovernment of Eritrea as of 2010 include Baha\u2019is and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\nDjibouti\nThe Bab el-Mandeb Strait, between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, separates Africa from Asia on the\nsouthwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The strait is a narrow strategic choke point for international shipping\ntranferring cargo from Europe to Asia through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. On the African side of the strait is\nthe small former French colony of the Republic of Djibouti. Natural resources within the country are sparse, and\nthe republic depends on its relationship with countries such as the United States or its former colonizer to augment\nits financial status, keep the region stable, and protect valuable shipping in the nearby waterways. The United\nStates has an important military base in Djibouti, which is the only major US military base in Subsaharan Africa.\nThe French also have a major military base located in Djibouti. The significance of the Djibouti\u2019s location means\nit is a critical place for monitoring both the war on terrorism and incidences of piracy off the Horn of Africa. 7.5 East Africa 554\nA main objective of having European and US military bases in Djibouti is to insure safe passage of oil tankers\nthrough the strait providing European countries and the United States with petroleum from the Persian Gulf states.\nLike many other African countries transitioning from colonies to independent countries, Djibouti has experienced\npolitical infighting that has been detrimental to the country\u2019s economic situation. The government struggles with\nforeign debt and a lack of economic development opportunities. Most of the population lives in the capital city of\nDjibouti, where the unemployment rate is extremely high. Its vital location is the country\u2019s main asset, and foreign\naid has been a major part of the country\u2019s economic equation.\nSomalia\nThe country presently called Somalia resisted the forces of European colonizers scrambling for African land in\nthe 1800s. The various kingdoms and their powerful leaders kept the colonial forces out well beyond World War\nI. Somalia\u2019s close vicinity to the Arabian Peninsula and the prevalence of Arab trade provided a direct connection\nthrough which Islam was quickly diffused from Arabia to Africa. Political alliances were fused between the\nSomalian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Horn of Africa used Islam as a centripetal force\nin uniting the people against outside forces.\nIt was not until 1920, as a direct result of the use of airplanes in warfare, that the northern region of Somaliland\nbuckled under to the British colonial forces. The eastern and southern regions were soon dominated by Italy.\nBritain finally withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960. The country then joined with the Italian portions of\nthe region to form a new nation, Somalia. An authoritarian socialist regime established power in 1969 and lasted\nuntil 1991. The socialist regime in Somalia initiated a territorial war in 1978 in an attempt to gain back territory\nin the eastern parts of Ethiopia\u2019s Ogaden region, which was once part of the various Somalian kingdoms. The\nwar only intensified the divisions in the region. After 1991, the country descended into political chaos, economic\nturmoil, and factional fighting.\nNorthern clans who opposed the central government broke away in a move toward independence, and the old\nBritish Somaliland became the Republic of Somaliland in 1991. Somaliland operates independently from the\nrest of Somalia and prints its own currency. The northeast region of the country referred to as Puntland also\nbroke away from the central government. Somaliland sought total independence, while Puntland was in favor\nof belonging to a national union but wanted to maintain autonomy. Both autonomous regions have their own\ngovernments and are relatively stable, but they have had conflicts regarding the territory between them. Neither\nis recognized by outside entities as independent countries. Puntland\u2019s port of Bosaso has developed into a rapidly 555 World Regional Geography\ngrowing economic city and has expanded from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand people since 2000. Plans\nare in the works for a new airport and an economic free-trade zone, which should attract additional business and\nan influx of additional immigrants from other parts of Somalia and the region.\nSouthern Somalia has been broken down into regions ruled by warlords who have pillaged the country and\ncontrol vital transportation links. A total government breakdown occurred in 1991, leading to a meltdown\nin all areas of society. Food distribution was hampered through pillaging and a lack of fuel and structured\ntransportation. Electrical power was lost and clan warfare became the rule of law. A famine subsequently caused\nan estimated three hundred thousand deaths. The UN stepped in with food and peacekeeping troops, and in 1992,\nthe United States dispatched marines in Operation Restore Hope, which stabilized the distribution of food but\nwas unsuccessful in stabilizing the political situation and establishing a legitimate government. In 1993, nineteen\nUS soldiers were killed in a battle in the capital, Mogadishu, after of which the US withdrew its troops. The UN\nwithdrew its peacekeeping troops in 1995.\nFigure 7.45 Somalia, with Its Autonomous Regions of Somaliland and Puntland 7.5 East Africa 556\nCIA \u2013 public domain.\nFigure 7.46 Super 64 Military Helicopter Piloted by Michael Durant over Mogadishu, 1993 557 World Regional Geography\nThis helicopter crashed and was the basis of the Hollywood movie Blackhawk Down, depicting warfare in Somalia.\nUS Army \u2013 public domain.\nDespite a lack of effective national governance, the informal economy in Somalia continues to thrive. Trading\nthrough personal transactions and the private marketplace continues to provide for the needs of the people. The\nmain sources of revenue are agricultural goods and livestock, as well as money sent by people from outside the\ncountry to their families in Somalia. Banking and businesses have struggled to adapt to the continual conflicts,\nyet various hotels and service agencies continue to operate under the protection of private security militias.\nTelecommunication firms continue to offer service with low calling rates for urban areas. The educational system\nis heavily supported by the private sector because of the collapse of the central government. Secondary education\nat the university level is struggling in the south but is more established in Puntland and Somaliland, where they are\nfunded by central authorities. Income from piracy on the high seas has brought in millions to the private warlords\nthat manage the operations. Stabilizing the country and showing economic progress will remain a difficult task\nfor whoever leads Somalia. 7.5 East Africa 558\nRural-to-Urban Shift\nThe average family size in East Africa is about 5.5, which is typical of the entire continent of Africa and translates\ninto exploding population growth. In many areas of Africa in general and East Africa in particular, most of\nthe population (as much as 80 percent) makes its living off the land in agricultural pursuits. Large families in\nrural areas create the conditions for the highest levels of rural-to-urban shift of any continent in the world. The\nlarge cities\u2014with expanding business operations complete with communication and transportations systems that\nlink up with global activities\u2014are an attractive draw for people seeking greater employment opportunities. In\nEast Africa, each of the three largest cities\u2014Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, and Addis Ababa\u2014is more populous than\nChicago, the third-largest US city. In West Africa, the city of Lagos, Nigeria, is more populous than New York\nCity and Chicago combined. These cities are all riding the worldwide wave of globalization and are core centers\nof economic activity for the business sector and corporate enterprises.\nFigure 7.47 Urban Slums of Nairobi\nPeople walking to and from work along the railroad tracks in a poor neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya.\nND Strupler \u2013 Nairobi 2008 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe other regions of Africa all have central cities that act as economic core areas and attract the multitudes from 559 World Regional Geography\nrural areas looking for employment and opportunities. International connections are indicative of local economic\ndevelopment, which is causing the urban areas to grow at exponential rates. Cities heavily affected by a high level\nof rural-to-urban shift often cannot build infrastructure fast enough to keep up with demand. Self-constructed\nslums and squatter settlements, which lack basic public services such as electricity, sewage disposal, running\nwater, or transportation systems, circle the cities. All the large cities of Africa are expanding at unsustainable rates.\nTraffic congestion, trash buildup, higher crime rates, health problems, and air pollution are some of the common\nresults.\nAs of 2010, the US population was about 80 percent urban. This is the opposite of places such as East Africa,\nwhere about 80 percent of the population remains rural. In the next few decades, Africa could witness the growth\nof megacities that might continue to expand and grow for another century. For example, if the current rates\ncontinue, Ethiopia\u2019s population of eighty-five million people in 2010 will double to more than 160 million by\n2040. Urban areas will continue to be target destinations for employment opportunities, whether they exist or not,\nand rural-to-urban shift will drive the populations of cities such as Addis Ababa to double, triple, or quadruple in\nsize by 2020.\nFigure 7.48 Modern City of Nairobi\nSince this photo was taken in 1980, the city center of Nairobi has expanded and grown ever larger to become a major core business 7.5 East Africa 560\nhub for East Africa. The central business district at the center of this core locale has an enormous pull factor for individuals from\nrural areas seeking employment.\nBrian Snelson \u2013 Nairobi 1980 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The physical geography of East Africa is dominated by the Great Rift Valley, which extends through the\nmiddle of the region from north to south. Associated with the rift valleys are vast savannas such as the\nSerengeti Plain, large lakes, high mountains, and the highlands of Ethiopia.\n\u2022 East Africa has extensive habitat for large herds of big game animals, mountains for great apes, and enough\nprey for the big cats such as lions and cheetahs. Countries are establishing game preserves, national parks,\nand conservation areas to protect these animals and their natural habitats and to provide economic\nopportunities to gain wealth through tourism.\n\u2022 Most of the populations of countries in East Africa earn their livelihood through agricultural activities\nbecause the region has a high percentage of people living in rural areas. Large families fuel an ever-\nincreasing rural-to-urban shift in the population, causing the cities to grow at an unprecedented rate.\n\u2022 Areas along the African Transition Zone have experienced a higher degree of political conflict and civil\nunrest. Somalia has the highest level of political division and fragmentation based on religion and ethnic\nbackgrounds, which contributed to the secession of the two autonomous regions of Somaliland and\nPuntland. The central government is neither stable nor strong enough to govern the fragmented country.\n\u2022 Diversity in the region is remarkably high; there are hundreds of different indigenous ethnic groups, each\nwith its own language and culture. Religious activity is split between Christianity, Islam, and traditional\nbeliefs. Islam is more favored in the African Transition Zone and to the north, while Christianity and\nanimism are more prominent to the south of the zone.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

The physical\nlocation is the large part of Africa to the south of the extensive Congo River basin. Southern Africa is home to a\nnumber of river systems; the Zambezi River is the most prominent. The Zambezi flows from the northwest corner\nof Zambia and western Angola all the way to the Indian Ocean on the coast of Mozambique. Along the way, the\nZambezi River flows over the mighty Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls\nis the largest waterfall in the world based on selected criteria and is a major tourist attraction for the region.\nSouthern Africa includes both type B and type C climates. The Tropic of Capricorn runs straight through the\nmiddle of the region, indicating that the southern portion is outside the tropics. The Kalahari Desert, which\nlies mainly in Botswana, is an extensive desert region with an arid mixture of grasslands and sand. When there\nis adequate rainfall, the grasslands provide excellent grazing for wildlife. Precipitation varies from three to ten\ninches per year. The Kalahari is home to game reserves and national parks. Large areas of dry salt pans stretch\nover ancient lake beds. The salt pans fill with water after heavy rainfall but are dry the remainder of the year. The\nNamib Desert, found along the west coast of Namibia, receives little rainfall. Moderate type C climates are found\nsouth of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, where conditions are suitable for a variety of agricultural activities,\nincluding fruit orchards and an expanding wine industry.\nMadagascar is located to the east of the continent, in the Indian Ocean. Madagascar is the world\u2019s fourth-\nlargest island and is similar in area to France. Surrounding Madagascar are the independent island states of the\nSeychelles, Comoros, and Mauritius. Madagascar is included in this lesson on Southern Africa but does not\nshare its cultural geography or biodiversity. Madagascar broke away from the mainland more than 160 million\nyears ago and developed its own environmental conditions and cultural heritage. The early human inhabitants of\nMadagascar can trace their ancestry to the regions of Malaysia and Indonesia in Southeast Asia. People from the 7.6 Southern Africa 564\nAfrican mainland also joined the population. The whole island later came under the colonial domination of France\nbut won its independence in 1960.\nMadagascar\u2019s unique physical environment is home to many plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.\nAt least thirty-three varieties of lemurs and many tropical bird species and other organisms are found only on\nMadagascar. It is an area of high biodiversity and is home to about 5 percent of all the animals and plants in the\nworld. Tropical rain forests can be found on the eastern edge on the windward side of the island. The western side\nof the island experiences a rain shadow effect because of the height of the central highlands, which reach as high\nas 9,435 feet. The western side of the island has a smaller population and receives less precipitation.\nFigure 7.50 Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur from Madagascar at the Dudley Zoo in England\nFrank Vassen \u2013 Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSince 1990, the eastern tropical rain forest has experienced a sharp decline because of extensive logging, slash-\nand-burn agriculture, mining operations, and drought. Population growth has placed a heavier demand on the 565 World Regional Geography\nenvironment, which in turn puts stress on the habitats of many of the unusual organisms that are unique to the\nisland. Typical of many African nations, agriculture is Madagascar\u2019s main economic activity. About 80 percent of\nthe twenty million people who live on the island earn their living off the land. Deforestation is occurring on all\nparts of the island and is more severe in areas where human habitation leads to a high demand for firewood used in\ncooking. In other parts of Africa, important environmental areas have been protected or transformed into national\nparks and wildlife preserves. Though protected areas do exist on Madagascar, efforts to protect the environment\nand the wildlife have been hampered by the lack of available funding and the population\u2019s high demand for natural\nresources.\nThe countries on the Southern African mainland share many of the demographic qualities of the rest of Africa:\nlarge family size, agrarian economies, multiple ethnic groups, rural populations, political instability, and a high\nrate of rural-to-urban shift. Southern Africa is set apart from other Subsaharan African regions because of its\nmineral resources, including copper, diamonds, gold, zinc, chromium, platinum, manganese, iron ore, and coal.\nCountries in Southern Africa are quite large in physical area, except three smaller landlocked states: Lesotho,\nSwaziland, and Malawi. The larger countries\u2014South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia,\nNamibia, and Angola\u2014all have extensive mineral deposits.\nThe vast mineral resources make this one of the wealthiest regions of Africa with the greatest potential for\neconomic growth. A physical band of mineral resources in Southern Africa stretches from the rich oil fields off\nthe northwest coast of Angola, east through the diamond-mining region, and into the northern Copper Belt of\nZambia. A region of rich mineral deposits continues from the unique geological formation called the Great Dyke\nin central Zimbabwe through the Bushveld basin into South Africa. From here, it extends southwest through the\ncentral gold- and diamond-mining regions of South Africa toward the southern coast. Mining activity exists on\nboth sides of the belt of mineral resources. Diamond mining is found in parts of Botswana and along the coast of\nNamibia. Coal can be found in central Mozambique. The counties that are able to conduct the necessary extractive\nprocesses are creating national wealth and increasing the standard of living for their people.\nAngola\nThe largest country in Southern Africa is Angola. Located on the west coast of the continent, the country includes\nthe small exclave of Cabinda to the north, which borders the Congo River and is separated from the main body of\nAngola. Cabinda is a major oil producer and remains a foothold for rebel groups seeking greater control over oil\nresources. Offshore oil activity has increased in the northern region of Angola and has attracted international oil 7.6 Southern Africa 566\ncompanies from many countries. In 2007, Angola was the largest oil exporter to China, which has become one of\nAngola\u2019s largest financial supporters. Oil revenues have helped Angola rebuild after a bitter civil war (1975\u20132002)\ndevastated the country and its infrastructure. Nevertheless, the country remains one of the world\u2019s poorest; life\nexpectancies were a mere thirty-eight years in 2010. Angola is also burdened with thousands of refugees seeking\nsafety from the civil wars in the Congo.\nAngola was a Portuguese colony and fought hard for independence, which it received in 1975. After\nindependence, strong factions clashed to obtain political power. At the same time, the Cold War was at a zenith.\nThe United States and the Soviet Union both used their influence to support political leadership in Angola and\nother parts of Africa to reflect their respective ideologies. Even Cuba had a large number of military troops in\nAngola in support of a socialist agenda. As the factions within Angola vied for power, the country was deeply\ndivided. Thus began a twenty-seven-year civil war that finally ended in 2002. The country has been working to\nrecover from this turmoil ever since. Foreign aid and charitable organizations have helped feed the people, and\noil revenues are beginning to support recovery. The government of Angola has suffered from serious corruption.\nMuch of the wealth is centralized in the hands of an elite few and does not filter down to the general population.\nNatural resources were a major factor in the long, drawn-out civil war. Angola was one of the original countries\nin which the term blood diamonds was used. Resistant groups would mine the diamonds, sell them on the world\nmarket, and use that income to fund their military pursuits. Revenue from the clandestine diamond trade was\nfueled the death and destruction of the newly independent country. Diamonds are still being mined in Angola and\nbringing in considerable national income. The industry is not always controlled or managed to lessen the number\nof diamonds reaching the market from unsubstantiated sources. Natural resources have helped the country look\nto a future in which a more stable government can work to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure and improve the\nstandard of living for its people.\nNamibia\nNamibia is a dry, arid land with few people. Its population density of about 6.5 people per square mile in 2009\nwas the second-lowest in the world after Mongolia. The physical geography of this large country is dominated\nby arid plateaus and desert regions with changes in elevation between them. The Namib Desert, characterized\nby enormous sand dunes, runs along the entire west coast. It meets up with the Great Escarpment, which is a\nsharp rise in elevation of as much as a mile high toward the interior. A central plateau dominates the north-south\ninterior, and the Kalahari Desert is to the east. Natural resources are abundant: uranium and diamonds are the 567 World Regional Geography\nmajor export products, and lead, zinc, tin, silver, copper, and tungsten are also mined. The coastal waters support a\nsubstantial fishing industry. Namibia\u2019s constitution contains language that addresses environmental conservation\nand the protection of wildlife habitat. The country has created nature conservancies, which have advanced the\nactivities of ecotourism, a source of national wealth promoted by the government.\nFigure 7.51 Klein Namutomi Waterhole, Namibia\nWildlife are becoming an excellent asset for tourism.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe Berlin Conference of 1884, when the colonial European powers met to divide up Africa, resulted in the\nGerman colonization of the region of Namibia. The German influence remains evident in the dominant religion:\nmost of the Christians in Namibia, which now make up about 80 percent of the population, are Lutherans.\nBy 1920, the region known as South West Africa had been transferred to South Africa by the League of Nations.\nSouth West Africa had to endure the political policies of apartheid while under the jurisdiction of South Africa.\nBy 1966, local uprisings and a push for sovereignty resulted in a socialist independence movement that created\nthe South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (SWAPO). This organization was entrenched in a guerilla war with\nSouth Africa, which led to the return of Namibia to United Nations (UN) supervision. The name Namibia was\nadopted during this era. Socialist countries such as Cuba provided supported SWAPO\u2019s movement for autonomy.\nThe 1980s brought about a transition in the governing process in the Namibian War of Independence. In 1985,\nSouth Africa installed an interim government in Namibia. A UN peace plan was reached that included Namibia 7.6 Southern Africa 568\nin 1988, and Namibia finally gained its independence in 1990 following South Africa\u2019s withdrawal from Angola\nin their civil war. SWAPO has become the dominant Namibian political affiliation. As a recently independent\ncountry, Namibia has had to work through a natural transition process to create a stable government to sustain\nitself as an independent country.\nZambia\nThe landlocked country of Zambia was known as Northern Rhodesia during colonial times. From 1891 to 1923,\nit was administered by Britain\u2019s South Africa Company. Then it became a colony of Great Britain. The name was\nchanged to Zambia when the country was granted independence in 1964. Lusaka is its primate city and capital.\nMining in the Copper Belt to the north provides both economic activity and employment opportunities for the\npeople, but long distances from major seaports and the fluctuation in world commodity prices do not provide\na stable economic situation for the mining industry. Though most of the population makes their living by\nsubsistence agriculture, the country has a large urbanized population that heavily depends on the mining industry\nfor employment and economic support.\nThe country is expected to double in population in about thirty-five years if current rates continue. The average\nfamily size is more than five members. The larger towns and cities along the major transportation routes are\nthe main population centers. Unemployment remains high in these urban areas; there are few opportunities for\neconomic development. More than seventy ethnic groups can be found in Zambia, including a small but growing\nChinese population. English is the official language, but many other languages are spoken. Most of the people are\nChristians with a wide variety of denominations. Animist and traditional beliefs are also common. 569 World Regional Geography\nMalawi\nMalawi is a landlocked nation that became independent in 1964. The British controlled the region in 1891 and\nnamed their colony Nyasaland after Lake Nyasa, a large lake in Malawi; the lake is also called Lake Malawi.\nThe lake serves as the eastern border of the country. Another name for Lake Malawi is Calendar Lake, named so\nbecause of its physical dimensions, which are 52 miles wide and 365 miles long. Lake Malawi is a deepwater lake\nwith depths reaching 2,300 feet. The great depths of the lake are caused by the Great Rift Valley, which created\nthe depression the lake rests in. The lake provides for the livelihoods for millions of people who live along its\nshores and depend on it resources of fish and fresh water.\nFigure 7.52 Tea Plantation in Malawi\nDavid Davies \u2013 Mulanje tea estate \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nMalawi is not a technologically developed country. Only about 15 percent of the population lives in urban areas.\nAbout 90 percent of the country\u2019s exports are agricultural products of tea, sugar, coffee, and tobacco. Malawi\u2019s\ngovernment requires substantial assistance from the international community, such as the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). Complicating the situation are instances of government corruption that have\nled to the withholding of international aid. Another major problem for Malawi is the significant number of HIV-\ninfected people. Also, family size is commonly large, and rapid population growth places an ever-increasing\ndemand on natural resources. 7.6 Southern Africa 570\nMozambique\nBefore colonial Europeans arrived in the region of Mozambique along Africa\u2019s east coast, the Bantu people of\na number of ethnic subgroups were the dominant people, and they still make up more than 99 percent of the\npopulation. Portugal had claimed the region as a colony as early as the sixteenth century. Portugal strongly resisted\nreleasing its claims to Mozambique but did so after much opposition; the country became independent in 1975.\nThe transition from colony to independent nation was a struggle for Mozambique. The rebel groups that had been\ninstrumental in fighting a guerilla war for independence against Portugal remained active after 1975 and fighting\ncontinued after independence. The country fell into a violent civil war from 1977 to 1992. Central elements in\nthis war were involvement or influence by Zimbabwe and South Africa on one side and Marxist support from\nthe Soviet Union on the other. More than a million people died in this brutal war, which also devastated the\ncountry, destroyed valuable infrastructure, and created more than a million refugees who sought sanctuary in\nneighboring countries. At the same time, most people of Portuguese descent left because of safety concerns.\nA peace agreement was finally reached in 1992. Since then, the country has had to struggle to create a stable\ngovernment and provide a safe environment for its people.\nForeign aid has remained a necessity to provide economic stability for Mozambique. The agrarian society includes\na high percentage of the population that lives below the poverty line. Selective mining operations and the\nintroduction of garment manufacturing augments the main agricultural activities. Since 2000, the government has\nworked to implement economic reforms and to curb excess spending. Both have had a positive effect on economic\ngrowth. It is not unusual for foreign debt to plague developing countries, and Mozambique has suffered from a\nhigh level of national debt that has threatened to bankrupt the country. Debt relief for Mozambique came through\nthe IMF\u2019s debt forgiveness program; both debt forgiveness and loan rescheduling agreements were implemented.\nThe positive growth pattern indicates that even desperately poor countries can work to improve the standard of\nliving for their people if there are adequate resources and opportunities for employment. Still, rapid population\ngrowth potentially cancels out economic gains and threatens to deplete valuable resources, thereby creating an\neven more difficult path for future stability.\nZimbabwe\nThere is no better way to understand Zimbabwe than to become familiar with the history and heritage of the\npeople who live there. The Great Zimbabwe Kingdom flourished from about 1250 to 1450, when it was eclipsed 571 World Regional Geography\nby succeeding kingdoms. Ruins from the extensive stone architecture of that era remain and are a major tourist\nattraction. These kingdoms were major trading centers for the region but later clashed with the colonial powers\nthat desired to dominate regional trade for themselves. The Bantu civilization of Southern Africa established a\nnumber of kingdoms that existed in Zimbabwe up to the colonial era.\nZimbabwe experienced similar colonial activity to that which befell Zambia, its neighbor to the north. Britain\narrived in the late 1800s, and by 1923 they called their newly controlled colony Southern Rhodesia, after Cecil\nRhodes, who headed the British South Africa Company, a mercantile company that broke new ground in the\nregion. The British were able to quell any resistance to their activity and consolidated their holdings. After Zambia\nbecome independent, Southern Rhodesia was renamed Rhodesia. In 1965, the white-dominated leadership of\nthe Rhodesian government unilaterally declared its independence, but Britain did not recognize this action. The\nUN issued sanctions against the white leadership; the response was an internal guerilla uprising to fight for free\nelections that would include black Africans. Independence was finally granted in 1980, and the country\u2019s name\nwas officially changed from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe.\nIn 1980, Robert Mugabe came to power as the first president and extended his authoritarian rule over the next\nthree decades. During this time, the country experienced more than its fair share of civil unrest and political\nturmoil. Mugabe has been accused of corruption, election rigging, and pillaging of public funds for personal\ngain. Under his leadership, there have been accusations of government mismanagement, human rights abuses, and\nhyperinflation of the country\u2019s currency. In 2008, inflation led to serious devaluation of the currency. The Reserve\nBank of Zimbabwe printed banknotes in the denomination of one hundred trillion dollars that were only worth\na few US dollars in the international exchange. The people continue to work through these difficult economic\nconditions.\nMugabe initiated a land reform policy that would take land owned by people of white European ancestry and\nredistribute it to people of black African ancestry. During the colonial era, white Europeans, who only made up\na small percentage of the population, moved in and took control of most of the agricultural lands. Land reform\nwas a progressive policy and was meant to provide a greater level of equality within the country. However, the\ndisorganized methods used to carry out the plan resulted in violence and the confiscation of farmland with little\nregard for the rule of law.\nFigure 7.53 Towers of the Great Zimbabwe Kingdom 7.6 Southern Africa 572\nThis photo shows the ruins the Great Zimbabwe Kingdom, an ancient empire that gave\nZimbabwe its name after the colonial era, during which it was called Rhodesia.\nKevin Walsh \u2013 greatzim \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThousands of white farmers and their families left the country. Some were killed when their farms were taken\nover by force. Mugabe was accused of corruption in making sure his cronies benefited from the land reform\nwithout being concerned about the general population. The disruption in the agricultural sector resulted in a drastic\nreduction in agricultural output. The country shifted from a once sustainable, prosperous agricultural sector with\nextensive exports to an agricultural system that was in disarray. The result was food shortages and the loss of\nenormous agricultural export profits.\nShaping a stable post-Mugabe government will be a challenge for Zimbabwe. Solving the problems resulting\nfrom the transition from exploitive colonial rule to personal authoritarian rule will be an arduous undertaking.\nThe country has serious economic problems that have lowered the amount of opportunities and advantages for\nits people. Life expectancies have dropped from about sixty years in 1990 to fewer than forty years two decades\nlater. Health care, education, and social services have not reached the level needed to sustain a healthy society by\nworld standards. The HIV\/AIDS epidemic has hit Zimbabwe hard, affecting a higher percentage of its population\nthan most of the other African countries. Political turmoil, civil unrest, and violence have reduced the level of\nlaw and order within the country. These issues are indicators that within the globalization process, countries such 573 World Regional Geography\nas Zimbabwe will be losing out on the opportunity to attract foreign investments, manufacturing expansions, or\nemployment opportunities being developed elsewhere to meet the demands of the marketplace.\nBotswana\nThe country of Botswana is relatively flat, and the Kalahari Desert covers as much as 70 percent of its land\narea. By the time it established independence from Britain in 1966, the lack of agricultural lands had reduced the\ncountry\u2019s economic level to the lowest in the world. At that time, the country was called Bechuanaland.\nBotswana has transitioned more smoothly than other African countries into a stable political system with a\nfast-growing economy. It has an emerging service sector, extensive diamond mining, and expanding industrial\nambitions. Personal incomes are rising, and the standard of living is reaching upward to the second highest in the\nregion after South Africa.\nBotswana is fortunate to have had uninterrupted civilian political leadership for the decades following\nindependence. This stable government has implemented progressive social policies and attracted significant\ncapital investments to create one of the most dynamic economies in Africa. Diamond mining has been the\nprinciple extraction activity dominating the country\u2019s export income. The stability of the country has enhanced\nthe tourism market and created a growing ecotourism industry. The vast Kalahari Desert and the well-protected\ngame reserves provide attractive tourist destinations.\nFigure 7.54 San Bushmen in Deception Valley, Botswana 7.6 Southern Africa 574\nKaren Corby \u2013 Kgalagadi \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nFar from the fast-growing urban development of the big cities in Botswana, there exists a dispute between the\ngovernment of Botswana and the indigenous San people who live in the middle of the Central Kalahari Game\nReserve. The government has established programs to move the San from the reserve to other locations where\nthey would become less nomadic and settle into a more agrarian lifestyle. According to the government position,\nthis is to keep the natural habitat and wildlife from being affected by human activity, thereby promoting tourism.\nThe courts, however, ruled against the forced move of the San out of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Critics\nof the government program claim the real reason for the move is to clear the land of human habitation so the area\ncan be developed for mining purposes. Estimates indicate that fewer than one hundred thousand San presently\nlive in Southern Africa; about fifty-five thousand San live in Botswana.\nBotswana\u2019s government has advanced one of Africa\u2019s most progressive and comprehensive programs for dealing\nwith HIV\/AIDS. Medical care, education, and social services are being strengthened. Botswana ranks at the top\nend in terms of the percentage of people who are infected with HIV\/AIDS. This epidemic cuts across all levels\nof society and culture. The social stigma attached to being infected with HIV discourages individuals from being\ntested for the disease or seeking medical care. Addressing this epidemic is a challenge throughout Southern Africa. 575 World Regional Geography\nFigure 7.55 Baobab Tree in Southern Africa\nThese trees are so large that people have actually lived inside them.\nI_pinz \u2013 Baobab Tree \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nSouth Africa\nAnchoring Subsaharan Africa to the south is the dominant country of South Africa. Its large land area and vast\nmineral resources support a population of about fifty million people. The Cape of Good Hope on the southern\ntip of the continent is a transition point from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. Its strategic location was\nimportant for the control of shipping during the early colonial era before the Suez Canal provided a shortcut\nbetween Europe and Asia, bypassing most of Africa. The European colonial era first brought Dutch explorers to\nthe Cape of Good Hope, where they established the city of Cape Town as a stopover and resupply outpost on their\nway to rest of Asia.\nSouth Africa is home to many indigenous ethnic groups and is demonstrative of the diverse pattern of human\ngeography. The country has a history of both ethnic diversity and ethnic division. Two of the largest African\ngroups are the Xhosa and the Zulu. The European component of the ethnic mosaic was enhanced by colonial\nand neocolonial activities. After the arrival of the first Dutch ships, other Europeans followed and competed\nwith the African groups for land and control. The discovery of first diamonds and then gold prompted Britain\u2019s\ninvolvement in South Africa. The Boer Wars (1880\u201381 and 1899\u20131902) were fought between the Dutch-\nbased Boers and Britain for control of South Africa\u2019s mineral resources. South Africa became a British colony 7.6 Southern Africa 576\ndominated by a white power structure. The Boers (later known as Afrikaners) spoke Afrikaans and were\nprominent in the South African political system.\nFigure 7.56 \u201cPetty Apartheid\u201d Beach Sign Written in Afrikaans and\nEnglish\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nSegregation first developed as an informal separation of the racial groups but evolved into the legally\ninstitutionalized policy of apartheid, which separated people into black, white, and coloured (mixed race) racial\ncategories. A fourth category was developed for people from Indian or Asian backgrounds. Apartheid eventually\nfound its way into every aspect of South African culture. In the larger scale of society, access and separation\nwas based on race. Each racial group had its own beaches, buses, hospitals, schools, universities, and so on. The\nlegal system divided the population according to race, with the white minority receiving every advantage. There\nwere extensive and detailed rules for every aspect of daily activity, including which public restroom or drinking\nfountain could be used, which color an individual\u2019s telephone could be, and which park bench a person could\nsit on. The government also sanctioned separate homelands for people from different ethnic groups. People were\nphysically removed from their homes and transported to their respective new homelands based on their racial or\nethnic background. The policy of apartheid not only divided the country at that time but set up racial barriers that\nwill take generations to overcome. 577 World Regional Geography\nThe controversial policy of apartheid in South Africa achieved international attention. Many countries condemned\nit and implemented economic sanctions and trade restrictions against South Africa. Opposition grew within the\ncountry and erupted into violence and social unrest. As a result, the white-dominated government of South Africa\nbegan to dismantle the apartheid system in the 1990s. The ban on political opposition parties, such as the African\nNational Congress, was lifted, and after twenty-seven years in prison, Nelson Mandela was released from prison,\nwhere he had held for his resistance activities. The apartheid legislation was repealed, and a new era began.\nMandela was the first African to be elected president of South Africa in the new multiracial elections of 1994.\nHis presidency, which ended in 1999, set the stage for a multiracial society. The country is still working through\nthe ramifications of all those years of racial separation. As can be expected, the transition has not been without\ndifficulty.\nSouth Africa has large, modern cities such as Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban, each about the size of the\nUS city of Chicago or larger. The cities of Pretoria, East Rand, and Port Elizabeth are also major metropolitan\nareas and have more than one million people each. These urban centers all contribute to and support the extensive\nmining and agricultural activities that provide national wealth. As the country that exports more diamonds than\nany other in the world, South Africa has gained much national income from the extraction of mineral resources,\nwhich are being tapped by some of the largest mining operations on Earth.\nLarge parts of South Africa have a moderate climate and good soils, which combine to produce enormous\nquantities of agricultural products, both for domestic consumption and for export profits. Mining and agriculture\nhave provided extensive opportunities for employment\u2014opportunities that draw in migrants from neighboring\ncountries that have experienced either political unrest or poor economic conditions. These immigrants add to the\ncultural dynamics of an already ethnically diverse country.\nSouth Africa\u2019s manufacturing sector is not well developed. The country depends on Europe, East Asia, and the\nUnited States, the three main core economic areas of the world, to provide postindustrial goods. There are few\nwell-paying manufacturing jobs to provide for a growing or stable South African middle class.\nThe structure and dynamics of the current economic activities have brought about a two-tiered socioeconomic\nsystem. Most of the population may work in the mines, in agricultural activities, or in the service sector, but they\nare not directly benefiting from the profits of their labor, other than earning a wage. These people find themselves\nin the poorer working-class majority of the population. The landowners, mining corporation executives, and social\nelite that control the service sector or are employed in activities such as banking or the commodity markets\nare receiving higher incomes and have created a wealthier upper class. Apartheid supported this class division.\nThe current free and open legal system has yet to bring about a change in the socioeconomic structure of the\npopulation. Millions of poor ethnic minorities find themselves in living conditions similar to their economically\ndepressed neighbors in other parts of Africa, while the wealthier upper class has established a good standard of\nliving similar to that of the core economic areas of the world. 7.6 Southern Africa 578\nFigure 7.57 Provinces of South Africa after Reorganization in 1994\nSouth Africa redesigned its internal provincial boundaries in 1994. The two large former provinces of Cape in the south and Transvaal\nin the north were divided up into seven smaller units. The province of Orange Free State was changed to Free State and the province\nof Natal was changed to Kwazulu-Natal; both kept their main boundaries intact.\nSouth Africa redrew its internal provincial boundaries in 1994. The large former Cape Province in the south,\nwhich had been a former British center of power, was divided into three smaller provinces. The large Transvaal\nProvince in the north, which had been a center for Afrikaners, was divided into four smaller provinces. Orange\nFree State changed its name to Free State and Natal Province changed its name to Kwazulu-Natal. The changes\nwere made based on the size and political management of the country that had come with the transfer of power 579 World Regional Geography\nwhen Mandela became president. The European colonial pattern of settlement was adjusted to represent a more\nSouth African pattern of political administration.\nThe 2010 World Cup Soccer Games\nIn 2010, South Africa surpassed Morocco and Egypt in the political arena and were chosen to host the World Cup\nsoccer games. The African teams in included Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. The\nWorld Cup is held once every four years. The cost to host the games was enormous and also a testimony to the people\nand government of South Africa. The country had to build five new stadiums and upgrade five existing stadiums for the\ngames; the largest stadium was Soccer City in Johannesburg, with a capacity of about 84,490. Overall construction costs\nwere estimated to be more than one billion dollars. Transportation infrastructure and road networks were also improved.\nThe preparations and costs that South Africa undertook to hold the games were not without controversy. Sections of\nshack dwellers in Durban and in other places were relocated to be out of the sight of international visitors attending the\ngames. This move was made to improve the country\u2019s image for tourism. There were also reports of strikes by the\nconstruction workers building the stadiums, many of them temporary workers making about three hundred dollars per\nmonth, who argued that their wages were too low. South Africa\u2019s unemployment rate at the time was about 25 percent,\nand the country continues to struggle with unemployment. The hope was that the infrastructure improvements would\nbenefit the country for the long term and that tourism would increase if the individuals who came for the games\nencouraged others to visit. South Africa was banking on this event to boost its economic conditions and strengthen its\nstanding in the global marketplace.\nThe impact of sports on a society\u2014both positive and negative\u2014can be enormous. Hosting the World Cup necessitated\nthe strengthening of South Africa\u2019s security operations to meet FIFA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association)\nstandards to handle the high influx of participants and visitors. It has been estimated that South Africa invested about\n$4.3 billion to host the games. These are billions that are not going toward providing water, medical clinics, and\neducational support to the poorest neighborhoods and communities. The financial investments indicate the power and\nattraction that the World Cup holds on a global basis. No African team was in the final match (Spain defeated the\nNetherlands), but soccer is a widely supported sport throughout Africa. The 2014 World Cup will be hosted by Brazil. 7.6 Southern Africa 580\nFigure 7.58 Cape Town Stadium, Taken from Signal Hill, South Africa; Seating\nCapacity of 64,100\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nSwaziland and Lesotho\nThe two small landlocked enclaves of Lesotho and Swaziland are independent countries surrounded by South\nAfrica. Mozambique borders Swaziland to the north. Under British occupation, the area of Lesotho was called\nBasutoland. Upon achieving independence in 1966, the area was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho. The country\nis rather mountainous, and most of the land area is more than a mile in elevation. The Sotho people have a Bantu\nbackground and speak a Bantu language. More than 80 percent are Christian. Lesotho is the size of the US state of\nMaryland and has a population of more than two million people. The main economic activity has been based on 581 World Regional Geography\nagriculture, but a large percentage of income comes from remittances from Lesotho citizens who work in South\nAfrica. Light manufacturing is beginning to emerge to enhance the economy. Diamonds and other minerals have\nbeen found here.\nLesotho is a constitutional monarchy: the government is led by a prime minister, but the king retains his\nceremonial position. Reforming the country from a kingdom to a democratic-style government has not been\nwithout obstacles. The country has been subjected to political unrest, resulting in many years of military rule and\nviolent internal conflicts. Lesotho is trying to stabilize its political situation and economy.\nThe Swazi Kingdom functioned under relative autonomy during colonial times, and Britain granted independence\nto Swaziland in 1968. The Swazi are a Bantu people who migrated into Southern Africa centuries ago with the\nXhosas and Zulus. Swaziland has low mountains to the north with the grasslands and scrub forests of the savannas\nin the east and rain forests in the west. It is ruled by an absolute monarch, one of the last in the world. Political\nunrest has led to challenges to his rule. Reformers are pushing for modification of the government and for some\nelement of democratic reform, but reforms are slow in materializing. The small country of Swaziland is about the\nsize of the US state of New Jersey. There are more than one million people, and one-third of the population is\ninfected with HIV\/AIDS.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Southern Africa is located along the Tropic of Capricorn and is host to various climate zones, including\ntropical, desert, and moderate type C climates. Extensive agricultural activity can be found south of the\nTropic of Capricorn, where moderate climates prevail.\n\u2022 Madagascar is a separated from the mainland of Africa and provides a habitat for animals not found on the\nmainland. The mainland region is large with many different physical landscapes.\n\u2022 The mainland region of Southern Africa has extensive mineral deposits that provide resources for its\ncountries to gain national wealth. Approaches to translating mineral deposits into wealth have varied among\nthe countries.\n\u2022 Many ethnic groups can be found in Southern Africa, ranging from the San in the Kalahari to the Zulu\ngroups to the south. Colonialism made its footprint on the region by creating borders and providing colonial\nnames. The transition from colony to independent nation has caused political and economic difficulties.\n\u2022 South Africa had an apartheid system in place stemming from the colonial era. The apartheid system was\ndismantled after the 1994 election of President Nelson Mandela. South Africa went so far as to change its\nprovincial system from four to nine provinces to more appropriately politically administer the country.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Most countries are former European colonies that are growing their\nown economies as developing countries. The hundreds of tribal groups that live there with their own\nlanguages and cultures often clash with each other or their government.\n\u2022 The informal sector is strong in this realm as people seek opportunities amid civil unrest and conflict. The\nweak formal sector in many countries does not always receive enough revenue from taxes or fees to operate\nthe public sector and provide services to the people. The realm has a high potential for economic\ndevelopment in the extraction of minerals as well as tourism.\n\u2022 West Africa has many countries with hundreds of separate ethnic groups with their own languages. The high\ndiversity makes it difficult for social unity and political cohesiveness. Located on the African Transition\nZone, there is often conflict between the Muslim north and the Christian south. Civil wars in recent years\nhave devastated various countries. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a growing diverse\npopulation. In spite of its diversity and issues, Subsaharan Africa retains a sense of vibrancy in the\ncelebration of family and community.\n\u2022 Central Africa covers a large region of tropical Africa, including the vast Congo River basin. Poor economic\nconditions have been partly a result of the many civil wars and conflicts in the region where the controlling\nparty or military power has received most of the wealth, leaving the majority in need of infrastructure\nimprovements and public services.\n\u2022 The transition from colony to independent country has often resulted in short-lived unstable governments\nthat were often replaced with leaders who took advantage of their power to place large amounts of public\nfunds in their own foreign bank accounts. Such fraud and corruption have often left most of the people with\nfewer opportunities and little money left for public services.\n\u2022 The civil war in Rwanda, which was based on ethnicity, led to as many as a million deaths. The civil war in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo over the control of land and resources resulted in more than five\nmillion deaths, the most of any war since World War II. Hundreds of ethnic groups exist in an area that is\nbeing exploited for valuable mineral deposits.\n\u2022 Large deposits of gold, diamonds, and rare minerals such as coltan are located in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and surrounding areas. The wealth that they can generate has fueled many armed conflicts by\nvarious groups that vie for control of these resources. Women have suffered serious setbacks in their rights\n583 7.7 End-of-Chapter Material 584\nand status in Central Africa because of these conflicts.\n\u2022 East Africa is dominated by the Great Rift Valley, with its large lakes, high mountains, and vast savanna\nplains. The Serengeti and other game preserves are home to immense numbers of big game that are\nattractive for tourism. Most of the people work in agriculture. Diverse ethnic and religious groups exist here,\nand there is a high rural-to-urban shift in the population. Somalia is divided, with various major factions\ncontrolling parts of the country.\n\u2022 Southern Africa, located on the Tropic of Capricorn, has moderate climates and extensive mineral deposits.\nThe countries have a positive means to gain wealth from agriculture and minerals. There is a high diversity\nof tribal groups that have been impacted by colonial activity. South Africa had an apartheid system for years\nthat finally broke down in the past few decades. Zimbabwe is an example of a country that has been\ndevastated by dictatorial rule by one man for many years without democratic reforms.\n\u2022 Madagascar is a large island off the east coast and has different flora and fauna from the mainland because\nof isolation by tectonic activity. The island of Madagascar was once connected to the African continent but\ndrifted away with the activity of the tectonic plates in that area. The biodiversity on Madagascar is\njeopardized by the high level of deforestation that is destroying the habitat for rare animal species. Chapter 8: North Africa and Southwest Asia\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nThe realm of North Africa and Southwest Asia is large and expansive in terms of physical area, but its regions\nshare a number of common qualities. The physical area of this realm is divided into three regions: North Africa,\nSouthwest Asia, and the countries of TurkestanAlternative term for the region of Central Asia named after the\nTurkish people who moved through the area centuries ago. (the geographic region of Central Asia). The countries\nin the North African region include the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea from Morocco\nto Sudan. The realm borders the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara Desert, and the African Transition Zone. Egypt has\nterritory in both Africa and Asia through its possession of the Sinai Peninsula. The second region, Southwest\nAsia, includes Turkey, Iran, the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula. The land on the eastern shores of\nthe Mediterranean Sea is frequently referred to as the LevantLand area bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea\nthat now includes Israel, Lebanon, and parts of western Syria. and is often included as a part of the Middle East.\nTechnically, the term Middle East only includes the five countries of Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq,\nbut in common practice Middle East refers to all of Southwest Asia. Central Asia, also referred to as Turkestan,\nincludes the \u201cstan\u201d countries from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan in the region between China and the Caspian Sea.\nThe suffix stan, meaning \u201cland of,\u201d is a common suffix for country names in Central Asia. Afghanistan is the only\ncountry of Central Asia that was not officially a part of the former Soviet Union.\nThe Middle East\u2014a European term that bridges the Near EastRegion of present-day Turkey. and the Far\nEastGeneral European term for the regions of Asia including India and China.\u2014can also be defined as the area\nbetween the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. Turkey, with its focal point of Istanbul, has been considered\npart of the Near East by Europeans. The famous Agatha Christie novel Murder on the Orient Express was about\na train that traveled between Paris and Istanbul. The word orient refers to the east; occident refers to the west.\nBecause Turkey was referred to as the Near East and India and China were the Far East, the region in between\nbecame the Middle East. This term is not entirely accurate but is widely used to refer to Southwest Asia.\nThree small countries in the Caucasus Mountains\u2014Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia\u2014are affiliated with this\nrealm through their geographic location and their histories. They are technically European countries and were\nonce part of the former Soviet Union. The details of these countries are covered in Chapter 1 \u201cIntroduction to\nthe World\u201d. Turkey, which has territory in both Europe and Asia, was historically referred to as Asia MinorThe\n585 Chapter 8: North Africa and Southwest Asia 586\nancient region that is present-day Turkey. because most of its land mass is in Asia. The portion of Turkey that\nlies to the west of Istanbul is on the European continent, which connects Turkey with the European community.\nCyprus is a small island in the eastern Mediterranean that has ties to Turkey and a historical connection to the\nMiddle East. Cyprus is technically a European country and is a member of the European Union. Bordering both\nIran and China is Afghanistan, which has been a transitional country in the pages of history. Many empires\nhave conquered it, and many groups have fought over its territory. Today, Afghanistan is a key country in the\nglobalization process because of its huge mineral reserves, yet it has a volatile and unstable political scene.\nSudan, a country geographically located in Africa, is included in this realm because it shares similar traits with the\nrest of the realm\u2019s three regions. Sudan could also be studied with East Africa. The African Transition Zone cuts\nacross Sudan and extends through the widest part of the African continent. The African Transition Zone creates a\nboundary for the realms of North Africa and Southwest Asia dividing the Islamic influence to the north from the\nChristian influence to the south. It is also a transitional boundary between the dry and arid type B climates and\nthe more tropical type A climates of Equatorial Africa. The countries on the eastern end of the African Transition\nZone\u2014including Eritrea, Somalia, and Ethiopia\u2014are often covered with this realm in other contexts, but in this\ntextbook, the critical information was included in the section on East Africa (Chapter 7 \u201cSubsaharan Africa\u201d,\nSection 7.5 \u201cEast Africa\u201d). The African Transition Zone can be volatile, with the potential for ethnic, cultural, or\npolitical conflicts.\nFigure 8.1 The Regions of North Africa, Southwest Asia, and Turkestan\nThe African Transition Zone is the southern boundary of the realm. 587 World Regional Geography\nMap courtesty of University of Texas Libraries. 8.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Understand three basic traits the countries of the realm shares in common.\n2. Outline the two cultural hearths and explain why they developed where they did.\n3. Describe how the people of this realm gain access to fresh water.\n4. Understand how the events of the 2011 Arab Spring have affected the realm.\nThe countries of the realm share three key dominant traits that influence all other human activities. The first key\ncommon trait relates to the climate of the region. Though various climate types can be found in this realm, it is\nthe dry or arid type B climate that dominates and covers most of the physical area. Other climate types include\nthe type H highland climate (cold temperatures at the high elevations with moderate temperatures at the bases) of\nthe mountains of the Maghreb, Iran, or Central Asia and the more moderate type C climate in the coastal regions\nbordering the sea. The type C climate along the coastal Mediterranean area attracts human development and is\nhome to many large port cities. The overall fact is that vast areas of each region are uninhabited desert. North\nAfrica has the largest desert in the world\u2014the Sahara\u2014which borders the Libyan Desert and the Nubian Desert.\nAbout one third of the Arabian Peninsula is part of the Empty Quarter of the Rub\u2019 al Khali (Arabian Desert).\nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan have vast regions of desert with few if any inhabitants. This aspect\nof the realm reveals the importance of water as a valuable natural resource. Most people in the realm are more\ndependent on the availability of water than on the availability of oil.\nThe second trait is Islam: most of the people in the realm are Muslims. The practice of Islam in day-to-day\nlife takes different forms in the various divisions of the religion. The differences between the divisions have\ncontributed to conflict or open warfare. Islam acts as more than just a religion. It also serves as a strong cultural\nforce that has historically unified or divided people. The divisive nature of the religion has often resulted in serious\npolitical confrontations within the realm between groups of different Islamic ideologies. Concurrently, the religion\nof Islam is also a unifying force that brings Muslims with similar beliefs together with common bonds. Islam\nprovides structure and consistency in daily life. The faith can provide comfort and a way of living. The holy cities\nof Mecca and Medina are located in Saudi Arabia. Other holy cities for other divisions of Islam include Jerusalem\nand the two cities holy to Shia Muslims: Karbala and Najaf in Iraq. Islam dominates the realm, but other religions\nare significant in various regions. Israel is a Jewish state, and Christianity is common in places from Lebanon to\nEgypt. There are also followers of the Baha\u2019i faith, Zoroastrianism, and groups such as the Druze, just to name a\nfew.\nThe third factor that all three regions of the realm share is the availability of significant natural resources. North\nAfrica, Southwest Asia, and Turkestan all have significant reserves of oil, natural gas, and important minerals.\nIt stands to reason that not every country has the same reserves and that some of the countries have very few or\nnone at all. However, in terms of how the countries gain national wealth, it is the export of oil that has dominated\n588 589 World Regional Geography\nthe economic activity as it relates to the global community. This realm is a peripheral realm. The resource that\nthe realm can offer to the core economic regions of the world is the energy to fuel their economies and maintain\ntheir high standard of living. Enormous economic profits from the sale of these resources have traditionally been\nheld in the hands of the elite ruling leader or his clan and do not always filter down to most of the population.\nThe control of and profits from natural resources have become the primary objectives of the countries; this fuels\nconflicts and armed military interventions in areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan.\nCultural Hearths\nAvailability and control of fresh water have typically resulted in the ability of humans to grow food crops and\nexpand their cultural activities. Hunter-gatherer groups did not settle down in one area but were more nomadic\nbecause of their seasonal search for food. As humans developed the ability to grow crops and provide enough food\nin one place, they no longer needed to move. The earliest human settlements sprang up in what is the present-\nday Middle East. Early human settlements provide some indication of early urbanization patterns based on the\navailability or surplus of food. The shift to permanent settlements included the domestication of livestock and\nthe production of grain crops. Fruits and vegetables were grown and harvested domestically. The activities of\nthis era created humanity\u2019s earliest version of the rural-to-urban shift associated with the Industrial Revolution\nor present development. It is theorized that the ability to grow excess food provided the time and resources for\nurbanization and the establishment of organized communities, which often progressed into political entities or\nregional empires.\nIt has been estimated that some of the earliest cities in the world\u2014Jericho, for example\u2014were first inhabited\naround 10,000 BCE in the Middle East. In the same region, two cultural hearths provide significant historical\nvalue to the concept of human development: Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley in Egypt. Both areas were settings\nfor the growth of human civilization and are still being examined and studied today. In Mesopotamia, a remarkable\nhuman civilization emerged along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is present-day Iraq,\nSyria, and southern Turkey. The climate, soils, and availability of fresh water provided the ingredients for the\ngrowth of a human civilization that is held in high esteem because of its significant contributions to our human\nhistory. 8.1 Introducing the Realm 590\nFigure 8.2 Head of Gudea, Sumerian Ruler from Mesopotamia, Circa 2121 BCE\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nMesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent\nMesopotamia, meaning \u201cland between rivers,\u201d is located between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Neolithic\npottery found there has been dated to before 7000 BCE. Humans in this area urbanized as early as 5000 BCE.\nPeople were settling in the Mesopotamia region, building magnificent cities, and developing their sense of human 591 World Regional Geography\nculture. Mesopotamia gave rise to a historical cradle of civilization that included the Assyrian, Babylonian,\nSumerian, and Akkadian Empires, all established during the Bronze Age (about 3000 BCE or later). Famous cities\nsuch as Ur, Babylon, and Nineveh were located in the Mesopotamia region. The control of water and the ability to\ngrow excess food contributed to their success. They developed extensive irrigation systems. Large grain storage\nunits were necessary to provide the civic structure and to develop a military to protect and serve the city or empire.\nThe human activity in this area extended around the region all the way to the Mediterranean Sea, which is where\nthe term Fertile Crescent comes from.\nFigure 8.3 The Two Main Cultural Hearths in the Realm: Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent in Asia and Upper and Lower Egypt in Africa\nVarious ancient groups were well established on the eastern side of the Fertile Crescent along the Mediterranean\ncoast. The cities of Tyre and Sidon were ports and access points for trade and commerce for groups like the\nPhoenicians who traded throughout the Mediterranean. Ancient cities such as Damascus and Jericho became\nestablished in the same region and were good examples of early human urbanization during the Bronze Age.\nThese cities are two of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. 8.1 Introducing the Realm 592\nNile River Civilization\nHuman civilization also emerged along the Nile River valley of what is now Egypt. The pyramids and the Sphinx\nin the Giza Plateau just outside Cairo stand testimony to the human endeavors that took place here. Spring\nflooding of the Nile River brought nutrients and water to the land along the Nile Valley. The land could produce\nexcess food, which subsequently led to the ability to support a structured, urbanized civilization. The Nile River is\nthe lifeblood of the region. In the fifth century BCE, the ancient Greek historian Herodotus suggested that Egypt\nwas \u201cthe gift of the Nile.\u201d The dating for the beginning of the civilization along the Nile River is often in question,\nbut Egyptologists estimate the first dynasty ruled both Upper and Lower Egypt around 3100 BCE. Upper Egypt is\nin the south and Lower Egypt is in the north because the Nile River flows north. The terms \u201cUpper\u201d and \u201cLower\u201d\nrefer to elevation. Geologists, using the erosion patterns of the Sphinx, estimate that it was constructed about\n10,000 BCE. The ability of humans to harness the potential of the environment set the stage for technological\nadvancements that continue to this day. The Egyptian civilization flourished for thousands of years and spawned\na legacy that influenced their neighbors in the region, who benefited from their advancements.\nFigure 8.4 Egyptian Pyramids of the Giza Plateau\nAll Giza Pyramids\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe human activities that created the civilizations in Mesopotamia and along Egypt\u2019s Nile River gave humanity a\nrich heritage to help us understand our history. Many of our legends, stories, and myths have their origins in these\ncultures. Their cultural developments provided the basis for much of the Western world\u2019s religious beliefs and\nearly philosophical ideas. The engineering feats needed to create the magnificent temples and pyramids have by 593 World Regional Geography\nthemselves been studied and analyzed over the centuries to give modern scientists and scholars a reason to pause\nand recognize the high level of organization and structure that must have gone into developing and managing\nthese civilizations. Various aspects of science and the arts were being developed by these ancient people. Writing,\nmathematics, engineering, and astronomy were becoming highly advanced. Artifacts such as clay tablets and\nhieroglyphs are still being discovered and interpreted and shed additional light on the advancements of these\ncivilizations and their contribution to our collective human civilization.\nAccess to Fresh Water\nWater is one of the necessities for human existence, and human settlements have long been based on the\navailability of water for human consumption and agriculture, navigation, and the production of energy. In North\nAfrica and Southwest Asia, the availability of water has an even greater relevance because of the dominant type\nB climate. Methods used to address the shortage of water or to access fresh water have been nearly as diverse\nas the people who live here. Large populations of people can be found wherever there is fresh water. Water has\nhistorically been transferred from source to destination through canals, aqueducts, or special channels. Many ruins\nof extensive aqueducts from Roman times and earlier remain throughout the realm. The issues associated with\nwater use continue to affect the lives of the people of this realm. Rapid population growth and industrialization\nhave intensified the demand for fresh water.\nFigure 8.5 Roman Aqueduct Near Caesarea 8.1 Introducing the Realm 594\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nWater can be found in the desert regions in a range of forms. For example, there are oases, springs, or noted wells\nfrom which people can draw underground water that is close to the surface. Mountainous regions such as the Atlas\nMountains in North Africa or the Elburz Mountains in Iran trap moisture, which produces higher quantities of\nprecipitation. The precipitation is then available in the valleys to irrigate crops. Discovering or developing other\nmethods of acquiring fresh water is a requirement in areas without mountains.\nUnderground Water in Libya\nIn the Sahara region, Libya draws water from deep underground wells that tap into the vast aquifers beneath the\ndesert that were charged with water when the region was tropical thousands of years ago. The water is referred\nto as fossil water. Extensive systems of canals and pipelines have been developed in Libya to extract fossil water\nand use it for agricultural production or for urban purposes. The man-made river project, one of the largest of its\nkind, has drawn fresh water from the desert to large cities such Tripoli and Benghazi. The local drinking water\nin Benghazi is contaminated by saltwater intrusion from the Mediterranean. Underground aquifers are underneath\npolitical boundaries, so the allocation and control of water are matters of political debate with the potential to\nlead to military conflict. The project\u2019s potential duration will be a function of how quickly the water is used and\nhow many people use the aquifer system. The main problem with this system is that underground aquifers are not\nconsidered a renewable resource; as more countries tap into the aquifers, the available water will be depleted more\nquickly. As water is drawn from the aquifers for industrial irrigation, the water table goes down. Local settlements 595 World Regional Geography\nthat rely on well water may in time have to dig deeper wells or move to locations where water resources are still\navailable.\nNile Water in Egypt\nEgypt draws water from the Nile to irrigate fields for extensive food production. For thousands of years, floods\nof the Nile annually covered the land with fresh silt and water. This made the land productive, but the flooding\noften caused serious damage to human infrastructure. The building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1970s helped\ncontrol the flooding of the Nile Valley. The river no longer flooded annually, and water had to be pumped onto\nthe land. Over time, the constant and extensive use of this type of irrigation causes the small quantities of salt in\nthe water to build up in the soil to serious levels, thereby reducing the land\u2019s productivity. This process, called\nsalinization, is a common problem in arid climates. To rid the soil of the salts, fresh water is needed to flood the\nfields, dissolving the salt and then moving the salty water back off the fields. High salinization in the soil and the\nreduction in agricultural productivity is a growing concern for Egypt. Egypt\u2019s growing population places a high\ndemand on the availability of food. More than half of the eighty million people in Egypt live in rural areas, and\nmany of them make their living in agriculture, growing food that plays a critical role in the country\u2019s economic\nstability\nWater from the Tigris and Euphrates\nThe major source of water in the Fertile Crescent region comes from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Both have\ntheir origins in Turkey and converge at the Shatt al-Arab waterway that flows into the Persian Gulf. The Euphrates 8.1 Introducing the Realm 596\nis the longest river in Southwest Asia and flows through Syria from Turkey before entering into Iraq. Turkey had\ndeveloped large dams on both the Tigris and Euphrates for agricultural purposes and to generate hydroelectric\npower. As water is diverted for agriculture in Turkey there is less water flowing downstream for Syria or Iraq.\nDisputes over water resources continue to be a major concern in the Tigris-Euphrates Basin. The Atat\u00fcrk Dam\nin Turkey is largest dam on the Euphrates, and it has a reservoir behind the dam that is large enough to hold the\ntotal annual discharge of the river. All three countries have dams on the Euphrates and both Turkey and Iraq have\ndams on the Tigris. The three countries signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009 to strengthen cooperation\nwithin the Tigris-Euphrates Basin. All three countries need the water for agriculture to produce food for a growing\npopulation. Agreements to share water have been difficult as a result of the Iraq War and the recent protests and\ndemonstrations in Syria that have contributed to further political tension between the three countries.\nWater Conservation in Israel\nIsrael has taken innovative steps to conserve water and use it efficiently. Drip irrigation mixed with fertilizers\nis called fertigation. Fertigation is used extensively in the area. Israel grows plantation crops such as bananas,\nwhich require large quantities of water. Banana groves are covered with material that allows sunlight to penetrate\nbut reduces the amount of transpiration, which conserves water. Israel has worked to recycle water whenever\npossible. Gray water is water extracted from sewage that has been treated to be used in agriculture. Underground\nwells in the West Bank region provide water for a high percentage of people in both the Palestinian areas and\nIsrael. The issue of control over the water is contentious at times. Just as the control of water may have been an\nimportant factor in the early Mesopotamian civilizations, it remains a point of political conflict in places such as\nIsrael and the West Bank. The lack of fresh water and the heavier demand placed on water resources have caused\ncountries that can afford it to desalinize seawater. This process is used extensively in the oil-rich states of the\nArabian Peninsula. Israel is implementing a similar plan to accommodate their increasing population and fresh\nwater requirements. 597 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.6 Banana Grove in Israel Near the Lebanese Border\nThe grove is covered with material that allows sunlight to penetrate but helps reduce the loss of water through transpiration.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nMountain Water in Iran\nIran is largely a desert climate; thus most of the country does not receive copious amounts of precipitation. In an\neffort to redistribute the water available from the high mountains, Iranians have developed a system of qanats\nto collect water where it is available and channel it to the cities or urban areas for use. A qanat might include a\nsystem of shafts or wells along a mountain slope that allows water to collect into a common underground channel,\nwhich is then diverted to wherever it is needed. This system has been in use since ancient times in many arid\nregions of the realm and around the world. More than 2,700 years ago, a qanat was developed in what is present-\nday Iran. The qanat has a system of hundreds of wells and channels water for more than twenty-eight miles; it\nstill provides drinking water to more than forty thousand people in the city of Gonabad. Thousands of qanats\nwere developed over the centuries in this area. Persians used cold qanat water from the mountains to keep ice\ncool during the summer months. Agricultural production relies heavily on water from qanats, which in turn are\ndependent on climate conditions and local weather patterns. 8.1 Introducing the Realm 598\nWater Shortages in Arabia\nThe Arabian Peninsula almost always conjures up images of desert conditions; contrary to that image, there is\nwater in the peninsula. Underground aquifers of fossil water are located beneath the sands similar to that in the\nSahara Desert. Saudi Arabia taps into these water resources to irrigate agricultural land to grow food. This area\nfaces the same issue as Libya and other areas of the world that rely on underground aquifers: eventually the water\nsupply will be used up. The majority of the Arabian Peninsula is desert and water is always in short supply.\nMany coastal desert countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Qatar have resorted to the\ndesalinization of seawater for their needs, but this is viable only as long as the country can afford the energy cost\nrequired to operate the desalinization plants.\nYemen is a state on the Arabian Peninsula that is mountainous and has used terracing to more effectively benefit\nfrom what little precipitation they receive. Water from precipitation is trapped in terraces, and as it flows down the\nmountainside, each terrace uses what it needs and then passes the water to the next lower terrace. More land can\nbe farmed to produce higher yields of agricultural crops such as sorghum and cereals. One of the main problems\nwith Yemen\u2019s terrace system is that most of its trees are being cut down for firewood. Tree roots are essential\nfor holding the soil together on the fragile mountain slopes. Another problem is heavy rains that cause serious\nerosion and damage to the terrace system. Additionally, the extremely rapid growth rate of Yemen\u2019s population is\noutstripping its agricultural production.\nDiversion of Water in Turkestan\nFresh water is in short supply in many of the desert regions of Turkestan in Central Asia. Agricultural production\nhas traditionally been dependent on water flowing in rivers and streams that originated with the precipitation from\nthe mountains, but as humans have developed canals and irrigation systems, water from rivers has been diverted\nfor agricultural use. Vast fields of cash crops such as cotton were developed during the Soviet era for economic\nreasons, and as discussed in more detail in Section 8.7 \u201cCentral Asia and Afghanistan\u201d, the result had devastating\nconsequences for the Aral Sea, which depended on the water from these rivers for its survival. More than half the\npopulation of Central Asia depends on agriculture for their livelihood. The other half, of course, requires water\nand food for their existence. 599 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.7 Precipitation Patterns for North Africa and Southwest Asia\nArab Spring of 2011\nThe year 2011 brought about important changes for the human geography of parts of this realm. The year ushered\nin a wave of human activity that awakened the power of the citizens to speak out against conditions in their\ncountry and actively protest against their governments. North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula\nexperienced the highest levels of protests and insurgency. Political leaders that had been in power for extended\nperiods were challenged and removed from office. Democratic reforms were requested or demanded by citizens\nseeking more individual freedom and greater access to political power. Uprisings in some of the countries were\ninternal; other countries received external support or intervention. Overall, demonstrations, protests, and outright\nrevolution involved millions of people desiring improved living conditions and a better future for themselves and\ntheir families. 8.1 Introducing the Realm 600\nProtests emerged in North Africa in the beginning of 2011. Tunisia was the first country in which leadership\nfelt the heat of civil resistance and open revolution. In January, the Tunisian president of more than twenty-three\nyears was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia. In Egypt, millions of protesters demonstrated in the streets against\npolitical corruption and the lack of reforms. The revolution of Egypt\u2019s citizens was not an armed conflict, but it\nwas an effective protest, because it eventually brought about the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, who had\nbeen in office for almost thirty years. Demonstrations and protests continued against governments in Morocco and\nAlgeria; the people voiced their concerns regarding issues such as high unemployment, poor living conditions,\nand government corruption. Libya\u2019s protests erupted into a full-scale armed revolution as antigovernment rebels\ntook control of the city of Benghazi in an attempt to topple Muammar Gadhafi\u2019s forty-two years of authoritarian\ncontrol of the government, oil revenues, and the people. The armed Libyan revolution was eventually successful\nin taking control of Tripoli and in removing Gadhafi and his family from power. The revolution in Libya was\naided by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air strikes and the implementation of a no-fly zone over the\ncountry.\nThe ripple effect that the Tunisian revolution had on North Africa was felt on the Arabian Peninsula in places\nsuch as Yemen and Bahrain. Mass public demonstrations in Yemen over government corruption, economic\nconditions, and high unemployment escalated into serious armed conflicts between government troops and\nopposition factions that wanted the president removed from office. In Bahrain, the protests and demonstrations\nwere centered on the request for more personal freedoms and a greater role in leadership for the Shia population,\nwho experienced discrimination by the Sunni-dominated government. Protests also occurred in Oman for greater\nreforms.\nThe Middle East did not escape the Arab Spring of 2011. Protests in Jordan forced King \u2018Abdullah II to reorganize\nhis government. Israel and Lebanon were not as affected, as they have been addressing many of these issues\non an ongoing basis. The country experiencing the greatest impact was Syria. Major mass demonstrations and\nserious protests against the government were staged in a number of cities across the country. In Syria, the long-\nterm leadership of an Alawite minority continues to run the government and control the military. The al-Assad\nfamily\u2014a father and then his son\u2014has ruled Syria since 1971. The Syrian government has cracked down on the\nrevolution with hard-line measures aimed at subduing the protests and demonstrations. By September 2011, more\nthan two thousand protesters had been killed in Syria, and many more were detained or tortured. Countless others\nhave tried to flee to neighboring countries for their safety. The protesters in Syria want democratic reforms as well\nas the end of the al-Assad family reign.\nOther parts of the realm also felt the effects of the Arab Spring of 2011 with mixed results. Iran has had similar\nprotests and demonstrations in past years, but there was not a major revolution or uprising as a direct result of the\nArab Spring. Iran is not an Arab country but has experienced ongoing political friction between citizen factions\nand the government. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have tempered or isolated internal protests or revolutionary\nactivities in those countries even though armed conflicts continue. Various Central Asian states have been working\nthrough similar issues but either have not had mass demonstrations or have not received the attention of news\nmedia regarding their situations. The wave of change that swept over the realm in the Arab Spring of 2011 is an\nexample of how centripetal and centrifugal cultural forces act on a state or region. The political landscape was\naltered or drastically changed in many countries. The impact of these changes will be realized in the years and\ndecades to come. 601 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The realm of North Africa and Southwest Asia extends from the Atlantic Ocean along the Moroccan coast\nto the western border of China. It includes the regions of North Africa, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia\n(often referred to as Turkestan).\n\u2022 Three basic features that dominate this realm include the arid type B climates, Islam as the predominant\nreligion, and the export of petroleum and minerals to gain wealth. There are exceptions to all three features,\nbut these three are found within most countries of the realm.\n\u2022 The two main cultural hearths in this realm are located along the rivers in Mesopotamia and in Egypt.\nControl of and access to water resources to grow excess food were the basis for the success of the empires\nthat flourished in these two areas.\n\u2022 Fresh water is a valuable resource that is not always available in North Africa and Southwest Asia because\nof the climate and physical geography. Each region within the realm has developed its own methods to draw\nfrom or extract the valuable resource of fresh water.\n\u2022 The Arab Spring of 2011 was a massive wave of protests and demonstrations by citizens of the realm\nagainst their governments over such issues as poor living conditions, high unemployment, government\ncorruption, and the lack of democratic reforms. Various leaders were removed from office and governments\nwere pressed to reform their power structures to allow for more shared governance and reduced political\ncorruption.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

South of Mecca, the mountains\nreach more than 7,200 feet in elevation. According to Islamic tradition, the patriarch Abraham came to Mecca\nwith his Egyptian wife Hagar and their son Ishmael more than two thousand years before the birth of the Prophet\nMuhammad (born 571 CE). When Hagar died, Abraham and Ishmael built the Kaaba (or Ka\u2018ba), a rectangular\nshrine that included a special stone, in Mecca. The shrine was destined to become one of the holiest sites for\nnomadic groups in Arabia. Abraham later died in Palestine in what is now the country of Israel. Centuries after\nAbraham\u2019s death, the Kaaba and the rituals associated with it deteriorated and mixed with other local traditions.\nThe Prophet Muhammad\nThe traditional groups in the region of Arabia were polytheistic and worshiped their own gods. By the time of\nMuhammad, Mecca is said to have been a center of worship to more than 360 deities or gods; the greatest of these\nwas Allah (meaning \u201cthe god\u201d). Allah was known as the chief of the Meccan pantheon of gods and was worshiped\nfrom southern Syria to Arabia. Mecca was full of idols, temples, and worship sites. Tradition states that the god\nAllah was the only god without an idol; he would become the sole entity of Muhammad\u2019s new Islamic religion.\nMuhammad, born in Mecca 571 years after the birth of Christ and about 100 years after the fall of the Roman\nEmpire, was orphaned at an early age, and was employed in a camel caravan when he reached his teens. His\nlife and what has been reported about it changed the Middle East forever. Muhammad traveled throughout the\nregion with the camel caravans. He was fortunate to have been able to live as he did, because most orphans in\nthe region did not have many opportunities in life. His travels introduced him to many people, places, and issues.\nHis situation changed when Muhammad and a widow many years his senior were married. Muhammad became a\nmerchant, the leader of a camel caravan, and a respected member of his community. He was reported to have been\nintelligent and a wise businessman.\nThe traditional groups that traded in Mecca held many different religious beliefs. The city was a forum for the\nmany vices and activities associated with trade, travel, and metropolitan business. To escape the activities of 605 World Regional Geography\nMecca, Muhammad would often seek the solitude of the mountains, where he would contemplate and think.\nTradition states that the angel Gabriel appeared to him while he was meditating in a mountain cave in 610 CE,\nwhen Muhammad was about forty. Muhammad was given words from Allah, which he recited from memory to\nhis followers. According to tradition, Muhammad was illiterate; his supporters wrote down his words, compiled\nthem into the Koran (Qur\u2019an), the holiest book of Islam. Muhammad was the founder of the new religion, which\nhe called Islam (meaning \u201csubmission to Allah\u201d). The term Muslim (meaning \u201cone who submits\u201d) refers to a\nfollower of Islam.\nAfter Muhammad returned to Mecca and related his visions and Allah\u2019s words from the angel Gabriel, he began\nto speak out against the city\u2019s vices and many gods. He stated that there was only one god: Allah, the same creator\ngod of Abraham. He spoke out against gambling and drinking alcohol. He advocated the caretaking of widows\nand orphans. He also preached regarding family and community. His message was not well received: in 622 CE\nthe people of Mecca forced Muhammad out. He fled to the safety of the nearby city of Medina in a journey known\nas the hejira (hijra). This historic journey became the start of the Islamic calendar, which is based on the lunar\ncycles. Muhammad found refuge in Medina and became a respected citizen.\nLaunching out from Medina, Muhammad and those loyal to him defeated the army of Mecca and converted the\ncity into Islam\u2019s holiest place. They destroyed all Mecca\u2019s idols and temples except the Kaaba. Muhammad\u2019s\nteaching united the many Arabian groups under one religion. Since the Koran was written in Arabic, Arabic\nbecame the official language of Islam. The Kaaba and the mosque built at Mecca became the center of the Islamic\nworld and a destination for Muslim pilgrims. Islam brought a new identity, a faith in one god, and a set of values\nto the Arab world. Islam made sense in a world with many traditional beliefs and few unifying principles.\nFigure 8.9 Traditional Succession of the Three Main Monotheistic Religions of the Middle East:\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam 8.2 Muhammad and Islam 606\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that monotheist belief was not new: Christianity had been around for more than\nsix hundred years. Judaism and Zoroastrianism in Persia had been around for centuries before Christianity. The\nprinciples of Islam and Muhammad\u2019s teachings are a continuation of Judaism and Christianity. All three traditions\nassert a faith in a divine creator, with important messages coming through prophets or holy messengers. All\nthree religions acknowledge Abraham as a founding patriarch. Muslims believe that Moses and Jesus were major\nprophets and that Muhammad was the greatest and final prophet. All three religions have stories about creation,\nAdam and Eve, the flood, and other similar stories that have been adapted to the traditions and characters of each\nreligion.\nReligion is a part of culture. The religions that emerged out of the Middle East absorbed many of the existing\ncultural traits, traditions, or habits of the people into their religious practices. Early Islam adapted many Arab\ncultural traits, styles of dress, foods, and the pilgrimage and folded them into its principles. Early Christianity and\nJudaism also adopted cultural traits, holidays, styles of dress, and cultural traditions. 607 World Regional Geography\nSpatial Diffusion\nThe spread of Islam was accomplished through trade and conquest. Mecca was a center of trade. When camel\ncaravans left Mecca, they carried Muhammad\u2019s teachings with them. Islam diffused from Mecca and spread\nthroughout the Middle East and into Central Asia and North Africa. The geographic principle of spatial diffusion\ncan be applied to any phenomenon, idea, disease, or concept that spreads through a population across space and\nthrough time. The spatial diffusion of Islam outward from Mecca was significant and predictable.\nThere are two main types of spatial diffusion: expansion diffusion and relocation diffusion. Expansion diffusion\nhas two main subtypes: contagious diffusion and hierarchical diffusion. A religion can spread from individual to\nindividual through contagious diffusion when a religion starts at one point and propagates or expands outward\nfrom person to person or place to place in a pattern similar to the spreading of a disease. Another way a religion\ncan spread through expansion diffusion is hierarchically, when rulers of a region convert to the religion and decree\nit as the official religion of their realm; the religion filters down the political chain of command and eventually\nreaches the masses. The second type of diffusion, relocation diffusion, takes place when the religion relocates\nto a new place from a central point. When Islam jumped from the Middle East to Indonesia, it diffused through\nrelocation. Relocation diffusion also occurred when Islam spread to the United States.\nFigure 8.10 Diffusion of Islam and the Ten Countries with the Highest Muslim Populations 8.2 Muhammad and Islam 608\nData courtesy of Pew Research Center, Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World\u2019s\nMuslim Population.\nFigure 8.11 Faithful Muslims Praying toward Mecca in Umayyad, Damascus 609 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0.\nEarly on, the unifying principles of Islam found their way into the regional groups of Arabia and into the minds\nof their leaders. By 700 CE, Islam had spread to the east, to the Mogul Empire of Pakistan and northern India.\nIn India, the Emperor Shah Jehan, who built the famous architectural marvel of the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum\nfor his wife, was a Muslim. The expansion of Islam fueled the Arab Empire of the Middle East. The capital\ncity of the Arab Empire was first established at Medina and then moved to Damascus and later to Baghdad.\nWhile Europe was enduring the Dark Ages, Islam was experiencing a renaissance, expanding its knowledge of\nmathematics, architecture, and the sciences. The Arab institutions of higher learning kept the Greek classics alive\nand established universities in Toledo (Spain), Cairo, and Baghdad. As of 2010, Islam has attracted as many as 1.5\nbillion followers, second only to Christianity, which has about 2 billion followers. Hinduism is third, with about\n900 million followers. Buddhism is considered the world\u2019s fourth-largest religion. 8.2 Muhammad and Islam 610\nThe Five Pillars of Islam\nThe basic tenets of the Five Pillars of Islam create the foundational structure of Islam. Prayer is an important part\nof the religion. A Muslim must offer prayers five times a day: before sunrise, at midday, at midafternoon, after\nsunset, and in the early evening. During prayer, Muslims face toward the compass direction of Mecca. Before\nclocks and time were well established, a mosque leader would climb a minaret (a tall tower next to the mosque,\ntheir place of public worship) and call the faithful to prayer at the required times of day. Muslims gather together\nfor common prayer on Friday, which is a time to unite the community of believers. Mosques sprang up after\nMuhammad died, and they became the center of community activities in the Islamic world.\nThe Five Pillars of Islam can be translated as follows:\n1. Express the basic creed (Shahadah). Profess that there is no god but Allah and his messenger and\nprophet is Muhammad.\n2. Perform the prayers (Salat). Pray five times a day.\n3. Pay alms or give to charity (Zakat). Share what you have with people who are less fortunate.\n4. Fast (Sawm). During the month of Ramadan, abstain from personal needs, drinking, and eating from\ndawn to dusk (as one\u2019s health permits).\n5. Make the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Conduct at least one pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca (if\nwithin one\u2019s capacity).\nThe Death of Muhammad\nMuhammad died at the age of sixty-two. He never claimed to be a god or anything other than a mere mortal. His\ntomb is located in Medina, the City of the Prophet. No provision was made to continue Muhammad\u2019s work after\nhe died. One division thought his successor should be a blood relative. This division led to the Shia (or Shi\u2019ite)\nbranch of Islam, which makes up about 15 percent of Muslims. Others felt that the successor should be a worthy\nfollower and did not need to be a blood relative. This branch became known as Sunni, which makes up about 84\npercent of Muslims. Various smaller branches of Islam also exist, including Sufi, which approaches the Islamic\nfaith from a more mystical and spiritual perspective. 611 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.12 Three Main Divisions of Islam with Approximate Percentages\nSunni Muslims look to the family and community for direction; Sunni leaders are elected by the whole\ncommunity. Shia Muslims look to their imams for the official source of direction. Imams hold the religious and\npolitical leadership in the Shia faith. Through the right of divine appointment, Imams are considered by many in\nthe Shia division to hold absolute spiritual authority. Imams often have the final word regarding religious doctrine.\nShia Muslims consider Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law and cousin Ali to be the origin of the direct line of succession\nfor Imams. Ali is considered in Islam to have been the first person to accept and follow the words of Muhammad.\nThere are many subgroups or branches in each of the Islamic divisions.\nIn understanding the Middle East, it is most critical to understand the Sunni and Shia divisions of Islam. The Shia\nand Sunni divisions of Islam have sometimes had divergent beliefs, resulting in conflicts. In the early sixteenth\ncentury, the Persian Empire, which is now Iran, declared the Shia branch its official religion. Its surrounding\nneighbors were predominantly Sunni. This divergence is part of the basis for the current civil unrest in Iraq. The\ntwo divisions of Islam currently vie for political power and control in Iraq. The majority of the Arab population in\nIraq, about 60 percent in 2010, follows the Shia division of Islam, but the leadership under Saddam Hussein until\n2003 was Sunni. Tradition states that Ali is buried in the Iraqi city of Najaf, which is considered by Shia Muslims\nto be one of the holiest sites in Islam. Just north of Najaf is the city of Karbala, which is also considered to be\na holy place for Shia Muslims because it is the burial place of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson Husayn. The\nShia majority in Iraq who are Arab share their faith with the Shia majority in Iran who are ethnically Persian. 8.2 Muhammad and Islam 612\nSecular State versus Religious State\nIslam has a code of law called the Sharia criminal code, which is similar to Old Testament law. The Sharia dictates\ncapital punishment for certain crimes. For example, if a person is caught stealing, his or her arm would be severed.\nFor more serious offenses, he or she would be beheaded or stoned to death. Some countries use the Sharia as the\nlaw of their country. Countries are called religious states (Islamic states in this case) when religious codes take\nprecedence over civil law. States in which people democratically vote on civil law based on common agreement\nare called secular states. Whereas secular states attempt to separate religious issues and civil law, religious states\nattempt to combine the two. Iran is a good example of an Islamic religious state, and Turkey is a good example of\na secular state. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 and Saddam Hussein was removed from leadership,\nthe country entered a transitional period in which they had to decide if the country would develop into an Islamic\nstate with the Sharia or move to a democratically elected government with civil law. The debate on these issues\ncontinually surfaces in many of the countries in North Africa and Southwest Asia whenever transition occurs.\nThe cultural forces of democratic reforms and Islamic fundamentalism have been pushing and pulling on the\nIslamic world. Democratic reformers push for a more open society with equality for women, social freedoms for\nthe people, and democratically elected leaders in government. Islamic fundamentalists pull back toward a stricter\nfollowing of Islamic teachings; they oppose what they consider the decadent and vulgar ways of Western society\nand wish to restrict the influence of liberal, nonreligious teaching. A rift between militant Islamic fundamentalists\nand moderate Islamic reformers is evident throughout the Muslim world. Militant leaders strive to uphold the\nSharia criminal code as law. Moderate reformers work toward a civil law based on democratic consensus. This rift\nadds to the conflicts that have been occurring in this realm. Islamic fundamentalists push for a more traditional\nand conservative society and express opposition to the United States\u2019 intervention in the realm. The Muslim world\nwill continue to confront such arguments over the future direction of Islam in a globalized economy.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Islam has its origins with Muhammad, who was born 571 years after the birth of Jesus, when Christianity\nwas well established. Muhammad received his revelations through the angel Gabriel and passed them to his\nfollowers, who wrote down his words into what became the Koran.\n\u2022 Islam is the youngest of the three major monotheistic religions of the realm: Judaism, Christianity, and\nIslam. All three trace their origins back to the patriarch Abraham. Other monotheistic religions, such as the\nBaha\u2019i faith and Zoroastrianism, are also evident in the Southwest Asia.\n\u2022 Spatial diffusion can be applied to any phenomenon, idea, disease, or concept that spreads through a\npopulation across space and through time. Islam has diffused through both expansion diffusion and\nrelocation diffusion to become the second most followed religion in the world.\n\u2022 Since the death of Muhammad, Islam has divided into a number of different factions. The two most\nprevalent divisions of Islam are Sunni (followed by about 84 percent of Muslims) and Shia (followed by\nabout 15 percent of Muslims). Other minor divisions of Islam, such as Sufi, also exist.\n\u2022 Religious states are structured around laws based on religious regulations that are usually determined by\nreligious leaders. Secular states are structured around civil law, which is decided on by democratic\nconsensus. 613 World Regional Geography\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the historical geography of North Africa, identify the major physical features and the main\ncities, and understand who the people are and where most of the population lives in the region.\n2. Understand the unique geographic qualities of the Maghreb and explain how this region is connected to\nEurope.\n3. Outline the political issues in North Africa and understand the transitions and conflicts occurring in the\ngovernments of the region.\n4. Describe the main qualities of the African Transition Zone and explain how the dynamics of this zone are\naffecting the country of Sudan.\nNorth Africa\u2019s primary connection with the Middle East and Central Asia is that Islam diffused to North Africa\nfrom the Middle East and Central Asia. Today, it is a Muslim-dominated realm with Arabic as its primary\nlanguage. Historically, the ethnicity of North Africa was predominantly Berber with the nomadic Tuareg and\nother local groups interspersed. When Islam diffused into North Africa, the Arab influence and culture were\ninfused with it. Modern Egypt has become the cornerstone of the Arab world; more Arabs live in Cairo than in\nany other city on Earth. The three main areas of interest are the Maghreb of the northwest; the Nile River valley\nin the east; and the African Transition Zone, where the Sahara Desert transitions into the tropical type A climates\nof Central Africa\u2019s equatorial region.\nFigure 8.13 North Africa and the Maghreb\n614 615 World Regional Geography\nThe Maghreb traditionally includes Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but Libya is also considered part of the Maghreb by many\ninhabitants of the region.\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nIslam diffused through North Africa to the Berber people of the Maghreb and entered Europe across the Strait of\nGibraltar to the Iberian Peninsula. The Arab-Berber alliance, called the Moors, invaded Spain in 711 CE. The\nIslamic influence thrived in Iberia and would have continued into mainland Europe if not stopped by Christian\nforces such as Charles Martel\u2019s army in the famous Battle of Tours. Islam was eventually pushed out of the Iberian\nPeninsula and held south of the Strait of Gibraltar. Islamic architecture and influence remain part of the heritage\nof Iberia.\nThe historical geography of North Africa is not complete without an understanding of the European influences\nthat have dominated or controlled this region for centuries. The Roman Empire controlled much of the coastal\narea of the Mediterranean during its zenith. The Romans built ports, aqueducts, roads, and valuable infrastructure.\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, common bonds of religion and language were created for the people through\nthe invasion of the Arabs, who introduced the Islamic faith. North Africa was later dominated by European\ncolonialism. France controlled and colonized the region of the Barbary Coast along North Africa\u2019s western\nwaterfront, including Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of Morocco. Italians colonized the region that is now Libya. The\nBarbary Coast of the Mediterranean was once a haven for pirates and a danger to shipping during the colonial\nera. Even the United States involved itself with wars against the pirates off the coast of the Berber states of North\nAfrica during the early 1800s. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Britain controlled Egypt and parts of the\nSudan. The Spanish colonized parts of Morocco and Western Sahara. In due time, resistance movements were\nsuccessful in defeating the colonial powers and declaring independence for all the countries of North Africa.\nHowever, the European influence remains through the region\u2019s dependence on trade and economic partnerships\nwith Europe.\nNorth Africa is separated from Subsaharan Africa by the African Transition Zone, a transitional area between\nIslamic-dominated North Africa and animist- and Christian-dominated Subsaharan Africa. It is also a transition\nbetween the Sahara Desert and the tropical type A climates of Africa\u2019s equatorial region. This is a zone subject\nto shifting boundaries. The region was once a major trade route between the Mali Empire of the west and the 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 616\ntrade centers of Ethiopia in the east. Camel caravans have crossed this sector of Africa for centuries, and camel\ncaravans from Mecca might have traveled across this zone. Many nomadic groups continue to herd their livestock\nacross the region in search of grazing.\nThe Maghreb: \u201cIsle of the West\u201d\nThe Maghreb is a region extending from Morocco to Libya that is distinguished by the main ranges of the Atlas\nMountains, which reach elevations of near thirteen thousand feet. The main Atlas range is often snow-covered\nat higher elevations. The name Maghreb, which in Arabic means \u201cIsle of the West,\u201d receives between ten and\nthirty inches of rainfall per year. This is substantially more rainfall than what is received in the Sahara Desert to\nthe south. The Atlas Mountains extract precipitation from the air in the form of rain or snow, which allows fruits\nand vegetables to be grown in the fertile mountain valleys of the Maghreb. To the south of this region is the vast\nSahara Desert with lower precipitation and warmer temperatures. Libya is actually outside the range of the Atlas\nMountains but is associated with the Maghreb by most local inhabitants.\nFigure 8.14 The Main Mountain Ranges of the Maghreb 617 World Regional Geography\nThe Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb extend to the east and west of the main ranges.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nAided by a moderate type C climate, the northern coastal region of the Maghreb and the mountain valleys are a\ncenter for agricultural production, including grapes, dates, oranges, olives, and other food products. Think about\nhow geography affects population: Which climate type do most human groups gravitate toward? What conditions\nwill you find when you combine this climate type and generous quantities of water and food? As you fit the pieces\nof the geographic puzzle together, you can understand why populations centralize in some places and not in others.\nThe Maghreb is an attractive place for human habitation, but it borders on the inhospitable vastness of the Sahara\nDesert. Most of the Maghreb\u2019s residents live in cities along the Mediterranean coast. There are few people in the\nvast desert interior of these countries. The exceptions are groups such as the Tuareg that are found in the Sahara.\nThe Maghreb is an expansive region with countries of size. Algeria, Libya, and Morocco are large countries in\nterms of physical area. Algeria is Africa\u2019s largest country as of 2011. Algeria is similar in area to the entire United\nStates east of the Mississippi River, Libya is larger than the state of Alaska, and Morocco is the size of the state\nof California. A large percentage of Algeria south of the Maghreb and a large percentage of the area south of the\nMediterranean coastline in Libya fit the classification of desert conditions. The largest cities of Libya are along\nthe coast, but other Libyan cities are positioned in the desert region. Tunisia, the smallest of the countries on the\nMediterranean, is about the same size as the US state of Wisconsin and has mountains in its north and desert areas\nto the southwest.\nAll the countries of the Maghreb have former connections to Europe. These ties have strengthened in recent years\nbecause of an increase in trade and the economic dependencies that have been created between Europe and the\nMediterranean. North Africa can grow fruit and vegetable crops that are not as plentiful in the colder northern\nlatitudes. In the last half of the twentieth century, an enormous amount of oil was discovered in the Maghreb,\nand Europe has a growing need for energy. The discovery of oil changed the trade equation: oil and natural gas\nrevenues subsequently advanced past agricultural goods as the main export products. Oil and natural gas exports\nnow make up 95 percent of the export income for Algeria and Libya. 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 618\nEconomic Geography of the Maghreb\nEurope, which is in the higher stages of the index of economic development, has small families with fewer young\npeople to fill entry-level service jobs, and North Africa has a burgeoning population of young people seeking\nemployment. Many people from North Africa speak the languages of their former colonial masters, and when they\nleave North Africa seeking employment, they find the transition to a European lifestyle relatively straightforward.\nMigration from the shores of North Africa to Europe is not difficult; the Strait of Gibraltar, for example, is only\nabout nine miles across from Morocco to Spain.\nFigure 8.15 The Strait of Gibraltar\nNorth Africa is separated from the Iberian Peninsula by the Strait of Gibraltar, which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the\nAtlantic Ocean. The distance from Morocco to Spain across the strait is about nine miles, making immigration to Europe from North\nAfrica only a matter of a short boat ride.\nSatellite image courtesy of NASA SRTM Team \u2013 public domain.\nEuropean countries have attempted to implement measures to halt the tide of illegal immigration into their\ncontinent from North Africa but have not been successful. The need for cheap labor in European countries is 619 World Regional Geography\na major economic factor in this equation. The core-periphery spatial relationship creates the push-pull forces\nof migration based on opportunities and advantages. Europe needs cheap labor and more energy, provides\nemployment opportunities, and has an advantage in its higher standards of living: these forces attract immigration\nand pull people toward Europe. North Africa can supply labor and oil, has high levels of unemployment, and\nsuffers from poor economic conditions: these factors push people to emigrate from North Africa to places where\nconditions are more attractive. Europe is the core economic region, and North Africa is the peripheral economic\nregion. People usually shift from periphery to core in their migration patterns, and this is the case across the\nMediterranean.\nEuropean and American influences have been strong in North Africa. Western culture continues to compete\nwith fundamental Islamic tendencies in the region, especially in urban centers. In Morocco, which is the farthest\ncountry from Mecca, democratic reforms have opened the country to more opportunities for women and have led\nto exposure to Western fashions, ideas, and products. Tunisia has a supportive Westernized society. In Libya, birth\ncontrol or family planning products have not always been supported by the government, so family size remained\nrelatively high until about 1985 when it began to decline. Women are allowed to go to college in Libya, but a\nsmaller percentage are enrolled compared to men. More than 90 percent of Libyans live in urban areas. Exposure\nto Western concepts, along with urbanizing and industrializing of the economy, has caused a drop in family size\nin Libya\u2014from 7.5 children in 1975, to about 4.0 children in 1990, and down to 3.0 children in 2010 (Central\nIntelligence Agency). More women are trading traditional dress for Western-style clothing and are entering the\nworkforce to the extent they are allowed.\nPolitical Geography of the Maghreb\nEconomic and political pressures are building across North Africa. Toward the end of 2010 and the spring of 2011,\nactivists called for the governments in North Africa to implement change and address the push of North Africans\nfor stronger democratic openness, less government corruption, and the sharing of wealth accumulated by those\nin power. Leaders have been reluctant to relinquish power and are being challenged by protests and revolution.\nThe driving forces for the people have been high unemployment rates, high food prices, and the lack of adequate\nhousing. 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 620\nWestern Sahara and Morocco\nWestern Sahara is the region south of Morocco. In the latter half of the 1970s, Morocco annexed and took control\nof this region following the withdrawal of Mauritanian control. A local resistance group called the Polisario Front\nchallenged Morocco\u2019s claim to Western Sahara and staged a guerilla war to fight for the independence of Western\nSahara. By 1991, the United Nations (UN) had stepped in, brokered a halt to the fighting, and worked to resolve\nthe matter. Both sides have offered proposals to the UN; Morocco\u2019s plan advocates for annexation, and Polisario\u2019s\nplan is for independence. Western Sahara is mainly desert terrain and only has about three hundred thousand\npeople. The UN delegation has indicated that independence is not realistic. However, talks continue between the\nfactions to work out a solution.\nFigure 8.16 Morocco and Western Sahara 621 World Regional Geography\nAlgeria\nAlgeria has also experienced its share of violent clashes; in this case, the clashes are between Islamic\nfundamentalist groups and the democratically elected government. In the 1990s, the Islamic Salvation Front,\nwhich advocates for a fundamentalist Islamic state in Algeria, challenged the secular political mainstream. The\nelectoral process was interrupted, and the government found itself fighting an Islamic insurgency within the\ncountry. By 1998, more than one hundred thousand people had been killed. The horror of the violence received\ninternational attention. Islamic extremists widened their attacks and massacred entire villages to send a message\nto support their cause. By the end of the decade, government forces gained control of the country, and the Islamic\nSalvation Front officially disbanded. Smaller extremist groups continued to operate. They joined forces with\nOsama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaeda group to create an insurgent group called al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic\nMaghreb, which has continued a campaign of terror and violence against the Algerian government and people in\nthe region with Western interests. Coinciding with similar protests across North Africa, during 2010 and 2011,\nthere was an insurgence of protests and demonstrations against the government of Algeria by its people, who\nwere asking for better living conditions. The government made some concessions to address the issues, but the\npolitical climate in Algeria continues to be tense as the government struggles to find ways to satisfy the needs of\nthe people.\nTunisia\nTunisia was once an outpost of the Roman Empire, and well-preserved Roman ruins can be found throughout\nNorth Africa. In 1956, at the end of the colonial era, France recognized Tunisia\u2019s independence, and the\ncountry established its own government. The political problems in Tunisia today stem from the fact that little\nhas changed in the government since the time of independence. Since independence Tunisia has had few\nchanges in government leaders. The country\u2019s second president, Ben Ali, dominated the country for twenty-\nfour years (1987\u20132011). Ben Ali worked to stem the tide of Islamic fundamentalism, opened the country to\nestablishing rights for women, and allowed more tolerance of religious diversity; however, under his leadership\nthe government struggled to find a balance between democratic openness and authoritarian measures to keep the\ncountry moving forward with economic development and social services for a growing population. 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 622\nFigure 8.17 Egyptian Demonstration\nProtests in Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square on March 4, 2011, were in support of demonstrations in Egypt and in Libya, which followed the\nprotests in Tunisia.\nTarek \u2013 Egyptian and Libyan Flags \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nBeginning in 2010, corruption, unemployment, and a lack of personal freedoms prompted Tunisians to take to the\nstreets in massive protests, which grew into a revolution for change. By the end of the year, President Ben Ali\nwas removed from power and an interim government was formed. Protests continued as the government shifted to\nadapt to the conditions. In 2011, a new constitutional assembly was formed to address changes in the government.\nEconomic conditions have remained thorny during the transition. 623 World Regional Geography\nLibya\nMuammar Gadhafi came to power in Libya in 1969 by overthrowing the king and never held an election for\npolitical control. He used Libya\u2019s oil revenues to build up the country\u2019s infrastructure, enhance his military, and\ncreate an anti-Western terrorist network with weapons production. Personal freedoms have been limited in Libya,\nand there has been no free speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. Gadhafi supported various\nIslamic terrorist groups and nationalized all the oil assets of international corporations in Libya in the early 1980s.\nThis action of nationalism directly opposed and angered many corporate colonialists. His policies caused the\ninternational oil companies, which operated much of the oil industry there, to pressure the US government to\nconduct a series of devastating military bombing raids on Libya in 1986 in an attempt to kill Gadhafi.\nGadhafi deployed his military along Libya\u2019s southern border with Chad in a zone called the Aozou Strip. This\nborder territory was the site of a boundary dispute over land that was reported to hold uranium reserves. Libyan\nforces controlled the Aozou Strip for a number of years before Chad forced them out. In 1994, the UN ruled that\nthe zone belonged to Chad, and the dispute was finally resolved. In other activities, Libyan agents were accused\nof planting bombs on passenger airlines, such as the 1988 explosion on Pan Am flight over Scotland that killed\n270 people and the 1989 explosion of UTA flight 772 over Niger that killed 170 people. After the 9-11 tragedy\nin New York, Gadhafi backed down on his aggressive anti-Western activities and agreed to dismantle some of his\nweapons production facilities and comply with international trade agreements. Libya then denounced terrorism,\nand the United States lifted economic sanctions against Libya and exchanged ambassadors.\nUnrest in Libya surfaced again in 2011, coinciding with protests under way in neighboring Tunisia, Algeria, and\nEgypt. Factions in Libya that opposed Gadhafi\u2019s regime advocated for his removal from office and for more\ndemocratic freedoms. Based in Libya\u2019s second-largest city of Benghazi, in the eastern sector of the country, the\nresistance movement gained momentum and pushed for an all-out civil war that split the country in half. Forces\nloyal to Gadhafi in the capital city of Tripoli in the western part of the country faced off against the separatists\nunder the structure of the National Transitional Council (NTC). In 2011, Gadhafi had been in power for more than\nforty-two years. His family and clan controlled much of the country\u2019s wealth from the export of oil. Gadhafi\u2019s\ncontrol of Libya did not allow for the establishment of strong administrative divisions within the government to\nshare power.\nThe UN, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), implemented a no-fly zone over Libya and\nallowed military strikes against Gadhafi\u2019s forces to stop the massacre of civilians in the civil war. By the end of the\nsummer of 2011, the resistance forces headquartered in Benghazi had pushed across to the western part of Libya\nand took control of Tripoli. Gadhafi was no longer in control of the country, as the NTC became the transitional\npower base. Muammar Gadhafi was killed in October 2011. Post-Gadhafi Libya will most likely be quite different\nfrom the status quo of the past four decades. Nation building will become a major focus for North Africa, which\nmay be more difficult for Libya than its neighbors because of the lack of an administrative structure. 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 624\nFigure 8.18 Control of Cities in Libya Based on the Civil War as of June 5, 2011\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC0 \u2013 public domain.\nThe Nile River and Egypt\nThe Nile River originates in East Africa in Lake Victoria and in Ethiopia in Lake Tana. The White Nile flows\nnorth from Lake Victoria through Uganda and into Sudan, where it converges with the Blue Nile at the city of\nKhartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital. The Blue Nile originates in Lake Tana in Ethiopia. From Khartoum, the Nile River\nflows north through the Nubian Desert into Egypt, where it eventually reaches the Mediterranean Sea. The fresh 625 World Regional Geography\nwater of the Nile is a lifeline that enables agriculture and transportation and supports a growing human population\nin the region.\nFigure 8.19 Nile River System 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 626\nThe White Nile originates in Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile originates in Lake Tana. They converge at Khartoum.\nUntil the Aswan High Dam was completed in 1968, the river flooded its banks yearly, depositing silt and nutrients\nonto the soil and causing enormous damage to infrastructure. As far back as when the pharaohs ruled Egypt, the\npeople used flood irrigation to grow their crops. Today, water is pumped from the controlled Nile River onto the\nfields to water crops. This change has increased the number of crops that can be grown per year. However, it\nhas also caused a buildup of salt in the soil, resulting in declining soil quality. Without annual flooding, the salts\ncannot be dissolved away but remain in the soil, reducing yields. Almost a third of Egypt\u2019s population works in\nagriculture; about half the population is rural. 627 World Regional Geography\nPopulation Dynamics\nCairo, Egypt\u2019s capital, lies at the northern end of the Nile River. With a population of more than ten million, it\nis the largest North African city and home to more Arabs than any other city in the world. It is considered the\ncornerstone city of Arab culture. Cairo is so crowded that more than a million people live in its old cemetery,\nthe City of the Dead. Cairo\u2019s residents, and the millions of people in Egypt, depend on the Nile River for their\nsurvival. About 95 percent of Egypt\u2019s population lives within fifteen miles of the Nile River. As the population has\ngrown, urban expansion has encroached on the farmland of the Nile Valley. Egypt can no longer produce enough\nfood for its people; about 15 percent of its food comes from other countries, mainly the United States.\nConflicts between democratic reforms and Islamic fundamentalism are evident in Egypt. The growing population\nof about eighty million in 2010 is a major concern. In Egypt\u2019s case, democratic reformers were able to promote a\nstrong program of family planning and birth control to help reduce family size, which in 2008 was at 2.8 children\nper woman and declining. The government even created a popular Egyptian soap opera to promote the concept\nthat it was appropriate in an Arab culture to use family planning and have a small family. The prime-time program,\ncalled And the Nile Flows On, told the story of a young village bride dealing with the issues of pregnancy and life\ncomplicated by the interjection of a progressive sheik and a meddling female doctor. The drama addressed many\nfamily planning and religious issues regarding the acceptability of breaking with tradition to address the growing\npopulation problem in Egypt.\nTelevision programming is popular in Egypt, and even reruns of old American shows such as Bonanza and Dallas\nare dubbed into Arabic and shown on Egyptian television. Egypt is a cultural mix with a strong heritage steeped in\nArab history with a secular side that is open to the outside world. The cultural forces that create this paradox have\nnot always been in unison. Egypt has a major connection to Western society because of tourism. The Pyramids of\nGiza and the Great Sphinx are major attractions that pull in millions of people per year from around the world.\nTourism opens up Egypt to outside elements from various cultural backgrounds, most of which are secular.\nPolitical Dynamics\nOn the political front, the democratically elected government has received strong opposition from the Islamic\nBrotherhood, which advocates a more fundamentalist Islamic lifestyle and government structure. The democratic 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 628\nreformers that vie with the Islamic Brotherhood for political power support a more open and democratic civil\ngovernment. These two elements are what drive Egyptian culture and society.\nFigure 8.20 Protesting in Egypt\nOn January 25, 2011, the \u201cDay of Revolt\u201d protests were held in Egypt. Tens of thousands of Egyptians went onto the streets to\npeaceably protest against the Mubarak government.\nMuhammad Ghafari \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe political situation changed in Egypt with the Arab Spring of 2011. Student protests against government\ncorruption and the lack of democratic reforms emerged with an intensity that gained the support of the Egyptian\npeople and forced the Egyptian government to respond. Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak had been in power\nsince 1981 after the assassination of the previous president, Anwar Sadat. President Mubarak was able to win\nevery election for president that had been held since that time. Millions of Egyptians took to the streets in early\n2011 in civil protests against the Mubarak government. Massive protests and demonstrations continued until 629 World Regional Geography\nFebruary 11, when President Mubarak announced his resignation. The transition to an interim government has\nbeen complicated by continued protests and calls for justice from the people, who have called for Mubarak to\nstand trial for stealing billions of dollars from the state and concealing it in his own bank accounts. The people and\nthe government continue to search for progressive opportunities to address their issues. What started out as the\nArab Spring turned into the Arab Year as all three long-term leaders in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt were removed\nfrom positions of power.\nThe African Transition Zone\nFigure 8.21 Camel and Tuareg Rider in the Southern Sahara Desert 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 630\nThe Tuareg are masters of the desert and camels. They often lead camel caravans on long trips through the desert.\nMarco Bellucci \u2013 Tuaregs with their dromedaries \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nStretching across the widest part of Africa on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert is the African Transition\nZone. Known as the Sahel, meaning \u201cborder or margin,\u201d this zone is where the dry arid conditions of the desert\nnorth meet up with the moister region of the tropics. For thousands of years, the seasonal grazing lands of the\nSahel have been home to nomadic groups herding their livestock across the zone and eking out a living held\ntogether by tradition and heritage. Changing climate conditions and overgrazing has enhanced the desertification\nprocess, and the region is slowly turning into desert. The Sahara Desert is shifting southward, altering the\neconomic activities of the millions of people who live in its path. Ten thousand years ago, North Africa and the 631 World Regional Geography\nSahara Desert were tropical environments filled with all the biodiversity and wildlife now found in Subsaharan\nAfrica. This desertification process has been occurring for centuries; it is not a new process. Human factors and\nclimate change may be accelerating this process, but they did not create it.\nPolitical stability is complicated to achieve in the African Transition Zone. The political borders established\nby European colonialism during the Berlin Conference of 1884 remain basically intact and create barriers that\nhamper the nomadic groups from traveling through the Sahel in search of grazing land for their livestock.\nPolitical boundaries now restrict movement and keep people divided and separated into national identities. The\nAfrican Transition Zone is also in transition from a rural, traditional agrarian culture to a society confronting the\ninformation age and modern technology. Camel caravans that once transported goods and materials across wide\nexpanses of desert terrain are being replaced with motor vehicles and aircraft. The many traditional groups across\nthis zone are adapting to the conditions of the modern world but work to retain their values and the traditions of\ntheir heritage.\nThe colonial political borders have impeded progress in the region\u2019s effort to establish stable governments and\ncontrol the land and resources within its borders. Postindependence governments have thus far been unable to\nestablish stable economic conditions within many of the countries in the Sahel. Natural resources are being\nexploited for economic profit, which is changing the natural environment. Security and safety have become\nsignificant issues. Today this region is unstable, with political and cultural conflicts between the local groups and\ngovernments. The current conflicts in Sudan are examples of the instability.\nSudan: Slavery and Genocide\nComparable in size to the entire United States east of the Mississippi River, Sudan is the largest country in\nAfrica. The capital city of Khartoum lies where the Blue Nile River converges with the White Nile. Khartoum\u2019s\ngovernment has a black Arab majority and follows Islam, complete with Sharia laws. The African Transition Zone\ncrosses Sudan and separates the Arab-Muslim north from the mainly African-Christian south. There has been\na civil war between the north and the south for decades. Before a peace agreement brokered in 2005, military\nsoldiers from the north would raid the villages in the south, taking women and children as slaves. Though the\nSudanese government denied the slave trade, thousands of Africans were owned by northern black Arabs in\nSudan, and many still are. The world community has made little effort to intervene. The price for a slave in Sudan\nis about fifty US dollars.\nThe differences in religion, ethnicity, and culture have always divided southern Sudan from the north. Additional 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 632\neconomic considerations might fuel the debate because of an increase in oil production in the region. In January\n2011, the southern region of Sudan voted on a referendum that would allow the south to break away and become\nan independent country called the Republic of South Sudan. The acceptance of this new republic will change the\nmap of the region and the dynamics between South Sudan and North Sudan. The new Republic of South Sudan\nwas formalized in July of 2011. Juba is designated as the capital with talk of creating a new forward capital in\nthe center of the newly formed country in the future. The many clans and indigenous groups make it difficult for\nunity and cohesiveness in the new country. Armed groups in the various states continue to cause internal division,\nwhile at the same time boundary disputes continue to be worked out with North Sudan.\nIn 2003, various groups in Darfur complained that the Khartoum government was neglecting them. A militia\ngroup calling itself the Janjaweed was recruited by the local Arabs to counter the resistance in Darfur. The\nJanjaweed began an ethnic cleansing campaign that pushed into the Darfur region, burning villages, raping\nwomen, and killing anyone who opposed them. Refugees began to flee into the neighboring country of Chad.\nFigure 8.22 Sudan, the Region of Darfur and the Republic of South Sudan 633 World Regional Geography\nSouth Sudan has elected to break away and become independent. The Darfur region has been experiencing genocide by Janjaweed\nmilitias backed by the Arab majority in northern Sudan.\nIn this particular case, the campaign was not based on religious divisions, because both sides were Muslim. This\nwas an ethnic conflict in that the people of Darfur are of a traditional African background and the people of\nnorthern Sudan consider themselves Arab, even though they may have dark skin. Accurate numbers have been\ndifficult to verify, but as of 2010 an estimated 300,000 people have died in this conflict. There are more than 2.7\nmillion refugees, many of them in Chad (BBC News). Just as the government of Sudan denied the slave trade,\nit denies that it supports the Janjaweed. The African Union provided a modest number of peacekeeping troops\nbefore the UN stepped in to provide security. It has been up to the world community and Sudan to take more\naction and provide more assistance. Food, water, and care for the refugees have taxed the region\u2019s aid and support\nsystem. 8.3 North Africa and the African Transition Zone 634\nThe African Union\nFormer Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi was instrumental in the development of the African Union (AU) in\nthe mid-1990s. The Sirte Declaration (titled after Gadhafi\u2019s hometown of Sirte in Libya) was issued by the\nOrganization of African Unity, which outlined the need for the creation of the AU. The AU was launched\nin Durban, South Africa, on July 9, 2002. Fifty-three countries formed this intergovernmental organization.\nThe focus of the AU is on the health, education, economic development, political stability, environmental\nsustainability, and general welfare of the people of Africa. The organization strives to integrate the socioeconomic\nand political stability of its members and promote a continent-wide effort for security and peace. The AU is\nworking to create a proper political climate, one that helps its member states engage in the global economic\nmarketplace by negotiating international issues and policies that affect Africa.\nThe dominating activities of colonialism and neocolonialism (corporate colonialism) are big concerns for the AU.\nThe AU\u2019s objective is to bring more unity to the political and economic arena between the African countries to\naddress the transition to a globalized world. It faces many challenges within its realm, including health care issues\nsuch as HIV\/AIDS and malaria that have devastated much of Africa. The AU is working to bring political stability\nto countries such as Sudan and other countries experiencing civil unrest because of political turmoil or civil war,\nsuch as the Congo, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, and Liberia. AU peacekeeping troops are assisting in\nthis process. The legal issues regarding border disputes or territorial disputes such as that of Western Sahara are\nproblems that the AU attempts to address.\nIn the global scale of economic and political supranationalism, the AU will be up against three main powerhouses:\nthe European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the East Asian Community. Regions across\nthe globe are working on trade associations to create economic networks to bring about greater cooperation and\ncommerce between nations. The AU is one part of that network that represents a growing percentage of the\nworld\u2019s population and the second-largest continent on Earth.\nGadhafi was the AU chairman when the uprisings and demonstrations of the Arab Spring began in January of\n2011, at which time his chairmanship ended. At the beginning of the civil war in Libya, the AU attempted to meet\nwith Gadhafi to mediate the situation. The NATO no-fly zone declaration and intervention restricted AU activities\nin Libya. After Gadhafi was no longer in power in Libya by the fall of 2011, the AU continued to not recognize\nthe NTC (National Transition Council) as the legitimate government of Libya.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Three main physical features of North Africa are the Atlas Mountains, the Sahara Desert, and the Nile River.\nMost of North Africa\u2019s population lives along the Mediterranean coast or along the Nile River. The ethnic\nmajority in the Maghreb are Berber, with Arabs dominating in Egypt.\n\u2022 The Maghreb centers on the Atlas Mountains, which traditionally has provided for a diversity of food\nproduction. Oil has been found in North Africa, the export of which has surpassed the export of food\nproducts.\n\u2022 Europe has had a strong influence on the region, ranging from the Roman Empire, to colonial activity, to\nbecoming a destination for immigrants looking for employment and opportunities. 635 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 North Africa has experienced serious political conflicts. Political leaders in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt\nremained in power for decades. People have protested for economic and political reforms. The presidents of\nEgypt and Tunisia have stepped down, but Libya\u2019s longtime leader, Muammar Gadhafi, did not step down\nbut instead engaged the country in a civil war.\n\u2022 The African Transition Zone creates the southern boundary for North Africa. This zone serves as the\ntransition between the arid type B climates and the tropical type A climates. It is also the transition between\nthe dominance of Islam and the dominance of Christianity and animism.\n\u2022 The African Transition Zone cuts through the center of Sudan and divides the country along religious and\nethnic distinctions. Civil war has been waged in the south and in the Darfur region, which has split the\ncountry into separate regions. Southern Sudan has initiated the process for independence.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What is the name of the majority ethnic group that resides in the Maghreb?

Summarize how the region of Palestine has evolved into the current Jewish State of Israel. Identify and\nlocate the territories that have been annexed to Israel over the years.\n2. Understand the division between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the Jewish State of Israel. Outline\nthe complications of the one-state and two-state solutions to this division.\n3. Describe the differences between the governments of Jordan and Syria.\n4. Outline the political arrangements of the government leadership positions in Lebanon.\nThe State of Israel\nAt the center of the Middle East, on the shores of the Mediterranean in the Levant (the area bordering the eastern\nMediterranean Sea), lies the country of Israel. Israel is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria and Jordan to\nthe east, and Egypt to the south. Covering an area of only 8,522 square miles, Israel is smaller than the US state\nof Massachusetts and only one-fifth the size of the state of Kentucky. The coastal region, which has a moderate\ntype C climate, receives more rainfall than the dry interior and the Negev Desert in the south, both of which have\narid type B climates. The Sea of Galilee, also called Lake Kinneret or the Sea of Tiberias, is a major fresh water\nsupply. The Jordan River flows from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is 1,300 feet below sea\nlevel, so it has no outlet. Over time, salts and minerals have built up, creating an environment that does not support\nfish or aquatic life. South of the Negev Desert is the Gulf of Aqaba, which provides access to the Red Sea for\nboth Israel and Jordan. Israel does not have substantial oil resources but has a potential for natural gas in offshore\nlocations along the Mediterranean Sea.\nThough most of the population in the Middle East is Islamic, there are exceptions, such as in Israel, which has\na Jewish majority. Israel was established in 1948. Before that time, the country was called Palestine. The region\nwent through a series of tumultuous transitions before it became the nation of Israel. Before 1948, most people\n637 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 638\nin Palestine were called Palestinians and consisted primarily of Arab Muslims, Samaritans, Bedouins, and Jews.\nMost Jewish people were dispersed throughout the world, with the majority in Europe and the United States.\nThe Division of Palestine\nPalestine was a part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire before the end of World War I. Britain defeated Turkish\nforces in 1917 and occupied Palestine for the remainder of the war. The British government was granted control of\nPalestine by the mandate of the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 at the end of World War I. Britain supported\nthe Balfour Declaration of 1917, which favored a Jewish homeland. The British Mandate included Palestine and\nTransjordan, the area east of the Jordan River, which includes the current country of Jordan.\nBetween 1922 and 1947, during British control, most of the population of Palestine was ethnically Arab and\nfollowed Islam. In 1922, Jews made up less than 20 percent of the population. The Jewish settlements were mainly\nalong the west coast and in the north. Jewish people from other countries\u2014including primarily Jews escaping\nGerman oppression in the 1930s\u2014migrated to the Israeli settlements. Palestine was turned over to the control of\nthe newly created United Nations (UN) in 1945 at the end of World War II.\nThe United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created by the UN in 1947. To address the\nPalestine region, UNSCOP recommended that Palestine be divided into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and an\ninternational territory that included Jerusalem. Palestine was divided by the UN. About 44 percent of the territory\nwas allocated to the Palestinians, who consisted of about 67 percent of the population, which was mainly Arab.\nApproximately 56 percent of the territory was allocated to the minority Jewish population, who only consisted\nof about 33 percent of the population. The country of Jordan was created out of the region east of the Jordan\nRiver and the Dead Sea. The city of Jerusalem was to remain under the administrative control of the UN as\nan international city. The Jewish State of Israel was officially recognized in 1948. The Palestinians, who were\na majority of Israel\u2019s total population at the time and who owned about 90 percent of the land, denounced\nthe agreement as unacceptable (Knowledgerush). One of the consequences of the territorial partition was that\nthousands of Palestinian Arabs were forced off the land that was allocated to the Jewish state. These Palestinians\nbecame refugees in the Palestinian portion or in neighboring countries.\nPalestine\u2019s Arab neighbors\u2014Syria, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iraq, and Egypt\u2014sided with the Arab Palestinians\nand declared war on Israel. The war did not end favorably for the Arabs. With support and aid from Britain and\nthe United States, the Jewish State of Israel defeated the attacking Arab armies and took control of a larger portion\nof the land, including some of the land designated by the UN as a portion of the Arab half. 639 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.23 Satellite Image of Palestine (left); 1948 UN Division of Palestine into Half Jewish State and Half Arab State\n(center); Political Map of Israel in 2011(right)\nWikimedia Commons public domain; Wikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain; CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nAfter the Arabs lost the first war against the Jewish State of Israel, the Palestinians\u2019 problems increased. By 1950\nover 750,000 Palestinians living in the Jewish-controlled regions of Israel were forced out of their homes and\ninto refugee camps. According to the UN in 2010, about one-third of the registered Palestine refugees, more than\n1.4 million, live in fifty-eight recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gaza\nStrip, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Jordan has the highest number of Palestinian refugees: almost\ntwo million, with more than 330,000 living in refugee camps (United Nations Relief \u201cPalestine Refugees\u201d; United\nNations Relief \u201cStatistics\u201d). Jordan has allowed most of its Palestinian refugees to receive Jordanian citizenship.\nBy 1967, the Arab armies had regrouped and were willing to attack Israel again. The 1967 war was short lived,\nlasting only about a week. The Arab armies were devastated once again, and Israel gained even more territory.\nIsrael took the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank\nfrom Jordan. The entire city of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. The 1967 war solidified the control of the\nregion of Palestine under the Israeli government and placed Israel at greater odds with its Arab neighbors. Syria\nwanted Israel to return the Golan Heights, which has a strategic military advantage in overlooking northern Israel,\nand Egypt wanted Israel to return control of the Sinai Peninsula.\nEgypt and Syria attacked Israel again on October 6, 1973, which was Yom Kippur, the most solemn holiday in\nthe Jewish religion. The Israeli army counterattacked, driving the Syrians out and the Egyptian army and back\nacross the Suez Canal. After a few weeks of conflict, a peace treaty was agreed upon. In 1977, Israeli president\nMenachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat were invited to Camp David, Maryland, by US president\nJimmy Carter. Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David Accord, an agreement not to go to war again. Egypt\nagreed to officially recognize the State of Israel and to not invade Israel again. Israel agreed to return the Sinai\nPeninsula to Egypt; the peninsula was returned in 1982. Each participant in the accord won the Nobel Peace Prize. 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 640\nFigure 8.24 The Western Wall in Jerusalem\nA remnant of the Jewish temple built by Herod the Great and destroyed in 70 CE, the Western Wall is the most holy place for the\nJewish people.

Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nIn 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law, which stated that greater Jerusalem was Israeli territory and that\nJerusalem was the eternal capital of the State of Israel. The UN rejected Israel\u2019s claim on greater Jerusalem, and\nfew if any countries have accepted it. Israel moved its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to solidify its claim on\nthe city even though most of the world\u2019s embassies remain in Tel Aviv. The move of the capital was designed\nto create a forward capital, the purpose of which is usually either to protect a nation\u2019s territory or to spur the\ndevelopment of the country. In this case, it was to protect valuable territory.\nPalestinians were left with only the regions of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which is controlled by the Israeli\ngovernment and is subject to Israel\u2019s national jurisdiction. As of 2010, about 1.5 million Palestinians live in the\nGaza Strip and 2.5 million live in the West Bank. A number of cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been\nturned over to the Palestinian Authority (PA) for self-governing. The PA was established between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the Israeli government to administer internal security and civil matters.\nThe PLO and the PA are two separate entities. The PLO is the internationally recognized governing body of the\nPalestinian people. It is legitimately recognized by the UN to represent the area known as Palestine in political 641 World Regional Geography\nmatters. There are two main political parties within the PLO: Hamas and Fatah. The Hamas party is the strongest\nin the region of the Gaza Strip, and the Fatah party is more prominent in the West Bank.\nThe Palestinians, Israel, and Possible Solutions\nThe future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has been the focus of talks and negotiation for decades. There\nare various ways to approach this issue; a one-state solution and a two-state solution have been proposed. The\none-state solution proposes the creation of a fully democratic state of Israel and the integration of all the people\nwithin its borders into one country. Integration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into the Jewish State of\nIsrael is part of this plan; in other words, \u201cTake the walls down and create one state\u201d (Masri, M., 2011). Many\nPalestinians support the one-state solution, but most of the Jewish population does not. Family size is much larger\nin the Palestinian side, so it would be only a matter of time before the Jewish population would be a minority\npopulation and would not have full political control with a democratic government. To have the Jewish State of\nIsrael, the Jewish population needs to keep its status as the majority.\nIn a two-state solution, Palestinians would have their own nation-state, which would include the Gaza Strip and\nthe West Bank. The rest of former Palestine would be included in the Jewish State of Israel. The two-nation\nconcept (Israel and a Palestinian state) has been proposed and supported by a number of foreign governments,\nincluding the United States. Implementation of a two-state solution is, of course, not without its own inherent\nproblems. At the present time, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are subjects under the Jewish State of\nIsrael without full political or economic autonomy. The two-state solution would buy more time for the Jewish\npopulation with smaller families to retain power as a majority political voting bloc.\nParties to the negotiations have acknowledged that the most likely solution is to create a Palestinian state\nbordering Israel. However, it is not clear how to make this happen. Palestine is now divided between the Jewish\nState of Israel (with 7.3 million people) on one side and the Palestinians (with 4.0 million people) in the West Bank\nand the Gaza Strip on the other side. About 75 percent of Israel\u2019s population of 7.3 million people are Jewish,\nand about 25 percent are Arab. Travel between Israel and the Palestinian areas is heavily restricted and tightly\ncontrolled. A high concrete and barbed wire barrier separates the two sides for much of the border. The West Bank\nprovides fresh water used on the Israeli side for agriculture and industrial processes. The industries also employ\nPalestinians and support them economically.\nJewish people from various parts of the world continue to migrate to Israel, and the Israeli government continues\nto build housing settlements to accommodate them. Since the West Bank region is under the Israeli national 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 642\njurisdiction, many of the new housing settlements have been built in the West Bank. The Palestinians who live\nthere strongly oppose the settlements. In 1977, only about five thousand Jews lived in the West Bank settlements.\nAs of 2010 there were more than two hundred thousand. The Palestinians argue that if they were to have their\nown nation-state, then the Jewish settlements would be in their country and would have to be either resettled or\nabsorbed. Israel responds by indicating that the two-state solution is indefensible because the Jewish settlements\nin the West Bank cannot be protected if the West Bank is separated from Israel.\nThe issues in Israel are generally complicated. After a series of wars and considerable negotiations, the central\nproblems remain: Jews and Palestinians both want the same land, both groups want Jerusalem to be their capital\ncity, and neither group can find a compromise. Support for the Jewish State of Israel has primarily come from the\nUnited States and from Jewish groups external to Israel. There are more Jews in the United States than there are\nin Israel, and the US Jewish lobby is powerful. Israel has been the top recipient of US foreign aid for most of the\nyears since 1948. Through charitable donations, US groups provide Israel additional billions of dollars annually.\nForeign aid has given the Jewish population in Israel a standard of living that is higher than the standard of living\nof many European countries.\nIn the past decade, most of the PLO\u2019s operating budget has come from external sources. Arab neighbors provide\nmillions of dollars annually. Though Iran is not Arab, they have provided aid to the Palestinian cause in support of\nfellow Muslims against the Jewish State of Israel. The PLO has received the bulk of its funding from the European\nUnion. Russia has also provided millions of dollars in aid. The United States provides millions in direct or indirect\naid to the Palestinians annually.\nThe Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth, and it is located in a desert. There are few\njobs and no real methods of gaining wealth. Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank need to rely\non outside support to survive. These are small areas with lots of people. The West Bank is only about thirty miles\nwide by seventy-five miles long, yet more than 2.5 million people call it home. The Gaza Strip is a desert region\nabout six miles wide by twenty-three miles long and is home to more than 1.5 million people. In 2010, family size\nin the West Bank was about 3.2, and in the Gaza Strip, it was about 5.0. Unemployment rates averaged about 40\npercent in the Gaza Strip and over 20 percent in the West Bank (Central Intelligence Agency). Underemployment\nis also a major issue in that there may be few employment opportunities for professionals with specialized skills\nor a university degree in a specific field of interest.\nFigure 8.25 A Street in the West Bank City of Nablus 643 World Regional Geography\nCell phones are ubiquitous in Nablus.\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nIn 2006, both Israel and the PLO held democratic elections for their leaders. In 2006, a candidate from the Hamas\nparty won the election for the leadership of the PLO, which concerned many of the PLO\u2019s external financial\nsupporters. The Israeli government characterizes Hamas as a terrorist organization that supports the destruction of\nthe State of Israel. Hamas has advocated for suicide bombers to blow themselves up on populated Jewish streets.\nThe Jewish State of Israel has been fighting a low-level war against Palestinian resistance groups such as Hamas\nsince 1948. In 2008, the leaders of the Fatah party, which are more prominent in the West Bank region, took\nmatters to the PLO Central Council, which chose Mahmoud Abbas as president of the State of Palestine.\nFigure 8.26 Security Wall between Israel and the West Bank 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 644\nPhoto by R. Berglee \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA.\nThe problems between Israel and Palestinians are far from settled. The region has plenty of interconnected\nconcerns. The biggest supporter of Israel, the United States, invaded Iraq in 2003, an invasion that raised the\nconcern level of Islamic groups in the Middle East, including the Islamic leaders that control the government\nof Iran. Israel has nuclear weapons, and Iran has worked at developing nuclear weapons. US involvement in\nthe region has heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. Oil revenues are driving the economies of most of\nthe Arab countries that support the Palestinians. Oil is an important export of the region, with the United States\nas a major market. The difficulties between Israel and the Palestinians continue to fuel the conflict between\nIslamic fundamentalists and Islamic reformers. Some Islamic groups have accepted Israel\u2019s status as a country\nand others have not. The Israel-Palestinian problem drives the geopolitics of the Middle East. The US war in Iraq\nhas complicated the situation but has not superseded it. The situation in Palestine is predicted to continue long\nafter the problems in Iraq have stabilized.\nFigure 8.27 West Bank Settlements and Palestinian-Controlled Areas 645 World Regional Geography 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 646\nUpdated from map courtesy of CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nJordan\nNorth of the Arabian Peninsula are three Arab states that surround Israel: Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Each\ncountry possesses its own unique physical and cultural geography. The country of Jordan was created through the\nBritish Mandate after World War I, when Britain defeated the Turks in Palestine. The area east of the Jordan River\nbecame the modern country of Jordan in 1946. From 1953 to 1999, during the most volatile period of the region,\nthe country was ruled by a pragmatic leader, King Hussein, who was able to skillfully negotiate his way through\nthe difficult relationship with Israel and yet keep his country stable. When Palestine was divided by the UN to\ncreate the State of Israel, the region of Jordan received more than a million Palestinian refugees from the West\nBank and Israel. Refugees make up a large portion of the more than six million people who live in Jordan today;\nabout a half million refugees from the US war in Iraq are included in that total.\nJordan is not large in physical area. Natural resources such as oil and water are not abundant here, and the country\noften has to rely on international aid to support its economy. Inflation, poverty, and unemployment are basic\nissues. The government of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy. King Hussein\u2019s son \u2018Abdullah II took power after\nthe king\u2019s death in 1999. Economic reforms were implemented by King \u2018Abdullah II to improve the long-term\noutlook of the country and raise the standard of living for his citizens. The king allowed municipal elections to\nbe conducted, which allowed for 20 percent of the positions to be dedicated to women candidates. Parliamentary\nelections were held by a democratic vote.\nFigure 8.28 King \u2018Abdullah II of Jordan Visits US President Barack Obama in the White House in 2011 647 World Regional Geography\nJordan has had good political relations with the United States. King \u2018Abdullah II has worked to maintain a stable government in\nJordan and maintain civil stability in spite of Jordan\u2019s lack of economic opportunities.\nPhoto courtesy of the White House \u2013 public domain.\nFigure 8.29 Jordan 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 648\nMap courtesy of CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nJordan has demonstrated how a country with few natural resources in a volatile region of the world can proceed\ndown a progressive path despite difficult circumstances. Jordan has developed a positive trade relationship with\nEurope and the United States while at the same time working with its Arab neighbors to access oil and to maintain\na civil state of affairs. Jordan is not without its challenges but has managed to confront each issue yet retain a\nsense of stability and nationalism. 649 World Regional Geography\nSyria\nThe strategically located country of Syria is at the center of the Middle East\u2019s geopolitical issues. Syria gained\nits independence from the French Mandate in 1946, the same year as Jordan. Syria has strived to work out and\nstabilize its political foundation. In a move to create greater Arab unity in the realm, Egypt and Syria joined\nforces and created the United Arab Republic in 1958. This geopolitical arrangement lasted until 1961, when the\npartnership was dissolved. Syria returned to its own republic. The Arab Socialist Baath Party gained strength, and\nin 1970 Hafiz al-Assad, of the Alawite minority (an offshoot branch of Shia Islam making up about 10 percent\nof the Syrian population), took over leadership in a coup that stabilized the political scene. It was during this era\nthat the Golan Heights was lost to Israel in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. This strategic geographical location is a\npoint of contention in the peace negotiations between Syria and Israel.\nHafiz al-Assad served as the leader of Syria for twenty-nine years without having been democratically elected to\nthe office by the people. His son Bashar took the reins of leadership after Hafiz died in 2000. The Alawite sect\nheld power in Syria through the Assad family under military control. Syria has been accused of using its military\npower to influence conditions in Lebanon, where it brokered a peace deal in its civil war (1975\u20131990). Syria has\nalso been accused of supporting the anti-Israel groups headquartered in Lebanon.\nSyria is located in an ancient land with a long history of empires and peoples. The region of Syria was once part\nof the cradle of civilization that sprung up in Mesopotamia. Damascus claims to have been continually inhabited\nlonger than any other capital city on Earth. The largest city and the center of industrial activity is Aleppo, which\nlies in the north of Syria. Syria\u2019s physical area is slightly larger than the US state of North Dakota. Overall,\nSyria\u2019s climate is characterized as an arid type B climate; some regions receive more rain than others. The western\nregion, because it borders the Mediterranean Sea, is an area that receives more rainfall. The additional rainfall\ntranslates into extensive agricultural production. The northeast area of Syria is also productive agriculturally\nthrough water resources provided where the Euphrates River cuts through the country. Oil and natural gas have\nbeen the country\u2019s main export products. The petroleum reserves are being depleted, and few new fields are\nbeing developed. Eventually, the wealth generated by the sale of petroleum reserves, which are finite resources, is\nprojected to diminish, even as the population continues to increase.\nThe Syrian government has exerted strict control over the economy. The country will face serious economic\nissues in the future. There is a high rate of unemployment. Because oil production has not been increasing, the\ngovernment has been forced to take on additional national debt. The arid climate and the need to supplement\nagriculture production have placed additional pressure on precious fresh water supplies. The Euphrates River\nprovides fresh water, but it originates in Turkey, where large dams restrict the flow. Water rights for the region are\ntherefore an issue. One third of Syria\u2019s population is under the age of fifteen, which indicates a rapid population\ngrowth pattern that will tax future resources at an increasing rate. In 2010, Syria had about twenty-two million\npeople. The country holds political significance; its strategic location between Iraq and Israel makes it is a vital\nplayer in any solution for lasting peace in the Middle East. 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 650\nFigure 8.30 Female Protesters in Douma, a Suburb of Damascus, in 2011\nSyriana2011 \u2013 Syria Damascus Douma Protests 2011 \u2013 05 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nFigure 8.31 Syria 651 World Regional Geography\nMap courtesy of CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nSyria has experienced protests and demonstrations similar to those that swept through North Africa in the Arab\nSpring of 2011. Citizens expressed dissatisfaction with the government because of the lack of democratic reforms,\nhigh unemployment, and the loss of civil rights, which had been taken away when the government declared a\nstate of emergency in 1963. Student protests escalated to massive citizen demonstrations that emerged in various\nSyrian cities in the spring of 2011. The government cracked down on protesters, killing some. After extensive\ndemonstrations on March 15, the government arrested more than three thousand people. Hundreds have been\nkilled in violent clashes between the people and government security forces.\nThe lack of democratic processes by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government has continued to prompt protests\nand demonstrations in Syria. The US government eventually placed sanctions against Assad and a number of\nhigh-level Syrian officials. A new cabinet was installed in Syria, and the decades-old state of emergency was\nrescinded. Unrest and protests by the people continue, and the government responds by cracking down on them\nwith harsher methods. Syria\u2019s neighbors and various European nations have increased sanctions and denounced\nthe Assad regime, which has increased the pressure on Syria. 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 652\nThe uprising in Syria that started as a part of the wave of the Arab Spring continues. The Arab Spring protests and\ndemonstrations in Syria have often been compared to those in Libya. Both Syria and Libya have had long-time\nleaders that ruled for decades without democratic reforms or wide-spread personal freedoms for their citizens. The\ndifference is that in Syria the Assad regime has held total control over a large military and comprehensive control\nover political and economic activities. This is unlike Libya under Muammar Gadhafi, whose modest military\nforces included hired mercenaries from other countries and the government had a fragmented or weak political\nstructure. Speculation regarding changes in the government and the future of Syria is more difficult.\nLebanon\nPhoenicians created an empire along the Mediterranean coast of present-day Lebanon four thousand years ago,\nand many armies fought over the strategically located region. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the area\nbecame a European protectorate under the French Mandate. Independence was granted by the French in 1943.\nLebanon is smaller than the US state of Connecticut with a population of about four million. The country\u2019s high\ncentral mountain chain, the Lebanon Mountains, reaches as much as ten thousand feet in elevation. At these\nelevations, precipitation turns to snow and allows the operation of ski resorts. To the east of the central range is\nthe fertile Bekaa Valley, which plays a vital role in the country\u2019s agriculture. On the eastern side of the Bekaa\nValley is another shorter mountain range that borders Syria.\nFigure 8.32 Lebanon (left); Majority Religious Factions in 2006 (right) 653 World Regional Geography\nMaps courtesy of CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nFollowing World War II, Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, became known as the \u201cParis of the Middle East,\u201d\ncomplete with Western-style night clubs and a jet-setting business class. In the past, of Lebanon was called the\n\u201cSwitzerland of the Middle East\u201d because of its capabilities in banking and finance, which were supported by a\nrelatively stable political climate. Unfortunately, stable and progressive conditions were not enough to keep the\ncountry from escalating into division and civil war in the 1970s.\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, internal tensions were building between the many religious and cultural\nfactions competing for power in Lebanon. By the early 1970s, the minority Christian government clashed with\na majority Muslim population. Many factions entered the arena on both the Christian and Muslim sides. On the\nChristian side are Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant factions. The Islamic side includes the Sunni, the Shia, and\nthe Druze, a semi-Islamic offshoot group that incorporates Gnostic or neo-Platonic philosophies.\nLebanon was experiencing a full-scale civil war by 1975 that continued until 1990, when the Syrian military\nbrokered a peace deal. By the time it ended, the bitter civil war had destroyed the infrastructure of the country.\nOnly one-third of Beirut\u2019s population remained. The former thriving city had been reduced to a collection of\nbullet-ridden empty buildings. It took more than a decade, but through the resiliency of the people, Beirut\nrebounded and continues to recover. A massive rebuilding program has resurrected the city of Beirut and\nstimulated the economy.\nStill, conflicts linger, and discord between Israel and Syria has violent results. Israel has taken military action\nagainst anti-Israel factions within Lebanon on a number of occasions. In 1982, Israel attacked PLO strongholds,\nwhich were operating out of Lebanon in the Bekaa Valley and West Beirut. In 1993, Israel conducted air raids\nand military strikes against guerilla bases in Southern Lebanon. Anti-Israel groups such as Hezbollah operate out\nof Lebanon and receive aid from other Arab states, a source of contention that has prompted Israel to confront\nHezbollah on Lebanon\u2019s territory. As a result, Lebanon has become a battleground on which factions try to\nwork out their differences. Syria\u2019s continual intervention in Lebanon has sometimes been unappreciated; in 2004,\nmassive demonstrations advocated for the removal of all Syrian troops. Syria withdrew its forces in 2005.\nThere is no dominant majority political party in Lebanon to coalesce power. Lebanon consequently developed 8.4 Israel and Its Neighbors 654\na unique parliamentary democratic system to relieve some of the tension between the various cultural-political\nfactions. In this system, a number of positions in government are reserved for specific religious\/political parties.\nThe deputy prime minister position, for example, is reserved for an Orthodox Christian; the prime minister is a\nSunni Muslim; the speaker of the parliament is a Shia Muslim; and the president can only be a Maronite Catholic\nChristian.\nLebanon\u2019s cultural and religious factions within its small state clash with political fervor and conviction, at times\ncreating chaotic conditions that interrupt economic growth and discourage international investments. Add the\ndynamic cultural conditions to Lebanon\u2019s attractive physical features\u2014the beautiful Mediterranean coast, the\nattractive interior mountains, and the cosmopolitan city of Beirut\u2014and it is easy to see why Lebanon is such a\nfascinating geographic study. Lebanon holds a unique location and position in the Middle East that will remain a\nfocus of interest to the rest of the world.\nFigure 8.33 Beirut, Lebanon 655 World Regional Geography\nLocated in the middle of an upscale neighborhood in Beirut, this food shop is in a building that has not been fully repaired from\ndamage resulting from the 1975 civil war.

Before this time, the region was called Palestine\nand the people who lived there were called Palestinians.\n\u2022 Victorious in war against their Arab neighbors, Israel acquired the Golan Heights, the West Bank, the Gaza\nStrip, and the city of Jerusalem. The West Bank and the Gaza Strip are considered Palestinian territory. Two\nplans have been proposed to address the division but have not been agreed upon.\n\u2022 Jordan is a constitutional monarchy led by King \u2018Abdullah II, who has worked to implement reforms to\nmaintain a country that has few natural resources.\n\u2022 The government of Syria is led by Bashar al-Assad, a member of a minority ethnic group called the\nAlawites. Assad and his father have ruled Syria for more than forty years under a state of emergency.\nMassive protests and demonstrations against the government have resulted in hundreds of deaths and\nthousands imprisoned.\n\u2022 Lebanon is a diverse country with a large number of religious groups that dominate the cultural and political\nscene. The physical geography includes the Lebanon Mountains, the Bekaa Valley, and the Mediterranean\ncoast.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. How did the UN divide Palestine?

Summarize the physical features of the Arabian Peninsula.\n2. Understand the main economic activities of each country.\n3. Describe the types of governments found in the region.\n4. Outline women\u2019s rights and circumstances in each country in the region.\nStates of the Arabian Peninsula\nThe Arabian Peninsula is a desert environment surrounded by saltwater bodies. The Persian Gulf, the Arabian\nSea, and the Red Sea border the peninsula on three sides. Arid type B climates dominate the region. Saudi Arabia\nonly receives an average of four inches of precipitation per year. The southern portions of the peninsula are some\nof hottest places on Earth. Summer temperatures can reach more than 120 \u00baF. In the south is the Rub\u2019 al-Khali\n(Empty Quarter), which is mainly desert and comprises about 25 percent of Saudi Arabia. It is extremely dry\nand virtually uninhabited, though oil discoveries have brought temporary settlements to the region. There are no\nnatural lakes or major rivers on the peninsula. Agricultural activity is dependent on the availability of water by\nrainfall, underground aquifers, oases, or desalinization of seawater.\n657 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 658\nFigure 8.34 Satellite Image from 2008 of the Arabian Peninsula Illustrating the Mountainous Regions, the Uninhabited\nEmpty Quarter Desert Region, and the Surrounding Bodies of Water\nSatellite image courtesy of NASA\u2019s Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor project and John Nevard \u2013 public domain.\nMost of the people living on the peninsula are Arabs, and most of the peninsula\u2019s countries are ruled by monarchs\nwho rely on oil revenues to gain wealth. Minerals are mined in the mountains that dominate the peninsula\u2019s\nwestern and southern regions. The highest peaks reach more than twelve thousand feet in elevation in northern\nYemen. Of the countries on the peninsula, Yemen has the fewest oil resources and has had the sole democratically\nelected government. Saudi Arabia dominates the region in size and in oil resources. Islam, the major religion,\ninfiltrates all aspects of Arab culture. 659 World Regional Geography\nSaudi Arabia\nFigure 8.35 Political Map of the Arabian Peninsula\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe holy cities of Medina and Mecca are in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam. Islam first united the many\ntraditional groups of Arabia with religion and then with the Arabic language. The region was further united after\n1902, when Abdul Aziz Al-Sa\u2018ud and his followers captured the city of Riyadh and brought it under the control of\nthe House of Sa\u2018ud. In 1933, the lands under the control of the king were renamed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy. In 1938, US oil corporation Chevron found large quantities of oil in the 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 660\nregion, which has sustained the royal family ever since. Aramco is the state-run oil corporation. Controlling about\none-fifth of the world\u2019s known oil reserves, the Saudi royal family claims considerable power.\nThe Saudi royal family gave safe haven to thousands of Kuwaitis, including the emir and his family, during the\nFirst Persian Gulf War (1991). Saudi Arabia allowed US and Western military forces to use bases on its soil during\nOperation Desert Storm. Acquiescence to non-Muslims operating military bases on the same soil as the holy\ncities of Mecca and Medina gave extremist groups a reason to engage in terrorist activities. Out of the nineteen\nhijackers in the 9-11 attack in New York, sixteen were from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government has been forced\nto step up its efforts against terrorism and domestic extremist groups.\nThe entire economy of Saudi Arabia is based on the export of oil, and more than 20 percent of the known oil\nreserves in the world are located in Saudi Arabia. The country is a key member of the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) and has been the world\u2019s number one oil exporter. Millions of foreign workers in the\npetroleum industry make up a vital component of the country\u2019s economy.\nA high rate of population growth has been outstripping economic growth in Saudi Arabia. In 2010, more than\none-third of the population was younger than fifteen years old, and family size was about 3.8 children. The\nunemployment rate is high, and there is a shortage of job skills in the workforce. The government has been\nworking to shift its focus away from a petroleum-based economy and increase other economic opportunities; it\nplans to heavily invest in the necessary infrastructure and education to diversify its economy.\nSaudi Arabia has made several efforts to move forward and put the country more in line with globalization efforts\nthat are modernizing the other Persian Gulf States. The World Trade Organization accepted Saudi Arabia as\na member in 2005. In 2008, the king implemented the initiative for interfaith dialogue in an effort to address\nreligious tolerance and acceptance. The first woman was appointed to the cabinet, and municipal councils held\nelections for its members.\nFigure 8.36 Modern Infrastructure Illustrated on Medina Road in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia 661 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nSaudi Culture\nThe royal family and most of the people in Saudi Arabia are Sunni Muslims. The country has a strong\nfundamentalist Islamic tendency. The law of the state is strict and supports conservative Islamic ideals. The\nWahhabi branch of Sunni Islam has a major influence on culture. Activities such as gambling, alcohol\nconsumption, and the promotion of other religions are outlawed. Alcohol and pork products are forbidden in\naccordance with Islamic dietary laws. Movie theaters and other Western-style productions are prohibited but can\nbe found in areas where workers from other countries live in private compounds. Though movie theaters are\nrestricted, movies on DVDs are not prohibited and are widely available. The dress code in Saudi Arabia strictly\nfollows the Islamic principles of modesty. The black abaya (an article of clothing that looks like a cloak or robe)\nor modest clothing is appropriate for women. Men often wear the traditional full-length shirt and a headcloth held\nin place by a cord.\nIn Saudi Arabia, human rights organizations, legal associations, trade unions, and political parties are banned. The\ncountry maintains a tight censorship of all local media. The press is only allowed to publish what the government\npermits it to report. Communication with foreigners, satellite media, and Internet access are highly controlled.\nThose who speak out against the government can be arrested or imprisoned. 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 662\nFigure 8.37 Women in Saudi Arabia\nFormer First Lady Laura Bush meets medical staff in Saudi Arabia. Note the women\u2019s attire.\nPhoto courtesy of the White House \u2013 public domain.\nThe Sharia is the basic criminal code in Saudi Arabia, along with whatever law is established by the king.\nA wide range of corporal and capital punishments\u2014from long prison sentences to amputations (arm or foot),\nfloggings, and beheadings\u2014are proscribed for legal or religious offenses. Trials are most often held in secret\nwithout lawyers. Torture has been used to force confessions that are then used to convict the accused. Torture\ntechniques\u2014including the use of sticks, electric shocks, or flogging\u2014can be applied to children and women as\nwell as men. Executions are usually held in a public place every Friday.\nRole of Women\nMen hold the dominant roles in Saudi society. Under strict Islamic law, women do not have the same rights as 663 World Regional Geography\nmen, so Saudi women do not have the opportunities that women in many Western countries have. For example, it\nis not customary for a woman to walk alone in public; traditionally, she must be accompanied by a family member\nso as to not be accused of moral offences or prostitution. The mutawa\u2019een (religious police) have the authority to\narrest people for such actions. The punishment could be as many as to twenty-five days in prison and a flogging\nof as many as sixty lashes.\nAs of 2011, the following restrictions have been made on women:\n\u2022 Women are not allowed to drive motor vehicles.\n\u2022 Women must wear modest clothing such as the black abaya and cover their hair.\n\u2022 Women can only choose certain college degrees. They cannot be engineers or lawyers, for example.\n\u2022 Women cannot vote in political elections.\n\u2022 Women cannot walk in a public spaces or travel without a male relative.\n\u2022 Women are segregated from men in the workplace and in many formal spaces, even in homes.\n\u2022 Women need written permission from a husband or father to travel abroad.\n\u2022 Marriages can be arranged without the woman\u2019s consent, and women often lose everything in a\ndivorce.\nSaudi Arabia is a country steeped in tradition based on the heritage of its people, and many of the traditions\nregarding women were implemented to protect and care for them. However, as the forces of globalization seep into\nthe fabric of society, many of these traditions are evolving and changing to adapt to the times and to a more open\nsociety. Women are asserting themselves in the culture, and many of these long-standing traditions are starting to\nbreak down. In late 2011, there were a number of women who organized to defy the ban on driving. One woman\nwas arrested for driving a car and sentenced to ten lashes. Saudi King Abdullah then overturned the sentence and\npromised to support or protect women\u2019s rights. There is no law stating that women cannot drive a vehicle. The\ntaboo is based on tradition and religious views. More women have taken to the roadways in spite of the taboo\nagainst it (Huffington Post). Saudi Arabia is an example of how Islamic fundamentalism is being challenged by\nmodernity and democratic principles. 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 664\nKuwait\nKuwait, a small country located on the Persian Gulf, is a monarchy ruled by an emir from the royal family.\nImmense oil reserves have made Kuwait attractive to international oil investors. In 1961, Zapata Oil Company\n(now Pennzoil), owned by former US president George H. W. Bush, drilled the first offshore Kuwaiti oil well\nin the Persian Gulf. Thanks to ample oil revenues, the small Kuwaiti population (about three million people) has\nadequate social services. The country has a high standard of living. Education is free, and much of the labor base\ncomes from non-Kuwaiti migrants. Petroleum exports account for most of the government\u2019s income.\nKuwait has an excellent port at Kuwait City. However, one of the environmental problems with building a large\ncity in the desert is the shortage of fresh water. To solve this problem, Kuwait has turned to the desalinization of\nseawater to provide for its domestic, agricultural, and industrial needs.\nThe United States and an international coalition fought the First Persian Gulf War in 1991 to \u201cliberate\u201d Kuwait\nfrom the grip of Saddam Hussein. It is compelling to note that the war was not about democracy. The war was\nabout the control of oil resources. Under Hussein, Iraq invaded Kuwait and took over its enormous oil industry\nand port facilities. By taking over the oil assets, Hussein was in actuality taking over the oil assets of various\ninternational oil corporations. With the support of United Nations (UN) resolutions demanding that Hussein leave\nKuwait, President George H. W. Bush organized an international military coalition to remove Hussein from\nKuwait. The US mission was called Operation Desert Storm. The war started on bases in Saudi Arabia and\npushed the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. When Hussein realized that he could not benefit from the oil in Kuwait,\nhe had approximately 750 oil wells in Kuwait dynamited, which caused serious well fires and large lakes of oil\nflowing out onto the desert sands. The fires and spilled oil caused extensive environmental damage.\nFigure 8.38 Desert Storm 665 World Regional Geography\nUS fighter jets in Operation Desert Storm fly over burning oil well fires in Kuwait. The fires were set by retreating Iraqi forces.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nKuwait was not a democracy during the Persian Gulf War and is not a true democracy today. It is considered\na constitutional emirate. The emir, or head of the royal family, is the head of state. He appoints the prime\nminister and has a high level of control over the government. The emir has the authority to dissolve the National\nAssembly, which has members that hold seats by election. A number of groups wish to have a political voice\nin the government, including Islamists, business merchants, secular liberals, Shia activists, and a small number\nof local groups. Islamist groups are usually those who support an Islamic religious state as the desired type of\ngovernment.\nKuwait had to invest nearly five billion dollars to reestablish the oil industry after the Persian Gulf War, but the\nemirate has recovered, and its economy is growing with the increased sale of exported oil. Kuwait has about 104\nbillion barrels of oil in known reserves. In 2010, the four largest export partners were Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,\nand Singapore, which are all economic powers in East Asia that have to import almost all of their energy and raw\nmaterials. The US has traditionally been Kuwait\u2019s number one source of imported goods. 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 666\nBahrain\nBahrain is a small archipelago (group of islands) in the Persian Gulf. The country received its independence\nfrom Great Britain in 1971. Iran has made claims on the islands to no avail. Similar to other small monarchies\nin the region, Bahrain has lots of oil and a small population. Though more than 50 percent of the population\nis Shia, the country is opening up to democratic reforms. In 1999, elections were approved for a parliament,\nall political prisoners were released, and women were allowed to vote. The royal family, ruled by the king, has\nhad an enormous degree of power over its government. Officially, Bahrain is a constitutional monarchy, but the\nking appoints the members of the upper house in its bicameral legislature. The first female was appointed to a\ncabinet position in 2004, which was an indication of the move toward openness to the globalization process and\nmodernization. Some in the country think the implementation of these measures is still too slow.\nFigure 8.39 Development in Bahrain\nThis Hardee\u2019s franchise in Bahrain is a clear example of Americanization of the\nArabian Peninsula.\nClaus Wolf \u2013 Fast Food in Dammam \u2013 CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.\nMost of Bahrain\u2019s wealth is gained through the extraction of natural resources. Enormous natural gas reserves\nare located in Bahrain\u2019s coastal waters, and oil now makes up about 60 percent of the export profits. The small\nland area size of the country, lack of sufficient supplies of fresh water, and few other natural resources has\nprompted a shift for Bahrain to expand into the financial sector. Islamic banking and financial services for the 667 World Regional Geography\nglobal marketplace have been an expanding sector of the economy. The objective in diversifying the economy is to\nreduce the dependency on oil as a future source of national wealth. In addition, the United States has entered into\na free-trade agreement with Bahrain, which has attracted multinational corporations to do business in the region.\nBahrain has been supportive of a US military presence for both protection and cooperation and is the permanent\nheadquarters for the US Fifth Fleet navel operations. In a mutual defense agreement, some one thousand American\nnavel officers and personnel are stationed on the island. Bahrain has been a frontline state for the US military in\nthe Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan.\nThe country is also opening up development in the service sectors. Tourism is not what usually comes to mind\nwhen one thinks about the Arabian Peninsula, but Bahrain has been attracting millions of visitors yearly. The\ncountry\u2019s authentic heritage is attractive to tourists from neighboring Arab states and the global community. The\ncountry boasts of nearly five thousand years of human activity. UNESCO has designated the Qal\u2019at al-Bahrain\ncastle as a World Heritage Site. The country has invested heavily in modern shopping malls and international\nsports facilities in an effort to modernize its country and attract more international events.\nThe citizens of Bahrain have had to work to balance the shift toward modernization and globalization with the\nstrong Arab heritage and Islamic beliefs that have been the foundation of their culture. The term Middle East Lite\nhas been applied to Bahrain because Bahrain has been investing in modern infrastructure but has worked hard to\nmaintain its Arab heritage with a Persian Gulf identity that is more accepting and open to the outside world. The\ngrowing and prosperous middle class is more tolerant and liberal than many of its Middle East neighbors.\nThe same level of tolerance toward outsiders has not been witnessed within the country. The 2011 protests and\ndemonstrations that swept across North Africa and the Middle East also occurred in Bahrain. The king, the royal\nfamily, and the majority in government follow the Sunni branch of Islam; however, most of the population follows\nthe Shia branch of Islam. Many within the Shia community felt that they were being discriminated against and\nprotested the lack of democratic reforms. Protests and demonstrations in Bahrain have prompted the government\nto call in military support from Saudi Arabia to help quell the uprising. A number of Shia mosques were reported\nto have been destroyed, and hundreds of people were detained by police. The protests and demonstrations in\nBahrain are more than just a conflict between Shia and Sunni, though this split has been a major concern for years.\nMany Sunni have participated in the demonstrations because they are in support of more democratic reforms as\nwell. 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 668\nQatar\nThe small peninsula jutting out from Arabia into the Persian Gulf is an Arab land in transition. Ruled by an\nemir who has supported democratic reforms, Qatar is moving forward with a globalization policy similar to other\nWesternized nations. Many of these reforms are similar to those in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nOil and gas exports have fueled a building boom that has produced shopping malls, wide boulevards, and even a\nlarge US military base. Women are allowed to vote, Western clothing and products are permitted, and rap music\ncan be heard in the streets. Though still politically restrictive in many ways, Qatar is more open than many of\nits neighbors. Qatar is also home to the Al Jazeera news organization, which often balances out Western news\nprogramming. Al Jazeera is also allowed to report critically on its home country.\nIn the past few years, oil revenues have provided Qatar with a rapidly growing economy and a high standard of\nliving. Proven reserves of oil and natural gas are enormous for such a small country. Qatar\u2019s natural gas reserves\nare the world\u2019s third largest. Qatar has been pursuing development of private and foreign investments in non-\nenergy-related businesses, including banking and financial institutions.\nFigure 8.40 Building Boom in Qatar City\nRevenues from oil and natural gas are fueling the rapid development of this\nsmall peninsula that is rivaling core economic countries.\nAmina Tagemouati \u2013 Doha Cityscape \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nModernization efforts have supported Qatar\u2019s push for a greater emphasis on education. Infrastructure and\nfinancial support have been allocated to support educational reform, and university opportunities are expanding\nrapidly. Qatar University was founded in 1973, and in the last decade many more universities from Western 669 World Regional Geography\ncountries have opened up branch campuses in Education City, which was established to advance Qatar\u2019s\neducational reform goals. The emir\u2019s second wife has actively promoted educational reforms and has encouraged\nwomen to pursue higher education to excel in their careers. She has also created greater visibility for women in\npublic roles and has broken through some of the cultural barriers and taboos that have restricted women in other\nconservative Islamic Arab countries.\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)\nSeven small Arab emirates joined together in 1971 to form the UAE. Each emirate is an absolute monarchy ruled\nby a sheik. The UAE has been integrating its economy with the global marketplace and has established a high\nstandard of living for its people. Two of the emirates\u2014Abu Dhabi and Dubai\u2014possess most of the oil reserves.\nAbu Dhabi is the capital city and consists of 87 percent of the land area in the UAE. The head of the royal family\nin this emirate is considered the head of state for the UAE.\nFigure 8.41 The Seven Emirates of the UAE 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 670\nIt is evident that one emirate, Abu Dhabi, dominates in terms of square miles of physical area.\nDubai has turned its small emirate into an international trade center. The emirate has used its oil reserves to\npromote trade and commerce. Dubai built itself a world-class port facility equaling that of Hong Kong or New\nYork. As a free-trade zone, there are no taxes or tariffs, so international corporations use the location as a trade\ncenter to bring high-volume buyers and sellers together. Dubai has been looking ahead to its future when the\noil runs out. The creation of an international trade center would be a means to gain economic income when the\nrevenue from the sale of oil diminishes.\nOil wealth and the need for workers have opened up economic opportunities in the UAE that have attracted\nlaborers and businesspeople from many parts of the world. Noncitizens make up about 80 percent of the\npopulation; about half the noncitizens are from South Asia, and many are Muslims from India. The large number\nof laborers that are required to develop the infrastructure has created an imbalance between the percentage\nof men and women. There are about twice the number of men than there are women in Dubai. This has\ncreated an interesting dynamic for women in Dubai, who have more rights and opportunities than those in more\nconservative Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia. The UAE presents an excellent example of people migrating\nfrom peripheral countries to a core region in search of opportunities and advantages in a globalized economic\ncommunity.\nThe UAE has invested its oil income in building up its infrastructure to compete in a global economy. Hundreds\nof billions of dollars of construction projects are under way in Dubai alone. Dubai has the world\u2019s tallest structure,\nthe most expensive hotel, the world\u2019s most expensive airport (when completed), and the world\u2019s largest artificial\nislands. Dubai is even home to an indoor downhill ski resort complete with real snow. Other ventures such as the\nDubailand entertainment complex and Dubai Sports City have also been proposed. The downturn in the world\u2019s 671 World Regional Geography\neconomic situation has slowed the development in this emirate but has not diminished its perspective on the\nfuture.\nFigure 8.42 Free-Trade Zone of Dubai\nThe skyline of Dubai includes the tallest building in the world.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe Sultanate of Oman\nRuled by a sultan, the absolute monarchy of Oman on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula also controls\nthe tip of land next to the Strait of Hormuz. All oil tankers leaving the Persian Gulf must pass through this vital\nchoke point. Mountains reach more than nine thousand feet in the eastern region of Oman, and rugged arid central 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 672\nplains cover the central region. The country gets plenty of sunshine and has some excellent beaches. Annual\nrainfall varies from four inches or fewer in the eastern sector to as much as twenty-five inches in the southwest.\nThe climate is generally hot: temperatures can reach 120 \u00b0F from May to September.\nOman has been using its oil income to build infrastructure to benefit its people. The sultan of Oman has\nwidespread support from his people and has built up goodwill from the international community for his\ninvestments in his country. He has built a free-trade zone with a giant container port facility, luxury tourist hotels,\na good road system, and a first-rate international airport. He has also provided clean drinking water to the rural\nareas. Though Oman is not a democracy, the sultan has been positive role model for other monarchs. He has used\nOman\u2019s oil wealth to help his country develop and modernize. The mountains of Oman have additional natural\nresources such as gold, marble, and copper.\nA lack of fresh water is a concern for Oman. The nation has limited renewable water resources. More than 90\npercent of the water available is used in agriculture, and the rest is used for industry and domestic consumption.\nFresh water is piped throughout most of the country, but shortages occur at times because of droughts and limited\nrainfall. Environmental problems have also arisen in Oman. For example, irrigation operations have caused soil\nconditions such as a salt buildup. Oil tankers traveling through the Strait of Hormuz and along the coast in the\nGulf of Oman have leaked oil, which has washed up on coastal areas where attractive beaches are located. The\nhigher level of exploitation of the environment by a growing population has exacted a toll on the organisms that\nlive in the fragile desert ecosystems. Mammals, birds, and other organisms are in danger of extinction, including\nthe Arabian leopard, the mountain gazelle, and the Arabian oryx. The country may lose its biodiversity unless\naction is taken toward preservation.\nYemen\nYemen is a mountainous country bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. The tallest mountains on the\npeninsula\u2014reaching more than twelve thousand feet in elevation\u2014are located here. The four main regions of\nYemen are the eastern desert region of the Rub\u2019 al Khali; the Eastern Highlands south of the Rub\u2019 al Khali; the\nWestern Highlands, which have the highest peaks; and the western coastal plains. The Western Highlands receive\nabout thirty inches of rain per year, while the eastern desert received almost no rainfall. A number of volcanic\nislands are located off the coast. A volcano on one of the islands erupted as recently as 2007. This region is an\nextension of the rift valley system coming out of East Africa. 673 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.43 Four Physical Regions of Yemen\nThe highest peak in the Western Highlands is 12,028 feet in elevation.\nMap courtesy of CIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nThe economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Most of the farmland is in the form of terraces cut into\nthe mountainsides that trap rainwater as it flows down the slope from one terrace to the next. Food production\nis a primary concern because in 2010 the population was more than twenty-four million and increasing rapidly.\nThe arid land has few trees, but firewood is in high demand for cooking. The demand for firewood has caused\ndeforestation, which in turn has caused serious soil erosion and damage to the mountain terraces that produce the\nfood. Yemen is facing serious environmental concerns. The fast-growing population will only put more pressure\non the environmental systems. On the positive side, oil and natural gas reserves are being found in some quantities,\nwhich will assist with the economic conditions and help supply the energy needed in the future.\nWomen in Yemen do not have the opportunities available in some of the more urbanized and modernized Gulf\nStates. The contrast between the rural dynamics of Yemen and the urban culture of Dubai provides an excellent\nexample of a rural versus urban or a core versus peripheral spatial relationship. The basic formula of family\nsize and income levels applies to Yemen. In 2010, the fertility rate declined to 4.8 from more than 7.0 in 2000\n(IndexMundi). Rural-to-urban shift is causing cities within Yemen to grow at an increasing rate. Large family\nsizes are forcing young people to seek out opportunities and advantages in the cities or in other countries. The 8.5 Arabs, Islam, and Oil 674\nsituation is only going to intensify, as the population of Yemen is projected to reach sixty million by 2050 at the\ncurrent rate of increase.\nYemen has a democratically elected government that came about when North Yemen and South Yemen merged\ninto one country to create a democratic republic in 1990. The population of Yemen is about 40 percent Shia and\n60 percent Sunni. Yemen sided with Iraq and Saddam Hussein in the First Persian Gulf War in Kuwait, which\nresulted in Saudi Arabia expelling thousands of Yemeni workers. Yemen and Saudi Arabia have had a long-\nstanding territorial dispute and only recently agreed on the desert border between the two countries. As the lone\ndemocracy on the peninsula, Yemen contrasts with the more conservative Islamic states and monarchies such as\nSaudi Arabia that are more common in the Middle East. Poor, rural, and agriculturally based, Yemen does not fit\nthe mold of the typical oil-rich sheikdom of the region.\nThe cultural forces within Yemen demonstrate the dichotomy between modernization with democratic reforms\nand fundamentalist Islamic tendencies. Stability in Yemen is critical for the security of the regional waterways. In\nthe past decade, piracy against ships off the coast of Somalia has increased, and many ships have been boarded\nand taken hostage by pirates demanding high ransoms for the release of the ship and crew. Security in the region\nis critical to support safe passage for international shipping activity through the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-\nMandeb Strait.\nYemen experienced civil unrest and citizen protests in the spring of 2011 similar to those in the other Arab\ncountries. The protests and demonstrations targeted political corruption, economic conditions, and high\nunemployment. During this time, the government was also looking to modify its constitution. The protesters\nshifted their focus to call for the president of Yemen to resign after twenty-one years in power. The president\nand government resisted, and the conflicts turned more serious. Clans not loyal to the president sided with the\nprotesters, and the Yemeni president was seriously injured in a military clash. He was flown to Saudi Arabia for\nmedical treatment. When the president recovered and returned to Yemen he still refused to step down. The country\ncontinues to adjust to the situation.\nFigure 8.44 The Capital of Yemen 675 World Regional Geography\nSana\u2019a, an ancient city, is the capital of Yemen and the largest city, with a population of more than two million people.\nStep \u2013 From atop the Gate, Sana\u2019a Yemen \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Arabian Peninsula is a desert region. The Rub\u2019 al-Khali (Empty Quarter) provides an example of desert\nextremes. The mountains along the western and southern edges receive the most rainfall. There are no rivers\nor major lakes on the peninsula. Water, a resource that is vital to human activity, is scarce throughout the\nregion.\n\u2022 The export of oil and natural gas is what drives the economies of the region. Many of the states are working\nto diversify their economies with banking, free-trade zones, and even tourism.\n\u2022 Yemen is the only country with a truly democratically elected government. Leaders of royal families rule in\nthe other countries as heads of state with varying degrees of shared governance.\n\u2022 Family size varies widely in the region, from more than 4.5 in Yemen to around 2.5 in the progressive Gulf\nStates of Qatar, the UAE, and Bahrain. Women\u2019s rights and opportunities have an inverse relationship with\nfamily size; that is, when women\u2019s rights and opportunities increase, family size usually decreases. In the\nGulf States, the smaller countries in land area are more open to promoting women\u2019s rights and\nresponsibilities in the public and private sectors.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Ancient cities such as Nineveh, Ur, and Babylon were located here. Present-\nday Iraq and Kuwait were established out of the British Mandate territory gained following Britain\u2019s defeat of\nthe Turkish Ottoman Empire. Britain established straight-line political boundaries between Iraq and Jordan,\nSyria, and Saudi Arabia. These types of boundaries are called geometric boundaries because they do not follow\nany physical feature. In 1961, when Britain withdrew from the region, the emir controlling the southern region\nbordering the Persian Gulf requested that Britain separate his oil-rich kingdom as an independent country. This\ncountry became Kuwait, and the rest of the region became Iraq. After a series of governments in Iraq, the Baath\nparty came to power in 1968, paving the way for Saddam Hussein to gain power in 1979. 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 680\nFigure 8.46 Iraq\u2019s Divisions of Islam as of 2008\nThe two ethnic divisions are Arab and Kurd. The two religious divisions of Islam are Shia and Sunni. Karbala and Najaf both have holy sites for Shia Muslims. 681 World Regional Geography\nIran-Iraq War (1980\u201388)\nIn 1980, a disagreement arose over the Shatt al-Arab waterway in the Persian Gulf on the border between Iraq\nand Iran, and the feud led to war between the two countries. The people of Iran are not Arabs; their ethnic\nbackground is Persian. Most Iranians are Shia Muslims. Saddam Hussein and his Baath party were Arabs and\nSunni Muslims. Ethnic and religious differences thus fueled the conflict. The Shatt al-Arab waterway was quickly\nfilled with wrecked ships. The local battle escalated into an all-out war, which ended in 1988 without anyone\ndeclaring a victory. The Iran-Iraq War was as close to World War III as the world has ever seen, with more than\na million casualties and a cost of more than one hundred billion dollars. World powers aligned themselves with\none side or the other. Before the war, the Iranian government had been taken over by Islamic fundamentalists who\nopposed the US intervention in the region; therefore, in the Iran-Iraq War, the United States supported Hussein\nand provided him with industrial supplies and materials.\nThe Persian Gulf War (1990\u201391)\nAfter the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam Hussein looked to Kuwait to gain new oil wealth and expand access to the Persian\nGulf. By taking over Kuwait, Iraq would gain an excellent port on the Persian Gulf and earn more income from\noil reserves. Hussein accused Kuwait of slant drilling oil wells along the Iraqi border and removing oil that was\nlegally Iraq\u2019s. It was common knowledge that both sides were engaged in this practice, but it was the excuse\nHussein needed to invade Kuwait and reclaim it as the nineteenth province of Iraq.\nIn 1990, the Iraqi military invaded and occupied Kuwait. Though the world community opposed this action, it was\nnot until Hussein nationalized all the oil assets of the international oil corporations that resistance was organized.\nUnder the leadership of US president George H. W. Bush, the United Nations (UN) organized a military coalition\nto remove Hussein from Kuwait. On January 16, 1991, Operation Desert Storm began. After forty-five days of\nfighting, Iraq was overwhelmingly defeated and its military was ousted from Kuwait. This was a major victory for\nthe coalition. It was during this time that President Bush publicly announced the emergence of the potential New\nWorld Order. Kuwait was not a democracy but a monarchy ruled by an emir. Clearly, the war was not a war over\ndemocracy; it was a war over the control of resources.\nWhen it became evident that Hussein would lose Kuwait, his forces dynamited all the oil facilities and set all the\noil wells in Kuwait on fire. His position was that if he could not have the oil, then nobody would. This was one 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 682\nof the worst environmental catastrophes regarding oil on record. Oil flowed into the Persian Gulf and covered the\nwater\u2019s surface up to three feet thick. Most mammals, birds, and organisms living on the water\u2019s surface died. Oil\nflowed out onto the desert sand into large petroleum lakes. The air pollution caused by burning oil wells dimmed\nthe sun and caused serious health problems.\nEthnic and Cultural Divisions\nTo keep Iraq from breaking apart after Operation Desert Storm, coalition forces allowed Hussein to remain in\npower. Ethnically and religiously, Iraq is divided into three primary groups that generally do not get along. Sunni\nArabs dominate central Iraq in a region often referred to as the Sunni Triangle, which includes the three cities\nof Baghdad, Tikrit (Hussein\u2019s hometown), and Ramadi. Sunnis were the most loyal to the Hussein government.\nSoutheastern Iraq is dominated by Arabs who follow the Shia division of Islam, which is also followed by most\nof Iran\u2019s population. A group that is ethnically Kurdish and follows the Sunni division dominates northern Iraq.\nKurds are not Arabs or Persians; rather, they originated from somewhere in northern Europe centuries ago with\ntheir own religion, language, and customs. Many have converted to Islam.\nHussein was a Sunni Muslim, and when he was in power, he kept the other two groups in check. He used chemical\nweapons on the Kurds during the Iran-Iraq War. In 1988, he used chemical weapons on the Kurdish town of\nHalabja and killed about 10 percent of the eighty thousand who lived there. Thousands of Kurds died in other\nattacks, and thousands more continue to suffer serious health effects. After Operation Desert Storm, Hussein\npushed the Kurds north until the UN and the United States restricted him at the thirty-sixth parallel, which became\na security zone for the Kurds. The Arab Shia population in the south often clashed with Hussein\u2019s military in an\nattempt to gain more political power, and Hussein subjected them to similar harsh conditions and treatment. 683 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.47 Homelands of the Kurdish People, Indicated by the Shaded Areas\nFuture Kurdistan would be the main portions in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey and a corner of Syria. The city of Diyarbakir in Turkey would\nbe the Kurdish capital city.\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe Arab Shia population in the southeast makes up most of the Iraqi people. The two main cities of Karbala and\nNajaf contain holy sites for Shia followers worldwide. The Shia population is three times larger than the Kurdish\npopulation in Iraq; more Kurds live outside Iraq than live in Iraq. The Kurds are the largest nation of people in\nthe world without a country. About twenty-five million Kurds live in the Middle East, and most\u2014about fourteen\nmillion\u2014live in Turkey. About eight million Kurds live in Iran, about seven million live in Iraq, and a few others\nlive in neighboring countries. At the 1945 conference of the UN, they petitioned to have their own country called\nKurdistan carved out of Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, but they were denied. You will recall from Section 8.4 \u201cIsrael and\nIts Neighbors\u201d that Israel was approved to become a nation at the same UN conference.\nThe Iraq War (2003\u201311)\nAfter the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States, there was a renewed interest in weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMD). Knowing that Hussein had used chemical weapons on the Kurds, the Iranians, and the Shia,\nthere was a concern that he would use them again. UN Weapons inspectors in Iraq never could confirm that 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 684\nHussein retained WMD. They had been destroyed, moved out of Iraq, or hidden. US president George W. Bush\ndecided to invade Iraq in 2003 to remove Hussein from power. In the invasion, Hussein\u2019s two sons were killed\nand Hussein was captured. One aspect of the invasion plan was to use Iraq\u2019s vast oil reserves to help pay for the\ncost of the war, which quickly ballooned to more than a billion dollars a week. Fundamentalist Islamic insurgents\nmade the war difficult.\nThe US invasion of Iraq brought about the removal of the Baath Party from power and Iraq came under a military\noccupation by a multinational coalition. An Iraqi Interim Government was formed that assumed sovereignty\nin 2004. A new constitution was drafted and approved by vote of the Iraqi people. Elections were held and a\nnew government was formed under the newly drafted constitution. Occupying troops continued to remain as the\ncountry struggled to adapt to the reforms. Insurgencies developed that brought about an increase in violence that\npeaked in about 2007. By 2010, the combat operations by occupying troops were ending and the country worked\nto sustain stable political conditions. Under an agreed upon mandate all combat troops were to withdraw as of the\nend of 2011. A number of US troops will remain in Iraq in an advisory capacity.\nFigure 8.48 Soldiers from the 926th Engineer Brigade Combat Team and the Army 432d Civil Affairs Battalion Patrol in Baghdad\u2019s District of Sadr City\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003 and removed Saddam Hussein from power. 685 World Regional Geography\nUS Department of Defense \u2013 public domain.\nResources and Globalization\nIn geographic terms, the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War were wars over resources\u2014namely, oil. Wars have\nhistorically been fought over territory and resources. When the United States invaded in 2003, Hussein was\ncontracting billions of dollars worth of projects to oil companies in France, Russia, and China. Other support\nprojects were contracted out to other European countries. When the United States invaded, the contracts with were\nsummarily canceled, and British and US oil contractors took over the projects.\nFigure 8.49 News Reports of Iraqi Contracts at the Time of the US Invasion of Iraq 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 686\nAfter the US invasion, many of the contracts Iraq had with other countries were canceled.\nSource: New York Times, December 10, 2003.\nIraq is an example of the second wave of globalization. Neocolonialism has been the dominant force in Iraq\u2019s\neconomy since before the Persian Gulf War. Industrialization requires high energy demands; therefore, the\nindustrialized countries of the world consume energy on a massive scale. Iraq is not a core economic country,\nbut it holds vast petroleum reserves, making it vulnerable to exploitation by industrialized core countries. It is\ninteresting to note that the Persian Gulf War, initiated in response to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, can be traced\ndirectly to globalism. It was Britain that established the straight-line borders separating Kuwait and Iraq. The\nwar over the control of Kuwait in 1991 was a war over the control of resources, just as the ongoing competition\nbetween Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims, for example, is a competition for the control of political power or\nresources and not a competition related to ethnic principles. 687 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.50 The Three Core Economic Areas of the World That Consume High Levels of Energy\nThe East African Community (EAC) is not an official organization but a core economic area.\nHussein proved to be a destabilizing force and a potential threat to the established so-called New World Order of\nglobal security and trade as outlined by US president George H. W. Bush. The removal of Hussein from power\nbrought to the surface the competition between the trilateral powers of North America, Europe, and East Asia. It\nremains to be seen who will have control of or access to Iraq\u2019s natural resources.\nPolitics, Oil Companies, and the Administration of US President George W. Bush\nThere are many connections between the administration of former US president George W. Bush and the international\noil industry. Bush once owned the failed Texas oil company Arbusto Energy and was president of Spectrum 7 Energy\nCorporation, which bought out Arbusto. Bush was also on the board of Harken Energy Corporation when it bought out\nSpectrum 7 Energy. Bush\u2019s father, former US president George H. W. Bush, owned the Zapata Oil Company, which\ndrilled the first offshore Kuwaiti oil well and later merged to become Pennzoil. US vice president Dick Cheney was\nCEO of Halliburton, the world\u2019s most extensive oil service company. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans was former\nCEO of Tom Brown Inc., an independent oil and gas company based out of Denver. Secretary of State Condoleezza\nRice was a Chevron Corporation board member and had an oil supertanker named after her\u2014the Condoleezza Rice. The\nformer US secretary of state under former president George H. W. Bush (Sr.) was James Baker III, who had been a\ncentral attorney for an oil consortium building one of the largest oil pipelines in Central Asia. President George W. Bush 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 688\nappointed Zalmay Khalilzad, a former aide to the American oil company UNOCAL, as special envoy to Afghanistan,\nthen as ambassador to Iraq, and then to the UN.\nFigure 8.51 Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice During the US Presidential Administration of George\nW.

The top personnel\nin the George W. Bush administration (2001\u20139) is an example of the relationships that develops between corporate\nleaders and political leaders. In this case, the relationship centered on the oil industry. 689 World Regional Geography\nTurkey\nTurkey is the only remaining country of the vast Ottoman Empire, which ruled the region for seven hundred years\n(1299\u20131923 CE). When the empire was at its peak in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it controlled parts of\nEurope, North Africa, the Middle East, and Arabia. Located on the Bosporus\u2014the straits that connect the Black\nSea with the Mediterranean Sea\u2014the ancient city of Constantinople was the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\nCalled Istanbul today, this city is the largest in Turkey, but it is not the current capital. Turkey moved its capital\nto Ankara on the Anatolian Plateau, which is centrally located in Turkey.\nTurkey has a small portion of its land area on the western side of the Bosporus to claim its connection to Europe.\nMost of Turkey\u2019s land area is a part of the Asian continent, and Turkey has often been referred to as Asia Minor.\nMountains on Turkey\u2019s eastern border with Armenia include Mount Ararat, which is the highest peak in the\ncountry at 16,946 feet in elevation. Legend has it that Mount Ararat was the resting place of the legendary Noah\u2019s\nark. The people of Turkey are neither Arab nor Persian; they are Turkish and speak the Turkish language. As much\nas 90 percent of the Turkish population is Sunni Muslim, which is similar to many of the other Muslim countries\nin the Middle East.\nFigure 8.52 Turkey\nThe map shows the portion of Turkey in Europe to the west, the central Anatolian Plateau, the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and\nMount Ararat on the Armenian border. 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 690\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nTurkey is an established secular democracy with a democratically elected political leadership. To maintain its\ndemocracy, it has had to deal with Islamic fundamentalists, who often have supported a shift to an Islamic\nreligious state. Turkey has also had to negotiate with its neighbors, Syria and Iraq, over water rights to the Tigris\nand Euphrates Rivers, which originate in Turkey but flow through the other countries. Turkey has built dams on\nthese rivers, much to the dismay of its neighbors, who want to use more of the water.\nTurkey borders northern Iraq and was home to fifty-six million Turks and fourteen million Kurds as of 2010.\nThe Kurdish claim of a homeland in eastern Turkey has not been recognized by the Turkish government. Open\nrebellion has been expressed by Kurdish groups wishing to become independent of Turkey, but the Turkish\ngovernment has oppressed any movement toward independence. Many Kurds have migrated to Istanbul in search\nof work. They live and work in Istanbul and send money back to their families in eastern Turkey. The large city of\nDiyarbakir in eastern Turkey is predominantly Kurdish and is considered by many Kurds as the city that would\nbe their capital if they had their own country of Kurdistan.\nFigure 8.53 A City Park outside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul 691 World Regional Geography\nThe capital city of Turkey is Ankara, which is located in the center of the country. Istanbul remains the primate city of the country\nand is home to various world-class mosques.\nJeremy Vandel \u2013 Blue Mosque \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nTurkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and has been a US ally. The United States\nhas been allowed to have military bases in Turkey, which were helpful in Operation Desert Storm during the 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 692\nFirst Persian Gulf War. In spite of being allies, Turkey did not allow the US military to use these bases as direct\ninvasion points when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The Iraq War is a major concern for Turkey, since\nTurkey has a major stake in the stability of the Middle East. Possessing a small portion of its land area in Europe\nand being a member of NATO provides Turkey with an opening to join the European Union (EU), but so far it\nhas been denied membership, mainly because of Turkey\u2019s controversial human rights record, conflicts with the\nKurds, disagreements with Greece over Cyprus, and low economic indicators. Conditions are improving, and at\nsome future point Turkey may have an opportunity to join the EU.\nTo date, the EU does not have an Islamic country in its membership; Turkey may be the first. The country has\nvarious ways of gaining wealth that could help support Europe\u2019s other industrial activities. Turkey grows large\nquantities of food in the central Anatolian Plateau; vast fields of grain extend across this central plateau. Turkey\nalso has some oil resources in the east and minerals in the mountains bordering Armenia and Georgia.\nCyprus\nThe island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean Sea is officially a part of Europe and a member of the EU. The island\nis separated by the Green Line, monitored by the UN, which divides the Greek-dominated south from the Turkish-\ndominated north. The two sides have been separated since a civil war in 1974. Turkish groups in the north have declared\ntheir half of the island the independent Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey is the only country that recognizes\nthis proclamation; the rest of the world considers the whole island the Republic of Cyprus.\nFigure 8.54 Divided Cyprus 693 World Regional Geography\nThe island of Cyprus is divided by the Green Line, which is monitored by the UN. Turkish Cypriots control the north and have declared it the\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Greek Cypriots control the southern half of the island. The whole island is considered one country by the\nUN, which does not recognize the Turkish Cypriots\u2019 claim to independence.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nIran\nIran covers a physical area larger than the US state of Alaska. It is a land of mountains and deserts: Iran\u2019s central\nand eastern regions are mainly desert with few inhabitants, and the northern and western regions of the country are\nmountainous. The Elburz Mountains in the north around the Caspian Sea reach as high as eighteen thousand feet\nin elevation near the capital city of Tehran. The Zagros Mountains run along the border with Iraq and the Persian\nGulf for more than nine hundred miles and can reach elevations greater than fourteen thousand feet. Similar to\nthe Atlas Mountains in the Maghreb, Iran\u2019s mountains trap moisture, allowing minor agricultural activities in the\nvalleys. Most of Iran\u2019s population lives in cities along the mountain ranges. Qanats\u2014systems of shafts or wells\nalong mountain slopes\u2014bring water from the mountains to the valleys for irrigation and domestic use. 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 694\nPersian Empire to Islamic Republic\nFigure 8.55 2010 Population Estimates for the Ethnic Triangle of the Middle East, with Egypt, Turkey, and Iran Anchoring Each Corner\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nIran was once the center of the Persian Empire, which has its origins as far back as 648 BCE, and the country\nwas called Persia until about 1935. The Ethnic Triangle of the Middle East consists of Persians in Iran, Turks in\nTurkey, and Arabs in Arabia (see Figure 8.55 \u201c2010 Population Estimates for the Ethnic Triangle of the Middle\nEast, with Egypt, Turkey, and Iran Anchoring Each Corner\u201d). Most of the seventy million people in Iran are\nPersian. Iran has a long history with the ancient Persian Empire and the various conquering armies that followed it.\nDuring the rise of Islam, Iran had major contributions to the arts, mathematics, literature, philosophy, and science.\nThe highly advanced carpet-weaving traditions from centuries past are but one example of the advancements in\ndesign and the technical expertise of the people. The country\u2019s Persian identity and culture continued throughout\nthe centuries under different ruling powers. The Persian language remains and is a branch of the Indo-European 695 World Regional Geography\nlanguage family. Arabic is widely used as a second language and a language used in science, which was helpful\nin reaching a broader audience and reaching out to the regional community with academic and scientific findings.\nFigure 8.56 Main Mountains and Desert Areas in Iran\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nIn 1971, Iran celebrated the 2,500th anniversary of Persia\u2019s first monarchy. The monarchy was ruled by a shah,\nwhich is a title for the sovereign leader in Iran similar to a king. The shah\u2019s royal family ruled Iran from 1923 to 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 696\n1979, when Islamic fundamentalists took control of the government. It was during this revolution on November\n4, 1979, that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had previously been exiled by the shah, urged Iranians to\noppose US activities in Iran. Iranian students stormed the US embassy and took US citizens hostage. Fifty-two\nAmericans were held for 414 days during the US presidency of Jimmy Carter. The hostages were released the\nday that US president Ronald Reagan took office. Khomeini indicated he had not been aware of the students\u2019\nplan but supported it. This is one reason the United States backed Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq War of the\n1980s. Khomeini ruled Iran until his death in 1989. Since then, Iran has been an Islamic state with an ayatollah\nas the Supreme Leader. An ayatollah is a high-ranking Shia cleric that is an expert in the Islamic faith and the\nSharia (Muslim code of law based on the Koran). There are cases where women have reached the same status\nas an ayatollah and known as Lady Mujtahideh. Approximately 90 percent of Iran\u2019s population follows the Shia\ndivision of Islam.\nPolitical Challenges\nOn the international front, Iran\u2019s leadership has indicated a drive to develop nuclear weapons and use them\nagainst Israel, which has caused concern in the global community. The government of Iran does not recognize\nthe legitimacy of the nation of Israel. US president George W. Bush included Iran, along with Iraq and North\nKorea, in his 2002 Axis of Evil speech, the focus of which was the lack of democratic freedoms and the restrictive\nmeasures of the Islamic fundamentalist government. Iran is similar to Saudi Arabia in its restrictions of civil\nrights. A number of countries including the United States have placed trade sanctions against Iran regarding any\nmaterials associated with nuclear weapons or missiles. The US sanctions extend to an almost total trade embargo\nagainst Iran stemming from the 1979 revolution.\nOpen protests expressing a need for change have periodically erupted in the streets of Tehran. Ultimately,\nprotesters are seeking personal freedoms and a more open society. The Arab Spring of 2011 was a phenomenon\nthat spread across North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Middle East. Iran was not immune from the impact\nof the protests and demonstrations that occurred in their neighboring countries, but Iran was different. First of\nall, Iranians are not Arab but Persian in their ethnicity. Their history and heritage creates a distinct identity that\nseparates them from the rest of the region. Many Iranian citizens want the same outcomes that the protesters and\ndemonstrators want in the countries experiencing the Arab Spring revolutions. The difference is that Iranians have\nbeen demonstrating and protesting issues with their government in the years before 2011. Political tensions in\nIran have been high since the 2009 elections and even earlier. During the 2009 election in Iran, students and other 697 World Regional Geography\nindividuals used the Internet, Twitter, and cell phones to organize a massive protest against the current president\nand in support of opposition candidates. The demonstrations were called the Twitter Revolution.\nFigure 8.57 Twitter Revolution in Iran\nDuring the 2009 election in Iran, students and other individuals used the Internet, Twitter, and cell phones to organize a protest against the current president and in support of\nopposition candidates. The demonstrations were called the Twitter Revolution.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIran is at a crossroads in the conflict between conservative Islamic fundamentalists and Islamic reformers. The\ngovernment of the Islamic state is controlled by Muslim clerics who tend to be more conservative in their rulings,\nbut the young people are mainly on the side of the democratic reformers. Young people are becoming more\nfamiliar with Western culture. For example, the unofficial holiday of Valentine\u2019s Day has become extremely\npopular in Iran and is celebrated by a large sector of the population, mainly young people. In an effort to curb 8.6 Iraq, Turkey, and Iran 698\nthe influence of Western culture, on February 13, 2011, the government of Iran officially banned all symbols or\nactivities associated with Valentine\u2019s Day. One claim was that the day was named after a Christian martyr and\ntherefore was not supportive of Islam.\nEconomic Resouces\nIran has abundant oil and natural gas reserves that are being exploited to form the base of their economy. Iran\nholds about 15 percent of the world\u2019s reserves of natural gas, which is second only to Russia (Infoplease). In 2010,\nthe country was the fourth-largest oil exporter in the world and held about 10 percent of the world\u2019s known oil\nreserves (Opec.org). The UN has classified Iran\u2019s economy as semideveloped. The government has taken control\nof the oil and natural gas industry and implemented a type of central planning over many major businesses.\nSmall-scale agriculture and village trading activities are not usually owned by the government. The Caspian Sea\nprovides for fishing and has oil reserves under the seabed. Oil and gas revenues make up most of the state\u2019s\nincome. However, fluctuations in commodity prices have resulted in a more volatile income stream, and Iran\u2019s\nmanufacturing base has been increasing to support a more diversified economy.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Iraq was ruled by Saddam Hussein from 1979 to 2003. Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, which prompted the\nFirst Persian Gulf War. Hussein\u2019s use of weapons of mass destruction provoked the US invasion in 2003,\nwhich eventually removed Hussein from power.\n\u2022 The majority Arab population in Iraq shares the country with the Kurds in the north. Sunni and Shia groups\nhave divided the country and opposed each other since the US invasion of 2003.\n\u2022 Turkey has a relatively stable, democratically elected government. Turkey\u2019s physical geography provides for\nlarge supplies of food crops and hydroelectric energy.\n\u2022 Iran is a religious state that has often been at war or clashed with its Middle Eastern neighbors. Reformers\nand many young people in Iran would like to see the country become more democratic and more open to\npersonal freedoms. 699 World Regional Geography\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Understand that Central Asia is a landlocked region that receives little rainfall and has to rely on water from\nmajor rivers flowing from the mountains in the east.\n2. Summarize how Central Asia has been transitioning from a Soviet-dominated region to independent states\nand what has been occurring in the various states to adapt to the new economic environment.\n3. Describe how the Aral Sea has been affected by the practices of water use in the region and the\nenvironmental consequences that have resulted from water use policies.\n4. Explain the geopolitical history of Afghanistan and why this area has been so difficult to govern under a\ncentral government.\n5. Learn why there is continual conflict in Afghanistan between Western military forces and local Taliban\ninsurgents.\n6. Understand the principle that globalization of the economy forces political units to compete over natural\nresources.\nCentral Asia (a.k.a. Turkestan)\nCentral Asia is a region in the Asian continent that extends from the mountains of western China to the shores\nof the Caspian Sea. Pakistan and Iran create the southern border of the region, and the vast expanse of Russia is\nto the north. Afghanistan is considered a part of the region even though it was never a formal part of the Soviet\nUnion. Central Asia was located on what was known as the Silk Road between Europe and the Far East and has\nlong been a crossroads for people, ideas, and trade.\nCentral Asia has an extremely varied geography, including high mountain passes through vast mountain ranges,\nsuch as the Tian Shan, Hindu Kush, and the Pamirs. The region is also home to the vast Kara Kum and Kyzyl\nKum Deserts, which dominate the interior with extensive spans of sand and desolation. The expansive treeless,\n701 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 702\ngrassy steppes that surround the desert regions are considered an extension of the steppes of Eastern Europe. Some\ngeographers think of the Eurasian Steppes as one single, homogenous geographical zone.\nUnder the sand and prairie grasses lay the some of the most extensive untapped reserves of gas and oil on the\nplanet. Natural resources are the main attraction of the region driving the economic forces that determine the\ndevelopment patterns of individual countries. Multinational corporations have vigorously stepped up their activity\nin the region.\nThe political systems are adjusting from the old Soviet Union\u2019s socialist policies to new democratic systems that\nare subject to high levels of authoritarian rule and corruption in business and politics.\nThe five countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan were part of the\nformer Soviet Union until its breakup in 1991. Today, with Afghanistan, they are independent countries that make\nup the region called Central Asia. The term stan means \u201cland of,\u201d so, for example, Uzbekistan is the land of the\nUzbeks. Central Asia is also referred to as Turkestan because of the Turkish influence in the region. The people\nof Turkey did not originate from the Middle East; they originated from northern Asia. They swept through Central\nAsia and dominated the region on their way to the Middle East. The Turkish language and heritage have had the\nmost significant impact on the people of Central Asia. Turkmenistan\u2019s name is another reminder of the Turkish\nconnection; it means \u201cthe land of the Turkmen.\u201d\nMost of the groups of Central Asia were nomadic peoples who rode horses and herded livestock on the region\u2019s\nvast steppes. This way of life continued until the 1920s, when the Soviet Union forced many of the groups to\nabandon their lifestyle and settle on collective farms and in cities. Most of the people of Central Asia continue to\nidentify culturally with their nomadic past. Central Asians who live in cities often demonstrate a mix of local and\nRussian culture in terms of dress and food because of the large influx of Russian populations in the region. More\nthan six million Russians and Ukrainians were resettled into Central Asia during Soviet rule. Russian is often used\nas a lingua franca.\nOne of the primary ways in which people distinguish themselves culturally is through religious practices. Despite\nthe area being part of the Soviet Union, where religious activities were discouraged, Islam was and still is the\ndominant religion. Most Central Asian Muslims are Sunnis.\nFigure 8.58 Central Asia, Formerly Part of the Soviet Union 703 World Regional Geography\nAfghanistan is also usually included as part of Central Asia, though it was never officially part of the Soviet Union.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nKazakhstan\nThe traditional people of Kazakhstan, who share a Mongol and Turkic heritage, moved into the Central Asia\nregion sometime after 1200 CE. The expansion of the Russian Empire under the tsars integrated Kazakhstan and\nits neighbors, which eased their transition when the tsarist system of Russian government gave way to the Soviet\nUnion. The influx of Russian people and culture had a major influence on Kazakhstan. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 704\nFigure 8.59 Deserts of Central Asia\nThe Aral Sea is decreasing in volume because of water being diverted from the two rivers to be used for irrigation of desert lands to\ngrow enormous crops of grains and cotton.\nUpdated from map courtesy of NASA \u2013 public domain.\nKazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, thereby creating the world\u2019s largest landlocked\nnation. It is the ninth-largest state on the planet in terms of square miles and is larger in physical area than of all of\nWestern Europe. This vast land is host to a wide variety of physical landscapes, including the high, snow-capped\npeaks of the ranges on the Chinese border. The western portions are lowlands bordering the Caspian Sea. The\nseemingly endless grasslands of the interior are one of the largest steppe regions in the world. The steppe region\nhas a semiarid type B climate. A large portion of southern Kazakhstan is desert, including the northern regions of\nthe Kyzyl Kum Desert. Colder type D climates are found in the northern regions of the country.\nThe steppe produces grain in large quantities and other agricultural products, while the productive mining of\nminerals adds to the national wealth. Kazakhstan ranks high in the mining of many metals and uranium. Even\ndiamonds are found here. Oil and natural gas extraction accounts for the largest sector of the country\u2019s economy\nand generates the largest export income. The Tengiz basin around the northeast shores of the Caspian Sea is\nhome to extensive petroleum reserves. Oil pipelines are expanding to transport the oil to port locations and other\ncountries, including China. The economy of Kazakhstan has been larger than the economies of all the other\nCentral Asian states combined. 705 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.60 Cultural Traditions in Kazakhstan\nKazakh performers demonstrate a cultural tradition of a game called \u201cCatch a Girl,\u201d in which the two riders (male and female) take\noff on horseback and try to catch each other. The female rider whips the male until she is caught. If the male catches the female, he\nis rewarded with a kiss.\nUS Air Force \u2013 public domain.\nKazakhstan also has a forward capital. During the Soviet era, the capital was located in the southeast at Almaty,\nbut after gaining independence in 1991, the capital was moved north to Astana to ensure that the Russian-\ndominated northeast would be monitored against devolutionary forces that desiring to secede and become part of\nthe Russian Republic. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 706\nUzbekistan\nUzbekistan physically borders all the Central Asian countries. It is the most populous Central Asian country,\nwith a population that exceeds twenty-seven million. Uzbekistan\u2019s eastern boundary extends deep into Kyrgyzstan\nterritory. The boundary lines were created during the Soviet era to provide the central government with more\ncontrol over its republics by politicizing enclaves to their benefit. Geographers call Uzbekistan a doubly\nlandlocked nation because all the countries that surround it are also landlocked. The main source of fresh water\ncomes from the Eastern Highland regions. The main rivers have been heavily diverted for irrigation and are often\ndepleted before reaching their destination at the Aral Sea.\nCotton is the main agricultural crop. Uzbekistan is one of the top producers of cotton in the world and is\na major exporter to world markets. The central and western regions have mainly arid desert climates and\nrely heavily on the fresh water flowing in from the mountains. Agriculture employs a full one-fourth of the\npopulation and accounts for one-fourth of the gross domestic product (GDP). The extraction of gold, minerals,\nand fossil fuels are also prime economic activities. The country has been transitioning from the old Soviet Union\u2019s\ncommand economy, which was controlled by the central government, to a market economy competing in a global\nmarketplace.\nUzbekistan is a country of young people: about one-third of the population is under the age of fifteen. Education\nwas heavily emphasized during the Soviet era; as a result, about 99 percent of the population is literate\u2014though\nabout one-third of the people still live in poverty. Islam emerged in this country after Uzbekistan won its\nindependence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union. In a culture of openness, Islam has risen in prominence to\nthe point that approximately 88 percent of Uzbeks profess Islamic beliefs. The most commonly spoken language\nis Persian\/Farsi.\nSamarkand and the country\u2019s capital city, Tashkent, are located in the eastern core region, which is home to\nmost of the population. Tashkent has an unofficial population of more than three million people. The city, which\nsits on the confluence of a local river and its tributaries, started as a caravanserai, or oasis for trade, along the\nSilk Road. Samarkand is Uzbekistan\u2019s second-largest city and is most noted as the central city of the Silk Road\nas well as an important historical city for Islamic scholars. In 2001, UNESCO declared this 2,750-year-old city a\nWorld Heritage Site. It is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world and has been one of the more\nimportant cities in Central Asia. The historical architecture is heavily influence by Islamic styles from Iran. The\nregion around Bukhara, Uzbekistan\u2019s fifth-largest city, has been occupied for at least the last five thousand years.\nBukhara was another important city on the Silk Road and is known for its Asian carpet and textile industry. This\nregion has been an important cultural, economic, and scholarly center for most of its known existence. 707 World Regional Geography\nFigure 8.61 Bibi Khanym Mosque, Samarkand, Uzbekistan\nSamarkand, called the crossroads of culture, is located on the ancient Silk Road to China.

The sea was once the fourth-largest\nbody of water in the world, but it has been reduced to a fraction of its original area. In 1960, the Aral Sea covered\nabout 26,254 square miles, an area larger than the size of the US state of West Virginia. By 2009, the sea covered\nless than 10 percent of the same area. The entire eastern portion of the sea has become a sand desert, complete\nwith the deteriorating hulls of abandoned fishing vessels. The loss of water is approximately equivalent to the\ncomplete draining of both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario in North America. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 708\nThe water loss escalated when the Syr Darya River, which flowed into the northern part of the sea, and the\nAmu Darya River, which flowed into the southern side of the sea, were diverted for the irrigation of cotton\nand other crops. At about 1,500 miles long, the Amu Darya is the region\u2019s longest river. Its source is the high\nmountain streams and lakes of the Pamir Mountains. Environmental problems were further exacerbated by the\nextensive use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural processes. The chemicals contaminated the water flowing\ninto the Aral Sea. Once the water dried up in the sea, the winds carried the buildup of chemicals and salt from\nthe dry seabed over the land, causing serious health-related problems in the nearby human population. Cancer and\nrespiratory illness rates continue to be higher than normal. Water and land pollution is a serious problem. Even the\nclimate around the Aral Sea has changed gradually because of the loss of water from evaporation for precipitation.\nThe climate is getting warmer in the summer and colder in the winter. The moderating affect that this large body\nof water had on its surrounding area is no longer as prominent as it once was.\nThe decline of the Aral Sea has destroyed habitats and the local economy. The fishing industry, which employed\nmore than sixty thousand people, has been devastated. The remaining western portion of the sea has a rising salt\ncontent that is contributing to the decline of the fish population. Adding to the environmental devastation, the\nSoviets conducted biological weapons experiments on an island that was once in the middle of the Aral Sea.\nHazardous wastes such as anthrax and toxic chemicals contaminated the land and found their way into the sea.\nEfforts have been made to marginalize the environmental damage of the contamination, but the damage has not\nbeen completely ameliorated. The sea has historically been an important environmental location for wildlife. It\nis located in a major flyway for migratory waterfowl in Central Asia and served as an important habitat. The\ndeterioration of the Aral Sea and the destruction of habitat for waterfowl and other organisms is one of the world\u2019s\nworst environmental catastrophes. The fact that the Aral Sea is located in a region that is not part of the core\neconomic area of the global community has rendered it \u201cout of sight and out of mind\u201d by entities that could\npotentially provide economic support.\nIn the northern portion of the Aral Sea, called the Little Aral Sea, there has been some success in abating the\ndeterioration of this once-thriving environmental habitat. A major dam has been constructed that partitions off\nthe Little Aral Sea, causing water from the Syr Darya River to increase the water level of the Little Aral Sea and\nreduce the salt content. Canals, dikes, and irrigation processes have been updated to reduce the loss of water and\nincrease the amount that flows into the northern section. The development efforts have caused the water level to\nrise and therefore have reinvigorated the once-struggling fishing industry. The efforts have been undertaken by\nKazakhstan\u2019s government, which controls the Little Aral Sea.\nFigure 8.62 Orphaned Ship in a Dry Seabed of the Former Eastern Region of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan 709 World Regional Geography\nThe eastern half of the sea is completely dry.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nA major part of the southern portion of the once thriving sea is located in Uzbekistan, which has not contributed\nthe economic attention necessary to halt the sea\u2019s continued deterioration. The remaining western portion of the\nUzbekistan side of the Aral Sea will continue to shrink if measures are not taken to address the loss of water from\nthe Amu Darya River. The eastern side was completely dry by 2009. Uzbekistan has responded to the situation by\ncontracting out to various multinational oil companies from Korea, China, and Russia to explore for oil beneath\nthe dry seabed.\nThe demise of the Aral Sea was caused in part by the diversion of water from its northern inlet, the Syr Darya\nRiver. At the other end of the Syr Darya River an additional factor augmented the lack of water flow: the Soviet\nUnion placed a dam on the river and allowed the overflow from the dam to flow into low-lying dry pans, creating\nartificial lakes. As a result, Aydar Lake was created and became the second-largest lake in Uzbekistan. Various\nspecies of fish were introduced and the lake became a major source for commercial fishing. Hundreds of tons\nof fish are harvested annually. Just as fishing was declining in the Aral Sea, the fishing industry was growing at\nAydar Lake. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 710\nFigure 8.63 Aral Sea\nThese satellite images compare the Aral Sea between 1989 and 2008. The eastern region was completely dry by 2009, whereas the\nnorthern portion was responding favorably to Kazakhstan\u2019s conservation efforts.\nNASA \u2013 public domain.\nTurkmenistan\nTo the south of the Amu Darya River is the desert country of Turkmenistan, which extends from the Caspian Sea\nto Afghanistan in the east. Turkmenistan is slightly larger in physical area than the US state of California. Roughly 711 World Regional Geography\n80 percent of the country is covered by the Kara Kum Desert, which is among the driest in the world. The southern\nmountains along the Iranian and Afghan border reach as high as 10,290 feet in elevation. Water from the Amu\nDarya River has been diverted by the seven-hundred-mile-long Kara Kum Canal through Turkmenistan to help\ngrow cotton and other agricultural products.\nThe transition from a Soviet republic to an independent state in 1991 brought many changes. The former\nleader of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, Saparmurat Niyazov, who went by the name Turkmenbashi\n(leader of the Turkmen people), dominated the presidency for fifteen years. Through his authoritarian rule, he\npromoted a traditional culture\u2014with Islam as the predominant religion\u2014and was notorious for developing a cult\nof personality. For example, he changed all the names of the days of the week and the months of the year to his\nname, the names of his family members, and the names of Turkmen heroes or famous people. Turkmenbashi\u2019s\nimage was printed on the currency, and large posters of him could be seen throughout the country. His book on\nimportant concepts, the Ruhnama (The Book of the Soul), was to be read by all schoolchildren and the public. After\nhis death in 2006, many of his actions were reversed. The country continues to transition to a stable democratic\nstate, though many of the same dynamics of corruption and authoritarian rule remain.\nTurkmenistan is blessed with the fourth-largest natural gas reserves in the world; the top three are Russia,\nIran, and the United States. The income from natural gas exports has become the country\u2019s greatest means of\ngaining wealth. Because Turkmenistan is landlocked, its government has been forced to partner with Russia to\nuse of Russia\u2019s pipelines to export the natural gas. Not wishing to rely on Russia\u2019s monopoly on the pipelines,\nTurkmenistan developed an additional pipeline to China to help boost income and profits. Many international\ncorporations are seeking to do business in Turkmenistan and Central Asia to corner a piece of the vast natural\nresources. Corporate colonialism is extremely active and has contributed to a high level of corruption in the\ngovernment and the business sector. It is unclear how much of the country\u2019s wealth filters down to most of\nthe population. Over the past decade, unemployment rates have exceeded 50 percent, and more than half the\npopulation lives below the poverty line.\nThe administrative center and largest city of Turkmenistan is its capital, Ashgabat, which has a population of\nabout one million. Ashgabat lies between the Kara Kum Desert and the mountains near the former Silk Road. In\nthe historic region of Central Asia, it is comparatively a very young town, having grown out of a small village\nfounded in 1818. Ashgabat is primarily a government and administrative center, although it has thriving cotton,\ntextile, and metalworking industries. Ashgabat is also a popular stop along the Trans-Caspian Railway. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 712\nKyrgyzstan\nLocal groups in the mountains of Central Asia make up the population of Kyrgyzstan. The forty rays of sun on the\ncountry\u2019s flag symbolize of the legendary forty tribes of Manas that represent the nation. The rugged landscape of\nthis mountainous land includes the high ranges of the Tian Shan Mountains, which can reach elevations as high\nas 24,400 feet and cover about 80 percent of the country. Snowfall from the mountains provides fresh water for\nagriculture as well as hydroelectric energy. Food crops can be grown in the valleys and the few lowland areas. Half\nthe population works in agriculture, and self-sufficiency in food production is a major objective for survival. The\nmountains hold deposits of metals and minerals that have a strong potential for adding to the national wealth. Oil\nand natural gas reserves are also available for exploitation. The government is seeking foreign aid and investments\nto help develop these resources.\nIn 2009, Kyrgyzstan had a population of about 5.4 million in a land area about the size of the US state of South\nDakota. About 30 percent of the population is under the age of fifteen, and about 36 percent of the population is\nurban. The western boundary with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan is winding and creates various small enclaves and\nexclaves of people from one country surrounded by people of another country and separated from their home\nnations.\nFigure 8.64 Flag of Kyrgyzstan 713 World Regional Geography\nThe flag of Kyrgyzstan has a symbol of the sun and forty rays of light indicating the legendary forty tribes of Manas that represent\nthe nation.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nKyrgyzstan\u2019s transition from a Soviet republic to independence was not smooth. The loss of the state social\nsafety net pushed the economy further to the informal sector, where trading and small transactions for personal\nsurvival are common. Shortages of consumer goods occur in rural areas and small towns. Kyrgyzstan is an isolated\ncountry that has been working to integrate itself into the global economy through technology and modernization.\nIn 2010, clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz brought about riots in the streets of major cities, resulting in more\nthan two hundred casualties and three hundred thousand displaced citizens. After the situation cooled down, the\ngovernment worked to stabilize itself with new leadership.\nFigure 8.65 Base Camp on South Inylchek Glacier in the Tian Shan Mountains, Kyrgyzstan 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 714\nThe mountain in background is Khan Tengri (22,949 feet).\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nA form of improvisational oral poetry, which allegedly dates back to more than one thousand years ago, is an\naspect of traditional culture that has been preserved. While common throughout the region, it is mainly found\nin Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Practitioners will often engage in \u201clyrical battles\u201d of folklore. These poets, often\naccompanied by two- or three-stringed instruments, will recite the Manas, an epic poem of Kyrgyzstan that details\nthe life of the Kyrgyzstan hero Manas. This epic tale is a renowned part of the culture and festivals of Kyrgyzstan.\nFigure 8.66 Storytelling Tradition 715 World Regional Geography\nA manaschi\u2014a traditional storyteller\u2014in Karakol, Kyrgyzstan, who has memorized entire epic legends of his history, recites the\nstories to others at a local festival.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 716\nTajikistan\nThe eastern region of Central Asia has some of the highest mountain ranges in the world; about 90 percent of\nTajikistan is mountainous, and more than half the country is 10,000 feet in elevation or higher. Ranges of the\nHimalayas extend from the south all the way to the western border with China. The Pamirs is a mountain range\nlocated where the Tian Shan, Karakorum, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges meet in Tajikistan, an area referred\nto as the Pamir Knot, or the roof of the world. Elevations in the Pamirs often exceed 24,500 feet. The Pamirs is\nthe source of the Amu Darya River and is home to the longest glacier outside the polar regions (forty-eight miles\nlong in 2009). There is great potential for hydroelectric power generation, and Tajikistan is developing the world\u2019s\nhighest dam.\nTajikistan has the smallest physical area of any country in Central Asia but has a population of about 7.3 million.\nOnly about one-fourth of the population is urban, and one-third of the population is younger than fifteen years of\nage. There is less ethnic or religious diversity; 80 percent of the people are ethnically Tajik and are Sunni Muslims.\nThough it has natural resources similar in quantity to those in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan\u2019s economy is not advanced\nenough to fully take advantage of its economic potential. Half the labor base works abroad and sends remittances\nback to their families for economic support. Unemployment is high, and job opportunities have not been able to\nkeep up with demand.\nDushanbe, the capital and largest city of Tajikistan, is situated on the confluence of two local rivers and is famous\nfor its Monday markets (Dushanbe means \u201cMonday\u201d in Tajik). Dushanbe, like Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, was\noriginally a small village; it became an administrative center for the region when the Soviet army conquered the\narea in 1929. Similar to many of the other cities and regions in Central Asia, the Soviets transformed the political\nand economic landscape and made Dushanbe a center for cotton and silk production. The Soviets also transformed\nthe cultural and ethnic makeup of the city by relocating tens of thousands of people from Russia and other regions\nof Central Asia to Dushanbe.\nThe transition from a Soviet Republic to an independent country in 1991 was difficult for Tajikistan. From\n1992 to 1997, a bitter civil war between regional factions killed more than fifty thousand people. Political\ninstability and corruption has hampered the growth of a market economy, and political power remains in the hands\nof the economic elite. Debt restructuring with Russia and an infusion of development loans from China have\naided the ailing economy. Aid from the US helped fund a thirty-six-million-dollar bridge linking Tajikistan and\nAfghanistan, which opened in August 2007. US aid has also contributed to infrastructure development designed\nto help US military operations in Afghanistan and in the region as a whole. Countries such as Russia, China, and\nthe United States are all looking to gain an advantage with their ties to Tajikistan to exploit the region\u2019s natural\nresources. 717 World Regional Geography\nAfghanistan\nPresent-day Afghanistan has been conquered by the likes of Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, and the Mogul\nEmpire and was a buffer zone for colonial feuds between Russia and British India. The high central mountain\nrange of the Hindu Kush dominates the country and leaves a zone of well-watered fertile plains to the north and a\ndry desert region to the south. Afghanistan is a remote region without access to the sea and acts as a strategic link\nbetween the Middle East and the Far East.\nFigure 8.67 Afghanistan\nKabul is the capital, and the southern city of Kandahar is the second-largest city.\nMap courtesy of CIA\u2013UT Austin Map Library \u2013 public domain. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 718\nThe Soviet Invasion and the Taliban\nIn 1979, the Soviet Union took advantage of ongoing ethnic warfare in Afghanistan to inject itself into the country.\nThe Soviets pushed in from the north and occupied much of Afghanistan until they completely withdrew in\n1989. During the Soviet occupation, the United States supported anti-Communist resistance groups such as the\nMujahideen with money, arms, and surface-to-air missiles. The missiles were instrumental in taking out Soviet\naircraft and MiG fighters, which caused a critical shift in the balance of power in the war. One of the major\nconnections between the for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Mujahideen was a Saudi national named\nOsama bin Laden. Support from the CIA through bin Laden to the Mujahideen was instrumental in defeating the\nSoviets.\nThe power vacuum left by the retreating Soviets allowed conflicts to reemerge between the many ethnic factions\nin Afghanistan. Dozens of languages are spoken in Afghanistan; the top two are Pashtu and Afghan Persian-Dari.\nThere are also a dozen major ethnic groups; the top two are Pashtun and Tajik. The groups regularly fight among\nthemselves, but they have also been known to form alliances. Rural areas are usually led by clan leaders who are\nnot part of any official arm of a national government. Afghanistan is a place where forming any national unity or\nidentity is not easy. The national government in the capital city of Kabul has little influence in the country\u2019s rural\nregions.\nThe Soviet invasion brought the internally warring factions together for a short period to focus on the Soviet\nthreat. Chaos and anarchy thrived after the Soviet forces withdrew, but the Islamic fundamentalist group known\nas the Taliban came forward to fill the power vacuum. One objective of the Taliban was to use Islam as a unifying\nforce to bring the country together. The problem with that concept was that there was much diversity in how Islam\nwas practiced by the numerous local groups. Many of the factions in Afghanistan opposed the Taliban; one such\ngroup being the Northern Alliance, which was an association of groups located in the northern portion of the\ncountry. The civil war between the Taliban and those that opposed them resulted in the deaths of more than fifty\nthousand people by 1996 when the Taliban emerged to take power in Kabul. The Taliban is a Sunni Muslim group\nthat adheres to strict Islamic laws under the Wahhabi branch of the faith similar to that of Saudi Arabia. Under\nTaliban rule, women were removed from positions in hospitals, schools, and work environments and had to wear\nburkas (also spelled burqas) and be covered from head to toe, including a veil over their faces. Violators were\neither beaten or shot. The Taliban brought a sense of militant order to Kabul and the regions under their control.\nVarious factions such as the Northern Alliance did not share the Taliban\u2019s strict Islamic views and continued to\noppose their position in power. 719 World Regional Geography\nAl-Qaeda and the US Invasion\nAfter the war against the Soviet Union was over, the US role in Afghanistan diminished. The groups that\nthe United States had supported continued to vie for power in local conflicts. Osama bin Laden remained in\nAfghanistan and established training camps for his version of an anti-Western resistance group called al-Qaeda.\nJust as he had opposed the Soviet Union, he now opposed the United States, even though the United States had\nsupported him against the Soviets. The Saudi government allowed the United States to establish military bases\nin Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War, and this was one reason for bin Laden\u2019s\nopposition; he believed that non-Muslims should not be on the same ground as the Muslim holy sites of Mecca\nand Medina.\nThe 9-11 attack in New York City was traced back to al-Qaeda and bin Laden, who was residing in Afghanistan\nat the time. In a military action dubbed Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States invaded Afghanistan\nin 2001, removed the Taliban from power, and dismantled the al-Qaeda training camps. Although bin Laden\nescaped, the terror of the Taliban was temporarily reduced. Women were allowed to return to the workplace, and\nthe rebuilding of the country became a priority. The country was devastated by war and is divided by the human\ngeography because of the various ethnic and traditional groups. Afghanistan is one of the most impoverished\nplaces on Earth. The armed conflicts in Afghanistan did not end with the US invasion. After regrouping, the\nTaliban rallied its supporters on the Pakistani side of the border and returned to the fighting front in Afghanistan\nagainst North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and US forces.\nFigure 8.68 Propaganda Poster in Afghanistan with Image of Osama bin Laden 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 720\nOsama bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals in 2011.\nUS Department of Defense \u2013 public domain.\nFighting between Western forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan continued to provide the exiled bin Laden a\nplatform to promote his al-Qaeda terrorist activities from his hiding place. Efforts to locate and marginalize bin\nLaden continued through to the US presidency of Barack Obama. In May of 2011, on orders from President\nObama, a team of US Navy Seals were sent into the city of Abottabad, Pakistan, to a private compound where\nintelligence indicated that bin Laden was hiding. In the confrontation, the US Navy Seal team killed bin Laden.\nThe entire operation was conducted without the awareness of the Pakistani government. This event may have\nimpacted al-Qaeda but has not likely diminished the fighting in Afghanistan. 721 World Regional Geography\nThe country is the world\u2019s largest producer of opium, a product extracted from a poppy plant seedpod that can\nalso be refined into heroin. The expanding poppy cultivation as well as a growing drug trade may account for one-\nthird of the country\u2019s income. More than 80 percent of the heroin consumed in Europe is grown in Afghanistan.\nThe drug trade has only multiplied the problems in this devastated country. Prudent and effective methods for\nthe government to address the drug trade are matters for debate and negotiation. Most of the country is ruled by\nwarlords and clan leaders who have few resources other than tradition and custom. Afghanistan\u2019s infrastructure\nhas been destroyed through warfare, and its government is dependent on foreign aid; without it, this country\ncannot recover to integrate itself with the global economy. Central Asia has enormous oil and natural gas reserves,\nand the core economic regions of the world will continue their work to extract these resources for economic gain.\nOperation Enduring Freedom\nThe US Department of Defense issued an official statement on Afghanistan in 2008 (Source DoD 2008):\nIn response to the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. and its allies launched an invasion of Afghanistan\nto overthrow the Taliban regime and destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist network it supported. In the years since, the\nInternational Security Assistance Force, under NATO leadership, has taken charge of extensive provincial\nreconstruction and stabilization efforts, helping set the economic, political and security conditions for the growth of\nan effective, democratic national government in Afghanistan. As the lead member of the international coalition, the\nU.S. contributes troops to both the ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] mission and Operation Enduring\nFreedom, tasked with pursuing al-Qaeda throughout Afghanistan\u2019s inhospitable border region with Pakistan.\nThe Western military troops aligned themselves with Afghan groups such as the Northern Alliance to defeat the\nTaliban and remove the al-Qaeda presence. 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 722\nFigure 8.69 Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan\nCompeting groups and the rough terrain make keeping the peace in Afghanistan difficult.

This\nphoto indicates that women were also allowed to vote in Afghanistan in the 2005 elections for provincial councils and parliamentary positions.\nUS Department of Defense \u2013 public domain.\nDemocratic elections were held for the office of president in Afghanistan beginning in October of 2004. Hamid Karzai\nwas the country\u2019s first elected president in the twentieth century. He was reelected as president in 2009 under the cloud\nof claims of election fraud. The right to vote was restored to women in the 2004 election. To combat voter fraud, people\nwould dip their fingers in ink to indicate they had voted and to ensure they did not vote more than once. Voting has not\nbeen a smooth process because democratic rule is new to Afghanistan. Afghanistan\u2019s future is insecure. Most of\nAfghanistan is still ruled by warlords and clan leaders. The Taliban has sustained its support in Afghanistan from bases\non the Pakistani side of the border, and United Nations (UN) and NATO troops continue to confront the Taliban and 725 World Regional Geography\nwork toward stability. Kandahar, the second-largest city in Afghanistan, is located in the south, an area where support\nfor the Taliban is stronger than it is in Kabul in the north.\nResources and Globalization\nIn 2010, a US government report indicated that vast amounts of mineral wealth were discovered in Afghanistan by\nAmerican geologists and Pentagon officials. Enormous deposits of iron, copper, gold, cobalt, and rare industrial\nminerals such as lithium are reported to be present in Afghanistan. Total reserves are unknown or have not been\nreleased but if extracted would result in trillions of dollars of economic gain for the country. Lithium is highly\nsought after and is used in the manufacturing of batteries, computers, and electronic devices. The report indicated\nthat Afghanistan could become the world\u2019s premier mining country.\nFigure 8.71 Vastness of Afghanistan 8.7 Central Asia and Afghanistan 726\nIn this photo is the Lataband Road between Kabul and Surobi. The dry, treeless expanse of this region is home to Afghanistan\u2019s vast\nmineral wealth.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 4.0.\nDiscovery of vast resources helps place the war in Afghanistan in perspective with respect to global competition\nover the control of resources. It has been reported that China has already offered millions of dollars in incentive\nmoney to Afghan government officials to allow its country to mine copper. Bribery and corruption in the Afghan\ngovernment is a serious impediment to a stable political environment, but criminal activities are projected to\npersist and swell with the potential for additional mining wealth. Afghanistan does not have a long-standing\ntradition of mining. Agriculture has been the main focus of economic activity for the rural communities. A\nnewfound potential for mineral wealth will change the future of Afghanistan. It will be interesting to watch how\nAfghanistan adapts to and benefits from the discovery of previously unknown resources.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Central Asia is a landlocked region that receives little rainfall. Two large desert regions are located at the\nregion\u2019s core. Vast grasslands called steppes dominate the northern sector. High mountains to the east\nprovide a border between Central Asia and China.\n\u2022 Central Asia (a.k.a. Turkestan) has been dominated by the Soviet Union during the twentieth century. The\ntransition to independence has challenged the region to adjust to changes in political and economic systems.\n\u2022 The demise of the Aral Sea is being caused by the diversion of water from the two rivers flowing into the\nsea. A once-thriving fishing industry has been destroyed and environmental damage has been catastrophic.\n\u2022 Armed conflicts in Afghanistan continue between Western military forces and the Taliban over the control 727 World Regional Geography\nof the country. Clan leaders are a main component of the political fabric of the country. The diversity and\nfragmentation of the country make it almost impossible to govern.\n\u2022 Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world based on data on standards of living. However, the\ncountry has one of the largest deposits of valuable minerals and ores in the world waiting to be extracted.\nThe deposits are the target of multinational corporations around the globe.\n\u2022 The following is a summary of trends in Central Asia:\n\u25e6 Shift from Soviet Union to independent states\n\u25e6 Rise in authoritarian governments and corruption\n\u25e6 Increase of cultural influence of Islamic institutions\n\u25e6 Global economic focus on extractive activities\n\u25e6 Increase in military activity over control of resources\n\u25e6 Decline in agriculture as an economic base\n\u25e6 Continued concern for environmental problems\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Large, expansive deserts make up most of the physical areas of all three regions of the realm.\nWater is of particular importance, as most of the population has traditionally made a living from agriculture.\nDivision, warfare, and conflict have been constant elements. The Arab Spring of 2011 included a wave of\nmass citizen demonstrations in many Arab countries where the people demanded political and economic\nreform.\n\u2022 The three main monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam emerged from the Middle East\nand can be traced back to a common patriarch, Abraham. Most of the people in the realm are Muslims. The\nFive Pillars of Islam create a guide for Muslims to live by. Mecca, the holiest city for Muslims worldwide, is\nwhere the prophet Muhammad started the religion. The two main divisions of Islam are Sunni (84 percent)\nand Shia (15 percent). Other smaller divisions exist, such as Sufi.\n\u2022 North Africa includes the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and Sudan on the Red Sea. Most of the\npeople in North Africa are Muslims. The high-population areas are along the coast or along the Nile River.\nThe Maghreb is included in the region with the Atlas Mountains in the west. The Atlas Mountains trap\nmoisture, which provides precipitation for agriculture in the mountain valleys. The countries of North Africa\nhave all witnessed political uprisings in which the people have demanded democratic reforms and increased\ncivil rights. Egypt is the most populous Arab country and the cornerstone of the Arab world.\n\u2022 The African Transition Zone is where the dry, arid conditions of the Sahara Desert meet the tropical\nconditions of Equatorial Africa. Islam is dominant in the north, and Christianity and tribal religions are\ndominant in the south. Sudan is one place where the two sides have clashed in warfare and division. Tribal\nChristian southern Sudan separated from the Arab Muslim north to create the independent country of South\nSudan. Ethnic cleansing has been witnessed in the western part of Sudan in the region of Darfur.\n\u2022 Palestine was divided in half in 1945 into an Arab state and a Jewish state. The Jewish state became the\nnation of Israel in 1948. Since that time, there has been a constant struggle between the mainly Arab\nPalestinians and the Jewish State of Israel. The West Bank and the Gaza Strip are Palestinian regions that\nhave worked to be recognized with equal sovereignty. The solution to this division is debated; both sides\nhave claims that are incompatible with each other. The neighboring Arab states of Jordan, Syria, and\nLebanon have their own unique political situations.\n729 8.8 End-of-Chapter Material 730\n\u2022 The Arabian Peninsula includes a number of states ruled by a single king, sultan, emir, or sheik, except\nYemen, which has a democratically elected president. Saudi Arabia is the home of the two main cities of\nIslam, Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia is the largest country on the peninsula and has about 25 percent of\nall the known oil reserves in the world. Oil and natural gas are the main export products and the main source\nof income for the region. Yemen is mainly an agricultural country with high population growth and a rural\nmajority.\n\u2022 Most people in Turkey are of Turkish ethnicity, and most people in Iran are of Persian ethnicity. The country\nof Turkey is what remains from the once expansive Ottoman Empire. Iran is a country of mountains and\ndeserts that was once the center of the Persian Empire. Turkey has a portion of its country in Europe, and its\nlargest part includes the expansive Anatolian Plateau in Asia. Turkey is a democratic republic with elected\npublic officials. Iran is a religious state in which the Islamic leadership controls who can be included in the\ngovernment. Both countries have large populations of about seventy million each.\n\u2022 Iraq was at the center of the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia, which spawned early human civilizations.\nIraq was invaded by the United States in 2003 and has been working to establish a democratic government.\nThe country is divided between a Shia majority and a Sunni minority. It is an Arab country with a large\nminority group of Kurds in the north. Iraq has enormous oil reserves that have not yet been developed for\nexploitation, which has attracted the attention of the world\u2019s energy-dependent core regions.\n\u2022 Central Asia (Turkestan) is a landlocked region with mainly type B climates with cooler temperatures in the\nhigher elevations of the eastern mountains. The prominently Muslim region has been transitioning from a\nSoviet-controlled domain to independent states. Some countries are making the transition with less difficulty\nthan others. The Aral Sea has been one of the major environmental disasters in modern history.\nGlobalization activities have targeted the region for its immense amount of natural resources\u2014mainly oil,\nnatural gas, and minerals.\n\u2022 Afghanistan has been conquered by many empires and was a buffer state between British and Russian\ncolonial efforts. The country has a dry, rugged terrain and a devastated economy. The people are poor with\nlittle infrastructure. The many tribal groups have made it difficult for a centralized government to be\neffective. The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to remove al-Qaeda training camps run by Osama\nbin Laden. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces have taken over the mission in Afghanistan to\ndefeat the Taliban extremists and support stability for the country. Afghanistan has enormous amounts of\nmineral resources that are in high demand by the world\u2019s core industrial regions. Chapter 9: South Asia\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nOf the world\u2019s seven continents, Asia is the largest. Its physical landscapes, political units, and ethnic groups are\nboth wide-ranging and many. Besides Russia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia, which have been addressed in\nprevious lessons, Asian regions include South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.\nSouth Asia extends south from the main part of the continent to the Indian Ocean. The principal boundaries of\nSouth Asia are the Indian Ocean, the Himalayas, and Afghanistan. The Arabian Sea borders Pakistan and India\nto the west, and the Bay of Bengal borders India and Bangladesh to the east. The western boundary is the desert\nregion where Pakistan shares a border with Iran.\nThe realm was the birthplace of two of the world\u2019s great religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, but there are also\nimmense Muslim populations and large groups of followers of various other religions as well. Hinduism, Islam,\nand Buddhism are the top three religions of South Asia. While Pakistan and Iran are both Islamic republics, each\nrepresents a significant branch of that faith; Iran is predominantly Shia, and Pakistan is mostly Sunni. Religious\ndifferences are also evident on the eastern border of the realm, where Bangladesh and India share a border with\nMyanmar. Bangladesh is mainly a Muslim country, while most in India align themselves with Hinduism. In\nMyanmar, most follow Buddhist traditions. In addition, Sikhism is a major religion in the Punjab region, which is\nlocated on India\u2019s northern border with Pakistan.\nFigure 9.1 Main Features of South Asia\n731 Chapter 9: South Asia 732\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe countries of South Asia include Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and the Maldives.\nThe Himalayas, separating South Asia from East Asia along the border of China\u2019s autonomous region of Tibet,\nare the highest mountains in the world and the dominant physical feature of the northern rim of South Asia. Other\ncountries that share the Himalayas include Nepal, Bhutan, India, and Pakistan. Farther north along the Himalayan\nrange, the traditional region of Kashmir is divided between India, Pakistan, and China. On the opposite side of\nthe Himalayas are two island countries off the coast of southern India. The first is Sri Lanka, a large tropical island\noff India\u2019s southeast coast, and the other is the Republic of Maldives, an archipelago (group of islands) off the\nsouthwest coast of India. Maldives comprises almost 1,200 islands that barely rise above sea level; the highest\nelevation is merely seven feet, seven inches. Only about two hundred islands in the Maldives are inhabited. 733 World Regional Geography\nThe balancing of natural capital and population growth is and will remain a primary issue in the realm\u2019s future.\nSouth Asia is highly populated, with about one-and-a-half billion people representing a wide range of ethnic and\ncultural groups. The diverse population has been brought together into political units that have roots in the realm\u2019s\ncolonial past, primarily under Great Britain. British colonialism had a significant impact on the realm; its long-\nterm effects include political divisions and conflicts in places such as Kashmir and Sri Lanka.\nCurrent globalizing forces are compelling South Asian countries to establish a trade network and institute\neconomic policies among themselves. South Asia is not one of the three main economic core areas of the world;\nhowever, it is emerging to compete in the world marketplace. Some would call India a part of the semiperiphery,\nwhich means it is not actually in the core or in the periphery but displays qualities of both. All the same, India\nremains the dominant country of South Asia and shares either a physical boundary or a marine boundary with all\nthe other countries in the realm.\nAll countries north of Afghanistan were once part of the former Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the\nSouth Asian countries were in the shadow of the superpowers and had to engage in diplomacy to balance their\nrelationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Communist China is an emerging economic power\nand has used Tibet as a buffer state with its rival, India. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has been\nworking to reestablish itself in the global economy. Like India, Russia portrays qualities of the semiperiphery.\nThe United States has had a major impact on the affairs of the South Asian realm, even though it is physically\nlocated on the other side of the world. The United States has been at war in neighboring Afghanistan since 2001\nand has also been a major economic trading partner with the countries of South Asia. Complicating the situation,\nthe United States has developed an extensive trade relationship with neighboring China. Economic advancements\nand global trade have catapulted the countries of South Asia onto the world stage. 9.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Summarize the realm\u2019s physical geography. Identify each country\u2019s main features and physical attributes\nand locate the realm\u2019s main river systems.\n2. Understand the dynamics of the monsoon and how it affects human activities.\n3. Outline the early civilizations of South Asia and learn how they gave rise to the early human development\npatterns that have shaped the realm.\n4. Describe how European colonialism impacted the realm.\n5. Learn about the basic demographic trends the realm is experiencing. Understand how rapid population\ngrowth is a primary concern for the countries of South Asia.\nThe Physical Geography\nThe landmass of South Asia was formed by the Indian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate. This action started\nabout seventy million years ago and gave rise to the highest mountain ranges in the world. Most of the South Asian\nlandmass is formed from the land in the original Indian Plate. Pressure from tectonic action against the plates\ncauses the Himalayas to rise in elevation by as much as one to five millimeters per year. Destructive earthquakes\nand tremors are frequent in this seismically active realm. The great size of the Himalayas has intensely influenced\nthe beliefs and traditions of the people in the realm. Some of the mountains are considered sacred to certain\nreligions that exist here.\n734 735 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.2 Trekking Trail on the Way to Mt. Everest in the Himalayas of Northern Nepal\nMt. Everest is the world\u2019s highest peak at 29,035 feet. The Himalayas are the highest mountain chain in the world and create a natural\nborder between South Asia and China.\nSteve Hicks \u2013 The Himalayas sumed up in one picture! \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Himalayan Mountains dominate the physical landscape in the northern region of South Asia. Mt. Everest is\nthe tallest peak in the world, at 29,035 feet. Three key rivers cross South Asia, all originating from the Himalayas.\nThe Indus River, which has been a center of human civilization for thousands of years, starts in Tibet and flows\nthrough the center of Pakistan. The Ganges River flows through northern India, creating a core region of the\ncountry. The Brahmaputra River flows through Tibet and then enters India from the east, where it meets up with\nthe Ganges in Bangladesh to flow into the Bay of Bengal. While the northern part of this region includes some\nof the highest elevations in the world, the Maldives in the south has some of the lowest elevations, some barely\nabove sea level. The coastal regions in southern Bangladesh also have low elevations. When the seasonal reversal\nof winds called the monsoon arrives every year, there is heavy flooding and its effect on the infrastructure of the\nregion is disastrous. The extensive Thar Desert in western India and parts of Pakistan, on the other hand, does\nnot receive monsoon rains. In fact, much of southwest Pakistan\u2014a region called Baluchistan\u2014is dry, with desert\nconditions.\nThe mountains on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan extend through Kashmir and then meet up with\nthe high ranges of the Himalayas. The Himalayas create a natural barrier between India and China, with the\nkingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan acting as buffer states with Tibet. Farther south along the east and west coasts\nof India are shorter mountain ranges called ghats. The Western Ghats reach as high as eight thousand feet, but\naverage around three thousand feet. These ghats are home to an extensive range of biodiversity. The Eastern\nGhats are not as high as the Western Ghats, but have similar physical qualities. The ghats provide a habitat for 9.1 Introducing the Realm 736\na wide range of animals and are also home to large coffee and tea estates. The Deccan Plateau lies between\nthe Eastern and Western Ghats. The Central Indian Plateau and the Chota-Nagpur Plateau are located in the\ncentral parts of India, north of the two Ghat ranges. The monsoon rains ensure that an average of about fifty-two\ninches of rain per year falls on the Chota-Nagpur Plateau, which has a tiger reserve and is also a refuge for Asian\nelephants.\nThe Monsoon\nA monsoon is a seasonal reversal of winds that is associated with heavy rains. The summer monsoon\nrains\u2014usually falling between June and September\u2014feed the rivers and streams of South Asia and provide the\nwater needed for agricultural production. In the summer, the continent heats up, with the Thar Desert fueling the\nsystem. The rising hot air creates a vacuum that pulls in warm moist air from the Bay of Bengal and the Indian\nOcean. This action shifts moisture-laden clouds over the land, where the water is precipitated out in the form of\nrain.\nFigure 9.3 The Monsoon System in South Asia 737 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons = public domain.\nThe monsoon rains bring moisture to South Asia right up to the Himalayas. As moisture-laden clouds rise in\nelevation in the mountains, the water vapor condenses in the form of rain or snow and feeds the streams and basins\nthat flow into the major rivers, such as the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus. The Western Ghats creates a similar\nsystem in the south along the west coast of India. Parts of Bangladesh and eastern India receive as much as six feet\nof rain during the monsoon season, and some areas experience severe flooding. The worst-hit places are along the\ncoast of the Bay of Bengal, such as in Bangladesh. There is less danger of flooding in western India and Pakistan,\nbecause by the time the rain clouds have moved across India they have lost their moisture. Desert conditions are\nevident in the west, near the Pakistan border in the great Thar Desert. On average, fewer than ten inches of rain\nfall per year in this massive desert. On the northern rim of the region, the height of the Himalayas restricts the\nwarm moist monsoon air from moving across the mountain range. The Himalayas act as a precipitation barrier\nand create a strong rain shadow effect for Tibet and Western China. The monsoon is responsible for much of the\nrainfall in South Asia.\nBy October, the system has run its course and the monsoon season is generally over. In the winter, the cold, dry 9.1 Introducing the Realm 738\nair above the Asian continent blows to the south, and the winter monsoon is characterized by cool, dry winds\ncoming from the north. South Asia experiences a dry season during the winter months. A similar pattern of rainy\nsummer season and dry winter season is found in other parts of the world, such as southern China and some of\nSoutheast Asia. A final note about the monsoons: small parts of South Asia, such as Sri Lanka and southeastern\nIndia, experience a rainy winter monsoon as well as a rainy summer monsoon. In their case, the winter monsoon\nwinds that come down from the north have a chance to pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal before depositing\nit on their shores.\nEarly Civilizations\nThe Indian subcontinent has a long history of human occupation, and is an area where cities independently\ndeveloped and civilization emerged. The earliest civilization on the subcontinent was the Indus Valley\nCivilization, in existence from about 3300 BCE to 1500 BCE. This Bronze Age civilization started as a series\nof small villages that became linked in a wider regional network. Urban centers developed into various religious\nand trade networks that spanned as far as Central Asia, Southwest Asia, and, perhaps, Egypt. The civilization is\nknown for its planned structures. The cities and villages of the urban phases were planned with major streets going\nnorth\/south and east\/west. It had a system of drains that channeled waste water outside the city. Additionally, this\ncivilization had a homogeneous material culture. Its artifacts of pottery and metallurgy all had a very similar style\nthat was spread over a vast land area, a fact that aided in the recognition of the expanse of the culture.\nInvasions by outsiders have the potential effect of bringing with them an influx of new ideas, concepts, and\ntechnology. Likewise, the Indus Valley Civilization no doubt had an impact on the region that it encompassed.\nLittle is known of the historical events of earlier times. Some of the evidence we rely on today to discern\nhistorical events is gleaned from language, religion, and ethnicity. Significant to South Asia is the presence of\nIndo-European languages. It is presumed that these languages were brought to the region by immigrants from the\nwest, where these languages were dominant. Aryans from Persia and other cultures might have diffused languages\nsuch as Hindi to South Asia, which later may have led to Hindi, for example, becoming the lingua franca of the\nregion.\nThe northern plains of South Asia, which extend through the Ganges River valley over to the Indus River valley of\npresent-day Pakistan, were fertile grounds for a number of empires that controlled the region throughout history.\nAfter the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, various phases of Iron Age traditions emerged. Most of this Iron\nAge culture is defined by the presence of iron metallurgy and distinctive characteristics of ceramics. 739 World Regional Geography\nThe Mauryan Empire existed between 322 and 185 BCE and was one of the most extensive and powerful\npolitical and military empires in ancient India. This empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE,\nwho began to extend his regime westward, easily conquering areas that had been disrupted by the expansion\nof Alexander the Great\u2019s armies. The Mauryan Empire was prosperous and greatly expanded the region\u2019s trade,\nagriculture, and economic activities. This empire created a single and efficient system of finance, administration,\nand security. One of the greatest emperors in the Mauryan dynasty was Ashoka the Great, who ruled over a long\nperiod of peace and prosperity. Ashoka embraced Buddhism and focused on peace for much of his rule. He created\nhospitals and schools and renovated major road systems throughout the empire. His advancement of Buddhist\nideals is credited with being the reason most of the population on the island of Sri Lanka is Buddhist to this day.\nIslam became a powerful force in South Asia upon its diffusion to the subcontinent. Muslim dynasties or\nkingdoms that ruled India between 1206 and 1526 are referred to collectively as the Delhi Sultanate. The Delhi\nSultanate ended in 1526 when it was absorbed into the expanding Mughal Empire. The Islamic Mughal Empire\nruled over much of northern and central India from the 1500s to about the middle of the nineteenth century.\nAfter 1725, it began to decline rapidly because of a combination of factors, with European colonialism adding\nthe finishing touch. The Mughal Empire had been religiously tolerant but Muslim oriented. The classic period of\nthis empire began in 1556 and ended in 1707. Many of the monuments we associate with India, including the Taj\nMahal, the Red Fort in Lahore, and the Agra Fort, were built during the classical period.\nColonialism in South Asia\nThe force of colonialism was felt around the world, including in South Asia. South Asia provides an excellent\nexample of colonialism\u2019s role in establishing most of the current political borders in the world. From the sixteenth\ncentury onward, ships from colonial Europe began to arrive in South Asia to conduct trade. The British East India\nCompany was chartered in 1600 to trade in Asia and India. They traded in spices, silk, cotton, and other goods.\nLater, to take advantage of conflicts and bitter rivalries between kingdoms, European powers began to establish\ncolonies. Britain controlled South Asia from 1857 to 1947. 9.1 Introducing the Realm 740\nFigure 9.4\nBritish colonialism in South Asia began in 1857 and lasted until 1947.\nGoa is the smallest state in modern-day India. In the sixteenth century, it was first encountered by Portuguese\ntraders, who annexed it shortly after arriving. Goa was a colony of Portugal for the next 450 years. By the\nmid-1800s, most of the population of the tiny area had been forcibly converted to Christianity. Many of the\nHindu traditions, however, survived in the region. Hindu holidays are celebrated among the expatriate community\nin India. Christian holidays are also celebrated, especially Christmas and Easter. The cathedrals and secular\narchitecture in many of the historic buildings of Goa are European in style, reflecting its Portuguese origins. This\narchitecture is locally termed \u201cIndo-Portuguese.\u201d Goa was one of the longest-held colonial possessions in the\nworld. It was finally annexed to India in 1961.\nThe British no longer controlled South Asia after 1947. Local resistance and the devastating effects of World\nWar II meant the British Empire could not be controlled as it once was. Great Britain pulled away from empire\nbuilding to focus on its own redevelopment. Upon the British withdrawal from India, Britain realized the immense\ncultural differences between the Muslims and Hindus and created political boundaries based on those differences.\nWest Pakistan was carved out of western India; East Pakistan was carved from eastern India. However, the new\nborders separating Hindu and Muslim majorities ran through population groups, and some of the population now\nfound itself to be on the wrong side of the border. The West Pakistan-India partition grew into a tragic civil war,\nas Hindus and Muslims struggled to migrate to their country of choice. More than one million people died in the\ncivil war, a war that is still referred to in today\u2019s political dialogue between Pakistan and India. The Sikhs, who\nare indigenous to the Punjab region in the middle, also suffered greatly. Some people decided not to migrate,\nwhich explains why India has the largest Muslim population of any non-Muslim state. 741 World Regional Geography\nAnother civil war would erupt in 1973 between West Pakistan and East Pakistan. When the states were first\ncreated in 1947, they operated under the same government despite having no common border and being over nine\nhundred miles apart and populated by people with no ethnic similarities. The civil war lasted about three months\nand resulted in the creation of the sovereign countries of Pakistan and Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). The\nname Bangladesh is based on the Bengali ethnicity of most of the people who live there. Both Pakistan and\nBangladesh are among the top ten most populous countries in the world.\nLanguage is probably one of the more pervasive ways that Europeans affected South Asia. In modern-day India\nand Pakistan, English is the language of choice in secondary education (English-medium schools). It is often\nthe language used by the government and military. Unlike many other Asian countries, much of the signage and\nadvertising in Pakistan and India is in English, even in rural areas. Educated people switch back and forth, using\nEnglish words or entire English sentences during conversation in their native tongue. Some scholars have termed\nthis Hinglish or Urglish as the base languages of northern India and Pakistan are Hindi and Urdu, respectively.\nThe British game of cricket is an important cultural and national sport within this Asian subcontinent. The\nconstant conflict between the nations of India and Pakistan are reflected in the intense rivalry between their\nnational cricket teams. The Cricket World Cup is held every four years and is awarded by the International Cricket\nCouncil. South Asian countries have won the Cricket World Cup three times: India (1983), Pakistan (1992), and\nSri Lanka (1996).\nPopulation in South Asia\nSouth Asia has three of the ten most populous countries in the world. India is the second largest in the world, and\nPakistan and Bangladesh are numbers five and six, respectively. Large populations are a product of large family\nsizes and a high fertility rate. The rural population of South Asia has traditionally had large families. Religious\ntraditions do not necessarily support anything other than a high fertility rate. On the other hand, the least densely\npopulated country in South Asia is the Kingdom of Bhutan. Bhutan has a population density of only fifty people\nper square mile. Bhutan is mountainous with little arable land. More than a third of the people in Bhutan live in\nan urban setting. Population overgrowth for the realm is a serious concern. An increase in population requires\nadditional natural resources, energy, and food production, all of which are in short supply in many areas. 9.1 Introducing the Realm 742\nTable 9.1 Demographics of South Asia and the World\u2019s Most Populous Countries\nGross\ndomestic\nTotal Population Doubling\nCountry Population Physiologic Fertility Percentage product\nRank population growth time in\nname in millions density density rate rate (%) years\u2020 urban per\ncapita\n($)\n1 China 1,336 361 2,405 1.54 0.49 143 47 7,600\n2 India* 1,189 937 1,912 2.62 1.34 52 30 3,500\n3 United States 313 84 468 2.06 0.96 73 82 47,200\n4 Indonesia 245 331 3,013 2.25 1.07 65 44 4,200\n5 Brazil 203 62 884 2.18 1.13 62 87 10,800\n6 Pakistan* 187 604 2,414 3.17 1.57 45 36 2,500\n7 Bangladesh* 158 2,852 5,186 2.60 1.57 45 28 1,700\n8 Nigeria 155 435 1,319 4.73 1.94 36 50 2,500\n9 Russia 138 21 301 1.42 \u22120.47 73 15,900\n10 Japan 126 867 7,225 1.21 \u22120.28 67 34,000\n11 Mexico 113 149 1,149 2.29 1.10 64 78 13,900\n41 Nepal* 29 525 3,379 2.47 1.59 44 19 1,200\n57 Sri Lanka* 21 862 6,001 2.2 0.93 75 14 5,000\n165 Bhutan* 0.700 50 1,697 2.2 1.2 58 35 5,500\n176 Maldives* 0.400 3,438 26,194 1.81 \u22120.15 40 6,900\n* Countries noted with an asterisk are part of South Asia\n\u2020 Empty cell indicates a negative population doubling time.\nSource: CIA World Factbook, June 2011, accessed September 13, 2011, https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/publications\/the-world-factbook\/geos\/\nxx.html.\nSouth Asia\u2019s growing population has placed exceedingly high demands on agricultural production. The amount\nof area available for food production divided by the population may be a more helpful indicator of population\ndistribution than total population density. For example, large portions of Pakistan are deserts and mountains that\ndo not provide arable land for food production. India has the Thar Desert and the northern mountains. Nepal has\nthe Himalayas. The small country of the Maldives, with its many islands, has almost no arable land. The number\nof people per square mile of arable land, which is called the physiologic density, can be an important indicator of\na country\u2019s status. Total population densities are high in South Asia, but the physiologic densities are even more\nastounding. In Bangladesh, for example, more than five thousand people depend on every square mile of arable\nland. In Sri Lanka the physiologic density reaches to more than 6,000 people per square mile, and in Pakistan it is 743 World Regional Geography\nmore than 2,400. The data are averages, which indicate that the population density in the fertile river valleys and\nthe agricultural lowlands might be even higher.\nFigure 9.5 Crowded Street in New Delhi, India\nUrban areas of South Asia are expanding rapidly.\nJohn Halsam \u2013 IMG_3555 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe population of South Asia is relatively young. In Pakistan about 35 percent of the population is under the age\nof fifteen, while about 30 percent of India\u2019s almost 1.2 billion people are under the age of fifteen. Many of these\nyoung people live in rural areas, as most of the people of South Asia work in agriculture and live a subsistence\nlifestyle. As the population increases, the cities are swelling to accompany the growth in the urban population and\nthe large influx of migrants arriving from rural areas. Rural-to-urban shift is extremely high in South Asia and\nwill continue to fuel the expansion of the urban centers into some of the largest cities on the planet. The rural-\nto-urban shift that is occurring in South Asia also coincides with an increase in the region\u2019s interaction with the\nglobal economy. 9.1 Introducing the Realm 744\nThe South Asian countries are transitioning through the five stages of the index of economic development. The\nmore rural agricultural regions are in the lower stages of the index. The realm experienced rapid population\ngrowth during the latter half of the twentieth century. As death rates declined and family size remained high, the\npopulation swiftly increased. India, for example, grew from fewer than four hundred million in 1950 to more than\none billion at the turn of the century. The more urbanized areas are transitioning into stage 3 of the index and\nexperiencing significant rural-to-urban shift. Large cities such as Mumbai (Bombay) have sectors that are in the\nlatter stages of the index because of their urbanized work force and higher incomes. Family size is decreasing in\nthe more urbanized areas and in the realm as a whole, and demographers predict that eventually the population\nwill stabilize.\nFigure 9.6 Population Growth in India\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nAt the current rates of population growth, the population of South Asia will double in about fifty years. Doubling\nthe population of Bangladesh would be the equivalent of having the entire 2011 population of the United States\n(more than 313 million people) all living within the borders of the US state of Wisconsin. The general rule of\ncalculating doubling time for a population is to take the number seventy and divide it by the population growth\nrate. For Bangladesh the doubling time would be 70 \u00f7 1.57 = 45 years. The doubling time for a population can\nhelp determine the economic prospects of a country or region. South Asia is coming under an increased burden\nof population growth. If India continues at its current rate of population increase, it will double its population in\nfifty-two years, to approximately 2.4 billion. Because the region\u2019s rate of growth has been gradually in decline, 745 World Regional Geography\nthis doubling time is unlikely. However, without continued attention to how the societies address family planning\nand birth control, South Asia will likely face serious resource shortages in the future.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 All the South Asian countries border India by either a physical or a marine boundary. The Himalayas form a\nnatural boundary between South Asia and East Asia (China). The realm is surrounded by deserts, the Indian\nOcean, and the high Himalayan ranges.\n\u2022 The summer monsoon arrives in South Asia in late May or early June and subsides by early October. The\nrains that accompany the monsoon account for most of the rainfall for South Asia. Water is a primary\nresource, and the larger river systems are home to large populations.\n\u2022 The Indus River Valley was a location of early human civilization. The large empires of the realm gave way\nto European colonialism. The British dominated the realm for ninety years from 1857 to 1947 and\nestablished the main boundaries of the realm.\n\u2022 Population growth is a major concern for South Asia. The already enormous populations of South Asia\ncontinue to increase, challenging the economic systems and depleting natural resources at an unsustainable\nrate.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Outline how and why Kashmir is divided and its importance for the region.\n4. Describe how tourism has been a means of gaining wealth for the listed countries.\n5. Summarize the main environmental concerns that are apparent in each of the countries.\nAs detailed earlier, the Indian subcontinent is a large landmass that juts into the Indian Ocean along the southern\nside of Asia, between Afghanistan and Myanmar (Burma) and south of China. The Indian perimeter includes the\nsouthern countries of the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and the northern regions of the Punjab, Kashmir, Nepal, and\nBhutan. This landmass has a long tectonic history and has been formed by the collision of the Indian Tectonic\nPlate with the Eurasian Plate. This tectonic collision has given rise to the highest mountain chains and ranges in\nthe world along the northern and northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent\u2014that is, the Himalayas.\nThe Karakoram Mountains are located in northern Pakistan and Kashmir. Together with the other Himalayan\nMountain ranges, they form an arc that stretches across the entire northern border of South Asia. Nepal and Bhutan\nare both located in the Himalayas. The Himalayan ranges have some of the highest peaks in the region, including\nMount Everest (located on the border between Nepal and China) and K2 (located in Pakistan). In western Pakistan\nand western Afghanistan, the Hindu Kush mountain ranges that border this area are found. The Indus River flows\nfrom the northern part of the Karakoram mountains and creates a large, fertile flood plain. Along its northern area,\nthe Indus River System has four main tributaries. Together, these rivers constitute the five rivers of the Punjab\nregions of Pakistan and India; Punjab means the \u201cland of the five rivers\u201d in the Punjabi language.\n747 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 748\nThe Punjab\nThe Punjab is a fertile agricultural region with a high population density located on the border between India and\nPakistan. Areas of the Punjab lie in both India and Pakistan. Where there is ample fresh water and bountiful food\nproduction, there is usually high population density. The Punjab is the most densely populated region in Pakistan.\nIndia has a separate state called the Punjab. Its river valleys are excellent areas for agricultural production and\ncontribute heavily to the provisions needed to feed the enormous populations of the two countries.\nThe Punjabi people are found in the Punjab State of India and the Punjab Province of Pakistan. This large cultural\narea was separated into two countries during Partition at the time of Indian independence and the creation of\nPakistan in 1947. Most of the people in the Punjab speak Punjabi, an Indo-European language. In a larger context,\npeople with Punjabi background are considered one of the main ethnic groups in South Asia. Punjabis account for\nabout 45 percent of the population of Pakistan.\nIn Pakistan, the Punjabis are grouped in clans and groups that correspond with traditional occupations.\nTraditionally, Punjabis are farmers and warriors, and in modern times are associated with agricultural professions\nand military life. Punjabis in Pakistan are predominantly Muslim, although a Christian minority exists. Indian\nPunjabis belong to traditional groups, including many of the same groups as in Pakistan, but many more. Most of\nthe Muslim populations of the Punjab migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and, thus, most of the Indian Punjabis are Sikh\nwith a Christian minority.\nFigure 9.7 749 World Regional Geography\nSikhs protest against India\u2019s opposition to their proposed homeland (nation-\nstate) in the Punjab called Khalistan.\nPeople gravitate toward nation-state systems, but globalization supports\nintegration across political boundaries.\nElliot Brown \u2013 Remembering the Sikh Genocide \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe Punjab region of Pakistan and India is the homeland of the Sikhs, people who follow a religion that is different\nfrom Islam or Hinduism. Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak Dev (1469\u20131538). All distinctions of caste, creed,\nrace, or gender are rejected in this religion. In Sikhism there is no priestly class. Every person is equally and\nfully responsible for leading a moral life, which eventually leads to universal salvation. Heaven and hell are not\nphysical places, and God is the cosmic universal spirit. Historically, traditional Sikh men wear turbans on their\nheads and never cut their hair or beard. Sikhism is a universal religion. A prominent Sikh landmark and spiritual\ncenter is their Golden Temple, located in the city of Amritsar in the Indian state of the Punjab.\nSikhism is a system of religious philosophy and expression, known as the Gurmat or the counsel of the gurus,\nor the Sikh Dharma (or way of life). Sikhism comes from the Hindi and Punjabi word sikhna, which means \u201cto\nlearn.\u201d The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in the universal God. Sikhism promotes the pursuit of salvation\nthrough discipline and personal meditation on the name and message of God. However, it must be mentioned that\nSikhs have a nonanthropomorphic concept of God; that is, Sikhs do not envision God as having any form or shape\nor mind similar to that of humans. Sikhism has become the fifth-most widely adhered to religion on Earth.\nDuring British colonial occupation of South Asia, Sikhs were elevated to positions of power to help the British\nrule over Muslim and Hindu populations. The Sikhs are often overshadowed by the large Hindu and Muslim\npopulations in the realm. Many of the Sikhs would like to have their own nation-state, free from Muslim or\nHindu domination, and would like to see the Punjab region become the new homeland for this nation-state,\ncalled Khalistan. They have held rallies and demonstrations to promote the creation of Khalistan. The Indian\ngovernment has, however, cracked down on militant movements that support the Khalistan concept. The Khalistan\nmovement was more popular in the 1970s and 1980s and has been scaled down in recent decades. Proponents\nstill attempt to attract young people and foreign donations to its cause. Khalistan does not have the support of the\nPakistani and Indian governments and is not likely to become a reality any time soon. Khalistan is an example of\nthe devolutionary push for a nation-state political unit for a particular group of people with similar aspirations or\nheritage. 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 750\nThe Kingdom of Kashmir\nLocated in the high mountains of the north is the former Kingdom of Kashmir, a separate kingdom before the\nBritish divided South Asia. In 1947, when the British drew the boundary between India and Pakistan, the leader\nof Kashmir, the maharajah, chose not to be a part of either country but to remain independent. About 75 percent of\nthe population in Kashmir was Muslim; the rest, including the maharajah, were mainly Hindu. This arrangement\nworked for a time, until the Muslim majority was encouraged by their fellow Muslims in Pakistan to join Pakistan.\nAfter a Muslim uprising, the maharajah asked the Indian military for assistance. India was more than pleased to\noblige and saw it as an opportunity to oppose Pakistan one more time. Today Kashmir is divided, with Pakistan\ncontrolling the northern region, India controlling the southern region, and China controlling a portion of the\neastern region. A cease-fire has been implemented, but outbreaks of fighting have occurred. The future of Kashmir\nis unclear. None of the countries involved wants to start a large-scale war, because they all have nuclear weapons.\nFigure 9.8 The Issues with Kashmir 751 World Regional Geography\nPakistan controls the northern areas, India controls Jammu and Kashmir, and China controls the eastern portion, labeled Aksai Chin\non this map. All three countries have nuclear weapons, and it seems apparent that none of the countries wants to start a nuclear war.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe conflict in Kashmir is about strategic location and control of water rather than labor and resources. It is\nunknown whether there are abundant minerals in the mountains in Kashmir to be mined, but regardless, there\nis little mining activity going on, not enough to cause conflict. One of the main physical geography features of\nimportance is water. The Indus River flows through Kashmir from Tibet and into Pakistan. The control of this\nriver system is critical to the survival of people living in northern Pakistan. If India were to place a dam on the\nriver and divert the water to their side of the border, to the dry regions of the south, Pakistan could suffer a water\nshortage in the northern part of the country. Another aspect of the Kashmir conflict goes back to the division of\nPakistan and India, which pitted Muslims against Hindus along the border region. The religious differences have\ncome to the surface again in the conflict over the control of Kashmir. Extremist movements within Kashmir by the\nMuslim population have fueled the division between those who support Pakistan and those who support Hindu-\ndominated India.\nThe Kingdom of Bhutan\nLandlocked and mountainous, the small Kingdom of Bhutan is remotely located next to the high Himalayas\nbetween China and India. The mountain peaks reach more than twenty-three thousand feet. Bhutan is about\nhalf the size in physical area of the US state of Kentucky and has fewer than one million people. The southern\nplains are warm, with subtropical weather, but the higher altitudes of the snow-capped mountains have polar-type\nclimates. The local people call their country the \u201cLand of the Thunder Dragon\u201d because of the harsh storms they\nexperience. Bhutan has large areas of natural habitat that have not been disturbed by human activity. The natural\nenvironment and the unique heritage and culture of the people make Bhutan an attractive destination for world\ntravelers.\nBhutan is a small country without much industry or high-tech corporate involvement. Forestry and agriculture\nare the main economic activities, which account for approximately 60 percent of the country\u2019s population.\nGrazing livestock and subsistence agriculture are the primary types of farming. Increasing the country\u2019s modest\ninfrastructure is hampered by its high mountains and remote location. India is Bhutan\u2019s main trading partner and\nhas played an important role in the country\u2019s development and economic situation. 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 752\nFigure 9.9 Bhutan\u2019s Famous Taktshang Buddhist Monastery, Commonly Known as the Tiger\u2019s Nest\nThe unique landscapes and cultural experience that Bhutan offers to travelers have promoted tourism as an increasing economic\nactivity.\nAvinash singh \u2013 taktsand \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nModern transportation and communication technologies are being introduced in Bhutan and are changing how\nthe country is connected to the rest of the global economy. Satellite and cable television, mobile phone networks,\nthe Internet, and major airline service are opening the doors of opportunity and interaction between the people\nof Bhutan and the rest of the world. Introduction of technological services has prompted Bhutan\u2019s government\nto take steps to protect its environment and unique heritage. Tourism has become a major focus of the changes.\nThe country has stepped up its efforts to develop tourism but has targeted a specific type of traveler. Bhutan is an\nexpensive place to visit, which has been the biggest deterrent for travelers. Visitors from places other than India\nand Bangladesh must agree to strict requirements set by the suppliers of Bhutanese tourism, including large daily\nfees just to be in the country. Tourism is increasing in Bhutan but remains highly selective in its requirements\nand regulations. These measures are to ensure that the environmental health of the country remains intact and that\nthere is minimal cultural impact from outsiders.\nBuddhism is the state religion and is followed by about 75 percent of the population. Hinduism is the second-\nlargest religion and is followed by the other 25 percent of the population. One of the principles of the government\nin regulating development projects has been the concept of gross national happiness (GNH), which is used as\na guide to determine the impact of a project on the culture and people of Bhutan. The stern measures regarding\ndevelopment have protected the country from serious environmental degradation and have helped to sustain the\nlifestyles of the Bhutanese people. Some measures may appear harsh to outsiders, but the country is implementing\nthese measures to promote the health and well-being of its people. For example, tobacco products are banned from 753 World Regional Geography\nbeing sold in the country. Democratic elections are becoming standard after centuries of rule by a monarchy. The\nintent of the transition is to provide the people with more direct control of their government and country.\nInteresting points about the culture of Bhutan include the issue of marriage. Marriages based on love are becoming\nmore common in the cities, while arranged marriages remain a tradition in many of the smaller villages. Under\nthe current legal system, women have the right to inheritance. Homes and personal possessions are passed down\nthrough a family\u2019s female children. Traditionally, male children do not inherit. Men are expected to earn their own\nlivelihood and if they get married will most often live in the wife\u2019s house.\nArchery is the national sport of Bhutan. Most villages regularly hold archery competitions, which usually include\nfestivities of serving food and conducting community events.\nThe Kingdom of Nepal\nFigure 9.10 The Himalayan Mountains and the Tarai Lowlands of Nepal 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 754\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nBordering the highest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas, the country of Nepal is isolated from any\nseacoast and buffered from the outside world by India and China. Nepal is about the same size in physical area\nas Bangladesh, and is home to almost thirty million people. More than 80 percent of its people work the land in\na region that is suffering from severe deforestation and soil erosion. Trees are cut down to build houses, to cook\nfood, and to keep warm. Without trees to hold the soil, the monsoon rains wash soil from the mountain fields into\nthe valleys. The combination of the fast-growing population with the loss of food-growing capacity means it is\nonly a matter of time before a major crisis occurs in Nepal. Nepal\u2019s best farmland is in the Tarai lowlands of\nsouthern Nepal, while the north is quite mountainous. The towering elevation of the Himalayas restricts human\nhabitation in the north. High population growth has also been outstripping the country\u2019s economic growth rate in\nrecent years.\nNepal has an abundance of tourist attractions, Mt. Everest being its best known. In addition, there are hundreds\nof ancient temples and monasteries. Swift flowing streams and high-mountain terrain support a modest trekking\nindustry. Visitors to Nepal have an opportunity to glimpse a rich culture that few outsiders can witness. The\ndownside is that tourism demands an investment in infrastructure and services. Such investments direct funds\naway from schools, medical clinics, and public services needed by the Nepalese people. Income from tourism is\nneeded and always welcome, but the trade-off with investments is a difficult choice to make. Tourism in Nepal is\nnot as restrictive as that of Bhutan, and the unique physical and cultural landscapes will continue to draw travelers\nfrom throughout the world. 755 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.11 The Deforested Landscape of Nepal\nDeforestation is a serious problem. The trees are cut down for firewood and building materials. The winding road connects\nKathmandu with Tibet.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nHinduism is the main religion in Nepal, but a blend of Buddhism is more prevalent in the north. The guardian\ndeity of Nepal is Shiva. Pashupatinath Temple, the world\u2019s most significant Shiva worship site, is located in the\ncapital city of Kathmandu. This Shiva temple is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but a major destination\nfor Hindu pilgrims from around the world. Buddhist and Hindu beliefs often mix in Nepal. There are certain\nsituations where the same deities and temples can be honored or worshipped by members of both religions.\nIn a different part of Nepal, Lumbini\u2014near the city of Bhairahawa (Siddharthanagar), on the border with\nIndia\u2014is another UNESCO World Heritage Site, this one focusing on the birthplace of the Siddhartha Gautama,\nthe founder of Buddhism. Prince Siddhartha Gautama was born about 563 BCE, near Lumbini. The city has\nrecognized the prince with a number of monasteries and temples built in his honor. An entire development zone\nis restricted to nothing but monasteries and temples. No other commercial or public buildings\u2014such as hotels,\nshops, or businesses\u2014can be constructed in the zone. The different branches of the Buddhist faith each have their\nown specific designated sections of the zone. Lumbini is a major pilgrimage site for Buddhist believers from\naround the world.\nIn the late 1700s, local states of Nepal were consolidated into the one kingdom and ruled by monarchy. The\nkingdom was ruled by royal families until the mid-1900s. Nepal has been free of British influence since 1947, but\nhas had trouble establishing a stable central government. The royal family in charge of the kingdom was replaced\nin 1951, and further democratic reforms were made in 1990. Communist partisans from China have been active\nin insurgent activities. Frequent protests and civil unrest have caused political instability, which has discouraged\ntourism and has depressed the economy even further. The Maoist Communist movement and other opposition\npolitical parties held mass protests, culminating in a peace accord. Ensuing elections created the establishment 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 756\nof a federal democratic republic. The first president of Nepal was sworn into office in 2008. There is still much\ntension in the country between those loyal to the royal family and those wanting the royal family to be dissolved.\nWithout a stable government, economic and political progress in Nepal will be a serious challenge.\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka is a beautiful island about half the size of Nepal. The island has a warm, tropical type A climate,\nwith forested hills and mountains in the center. Rivers flow from the center outward to water the farm fields of\nrice and other crops. The best farmland in located in the Sinhalese-controlled areas of the southwestern portions\nof the island. Cinnamon is native to the island and has been cultivated since colonial times as an important\nexport. Coconuts, coffee, and tea are also important export products. The island is home to various national parks,\nfour biosphere reserves, and several wild elephant herds. Sri Lanka has the potential to become a major tourist\ndestination with high incomes and a hub for international trade. Factors working against Sri Lanka reaching its\npotential are not based on its physical geography or location, but rather they are linked back to colonialism and\ncultural or ethnic divisions between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority.\nThe people of South Asia follow various religions. Pakistan and Bangladesh are Muslim. India has a Hindu\nmajority. About 90 percent of the people of Nepal are considered Hindu but many follow a unique blend of Hindu\nand Buddhist beliefs. The small, mystical, mountainous kingdom of Bhutan is Buddhist. Sri Lanka has its own\nunique circumstances and is a mixed country with a strong Buddhist majority and an active Hindu minority. The\nconflict between the majority and the minority ethnic groups fueled a low-level civil war on the island for decades.\nDifferences in religion, ethnicity, and politics have brought the country to halt on various occasions. 757 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.12 Picking Tea in Sri Lanka\nTea, coffee, and cinnamon are export products of Sri Lanka.\nTallis Keeton \u2013 My mother\u2019s Sri Lanka 7 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nSinhalese people from somewhere in northern India moved to the island of Sri Lanka about 2,500 years ago. The\nSinhalese brought with them Buddhism and the Sinhala language, which belongs to the Indo-European language\nfamily. They established themselves on the island for centuries. Sri Lanka was first colonized by Portugal, then\nHolland. When the British colonized South Asia, they took control of Sri Lanka. It was called Ceylon at that time\nand changed its name to Sri Lanka in 1972. The higher elevations of the center of the island were excellent for tea\nproduction; British colonizers established tea plantations there. To work the plantations Britain brought thousands\nof additional Tamil laborers from southern India across the Polk Strait to Ceylon. Most of the Tamil speak a\nDravidian language and follow the Hindu religion.\nFigure 9.13 Claims of Tamil in Sri Lanka 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 758\nThe Tamil Tigers laid claim to a large portion of the eastern part of the island but did not control it. The only Tamil-controlled areas\nwere in the far north, including the Jaffna Peninsula and a small area around it.\nWhen the British were forced out of South Asia and left Ceylon, the Tamils remained on the island. The Tamils\nnow make up only 10 percent of the population and live mainly in the northeastern region of the island. They have\nbeen pressuring the Sinhalese majority to split the island politically and grant them independence. An insurgent\ncivil war was waged for decades between the Tamil guerillas\u2014called the Tamil Tigers\u2014and the Sinhalese\ngovernment. About sixty to eighty thousand people died in this conflict. Originally only controlling the Jaffna\nPeninsula, the Tamil Tigers later made claims on a large portion of the northeastern part of the island. The Tamil\nTigers created a government in the north called Eelam and wanted to legitimize it. The Sri Lankan president\nannounced an end to the civil war in 2009, and the Tigers admitted defeat at that time. This civil war devastated\nSri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry and discouraged foreign investments, further reducing economic opportunities for\nthe island. 759 World Regional Geography\nThe Maldives\nJust north of the Equator in the Indian Ocean to the southwest of India lie the Maldives, a group of low-lying\nislands that consists of twenty-six atolls encompassing a territory of only about 115 square miles. Within the atolls\nare approximately 1,200 small islands, of which about 200 are inhabited. Portugal controlled the Maldives from\n1558 during their colonial expansion into Asia. Holland took over from the Portuguese in 1654. The Maldives\nbecame a British protectorate in 1887, which lasted until 1965, when independence was achieved. Three years\nlater the country became a republic. The Maldives is a country with many extremes. It is Asia\u2019s smallest nation in\nboth physical area and population. The island nation has the smallest physical area of any country with a majority\nMuslim population. The average elevation\u2014four feet, eleven inches above sea level\u2014is the lowest in the world\nfor any country.\nFishing and tourism are the chief methods for Maldivians to earn a living. Tourism has increased in recent years.\nThe many islands and atolls are attractive destinations for world travelers. The first tourist resort opened in 1972.\nSince that time, dozens of world-class resort facilities have opened for business across the archipelago. Tourism is\nthe country\u2019s number one means of gaining wealth. The coral reefs that make up the island chain are excellent for\ndiving and water sports. The tropical climate and miles of sandy beaches provide for an attractive tourism agenda.\nThe Maldives is an example of an entire country that could be in danger of flooding because of climate change\nif polar ice melts and sea levels rise. Concerns over the future of the islands gave reason for the president of the\ncountry to announce a plan in 2008 to purchase land in other countries in case sea levels rise to a point where\nthe Maldives are no longer habitable. The purchase of land from tourism receipts would provide a place for the\nMaldivians to move in case they had to evacuate the islands. The administration of the Maldives has worked hard\nto lobby the international community to address the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the possibility of an\nincrease in sea level caused by the global warming aspect of climate change.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The Punjab is a highly productive agricultural region located partly in Pakistan and partly in India. The\nregion is home to the Sikh population, which has proposed having its own nation-state.\n\u2022 Kashmir is divided between Pakistan, China, and India. The religious differences and the control of a\nvaluable water source are at the core of this conflict.\n\u2022 Nepal borders the Himalayan Mountains and has an economy based on agriculture and tourism. High\npopulation growth has been stripping the land of trees, causing serious deforestation issues and soil erosion.\n\u2022 The Kingdom of Bhutan has placed major restrictions on tourism to protect its environment and limit\noutside influences on its culture.\n\u2022 The beautiful tropical island of Sri Lanka experienced a low-level civil war for decades between the\nSinhalese Buddhist majority and the Tamil Hindu minority. The island has an excellent location and\npotential for economic development.\n\u2022 The archipelago of the Maldives is a small country that depends on tourism for its economic survival. The\nlow elevation of its land area makes it subject to flooding due to the effects of climate change. 9.2 The Peripheral States of South Asia 760\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Outline how Pakistan and Bangladesh are similar in their populations and economic dynamics but different\nin their physical environments.\n2. Understand why the two countries were once under the same government and separated in 1972, when East\nPakistan became Bangladesh.\n3. Describe the various regions of Pakistan and their physical and cultural landscapes.\n4. Comprehend the impact that large populations have on the natural environment and outline the main\nenvironmental issues that confront these two countries.\nPakistan and Bangladesh are two separate and independent countries physically divided by India. Historically,\nthis was not always the case: from 1947 to 1971 they were administered under the same government. The\ntwo countries share a number of attributes. They both have Muslim majorities and both have high population\ndensities. The countries are two of the top ten most populous countries in the world. Their populations are\nyouthful and mainly rural; agriculture is the main economic activity in each country. Rural-to-urban shift is a\nmajor trend affecting urban development. Infrastructure is lacking in many areas of each country. These similar\nfactors indicate that both Pakistan and Bangladesh will face comparable challenges in providing for their large\npopulations and protecting their natural environments.\nThe Muslim League was responsible for the formation of a united Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim state for\nSouth Asian Muslims. Pakistan was created from the former Indian territories of Sindh (Sind), North West\nFrontier Provinces, West Punjab, Baluchistan, and East Bengal. Pakistan was formed with two separate physical\nregions, defined by religious predominance. East Bengal, on the eastern side of India, was known as East Pakistan,\nwhile the remainder, separated by more than one thousand miles, was known as West Pakistan. The two physical\nunits were united politically.\nEast and West Pakistan, administered by one government, became independent of their colonial master in 1947,\nwhen Britain was forced out. Pakistan (East and West) adopted its constitution in 1956 and became an Islamic\nrepublic. In 1970, a massive cyclone hit the coast of East Pakistan and the central government in West Pakistan\nresponded weakly to the devastation. The Bengali populations were angered over the government\u2019s lack of\nconsideration for them in response to the cyclone and in other matters. The Indo-Pakistan War changed the\nsituation. In this war, East Pakistan, with the aid of the Indian military, challenged West Pakistan and declared\nindependence to become Bangladesh in 1972. West Pakistan became the current country of Pakistan.\n761 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 762\nPakistan\nThe physical area of Pakistan is equivalent to the US states of Texas and Louisiana combined. Much of Pakistan\u2019s\nland area comprises either deserts or mountains. The high Himalayan ranges border Pakistan to the north. The\nlack of rainfall in the western part of the country restricts agricultural production in the mountain valleys and near\nthe river basins. The Indus River flows roughly northeast\/southwest along the eastern side of Pakistan, flowing\ninto the Arabian Sea. River sediments are deposited in large areas found between river channels and oxbow lakes\nformed from the constantly changing river channels. These \u201clands between the rivers\u201d are called \u201cdoabs\u201d and\nrepresent some of the most fertile land in the Indian subcontinent. The Indus River flows from the northern part of\nthe Karakoram mountains and creates a large, fertile flood plain that comprises much of eastern Pakistan. Pakistan\nhas traditionally been a land of farming. The Indus River Valley and the Punjab are the dominant core areas where\nmost of the people live and where population densities are remarkably high.\nFigure 9.14 763 World Regional Geography\nThe two core areas of Pakistan are the Punjab and the Indus River Valley.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nApproximately 64 percent of the population lives in rural areas and makes a living in agriculture. Most of the\npeople are economically quite poor by world standards. In spite of the rural nature of the population, the average\nfamily size has decreased from seven to four in recent decades. Nevertheless, the population has exploded from\nabout 34 million in 1951 to about 187 million as of 2011. About half of the population is under the age of twenty;\n35 percent is under the age of fifteen. A lack of adequate medical care, an absence of family planning, and the\nlow status of women have created an ever-increasing population, which will have dire consequences for the future\nof Pakistan. Service and infrastructure to address the needs of this youthful population are not available to the\nnecessary degree. Schools and educational opportunities for children are rarely funded at the needed levels. As of\n2010, only about 50 percent of Pakistan\u2019s population was literate. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 764\nFigure 9.15 The Provinces and Territories of Pakistan\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe capital of Pakistan when it was under British colonialism was Karachi, a port city located on the Arabian Sea.\nTo establish a presence in the north, near Kashmir, the capital was moved to Islamabad in 1960. This example of\na forward capital was an expression of geopolitical assertiveness by Pakistan against India. The lingua franca of\nthe country for the business sector and the social elite continues to be English, even though Urdu is considered the\nnational language of Pakistan and is used as a lingua franca in many areas. More than sixty languages are spoken\nin the country. There are as many ethnic groups in Pakistan as there are languages. The three most prominent\nethnic groups are Punjabis, Pashtuns, and Sindhis. 765 World Regional Geography\nRegions of Pakistan\nThe three main physical geographic regions of Pakistan are the Indus River Basin, the Baluchistan Plateau,\nand the northern highlands. These physical regions are generally associated with the country\u2019s main political\nprovinces. The four main provinces include the Punjab, Baluchistan (Balochistan), Sindh (Sind), and Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa (North West Frontier). To the north is the disputed region of Kashmir known as the Northern\nAreas. Each of these regions represents a different aspect of the country. The North West Frontier has a series\nof Tribal Areas bordering Afghanistan that have been traditionally under their own local control. Agents under\nTribal Agencies have attempted to administer some type of structure and responsibility for the areas, with little\nsuccess.\nThe Punjab\nFigure 9.16 Donkey Cart on Busy Street in Lahore, Pakistan, in the Punjab 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 766\nThis is an example of traditional transportation mixing with modern technology. Lahore is a large city with a wide range of methods\nof conducting business.\nGuilhem Vellut \u2013 A guy and his donkey \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAs explained previously, the Punjab is a core area of Pakistan, and has about 60 percent of Pakistan\u2019s population.\nThe five rivers of the Punjab border India and provide the fresh water necessary to grow food to support a large\npopulation. Irrigation canals create a water management network that provides water throughout the region. The\nsouthern portion of the Punjab includes the arid conditions of the Thar Desert. The northern sector includes\nthe foothills of the mountains and has cooler temperatures in the higher elevations. The Punjab is anchored\nby the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, and Multan. Lahore is the cultural center of Pakistan and is home to the\nUniversity of the Punjab and many magnificent mosques and palaces built during its early history. In the 1980s,\nmany Punjabis migrated to Europe, the Middle East, and North America seeking opportunities and employment.\nThis diaspora of people from the Punjab provided cultural and business ties with Pakistan. For example, trade\nconnections between the Punjab and the United States are increasing. The Punjab is the most industrialized of\nall the provinces. Manufacturing has increased with industries producing everything from vehicles to electrical\nappliances to textiles. The industrialization of the Punjab is an indication of its skilled work force and the highest\nliteracy rate in Pakistan, at about 80 percent. 767 World Regional Geography\nBaluchistan\nFigure 9.17 Man with His Camel in the Desert Region of Baluchistan in Western Pakistan\nKashif Muhammad Farooq \u2013 CAMEL @ GADANI \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nBaluchistan (Balochistan) encompasses a large portion of southwest Pakistan to the west of the Indus River. The\nregion connects the Middle East and Iran with the rest of Asia. The landscape consists of barren terrain, sandy\ndeserts, and rocky surfaces. Baluchistan covers about 44 percent of the entire country and is the largest political 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 768\nunit. The sparse population ekes a living out of the few mountain valleys where water can be found. Local politics\nprovides the basic structure for society in this region. Within the Baluchistan province of Pakistan are several\ncoastal and interior rivers; the interior rivers flow from the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan, while most of\nthe rivers along the coastal deserts from west of Karachi to the Iranian border are seasonal in nature and provide\none of the few sources of fresh water in those coastal regions. Much of the coastal region is arid desert with sand\ndunes and large volcanic mountainous features.\nThe Sindh\nThe Sindh (Sind) region of the southeast is anchored by Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city and major port. The Indus\nRiver is the border on the west and the Punjab region lies to the north. To the east of the Sindh is the border with\nIndia and the great Thar Desert. The Sindh is a region that misses out on the rains from the summer monsoon and\nthe retreating monsoon season, when the winds sweep in from the north over South Asia. The city of Hyderabad,\nPakistan, is located along the Indus River, which is a key food-growing area. Food crops consist of wheat and\nother small grains, with cotton as a major cash crop that helps support the textile industry of the region.\nHyderabad, Pakistan, is not to be confused with a large city with the same name in India.\nFigure 9.18 Female Doctor Examining Patient from a Mobile Medical Clinic in the Sindh Region of Pakistan 769 World Regional Geography\nDFID \u2013 UK Department for International Development \u2013 A female doctor with the International Medical Corps \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nRural-to-urban shift has pushed large numbers of Sindh residents into the city of Karachi to look for opportunities\nand employment. In previous sections, slums and shantytowns have been described and explained for cities such\nas Mexico City and S\u00e3o Paulo; Karachi has similar development patterns. The central business district has a\nthriving business sector that anchors the southern part of the country. The city has a large port facility on the\nArabian Sea. As a city of twelve to fifteen million people or more, there are always problems with a lack of public\nservices, law enforcement, or adequate infrastructure. Urban centers usually have a strong informal economy that\nprovides a means for many of the citizens to get by but is outside the control of the city or national government.\nThe Sindh is the second-most populous region of Pakistan, after the Punjab.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa (The North West Frontier) 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 770\nFigure 9.19 Man Firing AK-47 in the North West Frontier of Pakistan\nKai Hendry \u2013 dcp_9062 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe North West Frontier is a broad expanse of territory that extends from the northern edge of Baluchistan\nto the Northern Areas of the former Kingdom of Kashmir. Sandwiched between the tribal areas along the\nAfghanistan border and the well-watered lands of the Punjab, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province is dominated\nby remote mountain ranges with fertile valleys. The famous Khyber Pass, a major chokepoint into Afghanistan,\nis located here. The frontier is a breeding ground for anti-Western culture and anti-American sentiments, mainly\nfueled by the US military activity in Afghanistan. The Taliban movement that once controlled the government\nof Afghanistan has been active and generally more organized in this region than in Afghanistan. A push for\nmore fundamentalist Islamic law has been a major initiative of the local leaders. Support for education and\nmodernization is minimal. The government of Pakistan has also stepped up its military actions in the region to\ncounter the activities of the militant Islamic extremists. 771 World Regional Geography\nThe Tribal Areas\nThe North West Frontier borders the Tribal Areas, where clans and local leaders are standard parts of the\nsociopolitical structure. These remote areas have seldom been fully controlled by either the colonial governments\n(the British) or the current government of Pakistan. There are about seven main areas that fall under this\ndescription. Accountability for the areas has been difficult and even when the national government stepped in to\nexercise authority, there was serious resistance that halted any real established interaction. These remote areas are\nwhere groups such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban often find safe haven. South and North Waziristan are two of the\nmain areas that have been controlled by Tribal Agencies and not directly by the Pakistani government.\nNorthern Areas with Disputed Kashmir\nPakistan\u2019s Northern Areas include the territories that were once part of the Kingdom of Kashmir, the boundaries\nof which are disputed with India. The region is, in other words, interconnected with the issues related to Kashmir\nthat involve Pakistan, India, and China. There are two main political entities: the large northern section bordering\nAfghanistan is called Gilgit-Baltistan, and the narrow section near Islamabad is called Azad Kashmir (Azad\nJammu and Kashmir). The Northern Areas are highlands, bordered to the north by the towering Karakoram and\nPamir mountain ranges. K2, the world\u2019s second highest mountain, which reaches 28,250 feet, is located here. The\nNorthern Areas are sparsely populated except for the Indus River valley. The conflicts over these territories fuel\nnationalistic forces in both Pakistan and India. The conflicts are as much between Islam and Hinduism as they\nare between political factions. The early war between India and Pakistan over the border that the British placed\nbetween them in 1947 almost seems to be reenacted in the more recent conflicts over the region of Kashmir. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 772\nFigure 9.20 The Highlands of the Northern Areas in Pakistan\nJunaidrao \u2013 This is an absolutely Amazing View \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nReligion and Politics in Pakistan\nToday most of the people living in Pakistan are Muslim. About 85 percent of the Muslim population in Pakistan\nis Sunni and about 15 percent of the Muslim population is Shia, which is consistent with the percentages of the\ntwo Islamic divisions worldwide. Islam is considered the state religion of Pakistan. The state is a federal republic\nwith a parliamentarian style of government. As an Islamic state following the Sharia laws of the Koran, it has\nbeen a challenge for Pakistan to try to balance instituting democratic reforms while staying true to fundamental\nIslamic teachings. Pakistan has held elections for government leaders, and the status of women has improved.\nWomen have held many governmental and political positions, including prime minister. The military has been\na foundation of power for those in charge. As a result of weak economic conditions throughout the country, it\nhas been the military that has received primary attention and is the strongest institution within the government.\nPakistan has demonstrated its nuclear weapons capability in recent years, which established it as a major player in\nregional affairs.\nPakistan has suffered from inadequate funding for public schools. As a rule, the wealthy urban elites have been\nthe only families who could afford to send their children to college. With half the population consisting of young\npeople, there are few opportunities to look forward to in Pakistan. Education has been supported in the form of\nIslamic religious schools called madrassas, which teach children the Koran and Islamic law. Much of the funding 773 World Regional Geography\nfor religious schools comes from outside sources such as Saudi Arabia. The result is a religious education that\ndoes not provide the skills needed for the modern world. Pakistan has worked to build schools, colleges, and\nuniversities to educate its people. The situation is that population growth has been outpacing what little budget\nwas allocated for educational purposes.\nThe government of Pakistan has struggled to meet the challenge posed by the democratic structure of its\nconstitution. The combination of a federal republic and an Islamic state creates a unique and at times difficult\nbalance in administrative politics. The legislative body of Pakistan consists of a National Assembly and a Senate.\nThe leader of the National Assembly is the prime minister. The elected president not only is in charge of the\nmilitary but is also head of state. The military establishment and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency\nhold major political power in Pakistan. The political leadership has often vacillated between military and civilian\nrule. Transitions between the two types of leadership have been conducted through civil unrest or political\ndemonstrations in the streets.\nBenazir Bhutto: The First Female Prime Minister of Pakistan\nWomen\u2019s roles in Pakistani leadership have been complex. To understand the impact of electing the first woman prime\nminister in Pakistan, one has to go back to 1972. At that time, East Pakistan gained its independence and changed its\nname to Bangladesh. At roughly the same time, Pakistan elected President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to power. After ruling for\nfive years, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was ousted from power and sentenced to death by General Zia, who became the next\npresident. General Zia was the first military general to also be president. He allowed the Islamic Sharia law to be\nintroduced into the legal system, which bolstered the influence of Islam on the military and government services. In\n1988, General Zia was killed in an unexplained plane crash. The daughter of the first president\u2014Zulfikar Ali\nBhutto\u2014was then elected as prime minister. The thirty-five-year-old Benazir Bhutto was the first female prime minister\nof Pakistan.\nBenazir Bhutto\u2019s tenure as prime minister was short-lived. After a year and a half, the president removed her from office\non accusations of corruption. She ran again in 1993 and was reelected to the prime minister position. Charges of\ncorruption continued and she was removed as prime minister a second time in 1996. Political corruption, or the\naccusations of such a charge, is not uncommon in Pakistan or other countries with volatile political situations. To keep\nfrom being prosecuted by her opposition, Benazir Bhutto left Pakistan in 1998 and lived in Dubai. She did not return to\nPakistan until 2007, under an agreement reached with the military general who was president at the time, General\nPervez Musharraf. Benazir Bhutto was given amnesty for any and all claims against her. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 774\nFigure 9.21 775 World Regional Geography\nBenazir Bhutto visits the United States in 1989 while she was the prime minister of Pakistan.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe elimination of the corruption charges against her allowed Benazir Bhutto to become a candidate for the office of\npresident. She organized an effective campaign. Her campaign for the presidency energized the political landscape of\nthe country. In December of 2007, her campaign was cut short. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated after departing a\npolitical rally. She was assassinated a few weeks before the polls were to open for the election. Benazir Bhutto was the\nleading opposition candidate. Her death rallied support against General Musharraf with continued calls for his removal\nfrom office. General Musharraf resigned from the presidency in 2008. The winner of the presidential elections that\nfollowed was none other than Benazir Bhutto\u2019s husband, Asif Ali Zardari. President Zardari blamed the Taliban for the\nassassination of his wife. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 776\nEnvironmental Issues in Pakistan\nPakistan is confronted with severe environmental issues. One of the concerns is a fault zone that runs directly\nthrough the region. Pakistan\u2019s regions are divided by the Eurasian tectonic plate and the Indian tectonic plate.\nShifting tectonic plates cause earthquakes; there have been several major ones in Pakistan\u2019s recent history. For\ninstance, an earthquake of 7.6 magnitude in 2005 in the northern region of the North West Frontier claimed\nabout eighty-nine thousand lives in Pakistan and a few thousand others in neighboring India and Afghanistan.\nAbout 150 aftershocks were felt the next day, many of which were over the 6.0 level on the Richter scale. This\nparticular event in 2005 was listed as the fourteenth most devastating earthquake on record at the time. It left\nover three million people without a home in Pakistan alone and more people were left homeless in neighboring\nareas. Hardest hit outside of Pakistan was the portion of Kashmir that is controlled by India. Many countries,\nincluding the United States, stepped up and supported the aid effort to reach people in the devastated region. Major\nearthquakes that cause devastation for the large populations here are common along this tectonic plate boundary.\nAnother environmental issue in Pakistan is water pollution. Raw sewage discharges into the rivers and streams\nand contaminates the drinking water for many Pakistanis. Most of the population lives in rural areas and relies\non natural untreated water for their consumption. The water sources are heavily polluted, triggering disease and\nhealth problems. The urban areas lack public water works to handle fresh water supplies or to dispose of sewage\nproperly. Industrial wastes and agricultural runoff also pollute and damage water supplies. Floods and natural\nrunoff can carry pollutants from the land or urban areas into the rivers and streams that are used by human\ncommunities. The net effect of all these factors is that a majority of Pakistan\u2019s population lacks safe drinking\nwater.\nFigure 9.22 Helping Pakistanis 777 World Regional Geography\nA US Army soldier and Pakistani troops help Pakistani residents as they disembark from a US Army helicopter in Khwazahkela,\nPakistan, as part of relief efforts to help flood victims on August 5, 2010. Heavy rains forced thousands of residents to flee rising\nflood waters. US forces partnered with the Pakistani military to coordinate evacuation and relief efforts.\nThe U.S. Army \u2013 Helping Pakistanis \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nDeforestation is another environmental problem in Pakistan, because the demand for wood for cooking fuel and\nbuilding is on the rise. Only about 2.5 percent of Pakistan is forested. In the last two decades, Pakistan has lost\nabout one-fourth of its forest cover. The removal of forests causes widespread soil erosion during heavy rains and\ndecreases natural habitat for organisms and wild animals. Efforts to protect the biodiversity of the country have\nbeen minimal and are complicated by the increase in population, which is expected to double in about forty-five\nyears if population growth remains on its current trajectory. The reality is that deforestation is likely to continue\nin Pakistan, with little hope of a solution anytime soon. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 778\nBangladesh\nBangladesh is a low-lying country that is associated with the types of marshy environments found in tropical areas\nand river deltas. The region is extremely prone to flooding, particularly during the monsoon season because of\nthe high amount of rainfall. One of the most important rivers of Bangladesh flows southward from the Himalayas\nthrough India and into Bangladesh. While in India, this river is known as the Brahmaputra River, but when it\nenters Bangladesh, it is known as the Jamuna River. It provides a major waterway for this region and empties\ninto the Bay of Bengal.\nFigure 9.23 779 World Regional Geography\nBangladesh has about the same geographical area as the US state of Wisconsin. Bangladesh\u2019s population estimate in 2011 was 158\nmillion; Wisconsin\u2019s was about 5.6 million.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nContributing to the immense flow of water through the country are the Ganges and the Meghna rivers, which join\nup with the Brahmaputra River near the sea. The Ganges flows through northern India and is a major source of\nfresh water for a large population before it reaches Bangladesh. The Meghna is a collection of tributaries within\nthe boundaries of Bangladesh that flows out of the eastern part of the country. The Meghna is a deep river that\ncan reach depths of almost two thousand feet with an average depth of more than one thousand feet. The hundreds\nof water channels throughout the relatively flat country provide for transportation routes for boats and ships that\nmove goods and people from place to place. There are few bridges, so land travel is restricted when rainfall is\nheavy. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 780\nPopulation and Globalization\nImagine a country the size of the US state of Wisconsin. Now imagine half of the entire population of the United\nStates living within its borders. Welcome to Bangladesh. With an estimated population of about 158 million in\n2011 and a land area of only 55,556 square miles, it is one of the most densely populated countries on the planet.\nMost of the population in Bangladesh is rural, agriculturally grounded, and poor. The larger cities, such as the\ncapital of Dhaka, have modern conveniences, complete with Internet cafes, shopping districts, and contemporary\ngoods. The rural areas often suffer from a lack of adequate transportation, infrastructure, and public services.\nPoverty is common; income levels average the equivalent of a few US dollars per day. Remarkably, the culture\nremains vibrant and active, pursuing livelihoods that seek out every opportunity or advantage available to them.\nThere are many ethnic groups in Bangladesh, and many languages are spoken. The official and most widely used\nlanguage in Bangladesh is Bengali (Bengala), which is an Indo-Aryan language of Sanskrit origin and has its\nown script. A Presidential Order in 1987 made Bengali the official language for the government of Bangladesh.\nBengali is also the main language for the Indian state of West Bengal, which neighbors Bangladesh. English is\nused as the lingua franca among the middle and upper classes and in higher education. Many minor languages are\nspoken in Bangladesh and in the region as a whole. Most of the population, about 90 percent, is Muslim, with all\nbut about 3 percent Sunni. There is a sizable minority, about 9 percent, which adheres to Hinduism, Buddhism,\nChristianity, or animism. The US State Department considers Bangladesh to be a moderate Islamic democratic\ncountry.\nFigure 9.24 Street Scene in Dhaka, the Capital of Bangladesh 781 World Regional Geography\nBen Sutherland \u2013 The streets of Dhaka \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nBangladesh suffers from a demographic dilemma. Its tropical climate, availability of fresh water, and productive\nagricultural land have augmented a high population growth rate. The ever-increasing population is a growing\nconcern. The government has stepped up its support for women\u2019s health, birth control, and family planning\nservices. This is an Islamic country, but practical approaches and common sense in regard to population control\nhave won out over Islamic fundamentalism, which has not always supported family planning. This poor and\nhighly populated country has experienced political problems. Most of the people work in agriculture, while\nthe remaining population is primarily concentrated in the service sector. Small business enterprises have been\nencouraged by the issuing of microcredit, or small loans, to assist people in using their skills to earn income. 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 782\nGlobalization is evident in Bangladesh. As a result of the availability of cheap labor, sweat shops have been\nimplemented to manufacture clothing for export to the world markets. The country also receives financial\nremittances from Bangladeshis working overseas in places such as the oil-rich region of the Middle East, which\nalso is predominantly Muslim and is attracting cheap labor for its economic development projects funded by oil\nrevenues. One example of how Bangladesh has been able to acquire materials such as steel is in the recycling of\nold ships. Shipping companies that have ships that are no longer viable for modern shipping have brought them to\nthe shores of Bangladesh to be stripped down, taken apart, and the materials recycled.\nEnvironmental Issues\nThe summer monsoons are both a blessing and a curse in Bangladesh. The blessing of the monsoon rains is that\nthey bring fresh water to grow food. The northeast part of Bangladesh receives the highest amount of rainfall,\naveraging about eighteen feet per year, while the western part of the country averages only about four feet per\nyear. Most of the rain falls during the monsoon season. Bangladesh can grow abundant food crops of rice and\ngrain in the fertile deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers, rivers that ultimately empty into the Bay of\nBengal. About 55 percent of the land area is arable and can be used for farming, but flooding causes serious\ndamage to cropland by eroding soil and washing away seeds or crops. Every year, countless people die because of\nthe flooding, which can cover as much as a third of the country. One of the worst flooding events in Bangladesh\u2019s\nhistory was experienced in 1998, when river flooding destroyed more than three hundred thousand homes and\ncaused more than one thousand deaths, rendering more than thirty million people homeless.\nMost parts of Bangladesh are fewer than forty feet above sea level, and the country is vulnerable to major flooding\naccording to various global warming scenarios. Half of the country could be flooded with a three-foot rise in sea\nlevel. Storm surges from cyclones killed as many as one hundred fifty thousand people in 1991. In comparison,\nabout two thousand people died when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2006. The high death toll from\nflooding does not receive its due attention from Western news media. Environmental concerns increase with the\nlong-term projections of climate change. If sea level rises or if storms increase, then the low-lying agricultural\nlands of Bangladesh would suffer even more flooding and devastation. This would decrease the food supply of a\ngrowing population.\nAnother environmental problem for Bangladesh is deforestation. Wood is traditionally used for cooking and\nconstruction. The needs of a larger population have caused widespread deforestation. Brick and cement have\nbecome alternative building materials, and cow dung has become a widely used cooking fuel even though it 783 World Regional Geography\nreduces the fertilizer base for agriculture. Even so, these adaptations have not halted the deforestation problem.\nThe main remaining forests are located along the southern borders with India and Burma (Myanmar) and in the\nnortheast sector.\nFigure 9.25 Man Working in a Rice Field in Bangladesh\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nBangladeshis suffer because of widespread water pollution from naturally occurring arsenic that contaminates\nwater wells. The pyrite bedrock underneath much of western Bangladesh has large amounts of arsenic in it.\nMillions of people drink groundwater contaminated with this arsenic on a daily basis. Arsenic kills people slowly,\nby building up in their bodies, rotting their fingernails, giving them dark spots and bleeding sores. Arsenic is 9.3 Pakistan and Bangladesh 784\na slow killer and a carcinogen that increases the risk of skin cancer and tumors inside the body. Villagers in\nBangladesh began being affected by these symptoms in the 1970s. In 1993, official tests indicated that up to\n95 percent of the wells in one of the villages in the western region were contaminated. The widespread water\ncontamination has also had a social cost. Reports indicate that husbands are sending their disfigured wives back\nto their families of origin, and some young people are remaining single. Stories are told of people who believe\nthat the health problems are contagious or genetic and can be passed on to children, which causes dilemmas for\nwomen who are trying to find a husband.\nWomen and Banking in Bangladesh\nDespite an overall languishing economy, economic success stories in this poor country do exist. The Grameen Bank has\nbeen working to empower women in Bangladesh for many years. The bank issues microcredit to people in the form of\nsmall loans. These loans do not require collateral. Loans are often issued to impoverished people based on the concept\nthat many of them have abilities that are underutilized and can be transformed into income-earning activities. About 96\npercent of these loans are to women, and the average loan is equivalent to about one hundred dollars. Women have\nproven to be more responsible than men in repaying loans and utilizing the money to earn wealth. The loan recovery\nrate in Bangladesh is higher than 98 percent (Grameen Support Group, 2011). Microcredit has energized poor women to\nuse their skills to make and market their products to earn a living. More than five million women have taken out such\nloans, totaling more than five billion dollars. This program has energized local women to succeed. It has been a model\nfor programs in other developing countries.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 When Britain\u2019s colonialism ended in South Asia in 1947, the Muslim League was instrumental in creating\nthe united Muslim state with both East Pakistan and West Pakistan under one government. East Pakistan\nbroke away and became the independent country of Bangladesh in 1972.\n\u2022 Both Pakistan and Bangladesh have large populations that are increasing rapidly. Both countries have\nagriculturally based economies. Rural-to-urban shift is occurring at an ever-increasing rate in both countries.\nPopulation growth places a heavy tax on natural resources and social services.\n\u2022 The political units within Pakistan include four main provinces. Tribal Areas border Afghanistan and are\ncontrolled by local leaders. The Northern Areas are disputed with India. Each of the provinces has its own\nunique physical and human landscapes.\n\u2022 Earthquakes are common in Pakistan because the country is located on a tectonic plate boundary. 785 World Regional Geography\nDeforestation and water pollution are two other major environmental concerns.\n\u2022 Bangladesh is a low-lying country with the Brahmaputra River, Ganges River, and the Meghna River\nflowing into the Bay of Bengal. Flooding is a major environmental concern that has devastated the country\non a regular basis.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What happened to East Pakistan? Why did its name change?\n2.

Outline the basic activities of British colonialism that affected the realm.\n2. Understand the basic qualities of the rural and urban characteristics of India.\n3. Summarize the main economic activities and economic conditions in India.\n4. Describe the differences between various geographic regions of India.\n5. Explain the measures the Indian government has taken to protect the biodiversity of India.\nIndia and Colonialism\nIndia is considered the world\u2019s largest democracy. As the historic geography and the development patterns of India\nare examined, the complexities of this Hindu state surface. European colonizers of South Asia included the Dutch,\nPortuguese, French, and, finally, the British. In search of raw materials, cheap labor, and expanding markets,\nEuropeans used their advancements in technology to take over and dominate the regional industrial base. The\nEast India Company was a base of British operations in South Asia and evolved to become the administrative\ngovernment of the region by 1857. The British government created an administrative structure to govern South\nAsia. Their centralized government in India employed many Sikhs in positions of the administration to help rule\nover the largely Muslim and Hindu population. The English language was introduced as a lingua franca for the\ncolonies.\nIn truth, colonialism did more than establish the current boundaries of South Asia. Besides bringing the region\nunder one central government and providing a lingua franca, India\u2019s colonizers developed the main port cities of\nBombay, Calcutta, and Madras (now called Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, respectively. The names of the\nport cities have been reverted to their original Hindi forms). The port cities were access points for connecting\ngoods with markets between India and Europe. Mumbai became the largest city and the economic center of India.\n787 9.4 India 788\nIn 1912, to exploit the interior of India, the British moved their colonial capital from Kolkata, which was the port\nfor the densely populated Ganges River basin, to New Delhi. Chennai was a port access to southern India and the\ncore of the Dravidian ethnic south.\nBritain exploited India by extending railroad lines from the three main port cities into the hinterlands, to transport\nmaterials from the interior back to the port for export. The Indian Railroad is one of the largest rail networks on\nEarth. The problem with colonial railroads was that they did not necessarily connect cities with other cities. The\nBritish colonizers connected rail lines between the hinterland and the ports for resource exploitation and export\nof commercial goods. Today, the same port cities act as focal points for the import\/export activity of globalization\nand remain core industrial centers for South Asia. They are now well connected with the other cities of India.\nGoa is the smallest state of modern-day India. In the sixteenth century, it was first encountered by Portuguese\ntraders, who annexed it shortly thereafter to become a colony of Portugal, which it was for the next 450 years.\nGoa was one of the longest-held colonial possessions in the world, and was not annexed by India until 1961.\nBy the mid-1800s, most of the population of this tiny area had been forcibly converted to Christianity. Although\nmany Hindu traditions survived the colonial period, and Hindu holidays are celebrated here, Goa is known for its\nChristian holiday celebrations, especially Christmas and Easter. The cathedral and secular architecture in many of\nthe historic buildings of Goa are European in style, reflecting its Portuguese origins.\nThe People of India\nContrasts in India are explicitly evident in the regional differences of its human geography. The north-south\ncontrasts are apparent through the lingua franca and ethnic divisions. The main lingua franca in the north is Hindi.\nIn the Dravidian-dominated south, the main lingua franca is English. The densely populated core region along the\nGanges River, anchored on each end by Delhi\/New Delhi and Kolkata, has traditionally been called the heartland\nof India. The south is anchored by the port city of Chennai and the large city of Bangalore. Chennai has been\na traditional industrial center. The industrial infrastructure has shifted to more modern facilities in other cities,\ngiving over to a \u201crustbelt\u201d syndrome for portions of the Chennai region. India is a dynamic country, with shifts\nand changes constantly occurring. Any attempt to stereotype India into cultural regions would be problematic. 789 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.26 The Three Main Language Families in India\nHindi is the official language of the government, and both Hindi and English are the lingua franca.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain; University of Texas Libraries.\nIn 2010, India had more than 1.18 billion people, which is about one-sixth of the human population of the earth.\nAn 80 percent majority follow Hindu beliefs. About 13 percent of the population is Muslim. Thirteen may not\nseem like a high percentage, but in this case it equates to about 140 million people. This is equivalent to all the\nMuslims who reside in the countries of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt combined. India is sometimes called\nthe third-largest Muslim country in the world, after Indonesia and Pakistan, because of its large Muslim minority.\nIndia essentially has two lingua francas: English and Hindi, of which Hindi is the official language of the Indian\ngovernment. India has twenty-eight states and fourteen recognized major languages. Many different languages are\nspoken in rural areas. The languages of northern India are mainly based on the Indo-European language family.\nLanguages used in the south are mainly from the Dravidian language family. A few regions that border Tibet in\nthe north use languages from the Sino-Tibetan language family. 9.4 India 790\nUrban versus Rural\nRural and urban life within the Indian Subcontinent varies according to wealth and opportunity. While\nconcentrated in specific areas across the landscape, in general the population in rural areas is discontinuous and\nspread thinly. In urban areas, the populations are very concentrated with many times the population density found\nin rural areas. India has six world-class cities: Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad.\nThere are many other large cities in India; in 2010, India had forty-three cities with more than a million people\neach.\nIndia\u2019s interior is mainly composed of villages. In rural villages, much of the economy is based on subsistence\nstrategies, primarily agriculture and small cottage industries. The lifestyle is focused on the agricultural cycles\nof soil preparation, sowing, and harvesting as well as tending animals, particularly water buffalo, cattle, goats,\nand sheep. About 65 percent of the population lives in rural areas and makes a living in agriculture. About 35\npercent of the population\u2014which is equal to the entire US population\u2014is urbanized. India is rapidly progressing\ntoward urbanization and industrialization. Changes in technology, however, tend to be slow in dispersing to the\nrural villages. More than half the villages in India do not have road access for motor vehicles. For residents of\nthose villages, walking, animal carts, and trains are the main methods of transportation. Agricultural technology\nis primitive. Diffusion of new ideas, products, or methods can be slow. Modern communication technology is,\nhowever, helping connect these remote regions.\nFigure 9.27 Farmer Tilling a Field with Oxen in Rural India 791 World Regional Geography\nAnanth BS \u2013 Annadatha \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIndia\u2019s cities are dynamic places, with millions of people, cars, buses, and trucks all found in the streets. In many\nareas of urban centers, traffic may be stopped to await the movement of a sacred cow or a donkey or bullock cart\nloaded with merchandise. Indian cities are growing at an unsustainable rate. Overcrowded and congested, the main\ncities are modernizing and trying to keep up with global trends. Traditionally, family size was large. Large family\nsize results in a swell of young people migrating to urban areas to seek greater opportunities and advantages. In\nmodern times, family size has been reduced to about three children, an accomplishment that did not come easily\nbecause of the religious beliefs of most of India\u2019s people. If current trends continue, India will overtake China as\nthe most populous country in the world in about fifty years.\nThe level of official governmental control is usually different in an urban setting from what it is in the rural areas.\nThere may be more police or military personnel in areas of heavy traffic or in urban areas that need extra control.\nA central feature of many Indian cities is an older central city that represents the protected part of the city. In\nDelhi, for example, New Delhi represents the new construction of government buildings that was begun during the\nBritish occupation of the region as part of the British Empire. Old Delhi represents the old markets, government\nbuildings, palaces, fortresses, and mosques that were built during the Mogul Empire, between the mid-1500s and\nthe mid-1800s. These older parts of the cities, particularly the markets, are bustling with activities, merchants,\nshoppers, cab drivers, and pedal and motor rickshaws. Rickshaws are either bicycle-driven cabs or cabs based on\nenclosed motor scooters.\nIn urban areas, there is a socioeconomic hierarchy of a small group of people who are wealthy and can afford all\nthe amenities we associate with modern life\u2014electricity, clean water, television, computers, and the like. One of\nthe things that characterize modern Indian cities is an expanding middle class. Many young people see the kinds\nof material goods that are available in the West and are creating job markets and opportunities to allow them to 9.4 India 792\nreach or maintain this type of lifestyle. One of the major markets to support this burgeoning middle class is the\ninformation technology field, as well as outsourcing in many of the cities of peninsular India.\nIndia is a country with considerable contrast between the wealthy urban elites and the poor rural villagers, many\nof whom move to the cities and live in slums and work for little pay. Low labor costs have enabled Indian cities to\nindustrialize in many ways similar to Western cities, complete with computers, Internet services, and other modern\ncommunications services. India\u2019s growing middle class is a product of educational opportunities and technological\nadvancements. This available skilled labor base has allowed India\u2019s industrial and information sectors to take\nadvantage of economic opportunities in the global marketplace to grow and expand their activities. Development\nwithin India is augmented by outsourcing activities by American and European corporations to India. Service\ncenter jobs created by business process outsourcing (BPO) are in high demand by skilled Indian workers.\nIndia\u2019s Economic Situation\nIn the past decade, India has possessed the second fastest growing economy in the world; China is first. India\u2019s\neconomy continues to rapidly expand and have a tremendous impact on the world economy. In spite of the size\nof the economy, India\u2019s population has a low average per capita income. Approximately one-fourth of the people\nliving in India live in poverty; the World Bank classifies India as a low-income economy. India has followed a\ncentral economic model for most of its development since it declared independence. The central government has\nexerted strict control over private sector economic development, foreign trade, and foreign investment. Through\nvarious economic reforms since the 1990s, India is beginning to open up these markets by reducing government\ncontrol on foreign investment and trade. Many publicly owned businesses are being privatized. Globalization\nefforts have been vigorous in India. There has been substantial growth in information services, health care, and\nthe industrial sector. 793 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.28 Mumbai (Bombay), the Economic Capital and Largest City in India\nAjay Goyal \u2013 city father \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe economy is extremely diverse and has focused on agriculture, handicrafts, textiles, manufacturing, some\nindustry, and a vast number of services. A 60 percent majority of the population earns its income directly from\nagriculture and agriculture-related services. Land holdings by individual farmers are small, often less than five\nacres. When combined with the inadequate use of modern farming technologies, small land holdings become\ninadequately productive and impractical. Monsoons are critical for the success of India\u2019s agricultural crops\nduring any given season. Because the rainfall of many agricultural areas is tied to the monsoon rains of only\na few months, a weak or delayed rainfall can have disastrous effects on the agricultural economy. Agricultural\nproducts include commercial crops such as coffee and spices (cardamom, pepper, chili peppers, turmeric, vanilla,\ncinnamon, and so on). An important product for perfume and incense is sandalwood, harvested primarily in the\ndense forests of the state of Karnataka, in southwestern India. Bamboo is an important part of the agricultural\nharvest as well. Of course, rice and lentils provide an important basis for the local economy.\nOver the last two decades, information technology and related services are transforming India\u2019s economy and\nsociety. In turn, India is transforming the world\u2019s information technologies in terms of production and service as\nwell as the export of skilled workers in financial, computer hardware, software engineering, and software services.\nManufacturing and industry are becoming a more important part of India\u2019s economy as it begins to expand.\nManufacturing and industry account for almost one-third of the gross domestic product (GDP) and contribute jobs\nto almost one-fifth of the total workforce. Major economic sectors such as manufacturing, industry, biotechnology,\ntelecommunications, aviation, shipbuilding, and retail are exhibiting strong growth rates.\nA large number of educated young people who are fluent in English are changing India into a \u201cback office\u201d target\nfor global outsourcing for customer services. These customer services focus on computer-related products but also 9.4 India 794\ninclude service-related industries and online sales companies. The level of outsourcing of information activity to\nIndia has been substantial. Any work that can be conducted over the Internet or telephone can be outsourced to\nanywhere in the world that has high-speed communication links. Countries that are attractive to BPO are countries\nwhere the English language is prominent, where employment costs are low, and where there is an adequate labor\nbase of skilled or educated workers that can be trained in the services required. India has been the main destination\nfor BPO activity from the United States. Firms with service work or computer programming are drawn to India\nbecause English is a lingua franca and India has an adequate skilled labor base to draw from.\nTourism has always been an important part of India\u2019s economy and has been focused on the unique natural\nenvironments as well as historical cities, monuments, and temples found throughout the country. Of particular\nimportance are the Mogul-period tombs, palaces, and mosques in Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur, India\u2019s \u201cGolden\nTriangle\u201d of tourism. India is a country of contrasts. Scenic beauty abounds from the Eastern and Western Ghats\nto the high mountains of the Himalayas. The monsoon rains provide abundant agricultural crops for densely\npopulated regions such as the Ganges River basin. On the other hand, places such as the Thar Desert are sparsely\ninhabited. There is a wide gap between the wealthy elite and the massive numbers of people who live in poverty.\nMumbai has some of the largest slums in Asia, yet it is the financial capital of India, teeming with economic\nactivity.\nAs incomes rise for the middle class in India, the price of automobiles becomes more accessible. On the downside,\nan escalation in the numbers of motor vehicles in use tends to lead to an escalation in the levels of air pollution\nand traffic congestion. Similarly, an expansion of transportation systems increases the use of fossil fuels. India is\na major competitor for fossil fuels exported from the Persian Gulf and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) sources. The continued industrialization and urbanization in India foretells an increase in\ndemand for energy. Rising energy costs and demand, combined with economic growth, have caused a serious\nproblem for India. Many areas will be without power as they are shut off the power grid for hours or days, a\nprocess known as load-shedding. This allows industry and manufacturing to use the energy resources during peak\ntimes. In general, India is poor in natural gas and oil resources and is heavily dependent on coal and foreign oil\nimports. India is rich in alternative energy resources, such as solar, wind, and biofuels; however, alternative energy\nresources have not been sufficiently developed.\nVehicle Manufacturing 795 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.30 The Nano, Made in India\nThe Nano is considered the world\u2019s most inexpensive car.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nTwo examples of India\u2019s growing economic milieu are motor vehicle manufacturing and the movie industry.\nIndia\u2019s vehicle manufacturing base is expanding rapidly. Vehicle manufacturing companies from North America,\nEurope, and East Asia are all active in India, and India also has its own share of vehicle manufacturing companies.\nFor example, Mumbai-based Tata Motors Ltd. is the country\u2019s foremost vehicle production corporation and\nit claims to be the second-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the world. Tata Motors is India\u2019s largest\ndesigner and manufacturer of commercial buses and trucks, and it also produces the most inexpensive car in\nthe world, the Tata Nano. Tata Motors manufactures midsized and larger automobiles, too. The company has\nexpanded operations to Spain, Thailand, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The company is an example of\nan Indian-based international corporation that is a force in the global marketplace. In 2010, India was recognized\nas a major competitor with Thailand, South Korea, and Japan as the fourth main exporter of autos in Asia. 9.4 India 796\nThe Indian Cinema\nCinema makes up a large portion of the entertainment sector in India. India\u2019s cinema industry is often referred\nto as \u201cBollywood,\u201d a combination of Bombay and Hollywood. Technically, Bollywood is only the segment of\nthe Indian cinema that is based out of Bombay (Mumbai), but the title is sometimes misleadingly used to refer\nto the entire movie industry in India. Bollywood is the leading movie maker in India and has a world-class film\nproduction center. In the past few years, India has been producing as many as one thousand films annually. The\nhighest annual output for the US film industry is only about two-thirds that of India. According to the Guinness\nBook of World Records, India\u2019s city of Hyderabad has the most extensive film production center in the world. The\nTelugu film industry operates the studio in Hyderabad.\nFigure 9.31\nBollywood is a major film production company located in Mumbai (Bombay). The film industry in India produces almost twice as\nmany movies as the United States. Indian production scenes can be dramatic and expressive.\nFeminist julie \u2013 Bollywood \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nIndian films are produced in more than a dozen languages and appeal to a wide domestic and international\naudience. Indian movies range from long epic productions with stories within stories to dramas, musicals, and\ntheatrical presentations. Their popularity extends beyond South Asia. Indian movies with modest dress, lack of\nexplicit sexual scenes, and a focus on drama are popular in places such as Egypt, the Middle East, and other\nAfrican countries. Movie stars are energetically promoted and enjoy celebrity in India, as is the case with the\nentertainment industry in the United States and Europe. The cinema is part of the cultural experience in Indian\nsociety. Urban life in India reserves a large presence for the entertainment industry, particularly the Indian film 797 World Regional Geography\nindustry. One of the prime artistic endeavors in urban India is movie posters depicting all the glory of the latest\nBollywood movie. Most of these colorful posters are painted by hand and they tend to be large; some are several\nstories high.\nIndia: East and West\nSouth Asia\u2019s physical geography\u2014an overview of its physical features\u2014was described at the beginning of the\nchapter. India makes up the largest physical area of the South Asia realm. Another way of looking at the physical\nand human landscapes of India is to study spatial characteristics. Additionally, the economic side of the equation\ncan be illustrated by dividing India between east and west according to economic development patterns. To do\nthis, on a map of India draw an imaginary line from the border with Nepal in the north, near Kanpur, to the Polk\nStrait border with Sri Lanka in the south. This division of India illustrates two sides of India\u2019s economic pattern:\nan economically progressive West India and an economically stagnant East India.\nFigure 9.32 9.4 India 798\nIndia can be divided either along north\/south dimensions or along east\/west dimensions.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nThe progressive western side of India is anchored by Mumbai and its surrounding industrial community. Mumbai\nis the economic giant of India with the country\u2019s main financial markets, and has been a magnet for high-\ntech firms and manufacturing. Mumbai\u2019s port provides access to global markets and is solidly connected to\ninternational trade networks. Auto manufacturing, the film industry, and computer firms all have major centers\nin the large urban metropolitan areas of the west. Large industrial cities such as Bangalore and Hyderabad have\nestablished themselves as high-tech production centers, attracting international business in the computer industry\nand the information sector. Chemical processing has been ongoing in Bhopal, which is noted for an environmental\ndisaster, a gas leak in 1984 that resulted in the deaths of as many as ten thousand people. The nation\u2019s capital\nis located in New Delhi, which borders the massive city of (Old) Delhi. The western half of India has been\nprogressing along a pattern with a positive economic outlook that views the global community outside of India as\na partner in its success.\nThe eastern half of India has not been as prosperous as the west in its economic growth. The renowned city\nof Kolkata has traditionally anchored the eastern sector, but its factories have deteriorated into rustbelt status\nwith aging and outdated heavy industries. The high-intensity labor activities of textile and domestic goods\nmanufacturing are not as economically viable as they were in the past. The stagnant economic scene in the east is\nsignified by the low average income levels of many of the states in the eastern region. Neighboring Bangladesh\noffers little in support of economic growth, and Myanmar, another neighbor to the east, has its own set of problems\nand lacks support for East India. The eastern half of India does not have the strong partnerships with the global\neconomy found in the west and thus relies more on internal resources for survival. 799 World Regional Geography\nIndia: North and South\nThere are differences in the geographic patterns between the northern and southern halves of India as well as\nbetween the eastern and western halves\u2014depending on the criteria used to compare them. Climate patterns,\nfor example, are more diverse in the north, with a wide range of temperatures throughout the seasons. Winter\ntemperatures in the mountainous north are cold and summer temperatures in the Thar Desert can be extremely\nhigh. Southern India has a more moderate range of temperatures throughout the year. The far north has high\nmountains. The south has only the low-lying Eastern and Western Ghats. The north has the extensive Ganges\nRiver basin. The south has different drainage networks based on the plateaus of the region.\nBesides physical aspects, there are cultural differences between the north and south as well. India is a complex\nsocietal mix of many ethnic groups, languages, and traditions. Spatially separating the country into vernacular\nregions is not conducive to agreeable results. Still, there are some recognizable trends that have been stereotyped\nor commonly stated between the northern and southern parts of India. The north is portrayed as a faster-paced\nsociety, with more edge and competitiveness. The south has been portrayed as more relaxed and less insistent.\nAs the section on languages illustrated, Indo-European languages are mainly spoken in the north and Dravidian\nlanguages are predominantly spoken in the south. Hindi is more commonly the lingua franca of the north, while\nEnglish is more frequently the lingua franca of the south. People in the north are of Indo-Aryan descent, while\nthe people in the south have a Dravidian heritage. Hinduism dominates all of India, but the north has a wider\ndiversity of religions, such as Sikhism, Buddhism, and Islam, practiced by a large number of people. The south\nhas a substantial Christian population along its west coast.\nFood is an important aspect of the culture of societies, and there are clearly distinctions between the cuisine of\nthe north and of the south in India. Indian cooking is primarily vegetarian, emphasizing aspects of Hinduism.\nHowever, many dishes, particularly in North India, contain goat, chicken, lamb, fish, and other meats. Beef is not\neaten by Hindus, while pork and some species of fish are not traditionally eaten by Muslims. North India has more\nwheat-based products and less rice. Their dishes are prepared with spices and herbs, including black and chili\npeppers. Northern Indian food is characterized by its use of dairy products (yogurt; milk; paneer, or homemade\ncheeses; and ghee, or clarified butter). Onions, ghee, and spices are the common base for different types of salans\nor curries (gravies). Griddles are used for preparing different types of flat breads\u2014chapattis, naan, and kulcha.\nRice, lentils, and chickpeas are a staple part of the diet in North India.\nFigure 9.33 9.4 India 800\nA meal of fish curry with rice and peppers can be found in South India.\nRovingl \u2013 Fish Curry \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nFood in the southern parts of India includes more rice as a staple, and seafood (fish and prawns) is common\nalong the coastal areas. Coconut oil is used as a basis for cooking. Sambar, a stew made of peas and vegetables,\nis an important staple of the region as are rice and idlis, which are a type of cake or bread made from steaming\nfermented black lentils. Chili peppers are also common in South Indian cooking.\nBiodiversity and the Environment\nEarlier sections have introduced the issues of population growth and resource depletion in South Asia. India has\nits share of the same environmental problems. Water pollution along the Ganges is severe and affects the largest\nconcentration of people in India. India is the second-largest consumer of coal in the world, coal that is mainly 801 World Regional Geography\nburned to produce electricity. Burning coal adds significantly to air pollution. A rise in the number of vehicles in\nuse, combined with few emission controls, also adds to the air pollution in urban areas. Deforestation continues\nin many rural areas, as was noted in earlier sections about Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nIndia has a number of rare animal species that need habitat if they are going to survive. A few of the larger\nanimals include the Indian Rhinoceros, Clouded Leopard, Indian Leopard, Snow Leopard, Asiatic Lion, Bengal\nTiger, Asian Water Buffalo, Asian Elephant, Stripped Hyena, and the Red Panda. Many species are endangered or\nthreatened along with many other lesser-known organisms. The high human population growth throughout South\nAsia places a strain on the natural habitat of wild animals. Habitat loss caused by human development makes\nholding on to the wide array of biodiversity difficult.\nFigure 9.34\nThe Indian Leopard is a near-threatened species that once lived throughout South Asia.\nSid Lammata \u2013 Indian Leopard \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nIndia has instituted measures designed to preserve its biodiversity. The Indian government has created sanctuaries 9.4 India 802\nfor threatened or endangered species. National parks were established before India declared independence and\nwere substantially expanded in recent decades. In 1972, The Wildlife Protection Act was instituted to create\ncritical habitat for tigers and other rare species. There are hundreds of protected wildlife areas and fifteen\nbiosphere reserves in India. Four of the biospheres were created in conjunction with the World Network of\nBiosphere Reserves.\nThe Indian government has established protected areas throughout the country, many of which are in the highland\nregions and the northern mountains. For example, the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, including an area preserved for\nAsian Lions, is located on the Kathiawar Peninsula north of Mumbai, which juts out into the Arabian Sea. India\nis the only place left with Asian Lions in the wild. Tigers, elephants, rhinos, and leopards can be found in the\nsanctuaries. The country has about ninety-two national parks, which are also home to rare wildlife species, and\nmore than three hundred fifty wildlife sanctuaries of all sizes. There are about twenty-eight tiger reserves in India.\nThe country also has a number of marine reserves and protected areas along its coastlines.\nThe efforts of the Indian government to protect the country\u2019s biodiversity constitute an admirable environmental\nundertaking. The government has stepped up law enforcement efforts to combat poaching, which is a major cause\nof the decrease in numbers of rare species. Poachers kill animals such as tigers, leopards, elephants, and rhinos\nfor their hides, horns, or body parts, which are sold on the black market in Asia for large sums of money. Many of\nthe rare, threatened, or endangered species of India would not have a chance of survival without the government\nefforts to protect and provide for them. Balancing finding resources for rapid human population growth with\nwildlife management will continue to be a challenge in the years ahead for India and all countries of the planet.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Colonialism had a tremendous impact on South Asia and its people. Colonial development patterns were\nimplemented to control the people and to extract resources, not necessarily to benefit the realm.\n\u2022 India has a wide disparity between its poor rural areas with agricultural economies and its wealthier bustling\ncities with expanding business sectors.\n\u2022 Various urban centers of India have positioned themselves well to take advantage of the global economy and\nexpand their manufacturing and industrial base. India is becoming a major manufacturing country for\nvehicles and high-tech industries.\n\u2022 There are noticeable economic differences between the more progressive Western India and the stagnant\neconomic conditions of Eastern India. There is also a noticeable cultural difference between the North and\nthe South in India in the categories of language, ethnicity, food, and society.\n\u2022 The Indian government has created national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and game reserves to help protect\nrare, threatened, or endangered species.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

There\nare people in the realm who continue to adhere to animist beliefs who are not followers of any of the main world\nreligions. The oldest world religions of India are Hinduism and Buddhism. Other important religions in the realm\ninclude Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and the Baha\u2019i faith. India is at times labeled a\nHindu state, but the accuracy of the label is dubious. A more suitable way to describe India is to say that it is a\nsecular country where approximately 80 percent of the population follows Hindu traditions. Islam is the second-\nmost popular religion, practiced by about 13 percent of the population. Christianity is India\u2019s third-largest religion,\npracticed by about 3 percent of the population. Sikhism accounts for about 2 percent of the population of India.\nBuddhism and Jainism are two other minority religions that have their origins in South Asia. And finally, there are\nstill Indians who practice animist religions that predate all the other religions listed, especially in remote areas.\nHinduism\nHinduism is one of the world\u2019s oldest major religions still practiced. Its origins can be traced to ancient Vedic\ncivilizations in India approximately three thousand years ago. The religion is found mainly in India, and it has the\nthird-highest number of believers of religions in the world. Hinduism does not originate from a single teacher but\nfrom many traditions. The Hindu belief system consists of a number of schools of thought, with a wide variety of\nrituals and practices.\nHinduism has a vast body of written scripture that discusses theology, mythology, and philosophy as well as\nproviding important guidance on the practice of dharma, religious or right living. These texts include the Vedas\nand the Upanishads. Other important scripts include the Tantras, the Agamas, the Pur\u0101nas, and the epics of the\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101yana. The Bhagavad Git\u0101 is a small part of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that is a conversation\nbetween one of the Pandava brothers and the god Krishna, concerning the meaning of life and worthiness. This is\noften thought to be a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas. 9.5 Religions of India and South Asia 806\nFigure 9.36 Shiva Statue in Bangalore, India\nAndrea \u2013 Lord Shiva \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nPredominantly, Hinduism follows the teachings of many gods or goddesses, frequently including a Supreme\nBeing. While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of gods and goddesses, many are thought to represent different\naspects of the same individual or Supreme Being. These individuals can be recognized by items that they are\nholding as well as by the vehicle or avatar that carries them. The three main deities and most widely venerated\nof the Hindu faith are Shiva the Destroyer, Vishnu the Preserver, and Brahma the Creator. There is a continuous\ncycle in which the original creation was accomplished by Brahma, Shiva destroys the universe, and Vishnu will 807 World Regional Geography\nrecreate or preserve that universe from destruction. Different Hindu traditions have venerated each of the three\nmain deities as the all-encompassing Supreme Being.\nThe polytheistic traditions of Hinduism consider a large number of deities or spiritual entities. Since there is no\none creed or unified systems of beliefs, Hinduism has been referred to as more of a religious tradition than a\nreligion. It has been said that Hinduism cannot be defined, but is instead experienced. This understanding allows\na variety of beliefs to be included in the vast array of Hindu religious practices. There is actually freedom for\nthe individual as to the form of worship or individual beliefs. The religion in general is more of a tradition and\nlifestyle with different avenues of practice. This allows for the diversity of spiritual deities or their manifestations\nwithin one Hindu faith.\nHinduism is an extremely diverse religion, making it extremely difficult to define set doctrines that are accepted\nby all denominations. Within the wide spectrum of religious traditions are general concepts that are common to\nHindu beliefs. Hindus believe in Dharma (code of conduct or duty), Samsara (reincarnation\/rebirth), Karma\n(personal actions and choices), and Moksha (salvation) by belief in God and through an individual path of faith.\nReincarnation is a cycle of death and rebirth for a soul to transmigrate through until it reaches Moksha. Karma\ngoverns how the soul is reincarnated. Actions in this life determine the soul\u2019s life cycle for the next life. Positive\nand upright works will draw one closer to God and a rebirth through reincarnation into a life with a wider\nconsciousness or higher caste level. Evil or bad actions take the soul farther from God and into a lower form of\nworldly life or caste level. In the Hindu faith the eternal natural law applies to all life forms. The cycle of death\nand rebirth for the soul is necessary to reach the ultimate goal of reaching the universal divine spirit. Yoga is often\nused as a practice or path for following the traditions.\nPilgrimages are common in Hindu practice. Holy sites or temples are located throughout India and are regular\ndestinations for the Hindu faithful. Pilgrimage is not required but is routinely conducted by a good number of\nHindus. Besides many holy temples, a variety of cities and other holy places are pilgrimage destinations for\nHindus. Varanasi, one such city, is considered by many as the holiest city of Hinduism, although other cities also\nhold this distinction. Located on the Ganges River, Varanasi is home to a large number of temples and shrines. The\nmost visited shrine in Varanasi is one in honor of a manifestation of Shiva. Hindu festivals are held in Varanasi\nthroughout the year, many along the banks of the Ganges. Varanasi is also one of the holiest places in Buddhism;\nit is said to have been designated by Gautama Buddha as one of four prime pilgrimage sites.\nVaranasi boasts more than one hundred ghats that provide access to the Ganges River. These ghats are not to be\nconfused with the Eastern and Western Ghats that are highland ranges located along the coasts of India. For this\napplication, a ghat is a term for a set of steps leading to the water. Some ghats are used for bathing, some for\nreligious rituals, and others for the cremation of the dead. More than one million Hindu pilgrims visit Varanasi\nannually. Mother Ganga, as the river is referred to in Hinduism, is considered holy by many Hindu followers.\nDevotees ritually bathe in the river or take \u201choly\u201d water from it home to ill family members. Some Hindus\nbelieve that the water can cure illnesses. Others believe that bathing in the Ganges will wash away your sins. The\nnonspiritual truth is that the Ganges is a highly polluted waterway. The water is not considered safe for human\nconsumption by most universal health standards. 9.5 Religions of India and South Asia 808\nFigure 9.37 Ghat in Varanasi, India, where Hindu Faithful Access the Ganges River\nRupert Taylor-Price \u2013 People washing at India ghats \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nHindu Marriage Act\nIndia\u2019s 1955 Hindu Marriage Act addresses the issues of marrying outside of one\u2019s religion or caste. The act proclaims\nthat all Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Hindus of any sect, creed, or caste level are considered as Hindus and can\nintermarry. A non-Hindu is allowed to marry a Hindu, with the provision that specific legal stipulations must be\nfollowed, regardless of the ceremony. Every Hindu marriage has to be witnessed by the Sacred Fire, in deference to\nAgni, the fire deity. To complete the marriage, the bride and groom must together encircle the Sacred Fire seven times. 809 World Regional Geography\nFigure 9.38 Hindu Wedding Couple in India\n. .. \u2013 Hindu Weddings \u2013 North Indian \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0. 9.5 Religions of India and South Asia 810\nThe Hindu Caste System\nThe exact origins of Hinduism and the caste system are unknown, but powerful nomadic Aryan warriors appeared\nin northern India about 1500 BCE. The Aryans conquered most of India at the time, including the Dravidian\ngroups of central and southern India. They organized society into separate groups or castes. Every person was\nborn into an unchanging group or caste that remained his or her status for the rest of his or her life. All lifetime\nactivities were conducted within one\u2019s own caste. The caste a person was born into was considered to be based on\nwhat they had done in a past life. The caste system has evolved differently in different parts of Asia. Each Hindu\nbranch has its own levels of castes, and thousands of sublevels have been established over time. In Hinduism, the\nbasic system originated around five main caste levels:\n1. Brahmin: priests, teachers, and judges\n2. Kshatriya: warrior, ruler, or landowner\n3. Vaishya: merchants, artisans, and farmers\n4. Shudra: workers and laborers\n5. Dalits (Untouchables or Harijan): outcasts or tribal groups\nThe Dalits (Untouchables or Harijan) traditionally worked in jobs relating to \u201cpolluting activities,\u201d including\nanything unclean or dead. Dalits have been restricted from entering Hindu places of worship or drinking water\nfrom the same sources as members of higher castes. They often had to work at night and sleep during the day. In\nmany areas, Dalits needed to take their shoes off while passing by upper-caste neighbors. Dalits could leave their\nHindu caste by converting to Christianity, Buddhism, or Islam. The Indian government has implemented a positive\naffirmative action plan and provided the Dalits with representation in public offices and certain employment\nprivileges. This policy has received harsh opposition by upper-caste groups. Technically, the caste system is illegal\nunder current Indian law. Nevertheless, the opportunities that are available to the upper castes remain out of reach\nto many of the lowest caste. In some areas, education and industrialization have diminished the caste system\u2019s\ninfluence. In other areas, Hindu fundamentalists have pushed for a stronger Hindu-based social structure and\nopposed any reforms.\nTraditional socioeconomic status tends to be more important in rural areas, where the caste system is more\nformally adhered to. If you live in a community of millions of people, caste affiliations tend not to be important,\nbut in a smaller, more rural community, these relationships and the status they hold can be very important,\nespecially as many of the castes are associated with traditional village tasks, such as religious leaders, politicians,\nfarmers, leather workers, or other activities. 811 World Regional Geography\nBuddhism\nAround 535 BCE in northern India, a prince by the name of Siddhartha Gautama broke from the local traditions\nthat shaped Hinduism and taught religious salvation through meditation, the rejection of earthly desires, and\nreverence for all life forms. Siddhartha is recognized as the first Buddha. He taught that through many cycles of\nrebirth a person can attain enlightenment and no longer have a need for desire or selfish interests. Enlightenment is\nbeing free from suffering and is reaching a state of liberation often referred to as Nirvana. Buddhism is considered\na \u201cdharmic\u201d faith that concerns following a path of duty for a proper life. According to Buddhism, life is dictated\nby karma, which connects our actions with future experiences. Buddhism spread across the Indian Subcontinent\nafter the sixth century BCE and became the region\u2019s dominant religion within 1,500 years. However, since that\ntime, the religion has diminished in the Indian Subcontinent, although it has seen some revival under the influence\nof Buddhist scholars. Buddhism predominates in the northernmost areas of India.\nFigure 9.40 Statue of Buddha at Bodh Gaya, India 9.5 Religions of India and South Asia 812\nMan Barlett \u2013 Untitled \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nBuddhism is the majority religion in Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Tibet, and most of Southeast Asia. It was prominent\nin China, Mongolia, and North Korea before their governments adopted Communist ideology. Communist\ngovernments officially announced that their countries were nonreligious, although many people still followed\nreligious systems. Various branches of Buddhism have developed, with many schools established within each\nbranch. Buddhism can be divided geographically into southern, northern, and eastern Buddhism. Scholars and\nBuddhists practitioners may arrive at various methods of classification of the various schools of thought within\nthe Buddhist faith; the geographic basis of recognition provides only one way to understand the variations within\nthe religion. One feature common throughout all branches of the faith is that Buddhism does not have caste levels.\nThe southern branch of Buddhism is known as Theravada Buddhism (the Teaching of the Elders), most prominent\nin Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. This branch, referred to as the oldest branch of Buddhism, attempts to follow the\noriginal Buddha\u2019s teachings. Meditation and concentration are seen as keys to enlightenment. Spiritual forces do\nexist but it is up to the individual to attain his or her own path toward awakening.\nThe northern variety of Buddhism is associated with the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition and is often called Tibetan\nBuddhism. It has its strongest allegiance in Tibet, Western China, Bhutan, Nepal, and parts of Mongolia. Rooted\nin the Buddha\u2019s original teaching, Northern Buddhism seeks to break out of the cycle of birth, death, and\nrebirth. Spiritual techniques are often used, along with the main principle of meditation. Vajrayana Buddhism is\nconsidered by some to be a branch of Mahayana Buddhism.\nIn the east, the main form of Buddhism is the Mahayana tradition, which is most common in Japan, Taiwan,\nKorea, parts of Vietnam, and eastern China. There are various forms of the eastern traditions, including Zen\nBuddhism. Meditative in nature, there is a strong emphasis on universal compassion, altruism, and selflessness.\nConsidered by many to be compatible with other religions, it is often touted as more a lifestyle than a religion. The\nmeditative activities are often said to focus on calming the body and mind, which can provide a positive outcome\nfor anyone seeking inner direction, even those following other religions.\nAll branches of Buddhism teach nonviolence, honesty, selflessness, tolerance, and moral living. Buddhism holds\nto the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path (The Middle Way) to enlightenment. Suffering is a standard\ncomponent of humanity. Only through the Eightfold Path to enlightenment is freedom from suffering possible.\nEnlightenment comes through wisdom, ethical conduct, and meditation. Buddhism has become the world\u2019s fourth\nmain religion, with most of its followers in Asia. 813 World Regional Geography\nThe Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path\nThe Four Noble Truths\n1. Suffering exists.\n2. Suffering arises from attachment to desires.\n3. Suffering ceases when desire ceases.\n4. Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path.\nThe Middle Way or Eightfold Path\nAttainable through wisdom\n1. Right view\n2. Right intention\nAttainable through ethical conduct\n3. Right speech\n4. Right action\n5. Right livelihood\nAttainable through meditation\n6. Right effort\n7. Right mindfulness\n8.

The\nMogul Empire dominated northern India for centuries and is an example of the Islamic presence in the region.\nIndia has the largest Muslim minority in the world. In 2010, India had an estimated population of 140 million\nMuslims, which made up about 14 percent of the population. India has the third-largest Muslim population in the\nworld, after Indonesia and Pakistan. Most Muslims in India live in the north along the Ganges River Basin and\nin Nepal. There is also a large Muslim population in eastern India near the border with Bangladesh. Kashmir, in\nnorthern India, also continues to hold a significant Muslim population.\nChristianity\nChristianity is India\u2019s third-largest religion, practiced by about 3 percent of the population. Christianity is a\nmonotheistic religion following the teachings of Jesus Christ that originated in the Middle East. Tradition has it\nthat Christianity first came to India through first-century CE missionary activity linked to the Apostle Thomas,\nand later arrived to other parts of India through the activities of western missionaries from 1500 CE onward. A\nmajor Christian stronghold is the state and city of Goa on the southwest coast, a colony of Portugal from the 1500s\nto the mid-1900s. There is also a strong Christian presence in eastern India, in the region bordering Myanmar. 815 World Regional Geography\nJainism\nJainism or Jain Dharma is a spiritual, religious, and philosophical tradition in India that dates back to about the\nninth century BCE. Jains (followers of Jainism) believe that their religion\u2019s origins extend back to the distant past.\nA Jain is a follower of Jinas (the saints), who are humans who have rediscovered the dharma (or the way) and\nhave become fully liberated. These Jinas can then teach this spiritual path to other people. A major characteristic\nof Jainism is the emphasis on the consequences of physical and mental behavior. There are about five million\nJains in India, and others around the world.\nGreat care must be taken while going about one\u2019s daily life, as Jains believe that everything is alive and that many\nbeings (including pests such as insects) possess a soul. All life is considered worthy of respect and all life is equal\nand deserves protection, especially the life of the world\u2019s smallest creatures. While in India, you can recognize\nJains, because many of the strictest adherents will wear masks to prevent themselves from inhaling insects and\nthus destroying the insects\u2019 souls. Jains are a religious minority, with around five million followers in modern-day\nIndia.\nAll followers of Jainism are vegetarians. Their diet is part of the practice of nonviolence at the heart of their\nreligion. They will eat only food items such as fresh fruit, vegetables, cereals, and legumes. Most root vegetables\nsuch as potatoes and onions are avoided by the more devout because of the harm that would be done to the plants\nthemselves or other organisms in the soil when the roots are pulled. Additionally, Jainists will not eat honey,\nconsume any food that may have fermented overnight, or drink water that has not been filtered.\nSikhism\nSikhism was previously discussed in the section on the Punjab, the region at the center of the Sikh community.\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion centered on justice and faith. In Sikhism, salvation can be obtained through\ndevotion to God and through disciplined meditation. There is a high importance placed on the principle of equality\nbetween all people in the Sikh religion. There should be no discrimination on the basis of gender, creed, caste, or\nethnicity; every person is equal. The writings of former Sikh gurus are the basis for the religion. The center of the\nSikh religion is found in the Golden Temple, in the city of Amritsar, in the Punjab. This is where Sikhs gather to\nunite in the faith and associate with each other. There are about twenty-six million Sikhs in the world, and about\nthree-fourths of them live in the Punjab state of India. 9.5 Religions of India and South Asia 816\nBaha\u2019i Faith\nFigure 9.41 Baha\u2019i Faith\u2019s Lotus Temple in New Delhi\nIndia has the largest population of Baha\u2019i in the world.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Baha\u2019i Faith is found in many large urban areas of the Indian Subcontinent, particularly New Delhi, where a\nlarge temple complex is found. This temple is commonly known as the \u201cLotus Temple\u201d based on its shape, which\nlooks like a large lotus flower. Two million Baha\u2019is live within India, which has the largest population of Baha\u2019is\nin the world. Iran has the second-highest Baha\u2019i population in the world. There is also a major Baha\u2019i temple and\ncenter in Haifa, Israel. The Baha\u2019i Faith was founded by Baha\u2019u\u2019llah in Persia (Iran) during the nineteenth century\nCE. This religion focuses on the spiritual oneness of humanity and the unity of the other major world religions. 817 World Regional Geography\nZoroastrianism\nZoroastrianism originated in Iran (or Persia); in fact, it was once the dominant religion of Greater Iran, but it has\nnow dwindled to about two hundred thousand Zoroastrians around the world, with concentrations in Iran, India\n(primarily Mumbai), and Pakistan (primarily Karachi and Lahore). Zoroastrianism follows the teachings of the\nprophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra or Zarthosht). This philosophy acknowledges the divine authority of\nAhura Mazda (Mazdaism) as proclaimed by Zoroaster. One of the tangible forms of this religion is the use of fire\nas a purifying agent in ceremonies. The temples are commonly known as \u201cfire temples.\u201d Additionally, because of\na prohibition of burials of bodies in the ground, Zoroastrians allow natural exposure of bodies to the elements in\nstructures known as \u201cTowers of Silence.\u201d The greatest numbers of followers of Zoroastrianism can be found in\nIndia, with additional numbers in southern Pakistan.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Hinduism is one of the world\u2019s oldest still-practiced religions. There is no one specific path in the religion.\nHinduism is more of a religious tradition based on core concepts than it is a formal religion.\n\u2022 The caste system is a Hindu practice of placing people in social layers with similar occupations, privileges,\nand status. The untouchables are the lowest caste.\n\u2022 Buddhism was created around 535 BCE from the traditions that shaped Hinduism by Siddhartha Gautama,\nwho taught religious salvation through meditation, the rejection of earthly desires, and reverence for all life\nforms. There is no caste system in Buddhism, which has a number of branches that vary throughout Asia.\n\u2022 Islam and Christianity are the second- and third-largest religions in India but did not originate in South Asia.\nJainism and Sikhism got their start in South Asia and are still practiced by millions of people. The Baha\u2019i\nFaith and Zoroastrianism are also active in India.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What are the major religions in India in terms of population percentage?\n2.

Nepal is located along this border and is\nsomewhat of a buffer state between India and China. Nepal has a high population growth rate. Most of its\npeople work in agriculture. Deforestation is a major environmental concern and causes erosion of the\nlandscape. Landlocked and poor, Nepal struggles to maintain a stable government and adequate public\nservices.\n2. South Asia was colonized by Britain for ninety years. Colonialism brought a structured administration, a\nrailroad system of transportation, and large port cities used for the export of goods from the interior. The\npolitical borders were established for South Asia by British colonizers, based on religious affiliation and\neconomic advantages. The British elevated Sikhs from the Punjab to help rule over the Hindu and Muslim\npopulations. English is widely used as a lingua franca.\n3. Conflicts continue in mountainous Kashmir and tropical Sri Lanka. Kashmir\u2019s remote territory in the\nnorthern part of the realm is divided between Pakistan, China, and India. All three countries have nuclear\nweapons. Sri Lanka\u2019s majority Buddhist population is Sinhalese and is based in the southwest, controlling\nmost of the island. Sri Lanka\u2019s minority Tamil population is Hindu and is based out of the Jaffna Peninsula\nin the northeast. The Tamil want their own country and have claims on the island.\n4. Port cities of South Asia are centers for international trade and development. There is a wide disparity\nbetween the rural poor and the affluent elites. India has been developing a strong economy based on a\ngrowing information sector, health care, and manufacturing. Motor vehicles and computer technologies are\nemerging in India and competing worldwide. Pakistan\u2019s economy struggles under the high population\ngrowth and Islamic extremism in the country.\n5. Pakistan and Bangladesh were once under the same government. Bangladesh was formerly East Pakistan.\nThese Muslim countries have extremely high population densities and have agrarian economies. The Indus\nRiver flows through Pakistan and the two rivers of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges flow through\nBangladesh. Monsoon flooding is a serious concern for Bangladesh; earthquakes have caused serious\ndamage in Pakistan.\n6. Hindu and Buddhist traditions first developed in South Asia. India has the most of the world\u2019s Hindu\nfollowers. The concept of the caste system has created socioeconomic layers in the culture that are being\ntempered by high urbanization rates. Buddhism has a number of branches that can be geographically\nidentified as eastern, northern, and southern. Bhutan and Sri Lanka have Buddhist majorities. South Asia is\n818 819 World Regional Geography\nalso home to Sikhism and Jainism. Islam is strong in South Asia: Pakistan is the world\u2019s second-largest\nMuslim country, India has the world\u2019s third-largest Muslim population, and Bangladesh is a Muslim country\nas well. South Asia is also home to a Christian minority in addition to various other minority religious\ngroups. Chapter 10: East Asia\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nEast Asia is a large expanse of territory with China as its largest country. The countries of Mongolia, North and\nSouth Korea, and Japan are China\u2019s neighbors. The island of Taiwan, off the eastern coast of China, has an\nindependent government that has been separated from mainland China since shortly after World War II. On the\nsouthern coast of China is Hong Kong, a former British possession with one of the best ports in Asia. Under an\nagreement of autonomy, Hong Kong and its port were turned over to the Chinese government in 1997. Next door,\nto the west of Hong Kong, is the former Portuguese colony of Macau, which has also been returned to Chinese\ncontrol. In western China is the autonomous region of Tibet, referred to by its Chinese name, Xizang. Tibet has\nbeen controlled by Communist China since 1949, shortly after the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was declared\na country. Lobbying attempts by the Dalai Lama and others for Tibetan independence have not been successful.\nThe region of Tibet has recently become more integrated with the country of China because of the immigration of\na large number of Chinese people to the Tibetan region.\nFigure 10.1 East Asia and Its Neighbors\n820 821 World Regional Geography\nChina is the largest country in East Asia in both physical size and population. Other countries of East Asia include Mongolia, North\nKorea, South Korea, and Japan. Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are associated with mainland China.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nJapan has emerged as the economic dragon of East Asia. Japanese people have a high standard of living, and\nthe country has been an industrial and financial engine for the Pacific RimThe coastal lands bordering the\nPacific Ocean.. Up and coming economic tigersQuickly emerging economic centers in Asia that now include\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. like Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea have\nalso experienced strong economic growth and are strong competitors in the global economy. Balancing out the\nadvances of the economic tigers and Japan is the extensive labor base of the Chinese people, which has catapulted\nthe Chinese economy to its position as a major player in the global economy. Left behind in the region is North\nKorea, which has isolated itself behind an authoritarian dictatorship since World War II. A number of countries\nthat were former enemies in World War II are now trading partners (e.g., China and Japan), as economic trade Chapter 10: East Asia 822\nbridges cultural gaps with common goods and services. However, cultural and political differences between these\ncountries remain.\nEast Asia is home to one-fifth of the human population. The realm\u2019s location on the Pacific Rim provides access\nfor interaction with the global economy. The location of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, just off the coast\nof mainland China, creates an industrial environment that has awakened the human entrepreneurial spirit of\nthe realm. Manufacturing has fueled the high-tech engines of the Pacific Rim economies, which have recently\ntaken advantage of the massive labor pool of the Chinese heartland. Across the Pacific from East Asia are the\nsuperpower of the United States and its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, countries that\nare both competing against and trading with the East Asian Community (EAC). The Russian realm to the north of\nEast Asia\u2014especially its Pacific port of Vladivostok\u2014continues to actively engage the East Asian nations.\nFigure 10.2 Flags of the East Asian Nations and Territories\nFrom left to right, top row: China, South Korea, and North Korea.

Outline the countries and territories that are included in East Asia. Describe the main physical features and\nclimate types of each country.\n2. Understand the relationship between physical geography and human populations in East Asia.\n3. Summarize the main objectives in building the Three Gorges Dam.\n4. Describe how colonialism impacted China. Outline the various countries and regions that were controlled by\ncolonial interests.\n5. Outline the three-way split in China after its revolution and where each of the three groups ended up.\nPhysical Geography\nEast Asia is surrounded by a series of mountain ranges in the west, Mongolia and Russia in the north, and\nSoutheast Asia to the south. The Himalayas border Tibet and Nepal; the Karakoram Ranges, Pamirs, and the\nTian Shan Mountains shadow Central Asia; and the Altay Mountains are next to Russia. The Himalayan\nMountains are among the highest mountain ranges in the world, and Mt. Everest is the planet\u2019s tallest peak.\nThese high ranges create a rain shadow effect, generating the dry arid conditions of type B climates that dominate\nwestern China. The desert conditions of western China give rise to a large uninhabitable region in its center.\nMelting snow from the high elevations feeds many of the streams that transition into the major rivers that flow\ntoward the east.\nCreated by tectonic plate action, the many mountain ranges are also home to earthquakes and tremors that are\ndevastating to human livelihood. The Indian tectonic plate is still pushing northward into the Eurasian plate,\nforcing the Himalayan ranges upward. With an average elevation of fifteen thousand feet, the Tibetan Plateau\nis the largest plateau region of the world. It has high elevations and type H climates. The plateau is sparsely\npopulated and the only places with human habitation are the river valleys. Lhasa is the largest city of the sparsely\n824 825 World Regional Geography\npopulated region. Sometimes called \u201cthe Roof of the World,\u201d the Tibetan Plateau is a land of superlatives. The\nsmall amount of precipitation that occurs often comes in the form of hailstorms mixed with wind. Its landscape is\ngenerally rocky and barren.\nThe vast arid regions of western China extend into the Gobi Desert between Mongolia and China. Colder type\nD climates dominate the Mongolian steppe and northern China. The eastern coast of the Asian continent is home\nto islands and peninsulas, which include Taiwan and the countries of Japan and North and South Korea. North\nKorea\u2019s type D climates are similar to the northern tier of the United States, comparable to North Dakota. Taiwan\nis farther south, producing a warmer tropical type A climate. The mountainous islands of Japan have been formed\nas a result of tectonic plates and are prone to earthquakes. Since water moderates temperature, the coastal areas of\nEast Asia have more moderate temperatures than the interior areas do. A type C climate is dominant in Japan, but\nthe north has a colder type D climate. The densely populated fertile river valleys of central and southeastern China\nare matched by contrasting economic conditions. Rich alluvial soils and moderate temperatures create excellent\nfarmland that provides enormous food production to fuel an ever-growing population.\nMost of China\u2019s population lives in its eastern region, called China Proper, with type C climates, fresh water, and\ngood soils. China Proper has dense population clusters that correspond to the areas of type C climate that extend\nsouth from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Around the world, most humans have gravitated toward type C climates.\nThese climates have produced fertile agricultural lands that provide an abundance of food for the enormous\nChinese population. To the south the temperatures are warmer, with hot and humid summers and dry, warm\nwinters. The climates of China Proper are conducive for human habitation, which has transformed the region into\na highly populated human community. The North China Plain at the mouth of the Yellow River (Huang He\nRiver) has rich farmland and is the most densely populated region in China.\nNorthwest of Beijing is Inner Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, a desert that extends into the independent country\nof Mongolia. Arid type B climates dominate the region all the way to the southern half of Mongolia. The\nnorthern half of Mongolia is colder with continental type D climates. In the higher elevations of the highlands in\nwestern Mongolia, there is a section of type H highland climates. Its climate and location identify Mongolia as\na landlocked country in the northern latitudes with a low level of precipitation. The areas of type D climate that\nextend north from Beijing through Northeast China at times receive more precipitation than northern Mongolia.\nNortheast China features China\u2019s great forests and excellent agricultural land. Many of China\u2019s abundant natural\nmineral resources are found in this area. Balancing mineral extraction with the preservation of agricultural land\nand timber resources is a perennial issue.\nLying north of the Great Wall and encompassing the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia is the vast Mongolian\nsteppe, which includes broad flat grasslands that extend north into the highlands. North China includes the Yellow\nRiver basin as well as the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. Areas around parts of the Yellow River are superb\nagricultural lands, including vast areas of loess that have been terraced for cultivation. Loess is an extremely fine\nsilt or windblown soil that is yellow in color in this region. Deciduous forests continue to exist in this region,\ndespite aggressive clearcutting for agricultural purposes. The Great Wall of China rests atop hills in this region.\nMost of western China is arid, with a type B climate. Western China has large regions like the Takla Makan\nDesert that are uninhabited and inhospitable because of hot summers and long cold winters exacerbated by the\ncold winds sweeping down from the north. In a local Uyghur language, the name Takla Makan means \u201cYou will\ngo in but you will not go out.\u201d To the far west are the high mountains bordering Central Asia that restrict travel 10.1 Introducing the Realm 826\nand trade with the rest of the continent. Northwestern China is a mountainous region featuring glaciers, deserts,\nand basins.\nFigure 10.3 China and Its Main Climate Regions\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nThe central portion of China Proper is subtropical. This large region includes the southern portion of the Yangtze\nRiver (Chang Jiang River) and the cities of Shanghai and Chongqing. Alluvial processes give this area excellent\nagricultural land. Its climate is warm and humid in the summers with mild winters; monsoons create well-defined\nsummer rainy seasons. Tropical China lies in the extreme south and includes Hainan Island and the small islands\nthat neighbor it. Annual temperatures are higher here than in the subtropical region and rainfall amounts brought\nby the summer monsoons are at times very substantial. This area is characterized by low mountains and hills. 827 World Regional Geography\nRiver Basins of China\nThere are two major river systems that provide fresh water to the vast agricultural regions of the central part of\nChina Proper. The Yellow River (Huang He River) is named after the light-colored silt that washes into the river. It\nflows from the Tibetan highlands through the North China Plain into the Yellow Sea. Dams, canals, and irrigation\nprojects along the river provide water for extensive agricultural operations. Crops of wheat, sorghum, corn, and\nsoybeans are common with vegetables, fruit, and tobacco grown in smaller plots. The North China Plain has to\ngrow enough food to feed its one thousand people per square mile average density. This plain does not usually\nproduce a food surplus because of the high demand from the large population of the region. Beijing borders\nthe North China Plain. Its nearest port, Tianjin, continues to expand and grow, creating an economic center of\nindustrial activity that relies on the peripheral regions for food and raw materials. Cotton is an example of a key\nindustrial crop grown here.\nThe Yangtze River (Chang Jiang River) flows out of the Tibetan Plateau through the Sichuan Province, through\nthe Three Gorges region and its lower basin into the East China Sea. Agricultural production along the river\nincludes extensive rice and wheat farming. Large cities are located on this river, including Wuhan and Chongqing.\nNanjing and Shanghai are situated near the delta on the coast. Shanghai is the largest city in China and is a\ngrowing metropolis. The Three Gorges Dam of the Yangtze River is the world\u2019s largest dam. It produces a\nlarge percentage of the electricity for central China. Oceangoing ships can travel up the Yangtze to Wuhan and,\nutilizing locks in the Three Gorges Dam, these cargo vessels can travel all the way upriver to Chongqing. The\nYangtze River is a valuable and vital transportation corridor for the transport of goods between periphery and core\nand between the different urban centers of activity. Sichuan is among the top five provinces in China in terms of\npopulation and is dependent on the Yangtze River system to provide for its needs and connect it with the rest of\nChina.\nFigure 10.4 China and Its Main Population Regions 10.1 Introducing the Realm 828\nThe region of eastern China that is favorable to large populations is called China Proper. River basins historically produce abundant\nfood, which in turn leads to concentrated populations.\nNortheast China was formerly known as Manchuria, named after the Manchu ethnic group that had dominated\nthe region in Chinese history. Two river basins create a favorable industrial climate for economic activity. The\nlower Liao River Basin and the Songhua River Basin cut through Northeast China. The cities of Harbin and\nShenyang are industrial centers located on these rivers. This region is known as the Northeast China Plain. It\nhas extensive farming activities located next to an industrial landscape of smokestacks, factories, and warehouses.\nConsiderable mineral wealth and iron ore deposits in the region have augmented the industrial activities and have\ncreated serious environmental concerns because of excessive air and water pollution. In its zenith in the 1970s,\nthis was China\u2019s main steel production area, but the region is being reduced to a rustbelt since many of China\u2019s\nmanufacturing centers are now being developed in the southern regions of China Proper.\nThe southernmost region of China Proper is home to the Pearl River Basin, an important agricultural and\ncommercial district. Though smaller in size than the Yangtze River Basin, major global urban centers are located\non its estuary, where the mouth of the river flows into the South China Sea. The system includes the Xi River,\nPearl River, and their tributaries. As the third-longest river system in China, these rivers process an enormous\namount of water, and have the second-highest volume of water flow after the Yangtze. Guangzhou, Macau, and\nHong Kong are the largest cities located here, alongside the rapidly expanding industrial center of Shenzhen. As\nmentioned earlier, Macau was a former Portuguese colony and Hong Kong was a former British colony. These\nurban areas are now hubs for international trade and global commerce. Guangzhou is one of the largest cities in\nChina, along with Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, and Tianjin. Cantonese heritage and traditions form a foundation for\nthe cultural background of the people who live here. 829 World Regional Geography\nFigure 10.5 Xi-Pearl River System\nAn estuary is a wide area at the mouth of a river where it meets the sea. Hong Kong is located on the eastern side of the Pearl River\nEstuary, and the former Portuguese colony of Macau is located on the western side of the waterway.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThree Gorges Dam (The New China Dam)\nThe Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is known in China as the New China Dam. Its hydroelectric production\nsystem is the largest on Earth. The river system is the world\u2019s third longest, after the Nile and the Amazon. Ideas for this\nproject go back to the days just after the last dynasty fell. Plans and development began in the decades before 1994,\nwhen the construction of the dam began. The main purposes of the dam are to control the massive flooding along the\nYangtze, produce hydroelectric power, and increase shipping capacity along the river. 10.1 Introducing the Realm 830\nFigure 10.6 Three Gorges Dam Region\nThe Yangtze River flows through three deep gorges where a dam has been constructed to stabilize flooding, produce electricity, and support river\ntransportation.\n\u2022 Dam length: 7,661 feet\n\u2022 Dam height: 610 feet\n\u2022 Dam width (at base): 377 feet\n\u2022 Physical construction began: December 14, 1994\n\u2022 Construction cost: estimated thirty-nine billion US dollars\n\u2022 Estimated surface area of reservoir: 403 square miles\n\u2022 Estimated length of reservoir: 375 miles\n\u2022 Capacity of thirty-two generators totaling 22,500 MW (equivalent to about twenty nuclear power plants the\nsize of the Watts Bar 1, the newest US nuclear reactor)\nBefore construction of the dam, flooding along the Yangtze cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damage. In\n1954, the river flooded, causing the deaths of more than thirty-three thousand people and displacing an additional\neighteen million people. The giant city of Wuhan was flooded for three months. In 1998, a similar flood caused billions\nof dollars in damage, flooded thousands of acres of farmland, resulted in more than 1,526 deaths, and displaced more\nthan 2.3 million people. The dam was rigorously tested in 2009, when a massive flood worked its way through the\nwaterway. The dam was able to withstand the pressure by containing the excess water and controlling the flow 831 World Regional Geography\ndownstream. The dam saved many lives and prevented billions of dollars in potential damage. The savings in human\nlives and in preventing economic damage are projected to outweigh the cost of the dam in only a few decades.\nThe dam produces most of the electricity for the lower Yangtze Basin, including Shanghai, the largest city in China.\nFive years of the dam producing electricity has already paid for about one-third of its construction costs, which is\nequivalent to burning approximately 150 million tons of coal (depending on coal quality). This reduces the emission of\nmillions of tons of carbon dioxide, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which reduces air pollution and does\nnot contribute to climate change. Heavy freight traffic on the Yangtze was the norm even before the dam was built; in\nfact, it has the highest rates of transport of any river. The building of the dam has augmented the amount of freight\ntraffic.\nFigure 10.7\nChina\u2019s Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is the largest dam in the world.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAll the positive attributes of the Three Gorges Dam have contributed to the economic development of China. This is a\ntestimony to the engineering and technological capacity of the nation. However, this project has also created its own\nproblems and negative impacts on culture and the environment. By 2008, the number of people forced to relocate from\nthe flooding of the reservoir had reached 1.24 million. Historic villages and hundreds of archaeological sites were\nflooded. Thousands of farmers had to be relocated to places with less productive soils. Compensation to the farmers for\nrelocation was forfeited because of corruption and fraud. Sadly, much of the scenic beauty of the river basin is now\nunder water. 10.1 Introducing the Realm 832\nAnimal species like the critically endangered Siberian Cranes, who had wintered in the former wetlands of the river, had\nto find habitat elsewhere. The endangered Yangtze River Dolphin has been doomed to extinction because of the dam\nand the amplified river activity. The dam restricts the flushing of water pollution and creates a massive potential for\nlandslides along its banks, exacerbating the potential for the silting in of the reservoir and the clogging of the dam\u2019s\nturbines. The dam also sits on a fault zone and there is concern that the massive weight of the water in the reservoir\ncould trigger earthquakes that may destroy the dam, with catastrophic consequences. Large development projects tend\nto have an enormous impact on the people and the environment that inhabit their shadow. The building of the Three\nGorges Dam has created controversy, with strong arguments on both sides of the issues. To further complicate the\nsituation, other large dams are being proposed or are under construction along the same river.\nChinese Dynasties and Colonialism\nThe earliest Chinese dynasty dates to around 2200 BCE. It was located in the rich North China Plain. Organized\nas a political system, Chinese dynasties created the Chinese state, which provided for a continuous transfer of\npower, ideas, and culture from one generation to another. From 206 to 220 CE, the Han Dynasty established the\nChinese identity; Chinese people became known as People of Han or Han Chinese. The last dynasty, the Qing\n(Manchu) Dynasty, which ruled between 1644 and 1911, claimed control of a region including all of China,\nMongolia, Southeast Asia, and Korea. Dynastic rule ended in China in 1911.\nFigure 10.8 The Great Wall of China 833 World Regional Geography\nConstruction started in the seventh century BCE and, including all its branches, the wall is about 5,500 miles long.\nMatt Barber \u2013 Great Wall of China \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nEuropeans colonized the Americas, Africa, and South Asia, and it was only a matter of time before technology,\nlarger ships, and the European invasion reached East Asia. European colonialism arrived in China during the\nQing Dynasty. China had been an industrialized state for centuries; long before the empires of Rome and Greece\nwere at their peak, China\u2019s industrial cities flourished with the concepts of clean drinking water, transportation,\nand technology. Paper, gunpowder, and printing were used in China centuries before they arrived in Europe. The\nSilk Road, which crossed the often dangerous elevations of the high mountain passes, was the main link between\nChina and Europe.\nEuropean colonial powers met tough resistance in China. They were kept at bay for years. Meanwhile, the\nIndustrial Revolution in Europe, which cranked out mass-produced products at a cheap price, provided an\nadvantage over Chinese production. British colonizers also exported opium, an addictive narcotic, from their\ncolonies in South Asia to China to help break down Chinese culture. By importing tons of opium into China, the\nBritish were able to instigate social problems. The first Opium Wars of 1839\u20131842 ended with Britain gaining\nan upper hand and laying claim to most of central China. Other European powers also sought to gain a foothold\nin China. Portugal gained the port of Macau. Germany took control of the coastal region of the rich North China\nPlain. France carved off part of southern China and Southeast Asia. Russia came from the north to lay claim to\nthe northern sections of China. Japan, which was just across the waterfront from China, took control of Korea and\nthe island of Formosa (now called Taiwan). Claims on China increased as colonialism moved in to take control\nof the Chinese mainland.\nThough European powers laid claim to parts of China, they often fought among themselves. China did not produce\nheavy military weapons as early as the Europeans did and therefore could not fend them off upon their invasion.\nChinese culture, which had flourished for four thousand years, quickly eroded through outside intrusion. It was\nnot until about 1900, when a rebellion against foreigners (known as the Boxer Rebellion) was organized by the 10.1 Introducing the Realm 834\nChinese people, that the conflict reached recognizable dimensions. The Qing Dynasty dissolved in 1911, which\nalso signified an end to the advancements of European colonialism, even though European colonies remained in\nChina.\nThree-Way Split in China\nEuropean colonialism in China slowed after 1911, and World War I severely weakened European powers. The\nJapanese colonizers, on the other hand, continued to make advancements. Japan did not have far to travel to\nresupply troops and support its military. In China, a doctor by the name of Dr. Sun Yat-sen promoted an\nindependent Chinese Republic, free from dynastic rule, Japan, or European colonial influence. Political parties\nof Nationalists and Communists also worked to establish the republic. Dr. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925. The\nNationalists, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, defeated the Communists and established a national\ngovernment. Foreigners were evicted. The Communists were driven out of politics.\nFigure 10.9 Taiwan Currency 835 World Regional Geography\nBoth the Republic of China (ROC) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) consider Dr. Sun Yat-sen to be a famous Chinese\nhistorical figure.\nRichard winchell \u2013 Museum of Australian Currency Notes \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nNationalists, Communists, and Japan conducted a three-way war over the control of China. Japan\u2019s military took\ncontrol of parts of Northeast China, known as Manchuria, and were making advancements on the eastern coast.\nNationalists defeated the Communists for power and were pushing them into the mountains. The Chinese people\nwere in support of the two parties working together to defeat the Japanese. The Long March of 1934 was a six-\nthousand-mile retreat by the Communists through rural China, pursued by Nationalist forces. The people of the\ncountryside gave aid to the efforts of the Communists. The Chinese were primarily interested in the defeat of\nJapan, a country that was brutally killing massive numbers of China\u2019s people in their aggressive war.\nFigure 10.10 The Three-Way Split of China and the Emergence of Communist China in 1949 10.1 Introducing the Realm 836\nIn 1945, the defeat of Japan in World War II by the United States changed many things. Japan\u2019s admission of\ndefeat prompted the end of Japanese control of territory in China, Taiwan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific.\nBy 1948, the Communists, who were becoming well organized, were defeating the Nationalists. Chiang Kai-shek\ngathered his people and what Chinese treasures he could and fled by boat to the island of Formosa (Taiwan),\nwhich in 1945 had just been freed from Japan. Taiwan was declared the official Republic of China (ROC).\nThe Communists took over the mainland government. In 1949, Communist leader Mao Zedong declared the\nestablishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with its capital in Peking (Beijing). Japan was devastated\nby US bombing and defeated in World War II; its infrastructure destroyed and its colonies lost, Japan had to begin\nthe long process of rebuilding its country. Korea was finally liberated from the Chinese dynasties and Japanese\ncolonialism but began to experience an internal political division. Political structures in the second half of the\ntwentieth century in East Asia were vastly different from the political structures that had been in place when the\ncentury began.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 China is the largest country in physical area and in population in East Asia. The realm is isolated by the high\nmountains in the west, which cause a major rain shadow and desert conditions in the western regions.\nMongolia is the only landlocked country. The other countries and territories are located along the Pacific\nRim. 837 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 Robust population growth has been supported by adequate food production in the major river valleys and\ncoastal regions of East Asia. Coastal areas receive adequate precipitation and allow access to fishing for\nhuman activities.\n\u2022 The Three Gorges Dam was constructed on the Yangtze River to control flooding, generate electricity, and\nsupport shipping. The dam is the largest in the world. Downsides of the dam have included the relocation of\nhuman settlements, erosion, and other environmental concerns.\n\u2022 Colonialism infiltrated China and challenged its last dynasty. By 1911, both the dynasty and European\ncolonialism were in demise. In a three-way battle for power in China, the Communists emerged in 1949 to\ntake control. The Nationalists fled to Formosa to form their own government.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. Outline the countries or territories that make up the region known as East Asia.\n2.

Outline the location of the political units of China with the autonomous regions and special administrative\nunits. Establish the connection between the autonomous regions and ethnicity.\n3.

Describe how China has shifted its economic policies and structure in the past few decades. Outline the\nchanges in economic development with China\u2019s open door to Western trade.\n5. Sketch out the historical geopolitical objectives of China and how they relate to China today.\nThe Emergence of Modern China\nChina is the world\u2019s largest Communist country. Isolated from Europeans and Central Asians by the Himalayas\nand other high mountain ranges, Chinese culture has endured for thousands of years. Rich in history, adventure,\nand intrigue, a tour through China would reveal a people with a deep, longstanding love of the land, traditions as\nold as recorded history, and a spirit of commerce and hard work that sustains them to this day. China is about the\nsame land size as the United States, although technically it is slightly smaller than the United States in total area,\ndepending on how land and water areas are calculated. China only has an eastern coast, whereas the United States\nhas both an eastern and a western coast. If you recall the climate types and the relationship between climate and\npopulation, you can deduce the location of the heavily populated regions of China.\nThe form of Communism promoted by Mao Zedong was not the same as the type of Communism practiced in\nthe Soviet Union. Various Communist experiments were forced upon the Chinese people, with disastrous results.\nFor example, in 1958, the Great Leap Forward was announced. In this program, people were divided into\n839 10.2 Emerging China 840\ncommunes, and peasant armies were to work the land while citizens were asked to donate their pots and pans to\nproduce scrap metal and increase the country\u2019s industrial output. The goal was to improve production and increase\nefficiency. The opposite occurred, and millions of Chinese died of starvation during this era.\nAnother disaster began in 1966 and continued until Mao died in 1976. The Great Proletarian Cultural\nRevolution wreaked havoc on four thousand years of Chinese traditional culture in a purge of elitism and a drive\ntoward total loyalty to the Communist Party. Armies of indoctrinated students were released into the countryside\nand the cities to report anyone opposing the party line. Schools were closed, universities were attacked, and\nintellectuals were killed. Anyone suspected of subversion might be tortured into signing a confession. Violence,\nanarchy, and economic disaster followed this onslaught of anti-Democratic terror. Estimates vary, but most\nsources indicate that about thirty million people lost their lives during the Mao Zedong era through purges,\nstarvation, and conflict.\nDuring the early decades of Communism in China, all travel into or out of China was severely restricted by the\nso-called Bamboo Curtain. The United States had backed the nationalist movement during the Chinese Civil War\nand continued to support Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa (Taiwan). The United States did not recognize Communist\nChina; the US embassy was in Taiwan, not in Beijing. As China was experiencing its disastrous experiments with\nCommunism, the core economic areas of the world were advancing with commercial technology and high-tech\nelectronics and sending rockets to the moon. China lagged behind in its industrial activities and became a country\nbased on agriculture. A visit to China by US president Richard Nixon in 1972 signaled the opening of diplomatic\nrelations with the United States and was also viewed as a Cold War move against the Soviet Union.\n\u2022 1949 \u2013 Communist China\n\u2022 1958 \u2013 Great Leap Forward (Backward)\n\u2022 1966 \u2013 Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\n\u2022 1972 \u2013 Richard Nixon visits China (open door)\n\u2022 1980s \u2013 Four Modernizations (Deng Xiaoping)\n\u2022 1990s \u2013 Growth of Enterprise and Industry\n\u2022 2000+ \u2013 A New Century (Trade with the West)\nThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s approach when it took power was to institute a \u201cplanned economy.\u201d A planned\neconomy, sometimes called a command economy, stands in marked contrast to a market economy. In a planned\neconomy, the government controls all aspects of the economy, including what goods and products should be\nproduced, how much of each should be produced, how products will be sold or distributed and for what (if any)\nprice, who should have jobs and what jobs they should have, how much people will be paid, and all other decisions\nrelated to the economy. In a planned economy, businesses are nationalized; that is, businesses are owned by the\ngovernment rather than by any private entity. By contrast, in a market economy, businesses are privately owned,\nand most decisions are driven by consumer and investor behavior.\nThe decade of the 1980s was a transition for China in that there was a shift of focus from China\u2019s Communist\neconomy to a more market-oriented economy. The economic collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s\ncoincided with the opening of China to trade with the West. In 1992, China announced that it would transition 841 World Regional Geography\nto a socialist market economy, a hybrid of a Communist-planned economy and a market economy. A series of\nstatements by China\u2019s political leaders suggested that in order for China to enjoy a more mature form of socialism,\ngreater national wealth was needed. They further indicated that socialism and poverty should not be considered\nsynonymous and that the country was ready to turn its attention to increasing the wealth and quality of life of\nits citizens. During the next decade, China experienced an enormous growth in its economy. At the beginning\nof this century, China was ranked in the top five of the world\u2019s largest trading nations, joining ranks with the\nUnited States, Germany, Japan, and France. The sheer size of China\u2019s population contributes to the magnitude of\nits economy. This does not, however, mean that most of China\u2019s population has a high standard of living.\nPolitical Units\nChina can be divided into regions utilizing various criteria: political regions, economic regions, natural regions,\nand climatic regions to name a few. The Communist government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is\nmade up of a number of types of political units. The main region of China Proper includes twenty-two provinces,\nincluding the island province of Hainan in the south. The island formerly known as Formosa, now called Taiwan,\nis considered by China to be its twenty-third province but in actuality remains under its own government\u2014the\nRepublic of China (ROC). Mainland China includes five autonomous regions, each with a designated minority\ngroup; four municipalities; and two special administrative regions (SARs) that hold considerable autonomy. All\nbut Taiwan are included in the region called mainland China, except the SARs Hong Kong and Macau.\nThe autonomous regions exist as a kind of a compromise between China and the regions that would prefer to be\ntotally independent and that have large non-Han or ethnic minority populations. These five autonomous regions\nare Tibet, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia. It should be noted that \u201cautonomous\u201d is how China\nwould describe these regions, but that description is arguable. In reality, the autonomous regions have very little\nlegal ability to govern themselves and, in fact, have in some ways less autonomy than the provinces to pass their\nown legislation.\nFour of China\u2019s cities have governance structures that are roughly on par with that of the provinces. The directly\ncontrolled municipalities are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing and encompass large geographic areas\nwell beyond the city limits, including towns, villages, and rural areas.\nThe two SARs of China are Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong was part of the British Empire and later a British\nprotectorate until its governance reverted to China in 1997. Known informally under Chinese law as \u201cone country,\ntwo systems,\u201d Hong Kong and Macau are guaranteed a great degree of autonomy for at least the first fifty years 10.2 Emerging China 842\nafter the transfer from Britain to China. China is responsible for defense and some portions of foreign affairs,\nwhile Hong Kong and Macau are responsible for most other matters of state, including their legal systems, law\nenforcement, immigration laws, monetary systems, customs policies, and others.\nFigure 10.12 China and Its Administrative Divisions, Including Autonomous Regions, Municipalities, and SARs\nChina\u2019s Communist government is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is protected and guaranteed power by the\ncountry\u2019s constitution. Compared to the more open democratic political systems of Western Europe and North America, China is\nconsidered an authoritarian state, complete with heavy restrictions on the Internet, the press, freedom of assembly, reproductive\nrights, and freedom of religion. Economic trade with the West has created more openness with travel and business, which has begun\nto challenge or erode the hard-line politics of decades past. 843 World Regional Geography\nThe People\nPopulation\nWith four thousand years of culture to build on, China continues to press forward into the twenty-first century. In\n2010, China had more people than any other country in the world, about 1.33 billion. Most of its people live in\nChina Proper, in the eastern regions of the country. China Proper has the best agricultural lands in the country, the\nmost fertile river basins, and the most moderate climates. For perspective, China has over one billion more people\nthan the United States, with most of those people living in the southeastern portion of China. During Mao\u2019s time,\nthere was little concern for population growth, but in recent decades China has implemented measures to deal\nwith its teeming population.\nThe government of China has taken the responsibility to address its growing population and the country\u2019s ability to\nprovide for the needs of the additional populace. In 1978, China implemented the one-child-only statute, limiting\nfamily size to one child. The policy allows for exemptions under certain conditions. Couples living in rural areas\nand people of minority status are two examples of exempted conditions and may be permitted more than one child,\nespecially if the first child is a girl. Peripheral administrative regions like Macau and Hong Kong are exempt.\nThe one-child-only policy was implemented in an attempt to address environmental, economic, and social issues\nrelated to population growth. This policy has helped reduce China\u2019s potential population by hundreds of millions\nof people, but the controversial policy has not been easy to implement or make effective. There are growing\nconcerns regarding the policy\u2019s negative impact on society. In response to the one-child-only policy, there have\nbeen reports of female infanticide and a higher number of abortions. However, surveys taken by independent\nagencies indicate that about three-fourths of China\u2019s population supports it.\nEconomic incentives pressure families to abide by the one-child-only policy. Government benefits and social\nprograms offer incentives that may be lost if couples have more than one child. Enforcement of the policy has\nbeen left to the provincial authorities with varying levels of success. Parents eager to have a boy to carry on the\nfamily name might abort a female baby. Though now illegal, the use of ultrasound equipment to determine the\ngender of a fetus is widespread. Some provinces in China have a severe shortage of women because of the policy;\nmen in provinces where women are scarce may have to migrate to find a wife. In China there are more boys\nborn than girls; the ratio averages more than 10 percent more boys than girls, with some provinces reaching more\nthan 25 percent. This imbalance creates cultural issues that may have a negative impact on traditional society. 10.2 Emerging China 844\nConventional society is challenged when there are a large number of unmarried young men in an area that may\nnot have adequate employment opportunities for them or available women for potential marriage.\nFigure 10.13 Young Girl and Her Grandfather in Southern China\nThe one-child-only policy eliminates brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, and uncles in an extended family.\nSusan Sermoneta \u2013 proud grandpa \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nMore than 50 percent of China\u2019s population lives in rural areas, meaning there is potential for high levels of\nrural-to-urban migration. The core industrial cities located in China Proper attract migrants in a periphery-to-core\nmigration pattern. China hopes that this urbanization and industrial activity will also support their population\ncontrol methods and fuel the industrial labor base. China\u2019s urbanization increased at an unprecedented rate from\n17 percent in 1978 to 47 percent in 2010. This rural-to-urban shift has been one of the largest in human history. It 845 World Regional Geography\nstill continues; many workers shift from holding temporary employment in the cities to returning to their families\nin the countryside between jobs.\nEthnic Groups\nHan Chinese is the largest ethnic group in China, with about 90 percent of the country\u2019s population. Some of the\nlargest minority groups include Zhuang (Tai) in the south, Manchu in the northeast, Mongolian in the north central\nregion, Uyghur in Western China, and Tibetan in Tibet, although many other minority groups exist. The main\nlanguage in China, Mandarin, is spoken in different ways in different parts of the country, particularly in the north\nand the south. The number of languages in China (over 290) roughly corresponds to the number of ethnic groups\nin the country. In Western China, where the percentage of Han Chinese is quite low, most of the population is\nUyghur, a group that tends to be Muslim. There are also Kazahks, Kyrgyz, and Tajiks from Central Asia, who are\nalso predominantly Muslim. In 2010, the precise number of Muslims in China was not known, but government\nreports indicated there were about twenty-one million. Other reports indicate there may be three times that many.\nMinority groups like the Uyghurs have often experienced discrimination by the Chinese government, which has\ntaken measures to marginalize minority groups to keep them in check.\nFigure 10.14 China and Its Main Ethnolinguistic Regions 10.2 Emerging China 846\nUpdated may from University of Texas Libraries.\nAs a Communist country, there is no official religion in China, nor is any supported by the Chinese government. Before Communism took control, most of the people followed\na type of Buddhism. Other belief systems included Taoism and the teachings of Confucius. Christianity does exist in China, but it is illegal to proselytize or recruit converts.\nDespite that, the Christian population in China has grown rapidly in recent decades. The exact number is unknown, but the CIA World Factbook estimates 3 to 4 percent of the\npopulation to be Christian, or somewhere between thirty-nine and fifty-two million adherents. There are many other sects and religious groups in China that have gained attention\nin recent years. Among these are the followers of Falun Gong, which emerged in the 1990s and has elements of Buddhism and Taoism in its beliefs. The group claims to be more\nof a science than a religion. The Chinese government believes otherwise and banned the Falun Gong in 1999 after the group staged a large protest against the Communist Party.\nThe crackdown by the government included many arrests and stiff prison sentences. The group is currently banned by the government.\nEconomic Summary\nIn the past two decades, China has shifted its economy from a closed system with a centrally planned, 847 World Regional Geography\ngovernment-controlled market to one with more open trade and a flexible production structure. These economic\nreforms have allowed capitalistic tendencies to drive production, have promoted increased involvement in private\nenterprise, and have increased international investment in the Chinese economy. China has phased out collective\nfarms and has increased agricultural production; the approach to free enterprise and international trade and\ninvestment has become more open; and the Chinese economy has grown at a rapid rate. Open trade and interaction\nwith the global community have allowed China to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of information\nand communication technology, and computer and Internet use in China has opened up many sectors to new\nopportunities and employment possibilities. China\u2019s policy of creating special economic zones (SEZs) has\nincreased urban and economic growth in coastal cities, fueling the strong rural-to-urban shift in the population.\nFigure 10.15\nBeijing, a metropolitan center of Chinese culture, is the capital of China. Freeway development has expanded in recent years as\nhigher incomes have allowed for automobile purchases. As a result, traffic congestion and air pollution are part of China\u2019s current\nenvironment. 10.2 Emerging China 848\nJon Phillips \u2013 Beijing \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe fast-paced growth of the Chinese economy in the past decade has brought with it some negative\nconsequences. The exploitation of resources and the heavy utilization of the environment have resulted in serious\nsoil erosion and air pollution. The water table in many parts of China has decreased because of heavy demands\non the nation\u2019s water supply. Arable land is being lost to erosion and inadequate land-use practices. Rural areas\nhave not received consideration or resources equal to the coastal cities, so conditions remain poor for most rural\npeople. Half of China\u2019s population earns the equivalent of a few dollars per day, while a fortunate few earn high\nsalaries. Unemployment is at an elevated level for tens of millions of migrants who shift from location to location,\nlooking for work. There is also an unfortunate degree of corruption within the government and state-run offices.\nCompared to Western countries, China is an authoritarian state that does not allow labor unions, free speech,\nfreedom of religion, or freedom of the press. There has been more openness in China\u2019s economic reforms and\nin travel, but other strict rules of the state remain. There is no minimum wage law for factory workers, who\nwork long hours and do not receive benefits or sick leave. There are fewer safety requirements or government\nregulations for security. China is trying to have the best of both worlds: the efficiency of an authoritarian\ngovernment and an efficient market-driven capitalist economy. Sustaining the largest standing army in the world,\nChina is geared to become a global superpower. The next great world conflict could be a cultural war between the\nUnited States and China that would involve economic, political, and human issues. To work together, the United\nStates and China would be well served to increase their understanding of each other.\nGrowth of Enterprise and Industry\nDuring the 1980s, following the death of Mao Zedong, China went through a transition period. The new leader,\nDeng Xiaoping, realized that in order for China to compete in the world market, its economy would have to be\nmodernized. The challenge was to open up to the outside without the outside placing pressure on the Communist\nsystem inside of China. The so-called Bamboo Curtain, which referred to the restriction of movement of goods\nand people across Chinese borders, diminished. To attract business and tap into the global market economy, China\nestablished SEZs along the coast at strategic port cities. SEZs attracted international corporations who wanted to\nmanufacture goods cheaply, while China\u2019s population of 1.3 billion people provided an enormous labor pool and\nconsumer market. China\u2019s modernization efforts paid off in the 1990s, when world trade increased and US trade\nwith China exploded. 849 World Regional Geography\nBy the year 2000, China had profited greatly because of its expanded manufacturing capacity. The coastal\ncities and the SEZs had become core industrial centers, attracting enormous numbers of migrants\u2014most of\nthem poor agricultural workers\u2014looking for work in the factories. Compared to other jobs, factory jobs are\nprized employment opportunities. Rural-to-urban shift has kicked in and China\u2019s urban growth is occurring at\nunprecedented rates. Chinese people are moving to the cities looking for work, just like people in many other\nareas of the world. The SEZs encourage multinational corporations to move their overseas operations to China and\ntake advantage of the lower labor and production costs. China benefits from the new business opportunities and\nby the creation of jobs for its citizens. SEZs operate under the objectives of providing tax incentives for foreign\ncompanies, exporting market-driven manufactured products, and creating joint partnerships so that everyone\nbenefits. In the past decade, four main cities have been designated as SEZs, along with the entire province\nof Hainan Island to the south. Many coastal cities were also designated as development areas for industrial\nexpansion.\nFigure 10.16 10.2 Emerging China 850\nCoastal development and SEZs along the coast of China are prompting growth of the rural-to-urban shift.\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries.\nIn 2006, the president of China called for an expansion of the economy to focus on more innovative activities.\nThe government allowed additional funding for more research in the areas of genetics and gene therapy, computer\nsoftware development, semiconductors, and alternative energy technologies. China has a high-level energy\ndemand to fuel its expanding economy and provide for a large population, so alternative energy development has\nbeen expanding into wind and solar power for both domestic and commercial purposes. China\u2019s industrial sector\nis advancing to compete in the global marketplace and muscle into the high-tech economy once dominated by\ncore areas of Japan, Western Europe, and the United States. 851 World Regional Geography\nGeopolitics\nThe political environment of China cannot be separated from its geography. To understand the larger political\npicture of China\u2019s position in the world, one has to understand China\u2019s geography. In terms of its land area,\nChina is a large country. It includes an immense peripheral region surrounding China Proper consisting of\nminority populations and buffer states. The core of China is the Han Chinese heartland of China Proper. This\nis where most of the population lives and where the best agricultural land for food production is located. The\nsurrounding periphery consists of autonomous regions and minority populations, including Tibet, Western China,\nInner Mongolia, and Northwestern China. Tibet is a buffer state between China and India; high mountains provide\na buffer between India and Tibet. Nepal, Bhutan, and Kashmir are also buffer states between China and South\nAsia. High mountain ranges extend all along China\u2019s western boundary.\nWestern China has a majority Muslim population closely aligned with ethnic groups in Central Asia. Inner\nMongolia and the independent country of Mongolia create a buffer between China and Russia. China\u2019s actual\nborder with Russia is remote and distant. Northeast China was historically called Manchuria and is home to\nthe Manchus, who are not Han Chinese. Even the isolated sovereign country of North Korea acts as a buffer\nbetween China and the world superpower of the United States through its surrogate South Korea. The border with\nSoutheast Asia is mountainous with difficult terrain and very little access. All these buffer regions insulate the Han\nheartland from the outside. China\u2019s powerbase is actually a territorial island insulated and isolated from the rest of\nthe world. Technology and trade has opened links between the Han Chinese heartland and the global marketplace.\nIn the scope of geopolitics (the study of the geography of international relations), the core of China is protected\non all fronts except one, the eastern coast. Coastal China is accessible to anyone with a ship. Coastal China is\nwhere Japan and the European colonialists such as France, Great Britain, Portugal, and Germany all came to\ncarve up China for their imperial advancements. Also located along the coast is the island of Taiwan with the\nindependent government of the ROC. Taiwan has been on friendly terms with the United States, which has posed a\nthreat to the Chinese mainland. The coast makes China vulnerable. The challenge for China has been to neutralize\nthe coastal threat and reduce its vulnerability. This is where the SEZs make a difference: the Chinese economy\nhas relied on the SEZs to attract foreign corporations to conduct their business with the Chinese in these coastal\ncities. The economic world has forged ties with the Chinese along China\u2019s coastal waters. The extensive coastal\ndevelopment creates a situation where it is now in everyone\u2019s best interest to make the coastal region of China\nsafe and prosperous.\nIn the geopolitical sense, China has historically operated under three main premises. The first premise is that\nChina must secure a buffer zone in the periphery, which includes the regions along China\u2019s borders. Second, the\ncountry needs to continue to maintain unity within the Han Chinese majority that anchors the core region of China\nProper. The third component of China\u2019s geopolitical strategy is to protect and secure its vulnerable coastal region.\nThe country needs to find a way to marginalize outside influence and keep the heartland protected from invaders.\nThese three geopolitical directives were designed before the postindustrial economy emerged with the information\nage, but the main themes of securing and protecting China remain.\nChina has additional political issues within the core region of China Proper. To maintain a unified Han Chinese\npowerbase, there should not be uneven levels of equity in the standards of living within the core region.\nManufacturing has rapidly increased in the coastal cities of the SEZs and other development areas. The standard 10.2 Emerging China 852\nof living in the coastal cities has improved, which has created a disparity between the coastal cities and the rural\nregions of the interior. Factory workers can earn the equivalent of fifty cents an hour, while their counterparts\nworking in the fields in agriculture are only making the equivalent of a few dollars per day. As a Communist\ncountry, this was one of the basic foundational principles within a socialist society\u2014the even distribution of\nwealth. It kept everyone on the same playing field, at least in theory. The more open capitalist economy is\nchanging this and challenging the equality issue.\nChina is also economically disproportionately reliant on its ability to maintain a high level of export\nmanufacturing as its method of gaining wealth. The country does not have a type of geography that holds adequate\nagricultural resources to provide for its vast population. Manufacturing requires good political and economic\nrelationships with the international community. In summary, China\u2019s eastern coast development is a risk that\nChina is forced to take. The risk is a trade-off. On one hand, the eastern coast is the most geopolitically vulnerable\nside of China, but on the other hand, it is where the most extensive economic gains have been made in recent\nyears. China\u2019s Bamboo Curtain has disappeared; the country is no longer isolated from the rest of the world.\nEconomic development has created a strong degree of dependency on other countries through the doorways of\nChina\u2019s coastal cities. China is becoming dependent on the outside world for oil, raw materials, and technology.\nMultinational corporations are dependent on China for low-cost manufactured goods. China is becoming more\nintegrated within the network of the global economy.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 China has embarked on a number of serious transitions since the Communist republic was declared in 1949.\nSince that time, the country has shifted from a command economy to a market economy and has opened up\ntrade to the West. This has opened up more opportunities for the Chinese people as well.\n\u2022 China has a number of autonomous regions and municipalities. Many of these political units are also home\nto minority ethnic groups. Han Chinese make up about 90 percent of the people of China.\n\u2022 China\u2019s large population has prompted the government to implement a one-child-only policy, which has\nresulted in a decrease in population growth but has also caused an imbalance in the percentages of boys and\ngirls being born in many of the provinces.\n\u2022 The creation of SEZs along the coast, and an open-trade policy, have rapidly developed China\u2019s\nmanufacturing sector. This trend has attracted multinational corporations to move their operations to China\nto tap into the low labor and overhead costs and receive tax incentives from the Chinese government. The\nresult has been an increase in rural-to-urban shift in China\u2019s population.\n\u2022 China\u2019s historical geopolitical situation was to secure a buffer around its heartland, unify the Han majority,\nand protect its venerable coastal region. Economic trade and interaction with the global economy has made\nChina dependent on other countries for its continual economic success.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Outline Hong Kong\u2019s progression from a British colony through the transformation into a special\nautonomous region of China. Describe why Hong Kong and Shenzhen have been important to the\ndevelopment of the Chinese economy.\n2. Understand the development of and reasons for a government for Taiwan that is separate from the\ngovernment of mainland China. Describe the current relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.\n3.

Summarize the role Mongolia played during the Cold War and learn how that role is changing as Mongolia\nbecomes more involved in the global economy.\n5. Explain why the peripheral regions of Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are important to the Chinese\ngovernment and the vitality of the country.\nThe heartland of China has always been part of China Proper. Surrounding China Proper are a number of\nautonomous regions, associated territories, and independent countries. These peripheral areas buffer China Proper\nfrom the rest of the world. They also provide China with either access to trade relationships or access to\nraw materials needed for development. Each peripheral political unit has its own unique physical and cultural\ncharacteristics and, in many cases, a minority population that is other than Han Chinese.\nHong Kong and Shenzhen\nHong Kong is a former British colony and includes a number of islands on the southern coast of China. Hong\nKong includes an excellent port, Victoria\u2014one of the best in Asia. Victoria\u2019s deepwater port is on the interior\nside of Hong Kong Island and is protected from the sea, allowing ship access to an extensive sheltered harbor\narea. To the north of Hong Kong Island is a peninsula called New Territories, which the British agreed to lease\n854 855 World Regional Geography\nfrom China in 1897 for a period of ninety-nine years. Bordering the New Territories on the mainland is the rapidly\ngrowing industrial city of Shenzhen.\nHong Kong was a major entry point into China for Britain during the colonial era. The colony was a British\noutpost that created a doorway for British expansion into China. The port allowed for an early trade relationship\nto become established. The trade relationship was broken during the Korean War in the 1950s. Britain and China\nfound themselves on opposite sides of the war. China was a newly created Communist country and sided with\nNorth Korea; Great Britain was a capitalist country and sided with South Korea. The boundary between the busy\nport of Hong Kong and China was closed. This left Hong Kong with a world-class port but no access to its main\nmarkets in China. Instead of closing the port and shutting down shipping, the business community of Hong Kong\ntook advantage of its unique situation and first-rate port to create a world trade center. Ships would import raw\nmaterials, which would be processed or manufactured into finished products. The products would then be shipped\nback out at a profit.\nFigure 10.17 The Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, with Shenzhen across the Border from the New Territories 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 856\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries .\nFrom the theory of how countries gain wealth, recall that manufacturing was traditionally the method with\nthe highest value-added profits. Hong Kong is a good example of this in action; that is, manufacturing was a\nsuccessful method of gaining wealth for Hong Kong. First, low-level goods such as clothing and textiles were\nproduced with Hong Kong\u2019s cheap labor and low costs. As business increased, higher-level technical goods were\nproduced, such as radios and other electronic products. Incomes increased. Soon, Hong Kong was a business\nand banking center trading with all global markets. International trade attracted a strong financial network that\nenhanced the free market system in Hong Kong. Business in Hong Kong attracted attention in Beijing. Chinese\nleader Deng Xiaoping, who had begun China\u2019s open door policy in the 1980s, viewed Hong Kong as a major\naccess point to establish trade and commerce with. In the 1990s, the special economic zone of Shenzhen became\nan important development area for Chinese industries and multinational corporations. China once again used\nHong Kong as a major trade corridor so that about one-fourth of all the country\u2019s imports and exports were being\nshipped through the port of Hong Kong.\nDuring the 1990s, as China actively invested in its industrial sector, it sought ways to attract the business generated\nby Taiwan and Hong Kong, two economic tigers. Opportunity came knocking in 1997 when the ninety-nine-year\nlease of the New Territories to Britain expired. China did not want to renew the lease. A deal covering all of Hong\nKong was struck between China and Great Britain. Britain would relinquish all its claims to Victoria, the port, and\nall of Hong Kong if China would allow the area to remain non-Communist and under its own autonomy for fifty 857 World Regional Geography\nyears. China agreed, and Britain left Hong Kong in 1997. Hong Kong became associated with mainland China as\na special autonomous region, but remained capitalist and democratic in its operations. This opened the door for\nTaiwan and other trading partners to increase trade with China through Hong Kong. Shenzhen, a special economic\nzone (SEZ) across the border from Hong Kong in China, was ready to capitalize on its accessibility to the port\nand the enormous trade that had been established by Hong Kong. Shenzhen became one of the fastest growing\ncities in the world and has become a center of manufacturing and trade for the global economy. It grew from a\nmoderately sized city of about three hundred fifty thousand in the early 1980s to a city of ten and half million\nby 2010, and is still growing. One of Shenzhen\u2019s largest trading partners is the Walmart Corporation, as factories\nin the city produce goods for export to the United States and sale in Walmarts around the country. Shenzhen has\nestablished a port of its own and is a magnet for international trade.\nMore than 95 percent of the seven million people living in Hong Kong are ethnically Chinese. The people have\nstrong ties to mainland China but highly value their separate and independent economic and political status. Hong\nKong is a major financial and banking center for Asia and has been working with the Chinese government to\nprovide private banking services for Chinese citizens. The small land size of Hong Kong makes it a high-priced\nreal estate destination. The cost of living is high, and space is at a premium and expensive. Nevertheless, Hong\nKong attracts millions of visitors per year and has established itself as a tourism hub for people desiring to visit\nsouthern China. Tens of millions of tourists each year use Hong Kong as a base or stopover point to enter China\u2019s\nsouthern provinces. Hong Kong offers visitors immense shopping possibilities in a safe and modern environment\nthat is attractive to people from all over the world. Cantonese is the official language, but English is widely spoken\nin Hong Kong because of Britain\u2019s influence and because of world trade relationships.\nFigure 10.18 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 858\nVictoria Harbor in Hong Kong, with its deepwater port and solid bedrock island, allows oceangoing vessels to dock right next to\nhigh-rise business and office complexes.\nShashank Khanna \u2013 Victoria Harbor, Hong Kong \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nAcross the Pearl River Estuary to the west is the former Portuguese colony of Macau. The arrangement between\nChina and the British government over Hong Kong provided a pattern that was also applied to Macau. At the\nend of 1999, Portugal relinquished its claim to Macau and the colony was turned over to the Chinese government\nunder an agreement similar to the agreement between Britain and China regarding Hong Kong. Macau was\nenabled to retain its autonomy and free-market economy for fifty years as it becomes a special administrative\nregion (SAR) of China. Macau is a much smaller territory than Hong Kong, and home to only about half a million\nresidents.\nTaiwan (ROC)\nTaiwan is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Taiwan Strait. In 2010, the population of the island, which\nis about the size of the US state of Maryland, was twenty-two million. The island is mountainous and has rugged 859 World Regional Geography\nnational parks in its interior, while most of the people in Taiwan live in bustling cities along the coast. Taiwan\u2019s\npush for good education and technical skills for its citizens has paid off in the form of high incomes and an\nindustrialized economy. After World War II, when China raised its Bamboo Curtain, the United States cut its trade\nrelations with the Communist mainland. However, the United States did trade a great deal with the Nationalists in\nTaiwan. The deep tensions that exist between China and Taiwan are easy to understand given the history that led\nto Taiwan\u2019s current existence. One of the flash points in China-Taiwan relations has been the \u201cOne China\u201d policy.\nOriginally asserted by Beijing, the principle contends that there is only one indivisible China, which encompasses\nall of China, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet.\nDuring the Cold War, the sizeable population of mainland China was attractive to US corporations that sought\ntrade with China. In 1972, for the benefit of the United States and to counter the influence of the Soviet Union,\nUS president Richard Nixon organized a visit to Beijing that opened the door to US-China diplomatic relations.\nThere were conditions placed on the open door agreement that followed. One condition that mainland China\nimposed was for the US government to recognize the Communist government in Beijing as the official China. To\ndo this, the United States had to move their US embassy from Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan, to Beijing and\nrecognize only the Beijing government as the official China. The United States agreed to this policy. As a result,\nno government official in the US State Department, cabinet level or higher, can officially visit Taiwan; at the same\ntime, no equal-level diplomat from Taiwan can officially visit the United States. This policy placed Taiwan in an\nambiguous position: Is Taiwan an independent country or is it a part of mainland China?\nMainland China has always demanded that in order for countries to have good relations with the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC), they must not recognize Taiwan (Republic of China, or ROC). This has caused intermittent\nproblems for the United States and other countries. The termination of diplomatic relations between the United\nStates and the ROC was a huge blow for Taiwan, even though the United States continued to conduct trade with\nthe island. The United States has always supported Taiwan\u2019s economic independence. In 2007, the United States\nsold military arms to Taiwan. As a result, China began to deny routine access to its ports for US ships. Taiwan\u2019s\nstatus on the world stage has fluctuated. For about twenty years after the Nationalists set up a government in\nTaiwan, the ROC held a seat in the United Nations (UN), and the UN recognized Taiwan\u2019s claim as the legitimate\ngovernment of China. In 1971, the UN changed its position and gave the seat to Beijing. The UN indicated it\ncould not give a seat to Taiwan because Taiwan is not recognized as a legal nation.\nFigure 10.19 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 860\nTaiwan (ROC) is located just across the Taiwan Strait from Mainland China (PRC).\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nIn 2000, Taiwan renewed its efforts to be internationally recognized as a sovereign nation and announced tentative\nplans to formally secede from China. China responded with many threats and conducted military exercises across\nthe strait from Taiwan. The military exercises were seen as another threat, essentially a show of military might,\nmeant to intimidate Taiwan into retreating from its secessionist position. The United States supported Taiwan by\nparking a naval fleet nearby, which incensed the mainland government. In 2005, China passed a law authorizing\nthe use of military force to stop any secessionist actions by Taiwan.\nTaiwan\u2019s economy continues to use its skilled labor base. In years past, Taiwan\u2019s factories produced textiles and\nlight clothing. As incomes and skills advanced, production shifted to electronics and high-end goods, which it has\nsince been exporting around the world. Taiwan has achieved a high standard of living for its people. When trade\nopened up through Hong Kong with mainland China, many Taiwanese industries shifted production to the SEZs\nalong China\u2019s coast. Labor in SEZs is less expensive, leading to a corresponding rise in profits. Unfortunately,\nthis has resulted in higher unemployment levels in Taiwan. 861 World Regional Geography\nFigure 10.20 Street in Taiwan, ROC, Illustrating Modern Businesses and Use of Scooters for Transportation\nJ Aaron Farr \u2013 Taiwan Streets \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIn the past few years, Taiwan\u2019s focus has turned from secession to trade. In 2008, Taiwan elected a government\nthat, though nationalist in its ideology, is committed to strengthening trade and investment with China. Taiwan\nentered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 using the name Chinese Taipei. That move started a\ncascade of actions that improved \u201ccross-strait\u201d trading conditions, and within just a few years, direct trade between\nChina and Taiwan has become extensive. The question of Taiwan\u2019s political status is as yet unresolved and is\nclearly still volatile, but trade and investment between China and Taiwan are robust and growing. Taiwan has been\nable to independently compete in world-class sporting events, including the Olympics, under the name Chinese\nTaipei.\nAutonomous Region of Tibet\nLocated in mountainous southwestern China, Tibet is classified as one of China\u2019s autonomous regions, a disputed\npolitical arrangement. It is debatable whether Tibet or any of the other Chinese regions are actually autonomous. 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 862\nThe legal structures actually allow for very little self-governance, and most new initiatives require approval from\nthe Chinese central government. Tibet had been an independent entity through much of its history and governed\nitself as a Buddhist theocracy. Its theocratic political system established the Dalai Lama as both the head of state\nand the religious leader of the Tibetan people.\nTibet has had a complicated history with China. This is as true of its early history as it is today. In its early history,\nTibet was an independent kingdom with its unique type of Buddhism as its state religion. It was during this era\nthat a system of Lamaism, a hierarchy of monks or other religious leaders, took hold. China\u2019s influence in Tibet\nwaxed and waned during the later years of the kingdom, in the tenth century. The Mongols subsumed Tibet into\ntheir empire during the first part of their conquests in the thirteenth century. However, in the fifteenth century, the\nMongols gave considerable local authority to the Dalai Lama, making him the spiritual leader as well a powerful\npolitical figure.\nTibet came under the control of China during the Qing Dynasty. When imperialist rule ended in China in 1911,\nTibet began to once again assert its independence. Chinese, British, and Tibetan officials met and came up with\nan agreement that partitioned Tibet into Inner Tibet, which would be controlled by China, and Outer Tibet, which\nwould be independent. China later indicated its intention to control all of Tibet, a move greatly resented by the\nTibetan people.\nWhen Communists took control of China in 1949, the Dalai Lama was originally allowed control over domestic\naffairs while China would control all other governmental functions. The Chinese government then took steps\nto greatly reduce the powers of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama (spiritual leader). With the intention\nof spreading Communism to Tibet, China destroyed monasteries, religious symbols and icons, and other long-\npracticed ways of life were threatened. The Tibetans considered the Chinese political dominance a cruel and\ninvading force. Monasteries were burned, monks were beaten or imprisoned, and Buddhism was brutally\nsuppressed.\nFigure 10.21 863 World Regional Geography\nPotala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, rests at 12,100 feet above sea level. This is the former seat of government of the Dalai Lama in Tibet\nand is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nTibetans revolted in 1956. Backed by the United States, the revolt continued even as China indicated it would\nsuspend the transformation of Tibet. China brutally crushed the revolt in 1959, leaving tens of thousands of\nTibetans dead or imprisoned. The Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetans fled to Dharamsala, India, where they\nestablished a government in exile. At this point, China had a firm grip on Tibet, and in 1965 the reorganization of\nTibet into a Chinese socialist region began in full force.\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, China expressed some willingness to relent in its authoritarian control of\nTibet. However, they demanded that the Dalai Lama renounce claims of Tibetan independence, which he refused.\nDemonstrations and continued violence occurred throughout this period. Chinese-Tibetan relations were further\ndamaged when the Panchen Lama died mysteriously shortly after criticizing socialist reform in Tibet. The\nPanchen Lama is the next-highest Buddhist official under the Dalai Lama. There is now a controversy with the\nChinese government over the selection of the eleventh Panchen Lama. China and Tibet both claimed the authority\nover choosing the Panchen Lama and each named a different person to take on the role. The situation illustrates\nthe conflict over the minds and the people of Tibet. 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 864\nWho Is the Dalai Lama?\nThe Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader of all Tibetans. The Dalai Lama is thought to be the current\nincarnation of past Buddhist Masters, or Tulkus. The Masters have grown behind the cycle of death and rebirth and\nchoose their own time of rebirth to help educate humanity in how to live. As indicated, the Dalai Lama was always\nconsidered the head of state for the government of Tibet and its capital was located in Lhasa. Tenzin Gyatso is the\nrebirth of the thirteenth Dalai Lama. When he was fifteen years old, on November 17, 1950, he became Tibet\u2019s\nfourteenth Dalai Lama. This occurred only one month after China\u2019s invasion of Tibet. The Dalai Lama originally, under\nmilitary pressure from China, ratified the 1951 Seventeen Point agreement. In 1959, he left Tibet and went into exile in\nIndia. China has crushed any attempt of Tibetan resistance. While in India, the Dalai Lama has established the Tibetan\ngovernment in exile and is attempting to preserve Tibetan culture among the thousands of refugees that have\naccompanied him.\nFigure 10.22 The Fourteenth Dalai Lama and Tibetan Leader in Exile 865 World Regional Geography\nWonderlane \u2013 His Holiness the Great 14th Dalai Lama \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIn 2008, a peaceful protest led by Buddhist monks turned violent. Chinese authorities responded with a harsh\ncrackdown. The world\u2019s attention was focused on China at the time because the Olympic Games were under way\nin Beijing. China has often been a target for protests because of its human rights violations against Tibetans and\nother minority groups. Little attention was drawn to Tibet during the 2008 Olympic Games. China wanted to\nshowcase its advancements in industrial development and culture and did not want the world to focus on the issues\nwith Tibet or any other part of China.\nThe population of Tibet is only about three million. They mainly live in the mountain valleys, below seven\nthousand feet. Lhasa is Tibet\u2019s main urban center as well as its capital. In the past couple of decades, China\nhas softened its treatment of Tibetans and restored some of the monasteries. China has also moved thousands of\nethnically Chinese people into Tibet to shift the ethnic balance of the population. A major rail line now directly\nconnects Beijing with Lhasa, Tibet. Lhasa will soon have a majority Chinese population with cultural similarities\nthat reflect more the attributes of China Proper than Tibet. The Tibetans who live there are being compromised\nsimply by population dilution.\nFigure 10.23 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 866\nThe core-peripheral spatial relationship can be appropriately applied to Tibet and its relationship with China. Tibet is a peripheral\nregion with raw materials that provide benefits to the core areas of China, which require the raw materials for industrial development.\nAs indicated previously, China wants to maintain the mountainous, rural region\u2014with little inhabitable land area\nand very few people\u2014as a buffer state between India and the Han Chinese heartland of China Proper. Tibet is\nalso becoming more important to the government of Beijing and the business people in Shenzhen and Shanghai.\nTo understand why this is, consider the core-peripheral spatial relationship. What do the core and the periphery\nusually have to offer each other? Consider also how countries gain wealth. Tibet can play an important role in the\nlarger picture of the Chinese economy. The mountains of Tibet potentially hold vast amounts of natural resources\nthat could support the growing industrial economy in China, which is based on manufacturing goods for the global\nexport markets. China will continue to see to it that Tibet becomes economically integrated with the rest of China\nin spite of the cultural differences that may exist.\nMongolia\nMongolia ranks as the world\u2019s nineteenth-largest country in terms of square miles. Mongolia shares a similar\ngeography with much of Kazakhstan, which is the world\u2019s largest landlocked nation; Mongolia is second-largest. 867 World Regional Geography\nDespite Mongolia\u2019s large land area (slightly smaller than the US state of Alaska or the country of Iran), its\npopulation is only about three million, and the country is the least densely populated country in the world.\nMountains, high plains, and grass-covered steppe cover much of Mongolia, a country that receives only between\nfour and ten inches of rain per year, precipitation that usually comes in the form of snow. The Gobi Desert to the\nsouth, extending from southern Mongolia into northern China, receives even less precipitation. Inner Mongolia\nis a sparsely inhabited autonomous region south of Mongolia that is governed by the Chinese government.\nMongolia\u2019s modern capital city of Ulan Bator is home to about one-third of the people of Mongolia; it has\nthe coldest average temperature of any world capital. Mongolia\u2019s history includes the great Mongol Empire of\nGenghis Khan, which was established in the thirteenth century. The Soviet Union used Mongolia as a buffer state\nwith China. Mongolia\u2019s Communist party dominated politics until the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s. The\ncurrent government in Ulan Bator has to contend with Mongolia\u2019s position between the two large economies of\nRussia and China.\nTibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in Mongolia and is practiced by about 50 percent of the population.\nThe Communist influence is evident in that approximately 40 percent of the population considers itself\nnonreligious. Most of the people are of Mongol ethnicity. Today, about 30 percent of the people are still\nseminomadic and migrate seasonally to accommodate good grazing for their livestock. A round yurt, which can\nbe constructed at whatever location is selected for the season and disassembled for mobility, is the traditional\ndwelling. Mongolian culture and heritage revolve around a rural agrarian culture with an extensive reliance on the\nhorse. Archery, wrestling, and equestrian events are some of the most popular sporting activities.\nFigure 10.24 Men Wrestling on the Rugged Grasslands of Mongolia 10.3 China\u2019s Periphery 868\nWrestling is a major sport of the country.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nMongolia\u2019s economy has traditionally been centered on agriculture, but mining has grown in recent years to be a\nmajor economic sector. Mongolia has rich mineral resources of coal, molybdenum, copper, gold, tin, and tungsten.\nBeing landlocked cuts Mongolia off from the global economy, but the large amounts of mineral reserves are in\ndemand by core industrial areas for manufacturing and should boost the poor economic conditions that dominate\nMongolia\u2019s economy. China has increased its business presence in Mongolia and has been drawing Mongolia\u2019s\nattention away from its former Soviet ally to become a major trading partner.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Hong Kong was a British colony with an excellent port that provided access to China during the colonial\nera. Hong Kong became an economic tiger and regained its importance for trade with the mainland during\nthe open door policy of China in the 1980s. The colony was returned to China in 1997 under an autonomous\narrangement.\n\u2022 Taiwan created an independent government after the three-way split in China. The separation from the\nmainland government has created strained relations between Beijing and Taipei. In recent years, trade and\neconomic exchanges have brought the two Chinas together and they have become more dependent on each\nother.\n\u2022 Tibet established itself as a Buddhist theocracy before the 1949 declaration of the Communist PRC. The\nDalai Lama ruled as both political and religious leader of Tibet until China took control. The Dalai Lama\nfled to India, where he set up a government in exile to continue to promote Tibetan culture and support\nTibet. 869 World Regional Geography\n\u2022 Mongolia is an independent landlocked country with a small population and a large land area. It receives\nonly modest amounts of rainfall. The country was a historic buffer state between the Communist countries\nof the Soviet Union and China. Mongolia is working to capitalize on its natural resources to engage the\nglobal economic situation.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Most of the archipelago, which has more than three thousand islands, is just north of 30\u00b0 latitude.\nFour islands make up most of the country: Shikoku, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Honshu. The islands have tall\nmountains originating from volcanic activity. Many of the volcanoes are active, including the famous Mount\nFuji. The physical area of all Japan\u2019s islands is equivalent to about the size of the US state of Montana. The\nmountainous islands of Japan extend into two climate zones. All but the northern region of Japan has a type C\nclimate. The island of Hokkaido in northern Japan has a type D climate and receives enough snow for downhill\nskiing. Japan hosted the Winter Olympics in 1998. Mt. Fuji, located just west of Tokyo, is a widely photographed\nmountain because of its symmetrical volcanic cone.\n870 871 World Regional Geography\nFigure 10.25 Japan\u2019s Four Main Islands and Its Core Urban and Industrial Areas\nCities like Mexico City, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bombay, which have vast slum communities, each claims to be the world\u2019s\nlargest city but lacks firm census data to verify its population. The largest metropolitan urban area in the world that\ncan be verified is Tokyo, with a population of 26.7 million. The Tokyo metropolitan area is located in an extensive\nagricultural region called the Kanto Plain and includes the conurbation of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki.\nThe second-largest urban area in Japan is located in the Kansai District, and includes the cities of Kobe, Osaka,\nand Kyoto. Japan is a mountainous region, and most of its large cities are located in low-lying areas along the\ncoast. Most of the population (67 percent) lives in urban areas such as Japan\u2019s core area, an urbanized region from\nTokyo to Nagasaki. The 2010 population of Japan was listed at about 126 million, less than half the size of the\nUnited States. It is ironic that the world\u2019s largest metropolitan area is built on one of the worst places imaginable\nto build a city. Tokyo is located where three tectonic plates meet: the Eurasian Plate, the Philippine Plate, and the\nPacific Plate. Earthquakes result when these plates shift, leading to possibly extensive damage and destruction. In\n1923, a large earthquake struck the Tokyo area and killed an estimated 143,000 people. In 1995, an earthquake\nnear Kobe killed about 5,500 people and injured another 26,000. 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 872\nFigure 10.26 Expanse of the Metropolitan Area of Tokyo, with Mt. Fuji in the Background\nMichelle \u2013 Tokyo Tower view & Mt. Fuji \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nIn March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck forty-three miles off the eastern coast of northern Japan.\nThe earthquake itself caused extensive damage to the island of Honshu. A shockwave after the earthquake\ncreated a tsunami more than 130 feet high that crashed into the eastern coast of Japan causing enormous damage\nto infrastructure and loss of life. Hundreds of aftershocks were recorded; at least three registered over 7.0 in\nmagnitude. This is the strongest earthquake to ever hit Japan in recorded history. It resulted in more than 15,500\ndeaths and wreaked serious damage across Japan in the value of billions of dollars. Thousands of additional people\nremain missing. Nuclear power plants along the coast were hit hard by the tsunami, which knocked out their\ncooling systems and resulted in the meltdown of at least three reactors. The nuclear meltdowns created explosions\nthat released a sizeable quantity of nuclear material into the atmosphere. This is considered the worst nuclear\naccident since the 1986 reactor meltdown at the Soviet plant at Chernobyl, located north of Kiev in present-day\nUkraine. The next big earthquake could happen at any time, since Japan is located in an active tectonic plate zone. 873 World Regional Geography\nDevelopment\nThe country of Japan is an interesting study in isolation geography and economic development. For centuries,\nshogun lords and samurai warriors ruled Japan, and Japan\u2019s society was highly organized and structured. Urban\ncenters were well planned, and skilled artisans developed methods of creating high-grade metal products. While\nagriculture was always important, Japan always existed as a semiurban community because the mountainous\nterrain forced most of the population to live along the country\u2019s coasts. Without a large rural population to begin\nwith, Japan never really experienced the rural-to-urban shift common in the rest of the world. Coastal fishing,\nalways a prominent economic activity, remains so today. The capital city of Tokyo was formerly called Edo and\nwas a major city even before the colonial era. Japan developed its own unique type of urbanized cultural heritage.\nEncounters with European colonial ships prompted Japan to industrialize. For the most part, the Japanese kept the\nEuropeans out and only traded with select ships that were allowed to approach the shores. The fact that European\nships were there at all was enough to convince the Japanese to evaluate their position in the world. During the\ncolonial era, Britain was the most avid colonizer with the largest and best-equipped navy on the high seas. Britain\ncolonized parts of the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and Australia and was advancing in East\nAsia when they encountered the Japanese. Both Japan and Great Britain are island countries. Japan reasoned\nthat if Great Britain could become so powerful, they should also have the potential to become powerful. Japan\nencompassed a number of islands and had more land area than Britain, but Japan did not have the coal and iron\nore reserves that Britain had.\nAround 1868, a group of reformers worked to bring about a change in direction for Japan. Named after the\nemperor, the movement was called the Meiji Restoration (the return of enlightened rule). Japanese modernizers\nstudied the British pattern of development. The Japanese reformers were advised by the British about how to\norganize their industries and how to lay out transportation and delivery systems. Today, the British influence in\nJapan is easily seen in that both Japanese and British drivers drive on the left side of the road. The modernizers\nrealized that to compete on the high seas in the world community they had to move beyond samurai swords and\nwooden ships. Iron ore and coal would have to become the goods to fuel their own industrial revolution. Labor\nand resources were valuable elements of early industrialization in all areas of the world, including Asia.\nFigure 10.27 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 874\nJapan was a major colonial power in the Asian Pacific Rim. Japan colonized parts of Russia, China, Taiwan, Philippines, Southeast\nAsia, and Korea.\nJapan began to industrialize and build its economic and military power by first utilizing the few resources found\nin Japan. Since it was already semiurban and had an organized social order with skilled artisan traditions, the road\nto industrialization moved quickly. Japan needed raw materials and expanded to take over the island of Formosa\n(Taiwan) and the Korean Peninsula in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Japan was on its way to\nbecoming a colonial power in its own right. They expanded to take control of the southern part of Sakhalin Island\nfrom Russia and part of Manchuria (Northeast China) from the Chinese. Japanese industries grew quickly as they\nput the local people they subjugated to work and extracted the raw materials they needed from their newly taken\ncolonies.\nFigure 10.28 875 World Regional Geography\nThis photo, taken after the atomic bomb blast of World War II in 1945, illustrates all that was left standing of a Shinto shrine in\nNagasaki.\nPingnews.com \u2013 Public Domain: Shinto Shrine in Atomic Ruins, Nagasaki \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe three-way split in China revealed that the Japanese colonizers were a major force in China even after the\nother European powers had halted their colonial activities. Japan\u2019s relative location as an independent island\ncountry provided both quick access to their neighbors and also protection from them. By World War II, Japan\u2019s\neconomic and military power had expanded until they were dominating Asia\u2019s Pacific Rim community. The\nJapanese military believed that they could invade the western coast of North America and eventually take control\nof the entire United States. Their attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1941, was meant to be only a beginning.\nHistory has recorded the outcome. The United States rallied its people and resources to fight against the Japanese\nin World War II. The Soviet Union also turned to fight the Japanese empire. The end came after atomic bombs,\none each, were dropped by the United States on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The terms of\nJapan\u2019s surrender in 1945 stipulated that Japan had to give up claims on the Russian islands, Korea, Taiwan,\nChina, and all the other places that they had previously controlled. Japan also lost the Kurile Islands\u2014off its\nnorthern shores\u2014to the Soviet Union. The islands have never been returned. Japan offered Russia an enormous\namount of cash for them but the matter remains unresolved. The Kurile Island chain continues to be controlled by\nRussia. Japan also agreed not to have a military for offensive purposes. Japan was decimated during World War\nII, its infrastructure and economy destroyed. 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 876\nEconomic Growth\nSince 1945, Japan has risen to become Asia\u2019s economic superpower and the economic center of one of the three\ncore areas of the world. Japanese manufacturing has set a standard for global production. For example, think of\nall the automobiles that are Japanese products: Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Nissan, Isuzu, Mazda, and\nSuzuki. How many Russian, Brazilian, Chinese, or Indonesian autos are sold in the United States? The term\n\u201ceconomic tiger\u201d is used in Asia to indicate an entity with an aggressive and fast-growing economy. Japan has\nsurpassed this benchmark and is called the economic dragon of Asia. The four economic tigers competing with\nJapan are Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. Japan came back from total devastation in 1945 to\nbecome a world economic superpower.\nJapan\u2019s recovery in the last half of the century was remarkable. If an island nation like Japan could accomplish\nthis rapid growth in its economy, why couldn\u2019t other similar-sized countries accomplish the same level of growth?\nWhat was it that caused the Japanese people to not only recover so quickly but rise above the world\u2019s standard to\nexcel in their economic endeavors? The answer could be related to the fact that Japan already had an industrialized\nand urbanized society before the war. The United States did help rebuild some of Japan\u2019s infrastructure that had\nbeen destroyed during World War II\u2014things like ports and transportation systems to help bring aid and provide for\nhumanitarian support. However, the Japanese people were able to not only recover from the devastation of World\nWar II but rise to the level of an economic superpower to compete with the United States. Japan used internal\norganization and strong centripetal dynamics to create a highly functional and cohesive society that focused its\ndrive and fortitude on creating a manufacturing sector that catapulted the country\u2019s economy from devastation to\nfinancial success.\nFigure 10.29 Timeline of Japanese Development 877 World Regional Geography\nThe same dynamics can be applied to Germany after World War II. Germany was completely destroyed by\nthe war. The Allied powers decimated Germany\u2019s infrastructure and resources. Today, Germany is the strongest\neconomy in all of Europe. Part of the reason Germany came back to become so economically successful\nwas its industrialized and urbanized society. Germany also was able to access resources. Again, think of all\nthe automobiles that are German products: Mercedes, Volkswagen, Porsche, BMW, and Audi. The pattern of\neconomic growth was similar for Germany and Japan. The loss of colonies after World War II prompted Japan\nto look elsewhere for its raw materials. Extensive networks of trade were developed to provide the necessary\nmaterials for the rapidly growing manufacturing sector. The urbanized region around Tokyo, including the cities of\nYokohama and Kawasaki, swelled to accommodate the growth of industry. Japan\u2019s coastal interior has a number\nof large cities and urban areas that rapidly increased with the growing manufacturing sector.\nThe basis for Japan\u2019s technological and economic development may be related to its geographic location and 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 878\ncultural development. Japan\u2019s pattern of economic development has similarities to the patterns of other Asian\nentities that have created thriving economic conditions. Hong Kong and Taiwan are both small islands with few\nnatural resources, yet they have become economic tigers. Taiwan exports computer products to the United States,\nbut Russia, with all its natural resources, millions of people, and large land area, does not. Explaining how or\nwhy countries develop at different rates can be complex, because there may be many interrelated explanations\nor reasons. One element might be centripetal cultural forces that hold a country together and drive it forward.\nThe ability to manage labor and resources would be another part of the economic situation. The theory of\nhow countries gain wealth may shed some light on this issue. Japan used manufacturing as a major means of\ngaining wealth from value-added profits. This is the same method the Asian economic tigers also developed their\neconomies. Japan developed itself into a core economic country that took advantage of the peripheral countries\nfor labor and resources during the colonial era. Japan took advantage of every opportunity that presented itself to\nbecome a world manufacturing center.\nModern Japan\nJapan is a homogeneous society. In 2010, all but 1 percent of the population was ethnically Japanese. Japan\nresembles a nation-state, where people of a common heritage and aspirations hold to a unified government. This\nprovides a strong centripetal force that unites the people under one culture and one language. However, religious\nallegiances in Japan vary, and there are a good number of people who indicate nonreligious ideologies. Shintoism\nand Buddhism are the main religious traditions. Shintoism includes a veneration of ancestors and the divine forces\nof nature. There is no one single written text for Shintoism; the religion is a loosely knit set of concepts based\non morality, attitude, sensibility, and right practice. It is possible for a Shinto priest to conduct a wedding for a\ncouple, whereas the funeral (hopefully taking place much later) for either of the spouses might be conducted by a\nBuddhist priest. The Buddhism that is practiced in Japan is more meditative in nature than mystical.\nModernization has brought new opportunities and problems for the Japanese people. With a highly urban and\nindustrial society, personal incomes in Japan are high and family size is quite low, at about 1.2 children. The\nreplacement level for a given population is about 2.1 children, which means Japan has a declining population.\nThe population is aging and there are not enough young people to take entry-level jobs. The family has been at\nthe center of Japanese tradition, and the elderly have been venerated and honored. As the country has become\nmore economically developed, higher incomes for young people have prompted a shift toward convenience and\nconsumer amenities. Consumer goods are available, but all the oil and about 60 percent of the food products have 879 World Regional Geography\nto be imported. During the off season, fruit, for example, is expensive. Beef is at a premium price, so fish is a\nstaple source of protein. Income levels are high, but the cost of living in places like Tokyo is also quite high.\nJapan is facing a labor shortage for many low-level service jobs that had traditionally been held by young people\nentering the workforce. Japan is an island country that has prided itself in being 99 percent Japanese. Countries\nin stage 5 of the index of economic development usually enter a negative population growth pattern. According\nto population statistics, Japan is at the start of a serious population decline, with a negative population growth\npattern. While Western Europe and the United States also have a declining percentage of young people, in those\ncountries the declining youth cohort has been replaced by an elevated level of immigration, both legal and illegal.\nCulturally, this is not an attractive option for Japan, but they are forced to address the labor shortage in any way\nthey can. Their economy will depend on the ability to acquire cheap labor and resources to compete in the global\nmarketplace.\nCentripetal Forces Hold a State Together\n\u2022 Ethnic Unity and Tolerance\n\u2022 Social\/Economic Equity\n\u2022 Just and Fair Legal System\n\u2022 Charismatic Leadership\n\u2022 Religious Acceptance\n\u2022 Nationalism\n\u2022 Common Heritage\n\u2022 Common Language\n\u2022 Any Other Unifying Force\nAs the economic dragon of Asia, Japan has had an enormous economic impact on the East Asian Community\n(EAC). The shortage of cheap labor has forced Japan to look elsewhere for new manufacturing ventures. China is\nan attractive country in this respect because of its substantial population and low standard of living for many of its\ncitizens. Japan is looking to take advantage of its geographical location to establish a more positive trade situation\nwith its Asian neighbors. The dynamics of its economy are uniquely similar to that of the United States and\nEurope. All three core economic areas are competing for inexpensive labor and resources to fuel their economies.\nChina has been a major destination for manufacturing production because of its low labor costs and attractive\nfinancial incentives. If you recall, during World War II China and Japan were locked in a bitter war that caused\nharsh animosities to take root against each other. The two countries have not historically been friendly toward\neach other. Japan\u2019s history as a colonizer has caused serious cultural attitudes against it from its Asian neighbors.\nNevertheless, economics usually drive politics, and Japan wields enormous economic power. Japan now engages\nin trade with China and continues to be a core economic country in the global economy. 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 880\nKorea\nThe Korean Peninsula juts out into the Pacific Rim from northwestern Asia. The peninsula is bound by the Sea\nof Japan (the East Sea) and the Yellow Sea. North and South Korea share the peninsula. These countries have\nbeen separated by the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) since 1953. To the west and north is China and to the\nfar north along the coast is Russia. Korea is separated from China by the Yellow Sea and the Yalu and Tumen\nRivers to the north. The Yalu and Tumen rivers form the actual border between North Korea and China. Japan\nis located just east of the Korean Peninsula across the Korea Strait. The Korean Peninsula is now split between\nSouth Korea and North Korea. The capital city of North Korea is Pyongyang, and Seoul is the capital of South\nKorea.\nThe topography of the Korean Peninsula is mountainous with arable or cultivable land in high demand.\nApproximately 70 percent of the Korean Peninsula is mountainous. The bedrock is predominantly composed\nof volcanic and granitic rocks that have been severely modified by glacial processes over the past twenty-five\nthousand years. The highest peak in North Korea rises more than nine thousand feet. The Korean Peninsula can\nbe thought of as four general areas:\n1. Western Region with an extensive coastal plain, river basins, and small foothills\n2. Eastern Region with high mountain ranges and a narrow coastal plain\n3. Southeastern Basin\n4. Southwestern Region of mountains and valleys\nOff the southern and western coasts of the Korean Peninsula are about three thousand small and mostly\nuninhabited islands, all within the territory of South Korea. South Korea\u2019s largest island has an area of 712 square\nmiles. It is the highest point of land in South Korea, at 6,398 feet above sea level.\nNorth and South Korea have very different, yet related, environmental issues, primarily related to the degree of\nindustrialization. With a low level of industrialism, North Korea has severe issues of water pollution as well as\ndeforestation and related soil erosion and degradation. Other issues in North Korea include inadequate supplies\nof clean drinking water and many waterborne diseases. South Korea has water pollution associated with sewage\ndischarge and industrial effluent from its many industrial centers. Air pollution is severe at times in the larger\ncities, which also contributes to higher levels of acid rain.\nThe physical size in square miles of North Korea or South Korea is similar to the physical area of the US state of\nKentucky. North Korea is slightly larger, and South Korea is slightly smaller. For centuries, Korea was a unified\nkingdom that was often invaded by outsiders. After the fall of the Chinese Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, the Japanese\ntook control of the Korean Peninsula (1910) and controlled it as a colony. Japanese colonial rule ended in 1945\nwhen the United States defeated Japan, forcing it to give up its colonial possessions. The structure of modern\nKorea is a result of the ending of World War II. 881 World Regional Geography\nFigure 10.31 The Korean Peninsula between the North and the South\nThe thirty-eighth parallel cuts across the peninsula in the area of the DMZ farmland. The thirty-eighth parallel on or near the DMZ\nis the Cease-Fire Line between North and South Korea (right). The left side of the picture is South Korea, and the right side of the\npicture is North Korea.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe conclusion of World War II was a critical period for the Korean Peninsula. The United States and the Soviet\nUnion both fought against the Japanese in Korea. When the war was over, the Soviet Union took administrative\ncontrol of the peninsula north of the thirty-eighth parallel, and the United States established administrative\ncontrol over the area south of the thirty-eighth parallel. The United States and the Soviet Union divided Korea\napproximately in half and eventually established governments in their respective regions that were sympathetic to\neach nation\u2019s own ideology. The Soviet Union administered the northern portion; the United States administered\nthe southern region. Politics deeply affected each of the regions. Communism dominated North Korea and\ncapitalism dominated South Korea. In 1950, with aid from China and the Soviet Union, the Communists from\nthe north invaded the south. After bitter fighting, a peace agreement was reached in 1953 to officially divide\nthe Korean Peninsula near the thirty-eighth parallel. Korea remains divided to this day. The United States has\nthousands of soldiers stationed along the Cease-Fire Line (or DMZ), which is the most heavily guarded border in\nthe world. 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 882\nNorth Korea\nThe government of North Korea (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) was formed with the\nleadership of Communist dictator Kim Il Sung, who shaped his country with a mix of Soviet and Chinese\nauthoritarian rule. Having few personal freedoms, the people worked hard to rebuild a state. Using the threat of a\nUS military invasion as a means of rallying his people, Kim Il Sung built up a military of more than one million\nsoldiers, one of the largest in the world. People could not travel in or out of the country without strict regulation.\nNorth Korea existed without much notice until the 1990s, when things suddenly changed.\nWhen the Soviet Union fell in 1991, North Korea lost a valued source of financial support and oil. Without fuel\nand funding, many of the factories closed. Unemployment rates rose significantly. Meanwhile, China adopted a\nmore open posture and began to increase its level of trade with the West. The result was that China began to lose\ninterest in propping up North Korea politically. North Korea was facing serious problems. Massive food shortages\ncaused famine and starvation. Thousands of people died. Kim Il Sung died in 1994 and the country lost their\n\u201cGreat Leader.\u201d He had ruled the country since World War II and in the end was deified as a god to be worshiped\nby the people.\nFigure 10.32 883 World Regional Geography\nThis giant statue of North Korea\u2019s \u201cGreat Leader\u201d Kim Il Sung stands in the capital city of Pyongyang and is called the Mansudae\nGrand Monument. This mammoth bronze statue was built in 1972 to celebrate the Great Leader\u2019s sixtieth birthday.\nJohn Pavelka \u2013 Manusudae Grand Monument \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe government dictatorship continued as the Great Leader\u2019s son, Kim Jong Il, took over the leadership role.\nKim Jong Il, known as the \u201cDear Leader,\u201d took repression of his people to new levels. Televisions and radios\nsold in North Korea can only receive government-controlled frequencies. Cell phones and the Internet are banned.\nThe government takes a hard line against dissenters. If you are caught speaking against the state or taking any\naction to support dissent, you can be arrested, fined, placed in a prison camp, or executed. People are not allowed\nto leave or enter the country without government approval. Only a couple hundred tourists are allowed into the\ncountry per year and are closely escorted.\nKim Jong Il has taken hard measures to stay in power and to avoid yielding to the capitalist frenzy of corporate\ncolonialism. He has nuclear weapon capability and has used his military weapons production as a bargaining chip\nagainst the United States and other world powers. North Korea has demonized the United States as the ultimate\nthreat and has used state-funded propaganda to indoctrinate its people. North Korea\u2019s government continually tells 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 884\nits people that the United States will invade at any minute and to be prepared for the worst. Propaganda has been\nused to create and enforce military, economic, and political policies for an ideology that supports the unification\nof all of Korea under Communist control.\nNorth Korea is mainly mountainous; there is little quality farmland. While only 2 percent of the land is in\npermanent crops, about a third of the population works in agriculture. The best farmland in North Korea is located\nsouth of the capital city of Pyongyang. The capital is a restricted area where only the most loyal to the state can\nlive. There is a serious shortage of goods and services. Electricity is not available on a dependable basis. Massive\ninternational food aid has sustained the people of North Korea. Outside food aid is accepted even though Kim\nJong Il has continued a policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency called Juche. Juche is designed to keep Korea\nfrom becoming dependent on the outside. The policy of Juche has been quite effective in isolating the people of\nNorth Korea and keeping dictator Kim Jong Il in power. The policy of Juche also holds back the wave of corporate\ncapitalism that seeks to exploit labor and resources in global markets for economic profit.\nFigure 10.33 885 World Regional Geography\nA North Korean soldier looks across the DMZ in the Joint Security Area (left).

Popular VHS productions include South Korean soap operas, because of\nthe common heritage, language, and ethnicity. The North Korean government has attempted to crack down on\nsmuggled videotapes by going from home to home. Electricity is turned off before entering the home. Once the\nelectricity is turned off, videotapes cannot be removed from the video player. The government agents then recover\nthe videotape. Citizens found with smuggled videotapes are punished with steep fines or imprisonment. Desperate\nNorth Koreans have escaped across the border into northern China, where thousands of refugees have sought out\nbetter opportunities for their future. It is ironic to think that Communist China, with historically few human rights,\nwould be a place where people would seek refuge, but China\u2019s economy is growing and North Korea\u2019s economy\nis stagnant, which creates strong push-pull forces on migration.\nSouth Korea\nIn 1993, South Korea became a fully fledged democracy with its first democratically elected president. Seoul is\nthe capital city and is home to almost ten million people. Seoul is located just south of the Cease-Fire Line, also\nknown as the DMZ, which is referred to in general terms as the thirty-eighth parallel, even though it does not\nfollow it exactly. The United States has many military installations in this area.\nSouth Korea manufactures automobiles, electronic goods, and textiles that are sold around the world. South Korea\nis a democracy that has used state capitalism to develop its economy. After the World War II era, South Korea\nwas ruled by a military government that implemented land reform and received external economic aid. Large\nagricultural estates were broken up and redistributed to the people. Agricultural production increased to meet the\ndemands of the population. South Korea has much more agricultural production than North Korea and is therefore\nin providing food for the high population density. A once-modest manufacturing sector has grown to become a\nmajor production center for export trade.\nThe fifty million people who live in South Korea have a much higher standard of living than the residents of North\nKorea. Personal income in the north is barely equivalent to a few dollars per day, while personal income in the\nsouth is similar to that of Western countries. The economic growth of the south was a result of state-controlled 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 886\ncapitalism, rather than free-enterprise capitalism. The state has controlled or owned most of the industrial\noperations and sold its products in the global marketplace. Giant corporations, which forced industrialization\nalong the coastal region, have promoted South Korea as the world\u2019s leading shipbuilding nation. South Korean\ncorporations include Daewoo, Samsung, Kia Motors, Hyundai, and the Orion Group. As an economic tiger, South\nKorea continues to reform its economic system to adapt to global economic conditions.\nSouth Korea has announced plans to conduct a comprehensive overhaul of its energy and transportation networks.\nGovernment funding will augment efforts to create more green-based initiatives. Part of this effort will focus on\nlower energy dependency with environmentally friendly energy developments such as wind, solar, bike lanes, and\nnew lighting technologies. High-speed rail service and increased capacity in electronic transmissions lines are\nplanned as part of a next generation of energy-efficient technologies that will increase economic efficiency. These\npolicies have been enacted to update South Korea\u2019s economy and create new products for manufacturing export.\nBuddhism was introduced into the Korean Peninsula, as were many other aspects of Chinese culture that had\nsignificant effects on the Korean heritage. Buddhism has been a prominent religion in Korea for centuries.\nThe teachings of Confucius are also widely regarded. About 30 percent of the population claims Christianity\nas their religious background; about 20 percent of the Christians are Protestant and 10 percent are Catholic.\nThis is the highest Christian percentage of any Asian country. Up to half of the population makes no claims\nor professions of faith in any organized religion. Before 1948, Pyongyang was a notable Christian center. At\nthat time, approximately three hundred thousand people identified as Christian. After the establishment of a\nCommunist government in North Korea, many of the Christians fled to South Korea to avoid persecution.\nUnification of North and South\nWhat if North Korea and South Korea would become unified again? In the field of geography, there is a\nconcept of regional complementarity, which exists when two separate regions possess qualities that would\nwork to complement each if unified into one unit. North and South Korea are the classic illustration of regional\ncomplementarity. The North is mountainous and has access to minerals, coal, iron ore, and nitrates (fertilizers)\nthat are needed in the South for industrialization and food production. The South has the most farmland and can\nproduce large harvests of rice and other food crops. The South has industrial technology and capital needed for\ndevelopment in the North. If and when these two countries are reunited, they could work well as an economic\nunit. 887 World Regional Geography\nFigure 10.34 Reunification Buddha in South Korea, Erected to Signify the Unity of the Korean People\nPaul B. \u2013 DSC_0105 \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\/p>\nThe harder question is how and under what circumstances the two Koreas could ever come to terms of unification.\nWhat about the thirty-five to forty thousand US soldiers along the DMZ? What type of government would the\nunified Korea have? There are many young people in South Korea that would like to see the US military leave\nKorea and the two sides united. The generation of soldiers that survived the Korean War in the 1950s understands\nthe bitterness and difficulties caused by the division. This segment of the population is highly supportive of\nmaintaining the presence of the US military on the border with North Korea. Unification is not likely to take place\nuntil this generation either passes away or comes to terms with unification. The brutal dictatorship of Kim Jong\nIl, with his claimed nuclear capabilities, has been a main barrier to unification. This is a political division, not\ntechnically a cultural division, even though the societies are quite different at the present time. The geography of 10.4 Japan and Korea (North and South) 888\nthis situation is similar to that of East and West Germany after World War II and during the Cold War. Korea may\nhave different qualities from Germany, but unification may be possible under certain conditions, foremost being\ndifferent leadership in the north.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s mountainous archipelago has provided isolation and protection for the Japanese people to maintain\ntheir unique culture and heritage. The islands were created by tectonic plate action, which continues to cause\nearthquakes in the region.\n\u2022 Japan was a colonial power that colonized much of the Asian Pacific region. Its defeat in World War II\ndevastated the country and liberated all its colonies. Since 1945, Japan has been developing one of the\nstrongest economies in the world through manufacturing.\n\u2022 Japan is a highly industrialized country that is in stage 5 of the index of economic development. The\ncountry\u2019s small family size and declining population are a concern for economic growth in the future.\n\u2022 The Korean Peninsula is divided in two by the DMZ. North Korea is a Communist dictatorship with a low\nstandard of living and absolutely no civil rights. South Korea is a capitalist democracy with a high standard\nof living and a free-market economy.\n\u2022 North Korea is more mountainous and lacks arable land to grow food. South Korea has more farmland and\nfewer mountains. If the two countries were to be united with a common economy, they would complement\neach other with a balance of natural resources.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

East Asia is anchored by Communist China, a large country that dominates the physical region. High\nmountains on its western borders have isolated China. The peripheral regions of Tibet, Western China,\nMongolia, and Manchuria act as buffer states that protect the core Han Chinese heartland in China Proper,\nwhere most of the population lives.\n2. To boost foreign trade and increase its manufacturing sector, China has established special economic zones\n(SEZs) along its coast in hopes of attracting international businesses. Shenzhen is one such SEZ, which is\nlocated across the border from Hong Kong. Urbanization and industrialization have prompted a major rural-\nto-urban shift in the population.\n3. The world-class port and strategic geographic location of Hong Kong have played a large role in its\ndevelopment as an economic tiger. High-tech manufacturing with banking and financial services have\ncatapulted the small area into a major market center for Asia. In 1998, Hong Kong was united with China,\nopening the door for massive trade and development with China and Shenzhen.\n4. Taiwan is a small island off the southeast coast of China. It has developed into an economic tiger with high-\ntech manufacturing and high incomes. The island has a separate government from mainland China and has a\ncapitalist economy. There has been historic tension between Taiwan and Beijing ever since the Nationalists\nmoved here in 1948. Economic trade between Taiwan and mainland China has brought the two sides closer\ntogether.\n5. Japan is made up of a number of large islands. After its defeat in World War II, Japan worked to recover and\nbecome a core manufacturing country and the second-largest economy in the world, although that title is\nnow held by China. Japan has a homogeneous society in which about 99 percent of the population is\nJapanese. Family size is low and the population has begun to decline in numbers, causing an economic\nconcern about the lack of entry-level workers.\n6. Korea is split between an authoritarian-controlled North Korea and a capitalist South Korea. North Korea is\nisolated with a weak economy. Its citizens are denied basic human rights. South Korea has developed into\none of the economic tigers of Asia. South Korea has a strong manufacturing sector that produces high-tech\nelectronics and information technology. Thousands of Korean and US soldiers remain stationed on the\ndemilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.\n890 Chapter 11: Southeast Asia\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nThe region between China, India, Australia, and the Pacific Ocean is known as Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia\nincludes countries with political boundaries creating many shapes and sizes. The political borders were created\nthrough a combination of factors, including natural features, traditional tribal distinctions, colonial claims, and\npolitical agreements. The realm also has the fourth-most populous country in the world, Indonesia. Southeast Asia\nis a region of peninsulas and islands. The only landlocked country is the rural and remote country of Laos, which\nborders China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The physical geography of Southeast Asia includes beaches, bays, inlets,\nand gulfs. The thousands of islands and remote places allow refuge for a wide variety of cultural groups and\nprovide havens for rebellious insurgents, modern-day pirates, and local inhabitants.\nSoutheast Asia can be divided into two geographic regions. The mainland portion, which is connected to\nIndia and China, extends south into what has been called the Indochina Peninsula or Indochina, a name\ngiven to the region by France. This mainland region consists of the countries of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,\nThailand, and Myanmar (Burma). This region has been influenced historically by India and China. The islands or\ninsular regionThe region consisting of the islands of Southeast Asia\u2014Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, and Singapore. to the south and east consist of nations surrounded by water. The countries in this\nregion include Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, East Timor, and the Philippines.\n891 Chapter 11: Southeast Asia 892\nFigure 11.1 Southeast Asia: The Mainland Region and the\nInsular Region (the Islands)\nUpdated from map courtesy of University of Texas Libraries. 11.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Understand the geographical differences between the mainland region and the insular region.\n2. Summarize how the region was colonized. Learn how colonial activities influence each country\u2019s cultural\nsituation.\n3. Realize how the physical geography has been influenced by tectonic activity.\n4. Outline the main ethnic and religious affiliations of Southeast Asia and explain why they are so diverse.\n5. Comprehend the impact and influence of the overseas Chinese in the region.\nPhysical Geography\nThe islands and the mainland of Southeast Asia include a wide array of physical and cultural landscapes. The\nentire realm is located in the tropics except the northernmost region of Burma (Myanmar), which extends north\nof the Tropic of Cancer. A tropical Type A climate dominates the region and rainfall is generally abundant. The\ntropical waters of the region help moderate the climate. Southeast Asia is located between the Indian Ocean on\nthe west and the Pacific Ocean on the east. Bordering the many islands and peninsulas are various seas, bays,\nstraits, and gulfs that help create the complex maritime boundaries of the realm. The South China Sea is a major\nbody of water that acts as a separator between the mainland and the insular region. The thousands of islands that\nmake up the various countries or lie along their coastal waters create a matrix of passageways and unique physical\ngeography.\nThe three longest rivers of the realm, Mekong, Red, and Irrawaddy, are located on the mainland and have their\nheadwaters in the high elevations of Himalayan ranges of China. The Mekong River makes its way from the high\nHimalayas in China and helps form the political borders of Laos and Thailand on its way through Cambodia to\nVietnam where it creates a giant delta near Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The Red River flows out of China and\n893 11.1 Introducing the Realm 894\nthrough Hanoi to the Red River delta on the Gulf of Tonkin. The Irrawaddy River flows through the length of\nBurma providing for the core area of the country. Another major river of the mainland is the Chao Phraya of\nThailand. With its many tributaries, the Chao Phraya creates a favorable core area that is home to the largest\npopulation of the country. Many other rivers can be found on both the mainland and the insular region. The rivers\ntransport water and sediments from the interior to the coasts, often creating large deltas with rich soils that are\nmajor agricultural areas. Multiple crops of rice and food products can be grown in the fertile river valleys and\ndeltas. The agricultural abundance is needed to support the ever-increasing populations of the realm.\nTectonic plate activity has been responsible for the existence of the many islands and has created the mountainous\nterrain of the various countries. High mountain ranges can have peaks that reach elevations of over fifteen\nthousand feet. The high-elevation ranges of New Guinea, which are along the equator, actually have glaciers, ice,\nand snow that remain year-round. The island of Borneo, in the center of the insular region, is actually a segment\nof ancient rock that has been pushed upward by tectonic forces to form a mountainous land mass. The mountains\non Borneo have been worn down over time by erosion. Mountains and highlands stretch across the northern\nborder of the realm along the borders with India and China. The interior nature of this border makes it less\naccessible. Similar dynamics can be found in the interior of the islands of the insular region, where the isolation\nand remoteness have helped create the environmental conditions for unique flora and fauna. In the highland areas\nthe human cultural landscape can be diverse. Time and isolation have worked together to form the traditions and\ncultural ways that give local groups their identity and heritage.\nTectonic activity makes the region vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The volcanic peak of Mt.\nPinatubo, in the Philippines, erupted in 1991, spewing ash and smoke into the atmosphere and impacting much\nof the planet. An earthquake of 9.0 magnitude occurred off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra in 2004\nand caused widespread disaster throughout the wider region of the Indian Ocean. As many as one hundred fifty\nthousand deaths were reported, mainly from flooding. A thirty-five-foot-high wall of water from the tsunami\ndevastated many coastal areas from Thailand to India.\nImpact of Colonialism\nSoutheast Asia has not escaped the impact of globalization, both colonial and corporate. As Europeans expanded\ntheir colonial activities, they made their way into Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia was heavily influenced by\nEuropean colonialism. The only area of the region that was not colonized by the Europeans was Thailand, which\nwas called Siam during the colonial era. It remained an independent kingdom throughout the colonial period 895 World Regional Geography\nand was a buffer state between French and British colonizers. The Japanese colonial empire controlled much of\nSoutheast Asia before World War II.\nSome of the countries and regions of Southeast Asia became known by their colonial connection. Indonesia was\nonce referred to as the Dutch East Indies, which was influential in the labeling of the Caribbean as the West Indies.\nFrench Indochina is a term legitimized for historical references to the former French claims in Southeast Asia.\nMalaya and British Borneo each had its own currency based on a dollar unit that was legal tender for the regions\nof the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei. Independence from the European\npowers and freedom from Japanese imperialism by the end of World War II provided a new identification for\nthe various countries of the realm. Cultural and economic ties remain between many former colonies and their\nEuropean counterparts.\nFigure 11.2\nSoutheast Asia was colonized by Europeans and later by Japan. 11.1 Introducing the Realm 896\nEast Timor, a former Portuguese colony south of Indonesia, has been the most recent colony to gain independence.\nTimor is an island just north of Australia. The western portion is claimed by Indonesia. The whole island was\nannexed to Indonesia in 1975. As a result of separatist movements that entailed conflict and violence, the eastern\nportion was finally granted independence in 2002. Since then, East Timor has been working to establish itself as\na country and is now negotiating its offshore boundary to include important oil and gas reserves.\nCultural Introduction\nSoutheast Asia has a population of more than six hundred million people; more than half the population lives on\nthe many islands of Indonesia and the Philippines. The small island of Java in Indonesia is one of the most densely\npopulated places on Earth. More than half of the two hundred forty-five million people who live in Indonesia live\non the island of Java. The island of Luzon in the Philippines is also one of the more densely populated areas of the\ninsular region. The Philippines has over one hundred million people, Vietnam has more than ninety million, and\nThailand has about sixty-seven million. Local areas with high food-producing capacity are also high population\ncenters, which would include deltas, river valleys, and fertile plains.\nThe ethnic mosaic of Southeast Asia is a result of the emergence of local differences between people that have\nevolved into identifiable cultural or ethnic groups. Though there are a multitude of specific ethnic groups, a\nnumber of the larger ones stand out with recognizable populations. On the mainland the Burmese, Thai, Khmer,\nand Vietnamese are the largest groups, coinciding with the physical countries from Burma to Vietnam. A similar\nsituation can be found in the insular region. Many distinct groups can exist on the many islands of the region. The\nisland of New Guinea, for example, has hundreds of local groups with their own languages and traditions. The\nlarge number of ethnic groups is dominated by Indonesians, Malays, and Filipinos, coinciding with the countries\nof Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of these main groups has many subgroups that hold to their\nown cultural heritage in the areas where they exist. The many islands of Indonesia and the Philippines create the\nopportunity for diversity to continue to thrive, in spite of the globalization process that increased the interaction\nand communication opportunities between groups.\nIndonesia is also home to the largest Muslim population in the world. All major religions can be found here.\nThe Philippine population is predominantly Christian, but there is a minority Muslim community, including rebel\ninsurgents. Most of people in Malaysia follow Islam. About 95 percent of the people in Thailand and more\nthan 60 percent of the people in Laos are Buddhist. Hinduism is present in the Indonesian island of Bali and in 897 World Regional Geography\nvarious other locations in the region. Animism and local religions can be found in rural and remote areas. Clearly,\nSoutheast Asia is a mix of many ethnic groups, each with its own history, culture, and religious preference.\nOverseas Chinese\nSoutheast Asia is also home to over thirty million overseas Chinese\u2014ethnic Chinese who live outside of China.\nThe Chinese exodus to the realm was the greatest during the last Chinese dynasties and during the colonial\nera. European colonial powers enhanced this migration pattern by leveraging the use of people with Chinese\nheritage in their governing over the local populations in the realm. Life has often been difficult for overseas\nChinese. The Japanese occupation of the realm during World War II was a time of harsh discrimination against\nChinese. Japanese occupation and colonialism diminished with the end of World War II. The overseas Chinese\nminority retained an economic advantage because of their former colonial status and their economic connections.\nChinatowns emerged in many of the major cities of Southeast Asia. The discrimination against the Chinese, fueled\nby religious or socioeconomic differences, often continued after World War II by the local ethnic majorities.\nNevertheless, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been instrumental in promoting the global business\narrangements that have established the Pacific Rim as a major player in the international economy.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Southeast Asia can be studied by dividing up the realm into two geographic regions: the mainland and the\ninsular region. The mainland borders China and India and has extensive river systems. The insular region is\nmade up of islands and peninsulas between Asia and Australia, often with mountainous interiors.\n\u2022 France and Britain colonized the mainland region of Southeast Asia. Burma was a British colony and the\nrest was under French colonial rule. The Japanese took control of the region briefly before World War II\nended in 1945. Siam was the only area not colonized. Siam became the country of Thailand.\n\u2022 The physical geography of the mainland and the insular region is dominated by a tropical type A climate.\nCooler temperatures may be found in the mountainous regions and more even temperatures ranges can be\nfound along the coasts. Tectonic plate activity is responsible for the many earthquakes and volcanic\neruptions that occur in the realm.\n\u2022 Southeast Asia is ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse. A number of major ethnic groups\ndominate in the mainland and insular region but are only examples of the multitude of smaller groups that\nexist in the realm. One minority group is the overseas Chinese, who immigrated to the realm during the\ncolonial era. 11.1 Introducing the Realm 898\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Summarize the main economic activities of each country.\n2. Understand how Vietnam was divided by civil war and the impact the war had on the country.\n3. Realize how the country of Laos is addressing its rural landlocked economic situation.\n4. Describe the radical conditions that led to the creation of Democratic Kampuchea.\n5. Outline the physical geography of Thailand and how this country has developed its economy.\n6. Comprehend the conditions in Burma. Learn why the Burmese people would be opposing the government.\nVietnam\nThe elongated state of Vietnam is slightly larger than Italy and about three times the size of the US state of\nKentucky. In 2010 it was estimated to have a population of about ninety million people. Sixty percent of the\npopulation is under age twenty-one. This indicates that the population was only about half its current size at the\nend of the Vietnam War. Vietnam has two main urban core areas: Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) in the south and\nthe capital, Hanoi, in the north. The middle region of Vietnam is narrow, with higher elevation. Each core area\nis located along a major river delta. The Red River delta is located east of Hanoi in the north, and the mighty\nMekong River delta is located next to Saigon in the south. These river deltas deposit silt from upstream and\nprovide excellent farmland for growing multiple crops of rice and food grains per year.\nVietnam has a tropical Type A climate with a long coastline. Fishing provides protein to balance out nutritional\nneeds. More than 55 percent of the population works in agriculture. Family size has dropped dramatically because\nof population growth and a trend toward urbanization. Rural-to-urban shift has caused the two main urban core\ncities to grow rapidly. Saigon is the largest city in Vietnam and has a port that can accommodate oceangoing\n899 11.2 The Mainland Countries 900\nvessels. Hanoi, the capital, is not a port city and is located inland from the nearest port of Haiphong on the coast\nof the Gulf of Tonkin.\nPolitical Geography\nAn understanding of Vietnam is not complete without understanding the changes in political control the country\nof Vietnam has experienced. Different Chinese dynasties controlled Vietnam at different times. When France\ncolonized Vietnam, it imposed the French language as the lingua franca and Christianity as the main religion.\nBoth changes met resistance, but the religious persecution of Buddhism by the French colonizers created harsh\nadversarial conditions within the culture. The French domination started in 1858. The Japanese replaced it in\n1940; this lasted until the end of World War II. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, the French desired to regain\ncontrol of Vietnam. The French aggressively pushed into the country, but met serious resistance and were finally\ndefeated in 1954 with their loss at the battle of Dien Bien Phu.\nFigure 11.3 Southeast Asia and Vietnam 901 World Regional Geography\nThe two main cities of Vietnam are both located next to large rivers. The capital, Hanoi, in the north is on the Red River. Ho Chi\nMinh City (Saigon) to the south is next to the delta of the Mekong River.\nUpdated from map courtesy of Wikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nIn the mid-1950s, the Vietnamese began asserting their request for an independent country. The dynamics were\nsimilar to that of Korea. After 1954, Vietnam needed to establish a government for their independent country.\nThey were not unified. The northern section rallied around Hanoi and was aligned with a Communist ideology.\nThe southern region organized around Saigon and aligned itself with capitalism and democratic reforms.\nDuring the Cold War, the United States opposed Communism wherever it emerged. Vietnam was one such case.\nSupporting South Vietnam against the Communists in the north started not long after the defeat of France. By\n1960, US advisors were working to bolster South Vietnam\u2019s military power. After the assassination of John F. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 902\nKennedy, President Lyndon Johnson had to make a choice to either pull out of Vietnam or push the US military to\nfully engage the Communists in North Vietnam.\nNot wishing Vietnam and its neighbors to \u201cgo Communist\u201d through a domino effect\u2014where if one country fell\nto Communism its neighbors would follow\u2014President Johnson decided to escalate the war in Vietnam. By 1965,\nmore than one half million US soldiers were on the ground in Vietnam. History has recorded the result. Just\nas Vietnam was divided by political and economic ideology, the Vietnam War also divided the US population.\nProtests were common on college campuses and public support for the war was often met with public opposition.\nFigure 11.4 Portrait of Ho Chi Minh, the Communist Leader of North Vietnam during the Cold\nWar 903 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe US government, under President Richard Nixon, finally decided to pull all US troops out from Vietnam after\na cease-fire was agreed upon in a Paris peace conference in 1973. More than fifty-seven thousand US soldiers had\ndied in the Vietnam War. Two years later, in 1975, the North Vietnamese Communists invaded South Vietnam and\ntook control of the entire country. Vietnam was unified under a Communist regime. More than two million people\nfrom South Vietnam escaped as refugees and fled to Hong Kong, the United States, or wherever they could go.\nThousands were accepted by the United States, which caused ethnic rifts in US communities. The United States\nplaced an embargo on Vietnam and refused to trade with them. The United States did not open diplomatic relations\nwith Vietnam again until 1996. The Vietnam War devastated the infrastructure and economy of the country. Roads,\nbridges, and valuable distribution systems were destroyed. Vietnam could only turn to what it does best: growing\nrice and food for its people. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 904\nFigure 11.5 Man Hauling Cut Wood on a Bicycle Cart (Pedicab) by the Perfume River Near the City of Hue, Vietnam\nHeiko Carstens \u2013 Vietnam_full_04 \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nModern Vietnam\nFor the past three decades, Vietnam has been recovering and slowly integrating itself with the outside world.\nIts population has doubled; most of the population was born after the Vietnam War. Their main goal is to seek\nout opportunities and advantages to provide for themselves and their families. Vietnam has been a rural agrarian\nsociety. The two main core cities, however, are now waking up to the outside world, and the outside world is\ndiscovering them. Looking for cheap labor and economic profits, economic tigers such as Taiwan are turning to\nSaigon to set up light manufacturing operations. People from the rural areas are migrating to the cities looking\nfor employment. Saigon has more than 8.5 million people and has a special economic zone (SEZ) located nearby.\nRural-to-urban shift is kicking in. After 1975, the city of Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the\nvictorious Communist leader, Ho Chi Minh. Many of the people who live there and who live in the United States\nstill refer to it as Saigon. 905 World Regional Geography\nAny country that experiences rapid urbanization or economic change suffers from serious growing pains.\nConflicts usually erupt over control of resources and land ownership, ethnic groups usually vie for power, and\nenvironmental damage is usually extensive. All these issues are evident in Vietnam. The dogmatic Communist\ngovernment has acted to moderate both the problems and the economic growth. The future of Vietnam may be\nsimilar to most of Southeast Asia as it balances out the strong adhesive forces of local culture and the demands\nof a competitive global economy. The growing population will add to the demand for resources and employment\nopportunities. Vietnam has been a relatively poor country but it still has been able to export rice and other\nagricultural products. In recent years, the Communist government has implemented a series of reforms moving\ntoward a market economy, which has encouraged economic development and international trade.\nGlobalization has prompted a strong rural-to-urban shift within Vietnam. The rural countryside is still steeped in\nits agrarian heritage based on growing rice and food crops, but the urban centers have been energized by modern\ntechnology and outside economic interest. Vietnam has enormous growth potential. The country\u2019s urban centers\nare shifting from stage 2 of the index of economic development into stage 3, where the urbanization rates are\nthe strongest. The rapid rise of the global economy that is connected to Vietnam\u2019s major cities has provided jobs\nand opportunities that are highly sought after by the growing population. The city streets are filled with a sea of\nmotorbikes and bicycle traffic. Cars are becoming more plentiful. Saigon has been a major destination for the\nexport textile industry and other industries seeking a cheap labor base. Cell phones and Internet services have\nconnected a once-isolated country with the rest of the world.\nLaos\nThe geography of Laos centers on the Mekong River basin and rugged mountain terrain. Laos is landlocked.\nVietnam shields Laos from the South China Sea to the east and Cambodia to the south. It doesn\u2019t have a port city\nto the outside world. The mountains reach up to 9,242 feet. The Type A climate provides a rainy season and a dry\nseason. The rains usually fall between May and November, followed by a dry season for the remainder of the year.\nThe Mekong River flows through the land and provides fresh water, irrigation, and transportation. The country\u2019s\ncapital and largest city, Vientiane, is located on the Mekong River. Laos is about the same size in area as the US\nstate of Utah. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 906\nFigure 11.6 Woman in Attapeu Province, Laos, Cooking Midmorning Snacks for Schoolchildren\nThese snacks are a corn-soy blend shipped in from the United States and sponsored by the US McGovern-Dole Act. Food is provided\nin schools in rural Laos to encourage attendance and enrollment in school. Thousands of children benefit from this program.\nPrince Roy \u2013 Attapeu \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe Lao Kingdom coalesced in the 1500s and was eventually absorbed by the Kingdom of Siam, which thrived\nduring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. France muscled in during the colonial era and created a French\nIndochina. Laos received independence from France in 1949. Laos is a rural country with about 80 percent of the\npopulation working in agriculture. Globalization has not yet been established in this country and infrastructure is\nless developed. Electricity is not available on a consistent basis and transportation systems are quite basic. There\naren\u2019t any railroads and there are few paved roads. Clean water for human consumption is not always available.\nThe economy is based on agriculture, with some outside investments in mining and natural resources.\nTwo-thirds of the people in Laos are Buddhists. Animist traditions and spirit worship have the next highest\npercentage of followers. Muslims and Christians make up a small percentage of the population. Lao make up\nthe largest ethnic group and 70 percent of the population. Other ethnicities include the Hmong and mountain\ntribal groups, which can be found in various remote regions of the country. The remoteness and rural heritage\nof the many tribal people have started to attract tourism. Tourism has increased in recent years, partially due to\nthe Chinese government allowing its citizens to travel outside their borders from China into Laos. Laos has two\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites: the historic town of Luang Prabang, and the southern site of Wat Phou (Vat Phu),\nwhich is an ancient Hindu temple complex.\nLaos is a poor country. It has fewer employment opportunities for its citizens than other developing countries\nhave. The one-party Communist political system of the Cold War has been decentralizing control and working\nto encourage entrepreneurial activities. Foreign investments are increasing in the areas of mining, hydroelectric 907 World Regional Geography\nproduction, and major construction projects. The World Bank and other agencies have supported efforts to\nimprove infrastructure and provide opportunities for the people of Laos. China has been partnering with the\nLaotian government to help build rail transport in the country. These efforts have assisted in reducing poverty and\nincreasing the economic and physical health of the country.\nCambodia\nA Notorious History\nCambodia is about the same size in area as the US state of Missouri. The population in 2008 was estimated at\n14.5 million. The Khmers created the Angkor Empire, which reached its peak between the tenth and thirteenth\ncenturies. Preceding the colonial period, the Angkor Empire entered into a long era of decline. France took control\nof the region in the latter part of the seventeenth century. Japan took control of the region before World War II and\nthen relinquished it when they surrendered to end World War II. France regained control of Cambodia after the\nJapanese army was defeated. Cambodia finally received independence from France in 1953.\nTo understand Cambodia, one has to understand its recent history. This country has undergone some of the\nmost extreme social transitions in modern times. The Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, turned\nsociety upside down, giving the country a legacy that it will carry forward as integration continues into the world\ncommunity.\nBetween 1969 and 1973, while the United States was fighting the Vietnam War, US forces bombed and briefly\ninvaded Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the North Vietnamese military operations and oppose the Khmer Rouge. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 908\nMillions of Cambodians were made refugees by the war, and many ended up in Phnom Penh. The number of\ncasualties from the US bombing missions in Cambodia is unknown. The US war in Vietnam thus had spilled\nover into Laos and Cambodia and advanced the opportunities for the Khmer Rouge regime to gain power. Pol\nPot\u2019s Communist forces of the Khmer Rouge finally captured Cambodia\u2019s capital of Phnom Penh in 1975. The\nKhmer Rouge evacuated all cities and towns and forced the people to move to the rural areas. The country\u2019s name\nwas changed to Democratic Kampuchea. China\u2019s Great Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward disaster\nwere influential for Pol Pot\u2019s radical experiment. Since Vietnam was supported by the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics (USSR), the Khmer Rouge looked to China for arms and support.\nPol Pot was creating an agricultural model for a new country based on eleventh-century ideals. People in urban\nareas were forcibly marched off into the countryside for labor in agriculture. Anyone who resisted or even hinted\nat dissent was killed. All traces of Westernized ideas, technology, medical practice, religion, or books were\ndestroyed. Thousands of people were systematically killed in an attempt to bring into being a rural agrarian\nutopian society. The thousands upon thousands who were systematically eliminated gave rise to the term Killing\nFields, meaning fields where massive groups of people were forced to dig their own graves and then were killed.\nThe mass killings were reminiscent of those carried out by Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. Pol Pot\u2019s regime also targeted\nethnic minority groups. Muslims and Chinese suffered serious purges. Professional, educated people, such as\ndoctors, lawyers, and teachers, were also targeted for execution. According to some reports, the very act of\nwearing eyeglasses was a death sentence as it was a symbol of intellectualism. In a country of eight million in\n1970, more than two million people were executed or died as a result of Pol Pot\u2019s policies. The total number will\nnever be known. Hundreds of thousands became refugees in neighboring countries.\nFigure 11.7 Skulls of the Victims from the Killing Fields of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from the 1970s 909 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nBy 1978, the Khmer Rouge was isolated in the countryside. Vietnamese forces controlled the urban areas. A\ndecade of civil war and unrest followed. Paris peace talks, cease-fires, United Nations\u2013sponsored elections and\ncoalition governments have since helped provide political stability. Pol Pot died under unclear circumstances in\n1998 while being held under house arrest. As of 1999, the Khmer Rouge elements that were still in existence had\nsurrendered or were arrested. Many of the Khmer Rouge leaders were charged with crimes against humanity by\nUnited Nations\u2013sponsored tribunals.\nModern Cambodia\nCambodia is working to become a democratic and open country with established trade relationships with global\nmarkets. The people have struggled to create a stable society that can rebound from their legacy of turmoil and\nconflict. The country\u2019s population is relatively young. More than half the population is under age twenty-five; one- 11.2 The Mainland Countries 910\nthird is under fifteen. The rural areas and the generations who remain there continue to lack the basic amenities\nof modern society. Education, electricity, and modern infrastructure are lacking. More than half the population\nworks in agriculture. Since less than 25 percent of the population lives in cities, Cambodia is likely to experience\na high rural-to-urban shift in its future.\nPeople are returning to religious practices that were banned during the Pol Pot era. Buddhism is the dominant\nreligion of about 95 percent of the population. Small percentages of the population also practice Christianity,\nHinduism, Islam, or tribal beliefs. There are at least twenty distinct hill tribes that hold to their own traditions\nand cultural ways. The country has historically been self-sufficient with food, but the rapid population growth,\npolitical instability, and lack of infrastructure are challenging the future of the country.\nAgriculture has been the main economic activity, though textiles (clothing manufacturing) have increased in\nrecent years because of the low cost of labor combined with an abundant workforce. The international business\nsector has sought to exploit this opportunity, but multinational corporations are hesitant to invest in a country that\nsuffers from political instability or a high level of corruption within the public and private sector.\nFigure 11.8 A Small Section of the Angkor Wat Temple Complex in Northwest Cambodia 911 World Regional Geography\nAngkor Wat is said to be the largest religious structure in the world. Hindu in origin, it was converted to a Buddhist site during the\ncountry\u2019s early years.\nPaul Arps \u2013 Angkor temple (Angkor Wat, Cambodia 2011) \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nCambodia has been attempting to build a sustainable economy. The textile industry is the number one source of\nnational wealth. Sweatshops and low-tech manufacturing have begun to take root in the expanding capital city of\nPhnom Penh. Tourism is another sector that has experienced rapid growth. Though nonexistent in earlier decades,\ntourism has taken off. Cambodian tourism provides travelers with an experience that is more pristine and less\ncommercialized. Tourism has been rated as the second-largest sector of the economy. One of the main sites that\nattract many visitors is the extraordinary ancient site of Angkor Wat (Angkor means \u201ccity\u201d and Wat \u201ctemple\u201d).\nThis site is one of the best-preserved showcases of Khmer architecture from its early empire years. Angkor Wat\nis being developed as a major tourist attraction. The twelfth-century complex was first a Hindu site dedicated to\nVishnu, and then it was converted to a Buddhist site. Angkor Wat has become an international tourist destination.\nIt is one of the largest temple complexes in existence in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The\ncity of Angkor has been estimated to have been the largest city in the world at its peak. As many as a thousand\nother temples and ancient structures have been recovered in the same area in recent years.\nCambodia has pressing environmental problems. The country has the notorious designation by the UN as the\nnation with the third-highest number of land mines on Earth. Since 1970, more than sixty thousand people have\nbeen killed, and many more injured or maimed because of unexploded land mines in rural areas. The growing\npopulation, attempting to recover from decades of devastation, has cut down the rainforest at one of the highest\nrates in the world. In 1970, rainforests covered about 70 percent of the country. Today there is only about 3\npercent of the rainforest left. A rise in the need for resources, along with illegal timber activities, has devastated\nthe forests, resulting in a high level of soil erosion and loss of habitat for indigenous species. The loss of natural\nresources is likely to hinder the country\u2019s economic growth. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 912\nThailand\nThailand is larger than Laos and Cambodia combined but smaller than Burma. The physical regions that make\nup Thailand include the mountainous north, where peaks reach up to 8,415 feet; the large southeastern plateau\nbordering the Mekong River; and the mainly flat valley that dominates the center of the country. The southern\npart of the country includes the narrow isthmus that broadens out to create the Malay Peninsula. The tropical\nType A climate has dry and rainy seasons similar to Cambodia. The weather pattern in the main part of Thailand,\nnorth of the Malay Peninsula, has three seasons. The main rainy season lasts between June and October, when\nthe southwest monsoon arrives with heavy rain clouds from over the Indian Ocean. After the rainy season, the\nland cools off and starts to receive the northeast monsoon, which is a cool dry wind that blows from November\nto February. Considered the dry season, its characteristics are lower humidity and cooler temperatures. From\nMarch to May, the temperatures rise and the land heats up. Then the cycle starts over again with the introduction\nof the rainy season. The weather pattern in the southern part of Thailand in the Malay Peninsula receives more\nrain throughout the year, with two rainy seasons that peak from April through May and then again from October\nthrough December.\nThailand was formerly known as the Kingdom of Siam. In 1932, a constitutional monarchy was established after\na bloodless revolution erupted in the country. The name was officially changed to Thailand in 1939. The ruling\nmonarch remains head of state but a prime minister is head of the government. Siam was never colonized by\neither the Europeans or the Japanese. The leaders of Siam played France and Britain against each other and\nremained independent of colonial domination. During World War II, the Japanese did extend influence in the\nregion. Thailand briefly engaged the Japanese military in World War II but worked out an armistice that used the\nJapanese military to regain territories lost to Britain or France. At the same time, Thailand was working to support\nAllied efforts in the region.\nAbout three-fourths of the population is ethnically Thai. There is a noticeable Chinese population and a small\npercentage of people who are ethnically Malay. There are various minority groups and hill tribes. The country\u2019s\nofficial language is Thai. Buddhism is adhered to by about 95 percent of the population. The ruling monarch\nis considered the defender of the Buddhist faith. Southern Buddhism is fervently practiced here. Thailand does\nnot use the Western Gregorian calendar. Thailand uses an official calendar based on an Eastern translation of the\nBuddhist era, which essentially adds 543 years to the Gregorian calendar. For example, when it was 2010 AD in\nthe West, it was 2553 BE in Thailand.\nThere have been clashes between Thailand\u2019s small Muslim minority groups in the south, which have been\nincreasing since 9-11. Islamic influences have been increasing near the border with Malaysia, which is about 60\npercent Muslim. The Buddhist government of Thailand has sought to keep extremist groups like Al-Qaeda from\noperating within its borders. A series of Muslim-inspired bombings in recent years have increased social tensions\nand brought more attention to the religious division in the south. 913 World Regional Geography\nFigure 11.9 Modern City of Bangkok with High-Rise Office Buildings and Business District\nEfendi Kwok \u2013 Bangkok Skyline \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nThailand has an excellent record of economic growth and has been one of Southeast Asia\u2019s best performers in the\npast couple of decades. Thailand is developing its infrastructure and has established measures to attract foreign\ninvestments and support free-enterprise economic activities. The recent slowdown in the global economy and\ninternal political problems have caused a sharp downturn in Thailand\u2019s economic growth. Nevertheless, Thailand\nremains a strong economic force and one of the best economies in the region. The positive indicators include a\nstrong focus on infrastructure, industrial exports, and tourism.\nUrbanization rates are increasing; at least one-third of the population lives in cities. Family size has fallen to\nlower than two children per family, while education rates have increased. The country has also tapped into its\nnatural resources for export profits as the world\u2019s third-largest exporter of tin and the second-largest exporter\nof tungsten. Light manufacturing has taken off and become a major component of the economy, accounting for\nabout 45 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). The country is a major manufacturer of textiles, footwear,\njewelry, auto parts, and electrical components. Thailand has been the major exporter of rice in the world and has\na strong agricultural base.\nThailand is a newly industrialized country and has all its bases covered to build national wealth: a balance of\nagriculture, extractive activities, manufacturing, and postindustrial activities (tourism). Thailand is considered\nthe third-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles in Asia, after Japan and Korea. Vehicle producers from the\nUnited States and Asia are manufacturing large numbers of cars and trucks in Thailand. Toyota dominates the\nmarket in both truck and auto production. Truck production is augmented by Mitsubishi, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford,\nand Mazda. Honda, from Japan, and the Tata Motor Corporation, from India, are expanding their operations in\nThailand. Thailand is in a good position to advance its economy and shift the whole country into the next stage of\ndevelopment to become a major participant in the global economic marketplace.\nThe tourism industry has grown immensely in Thailand over the past few decades. Green and lush tropical\nmountain landscapes, the exquisite architecture of ancient Buddhist temples, and beautiful golden beaches along\nwarm tropical coastlines make for an excellent tourism market. Some of the best world-class tropical beach\nresorts are located along the sandy and sunny shores of Thailand. The country is open to outsiders and has\nwelcomed tourism as part of its economic equation. The relatively stable country provides a safe and exciting\ntourism agenda that has a global clientele. The downside of the thriving tourism industry is the sex trade. Relaxed 11.2 The Mainland Countries 914\nlaws on sexual activity have made Thailand a destination for people from around the world seeking \u201csex tours\u201d\nand erotic experiences. Not surprisingly, a sharp increase in the number of individuals infected with sexually\ntransmitted diseases has been documented. Approximately one million people in Thailand tested HIV positive\nin the mid-1990s. The sex industry has been big business for Thailand and at the same time has created an\nunfortunate negative stereotype for the overall tourism situation. There is much more to the tourism industry in\nThailand than the sex trade.\nThe country of Thailand has the potential to recover from the global economic downturn and once again claim\nits role as an economic tiger of Southeast Asia. If political stability serves to enhance economic investments, the\ncountry will continue to experience economic growth. The low population growth is a model for other countries in\nthe region. Thailand provides a good example of the theory that as a country urbanizes and industrializes, family\nsize will usually go down. Thailand is also moving forward in the index of economic development. It is in stage 3,\nwhere there is a strong rural-to-urban shift in the population. The capital city of Bangkok has stage 4 development\npatterns and is an economic core area for the country and the region. As large as New York City, Bangkok has\ndeveloped into the political, cultural, and economic center of Southeast Asia. Often referred to as the \u201cVenice\nof the East\u201d because of its city canals, Bangkok has become a global city with a population of more than eight\nmillion people officially and more than fifteen million unofficially.\nMyanmar or Burma\nThe Union of Myanmar (Union of Burma) is the official name for Burma. Since 1989, the military authorities in\nBurma have promoted the name Myanmar as a conventional name for their state. The US government and many\nother governments have not recognized or accepted the name change. Some groups within Burma do not accept\nthe name because the translation of Myanmar is also the name of an ethnic minority in Burma. The use of the\nname Burma or Myanmar is split around the world and within the country.\nBurma is the largest country on the Southeast Asian mainland in terms of physical area. It is about the same size\nin area as Texas and had a population in 2010 of about fifty-four million. The country has a central mass with a\nsouthern protrusion that borders Thailand toward the Malay Peninsula. The northern border area between India\nand China has high mountains that are part of the Himalayas, with towering peaks extending to 19,295 feet. The\nIrrawaddy River cuts through the center of the country from north to south, creating a delta in the largest city,\nRangoon (Yangon). Most of the country\u2019s population lives along this river valley. 915 World Regional Geography\nFigure 11.10 Burma (Myanmar): The Irrawaddy River and the North\/South Layout\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain. 11.2 The Mainland Countries 916\nThere are differences in physical landscape between the north and south. The northernmost area is mountainous\nwith evergreen forests. Cool temperatures are found in the north and warmer annual temperatures are found in the\nsouth. To the west of the Irrawaddy River and north of Mandalay the land cover is mainly deciduous forests. The\neastern region from Mandalay to the Laos border is scrub forests and grasslands. This area is considered the dry\nzone, with an annual rainfall of about forty inches. The more tropical south and coastal areas can receive higher\nlevels of precipitation. The area around the core city of Mandalay was a major focus of agricultural development\nbefore British colonialism. Dryland crops were most common. During the colonial era, the British looked to\nthe rich farmlands of the southern Irrawaddy delta and emphasized Rangoon as the center of their exploitations.\nWetland rice is a major crop of the southern Irrawaddy basin. The southwest and the southern protrusion are\nmainly tropical evergreen forests. There has been oil exploration along the coastal regions of the Bay of Bengal\nand along the Andaman Sea.\nThe country was colonized by the British and was once a part of Great Britain\u2019s empire in South Asia as a province\nof India. Burma was one of the most prosperous colonies of Britain until World War II, when the Japanese\ninvaded and war devastated the region. Democratic rule existed from 1948 until 1962, when an authoritarian\nmilitary dictatorship took over the country. A revolutionary council ruled the country between 1962 and 1974.\nThis government nationalized most of the businesses, factories, and media outlets. The overall operating principle\nof the council was a concept called the Burmese Way of Socialism. This concept was based on central planning\nand Communist principles mixed with Buddhist beliefs.\nBetween 1974 and 1988, the sole political party of the country was the Burma Socialist Program Party, which\nwas controlled by the same military general and his comrades who had been in control for decades. During this\ntime, the rest of the world was advancing in technology and economic development and moving forward with\nadvancements in health care and education. Burma remained an impoverished and isolated nation. A number of\ncountries, including the United States, have trade restrictions with Burma. For decades, the authoritarian regime\nin Burma has been accused of serious human rights violations, which have largely been ignored by the outside\nworld.\nProtests against the military rule have always existed in Burma but have been suppressed by the armed forces and\nthe authoritarian government. In 1962, the government cracked down on demonstrations at Rangoon University,\nresulting in fifteen students being killed and many others in need of medical attention. The military government\nhas taken serious action against any antigovernment protest activities. By 1988, the people of Burma were taking\nto the streets with widespread demonstrations and protests against the government over claims of oppression,\nmismanagement, and lack of democratic reforms. A total crackdown on the people was implemented, with\nthousands of protesters killed. A new council led by a military general created the State Law and Order\nRestoration Council a year later. Martial law was imposed and even harsher policies were imposed on anyone\nopposing the government. This is when the name of Myanmar was first used for the country.\nThe name change and the military rule have not been universally accepted. The United States still refers to the\ncapital city as Rangoon, not as Yangon. In 2006, military rulers moved the capital north to the city of Naypyidaw.\nThe purpose of the move was to establish a forward capital and shift development and political energy more\ntoward the center of the country, rather than along the coast. World nations are divided on the issues of how to deal\nwith the changes and the military regime in Burma. The governments of some countries believe more sanctions\nshould be implemented to force the leadership into compliance. Other countries believe sanctions are not effective 917 World Regional Geography\nagainst the government; that is, sanctions harm the people and do not affect the military leadership. Countries on\nthis side of the equation believe that open trade is the best policy.\nFigure 11.11\nDemonstrators Marching to Express Discontent with the Government of Rangoon (Yangon), 2007\nThe banner, written in Burmese, refers to a national movement to promote nonviolence. A Buddhist monk is in the foreground, and\nthe Shwedagon Pagoda is in the background.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAntigovernment protests erupted in 2007 when the military-ruled government allowed prices on fuel and energy\nto double and triple in price. Protesters were quickly and violently dealt with and many were arrested and\njailed. Later that year, thousands of Buddhist monks led a peaceful protest to gain the government\u2019s attention to\nmake democratic changes. The demonstration ended in a renewed government crackdown. Another voice in the\nantigovernment demonstrations has been that of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a UN worker in the early 11.2 The Mainland Countries 918\n1960s and a Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1991. Her opposition to the military rule has led to imprisonment and\nhouse arrest for decades. She has been a symbol of the opposition and hope for democratic reforms. In 2010,\nAung San Suu Kyi was at long last released from house arrest and allowed more freedom of movement under\ngovernment restrictions.\nBurma has been placed in the same category as North Korea and Somalia in terms of authoritarian rule, lack of\nhuman rights, and stagnant economy. Economic conditions are poor. The military rulers have gained control of\nthe main income-generating enterprises in the country, including the lucrative drug trade from the prime opium\ngrowing region of the northern Golden Triangle, where Burma borders Laos and Thailand. All factors seem to\nindicate an increase in opium production in recent years. Precious gemstones such as rubies, sapphires, and jade\nare abundant in Burma. Rubies bring the highest incomes. Burma produces about 90 percent of the world\u2019s supply,\nwith superb quality. The Valley of Rubies in the north is noted for quality gem production of both rubies and\nsapphires. Most of the gems are sold to buyers in Thailand. All the profits go to Burma\u2019s military rulers in the\ngovernment, and since there is a high level of corruption and mismanagement within the government and business,\nthe income from the gems produces limited economic development for the main population and discourages\nforeign investment in the country. Burma has become one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia. China has\nemerged as the main trading partner with Burma and has been propping up the dictatorial military regime. China\nsupplies the regime with arms, constructs many of the infrastructure projects, and supplies natural gas to the\ncountry.\nBurma is ethnically diverse. Though it is difficult to verify, the government of Burma recognizes one hundred\nthirty-five distinct ethnic groups within its borders. It is estimated that there are over a hundred different\nethnolinguistic groups in Burma. About 90 percent of the population is Buddhist. This high level of diversity can\nallow for strong centrifugal forces that are not generally conducive to unity and nationalism. The heavy emphasis\non the national military is one of the only centripetal forces within the population, even though the military\nleadership is also looked at with distain by those desiring more openness and democratic conditions.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 France and Britain colonized the mainland region of Southeast Asia. Burma was a British colony and the\nrest was under French colonial rule. The Japanese took control of the region briefly before World War II\nended in 1945. Siam was the only area not colonized. Siam became the country of Thailand.\n\u2022 Vietnam was divided by a Communist north and a capitalist south during the Cold War. Vietnam is emerging\nfrom decades of isolation to provide the global economy with a large low-cost labor pool that has been\nattracting foreign investments by multinational corporations.\n\u2022 The rural and landlocked nation of Laos has strong Buddhist traditions and an agrarian society.\n\u2022 Cambodia was impacted by the Vietnam War and then by the devastation of Pol Pot\u2019s Khmer Rouge radical\nexperiment in agrarian socialism, which killed as many as 2.5 million people. Recovery has been slow, but\nthe textile industry and tourism have contributed to economic growth.\n\u2022 The Buddhist country of Thailand has been experiencing major economic development in recent decades\nand has established itself as a major economic power in the region. The modern capital city of Bangkok is a\nmajor center of manufacturing and cultural activities.\n\u2022 The people of Burma (Myanmar) continue to suffer under an authoritarian regime that offers few civil rights\nor democratic processes to its people. Poor, isolated, and militarily controlled, Burma has been at the center 919 World Regional Geography\nof many human rights violations in recent decades with little response from the international community.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

There is also a high level of linguistic and religious\ndiversity. The physical geography varies from island to island; some have high mountain relief and others are\nlow-lying and relatively flat. Active tectonic plate action in the region causes earthquakes and volcanic activity,\nresulting in destruction of infrastructure and loss of life; both acutely impact human activities.\nEconomic forces continue to prompt the countries of Southeast Asia to enter into trade relationships that integrate\nthem with global networks based on dependency and reliance. The old colonial powers may no longer control\nthem politically but may affect them economically. The new dynamics of corporate colonialism, with their\neconomic power located in the core economic regions, still seek to exploit the countries of Southeast Asia for their\nlabor and resources. These Asian nations are working to develop their own economies and use their own labor and\nresources to gain national wealth and increase the standard of living for their people. Each country has to contend\nwith globalization forces within the international network of economic relationships.\n920 921 World Regional Geography\nMalaysia\nMalaysia is a country made up of various British colonies that came together as a federation and then became\nan independent country. Britain started establishing colonies in the region in the late 1700s. The two main areas\ninclude the western colonies on the Malay Peninsula and the eastern colonies on the island of Borneo. The western\nsettlements were part of the Malay Peninsula, which included the colonies of Pinang and Singapore. Eventually,\nthe British took control of the eastern colonies of Brunei, Sarawak, and Sabah on the island of Borneo. In 1957,\nthe western colonies on the mainland peninsula broke from their British colonizers and became an independent\ncountry called the Federation of Malaya. In 1963, the British Borneo colonies of Sarawak and Sabah joined the\nFederation of Malaya to form the current country, which is called Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore broke off from\nMalaysia and became an independent country. Brunei, which was still a British protectorate, became independent\nin 1984.\nMalaysia has two main land areas separated by the South China Sea. The regions of Sarawak and Sabah, on the\nisland of Borneo, are called East Malaysia; the mainland on the Malay Peninsula is called West Malaysia. These\nregions have similar physical landscapes, which include coastal plains with nearby densely forested foothills and\nmountains. The highest mountains, rising 13,436 feet, are in East Malaysia on the island of Borneo. Located near\nthe equator, Malaysia has a tropical Type A climate with monsoons regularly occurring from October to February.\nFigure 11.12 Provinces in East and West Malaysia 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 922\nDiversity of Culture and Ethnicity in Malaysia\nMalaysia\u2019s culture is diverse in that several major religions are practiced within its borders. Islam is considered\nthe official religion and is supported by at least 60 percent of the population. About 20 percent of the people\nare Buddhists, 10 percent Christians, and 6 percent Hindu. The remaining percentages of the population include\ntraditional Chinese religions and local tribal beliefs. In this Islamic country, there are concerns that Muslims\nget preferential treatment by government programs and policies. There are even special judicial legal courts for\nMuslims only to work out issues regarding marriage, custody, inheritance, or other conflicting Islamic issues\nregarding faith and obligation. This court only hears Islamic issues and no other legal matters. There have\nbeen movements by minority extremist groups that would like to see Malaysia shift toward a true Islamic state,\ncomplete with the Sharia Criminal Code as the law of the land. The movement, however, has been cracked down\non by the government. Since the 9-11 incident in the United States, there has been more concern about extremist\nreligious views.\nPeople of Malay ethnic background make up more than 50 percent of the population. People of Chinese descent\nare the second-largest group at about 24 percent. An additional 11 percent of the population is made up of\nindigenous groups. During British colonialism, a number of people from South Asia were brought to Malaysia.\nFor example, Tamils were brought from India to work the plantations. Their Hindu beliefs were infused into the\nculture and some Tamils also converted to Christianity. Sikhs were brought from South Asia to help Britain run\nthe country as police, soldiers, or security officers. The Sikhs who came brought their religion with them, which\nadded to the multireligious dynamics of the country.\nFigure 11.13 The Tuaran Road of Kota Kinabala City in Malaysia during a Time of Slow Traffic 923 World Regional Geography\nNotice that the cars are driving on the same side of the road as they would be in Great Britain, Malaysia\u2019s former colonizer.\nJason Thien \u2013 Busy Roads of Kota Kinabalu City \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nMalaysia\u2019s diverse ethnic and cultural mix often results in strong centrifugal forces that push and pull on\nthe societal dynamics of the country. China has been active in the business community and has established\nstrong economic ties with regional countries that have Chinese populations. The single largest minority group\nin the province of Sarawak on Borneo is Chinese. As a minority group, Chinese citizens of Malaysia have felt\ndiscrimination. Since the official language is Malay and the official religion is Islam, there have been concerns\nabout discrimination against all minority groups. Working through the cultural and ethnic diversity has been a\nmajor challenge for the country. Each minority religious or ethnic group desires to celebrate its own special\nholidays. For example, there is the usual New Year\u2019s celebration on January 1, and then there is the traditional\nfifteen-day Chinese New Year celebration celebrated at a different time of the year. Sikhs celebrate the Sikh\nNew Year. Buddhists celebrate a holiday in honor of the life and enlightenment of Buddha. Christians celebrate\nChristmas and Easter. Many other holidays of significance are respected or honored by various minority groups. 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 924\nEconomic Development in Malaysia\nMalaysia has rapidly advanced its economy in recent decades and is modernizing its infrastructure\u2014roads,\nbridges, highways, and urban facilities. In the capital city, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia built a modern central\nbusiness district with a twin high-rise office building claimed to be the world\u2019s tallest at the time of construction.\nBefore the global economic downturn that started in 2007, Malaysia had developed a fast-growing economy and\nwas industrializing at a rapid rate. Malaysia has taken advantage of its location on a major shipping lane and has\nshifted to manufacturing as an important sector of its economy. The country has been a leader in the export of\nnatural resources such as tin, rubber, and palm oil and has developed its agricultural and extractive sectors to gain\nincome. The 1980s and 1990s were prosperous times for the country and it matured its manufacturing base from\nlight textiles into electronics and heavy industries.\nOne aspect of the country that is looming on the horizon and may cause problems is the high population growth\nrate. In 2010, Malaysia\u2019s population was estimated at more than twenty-five million, with a doubling time of about\nforty years. Though the country is 70 percent urban, family size (fertility rate) is still at about 3.0, which indicates\nan increasing population growth pattern. One-third of the population is under the age of fifteen. Malaysia is one\ncase where the general principle that if a country urbanizes and industrializes the family size will go down has not\ntaken place fast enough. The fertility rate has dropped from 5.0 to 3.0, but it needs to get below a rate of about 2.0\nif the country is going to successfully stabilize its population growth. Unless the country addresses this population\ngrowth, the demand for resources might outstrip economic progress in the future.\nSingapore\nUnder British colonial rule, the island of Singapore was included in the Malaysian federation. It broke away and\nbecame independent in 1965. It is a small island measuring about thirty miles long at its widest point. Singapore is\nabout two hundred forty square miles in area. Singapore\u2019s most valuable resource is its relative location. Singapore\nis similar to Hong Kong in its development. With a good port, Singapore is a hub for ships sailing between Europe\nand China. It serves Southeast Asia as an entrep\u00f4t, or break-of-bulk point, where goods are offloaded from large\nships and transported to smaller vessels for distribution to the Southeast Asian community. 925 World Regional Geography\nFigure 11.14 Singapore and Neighboring Countries\nSingapore has made good strategic utilization of its geographic location by serving as a distribution center for\ngoods and materials processed in the region. Crude oil from Indonesia is unloaded and refined here. Raw materials\nare shipped in, manufactured into finished products, and then shipped out to global markets. Since Singapore\nis small, it has had to concentrate on manufacturing goods that provide for optimal profits. As an economic\ntiger, Singapore has transitioned through the same stages as Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong to become an\neconomic power in Southeast Asia.\nTo keep labor costs low, initial manufactured products were textiles, clothing, and cheap goods. As incomes and\nlabor skills rose, so did the complexity of the manufactured goods. The government of Singapore has targeted\ncertain types of products to ensure a high profit margin and a global market need. This has included automation\nequipment, biotechnology, and high-end information technologies. Singapore doesn\u2019t manufacture automobiles\nbut it does manufacture automation robotic components that most modern auto manufactures will purchase and\nuse. Medical technology is expensive and is in high demand the world over. Singapore is targeting this market.\nThe information age has spawned new technologies that are evolving rapidly and, once again, Singapore has been\nat the center of this industry. Singapore has been a center for the production of computer disc drives for a multitude\nof global corporations. 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 926\nSingapore Island is a swampy place with no natural resources. All production components, food goods,\nconstruction materials, and energy must be imported. Importing everything has raised the cost of living. To\ncompete with the other Asian economic tigers in the global marketplace, Singapore has implemented severe\ncontrol measures on its operations. There are harsh penalties for criminal activities and for even misdemeanor\noffenses. Singapore is a safe place to live because of its strict state rules. It has an authoritarian government, which\nstrives to create an attractive place for international corporations to operate. One of the objectives is to eliminate\ncorruption and establish a business-friendly environment.\nFigure 11.15 Singapore\u2019s Modern Development\nModern high-rise office buildings fill the central business district of Singapore. The administrative district can be seen in the\nforeground complete with British colonial architecture, established when Singapore was a British colony.\nBrian Evans \u2013 Singapore \u2013 CC BY-ND 2.0.\nThe government of Singapore has entered into trade agreements with two of its neighbors to provide raw materials\nand cheap labor. A trade triangle has been established between Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Malaysia\nand Indonesia provide Singapore with raw materials and cheap labor; Singapore provides its neighbors with 927 World Regional Geography\ntechnical know-how and financial support. Everyone benefits. Singapore is an excellent example of the upper\nend of the economic spectrum in Southeast Asia. Countries like Laos or Vietnam would be at the opposite end,\nsince they have a largely rural population based on agriculture that is just beginning to shift to the cities with\nindustrialization. Singapore is already 100 percent urban with high incomes based on high-tech manufacturing\nand processing of raw materials. Singapore is an economic hub for Southeast Asia, complete with global airline\nconnections and is located on a major shipping lane. Singapore\u2019s world-class port is one of the busiest in Asia. The\nrest of Southeast Asia is somewhere in between these two ends of the spectrum as far as economic development\nis concerned.\nIndonesia\nThe country of Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelago state, consisting of more than 17,500 islands, about\none-third of which are inhabited. Indonesia is the sixteenth-largest country in the world by area. The combined\narea of all the islands and regions of Indonesia would equal about the size of the country of Mexico. The country\nshares land borders with the Borneo side of Malaysia, the western half of the island of Timor, and the western\nportion of the island of New Guinea, which is shared with the country of Papua New Guinea.\nThe country\u2019s location on both sides of the equator provides a tropical Type A climate, complete with a monsoon\nseason. Average rainfall can vary from seventy to two hundred forty inches per year. The highest mountain is in\nWest Papua and rises to about 16,024 feet. Indonesia is located on the Pacific Rim, where tectonic plate activity\nproduces earthquakes and volcanic activity. The country is home to over one hundred fifty active volcanoes,\nincluding two of the most famous ones, Krakatoa and Tambora. Both had devastating eruptions in the past two\ncenturies. One of the most violent volcanic explosions ever recorded in human history came from Krakatoa, which\nis located between the islands of Java and Sumatra. A series of eruptions in 1883 were heard as far away as\nthe coast of Africa. Shockwaves reverberated around the globe seven times. Ash erupted into the atmosphere to\na height of about fifty miles. The official death toll was 36,417, but estimates from local sources place it as high\nas 120,000. Global temperatures fell by about 2 \u00b0F, and weather patterns were disrupted for the next five years.\nKrakatoa remains active. Over the past few decades, the volcanic peak has been growing at the average rate of\nabout five inches per week. 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 928\nFigure 11.16 Major Islands and the Thirty-Three National Provinces of Indonesia\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe tropical climate and the archipelago nature of the country provide for enormous biodiversity within the\nenvironment. Second only to Brazil in its biodiversity, Indonesia is host to an enormous number of unique plants\nand animals. The habitats of many of these creatures are being encroached upon by human activity. The remote\nislands have more of a chance of escaping habitat devastation and remaining intact, but agricultural and extractive\neconomic activities have converted much of the natural environment into a cultural landscape that is not conducive\nto environmental sustainability.\nAnimals such as orangutans are losing their natural forests and may become extinct if current trends continue.\nThe timber industry has brought about deforestation. Slash and burn agriculture has destroyed forest habitat, and\nhuman development patterns such as roads and urbanization have altered the ecosystems of the region. According\nto recent reports, Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world because of the high\nnumber of forest fires set each year. In 2009, the United States brokered a deal with Indonesia to forgive thirty\nmillion dollars of its debt if the country would work to protect forests on the island of Sumatra, which is home to\nendangered indigenous animals such as tigers, elephants, rhinos, and orangutans.\nIn 2010, the estimated population of Indonesia was about 245 million. Indonesia has the fourth-largest population\nof any country in the world, after the United States, India, and China. Indonesia also has more Muslims than any\nother country in the world. More than half the population of Indonesia lives on Java, the island where Jakarta,\nthe capital city, is located. Java is the most populous island in the world, and has a population density of more\nthan 2,400 people per square mile. Java is the size in area of the US state of Louisiana. Java has 135 million\npeople, whereas Louisiana has 4.5 million people. Jakarta is a world-class city that is larger than New York City\nand encompasses a large metropolitan area, complete with many manufacturing centers, business complexes, and\nhousing districts.\nThe many islands of Indonesia are home to a large number of diverse ethnic and religious groups that vary as\nwidely as any Southeast Asian nation. There may be as many as three hundred different and distinct ethnic groups\nin Indonesia. Many of the ethnic groups are further divided by islands or distance. More than two hundred fifty\nseparate languages and hundreds of additional dialects are spoken. There are an estimated seven hundred fifty\nlanguages spoken on the island of New Guinea itself, with hundreds of them spoken on the Indonesian side of the\nisland, in a population of less than three million. The most prevalent language group in the country as a whole 929 World Regional Geography\nis Javanese, which is spoken by about 42 percent of the population. Javanese includes the official language of\nIndonesian, which is taught in schools and used in business and politics as the lingua franca of the country. Many\npeople speak more than one language or even a number of languages to communicate throughout the country.\nIslam was diffused to Indonesia in the thirteenth century and by the sixteenth century had become the dominant\nreligion. The Indonesian constitution allows for religious freedom, although more than 85 percent of the\npopulation follows Islam. There are at least four other religions that are officially recognized: Christianity (both\nProtestantism and Roman Catholicism), Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Since Islam is followed by such\na large percentage of the population, the other religions do not carry the same influence. Regional and ethnic\ndifferences play a role in the varied religious dynamics. The island of Bali, for example, is home to a majority\nHindu population. Most of the Buddhists are ethnically Chinese, and they only make up a small percentage of the\npopulation. Christians and Muslims have had conflicts on the island of Sulawesi. It is common to find the practice\nof these religions less than orthodox in the more rural communities of the country.\nFigure 11.17 Skyline of Jakarta, the Capital of Indonesia\nJakarta has a population of about ten million and is located on the island of Java. Java has more than 135 million people and has\nabout the same physical area as the US state of Louisiana, which has about 4.5 million people. Java has more people than any other\nisland in the world.\nGlobal Panorama \u2013 Jakarta, Indonesia \u2013 CC BY-SA 2.0.\nIn spite of the diversity within the population, the country of Indonesia has established a substantial degree of 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 930\nnationalism as a centripetal force that holds the country together. There is a relatively high degree of stability in\nspite of the surface tensions or ethnic and religious conflicts that may erupt. An example of the social tensions is\ndemonstrated in the case of Chinese citizens of Indonesia, who only make up about 1 percent of the population\nbut impart a substantial influence over the privately owned business sector of the economy. This seemingly\ninequitable relationship has resulted in considerable resentment by other portions of the population, often with\nviolent results. The many islands have become natural divisions between cultural groups.\nSome of the islands\u2014or portions of them\u2014have attempted to break away in a devolutionary manner and become\nindependent countries. Just as East Timor became independent, the most western province of Aceh on the island\nof Sumatra had a similar movement toward independence. West Papua on the island of New Guinea has also had\nan independence movement. The Aceh situation was negotiated out while the West Papua movement has been\nsuppressed by military and political force. Many of the islands possess large amounts of natural resources, so the\ncountry of Indonesia does not want to lose these national assets that could prove valuable in gaining wealth for\nthe future. It is not easy to create national unity with such a diverse population scattered throughout such a large\narchipelago.\nAgriculture has been the historic base of the Indonesian economy. In 2010, it accounted for about 13 percent of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Agriculture is the largest employment sector\u2014approximately 42 percent\nof the workforce. This equates to more than half of the population being rural. Many of the agricultural methods in\nrural areas are traditional; for example, farmers use water buffalo or oxen for tilling the land. The tropical climate\nand adequate rainfall provide for multiple crops of rice per year in many areas. Spices, coffee, tea, palm oil, and\nrubber are also produced in substantial quantities.\nIndustries are an important building block for how a country gains wealth. In the case of Indonesia, industry\naccounts for about 40 percent of its GDP and employs about 20 percent of its workforce. Major industries include\noil, natural gas, mining, and textiles or clothing manufacturing. Indonesia\u2019s economy has been affected by global\nmarkets, but in 2005 still managed to run a trade surplus. Japan has been its main trading partner, and China has\nalso been a major supplier of imported goods. Indonesia has been taking advantage of the trade triangle it has with\nits neighbors, Singapore and Malaysia, to increase its import and export trade activities.\nThe political background of Indonesia is similar in dynamics to many of its neighbors. Colonized by Europeans,\nIndonesia was previously called the Dutch East Indies, which explains why the islands of the Caribbean were\ncalled the West Indies. The Dutch colonized Indonesia in the early seventeenth century but had to relinquish\npossession of the archipelago to the Japanese in World War II. In 1945, after the Japanese surrendered, Indonesia\ndeclared its independence, which was finally granted in 1949 after much negotiation. The country\u2019s government\nquickly moved toward authoritarian rule.\nDuring a fifty-year time period, there were only two authoritarian leaders: Sukarno (1949\u201368) and Suharto\n(1968\u201399). Near the end of Sukarno\u2019s rule, there were violent conflicts between Sukarno\u2019s military and the\nCommunist Party of Indonesia, which resulted in more than five hundred thousand deaths. Suharto\u2019s regime\nwas credited for substantial economic growth but was also accused of serious corruption and the repression\nof opposition political voices. Since 1999, Indonesia has conducted free parliamentary elections and is now\nconsidered the third-largest democracy, after India and the United States. 931 World Regional Geography\nBrunei\nThere are noticeable similarities between the oil-rich sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf region in the Middle East and\nthe small sultanate of Brunei on the northern coast of Borneo. Bordered by Sarawak, the sultanate is actually two\nsmall separate regions along the coast of the South China Sea. The former British protectorate of Brunei is today\na major oil and natural gas exporter. It provides a high standard of living for its small population. The compact\ncountry is about the size of the US state of Delaware. The country\u2019s population for 2009 was listed at about\n388,000. Brunei is attracting immigrants seeking opportunities and advantages. It is called a sultanate because the\nkingdom has been ruled by sultans (rulers) from the same family for the past six centuries.\nFigure 11.18 Brunei 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 932\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nThe main ethnic groups in Brunei are Malay, at 66 percent, and Chinese, at 11 percent. Brunei is an Islamic\nState with Islam as its state religion. About two-thirds of the population is Muslim. Buddhism is the second-most\npopular religion. The ruling sultan is not only head of state but also prime minister of the government and leader\nof the Islamic faith. Similar to states in the Middle East where Islam is the official religion, alcohol is banned\nand the public consumption or sale of it is illegal. Prohibition against alcohol has eliminated the establishments\nof pubs and nightclubs. Non-Muslims and visitors to the country can legally hold small quantities of alcohol for\npersonal consumption.\nThe people of Brunei have a high standard of living, with the availability of modern amenities. The government\nhas been concerned about integrating the country into the global economy. Natural gas and crude oil bring in about\n90 percent of exports and just over half of the GDP. Education and medical care is free. Food, housing, and rice\nfarming are subsidized by the state. The state has been working to expand the economy beyond natural gas and\noil. Agricultural production has been increased and unemployment has been a major focus. The wealthy emirate\nhas also been developing its tourism sector and the financial and banking industry.\nBrunei may have to take a lesson from the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\u2014that is, to work to develop a free trade\nzone to attract international trade\u2014if the country wants to continue to gain wealth once the oil and natural gas run 933 World Regional Geography\nout. It has an excellent location on the South China Sea but would have to compete with the established economic\ntigers of Singapore and Hong Kong as well as the other rising urban centers in the region, such as Kuala Lumpur\nor Bangkok.\nThe Philippines\nLocated on the eastern side of the Southeast Asian community is the archipelago state of the Philippines. With\nmore than 7,100 islands, many volcanic peaks, and an expanse of coastal waterways, the Philippines is home\nto more than ninety million people in a combined land area about the size of Arizona. The Philippines were\na Spanish colony. The name is taken from Spain\u2019s sixteen-century King Philip II. Spain relinquished its claim\non the Philippines to the United States in 1898 after its defeat in the Spanish-American War. The people of\nthe Philippines wanted independence at that time and fought a bitter war with the United States in which more\nthan a million people died. The United States allowed the Philippines to become a commonwealth in 1935. The\nindependence movement was placed on hold while the Japanese invaded and controlled the Philippines during\nWorld War II. After the war was over, the United States granted the Philippines their independence in 1946.\nEnvironmental Forces\nThe islands of the Philippines are of volcanic origin. They are mainly mountainous and covered in tropical\nrainforest. The highest mountain, at 9,692 feet, is Mt. Apo, which is located on the southern island of Mindanao.\nThe Philippines has a number of active volcanoes. The northern island of Luzon is home to the Taal Volcano, Mt.\nPinatubo, and Mt. Mayon. The Pacific tectonic plate reaches the southern edge of the Philippine plate where it 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 934\nmeets up with the Eurasian Plate. The juncture of tectonic plates creates a similar situation to that of Tokyo, which\nis at the opposite end of the Philippine plate. Active seismic forces result in many earthquakes. As many as twenty\nearthquakes a day can be registered here, though many are too weak to be noticed. In 1990, an earthquake on the\nisland of Luzon registered at a magnitude of 7.8 and killed more than 1,621 people, causing extensive damage.\nFigure 11.19 Ash Plume from Mt. Pinatubo during 1991 Eruption\nThe island of Luzon in the Philippines has a number of active volcanoes. Ash from Mt. Pinatubo caused so much damage that it\nresulted in the permanent closure of major US military bases in the Philippines.\nUGS \u2013 public domain.\nLuzon\u2019s Mt. Pinatubo volcano has been active in recent years. Before 1991, the mountain attracted little attention,\nwas heavily forested, and was home to tribal indigenous people. The volcano had a colossal eruption in 1991\nthat was recorded as the second largest in a century, after Alaska\u2019s 1912 Novarupta eruption. Mt. Pinatubo began\ngiving signs of an eruption, which were heeded by the government. Thousands of people were evacuated from the\narea, which saved many lives. The eruption caused billions of dollars in damage. More than eight hundred people 935 World Regional Geography\nwere killed, and more than two million were directly impacted. The eruption destroyed more than eight thousand\nhomes and the overall effects of the volcano were felt around the world.\nMt. Pinatubo\u2019s eruption forced billions of tons of magma, ash, sulfur dioxide, minerals, and particulates into the\natmosphere and onto the earth\u2019s surface. The sun was blocked out, temperatures dropped, and ash piled up in\nnearby areas, causing extensive damage to roofs, roadways, and agricultural lands. The damage from the eruption\nwas amplified by the fact that a full-scale typhoon hit the country on the same date, bringing torrential rainfall and\nwind that mixed with the ash in the air to create extremely dangerous environmental conditions. The damage had\na massive impact on the entire economy of the Philippines.\nThe eruption severely damaged civilian infrastructure and US military bases in the region. The Subic Bay Naval\nBase was fifty miles to the southwest of Mt. Pinatubo\u2019s summit, while Clark Air Base was less than sixteen miles\nto the east. Enormous clouds of ash covered everything. As a result of the damage to the operations at the bases,\nthe United States Air Force evacuated and moved all air base personnel and military assets to bases in Guam,\nOkinawa, or Hawaii. The United States ultimately abandoned Clark Air Base, while Subic Bay reverted to the\nPhilippines. There are thirty-seven volcanoes in the Philippines, of which eighteen are still active. Mt. Mayon is\nthe most active volcano at the present time. It has had forty-seven eruptions in recorded history. The eruption in\n1993 killed sixty-eight people and caused the evacuation of sixty thousand more.\nEarthquakes and volcanoes are not the only serious natural concerns of the Philippine Islands; they are also\ndirectly in the center of the Western Pacific\u2019s major typhoon belt. As many as twenty typhoons occur yearly in\nthe area of the islands, and as many as half hit the islands directly. The 1991 typhoon Thelma\/Uring killed as\nmany as eight thousand people. The 1911 typhoon dumped over forty-six inches of rain in a twenty-four-hour\nperiod. Flooding is usually the main problem with typhoons and is the number one killer related to typhoon deaths.\nFor more information, see Chapter 5 \u201cMiddle America\u201d, Section 5.5 \u201cTropical Cyclones (Hurricanes)\u201d. Typhoon\nactivity also brings precipitation to the islands and the region. The Philippines are in the major path of typhoons\nin the Pacific and will continue to combat the effects of these powerful forces of nature.\nPolitical Geography\nThe Philippines can be divided into three main geopolitical regions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The\nnorthern island of Luzon is home to the nation\u2019s national capital region with Quezon, the largest city, and Manila,\nthe capital. Both cities are a part of metropolitan Manila, which has a population of more than twenty million.\nThe northern island of Luzon is home to half the population of the country. The central Philippines consists of the 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 936\nVisayas Island group, including the islands between the Sulu Sea and the Philippine Sea. The southern region of\nthe country is anchored by the large island of Mindanao.\nFigure 11.20 The Three Main Regions of the Philippines 937 World Regional Geography\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain. 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 938\nThe government of the Philippines is a constitutional republic with an elected president. With independence in\n1946 came various leaders who have shaped the political landscape of the Philippines. After recovering from the\ndevastation of World War II, the country prospered during the 1960s and showed positive economic gains. The\npolitical scene entered a difficult political era with the election of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1965, which\nturned into an authoritative dictatorship. During his time in power, the economy became sluggish and social unrest\nbegan to arise in opposition to his leadership.\nBarred by law from being elected for a third time, Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972 under the\npremise that there was too much political conflict with Communist elements and Islamic insurgencies. Marcos\nruled with his wife Imelda Marcos until 1986, when conditions worsened and the two were implicated in\nthe assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino. Corruption, vote rigging, and the dictatorial actions of\nPresident Marcos caught up with him through mass protests, which eventually led to his removal from office. He\nleft the Philippines for his exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that during his twenty years in office, Ferdinand\nand Imelda Marcos had embezzled billions of dollars of public funds and moved them to bank accounts in\nSwitzerland, the United States, other countries, and into fictitious money-laundering corporations. Ferdinand\nMarcos died of illness in 1989 in Honolulu.\nImelda Marcos returned to the Philippines to run for public office and even attempted a failed run for the\npresidency. Imelda was known for her thousands of shoes, which she had acquired while in power. Many of them\nare in a shoe museum in the Philippines. She was also known for her extravagant spending trips around the world.\nSeveral different political leaders have come to power since the Ferdinand Marcos era. Political stability has been\ndifficult to achieve. The national leadership has faced Islamic insurgencies, attempted coups, corruption in the\ngovernment, and a high national debt. These issues continue today but a modest level of stability has encouraged\neconomic growth.\nCultural Geography\nThe Philippines is a diverse country with hundreds of ethnic groups. Many tribal groups as well as a large number\nof immigrants from Asia, Spain, and the United States have made the Philippines home. Together with Spanish\ninfluence, mixed ethnic groups have been created. They are an example of the confluence of cultures that make\nup the country. The Philippines is the only country in Asia where Roman Catholicism predominates, other than\nrecently independent East Timor. 939 World Regional Geography\nFigure 11.21\nFerdinand Magellan brought Christianity to the Philippines and converted members of the Cebuano tribe to Catholicism in 1521.\nLezumbalaberenjena \u2013 Catedral de Santa Clara \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nChristians make up about 90 percent of the population. All but 10 percent identify themselves as Roman Catholic.\nA modest Muslim population is prominent in the southern island of Mindanao and neighboring islands. Islamic\nfundamentalism has increased the insurgency in the region, causing political and economic turmoil and conflict.\nPeople of Chinese heritage often follow Buddhism, Taoism, or Chinese folk religions. Various tribal groups still\nfollow their cultural animist beliefs and have traditional shaman religious leaders.\nThe Philippines is home to more than one hundred eighty native languages and dialects. English and Filipino\nwere declared the official languages of the Philippines in 1987. Tagalog is the main language spoken. Filipino is\na version of Tagalog that is used in many of the urban areas. English and Tagalog are used in different parts of the\ncountry. The population growth rate is considerable. The Philippines will soon push past the one hundred million\nmark, at which point it will become a country in which 35 percent of its citizens are under the age of fifteen.\nAverage family size is more than 3.2, which will continue to influence the economic situation of the country. 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 940\nThe Global Economy and Outsourcing\nThe modest level of political stability has caused the Philippines to become an attractive destination for global\ncorporations who seek to outsource their information and technology service jobs. Any work that can be\nconducted over the Internet or telephone can be outsourced to anywhere in the world with high-speed\ncommunication links. Countries that are attractive to business process outsourcing (BPO) are countries where\nthe English language is prominent, where employment costs are low, and where there is an adequate labor base\nof skilled or educated workers that can be trained in the services required. All three of these requirements are met\nby the labor force of the Philippines. The historical influence of the United States has provided a base of English\nlanguage speakers. The country also has an adequate population base with the education or professional skills\nnecessary to meet these demands. Corporate colonialism has the Philippines in its business focus and is finding a\ngood source of available labor.\nIn 2005, information technology and BPO amounted to about thirty-four billion dollars globally. Since 2005,\nthat amount has increased dramatically, doubling and tripling in some countries by 2009. India has been a major\ndestination for BPO, but the Philippines is gaining ground and increasing its infrastructure in an attempt to gain\na larger share of the market. Other countries around the world are a part of this outsourcing market. This type\nof business activity shifts jobs from one country to another. A country might lose these types of jobs, but its\ncorporations can remain competitive in the global marketplace if they can cut costs of operation by outsourcing\ntheir service work to a low-cost country.\nFigure 11.22 Street Scene in Manila with Jeepney on the Left and a Bicycle Card Front and Center 941 World Regional Geography\nThe greater metropolitan region of Manila has more than twenty million people. The city of Manila itself is one of the most densely\npopulated large cities in the world.\nStefan Munder \u2013 Manila \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nJeepneys\nThe term jeepney is derived from the use of early US army jeeps left over from World War II that were used as base\nvehicles transformed into a type of taxi. These transformed vehicles took on a cultural identity as jeepneys with their\nflamboyant colors and extended seating. Jeepneys are now produced for this purpose and are the most widely used\npublic transportation mode in the Philippines. An electric version of the jeepney is being developed for a number of\nAsian countries.\nUS corporate giants like America Online, Texas Instruments, Citibank, Hewlett Packard, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,\nand the McClatchy Company (third-largest US newspaper company) have been shifting call centers and other\nback-office functions to the Philippines. Other European companies like Germany\u2019s global Siemens Corporation, 11.3 The Insular Region (Islands of Southeast Asia) 942\nRoyal Dutch Shell, Swedish Telecom provider Ericsson Telecommunications, and Danish shipping giant Maersk\nare examples of corporations that have established outsourcing centers in the Philippines. The economic savings\ncan be considerable. BPO wages in the Philippines are one-fifth of the wages paid for the same jobs in the United\nStates. Those same wages are double the national average wages for Philippine employees. A rise in the number\nof outsourced jobs is welcome news for the Philippines, whose economy is in need of a boost.\nEast Timor (Timor-Leste)\nTimor is an island of southern Indonesia not far from Australia. The island is divided by its colonial history.\nThe eastern half was a Portuguese colony beginning in the sixteenth century. Portuguese colonizers introduced\nChristianity in the form of Roman Catholicism. The western half was associated with Indonesia, which was a\nDutch colony during the colonial era. The Japanese occupied the Dutch colony during World War II but had\nto give it up after they surrendered in 1945. Indonesia received its independence in 1949 and laid claim to the\nwhole island of Timor. East Timor made a declaration of independence in 1975 but was occupied by Indonesia.\nA bitter civil war erupted. A year later, Indonesia declared it its twenty-seventh province. The civil war resulted\nin the deaths of as many as two hundred fifty thousand people. It wasn\u2019t until 1999 that Indonesia finally ceded\nits political control over East Timor. The Australian military has been instrumental in securing East Timor for\nindependence, and has been serving as a peacekeeping force for internal security for the past decade. The United\nNations (UN) recognized East Timor as a sovereign independent country in 2002. The official name of the country\nis listed as Timor-Leste.\nTimor-Leste has a population of about 1.2 million. About 98 percent of the population is Roman Catholic. The\nonly other predominant Catholic country in Asia is the Philippines. About 90 percent of the population still works\nin agriculture. The country has had a difficult time establishing a stable government and reducing conflict. Almost\nall its infrastructure was damaged in the civil war and rebuilding has been slow. Poor and impoverished due to the\ncivil war over independence, the country does have some opportunity derived from the large natural gas field in\nthe vicinity. East Timor has been working to gain control of its maritime boundaries to benefit from the offshore\nnatural resources. 943 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Malaysia was a former British colony made up of various regions from both the Malay Peninsula and the\nisland of Borneo. Modern Malaysia has diverse cultural dynamics and is modernizing its economy to\ncompete with the core economic areas of the world.\n\u2022 Singapore is an economic tiger that doesn\u2019t have natural resources but makes good use of an excellent\nlocation. High-tech manufacturing has been Singapore\u2019s main method of gaining wealth.\n\u2022 Indonesia is made up of thousands of islands and hundreds of ethnic groups. Indonesia is the fourth-most\npopulous country in the world and has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population. More than half the population\nlives on the island of Java.\n\u2022 The Philippines has more than ninety million people on thousands of islands. The country was colonized by\nSpain and was then a possession of the United States before it gained independence. Roman Catholicism\nand the English language are common in the Philippines, both of which augment a large outsourcing\nindustry.\n\u2022 Brunei is a small Muslim emirate with high incomes because of oil revenues. East Timor is half of a small\nisland north of Australia. It is a former Portuguese colony and just gained its independence in 2002.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Southeast Asia consists of two main geographic regions: the mainland portion that borders China and the\ninsular region that consists of islands or portions of them between Asia and Australia. The large island of\nBorneo is split between the three countries of Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n2. The only region of Southeast Asia that was not colonized by European countries was the Kingdom of Siam,\nwhich is part of the current country of Thailand. This French-colonized region has been often referred to as\nFrench Indochina. Britain, Holland, Portugal, and Spain were also primary colonizers of the realm.\n3. Southeast Asia is diverse in both its human and its physical landscapes. Tropical climates dominate the\nrealm with mountains and coastal areas covering the main land surfaces. This realm has a high rate of\nseismic activity with many active volcanoes and is susceptible to earthquake activity.\n4. All the main world religions can be found here. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country in the\nworld. East Timor and the Philippines are the only two predominantly Christian countries in Asia.\nBuddhism is the dominant religion of the mainland region. Both Malaysia and Singapore have sizeable\nHindu minority groups.\n5. Economic activities vary in Southeast Asia, with Singapore being an economic tiger and Brunei being an\noil-rich emirate. Thailand is becoming a major manufacturing center and the Philippines has been a\ndestination for outsourced information jobs. Landlocked Laos and isolated Burma (Myanmar) have weak\neconomies. Vietnam and Cambodia are recovering from political isolation.\n6. Indonesia has the fourth-largest population in the world. Half of its people live on the island of Java. The\nIndonesian island of Bali has a Hindu majority and is a notable tourist destination. The island of Timor is\ndivided between an Indonesian western half and the independent eastern half of East Timor, which is a\nformer Portuguese colony.\n945 Chapter 12: Australia and New Zealand\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nAustralia and New Zealand have flora and fauna that are found nowhere else on Earth. Australia is distinctive\nbecause it is an island, a country, and a continent\u2014the smallest of the world\u2019s continents. No other land mass can\nconcomitantly make those three claims. Australia consists of a large mainland and the island of Tasmania to the\nsouth. The main physical area of New Zealand, on the other hand, consists of two main islands separated from\nAustralia\u2019s southeastern region by the Tasman Sea. Australia is surrounded by various seas. The Indian Ocean\nsurrounds its western and southern coasts. Indonesia and Papua New Guinea lie to the north, separated by the\nTimor Sea and the Arafura Sea. The Gulf of Carpentaria distinguishes Cape York, which extends north along\nAustralia\u2019s eastern coast almost to Papua New Guinea. The Great Barrier Reef runs for more than 1,600 miles off\nthe continent\u2019s northeastern shores. The Coral Sea separates the Great Barrier Reef from the South Pacific. The\nsouthern side of Australia is the Great Australian Bight and the island of Tasmania. A bight is a large, wide bay.\nTo the south of Australia and New Zealand is Antarctica. The two countries have distinct physical geographies.\nAustralia is relatively flat with low elevation highlands and an extensive dry interior, while New Zealand has high\nmountains and receives adequate rainfall.\nFigure 12.1 Australia and New Zealand\n946 947 World Regional Geography\nThe Tropic of Capricorn runs through the middle of Australia. The Tasman Sea separates Australia from\nNew Zealand.\nMap courtesy of University of Texas Libraries. 12.1 Introducing the Realm\nLearning Objectives\n1. Summarize how colonialism has affected the development and socioeconomic conditions of Australia and\nNew Zealand.\n2. Determine where the Wallace Line and the Weber Line were located. Understand how isolation has allowed\nfor the high level of biodiversity.\n3. Outline how colonialism impacted the Maori and the Aboriginal populations.\nIsolation Geography\nFigure 12.2\n948 949 World Regional Geography\nWallace\u2019s and Weber\u2019s Lines were developed independently to account for the differences in biodiversity between the Austral\nrealm and the Asian realm. Scientists continue to analyze the true boundary between the realms. These lines demarcate a clear\nenvironmental difference in species development between the two sides.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nThe historic isolation of New Zealand and Australia from the rest of the world has caused animals and organisms\nthat are not found anywhere else to develop in these two countries. The unique biodiversity includes marsupials,\nor animals whose young are raised in the mother\u2019s pouch, such as kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and bandicoots.\nIt is believed that these creatures developed separately after the continents broke away from each other more than\ntwo hundred million years ago. Many plant species are also unique to this realm. The biodiversity found here is\nseparate from that of Asia. This has been explained by various biogeographers by drawing imaginary lines just\nnorth of Australia to indicate the line of division between the Asian realm and the Austral realm. Wallace\u2019s Line\nand Weber\u2019s Line are two such examples. Both examples attempt to establish the correct line of demarcation\nfor the differences in species development between the two sides. During the ice ages, sea level was lower, and\nthe many islands of Southeast Asia were connected by land to the mainland. Papua New Guinea was connected\nto Australia. Wallace and Weber believed that no land bridge connected the Asian side with the Austral side for\nanimals to cross over. This separation caused the organisms to the south to develop independently of those in the\nnorth. For example, marsupials are not found on the Asian side of these lines but are found on the Australian side. 12.1 Introducing the Realm 950\nColonialism\nNew Zealand and Australia were both inhabited before the era of European colonialism. Aboriginal people are\nsaid to have migrated to Australia across Southeast Asia from the mainland of Asia more than forty thousand\nyears ago. They made Australia their home and adapted to the physical geography of the continent. For tens\nof thousands of years before the Europeans arrived, the Aborigines carved out an existence in Australia and\ndeveloped their cultural ways. Only about four hundred fifty thousand Aborigines remain in Australia today. New\nZealand was inhabited by the Polynesian group called the Maori who established themselves on the islands in\nthe tenth century. For hundreds of years they, too, established their culture and traditions in the region before the\nEuropeans arrived. The Aborigines in Australia and the Maori in New Zealand were both confronted with the\nEuropean invaders. From their standpoint, there was much to lose by the arrival of the Europeans. Lands were\nlost, new diseases killed many, and control of their methods of livelihood were taken over by Europeans. The\nMaori initiated a number of wars against British colonizers, but in the end the greater military power gained the\nadvantage. At the present time, the Maori make up less than 10 percent of the population of New Zealand.\nThe sighting of Australia by the Dutch dates to 1606. Portuguese explorers may have discovered Australia earlier,\nbut there are no written records. In the early 1700s, the northern and western coastlines of Australia were known\nas \u201cNew Holland.\u201d There were no established colonies. James Cook, a naval officer working for the British navy,\ncommanded the good ship Endeavor and mapped Australia\u2019s eastern coast in 1770. He made port at Botany Bay,\njust south of the current city of Sydney and claimed the region for Britain. He named the land New South Wales.\nThe charting of the coast resulted in continued attention being paid to the region.\nMeanwhile, England had a severe problem with overcrowding of its prisons. Its problem was exacerbated by\nthe loss of Britain\u2019s American colonies. Upon Cook\u2019s return to England, interest was generated in the concept\nof relieving prison overcrowding by sending prisoners to Australia. In 1787, eleven ships with seven hundred\nfifty convicts sailed from Great Britain to Botany Bay. Prison colonies were established in Australia. By the end\nof the seventeenth century, the entire Australian continent was under the British Crown. At the same time that\nthe movement of prisoners from England to Australia was diminishing, the next wave of immigration was being\nfueled by the discovery of gold in the 1850s. The practice of transferring prisoners to Australia ended in 1868. The\narrival of the Europeans had caused a serious demise in the Aboriginal population. Aborigines were completely\ndecimated in Tasmania.\nFigure 12.3 951 World Regional Geography\nGreat Britain colonized Australia by establishing prison colonies. The prison colony of Botany Bay was located near the current city\nof Sydney, Australia.\nIn 1901, the various territories and states of Australia came together under one federation called the\nCommonwealth of Australia. A new federal capital city of Canberra was proposed. By 1927, Canberra was ready\nfor government activity. This commonwealth government still allowed for individual state differences. The British\nmonarch is considered the head of state, though it is mainly a ceremonial position. There have been movements\nwithin Australia in recent years to separate from the British Crown, but they have not been approved. Australia\nhas a democratically elected government.\nBritish naval officer James Cook mapped the coastline of New Zealand in 1769. As the colonial era emerged,\nGreat Britain took possession of New Zealand and included it with its colony of New South Wales. In the 1840s,\nNew Zealand became a separate crown colony. The colony developed a local parliament and a representative\ngovernment. By 1893, New Zealand made headlines as the first country in the world granting all women the right\nto vote. As a part of the British Empire, the country was made a commonwealth nation in 1947 and has been\nfunctioning independently ever since.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Australia is an island continent that was home to aboriginal people who have lived there for tens of\nthousands of years. The British colonized Australia by first creating prison colonies for convicts from Great\nBritain. 12.1 Introducing the Realm 952\n\u2022 New Zealand has two main islands and is home to the Maori, who were originally from Polynesia. The\nBritish colonized New Zealand and often were in conflict with the Maori.\n\u2022 Australia is relatively flat with low elevation highlands and an extensive dry interior, while New Zealand\nhas high mountains and receives adequate rainfall.\n\u2022 The Austral realm was isolated by physical geography. Weber\u2019s Line and the Wallace Line were attempts to\ndistinguish the location of the separation between biological environments.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. For what purpose was Australia first colonized? What European country colonized Australia and New\nZealand?\n2. How did the colonial activity impact the indigenous people?\n3. How is the Austral realm isolated from the rest of the world?\n4. Who are the main indigenous people of New Zealand and where did they originally come from?\n5.

Summarize the colonial exploitation and development of Australia.\n2. Understand the basic characteristics of Australia\u2019s physical geography.\n3. Outline how the core-periphery spatial relationship applies to Australia.\n4. Describe the country\u2019s general cultural attributes.\n5. Summarize the methods used for the country to gain national wealth.\nPhysical Geography\nThere is an international attraction to the island continent of Australia, and the attraction has grown in intensity\nin the past few decades. Tourism is now the number one economic activity in Australia. Just slightly smaller\nin physical area than the continental United States, Australia is a large country with many resources but few\npeople relative to its size. The Tropic of Capricorn runs right through the middle of this country. Australia hosts\nmany unique species of plants and animals, including marsupials and a host of poisonous snakes and insects.\nWith the advent of European colonialism, new species were introduced to the country, which regrettably caused\nthe extinction of some of the native species but also gave Australia a wide diversity of organisms and natural\nconditions.\nAustralia is a relatively low-lying island with low relief. It is the flattest of all the continents. The various highland\nranges are pronounced, but are not high in elevation. The Great Dividing Range is a mountain chain extending\nfrom Melbourne in the south to Cape York in the north. This low-lying range of highlands averages about four\nthousand feet and reaches an elevation of just over seven thousand feet at its highest peaks in the south. The largest\nriver in Australia is the Darling-Murray River system that starts in the highland of the Great Dividing Range\nand flows inward through New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia.\n953 12.2 Australia 954\nThe great interior of the country is home to the massive outback. Extending west from the Great Dividing Range,\nthe outback encompasses most of the interior. This region receives less rainfall than along the coast and its terrain\nconsists of deserts and semiarid plateaus with rough grasses and scrublands. The outback is sparsely populated,\nbut is home to a number of aboriginal groups. Many of the school-age children in the outback have traditionally\nreceived their school lessons through television or radio broadcasts because of their isolation. Mining and some\nagricultural activities can be found in the outback. Alice Springs is located in the center of the continent and has\nbeen given the designation of the middle of nowhere, or the center of everything.\nFigure 12.4 The Ghan (Train) Waiting at Alice Springs Station before Continuing North to Darwin\nThe remote town of Alice Springs is located at the center of the Australian outback.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe deserts of Australia\u2019s interior make up a large portion of the continent. Western Australia has three large\ndeserts: the Gibson Desert, Great Victoria Desert, and Great Sandy Desert. The Simpson Desert is located in 955 World Regional Geography\nthe border region between the Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. These deserts are not all sand;\ncourse grasses and various species of spinifex, a short plant that grows in sandy soil, also grow in the deserts. The\nGreat Artesian Basin on the western edge of the Great Dividing Range receives very little rainfall. It would be\nclassified as a desert but for its underground water resources, which support extensive farming operations. Large\nlivestock businesses exist in Australia\u2019s interior with massive herds of cattle and sheep. The grassy plateaus and\nscrublands provide grazing for domesticated livestock and even wild camels.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the largest barrier reef in the world, extends for 1,600 miles off the northeastern coast of\nAustralia. It is home to a host of sea creatures and fish that draw millions of tourists each year. The reef attracts\nscuba divers and water enthusiasts from around the world. The reef is a main tourism attraction and brings income\nto the Australian economy. The Great Barrier Reef has been designated as a United Nations World Heritage Site.\nBrisbane is located on the Gold Coast, which gets its name from the beautiful sandy beaches. The beaches attract\nan important tourism market for the country.\nFigure 12.5 Aerial view of Uluru (Ayers Rock), Located in the Interior of Australia near Alice Springs\nThe rock rises 1,142 feet above the outback and is 2.2 miles long. The site is sacred to the Aborigines and is a major tourist attraction.\nIt is listed as a World Heritage Site.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nA couple of large physical features of interest and significance to Australia are the two largest monoliths in the\nworld. In western Australia, more than five hundred miles to the northeast of Perth, is Mt. Augustus National Park, 12.2 Australia 956\nwhich features the rock known as Mt. Augustus. It is considered to be the largest single rock in the world. Mt.\nAugustus rises 2,352 feet above the desert landscape. The single structure is about five miles long. Mt. Augustus\nis more than twice the size of the most famous Australian monolith of Uluru (Ayers Rock). Uluru is located about\ntwo hundred miles southwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory and is a well-known tourist attraction.\nUluru rises 1,142 feet above the outback and is about 2.2 miles long. Both rocks hold significant cultural value to\nthe aboriginal populations in Australia. They both have ancient petroglyphs, and both are considered sacred sites.\nUluru has been more popularized through tourism promotions.\nClimate Regions\nCentral and western Australia are sparsely populated. Large areas of the Northern Territory and the desert regions\nare uninhabited. Approximately 40 percent of Australia\u2019s interior is desert, where Type B climates dominate. The\nlarge land mass can heat up during the summer months, triggering high temperatures. Low humidity allows heat\nto escape into the atmosphere after the sun goes down, so there is wide temperature variation between day and\nnight.\nAlong the northern coastal region there are more tropical Type A climates. Closer to the equator and with the\nsea to moderate temperatures, the northern areas around Darwin and Cape York have little temperature variation.\nTemperatures in Darwin average about 90 \u00b0F in the summer and 86 \u00b0F in the winter. Spring monsoons bring\nadditional rainfall from February to March.\nTasmania, Victoria, and the core region of the southeast have a more moderate and temperate Type C climate.\nThe main cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, are within this area. It is not surprising that there is a\ndirect correlation between Type C climates and the major population areas. The Tropic of Capricorn cuts across\nthe continent, indicating that the cities are not that far south of the tropics. Average winter temperatures in June\nand July do not usually fall below 50 \u00b0F and average summer temperatures in January and February remain around\n70 \u00b0F. Since the seasons are reversed from that of the Northern Hemisphere, many Australians go to the beach for\nChristmas. 957 World Regional Geography\nFigure 12.6 Australia\u2019s Provinces and Territories and Their Respective Major Cities\nThe two core areas, where most of Australia\u2019s population resides, are also noted. Not unexpectedly, the core areas have a dominant\ntype C climate, following the general principle that humans gravitate toward type C climates.\nUpdated map from Wikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nPopulation, Urbanization, and the Core-Periphery Spatial\nRelationship\nAustralia is divided politically into six states and two territories. They are the Northern Territory, Australian 12.2 Australia 958\nCapital Territory, Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales. Australian\nprotectorates are composed of a number of small islands around Australia. Australian core areas are conducive\nto large human populations. To locate the core population areas in Australia, simply find the moderate Type C\nclimates. Australia has two core regions. There is a small core region in the west, anchored by the city of Perth.\nMost of Australia\u2019s people live in the large core region in the east along the coast. This region extends from\nBrisbane to Adelaide and holds most of the country\u2019s population.\nThe total population of Australia in 2010 was only about twenty-two million. There are more people living in\nMexico City than in all of Australia. More than 90 percent of this population has European heritage; most of this\npercentage is from the British Isles. English is the dominant language. Christianity is the dominant religion of\nchoice. The makeup of the people is a product of European colonialism and immigration.\nOnly about 2 percent of the current population consists of Aboriginal people, the original people of Australia.\nAustralia\u2019s population has seen periodic growth spurts as waves of immigrants responded to national policies\nencouraging immigration. This was especially true after World War II. About 24 percent of the current population\nwas born outside Australia; most come from the United Kingdom, and another large percentage comes from\nNew Zealand. Asian countries have also contributed to the Australian population, with measurable numbers of\nimmigrants from China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. And lastly, people from Italy and India also make up a\nnotable proportion of Australia\u2019s immigrant population.\nAustralia\u2019s population is not spread evenly across the landscape, since a large portion of the country is desert.\nThe population is concentrated mostly in the urban areas. About 90 percent of the population inhabits the cities,\nwhich are mostly in coastal areas. The largest city, Sydney, is often referred to as the New York of Australia.\nSydney is positioned at the heart of the main core area, the state of New South Wales. To the south of Sydney\nis the Australian Capital Territory, home to the capital city of Canberra. Other major Australian cities include\nMelbourne, Perth, Adelaide, and Brisbane. Hobart is the largest city on the island of Tasmania and Darwin is the\nlargest city in the Northern Territory.\nFigure 12.7 The Sydney Opera House Viewed from the Water with the City Skyline 959 World Regional Geography\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.5.\nAll the large cities of Australia\u2014with except the planned capital city of Canberra\u2014are located on the coast. This\npattern of urban distribution was a product of European colonial development. Most of Australia\u2019s population\nlives in the two economic core regions, so Australia exhibits a distinct core-periphery spatial pattern. The core\nareas hold the power, wealth, and influence while the periphery region supplies all the food, raw materials, and\ngoods needed in the core. Australia has never had a majority rural population since its Aboriginal times. There\nhas been little rural-to-urban shift in Australia\u2019s population. This is similar to Japan\u2019s urban development pattern.\nEnglish is the first language of the vast majority of the population. Recently enacted policies and changing\nattitudes toward multiculturalism have spurred growth in the number of immigrants and their descendants who\nspeak two languages fluently\u2014English and the language of their birthplace or national heritage. Indigenous\nlanguages have not fared so well. As many as three hundred indigenous languages were spoken by Aborigines\nbefore the Europeans arrived, and just a few hundred years later, that number now stands at about seventy. Most\naboriginal languages are in danger of dying out. 12.2 Australia 960\nCulture and Immigration\nUntil 1973, Australia had a collection of laws and policies known as the White Australia policy, which served to\nlimit the immigration of nonwhite persons to Australia. While the White Australia policies limited immigration\nfrom some areas, other policies sought to expand immigration from the United Kingdom. Subsidies were offered\nto British citizens to relocate to Australia. Between 1830 and 1940, more than a million British citizens took\nadvantage of the offer.\nRecent census data indicate that about a quarter of the population identifies itself as Roman Catholic and another\n20 percent self-identifies as Anglican (the national religion of the United Kingdom). An additional 20 percent self-\nidentify as Protestant, other than Anglican, and about 15 percent as having no religion. Regular church attendance\nis claimed by at about 7.5 percent of the population. Despite modern Australia having been settled by the British,\nAustralian law decrees that Australia will have no national religion and guarantees freedom of religion.\nSports are an important part of Australian culture, perhaps owing to a climate that allows for year-round outdoor\nactivity. About a fourth of the population is involved in some kind of organized sports team. Football (soccer)\nis popular, as is true in most European countries, and rugby and cricket are popular as well. The most popular\nspectator sport in Australia is Australian Rules Football, also known as Aussie Rules Football, or simply \u201cfooty.\u201d\nThis uniquely Australian game has codified rules that date back to 1858 and is a variant of football and rugby.\nOther forms of entertainment include television, film, and live performances of every kind. Although Australia\nhas a number of its own television stations, there are concerns that popular culture is beginning to be dominated\nby American influences. Australia\u2019s large cities have extensive programs in the arts. Sydney is becoming a center\nfor world-class performances in dance, opera, music, and theatre.\nEducation is well funded and internationally respected. School attendance is compulsory between the ages of six\nand fifteen, and the adult literacy rate has held steady at about 99 percent. Most students attend publicly funded\nschools, which are secular. Private schools, which charge tuition fees, do exist and are typically run by religious\norganizations, predominantly the Catholic Church.\nEconomic Geography\nMost of Australia\u2014especially the wide expanse of the arid interior known as the outback\u2014has immense open\nspaces, agricultural potential or excellent resource extraction possibilities. The extensive grasslands support tens 961 World Regional Geography\nof millions of domesticated animals\u2014mainly cattle and sheep\u2014which accounts for up to one-fifth of the world\u2019s\nwool production. Large agricultural businesses include thousands of acres under one operation. The western sector\nof the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales is an excellent region for commercial grain operations. The\ncoastal region in Queensland, since it is warmer and receives more rainfall, is good for sugarcane and similar\ncrops. Sheep and cattle ranches are common in central Queensland and Western Australia. Various regions of\nsouthern Australia are excellent for grape and fruit production. Australian wine production has risen to compete\nwith the US and European markets. Only the dry central desert regions in the center of the continent are not\nfavorable for agriculture. In the early portion of the twentieth century, Australia gained enormous wealth by\nexporting food products to the rest of the world. This is still true, but the profit margin on food goods is no longer\nwhat it used to be. The country has had to look elsewhere to gain wealth.\nFigure 12.8\nThe agricultural region of the Barossa Valley in South Australia grows grapes and produces wine. Agricultural production is a 12.2 Australia 962\nmajor source of economic wealth for Australia even though only 11 percent of the population lives in rural areas. Australia\u2019s wine\nproduction is expanding to compete in the global marketplace, with France and California as major competitors.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nAustralia has excellent food production capabilities. It also has an excellent mineral resource base. Different types\nof minerals can be found in different regions throughout Australia. Western Australia has iron ore mines. The\neastern region of Queensland and New South Wales has abundant coal reserves. Minerals such as zinc, copper,\ngold, silver, tungsten, and nickel can be found in various parts of the country, including Tasmania. Oil and gas\nfields can be found in the northwestern coastal waters and in the Tasman Sea east of Melbourne. The country is\nself-sufficient in natural gas but does have to import some petroleum products.\nFigure 12.9 Australia\u2019s Distribution of Raw Materials 963 World Regional Geography\nUpdated from map courtesy of Wikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY-SA 3.0.\nAre any Australian-manufactured products available where you live? What products can you think of? Australia\ndoes not export many manufactured goods. Its main exports are food and raw materials. If you remember how\ncountries gain wealth, the method with the highest valued-added profit is manufacturing. Think about Japan\nand the four Asian economic tigers, and how they have gained their wealth. The economic tigers have few raw\nmaterials. Where do you suppose the economic tigers and Japan get their raw materials? With Japan\u2019s enormous\nmanufacturing capacity, it has a high demand for imported iron ore, minerals, and raw materials. Though Australia\nis a former British colony, Great Britain is not considered Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. Australia is closer\ngeographically to the Asian economic community than to the European Union. Japan has become Australia\u2019s\nbiggest trading partner. When Australia is viewed in the news, in television programs, and in Hollywood movies,\nit is portrayed as a country with a similar standard of living to the United States or Europe. How do Australians\nhave such a high standard of living if they don\u2019t manufacture anything for export? To evaluate this, think about\nthe size of the population of Australia and consider the distribution of wealth. They export an immense amount of\nraw materials and have a relatively small population to share the wealth. 12.2 Australia 964\nFigure 12.10 Bondi Beach\nThe Gold Coast of eastern Australia draws tourists from the Northern Hemisphere throughout the winter season. It is called the Gold\nCoast because of the long stretches of golden sand beaches, the golden tanned bodies of beach goers, and the high level of income\n(gold) derived from the tourism industry.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nAustralia is an attractive place to visit. The environment, the animals, and the culture make it inviting for tourism.\nAs of the year 2002, tourism has become Australia\u2019s number one means of economic income. From the Great\nBarrier Reef and the Gold Coast to the vast expanse of the outback, Australia has been marketing itself as an\nattractive place to visit with great success. Tourism from Japan provides a large percentage of the tourist activity.\nAustralia has moved through the initial stages of the index of economic development to become a society that is\nabout 90 percent urban with small families and high incomes. 965 World Regional Geography\nMining and Aboriginal Lands\nTerritorial control of Australian lands has become a major issue in recent years. Large portions of western\nAustralia and the outback have traditionally been Aboriginal lands. European colonialism on the Australian\ncontinent displaced many of the native people. Large sections of land once used by the Aborigines were taken\nover by the government or by private interests. Large agricultural operations and mining operations have used the\nlands without adequate compensation to the Aboriginal people who once controlled them. Court rulings aimed at\nreparation for native people have had mixed results.\nThere are as many as four hundred different groups of Aborigines currently in Australia that make up a total\npopulation of about four hundred fifty thousand. This is a small percentage of Australia\u2019s population but involves\na large part of the physical area of the country. Their land claims include all of the Northern Territory, a large\nportion of western Australia, and parts of South Australia and Queensland. This is in addition to claims located\nwithin many urban areas, such as the largest city, Sydney. Mining operations on Aboriginal lands have become\nhighly regulated. Concerns have arisen that Australia\u2019s extractive industries will diminish, causing a decline in the\neconomy. The concern for the Aboriginal population has increased in the past few decades and the government\nhas made attempts to mediate their political and economic issues as well as strengthen programs that address their\nsocial welfare.\nAustralia\u2019s Future\nThe economic future of Australia is complex. Though tourism has become a viable means of providing income,\nAustralia must import manufactured products that it does not produce locally, including electronic goods,\ncomputers, and automobiles. Import dependence has increased its trade deficit. Trade agreements and\nprotectionism have become a part of the economic puzzle of how to sustain a competitive standard of living.\nAustralia is located next to the Asian realm. Its economy, culture, and future are becoming more Asian.\nImmigration has been an issue in that the government has always restricted immigration to ensure a European\nmajority. Millions of Asian people would like to migrate to Australia to seek greater opportunities and advantages,\nbut they are legally restricted. It is becoming more difficult for Australians to hold to their European connections\nwith such an Asian presence. How the country will handle this situation in the future will prove interesting. 12.2 Australia 966\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Australia is an island continent that was home to aboriginal people before the British colonized it by first\ncreating prison colonies for convicts from Great Britain.\n\u2022 Australia is a relatively flat continent with low elevation highlands, including the Great Dividing Range\nalong its eastern coast. The interior outback lacks precipitation and has numerous deserts.\n\u2022 Two main core areas exist where Type C climates prevail and where most of the population lives: a large\ncore area on the southeastern coast and a small core area around Perth on the western coast. The sparsely\npopulated outback makes up the vast periphery, which has large amounts of mineral and agricultural\nresources.\n\u2022 Aboriginal people were in Australia for forty thousand years. The British colonial activity didn\u2019t heat up\nuntil the late 1700s. Today, most of the twenty-two million people are from the British Isles and Europe.\nOnly about four hundred fifty thousand Aborigines remain.\n\u2022 Australia has few manufacturing enterprises for export profits. Tourism has become the number one method\nof gaining wealth, with the export of raw materials the second-largest method.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

New Zealand is one of a number\nof sets of islands that make up Oceania, also referred to as the Pacific Islands, a region occupying the western\nand central Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Islands region is generally divided into three subregions: Micronesia,\nMelanesia, and Polynesia, with New Zealand being part of Polynesia. The Pacific Island region includes more\nthan twenty-five thousand individual small islands representing twenty-five nations and territories. Most of these\nislands are very small. The South and North islands of New Zealand are the second- and third-largest islands,\nrespectively. The North and South Islands of New Zealand are separated by a body of water known as the Cook\nStraight, which is only about thirteen miles wide at its narrowest point. The North and South Islands together are\nabout the same size as the US state of Colorado. New Zealand also includes a number of smaller nearby islands.\nNew Zealand, like Australia, is in the Southern Hemisphere, which means that its seasons are expressed at the\nopposite times of the seasons in North America. In other words, the warmest summer months are January and\nFebruary and the cooler winter months are June and July. New Zealand lies within the Temperate Zone. There\nare only very moderate seasonal differences, which are slightly more pronounced in the inland areas because\nthe inland areas lack the moderating influence of the ocean. In general, the North Island has somewhat warmer\naverage temperatures than the South Island. In summer, average low temperatures are about 50 \u00b0F, with daytime\nhighs around 75 \u00b0F. In the winter months, low temperatures average about 35 \u00b0F and high temperatures are about\n50 \u00b0F. The occurrence of more extreme temperatures is limited to the mountainous peaks of the Southern Alps.\nSnow is common in these mountainous regions but rarely occurs in coastal regions.\nFigure 12.12 New Zealand 971 World Regional Geography\nWellington is the capital, Auckland is the largest city in the country, and Christchurch is the largest city on\nthe South Island. The Southern Alps extend along the western length of the south and reach elevations of\ntwelve thousand feet.\nCIA World Factbook \u2013 public domain.\nRainfall is heaviest on the western coasts of both islands, but especially on the South Island. The prevailing\nwesterly winds, carrying moisture from the ocean, come in contact with the mountains of the Southern Alps and\nhigh precipitation results. The mountains also have the opposite effect. On the eastern side of the mountains is\na rain shadow where the westerly winds blow hot, dry air and the eastern coasts are therefore substantially drier\nthan the western coasts. Therefore, average precipitation rates vary widely across the country. The average annual\nrainfall in Christchurch, which is on the eastern coast of the South Island, is about twenty-five inches per year.\nAuckland, in the midportion of the North Island, receives twice that amount and areas on the wetter western coast\nreceive as much as one hundred fifteen inches per year.\nAs an island nation, New Zealand\u2019s coastlines and oceans are some of its most important geographic features.\nNew Zealand has one of the world\u2019s largest exclusive economic zones, an oceanic zone over which a nation has 12.3 New Zealand 972\nexclusive rights of exploration and exploitation of marine resources. New Zealand\u2019s exclusive economic zone\ncovers more than one million square miles. The dramatic nature of New Zealand\u2019s landscape is well known to\nmany moviegoers as the landscape of Middle Earth, as depicted in New Zealand film director Peter Jackson\u2019s\nversion of J. R. R. Tolkein\u2019s Lord of the Rings.\nTectonic Plates and Gondwanaland\nThe North Island of New Zealand features a rather rugged coastline with numerous harbors, bays, and inlets.\nThe port cities of Auckland and Wellington are located on two of the largest bays. The coastline of the South\nIsland is somewhat more regular, except along the southern portion of the eastern coastline, which has deep fjords.\nThough the North Island has lower relief than its southern counterpart, its few mountains are volcanic in origin.\nThe two main islands are accompanied by smaller islands around their shores. The North Island\u2019s highest peak is\nMt. Ruapehu, which reaches almost 9,175 feet and is an active cone volcano. It is located in the south central\npart of the island. A range of highlands runs along its eastern side. The volcanism associated with Mt. Ruapehu\nresults from New Zealand\u2019s location atop two tectonic plates: the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate.\nThe boundary of these two plates forms a subduction zone under the North Island; consequently, New Zealand\nexperiences tens of thousands of earthquakes per year. Though most of the earthquakes do not greatly disrupt\nhuman activity, some have registered higher than 7 on the Richter scale. New Zealanders have made use of the\ngeothermal power generated by this and the tectonic features of this area and hence, New Zealand is home to\nseveral hydrothermal power plants.\nA range of mountains, the Southern Alps, divides the South Island lengthwise. Many of the peaks reach over ten\nthousand feet. The highest peak is Mt. Cook, which reaches higher than twelve thousand feet. These mountains\nare also formed by the area\u2019s tectonic situation. However, the two plates meet in a different way under the South\nIsland. Rather than creating a subduction zone, the plates move laterally. The lateral movement created the South\nAlps. New Zealand\u2019s location places it along one of the edges of the so-called Ring of Fire, which encircles\nthe Pacific Ocean basin. The positions and activity of the tectonic plates in this zone cause most of the world\u2019s\nearthquakes and have formed more than 75 percent of the world\u2019s volcanoes. 973 World Regional Geography\nFigure 12.13 The Supercontinent of Pangaea about Two Hundred Million Years Ago\nThe southern portion was called Gondwana (Gondwanaland). New Zealand and Australia come from Gondwana; their origin\nexplains why their fauna and flora are so unique.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0.\nNew Zealand has a fascinating ecological history. New Zealand was once part of Gondwana, also known as\nGondwanaland. About two hundred to five hundred million years ago, Gondwana was the southern portion\nof the supercontinent of Pangaea. Gondwana included most of the land in what is the Southern Hemisphere\ntoday, including Australia and New Zealand. Over time, through various forms of tectonic activity, the earth\u2019s\nplates shifted and the supercontinent of Gondwana broke apart, leaving New Zealand geographically isolated for\nmillennia. The species of flora and fauna found in New Zealand either descended from the species found on\nGondwana, flew there, floated there via the ocean, or were brought by people. 12.3 New Zealand 974\nBiodiversity in New Zealand\nNew Zealand\u2019s geological history has laid the groundwork for more than 2,000 indigenous plant species, about\n1,500 of which are found nowhere else in the world. The biomes of the North Island include a subtropical\narea, including mangrove swamps, an evergreen forest with dense undergrowth of mosses and ferns, and a small\ngrasslands area in the central volcanic plain. The South Island biomes include extensive grasslands in the east,\nwhich are excellent for agricultural pursuits; forest areas, dominated by native beech trees in the west; and an\nalpine vegetation zone in the Southern Alps.\nIn terms of fauna, the most influential factor may be the relative absence of predatory mammals, again related to\nNew Zealand\u2019s geological history. With few ground predators and a favorable climate, bats, small reptiles, and\nbirds were able to thrive and flourish. Without predators, many species of birds became flightless, such as the\nnoted Kiwi. New Zealand\u2019s most famous bird, the moa, was similar to the ostrich but is now extinct. Moa could\ngrow to more than twelve feet high and weigh more than five hundred pounds. New Zealand is known for its\nlarge number of species of wild birds. The Kiwi is the most noted and is often used to refer to people from New\nZealand, as it is the national symbol of the country.\nFigure 12.14 975 World Regional Geography\nThe flightless Kiwi bird is the national symbol of New Zealand. All five species of Kiwi are endangered.\nSportler \u2013 kiwi \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nNew Zealand has a variety of landscapes that have been attractive for economic activity and tourism. The South\nIsland is larger than the North Island and is more mountainous. The snowcapped peaks of the Southern Alps run\nthe western length of the South Island. Large livestock-raising operations and agricultural activities can be found\non the vast grasslands of the South Island. Millions of sheep and cattle are raised on the grassy highlands and the\nvalley pasturelands. The North Island has more low-lying terrain, which is also good for agriculture and is home\nto a large dairy industry. The central highlands of the north offer some rugged relief and provide for a diverse\nphysical landscape. 12.3 New Zealand 976\nCultural Dynamics and the Maori\nNew Zealand is home to many Polynesian groups. Its original inhabitants were the Maori, who came to the islands\naround the tenth century. They grew crops of gourds and sweet potatoes. Fur seals were hunted regularly, as were\nmoa, which were hunted to extinction before the Europeans arrived. The Maori had created extensive trading\nnetworks with other island groups and developed a heritage of traditional rituals and cultural ways. The Maori\nculture thrived for hundreds of years and was well established in New Zealand before the arrival of the colonial\nships from Europe.\nBritain was the main colonizer of the islands. The British settled in to establish their presence and gain control.\nIn 1840, the British colonizers and the Maori signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which granted British sovereignty\nover the islands but allowed the Maori certain rights over tribal lands. The actual language in this treaty has been\ndebated between the English version and the Maori version. Over time the tribal lands were codified into legal\narrangements by the European colonizers. Since the Treaty of Waitangi, the situation has evolved, with subsequent\nland exchanges, some legal and others questionable. The Maori have complained about unfair treatment and the\nloss of land and rights in the process. These issues have finally reached a point of negotiation in the past couple\nof decades. Starting in the 1990s, treaty settlements have been made to help correct the actions of the colonial\nactivity and compensate the Maori for the conditions they were subjugated to.\nFigure 12.15 A Maori Man with Traditional Topknot and Tattoos 977 World Regional Geography\nMany Maori participate in performances in New Zealand both for tourism and to maintain their heritage and traditions.\nSteve Evans \u2013 New Zealand: Maori Culture 002 \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\nMost of the Maori have lived on the North Island. They were a real concern for the European colonizers. Claimed\nby Great Britain in their colonial empire, the country of New Zealand became independent of Britain in 1901. In\n2010, the estimate of the population of the country was at about 4.3 million, with Europeans making up 60 percent\nof the population and the Maori making up about 8 percent. There are also many people who are of mixed ethnic\nbackground, including Maori and other groups. Asians, Polynesians, and other ethnic minorities make up the rest.\nNew Zealand\u2019s main religion is Christianity and English is the official language.\nThe Maori have not been integrated into New Zealand society to the same extent as Europeans have. The Maori\nnow join the ranks of other Pacific Islanders that have moved to New Zealand from Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands,\nand many other places in the South Pacific. New Zealand\u2019s urban areas reflect diversity in the various cultural\nlandscapes and ethnic communities that have established themselves in specific neighborhoods within the main\ncities. A common dilemma with all peoples is the draw to return to their heritage and roots, which typically results\nin a more traditional lifestyle with stronger cultural ways. At the same time, the modern world pulls people toward\na more global and cosmopolitan culture that is steeped in modernity with changing fashions. The Maori and other\nethnic groups in New Zealand find themselves facing this dichotomy of societal dynamics. 12.3 New Zealand 978\nEconomic Conditions\nLand and climate could be said to be New Zealand\u2019s most important natural resources. Fertile soils and a mild\nclimate, complete with thousands of hours of sunshine annually, create ideal conditions for agriculture. Grass\ncontinues to grow throughout the year, which means that sheep and other livestock can be well grazed. Wool and\nother agricultural products, notably meat and butter, are important exports for New Zealand\u2019s economy. Healthy\nforests produce timber products, which are important to the economy as well. Some of New Zealand\u2019s natural\nresources are found underground, including coal, natural gas, gold, and other minerals.\nWellington is the capital of the country and is located on the southern end of the North Island. Wellington is one-\nfourth the size of the primary city, Auckland, which has 1.2 million people and is located in the north. The major\ncities are located along the coastal regions and provide a connection to sea transportation. Christchurch is the\nlargest city of the South Island and is located along the eastern seaboard on the productive Canterbury Plain. The\nsoils and conditions on the Canterbury Plain are excellent for productive agriculture of all types. Coastal plains\nalso provide access to building transportation systems of highways and railroads that are more costly to construct\nin the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps or the northern highlands.\nFigure 12.16 Harvesting Grapes in Marlborough District, New Zealand 979 World Regional Geography\nThis is at the north end of the South Island across the Cook Strait from Wellington. Agricultural products make up a large portion of\nthe nation\u2019s exports that contribute to the country\u2019s economy.\nPhil Norton \u2013 Harvester \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\nThe modern cities are home to a multitude of processing centers preparing the abundant agricultural products for\ndomestic consumption and for export products. The ever-growing populations of Asia and the rest of the world\ncontinue to place a high demand on food products and welcome New Zealand\u2019s agricultural exports. In relation\nto how countries gain wealth, agricultural profits are usually quite competitive and normally provide a low profit\nmargin. New Zealand does not gain a large part of its national income from mining or manufacturing, though\nthese industries do exist. The high standard of living that exists in New Zealand is similar to that of Australia in\nthat the population is not very large, so that the national wealth can be distributed via the private sector economy\nto accommodate a relatively good lifestyle and provide for a comfortable standard of living.\nNew Zealand has a market economy. The mainstay of the economy is, and has been for many years, a productive\nagricultural sector that has been geared toward export profits. New Zealand\u2019s climate and soils help give it a\nplace in the economy of the region through agricultural exports. A \u201cwool boom\u201d in the 1950s furthered the\nemphasis on agricultural products as tremendous profits accrued in the wool production and export industry.\nToday, New Zealand\u2019s economy is still heavily focused on the export of agricultural products, though the economy\nhas diversified into other areas such as tourism and exploitation of natural resources, especially natural gas. The\ndevelopment of hydroelectricity generation in recent years has been important to the economy.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 New Zealand has been isolated by the separation of continents through tectonic plate action. Shifting plates\ncontinue to create earthquakes and volcanic activity in the region. 12.3 New Zealand 980\n\u2022 New Zealand has high mountains, with the Southern Alps along the western coast of the South Island and\nhighlands along the eastern side of the North Island. Adequate rainfall and good soils provide for excellent\nagricultural production, which has been the traditional economic activity.\n\u2022 The Maori were established in New Zealand before the British colonized it. Various agreements were made\nto work out common arrangements, with varying degrees of success. The Maori continue to be a minority\npopulation and have not acculturated into the mainstream society of the country.\n\u2022 New Zealand has historically relied on agricultural exports for national income. Shifting global markets and\nchanges in government policies and structures have highly affected the economy of New Zealand. The\ncountry continues to work its way through the transition to a more global economy.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

Australia is an independent country and a relatively low-elevation island continent that is distinguished by\nits large semiarid interior region called the outback. Two core areas with moderate Type C climates along\nthe eastern and western coasts hold most of the modest population of about twenty-two million.\n2. Great Britain colonized Australia and first used it as a prison colony. European traditions and heritage\nprevail, with English as the main language and Christianity as the main religion. The Aborigines had been\nthere for tens of thousands of years before the Europeans arrived but only about four hundred fifty thousand\nremain.\n3. The traditional method of gaining wealth in Australia has been through agricultural production. In the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century, the export of minerals and raw materials became a major method of gaining\nwealth. In the past decade, tourism has risen to Australia\u2019s number one means of gaining wealth. Physical\nfeatures such as the Great Barrier Reef, the outback, and the many unique animals make Australia a\ndestination for world travelers.\n4. New Zealand is about 1,500 miles to the east of Australia across the Tasman Sea. The two main islands of\nNew Zealand have high relief, with the Southern Alps located on the South Island. Moderate climate\nconditions and adequate rainfall make New Zealand an appealing place for agriculture and tourism. The\nremote locations create an element of isolation that is a cost consideration for travel and trade.\n5. The Maori people from Polynesia inhabited New Zealand before the British colonized it. The Maori had\nconflicts with the British and, later, the government over the loss of lands and legal arrangements. The\nMaori make up less than 10 percent of the 4.3 million people in New Zealand. The Maori situation has\ncommon ground with the situation with the Aborigines in Australia, who also have been working to regain\nland rights and legal settlements.\n6. New Zealand\u2019s economic situation has evolved to accommodate international market prices and demands as\nwell as the internal business and political climate of the country. The main economic activity has been\nagricultural exports, but the country has been diversifying into industrial processes and tourism. Natural gas\ndevelopment has also been expanding.\n981 Chapter 13: The Pacific and Antarctica\nIdentifying the Boundaries\nThe immense tropical Pacific realm and the ice-covered continent of Antarctica have almost opposing physical\ncharacteristics, but they are similar in that they are remote and isolated from the rest of the world. Understanding\nthe geographic qualities of these two realms will help in comprehending the unique traits that humans have\ndeveloped to survive in diverse environments. Both places include large physical areas with vast open spaces\nbetween human settlements. In the Pacific, human settlements are on islands. The only human settlements in\nAntarctica are isolated research stations. Historically, the South Pacific required a water-based transportation\nnetwork, and in Antarctica, humans traveled across the snow and ice exploring the earth\u2019s southern extremes. Air\ntravel is now available to connect both places with the rest of the world.\nAlmost all of Antarctica rests south of the Antarctic Circle. Antarctica is a continent surrounded by the Southern\nOcean. The next nearest continent is South America. Many countries have laid claim to sections of Antarctica, but\nthe continent remains off limits to industrial development and many other activities. The hundreds of islands of\nthe South Pacific are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and make up the largest geographic area in the world. The\nprimary realm includes the island groups in the tropics between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.\nThere has been little industrial development in the South Pacific. Just as Antarctica has been divided up and\nclaimed by other countries, though it was not colonized by them, most of the islands in the South Pacific were\nclaimed or colonized by the imperial powers of Europe, Japan, or the United States. Both areas are considered\nto be peripheral realms in the overall scheme of the global economy. Tourism is the major activity in the South\nPacific, and research and tourism are the major activities in Antarctica. Both areas have opportunities for greater\neconomic development in the future. However, the difference is that Antarctica is not a country, and any benefit\nwill go to the countries with claims on the continent or to the businesses taking tourists there.\nBoth the Pacific realm and Antarctica would be heavily impacted by increased climate change. Rising\ntemperatures would continue to melt the ice in the polar caps, which in turn could raise sea levels. Changes\nin precipitation patterns could seriously alter the biodiversity of tropical islands in the Pacific, and changes in\ntemperatures or precipitation could affect agricultural activity and tourism on many islands. Climate change in\nAntarctica could cause a further decline in the populations of penguins or other organisms.\n982 983 World Regional Geography\nFigure 13.1 The Tropical Realm of the South Pacific with the\nThree Main Regions of Islands 13.1 The Pacific Islands\nLearning Objectives\n1. Outline the three main areas of the South Pacific: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.\n2. Distinguish between low islands and high islands.\n3. Determine which islands remain under the auspices of France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or the\nUnited States.\n4. Describe the primary economic activities of the islands in the realm.\n5. Summarize the main environmental concerns of the islands in each region.\nIntroducing the Realm\nThe Pacific realm is home to many islands and island groups. The largest island is New Guinea, which is home\nto most of the realm\u2019s population. Many of the Pacific islands have become independent countries, while others\nremain under the auspices of their colonial controllers. The Pacific Theater of World War II was a battleground\nbetween the Japanese and American forces and had a large impact on the current conditions of many of the islands.\nThe United States has been a major player in the post\u2013World War II domination and control of various island\ngroups. The Hawaiian Islands became the fiftieth US state in 1959.\nThe many islands can be divided into three main groups based on physical geography, local inhabitants, and\nlocation: Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Indigenous cultural heritage remains strong in the South Pacific,\nbut Western culture has made deep inroads into people\u2019s lives. The globalization process bears heavily on the\neconomic conditions that influence the cultural dynamics of the Pacific. Islands or island groups that remain under\noutside political jurisdiction are the most influenced by European or American cultural forces. Western trends in\nfast food, pop music, clothing styles, and social customs often dominate television, radio, and the cinema. Invasive\n984 985 World Regional Geography\nWestern cultural forces take the focus away from the traditional indigenous culture and heritage of the people who\ninhabited these isolated islands for centuries.\nTraditionally, the islands were economically self-sufficient. Fishing and growing crops were the main economic\nactivities, and nearby islands often established trade and exchanged natural resources. Fishing has been one of the\nmost common ways of supporting the economy. There have been changes in the national boundaries to protect\noffshore fishing rights around each sovereign entity. Many waters have been overfished, consequently reducing\nthe islands\u2019 ability to provide food for their people or to gain national wealth. An increase in population and\nthe introduction of modern technologies has brought about a dependency on the world\u2019s core areas for economic\nsupport.\nThe Pacific is an extreme peripheral realm with little to offer to the core areas for economic exploitation. In recent\ndecades, some national wealth has been gained from the mining of substances such as phosphates on a few of\nthe islands. The main resources available are a pleasant climate, beautiful beaches, and tropical island terrain, all\nof which can be attractive to tourists and people from other places. Tourism is a growing sector of the service\nindustry and a major means of gaining wealth for various island groups. To attract tourism, the islands must invest\nin the necessary infrastructure, such as airports, hotels, and supporting services. Long distances between islands\nand remote locations make tourism transportation expensive. Not every island has the funding to support these\nexpenditures to draw tourists to their location.\nMelanesia\nThe region of the Pacific north of Australia that borders Indonesia to the east is called Melanesia. The name\noriginally referred to people with darker skin but does not adequately describe the region\u2019s current ethnic diversity.\nThe main island groups include Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea.\nAll are independent countries except New Caledonia, which is under the French government. The island of New\nGuinea is shared between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Many islands on the eastern side of Indonesia share\nsimilar characteristics but are not generally included in the region of Melanesia.\nIndependent Countries of Melanesia\n\u2022 Fiji 13.1 The Pacific Islands 986\n\u2022 Papua New Guinea\n\u2022 Solomon Islands\n\u2022 Vanuatu\nOther Island Groups\n\u2022 New Caledonia (France)\nFigure 13.2 The Region of Melanesia 987 World Regional Geography\nPapua New Guinea\nPapua New Guinea is the largest country in the Pacific realm and therefore the largest in Melanesia. It is diverse in\nboth physical terrain and human geography. The high mountains of the interior reach 14,793 feet. Snow has been\nknown to fall in the higher elevations even though they are located near the equator. Many local groups inhabit the\nisland, and more than seven hundred separate languages are spoken, more than in any other country in the world.\nIndigenous traditions create strong centripetal forces. Many islands of Melanesia are recently independent of their\nEuropean controllers; Papua New Guinea received independence in 1975 and is working toward fitting into the\nglobal community.\nPapua New Guinea is a diverse country that still has many mysteries to be revealed in its little-explored interior.\nThe country\u2019s large physical area provides greater opportunities for the exploitation of natural resources for\neconomic gain. The interior of the island has large areas that have not been exploited by large-scale development\nprojects. In the past few decades, oil was discovered and makes up its largest export item. Gold, copper, silver, and\nother minerals are being extracted in extensive mining operations, often by outside multinational corporations.\nSubsistence agriculture is the main economic activity of most of the people. Coffee and cocoa are examples of\nagricultural exports.\nA number of islands off Papua New Guinea\u2019s eastern coast\u2014including Bougainville\u2014have valuable mineral\ndeposits. Bougainville and the islands under its jurisdiction are physically a part of the Solomon Island\narchipelago but are politically an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea. Volcanic vents deep under the\nsea continue to bring hot magma and minerals to the surface of the ocean floor, creating valuable exploitable\nresources. Papua New Guinea has laid claim to these islands and the underwater resources within their maritime\nboundaries. Rebel movements have pushed for the independence of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville but\nhave been unsuccessful. The islands remain under the government of Papua New Guinea.\nSolomon Islands\nTo the east of the island of Guinea are the Solomon Islands, a group of more than one thousand islands. About\neighty of them hold most of the population of more than a half a million. The island of Guadalcanal was the\nsite of some of the fiercest fighting in World War II between Japan and the United States. Honiara, the capital\ncity, is on Guadalcanal. The Solomon Islands were a colony of Great Britain but gained independence in 1978. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 988\nColonialism, World War II, and ethnic conflict on the islands created serious centrifugal cultural forces, divisions,\nand political tensions over the past few decades. In 2003, military and police troops from other islands and\nAustralia intervened to restore order after ethnic tension erupted into civil unrest.\nFigure 13.3 Malaitan Chief on the Solomon Islands 989 World Regional Geography\nThe heritage and history of these islands includes local cultures complete with isolated traditions and ethnic\norganization.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nShifting tectonic plates are the source of environmental problems. Active seismic activity has created earthquakes\nand tsunami conditions that have brought devastation to the region. An earthquake of 8.1 magnitude hit the\nSolomon Islands in 2007, bringing high waves and many aftershocks. The tsunami killed at least fifty-two people,\nand as many as one thousand homes were destroyed. The islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes.\nTropical rain forests cover a number of the islands and are home to rare orchids and other organisms. There is\nconcern that these resources might be harmed by deforestation and the exploitation of resources for economic\ngain. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 990\nVanuatu\nFigure 13.4 Saint Joseph\u2019s Bay on the Isles of Pines, New Caledonia\nThese remote islands have moderate climates and beautiful coastal settings. Many have been unduly romanticized by works of\nfiction. These islands are isolated and can lack resources; life can be more difficult than it is often portrayed.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nThe country of Vanuatu was inhabited by a large number of South Pacific groups; as a result, many languages\nare spoken within a relatively small population. The French and the British both colonized the island archipelago.\nIt was called the New Hebrides before independence in 1980, when the name was changed to Vanuatu. These\nsmall volcanic islands have an active volcano and have experienced earthquakes in recent years. One of Vanuatu\u2019s\nmeans of bringing in business has been to establish offshore banking and financial services, similar to what is\nfound in the Caribbean. Many shipping firms register their ships there because of the advantages of lower taxes\nand flexible labor laws. 991 World Regional Geography\nNew Caledonia\nNew Caledonia is still a colony of France and was once a French prison colony. Under a current agreement,\nsovereignty is slowly being turned over to the local island government. Periodic reevaluations of the local\ngovernment will be conducted to see if independence can be granted.\nNew Caledonia has historically relied on subsistence agriculture and fishing for its livelihood. About 25 percent\nof the world\u2019s known nickel resources are located here. Nickel resources will substantially affect the economy,\nbring in foreign investments, and raise the standard of living.\nFiji\nFiji is located in the eastern sector of Melanesia and has almost one million people. The country includes more\nthan one hundred inhabitable islands, but two are home to most of the population. Colonialism heavily impacted\nthe population\u2019s ethnic makeup. During British colonial rule, thousands of workers from South Asia were brought\nin by the British to work on the sugar plantations. After a century of British rule, Fiji became independent in 1970.\nThe people of South Asian descent remained in Fiji and now make up more than one-third of the population.\nEthnic conflicts erupted on the political scene between the Melanesian majority and the South Asian minority.\nPolitical coups and coalition governments have attempted to work out political solutions with limited success. Fiji\nis quite well developed and has a substantial tourism industry that augments the other agricultural and mining\nactivities. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 992\nMicronesia\nNorth of the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea is the large region of Micronesia. The \u201cmicro\u201d portion of\nthe name refers to the fact that the islands are small in size\u2014often only one square mile or so in physical area. The\nregion has more than two thousand islands. Most of the islands are composed of coral and do not extend above sea\nlevel to any large extent. These low islands dominate the high islands. The high islands are usually of volcanic\norigin and reach elevations in the thousands of feet.\nGuam\nThe largest island in Micronesia is Guam. It is only 210 square miles in area and reaches an elevation of 1,335\nfeet at its highest point. Coral reefs surround Guam\u2019s volcanic center. Guam is not an independent country but a\nUS possession. The island was a strategic location during World War II, and the United States has major military\ninstallations located on the island.\nFigure 13.5 993 World Regional Geography\nGuam is a US possession. This photo shows the front of the University of Guam\u2019s School of Nursing. The university has more than\nthree thousand students and is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in the United States.\nGuampedia Foundation \u2013 UOG School of Nursing \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nNorthern Mariana Islands\nThe Northern Mariana Islands are next to Guam and are current US possessions, along with Wake Island in\nthe northeast. The US administers the United Nations Trust Territory of the Federated States of Micronesia.\nImplemented in 1986 and renewed again in 2004, the islands entered into the Compact of Free Association with\nthe United States and established an independent status. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 994\nNauru\nThe independent island country of Nauru is only about eight square miles in physical area, but its large phosphate\ndeposits created enormous wealth for its small population. Once the phosphates had been mined, however, there\nwas little means to gain wealth on such a small island with a devastated landscape. Many on Nauru are trying to\nlive off the investments from their mining wealth or have moved to find a livelihood elsewhere.\nIndependent Countries of Micronesia\n\u2022 Federated States of Micronesia\n\u2022 Kiribati (Western)\n\u2022 Marshall Islands\n\u2022 Nauru\n\u2022 Palau\nOther Island Groups\n\u2022 Guam (US)\n\u2022 Gilbert Islands (Kiribati)\n\u2022 Northern Mariana Islands (US)\n\u2022 Wake Island (US)\nFigure 13.6 995 World Regional Geography\nThe majority of islands in Micronesia are low islands composed of coral.\nPalau\nPalau, located in western Micronesia, has a population of about twenty thousand people and an area of about 177\nsquare miles. Its early inhabitants included people from Asia and from the Pacific realm. British explorers arrived\nearly on the island, but Spain dominated it during the colonial era. After losing the Spanish-American War, Spain\nsold the island to Germany, which implemented mining operations on the island. After its defeat in World War I,\nGermany lost the island to Japan. Japan used it as a strategic outpost but was defeated in World War II and had\nto give up all its external possessions. After 1945, Palau was held by the United States and the UN. In 1994, the\nisland opted for independence and retained an agreement of free association with the United States. The United\nStates has held strategic military installations on Palau and other islands in Micronesia. Palau\u2019s economic and\ngeopolitical dynamics are highly reflective of US activities in the region. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 996\nMarshall Islands\nMarshall Islands, on the eastern side of Micronesia, experienced serious devastation from the conflict between\nJapan and the United States during World War II. The Marshall Islands became a testing ground for US nuclear\nweapons. Atomic bombs were tested on various atolls, rendering them uninhabitable. An atoll is a coral island\nthat surrounds a lagoon. From 1946 to 1958, the United States conducted sixty-seven atmospheric nuclear tests\nin the Marshall Islands. The largest was known as the Bravo test, which included the detonation of a nuclear\ndevice over Bikini Atoll that was one thousand times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima\nduring World War II. There are concerns about radioactive fallout that may still affect the people who inhabit\nnearby atolls. The Marshall Islands were granted independence in 1986 with an agreement with the United States\nto provide aid and protection in exchange for the use of US military bases on the islands.\nPolynesia\nThe largest region of the Pacific is Polynesia, a land of many island groups with large distances between them.\nThe root word poly means \u201cmany.\u201d Numerous groups of islands have come together under separate political\narrangements. The region includes the Hawaiian Islands in the north and the Pitcairn Islands and Easter Island\nto the east. New Zealand is now studied as a part of the Austral realm, but the Maori living there are originally\nfrom Polynesia. Polynesia has a mixture of island types ranging from the high mountains of Hawaii, which\nare more than 13,800 feet, to low-lying coral atolls that are only a few feet above sea level. Islands that have\nenough elevation to condense moisture from the clouds receive adequate precipitation, but many islands with low\nelevations have a shortage of fresh water, making habitation or human development difficult.\nPolynesian culture stems from island resources. Fishing, farming, and an understanding of the seas created a way\nof life that gave Polynesia its identity. Polynesians created innovative maps that provided a means of sailing across\nlarge expanses of open seas to connect with distant islands. Their lifestyle revolved around natural resources and\nthe creative use of natural materials. Polynesian art, music, and language reflect a diversity of cultural trends\nderived from a common heritage. The warm climate and beautiful islands contrast with violent destructive storms\nand a lack of fresh water or resources, which can make life difficult. 997 World Regional Geography\nFigure 13.7\nThe region of Polynesia has island groups that are high islands with mountainous interiors.\nIndependent Countries of Polynesia\n\u2022 Kiribati (eastern)\n\u2022 Samoa\n\u2022 Tonga\n\u2022 Tuvalu\nMain Island Possessions\n\u2022 American Samoa (US)\n\u2022 Cook Islands (NZ)\n\u2022 Hawaiian Islands (US)\n\u2022 Pitcairn Islands (UK)\n\u2022 French Polynesia (FR)\n\u25e6 Austral Islands\n\u25e6 The Marquesas 13.1 The Pacific Islands 998\n\u25e6 Society Islands and Tahiti\n\u25e6 Tuamotu Islands\nHawaii\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, Polynesia only had four independent island groups: Kiribati, Samoa,\nTonga, and Tuvalu. The rest of the many islands and island groups in Polynesia are claimed by or under the\ncontrol or jurisdiction of other countries: mainly the United States, France, Great Britain, or New Zealand. Hawaii\nwas a sovereign and independent kingdom from 1810 to 1893, when the monarchy was overthrown and the islands\nbecame a republic that was annexed as a US territory. Hawaii became the fiftieth US state in 1959. Hawaii\u2019s\ndevelopment pattern is modern, based on tourism from the continental United States and the US military base on\nPearl Harbor. According to the US Census, Hawaii had a population of 1.3 million in 2010. More than one-third\nof the people are of Asian descent, and at least 10 percent are native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders. The United\nStates has a number of additional possessions in Polynesia that include various small islands, atolls, or uninhabited\nreefs.\nThe Hawaiian Islands include more islands than the few usually listed in tourist brochures. Approximately 137\nislands and atolls are in the Hawaiian chain, which extends about 1,500 miles. Hawaii is one of the most remote\nisland groups in the Pacific. The islands of the Hawaiian archipelago are a product of volcanic activity from an\nundersea magma source called a hotspot, which remains stationary as the tectonic plate over it continues to shift\ncreating new volcanoes. Mt. Kilauea, an active volcano on Hawaii, the largest island in the Hawaiian chain, is\nconsidered by geologists to be one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The active volcano of Mauna Loa\nand two dormant volcanoes, Mauna Kea and Hual\u0101lai, are on the same island. Mauna Kea is Hawaii\u2019s tallest\nmountain at 13,796 feet above sea level, which is taller than Mt. Everest if measured from its base on the ocean\nfloor.\nHawaii, like most islands of the Pacific realm, has a tropical type A climate, but snow can be found on the tops\nof its highest mountains during the winter months. The island of Kauai receives more than 460 inches of rain per\nyear and is one of the wettest places on Earth. The rain shadow effect created by Mt. Wai\u2019ale\u2019ale is the reason for\nthe high level of precipitation. All the rain falls on the windward side of the mountain, creating a rain shadow on\nthe leeward side of the mountain, which is a semidesert. 999 World Regional Geography\nKiribati\nKiribati includes three sets of islands located in both Micronesia and Polynesia. The main component of Kiribati\nis the Gilbert Island chain in Micronesia, where the capital city and most of the population are located. The other\ntwo minor island chains are the Phoenix Islands and the Line Islands in Polynesia. Both island chains were US\npossessions before being annexed with the Gilbert Islands to become Kiribati. The Line Islands were used for\ntesting of British hydrogen bombs starting in 1957. Three atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted by the British\non Malden Island, and six were conducted on Christmas Island. There is concern about how radiation affected\npeople present during the tests and thereafter. The Phoenix Islands have few inhabitants. In 2008, Kiribati declared\nthe entire island group a protected environmental area, which made it the largest protected marine habitat in the\nworld. Kiribati is the only country with land in all four hemispheres: north and south of the equator and on both\nsides of the 180\u00b0 meridian.\nSamoa\nAfter the colonial era, Samoa was divided into Western Samoa and Eastern Samoa. The United States controlled\nthe eastern islands, which are referred to as American Samoa. Before World War I, Germany gained control of\nthe larger, more extensive western islands only to lose them to New Zealand after the war. Western Samoa was\nunder the New Zealand government until 1962, when it gained independence. The name was officially changed\nfrom Western Samoa to Samoa in 1997.\nThe Samoan Islands are volcanic, and the most active volcano last erupted in 1906. In Samoa, three-quarters of\nthe nearly two hundred thousand people live on the larger of the two main islands. Colonialism has had a major\nimpact on the culture, especially in the case of religion. Christianity became widespread once it was introduced\nand is now the religion of about 99 percent of the population. American music and societal trends are also a major\ninfluence on the islands because of migration between Hawaii and the US mainland. Many Samoans have moved\nto the United States and established communities. Cultural traditions have been preserved and are often integrated\ninto modern society. Samoa has some of the oldest history and traditions of Polynesia. For many years, the United\nStates has held an extensive naval station in the bay of Pago Pago on American Samoa. During World War II,\nthere were more US military personnel on the islands than Samoans. American Samoa became a key military post\nfor the United States. American Samoa remains a US possession; however, Samoans are not US citizens unless\none of their parents is a US citizen. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 1000\nTonga\nSouth of Samoa is an archipelago that is home to the Kingdom of Tonga. Only about 36 of the 169 islands are\ninhabited by a total population of about one hundred twenty thousand people. Tonga is ruled by a monarchy that\nnever lost its governance powers throughout the colonial era. Tonga is the only monarchy in the Pacific. The two\nmain methods of gaining wealth are by remittances from citizens working abroad and tourism.\nTuvalu\nThe island nation of Tuvalu comprises four reef islands and five atolls for a total land area of about ten square\nmiles. In 2008, it had a population of about twelve thousand people. These statistics indicate that Tuvalu is one\nof the four smallest countries in the world. Nauru is only about eight square miles in area. Only the Vatican and\nMonaco are smaller. The low elevation of the islands of Tuvalu make them susceptible to damage from rising sea\nlevels. The highest point is only fifteen feet in elevation. Any increase in ocean levels as a result of climate change\ncould threaten the existence of this country.\nFrench Polynesia\nThe South Pacific is home to many islands and island groups that are not independent countries. The biggest and\nmost significant group in the southern region is French Polynesia. France colonized a large number of islands in\nthe South Pacific and has continued to hold them in its control or possession as external departments or colonies. 1001 World Regional Geography\nIn western Polynesia, the French maintain control over the islands of Wallis and Futuna. French Polynesia consists\nof four main island groups: the Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Tuamotu Islands, and the Marquesas.\nThere are around 130 islands in French Polynesia, and many are too small or lack resources to be inhabited.\nFigure 13.8 The Moorea Ferry in Papeete Harbor, Tahiti\nThe only ways to get to the islands are by aircraft or by ship. Transportation costs can be high for imported goods or for tourism\ndevelopment.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 2.5.\nTahiti, located in the Society Islands, is the central hub of French Polynesia. Papeete is the capital and main city\nwith a population of almost thirty thousand. Tahiti is a major tourist destination with a mild climate that stays at\n75 \u00b0F to 85 \u00b0F year-round and receives adequate rainfall to sustain tropical forests. Most of the people live along\nthe coastal areas; the interior is almost uninhabited. The Society Islands include the island of Bora Bora, which\nis considered by many to be a tropical paradise and one of the most exotic tourist destinations in the world. 13.1 The Pacific Islands 1002\nFigure 13.9 Bora Bora in the Society Islands in French Polynesia with Mount Otemanu in the Background\nBora Bora is a world-class tourist destination catering to the international traveler.\nTensaibuta \u2013 Bora Bora \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThe volcanic Marquesas Islands to the northeast are the second-most remote islands in the world after the\nHawaiian Islands. The weather pattern in the Pacific does not bring enormous amounts of precipitation to\nthe Marquesas, a reality that restricts human expansion in the archipelago. The higher elevations in the\nmountains\u2014the highest is 4,035 feet\u2014draw some precipitation from the rain shadow effect, giving rise to lush\nrain forests on portions of the islands. With less than ten thousand people, the Marquesas do not have a large\npopulation to support and rely on financial support from outside to sustain them. French painter Paul Gauguin is\nburied there, and the islands are remembered as his home during the last years of his life.\nThe Austral Islands are the southernmost group of islands in French Polynesia and are home to only about\n6,500 people. French Polynesia also includes the Tuamotu Archipelago, between the Society Islands and the\nMarquesas, which comprises about 75 atolls and an uncounted number of coral reefs that extend for about nine\nhundred miles. The islands have a population of fewer than twenty thousand people, and the main economic\nactivity is the cultivation of black pearls and coconuts.\nThe French government used islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago as test sites for nuclear weapons. From 1966 to\n1974, the French tested 41 atomic devices above ground in the atmosphere, and from 1974 to 1996, they tested\n137 atomic devices below ground. Radiation concerns are the same here as they are on the Marshall Islands,\nwhere the United States tested atomic weapons. Scientific testing monitored by the World Health Organization\nhas determined the humans living closest to the atolls are not presently in danger of radioactive materials either in\nthe environment or in their food supply. The long-term effects of the underground tests continue to be monitored. 1003 World Regional Geography\nThe Pitcairn Islands, Easter Island, and the Cook Islands\nTo the east of French Polynesia are the four Pitcairn Islands, controlled by Great Britain. The main island, Pitcairn,\nis the only inhabited island in this chain and is one of the least inhabited islands in the world; the total population is\nfewer than fifty people. Mutineers from the HMS Bounty escaped to Pitcairn in 1790 after taking various Tahitians\nwith them.\nEven farther east than Pitcairn, on the edge of Polynesia, is Easter Island. Now under the government of Chile,\nEaster Island was historically inhabited by Polynesians who built large stone heads that remain somewhat of a\nmystery. At the center of Polynesia are the fifteen small Cook Islands, which are controlled by New Zealand and\nare home to about twenty thousand people, many of whom claim Maori ethnicity.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Melanesia includes the islands from Papua New Guinea to Fiji. Micronesia includes small islands located\nnorth of Melanesia. Polynesia includes island groups from the Hawaiian Islands to the Pitcairn Islands.\nPapua New Guinea is the largest country in the Pacific, approximately seven hundred languages are spoken\nby the many local groups that live there.\n\u2022 Low islands in this region are usually composed of coral and low in elevation. High islands are usually\nvolcanic in origin and mountainous with high elevations. Micronesia consists mainly of low islands, while\nPolynesia consists of many high islands, such as Hawaii.\n\u2022 Tourism is the main economic activity in the Pacific, but minerals and fossil fuels provide some islands with\nadditional wealth. Fishing and subsistence agriculture have been the traditional livelihoods. Offshore\nbanking has also been established in the region.\n\u2022 The United States, the United Kingdom, and France used various islands for nuclear testing. Radiation\nfallout continues to be an environmental concern. Typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic activity, earthquakes, and\nflooding create devastation on the islands. Fresh water can be a valuable resource, as it is in short supply on\nmany islands.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1. What are the three main regions of islands in the Pacific?

The cold waters off the coast of Antarctica move from west to east in a\nclockwise rotation around the continent in a movement called the West Wind Drift, or the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent. The Southern Ocean\u2019s northern boundary does not border a land mass but meets up with the Atlantic, 13.2 Antarctica 1008\nPacific, and Indian Oceans. Most geographers accept the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean to be located\nsouth of 60\u00b0 latitude even though the actual limit has not yet been firmly agreed upon.\nThe Southern Ocean\u2019s northern boundary has more to do with the marine conditions of the realm. There is a\ntransition called the Subtropical Convergence in which the cold, dense waters of the Southern Ocean meet up\nwith the warmer waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The cold, dense water from the south sinks\nbelow the warm waters from the north to create a zone of upwelling and mixing that is conducive to high levels of\nproductivity for organisms such as phytoplankton and krill. The zone of Subtropical Convergence can be visually\nobserved by the grayish, cold southern waters meeting up with the bluish-green, warm northern waters. The krill,\nwhich thrive on phytoplankton, are an important link in the food chain for marine organism such as fish, penguins,\nseals, albatrosses, and whales in the Southern Ocean.\nPhysical Geography\nThe world has seven focal continents. Rated by physical area from the largest to the smallest, they are Asia, Africa,\nNorth America, South America, Antarctica, Australia, and Europe. Antarctica, which is larger than Australia and\n1.3 times larger than Europe, is located entirely south of 60\u00b0 latitude and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean.\nAntarctica has the highest average elevation of any continent; there are many mountain ranges. The two-thousand-\nmile-long Transantarctic Mountain range divides Antarctica into a small western region and a larger eastern\nregion. At both ends of the Transantarctic Mountains are the two main ice shelves: the Ross Ice Shelf and the\nRonne Ice Shelf. The Ellsworth Mountains are located in the western region and are home to Mt. Vinson (or the\nVinson Massif), which is the highest peak on the continent, reaching an elevation of 16,050 feet. This is higher\nthan any mountain in the contiguous, continental United States, Europe, or Australia. 1009 World Regional Geography\nFigure 13.11 Size Comparison of Antarctica and the United States\nAntarctica without the ice sheet would be considerably smaller; some estimate it would be only about one hundred thousand square\nmiles in land area, or the equivalent of the physical area of the US state of Colorado.\nNASA \u2013 public domain.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is actually an extension of the Andes Mountains of South America and is home to\nactive volcanoes. The peninsula is the location of a volcano on Deception Island that erupted in the late 1960s\nand destroyed research stations in the area. There was an additional large eruption in 1970. The volcano continues\nto show activity, and sightings of lava flow continue to be reported. There may be more volcanic activity than\nwhat has been recorded. An underwater volcano in the Antarctic Peninsula was discovered in 2004. Mt. Erebus\n(12,448 feet), located on Ross Island on the other side of Antarctica from the Antarctic Peninsula, is the world\u2019s\nsouthernmost active volcano. Mt. Erebus has been active since 1972 and has a large lava lake in its inner crater.\nAbout 98 percent of Antarctica is covered by an ice sheet that is, on average, up to a mile deep. In some areas, it is\nnearly three miles deep. In the winter season, the ice sheet\u2019s area might double as it extends out from the coastline.\nThe Antarctic ice sheet holds about 70 percent of the earth\u2019s fresh water. If the ice sheet were to melt, the sea level\ncould rise considerably and cover many of the earth\u2019s low-lying islands, peninsulas, and coastal regions with low\nelevations. Antarctica is considered a desert because it usually averages fewer than ten inches of precipitation per\nyear. Coastal regions annually receive as much as four feet of snow, while the interior near the South Pole might\nonly receive a few inches.\nFigure 13.12 13.2 Antarctica 1010\nMt. Erebus (12,448 feet), located on Ross Island, is Antarctica\u2019s most active volcano and has a lava lake in its inner crater.\nLin padgham \u2013 Mt Erebus \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\nThere are areas in Antarctica that are not covered with ice but have a landscape of bare ground. This nonice\nportion of the continent protrudes above the ice sheet and only covers a combined physical area equivalent to\nabout half the US state of Kentucky. The only plant life that exists here are the many different mosses and lichens\nthat grow during short periods of the year. Below the giant ice sheet are dozens of subglacial lakes. Lake Vostok,\nthe largest lake discovered in the Antarctic so far, was found two miles below the ice sheet and is the size of Lake\nOntario. It is unknown what aquatic life might exist in these lakes. If all the ice and snow were removed from\nthe continent, the total land area would be considerably smaller and would consist mainly of mountain ranges and\nislands. Some estimate that this land area altogether would only equate to about one hundred thousand square\nmiles, roughly equivalent to the physical area of the US state of Colorado. This does not account for the fact that\nif all the ice were to melt, the sea level would rise and cover more land area. The land portion of the continent\nwould also expand upward because of the loss of the weight of the ice, which has been compressing the continent.\nNot only is Antarctica the driest continent with the least average annual precipitation and the highest continent\nin average elevation; it is also the coldest of the continents. The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was\n\u2212128 \u00b0F in 1983 at a Russian research station in Antarctica. Temperatures reach a minimum of less than \u2212110 \u00b0F\nin winter in the interior and greater than 55 \u00b0F near the coast in summer. No permanent human settlements exist\nin Antarctica other than research stations from a number of countries. 1011 World Regional Geography\nThe Antarctic Treaty\nThe continent is not politically controlled by any one government. Early seafaring explorers sailed in these waters,\nand various countries laid claim to sections of the continent. The continent was first sighted by explorers in 1820,\nand the South Pole was first reached in 1911. Land claims to the continent were established by the home countries\nof early explorers. Forty-six countries are now included in the Antarctic Treaty, which was originally signed\nby twelve countries in 1959. The treaty, designed to protect the environment and encourage scientific research,\nprohibits military activities, mineral mining, and the disposal of waste products. All land claims were suspended\nwhen the Antarctic Treaty was initiated, but the claims are not without political ramifications. Antarctica is\ndivided into pie-shaped sections, and each of the original claimant countries is allocated a portion, according to\ntheir claim. The countries with original claims are Norway, New Zealand, France, Chile, Australia, and Argentina.\nOther countries, including Brazil, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and the United States, have reserved their\nright to submit claims on the continent in the future if the issue of territorial claims becomes significant. A large\nsector of West Antarctica called Marie Byrd Land remains unclaimed.\nResearch stations account for the entire human population in Antarctica. Approximately one thousand people live\nin Antarctica year-round, and up to five thousand or more live there during the summer months. Many of the\nresearch stations rotate their personnel, and tours of duty last anywhere from a few months to a year or more.\nVarious family groups have worked there as well as other service workers, including Russian Orthodox priests,\nwho have rotated every year at one of the Russian research stations.\nFigure 13.13 Emperor Penguins, Ross Sea, Antarctica 13.2 Antarctica 1012\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 public domain.\nTourism brings the largest number of additional people to the continent. Tourists come for short-term visits to\nexperience the conditions or see the many species of penguins or fauna that exist here. More than forty-five\nthousand tourists visit the Antarctic Treaty area yearly. Most arrive on commercial ships that specialize in tours of\nthe region. Tours only last one or two weeks. 1013 World Regional Geography\nFigure 13.14 Antarctic Territorial Claims\nNASA \u2013 public domain.\nResearch has revealed that mineral resources are to be found under the ice in Antarctica, and oil and natural gas\nare found in offshore deposits. Antarctica is a frontier for economic development that is not under the jurisdiction\nof any one government. The Antarctic Treaty has been the determinant of the level of human activity. The\ncurrent treaty restricts any extractive activity. Fishing is also regulated within the treaty, but without enforcement\nprocedures, there have been questions about its effectiveness. Whaling was once a major industry in this realm.\nWhaling stations were established on the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby South Georgia Island. However, the\nincreased use and extraction of petroleum reduced the need for whale oil and the industry collapsed. Some\nwhaling continues in the waters of the Southern Ocean, which has led to questions about how to manage these\nnatural resources. In 1998, negotiations between interested countries met in Madrid, Spain, and created the\nProtocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (known as the Madrid Protocol). The protocol\ndesignates Antarctica as a natural reserve that can only be used for peaceful purposes and for science. All mining\nor economic activity is banned. 13.2 Antarctica 1014\nClimate Change\nFigure 13.15 The Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change\nClimactic conditions on Earth have varied widely during the planet\u2019s history. There have been long periods of\nheating or cooling. The last ice age, which ended about ten thousand years ago, created large ice sheets that\ncovered much of the Northern Hemisphere. The earth then entered into the current interglacial period with warmer\ntemperatures that melted the ice sheets; the polar regions have the last remaining ice on the planet. The earth has\nexperienced large fluctuations in its temperature at various times in its past. Natural changes in the conditions that\naffect climate can include but are not limited to the dynamics of the sun, changes in the earth\u2019s orbit, and volcanic\neruptions. 1015 World Regional Geography\nHuman activity has impacted conditions both locally and globally. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have\nbeen pumping enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which affects the planet\u2019s climate and\ntemperature. The Industrial Revolution introduced the burning of coal as a fuel to boil water to operate steam\nengines. This allowed power to become more versatile and mobile. The introduction of the automobile increased\nthe burning of petroleum, which released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the form of engine exhaust.\nLarge-scale deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels have increased the quantity of heat-trapping \u201cgreenhouse\ngases\u201d in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide, methane, carbon dioxide, and similar gases act like the glass panels of\na greenhouse that allow short-wave radiation from the sun to enter but do not allow the long-wave radiation of\nheat to escape into space. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that use carbon dioxide and store carbon in\nplant fibers. The burning of wood or carbon-based energy sources such as oil or coal releases the carbon back into\nthe atmosphere. Fossil fuels are created when dead plant and animal life have been under pressure and decay for\nlong periods and have retained their carbon component. This all leads to a rise in the activity of the carbon cycle.\nCarbon is a key component to the regulation of the earth\u2019s temperature. Life on Earth is dependent on temperature\nconditions that are regulated by the atmosphere. This natural cycle has been augmented by human activity.\nChanging global temperatures are one aspect of climate change that has received attention in recent years.\nTechnically speaking, global warming is an average increase in the temperature of the atmosphere near the\nearth\u2019s surface. Few environmental effects could impact Antarctica as much as the phenomenon of changing\ntemperatures. There would be major ramifications for the entire world if temperatures would increase to the extent\nthat the Antarctic ice sheet would melt and dissolve away. Sea levels would rise, and many areas of the planet\nwith large urban populations would be flooded. For instance, many of the largest urban centers in the world are\nport cities that rely on the import and export of goods and materials. These cities would be in danger of being\nunder water if the sea level were to rise even a few feet, let alone up to two hundred feet (approximated to be\nequivalent to the volume of water in the polar ice caps). It should be noted that light-colored surfaces such as snow\nand ice reflect more radiation than do darker surfaces. If the Antarctic ice sheet were to melt, this would certainly\nexacerbate global climate change, as more radiation would be absorbed at the surface (land and water). Climate\nchange might also affect agricultural production. Global changes in temperature would alter ecosystems and the\nhabitats of organisms, changing the balance of nature in many biomes.\nThe scientific community continues to study the dynamics of climate change. In the last decade, some of the\nwarmest annual temperatures in the past century have been documented. Data gathered from both the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) indicate that the earth\u2019s surface temperatures have increased by more than one degree in the past one\nhundred years. 13.2 Antarctica 1016\nOzone Depletion\nClimate change can have a major impact on atmospheric conditions. It should be noted that good ozone depletion\nin the stratosphere (the second layer of the earth\u2019s atmosphere) has different causes and conditions than\ntemperature change in the troposphere (the layer just above the earth\u2019s surface). The two concepts have separate\nand distinct dynamics that are not directly related. Ozone (O3) is a simple molecule consisting of three oxygen\natoms. Common oxygen gas molecules have two oxygen atoms (O2). Depending on where ozone is located in the\natmosphere, it can be either a protective safeguard from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or an element in\nsmog that causes health problems. Good ozone in the stratosphere provides a protective shield preventing harmful\nUV radiation from reaching the earth. UV rays from the sun are known to cause skin cancers, eye damage, and\nharm to organisms such as plankton. Bad ozone molecules in the troposphere mix with various chemicals to create\nsmog, which reduces visibility and can cause respiratory health problems. Tropospheric smog might contribute\nto climate change but does not serve the same function as ozone molecules in the stratosphere. The depletion of\ngood ozone in the stratosphere is a different chemical process than the creation of bad ozone in the troposphere.\nOzone in the stratosphere is vital to the protection of living organisms from damaging UV radiation from the\nsun. In the stratosphere, UV radiation is absorbed in a continuous cycle in which oxygen molecules are turned\ninto ozone molecules and then back into oxygen molecules. Oxygen molecules (O2) absorb UV radiation in the\nstratosphere and separate into two oxygen atoms (O2 \u2192 2 O). Each of these oxygen atoms (O) will attach to\nanother oxygen molecule to create an ozone molecule (O + O2 \u2192 O3). Each ozone molecule (O3) will absorb\nUV radiation, which separates it back into an oxygen molecule and an atomic oxygen atom (O3 \u2192 O2 + O). The\nseparate oxygen (O) atom will attach to another separate oxygen atom (O) to become an oxygen molecule (O2)\nagain (O + O \u2192 O2). This cycle will continue to absorb UV radiation and keep UV radiation from reaching the\nearth\u2019s surface. It is a chemical reaction that gives off heat and increases the stratosphere\u2019s temperature.\nChemicals such as chlorine and bromine interact with protective ozone molecules in the stratosphere and break\nthem down in a chain reaction that depletes the stratosphere of ozone molecules and stops the cycle that absorbs\nthe UV radiation. One chlorine molecule can destroy one hundred thousand ozone molecules, and bromine atoms\ncan destroy ozone molecules at a rate of many times that of chlorine. Chlorine and bromine enter the stratosphere\nthrough the discharge of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and other chemicals that\ndeplete ozone molecules. These chemicals have been mainly used in industrial processes such as refrigeration and\nair conditioning and in solvents and insulation foam. In the stratosphere, radiation from the sun breaks HCFCs\nand CFCs apart, releasing chlorine atoms that destroy ozone molecules. 1017 World Regional Geography\nFigure 13.16\nOzone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.\nFigure 13.17 13.2 Antarctica 1018\nOne of the largest ozone holes was observed in 2006 over Antarctica.\nNASA \u2013 public domain.\nThis process also occurs naturally when volcanoes erupt and emit sulfur aerosols into the atmosphere. The sulfur\naerosols break down CFCs and halon; this results in the release of chlorine and bromine, which deplete ozone\nmolecules. In recent years, nitrous oxide has become a major chemical that can reach the stratosphere to act as\nan agent in the ozone depletion process. Nitrous oxide can be released into the atmosphere from human activities\nsuch as the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture or from vehicle exhaust from burning fossil fuels. Nitrous\noxide is also released naturally from the soil or from ocean water.\nOzone depletion has been especially noticeable over Antarctica. A large area of ozone depletion in the upper\natmosphere is often called an ozone hole. The ozone hole over Antarctica is not exactly a total depletion of ozone\nbut a major reduction in the amount of ozone found in the stratosphere over the South Pole. Recent ozone levels\nin the stratosphere over Antarctica have decreased and are lower than they were in 1975. Polar stratospheric\nclouds, which sometimes develop over Antarctica during the extremely cold winter months, severely reduce ozone\nlevels. The clouds trap chlorine and nitric acid in their ice crystals. As the circulation of westerly winds starts\nin the spring, an atmospheric vortex is created over the polar area. The ozone hole increases during the spring\nwhen sunlight increases\u2014from September to early December. The sunlight speeds up the chemical reactions that 1019 World Regional Geography\ndeplete the ozone molecules. During this time, as much as half of the lower stratospheric ozone can be destroyed,\ncreating an ozone hole.\nGlobal Impacts and Organizations\nMany governments around the world have established agencies to address environmental issues and have invested\nresources in continued research and scientific discovery. Many nongovernmental agencies and organizations such\nas Greenpeace International have also been established to address the development or management of Antarctica\nand to address environmental concerns. International organizations such as the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) have been formed to enhance cooperation between countries and concerned entities. In\n1998, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the UNEP and the World\nMeteorological Organization to address the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC). Through an international treaty, the agency focuses on the harmful effects of climate change.\nOne outcome of the UNFCCC\u2019s work was the Kyoto Protocol developed in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, which created\na legal commitment by participants to reduce greenhouse gases and address climate change issues. As of 2010,\n191 countries have signed on to the initiative. The United States has not yet ratified the protocol. Enforcing the\nKyoto Protocol is a matter of debate. The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (also referred to as\nthe Copenhagen Summit) was held in Denmark to address some of the same issues that were discussed in the\nKyoto Protocol.\nFigure 13.18 One Projection of the Subglacial Topography of Antarctica below the Ice Sheet 13.2 Antarctica 1020\nThis is what Antarctica might look like if all the ice were removed. The physical area remaining is estimated by some to be about\none hundred thousand square miles, which is about the same physical area as the US state of Colorado. It is unclear what the actual\nphysical area would be if the ice melted.\nWikimedia Commons \u2013 CC BY 3.0.\nDepletion of the stratospheric ozone over the polar regions or the thinning of the ozone layer over the midlatitudes\nwould have worldwide implications for human activity and environmental conditions. Climate change is not\nrestricted to one country or one government; these and other environmental issues affect the whole planet and\nimpact everyone, whether they are contributing to the problem or not. If the sea level were to rise to the level\npredicted because of global warming, it would affect every country with a coastline in the world. It would not\nbe restricted to any one category of country, developed or undeveloped. Issues of increased UV radiation or\nclimate change are not restricted by political boundaries or economic conditions; they require global thinking and\nawareness and cannot be solved by one country alone\u2014if they can be solved at all. 1021 World Regional Geography\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Antarctica has the highest average elevation of any continent and has many mountains. The continent\nincludes active volcanoes, high mountains, and the Transantarctic Mountain range. The continent is\nsurrounded by the Southern Ocean.\n\u2022 The ice sheet that covers Antarctica is more than a mile thick and holds about 70 percent of the earth\u2019s fresh\nwater. Antarctica is still considered a desert because it receives so little precipitation on an average basis.\nLarge bodies of water are also located below the ice sheet.\n\u2022 The concept of global warming is one aspect of climate change that indicates an increase in greenhouse\ngasses such as carbon dioxide, which help regulate the temperature of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The end result\nis warmer temperatures on the earth\u2019s surface. The burning of fossil fuels is a main source of carbon dioxide\nthat enters the atmosphere. Climate change may result in the melting of the polar ice sheet over Antarctica,\nwhich could raise sea levels considerably.\n\u2022 Ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful UV radiation from the sun. Various chemicals\nreduce the amount of protective ozone in the stratosphere, which allows more UV radiation to reach the\nearth. A seasonal cycle varies the amount of ozone in the stratosphere over the South Pole, causing an ozone\nhole when ozone is not abundant.\nDiscussion and Study Questions\n1.

The low coral islands and the high volcanic islands of the South Pacific can be divided into three regional\ngroups: Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. The Pacific islands cover the world\u2019s largest geographic\nrealm, and there is a great distance between many of the island groups.\n2. The Pacific has a high level of ethnic diversity; there are hundreds of different languages and cultural\ntraditions. Papua New Guinea is the largest island and is host to more than seven hundred languages.\nVarious Pacific islands remain possessions of France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or the United\nStates.\n3. The Pacific islands are subject to natural forces such as typhoons, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis,\nand tropical storms. Some of the islands have radiation issues because they were used as nuclear test sites by\nthe United States, France, and Great Britain. Other environmental issues relate to deforestation and the lack\nof fresh water.\n4. Antarctica is an ice-covered continent that is larger than the continents of Europe or Australia. The Southern\nOcean surrounds Antarctica, which is located entirely south of 60\u00b0 latitude. Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet is more\nthan a mile thick but does not cover the entire land surface. Extensive mountain ranges exist with volcanic\npeaks that have erupted in recent years. The only permanent human settlements in Antarctica are research\nstations.\n5. The concept of global warming may impact the continent of Antarctica if temperatures rise and the ice sheet\nmelts rapidly. Temperature increases in the atmosphere might be a result of an increase in greenhouse gases\ncaused by the burning of carbon-based fossil fuels.\n6. Ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ozone depletion in the\nstratosphere can be caused by the release of industrial chemicals. A large ozone hole sometime exists above\nAntarctica during a seasonal increase in ozone depleting elements.\n1023 "}
