These studies have shown that spatial disparities in knowledge\nand creativity are not short-term transitional events but rather a fundamental\nstructural element of society and the economy.\nThe volumes in the series on Knowledge and Space cover a broad range of topics\nrelevant to all disciplines in the humanities and social sciences focusing on\nknowledge, intellectual capital, and human capital: clashes of knowledge; milieus\nof creativity; geographies of science; cultural memories; knowledge and the\neconomy; learning organizations; knowledge and power; ethnic and cultural\ndimensions of knowledge; knowledge and action; and mobilities of knowledge.\nThese topics are analyzed and discussed by scholars from a range of disciplines,\nschools of thought, and academic cultures.\nKnowledge and Space is the outcome of an agreement concluded by the Klaus\nTschira Foundation and Springer in 2006.\nMore information about this series at http://www.springer.com/series/7568 Peter Meusburger \u2022 Benno Werlen\nLaura Suarsana\nEditors\nKnowledge and Action Editors\nPeter Meusburger Benno Werlen\nDepartment of Geography Department of Geography\nHeidelberg University Friedrich Schiller University Jena\nHeidelberg, Germany Jena, Germany\nLaura Suarsana\nDepartment of Geography\nHeidelberg University\nHeidelberg, Germany\nISSN 1877-9220\nKnowledge and Space\nISBN 978-3-319-44587-8 ISBN 978-3-319-44588-5 (eBook)\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44588-5\nLibrary of Congress Control Number: 2016959756\n\u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

That\npoint of departure makes it evident that the mutual relations between knowledge,\naction, and space are central research issues in disciplines dealing with human exis-\ntence. For instance, acting under conditions of uncertainty, people must rely on\nexperience gained in various situations and environments. To achieve their goals,\nthey have to gather new information, acquire new knowledge, and develop new\nskills in order to cope with unexpected situations and unfamiliar challenges.\nKnowledge, experience, and information-processing are the foremost resources\ndetermining how aims of actions are set; how situations, opportunities, and risks are\nassessed; and how constellations, cues, and patterns are interpreted. They are the\nprimary foundations for evaluating locations and spatial configurations, solving\n1 The close relationship between knowledge and power is evident by the very fact that they have the\nsame etymological roots. The word power derives from the Latin potere (to be able). The Latin\nnoun potentia denotes an ability, capacity, or aptitude to affect outcomes, to make something pos-\nsible. It can therefore be translated as both knowledge and power (see also Avelino & Rotmans,\n2009, p. 550; Meusburger, 2015c, p. 31; Moldaschl & Stehr, 2010, p. 9; Sch\u00f6nrich, 2005, p. 383).\nMost authors define action as goal-directed human activity that should be differentiated from pure\nbehavior. Action is that part of behavior that occurs intentionally (see the Chap. 6 by Joachim\nFunke in this volume). Knowledge has an impact on action and behavior.\nP.

Werlen\nproblems, and enabling individual actors and social systems to appropriate space.\nKnowledge, learning, and information-processing can be regarded as links between\naction and space or action and environment (for details see Meusburger, 2003).\nConversely, the spatial dimension plays a key role in the acquisition of knowledge\nand the implementation of actions. Scholars broadly agree on several points:\n\u2022 Commitment and willful intent alone do not guarantee goal attainment.\n\u2022 Goal-setting (is a given goal desirable and feasible?) and goal-striving (how is\nthe goal being pursued?) are affected by knowledge, skills, experience, and the\nsearch for new information.\n\u2022 Experience rests upon former actions in specific settings.\n\u2022 There are manifold relationships between knowledge, power, and action,\n\u2022 Learning processes are embedded in, and to some extent shaped by, the social\nand material environment.\n\u2022 Settings and locations have a fundamental significance in the search for and\naccess to rare or valuable information, the acquisition and distribution of knowl-\nedge, and the successful implementation of actions.\nHowever, the devil is in the details. Relationships between knowledge, action,\nand space are very complex, some of them are still not fully understood. Some theo-\nretical approaches focus on very simple problems (laboratory experiments) or work\nwith a number of black boxes or questionable premises. Studying the interrelations\nof knowledge and action, one is apt to raise the following questions: To what extent\nis knowledge a precondition for action? How much knowledge is necessary for\naction? To what extent do various types of knowledge influence aspirations, atten-\ntion, evaluation of situations, search for alternatives, implementation of intentions,\ndecision-making, and problem-solving? How do bidirectional connections between\nknowledge and action function? How do different representations of knowledge\nshape action? Are knowledge, skills, experience, and educational achievement use-\nful categories or should they be replaced by broader terms such as \u201creflective sys-\ntem\u201d or \u201ccognitive capacities\u201d? How rational is human behavior? What categories\nof rationality should be distinguished? Does irrational behavior reflect a lack of\nappropriate information or is it rather affected by the impulsive system and orienta-\ntion knowledge? How do deliberative, rational thought and impulsive affect interact\nand influence action? Why do people occasionally act against their knowledge?\nWhat are the social functions of knowledge? In which way can action research\nprofit from interventions of arts and aesthetics?\nSome of the most pressing questions in the study of the interrelations of action\nand space are: Which concepts of space and place are appropriate for analyzing\nrelations between knowledge, action, and space? At what level of aggregation\n(individual, organization, spatial units)2 can relations between knowledge, action,\n2 A social system\u2019s ability to act competently and achieve its goals depends not only on the knowl-\nedge of individual actors but also on their integration in organizations (institutions), the way orga-\nnizations process information and share knowledge, interact with external social environment, and\nstructure the way decisions are taken. 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 3\nand space be documented by which indicators and empirical methods? How much\nare the spatial conditions of actions exposed to historical transformation? What\nexactly is the role and importance of spatial representations for the construction of\nsociocultural realities in the past, present and future? How does the digital revolu-\ntion change the historically established society\u2013space relations? What are the spa-\ntial implications for the formation of knowledge? Is the term environment an abstract\ncategory, a social macrophenomenon, a local cluster of individual factors of influ-\nence, or a localized culture? How can one measure an environment\u2019s impact on\naction and knowledge production (Meusburger, 2015a)?\nThese and other questions indicate that relations between knowledge, action, and\nspace are not as simple as some people might assume or as some decision and risk\nmodels or traditional rational choice theories suggest. The questions simultaneously\nunderscore the urgent need to explore the interdependencies of knowledge, action,\nand space from different disciplinary angles, scales of analysis,3 time dimensions,4\nand ontologies.\nThe main ambition of this book is to contribute to the clarification of the linkages\nbetween knowledge, action and space beyond the well-established models. To\nredeem this claim it is first necessary to overcome the problematic legacy of homo\noeconomicus and traditional rational choice theories and discuss some of the rea-\nsons why the spatial dimension was neglected or played only a marginal role in\naction-centered social theories. If we want to deepen the insights into the relations\nbetween action, knowledge and space, then the spatial dimension needs as much\ntheoretical inquiry as the relations between knowledge and action (see the chapters\nby Werlen (Chap. 2), Ernste (Chap. 3), Olsson (Chap. 4), Gardenf\u00f6rs (Chap. 12),\nand Berthoin Antal and Friedman (Chap. 13) in this volume).\nThe Neglected Spatial Dimension in Modern Social Theory\nUntil the first decade of this century, one of the key shortcomings of modern social\ntheory was the nearly total neglect of the spatial dimension of agency (Giddens,\n1984), communication, social actions (Werlen, 1993b), and social relations.\nSystematic social theories and action theories in particular have so far widely\nignored the spatial dimension of the social. This blindness for the spatial is embed-\nded in more general features of modern social theory that have important implica-\ntions not only in the field of theory, but consequently also for current societal\nproblem constellations.\n3 Each scale of analysis yields certain insights that other scales cannot deliver.\n4 Often the question of whether actors possess the knowledge necessary to solve a problem and of\nwhich impact on decision-making and actions is due to superior or earlier knowledge or ignorance\ncan be answered only after events or actions have taken place and unintended consequences have\nsurfaced. Time lags between knowledge acquisition (e.g., research) and successful action (e.g.,\ninnovations) can amount to many years or even decades. 4 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nAccording to Giddens (1984), one of the chief reasons for the underrepresenta-\ntion of spatial issues in social theory is the overemphasis on time. Time, not space,\nhas been pivotal for philosophy (Hegel, Bergson), the social sciences (Marx,\nSpencer, Durkheim), biology (Darwin), and history. Time\u2014the sequential ordering\nof events\u2014is obviously central in action theory. The implementation of action plans\nand intentions lies in the future, whereas the present situation of actions has resulted\nfrom actions of the past. Another notable reason that space aspects have not figured\ngreatly in social theory is that the spatial dimension refers first to the ordering of\nphysical objects and artifacts. It is thus allied somewhat more closely to immediate\nvisual experience and is therefore less \u201cabstract\u201d than is the case with the temporal\norder. But the main explanation for the relative neglect of the spatial dimension\npertaining to social realities in the action-centered perspective certainly stems from\nemphasis on the subjective meaning of action. The theory of social action as formu-\nlated by Weber (1912/1988, 1913, 1922/1980) implied that the embodied actor and\nthe physical world were largely left out of the biologistic and functionalist tenden-\ncies in the social sciences (Werlen & Weingarten, 2003, pp. 205\u2013207). This exclu-\nsion essentially arrested the development of concepts that could have integrated the\nspatial dimension and avoided the pitfall of biologistic or materialistic\nreductionism.\nHowever, when the spatial dimension is taken into account, the word space is\noften not understood as a theory-dependent term but rather as a given fact. The\nsocial sciences commonly refer to notions of geographic space that are considered\nrather traditional or outdated in current social and cultural geography because they\nconceptualize space as a material object, a container, or projection plane of material\nand immaterial social life. Although lack of a systematic theoretical reformulation\nof space in a more sociotheoretical compatible way is detectable in the work of\nPierre Bourdieu as well as in substantial parts of Giddens\u2019 (1984) theory of struc-\nturation, it is primarily found in social and cultural studies after a shift toward\nacceptance of the spatial dimension occurred. Exponents of this \u201cspatial turn\u201d claim\nto have overcome the spatial ignorance identified in their fields and disciplines of\nstudy. Their assertion is often unconvincing, however, because space continues to be\nthought of as a material object or container, with little progress toward a conception\nof space that is firmly grounded in social theory in a manner compatible with action.\nThe continuing overemphasis on the container or geographical earth-space in\ncultural studies and the social sciences leaves the spatial turn incomplete, inflexible,\nand myopic. These limitations also underlie fields of research and social policies in\nwhich it is not apparent at first glance, especially when \u201cnature\u201d is taken into\naccount. An especially prominent example is the sustainability research based on\nthe World Commission on Environment and Development (1987), known as the\nBrundtland report (G\u00e4bler, 2015; Werlen, 2015), and on purportedly environmental\npolicies derived from it. Casting the environment as a container space conceived in\nterms of Newton\u2019s mechanics, the recommendations for environmental policies are\nthe product of a mechanical world view. They advertise the idea that it could suffice 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 5\nto turn some screws of the world machine to, say, decrease the global temperature\nby 2.0\u00b0 Celsius, as propagated by the COP 21.5\nReconceptualization of the spatial dimension is imperative in the study of the\ninterrelation of knowledge and space. When focusing on the role of places, spaces,\nspatial settings, environments, milieus, and fields of communication for cognitive\nprocesses, learning, knowledge production, and action, one must be careful to use\nthe appropriate concepts of place and space in order to avoid implicit determinism\nand reductionism. When the concept of space as used in the natural sciences\nbecomes a primary category of social research, it has major and problematic impli-\ncations. In keeping with Newton\u2019s theoretical construction of space as a container,\nthe two most relevant ones are the underlying spatial determinism and the likelihood\nthat values, norms, and other nonmaterial entities will be reduced to earth-spatially\npositioned material objects. The morphing from immaterial to material or physical\nform will certainly not improve the results of social sciences and social politics, for\nall it does is falsify the real nature of sociocultural realities. Social research needs to\nfind its own conceptualization of the spatial dimension of societal realities, includ-\ning the generation of knowledge (for details see Schwan, 2003; Steiner, 2003;\nWeichhart, 2003, pp. 19\u201339).\nFor decades, unfortunately, subject-oriented action theory neglected the link\nbetween action and space, that is, the knowledge, competence, experience, skills,\nand learning processes of individuals, social systems, and institutions. Vague allu-\nsions to cognitive processes and reflective systems or ascriptions of meaning and\nvalue to material objects do little to explain why actions succeed or fail, why goals\nare achieved or missed, why some agents are competitive and others not, or why\ninteractions with and adaptations to the environment vary so greatly in the spatial\ndimension. The focus should be more on different preconditions and outcomes of\ncognitive processes. To what extent do different levels of knowledge, educational\nachievement, occupational skills, experience, and scientific and technological stan-\ndards influence the results of cognitive processes\u2014from perception and situation\nanalysis to decision-making and acting.\nMaterial artifacts and spatial configurations acquire a social or symbolic mean-\ning only through symbolic appropriation, through processes of learning, evaluating,\ninterpreting, and using them. The results of such ascriptions, evaluations, and inter-\npretations range from knowledgeable to ignorant, depending on the degree of expe-\nrience brought to these processes, and the results change over time. It is therefore\ncrucial to take into account the social, spatial, and cultural disparities of knowledge,\ncompetence, and experience as well as the level of research and technology when\nanalyzing relations between space and action.\nGeodeterminism emerges when the learning and evaluation processes between\nspace (as a material object) and action are skipped. For instance, a geodeterminist\nwould argue that a mountain range is a natural border; a specific terrain or a gorge,\nan optimal location for a fortification. A social geographer would argue that it is not\n5 Conference of the Parties (COP 21) held in Paris, 15\u201316 April 2016, was part of the cycle of\nmajor UN conferences on climate change. 6 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nthe terrain, gorge, or mountain pass itself that has induced people over the centuries\nto build one fortress after the other at the same place. It is rather the result of knowl-\nedge accumulation and experience over many generations that led to the firm con-\nviction or knowledge that a specific place is an ideal location for a fortress given the\navailable transportation and military technologies. As soon as hitherto existing tech-\nnologies are disrupted or political territories are expanded, the situation will be\nevaluated differently and people will conclude that other locations are more\nsuitable.\nIn human geography the adventurous sense of reconceptualizing space and spa-\ntiality suffuses the publications of Belina (2013), Gregory (1994, 1998), Harvey\n(2005), Lippuner (2005), Lippuner & Lossau (2004), Massey (1985, 1999a, 1999b,\n2005), Paasi (1991), Schmid (2005), Soja (1985), Tuan (1977), Weichhart (1996,\n1999, 2003), and Werlen (1987, 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1997, 2010a, 2010b, 2013,\n2015), to name just a few. Geographies of knowledge, education, and science\n(Freytag, Jahnke, & Kramer, 2015; J\u00f6ns, 2008; Livingstone, 1995, 2000, 2002,\n2003; Meusburger, 1998, 2000, 2008, 2009, 2015a) and creativity studies (Amabile,\nConti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996; Amabile, Goldfarb, & Brackfield, 1990;\nCsikszentmihalyi, 1988, 1999; Hennessey & Amabile, 1988; Meusburger, 2009;\nSternberg & Lubart, 1999) contributed to that discussion by documenting how edu-\ncational achievement, occupational skills, research, and creative processes influence\nactions of individuals and social systems, how research and creative processes are\nthe result of interactions between agents and their environment, and why various\nspatial disparities of socioeconomic structures persist for long periods.\nThe Problematic Legacy of Homo Oeconomicus and Rational\nChoice Theories\nTaking the spatial dimension into account first requires a critical review of the clas-\nsical models used in social sciences, especially the model of economic actions\nbased on the concept of homo oeconomicus. The claims about its general validity\nand applicability are inherently linked to the alienation of space. The concept of\nhomo oeconomicus and the assumptions that traditional rational choice theorists\nmake about the human decision-maker and some other premises have been criti-\ncized by many authors as empirically unfounded and psychologically unrealistic\n(Buskens, 2015; Flache & Dijkstra, 2015; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015; Green &\nShapiro, 1994; Goldthorpe, 2000; Haselton et al., 2009; Hertwig & Herzog, 2009;\nSamuels & Stich, 2015). Theories of bounded rationality, behavioral economics,\nevolutionary economics, new theories of the firm, the strategic management\napproach, and nonrational theories have been divested of many unrealistic premises;\nnevertheless, some theoretical concepts of decision-making used in economics and\npartly also in social sciences6 still carry the detrimental legacy of homo oeconomicus\n6 For an overview of the large variety of rational choice models, see Wittek, Snijders, & Nee (2013). 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 7\nand traditional rational choice theories. We do not repeat here the extensive critique\nof that model but rather focus on those aspects for which the lack of sensitivity to\nthe spatial dimension of human existence and sociocultural realities is playing an\nimportant role, at least from a geographer\u2019s point of view. In the geography of\nknowledge (Meusburger, 1998, 2015a, 2017), one critique is that many theoretical\nconcepts of decision-making ignore\u2014\n\u2022 social and spatial disparities of knowledge;\n\u2022 the impact that environments, spatial contexts, and spatial relations have on the\ngeneration and diffusion of knowledge;\n\u2022 the selective mobility of different categories and levels of knowledge; and\n\u2022 power structures in space. The enduring persistence of national and global urban\nhierarchies is due mainly to relations between knowledge and power, the spatial\nconcentration of power, the vertical division of labor, and selected migration.\nMutual relations between knowledge and power have been intensely discussed else-\nwhere (Gregory, 1998; Meusburger, 1998, 2000, 2015c; Meusburger, Gregory, &\nSuarsana, 2015) and need not be repeated here. They are neatly summarized by\nFoucault (1980):\n\u2022 The exercise of power perpetually creates knowledge and, conversely, knowl-\nedge constantly induces effects of power. (p. 52)\n\u2022 Knowledge and power are integrated with one another, and there is no point in\ndreaming of a time when knowledge will cease to depend on power. (p. 52)\n\u2022 It is not possible for power to be exercised without knowledge, it is impossible\nfor knowledge not to engender power. (p. 52)\nIt is also criticized that some scholars do not distinguish between knowledge and\ninformation,7 and that the costs and time needed to acquire the knowledge, exper-\ntise, and the advanced levels of educational achievement necessary to solve com-\nplex problems are neglected or underestimated.\nFrom a geographer\u2019s point of view, the ideal-type premises of homogeneous\nspace and ubiquity of knowledge are the most critical shortcomings, the assump-\ntions farthest from empirically verifiable realities. Unequal spatial and social distri-\nbution of various categories of knowledge and skills can be traced to early human\nhistory, at least to the time when the first scripts were developed (5500 BC). Spatial\nand social inequalities of knowledge, spatial concentrations of power (Meusburger,\n1998, 2000; 2008; 2015c) and hierarchically structured urban systems are a consti-\ntutive element of highly differentiated societies that are based on horizontal and\nvertical division of labor. In a knowledge society, the range of knowledge gaps,\nknowledge asymmetries, and spatial disparities of knowledge is larger than ever and\nis constantly growing.8 With respect to the assumption that knowledge is spatially\n7 For detailed discussion see vol. 10 in the series on Knowledge and Space.\n8 This statement contradicts the popular view that anybody in the digital age has access to the\nknowledge available worldwide. The Internet offers access to information, not to knowledge.\nWhether available information is understood, accepted, and assimilated into a person\u2019s existing\nknowledge base depends on complex psychological processes (Meusburger, 2017). 8 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nubiquitous, the rational choice model is so remote from the empirical facts that its\nheuristic value tends toward zero if the spatial dimension is taken seriously. The\nwide dissemination and use of the premise that space is homogenous certainly has\nto do with the exclusion of spatial and cultural constellations. Unfortunately, it has\necologically and culturally problematic consequences as well.\nEven within the rules of social modeling, the rational choice model does not\nmeet applicable standards. Models may idealize empirical reality only if their heu-\nristic value is not undermined (see Werlen 1993a; 1993b, pp. 43\u201351). If the model\nstrays too far from empirical reality, it can no longer help detect that reality\u2019s regu-\nlarities or properties. \u201cWithout knowledge, or beliefs that correspond to reality,\nthinking is an empty shell\u201d (Baron 2008, p. 15, italics in the source).\nThe premise that knowledge is ubiquitous is sometimes justified by the impact of\nthe Internet. The Internet facilitates the spatial distribution of easily understandable\ninformation and routine knowledge but certainly does not have deeper balancing\neffects on spatial disparities when it comes to the spatial distribution of jobs that\nneed advanced scientific, technical, and expert knowledge. Such jobs are not as\nmobile as some authors may assume, they tend to concentrate in certain places or\nareas (Malecki, 2000; Meusburger, 2000, 2017). Different categories of knowledge\ntravel at different speeds and very selectively.9 The individual has limited cognitive\ncapacities and only a minute and constantly diminishing share of all knowledge\nworldwide (see the Chap. 7 by Stehr in this volume). Even if the individual pos-\nsesses the cognitive capacities to specialize in a certain field, it takes years and\nincurs great cost for that person to acquire such knowledge, educational achieve-\nment, and expertise.\nFor decades, traditional rational choice theory and instrumental rational action\nmodels focused on a peculiarly rational and omniscient type of person who has or\neasily gains access to all the knowledge, skills, and expertise needed in order to\nmake rational decisions and achieve his or her goals.10 Most adherents of these theo-\nries have ignored or suppressed the fact that people differ in their cognitive capaci-\nties, level of knowledge, professional experience, and skills, not to mention their\nlevel of education.11 A number of authors writing about rational choice theory\n9 Mobilities of knowledge are the topic of volume 10 in this series.\n10 \u201cNeoclassical economics typically employs the assumption of perfect rationality\u2026Rational\nactors never fail to find the action that maximizes their utility, even if this requires unlimited\ncapacities to process and memorize all information available and to have unlimited foresight of the\nconsequences of all available courses of actions in a distant future\u201d (Flache & Dijkstra, 2015,\np. 907). Empirical evidence shows that people have limited and unequal information-processing\nand computational capabilities. These findings have led to various models of bounded rationality\n(Simon, 1956, 1982, 1990).\n11 Professionals, scientists, engineers, and other experts must study many years to acquire the task-\nrelated or goal-relevant knowledge they need for their problem-solving and decision-making.\nMuch of this knowledge and expertise can be learned only in specific institutions of higher educa-\ntion. It is therefore difficult to understand why differences in the level of educational achievement\nplay but a marginal role in action theory and rational choice theories. 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 9\n(e.g., Buskens, 2015; Radner, 2015) simply altogether avoid using categories such\nas knowledge, skills, expertise, and educational achievement.\nAnother weakness of traditional rational choice theory is the fact that r ationality\u2014\nconventionally understood to be a method of thinking and logical consistency\u2014has\nlittle explanatory power. The concept of rational behavior focuses on a person\u2019s\nstrategic choice of the best means to achieve a certain goal, but it does not include\nconsideration of the goal\u2019s reasonableness and attainability or of the resources\nneeded in order to pursue the goal.\n[F]ormal logic is concerned with the rules for drawing conclusions from evidence with\ncertainty. That is, it is concerned only with inference. It says nothing about how evidence is,\nor should be, obtained. Formal logic, therefore, cannot be a complete theory of thinking.\n(Baron, 2008, p. 81)\nIn decision-making and goal-oriented social action, formal logic must be combined with\nknowledge, expertise, skills, and the newest information. Because actors differ in their\nlevels of information, knowledge, skills, experience, and educational achievement, they\narrive at very different decisions if they follow the principle of rational decision-making.\nWhat seems rational to an agent who has little expertise and relies on public information\nmight be irrational to an actor with great expertise or to a stock broker with insider\nknowledge. \u201c[A] given act may appear rational at the time it is undertaken; yet when a\ndifferent goal is activated to which that act was detrimental it may appear irrational and\none might come to regret it\u201d (Kruglanski & Orehek, 2009, p. 647). High levels of knowl-\nedge, skill, expertise, and early access to important information help people come to\ndecisions that are apt to achieve the desired goal. Gaps in expertise, skills, educational\nachievement, and information usually restrict goal attainment.12\nLike any goal-directed activity, thinking can be done well or badly. Thinking that is done\nwell is thinking of the sort that achieves its goals. When we criticize people\u2019s thinking, we\nare trying to help them achieve their own goals. When we try to think well, it is because we\nwant to achieve our goals. (Baron, 2008, p. 29)\nMax Weber (1922/1980), who first made rationality a key concept in modernistic\nthinking, was interested in the fact that rationality created a culture of objectification\n(Versachlichung) and relegated myths, superstition, and unjustified beliefs to the\nbackground. He used the term specifically in the sense of economic rationality that\ndenotes the strategic choice of the best means to reach a given goal. However,\nWeber\u2019s concept of rationality was later extended to fields where it was not appropri-\nate. Max Weber never asserted that rationality alone will help define expedient and\nachievable goals, that rational agents are capable of recognizing the value and the\nutility of their goals, or that rational behavior will trigger creativity and innovation.\nAspects of space and spatial contexts did not play a particular role in the debates\nmentioned above, but they were highlighted by debates around nonrational theories.\nSince the late 1990s, nonrational theories, concepts of ecological rationality, geog-\nraphies of science, and other fields of social geography have developed a growing\nsensitivity for the significance of spatial contexts, spatial relations, environments,\n12 This observation is even more relevant for social systems than for individual decision-makers. 10 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nand contact fields for learning processes, knowledge production, decision-making,\nand innovation. They have emphasized that learning processes are intrinsically\ninterwoven with conceptions of space (see the Chap. 12 by Gardenf\u00f6rs in this\nvolume).\nRecent Developments in Decision-Making Theories\nand Geographies of Science: Improvements\nin the Understanding of Relations Between Knowledge, Action,\nand Space\nIn proposing to use theories of heuristics13 and nonrational tools, Gigerenzer and his\ncollaborators have introduced a concept they call ecological rationality (Gigerenzer\n& Gaissmaier, 2011; 2015; Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001; Goldstein & Gigerenzer,\n2002; Samuels & Stich, 2015; Todd, Gigerenzer, & ABC Research Group, 2012).\nUnlike rational choice theories, heuristic theories of decision-making are concerned\nwith psychological realism relating to the capacities and limitations of actual\nhumans and emphasize the importance of a specific context, frame, or environment\nand focus on the performance of actors in the external physical and social world\n(Buskens, 2015, p. 903; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, pp. 911\u2013912; Hertwig &\nHerzog, 2009; Lindenberg, 2013; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000).\nIn a world where not all risks are known and where optimization is not feasible, \u2018nonra-\ntional\u2019 tools such as heuristics are needed\u2026[N]onrational theories apply to \u2018decision-\nmaking under uncertainty,\u2019 where not all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are\nknown or knowable\u2026Rational theories, in contrast, are tailored to situations where all risks\nare known. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 911)\nThe study of the ecological rationality of heuristics,14 or strategies in general, is a frame-\nwork to study performance in the external world: A heuristic is ecologically rational to the\ndegree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are \u2018domain-specific\u2019\nrather than \u2018domain-general\u2019; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are\necologically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of\ndomain-specific mechanisms\u2026, and have been referred to collectively as the \u2018adaptive tool-\nbox\u2019. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912)\n13 \u201cA heuristic is not per se rational or irrational; rather, its rationality depends on the match\nbetween the architecture of the tool and the structure of the environment in which it is employed\u201d\n(Hertwig & Herzog, 2009, p. 668). \u201cAn inferential or judgmental strategy is ecologically rational\nif it is accurate and efficient on the sorts of tasks that were important in the environments in which\nwe evolved\u201d (Samuels & Stich, 2015, p. 722).\n14 \u201cA heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions\nmore accurately, quickly, and frugally (i.e., with fewer pieces of information) compared to more\ncomplex methods\u201d (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 913). \u201cA heuristic is ecologically rational\nto the degree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are \u2018domain-specific\u2019\nrather than \u2018domain-general\u2019; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are eco-\nlogically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of domain-specific\nmechanisms\u201d (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912). 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 11\nThe heuristic approach to decision-making and the concept of ecological ratio-\nnality are very similar to concepts used by geographies of knowledge and science\n(Livingstone, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003; Meusburger, 1998, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c).\nThey not only respect the view that human cognitive abilities are unequal because\nof different experience and learning processes, but\u2014like the geography of knowl-\nedge\u2014also take the environment\u2019s information structure and knowledge milieu into\naccount. They accept that both the formulation of goals and the processes of\ninformation-p rocessing, learning, research, and decision-making can be somewhat\nshaped by their social environment (Flache & Dijkstra, 2015, pp. 908, 911;\nMeusburger, 2015a).\nDepending on the prior knowledge and experience of actors, a physical and\nsocial environment can play the role of an external storage space of information that\nmay trigger associations and send cues to the informed agent. People, pictures,\ntraces, patterns, institutions, and written sources can help overcome the limitations\nof human memories and cognitive capacities, including the time and effort needed\nto acquire specific forms of knowledge and expertise (Baron, 2008, p. 15). Structures\nand dynamics of environments also affect how people seek out information (Navarro,\nNewell, & Schulze, 2016, p. 45) and which kind of bias they must cope with in their\nsearch (Fiedler & W\u00e4nke, 2009).\nTwo categories\u2014recognition-based heuristics15 and one-clever-cue heuris-\ntics16\u2014closely resemble a concept used in the geography of knowledge, prior\nknowledge. The term Vorwissen (translated in this chapter as prior knowledge)\ndraws on the hermeneutic circle and Gadamer\u2019s (1960/1999) term Vorverst\u00e4ndnis\n(prior understanding, pp. 250, 275).17\nPrior knowledge accrues through learning and experience, includes intuition and\nlatent subconscious experience, and is domain specific. Optimal search for\npossibilities, evidence, new goals, and \u201cactively open-minded thinking\u201d (Baron\n2008, p. 63, italics in the original) need a superior level of prior knowledge. Prior\nknowledge determines whether and how available information is perceived, ana-\nlyzed, and evaluated by an actor and whether it enters and broadens that person\u2019s\nbody of knowledge.18 Prior knowledge helps one select the most meaningful cues\nand has an impact on how patterns and cues are interpreted. Bushmen (San) in the\n15 The goal of recognition-based heuristics is to \u201cmake inferences about a criterion that is not\ndirectly accessible to the decision-maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory\u201d\n(Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 914).\n16 One-clever-cue heuristics looks for only one \u2018clever\u2019 cue and bases its decision on that cue alone\n(Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 914).\n17 Prior knowledge and prior understanding are synonymous in the hermeneutic method. The\nmethod entails a paradox in the sense that what is to be understood somehow has to have been\nunderstood beforehand. Gadamer also calls it positive prejudgment (hence the terms Vorwissen\nand Vorverst\u00e4ndnis). To have prior knowledge or prior understanding of something, one has to\nhave already understood individual parts or aspects of it. This requisite is also called the hermeneu-\ntic circle. Philosophers preceding Gadamer also thought about this circle.\n18 The concept of prior knowledge plays an important role in the communication of various catego-\nries of knowledge (for details see Meusburger, 2017). 12 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nKalahari are able to sleuth animals like nobody else. Experienced doctors can diag-\nnose a disease by interpreting a few signs (students of medicine may not have this\nability yet). Geographers who are specialists in a certain field of knowledge may\ndraw path- breaking conclusions from a thematic map, whereas other persons will\nglean no information at all from the same map. Local people living in the Alps may\nhave acquired enough knowledge from previous generations or from personal expe-\nrience to recognize from scant, subtle indications which places may be endangered\nby avalanches; most tourists will not be able to evaluate these risks. Many culturally\ntransmitted bodies of knowledge are learned through observation of19 important\nenvironmental cues. In fact, observing and interpreting cues and spatial configura-\ntions is a long-standing heuristic device of geography.\nHumans are susceptible to social influence and to the type of information that is\navailable in their environment. Geographies of knowledge and science have illus-\ntrated how learning processes, research, and scientific careers can be influenced by\nthe local availability of role models, resources, specific thought styles,20 face-to-\nface contacts to prominent scholars, institutional logics, and organizational rules.\nThe interrelationships of these factors and others constitute the knowledge environ-\nment of a place (for details see Meusburger, 2008, 2015a; Meusburger & Schuch,\n2012). An extreme example of the impact that different informational environments\nhave on decision-making and acting is given by Gregory (2015, pp. 113\u2013114).\nDescribing World War I battlefields at the western front and the differences between\na paper war and a trench war,21 he illustrates the insurmountable gulf between the\nexperienced knowledge of the infantry in the muddy trenches of the battlefield and\nthe abstract knowledge of the staff officers surrounding the map table in a comfort-\nable room and planning the movements of their soldiers for the next days.\nScientific evidence from cognitive psychology (see the Chap. 6 by Funke in this\nvolume), sociology (Stehr, 1994, 2005), social geography (Meusburger, 2015a,\n2015c; Werlen, 1993b, pp. 8\u201311), and other research fields shows that there is no\ndirect if\u2013then relation between knowledge and action. There are a number of\nintervening variables\u2014many of them related to the environment or place of action\u2014\nthat may modify, weaken, or strengthen the relations between knowledge and action.\nThe concurrence and coaction of these variables at a certain place or in a specific\narea build a spatial context, social environment, or knowledge milieu that may affect\ndecision-making and action. As pointed out by Fiedler and W\u00e4nke (2009, p. 699),\nproperties of the environment can constrain or enhance the input to cognitive pro-\ncesses. These two researchers illustrate that error and bias may often originate in the\ninformation environment, in selective accessibility to information; that observations\n19 Learning by observing \u201cincludes all cases in which we learn about our environment from obser-\nvation alone, without intentional experimentation\u201d (Baron, 2008, p. 14).\n20 \u201cThe greater the difference between two thought styles, the more inhibited will be the communi-\ncation of ideas\u201d (Fleck, 1935/1979, p. 109).\n21 \u201cTrench war is an environment that can never be known abstractly or from the outside. Onlookers\ncould never understand a reality that must be crawled through and lived in. This life, in turn, equips\nthe inhabitant with a knowledge that is difficult to generalize or explain\u201d (Leed, 1981, p. 79). 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 13\ncan be influenced by environmental sampling; and that agents\u2014in their capacity as\navailable sources of information\u2014may lack first-hand experience, overdo some\nrisks, and neglect others. In brief, \u201ccognitive processes are fed with an environmen-\ntal input that is itself often biased and highly selective\u201d (p. 700).\nTalent, motivation, and wealth of ideas are not the only characteristics determin-\ning how successfully a scholar\u2019s research and academic career develops (Meusburger,\n2015a). What we academics call creative is never the result of individual action\nalone. Learning processes and actions are situated in environments, organizational\nstructures, and spatial relations. We cannot study scientific creativity by isolating\nscholars and their works from the social and historical milieu in which their actions\nare carried out. The key issue is the interaction with the environment. It is well\nknown from creativity studies that a stimulating environment and a talented indi-\nvidual must come together and interact before a creative process can occur (for\ndetails see Amabile et al., 1990, 1996; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988, 1999; Hennessey &\nAmabile, 1988; Meusburger, 2009; Sternberg & Lubart, 1999).\nAn environment\u2019s impacts on action must not be regarded deterministically. An\nenvironment should not be thought of as an independent variable that directly influ-\nences all relevant actors through a direct cause-and-effect relation (if A, then B). It\ndepends on processes of evaluation based on learning, knowledge, and experience\nwhether spatial structures, physical space, or social environments have an impact on\nhuman action.\nA knowledge environment is a locally available potential or a local range of resources. It\nstands for incentives, challenges, stimulations, opportunities, and support networks that can\nbe used, overlooked, or ignored. A knowledge environment can operate as it should only if\nthe actors involved use the local resources and interact with each other. The outcomes of\nhuman interactions and experiences in life are always indeterminate. No one can predict the\nresults of appropriation and interaction, whether and how often the local potential for inte-\ngrating diverse viewpoints and knowledge bases will be activated, and how the relation-\nships between creative agents will develop. Therefore, a knowledge environment\u2019s\nsignificance and effect can be analyzed only after events have taken place, after the scien-\ntific careers and research results associated with that environment have become evident.\n(Meusburger, 2015a, pp. 266\u2013267)\nCollective Action\nOrganizations, institutions, and other power structures are an environment\u2019s most\nefficient elements for enhancing or impeding the conversion of a person\u2019s knowl-\nedge into action. Without the support of institutions, most decision-makers cannot\nreach their goals (Meusburger, 1999, 2015a; Werlen, 1995, pp. 40\u201349). When study-\ning the relations of knowledge and action in social systems, organizations, or insti-\ntutions, one must take additional aspects into account (some of them are discussed\nin the Chap. 11 by Reitz; others, in volumes 6 and 7 of this series). As Goldman\n(2004) states, epistemic organizations need nodal points where information con-\nverges and theoretical conclusions are arrived at. But any organization has at least 14 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\ntwo problems to cope with. First, the knowledge and experience necessary for solv-\ning a problem or making the right decisions to achieve a certain goal may be avail-\nable somewhere in an organization, but it may not reach the people authorized to act\non it. Second, the nodal points or authorized decision-makers may not have the prior\nknowledge, experience, and intuition necessary to understand and evaluate the\nimportance of information that has been forwarded to them. Those who decide often\nnot understand those who know. And those who know are often experts in narrow\ndomains only or are not close to those in power.\nWeber\u2019s (1922/1980) ideal bureaucracy rested on the principles of meritocracy\nand the absence of nepotism and incompetence. In that system the hierarchy of\ndecision-making corresponded to a hierarchy of competence. High-ranking\ndecision- makers were expected to have broader expertise and more experience than\ntheir subordinates; the superiors would at least be able to understand, evaluate, and\nembrace the information forwarded to them. In large and complex organizations, it\nhappens quite frequently that line managers (immediate superiors) have achieved\ntheir position because of merits other than broad knowledge and expertise in a cer-\ntain domain. In some political systems, ideological reliability and loyalty to a politi-\ncal party, ethnic group, or powerful network counts for more than expertise does\nwhen it comes to promotion to a high post. Even if managers understand the rele-\nvance and urgency of information, they may fail to draw the necessary practical\nconsequences because they are indebted to a political party or a powerful person or\nare under pressure from their social environment.\nOrganization theory, especially the research field following the tradition of\nMintzberg (1979), and the geography of knowledge have an abiding interest in the\norganization and coordination of social systems in space and in the spatial concen-\ntration of jobs involving high levels of educational achievement and decision-\nmaking. Originally, region meant a space that was organized, coordinated,\ncontrolled, and influenced by a power center or a social system\u2019s authority (for\ndetails see Berthoin Antal, Meusburger, & Suarsana, 2014; Gottmann, 1980;\nMeusburger et al., 2015). Organization theory and the geography of knowledge\nhave documented how the structure of a social system\u2014the centralization or decen-\ntralization of decision-making authority, skills, and competence within an organiza-\ntion\u2014varies with the complexity of its tasks and the uncertainty of its environment.\nIn summary, a number of research fields have underlined the importance of an envi-\nronment or spatial context and its possible impact on individual and collective\naction, but their strands of argumentation have seldom coalesced.\nAims, Claims, and Content of this Volume\nA main intention of this volume is to raise awareness of important research issues\nthat various disciplines have brought into the field of knowledge, action, and space\nto define research gaps and misunderstandings and, if possible, to build bridges 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 15\nbetween diverse theoretical approaches. For this purpose we editors have selected a\nbroad range of topics and various scales of analysis. More than a dozen disciplines\ndo research on knowledge, learning, education, innovation, and creativity. Even a\nglance at the definitions and concepts of knowledge used in different disciplines22\ndocuments the necessity of looking beyond the fence of one\u2019s own subject and\navoiding monodisciplinary lists of references. Even if some of the approaches ini-\ntially seem mutually incompatible, a synopsis of the relevant research from a variety\ndisciplines can help improve the understanding of the links between knowledge,\naction, and space and can prompt new research questions.\nThis volume brings together a broad range of theoretical approaches delving into\nknowledge, action, and space from different angles. Some of the contributors dis-\ncuss knowledge as a social construct based on collective action, on socially embed-\nded and guiding social action. Others look at knowledge as an individual capacity to\nact. The breadth of studies ranges from the role of knowledge in individual action to\nits role in collective action, from knowledge and action in the hunter\u2013gatherer soci-\nety to knowledge production in financial capitalism. The discussion of concepts and\ntheories of knowledge touches on topics such as semantic knowledge and its orga-\nnization into domains, asymmetrical knowledge and the polarization of knowledge\nand nonknowledge, knowledge and collective action,23 situated problem-solving,\nspatial dispersion of knowledge, knowledge and planning, and expertise as a link\nbetween knowledge and practical action.\nIn the chapter following this introduction, Benno Werlen describes the long path\ngeographers had to follow before they arrived at concepts of space suitable for\nissues of social geography. Until the late 1990s, the theoretical concepts in many\nfields of human geography diverted attention from the key role that the social\ndimension plays in the construction of meaningful geographical realities.24\nWerlen identifies the reasons for the current failure of the spatial turn in the\nsocial sciences and offers an action-centered approach to developing a constructiv-\nist geography for the digital age. His contribution includes a specific, action-related,\nand action-compatible theory of space that can also take account of different con-\ncepts of space for different types of action. In this conceptualization of space, the\nspatial dimension of action and society is related to the corporeality of the actors\nand to the necessity of overcoming distances between actors and the physical ele-\nments of situations and means of action. Because the actor\u2019s body is simultaneously\n22 For an overview of different concepts and definitions of knowledge, see Abel (2008), Meusburger\n(2015c), Stehr (1994, 2005), Stehr and Meja (2005), and Reitz (Chap. 11 in this volume). Reitz\ndistinguishes between knowledge as a systematic set of applicable recipes, knowledge as an orga-\nnized body of theoretical statements, and knowledge as a developed capacity for situated\nproblem-solving.\n23 The role of knowledge in organizations was the focus of volume 6 in this series (Berthoin Antal\net al., 2014) and will be discussed in volumes 11 and 13 as well.\n24 The hitherto most convincing theoretical way to integrate the spatial dimension into the field of\naction research is also the narrowest and is of only limited use in social and cultural studies\u2014that\nis, embedding metric space in locational decision-making theory applied to action models based\non rational choice. 16 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nthe key criterion for distinguishing between direct and mediated experiences and\nbetween face-to-face and mediated communication, the three main foci of this\nbook\u2014action, knowledge, and space\u2014are conceptualized in a new framework, the\nsocially constructed relations of space.\nThe geographer Huib Ernste illustrates in his chapter that the divorce of rational-\nity and reason during the philosophical development of modernity led to recognition\nof different types of rationality, each with its own logics of deliberation and argu-\nmentation. Poststructuralists emphasize that each rationality contains multiple para-\ndigms, each establishing its own set of principles, institutions, and lines of conflict\nthat need to be taken into account. He demonstrates how these views are intricately\ninvolved in late-modern geographical theories of action and in language-pragmatic\napproaches25 in geography.\nProponents of poststructuralist approaches emphasize the structural aspects of\ndiscourse, especially power structures. Laclau and Mouffe (1985), by contrast, try\nto retain and restore the possibility of deliberative interventions in these discursive\nstructures by inverting Foucault\u2019s power/knowledge equation. Ernste explores the\nextent to which this inversion reinstates responsible and rational spatial decisions\nand actions as a focus of research in human geography. In his view rationality could\nbe reconstituted as a culturally contingent phenomenon, and critical geographical\nanalysis could again contribute to concrete problem-solving, albeit in a culturally\nmuch more informed and embedded way than hitherto. Ernste also discusses geo-\ngraphical action theory as put forward by Werlen (1987, 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1997,\n2010a, 2010b, 2013, 2015; see also Werlen\u2019s Chap. 2 in this volume) in the phenom-\nenological tradition of Sch\u00fctz (1932). According to that school of thought, the inter-\nnal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes meanings to these\nobjects, as people do through their everyday place-making and everyday spatially\ndifferentiated actions. Ernste interprets this geographic action theory as the\nsubjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny (2001) and\nReckwitz (2002) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory. This\napproach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems from\nclassical structuralism.\nErnste shows that the advent of poststructuralist thinking ushered in a great\nreluctance to conceptualize human behavior as conscious rational actions and that\nthe term action is generally avoided in most poststructuralist literature. Talking\nabout practice instead of action indeed amounts to a novel picture of human agency\nand rationality (Reckwitz, 2008, p. 98). In contrast to Benno Werlen, with his sub-\njective, meaning-oriented approach to geographical action theory, and unlike\nZierhofer (2002), who advocated the language-pragmatic approach in geography,\npoststructuralist thinkers do not tend to place structures inside the mind or in prag-\nmatic procedures of interaction but rather \u201coutside\u201d both\u2014in chains of signs, in\nsymbols, discourse, or text.\n25 Pragmatics is \u201ca branch of linguistics dealing with language in its situational context, including\nthe knowledge and beliefs of the speaker and the relationship and interaction between speaker and\nlistener\u201d (\u201cPragmatics,\u201d 2010). 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 17\nIdeologies of urban and regional planning have a powerful effect on human\nactions. But to what extent can social behavior be influenced or even determined by\nplanning concepts? How can one explain the gap between intention and behavior?\nThe geographer Gunnar Olsson describes the ideology of social engineering that\npredominated in Sweden in the 1950s and early 1960s, principles intended to forge\na happy marriage between scientific knowledge and political action. As the affinities\nbetween totalitarian thinking and social engineering are impossible to deny, Olsson\nstarts his narrative with the role that central place theory and location theory played\nin Nazi Germany. Christaller (1933) and L\u00f6sch (1943/1954) were seeking a scien-\ntific method to colonize or settle a given area, especially how a set of hierarchically\nnested and hexagonally distributed centers should be tied together into a functional\nwhole.\nIn the thought style of location theory, regional science, positivist thinking, spa-\ntial models, and social engineering, it is necessary to describe the functioning of\nsociety by mathematical calculations. In the 1950s and 1960s politically anchored\nexperts took it as their mission to turn Sweden into a People\u2019s Home, a state of\nrationality in which the maximizing principles of utilitarian ethics were institution-\nalized. Their intention was to capture the power of social relations in a net of scien-\ntific laws (e.g., the social gravity model) and to acquire the means for understanding\nthe world and for changing it as well. The history of the social gravity model in\nregional science and of quantitative geography provides an excellent example of the\nups and downs of theoretical concepts. At first the model was treated as a formula-\ntion of great explanatory power; subsequent generations have come to see it as an\nexpression of autocorrelation. To demonstrate power-and-knowledge relations in\nthe form of a self-referential presentation, Olsson discusses the sculpture Mappa\nMundi Universalis, conceived and designed by himself and Ole Michael Jensen and\nexhibited in the Museum Gustavianum in Uppsala, Sweden.\nA Marxist view on relations between knowledge, action, and space is presented\nby the geographer Richard Peet. Viewing knowledge production from a global scale,\nhe analyzes the role of expertise26 in financial institutions, which are now the domi-\nnant economic institutions in capitalist societies. Following Marx and Gramsci, he\nstates that knowledge production serves a class interest and that class forces lead,\ndirect, and control the production of knowledge. What matters in the making of his-\ntory are the broad social and cultural trends in thought, imagination, and compre-\nhension, such as political-economic-cultural ideas.\nHe calls the production of sophisticated, but inimical, knowledge in the financial\nsystem perverse expertise. In this expertise some of the world\u2019s finest minds, such\nas professional economists, do the intellectual and practical modeling and are well\npaid and respected for doing so. But they accumulate knowledge in order to con-\ntinue augmenting the incomes of already wealthy people, the capitalist class. In\nPeet\u2019s view, critical mass reaction to financial crisis or the pending world environ-\nmental catastrophe is prevented by hegemonic control over imaginaries by a combi-\n26 Peet (Chap. 5) defines expertise as high-quality, specialized, theoretical, and practical knowledge\nand regards it as the junction of knowledge and action. 18 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nnation of perverse expertise and mass social unconsciousness. The elites practice\nperverse expertise, and the masses lose their capacity to think rationally and respond\nunconsciously. Peet\u2019s conclusion is that the intersecting economic and environmen-\ntal crises will continue ad infinitum because the existing hegemonic knowledge can-\nnot guide effective social action. Although investor confidence is presented by the\nbusiness media as a neutral, technical, and necessary factor\u2014in everyone\u2019s best\nlong-term interest\u2014it is actually a committed, financial capitalist interest based on\nutterly biased knowledge. An instructive example is the global bond market. The\ninterest paid on sovereign bonds is determined by the risk of default, with experts\nemploying formulae stemming from long experience measured statistically\u2014appar-\nently scientific and necessary. Yet it is actually a few thousand experts representing\nthe interests of accumulated capital who tell governments how to run their\neconomies.\nThe next seven chapters focus on the microscale of analysis and discuss con-\ncepts, definitions, and research results from philosophy, psychology, and sociology.\nPsychologist Joachim Funke starts his contribution with three questions: How much\nknowledge is necessary for action? Is action possible without knowledge? Why do\npeople sometimes act against their knowledge? He discusses some of the standard\nviews on the relation between knowledge and action, specifically, the theory of\nplanned behavior, the theory of unconscious thought, and the option-generation\nframework. He illustrates the delicate relation between knowledge and action with\nan example from problem-solving research. In Funke\u2019s understanding, problem-\nsolving means the intentional generation of knowledge for action instead of simple\ntrial-and-error behavior. His studies on the MicroDYN approach, which was used in\nthe 2012 cycle of the worldwide PISA study, demonstrate the existence of a clear\nconnection between the generation of knowledge and action (i.e., application of that\nknowledge). From the angle of a problem-solving approach, the connection between\nknowledge and action is a classical means\u2013end relation. It is not possible to act\nwithout knowledge, but people can act against their knowledge.\nNico Stehr, a sociologist of science, offers a sociological critique of the prevalent\nargument that the increasing polarization of knowledge and nonknowledge (or igno-\nrance) has become a distinguishing feature of modernity. He acknowledges that\nsignificant asymmetries of knowledge exist and that knowledge gaps are growing,\nbut he rejects the interpretation that nonknowledge is the opposite of knowledge.\nSeeking to avoid that either\u2013or polarity as an arbitrary, theoretically and empirically\nunproductive antithesis, he posits knowledge instead as a context-dependent anthro-\npological constant representing a continuum. In his view there is only less or more\nknowledge, and there are only those who know something and those who know\nsomething else. The practical problem is always to know how much or how little\none knows in a given situation. From his perspective the key sociological question\nis how to address the issue of knowledge asymmetry and knowledge gaps in various\nspheres of modern society, such as the economy, politics, the life world, and gover-\nnance. He argues that nonknowledge has, in different societal institutions, its own\nfunctional meaning. There are myriad convincing references to the virtues and 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 19\nadvantages of ignorance, a lack or asymmetry of knowledge, and nontransparent\nsituations.\nThe psychologists Ralph Hertwig and Renato Frey address the question of how\ndifferent representations of knowledge shape human actions. Before choosing to\nact, people often try to acquire knowledge about a given situation, opportunities and\nrisks, and possible consequences of their actions. In some cases they can draw on\nconvenient descriptions of actions and their consequences\u2014such as a medicine\u2019s\naccompanying information on possible side effects and their probabilities. People\nthereby make decisions from description. In everyday life, however, there are usu-\nally no actuarial tables of risks to consult. Instead, people make such decisions in\nthe twilight of their sampled\u2014and often limited\u2014experience.\nRecent research in psychology has demonstrated that decisions from description\nand decisions from experience can lead to substantially different choices, especially\nwhere rare events are involved. Studies on modern behavioral decision-making have\ncommonly focused on decisions from description. The observations stemming from\nthis research suggest that humans overestimate and overrate rare events. To improve\nthe understanding of how people make decisions with incomplete and uncertain\ninformation and how people respond to rare events that have severe consequences,\nHertwig and Frey recommend study of the psychology and rationality of people\u2019s\ndecisions from experience. They find that people relying on knowledge from experi-\nence behave as though rare events are attributed less impact than they deserve, rela-\ntive to their objective probabilities. These two researchers review the literature on\nthis gap between description and experience and consider its potential causes and\nexplanations, arguing that research on description-based behavior should not be\nplayed off against research on experience-based behavior, that the contrast between\nthe two types is enlightening. These observations are not contradictory; they\ndescribe how the mind functions in two different informational environments.\nIn recent years many psychologists have proposed that action (social behavior) is\naffected by two interacting systems\u2014the reflective system and the impulsive sys-\ntem\u2014that are operating according to different principles (for an overview of the\nliterature, see Smith & DeCoster, 2000; Strack & Deutsch, 2004, 2007). \u201cThe\nreflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about\nfacts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative\nlinks and motivational orientations\u201d (Strack & Deutsch, 2004, p. 220). The psy-\nchologists Anand Krishna and Fritz Strack focus in their chapter on the striking\nduality of (a) actions planned with reflective, deliberate thought and (b) actions\ncaused by spontaneous impulses. First separately evaluating the characteristics of\nreflective and impulsive styles of thinking, Krishna and Strack find that the reflec-\ntive system operates according to propositional principles; it is flexible, it requires\neffort and motivation, and its operation is typically conscious. The impulsive system\noperates according to associative principles; it is inflexible, effortless, always active,\nand capable of operating unconsciously.\nBuilding on existing theories of rational thought as well as impulse, impulse\ncontrol, and implicit attitudes, the authors propose an integrative model of thinking\nand action\u2014the reflective-impulsive model (RIM)\u2014to show when which system of 20 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nthought will be active and under what circumstances they will influence behavior.\nThe rational and rule-based reflective system is slow and driven by working mem-\nory capacities and arousal, which set limits for its ability to process information.\nThe impulsive system can be thought of as long-term memory and therefore has\nfunctionally unlimited capacity.\nIn their RIM model Krishna and Strack describe how the reflective and impulsive\nsystems interact during the process of thought. When the reflective system operates,\nit operates in parallel with the impulsive system, not in place of it. When a reflective\noperation begins, perceptual input has already activated several associative ele-\nments. The purpose of the RIM is to provide an answer to the central question of\nhow the two mental processes are linked to behavior and especially how they inter-\nact through behavioral schemata.\nThe psychologists Frank Wieber and Peter M. Gollwitzer examine the role that\nspontaneous and strategic planning have in turning an individual\u2019s knowledge into\naction. They point out that knowing which goal one intends to pursue and commit-\nting oneself to that goal are only the first step toward successful goal attainment.\nPlanning when, where, and how to act with implementation intentions27 has proven\nto be an effective self-regulation strategy for reducing the intention\u2013behavior gap.\nThe authors introduce specific if\u2013then plans for when, where, and how to act, and\nthey discuss how such implementation intentions support goal attainment.\nThey highlight the importance that the accessibility of goal-relevant knowledge\nhas for spontaneously formed implementation intentions. As for strategically\nformed implementation intentions, they point to the importance of systematically\nselecting goal-relevant knowledge and translating it into implementation intentions\nby using the self-regulation strategy called Mental Contrasting with Implementation\nIntentions. The authors discuss the interplay of automatic and reflective processes\nand suggest that strategically planning the automatic activation of goal-relevant\nknowledge can support reflective decision-making and goal-directed actions through\nuse of context-sensitive reminders. Goal systems are introduced as a conceptual\nframework because they address the question of how goals can increase the acces-\nsibility of knowledge about when, where, and how to pursue the goal.\nThe authors discuss a recent experimental study suggesting that such strategic\nplanning is very useful in unstructured situational contexts that require identifica-\ntion and selection of appropriate goal-relevant knowledge. They further suggest that\nstrategic planning is less useful in structured situational contexts that prompt goal-\ndirected actions without requiring any knowledge about advantageous opportunities\nto act and about potential obstacles. One of their main findings is that combining\nmental contrasting and implementation intentions in order to extend planning has\nproven more effective than either mental contrasting or implementation intentions\nalone.\nTwo chapters present a philosophical perspective on knowledge and action.\nPhilosopher Tilman Reitz gives an overview of the broad range of philosophical\n27 Implementation intentions refer to specific plans in which individuals and groups can, by using\nan if\u2013then format, specify when, where, and how they intend to act. 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 21\npositions on the essence of knowledge. He argues that the social sciences largely\nlack a well-considered definition of knowledge, whereas philosophical debates\nabout such a definition usually fail to include discussion of the social constitution of\nknowledge. In his view both approaches have overlooked or repressed a theoretical\nchallenge: the spatial dispersion of social knowledge. He presents a concept of\nknowledge that is both philosophically transparent and empirically helpful for\nunderstanding basic structures of the knowledge society. Following a pragmatic\nepistemology, he is interested in the question of which understanding of knowledge\nmakes sense in what kind of everyday circumstances. In his view the nature of\nknowledge also depends on its social organization. Do people talk about the knowl-\nedge of individuals, of collectives, or rather of knowledge incorporated in a set of\nrules? He is interested in changes in the organization and dispersion of epistemic\npractices and in delocalized and resituated knowledge in the digital information age,\nwhen new information technologies will have huge practical and epistemic effects.\nEncoded information or data can be automatically processed without the interven-\ntion of human agents. Stock market programs buy and sell shares, police software\nidentifies dangerous persons, and semantic tools browse scientific data bases. Such\noperations involve neither beliefs nor truth and justification; no emotion, prejudice,\nor thought style interferes with them. But they trigger a number of new problems\nand new research questions.\nThe philosopher Peter Gardenf\u00f6rs, in support of his central hypothesis that\nsemantic knowledge is organized into domains, presents a model of domain- oriented\nlanguage acquisition. He defines a domain as a set of integral dimensions separable\nfrom all other dimensions. Basic domains are cognitively irreducible representa-\ntional spaces or fields of conceptual potential. The author proposes conceptual\nspaces as appropriate tools for modeling the semantics of natural language. A con-\nceptual space is defined by a number of perception-based quality dimensions that\nrepresent perceived similarity.\nHe offers linguistic evidence for the hypothesis that it becomes easier to learn\nnew words within in a domain once it has been established. During the first formative\nyears of life, a child acquires semantic knowledge prior to syntactic knowledge.\nOnce the child has learned a word designating a color, for instance, other color\nwords will be learned soon after. It is easier to explain to a 4-year-old the meaning\nof the color term mauve than to explain abstract monetary terms like inflation that\nare not yet within the child\u2019s semantic reach. The author explains why grasping a\nnew domain is a cognitively much more difficult step than adding new terms to an\nalready established domain.\nA central hypothesis of Gardenf\u00f6rs\u2019s chapter is that many of these domains are\nclosely connected to the development of intersubjectivity. The author defines inter-\nsubjectivity as \u201cthe sharing and representing of others\u2019 mentality.\u201d If somebody\nshares the emotions, attention, desires, intentions, beliefs, and knowledge of others,\nthe exchange of knowledge is relatively unproblematic.\nAriane Berthoin Antal and Victor Friedman\u2014both experts on organizational\nlearning with an interest in artistic intervention\u2014investigate the relationship\nbetween physical space and processes of creative thinking and action. They point 22 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nout that the importance of bodily ways of knowing has long been obvious to artists\nand neuroscientists but that organizational researchers misplaced corporeality for\nmany years and have only recently begun to retrieve it by drawing on notions of\naesthetics. The aesthetic approach to studying human behavior can reveal the roles\nthe body plays in reading a context. The authors argue that connecting aesthetic\napproaches to the analysis of the construction of social space enriches the under-\nstanding of the relational processes of generating shared meaning and agreeing on\nhow to behave in the current situation. They stress that people use all their senses to\nseek cues to make sense of and orient their behavior and that the body thereby also\nparticipates in deciding and signaling to others which rules of the game to adopt for\nthe situation at hand (Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007).\nThis study was set in a region characterized by chronic socioeconomic underde-\nvelopment and deep intergroup divisions, especially between Jews and Palestinian\nArabs. Berthoin Antal and Friedman were interested in promoting a process in\nwhich people could (a) bring up problems, ideas, and visions, (b) meet others with\nwhom to learn and to collaborate on issues of common concern, (c) work together\nto create innovative, viable projects and enterprises to meet human and economic\nneeds, and (d) create and enact shared visions of regional development that pro-\nmotes inclusiveness and interdependence rather than competition and divisiveness.\nIn a series of videorecorded action experiments28 conducted in a fine-arts studio, the\ntwo researchers asked the participants to think about how they would use the space\nof the studio to combine processes of social entrepreneurship, conflict engagement,\nand the arts in ways that would connect the college with the community and contrib-\nute to regional development.\nThe analysis of the video recordings illustrates how physical space becomes a\npart of social space by entering human perception and then being acted upon and\nshaped by people. The authors identified seven distinct configurations29 of social\nspace that changed over time as the participants engaged in the task. One of the\nstriking outcomes of their video analysis was that commonalities existed across the\nsessions in terms of the knowledge-production processes. The fundamental struc-\ntural similarity of the configurations allows the authors to formulate key insights\ninto the relationships between space, action, and knowledge generation. The study\nconfirms the value of separating visual from verbal analysis.\nThe final two chapters investigate knowledge (cognitive capacities, rationality)\nand mobility in space. Thomas Widlok\u2014a social anthropologist\u2014studies the rela-\ntionship between rationality and action in a hunter\u2013gatherer society. The prime cog-\nnitive challenge in this context is human practical reasoning about movement: the\n28 By the term action experiments they mean having participants develop and actively try out ideas\ntogether in a given space, recording the process, then analyzing it as a basis for ensuing steps.\n29 They use the term configuration in four senses: (a) the participants\u2019 positions in the room and\nrelative to each other during a specific period of time, (b) the observable interactions of the partici-\npants among each other and with materials in the room, (c) the observable application of behav-\nioral rules, and (d) the creation of shared meaning (to the extent it can be inferred from the group\u2019s\nobservable behavior and outputs). The seven configurations they identified were Orientation,\nMeeting Mode, Expansion, Creation, Reflection, Exhibition, and Rehearsal. 1 Knowledge, Action, and Space: An Introduction 23\ndecision to go or to stay. Based on ethnographic work with various groups of mobile\nhunters and gatherers in southern Africa and Australia, the chapter presents an\ninvestigation of rationality and action from the standpoint of human mobility in\nspace. It begins with a critical assessment of probabilistic rational choice models of\nmobility and decision-making and suggests that more promising approaches are\ninformed by work on the pragmatics of dialogues and on abductive reasoning.\nRationality in that view is no longer a purely mental phenomenon, for it is distrib-\nuted across social practice and is partially contained in features of the environment\nthat western philosophy has long dismissed as irrelevant for understanding human\nrationality.\nThe psychologists Heidrun Mollenkopf, Annette Hieber, and Hans-Werner Wahl\ndocument that relations between intention and action (mobility in space) are not\nimmutable in the course of a person\u2019s life cycle. Age, mental and physical handi-\ncaps, personal resources, environmental conditions, and other factors can separate\nactions from intentions. The authors study this issue by interviewing older adults\nabout their out-of-home mobility three times over 10 years. They analyze the sub-\njective meaning of mobility over time; perceived changes in mobility and perceived\nreasons for such change; the course of satisfaction in various mobility domains and\nwith life in general; and interindividual variation. Perceived changes point to expe-\nriences of major loss in the array of mobility and decreasing satisfaction with mobil-\nity possibilities, out-of-home leisure activities, and travel. At the same time, the\nauthors find that satisfaction with public transport is increasing among older adults.\nThe findings of this study confirm that out-of-home mobility remains of utmost\nimportance when people move from late midlife into old age.\nConclusion\nThe chapters in this volume illustrate the enormous breadth of the implications that\nthe spatial dimension has for action, the production and dissemination of knowl-\nedge, the application and understanding of knowledge, and the generation of socio-\ncultural and economic realities. They also reveal the large number of open or\ncontested research questions to be answered by future research. For obvious rea-\nsons, action theory figures prominently in our introduction, but the work presented\nin the following pages indicates how many more theoretical concepts of various\ndisciplines could contribute to improve the understanding of the relations between\nknowledge and space on various scales of analysis.\nFrom a geographical point of view, certain key questions are not discussed in this\nvolume: How are epistemic authority and competencies construed and evaluated in\nnonwestern or acephalous societies in which individuality and rationality are sec-\nondary to collective values? In which way will new digital technologies change the\norganization and coordination of decision-making in complex organizations? To\nwhat extent will new digital technologies change communication, interaction,\nsupervision, knowledge storage, and social-spatial relations? Will these changes 24 P. Meusburger and B. Werlen\nmainly support and strengthen existing power structures or alter them\nsubstantially?\nTaking into account how deeply rooted the spatial dimension is in human exis-\ntence with its manifold facets, we can imagine how deep the social changes will be\nupon implementation of changes in social-spatial relations through digitalization\nand with the subsequent changes in the form of communication, interaction, and\nknowledge storage. It is therefore vitally important to include space in social theory\nin general and in action theory in particular. It looks as though Foucault\u2019s (1984/2002)\nprediction quoted at the outset of this introduction is likely to be confirmed, possi-\nbly even beyond the issues he raised.\nReferences\nAbel, G.

Chapter 2\nAction, Knowledge, and Social Relations\nof Space\nBenno Werlen\nContrary to still well-established understanding, geographical conditions of human\nactions are to be seen from a sociogeographical point of view, that is, primarily as a\nsocial product and only secondarily as a biophysical condition. This ontological\nstatus of the age of anthropocene means that geographical social transformations\nare highly important for all forms of geography-making, which, in turn, are funda-\nmental to social change and transformations. In other words, the constitutive pro-\ncesses of geographical realities are fundamental to a wide range of formative\nprocesses of social and cultural realities.\nTo grasp geographical realities as understandable realities, it is necessary to let\ngo of most received geographical notions, from traditional regionalistic ones and\ncolonial interpretations to present geographical concepts formulated in the after-\nmath of the spatial turn of the social sciences, cultural studies, and the humanities.\nBut this change in perspective is not only scientifically crucial. It is even more so\nwith respect to everyday practices, especially political actions. With the steady\nweakening of all-encompassing forms of national territorialization through the\nDigital Revolution and with the formation of supranational communities, the domi-\nnance of the nation-state in nearly all domains of social life is at stake. Just as the\nterritorial organization of social life replaced feudal logic, the territorial principle\nitself is now at risk in many senses.\nIt is little different when it comes to the interrelation of knowledge and spatial\nconditions. The Digital Revolution\u2014the end of distance for a wide range of human\nactivities, and accelerated social change\u2014is establishing what I call \u201cnew social\nrelations of space.\u201d By that I mean, as elaborated on in this chapter, a new way of\nrelating to preset and spatially distant circumstances that are relevant to one\u2019s action.\nAnd social relations of space have a strong impact on the production, dissemination,\nand incorporation of knowledge and information. Of course, I do not mean that\nB. Werlen (*)\nDepartment of Geography, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany\ne-mail: benno.werlen@uni-jena.de\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017 31\nP. Meusburger et al. (eds.), Knowledge and Action, Knowledge and Space 9,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44588-5_2 32 B. Werlen\nsupranational trends and globalizations are effacing the local and regional.\nGlobalization also accentuates places and regions as distinctive forums of human\naction. In one way or another all human actions remain regionally and locally con-\ntextualized. But to grasp the social significance of spatial constellations, scientific\nresearch has to proceed from social actions and practices to the regional and spatial\nrealm and not vice versa.\nThe Relevance of the Spatial Dimension and the Spatial Turn\nFrom the perspective of geography-making, which begins with the premises that all\nsocially and culturally relevant geographies are constructed realities, the spatial\nconditions and spatial relations of individual actions are fundamental to the forma-\ntion and structuration of social realities. A prime example is the current globaliza-\ntion affecting various aspects of everyday life. Systematic social theories have\nlargely ignored the spatial dimension of social life. The reasons for this omission are\nprofound and require thorough reconstruction of the underlying modes of thought.\nWithout such analysis, one runs the risk of importing the traditional spatial perspec-\ntive into the social sciences and cultural studies. The fact that such uncritical adop-\ntion of the conventional spatial perspective is neither productive nor insightful is\nexemplified by the \u201cspatial,\u201d or \u201cgeographical,\u201d turn in the social sciences, cultural\nstudies, and the humanities (see D\u00f6ring & Thielmann, 2008; Foucault, 1999; Levy,\n1999; G\u00fcnzel, 2009; Schl\u00f6gel, 2002; Soja, 1989; Warf & Arias, 2008).\nThe absence of the spatial dimension in social and cultural theorizing contrasts\nwith the spatial obsession characteristic of early studies in human geography, a field\nthat emerged in the late nineteenth century as a space-centered science applying to\nthe study of human individuals and societies. This orientation and the way of think-\ning underlying it have significant ramifications for geography as an academic disci-\npline and entail problematic political implications.\nTraditional human geography\u2019s rather simplistic focus on space and distance as\ndetermining dimensions of behavior results in an emphasis on the individual as part\nof the human species and neglects his or her capacity to perform social actions,\nwhich is fundamental for the meaningful construction of social and cultural reali-\nties. Arrival at this perspective needed a theoretical and not always successful debate\nlasting more than a century. The insights it has contributed greatly help the current\ndebate about the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences, identify its implica-\ntions (some of which are problematic), and detect its shortcomings on the back-\nground of the history of geographical research.\nObserved from the current theoretical debates, the first turn from human geogra-\nphy to social geography as of the early twentieth century was theoretically unin-\nformed about social science and showed that merely integrating the social dimension 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 33\ninto a space-centered perspective was insufficient for adequately theorizing about\nsocial action and societal dynamics. What was required instead was a reformulation\nand restructuring of theoretical categories and classifications in order to move from\na society-oriented spatial science to a space- and place-oriented social science. This\nrequirement applied to the social sciences and geography alike.\nSocial science\u2019s traditional geographical or spatial descriptions of the world,\nsuch as \u201cspace is a relational order or arrangement of living organisms and social\ngoods, of living organisms and things that have a social meaning\u201d (L\u00f6w, 2001,\np. 157, my translation), insufficiently distinguish between the ontological status of\nphysical, subjective, and sociocultural conditions. Such postulations are intended to\nreestablish a sociology of space and are not too distant from the Chicago School of\nsociology in the 1920s. However, all they appear to do is help create \u201contological\nslums\u201d (Hard, 1998, p. 250). In fact, sociologies of space that draw on the above\nontological premises revert to the state of geography prior to its overhaul by the\nsocial sciences.\nThe challenge of integrating the spatial dimension into the social science per-\nspective\u2014and vice versa\u2014results most of all from ignoring the fact that geographi-\ncal \u201cspace\u201d is a theoretical concept. Rectifying this lapse requires one to adapt the\nconcept\u2019s use to an ontological focus of study. It is not possible to apply just any\ntheory and its specific vocabulary to just any context.\nInadequate adaptation of the theoretical term space yields contradictions, as\nBourdieu\u2019s shows in his work on social space. According to Bourdieu (1985), geo-\ngraphical space is not a condition of the social world. But he claims that the social\nsphere can be located in geographical space. The included containerization of social\nreality contradicts the theory of the social production and construction of reality\n(Berger & Luckmann, 1966; Giddens, 1984; Sch\u00fctz, 1932, 1981). That way the\nsocial is just part of a material, pregiven space preceding all social praxis.\nConsequently, the containerization of the social implies the transformation the\nsocial into a materiel fact. As already implied, similar problems of reducing the\nsocial dimension to geographical space are also evident in the Chicago School\u2019s\ntheory of urban sociology, which adapted Warming\u2019s ecology\u2014his botanic geogra-\nphy (1895) and geography of \u201cplant communities\u201d (1909)\u2014to urban development.\nPark (1952) and his disciples (Park, Burgess, & McKenzie, 1925) even went so far\nas to say that social distance can be measured in spatial distance. Even Giddens\u2019s\n(1984) theory of structuration is, to a certain extent, prone to similar shortcomings\nwhen it takes the Newtonian container space of H\u00e4gerstrand\u2019s (1970) time geogra-\nphy as a basis for the social analysis of routines in everyday life. Similar contradic-\ntions are detectable when geographical space is included in theories of history, as in\nBraudel\u2019s (1949) concept of the longue dur\u00e9e (long term), which\u2014unlike \u201cevent\u201d\nor \u201ceconomic cycle\u201d is thought to be spatially determined. In an outline of social\nhistory, Koselleck (2000) vehemently argued against the reification of time but\nremained silent on the reification of space. 34 B. Werlen\nThe Gaps in Social Theory\nGeographical conditions and spatial relations of human action\u2014in short, spatial-\nity\u2014are central to the shaping, or more precisely, the generation of social life and\nsocial relationships. Solving the \u201cproblem of space\u201d in social theory is therefore a\nkey task despite (or perhaps because of) its significant challenges. Globalization and\nacceleration affect the conditions and circumstances under which everyday actions\nare performed. It is against this backdrop that the problem of space in social the-\nory\u2014and its solution\u2014are of utmost importance, not least because of its sociopo-\nlitical relevance. Spatial configurations or arrangements of material objects are by\nno means merely \u201cdata\u2026that has to be taken into account\u201d (Weber, 1922/1980,\np. 3). They are key conditions for the performance of social actions, hence, for the\ngeneration of social realities, and are consequently vital to research in the social\nsciences.\nSpace (or the spatial dimension) has an epistemic relevance that differs from the\none attributed to it by Max Weber, the founder of the interpretative, action-centered\nsocial theory. To Weber (1924/1988), \u201cpurely geographic aspects\u201d (p. 462) (i.e.,\nphysical features such as climate and terrain) shall not be part of the realm that is\naccessible via Verstehen (i.e., the \u201cinterpretive\u201d inquiry into social phenomena). For\nthis reason they ought to be excluded from the problems examined by interpretive\nsociology specifically and interpretive social sciences more generally (see, for\nexample, Giddens, 1979, p. 202). Without exaggeration, this alignment of interpre-\ntative social theoretical thinking\u2014and consequently of social policies\u2014is arguably\none of the core reasons for the emergence of modern societies\u2019 extreme ecological\nproblems. The exclusion of the geographical aspects of action-centered social the-\nory is pivotal in the current situation, as is the exclusion of meaningful social reality\nthrough excessive biologization of the social dimension in both functionalist think-\ning (Durkheim, 1893, 1957; Parsons, 1952, 1961) and ecological reasoning from its\noutset in Haeckel (1866) to the Brundtland report (World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development, 1987) and subsequent UN environmental policies.\nUnlike Max Weber\u2019s position (its basic fostering of meaning-oriented modern\nsocial theory as opposed to the biological-reductionist and functionalist versions of\nsocial theory of his time), my argument in this chapter is that the generation of\nsociocultural realities always points to specific spatial relations and, hence, to spe-\ncific society\u2013spatiality relationships and society\u2013nature relationships. This proposi-\ntion ought not be mistaken as an attempt to revive environmental or geographical\ndeterminism\u2014quite the opposite. However, failure to recognize the relevance of\nsocieties\u2019 spatial relations may bring about profound political and ecological\nconflicts.\nThe words space and nature refer to each other (Werlen, 2000, pp. 40\u201390). To\navoid unnecessary, highly problematic confusion, one must first clearly differentiate\nthem. A spatial constellation of material or natural things and objects is not the same\nas a physical space. This type of equating is reminiscent of geography as a nascent\nscientific discipline. Conceiving of space and nature as one, as a single unit, results 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 35\nin a geo- or space-focused environmental policy (with its attendant concepts of\nsustainability), which is still fashionable in current environmental research pro-\ngrams and policies. That kind of policy posits the earth sciences as the bodies of\nknowledge most competent for addressing the resulting problems, so they are tasked\nwith the development of solutions to sustainability problems. Such an approach,\nhowever, overlooks the point that sustainability problems ultimately arise from\nhuman actions, not from space or nature. It is time, therefore, to reassess disciplin-\nary competence and authority.\nNotions of space are important not only for the biophysical realm but also for the\nmanner in which one conceptualizes the social dimension. As a kind of \u201cdeep ontol-\nogy\u201d (Werlen, 1995, p. 2), they also influence the way social realities are constituted\nand perceived, especially with respect to sociopolitical debates. The implications of\nsuch a deep ontological linkage between space and society is most evident in\nHeidegger\u2019s (1933/2000) scathing critique of the work of neo-Kantian philosopher\nRichard H\u00f6nigswald. By arguing for liberal society, wrote Heideggar, H\u00f6nigswald\nwould make himself a \u201cservant of an indifferent, universal world culture\u201d (p. 132)\nand would distract from the \u201chistorical rootedness and ethnic [v\u00f6lkisch] tradition of\nthe origin in soil and blood\u201d (p. 132, my translation) and thereby compromise the\nGerman population. In brief, anyone rejecting the notion of spatial rootedness in the\nsense of the biologically determined nexus of blood and soil, geographical origin,\nand tradition was an enemy of the biologically justified soil-bound society, the pop-\nulation. In keeping with the assumed deep ontological unity of equating not only\nspace and nature but also space and society, such heretics are to be kept out, expelled,\nor exterminated. Such a biologically determined space\u2013society combination is char-\nacteristic of ethnic nationalism that is still a common foundation of highly problem-\natic political reasoning and comes very close to that other biological typification of\nthe socioculture: racism.\nThis example semantically illustrates the meaning of the statement that space has\nprofound implications for what is meant by society, and vice versa. In other words,\nspace and society are discursively constructed images that are influence each other.\nThis relationship certainly holds also for constellations unrelated to ethnic ideas.\nHowever, the significance of the mutually referential relationship between society\nand space has thus far been largely neglected, the reason being that sociology and\ngeography have had their specific blind spots for a long time\u2014and to a certain\nextent still do. Sociology used to offer an only insufficiently reflexive concept of\nspatial reference (see Bourdieu, 1985; Giddens, 1979, 1984, 1993), and geogra-\nphy\u2019s understanding of society long remained undertheorized. The nexus of space\nand social theory is still mostly rather superficial. It does not seriously take account\nof the deep implications that concepts of space have for the generation of society\nand that the relevance of social realities has for the theoretical conceptualization of\nspace in the history of science, particularly the history of geography.\nThis is the basis on which ontological slums are flourishing. They result mainly\nfrom reified everyday concepts being reproduced in a nonreflexive way at the scien-\ntific level as meaningful spaces or biomaterial social worlds. The implications of\nsuch \u201cslum\u201d reproduction in scientific (dis)guise should be examined in the spirit of 36 B. Werlen\nscience\u2019s noblest task: critical doubt. One promising way to approach it is to recon-\nstruct the historical development of geography as an academic discipline in its\nsociocultural context.\nSocial Conditions of Scientific Research and the History\nof Space\nHistorically, geographers have conceived of space as a three-dimensional earth\nspace, also called geographical space (Werlen, 1993a; 2000). It has been the pri-\nmary focus of their research. In the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of\ngeography as an academic discipline, their foremost task was to classify all manner\nof phenomena on the earth\u2019s surface on the basis of a metric (discrete) concept of\nspace as defined by cartographic coordinates. To produce such \u201cmeasuring of the\nworld\u201d (Kehlmann, 2007) and the associated spatial-cartographic conception of the\nworld to derive scientific descriptions was customary practice in academic geogra-\nphy at that time. That approach assigned a particular area or space to material\nobjects and immaterial phenomena, laying the groundwork for the further develop-\nment of geography as a spatial science.\nAcademic geography moved from being a descriptive and classificatory disci-\npline concerned with nature and the Earth in a biophysical sense to a methodologi-\ncally inclusive endeavor aimed at discovering causal relationships. That is, scholarly\ngeography changed in its focus (which was established by Alexander von Humboldt\nand Carl Ritter) from the cartography of objects and a description of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface (chorography) to a causal and integrative geography, or spatial science (cho-\nrology). In this approach, space was thought of as a container. It thus represented a\nspecific form of the theoretical concept of space developed by Isaac Newton for\nmechanics and later transferred to biology by Ernst Haeckel, who referred to it as\nlebensraum.\nOne of the most important historical conditions of this development in geogra-\nphy was prepared by Isaac Newton (1687) in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\nMathematica, the conceptualization of space as absolute. In Opticks Newton\n(1704/1952) defined space as a three-dimensional container space, containing\neverything material as an object and \u201cGod\u2019s Sensorium\u201d (p. 125). With the underly-\ning mechanical view of the natural world, Newton conceives of this container as\nmaterial and absolute and as having a causal effect on everything contained in it.\nThis definition of the absolute container space constitutes the basis of mechanics\nand the beginnings of the modern natural sciences. Despite being intended for mod-\neling three-dimensional material\u2014but not ideal, immaterial phenomena\u2014this con-\ncept of space came to be applied far beyond the realm of mechanics. It became the\nfoundation for an all-encompassing mechanistic world view and provided the ratio-\nnale for positing universal laws of nature that claim validity for all parts of reality,\nincluding consciousness, society, and culture. 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 37\nIn the first development and conceptualization of ecology, Haeckel (1866) gave\nspace a connotation similar to that in Newton (1704/1952). Space appeared to be a\ncontainer or, more precisely, a container for all forms of life (Weingarten, 2009), as\na lebensraum, a living space. At the same time, the lebensraum is also thought of as\na sort of antagonist that every life form must contend with if it wishes to survive.\nThe availability of a lebensraum was thus considered a necessary condition for the\nexistence of all life forms and was at the same time a key evolutionary selection\nmechanism. In other words, the lebensraum in Haeckel\u2019s conceptualization and\nbeyond had a causal effect in the sense that it distinguished successful from unsuc-\ncessful life forms and selected the former. From this reified and causally productive\n\u201cauthority\u201d lebensraum one can derive a normative principle for life forms. It holds\nthat only the fittest species will survive in a specific lebensraum. More important,\nthe underlying tenor is that these fitting species will not only be able to survive but\nare the only ones that should survive. It is obvious at this point that a premise assum-\ning a nexus of life and space (or blood and soil) also serves as a basis for ideas of\nracial hygiene and the legitimation of spatial hygiene or ethnic cleansing.\nTrained as a zoologist, the founder of academic human geography Friedrich\nRatzel (1891, 1897) conceived of space much as his teacher Ernst Haeckel had: as\nthe determining life container of anthropos, or humanity. Thus, the human leben-\nsraum was seen as the cause that determines a population\u2019s characteristics (\u201craces\u201d\nand \u201cpeoples\u201d), and it became a determining frame for political processes\u2014or, fur-\nther, an agent of human history. According to this logic, cultures (social and eco-\nnomic forms) are the result of biological\u2014that is, spatially determined\u2014life forms.\nNatural conditions become natural spatial relations. These biologically interpreted\nspatial relations determine life and, hence, the specific features of cultures and\nsocieties.\nSuch a reduction of the social dimension to the biological level conceptually and\nmethodologically disregards the interpretive dimensions of social actions and the\nrelevance of interpretive patterns in dealing with natural conditions. The premise of\nlebensraum and the biologistic reduction it implies are the foundation on which the\nresearch program of an early human geography is built. It aims to prove spatial\ndeterminism as environmental determinism of cultures, societies, and economies.\nThe geographical world view is thus from the outset a mechanistic world view\nestablished by Newton, then transferred by Haeckel to biology and by Ratzel to the\nfield of geographical research.\nAs for methodology, academic geography morphed at the end of nineteenth cen-\ntury into a causalistic science. It aimed to show empirically the natural space\u2019s\ndetermining effect on human actions and subsequently offered corresponding geo-\ngraphical explanations for the observed forms of cultural and economic realities.\nGeography\u2019s adaptation of the mechanistic world view as an ideal for scientific\ninquiry not only enhanced the discipline\u2019s scientific reputation and its political\ninfluence but thenceforth also served as the point of reference for the formation of\nthe social science perspective on geography. In the context of traditional regional\ngeography, for example, Max Weber (1924/1988) identified the relevance of the\ngeographical point of view as establishing \u201cin any given case which of the specific 38 B. Werlen\ncomponents of cultural phenomena are attributable to climatic or similar, purely\ngeographic aspects\u201d (p. 462).\nPolitically, the alleged proof that cultures and societies are environmentally\ndeterministic is connected to the normative claim of identifying the correct spatial\nexpanse of nations by identifying their natural boundaries and uncovering the \u201ccom-\nmandments of the soil\u201d (Ratzel, 1891, p. 48; my translation). In this way, \u201cgeo-\ngraphical facts\u201d (Hettner, 1927, p. 267; my translation) are understood as the actual\nconstitutive aspects that are to be uncovered as the true forces shaping social and\ncultural realities. Alfred Hettner, one of the important representatives of causal\ngeography in the first half of the twentieth century and the leading figure of regional\ngeography, pithily summarized this program: \u201cBy passing over human volition, we\nascribe the geographic facts of humans to the environmental conditions present in\ntheir respective countries\u201d (p. 267; my translation).\nUnderstanding space as a fact that precedes all human actions opens the door to\na line of reasoning that culminates in the idea that the structuring and organization\nof cultures and societies could be influenced through spatial planning. Geopolitics\nthus becomes a key concern for politics. Denying human individuals the possibility\nof making their own decisions and shaping social reality are the key anti-\nEnlightenment views in the geopolitical world view, especially in its National\nSocialist hue.\nTo sum up, the elements of the space\u2013society combination discussed thus far are,\nfirst, a substantialist container space; second, a biological concept of life; and third\n(as a merger of the previous two), a concept of lebensraum as something that deter-\nmines life forms located in it. Notions of the social dimension as being somehow\ndetermined by such a lebensraum imply a naturalistic or biologistic reductionism,\nthat is, a reduction of the social dimension to the biological category \u201clife.\u201d The\nnotion of society thus turns into a biologistic one, so it is frequently replaced by\n\u201cpopulation.\u201d The constitution of subjective meanings on basis of the stock of\nknowledge at hand, subjective interpretations, and symbolic appropriations are not\nconsidered subjects of scholarly research in general or of the dominant mainstream\ngeographical research in particular. As a result, the interpretative social and cultural\nsciences can be removed from the catalogue of scientific disciplines; biology and\ntraditional geography are then sufficient for researching societies and social\nphenomena.\nFor sociocultural realities to be suitably investigated and characterized, one may\ninvert the space\u2013society combination, recast it as a society\u2013space logic so as to put\nsociety first and consider the spatial dimension as an element of social realities but\nnot as its determinant. Attempts to avoid the geodeterministic logic within the\nspace\u2013society paradigm\u2014particularly those efforts made within geography\u2019s spa-\ntial scientific program (Bartels, 1968; Bunge, 1962; Harvey, 1969)\u2014have been\nunsuccessful. The spatial turn in sociology resulted in a \u201csociology of space\u201d\n(Simmel, 1903) that delved primarily into the research on the \u201cconstitution of\nspace\u201d (L\u00f6w, 2008, p. 25) and the structuration of spaces instead of the structuration\nof society. Such a line of inquiry is consistent with the spatial scientific approach in\ntraditional geography and, consequently, becomes trapped in these outdated 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 39\nconcepts of space\u2014despite rhetoric that seems to suggest otherwise (Lippuner &\nLossau, 2004). To be fair, Lefebvre (1974)\u2014a key reference in the sociology of\nspace\u2014bypassed these problems. Yet his notions of perceived, conceived, and lived\nspaces call into question spatial practice in spatial terminology (Schmid, 2005,\np. 18) instead of helping one regard space an abstract, conceptual element of social\npractice.\nFrom the preceding discussion it can be concluded that spatial scientific attempts\nto approach the social dimension ultimately leads to naturalistic reduction of mean-\ningful sociocultural realities. Even more recent attempts to establish a society-\noriented spatial science or a spatioscientific sociology end up reducing the social\ndimension to the geographical space. And because the three-dimensional geograph-\nical space permits only the localization of three-dimensional material facts, this\nprocedure leads (at least implicitly) to a reification of nonmaterial established facts.\nA nonreductionist inclusion of the geospatial dimension in an interpretative analysis\nof socioculturally constructed realities requires one to differentiate the various\ndimensions of human action by their ontological status. Only then can the ontologi-\ncal slum be avoided. Perhaps more precisely, only then can the ontological swamp\nbe drained of the sewage of geospatial reductionisms.\nDifferent Spaces for Different Worlds\nA sufficiently detailed ontological differentiation is essential in order to give due\nconsideration to both society and space. The flawed arguments put forward by spa-\ntially ignorant social sciences and socially ignorant geography are to be avoided,\nand human geography is to be reconstructed as an interpretative, constructivist, and\nsocioscientific geography, such as a social geography. Such ontological differentia-\ntions should make it possible to overcome the kind of reductionism that spatializes\nsocial and cultural aspects and to develop alternative approaches.\nSocial practices can be seen as being composed of three ontologically different\ndimensions: the corporeal (biophysical), the mental (cognitive), and the sociocul-\ntural (Popper, 1972; Sch\u00fctz, 1981). Subjecting these dimensions to the same kind of\nanalytical procedure would therefore seem improper. Accordingly, social practices\ncan first be distinguished into physical conditions and thought content. The former\nare characterized by their material substance, which has a spatial extent and can be\ndescribed in terms of height, width, and depth. The physical realities refer to all\nmaterial conditions and states, including actors\u2019 bodies, and exist independently of\nthe subjects\u2019 thought content. The mental dimension refers to a person\u2019s knowledge\nand experience. It includes not only the reflexive (or discursive) but also the uncon-\nscious and the practical (or tacit) consciousness and related states of mind and forms\nof knowledge. The practical (or tacit) consciousness describes those elements of\nknowledge that subjects competently draw on when acting but that they cannot ver-\nbalize (at least not easily). 40 B. Werlen\nConcerning the distinction between the physical and the mental world, action-\nand practice-centered approaches stress that the meaning of material objects depends\non subjects\u2019 constitution of meaning on the basis of the stock of knowledge at hand.\nAccording to Sch\u00fctz (1981, p. 92), the human body is the epitome of mediation\nbetween these two worlds. The body simultaneously is the center of immediate\nexperience, the medium of actions, and a field of expression of subjective meaning.\nFurthermore, the mental world cannot be analyzed in isolation from the sociocul-\ntural world; the former is always\u2014through socialization processes\u2014embedded into\nthe latter. Individuals are initiated into the sociocultural world through socialization\nor their action (Berger & Luckmann, 1966).\nOntologically, the sociocultural world is identical with neither the physical nor\nthe mental world. Neither is it merely a combination of the two. The sociocultural\nworld includes the intersubjectively accepted and applicable social norms and cul-\ntural values and the institutionalized patterns of action in the economic, legal, reli-\ngious, and other realms. The meanings of these norms, values, and societal action\npatterns transcend the mental world of individual subjects and are therefore assigned\na separate ontological standing.\nAction, Knowledge, and Space\u2014Space, Knowledge,\nand Action\nAny definition of space has to take into account that the word has different mean-\nings, depending on the meaning and situation of the action under consideration.\nDepending on the type of action, both the formal and the classificatory aspect\nacquire a specific connotation. That is, both aspects are contingent on the specific\ninterests pursued by the actor.\nThe nomenclature of the spatial dimension changes with the model of action:\ninstrumentally rational action, norm-oriented action, and meaning-oriented action.\nThe shift of the spatial dimension\u2019s nomenclature occurs or, more precisely, is nec-\nessary because relations with the body change depending on the orientation (or\nmodel) of action gives an overview of the characteristic attributes of each dimension\n(see Table 2.1).\nTable 2.1 The characteristic attributes of action and space\nAttributes Formal Classificatory/relational Examples\nInstrumentally Metric Classificatory calculation Land market, real\nrational estate\nNorm oriented Metric and Classificatory-relational Nation-state, front and\nbody centered prescription back region\nMeaning oriented Body centered Relational signification Motherland, homeland\nFrom Werlen (2013, p. 9) 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 41\nIn the instrumentally rational model both orientation and classification are\nclosely related to what Max Weber called \u201cdisenchantment of the world\u201d (Weber,\n1922/1980, p. 308). Giddens (1990) characterized this pithily as \u201cemptying of\nspace\u201d (p. 18) and \u201cemptying of time\u201d (p. 18). Such disenchantment and emptying\nof formerly stable and invariable meanings convey the formalization of the interpre-\ntation of reality. This formalization builds upon the metrization of spatial expanse\nand thus facilitates classification and calculation. Formalization and metrization\n(e.g., longitude and latitude) are the basis of modern cartographic representations of\nthe earth\u2019s surface and their use as an orientation for action. If the spatial dimension\nis included in the course of action in the instrumentally rational model, it is only as\npurely formal aspects of action; substantively, however, the spatial dimension is no\nlonger tied to specific actions in a general, invariable way.\nWith regard to norm-oriented day-to-day activities, spatially bound prescrip-\ntions\u2014the relation between norm orientation and spatial expanse\u2014are key. When\nrelating to the physical world, actors apply, hypothetically, a classificatory criterion\nand a relational criterion to orient their actions. Using the classificatory criterion,\nthey apply specific criteria (e.g., park) to categorize (e.g., public/private) the cir-\ncumstances that are relevant to their actions. Using the relational criterion, actors\nattribute a relation to these categories (e.g., accessible/inaccessible) according to\ncertain social or legal norms and cultural values.\nOf particular societal relevance are relations with normative-prescriptive spatial\nconnotations, such as permitted/prohibited or, \u201cYou are allowed to do activity X\nhere but not there.\u201d Such attributions result from processes of territorialization\nbased on clearly measurable delineations. Control over people and the means of\nviolence are organized via action-related territorialization, with the human body\nbeing the pivotal element. The combination of norm, body, and spatial context is\nexemplified by the modern nation-state with its territorially bound law and\njurisdiction.\nThe spatial connotation of understanding rests on a distinctive focus on the body\nas the central element of interaction and communication. The significance of the\nbody (K\u00f6rper) for the spatial connotations becomes obvious as soon as the body is\nunderstood as the \u201cparticularly suitable link\u201d (Sch\u00fctz, 1981, p. 41, my translation)\nbetween the subjective and the extended, spatial physical world. From this perspec-\ntive one can understand the body as a kind of a \u201cfunctional link\u201d (Werlen, 1993b,\np. 75), switching element, or mediator for subjective biographical knowledge and\nsymbolic appropriation of physical elements of contexts of action. Assuming that\nthe meaning of the circumstances deemed relevant to someone\u2019s actions depends on\nthe person\u2019s available knowledge, then the way meaning is attributed arguably\ndepends on that hitherto acquired knowledge.\nA decisive factor bearing on the formation of the knowledge stock is the bodily\nrelation in the sense of presence/absence, in other words, the relation between direct\nand mediated experiences of the world. The significance of copresence\u2014the shar-\ning of corporeality in the here and now\u2014is based on the direct experience of the\nworld through one\u2019s senses. The significance lies in having seen something with\none\u2019s own eyes and having heard something with one\u2019s own ears and having gained 42 B. Werlen\nthe attendant intimate knowledge. This relationship between the physical senses\nand the world contrasts with mediated ways of acquiring information and knowl-\nedge, which are characterized by a much lower level of intimacy.\nThe distinction between direct and mediated forms of knowledge acquisition\nunderlies the generation of meanings and the production of significative relations to\nthe world. In much the same way as prescriptions are the basis for territorialization\nin the norm-oriented model of action, emotive relations are the basis for classifica-\ntory significations as emotional/symbolic relations to specific places. They are\nexpressed in regions of meaning attached to material entities and described by\nwords such as homeland, sacred site, landmark, and image. In this form they fre-\nquently become unquestioned elements of social communication.\nHypothetically, the more these relations are based on immediate experience (inti-\nmate knowledge) and bodily everyday practice, the more they elude reflexive con-\ntrol and become linked to hypostatization and reification, eventually eliminating the\ndifference between nomenclature (signification) and the named objects and circum-\nstances (materiality). The represented meaning and the vehicle of representation\nbecome one and the same despite all existing ontological differences. As a result,\nhomeland does not register as the expression of emotional, symbolic classification\nof a clearly delineated section of the world through which embodied experiences are\nrepresented. Instead, homeland \u201cis\u201d also experience, much like sacred site \u201cis\u201d itself\nthe sacred. The more the basis for the signification is mediated\u2014for example, via\nadvertising\u2019s instrumentally rational, conceptualized images of places\u2014the more\nthey are hypothetically subject to reflexive control. In both cases these relations\nbecome elements of communication and can orient normative-political action (e.g.,\nnationalism, regionalism) as well as instrumentally rational consumptive action and\nproductive action (e.g., tourism, place image, place reputation).\nAccordingly, physical objects in a certain constellation or arrangement as a situ-\nation of action can only carry or convey meaning, but they can never be the mean-\ning. Physical objects are the media of symbolization; they are always mere vehicles\nthat transport meaning. Hence, there can be a spatial order of vehicles but not of\nmeanings. A distinction must be drawn between symbolic space and the spatial\narrangement of symbolizing vehicles. Meanings are always located on the side of\nthe subject and never on the side of the object. Meanings are attributed, and the\npractice of attributing meaning is a way of establishing relations and bonds.\nThe distinction between three different models of action (instrumentally rational\naction, norm-oriented action, and meaning-oriented action) and their corresponding\nterminologically defined appropriation of spatially expansive physical objects hint\nat the meaning that relations and bonds in these realms of everyday practice may\nhave. At the same time, they illustrate that the relations to space are dependent on\nthe type of action undertaken. Subscribing to this view implies conceptualizing\nsocial geography as an investigation of different forms of everyday action-related\ngeography-making, of geographical practices. 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 43\nIncorporation of the World and the Construction\nof Geographical Realities\nFrom a world view, a geographical imagination that puts the cognizing, knowing,\nand acting subject at the center results in a dynamization of the geographical per-\nspective on and understanding of the world. The focus shifts from the question of\nwhere objects and people are located in space to the question of scholarly examina-\ntion of forms of everyday geography-making. In short, attention turns to the inter-\npretation of meaningful constructions of geographical realities, including the\nmeaningful appropriation of objects, places, and spaces.\nFor this purpose a quite substantial part of geographical terminology needs to be\nredefined. One, if not the, key word is regionalization. From traditional to spatial\nscientific geography as well as in Giddens\u2019s (1984) theory of structuration, region-\nalization referred to the subdivision of given spaces (in whatever way it was deter-\nmined). From the subject-centered new perspective, however, \u201cregionalization\u201d is\nunderstood to denote an everyday practice of establishing ties to the world in a\nspecific manner. By emphasizing the spatial and temporal aspects of these specific\nrelations, one can call them \u201cworld relationship\u201d (Weltbeziehung, Werlen, 1996,\np. 112) or \u201cworld-binding\u201d (Weltbindung, Werlen, 1997, p. 215), the act of defining,\nshaping, or establishing one\u2019s own ties to the world. I would now like to call that act\nof geography-making \u201cworld incorporation.\u201d World incorporation refers to the\nsocial mastering of spatial and temporal relations in order to monitor and control\none\u2019s own actions and those of others. It refers to the way subjects relate to the\nworld; it constitutes one\u2019s relations to the world.\nIn the context of everyday regionalizations, space is a conceptual tool and a\nmedium for action with which the various forms of world incorporation are imple-\nmented. The constraining and enabling component of power is particularly impor-\ntant in this respect. Its various manifestations are reflected in the varying degrees of\ncapability and spatial range of world incorporation. Hence, in the subject-centered\nreconceptualization of geography, the space-centered question of power over space\nis replaced by the question of the efficacy of the available spatioconceptual media\nthat are used to exercise power over and surveillance of practices.\nThe capability of shaping\u2014which is inherent in social practices and does not\nexist outside them\u2014is characterized, on the one hand, by the spatial and temporal\nrange of one\u2019s actions. In this sense power is reflected in the transformative capacity\nof human action. On the other hand, this capability also depends on the ability to\nintegrate absent subjects and objects into the realization of one\u2019s own aims and\nobjectives. In the sense used by Giddens (1984), capability can be understood as\nconsisting of resources and rules of action. According to him, the capability of\nmonitoring and controlling the access to and the appropriation and use of natural\nresources and the world of material objects can be conceptualized as meaning that\none has allocative resources at one\u2019s disposal. This capability exists in all forms of\nsocietal organization and relates to control over material resources, material artifacts 44 B. Werlen\nused in the transformation of these resources, and material goods produced in this\ntransformation.\nWithin the frame of world incorporation, the terminological means with which\naccess to allocative resources is granted is the notion of measured extension as met-\nric space divested of all other symbolic attributions. This notion of space is the one\nimplicit in cost calculations having to do with the distance and scale of transport at\nthe beginning of the production line (e.g., shipping raw materials to the factory) and\nat its end (e.g., distributing to various retailers the goods produced from those raw\nmaterials). In combination with the notion of standardized metric time, it is possible\nto calculate the parameters for acting over distance. Such calculations facilitate\nplanning of economic activities in both production (including work processes and\ncommodity flows) and capital accumulation (Harvey, 1982) via world incorporation\nprocesses in global contexts.\nThe capability of acquiring and maintaining control and governance over\nactors\u2014even in one\u2019s physical absence\u2014is called authoritative resource. Such a\ncapability of controlling and governing is based on direct or indirect access to the\nbodies of those being monitored, controlled, or governed, or on direct or indirect\naccess to body-related ways of authorizing or preventing actions and of maintaining\nthose actions over time.\nWorld incorporation via authoritative resources is represented in the term terri-\ntory, which prescriptively connects normative tenets to spatial expanse. These nor-\nmative tenets (and their legal enforcement strategies) can be called upon in cases\nwhere human bodies enter or use the territory. The property rights connected to\nthese normative prescriptions authorize or prevent access by others and facilitate\nmaximum control over people and over the use of areas and material artifacts\n(means of production). Therefore, the resource-related aspects of incorporating the\nworld refer to economic, social, political, juridical, and other dimensions.\nAuthoritative resources are usually superimposed onto allocative resources, but the\nmobilization of authoritative resources always requires allocative resources (e.g., to\nensure that one\u2019s own actions prevail).\nHowever, the structuration of human action and, hence, of all forms of world\nincorporation does not rely on resources alone. According to Giddens (1984), rules\nare the second important aspect. They include specific semantic and moral rules that\ncan form powerful interpretive schemes and can regulate courses of action in a\nvalue-specific manner. Actors use these interpretive schemes to interpret (in line\nwith the rules) and symbolically organize practice-specific realms of reality.\nInterpretive schemes are the most comprehensive form of the structuration of human\naction and, consequently, of the constitution of society or sociocultural realities.\nRule-specific aspects are key for types of action oriented to intersubjective\nunderstanding. These aspects underlie all types of symbolic relations to the world.\nThe vocabulary used for such emotionally charged, significative classifications of\nrelations to places and objects includes sacred site and homeland. 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 45\nRegionalizations and Regions of Meaningful Geographical\nRealities\nThe programmatic research areas concerning meaningful geographical realities are\nderived from the three already mentioned types of action theories: instrumentally\nrational, normative, and meaning oriented. Depending on research interests, empiri-\ncal investigations might focus on socioeconomic aspects (consumptive-productive\ntypes of world incorporation), sociopolitical aspects (political-normative types of\nworld incorporation), or sociocultural aspects (informative-significative types of\nworld incorporation). Everyday actions feature all three dimensions simultaneously.\nIn addition, each of these dimensions is interpreted differently by different subjects;\nthat is, it is idiosyncratically relevant to one\u2019s actions (see Table 2.2). Therefore,\ngeography turns into everyday geographies.\nResearch on the economic type of world incorporation revolves around three\nmain questions: (a) How do producers bring under their control the raw material\nused in the production process and the labor force? In other words, how do they\nrelate to the world (or bind the world to themselves)? (b) How do consumers decide\nwhat to buy? That is, under which conditions and with which medium or resources\ndo they make which decisions? (c) What is the relationship between the productive\nand consumptive types of world incorporation?\nProduction-related types of world incorporation involve, first, deciding on a site\nor location at which to produce. Such decisions are typically made by drawing on\nthe locational focus of production-related activities and commodity flows that are\ndirectly mediated by the body. Decisions on where to produce and on the corre-\nsponding arrangements generated as a result of such decisions are elements of eco-\nnomic world incorporation. They are always tied to allocative resources and the\nnotion of metric space. The analytical lens of world incorporation (everyday actions\nyielding multiple everyday geographies) enables one to describe systematically the\nestablishing of global relations pertaining to productive types of world incorpora-\ntion, especially in times of digital or virtual capitalism, when capital accumulation\nno longer requires activities involving the body or other matter. In addition, the\nperspective of world incorporation makes it possible to analyze the varying\ncapabilities of control over resources, material goods, means of production, and the\nresulting power and power relations.\nTable 2.2 Types of world incorporation\nMain types Subtypes\nProductive-consumptive Geographies of production\nGeographies of consumption\nNormative-political Geographies of normative appropriation\nGeographies of political control\nSignificative-informative Geographies of information\nGeographies of symbolic appropriation\nFrom Werlen (1997, p. 274) 46 B. Werlen\nConsumption decisions largely depend on available financial means (i.e., alloca-\ntive resources) and lifestyle (traditional or individual). The relevance of consump-\ntion decisions is expanding along with people\u2019s increasing reflexivity with regard to\nconsumption decisions and intensifying globalization. Consumption decisions\nreflect subjectively constituted cultural and life worlds because late-modern life-\nstyles are largely shaped by subjective decisions. (In traditional ways of life, by\ncontrast, collective constraints are the dominant factor determining the course of\nactions). Accordingly, consumption is embedded in the processes through which\npeople develop their subjectivity. This embeddedness also leads to the continuing\ndissipation of the territorial logic in both the economic and the cultural realm.\nAgainst this backdrop it becomes clear why geoscience-based environmental\npolicy- making is doomed to fail. What is needed instead in this context is a practice-\ncentered ecocritique and ecopolicies. Because the local and the global are interwo-\nven, lifestyle-specific consumption for the purpose of moving toward moral and\nethical consumption and global sustainability is becoming negotiable in public dis-\ncourse (Werlen, 2012, 2015).\nResearch on social and political types of world incorporation currently focuses\non geographies of normative appropriation and political control. Prescriptive-\nnormative appropriations prevent or facilitate access to spatial contexts of action. At\nthe same time, they serve to socially regulate types of action within these spatial\ncontexts. In addition to formal political regionalizations such as the nation-state,\nfederal states and counties, important informal normative regionalizations with\nrespect to age, social status, role, and gender are regulating access to and exclusion\nfrom certain spatial contexts of everyday life. Goffman\u2019s (1959) distinction between\nfront and back region also belongs to this category. His approach usefully highlights\nthe relevance of both the reference point of interaction and the setting for the way\ninteractions are performed.\nThus far, I have informally described negotiated regionalizations. They have to\nbe distinguished from formal, legally recognized, institutionally established, and\nbureaucratically organized regionalizations. Such formal regionalizations make\ncommand and power over others possible in absentia, meaning that physical copres-\nence of the rulers and the ruled is not required for power to be exercised. At the\nsame time, formal regionalizations play a key role in identifying and categorizing\nclasses of rights (e.g., constitutional, administrative, and criminal law; contract, tort,\nand property law). Research on formal regionalizations also encompasses the rela-\ntion between public and private space, including surveillance and its legitimacy in\npublic areas.\nFrom the action- and practice-centered perspective proposed here, regionalist,\nnationalist, or ethnic movements can be seen as forces of everyday geography-\nmaking that oppose existing forms of authoritative control. A practice-centered per-\nspective suggests that command and power over territories is actually command and\npower over subjects. This interpretation highlights the difference between a practice-\ncentered and a traditional geopolitical perspective: The former focuses on subjects\nand their different way of making geography (and power); the latter, on the way that 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 47\npower over space supposedly translates into power of space. The fact that regional-\nist and nationalist movements usually follow the traditional geographical and geo-\npolitical logic exposes their Janus-faced character in the light of modernity: claiming\nthe right to self-determination within a spatial-material logic when there is actually\nno self.\nInformative-significative types of world incorporation or regionalizations are\nalso closely tied to the corporeality of subjects. In the absence of the physical body,\ncommunication media serve as extensions of the body. Significative regionaliza-\ntions (in the form of symbolic appropriations) are the most comprehensive and\narguably the most powerful processes in the construction of meaningful geographi-\ncal realities.\nResearch on the geographies of information focuses on the preconditions and\nprocesses of acquiring information and knowledge. With respect to the sender,\nresearch has to clarify the preconditions for generating and linguistically steering\nthe potential appropriation of information via different information media. In his-\ntorical order the starting points include the dissemination of information through\nwriting (e.g., books and other print media), the electronic (radio, TV), and digital\nmedia (internet-based communication). Of particular interest are the globalizing\nconsequences of the production and use of these media and the resulting tensions\nbetween the unfamiliar and familiar, between mediated information and unmediated\nexperience. The implications of those consequences are observable in the context of\ncultural integration, for example.\nSymbolic appropriations (and the symbolic geography-making that they stand\nfor), the production of symbolic structures of spatially locatable phenomena and\nobjects, are key dimensions of cultural representation. Hypothetically, one can\nassume that such symbolic appropriations are relevant in communication and as\nmedia for social integration and regulation (of economic actions). Attributing mean-\ning to material contexts of action through the use of particular terms reflecting the\nrelevant notion of space is always done via practices and usually in the form of\nroutines used to manage standard situations.\nAction and practice-centered geographical research should also inquire into the\nstock of knowledge-based interpretive schemes, rules of interpretation, skills, moral\nrules, and emotional dispositions that substantiate the different types of appropria-\ntions conducted as classificatory significations. Clarification of the following ques-\ntions is required, too: Which subject-related geographies of symbolic appropriation\nare being produced in which communicative contexts? What do the symbolizations\nrepresent and with what consequences? How are the symbolizations enforced? A\nfurther important area of research is the empirical identification of the transforma-\ntive potential that symbolic appropriations of places and material contexts of action\ncan have for economic and political practices. The reconstruction of the processes\nconstituting everyday \u201cmythologies\u201d (Barthes, 1957) and of their underlying reifi-\ncation techniques (\u201cchosification\u201d p. 112) are particularly important in this context,\nnot least because they have been in the focus of traditional geographical research. 48 B. Werlen\nThe six main types of world incorporation\u2014the ways of defining, shaping, or\nestablishing one\u2019s own ties to the world\u2014are connected in manifold ways.\nConsumptive actions, for example, belong primarily to the economic field and are\nlinked to allocative resources. However, they are also embedded in normative stan-\ndards and might have a strong cultural-symbolic and/or lifestyle-related connota-\ntion. Particularly with globalization processes, the traditional combinations of a\ngiven type of action in only one field or type of resource\u2014which have long been\ndeeply ingrained, not least because of the unchallenged hegemony of nation-state\ninstitutions\u2014are not only questioned but put into a new \u201corder.\u201d\nSocial Relations of Space\nProcesses of world incorporation are both structured and structuring; they are in the\nfocus of practice-centered geographical research. This perspective makes it possible\nto reformulate the question about the relationship between society and space: Given\nthat the spatiality of actors derives from their corporeality and necessitates world\nincorporation, what significance does that spatiality have for the generation of soci-\netality? How has this basic challenge of spatiality been coped with over the course\nof history?\nThese questions broaden the horizon of social science geography and draw atten-\ntion to two issues: (a) the process of relating social action to the implications of\ncorporeality, and (b) the relevance of these relations for the generation of social\nrealities. In a nutshell, it highlights just how essential society\u2013space relationships\nare for societality. Research on these relationships should therefore be the macro-\nanalytic complement to the microanalytic level of subjective world incorporation\nprocesses in geographical social science research. Together they form the core of\nsocial science geography and are an extension of theories of society and of culture.\nAs the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences suggests, the concept of\nsociety\u2013space relationships takes account of the fact that it is insufficient to include\nthe spatial aspect in social theory as a kind of spatialization of the social dimension.\nWhat is needed instead is a reconceptualization of social theory as a theory that\nrefers to the geographical shaping of social realities without relapsing into material-\nistic or spatial reductionism. It must systematically take into account the implica-\ntions that the corporeality of the actors and the material basis of many social\ninstitutions have for the subsequent spatiality of the social dimension for communi-\ncation, interactions, socialization, learning situations, and care-giving.\nA first important step for highlighting the relevance of spatiality was the con-\ntrasting of social relations and spatial structures (Gregory & Urry, 1985). It focused\non pointing out the spatial manifestations of social reality with respect to the spatial\nstructure of settlements and transport networks, the spatiotemporal paths of social\nreproduction, and social inequalities in the sense of regional disparities, for instance.\nFocusing on society\u2013space relationships reverses the perspective: Research efforts 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 49\nare no longer directed to the spatial structures of societal relationships but rather to\nthe significance that spatial relationships have for the meaningful construction of\nsociocultural and geographical realities.\nWith spatiality being understood as describing actors\u2019 corporeality, this new per-\nspective raises the question about the role that this spatiality and the ways of coping\nwith it play in co-determining the shaping of sociocultural realities. In this context\nthe ways in which people act over distance are profoundly important. Distance is\nunderstood in both a social and the physical sense. According to T\u00f6nnies\n(1887/2001), it is regarded as a core element of the difference between community\nand society. Consequently, the concept of society\u2013space relationships includes con-\nsideration of the ways to cope with one\u2019s spatiality and, hence, with spatial distan-\nciation as constituent of society.\nThe Times They Are a-Changing: From Territorial to Digital\nSocial Realities\nAs noted in this chapter\u2019s introduction, the expression social relations of space\nrefers to the historically and socially established ways of relating to given and spa-\ntially distant circumstances relevant to one\u2019s action. Social relations of space (spa-\ntial relations) are determined by the means and tools available for coping with\nspatiality for the purpose of creating social realities. Accordingly, the dominant\nspatial relations can be identified best by examining the available means and tools.\nSocial relations of space are in this sense grounded in the sociohistorically created\nconditions, means, tools, and media of acting over distance, that is, in the forms and\noptions for coping with the everyday world\u2019s spatiality with respect to all forms of\nsocial practice, social interaction, and communication. Therefore, social relations of\nspace are evident in the current and historical possibilities and impossibilities of the\nsociogeographical conditions of social coexistence. Because the aforementioned\nways of incorporating the world on the basis of terminological media are embedded\nin the historical development of the technological media of acting over distance, the\nanalysis has to complemented by a diachronic perspective.\nThe scope of daily geographical practices is limited by the manifestation of the\nsocial relations of space in each form of world incorporation. The media for master-\ning spatiality have advanced in revolutionary steps. The Neolithic Revolution and\nIndustrial Revolution were, in this sense, also revolutions of society\u2013space rela-\ntions. Another reconfiguration of these society\u2013space relations is taking place as the\nDigital Revolution. Each of these revolutions can (hypothetically) be characterized\nby a distinctive range of options for the formation of societality.\nSocial relations of space determine the modi operandi (for acting over distance),\nbased on which the corporeal social practices that construct sociocultural realities\ncan take place. The historically available means, tools, and media are therefore con-\nstitutive of all forms of societality. I contend that these means, tools, and media are 50 B. Werlen\nconstitutive of social realities in much the same way as the Marxian relations of\nproduction are.\nSocial relations of space are, however, distinct from relations of production and\nmodes of production. According to Marx (1867, p. 792, 1847/1983, p. 130), societal\nhistory progressed from primitive society to slave society (or ancient slave society)\nto feudal society, bourgeois society, and, finally, communist society. Marx assumed\nthese different societal formations to emerge as the result of changing relations of\nproduction. That is, he considered social change to be determined by the respective\nrelations of production. If his analysis can be considered as almost accurate for the\nperiod of industrial revolution, it can certainly not be seen as an all-encompassing\nformula for explaining the social world and its transformation. However, societies\ncan also be classified according to the dominant mode of production and economic\nsector into agrarian, industrial, service, or information societies. By contrast, soci-\nety\u2013space relationships focus on the technological media for coping with distance\nand time. After the Neolithic Revolution they included the wheel; script (cunei-\nform); plant and animal breeding; irrigation; and storage capacities for food, seed,\nand water. The Industrial Revolution brought changes in the form of mechanics,\nmetrization, mechanical drivetrain, and electricity, for instance. In the course of the\nDigital Revolution, numerical data storage and telecommunication in real time have\nbecome new technological media for coping with distance and time.\nModern nation-states can thus be viewed as the manifestations of thinking in\nterms of actions that expand linear reach, territorialization, clearly measurable ter-\nritorial scope of social norms (state borders), bureaucracy, and communication via\nthe medium of text (as opposed to orality) produced by printing technologies. The\nkey question is, then, what the dissolution of the territorial nexus means for societal-\nity in the Digital Age. Further social science research would usefully investigate\nhow to move beyond \u201cmethodological nationalism\u201d (Beck & Sznaider, 2006, p. 3)\nor, more precisely, ontological nationalism, if the differentiation between method-\nological and ontological is used systematically (Werlen, 1987, p. 78, 1993b, p. 40).\nSuch research would need to take account of the fact that geographical and social\nrealities are based on specific modi operandi concerning the manifold ways in\nwhich people are coping with their spatiality.\nThese modi operandi are always imposed upon actors and formally specify the\npossibilities (or impossibilities) of acting over distance. In other words, modi ope-\nrandi can be understood as sets of rules governing the ways in which the available\nmeans, tools, and media can (or cannot) be used by actors. A specific modus ope-\nrandi therefore allows for a specific spatial and temporal reach of people\u2019s actions\nand, by implication, also for particular forms of societality, socialization, and com-\nmunication. For example, pre-Neolithic tribal societies characterized by the pri-\nmacy of the present and of orality (which, in turn, requires bodily copresence)\narguably operate in the synchronic/present mode. By contrast, nation-state forms of\nsocietality draw on analog written communication and the availability of the past\nand therefore operate in the diachronic/distanced mode. I conjecture that the hith-\nerto undetermined societality of the Digital Age\u2014based on numeric digitality\u2014\nwill take the synchronic/distanced modus. 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 51\nImplications: From Space to Action and from Action\nto the Spatiality of Action\nThe approach suggested in this chapter opens up an alternative perspective on many\ncurrent societal issues, including the global financial crisis, global migration, and\nsociocultural integration. They can be understood as consequences of the at least\npotential, continuing, spatiotemporal disembedding of social, cultural, and eco-\nnomic realities in the course of the Digital Revolution. The spatial ties of social\npractices are at least selective and no longer of the same encompassing nature as\nthose in the predigital age. They are the result of practices of appropriation and\nsocially produced spatiality rather than a quasi-natural condition.\nThe aforementioned societal issues can be interpreted as manifestations of the\nmismatch between the spatiotemporal shaping of societality and the logics of con-\ntrol governing that societality. In other words, the above societal issues arise when\nsociety\u2013space relationships have changed or are in the process of changing to a new\nmodus operandi while politics is still operating according to the logics established\nin the previous modus operandi. The increasing disintegration becomes evident in\nthe continued use of territorial strategies (e.g., territorial wars or national financial\npolicy) to dispel problematic consequences of a-territorial networks with fluid\nplace-bound nodes (e.g., terrorism or digital financial capitalism).\nAnalyzing sociocultural realities from the geographical perspective outlined in\nthis chapter emancipates the spatial from the temporal dimension. H\u00e4gerstrand\u2019s\n(1970) time geography has shown that the time required to perform corporeal\nactions correlates with spatial order. In other words, new society\u2013space relation-\nships always imply new society\u2013time relationships, and society\u2013space relationships\ntherefore also represent space\u2013time relationships.\nIncluding actors\u2019 corporeality and the physical conditions of actions in the ana-\nlytical perspective means that time no longer takes precedence over space. The\nacceleration of social life is thus an expression of the altered conditions of coping\nwith spatiality and ultimately leads to action in global contexts in quasi simultane-\nity. The space\u2013time relationships are at the basis of a reconceptualization of social\ntheory.\nIn order to understand the significance of the revolution in the spatial and tempo-\nral conditions of the social dimension\u2014or of globalization and acceleration (Rosa,\n2013) with regard to the circumstances relevant to everyday action\u2014they are to be\nthought of as two sides of the same coin. Whereas globalization denotes the spatial\nreach of one\u2019s action in real time, acceleration refers to its consequences for the\nfrequency of decisions in social interaction. Thinking of globalization and accelera-\ntion as two sides of the same coin enables one to track the societal consequences of\nreshaping society\u2013space relationships.\nThis geographical perspective opens up new approaches to issues of sustainabil-\nity and the analysis of human practices according to ecological criteria. The notion\nof life and society being literally contained in biological habitats can be overcome\nwith the concept of world incorporation. The a priori container space that was 52 B. Werlen\nconventionally assumed to exist independently of human experience and social\npractice\u2014from Haeckel and the ecopolicies based on his ideas to the UN sustain-\nability policies \u00e0 la the Brundtland Report (World Commission on Environment and\nDevelopment, 1987)\u2014no longer has to be the criterion for survival or extinction and\nfor calculations of so-called carrying capacity. Focusing on world incorporation\nmeans turning the perspective upside down: Human action is privileged above habi-\ntat (Earth), so sustainability politics and ecopolitics can be rid of biologistic think-\ning, which usually puts them in the vicinity of traditional geopolitics. This\naccounting for society\u2013space relationships makes it possible for an original approach\nwithout naturalistic reductionisms to be developed (Becker & Jahn, 2006) with eco-\nlogical practices (G\u00e4bler, 2015) rather than ecotopes at its center. Such reorientation\nis a consequence of the geographical turn from space to practice.\nConclusions\nThe scientific investigation into the shaping of spatial relations in a society can be\nseen as an important thematic field for holistic study of social, cultural, economic,\nand political matters, research that is generated by a spatially grounded perspective\nwithout ensnarement in natural or spatial determinism. With the recognition of the\nimportance of society\u2019s spatiality, sociospatial conditions will identifiably become a\npart of the social sphere. For example, they will indicate the fundamental conditions\nfor establishing social relations over distance, which are currently enabling many\nsocial actors to sustainably shape socialization and power without being physically\ncopresent.\nThe dissolution of former principles of sociospatial conditions and the revolu-\ntionary establishment of new ones are resulting in new social arrangements and\nissues. As an already apparent reaction to this situation, there is a new (and highly\nproblematic) tendency to address these changes by relying on well-known structural\nprinciples and established interpretational frameworks, such as the increasing\nnationalization of European or global issues. Yet continued deterioration in spatio-\ntemporal conditions limits the potential success of such territorial solutions. In\nessence they can, hypothetically, be seen as attempts to illustrate how conventional\nconceptions of the world, regarded as the all-embracing, ingrained, and only possi-\nble interpretation, are eventually adapted to newly established spatiotemporal con-\nstellations. However, these constellations lay the claim for applying national or\nterritorial logics of societal coexistence to increasingly deterritorialized living con-\nditions rather than simply territorially regulating them.\nOne of the most important contemporary tasks in social and cultural studies is\nthe establishment of and elaboration on new conceptions of the world that bring\nabout not only the sociocultural spheres but also the attendant political and every-\nday frameworks. This endeavor, however, also implies the uncoupling from tradi-\ntional and trusted conventions. Thus, the first and foremost goal is to dismantle and\ndiscard ideas and understandings of container space and to spatialize social and 2 Action, Knowledge, and Social Relations of Space 53\ncultural realities as the basic principles of world conceptualizations that have been\nall-encompassing for several centuries. It is not to promote practice-centered views\nand illustrate how actors relate to the world with and within the conventions of their\nactions.\nRelating to this shift in perception, other urgent issues such as sustainability and\nthe evaluation of human activities involving ecological questions will also have to\nbe renegotiated. Besides the consideration of social issues, the matter of decontain-\nerization will be essential to this process. In this respect, the nomenclature and\nconcepts of space and place and of nature and landscape cannot be regarded as logi-\ncally separable or independent.\nReferences\nBartels, D. (1968).

Chapter 3\nRationality and Discursive Articulation\nin Place-Making\nHuib Ernste\nLate-Modern Action-Theoretic Approaches and \u201cRational\u201d\nInterventions\nRationality is the ability to design, follow, and have knowledge about a systematic\nprocedure for the redemption of validity claims. In classical philosophy the term\ndenotes the ability of the mind in terms of reason ( nous, intellectus, Vernunft ) and\nrationality (l ogos, ratio, Verstand) (Mittelstra\u00df, 1 995, p. 470). The l ogos provides\nthe argumentation for the views one holds. Logos is the capacity not just for making\nstatements but also for providing their proofs, and a statement is proven by being\nderived as a conclusion from premises (Welsch, 1 999 ). But these premises them-\nselves cannot be secured through argumentation. It is here that reason comes in.\nTraditionally, reason is therefore conceived of as the faculty capable of guarantee-\ning these fi rst premises, by intuition (Plato) or induction (Aristotle). One could say\nthat reason provides the specifi city of the situation at hand, the context from which\nrationality is supposed to draw its conclusions.\nIt was the paradigmatically modern philosopher Immanuel Kant who, with his\nCopernican turn, stated that it is actually the other way around, that rationality pro-\nvides the constitutive categories and principles of cognition and that reason pro-\nvides only regulative ideas, through which one experiences particularities as parts of\na destined whole.1 In modernity, therefore, rationality is regarded as the most impor-\ntant ability, and reason can ultimately be done away with (Feyerabend, 1 987 ). Seen\nin this way, rationality autonomously establishes its own principles, methods, and\n1 I n Kant\u2019s terminology the idea of a soul prescribes us to link particular psychological appearances\nto a whole; the idea of a world prescribes us to connect all our singular observations to a unity\ncalled world; and, fi nally, the idea of God urges us to see things as result of a causal chain. Together\nthese ideas create a systematic unity in our perception (St\u00f6rig, 1 989 , p. 404).\nH. Ernste (*)\nDepartment of Human Geography , Radboud University , Nijmegen , The Netherlands\ne-mail: h.ernste@fm.ru.nl\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017 57\nP. Meusburger et al. (eds.), Knowledge and Action, Knowledge and Space 9,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44588-5_3 58 H. Ernste\nperspectives. In modernity it is also recognized that there is not just one single type\nof rationality but different types, which cannot be reduced to each other. Each type\ndetermines its own principles. Developing Kant\u2019s ideas about theoretical, practical,\nand aesthetic rationality further, Habermas (1 984) paradigmatically distinguished\nbetween cognitive, moral, and aesthetic rationality. Habermas built not only on\nKant\u2019s work but also on that of Max Weber, who fi rst made rationality a key concept\nin modernistic thinking and used the term specifi cally in the sense of purposive\nrationality or economic rationality, the meaning it is also often has in colloquial\nlanguage. It thereby denotes the strategic choice of the best means to reach a certain\ngoal. In this way rational decision-making became of central interest and positioned\nrationality and action theory as core concepts in high modernity. Weber elaborated\nthe role of rationality for individual everyday actions and called attention to the\ntendency toward disenchantment, that is, toward continuous differentiation and\nrationalization.\nRationalization in this sense designates a historical drive toward a world in which\n\u201cone can, in principle, master all things by calculation\u201d (Weber, 1919/1 946 , p. 136),\nby rational decision-making. This process of rationalization was not limited to the\neconomic sphere but was extended with its own rational logics also to law and\nadministration, the social and political spheres, and other domains. As a prerequi-\nsite, a peculiarly rational and intellectual type of personality or person of vocation\nwas presupposed. Modern scientifi c and technological knowledge slowly pushed\nback the germinating grounds of human knowledge, such as religion and metaphys-\nics, and created a culture of \u201cobjectifi cation\u201d (V ersachlichung ). At the same time,\nthere was a loss of substantive-value rationality, the emergence of a polytheism of\nvalue fragmentation, and the related tensions between these two developments, in\nother words, rationality without reason in practice.\nIt is in this framework that one must also situate geographical action theory as\nput forward by Benno Werlen (Chap. 2 , in this volume or 1987 , 1995 , 1997 ) in the\nphenomenological tradition of Alfred Sch\u00fctz (1 932 ). According to this school of\nthought, the internal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes\nmeanings to these objects, as people do through their everyday place-making and\neveryday spatially differentiated actions. This geographic action theory can be\ninterpreted as the subjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny\n(2 001 ) and Reckwitz (2 002 ) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory.\nThis approach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems\nfrom classical structuralism as exemplifi ed by de Saussure (1916/1 972 ) in linguis-\ntics, L\u00e9vy-Strauss (1 969 ) in anthropology, Althusser (1965/ 2005 ) and Emerson\n(1 984 ) in Marxist economics, and Piaget (1 970 ) in psychology. One could also add\nthe more contemporary version of psychological structuralism (Lacan, 2 002 );\nbehaviorist psychology (Skinner, 1 938; Watson, 1 913) ; and cognitive psychology\n(e.g., Broadbent, 1 987 ), including cognitive linguistics (Fauconnier, 1 999 ). The\napproach diverges from behavioral geography (Golledge & Stimson, 1 996) as well,\nfor which human behavior is an effect of structures in the unconscious mind in rela-\ntion to structured situations and is thus part of the objectivist mentalist tradition. 3 Rationality and Discursive Articulation in Place-Making 59\nI n geographic action theory, on the other hand, the assumption is that the active\nmind is in charge. In this case, however, the sources of spatial structurations are not\nunconscious cognitive structures in hard-wired reaction to external structures but\nrather the sequence of intentional acts as conscious decisions. The aim of analysis\nfrom the angle of this social phenomenology is to describe the voluntarist subjective\nact, mental interpretations of agents and subjective logics, and rationalities of\ndecision- making and behavior. This intentional goal-oriented kind of geographic\naction is thus clearly related to the late-modern project based on Weber\u2019s ideas of\nrationalization as a purely subjective mental process and individual rational inter-\nventions in the surrounding world. Even in Sch\u00fctz\u2019s (1 932 ) version of social phe-\nnomenology or Mead\u2019s (1 934 ) social behaviorist approach, in which meanings are\ngrounded in social relations, the individual subjective mind is still the seat of judg-\nment and rational choice. Mental structures and mental activities, therefore, are\ntreated as an incontestable \u201ccenter\u201d of social and spatial structuration (Reckwitz,\n2 002 , p. 247).\nHabermas\u2019s (1 984) stance on rationalization differs in this sense from Werlen\u2019s\napproach in that Habermas partly decenters rationalization from the individual sub-\nject to the pragmatics of social interaction. \u201cIn speech acts, the agents refer to a\nnon-subjective realm of semantic propositions and of pragmatic rules concerning\nthe use of signs\u201d (Reckwitz, 2 002, p. 249). For geography, this language-pragmatics\napproach was detailed by Zierhofer (2 002 ) and Schlottmann (2 007 ). This approach\ncan be seen as a critique of the pure mentalist program but does not reject it entirely,\nfor there are still interacting agents endowed with minds (Reckwitz, 2 002, p. 249).\nIn that sense one can speak of a further development in action theory or of late-\nmodernist views on rational action and intervention, where agency is partly decen-\ntered from the individual actor to external pragmatic procedures of interaction2 and\nstructural relationships within whose framework these interactions occur. Reckwitz\n( 2002, p. 249) and Moebius ( 2008, p. 67) call these intersubjective performative\napproaches i ntersubjectivism . A third stream of social theory in their systematics is\nbased on poststructuralist thinking.\nPoststructuralist Theories of Practice and \u201cCritical\u201d\nInterventions\nW ith the advent of poststructuralist thinking, there has been great reluctance to con-\nceptualize human behavior as conscious rational actions, and in most poststructural-\nist literature the term a ction is generally avoided. Systematic content analysis would\nprobably reveal a shift in the discursive use of the term even in those poststructural-\nist writings that do not explicitly address this change in conceptualization. Foucault\u2019s\nearly work, for example, shows a preference for the term p ractice rather than the\n2 T his understanding of rationality is not restricted to purposive economic rationality; it is refi gured\nas a praxial (pragmatic) form of rationality and rational critique (Schrag, 1 992 , p. 57\u201359). 60 H. Ernste\nterm a ction . In a seminal paper on this change, Schatzki et al. (2 001 ) even coined\nthe expression practice turn . Talking about practice instead of action indeed amounts\nto a novel picture of human agency and rationality (Reckwitz, 2008, p. 98) and\nopens up a certain way of seeing and analyzing social phenomena, which inevitably\nalso imply a certain political and ethical dimension. For lack of a better word,\nReckwitz, writing about theories of practice, describes this poststructuralist\nendeavor as t extualism . In contrast to Benno Werlen, with his subjective mentalist\napproach of geographical action theory, and to Zierhofer (2 002) , who advocated the\nlanguage-pragmatics approach in geography, poststructuralist thinkers do not tend\nto place structures inside the mind or in pragmatic procedures of interaction but\nrather \u201coutside\u201d it\u2014in chains of signs, in symbols, discourse, or text. The subject is\nthereby decentered even further, that is, into discourses about sign systems. These\ndiscourses are seen not as mere representations of mental qualities behind them but\nas a sequence of external events from which symbolic structures are manifested. In\na similar way, but with different arguments, Geertz\u2019s (1 973) symbolic anthropology\nand Luhmann\u2019s (2002/2 013 ) constructivist theory of social systems also focus on\nthe structural aspects of society outside the subject. What all these textualist\napproaches have in common is their critical perspective on the essentialization of a\nuniversal and fi xed principle of rationality and their celebration of the contextually\nand historically dependent logics of structuration and discursive meanings. But that\nis then their only critical thrust, and one could ask whether it spells the end of criti-\ncal rational deliberations or what will be next? To a certain degree the view of post-\nstructuralist thinkers is not that different from the late-modernist view of action\ntheory or from language pragmatics. The poststructuralists proceed along the same\nline, only going a bit further. They, too, advocate a plurality of kinds of rationality,\nand list a wide range of possible frames for action but do not describe them as types\nof rationality but rather as systems of meanings and logics of structurations of\npower. Furthermore, poststructuralists emphasize that there is no single standard\nversion of a given rationality, that each rationality contains multiple paradigms,\neach establishing its own set of principles, institutions, and lines of confl ict that\nneed to be taken into account.\nI n this context it is important to be aware that relationships between different\nplayers within this language game are described only in terms of power relations,\nwhich make it diffi cult to imagine some kind of metarationality regulating this plu-\nrality of differences. The relational sense in which Foucault and most of his post-\nstructuralist followers use the concept of power makes clear that power is everywhere\nand that it is not an attribute of individuals. Yet that understanding subsumes almost\nall relational issues under the highly ambiguous concept of power, reducing it to a\nmerely descriptive term and sapping most of its critical potential. Both late-modern\nand poststructuralist approaches thus lack of a metanarrative.\nHowever, what started as a reconceptualization of human actions as practices\u2014a\nchange that began in early poststructuralist approaches in order to counterbalance\nthe mentalist roots of action-theoretic approaches\u2014ultimately overstated structural-\nist effects of discursive systems of meaning and obscured rationality\u2019s critical\npotential to solve struggles of difference. Full-fl edged theories of practice as 3 Rationality and Discursive Articulation in Place-Making 61\ndiscussed by Schatzki et al. ( 2001 ) and Reckwitz ( 2002 ) are bids to fi nd a real bal-\nance between body and mind, things and knowledge, discourse and language prag-\nmatics, structure and process, and the agent and the individual.\nC urrent theories of practice constitute an effort to reformulate the Aristotelian\nconception of phronesis, which implies that practice is seen as the basis and purpose\nof theoretical knowledge (Flyvbjerg, 2 001) . That conception also implies an escape\nfrom the dualism of the subjective and objective (Bernstein, 1 971 ; Stern, 2 003 ,\np. 185). Schatzki is seen as one of the leading thinkers in this approach, and he bases\nhis practice theory on a new societal social ontology in which the dualism of onto-\nlogical individualism and holism is overcome (Schatzki, 2 006 ). He calls his new\nontology s ite ontology , defi ning s ite as a type of context in which human coexis-\ntence takes place and which also includes the social entities themselves. Social\nevents can thus be understood only through an analysis of this site. The close rela-\ntionship between this concept of site and the geographic concept of place (Tuan,\n2 001 ) is evident:\nPractice theory places practices at the center of the socio-human sciences instead of tradi-\ntional structures, systems, events, actions. None of the practices can be reduced to a sum of\nits elements, which are of a complex character: they are mental and material, factual and\nrelational, human and material, individual and supra-individual, etc. This conception also\novercomes the dualism action/structure,\u2026Each practice then operates in a typical regime,\naccording to particular scenarios, it has its inherent normativity, etc. (Vi\u0161\u0148ovsk\u00fd, 2 009 ,\np. 391)\nB ecause these particular practices are interlinked and intertwined, there arises\nthe issue of how one can rationally deal with this host of situations. With this ques-\ntion in mind, it is worthwhile to explore some of discourse theory\u2019s new develop-\nments that may be able to offer important answers.\nDiscursive Articulations and the Return of \u201cRational\u201d\nInterventions\nIn a review of different theoretical approaches to analyzing the restructuring of\nspace and place in urban regions in Hungary and England, Varr\u00f3 ( 2010 ) shows the\ngenealogy of what she called a \u201cPolitics of Space Approach\u201d (p. 59) based on appli-\ncation of discourse theory to the analysis of spatial change. Focusing chiefl y on\ndiscourse theory, she refers to the work of Laclau and Mouffe (1 985 ; see also\nAndersen, 2 003 ). Laclau and Mouffe draw on Gramsci\u2019s (1 992 ) concept of hege-\nmony, which denoted the capacity of the ruling class to eliminate oppositional\nforces by incorporating them into a collective will based on a shared system of\nmeanings (values, attitudes, beliefs, and morality). \u201cLaclau and Mouffe acknowl-\nedge, and carry forward, Gramsci\u2019s proposition to see collective will as formed\nthrough the articulation of various identities, i.e., processes where identities are\n\u2018brought together\u2019 and mutually modify each other\u201d (Varr\u00f3, 2 010 , p. 46). But they\ndisapprove of Gramsci\u2019s (1 992) class reductionism and the assumed dominance of 62 H. Ernste\neconomic relations in the making of space. Social and spatial identities are thus\nfundamentally \u201cunfi xed\u201d (p. 88) and are only partially fi xed through hegemonic\npractices of articulation. Discourse becomes \u201can attempt to dominate the fi eld of\ndiscursivity, to arrest the fl ow of differences, to construct a centre\u201d (Laclau &\nMouffe, 1985 , p. 112). Discourse can therefore be seen as the totality of an act of\nperformance, including linguistic and nonlinguistic elements (Laclau & Mouffe,\n1 987 ). This inclusiveness brings in an element of political, strategic, or deliberative\ninteraction and thus opens room for the process of rational deliberation, though\nLaclau and Mouffe (1 985 , 1 987) refrain from using the qualifi cation r ational for\nthis inherently political process of radical democracy. Jessop (1 990 ) and Howarth\n( 2004 , p. 271) have criticized Laclau and Mouffe (1 985 , 1 987 ) for not illustrating\nhow such a radical democracy can be characterized and institutionalized. Mouffe\n( 2005 ) does not get much further than stating that the crucial issue for democratic\npolitics is not the eradication of confl ict via consensus but rather the legitimation of\na multiplicity of opinions, attributions of meaning, and identities\u2014in short, the\nlegitimation of confl ict or a consensus on difference. His observation seems to\nimply that the potential hostility and a ntagonism of political forces is turned into\nagonism , where opponents are seen not as enemies to be destroyed but as legitimate\nadversaries whose ideas can be countered (Mouffe, 2 005 ). As Jacob Torfi ng (1 999 )\nobserved,\np ost-structuralist insights might help to sustain an a gonistic democracy that is capable of\ntransforming enemies into adversaries....the nomadization and hybridization of identity\nmight contribute to the dissolution of antagonistic frontiers (Mouffe, 1994, pp. 110\u2013111).\nNomadization refers to the attempt to undercut the allegiance of a specifi c identity to a\ncertain place or a certain property, and thereby to show that all identities are constructed in\nand through hegemonic power struggles. This will tend to denaturalize social and political\nidentities and make them more negotiable. Hybridization refers to the attempt to make\npeople realize that their identity is multiple in the sense of constituting an over-determined\nensemble of identifi cations. (p. 255)\nIn Laclau and Mouffe\u2019s thinking this idea of an agonistic democracy is also extended\nto their own normative claim for radical democratization, as the very nature of the\nprocess of radical democratization is itself part of an agonistic debate and depends\non a contingent, but at least largely shared, symbolic space (Mouffe, 2005 , p. 121).\nThis extension, however, still does not explain how such a political debate or delib-\neration takes place and what the radical democratic politics look like in action, not\njust as a starting point or outcome. At this juncture the interactionist outlook seems\nto be more useful. In general it is clear how the different traditions of social theory,\nranging from mentalist and interactionist to textualist points of view, each address\ndifferent complementary aspects of the political praxis put forward by Laclau and\nMouffe (1 985 ).\nT o develop this approach to praxis theory further, it is essential to rethink con-\ncepts of reason and rationality so as to create space for pluralistic forms of rational-\nity and for transversal refl ections (Welsch, 1 999) , even for rational interventions.\nThis space seems to have been obscured thus far by the concepts used by Laclau and\nMouffe (1 985) , which were inspired mainly by Marxist and poststructuralist 3 Rationality and Discursive Articulation in Place-Making 63\nthinking, and by some misinterpretation of the original concept of rationality in this\ncontext. Varr\u00f3 (2 010 ) noted a similar misunderstanding with respect to the concept\nof discourse between critical realist thinkers and discourse theorists.\nI n the de-essentialized and dynamic, but nevertheless highly structuralist and\nimprisoning, interpretation of discourses and practices reminiscent of early Foucault\n(1 972 ) and the practice turn (Schatzki et al., 2 001 ; Vi\u0161\u0148ovsk\u00fd, 2 009 ), there seems\nlittle space for rationality or reason in the traditional modernist sense. In this frame-\nwork, politics\u2014and thus also spatial politics\u2014seems to be defi ned primarily as\nauthority and power and seems to deal only with the effects of power relations and\nnot with the structure of the deliberations that take place in the framework of these\nrelations.\nAs part of the misunderstanding of rationality, rationality is seen only as a foun-\ndational universal concept, for it was forwarded by enlightenment at a time when\nreason had actually been expelled from the view of the human being\u2019s abilities to\ndeliberate about the world. However, Welsch (1 997 , 1999) prompted the question of\nhow to differentiate and judge the various systems of meaning and logics, or the\nvarious forms of rationality involved, without some all-embracing perspective.\nDistinctions and judgments based on any one of these types or paradigms of ratio-\nnality would necessarily misrepresent the others. Welsch suggested that there must\nbe a different type of functioning that underlies human refl ective capacity. It is this\ntype of refl ection that he reintroduced as reason, enhancing rationality\u2014or better,\nenhancing rationaliti es. In a seminal book written in the Anglo-Saxon tradition,\nSchrag (1 992) took up and endorsed this very specifi c kind of reason. Both scholars\ncalled it transversal reason (Schrag, 1 992 , p. 148; Welsch, 1 997 , p. 315). Because\ntransversal reason relates geographic realities and geographic differences to each\nother, it is crucial for the geographic perspective as well. As the refl exive ability to\nrecognize and clarify the differences as well as the relationships between the vari-\nous forms of rationality, transversal reason is actually a necessary condition for the\ntheory of plurality and difference.\nRelated to the current situation of plurality and hybridity, this kind of transversal\nreason is not a new invention but rather a skill that is increasingly used consciously\nor unconsciously in everyday practice and that is becoming more and more an inner\nconstituent of people\u2019s reasoning and life designs. The present age is not one seem-\ningly bereft of rationality but rather one in which reason and rationality are reunited\nas a mental and refl ective activity operating at every step of rational deliberation on\ndiscursive articulations.\nR eason and rationality are not two separate faculties, and in a sense are not faculties at all,\nbut rather signify different layers and functional modes of our refl ective activity. \u2018Reason\u2019\nrefers to the basic mechanism, \u2018rationality\u2019 to the various concrete, object-directed [or place\nrelated] versions of this activity. (Welsch, 1999 , Pt. III, sec. 5, par. 2)\nF rom this standpoint geography is primarily about developing these skills of\nreason and rational deliberation in a situation characterized by social and geograph-\nical diversity. The latest advances in social theory and in their operationalization in\nhuman geography\u2014possible to outline only very tentatively in this chapter\u2014yield 64 H. Ernste\na research program on human geography that combines several schools of thought\nwith that discipline\u2019s political commitment to create a knowledge base and refl ec-\ntive skills for subsequent rational interventions.\nConclusion\nT o conclude this chapter, I offer a summary of the main steps in my argumentation.\nFirst, I have tried to show that rationality was separated from reason during the\nphilosophical development of modernity and that it assumed a universal and fi xed\nprinciple of rationality. In late-modern times this discernment led to recognition of\ndifferent types of rationality, each with its own logics of deliberation and argumen-\ntation. Second, I have shown how these views are intricately involved in late- modern\ngeographical theories of action and in language-pragmatic approaches in geogra-\nphy. At the same time, I have pointed out the mentalistic inheritances of this\napproach. Third, I have noted that proponents of poststructuralist theories, in a quest\nto emphasize the structural aspects of discourses, seem to have totally done away\nwith rational deliberations. However, advocates of full-fl edged theories of practice\ndo not go that far and really seek a middle road. Fourth, I have tried to show that\nnewer forms of discourse theory in the tradition of Laclau and Mouffe (1 985 ) seem\nto offer this space for a real theory of practice and seem to reopen an opportunity for\nrefl ective political deliberations in the different fashions of discursive articulation.\nFinally, I argued that combining Laclau and Mouffe\u2019s discursive approach with new\nforms of rationalization that include transversal reason (Schrag, 1 992 ; Welsch,\n1997) might result in a framework for a rational approach to the politics of space as\na core business for human geographers.\nReferences\nAlthusser, L.

Chapter 4\nThought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought\nGunnar Olsson\nAn entire volume devoted to the theme of knowledge and action! What a gift and\nwhat a wonderful opportunity to return once again to the Olsson Laboratory of\nEpistemology and Ontology, to the company of the twin sisters of rhetoric and dia-\nlectics, to the mutating banana fl ies that by now have been with me for more than\nhalf a century. And what a fascinating, non-ending, and interesting adventure those\nyears have been, from beginning to end an attempt to understand how we under-\nstand, every day steeped in the hope of catching a glimpse of how we become what-\never we become.1\nB ut wait! What is it to be interesting, and where do I go to fi nd it? As so often\nbefore, the answer lies in the word itself, for the English term inter-esting stems\nfrom the Latin i nter esse, literally in-between-being. To be interesting is, conse-\nquently, to dwell in the razor-sharp limit between categories, to explore the trenches\nof the no-man\u2019s land of the excluded middle. Now, if I am courageous enough to\nenter that crater-strewn wasteland, and if I am curious enough to keep my eyes and\nears open, then I will eventually encounter a troupe of traveling magicians who to\ngreat applause are performing their magic tricks of ontological transformations, an\nantiphony of voices, some divine some other human. As the angels keep chanting\n1 I n what follows I will draw freely on the history of my own works, occasionally even quoting\nwithout quotation marks. In addition to the texts listed toward the end of this chapter, there is much\nto learn from GO: On the Geographies of Gunnar Olsson, a remarkable anthology edited by\nChristian Abrahamsson and Martin Gren ( 2012 ). It contains not only a representative selection of\nfacsimile reproductions of some of my own articles from 1967 to 2010 but also some brilliant\nilluminations set off by a long list of fi rst-rate pyrotechnists: Christian Abrahamsson, Trevor\nBarnes, Alessandra Bonazzi, Michael Dear, Marcus Doel, Franco Farinelli, Reginald Golledge,\nMartin Gren, Jette Hansen-M\u00f8ller, David Jansson, Gunnael Jensson, Ole Michael Jensen, Tom\nMels, Chris Philo, Michael Watts.

Olsson\ntheir wor(l)ds of \u201cLet there be\u2014and there was,\u201d the plebeians respond that \u201cV erum\nfactum \u2014the true is the made,\u201d indeed that to them something is true because they\nhave made it themselves. And in that perspective both Jahweh and Giambattista\nVico come out as what they really are\u2014expert jugglers of worlds which from one\nviewpoint are and from another are not, true creativity in both cases nothing but a\nspeech act through which the powerful can claim that something is something else\nand be believed when they do so. Knowledge is by defi nition an exercise in\ntranslation.\n\u201cWhat, then, is truth?\u201d asked Nietzsche in his essay O n Truth and Lie , immedi-\nately replying that truth is\na mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms\u2014in short, a sum of\nhuman relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and\nrhetorically, and which after long use seem fi rm, canonical, and obligatory to a people:\ntruths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors\nwhich are worn out and without sensuous power. (Penguin edition, 1976, pp. 46\u201347)\nWhereas the self-declared LORD created the world by uttering it\u2014light and\ndarkness, mountains and rivers, you and me, everything fl owing out of his mouth\u2014\nthe humpbacked Vico was a Neapolitan professor of rhetoric it is not only to\nAmerican pragmatists that meaning lies in practice and the paradigm of informative\ntruth in the fi nger-pointing index of a = b . The Kantian a s-if at work. Yet we must\nnever forget that although words may well change people, to things they do\nnothing.\nW hat follows will be structured as a retracing of routes taken, essentially a col-\nlage of vistas glimpsed in the distance. Nothing new, merely a dose of coherence\ndashed into a cocktail which to the afi cionados has been a source of intoxicating\nenlightenment, to the doubters a drug of impure ingredients and frightening side-\neffects. The recommended antidote is a product of the Nicomachean Pharmacy,\ndelivery a mouse-click away:\nIt is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as\nthe nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning\nfrom a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientifi c proofs.\nN ow each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good judge. And so\nthe man who has been educated in a subject is a good judge of that subject, and the man who\nhas received an all-round education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a\nproper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that\noccur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these; and, further, since he\ntends to follow his passions, his study will be in vain and unprofi table, because the end is\nnot knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or\nyouthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living, and pursuing\neach successive object, as passion directs.\n[These] remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected, and the purpose\nof the inquiry, may be taken as our preface. (Aristotle, trans. 1941, Book 1, Chapter 3,\n1094b and 1095a)\n*** 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 69\nBeware though, for the fact that the young man is young does not mean that he is\na tabula rasa. On the contrary, because like everyone else he is a product of his own\nupbringing: a palimpsest of impressions, layers upon layers of indicatives and\nimperatives; a ceaselessly over-painted canvas onto which the world is casting\nwhatever it is casting; a self-referential story composed in a mixed code of genetics\nand socialization, its nonachievable purpose to make us obedient and predictable, to\nturn you and me into exchangeable, yet unique, pieces in the ongoing game of one\nagainst many, us versus them. It is these traces of the taken-for-granted that function\nas an invisible map of the invisible, a library of the unconscious, a nontouchable\nguide that leads me through the unknown, rewards and punishments distributed\nalong the way. And as the explorer now moves on, (s)he gradually realizes not only\nthat the fi rst-person singular is the linguistic shifter par excellence but that this same\nI is the cartographers\u2019 fi x-point of fi x-points. Little wonder, therefore, that the world\nrefuses to sit still, for when pushed to the interesting limit of in-between-being I\ndiscover that I am one with my own map, its coordinate net constructed as the asym-\nmetric body of Leonardo\u2019s Vitruvian man, head up and feet down, eyes in front and\narse in the back, left hand to the left, the right to the right. Thus, therefore, spake\nZarathustra: \u201cYou say \u2018I\u2019 and you are proud of this word. But greater than this\u2014\nalthough you will not believe in it\u2014is your body which does not say \u2018I\u2019 but per-\nforms \u2018I\u2019\u201d (Nietzsche 1976 , p. 146; my rendering, Olsson, 1 991 , p. 122). Body\npolitics undressed, for most will agree that it is more honest to preach as you live\nthan to live as you preach.\nA circling tale of no beginning and no end, the taken-for-granted present every-\nwhere, visible nowhere. Thus it would indeed be strange if not I too were a product\nof my own time and place, in this case the Swedish welfare state of the postwar\ndecades. And even though by heritage, choice, and inclination I was never drawn to\nthe Social Democratic Party per se, it is impossible not to be impressed by its vision\nof equality and social justice, including the idea that the bright new world should be\nerected on a foundation of causal theories and well-calibrated models. Such were\nthe 1950s and early 1960s: the high noon of social engineering, the dream of a\nhappy marriage between scientifi c knowledge and political action come true, the\nmaximizing principles of utilitarian ethics institutionalized, Alva and Gunnar\nMyrdal the high priests in a congregation of politically anchored experts who took\nit as their mission to turn Sweden into a People\u2019s Home, a state of rationality in\nwhich the physical infrastructure (not least the architecture of the living quarters,\nespecially the kitchens and the communal washing-rooms) was designed to ensure\nthat the users would have no choice but to behave accordingly, at bottom a positivist\nbelief that the road to mental hygiene and proper thinking goes via the body, an\nideology well captured by Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m\u2019s (1 911 ) rejection of metaphysics and\nhis advocacy of value nihilism\u2014his well-known motto praetera censeo metaphysi-\ncam esse delendam , a paraphrase of Cato\u2019s \u201cCarthage must be destroyed.\u201d But not\neveryone was born with genes deemed good enough for the future, an argument\nwhich was readily extended to the widespread practice of forced sterilization.\nZeitgeist is the term, in the same breath an excuse and an accusation, for \u201cwhen I\nobey a rule, I do not choose. I obey the rule b lindly \u201d (Wittgenstein, 1 953 , p. 219). 70 G. Olsson\nTo the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood:\nCapture the power of social relations in a net of scientifi c laws and then, like your\nfriends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means\nnot merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural\nscientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know\nhow to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by\ntransplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar tech-\nniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to\nask yourself fi rst why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say\nabout physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of\nSophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and\nfears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowl-\nedge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotle\u2019s remark that we should look\nfor precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and\nthat it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician\nas to demand scientifi c proofs from a rhetorician?\nN o small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in\nlife and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could\nI possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON.\n*\nThe list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive\nscience, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spa-\ntial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked\ntogether in Walter Isard\u2019s conception of Regional Science and its extension into\nPeace Science, the latter fi rmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientifi c\nknowledge and political action, John Dewey\u2019s pragmatism and the collections of the\nBarnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome\nfellowship that in 1963\u20131964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs\nof the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern.\nG reat. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier\nby the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy\npupils to the concentric rings of von Th\u00fcnen\u2019s isolated state and the cost curves of\nAlfred Weber\u2019s isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth\nis that I can still feel in my body the boy\u2019s excitement when he literally s aw why\nthere were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr.\nThe rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von Th\u00fcnen\u2019s\nagricultural landscape depicted as an archer\u2019s target with the bull\u2019s eye as the central\ncity on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junker\u2019s own estate), Weber\u2019s fac-\ntory fi nding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center\nof a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and\nagglomeration. Deep roots it has, the subsequent defi nition of geography as a geom-\netry with names, essentially an exercise in the drawing and baptizing of points,\nlines, and planes. Picture and story merged into one. 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 71\nS o there it is, the glue of socialization decomposed: Vico\u2019s v erum factum \u2014the\ntrue and the made are convertible\u2014long before I knew the name; Wassily\nKandinsky\u2019s abstract expressionism as a social scientifi c practice years ahead of my\nfi rst visit to Dessau; Euclid\u2019s Q uod Erat Demonstrandum overruled by his Q uod\nErat Faciendum \u2014that which was to be demonstrated overruled by that which was\nto be shown\u2014the beliefs of the former lodged in the socialized mind, the convic-\ntions of the latter in the individual body. These fi x-points revealed, I can now better\nunderstand why once upon a time every Swedish school room was equipped with a\nblackboard, a ruler, a compass, and a square, these four implements serving as the\nteacher\u2019s pedagogical tools par excellence, to every generation after Plato the very\nkey to understanding how we understand. In that context of knowledge creation, it\nshould also be added that Immanuel Kant\u2014t he philosopher of limits\u2014often referred\nto his own work as a form of architecture. In my mind the three Critiques may prof-\nitably be read as a report from the masterbuilder\u2019s experiments with different con-\nstruction materials, one cement for the palace of pure reason, another for the house\nof practice, a third for the court of judgment.\nA nd this interplay of reasoning modes is exactly why August L\u00f6sch\u2019s D ie r\u00e4um-\nliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft (1943/ 1954) is such a groundbreaking book and why\nhe himself was such an exceptionally interesting person, the confl ict between\nJahweh and Vico embodied. As the 33-year-old put it in the fateful autumn of 1939:\nT he natural equilibrium of economics differs from the equilibrium of nature exactly as the\nmoral differs from the mechanical. Nature works according to laws, but man acts according\nto his idea of laws. In other words, nature m ust , man m ay , act correctly. In order to do so he\nmust have some conception of how he shall act. As to economic equilibrium this means that\nin order to guide his activities he needs insight into the conditions of this equilibrium . This\nis especially true for the lawmaker, since all others are bound by his precepts even though\nunable to perceive their rationality. (p. 93, emphasis in the original)\nWith that link between knowledge and action fi rmly established, L\u00f6sch then pro-\nceeded to the formulation of a general theory of location, a derivation based on the\nprinciple of profi t maximization rather than cost minimization, the lattice of nested\nhexagons its most spectacular outcome. As he put it in the book\u2019s preface, the math-\nematical calculations are there \u201cbecause it is reprehensible not to trust reason and\nrest content with vague words and hazy statements\u201d (p. xv). Heaving a sigh of relief\nthat the number of equations coincided with the number of unknowns, he neverthe-\nless exclaimed: \u201cIf only we had a method that combined the generality of equations\nwith the clarity of geometrical fi gures!\u201d (p. 100)\nT he rhetorical point is well taken: If I want to be believed, it is not enough to tell\na trustworthy story, I must also know how to paint the picture that goes with it.\nRephrased, the credibility of a given argument is immensely increased if it is\nexpressed not only in one but in both of the major modes of communication.\nTherefore,\ntheory may be compared with reality for various ends, according to the sort of theory held.\nIf it is to e xplain what actually is, the examination attempts to discover whether it started\nwith a correct idea of its subject and arrived at an explanation that not only seemed possible\nbut also corresponded with reality. On the other hand, if theory is to c onstruct what is 72 G. Olsson\nr ational, its assumptions may still be tested by facts, but not its results. Its author can dis-\ncover from an examination of the facts whether he has built on adequately broad experi-\nence, whether he has taken all objective or subjective essentials into consideration. His\nprocedure resembles the preliminary work of an architect, who cannot lightly neglect the\ncharacteristics of a site, the laws of nature, and the wishes of the owner. But a comparison\nwith existing structures will not show whether his blueprints are accurate; in our case, that\nis, whether the theoretical structure has been properly erected. For the existing structure\nmay be as faulty as the projected one. No! Comparison now has to be drawn no longer to\ntest the theory, but to test reality! (L\u00f6sch, 1943/1 954 , pp. 363\u2013364, emphasis added)\nGerman idealism lodged in a thinker who has been described as\na combination of rare strength of character, intellect, and warmth of personality, [a man]\nwho died shortly after the end of the hostilities on May 30, 1945, at least partially as the\nresult of that very strength of character which forbade him to make any compromises with\nthe National Socialist regime. (Hoover in L\u00f6sch, 1943/ 1954 , p. vii)\nH is hands tied, it was the mind that carried him back to the place where his uncon-\nscious had been formed. In L\u00f6sch\u2019s own words:\nIt was not easy for me largely to forego the attractive task of applying what has thus been\ntested to our more complicated German conditions and analyzing the pertinent facts. But\napart from all foreign studies [mainly based on U.S. data] and the wide applicability of the\nresulting ideas, my youthful experiences in a little Swabian town constitute the real back-\nground of this book. [To] have my original experiences there confi rm my fi nal theories\ngives me a real sense of security, and so I dedicate this book to the land of my birth, the land\nthat I love. (L\u00f6sch, 1943/1 954 , pp. xv\u2013xvi)\nIt is diffi cult not to cry, especially if one compares the fate of L\u00f6sch\u2019s life and\nwork (1906\u20131945) with that of Walter Christaller (1898\u20131969), the fi rst edition of\nL\u00f6sch\u2019s Die r\u00e4umliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft appearing in 1940, the second edi-\ntion in 1943, Christaller\u2019s D ie zentralen Orte in S\u00fcddeutschland in 1 933 . In the\npresent context of thought-in-action, it is simply impossible to ignore the fact that\nwhereas L\u00f6sch paid a high price for his refusal to swear a personal oath of alle-\ngiance to the F\u00fchrer, Christaller\u2019s political views (hence by extension his built-in\nattitudes to intentional action) were fl uttering in the wind, like the LORD himself\nconsistently inconsistent. The record is there for anyone to inspect. First, the\ntrenches of World War I turned Christaller into a card-carrying Social Democrat.\nSecond, in the summer of 1934, when that party had been banned, he fl ed on his\nbicycle to the liberty of France, from where he was promptly lured back to a job\noffered him by Konrad Meyer, an SS professor of agronomy, who already at that\nstage was working directly under Heinrich Himmler. Third, in the summer of 1940\nChristaller joined the National Socialist Party (membership number 8 375 670).\nFourth, immediately after the war that same(?) person enrolled as a member of the\nWest German Communist Party and in 1953 was accused of collaborating with his\ncomrades in the DDR. Fifth, after 14 years as a Communist he resurrected himself\nas a Social Democrat, just in time for his plenary lecture at the historic meeting of\nthe International Geographical Union Symposium in Urban Geography in Lund,\nSweden, in August 1960. To only partial avail, however, for even though the conver-\nsion might have paved the way to an honorary doctorate at Lund, it failed to get him 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 73\nthe visa that would have taken him to the United States and the lecture tour of his\nlife. Broken was the icon when the young man met him about 5 years before he\npassed away, the sadness of his eyes forever etched into my memory.\nW ater in water, a palimpsest hard to decipher, a mille-feuille bound to cause\nindigestion. But who am I to judge? What does a Swede born in 1935 know of blar-\ning sirens, exploding bombs, ruins, terror, death camps, starving children without\nshoes? As so often before, I am once again drawn into Wittgenstein\u2019s struggle with\nsolipsism:\nI am my world. There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertains ideas. If I\nwrote a book called The World as I found it, I should have to include a report on my body,\nand should have to say which parts were subordinate to my will, and which were not, etc.,\u2026\nThe subject does not belong to the world: rather it is a limit of the world.... There is no a\npriori order of things. (Wittgenstein, 1921/1 961 , 5.63\u20135.632, 5.634)\n***\nD rawing the limits of the world is exactly what the joint history of human geog-\nraphy and regional planning is about. And in that essentially political enterprise\nreferences to central place theory have often been used to legitimate some drastic\nintrusions into the daily lives of entire populations. All for their own good, of course.\nF or understanding these connections between text and context, it is important to\nknow that Christaller\u2019s and L\u00f6sch\u2019s shared goal was to detail how a given area is\ncolonized or settled, especially how a set of hierarchically nested and hexagonally\ndistributed centers are (or, more accurately, s hould be) tied together into a func-\ntional whole. In that sense they were more immediately concerned with the geom-\netry of the stage than with the actors\u2019 movements across it, more focused on\nscenography than on dialogue. The outcome was in both cases a script of power.\nAnd for that reason the critic should never forget that\nw hat distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect raises his\nstructure in the imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labor-process,\nwe get a result that already existed in the imagination of the laborer at its commencement.\nHe not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realizes\na purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subor-\ndinate his will. (Marx, 1867/1 967 , vol. I, p. 178)\nA n outstanding example comes from the Dutch polders, lands reclaimed from\nthe sea and therefore at constant risk of being fl ooded. That likelihood must, of\ncourse, be carefully controlled and the condition of the dikes and pumps minutely\nmonitored, a duty which since the eleventh century has been entrusted to an espe-\ncially elected local authority appropriately called the H oogheemraadschap . By law\na modus operandi to which everyone must subordinate their will, the oldest demo-\ncratic institution in the country.\nThese newly reclaimed lands are obviously both fl at and nonpopulated, hence as\nclose to the theoreticians\u2019 conception of a homogeneous plain as any social engineer\ncould ever dream of. And exactly as the Marx quotation suggests, the planners actu-\nally d id raise the structure of the new villages, towns, and cities in their imagination 74 G. Olsson\nbefore they erected them in reality, a wonderful illustration of how the abstractness\nof Platonic forms is turned into the concreteness of visible objects. Seemingly a\ntextbook application of practical reason, the intentionality of the plan preserved in\nthe materiality of physical structures. Only seemingly, though, for in the case of the\nearly Zuiderzee polders the impact of technological change was seriously underes-\ntimated. To make a long and complicated story short and simple, the constructed\nplaces proved to be too many, too small, and too closely packed, the location of the\nbrick-built stores, schools, police stations, and hospitals obsolete before the mortar\nhad dried. In addition, and because roads and houses are costly both to build and to\ntear down, the spatial nonoptimality tends to stick. T he Achilles-heal of every opti-\nmizing location theory.\nL\u00f6sch\u2019s remarks about the comparison between rational theory and faulty reality\ncome readily to mind, Hegel\u2019s epistemology of self-conscious reevaluation as well.\nThe reason is that the planning of the later polders, especially the Oostelijk and the\nZuidelijks Flevolands, has become increasingly sophisticated. But that development\nrather heightens than lessens my surprise that Christaller\u2019s static, deterministic, and\ninelegant theory was used at all. The only excuse I can think of is that we are all\nchildren of our own time and place, the Dutchmen of 1930 as much as I at eighty.\nAnd what a happy circumstance that is. For what saved the subjects of the great\npolder project was not the machinations of social engineering but the circumstance\nthat Holland is an open society, its citizens free to design their honeycombs as their\nfancy fancies.\nI n that respect the Third Reich was obviously different. But what richer pasture\ncould the likes of Konrad Meyer and Walter Christaller have wished for than the\nnewly conquered L ebensraum (living space) of Eastern Europe, a vast area show-\nered down on them as a gift from the F\u00fchrer\u2019s heaven. Like the Dutch polders, also\nthe territory that the R eichskommissariat f\u00fcr die Festigung deutschen Volkstums\n(Reich Commission for German Resettlement and Population Policy) was commis-\nsioned to settle had the characteristics of a homogeneous plain, the techniques of\nethnic cleansing as merciless in Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine as any-\nwhere else. The clearing of suffi cient living space in the East was de facto the cor-\nnerstone of Nazi foreign policy, the very precondition for the Germanization that\nwas meant to follow, the E ntfernung (removal) of foreign elements setting the stage\nas effectively as the digging of the dikes in Holland. As an amateur artist, Hitler\nsurely knew that without a properly prepared canvas there will never be any paint-\ning. And as the Leader of a populist movement he was well aware that no political\nbattle is more decisive than that about the boundary between identity and difference,\none and many, us and them, me and you. Such was consequently also the purpose of\nthe charts, tables, and maps that came out of Meyer\u2019s offi ce: the utopia of a totalitar-\nian H errschaft (rule) projected into optimally located settlements, everything and\neveryone in its proper place. Seventy-fi ve years later the whole affair strikes me as\na Dadaesque blend of Kandinsky\u2019s Bauhaus, Malevich\u2019s suprematism, Picasso\u2019s\ncubism, Ernst\u2019s surrealism. The irony of the entartete Kunst (degenerate art) in its\nproper perspective. 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 75\nT he outline of this new world was drawn in G eneralplan Ost (General Plan for\nthe East), a strictly confi dential document prepared in the period 1939\u20131942, delib-\nerately destroyed in May 1945 lest it be used as incriminating evidence, by later\nhistorians eventually pieced together again. It consisted of two parts, the Small Plan\nwhich covered actions to be taken during the Blitzkrieg , and the Big Plan which\noutlined what was to follow in the 30-year period thereafter. The text of the latter is\nsimply too much for sensible analysis (a total of 31 million undesirables to be\nmoved to West Siberia, the remaining to be treated as slaves), but the fi gures of the\nformer are even more staggering. (Between October 12 and December 31, 1939,\nabout 1,700,000 Jews and Poles were actually deported to places with names now\nwell known, another fi ve million classifi ed as unsuitable for assimilation.) The\nmachinelike horrors of the E ntfernung set the stage not merely for what was m eant\nto come but for what actually d id come.\nI t is now well established that Walter Christaller was directly involved in the\nGerman settling of Warthegau, the Polish territory occupied by the German forces\nin September 1939\u2014a story forcefully told by Barnes ( 2015) and much elaborated\nin the works of Bauman (1 989 ), Kamenetzky (1 961 ), Madajcyk (1 994 ), R\u00f6ssler\n(1 989 ), and many others. A moment of truth for any theoretician eager to see his\nabstract imaginations metamorphosed into concrete reality. Yet nothing compared\nto what was to come with Christaller\u2019s appointment to the staff of Konrad Meyer,\nthe mentor who under Himmler\u2019s personal supervision was charged with the task of\nfi nalizing the plans for the still unconquered L ebensraum . Included in the directives\nwas the megalomaniac idea of a fortifi ed string of SS garrisons and \u201cpearl settle-\nments\u201d that would run all the way from Arkhangelsk on the Northern Dvina River\nto Astrakan in the Volga delta, the \u00dc bermenschen (superior humans) in the west\nsecurely separated from the U ntermenschen (subhumans) in the east. The surviving\nrecords occasionally refer to Christaller\u2019s theory, but there is no explicit mention of\nany detailed plans; who knows, perhaps they were not Aryan enough. Crucial\nindeed, for every judgment of guilt and punishment should be based on the here-\nand- now of particular circumstances, not on the there-and-then of general princi-\npals. On the surface a matter of alternative descriptions, deeper down an entangled\nskein of modal logics.\nIt is the struggle with the latter that now brings me to the intricacies of the word\ncan , like all modal verbs of vital importance to any critique of power, by extension,\nto any worthwhile understanding of the relations between knowledge and action\n(Ofstad, 1961, pp. 328\u2013337; see also Olsson, 1980, pp. 118b\u2013115b). The reason is\nthat the \u201call-in can\u201d (forty-seven of them) is essentially a combination of two \u201csub-\ncans,\u201d one denoting ability, the other opportunity. For instance, there is no doubt that\nWalter Christaller already in 1933 knew how to deduce an optimal settlement pat-\ntern from a set of (un)realistic assumptions, but it was only after Hitler\u2019s D rang\nnach Osten (drive toward the east) that he got a chance to apply his knowledge and\nin that manner show the world who he really was. Hand in glove, a temptation hard\nto resist, a mixture of pleasures and nightmares, a situation he shared with many\nothers, Martin Heidegger most prominent among them. The pivotal question is, of\ncourse, whether, given the circumstances, he could have acted otherwise. If not, he 76 G. Olsson\nshould not be held responsible, regardless of his political (in)stability. Purgatory has\nmany chambers, and in some congregations you get to Paradise because of your\nbeliefs, in others because of your deeds. \u201cIn this connection,\u201d wrote Albert Speer\n(1969/1 970) in a passage of direct relevance for the assessment of spatial\nplanning,\nI must mention [Hitler\u2019s] plan for founding German cities in the occupied areas of the\nSoviet Union. On November 24, 1941, in the very midst of the winter catastrophe, Gauleiter\nMeyer [Alfred, not Konrad], deputy of Alfred Rosenberg, the Reich Minister for the occu-\npied eastern territories, asked me to take over the section on \u2018new cities\u2019 and plan and build\nthe settlements for the German garrisons and civil administrations. I fi nally refused this\noffer at the end of 1942 on the grounds that a central authority for the city planning would\ninevitably lead to a uniform pattern. I insisted instead that the great German cities each\nstand as sponsor for the construction of the new ones. (p. 182)\nFor Oberf\u00fchrer Konrad Meyer-Hertling the situation was less clear. Like Speer,\nhe too was convicted at Nuremberg, but unlike the genius of organizational dynam-\nics, his crimes were deemed so small that immediately after the trial he was set free\nfor time served, a whitewash paper written by Walter Christaller being part of the\nevidence. In the judges\u2019 opinion Meyer\u2019s contribution to G eneralplan Ost was \u201ca\nstrictly independent scientifi c study\u201d (R\u00f6ssler, 1989 , p. 427)\u2014in Marx\u2019s dialectics\nsomething imagined that never made it into reality; in my own terminology, an\nontological transformation aborted.\nN o serious wrong-doing proven and in 1956 the University of Hanover appointed\nMeyer Professor Ordinarius (full professor) of Land Planning, a post he occupied\nuntil his retirement. The pragmatism of expert knowledge and political action\nundressed, H. C. Andersen\u2019s emperor as he must have appeared to the lackeys, who\ncontinued to carry the fabulous train that did not exist. The boys in the gutter saw it\ndifferently. For even though they had never attended Meyer\u2019s and Christaller\u2019s alma\nmaters, they still knew that ethics is the only ordered discourse that has thought-\nand- action as its defi ning subject matter. In addition, they were soon to learn the\nFoucauldian lesson that it is in the prison and madhouse that we discover what is\nnormal, indeed what it means to be human. As Arendt (1 977) put it, there are strong\nstreaks of banality in evil; the institutions of modernity a precondition for the\nHolocaust. It is telling that Heidegger\u2019s postwar critique of technology paid much\nattention to the verb c an and its tendency to turn into a m ay, the m ay into an o ught ,\nthe ought into a shall , the shall into a must .\n***\nM ind-boggling are the German vignettes, the offered interpretations part and\nparcel of the same epistemology of extremity that for 50 years has served me so\nwell. Come to think of it, it may well be that same attitude that has made me less\nresponsive to the political calls for changing the world and more focused on the hid-\nden in my own taken-for-granted, the latter the only critique that to my solipsist\nmind is honest enough. That remark is obviously not an excuse for the shallowness\nof what I have just written about Hitler, Himmler, Meyer, and Christaller, merely a\nway of saying that it is by detecting the beam in my neighbor\u2019s eye that I become 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 77\naware of the mote in my own. And what a painful experience that is, learning to roll\nwith the punches, a technique which Marlene Dietrich practiced to perfection:\nIt\u2019s not cause I wouldn\u2019t\nIt\u2019s not cause I shouldn\u2019t\nAnd you know it\u2019s not cause I couldn\u2019t\nIt\u2019s simply because I\u2019m the laziest gal in town.\nI n that mood I shall now proceed to the spatial set-up of the Swedish welfare\nstate. As Shakespeare (1602/n .d.) put it in T he Merry Wives of Windsor, \u201cthe world\u2019s\nmine oyster, Which I with sword will open\u201d (Act II, Scene II, 2\u20133).\n*\nThe story goes a long way back, not least to Gustav Eriksson Vasa, the guerilla\nleader who in 1523 threw the Danes out, united the Swedes into one country, and let\nhimself be elected king to crown it off. Once that goal had been achieved, he faced\nthe problem of paying back the money he had borrowed to fi nance his campaign, a\nproblem he solved by confi scating the riches of the Church, converting to the\nLutheran faith, and translating the Bible in the process. An expert in Machiavellian\nrhetoric and the logistics of tax collection, he penetrated so deeply into the minds of\nhis subjects that a Swede of the twentieth century readily recognizes the similarities.\nAllt f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras, allt f\u00f6rblir \u00e4nd\u00e5 det samma , or, as the French have it, P lus \u00e7a change,\nplus \u00e7a reste la m\u0207me chose , alternatively, the more things change, the more they\nstay the same. In the farewell speech Gustav gave to Parliament on June 16, 1560:\nI know that in the minds of many I have been a harsh king. But the times shall come when\nthe children of Sweden will want to tear me up from the ground, were that within their\nmight. I also know that the Swedes are quick to agree and late to question. I predict that\nmany pretenders and false prophets will be forthcoming. Therefore I beg and advise you:\nStick fi rmly to God\u2019s words. Listen carefully to your superiors and stand united together.\nMy days will soon be gone. For telling me that I need neither stars nor any other sorcery. I\nfeel in my body the signs that I will soon be taken away. Follow me then with your sincere\nprayers and, when I have closed my eyes, let my body rest in peace. (Retrieved November\n10, 2015, from h ttp://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasakoret , my translation)\nQuick to agree and late to question, well organized by their superiors.\nFollowing in his grandfather\u2019s footsteps was Gustavus Adolphus, in 1632 killed\nin the mist-enveloped battle at L\u00fctzen, his military forays clearly proving that\nSweden from then on was a power to reckon with. The road to success was forged\nby his genial chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, the man who invented the administrative\nset-up that made it all possible, its basic outline still with us.\nI t is this historical stickiness that now prompts me back to the 1950s and some\nfundamental problems which Christaller\u2019s theory was then called upon to settle. To\nput it very simply, the old parishes and communes\u2014often with boundaries\nunchanged since Oxenstierna\u2019s time\u2014was a harness too small for the expanding\nwelfare state. Something had to be done, and on January 1, 1952, the number of\nrural communes was cut from 2281 to 816. Not enough, however, and 10 years later\na new and wider reform was set in motion, the number of communes (including the\ntowns and cities) presently down to 290. 78 G. Olsson\nThese administrative reforms have had a revolutionary impact on the daily life of\nevery Swede, the redrawing of the political boundaries directly related to the where,\nwhen, and how you happen to be born; to the when, where, and how you will even-\ntually die; to every whatever that may or may not lie in-between. The underlying\nideology is, of course, that just as all citizens should have equal rights regardless of\nwhether they are rich or poor, so the same should hold regardless of where they hap-\npen to live. No small deal but a tacit admission that the whereness of spatial form\nbears directly on the whatness of social relations. Whether form follows function or\nfunction follows form is in that perspective a moot point, the geographer\u2019s inference\nproblem when it matters.\nThe blueprint of this brave new world was drawn by a politically appointed com-\nmittee supported by a set of experts, the result submitted to the Minister of the\nInterior as number 1961:9 of Statens Offentliga Utredningar \u2014The State\u2019s Offi cial\nInvestigations. The pivotal parts of this document were written by Sven Godlund\nand Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand, two up-to-date geographers who explicitly anchored their\nreasoning in Christaller\u2019s theory. Their basic argument was that whereas the drastic\nchanges in transportation technology had led to novel forms of shopping behavior\nand thereby to the spontaneous establishment of larger market areas, the administra-\ntive units were legally sanctioned leftovers from a previous era\u2014the commercial\nsystem was effi cient, open, and modern; the legal was outdated, closed, and obso-\nlete. The committee therefore recommended that the boundaries of the latter should\nbe redrawn to coincide with the hinterlands of the former. And in that twist from the\neconomist\u2019s is to the politician\u2019s ought , the play was changed in the middle of the\nact, the utopian dreams of justice disappearing in the wings, fatally stabbed by the\nreality it was supposed to replace. Exit man with his precious visions, hopes, and\nfears. Enter the Thiessen polygons with their crude distance minimizations and\ncost-benefi t ratios. Ideology and methodology in profound and irresolvable\nconfl ict.\nThe root of the problem lies in the social gravity model, a formulation which in\nthe heydays of the 1960s lay at the frontier of quantitative geography, the page-\nturner of my own conception of thought-in-action and action-in-thought. Although\noriginally conceived as an analogue to Newton\u2019s law of gravitation\u2014the interaction\nbetween two objects directly proportional to the size of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance between them\u2014its social science applica-\ntion a special case of Vilfredo Pareto\u2019s optimality principle, the latter a sociological\ngeneralization with deep roots in the mathematics of the negative exponential (see,\ne.g., Arrow, 1 951 ; Sen, 1 993 ). The irony is that even though Pareto, H\u00e4gerstrand,\nand Godlund knew perfectly well that they were describing the world as it was,\nItalian fascists and Swedish democrats read their texts as recipes for how a better\nworld could be constructed. As Marx put it, the philosophers have hitherto only\ninterpreted the world, the point is to change it. This (mis)reading was in no way\ninevitable, for Pareto argued very explicitly that observed behavior belongs to the\nsame category of \u201clogical action\u201d as economic profi t maximization, Machiavellian\npolitics, and scientifi c work. But to sanctify observed behavior as logical action is\nnothing but a rhetorical technique for legitimating the status quo. The history of the 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 79\nsocial gravity model provides an excellent example, for although in the beginning it\nwas treated as a formulation of great explanatory power, later generations have\ncome to see it as an expression of autocorrelation. As Tobler\u2019s ( 1970 ) fi rst law of\ngeography has it, \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are more\nrelated than distant things\u201d (p. 236). A planning tool tailor-made for unintended side\neffects.\nI n that perspective Pareto\u2019s conception of logic appears just as narrow as the\ndogma of any other religion. Rather than perpetuating the belief that the reasoning\nrules represent objective and unassailable a priori principles, we must therefore con-\nstantly remind ourselves that they are neither ethically nor aesthetically neutral. If\nwe are prepared for that volte-face, then we too, like Vico, Nietzsche, and Heidegger\nbefore us, will discover how it is grammar that tells us what kind of object anything\nis, not the other way around. As a consequence, we will then understand that the\nrole of all languages, deductive logic included, is not to furnish labels for the objects\nwe are talking a bout but to shape the categories we are thinking and talking i n . And\nthus it is by no coincidence that the tautological a = a is the linchpin of conventional\nlogic just as the evasive I am who I am is the self-proclaimed name of God the\nFather. And so it is that every concept is a tool of human making, intelligible only\nin the context of our personal and social lives.\nIf we dare not admit that our analytical languages have these characteristics, then\nwe run the risk of imposing on reality a strictness that it neither has nor ought to\nhave. And if in our many-facetted roles as experts, citizens, and social engineers we\nchoose to ignore this hallmark of critical theory, then we will inevitably produce a\nsociety that both mirrors the techniques by which we measure it and echoes the\nlanguages in which we talk about it. By extension a dystopia of human puppets with\nno dreams to dream and nothing to be sorry for. And thus it is that Pareto\u2019s ought\ncohabits with the i s of the elite, exactly as it was propagated in the ethical theory of\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m ( 1911 ; see also Marc-Wogau, 1 968 ) and the legal principles of\nLundstedt (1 932\u2013 1936) and Olivecrona (1 942) , legitimating shapers of Swedish\nideology. The outcome is that the law of large numbers rules supreme, the emerging\nrelations between individual and collective a classic case of double bind. And in that\nsense the negative exponential serves the purposes of populists and elitists alike.\nThe utilitarians should be more cautious, for it is the very kernel of their ethics that\nevery act should be judged in terms of its consequences, not in terms of the inten-\ntions behind it.\n*\nThe statistics are equivocal, especially when it comes to education and health\ncare, by all accounts key ingredients of any welfare system. Thus, there is general\nagreement that the Swedish school system is in deep crisis, the results no longer at\nthe top of the evaluations generated by the OECD\u2019s Programme for International\nStudent Assessment (PISA) but regularly below average and steadily sliding; among\nthe 40 countries listed in the 2013 evaluation, Sweden is ranked as number 36 in\nreading and 38 in mathematics. Little wonder that in a press release (May 4, 2015)\nthe OECD concluded that 80 G. Olsson\nSweden has failed to improve its school system despite a series of reforms in recent years.\nA more ambitious, national reform strategy is now urgently needed to improve quality and\nequity in education....No other country taking part in PISA has a steeper decline. (Retrieved\nNovember 10, 2015, from par. 1\u20132, h ttp://www.oecd.org/Sweden/Sweden-should-urgently-\nreform-its-school-system-to-improve-quality-and-equity.htm )\nM uch to mourn but most alarming are the fi gures that Swedish eighth-graders\u2019\ncommand of mathematics is now at the same level as that of seventh graders\u2019 a\ndecade earlier and that one quarter of the boys fail to comprehend what they are\nreading. The social and economic inequalities are following suit, a new class of\nunemployables growing up, a development most pronounced in the ethnically seg-\nregated areas of Malm\u00f6 and Stockholm. Counterfi nality is the term for the mis-\nmatch between intentionality and consequence, the infected sore of utilitarian ethics\nand the source of an intense debate with immediate ties to the administrative reforms\nof the 1960s. The turning point came in 1991 when the political c um administrative\nresponsibility for the schools was shifted from the state to the local municipalities,\na reorganization that in one stroke\u2014and very deliberately\u2014lowered the status of\nthe teachers. The result is that more than half of them are offi cially unqualifi ed for\ntheir jobs! An ocean liner to turn around, the T itanic heading for the iceberg.\nI n the meantime the health-care system is struggling with an attitudinal problem\nof its own. To be precise, the 2011 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy\nSurvey of eleven comparable countries placed Sweden at the bottom of the list in\nterms of health-care availability. Similar fi gures hold for the sense of dignity,\nrespect, and empathy that the patients thought they had the right to expect but did\nnot receive, one third of the doctors demonstrating that they knew little or nothing\nabout their clients\u2019 medical history. Since with growing age we tend to forget fi rst\nwhat we learned last, many immigrants from the 1950s, now in nursing homes, have\nlost their Swedish and are therefore, unbeknownst to themselves, reverting back to\ntheir mother tongues, idioms typically unknown to their helpers. Sadder than sad,\nthe art of dying a question of chairos rather than chronos , an issue of the right\nmoment rather than the orderlies\u2019 work schedule. But just as eugenics is not eutha-\nnasia, so euthanasia is not suicide.\nI n the meantime all surveys agree that although everyone considers the level of\nexpert medicine to be outstanding, the proportion of patients who doubt that they\nare receiving the best treatment available is higher in Sweden than in any of the\ncomparable countries, the sense of shared trust no longer what it used to be. To put\nit bluntly, Swedish health care sees a diagnosis, not a human being. Political dyna-\nmite, not least because the degree of (dis)satisfaction varies between socioeconomic\ngroups\u2014the higher the education, the higher the trust, the professors of geography\nand anesthesia the best of friends. Human, all too human. Gustav Vasa echoes back:\nListen carefully to your masters, be quick to agree and late to question. But there is\nan echo of T he Phenomenology of Mind as well, for\nj ust as lordship shows its essential nature to be the reverse of what it wants to be, so too,\nbondage will, when completed, pass into the opposite of what it immediately is: being a\nconsciousness repressed within itself, it will enter itself, and change around into real and\ntrue independence. (Hegel, 1807/ 1967 , p. 237) 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 81\nH egel\u2019s remarks notwithstanding, the empirical truth remains: The values of the\nstrong today are metamorphosed into the facts for the weak of tomorrow. The point\nis not that the Swedish welfare state is a tragedy but that it is s tructured like a trag-\nedy: everything beautifully right in the beginning, everything horribly wrong at the\nend, no one to blame in between. To understand human action is therefore not to\nblame but to see that actors are so entrenched in their roles that they take the shadow\nplay for reality and reality for the play. It is indeed an integral part of all internal\nrelations (logic and money being paradigmatic examples) that we obey their com-\nmands without hearing them and without knowing where they come from. And for\nthat reason I am eternally grateful that I was born in Per Albin Hansson\u2019s Sweden\nand not in Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany or Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union. But this fortu-\nnate circumstance must not keep me from realizing that everything comes with a\nprice, the politics of the welfare state included. For instance: How do I insult a\npower which is so powerful that it is faceless? How do I learn about difference when\ndifference is defi ned away? How do I topple a regime that has no statues erected in\nits honor? How do I fi nd my way in a jungle of paragraphs? How do I live in a cul-\nture so proud of its penis that it is unaware of its Phallus? Why is it so hard to detect\nthe relations between the N om-du-P\u00e8re and the Non-du-P\u00e8re ?\nServitude and (in)equality exposed, King Oedipus blood-soaked before us.\n***\nO n my reading, Sophocles\u2019 O edipus Tyrannus (ca. 440 BC) is a paradigmatic\nexample of Bertrand Russell\u2019s theory of proper names and defi nite descriptions, his\nformula for how a given statement can at the same time be both true and informa-\ntive. And in this sense the tragedian and the atheist are alike that both were driven\nto truth by their ignorance of truth, their engagements a relentless pursuit of knowl-\nedge no matter where it would lead them. From beginning to end a struggle with\ntautology, the latter by defi nition always true but never informative.\nIn the play\u2019s prologue, Oedipus, the king with the swollen foot, he who once had\nsaved the city from the sphinx, is asked to become what he had once been before. In\nthe petitioner\u2019s words:\nYou are not one of the immortal gods, we know;\nYet we have come to you to make our prayer\nAs to the man surest in mortal ways.\n[Once], years ago, with happy augury,\nYou brought us fortune; be the same again!\n(Sophocles, trans. 1 949 , pp. 4\u20135)\nO n this occasion the charge is to save the city from the plague. But whereas solving\nthe riddle of the Sphinx had led him to the dignity of man, solving the problem of\nthe plague will take him to himself. In his search he is pushed to truth by his blind-\nness to truth, and, when he fi nally sees it, he blinds himself, thereby to see more\nclearly. At the end he saved the city but destroyed himself, neither result on purpose,\neven though everything started with a purpose. All is fate, except that each step\nalong the way could have been avoided. Freedom and necessity are mixed, the 82 G. Olsson\nforces of certainty and ambiguity embracing each other. In the beginning everything\nis right, in the end it shall all be wrong. Be the same again!\nO nce the stage has been set, the crucial question: \u201cWho were my parents?\u201d The\nchorus replies:\nBewildered as a blown bird, my soul hovers and can not fi nd\nFoothold in this debate, or any reason or rest of mind. (Sophocles, trans. 1 949 , p. 25)\nA fter a row of excruciating interrogations, the bewildering ambiguities fi nally\nspring into unquestionable certainty. When that happens Jocasta can no longer con-\ntain herself, no longer equate the name \u201cOedipus\u201d with any of the alternative\ndescriptions, \u201cmy king,\u201d \u201cmy husband,\u201d \u201cfather of my children.\u201d First praying \u201cMay\nyou never learn who you are!\u201d she cries out:\nAh, Miserable!\nThat is the only word I have for you now.\nThat is the only word I can ever have. (Sophocles, trans. 1949, p. 56)\nIn the new context any other word would be false. And she exits into her apartment,\nher hair clutched by the fi ngers of both hands, closing the doors behind her. A long\nscene later, when also Oedipus has convinced himself that logic had run its course\nand that all his premonitions had been right, he breaks the door open and rushes in.\nAs a messenger reports,\nAnd there we saw her hanging, her body swaying\nFrom the cruel cord she had noosed about her neck.\nA great sob broke from him, heartbreaking to hear,\nAs he loosed the rope and lowered her to the ground.\nI would blot out from my mind what happened next!\nFor the King ripped from her gown the golden brooches\nThat were her ornament, and raised them, and plunged them down\nStraight into his own eyeballs, crying, \u201cNo more,\nNo more shall you look on the misery about me,\nThe horrors of my own doing! Too long you have known\nThe faces of those whom I should never have seen,\nToo long been blind to those for whom I have been searching!\nFrom this hour go in darkness!\u201d And as he spoke,\nHe struck at his eyes\u2014not once, but many times;\nAnd the blood spattered his beard,\nBursting from his ruined sockets like red hail. (p. 67)\nM illennia later we keep returning. And as times go by, as they eventually did for\nOedipus too, we come gradually to understand that in every already there is always\na not yet, in every not yet always an already. Finding out who he was may or may\nnot have rid the city of the plague; Sophocles never bothered to say. What he did tell\nus, though, is that at the crossroads, the place where La\u00efos was killed, nobody knew,\nin the palace, where the truth was revealed, nobody rejoiced. Honesty is in pursuit\nand pursuit in tragedy, life itself a game of dice played by men and watched by gods.\nAs the tragic hero eventually understood and accepted, whatever fate there is we\nbring onto ourselves. To do otherwise would be to be dishonest to oneself, to break\nthe rules of one\u2019s own game, to be utterly lost. In the long run that is impossible. For\neveryone is one with his own map. 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 83\nFig. 4.1 Gunnael Jensson,\nMappa Mundi Universalis .\nGlass tetrahedron on\ngranite base, 25 \u00d7 25 \u00d7\n19\u00bc in. Mixed media\n(Kalmar granite,\nWeissglass, gold, ruby).\nMuseum Gustavianum,\nUppsala. First exhibited in\nthe Uppsala Cathedral,\nSeptember, 2000 (Photo by\nthe author)\n***\nA nd for that cartographic reason I must now briefl y turn to the sculpture M appa\nMundi Universalis (Olsson, 2 007, pp. 411\u2013437; Jensson, 2 015; see also Jensen,\n2012) , in the same expression a mapping of power-and-knowledge and a self-\nreferential presentation of the fi x-points, sight lines, and projection planes of under-\nstanding, in every respect the joint effort of myself and my friend and former student\nOle Michael Jensen. So close was in fact our cooperation that in the end we reported\nour fi ndings not under our individual names but under the amalgamated imprint of\nGunnael Jensson. Seemingly not a map at all, just a tetrahedron of transparent glass\ngrown out of a square slab of granite (Fig. 4 .1 ). Not much, yet enough to last us for\na lifetime.\nT o understand why, imagine how a long time ago a drama was set in motion. The\nstage-fl oor is a fl at rock that gently slopes into the sea, the actors some strange crea-\ntures that emerge out of nowhere, aimlessly spreading across the homogeneous\nplain. A foot gets stuck in a crevice and for the fi rst time ever there is a difference\ndifferent enough to make a difference. The others notice, they point and they mutter,\nevery gesture an attempt to force the bothering difference into graspable identity.\nAn event of tremendous consequences, for what we are now about to witness is the\nvery fi rst sacrifi ce, t he act through which the indefi nable creatures are changed into\nhuman beings, a species whose individuals are held together and kept apart by their\nuse of signs, every sign an ironic expression of Signifi er and signifi ed merged into\none.\nWhen the foot is pulled out of the rock, a well of blood springs up, a constant\nreminder of what happened when the original deviance was turned into a nonwilling\nscapegoat, the baring of the navel of what it means to be human. In the materialized 84 G. Olsson\nversion of Jensson\u2019s sculpture, the place of this remarkable event is shown by a red\nruby, a godly symbol which in the accompanying text is called a. Not because it is\na but because the semiotic animal must call it something.\nIn the defi nitional struggle that now follows the mute difference is transformed\ninto a set of communicable identities, like every translation an act of violence. More\nprecisely, the foot in the crevice splits into a trinity of reformulations, a set of pro-\nvisional reincarnations that in due course, and after much swirling around, fi nd their\npositions in the corners of an equilateral triangle. Subsequently, each of the cor-\nnered aliases adopts a name that refl ects the pain with which it was born: the shad-\nowy a ; the tautological a = a , the informative a = b . Atoms of understanding\ncaptured in a mushroom cloud of perpetual fi ssion.\nWhen the tension reaches its limit, the rock bursts and out of the lava grows a\nglass tetrahedron, a crystal palace sometimes known as the crucible of man, some-\ntimes as the prison house of language. The fl oor and the three walls of this enchant-\ning structure are all built as equal-sized equilateral triangles, the walls transparent,\nthe foundation sunk into the granite ground, the ruby-covered well at its center. In\na twist of cultural survival, the three reformulations ( a , a = a , a = b ) now rise from\nthe base, stretch upwards, and meet again at the tetrahedron\u2019s top, the multitudes\nof Greek polytheism converging in the singularity of Abrahamic monotheism.\nLike every mapping, also this one is a triangulation, the a and its three restate-\nments coming together in the vanishing point of the pinnacle, the locus of a tauto-\nlogical entity that by defi nition is what it is\u2014a = a = b \u2014a contradictory\ncondensation of difference and identity, God\u2019s name (if a name it is). And from its\ninception this Absolute speaks. L et there be! And there is. A universe fl owing out\nof the creator\u2019s mouth, in James Joyce\u2019s conception a commodious vicus of (p)\nrecirculation.\nIn the coolness of the evening, the utterer listens back to what he has heard his\ntongue say, claiming fi rst that it is very good, then that he alone has the right to\njudge. Tolerating neither idols nor false prophets, he declares that all usurpers will\nbe killed and that every critique will be censored. Hereafter, there shall be neither\npictures nor stories, hence no maps either. Impressed by his own achievements, he\nproclaims a day of rest, a Sabbath without work, 24 h devoted to the glorifi cation of\nhimself and his faithful.\nS uch is the subjection of subjects. Such is the structure of power. Such are the\ntechniques by which we are made so obedient and so predictable.\n*\nThe crystal palace is a well-guarded castle, its ruling resident the tyrant of tyrants.\nAdmittedly a rhetorical exaggeration, for no Absolute is absolutely absolute, no\ncrook crooked enough to live on forever. 4 Thought-in-Action/Action-in-Thought 85\nBut the palace is also a marvelous movie theater, one projector in each of the\nbasement corners, golden rays carrying the alternative translations from the machine\nrooms to the screens of the opposite walls: the glass of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s L a\nmari\u00e9e mise \u00e0 nu par ses c\u00e9libataires, m\u00eame (1914) (The Bride Stripped Bare by\nHer Bachelors, Even); the limestone wall of Plato\u2019s cave; the wood panel of Fra\nAngelico\u2019s A nnunciation; all found again in the m appa of cartographic reason. And\nwhen the projections of the imagined identities hit the sheets of glass, they miracu-\nlously change into a set of Peircean signs, no longer the private fantasies of their\ninventor but communicable bits in an evolving discourse. To be technical, the a\nbecomes the symbol of a , the a = a the icon of a = a , the a = b the index of a = b .\nBut just as the painter\u2019s canvas must be properly prepared for the paint not to crack\nor run off, so must our minds be indoctrinated to ensure that all that is solid does not\nmelt into air. Three grand institutions have risen to the task: religion (with its belief\nin the a of shared conventions), art (with it\u2019s a = a striving for perfect resemblance),\nscience (with it\u2019s a = b , the a s-if knowledge of provisional truth). Each mode of\nunderstanding entrenched within its own self-supporting power structures, rituals,\nrules, and regulations.\nI f these rituals could be perfectly performed, then the projection lines would\nstrike the screening planes at 90\u00b0 angles, every message going straight back to the\ncornered restatement it came from, nothing learned in the process. But even though\nthe Saussurean/Lacanian sign is steeped in mimetic desire, the diverse ontologies of\nSignifi er and signifi ed guarantee that this perpetual urge can never be satisfi ed.\nHence the fortunate consequence that no translation can ever be perfect. It follows\nthat in actuality the inclination of the (en)lightening rays is never right on and that\nthe projections, instead of returning to the original identities unchanged, they begin\nto bounce between the walls. In turn, this slight defl ection means that whatever I\nhappen to think, say, and do is never pure and simple but always a nondissolvable\nblend of religion, art, and science. And suddenly I see where the trigger of tragedy\nlies: in the purifying spirit of the right angle, in the hatred of the other which is built\ninto the desire of every identity formulation. Hitler\u2019s L ebensraum, Stalin\u2019s G ulag ,\nthe Rwanda genocide, the iconoclastic controversy, J yllands-Posten \u2019s Mohammed\npictures\u2014all of them variations on the same theme. Murderous is our history, murky\nthe connection between knowledge and action.\nIn turn, this analysis explains why for 40 years tragedy has occupied such an\nimportant place in my own conception of what it means to be human, indeed why I\ntake it to be the most insightful of all available conceptions of thought-in-action and\naction-in-thought. The original setting is crucial, for Sophocles\u2014a Janus-like fi gure\nwho with one eye was scanning the old, with another was imagining the future\u2014\nlived his long life in the abyss between the m ythos of Homer and the l ogos of Plato.\nWhat he then discovered was that the greatest tension of his time lay in the attitudes\nto predicament, for while the archaic poets had taken a person\u2019s social standing to\nrefl ect his or her ability to handle contradiction, the new philosophers defi ned 86 G. Olsson\nparadox as the greatest threat to the cohesion of human reason, an enemy to be\nfought by all means. As Wittgenstein (1921/1 961) later put it, \u201cwithout philosophy\nthoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task to make them clear and to\ngive them sharp boundaries\u201d (4.112). But in Sophocles\u2019 eyes religion itself was\nnothing but a human invention designed to keep people in place, like other laws\nissued by the humans of the polis, not by the gods of Olympus.\nI n my mind this pre-Christian circumstance explains both why the tragedians\nassigned such a crucial role to the chorus and why the recurring convulsions of the\nlate twentieth and early twenty-fi rst centuries are essentially a political crisis, an\norgy in promises that cannot be kept and therefore should never be given, the elec-\ntion results bought with junk bonds issued in the voters\u2019 own names. Whereas the\nproblem for the tragedians was the exact drawing of the boundary between the\nhumans and the gods, the problem for the postdemocrats is that although all animals\nare equal, some pigs are more equal than the others. In my readings it is exactly\nthese relations between religion, arts, and science that permeate also the cascading\nrefl ections of writers like Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, Peter Sloterdijk, and\nSlavoj Zizek. Getting crowded is the crystal palace, the prophets moving in.\n***\nI n the history of the longue dur\u00e9e, the examples of Swedish welfare, central\nplace theory, geography, and planning deserve little but a footnote. Yet they too\nspring from the tension of trust and verifi cation that lies at the heart of European\nculture, perhaps of all cultures, the tales about Oedipus\u2019 foot and Odysseus\u2019 scar\npulling in one direction, the paragraphs of Moses\u2019 fi rst stone tablet in the other. In\nthe cleft in-between hides everything inter-esting, including the scientist\u2019s testable\ntheory and operationalized model, in the same breath a reifi ed deifi cation and a dei-\nfi ed reifi cation, the potentially informative a = b turning into the tautological\nI am who I am . In that context the lawmakers\u2019 grasp of human action as a magic\ngame of ontological transformations is truly remarkable: \u201cThou shalt not make unto\nthee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that\nis in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; Thou shalt not bow\ndown thyself to them, nor serve them\u201d (Exodus 20:4\u20135, Deuteronomy 5:8\u20139, King\nJames Version).\nW ell decreed. For in the empirical now-here of the utopian No-where, nothing is\nmore inhibiting than our inability to be abstract enough. As Abraham responded on\nhis way to the a kedah (Genesis 22:1, King James Version): \u201cHere I am.\u201d And the\ntwo went on together, world literature\u2019s most pregnant silence.\nT he spiral is closing in, every thought emitting a throw of dice.

Chapter 5\nPerverse Expertise and the Social Unconscious\nin the Making of Crisis\nRichard Peet\nT his chapter stresses the social construction of the knowledge guiding social action.\nI focus on social construction as opposed to the individual\u2019s psychology of knowl-\nedge. The individual always has his or her own mentality, but what matters in the\nmaking of history are the broad social and cultural trends in thought, imagination,\nand comprehension. Further, I discuss social construction as it is meant in the criti-\ncal tradition\u2014Marx\u2019s ideology, Gramsci\u2019s hegemony\u2014whereby class forces lead,\ndirect, and control the production of knowledge. Knowledge production serves a\nclass interest. As Marx and Engels (1845/2 004 ) put it,\nThe ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the\nruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class\nwhich has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over\nthe means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who\nlack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more\nthan the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material\nrelationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the rul-\ning one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. (p. 64)\nI f the problems that beset capitalism result from the actions of capitalists\u2014if the\nfi nancial crisis that began in 2007 was caused by speculation by fi nance capital-\nists\u2014then, the dominant interpretations will be those of the causal agents.\nThe rush of contemporary events is thus testing the ideas available for under-\nstanding them. This testing holds for the ideas developed to think through the imme-\ndiate onslaught of rebellions, crises, and catastrophes. It also holds for the concepts\nneeded to guide a more long-term movement into a different kind of society.\nNarrowly economic categories are insuffi cient for thinking about society as a whole.\nAt the least, political-economic-cultural ideas are needed. Clearly, one cannot just\nregard a single country to be a s ociety and must therefore consider geoeconomic or\nR.

Peet\ngeopolitical notions\u2014or rather, geopolitical-economic concepts\u2014adequate for a\nglobalized existence. A new, critical conceptual apparatus is needed. But this criti-\ncal conception is prevented by hegemonic control that a combination of perverse\nexpertise and mass social unconsciousness exerts over imaginaries. At the juncture\nbetween modern knowledge and practical action lies expertise. When the mass mind\nloses its capacity to think rationally, the outcome is social unconsciousness. The\nelite practice perverse expertise, and the masses respond unconsciously. This mind-\nset moves capitalist society into an era of perpetual crisis.\nNeoliberalism, Finance Capitalism, and Crisis\nI offer a proposition worthy, perhaps, of consideration. Several major, powerful\nblocs of countries have changed from societies with economies characterized by\nindustrial capitalism to a new kind of society one might call fi nance capitalism . In\nthe United States, the timing of this transformation is clear. Profi ts from manufac-\nturing were far larger than profi ts from other corporate sectors until the 1980s, when\nprofi ts in FIRE corporations (fi nance, insurance, and real estate) all of a sudden\ngrew rapidly. They overtook those in manufacturing in the 1990s and have remained\ngreater ever since. Financial corporations are now the dominant economic institu-\ntions in capitalist societies that have transitioned from production to the provision\nof services, especially fi nancial services (Peet, 2 011 ).\nT his transition results from secular change in the distribution of income.\nFigure 5 .1 , derived from U.S. income-tax statistics computed by Emmanuel Saez\nfrom the University of California, shows that the 1 % of the U.S. population at the\nhighest end of the income scale received 15\u201325 % of total income in the Liberal\nperiod of U.S. capitalism (1917\u20131941). For the subsequent 40 years under Keynesian\ncapitalism, that group received a fairly steady 10 %, a fi gure that began to rise suddenly\nin the early 1980s, under Neoliberalism, reaching 20\u201324 % in the 2000s. Economic\ngrowth since 1980 has almost exclusively produced higher incomes for the already\nrich (Piketty & Saez, 2 003) . At the other end of the class spectrum, real incomes\nhave fallen for the poor and have remained steady for just about everyone else.\nIncreasing inequality is the central socioeconomic characteristic of fi nance capitalism.\nFinance capitalism exercises power by controlling access to the markets through\nwhich capital accumulations become investments, directing fl ows of capital (e.g.,\nequity purchases, bond sales, and direct investment) to places and users approved by\nthe fi nancial analytic structure of the banks, investment fi rms, and bond sellers on\nWall Street and in the City of London. In terms of expertise, it is the investment\nanalyst\u2019s global gaze, representing the confi dence of the market, by which societies\nand economies are ordered, ranked, and adjudicated. Although investor confi dence\nis presented by the business media as a neutral, technical, and necessary factor\u2014in\neveryone\u2019s best long-term interest\u2014it is actually a committed, fi nancial capitalist\ninterest based on utterly biased knowledge. An instructive example is the global\nbond market. The interest paid on sovereign bonds is determined by the risk of 5 Perverse Expertise and the Social Unconscious in the Making of Crisis 91\n45\n40\n35\nerahS\n30\nemocnI\n25\nfo\n20\negatnecreP\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1917 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2008\nYear\nFig. 5.1 Percentage income (including capital gains) going to the three highest income groups,\nUnited States, 1917\u20132008. (Source: Designed and drawn by the author. Statistical data from\nAlveredo, Atkinson, Piketty, & Saez ( 2011 ))\ndefault, with experts employing formulae stemming from long experience measured\nstatistically\u2014apparently scientifi c and necessary. Yet it is actually a few thousand\nexperts representing the interests of accumulated capital who tell governments how\nto run their economies. At the very least, they represent undemocratic expertise.\nA t the confl uence of knowledge and action lies expertise, by which is meant\nhigh-quality, specialized, theoretical, and practical knowledge. The process that\nproduces sophisticated, but inimical, knowledge is what I call p erverse expertise . It\nis expertise in that some of the world\u2019s fi nest minds, such as professional econo-\nmists, do the intellectual and practical modeling and are well paid and respected for\ndoing so. The process is perverse because knowledge is accumulated in order to\ncontinue augmenting the incomes of already wealthy people, the capitalist class.\nThe only valid economic reason for gross distortions in income distribution of the\nkind that characterizes neoliberal, fi nance capitalism is that wealthy people are so\nrich that they cannot possibly spend all the money they receive and are therefore\nforced to save. The resulting vast accumulation of saved incomes becomes the main\nsource of investment capital. Properly invested, capital can be used for research and\ninnovation that results in more productive or sustainable economies. Badly invested,\ncapital can be used for speculation that results in unstable economies. Knowledge\nand expertise make the difference.\nAccordingly, Neoliberalism is a way of running the economy that produces dra-\nmatic price rises on the stock exchange, where the rich put their money to make ever\nmore of it. But stocks and shares are a relatively safe bet compared to Neoliberalism\u2019s\nirrational exuberances, such as the sprawling fi nancial apparatus surrounding the 92 R. Peet\nswollen credit market. Disaster strikes when, as in 1929 and 2007, the amount of\nmoney going to the 1 % superrich approaches 25 % of total income generated in the\ncountry, far exceeding requirements for productive investment and n ecessitating\nspeculation to enhance returns. For the price of high returns is eternal risk. Any\ninvestment fund that does not generate quick and large returns and that thereby\navoids extreme gambles suffers disinvestment in highly competitive markets, where\nmoney changes hands in a computer-aided fl ash. There is thus a competitive com-\npulsion for experts to be ever more daring as they seek to maximize returns that\ntemporarily attract investment. Financial managers, who oversee capital accumula-\ntions, compete for control over assets by promising these high returns. Those who\nfail to deliver high profi t rates disappear to be replaced by even more aggressive\ninvestment analysts. Debt, speculation, hazard, and fear are thereby structurally\nendemic to fi nance capitalism in what Walks (2 010 ) calls \u201cPonzi Neoliberalism.\u201d\nFear itself becomes the source of further speculation, as with buying gold or futures.\nDebt and gambling spread from Wall Street into all sectors of society\u2014house prices,\nstate lotteries, casinos, numbers games, bingo at the church hall, sweepstakes, and\nPokemon cards. Everyone gambles, even children. Production, consumption, econ-\nomy, culture, and the use of environments are subject to an ever more removed,\nabstract calculus of power in which ability to contribute to short-term fi nancial\nprofi t becomes the main concern. The structure of the system compels expertise into\nperversity. The particular thinker, with his or her own psychological structure and\nthinking processes, has little to do with structural compulsions in the relations\nbetween knowledge and action.\nT he interlocking of these speculations is the source of their intractability. The\nfi nancial crisis that began in 2007 was thus marked by vastly overpriced housing,\nparticularly near booming fi nancial centers; competition among fi nancial institu-\ntions to offer easy credit that made many people hopelessly indebted; the bundling\nof home mortgages and other debts into tradable paper; exorbitant levels of leverag-\ning; and the use of assets whose value can disappear in an instant to securitize other,\neven chancier investments. It was not just that crisis spread from one area to another.\nIt was that crisis in one area (such as the inevitable end to the housing price bubble)\nhad exponential effects on the others (investment banks that were overextended into\nhigh-risk speculation) to the degree that accumulated losses tested the capacity of\neven client states and governance institutions to rescue the situation. In a nutshell,\ninequality is not merely unethical, it is dangerous. The combination of debt and\nspeculation, deriving from inequality, produces an inevitable tendency toward\nrepeated fi nancial crises.\nBuying the State\nWhy are the colossal incomes of the already rich not taxed out of existence? How\ncan extreme inequality survive in democracies where people are, at least apparently,\nfree to vote for anyone they choose? The main thing about so-called free elections 5 Perverse Expertise and the Social Unconscious in the Making of Crisis 93\nis that they are not free. Elections are expensive. Public opinion is made by media\npersuasion. Political images are costly to produce, in part because sharp minds pon-\nder every persuasive aspect, ransack each emotion, and raid the collective memory\nto sell candidates for offi ce. Such images are expensive to distribute, especially\nbecause the image of the politician has to compete with images of other commodi-\nties that taste nice and look even better than the politician. Politicians therefore have\nto raise a great deal of money to run for offi ce when elections are decided almost\nexclusively by image projection in Fordist societies.\nI n 1976 and 1980, the last U.S. elections under Keynesian capitalism, presiden-\ntial candidates collectively raised and spent about $1.75 billion per election. As\nNeoliberalism took hold, the cost of elections soared. In the 2008 U.S. presidential\nelection, candidates collectively raised ten times more\u2014just under $17.49 billion,\nwith the total cost of the election amounting to just over $5.28 billion. In the 2010\nmidterm elections, congressional candidates raised $ 1.08 billion\u2014and senatorial\ncandidates, $ 742 million\u2014in an election fought almost entirely on the basis of\nattack ads (data from Center for Responsive Politics, n.d.) . The 2012 presidential\nelections made even these enormous amounts seem like pocket money. In the few\nmonths of the early presidential campaign up to the end of June 2012, and before\nthings really intensifi ed, President Obama spent $400 million, and eventually $1 bil-\nlion. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Citizens United vs. FEC (2 010 ), ruled\nthat under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (which deals with the free-\ndom of speech) the government could not restrict the size of corporate donations to\nSuper Pacs (Political Action Committees) that indirectly support candidates for\npublic offi ce by supporting causes that they stand for. A billion dollars is needed to\nrun a high-level campaign.\nWhere does one acquire a billion dollars to run a campaign or support a cause?\nAnswer: from people who have a billion dollars. About one tenth of 1 % of the U.S.\nadult population (231,000 people) donate over $2000 each to political campaigns,\nand these donations make up 75 % of the total contributions; a mere 26,000 people\ndonate 36 % of total contributions (Center for Responsive Politics n .d. ). In other\nwords, a candidate must raise hundreds of millions of dollars from 200,000 rich\npeople to be able to run a campaign. Candidates who do not appeal to the rich or\nwho are not wealthy themselves never have a chance. They raise a few million dol-\nlars at most (independent candidate Ralph Nader raised $4 million in 2008), they\ncannot run television ads, they are not present at media debates, and most of the\nelectorate never hears of them. Rich people choose the political candidates who run\nfor offi ce. Under fi nance capitalist democracy, the electorate decides which rich\npeople\u2019s candidates are elected to offi ce. And the information spread by costly\nadvertising? Most messages are attack ads presenting unfavorable information\nabout the candidate or cause they oppose. Most of the rest are image ads presenting\nfavorable pictures of the candidate they support. The real content, by which I mean\nsubstantiated and sustained information about a candidate\u2019s positions and policies,\nhardly appears. Images, attack ads, and the like constitute perverse political knowl-\nedge produced by perverse expertise. It produces perverse democracy. 94 R. Peet\nOnce in offi ce, politicians are kept in line by lobbying. Companies, labor unions,\nand other organizations, in addition to making campaign contributions, spend\n$3.5 billion each year on efforts to infl uence the U.S. Congress and federal agen-\ncies. In the period between 1998 and 2010, the insurance, business association, and\nsecurities sectors spent $33.6 billion on lobbying, whereas labor spent about\n$30 million a year. Some 130 former members of congress are lobbyists, and lob-\nbies employ nearly half the politicians and congressional aides who return to the\nprivate sector. Such money and connections do not spread scientifi c or factual\nknowledge. They project information based on superfi cial, biased knowledge\nthought up to support powerful interests. Lobbyists are yet another example of per-\nverse political expertise.\nFinance Capitalism and Environmental Crisis\nDuring the unusually hot summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012, capitalist society fell\nprey to two crises: an economic depression that states or markets could not end and\na sequence of environmental tragedies brought on by global warming. Did the two\ncrises coincide by mere chance? Or did they stem systematically from the same\nstructural causes? The answer might seem obvious were it not for media that must\nconfuse on causation as they inform on details. Both economic depression and envi-\nronmental catastrophe result from the extreme risks that must be taken by prominent\nactors under fi nance capitalism\u2014meaning that anyone who does not stake every-\nthing is eliminated from power. Crises that threaten humanity are structurally\nendemic to fi nance capitalism.\nFinancial and economic crisis lead to periodic recessions, depressions, and\ndownturns punctuated by hopelessly optimistic upturns in the m arkets , bringing on\nthe terrible social outcome of millions of people losing their jobs, homes, and dig-\nnity. But the worst is yet to come as the environment strikes back. The hazards\nendemic to fi nance capitalism extend to precarious environmental relations. The\nbearers of capitalist culture become risk-ridden, short-term in memory and anticipa-\ntion, and careless about consequences. They live for the moment, without regard for\nthe environmental future. Production, consumption, the economy in general, and\nthe use of environments are subject to a remote, abstract calculus of power wherein\nthe ability to promote short-term fi nancial profi t becomes primary and long-term\nimpacts are not so much ignored as glossed over through sophisticated corporate\nadvertising, think-tank excuses, and pseudogreen propaganda (\u201cWe, too, care about\nthe environment\u201d). By generating above-average profi ts, corporate leaders who\nmake environmentally perilous decisions\u2014to drill in deep water, for instance\u2014win\nthe investor confi dence that enables them to borrow, invest, and expand and allows\nthem to pay their upper management well. CEOs who demonstrate an environmen-\ntal conscience do not win the market\u2019s confi dence. Environmental risk (mitigated by\nquality public relations to excuse the occasional mistakes) represents the frontier in\nprofi t-making and business success. Every time a disaster such as British Petroleum\u2019s 5 Perverse Expertise and the Social Unconscious in the Making of Crisis 95\n2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is cleaned up, excused, and forgotten, the agents\nof the risk business just become more knowledgeable and slicker at its politicocul-\ntural operations. As BP was restoring investor confi dence in the summer of 2010,\nthe company announced that it was selling its onshore drilling operations to concen-\ntrate even more on deep-sea drilling. The danger that produces economic catastro-\nphe also creates environmental crises.\nThe neoliberal globalization that has deindustrialized the First World and indus-\ntrialized parts of the Third World\u2014Brazil, South Korea, China, and India\u2014has\nresulted in a spectacular globalization of environmental destruction. Globalization\nof this neoliberal, fi nancial kind means that economic growth rates slow in the dein-\ndustrialized center but accelerate rapidly (rates of 8\u201310 % a year) in some peripheral\nindustrializing countries. China\u2019s economy grew 14-fold between 1980 and 2006 to\nthe equivalent of a GDP of $4.4 trillion, and India\u2019s economy grew sixfold, to\n$1.2 trillion, with carbon dioxide emissions increasing proportionately. China\u2019s car-\nbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels amounted to 407 million metric\ntons in 1980 and nearly 2.25 billion in 2010; India\u2019s went from 95 million metric\ntons in 1980 to 564 million in 2010 (Boden & Blasing, 2 012 ).\nMuch of this production and pollution is connected to consumption in the First\nWorld. Some 40 % of China\u2019s product is exported, as is 20 % of India\u2019s, and both\neconomies have become dramatically more export oriented. These statistics show\nthe globalization of an economy still centered on consumption in the high-income\ncountries. This fi xation has led to an intensifi cation of pollution\u2019s globalization, as\nevidenced by carbon dioxide emissions. In 2010 global fossil-fuel carbon emissions\namounted to 9.13 billion metric tons of carbon. In global terms, more than 500 bil-\nlion metric tons of carbon have been released into the atmosphere from the burning\nof fossil fuels and cement production since 1750, and half of these emissions have\nhappened since the mid-1970s, when it was already known that greenhouse gasses\ncaused global warming\u2014perverse environmental knowledge.\nThe point is that environmental pollution is driven by economic necessity under\ncapitalism. It is necessary to pollute so that money can be made. Within the existing\npoliticoeconomic context, only economic recession can bring about a drastic\ndecrease in pollution. Indeed, global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil\nfuels temporarily declined by 5.9 % from 2008 through 2009. This reduction came\nabout because of a 2.5 % fall in global GDP, a decrease of 11.5 % in the manufactur-\ning production index, and a reduction of 40 % in raw steel production. Yet it is politi-\ncally impossible for parties or governments to suggest, in effect, that the necessary\nprice of ending environmental destruction is a declining economy. The solution is to\nelevate discussion from the national to the international scale. Upward displacement\nin the environmental discourse necessarily takes the form of UN conferences, Earth\nsummits, and unenforceable protocols. Economic necessity produces endless politi-\ncal evasion of the environmental issue. Yet under Neoliberalism the signifi cance of\ngovernment regulation of development\u2014and development\u2019s relations with the envi-\nronment\u2014is diminishing because of the intensifi cation of neoliberal and mass\nbeliefs, including mass beliefs, about government, markets, and policies. Hence, the\nTea Party movement in the United States is founded on the idea of reducing the size 96 R. Peet\nand interventional zeal of government at a time when state intervention through\nenvironmental regulation is all that exists in the way of collective response to the\ndestruction of nature.\nIn brief, environmental knowledge has escalated as environmental destruction\nhas intensifi ed. It is a case of perverse knowledge.\nSocial Unconsciousness\nWere these issues the only ones, the world\u2019s people might still survive to criticize\nthe system yet again. The business\u2013state\u2013media power complex, led by fi nance\ncapital and driven by the quest for superprofi ts and fantastic incomes, cannot be\nopposed with any degree of success except by social movements arising from an\ninformed, enraged, and rational populace. There has to be a critical, rational, activist\nWe-for-Us-to-save-the-world. Yet the other, popular side of fi nance capitalism is\nconsumptive excess enabled by the cheap commodities that fl ood in from globalized\nproduction. The priority of social reproduction shifts from socializing people to\nbecome workers to socializing people to become consumers. A new type of human\nbeing is emerging, the consumptive person. The culture of overconsumption pro-\nduces mass, popular apathy (I like , rather than I think ). Overconsumption is a social\naddiction, a radical, selfi sh individualism that I characterize as the social uncon-\nscious. It is u nconscious in that conscious awareness is missing, has not been con-\nstructed, has not been allowed to develop even from the interpretation of everyday\nexperience (common sense), and it is social in that many people share similar char-\nacteristics. The culture of overconsumption is not so much a case of deliberately\nproducing mass stupidity, although mass advertising comes close to a corporate\nconspiracy. It is more that the trivialization of everyday life produces unconscious-\nness. Utter trivialization gives rise to a new kind of soft, shallow, compliant person-\nality encased in the kind of fat body that results from total absence of\nself-control\u201435.7 % of American adults are obese, as are 17 % of American chil-\ndren ( Adult Obesity Facts, 2013) . Reality is a show. Entertainment is all that is.\nBecause every commodity must have a body to bear its message and because every\nservice is energy-intensive, overconsumption, overproduction, and the concomitant\noveruse of resources create environmental risk for society as a whole.\nEssentially, the ability to respond in a radical, collective, socially rational way\u2014\nto control an activist, interventionist state democratically, for instance\u2014has been\nconsumed away in vast segments of the population living in the global centers of\npower. And the leading ideas produced by experts in the service of power are ideo-\nlogical diversions rather than means of collective rational intervention.\nM y conclusion is that the intersecting economic and environmental crises will\ncontinue a d infi nitum because the existing hegemonic knowledge cannot guide\neffective social action. 5 Perverse Expertise and the Social Unconscious in the Making of Crisis 97\nReferences\nAdult Obesity Facts .

Chapter 6\nHow Much Knowledge Is Necessary\nfor Action?\nJoachim Funke\nHow much knowledge is necessary for action? This question is fundamental because\nit suggests that the link between knowledge and action is debatable, that there is no\ngiven, fixed causal relationship between knowledge and action. In addition, there\nseems to be no fixed causal direction. Knowledge can be a prerequisite for action\nbut also a consequence of an action. My opening question relates two key words in\npsychology. One of them is knowledge, about which a large body of knowledge\nexists (e.g., Halford, Wilson, & Phillips, 2010)\u2014about its different types (e.g., pro-\ncedural, declarative), styles of acquisition (implicit, explicit), and degrees of acces-\nsibility (conscious, subconscious, unconscious). The other word is action, about\nwhich there are various theories describing human behavior with respect to inten-\ntion (e.g., Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010). In this introductory section I try to give an\noverview of these conceptions and of the relation between knowledge and action.\nThe issues around the keywords knowledge and action\u2014which constitute the\ntitle of a book by Frey, Mandl, and von Rosenstiel (2006)\u2014are captured by the fol-\nlowing four main aspects, which generate corresponding questions.\n1. The relation between knowledge and action. From the perspective of the psy-\nchology of knowledge (e.g., Strube & Wender, 1993), knowledge is a compe-\ntence for action, a precondition. What is known about the relation between\nknowledge and action and what is not known? How much of human action is\ngoverned by routines, experience, intuition, and knowledge? What is the trade-\noff between taking action and improving knowledge?\n2. Types of knowledge and different phases. To what extent do various types of\nknowledge (e.g., implicit or explicit) influence the steps from cognition to action\n(e.g., aspirations, attention, decision-making, problem-solving, the evaluation of\nsituations, the search for alternatives, and the implementation of intentions)?\nJ.

What categories of rationality should be identified?\nConcepts of rationality are common ground in social and economic theories, but\nrationality in everyday life seems to be something else. To what degree does the\nconcept of bounded rationality (Simon, 1947, p. 61\u201365) weaken the link between\nknowledge and action? Is there a threshold of minimal knowledge that is neces-\nsary for action?\n4. Action theory and language. How constitutive is language use for action? Searle\n(1969), with his concept of speech acts, points out that speaking can be acting.\nTo speak about X requires knowing something about X. If someone is not able to\nspeak about Z, can that person act upon Z or does the inability to speak about Z\nimply the inability to act upon Z? What about the idea that \u201cactions speak louder\nthan words\u201d (Tanner, Br\u00fcgger, van Schie, & Lebherz, 2010)?\nThe contribution from my own empirical work addresses mainly the first and at\nleast in part the second of these four main aspects, leaving many of the other ques-\ntions to the reader.\nAfter a short section on definitions, I ask whether action is possible without\nknowledge and afterward venture the question of whether it is possible for people to\nact against their own knowledge. Thereafter, I review some of the standard views on\nthe relation between knowledge and action, interpretations that may help this chap-\nter\u2019s exploration of that connection through three theories: planned behavior, uncon-\nscious thought, and the option-generation framework. The chapter then continues\nwith empirical evidence from my own research area, problem-solving, and shows\nthat the relation between knowledge and action is strong within that area.\nDefinitions of Knowledge and Action\nKnowledge and Belief\nKnowledge is not always knowledge; it is necessary to distinguish between knowl-\nedge and true belief. A person who believes that leaves of a red tree are green defi-\nnitely knows about his or her belief. Hence, there is knowledge that depends on\nstates in the outer world (it being a purely empirical question whether the leaves are\ngreen or red) and on other knowledge that is a priori true (i.e., my knowledge about\nmy beliefs). In the philosophy of language, this position is called externalism. For\nthe issues considered in this chapter, it suffices to state that I am talking about the\nperson\u2019s internal knowledge not at a metalevel but rather at the level of assertions\nthat are believed to be true. 6 How Much Knowledge Is Necessary for Action? 101\nTypes of Knowledge\nThe distinction between explicit (verbalizable, declarative) and implicit (nonverbal-\nizable, tacit) knowledge is well known and relates to the distinction between con-\nscious and nonconscious knowledge. Cognitive processes in general are often seen\nas working in two modes, a deliberate, conscious one and an automatic noncon-\nscious type of processing (e.g., Evans, 2008; Kahneman, 2011).\nAction\nThe definition of action as goal-directed human activity helps set it apart from pure\nbehavior (e.g., sneezing, which is not directed to any particular goal). Action is that\npart of behavior which occurs intentionally. Keep in mind that even trial-and-error\nbehavior could be classified as action if it happens intentionally.\nIs Action Possible Without Knowledge?\nIs action possible without knowledge? Can one really posit that idea as a serious\noption? If one takes the term action to mean goal-directed human activity, the\nanswer must be no. Action implies goals, and in order to realize goals a person\nneeds appropriate means. The means\u2013end connection is knowledge\u2014to know that\none can use bamboo sticks to fetch a banana lying just beyond arm\u2019s reach outside\nthe bars of a cage was an important insight to Sultan, the most intelligent chimpan-\nzee analyzed by K\u00f6hler (1925).\nBut what is the relation between goals and knowledge? Are goals part of what\npeople call knowledge or are they a separate entity only derivative of knowledge? In\nmy understanding, knowledge is a piece of subjectively acquired information about\nthe world. In German one would say that knowledge about the world is angeeignet\n(appropriated, assimilated, internalized). In a certain sense it could be construed as\nembodied information.\nBut how is embodied information linked to goals? Goals are representations of\nfuture states and derive their power from the possibility of finding a way from the\ngiven present state to an envisioned future state. When talking about goals, people\nalways talk about degrees of distance between the given and the goal state. Because\nthe path from the given state to the goal state is sometimes not easy to discover,\nproblem-solving comes into play. Indeed, the epistemologist Karl Popper (1999)\nargued that \u201call life is problem solving.\u201d\nTo answer the question of whether action is possible without knowledge, I must\nthus conclude that the use of the word action logically implies the connection to\nsome background representation, which is normally called knowledge. 102 J. Funke\nIs Action Possible Against One\u2019s Better Knowledge?\nIt may be more interesting to ask whether action is possible against knowledge. The\nquestion is related to the understanding of human rationality. Newell (1981) stated\nthe principle of rationality simply by saying, \u201cif an agent has knowledge that one of\nits actions will lead to one of its goals, then the agent will select that action\u201d (p. 8).\nThis principle would not allow a person to act against her or his goals.\nYet everyday experience brims with examples to the contrary. People love ani-\nmals\u2014but at the same time do not hesitate to slaughter them professionally in the\nslaughterhouse. Concern about climate change is widespread, though people con-\ntinue to pollute the environment by driving big cars. The gaps between attitude and\nbehavior are large, but are attitude and behavior the same as knowledge and action?\nTake smoking for example. Evidence indisputably shows that smoking is detrimen-\ntal to human health, but people continue to smoke despite their knowledge of this\nfact. Are they acting against their knowledge? I would say, no! Given even such\nblatant violations of their own attitudes, people follow principles of bounded ratio-\nnality. When smoking despite knowledge about the negative consequences of that\nbehavior, a person might argue, \u201cYes, I know about the negative effects, but my\nfamily has a very good gene pool, so I do not assume I\u2019ll get cancer as easily as\nnormal people will.\u201d This argumentation conveys a kind of justification for behavior\nthat, from the viewpoint of the individual, is no longer irrational but instead has its\nown limited rationality.\nCan Knowledge Impede Action?\nPlanning before taking action is usually thought to be wise, but it can have disad-\nvantages. Although having plans generally makes people more likely to act on a\ngoal than they would without them, an experiment reported by Masicampo and\nBaumeister (2012) showed that subjects who had devised plans to achieve a goal\nfailed at that task, particularly when it was essential to recognize and seize an alter-\nnative opportunity in order to succeed. The authors concluded that with sufficient\n(unlimited) time a previously learned specific plan increased attainment of the goal,\nreplicating the usual benefit of planning. With insufficient time, however, the spe-\ncific plan impaired performance because participants failed to capitalize on an alter-\nnative opportunity for accomplishing the goal. The final conclusion by Masicampo\nand Baumeister was that plans can drastically decrease overall rates of attainment\nwhen openness to alternatives is crucial to success. 6 How Much Knowledge Is Necessary for Action? 103\nThe Relation Between Knowledge and Action\nWhat are the standard views on the relation between knowledge and action? I con-\ncentrate on three approaches that posit assumptions about this relationship: (a) the\ntheory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), (b) the theory of unconscious thought\n(Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006), and (c) the option-generation framework (Kalis,\nMojzisch, Schweizer, & Kaiser, 2008).\nThe Theory of Planned Behavior\nThe theory of planned behavior formulated by Ajzen (1991) has become one of the\nbest-known theories in psychology. Roughly, it states that behavior depends on the\nintention or resolve of the individual to behave in a certain way, say, to exercise at\nleast five times a week. Intention itself depends on a behavioral attitude (e.g., exer-\ncising at least five times a week would be good/bad), subjective norms (e.g., most\npeople important to the person think that she or he should exercise at least five times\na week), and perceived behavioral control (e.g., exercising at least five times a week\nwould be easy/difficult). This theory, in its new versions, is referred to as the \u201crea-\nsoned action approach\u201d (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010).\nAs depicted in Fig. 6.1, action depends on previous knowledge in the form of\nintention. The empirical evidence bearing out this theory is impressive, with meta-\nanalyses of empirical studies (Armitage & Conner, 2001; Manning, 2009) over-\nwhelmingly showing a strong connection between intention and subsequent\nBehavioral\nattitude\nSubjective\nIntention Behavior\nnorms\nPerceived\nbehavioral\ncontrol\nFig. 6.1 The main elements that constitute the theory of reasoned action. Behavioral attitude,\nsubjective norms, and perceived behavioral control causes intention that brings about behavior\n(with additional influence from perceived behavioral control) 104 J. Funke\nbehavior. But is this finding really a surprise? Werner Greve, a psychologist from\nHildesheim University, has argued that the empirical success of the theory of\nplanned behavior is not astonishing. According to him, the connection between\nintention and action is logical, not causal. In his article \u201cTraps and Gaps in Action\nExplanation\u201d (2001), he stated that intention is an inherent part of what is called\naction. Speaking about action therefore implies the assumption that an intention\nmust exist to carry out a certain action.\nThe consequence of Greve\u2019s (2001) argument is clear. In his view most of the\nempirical studies on the theory of planned action are pseudoempirical research in\nthat things that are true a priori are proven empirically. If a person intends to diet\nand sometime later starts to undergo dietary treatment, that action comes as no sur-\nprise. It is a logical consequence of the fact that at some time t a person decides to\nbegin dietary treatment and then at time t + 1 the diet really commences. But what\nabout the cases in which persons do not start their dietary treatment? Would their\nlapse falsify the logical connection between intention and action? No, it would only\nmean that the intention was not strong enough to reach a threshold needed to turn\nintention into behavior.\nThe Theory of Unconscious Thought\nA second approach is the theory of unconscious thought (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren,\n2006). The basic idea is that the quality of decision-making depends on conscious\nand unconscious thought simultaneously. The term conscious thought is understood\nto mean a mental state that encompasses a person\u2019s rational awareness, whereas the\nterm unconscious thought refers to the underlying influence, of which one is typi-\ncally unaware and which has an impact on one\u2019s behavior. Unconscious thought\ntakes place when conscious attention is directed elsewhere. Unconscious thought\ntends to outmatch conscious thought, especially in complex and untransparent\nsituations.\nThe relative impacts that conscious and unconscious thought can have on\ndecision- making become evident in the data from experiments by Dijksterhuis, Bos,\nNordgren, and van Baaren (2006). The task for participants was to choose the most\nfavorable car from a selection of cars that were described by only four aspects (the\nsimple situation) or as many as twelve aspects (complex situation). Part (a) of Fig.\n6.2 shows the percentage of persons who chose the best option; part (b), as a sec-\nondary measure, shows the difference in attitude toward the best option. The left-\nhand set of two bars in part (a) shows that most of the subjects made the correct\ndecision in the simple situation if they were in a conscious-thought mode (repre-\nsented by the white bar). But when the complexity of the task increased to twelve\naspects, as is shown in the right-hand set of bars in part (b), the mode of uncon-\nscious thought has a great advantage over that of conscious thought, a finding that\nsupports the theory by Dijksterhuis and Nordgren (2006). As part (b) of Fig. 6.2 6 How Much Knowledge Is Necessary for Action? 105\nFig. 6.2 Decision-making criteria for choosing a car: (a) Percentage of participants who chose the\nmost desirable car as a function of complexity of decision and of mode of thought (n = 18 to 22 in\neach condition). Error bars represent the standard error. (b) Difference in attitude (on a scale of \u201325\nto +25) toward the desirable and undesirable car as a function of complexity of decision and of\nmode of thought (n = 12 to 14 in each condition). Error bars [the vertical lines above the bars]\nrepresent the standard error (Reprinted from Dijksterhuis et al. (2006, p. 1005) with permission\nfrom the American Association for the Advancement of Science)\nillustrates, not only are the decisions improved by unconscious thought but the atti-\ntude toward the desirable and undesirable car depends on the mode of thought.\nThe Option-Generation Framework\nA third theory that deals with the relation between knowledge and action is the\noption-generation framework by Kalis et al. (2008). Studying the weakness of will\n(a phenomenon known as acrasia), these researchers concentrated on option genera-\ntion, a little-understood process that precedes option selection and action\ninitiation.\nFigure 6.3 illustrates the idealized process of option generation, option selection,\nand action initiation and gives the background of the ideas that Kalis et al. (2008)\nhave about degenerative processes in this area. Table 6.1 affords an overview of the\nways in which dysfunctions in option generation can result in irrational behavior.\nThe table presents two dimensions\u2014dysfunction in the quantity of options (hypo-\ngeneration and hypergeneration) and dysfunction in the quality of options. The two\nrows separate instrumental irrationality from noninstrumental irrationality, meaning\nthat options can be seen either as a means to realize certain goals (i.e., the instru-\nmental understanding) or as irrationality in the goals themselves (i.e., noninstru-\nmental irrationality). This concept links knowledge and action in a special way: It\nmakes a connection between options and actions. 106 J. Funke\nFig. 6.3 Stages of decision making in our model.

(2008, pp. 407\u2013411)\nThis walk through the three theories on the connection between knowledge and\naction gives an understanding of current approaches to that area of inquiry. In this\nchapter\u2019s final section I bring to this subject empirical evidence from my own\nresearch area, problem-solving.\nEvidence From Problem-Solving Research\nWhat is meant by problem-solving? In my understanding, problem-solving is the\nintentional generation of knowledge for action instead of simple trial-and-error\nbehavior. From the perspective of a problem-solving approach, the connection\nbetween knowledge and action is a classical means\u2013end relation. The question\nremains how one can demonstrate that subjects generate knowledge intentionally 6 How Much Knowledge Is Necessary for Action? 107\nfor action? My tentative answer comes from experiments in which researchers pres-\nent subjects with problems by using multistep tasks of reasonable complexity\n(Funke, 2010).\nFigure 6.4 illustrates the MicroDyn approach, which was implemented for the\n2012 cycle of the OECD\u2019s worldwide Programme for International Student\nAssessment (PISA) (W\u00fcstenberg, Greiff, & Funke, 2012). In the upper part is a\nscreenshot of a small scenario, called \u201cHandball Training.\u201d It involves three types of\ntraining\u2014A, B, and C (input variables). The task of the problem-solver is to find out\nhow the types of training influence the three output variables (motivation, power of\nthrow, and exhaustion). The problem-solver can change the amount of training and\nwill see the response on the side displaying the output variables. Giving certain\namounts of input, as in this example, seems to increase the motivation level and\ndecrease exhaustion.\nThe experiments that my colleagues and I have designed and conducted typically\nhave three stages (see Fig. 6.5). First, subjects have to explore the system for about\n3 min. This stage is \u201cinformation retrieval\u201d because in unguided explorations sub-\njects generate information for the second stage, \u201cmodel-building.\u201d This second\nstage requires reflection about the causal model behind the different entities. There\nare assumed connections between input and output; training A, for example,\nincreases motivation only. The third stage is \u201cforecasting\u201d and requires the subjects\nto achieve given values on the various endogenous variables\u2014the output variables\nin this example\u2014by entering the correct values into the system. In such experiments\nsubjects have to work on many similar tasks. This requirement allows for psycho-\nmetrically sound measurement of the three abilities\u2014information retrieval, model-\nbuilding, and forecasting (for more details, see Greiff & Funke, 2009; W\u00fcstenberg\net al., 2012).\nAs demonstrated by the results of the studies reported in this section, a clear con-\nnection exists between the generation of knowledge and the application of that\nknowledge (action). This structural equation model with three latent variables\nshows that model-building is a major prerequisite for the two other postulated abili-\nties, forecasting and information retrieval. The fit between this model and the data\nis fine and allows acceptance of the model. My colleagues and I have also con-\nstructed a measurement model that sequences the three abilities\u2014information\nretrieval, model-building, and forecasting. It is simple, another characteristic that\nfits the data well. Our empirical results thus reveal strong connections between\nknowledge and action. Acting on a system requires knowledge about the system\u2019s\nstructure if goals are to be attained successfully.\nBerry and Broadbent (1984) argued that this system knowledge need not be ver-\nbalizable and explicit and that, instead, implicit knowledge might guide the action\nof subjects controlling a system. They even postulated a negative correlation\nbetween control performance and verbalizable knowledge. But Buchner, Funke,\nand Berry (1995) showed that this explanation is not fully convincing, for the only\nsubjects who acquired knowledge about the system were those who were not able to\naccomplish the given goal immediately. 108 J.

As I have shown, there are\nconscious and unconscious influences, and they are primarily logical, not causal.\nKaiser, W\u00f6lfing, and Fuhrer (1999), who analyzed the relation between environ-\nmental knowledge, environmental values, and ecological behavior (intention as well\nas observed behavior), concluded on the basis of structural equation modeling that\nonly 40 % of the variance in the intention that it entails was attributable to knowl-\nedge and values but that this intention explained 75 % of the variance in observed\nbehavior. From the viewpoint of action, I have concluded that it is not possible to act\nwithout knowledge but that we humans can act\u2014at least at a surface level\u2014against\nour knowledge! For God\u2019s sake, may all persons in our small world act in concor-\ndance with their knowledge.\nReferences\nAjzen, I. (1991). The theory of planned behavior.

Chapter 7\nKnowing and Not Knowing\nNico Stehr\nThe outstanding feature of a man\u2019s life in the modern world is\nhis conviction that his life-world as a whole is neither fully\nunderstood by himself nor fully understandable to any of his\nfellow-men. Alfred Sch\u00fctz ( 1946 , p. 463)\nIn the presence of the total reality upon which our conduct is\nfounded, our knowledge is characterized by peculiar limitations\nand aberrations. Georg Simmel ( 1906 , p. 444)\nA s aptly as these introductory words by Sch\u00fctz and Simmel summarize my own\nhypothesis on the presumed phenomenon of non-knowledge,1 I note that it is cap-\ntured still more precisely by economist Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s (2 005 ) formulation about\nthe \u201cinvisible hand\u201d (p. 133) ostensibly operating in the market place. Asked why\nthe invisible hand is invisible, Stiglitz gave a straightforward answer: because it\ndoes not exist. Similarly, I ask in this chapter why non-knowledge is diffi cult to\ngrasp. And my equally analogous response is: because there is no such thing as\nnon-knowledge.\nNot wishing to capitulate already at this early point, I concentrate in this chapter\non scientifi c discourses in which participants maintain that something like non-\nknowledge does exist. The knowledge/non-knowledge dichotomy appears in many\ndiscussions on the subject as a kind of performative speech act (Sartori, 1 968 ).\nHowever, it recommends only one side of that which it designates, namely, knowl-\nedge. I cannot quite sustain my doubt about the existence of not-knowing; from time\nto time I have to deviate from it and maintain that non-knowledge does exist. At the\nsame time, I draw attention to other terms that are empirically and theoretically\nmore productive than the naked assertion that non-knowledge exists. Finally, I will\npoint to a number of intriguing, but rarely studied topics relating to the question of\nthe societal function or societal treatment of apparently insuffi cient knowledge.\n1 M y usage of the term non-knowledge follows the convention in the literature that discusses the\nabsence of knowledge. The term is synonymous with not knowing and has a close affi nity but not\nidentity with ignorance . In German the term is Nichtwissen.\nN.

Stehr\nFreud and Hayek: Why Quit?\nThe treatment of non-knowledge by Sigmund Freud and Friedrich von Hayek is of\nparticular interest in this context because their approach is, if I am not mistaken,\nquite representative for much of scientifi c discourse. Both Freud and Hayek recog-\nnized that there can be no such thing as a researchable subject called non- knowledge,\nbut, unimpressed by their own conclusion, they continued to examine something\nthat does not exist. Their grappling with this issue gives me the opportunity to ask\nwhy concerning oneself with the subject of non-knowledge is typical especially for\nthe German-speaking scientifi c community. Is it a sort of eccentricity?\nFreud\u2019s (1924/1 963) theory of the dream as a psychic phenomenon is based on the\nprimary conviction that the dreamer himself should \u201csay what his dream means\u201d\n(p. 100). But an evident fundamental obstacle to doing so is that the dreamer is, as a\nrule, fi rmly convinced that he does not know what his dream means. As Freud notes,\n\u201cthe dreamer always says he knows nothing\u201d (p. 101). The lack of information from\nthe dreamer confronts Freud with an apparent scientifi c and methodological conun-\ndrum defying sound interpretation of dreams. \u201cSince he [the dreamer] knows nothing\nand we [the psychoanalyst] know nothing and a third person could know even less,\nthere seems to be no prospect of fi nding out [the dream\u2019s meaning]\u201d (p. 101).\nI nstead of accepting these fi ndings as a sound conclusion and therefore forsaking\nany further search for the meaning of dreams, Freud (1924/1 963 ) considered another\npossibility: \u201cFor I can assure you that it is quite possible, and highly probable\nindeed, that the dreamer d oes know what his dream means: o nly he does not know\nthat he knows it and for that reason thinks he does not know it\u201d (p. 101). This inter-\npretation seems to be confusing and self-contradictory. Freud even asked himself\nwhether a contradiction in terms might exist in his hypothesis that there are \u201cmental\nthings in a man which he knows without knowing that he knows them\u201d (p. 101):\nWhere, then, in what fi eld, can it be that proof has been found that there is a knowledge of\nwhich the person concerned nevertheless knows nothing, as we are proposing to assume of\ndreamers? After all, this would be a strange, surprising fact and one which would alter our\nview of mental life and which would have no need to hide itself: a fact, incidentally, which\ncancels itself in its very naming and which nevertheless claims to be something real\u2014a\ncontradiction in terms. (pp. 102\u2013103)\nFor Freud what followed from these observations was the conclusion that one ought\nto abandon this method of dream interpretation as lacking any substance. But Freud\ndid not. After all, the knowledge does not really hide from the observer. One has\nonly to search for it persistently. \u201cIt is very probable, then, that the dreamer knows\nabout his dream; the only question is how to make it possible for him to discover his\nknowledge and communicate it to us\u201d (p. 104).\nHayek, confronted with a similar dilemma, decided, just like Freud, to ignore it.\nIn his essay entitled \u201cThe Creative Powers of a Free Civilization\u201d (1960/ 1978 ), in\nwhich the lack of knowledge is a question of the distribution of knowledge in mar-\nkets, Hayek fi rst noted that any progress in civilization is the result of an increase of\nknowledge. In the real world, according to Hayek (1960/ 1978 ), it simultaneously\nholds true that \u201cthe individual benefi ts from more knowledge than he is aware of\u201d 7 Knowing and Not Knowing 115\n(p. 22), and he added that \u201cthis fundamental fact of man\u2019s unavoidable ignorance of\nmuch on which the working of civilization rests has received little attention\u201d (p. 22)\nin science.2 Human knowledge is far from being complete.\nT he key passage in Hayek\u2019s (1960/1 978) analysis of the difference between what\nhe called the \u201cboundaries of ignorance\u201d (p. 22) or man\u2019s \u201cunavoidable ignorance\u201d\n(p. 22) and \u201cconscious knowledge\u201d (p. 24) is: \u201cIt must be admitted, however, that\nour ignorance is a peculiarly diffi cult subject to discuss....We certainly cannot dis-\ncuss something intelligently about which we know nothing\u201d (p. 23). Hayek takes\nrecourse to a kind of M\u00fcnchhausen maneuver: \u201cWe must at least be able to state the\nquestions even if we do not know the answers....Though we cannot see in the dark,\nwe must be able to trace the limits of the dark areas\u201d (p. 23). Nevertheless, as Hayek\nemphasizes, \u201cIf we are to understand how society works, we must attempt to defi ne\nthe general nature and range of our ignorance concerning it\u201d (p. 23).\nThe Excess Boom in Non-knowledge\nDespite of the problems that Freud and Hayek quite obviously had with the concept of\nnon-knowledge, why has the term resonated so much in the contemporary cultural and\nsocial sciences, particularly in German-speaking countries? In the media and public dis-\ncourse alike, the category of non-knowledge is increasingly becoming a prominent and\ntrenchant monetary unit as the shady side of knowledge, but why is it gaining currency?\nThe boom in refl ection on non-knowledge certainly has to do with the essentially\ncontroversial concept of knowledge as well as with the common understanding of\nthe modern conditions for the production of knowledge, with the societal role often\nattributed to knowledge, and with the theory of modern society as a knowledge\nsociety. Is the difference between knowledge and non-knowledge an example of the\ntypically static conceptual polarity of Old European philosophy? Or is that differ-\nence basically only the widespread cultural criticism that the individual\u2014given the\nextensive and growing volume of objectifi ed knowledge in modern societies and\ngiven the sophisticated new technical and complicated methods of accessing it\u2014\ndisposes over only a minute (and probably diminishing) share of all knowledge?\nAre the widely discussed fi ndings on the average voter\u2019s alleged political ignorance,\nstupidity, and disenfranchisement and on the danger it poses to democracy a cause\nof the topicality of the subject of non-knowledge?\nIs it, on the other hand, unrealistic to assume that the average citizen, including\nthe well-educated contemporary citizen, has (or should have) suffi cient t echnical\nexpertise to intervene, for example, in the complex decision-making on economic\nquestions of the goal confl ict between infl ation and unemployment? At root, does\nthe concept of non-knowledge merely mean the societally necessary d istribution of\n2 T he German wording that Hayek chose as translations of two central concepts in his English\noriginal is of interest, and is, in my opinion, fully adequate. \u201cThe boundaries of his ignorance\u201d and\n\u201cman\u2019s unavoidable ignorance\u201d are rendered as G renzen seines Unwissen and unvermeidlichen\nUnkenntnis des Menschen (Hayek, 1960/2 005 , p. 31). In other words, there is no reference to non-\nknowledge ( Nichtwissen) . 116 N. Stehr\nknowledge? Does the concept of non-knowledge perhaps refer primarily to the\nfuture present, about which one is really little informed? Does the origin of the\nboom in observations about non-knowledge lie, under certain circumstances, in an\noverestimation of the societal role of allegedly unquestioned scientifi c knowledge\nand in an underestimation of the societal roles of knowledge?\nIn my view the societal phenomena perceived as non-knowledge can be better\ncaptured by other terms, such as \u201csystemic ignorance\u201d (Moore & Tumin, 1 949 ,\np. 789), that express how a lack of knowledge or information is manifested in mod-\nern societies and how people can deal with knowledge gaps. In any case, two keys\nto recognizing the myth of non-knowledge are the concept of knowledge itself and\nthe complicated question of distinguishing between information and knowledge.\nKnowledge as a Societal Construct\nT he discussion on the concept of non-knowledge often refl ects a liberal intermingling\nof the terms k nowledge and i nformation. I assume that one should distinguish between\nthe two, even if this differentiation is diffi cult to maintain in practice. A lack of infor-\nmation is not non-knowledge.3 Just exactly what knowledge is and how knowledge\ndiffers from information, human capital, or other intellectual or cognitive characteris-\ntics is an essentially controversial question. Neither the concept of knowledge nor the\nmanner of knowledge\u2019s production, distribution, use, or consequences can be taken\nfor granted. They constitute foregone conclusions, at least for the scientifi c observer.\nI would like to defi ne knowledge as the capacity for societal action (the capacity\nto act), as the possibility to get something going. Knowledge therefore refers to pro-\ncess knowledge. Knowledge is a model for reality. Shannon (1948/1 949) , for exam-\nple, explained how words and images can be converted into characters and transmitted\nelectronically. He thus contributed to realizing the Digital Revolution.4 According to\nShannon, the expansion of knowledge represents a broadening of the horizon of pos-\nsibilities. Whether the broadening of the possibilities for action also automatically\nrepresents an increase in the possibilities for disappointment (often also understood\nto be an increase in non-knowledge) has to be regarded as controversial. Insuffi cient\nknowledge on the part of an individual or a group accordingly means the inability of\nthose actors to mobilize knowledge in order to put something in motion.\n3 For instance, Wehling (2 009 , p. 99) characterizes the insuffi cient information \u201cDoes the guest\narrive at 5 or 6 p.m.?\u201d as a case of non-knowledge. This example is at best vague information, as I\nshow more precisely in this chapter.\n4 Dyson (2 011) described Shannon\u2019s case: \u201cIn 1945 Shannon wrote a paper, A Mathematical\nTheory of Cryptography, which was stamped SECRET and never saw the light of day. He pub-\nlished in 1948 an expurgated version of the 1945 paper with the title \u2018A Mathematical Theory of\nCommunication\u2019. The 1948 version appeared in the Bell System Technical Journal , the house\njournal of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, and became an instant classic. It is the founding docu-\nment for the modern science of information. After Shannon, the technology of information raced\nahead, with electronic computers, digital cameras, the Internet, and the World Wide Web\u201d (par.\n13). 7 Knowing and Not Knowing 117\nKnowledge exercises an active function in the societal sequence of actions only\nwhen action is not carried out in essentially stereotyped habitual (effortless) pat-\nterns or is otherwise largely regulated, that is, where there is leeway and the need for\ndecisions and where this situation necessitates mental exertion.5 , 6 The societal prac-\ntices in which decisions are possible and necessary represent the ecology of knowl-\nedge or, more exactly, of its application.\nE very implementation of knowledge, not only of great scientifi c experiments,\nrequires control of the circumstances of action (the initial conditions) through active\nagents, who, for example, want to translate laboratory successes (or a thought\nexperiment) into practice. In other words, when \u201cscientifi c knowledge is to be\n\u2018applied\u2019 in society, adaptation to the initial conditions prevailing there has to be\nmade, or societal practice has to be remodeled according to the standards set by sci-\nence\u201d (Krohn & Weyer, 1 989 , p. 354).7\nInformation and Knowledge\nI defi ne information in distinction to the concept of knowledge as follows: The con-\ntent of information concerns the characteristics of products or results (output, con-\ndition, supply), whereas the stuff that science consists of refers primarily to the\nqualities of processes or resources (input, procedures, business enterprises), which\nare used in processes. Knowledge is the capacity to act, whereas information does\nnot enable one to set anything in motion.\nI t is just as important to emphasize from the outset that information and knowl-\nedge have, to a limited extent, common attributes. The most important basic com-\nmon denominator is that neither information nor knowledge can be understood\nindependent of societal contexts. In daily life, as in the scientifi c discourse, the\nconceptual interchangeability of information and knowledge is extensive. It is none-\ntheless notable that public places such as airports, shopping centers, railroad sta-\ntions, and highway roadhouses commonly do not have a knowledge stand but rather\n5 A variant of these thoughts worth considering\u2014one quoted by Hayek (1960/1 978 , p. 22)\u2014can be\nfound in Whitehead\u2019s ( 1911 ) Introduction to Mathematics: \u201cCivilization advances by increasing\nthe number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations\nof thought are like cavalry charges in a battle\u2014they are strictly limited in number, they require\nfresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments\u201d (p. 61).\n6 Luhmann\u2019s (1 992) observations about the preconditions for the possibility of making a decision\nmay permit a still broader application of knowledge. \u201cOne can only decide,\u201d as he very plausibly\nunderlines, \u201cwhen and to which extent it is not certain what will happen\u201d (p. 136). On the premise\nthat the future is highly uncertain, the lack of knowledge in decision-making processes can extend\nover many other societal contexts, too, and thereby also to those that are normally characterized by\nroutines and habitual behavior.\n7 Hans Radder (1 986) arrived at a similar conclusion when he pointed out that material as well as\nsocial prerequisites ultimately have to be met for long-term practical success in technical produc-\ntion: \u201cThe creation and maintenance of particular social conditions (for example, a bureaucratic\nand centralist administration in the case of nuclear energy) is necessary in order to be able to\nguarantee the permanent technological success of a project\u201d (p. 675). 118 N. Stehr\nan information stand. The blending of these terms will probably continue to prevail\nin practice, in science and everyday life alike, because who can distinguish between\nthe information society and the knowledge society?\nObserving Non-knowledge, and Some of the Questions I Ask\nMyself in the Process\nW ith these observations in mind, I try to ascertain what could or could not be meant\nwhen one speaks of non-knowledge. People\u2019s actions are guided by knowledge.\nKnowledge of others and self-knowledge are prerequisites for socialization. Hence, as\nSimmel (1 906) noted, knowledge is an anthropological constant: \u201cAll relationships of\npeople to each other rest, as a matter of course, upon the precondition that they know\nsomething about each other\u201d (p. 441). There can be no societal actors without knowl-\nedge. One is just as far from being unknowing w ithout knowledge as one is naked\nwithout a headscarf. A society without secrets is inconceivable. Ignoring knowledge\nand information is sensible, even rational. A society in which there is total transpar-\nency is impossible. Knowledge is never created out of nothing. Knowledge, or the\nrevision of knowledge, arises out of already existing knowledge (not out of forms of\nnon-knowledge). The existence of a n on- knowledge society is just as questionable as\nthat of a human society without language. Humans live in a complex society marked\nby a high degree of functional differentiation in which almost all of its members are\nnon-knowledgeable about almost all knowledge. Knowledge in the broad sense meant\nin this chapter is not restricted to any particular social system in modern societies.\nThus, knowledge is everywhere (Luhmann, 1 990 , p. 147).\nIt is useful to ignore information and knowledge. Each individual knows that his\nor her knowledge is limited. Yet people profi t a great deal from knowledge they are\nnot acquainted with. What indicators could be used to characterize a non- knowledge\nsociety empirically? Almost half of the American population is convinced that the\nEarth is younger than 10,000 years old. Is the American society for that reason a\nnon-knowledge society?\nWho or what is the standard of comparison when one speaks of the duality of\nnon-knowledge and knowledge or of the relationship of knowledge to non-\nknowledge (as k nown unknowns )? Is it the individual or rather a collective?\nPrivileging the individual is common. To put it more stringently, does the concept of\nnon-knowledge mean a single process, a single quality (information), or the progno-\nsis of an occurrence? How long must (or can) non-knowledge be perceptibly recog-\nnizable in order to be non-knowledge? Can cluelessness, for example, last only for\nseconds? Does one refer to individual forms of knowledge (or information) that the\nisolated individual (e.g., a scientist) or a non-knowledgeable collective does not\u2014\nand cannot\u2014have because one always proceeds selectively or is forced to fi lter?\nK nowledge, by contrast, is a variable societal phenomenon that lies on an indi-\nvisible continuum and points to the existence of the elementary distribution of\nknowledge in complex societies. No clear-cut difference between knowledge and\nnon-knowledge exists. Knowledge is a total societal phenomenon. 7 Knowing and Not Knowing 119\nThere is no comprehensive knowledge; nobody can know everything. Acting\nunder conditions of uncertainty is commonplace. Knowledge of these gaps is\nknowledge. But knowledge of gaps does not belong in the category of non-\nknowledge if it is a case of negative knowledge (to the extent that one fi nds this\ndesignation helpful). Actually, one can often close this gap quickly because it is\npossible to know or fi nd out who might know it (a task fulfi lled by the role of\nexperts, for instance). On the other hand, there are things that everyone, or almost\neveryone, knows or about which almost everyone is informed (e.g., the fact that\nalmost every human has two eyes or that there is such a thing as weather or climate).\nThere are a number of expressions that are both empirically and practically more\nproductive than n on-knowledge and nonetheless illuminate the horizon of problems\nthat non-knowledge allegedly comprises. In the following section I limit myself to\njust one of these possibilities.\nAsymmetric Information/Knowledge\nI n an infl uential article entitled \u201cThe Market for Lemons,\u201d the economist and later\nNobel Laureate George Akerlof (1 970 ) paved the way to a systematic analysis of\nasymmetric information by conducting an exemplary analysis of the respective\ninformation that buyers and sellers of used cars had. An asymmetric state of infor-\nmation is one of the fundamental characteristics of various classes of participants in\nthe used-car market. As a rule, the owner and the driver of the used car on sale have\nmuch more detailed knowledge about the dependability and history of the vehicle\u2019s\nmechanical problems than the potential purchaser does. In a credit agreement the\ndebtor is guided by certain intentions to repay the credit or not. The lender usually\nhas no access to that information. Nor can the lender be certain that the debtor\u2019s\nintended investment will actually be profi table. Generally speaking, asymmetric\ninformation on the part of market participants should lead to market failure.\nBuyers and sellers, lenders and debtors are often conscious of the fact that there\nis or can be a state of asymmetric information. It follows that the buyer or lender\nseek indicators that diminish the mistrust in the available information or allow that\ninformation to be considered more or less reliable. Because the transaction costs of\nthe acquisition of relevant information might be high, the very accessibility of the\ninformation on the seller\u2019s or debtor\u2019s social reputation will likely be an important\nindicator for the lender or buyer.\nF rom Akerlof\u2019s deliberations and those of other economists (e.g., Chappori &\nSalanie, 2 000; Sharpe, 1 990 ; Wang, 2 012) , I derive the following general lesson for\nmy analysis of the antithesis of information and knowledge: Because societal\nknowledge is scattered asymmetrically rather than evenly distributed, one has to\nassume a cognitive-societal functional differentiation in all societal institutions.8\n8 In memory research an extreme example of asymmetric information has recently come under\nstudy\u2014the few people who have \u201csuperior autobiographical memory\u201d (Parker, Cahill, & McGaugh,\n2006 , p. 36), that is, the ability to recall every single day of their lives or to remember the occur-\nrences of every single day. 120 N. Stehr\nIn science such a cognitive division is not only perceived as a matter of course but\nis also generally understood to be a functional characteristic of science as an institu-\ntion. Not every scientist can work on just any question. And the role of every scien-\ntist cannot be classifi ed in relation to itself, but only in relation to that of other\nscientists. It is therefore natural to speak of a cognitive functional differentiation in\nall societal institutions. In other words, it can make sense only to speak of a range\nof knowledge in groups of actors in comparison to symmetrically limited knowl-\nedge in other groups of actors, and not of knowledge and non-knowledge.\nOn the Virtues (Advantages?) of Non-knowledge\nThe functional meaning of non-knowledge differs from one societal institution to\nthe next. In an institution such as science it is a state of development of knowledge\nthat must be overcome, a condition that acts as an incentive. In a highly stratifi ed\nsocietal institution (e.g., a total institution) differing states of knowledge are a con-\nstitutive characteristic feature (a functional necessity) that is defended by all means.\nA society in which complete transparency prevails would be, as Merton (1949/1 968 )\nemphasized, \u201cdiabolical\u201d (p. 345). In practice, a mutually transparent, complex\nsociety is unrealistic.\nMoore and Tulmin (1 949, p. 787), in their classical functionalist analysis of the\nsocietal functions of ignorance, therefore pointed to what in their opinion is the wide-\nspread opinion that ignorance is the natural enemy of societal stability and of the\npossibility for orderly societal progress and that every increase in knowledge auto-\nmatically increases human welfare. A generally positive public attitude toward new\nknowledge, which was widespread in the years immediately following World War II,\nis at present losing ground to growing skepticism about new scientifi c and technical\nknowledge. It is not unusual anymore to encounter the opinion that people know too\nmuch. Explicit knowledge politics, that is, efforts to police novel knowledge, com-\nmences once new capacities for action have been discovered (Stehr, 2 003 ).\nT here is a multitude of convincing references to the virtues and advantages of\nignorance, a lack of knowledge, and invisibility. The discussion and formulation of\nthe novel moral principle for an individual\u2019s \u201cright to ignorance\u201d by Jonas (1 974 ,\npp. 161\u2212163) is clearly germane to a discussion of the political and ethical dilem-\nmas generated by the dynamics with which knowledge grows. Jonas\u2019s moral prin-\nciple is opposed by equally formidable ethical demands that insist on a right to\nknow, especially at the collective level or from a macroperspective (Sen, 1 981 ;\nStiglitz, 1999) . In everyday life, sentiments that support the virtue of not knowing\nfi nd expression in such sayings as \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt me\u201d and \u201cWhere\nignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise.\u201d\nOpposition to excessive transparency of one\u2019s own behavior and that of other\nactors, as Merton (1949/1 968, p. 343) also emphasized, stems from certain struc-\ntural characteristics of societal groups. To these features belong, for instance, the 7 Knowing and Not Knowing 121\ninstitutionally sanctioned, but in reality also limited, negligence in complying with\nor enforcing existing social norms. The characteristics also include psychologically\ndetermined, variable opposition to maximum behavioral transparency (Popitz,\n1968 , p. 8).9 In modern society technical and legal barriers and these conditions for\nopposition preclude an unlimited investigation of the behavior and convictions of\nindividual actors\u2014about whom one would like to know everything. The alleged\ngoodwill or maliciousness of the thought police is irrelevant. For instance, new pos-\nsibilities for avoiding technically mobilized monitoring keep turning up.\nPopitz (1 968) , on the other hand, pointed to the d isencumbering function that\nlimited behavioral information has for the system of sanctions.1 0 Limiting the avail-\nable or requested behavioral information\u2014a decision that is tantamount to relin-\nquishing sanctions\u2014is also a sort of \u201cindeterminacy principle of social life\u201d (p. 12).\nIt \u201copens a sphere in which the system of norms and sanctions need not be taken\nliterally without obviously giving up its claim to validity\u201d (p. 12).\nL astly, there is a further (primarily cognitive) function of insuffi cient knowledge.\nIt has repeatedly been claimed that knowledge arises from non-knowledge, or that\nnon-knowledge can be transformed into knowledge. Just how this transformation is\nsupposed to happen is scarcely addressed, however. The hypothesis that knowledge\noriginates in non-knowledge as it were, in nothing (e x nihilo) , completely overlooks\nthe societal genealogy of knowledge, such as the close, even intimate relationship\nbetween scientifi c and practical knowledge. The birth of a scientifi c discipline is no\nparthenogenesis. The hypothesis of the transformation of non-knowledge into\nknowledge favors certain knowledge in that the origin of new knowledge is simply\nsuppressed.\nThe Societal-Cognitive Functional Differentiation\nBetween Non-knowledge and Societally Determined\nKnowledge Gaps\nOne of the self-evident realities in a modern society, with its functionally differenti-\nated cognitive structure, is that individuals, societal groups, and societal institutions\nhave long since given up as an illusion the wish, or the hope, for their knowledge to\nbe self-suffi cient. Limited knowledge alleviates. Knowledge is unequally\n9 Inasmuch as the disregard and sanctioning of existing social norms by certain incumbents of\nsocietal positions of a group is known, it must be decided whether \u201cthe basic formal structure of a\ngroup is being undermined by the observed deviations of behavior. It is in this sense that authorities\ncan have excessive knowledge of what is actually going on, so that this becomes dysfunctional for\nthe system of social control\u201d (Merton, 1949/1 968 , p. 343; emphasis added).\n10 In this respect I note that the expression non-knowledge ( Nichtwissen) in the title of Popitz\u2019s\ntreatise does not appear a single time in the text. The work\u2019s title may be the work of the publishing\nhouse. The exposition shows that Popitz rightly avoided the term non-knowledge and more guard-\nedly wrote of limited behavioral information and limited behavioral transparency. 122 N. Stehr\ndistributed. As a rule, managers do not themselves have the technical knowledge of\ntheir employed laborers, engineers, or assembly-line workers.1 1 Despite this lack of\nknowledge, managers still become managers.\nK nowledge gaps or incomprehensive forms of knowledge distribution, not non-\nknowledge, are a constitutive element of functionally differentiated societies.\nAsymmetrical stocks of knowledge do not lead to society\u2019s collapse. A society\u2019s\nability to act competently is not a function of the knowledge and information of\nisolated individual actors. A competent actor, for instance, as a politically active\ncitizen, need not be comprehensively informed as an individual.\nA society without this fundamental limitation, without this cognitive functional\ndifferentiation, is inconceivable. No one has to know everything. But this elemen-\ntary fact, which determines the way society is, does not justify the conclusion that\nthat non-knowledge is the opposite of knowledge. A being constantly caught up in\nnon-knowledge cannot exist. The more collective knowledge increases,\nthe smaller the share of all that knowledge becomes that any o ne mind can absorb. The\nmore civilized we become, the more relatively ignorant must each individual be of the facts\non which the working of his civilization depends. The very division of knowledge increases\nthe necessary ignorance of the individual and most of this knowledge. (Hayek, 1960/ 1978 ,\np. 26, emphasis added)\nAbandoning the hope for autarkic knowledge, especially the i ndividual self-\nsuffi ciency of knowledge, and giving up the conviction that knowledge is funda-\nmentally limited (bounded) entails both costs and benefi ts. But the loss of\nautarky\u2014inasmuch as autarky had ever existed, even in traditional societies\u2014is\nnever to be understood as a form of non-knowledge. Societal innovations such as\nthe market and the scientifi c or political system help manage knowledge gaps\n(P\u00e9rez, Florin, & Whitelock, 2 012 ).\nRelevant functionally differentiated scales of knowledge differ according to fac-\nets such as their respective epoch, the type of society, the pattern of societal inequal-\nity, and the interests of the dominant worldview.1 2 In modern complex societies the\nscale of knowledge is longer than in traditional societies. The distance to the sources\nof knowledge is often great. Personal acquaintance with the knowledge producer is\nnot necessary. Only in exceptional cases does the knowledge that one does not have,\nbut can obtain, include the knowledge that was necessary for the production, legiti-\nmation, and distribution of the knowledge acquired.\n11 Collinson\u2019s (1 994 ) examination of labor resistance\u2014based on two case studies\u2014drew on the\nemphasis that Clegg ( 1989) placed on knowledge and information of subordinates and outlines\ngenerally \u201cthe importance of different forms of knowledge in the articulation of resistance\u201d (p. 25).\nCollinson summarized his fi ndings and pointed out that \u201cspecifi c forms of knowledge are a crucial\nresource and means through which resistance can be mobilized. Knowledge in organizations is\nmultiple, contested and shifting. Employees may not possess detailed underpinnings of certain\nbureaucratic/political processes, but they often do monopolize other technical, production-related\nknowledges that facilitate their oppositional practices\u201d (p. 28).\n12 T he concept of the scales of knowledge has a parallel in the concept of the degrees of property\nrights, which are calibrated according to the labor, need, or performance, that is, the merits, of the\nowner (Neumann, 2 009 ). 7 Knowing and Not Knowing 123\nOutlook\nThe current intense debate among social scientists, with its radical polarization of\nknowledge and non-knowledge, is like an echo from a lost world or the wish to be\nable to live in this lost, but secure, world. It was a world in which knowledge was\nreliable, objective, ontologically well-founded, truthful, realistic, uniform, and\nundisputed. It was a world in which scientifi c knowledge was unique and the pro-\nfane world of nonscientifi c knowledge was largely disqualifi ed. It was a world in\nwhich more knowledge alone\u2014such as that which enables one to act successfully\nin practice\u2014was always superior to having no additional knowledge (knowledge\nbias). The world of unquestioned knowledge has vanished. Unclear is whether the\ndisappearance of such knowledge is a real loss, as one is evidently supposed to\nbelieve from talk of the divide between non-knowledge and knowledge, or whether\nit is a form of intellectual emancipation.\nT he difference between knowledge and non-knowledge is an old European\nantithesis with an ancestry harking back to premodern cultures. The old European\ntradition of a dichotomy of non-knowledge and knowledge becomes apparent espe-\ncially in the attribution of persons or groups to one of these two categories. Such\nascription holds that the unknowing person or, more generally, the unknowing social\nclass is not only helplessly exposed to the power of knowledge but also pitiable and\nbackward. And inasmuch as the occurrence of non-knowledge applies to other\nsocieties and cultures, it is foreign knowledge\u2014not one\u2019s own\u2014that is non-knowl-\nedge. As described by Fleck (1935/1 979 ): \u201cWhatever is known has always seemed\nsystematic, proven, applicable, and evident to the knower. Every alien system of\nknowledge has likewise seemed contradictory, unproven, inapplicable, fanciful, or\nmystical\u201d (p. 22).\nF or that reason these traditional deliberations on the great divide between knowl-\nedge and non-knowledge come nowhere close to resolving the dilemma described\nby Luhmann (1 991 ): \u201cIs the generally held assumption that more communication,\nmore refl ection, more knowledge, more learning, more participation\u2014that more of\nall of this would bring about something good or, in any sense, nothing bad\u2014at all\njustifi ed?\u201d (p. 90, my translation). The emerging political fi eld of knowledge poli-\ntics is dedicated to this societal dilemma posed by the risks of knowledge (Stehr,\n2003 ).\nO ne should not insist on an absolute antithesis of knowledge and non-\nknowledge\u2014there is only less or more knowledge and those who know something\nand those who know something else. The practical problem is always to know how\nmuch or how little one knows in a given situation. A person is not either knowledge-\nable or unknowing. A person has more knowledge in one context than in another: A\nperson may know a great deal about tax regulations but hardly anything about play-\ning golf.\nActors (including scientists) react to complex societal forms by simplifying men-\ntal constructs of these relationships. The mental constructs are, in fact, incomplete\ninasmuch as they do not depict reality in its full complexity. These simple models 124 N. Stehr\nchange, react to the unexpected, but are hardly non-knowledge. One of the advan-\ntages of liberal democracies is the consciousness that omniscience can be dangerous\nand that safeguarding privacy must remain a form of sanctioned ignorance.\nAcknowledgements Robert Avila translated an early draft of this chapter from German.

Chapter 8\nHow Representations of Knowledge Shape\nActions\nRalph Hertwig and Renato Frey\nIn 2009 the world found itself in the midst of the worst recession since the Great\nDepression. Events thought of as extremely unlikely, such as the burst of the U.S.\nhousing boom, the meltdown of the fi nancial system, and the bankruptcy of colossal\ncompanies, happened in breathtakingly fast succession. Why was the world so\nbadly prepared for these improbabilities? One explanation is that the crisis of the\nfi nancial industry preceding the economic recession occurred because the industry\u2019s\nsupposedly optimal risk-management models failed to reckon with \u201cblack swans\u201d\n(Taleb, 2 007) \u2014unexpected and unpredictable rare events that carry an enormous\nimpact. Of course, modern risk-management paradigms were not alone in failing to\ntake the black-swan event into account\u2014so did individual players, such as many\nhomeowners who could no longer afford their mortgages. Can psychological theo-\nries and fi ndings account for such blind spots?\nAt fi rst glance, the answer is no. Infl uential studies in behavioral decision\nresearch consistently suggest the opposite propensity: People are oversensitive to\nrare events. For example, they overestimate the chance of getting food poisoning or\nof contracting lung cancer from smoking (Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman,\n& Combs, 1 978 ; Viscusi, 2 002 ). Moreover, people are depicted as remembering\npast experiences by how they felt at their peak (rare moment) and end (Redelmeier\n& Kahneman, 1 996) . Such oversensitivity is not only empirically observed but also\ntheoretically suggested. According to the most infl uential descriptive theory of risky\nchoice, people overweight low-probability events (Tversky & Kahneman, 1 992 ). In\nfact, cumulative prospect theory explains the puzzling co-occurrence of two\nR.

Frey\nbehaviors\u2014that the same people who purchase lottery tickets promising tiny\nchances of winning (thus being risk-seeking) also take out insurance against tiny\nchances of damage (thus being risk averse; Friedman & Savage, 1948 )\u2014on the\nassumption that small probabilities receive too much weight.\nIn light of people\u2019s ostensible oversensitivity to rare events, why did so many\npeople, fi nancial experts and laypeople alike, behave as though they were not cog-\nnizant of the rare events that triggered what some observers called a bona-fi de\ndepression (Posner, 2 009) ? Analyses have highlighted a variety of enabling factors,\nranging from purportedly rational bankers who acted on strong incentives to take\nmaximum risks in their lending (Posner, 2 009 ) to humans\u2019 \u201canimal spirits\u201d (Akerlof\n& Shiller, 2 009 ). However, there is another possibly enabling condition. The cus-\ntomary portrayal of humans as being oversensitive to rare events obscures the evi-\ndence that people, when recruiting their experience sampled across time to make\nrisky decisions, tend to accord rare events (such as the burst of housing bubbles) less\nweight than they deserve according to their objective probabilities.\nThe Description\u2013Experience Gap\nJust as biologists use the D rosophila as one model organism, behavioral-decision\nresearchers have used choice between monetary gambles as a model for risky\nchoice, assuming that many real-world options have the same properties as gam-\nbles, namely, n outcomes and associated probabilities (Lopes, 1 983 ). Moreover,\nmany researchers have grown accustomed to presenting their respondents with one\nparticular genus of the fruit fl y: gambles in which all outcomes and their probabili-\nties are stated and respondents make a single choice. Figure 8 .1 illustrates typical\ndescription-based decision-making problems.\nI n everyday life, however, people can rarely peruse such descriptions of probabil-\nity distributions\u2014although there are a few exceptions, such as media weather fore-\ncasts stating probabilities of precipitation (Gigerenzer, Hertwig, Van Den Broek,\nFasolo, & Katsikopoulos, 2 005) . When people decide whether to take out a loan or\ncontemplate the success of a fi rst date, there are no risk tables to consult. Instead,\npeople need to rely on whatever experience they have had with these options, making\ndecisions based on experience rather than on description (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, &\nErev, 2004 ). Both kinds of decision can be understood as opposite poles on a con-\ntinuum of uncertainty about what one is choosing between. In Knight\u2019s ( 1921 ) termi-\nnology, decisions from descriptions involve a priori probabilities , whereas decisions\nfrom experience involve statistical probabilities, which one must assess \u201cif at all, by\ntabulating the results of experience\u201d (p. 215), so they invariably fall short of the stan-\ndards of accuracy set by a priori probabilities (Hau, Pleskac, & Hertwig, 2 010 ).\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, before modern behavioral-decision research, sci-\nentists who studied decision-making investigated decisions from experience. They\nexamined, for example, whether and how people learn the probability structure of\nan outcome distribution through trial-by-trial feedback (for a review see Luce & a b\nChoose between\nA: -3 with certainty -3 Sampling\nor\n0\nB: -32 with probability .1\n0 with probability .9\n-3\n0\n-3\n-32\n-3\n-3 Choice\nTime\nc d\n0 Choice -3 0 Choice\n-3 -3 0\n0 -3 0\n0 -3 0\n0 -3 0\n-32 -3 0\n-3 -3 -32\nTime Time\nFig. 8.1 How to study decisions from descriptions and experience. The choice task in decisions\nfrom description typically consists of two monetary gambles with explicitly stated outcomes and\ntheir probabilities ( a ). In decisions from experience, three paradigms have been employed. The\nsampling paradigm ( b ) consists of an initial sampling stage (here represented by seven fi ctitious\ndraws) in which a person explores two payoff distributions without costs by clicking on one of the\ntwo buttons on the computer screen, followed by an outcome drawn from the respective distribu-\ntion. The buttons chosen by a participant are marked in red . After terminating sampling, the person\nsees a choice screen ( green screen) and is asked to select the button to draw once for real. The\npartial-feedback paradigm (c ) combines sampling and choice, thus each draw represents both an\nact of exploration and an act of exploitation. The respondent receives feedback regarding the\nobtained payoff after each draw from the chosen button (r ed box) . The f ull-feedback paradigm (d )\nis identical to the partial-feedback paradigm, except that it also provides feedback concerning the\nforgone payoff (i.e., the payoff that the person would have received had she chosen the other\noption; white box) (Reprinted from Hertwig and Erev ( 2009 , p. 518) with permission from Elsevier) 130 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\nSuppes, 1 965) . The impracticality of the research designs\u2014purportedly hundreds of\ntrials are needed before behavior stabilizes\u2014may have been the reason that modern\nbehavioral-decision research turned away from the transients of learning (for an\nexception see, for example, Busemeyer, 1 985 ). Moreover, with the increasing\nimportance of expected utility theory, the study of anomalies became pertinent,\nwhich required the conveying of perfect information about the probabilities of rel-\nevant events (Fig. 8 .1a) . Interest in issues of learning and experience-based deci-\nsions, however, remained alive in other fi elds, such as operation research (see\nliterature on multiarmed bandit problems; Sutton & Barto, 1 998 ).\nModern decision-making researchers\u2019 interest in decisions from experience has\nbeen rekindled by the recent observation of systematic and robust differences\nbetween them and decisions from description. Research on decisions from experi-\nence has come with a simple experimental tool, a \u201ccomputerized money machine.\u201d\nRespondents see two buttons on a computer screen, each one representing an ini-\ntially unknown payoff distribution. Clicking a button results in a random draw from\nthe respective distribution. Three variations of this experimental tool have been\nemployed. In the s ampling paradigm (Fig. 8 .1b ), people fi rst sample as many out-\ncomes as they wish and only then decide from which distribution to make a single\ndraw for real (Hertwig et al., 2004 ; Weber, Shafi r, & Blais, 2004 ). In the full-\nfeedback paradigm (Fig. 8.1d) , there is a limited number of draws (typically 100),\neach of which contributes to people\u2019s earnings, and they receive draw-by-draw\nfeedback on the obtained and the forgone payoffs (i.e., payoff received had the other\noption been selected; Yechiam & Busemeyer, 2 006 ). The p artial-feedback para-\ndigm (Fig. 8.1c ) is identical to the full-feedback paradigm, except that people learn\nabout the obtained payoffs only (Barron & Erev, 2 003; Erev & Barron, 2 005 ).\nUnlike the fi rst two paradigms, the partial-feedback paradigm presents respondents\nwith an exploitation\u2013exploration trade-off. Exploitation and exploration represent\ntwo alternative goals associated with every choice, namely, to obtain a desired out-\ncome (exploitation) or to gather new information about other, perhaps better, actions\n(exploration; Cohen, McClure, & Yu, 2 007 ).\nA cross all three experiential paradigms, a robust and systematic description\u2013\nexperience gap has emerged in numerous studies. Figure 8 .2 illustrates this gap in\nsix decision-making problems (Erev et al., 2 010) . Each one offers a choice between\na risky option with two outcomes and a safe option. In the risky options, either the\ndesirable outcome or the less desirable outcome occurs with low probability (.1 or\nless). In all three experiential paradigms, respondents tend to select the risky option\nwhen the desirable outcome occurs with high probability, and they select the safe\noption when the desirable outcome occurs with low probability. This tendency is\nreversed in decisions from description. The general pattern can be summarized as\nfollows: In decisions from experience, people behave as if the rare events have less\nimpact than they deserve according to their objective probabilities, whereas in deci-\nsions from description people behave as if the rare events have more impact than\nthey deserve (consistent with cumulative prospect theory). 8 How Representations of Knowledge Shape Actions 131\n1\nSampling Paradigm\nseciohC\nPartial-feedback Paradigm\n0.8\nFull-feedback Paradigm\nDecision from Description\nyksiR\n0.6\nfo\nnoitroporP\n0.4\n0.2\n0\nProblem 1 2 3 4 5 6\nSafe option 7 -4.1 11.5 2.2 6.8 11\nRisky option\nMaximum 16.5 1.3 25.6 3 7.3 11.4\np (maximum) .01 .05 .10 .93 .96 .97\nMinimum 6.9 -4.3 8.1 -7.2 -8.5 1.9\nExpected value 7 -4.0 9.9 2.3 6.7 11.1\nFig. 8.2 Proportion of choices of the risky option as a function of the probability of the more\ndesirable outcome in 6 of 120 problems studied in Erev et al.

Each problem was studied using the\nfour paradigms listed in Fig. 8.1 (Erev et al., 2 010 ; the data from the full-feedback paradigm are\nunpublished). Participants (20 per paradigm) were paid (in shekels) for one of their choices, ran-\ndomly selected. The partial- and full-feedback paradigms involved 100 choices per problem, and\nthe reported proportions are the means over these choices and participants (Reprinted from Hertwig\nand Erev ( 2009 , p. 519) with permission from Elsevier)\nWhat Causes the Description\u2013Experience Gap?\nSeveral causes may be contributing to the description\u2013experience gap.\nSmall Samples\nT wo classes of factors have been identifi ed as shaping the search process in the\nsampling paradigm: properties of the decision-making problems (e.g., the magni-\ntude of the incentives, see Hau, Pleskac, Kiefer, & Hertwig, 2 008 ; and whether the\noutcomes are gains or losses, see Lejarraga, Hertwig, & Gonzalez, 2012 ) and 132 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\nindividual characteristics, such as people\u2019s emotional state (Frey, Hertwig, &\nRieskamp, 2 014) or age (Frey et al. 2 015) . However, across numerous studies\n(reviewed in Hau et al., 2 010 ), respondents typically proved restrained in their\ninformation search, with a median number of samples per choice problem typically\nranging between 11 and 19. These results suggest that reliance on small samples is\none factor that contributes to the attenuated impact of rare events (Hertwig et al.,\n2004) . For small samples the chances are that a person does not even experience the\nrare events. More generally, one is more likely to undersample than oversample the\nrare event, for the binomial distribution of the number of times a particular outcome\nwill be observed in n independent trials is markedly skewed when p is small (i.e.,\nthe event is rare) and n is small (i.e., few outcomes are sampled). Interestingly, reli-\nance on small samples has also been discussed as a potential explanation for bum-\nblebees\u2019 underweighting of rare events: Studying foraging decisions by bees in a\nspatial arrangement of fl owers that promise with varying probabilities different\namounts of nectar, Real (1 991 ) concluded that \u201cbumblebees underperceive rare\nevents and overperceive common events\u201d (p. 985). He explained this distortion in\nbees\u2019 probability perception as a consequence of their sampling behavior\u2014\u201cbees\nframe their decisions on the basis of only a few visits\u201d (Real, 1 992, p. 133)\u2014and\nsuggested that such reliance on small samples can be adaptive.\nShort-term optimization may be adaptive when there is a high degree of spatial autocorrela-\ntion in the distribution of fl oral rewards. In most fi eld situations, there is intense local com-\npetition among pollinators for fl oral resources. When \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d spots in fi elds of\nfl owers are created through pollinator activity, then such activity will generate a high degree\nof spatial autocorrelation in nectar rewards. If information about individual fl owers is\npooled, then the spatial structure of reward distributions will be lost, and foraging over the\nentire fi eld will be less effi cient. In spatially autocorrelated environments (\u201crugged land-\nscapes\u201d), averaging obscures the true nature of the environment. (p. 135)\nC ould there be any advantage to frugal sampling in experience-based decisions\nby humans? Hertwig and Pleskac (2 008 , 2 010) proposed one possible advantage\nthat rests on the notion of amplifi cation. Unlike Real ( 1992) , however, they argued\nthat amplifi cation proffers a cognitive rather than an evolutionary benefi t. Through\nmathematical analysis and computer simulation, Hertwig and Pleskac (2 010 )\nshowed that small samples amplify the difference between the options\u2019 average\nrewards. That is, drawing small samples from payoff distributions results in experi-\nenced differences of sample means that are larger than the objective difference.\nSuch amplifi ed absolute differences simplify the choice between gambles and\nthereby explain the frugal sampling behavior observed in investigations of decisions\nfrom experience\u2014a conjecture for which Hertwig and Pleskac (2 010) found empir-\nical evidence.\nT he explanation of the description\u2013experience gap in terms of small samples has\nprompted a critical response (Fox & Hadar, 2 006) and has led to an ongoing debate.\nWhat appears to be underweighting of rare events in decisions from experience\ncould be consistent with overweighting of low probabilities as assumed in cumula-\ntive prospect theory. When the probability experienced in a sample is smaller than\nthe event\u2019s objective probability, people may still overweight this sample p robability. 8 How Representations of Knowledge Shape Actions 133\nDespite this overweighting, the erroneous impression of underweighting would\nemerge if the o verweighting did not fully compensate for the u nderestimation that\nresults from the skew in small samples. In this view the description\u2013experience gap\nis statistical (sampling error) rather than psychological in nature.\nS everal approaches have been taken to examine whether the gap observed in the\nsampling paradigm can indeed be reduced to sampling error. If sampling error was\nthe sole culprit, then reducing the error by extending the sample should attenuate\nand eventually eliminate the gap. Increasing sample sizes substantially (up to 50 and\n100 draws per choice problem) reduced but did not eliminate the gap (Hau et al.,\n2008 , 2010) . If sampling error caused the gap, then removing the error by aligning\nthe sample\u2019s experienced probabilities to the objective probabilities should elimi-\nnate it. It did not (Ungemach, Chater, & Stewart, 2 009) . If sampling error was the\nsole root of the gap, then presenting respondents in the description condition the\nsame information that others experienced (y oking ) should eliminate the gap. In one\nstudy it did (Rakow, Demes, & Newell, 2 008) ; in another it did for small samples\nbut not for large ones (Hau et al., 2 010; see these authors\u2019 discussion of trivial\nchoices as one possible explanation for the mixed results obtained). The gap per-\nsisted even when people were presented both descriptions and experience rather\nthan descriptions only (Jessup, Bishara, & Busemeyer, 2 008 ).\nIn summary, the reality of the description\u2013experience gap across the three expe-\nriential paradigms is unchallenged\u2014its cause, however, is disputed. Some research-\ners have argued that the gap in the sampling paradigm is statistical in nature (Fox &\nHadar, 2 006; Hadar & Fox, 2009; Rakow et al., 2008) ; others have proposed that the\nsampling error is not the sole cause (Hau et al., 2 008 , 2 010 ; Hertwig et al., 2 004 ;\nUngemach et al., 2 009 ). Regardless of how this debate will advance, it is informa-\ntive to go beyond the sampling paradigm. Reliance on small samples, for example,\ncannot be the reason behind the description\u2013experience gap in the full-feedback\nparadigm (Fig. 8 .1d ) paradigm, in which the impact of rare events is attenuated even\nafter a hundred trials with perfect feedback. Beyond sampling error, what psycho-\nlogical factors may be in play?\nRecency\nA psychological factor that may contribute to the description\u2013experience gap is\nrecency (Hertwig et al., 2 004) . Ubiquitously observed in memory, belief updating,\nand judgments (Hogarth & Einhorn, 1 992) , recency refers to the phenomenon that\nobservations made late in a sequence receive more weight than they deserve (i.e.,\nmore than 1/ n ). Recency is closely related to reliance on small samples: The small\nsample of recent events can reintroduce the aforementioned skew into large samples\nof experience. Although the original fi nding was that people give more weight to\nrecent than to previous outcomes in the fl ow of their experience (Hertwig et al.,\n2004 ), little or no impact of recency was observed in later studies (Hau et al., 2 010 ;\nRakow et al., 2 008 ; Ungemach et al., 2 009 ). 134 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\nEstimation Error\nIn theory, the description\u2013experience gap could also be the result of a systematic\nestimation error (Fox & Hadar, 2 006) , with people systematically underestimating\nthe frequencies of the rare event experienced in the sample. Studies of frequency\nand probability assessments, however, commonly report overestimation of rare\nevents (Hertwig, Pachur, & Kurzenh\u00e4user, 2 005 ; Lichtenstein et al., 1 978 ).\nMoreover, studies recording people\u2019s estimates of rare events in the sampling para-\ndigm found them to be well calibrated or a little too high relative to the experienced\nfrequency (Hau et al., 2008 ; Ungemach et al., 2009 ). That is, people do not system-\natically estimate rare things to be even rarer than they statistically are.\nContingent Sampling\nStill another factor that could underlie the description\u2013experience gap, especially in\nthe feedback paradigm, is the notion that people inform their decisions by recruiting\nrecent and past experiences garnered in similar situations (for related notions see\nGilboa & Schmeidler, 1 995 ; Gonzalez, Lerch, & Lebiere, 2 003 ). Such contingent\nsampling is likely to be ubiquitous in the wild (Klein, 1 999 ). For example, when\nfi refi ghters need to predict the behavior of a fi re, they appear to retrieve from mem-\nory similar instances from the past. Contingent sampling implies recency and reli-\nance on small sampling to the extent that similarity decreases with time. Furthermore,\nin dynamic environments (e.g., the restless bandit problem; Whittle, 1 988 ), reliance\non similar experiences is an effi cient heuristic (Biele, Erev, & Ert, 2 009 ). Below, we\nturn to the manner in which the process of contingent sampling can be modeled.\nSpatial Search Policies\nL ike any organism, humans can sample information in at least two very different\nways from payoff distributions (e.g., fl owers, ponds, other people, and gambles).\nFigure 8 .3 depicts two paradigmatic sequential-sampling strategies based on two\nassumed options. In piecewise sampling, the searcher oscillates between options,\neach time drawing, in the most extreme case, the smallest possible sample. In com-\nprehensive sampling, by contrast, the searcher samples extensively from one option\nand then turns to the other option to explore it thoroughly.\nT aking these two sampling strategies as a starting point, Hills and Hertwig ( 2010 )\nsuggested that this spatial way of sampling foreshadows how people make their\nfi nal decision. Specifi cally, they proposed that a person who samples piecewise will\ntend to make decisions as would a judge who scores each round of a boxing match:\nShe determines which option yields the better reward in each round of sampling and\nultimately picks the one that wins the most rounds. By contrast, a person using a\ncomprehensive-sampling strategy will tend to gauge the average reward for each 8 How Representations of Knowledge Shape Actions 135\nFig. 8.3 ( a) Representations of the sampling patterns associated with piecewise- and\ncomprehensive- sampling strategies. Piecewise strategies repeatedly alternate back and forth\nbetween options. Comprehensive-sampling strategies take one large sample from each option.\nFollowing the sample phase, the participants make a decision about which option they prefer. (b )\nRepresentations of the comparison strategies associated with roundwise and summary strategies\nfor a set of hypothetical outcomes. Roundwise strategies compare outcomes over repeated rounds\nand choose options that win the most rounds. Summary strategies compare fi nal values (here, the\noverall expected value) and choose options with the better fi nal value (Reprinted from Hills and\nHertwig (2 010 , p. 1788) with permission from Associations for Psychological Science)\noption and then choose the one promising the larger reward harvest. The reason for\nthis dependency of the decision strategies on search is that the piecewise- and\ncomprehensive- sampling strategy foster comparisons across different scales of\ninformation: rounds vs. summaries, respectively. Determining a winner who is\nahead in most rounds and determining the one yielding the largest expected reward 136 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\ncan lead to different choices even when both decisions-makers experience the same\ninformation. The reason is that the person using the former decision strategy weighs\neach round equally, ignores the magnitude of wins and losses, and thus acts as if it\nunderweights rare, but consequential, outcomes. That link between sampling strat-\negy and decision strategy is exactly what Hills and Hertwig (2 010 ) found. Individuals\nwho frequently oscillated between options were more likely to choose the round-\nwise winning options and to make choices as if they underweighted rare events than\nwere individuals who switched options rarely.\nI n summary, modern behavioral decision research has been strongly focused on\npeople\u2019s responses to descriptions of events. In recent years three experiential para-\ndigms have been used to study how experience affects risky choice. A consistent\npicture has emerged. When rare events are involved, description-based and\nexperience-b ased decisions can drastically diverge. We now turn to different ways\nof modeling decisions from experience.\nCognitive Strategies in Decisions from Experience\nIn attempting to capture the information search (learning) and decision-making pro-\ncesses in decisions from experience, researchers have proposed models that can be\ngrouped into three classes. The fi rst class\u2014neo-Bernoullian models\u2014rests on the\npremise that respondents form a mental representation of the relative frequency\n(probability) with which events occur in the process of sampling outcomes.\nCombined with outcome information, these probabilities then enter the evaluation\nof the two gambles\u2019 desirability. But do decisions from experience inevitably give\nrise to an explicit representation of probabilities? The second and the third class of\nmodels\u2014associative learning models and heuristics\u2014refl ect the assumption that\ndecision-makers can and will do without probabilities. In this section we discuss the\nthree classes of models.\nNeo-Bernoullian Models\nExpected utility theory postulates that one can, or should, model human choice by\nassuming that people behave as if they have multiplied some function of probability\nand value and then have maximized it. Applied to decisions from experience,\nexpected utility theory and related models require explicit representation of proba-\nbilities. An example is the \u201ctwo-stage model\u201d (Tversky & Fox, 1 995 , p. 279) of\ndecision under uncertainty, in which it is assumed that decision-makers fi rst esti-\nmate the probability p of an uncertain event A and then make a choice. The psycho-\nlogical impact of the event A with its associated (estimated) probability p is then\nmeasured in terms of cumulative prospect theory\u2019s probability weighting function \u03c0\n(Fox & Tversky, 1998 ). 8 How Representations of Knowledge Shape Actions 137\nAssociative Learning Models\nI n this class of theories, human choice is conceptualized as a learning process\n(Busemeyer & Myung, 1 992; Bush & Mosteller, 1 955) . Learning consists in chang-\ning the propensity to select a gamble according to the experienced outcomes. Good\nexperiences boost the propensity of choosing the gamble associated with them, and\nbad experiences diminish it (e.g., Barron & Erev, 2 003 ; Denrell, 2 007 ; Erev &\nBarron, 2 005; March, 1 996) . Two associative-learning models that have been pro-\nposed to capture decisions from experience are the value-updating model (Hertwig,\nBarron, Weber, & Erev, 2006) and the instance-based learning (IBL) model\n(Gonzalez & Dutt, 2 011 ).\nThe value-updating model stipulates that learners update their estimates of the\nvalue of the gamble after each new draw from it. Specifi cally, the model computes the\nweighted average of the previously estimated value and the value of the most recently\nexperienced outcome. The model includes two parameters, namely, the number of\ndraws and a recency parameter. The former parameter is determined empirically; the\nsecond is adjustable (i.e., fi tted to the data). Importantly, the model does not necessi-\ntate representation of probabilities. Furthermore, the best fi tting parameter in a model\ncompetition indeed suggested a substantial recency effect (Hau et al., 2 008 ).\nT he IBL model also stipulates a learning process but goes beyond the relatively\nsimple assumptions of the value-updating model: It is assumed that a choice (given\nthat it is not automatically reproduced) represents the selection of the option with\nthe higher utility (blended value). An option\u2019s blended value is a function of its\nassociated outcomes and the probability of retrieving corresponding instances from\nmemory (contingent sampling). Memory retrieval depends on memory activation,\nwhich, in turn, is a function of the recency and frequency of the experience.\nActivation is specifi ed by the mechanism originally proposed in Adaptive Control\nof Thought\u2014Rational (ACT-R; Anderson & Lebiere, 1 998) , a cognitive architec-\nture used by cognitive psychologists to model problem-solving, learning, and mem-\nory. The IBL model is particularly attractive because it \u201cpredicts not only the fi nal\nconsequential choice but also the sequence of sampling selection\u201d (Gonzalez &\nDutt, 2 011, p. 529; but see Hills & Hertwig, 2 012) and because it offers a single\nlearning mechanism (leading up to an instance\u2019s activation) across all experiential\ndesigns (Fig. 8 .1b\u2013d) . Indeed, in a quantitative comparison of models, Gonzalez\nand Dutt ( 2011 ) were able to show that the IBL model predicts fi nal experience-\nbased decisions as well as or better than any other proposed model (including, for\ninstance, the value-updating model and cumulative prospect theory).\nHeuristics\nA nother class of models designed to describe both the process and outcome of\nchoice are cognitive choice heuristics (see Brandst\u00e4tter, Gigerenzer, &\nHertwig,2 006 ). Heuristics can be separated into two classes: those that use solely 138 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\noutcome information and exclude probabilities (outcome heuristics), and those that\nuse at least rudimentary probability information (dual heuristics). Outcome heuris-\ntics such as maximax and minimax (Luce & Ra\u00efffa, 1 957 ; Savage, 1 954 ) were origi-\nnally proposed as models for decision-making under ignorance in which people\nhave no information whatsoever about probabilities.\nAnother cognitive heuristic that focuses on outcomes is the natural-mean heuris-\ntic (Hertwig & Pleskac, 2 008 ). It works in two steps:\nStep 1. Calculate the natural mean of outcomes for both gambles by summing, sepa-\nrately for each gamble, all n -experienced outcomes and then dividing by n .\nS tep 2. Choose the gamble with the larger natural mean (i.e., the gamble that had the\nbest average outcome in the sampling phase).\nThe natural-mean heuristic was originally proposed in the context of n -armed ban-\ndit problems (Sutton & Barto, 1 998) as a simple method for estimating the values of\nactions (e.g., the play of one of a slot machine\u2019s levers) and for using the estimates\nto select between actions: \u201cThe true value of an action is the mean reward received\nwhen the action is selected. One natural way to estimate this is by averaging the\nrewards actually received when the action was selected\u201d (p. 27). The natural-mean\nheuristic totes up all experienced rewards (or losses) per gamble and then divides\nthis sum by the sample size per gamble to arrive at the n atural mean . One interpreta-\ntion of the natural-mean heuristic is that in decisions from experience it is a simple\nand psychologically plausible instantiation of the expected-value calculus\u2014partic-\nularly in continuous outcome distributions. Indeed, the natural-mean heuristic was\nnot inferior to the more complex models described above and predicted a compa-\nrable number of correct predictions in decisions from experience (Hau et al., 2 008 ).\nIn light of these models that do not require explicit representations of probabili-\nties, we return to the question of what the possible codeterminants of the gap\nbetween description and experience are. The two associative-learning models and\nthe natural-mean heuristic are format dependent. That is, they cannot capture deci-\nsions from description, for the input into these models consists of a sequence of\noutcomes that get integrated into one summary measure. They have no conceptual\nparameters with which to take probability information into account, and, in fact,\nprobabilities are not directly apparent in decisions from experience. In decisions\nbased on description, however, probabilities are made explicit to decisions-makers.\nDifferences in description- and experience-based choices could therefore arise\npartly because different formats of mathematically equivalent information trigger\ndifferent cognitive strategies (see Gigerenzer & Hoffrage, 1 995, for a related argu-\nment in Bayesian reasoning). 8 How Representations of Knowledge Shape Actions 139\nDecisions from Experience: A Key to Otherwise Puzzling\nHuman Behavior\nT he most famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius occurred in 79 AD, destroying many\nneighboring towns, among them Pompeii, the luxurious resort of wealthy Romans\nand now the most renowned still life of volcanic doom. This eruption, however, was\nnot the most devastating one. As recent volcanological and archaeoanthropological\nstudies have revealed, an earlier, Bronze Age eruption (around 3780 BC) covered\nthe surrounding area as far as 25 km away, burying land and villages, causing a\nglobal climatic disturbance and the abandonment of the entire area for centuries.\nThe loss of life and property was less extensive in the Bronze Age cataclysm than in\nthe eruption of AD 79, but researchers recently discovered evidence of a mass exo-\ndus: a huge number of human and animal footprints pressed into the ash bed and all\nleading away from the volcano (Mastrolorenzo, Petrone, Pappalardo, &\nSheridan,2 006 ).\nA t present, at least three million people live within the area that was destroyed by\nthe Bronze Age eruption. In fact, the periphery of Mount Vesuvius, which includes\na signifi cant chunk of the Naples metropolitan area, is among the most populated of\nany active volcano (Bruni, 2 003 ). According to simulations by Mastrolorenzo et al.\n( 2006 ), an eruption comparable in magnitude to the Bronze Age eruption would\ncause total devastation and mortality within a radius of at least 12 km (7\u00bd miles). In\naddition, great quantities of fi ne ash in more distant zones might cause severe\nrespiratory-t ract injuries and fatalities due to acute asphyxia. Although it is impos-\nsible to predict the exact probability of such a catastrophe happening, volcanolo-\ngists such as Michael Sheridan have argued that roughly 2000 years have passed\nsince Pompeii\u2019s destruction and that \u201cwith each year, the statistical probability\nincreases that there will be another violent eruption\u201d of Vesuvius (Wilford, 2006 ).\nIn light of these dire forecasts, one might expect that local residents would be keen\nto move away from the danger zone. On the contrary, relocating residents has proven\nextremely diffi cult, despite considerable incentives offered by the regional authori-\nties. \u201cIn the shadow of Vesuvius, those residents have cultivated a remarkable opti-\nmism, a transcendent fatalism and a form of denial as deep as the earth\u2019s molten\ncore\u201d (Bruni, 2 003 , par. 12).\nH ow can one explain the willingness of residents to defy fate? Perhaps it has\nbecome clear by now why the distinction between description-based and experience-\nbased decisions may be key to understanding this and other puzzling risk-taking\nbehavior. Personal experience tells residents in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius that\nviolent eruptions are extremely rare; in fact, in most people\u2019s lifetime, they have\nbeen nonexistent. Unless catastrophes have occurred recently, the relative indiffer-\nence with which citizens and politicians often consider rare, but high-consequence,\nevents like bursting levies, catastrophic earthquakes, and eruptions of volcanoes 140 R. Hertwig and R. Frey\nmay be owed to the experience of their rarity (Weber, 2 012 ). Just as residents in the\nvicinity of Mount Vesuvius have ignored incentives to relocate, people living in\nfl ood plains who make decisions about insurance based on their personal experience\nwith fl oods\u2014a rare event\u2014have tended to turn down even federally subsidized\nfl ood insurance (Kunreuther, 1 984 ).\nA t the same time, experiencing a rare, but highly consequential, event in reality\ncan also have a lasting psychological impact. This possibility brings the discussion\nfull circle. Generations growing up in a period of low stock returns appear to take\nan unusually cautious approach to investing, even decades later. In other words,\nyoung people who experienced the dramatic economic slump of 2008\u20132009 may\nenter the stock and housing market much more cautiously than their parents did.\nConclusion\nModern behavioral decision research has commonly focused on decisions from\ndescription. The observations stemming from this research suggest that humans\noverestimate and overweight rare events. Recent research on risky choice that takes\ninto account the role of experience has found that people behave as if rare events are\naccorded less weight than they deserve relative to their objective probabilities. These\nobservations are not contradictory; they describe how the mind functions in two dif-\nferent informational environments. In other words, research on description-b ased\nbehavior and research on experience-based behavior should not be played against\neach other\u2014their contrast is enlightening. However, to improve the understanding of\nhow people make decisions with incomplete and uncertain information \u201cin the wild\u201d\nand how people respond to events that are rare but highly consequential, it is neces-\nsary to study the psychology and rationality of people\u2019s decisions from experience.\nAcknowledgments This text is based largely on Hertwig and Erev (2 009 ) and Hertwig (2 012 ).\nWe thank Elsevier, Sage, and Springer for granting the permission rights, and the Swiss National\nScience Foundation for a grant to the fi rst author (100014\u2013126558).\nReferences\nA kerlof, G.

Chapter 9\nRefl ection and Impulse as Determinants\nof Human Behavior\nAnand Krishna and Fritz Strack\nThe Missing Link Between Knowledge and Action\nThe experience of being and acting human is a universal theme of cultural expres-\nsion. From movies to great literary works, great weight is placed on both of these\naspects, being and acting. Literary fi gures that resonate in our minds do so both\nbecause of their heroic (or antiheroic) actions and their inner life\u2014their motiva-\ntions, feelings, and thoughts on their own existence and actions. Sometimes this\ninner life refl ects a clever, refl ective type of thinking, as with the Danaans in Homer\u2019s\nIliad and their plan to defeat the Trojans by infi ltrating the city in a wooden horse.\nBut equally fascinating are the stories of protagonists who show an impetuous,\nimpulsive side, such as Icarus, the Greek youth who fl ew too close to the sun and\nthereby melted his artifi cial wings despite his father\u2019s specifi c warning. Lastly, there\nare those fi gures who are faced with an inner confl ict between refl ection and\nimpulse\u2014Odysseus, for all his cleverness, cannot resist the temptation to hear the\ndeadly song of the Sirens, yet his forethought in having himself tied to the mast of\nhis ship defeats the impulse to drown himself trying to reach them.\nThese three Greek legends appear to show different ways of thinking that lead to\ndifferent results. Coming up with complex plans such as the Trojan Horse requires\nrefl ection and active use of knowledge, whereas such deliberation would seem anti-\nthetical to Icarus\u2019 fl ight. However, these two different modes of thought do seem to\ncome together in a fashion, as is in Odysseus\u2019 use of forward planning to defeat the\nconsequences of his impulsive decision. In everyday life, as well, people often\napproach situations in these two ways\u2014spending a while considering what to eat\nfor lunch and making a deliberate selection but also automatically grabbing a sweet\ndessert without thinking about it at all. When considering how these mental\nA. Krishna (*) \u2022 F.

Strack\nprocesses work, it makes sense to look at the two styles of thinking separately to\ngain an understanding of their interaction and of their actual effect on behavior.\nI n this chapter we seek to illuminate the characteristics of these two processes,\nshow their interactions with each another, and point out their common effect on\nbehavior. To do so, it is fi rst necessary to evaluate each system independently, exam-\nining historical and current perspectives on refl ective and impulsive styles of\nthought. Thereafter, we present an integrative model of thinking and action in an\nendeavor to identify when which system of thought will be active and under what\ncircumstances it will infl uence behavior.\nA Short Overview of Refl ective and Impulsive Styles\nof Thinking\nTheories of Refl ection\nThe idea that human behavior is based on active, refl ective thought guided by the\nprinciple of attaining benefi cial things is old and makes intuitive sense. It is diffi cult\nto argue why people would actively decide to act in a fashion that they know is bad\nfor them without some belief that the action would ultimately be positive. In this\nconception of human thought, negative outcomes can be explained by a lack of\ninformation. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, proposed that people\nwould otherwise act in ways that were good for them.\nF rom a social psychological perspective, this kind of thinking is exemplifi ed in\nexpectancy-value theories and the concept of h omo oeconomicus (e.g., Fishbein &\nAjzen, 1 975 ). The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1 985 ) is an established exam-\nple of an expectancy-value model (Conner & Armitage, 1 998) . It depicts behavior\nas a function of several specifi c mental factors. In this conceptualization the three\ndeterminants of behavior are the attitude toward the behavior, the subjective norm\nrelevant to the behavior, and the perceived behavioral control over the behavior. An\nattitude toward a specifi c behavior is generated by multiplying the evaluation of a\npossible perceived outcome of the behavior (a value) by the perceived likelihood of\nthat outcome (an expectancy) and then summing the results of this multiplication\nfor all possible outcomes. Similarly, the subjective norm is calculated by multiply-\ning the actor\u2019s motivation to comply with another person\u2019s expectation by the per-\nceived likelihood that that person holds that expectation over all persons. By\ncontrast, perceived behavioral control is a function of the perceived power of\nbehavior-i nhibiting or behavior-facilitating factors multiplied by the likelihood that\nthe actor has access to these factors.\nThe assumption in the theory of planned behavior is, therefore, that a human\nactor\u2019s calculation of these three determinants of behavior is optimally based on all\navailable information. Once the determinants are established, the actor will integrate 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 147\nthem for all possible behaviors and select the best option. This behavior is then initi-\nated via a behavioral intention.\nT his idea is echoed in various domains, both historically and in more modern\ncontexts, such as organizational psychology (Vroom, 1 964 ), addiction research\n(Sutton, Marsh, & Matheson, 1 987 ), and education (Wigfi eld & Eccles, 2 000 ).\nThere is solid empirical support for the ability of expectancy-value models to pre-\ndict intentions and behavior (e.g., Armitage & Conner, 2001) . However, even the\nstrongest empirical studies do not conclude that this kind of thinking can com-\npletely predict behavior. In particular, it seems unlikely that behavior occurring\nwithout conscious thought could be dependent on this kind of deliberative, inten-\ntional processing (e.g., Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1 978 ). Therefore, one must\nconsider alternative mental processes that are characterized by less deliberative\nprocessing.\nTheories of Impulse\nExpectancy-value models can describe the careful planning behind the Trojan horse\nwell, but they seem less able to explain why Icarus would immolate his wings. The\nkind of action implied in the latter myth is apparently not infl uenced by the knowl-\nedge of the action\u2019s expected consequences. It may rather be seen as reckless, as\nbased on an impulse that seems to instigate behavior automatically. This determi-\nnant of behavior differs from the rational assumptions of Socrates or the theory of\nplanned behavior (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1 975 ) and must be explained by other means.\nHistorically, this point is recognized by Aristotle in the N icomanchean Ethics\n(Crisp, 2 000 ) when he argues that people may at times act against their judgment.\nIn his view an overwhelming passion\u2014physical feelings (e.g., hunger) and emo-\ntions (e.g., fear or pleasure)\u2014directly implies a practical conclusion to act on it.\nThis practical conclusion may at times overpower the conclusions reached by\nreason.\nP sychology as a discipline has focused mostly on factors that affect the ability of\nreasoned conclusions to control passionate ones (Hofmann, Friese, & Strack, 2 009 ).\nFor example, children\u2019s ability to forgo a small, immediate reward in favor of a\nlarger, delayed reward has been shown to depend on various factors, including\nopportunity to pay attention to the immediate reward and thinking happy or sad\nthoughts (Mischel, Ebbesen, & Raskoff, 1 972) . Muraven and Baumeister (2 000 )\nconceptualize the control of impulses as being achieved by a metaphorical \u201cmuscle\u201d\nthat is powered by limited resources and is subject to fatigue, a state called e go\ndepletion . In this view, reasoned control of impulses will fail if remaining resources\nof self-control are insuffi cient to overcome impulse strength. Personality variables\nhave been linked to the ability to control impulses (e.g., Block & Block, 1980 ;\nCarver, 2005 ), as have physiological variables such as blood glucose and alcohol\nlevels (Bushman & Cooper, 1 990; Gailliot et al., 2 007) and situational factors such\nas the availability of tempting stimuli (Schachter, 1 971 ). 148 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nAnother approach to impulses and their effect on behavior is provided by research\non implicit attitudes. Implicit attitudes are seen as spontaneous, automatic affective\nand behavioral responses to attitude objects (Greenwald & Banaji, 1 995) . The view\nthat impulsive behavior comes from overwhelming passion caused by a situation\nmaps well onto this idea that attitude objects may spontaneously cause affect and\nbehavior via automatic processes. This view contrasts with the position that atti-\ntudes are evaluations of target objects (e.g., Eagly & Chaiken, 1 993 ). The evaluative\nposition implies a more deliberative assessment of object properties, which corre-\nsponds to processes similar to those described in the theory of reasoned action\n(Fishbein & Ajzen, 1 975 ). Researchers studying implicit attitudes generally adopt\nindirect attitude measures such as the affective priming paradigm (Fazio,\nSanbonmatsu, Powell, & Kardes, 1 986 ) or the implicit association test (IAT)\n(Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1 998 ). These instruments typically use a com-\nbination of valent and categorical stimuli and measure their inhibition or facilitation\nof a target behavior. Affective priming studies show that people categorize evalua-\ntive adjectives such as g ood or bad faster when they are congruent in valence to an\nattitude object shown immediately beforehand (Fazio, 2 001 ). The IAT measures the\ndifference between reaction times when participants are asked to categorize an\nobject by attitudinal categories via a key-press reaction also associated with a par-\nticular valence (Greenwald et al., 1 998 ). These measures show that behavioral\nresponses to specifi c stimuli are infl uenced by the valence of these stimuli. The dif-\nference between what these implicit measures capture and what traditional evalua-\ntive measures (e.g., self-report questions) assess is apparent from their only moderate\ncorrelations (Fazio & Olson, 2 003 ) and by the relative robustness of implicit mea-\nsures with regard to participants\u2019 conscious control (Banse, Seise, & Zerbes, 2001 ;\nKim, 2003; but see Mierke & Klauer, 2 001, and Fiedler & Bluemke, 2 005, for criti-\ncal discussions). One explains these results by stating that the spontaneous response\nto an attitudinal object is governed by associations that may differ in content from\nthe results of a deliberative evaluation. These associations occur between perceived\nobjects, behavior, and affect. The link between impulse and behavior has some theo-\nretical basis\u2014including the ideomotor principle (James, 1890 ) and the perception-\nbehavior link (Bargh, 1997) \u2014as does a direct link between perception and affective\nresponse (Zajonc, 1 980 ). However, research on implicit attitudes has not succeeded\nin explaining what an implicit attitude actually is, beyond the tautological func-\ntional defi nition that an implicit attitude is what is measured by indirect measures\n(Strack & Deutsch, 2 007) . With evidence accruing that implicit attitudes may be\nstrongly affected by the context (Wittenbrink, Judd, & Park, 2 001 ) and type (Bosson,\nSwann, & Pennebaker, 2000) of the measurement, the question of what exactly an\nimpulse might be is becoming ever more relevant. 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 149\nBridging the Gap: The Refl ective-Impulsive Model\nT he research and models presented so far shed some light on the mysteries of human\nbehavior. The careful plan behind the Trojan Horse seems rooted in deliberative,\nexpectancy-value thinking, whereas Icarus\u2019 doomed fl ight into the sun might be\nseen as a lack of self-regulatory resources preventing him from automatically fl ying\nclose to the bright sun. What has yet to be addressed is the question of the interac-\ntion of these systems\u2014how does Odysseus defeat the Siren\u2019s call, or in more gen-\neral terms, how do deliberative, rational thought and impulsive affect and action\ninteract? In the past three decades many researchers have attempted to address this\nquestion. In the realm of social psychology, the challenge has been met with many\ndifferent dual-process models (see Chaiken & Trope, 1 999, for examples). These\ndual-process models stem from research on different topics, including persuasion\n(Chaiken, 1 987; Petty & Cacioppo, 1 986) , stereotyping (Devine, 1 989) , causal attri-\nbution (Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1 988) , and general cognition (Epstein, Lipson,\nHolstein, & Huh, 1992 ). Although these models deal with different aspects of\nhuman behavior and cognition, they share certain structural traits. In all cases, two\nmodes of information processing are proposed, one of which is characterized by\neffortful, rule-based processing, the other by almost effortless, associative process-\ning. This distinction is delineated clearly by Sloman (1 996 ), who describes both of\nthese modes in detail.\nMany infl uential dual-process models conform to this structure, but not all mod-\nels provide for interactions between the proposed processes (for an overview, see\nSmith & DeCoster, 2000 ). Even fewer models make statements about how both\nprocesses infl uence behavior and whether they are interdependent in doing so.\nRather, they specify how information is processed at a cognitive level\u2014they\ndescribe how people think about what to eat for lunch and how they process the\ninformation that sweet desserts are available, but these models do not go beyond the\nformation of a behavioral decision on what would be best to eat. They also cannot\ndescribe how behavior can be instigated independently from a decision (e.g., Strack\n& Neumann, 1996 )\u2014how it can be that one decides to eat a healthy lunch but still\nreach out for the sweet muffi n. In order to address these issues and fi ll the gap\nbetween knowledge and action, an integrative model that incorporates both ele-\nments is needed. For this purpose, Strack and Deutsch (2 004) propose the refl ective-\nimpulsive model (RIM), a dual-systems model conceived to clearly defi ne and\nintegrate the theoretical perspectives so far presented under the headings of impul-\nsive and refl ective. 150 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nThe Refl ective System\nT he RIM refers to the rational, rule-based system of thought as the refl ective sys-\ntem. Slow and driven by resources of working memory, this system has limits on its\ncapacity for information processing. It may be disengaged from processing under\ncertain circumstances, but it is capable of generating knowledge via syllogistic\ninferences. It does so by activating concepts and possible relations between these\nconcepts and then assigning a truth value to the proposition formed by the concepts\nand the relation. For example, the concepts s alad and health may be activated, along\nwith the relation of i s/is not . In this case the refl ective system would assign the value\nof t rue to the confi guration, yielding the proposition s alad is healthy. If the concept\nof m uffi n was activated instead of s alad , the truth value might instead be f alse , yield-\ning the proposition muffi n is not healthy .\nIt is important to note that any other relation might be used beyond is/is not , such\nas implies/does not imply , causes/does not cause , or i s/is not a member of , to name\na few. If several related propositions are constructed, new knowledge may be gener-\nated by the combination of these propositions. In keeping with the example proposi-\ntions given above\u2014s alad is healthy and m uffi n is not healthy \u2014an additional\nproposition of being healthy is good might yield both the conclusion that salad is\ngood and that muffi ns are not. Because the refl ective system is able to assign truth\nvalues to statements, rule-based inferences can be drawn in order to maximize the\nconsistency of the resulting representation (Gawronski & Strack, 2 004 ). The ability\nof this mode of processing to help a person generate and infer conclusions makes it\nextremely fl exible and useful for facilitating many operations typically associated\nwith deliberative thought, including expectancy-value judgments and advanced\nsocial behavior (e.g., the discernment of people\u2019s states of belief; see Wimmer &\nPerner, 1 983 , for example) and the learning of new connections between concepts\nwithout much or any repetition.\nThe refl ective system is limited by boundary conditions that constrain its ability\nto process information. Two of the most important of these conditions are working\nmemory capacity and arousal. The activation of concepts and relations and the\ntransformation of the resulting propositions are assumed to take place in the work-\ning memory (Baddeley, 1986 ). These dynamics provide a functional limit to the\ncomplexity and scope of refl ective operations, in that the capacity of working mem-\nory may be insuffi cient to contain all the required propositions for a given operation\nconcurrently. This statement is bolstered by studies showing that an impairment of\nworking-memory capacity through a manipulation of cognitive load impairs logical\nreasoning (De Neys, 2 006; DeWall, Baumeister, & Masicampo, 2 008) . Arousal, by\ncontrast, affects refl ective processing in a nonlinear fashion resembling the Yerkes-\nDodson Law (Yerkes & Dodson, 1 908 )\u2014intermediate levels of arousal facilitate the\noperation of the refl ective system. Evidence exists that high levels of arousal reduce\ncomplexity in social judgments (Baron, 2 000; Lambert et al., 2 003; Paulhus & Lim,\n1 994 ), whereas low arousal, characteristic in a state of fatigue, for example, is also\nassociated with lowered capacity to engage in refl ective processing. 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 151\nImportant and ubiquitous cognitive phenomena rely upon the refl ective system\u2019s\nability to assign truth values to relations between concepts, an example of which is\nnegation. The RIM predicts that negations of propositions can be processed only\nunder circumstances in which the refl ective system can be engaged, that is, under\nconditions endowed with resources suffi cient for efforts to engage in processing.\nThis statement differs from models based on the assumption that negations may be\n\u201ctagged\u201d onto propositions once and for all and henceforth no longer require refl ec-\ntive engagement (e.g., Gilbert, 1 991 ), and it is supported by evidence that negations\nrequire cognitive resources to process (Wason, 1 959 ).\nRefl ective processing is accompanied by a state of noetic awareness of whether\nsomething is the case or not. This awareness may sometimes be accompanied by a\nparticular feeling that is processed consciously, a state of experiential awareness. It\nshould be noted, however, that some operations in the refl ective system may require\nso few resources that they can be processed without corresponding noetic awareness\nor a feeling of intentionality (Deutsch, Kordts-Freudinger, Gawronski, & Strack,\n2009 ).\nThe Impulsive System\nAside from the refl ective system, the RIM proposes the existence of an associative\nsystem of thought called the impulsive system. This system works continuously and\neffortlessly. Whereas the refl ective system uses working memory capacity, the\nimpulsive system can be seen as long-term memory and therefore has functionally\nunlimited capacity. The impulsive system forms associative links between individ-\nual elements that may be of varying strengths. When an element is activated, other\nelements linked to it are activated in accordance with the strength of the links to the\noriginal element, a form of spreading activation. Recent or frequent activation of an\nelement also increases both the accessibility of that element and the likelihood of its\ncontinued processing if further activation occurs. Links between elements are based\non the principles of contiguity and similarity, so that stimuli that occur a short time\nor distance from one another are more likely to become linked or to have existing\nlinks strengthened than is the case with temporally or spatially nonproximal stimuli.\nIt is important to note that refl ective processes activate corresponding patterns of\nimpulsive elements, meaning that even elements that are never perceived together in\nthe world may become associatively linked if they are often refl ectively processed\ntogether. The activation of impulsive elements may be accompanied by an experien-\ntial state of awareness, with people experiencing a specifi c feeling without being\nable to say where it comes from. Such feelings are themselves elements in the\nimpulsive system and may therefore be connected to other elements with varying\nlink strengths.\nT his process of association is slow and enduring but also rigid. Although propo-\nsitional processing in the refl ective system may create associative links between\nconcepts in the impulsive system, it is not necessarily the case that propositional 152 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nprocessing can become completely automatic and effortless with enough practice\n(Deutsch et al., 2 009 ). Instead, specifi c patterns of thought may become easier but\nlose or change their meaning under circumstances where refl ective processing is\nhindered. As an example, African Americans who feel that whites perceive them\nnegatively may often refl ectively think \u201cBlacks are not bad\u201d as a response; in the\nimpulsive system, however, the concepts of b lack and bad are being activated at the\nsame time and thereby linked (Livingston, 2 002 ). This simultaneity may counterin-\ntuitively lead African Americans to have additional negative feelings and associa-\ntions with their in-group when they have no refl ective resources with which to\nnegate the associative relation. However, the rigidity of associative processing is\nsomewhat alleviated by the effects of motivational orientation. When people are in\nan approach orientation, they are prepared to reduce the distance between them-\nselves and some aspect of their environments, whereas an avoidance orientation is\npreparedness to increase this distance. These fundamental orientations can facilitate\nassociative activation when this activation is compatible (e.g., approach orientation\nmay facilitate the activation of positively valent elements). Therefore, the sight of a\nmuffi n might elicit the positive associations of tasty , s weet, and good more strongly\nwhen one is in an approach orientation, as when selecting what salad one would\nprefer for lunch, than when one is not. If one is currently in an avoidance orienta-\ntion, having just read a brochure on calorie content and having selected the salad\nthat would be least fattening, these associations might be weaker even before the\nactivation of the refl ective system. However, it is clear that the associative system\nalone, although it requires no resources and works very quickly, is generally far less\nfl exible and adaptive than the refl ective system.\nInteraction of Systems\nNow that we have described the basic operating principles of the RIM\u2019s two sys-\ntems, it is necessary to show how they function together. The very structures of the\ntwo systems contain a fi rst important point relevant to their interaction: the impul-\nsive system is always effortlessly active, whereas the refl ective system may also be\ninactive. The implication is that the refl ective system, when it does operate, does so\nin parallel with the impulsive system, not in place of it. That is, refl ective processing\nalways occurs with parallel impulsive processing. It is also clear that the concepts\nthat are transformed in working-memory space in the refl ective system do not come\nfrom nowhere but from the long-term store of the impulsive system.\nAs the systems cannot interact when the refl ective system is disengaged, it is\nadequate to examine how they interact from the beginning to the end of a refl ective\noperation. When a refl ective operation begins, perceptual input will already have\nactivated several associative elements. For example, when thinking about what to\nhave for lunch, a person may already have seen what is on offer in the cafeteria, a\nselection that will activate whatever associations that person has with the given meal\noptions, but other perceptual data in the attentional focus (the presentation of the 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 153\nfood, the attractiveness of the serving staff, and any number of other concepts) will\nalso activate associations of their own. Some of these associations will achieve suf-\nfi cient activation to attain awareness, so a particularly delicious-looking muffi n\nmight prompt an automatic expectation of a good taste. The refl ective system then\ncategorizes and relates the activated concepts, the result being that the muffi n is\nrecognized as tasting good, and activates additional relevant content in the impul-\nsive system\u2014such as health. This concept, in turn, changes the activation pattern in\nthe impulsive system, so the associated concept of s alad might become activated as\nwell. This activation pattern is again categorized, and the process repeats until a\ndecision or inference is reached. Such end results in the refl ective system are driven\nby the principle of consistency of the propositions generated. For example h ealth is\ngood , taste is good , health is more important than taste might lead to the decision\nto select the healthy salad rather than the unhealthy one but also the tasty muffi n, for\nthis choice would be consistent with a greater number of propositions. However, the\ncontent of the propositions generated is necessarily limited by the activation pattern\nof the impulsive system\u2014although tennis is also healthy, its activation potential in\nthe environment of the cafeteria during lunch hour is very low, so the refl ective\nsystem will not include it in processing without any prior link or further relevant\nperceptual stimuli.\nSynergy between the systems occurs when the impulsive system\u2019s associations\nare valid and relevant to a consistent refl ective solution. When the impulsive activa-\ntion pattern is in synergy with refl ective processing, concepts relevant to the focus\nof refl ective processing become comparatively accessible, and cognitive effort is\ntherefore reduced. The refl ective system is not forced to perform extra categoriza-\ntions and activations of concepts to achieve consistency, so subjective effort is less-\nened. This reduction may be accompanied by a feeling of fl ow (Winkielman, Huber,\nKavanagh, & Schwarz, 2 012 ), that is, ease of processing, which is then linked to\npositive affect. Therefore, when both systems are in accord, it feels easy and good\nto think and make decisions. As an example, if the only tasty option in the cafeteria\nwere the healthy salad, people who ate there and cared deeply about their health\n(i.e., had a high accessibility of the concept health) would fi nd it natural to choose\nthe salad and, moreover, would feel good about how easy the choice was. A differ-\nent picture emerges when the systems are at odds with each other, as when impul-\nsive activation patterns present associations that are opposed to a consistent refl ective\nconclusion and produce a feeling of confl ict. It requires additional cognitive effort\nto activate new impulsive patterns and to form propositions that lead to a consistent\nend state. Once the muffi n is added to the lunch options, the decision-maker must\nactively work against the temptation of the tasty dessert in order to generate the\npropositions about healthy eating that justify selecting the salad. This dependence\nof effortful processing on automatic activation has an interesting consequence: A\nfl uently (synergistically) processed inference should have a higher truth value than\na disfl uently (antagonistically) processed inference does, unless the refl ective sys-\ntem specifi cally corrects for the consequences of fl uency (Allport & Lepkin, 1 945 ;\nBegg, Anas, & Farinacci, 1 992 ; Schwarz, Sanna, Skurnik, & Yoon, 2 007 ). The 154 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nfl uency of processing should affect both how sure a person is of a syllogistic infer-\nence and how securely she or he stands behind a given decision.\nCommon Pathway to Behavior\nH aving described how the refl ective and impulsive systems are structured and how\nthey interact during the process of thought, we now turn to two issues that many\nother dual-process models have not yet addressed: how these mental processes are\nlinked to behavior and especially how they interact when causing behavior. The\nRIM seeks to provide an answer to this central question through the component of\nbehavioral schemata. In a general sense, behavioral schemata are clusters of ele-\nments in the impulsive system. They consist of specifi c motor representations of\nbehavior, the perceptual input of typical context factors for the behavior, and the\nconsequences of those factors. As elements of the impulsive system, specifi c behav-\nioral schemata (e.g., how to grip a fork) will likely be associated with other behav-\nioral schemata that are relevant to the context, the specifi c motor activation, or the\nconsequences of the behavior. This result leads to the conclusion that several spe-\ncifi c, concrete behavioral schemata might form clusters that, in turn, can be seen as\nbehavioral schemata of greater abstractness. Gripping a fork and gripping a spoon,\nfor instance, are similar in terms of expected consequences (tasting food) and con-\ntext (involving food, eating utensils, etc.). The more abstract behavioral schema in\nthis case might be termed holding cutlery , which might, in turn, connect to other\nschemata to form a cluster of e ating politely, and so on. This conceptual hierarchy\nbears some relationship to other conceptualizations of schemata but is more specifi c\nthan its typical use (for a discussion see Fiske & Linville, 1 980 ; Lodge, McGraw,\nConover, Feldman, & Miller, 1 991 ).\nIf behavioral schemata are situated in the impulsive system, they are also subject\nto spreading activation. In a way similar to that of nonbehavioral elements in the\nimpulsive system, behavioral schemata can be activated automatically if enough\nother elements with suffi ciently strong links to the schema are activated. In the case\nof behavioral schemata, activation includes performance of the motor program\nembedded within the schema. The refl ective system, on the other hand, activates\nbehavioral schemata by propositionally connecting the self to the required behav-\nioral schema by means of a behavioral decision. If the decision refers to a behavior\nthat is to take place in future, the refl ective system additionally links the behavior\u2019s\nexpected relevant context with the cluster, creating an intention (Gollwitzer, 1 999 ).\nAlthough the systems encompass different precursors to behavior, they use the same\nfi nal gateway to enact behavior, namely, the activation of behavioral schemata, ele-\nments of the impulsive system. The implication is that the same principles of system\ninteraction that apply to purely mental operations in the RIM also apply to behav-\nioral processes\u2014fl uent, synergistic processing of behavioral decisions leads to\nbehavior that is performed more smoothly and easily than disfl uent, antagonistic\nprocessing. In extreme cases of the latter, the impulsive activation of behavioral 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 155\nschemata might be so strong that a refl ective behavioral decision will not lead\ndirectly to behavior, as when one knows that eating the dessert is wrong and has\ndecided not to, but the eyes and hands still seem to have their own volition to fi xate\non the forbidden. In this case the operating conditions of the systems will decide\nwhich behavior is performed. In states inimical to refl ective processing, such as\nhigh arousal or reduced working memory capacity, the impulse to act will likely win\nout, whereas an unhindered refl ective system might redirect the activation pattern in\nthe impulsive system by, for example, diverting attention or actively linking nega-\ntive consequences or attributes to the impulsive behavior. In this sense, there is little\ndifference between mentally grappling with an unwanted impulsive idea, such as\nunwanted racist thoughts, and with an unwanted physical impulse, such as reaching\nfor that tempting muffi n.\nKnowledge and Action: Bidirectional Connections\nH aving established that behavioral schemata are situated in the impulsive system,\nwe note that an important additional implication of the RIM becomes clear. In the\nimpulsive system, each element adheres to the mechanism of spreading activation,\nincluding behavioral schemata. Because behavioral schemata are linked to conse-\nquences and contextual stimuli, activating the behavior also activates related con-\ncepts. Therefore, behavior can directly infl uence cognition, both by creating and\nmodifying associative links and by infl uencing what concepts are likely to become\nactive in the refl ective system. For example, the act of reaching for the muffi n, if\nrepeated often, may eventually become suffi ciently associated with the sight of the\nmuffi n that the action is triggered by the sight. Similarly, this association makes the\nmuffi n more likely to come to mind when one is reaching for the salad, that is, when\nperforming the very motor program associated with the muffi n. This bidirectional-\nity of infl uence\u2014behavior to cognition as well as cognition to behavior\u2014also holds\nfor motivational orientation in that behaviors associated with approach will activate\nan approach orientation, whereas avoidance behavior has the opposite effect.\nThis link between behavior and cognition is not a new idea in principle. A similar\neffect is assumed in several infl uential theories, such as cognitive dissonance theory\n(Festinger, 1 957 ) and self-perception theory (Bem, 1 967 ). They also predict a\nchange in attitudes as a specifi c form of cognition that is based on behavior, albeit\nvia different mechanisms. The important difference lies in precisely these mecha-\nnisms. According to cognitive dissonance theory, a behavior that runs counter to an\nexisting belief about the self causes an aversive motivational state that may be alle-\nviated by changing existing beliefs or adding new ones, whereas the assumption in\nself-perception theory is that people infer their attitudes toward particular objects\nfrom their own behavior toward those objects. Both of these proposed mechanisms\nrequire propositional processing because they depend on a categorization of the\nbehavior in question. The RIM, on the other hand, describes a direct link between\nbehavior and cognition via the associative links between behavioral schemata and 156 A. Krishna and F. Strack\ncontiguously activated concepts in the impulsive system. It is not that cognitive dis-\nsonance and self-perception theory lack validity but rather that their path from\nbehavior to cognitive change is not the only possible one.\nW hen this perspective on the connection between behavior and implicit associa-\ntive links is applied to the fi eld of implicit attitudes, several interesting implications\narise. From the perspective of the RIM, implicit attitudes measured by the IAT,\naffective priming, and other procedures based on reaction time refl ect the strength\nof associative links between a target and a valence by means of a behavior associ-\nated with that valence.1 In view of the attributes of the impulsive system, it follows\nthat negated targets or valences should, under certain circumstances, have the same\neffect on reaction times as nonnegated ones do. Evidence supporting this logic\ncomes from the Bona Fide Pipeline task (Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams,\n1995) , which was used in a study by Deutsch, Gawronski, and Strack ( 2006 ), who\nshowed that positive prime words facilitated categorization of positive targets even\nwhen the prime was negated, whereas both negated and nonnegated negative prime\nwords facilitated categorization of negative target. Although this effect is not uni-\nversal (Deutsch et al., 2 009 ), it provides evidence that impulsive associations are\nwhat implicit attitude procedures measure. Procedures used to change implicit atti-\ntudes, such as automatic stereotype reduction training (Kawakami, Dovidio, Moll,\nHermsen, & Russin, 2 000 ), can also benefi t from the implications of the RIM\u2019s\nstructure. In the original automatic stereotype reduction training, participants were\ninduced to respond to stereotype-congruent pairings with a NO key and to stereotype-\nincongruent pairings with a YES key. Although this method was effective in reduc-\ning automatic stereotype activation, a study using only stereotype-incongruent\npairings has shown the procedure to work (Gawronski, Deutsch, Mbirkou, Seibt, &\nStrack, 2 008 ). The same studies also showed that negation of stereotype-congruent\npairings alone actually increased implicit stereotyping, a prediction derived from\nthe contrast between the propositional nature of negation and the associative nature\nof contiguous stimuli pairs.\nThe bidirectional link between behavior and cognition in the RIM also makes that\nmodel a valuable framework for studies that deal with embodied effects on cognition.\nThe basic idea of embodiment research is that cognition is always founded in mecha-\nnisms of sensory processing and motor control (e.g., Wilson, 2002) . The role of percep-\ntual information and motor-processing in the impulsive system and the infl uence\nthereby exerted on the refl ective system mirror this basic assumption. Precursor\nresearch to the current wave of embodiment movement, such as the pen study by\nStrack, Martin, and Stepper ( 1988) and the headphone study by F\u00f6rster and Strack\n(1 996) , have already been discussed from the perspective of the RIM (Strack &\nDeutsch, 2 004 ), but newer investigations into embodied processes might also be inte-\ngrated into this model. For example, Zhong and Lijenquist (2 006 ) show that washing\nhands reduced the effects of guilt on compensatory prosocial behavior. The authors\nexplain the effect in terms of symbolic self-completion (Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1 981 ),\n1 T he IAT is also capable of measuring associations other than valence, but because the argument\nis analogous to valence associations, it is omitted here. 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 157\nbut an alternative explanation offered by the RIM would be that the metaphorical asso-\nciation of purity with cleanliness might confl ict with a negative activation of the self in\nthe context of guilt and thereby alleviate the guilt\u2019s effects on behavior. Thus, an impe-\ntus is given for further inquiries into the precise mechanism behind embodiment effects.\nDeterminants of Systematic Behavioral Control\nHaving established the parameters and attributes of the two systems of the RIM and\ntheir parallel effects on behavior, we turn to explaining possible determinants of\neither system\u2019s dominance over the other in having these effects. If it is possible to\nidentify variables that can affect which system determines behavior, one can vastly\nimprove the predictive power of the RIM for behavior. Because the impulsive sys-\ntem is always active and processing, this question can be rephrased: Under what\ncircumstances will the refl ective system assert behavioral control when in confl ict\nwith the impulsive system?\nMotivation and Opportunity\nFazio (1 990) describes two modes of thinking\u2014a spontaneous processing mode\nbased on attitude accessibility, and a deliberative processing mode based on attitude\nbehavior. These modes of thinking are remarkably similar in structure to the RIM\u2019s\nproposed systems, certain differences in mechanisms notwithstanding. Therefore,\nthe MODE model (Fazio, 1990) , which predicts when the deliberative mode will be\nengaged in processing the possible consequences of behavior, may be applicable to\nthe RIM as well. In this conceptualization, engagement in deliberative processing\ndepends on motivation and opportunity. Motivation in the MODE model is generated\nby the fear of invalidity (Kruglanski & Freund, 1 983) , a function of the perceived\ncostliness of a judgmental mistake to the self, whereas opportunity is a function of\nthe available time and resources for processing. Applying this framework to the RIM,\none fi nds that the defi ned properties of the refl ective system are in accord with these\npredictions. Refl ective processing is accompanied by a feeling of subjective effort\nand so requires motivation, whereas both the reliance on the resources of working\nmemory and the relatively slow speed of the refl ective system make it clear that the\nrefl ective system can infl uence behavior only if the opportunity is given.\nEvidence for this dependence on opportunity exists in many domains. Cognitive\nload, a manipulation often used to impair deliberative processing, has been applied\nin various different studies whose results can be explained with the RIM. Self-\ncontrol (e.g., Lattimore & Maxwell, 2 004 ; Wegner, Erber, & Zanakos, 1 993 ), pro-\ncessing of negated stimuli (Deutsch et al. 2 009) , social judgments and attributions\n(Gilbert et al., 1 988 ; Krull & Erickson, 1 995 ; Trope & Alfi eri, 1 997 ), moral\njudgments (Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2 008 ), and general\nreasoning (De Neys, 2 006 ) have all proven to be impaired by cognitive load in ways 158 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nthat are consistent with the RIM\u2019s predictions. The idea that working memory\nresources may also play a role in refl ective processing has been tested in several\nstudies, both by comparing individuals with dispositionally high or low working\nmemory capacities (Hofmann, Gschwendner, Friese, Wiers, & Schmitt, 2008 ;\nThush et al., 2008 ) and by specifi cally taxing resources of working memory\n(Deutsch et al., 2 009 ). The conceptualization of working memory as \u201ca domain-free\nlimitation in ability to control attention\u201d (Engle, 2002, p. 19) points to the conclu-\nsion that the effects of attentional cognitive load manipulations on refl ective pro-\ncessing may be mediated by working memory capacity.\nSelf-Regulatory Resources\nVohs ( 2006) argues that the RIM\u2019s refl ective system is, in fact, powered by self-\nregulatory resources (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1 998 ). This\naccount is based on the similarity between the idea of such resources and the cogni-\ntive resources discussed in relation to the RIM. Vohs & Faber, (2 007 ) argue that\nimpulsive spending, a phenomenon expected to occur under circumstances that\ninhibit refl ective processing, does indeed occur more often when participants are\ndepleted of self-regulatory resources. A structurally similar argument is made with\nrespect to overeating among dieters (Vohs & Heatherton 2 000 ). Further evidence for\nthis integration of theories comes from research showing that effortful self-\nregulation has a detrimental effect on subsequent reasoning capabilities (Schmeichel,\nVohs, & Baumeister, 2 003 ). The bidirectionality of this effect, that is, a negative\neffect that prior refl ective decision-making exerts on subsequent self-regulation, is\nshown in a laboratory paradigm encompassing many simple decisions followed by\na self-regulatory exercise. The effect\u2019s bidirectionality also surfaces in a fi eld study\nin which shoppers who reported having made effortful decisions previously solved\nfewer math problems than those who had engaged in fewer decisions during their\nshopping trip (Vohs et al., 2008 ). Although this evidence hints at a connection\nbetween self-regulatory and refl ective cognitive resources, these studies do not\nshow a direct link between the two. Other research shows that dietary standards and\nexplicit target attitudes predict behavior only when self-regulatory resources are\navailable; when it is not, implicit attitudes are better predictors (Friese, Hofmann, &\nW\u00e4nke, 2008 ; Hofmann, Rauch, & Gawronski, 2 007 ). The fact that impulsive and\nrefl ective predictors diverge depending on the availability of self-regulatory\nresources underlines the conceptualization of self-regulation as a confl ict between\nimpulsive and refl ective behavioral activation. Together with the evidence presented\nby Vohs ( 2006 ), these fi ndings permit the conclusion that research on resource-\nbased self-regulation can be integrated into the RIM. It remains to be seen whether\nself-regulatory resources are equivalent to working memory resources or whether\nthey constitute their own construct. 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 159\nImplications of the RIM\nThinking Is Tough!\nC oming up with a complex plan of action is not a simple endeavor. The Trojan\nHorse required the cunning Odysseus to think hard for a long time, and this story is\none of the main reasons he endures as a hero fi gure. In general terms, it is not easy\nto engage in refl ective processing\u2014beyond the subjective feeling of diffi culty, there\nmay be physical limits to the human ability to think (Gailliot et al., 2007 ). Although\nthinking may sometimes be facilitated when the refl ective and impulsive systems\nare in accord, people must often use refl ective processing against the pull of impul-\nsive associations. Whether this struggle is due to temptation or to particularly com-\nplex challenges in the environment, the diffi culty in staying the refl ective course is\nclear.\nH owever, cultivating moral or thoughtful habits may become easier with time.\nSpecifi c propositional operations can become associated with the feeling of tempta-\ntion if they are activated often enough, and even the experiential component of\nrefl ective operation (the feeling of effortful cognition) is itself represented in the\nimpulsive system and may thus become associated with it. For careful planning\nhabits, positive affect associated with successful plans may lead to the process of\nplanning itself acquiring a positive valence, with these habits of thought perhaps\neventually becoming inculcated through successful implementation. However, this\neffect is not suffi cient to become truly automatic. Although refl ective processing\nmay become facilitated by such mechanisms, propositional reasoning itself cannot\nbecome automated. If resources are lacking, not even these habits of refl ection will\nmake for better control of impulses or careful planning. No matter how accessible\nthe relevant propositional transformations may be in the impulsive system, refl ec-\ntive resources are required if a person is actually to bring those transformations to\nbear upon activated concepts.\nThe habit of critical metacognition is a particularly interesting case. Metacognition\nrefers to thoughts about one\u2019s own thoughts, and critical metacognition is therefore\nthose thoughts that evaluate the thinking process. In cognitive-behavioral therapy,\nthoughts are actively evaluated by the patient and classifi ed as rational or irrational\n(Baer, 2003 ). The goal of such interventions is often to change dysfunctional behav-\nior or thinking patterns, such as \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d (Beck, 1976 ). Pursuing this kind\nof metacognitive thought alteration or suppression may be especially diffi cult\nbecause of the vast refl ective resources required. A strong association between the\nmetacognitive monitoring process and the undesired thoughts would eventually\nactivate the latter rather than suppress them, requiring additional refl ective resources\nto eliminate them. Evidence from studies on emotional disorders shows that meta-\ncognitive thought suppression does indeed increase the frequency of unwanted\nthoughts (Purdon, 1999) . Although long-term use of metacognitive strategies may\neventually divest undesired thoughts of their potency, it seems clear that the way\nthere is a long and cognitively taxing one. 160 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nSometimes No Means Yes If I Can\u2019t Process It\nGiven the research showing that negation is a refl ective process that requires refl ec-\ntive resources (Deutsch et al., 2006 , 2009; Grant, Malaviya, & Sternthal, 2004 ), one\nmust wonder at the effi cacy of negated persuasive messages. Evidence showing that\nolder adults may be more likely to misremember explicitly negated information has\nbeen interpreted as a warning against negatively worded statements in healthcare\nmaterials (Wilson & Park, 2 008 ). Wakefi eld et al.\u2019s ( 2008 ) fi nding that antismoking\ncampaigns funded by tobacco companies have few, if any, negative effects on teen-\nagers\u2019 intentions to smoke may be partially due to the negated messages employed\n(e.g., \u201cThink, Don\u2019t Smoke\u201d; see Farrelly, Niederdeppe, & Yarsevich, 2 003 ). These\neffects can be explained by a lack of processing resources in recalling the content of\nthe messages. If advertisements or healthcare instructions convey associations that\nare negated in the message, then recall of the message may be confi ned to the asso-\nciation between the elements under circumstances of low refl ective resources. This\nlimitation can lead negated statements to be remembered as affi rmed. Positively\nformulated messages (i.e., those whose association mirrors their propositional con-\nnection) are more effective, as with antismoking ads that depict smoking in combi-\nnation with serious consequences for health (Biener, 2 002 ).\nThis logic might also be generalized to ethical norms in everyday life. If pre-\nsented as negated statements (such as d on\u2019t drink and drive ), strong ethical norms\nmay have a behavioral effect opposite to what is expected. If people are continually\nreminded of what they should not do, the unwanted action will be continually acti-\nvated in the impulsive system and thereby affect subsequent refl ective and impul-\nsive operations. If a sermon on the forbidden practice of adultery activates that\nconcept and its infl uence on evaluations, the listener could see some other members\nof the congregation as attractive for possibly committing adultery with them. Of\ncourse, this possibility would be negated, but only if the listener had suffi cient\nrefl ective resources available to perform the negation. It would be particularly prob-\nlematic in cases where the forbidden behavior is hedonically attractive to start with;\nthe activation of the concept would then also activate the expectation of the pleasant\nfeeling associated with it and elicit an approach orientation. A better approach to\nethics according to this logic might instead be to praise exemplars of morality or to\nprescribe morally positive acts as opposed to forbidding negative ones. Instead of\nsaying no to vice, one should say yes to virtue.\nImproving Implicit Self-Esteem\nI mplicit self-esteem is a much researched construct of recent years (e.g., Koole,\nDijksterhuis, & van Knippenberg, 2 001; Yamaguchi et al., 2007) . In a general sense,\nimplicit self-esteem is defi ned as an automatic evaluation of the self that occurs\nnonconsciously and affects spontaneous reactions to self-relevant stimuli (Bosson,\net al. 2000) . Implicit self-esteem has been shown to specifi cally predict diverse 9 Refl ection and Impulse as Determinants of Human Behavior 161\noutcomes in a range of situations, including apparent anxiety in participants as they\ncomplete a self-relevant interview (Spalding & Hardin, 1 999) , levels of implicit\ngender bias in combination with implicit gender identity (Aidman & Carroll, 2 003 ),\nand depressive symptomatology 6 months after measurement (Franck, De Readt, &\nDe Houwer, 2 007 ). Explicit self-esteem (i.e., explicit evaluations of self-worth), on\nthe other hand, has specifi c predictive power for subjective well-being (Schimmack\n& Diener, 2003 ). It is the combination of the two constructs, however, that has\nexcited most interest in recent years. In particular, the question of discrepant self-\nesteem has been examined (Zeigler-Hill, 2 006) . That is, what effects do high explicit\nbut low implicit, or low explicit but high implicit, self-esteem have on behavior?\nOne direct prediction based on psychodynamic theory concerns narcissism. The\nmask model of narcissism assumes that narcissistic individuals are characterized by\ndeep self-doubt (corresponding to low implicit self-esteem), which they compen-\nsate for by projecting grandiose self-views (corresponding to extremely high explicit\nself-esteem) (Bosson et al., 2008 ). Empirical evidence supporting this model has\nremained mixed, however, perhaps partly because of the relative unreliability of\nmeasures of implicit self-esteem (Bosson et al., 2 000 ).\nB y rather precisely spelling out the concepts involved, the RIM can contribute to\nthe discussion of these and other phenomena of the implicit self. Implicit self-\nesteem might, for instance, be conceptualized as the total valence of the associative\npattern linked with activation of the self in the impulsive system. This specifi cation\nwould imply recommendations for effective measures of implicit self-esteem\u2014\nnamely, measures that do not require any explicit judgment but rather depend solely\non valence and behavior interference (e.g., the IAT, measures based on the logic of\naffective priming). In addition, the same logic that is applied to automatic stereotype\nreduction training (Gawronski et al., 2008) may be applied to the implicit self-\nesteem construct. Doing so yields a method through which to increase implicit self-\nesteem by consistently affi rming positive pairings of valence and self (e.g.,\nDijksterhuis, 2 004 ), suggesting a possible avenue for therapy of narcissism and\nother negative effects of low implicit self-esteem.\nConclusion\nT he RIM offers a multitude of predictions that can help improve the understanding\nof the link between knowledge and action, whether it be explaining the reasoning\nprocesses behind complex plans such as the Trojan Horse, the seemingly self-\ndestructive fl ight of Icarus, or even the confl ict between rationality and impulse as\nepitomized in Odysseus\u2019 suffering of the Siren\u2019s song. Although effortful, refl ec-\ntive processing may occur in fl uent synergy with impulsive processing, there are\noften confl icts between the two systems. Their resolution is a question of available\nrefl ective resources and motivation to use them. But whether the systems work in\nconcert or struggle against one another, the pathway to behavior is ultimately the\nsame\u2014behavioral schemata are activated depending on the results of both 162 A. Krishna and F. Strack\nsystems\u2019 processing. However, it is not just knowledge that may determine action\nin the context of the RIM. The bidirectional associative links between behavioral\nschemata and other elements of the impulsive system mean that action, in turn,\ninfl uences knowledge. This bidirectionality in combination with the functioning of\nthe two systems can tell much about what it means to think and act, when No might\nappear to mean Yes, and how to pinpoint and modify the elusive implicit self.\nReferences\nAidman, E.

Chapter 10\nPlanning and the Control of Action\nFrank Wieber and Peter M. Gollwitzer\nP lanning has been found to have a powerful effect on human actions (e.g., Gollwitzer\n& Sheeran, 2006) . But how do people plan? In this chapter we fi rst introduce imple-\nmentation intentions (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1 999) as an effi cient way of planning.\nImplementation intentions refer to specifi c plans in which individuals and groups\ncan specify when, where, and how they intend to act using an if-then format (e.g.,\n\u201cIf I come home from work on Fridays, then I will immediately put on my jogging\nshoes and go for a 30-minute run!\u201d). After we examine how they support goal pur-\nsuit, we differentiate between spontaneous and strategic planning\u2014two ways in\nwhich if\u2013then plans can be made on the basis of goal-related knowledge.\nWith respect to spontaneous planning, we highlight the importance of the acces-\nsibility of goal-related knowledge. We introduce goal systems theory (Kruglanski,\nShah, Fishbach, Friedman, Chun, & Sleeth-Keppler, 2 002) as a conceptual frame-\nwork because it addresses the question of how goals can increase the accessibility\nof knowledge about when, where, and how to pursue the goal. To illustrate how the\naccessibility of goal-related knowledge facilitates goal attainment, we discuss a set\nof recent studies. They show that individuals spontaneously grasp goal-relevant\ninformation in the form of implementation intentions (Marquardt, Tr\u00f6ger, Wieber,\n& Gollwitzer, 2 016 ; see also Marquardt, 2 011 ) even if it is incidentally provided in\ntheir environment and that they use this knowledge to improve their goal attainment\nwithout being prompted to do so.\nF.

Gollwitzer\nR egarding strategic planning, we argue that individuals\u2019 knowledge about their\ngoals, potential obstacles during goal pursuit, and effective goal-directed actions is\ncentral to devising effective plans and to the successful control of action. We intro-\nduce Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII; Oettingen,\nWittchen, & Gollwitzer, 2 013; Oettingen, 2 014) as an effective self-regulation strat-\negy with which to systematize the selection of goal-relevant knowledge and the\ntranslation of that knowledge into if\u2013then plans. In this chapter we discuss a recent\nexperimental study suggesting that such strategic planning is very useful in unstruc-\ntured situational contexts that require identifi cation and selection of appropriate\ngoal-relevant knowledge. We further suggest that strategic planning is less useful in\nstructured situational contexts that prompt the goal-directed actions without requir-\ning any knowledge about advantageous opportunities to act and about potential\nobstacles (Sailer et al., 2 015 ). We conclude by emphasizing how useful spontaneous\nand strategic planning is for transforming individuals\u2019 goal-related knowledge into\naction.\nControlling Actions by Goals and Implementation Intentions\nI n the psychology of action (e.g., Lewin, Dembo, Festinger, & Sears, 1 944 ;\nGollwitzer & Bargh, 1996 ), two phenomena are thought to be relevant to goal pur-\nsuit: goal-setting and goal-striving. They are governed by different principles. Goal-\nsetting is concerned with the choice of a desired end state for which to strive (What\nis being pursued?); goal-striving is associated with moving toward the desired end\nstate (How is the goal being pursued?). Goals are thereby defi ned as desired end\nstates that people intend to attain and to which they commit themselves (Gollwitzer\n& Oettingen, 2012) . For individuals to commit themselves fi rmly to a goal, they\nmust perceive it as highly desirable and feasible. These assessments are based on an\nindividual\u2019s knowledge about a potential pursuit of the goal. Knowing that sunny\nweather has been forecast and having no commitments for the coming weekend, for\nexample, one might judge a weekend trip to a nearby national park as both desirable\nand feasible and might consequently commit oneself to the goal of going on a week-\nend trip to that place.\nNonetheless, even when individuals have strongly pledged themselves to a goal,\nsuch commitment does not guarantee successful goal attainment. This fact is\nreferred to as the intention\u2013behavior gap (e.g., Sheeran, 2 002 ). In a meta-analysis\nby Webb and Sheeran (2 006 ), for instance, a moderate-to-large change (d = 0.66) in\nthe strength of individuals\u2019 intentions resulted in only a small-to-moderate change\nin the individuals\u2019 behavior ( d = 0.36). In considering why the transition of one\u2019s\nintention into goal-directed actions might fail, researchers (e.g., Gollwitzer &\nSheeran, 2 006 ) have identifi ed several typical problems that have to be overcome\nduring goal-striving. People must start acting on a goal, persist or even intensify\ntheir efforts in the face of diffi culties or obstacles, shield their goal from interfer-\nences or distractions, abandon ineffective means or even the goal itself if it becomes 10 Planning and the Control of Action 171\nobviously unattainable, and economize on their limited resources to self-regulate\ntheir actions. Knowledge about the when, where, and how of striving toward a goal\nis necessary, but not suffi cient, for successfully attaining it. Even when individuals\nknow how to pursue a goal, they might struggle to turn their knowledge into goal-\ndirected actions. Strategies that allow effective regulation of one\u2019s thoughts, feel-\nings, and actions during goal-striving are needed. One time- and cost-effi cient\nstrategy to promote individuals\u2019 goal-striving is to devise implementation intentions\nfor planning when, where, and how one intends to act (Gollwitzer, 1993 , 1999 ,\n2 014 ; overview by Wieber, Th\u00fcrmer, & Gollwitzer, 2 015b ). In implementation\nintentions, people specify a well-suited or critical future situation and link an adap-\ntive goal-directed response to it in an if\u2013then format. For example, aa person intend-\ning to learn a new language might opt for one of the following implementation\nintentions: \u201cIf I am fi nished eating my Sunday morning breakfast, then I will work\nthrough one lecture of the language course on my computer,\u201d or \u201cIf \u2018New E-mail\u2019\nnotifi cations pop up while I am working on the language course on my computer,\nthen I will ignore them.\u201d\nWhat is so special about such simple if\u2013then plans? Researchers studying the\nprocesses underlying the effects of implementation intentions have systematically\ntried to answer to this question. Essentially, implementation intentions are at the\njunction of controlled and automatic processes (e.g., Evans, 2 008 ; Strack & Deutsch,\n2004) . The intentional formation of if\u2013then plans typically emerges from delibera-\ntion on when, where, and how to act. By contrast, the implementation of goal-\ndirected action in response to an existing, specifi ed, critical situation entails features\nof automaticity (e.g., Bargh, 1 994 ): Effects of implementation intentions have been\nobserved to be immediate and effi cient, and once the specifi ed situation is encoun-\ntered they come about without requiring extensive deliberation on how to respond\n(e.g., Aarts, Dijksterhuis, & Midden, 1 999 ; Webb & Sheeran, 2 007 , 2 008 ; Wieber\n& Sassenberg, 2 006 ).\nI ndeed, empirical evidence suggests that forming implementation intentions in\naddition to mere goals leads to faster responses to critical situations (e.g., Parks-\nStamm, Gollwitzer, & Oettingen, 2007 ) and improved performance in a secondary\ntask without compromising the simultaneous performance in a primary task (i.e.,\nspeed-up effects are still evident under high cognitive load; e.g., Brandst\u00e4tter,\nLengfelder, & Gollwitzer, 2001) . This research also suggests that there is no need\nfor a further conscious intent to act in a critical moment. For instance, Bayer,\nAchtziger, Gollwitzer, and Moskowitz ( 2009) found that implementation inten-\ntions encouraged successful pursuit of a goal even when the critical cue was pre-\nsented subliminally, that is, when it was not consciously recognized. Moreover,\nstudies of the human brain have found evidence that implementation intentions\nchange action control from slow top-down to fast bottom-up processes (e.g.,\nGilbert, Gollwitzer, Cohen, Oettingen, & Burgess, 2009 ; Schweiger Gallo, Keil,\nMcCulloch, Rockstroh, & Gollwitzer, 2009; Hallam et al., 2015) . In summary,\nimplementation intentions strategically automate the control of goal-directed\nactions, instantly and effi ciently activating the action response linked to a critical\nsituation when the individual enters it. 172 F. Wieber and P.M. Gollwitzer\nThe Role of Knowledge Accessibility in Planning\nand in the Control of Action\nT o assist the individual\u2019s pursuit of a goal effectively, implementation intentions\nneed to specify relevant critical situations in the if-component and instrumental\nresponses in the then-component (see also Gollwitzer, Wieber, Myers, & McCrea,\n2009 ). Prior studies have generally observed that people can indeed identify and\nself-select suitable situations and responses (e.g., Adriaanse, de Ridder, & de Wit,\n2009 ; Gollwitzer & Brandst\u00e4tter, 1 997 ). In fact, both experimenter-provided and\nself-generated implementation intentions have been shown to foster goal attainment\neffectively (Armitage, 2 009 ). But how do people generate effective plans?\nI ndividuals have to access goal-relevant knowledge before they can further pro-\ncess this information. Generally, psychological research shows wide agreement that\nknowledge accessibility is important for individuals\u2019 cognition and behavior (over-\nview by Wyer, 2008) . As for the accessibility of goal-related knowledge, goal sys-\ntems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002) affords a helpful conceptual framework for\nunderstanding how pursuing a goal affects the accessibility and application of\nknowledge that is relevant to planning. This theory rests on a cognitive approach to\nmotivation. Its proponents apply a network conceptualization that allows for\ndynamic and malleable modeling of the activation and permits application of cogni-\ntive content to motivation content. Within this \u201cmotivation-as-cognition\u201d approach,\ngoal systems are defi ned as \u201cthe mental representations of motivational networks\ncomposed of interconnected goals and means\u201d (Kruglanski et al., 2 002, p. 333).\nGiven this connectedness of goals and means, the activation of a mental representa-\ntion of a goal should also activate the mental representation of suitable means to\npursue this goal. When this idea is applied to planning, it follows that when one is\npursuing a goal (e.g., to prepare a healthy dinner), knowledge of possible means that\nis relevant to planning the when, where, and how of goal-striving becomes easily\naccessible (e.g., thinking of the salad in one\u2019s fridge and of the tomatoes that one\nhas to purchase on the way home).\nTwo properties of the interconnections are thus especially interesting for the acti-\nvation of goal-relevant knowledge: structure and strength. As far as the structure of\nthe interconnections are concerned, the number of means that are attached to a goal\ncan vary. For one person, activating the physical fi tness goal might activate only the\nmeans of going to the gym, but for another person it might activate a multitude of\nmeans (e.g., going to the gym, riding a bike to work, and taking the stairs). In addi-\ntion to such interindividual differences, the number of means connected to a goal\nmight also vary from one goal to the next. For instance, there might be numerous\nways to pursue the goal of eating healthily (e.g., eating at least fi ve portions of fruit\nand vegetables a day, drinking water rather than soft drinks) but only a few ways to\npursue the goal of acquiring a driver\u2019s license (i.e., taking the offi cial test).\nConcerning the strength of the interconnections, one may expect the strength of the\ncognitive association between the goal and the means for achieving it to be stronger\nwhen the number of those means is relatively low than when it is relatively high. 10 Planning and the Control of Action 173\nGoing to the gym will probably be more likely to come to one\u2019s mind if it is the only\nmeans rather than one of several that are connected to one\u2019s physical fi tness goal. In\nsummary, the structure and strength of the goal\u2013means interconnections relating to\na given goal seem relevant to planning because the activation of knowledge about\npotential means is a starting point for individual planning. Thus, the activation of\nthe goal should ease the access to the knowledge relevant to the when and where\n(the if-component) and to the how (the then-component) of implementing that goal.\nSpontaneous Use of Incidentally Presented Goal-Relevant\nInformation\nGiven the importance of accessibility, one might wonder whether incidental knowl-\nedge that is offered in an external context is also used by individuals to support their\npursuit of a goal. In other words, are individuals capable of grasping goal-relevant\nknowledge about suitable opportunities, potential obstacles, and instrumental action\nstrategies without much conscious effort?\nS tudies by Marquardt et al. ( 2016) addressed this question. They tested whether\nincidentally furnished goal-relevant information favors subsequent goal attainment.\nMoreover, they investigated whether the spontaneous use of incidentally provided\nimplementation intentions depends on the activation of the particular goal. The\nauthors expected that individuals would make spontaneous use of incidentally pro-\nvided implementation intentions\u2014but only when the goal had been previously\nactivated.\nMarquardt et al. ( 2016 ) fi rst examined whether incidentally communicated plans\ncan promote high school students\u2019 achievement in a school setting. Initially, the\nresearchers implicitly activated the achievement goal of the participating students\nby having them work on a crossword puzzle containing either achievement-related\nwords (achievement-goal condition) or neutral words (no achievement-goal-control\ncondition). Priming the goal rather than asking individuals to set the goal them-\nselves was intended to reduce the likelihood that they would try to plan consciously.\nTo induce spontaneous implementation intention, all students in the study com-\npleted on paper a puzzle about sentence construction. It presented 34 sentence frag-\nments in scrambled order. The task of the students was to (a) form six meaningful\nsentences by connecting the fragments and (b) write down these sentences. All six\nsentences had been composed as conditional phrases (if\u2013then structure). The only\ndifference between the intention conditions was that one of the six sentences in the\nimplementation-intention condition was relevant to the subsequent creativity task\n(\u201cIf I have found a use, then I will instantly search for the next use.\u201d), whereas none\nof the six sentences in the no-achievement-goal condition and the mere- achievement-\ngoal condition were relevant to the subsequent creativity task.\nStudents then worked on an ostensibly unrelated alternative- uses task (Guilford,\n1967 ), in which they had to write down as many different ways of using a matchbox 174 F. Wieber and P.M. Gollwitzer\nas possible. The number of different ways that students came up with was used to\nmeasure the effects of the manipulations of the goal and the plan. The results showed\nthat participants in the achievement-goal-plus-implementation-intention condition\nfound more uses for a matchbox than did the participants in the mere-achievement-\ngoal and no-achievement-goal-control conditions. Thus, giving goal-relevant infor-\nmation (i.e., the implementation intention) improved goal attainment even when the\ninformation was delivered incidentally (i.e., before participants knew that it consti-\ntuted an effective planning strategy for performing well on a later task). These fi nd-\nings tentatively bear out our argument that people can spontaneously use goal-related\nknowledge to bolster their goal attainment.\nT o corroborate these fi ndings, Marquardt et al. (2 016) ran a second study on the\nspontaneous use of goal-relevant knowledge. This time, the degree to which the\nindividuals\u2019 healthy-diet goal benefi ted from incidentally shared plans to eat health-\nily was tested in a university cafeteria. The study was divided into two parts. The\nfi rst part took place in the morning and served to manipulate participants\u2019 goal to eat\nhealthily. Participants either read a short text of evidence-based arguments for a bal-\nanced diet with fi ve portions of fruits and vegetables a day (healthy-diet goal condi-\ntion) or a neutral text on nutrition science in Germany (no-goal-control condition),\nwhich was approximately the same length and had no words related to the healthy-\ndiet goal.\nBelow the goal manipulation texts, a graphical display was positioned on the\ninformation sheet. This display was used to manipulate the incidentally offered\nplan. In all three conditions\u2014no-healthy-diet-goal-control (A), mere-healthy-diet-\ngoal (B), and mere-healthy-diet-goal-plus-implementation-intention (C)\u2014partici-\npants received pictorial information on how to act on the healthy-diet goal. The\ngraphical display consisted of three photographs showing the cafeteria\u2019s salad bar,\nthe vegetable bar, and the fruit shelf (each seen from the perspective of an individual\nstanding directly in front it). All participants therefore had identical information on\nthe how of eating healthily at the cafeteria. However, only participants in condition\nC received two additional pieces of information. First, to the left of the three photo-\ngraphs, the participants saw one photograph of the cafeteria entrance. This image\nthus depicted a suitable opportunity for them to act on their healthy-diet goal and\ncan be thought of as specifying the if-component of an implementation intention.\nSecond, they saw an arrow pointing from the picture of the cafeteria entrance to the\nthree photographs of the suitable responses (i.e., selecting salad, fruit, and/or vege-\ntables). The arrow thereby connected the different pictures and was an equivalent to\nthe link between the if-component and the then-component in verbal implementa-\ntion intentions. In summary, participants in condition C received information on the\nhow of goal pursuit (photographs of the salad bar, the vegetable bar, and the fruit\nshelf), the when and where (picture of the cafeteria entrance), and a graphical link\nbetween the pictures that implied the characteristic structure of the if\u2013then\ncondition.\nT he second part of the experiment took place during lunch time. Participants\ncompleted a questionnaire after they had fi nished their meal at the cafeteria. They\nindicated how many portions of salad, vegetables, and fruit they had consumed 10 Planning and the Control of Action 175\nthere on which day. The total sum was used to measure the effects that the goal and\nplan manipulation had on the diet of the participants. Participants in condition C\nconsumed a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods than did participants in\neither condition A or B. Thus, passing on if\u2013then information that was relevant to\nplanning improved goal attainment even when this information came incidentally\n(in this case, through a graphical display).\nT ogether, these fi ndings further underline the importance of knowledge accessi-\nbility for individuals\u2019 goal pursuits. People readily used their newly acquired goal-\nrelated knowledge to conceive if\u2013then plans for their goal attainment spontaneously.\nIn our view, such spontaneous planning highlights the fact that automatic processes\ncan be instrumental in the adaptive control of action. It is, however, important to\nnote that the spontaneous planning occurred on the basis of an activated goal, fur-\nther indicating that effects of implementation intention depend on the activation of\na superordinate goal (Sheeran, Webb, & Gollwitzer, 2 005 ).\nStrategic Use of Goal-Relevant Knowledge with MCII\nThe use of goal intentions to guide action is aided by the coactivation of means\nassociated with a goal. However, identifying and forming effective if\u2013then plans\nmight vary in diffi culty, depending on the individual, the situation, and the specifi c\ngoal. It may well be that neither the automatic activation of goal-related knowledge\nnor the spontaneous acquisition and use of incidentally presented goal-relevant\ninformation is enough to guide individuals\u2019 actions successfully when pursuing the\ngoal is diffi cult (e.g., when that pursuit is cognitively or motivationally demanding).\nA goal can be diffi cult for reasons related to the individual, such as internal obsta-\ncles (e.g., ego control or procrastination; see Gollwitzer, Bayer, & McCulloch,\n2005 ; Wieber & Gollwitzer, 2 010 , i n press ). Or it may be diffi cult because of the\nsituation, that is, because of external obstacles (e.g., distractions; see Wieber, von\nSuchodoletz, Heikamp, Trommsdorff, & Gollwitzer, 2 011 ). Whatever the case,\nindividuals must carefully select the action they include in the if- and then-\ncomponents of their implementation intentions. Depending on the goal at hand and\non the existing ideas about goals and means, individuals might either narrow their\nfocus to fewer situations and responses or extend the range of situations and\nresponses they take into account when pursuing their goal. If people experience\nproblems with sticking to a healthy diet when watching TV in the evening, they\nmight want to address this situation specifi cally. Or when people experience prob-\nlems with recognizing opportunities to exercise, they might want to expand the situ-\nations and means connected to their physical fi tness goal.\nA systematic guide to planning would be helpful for such challenging goal pur-\nsuit, and that guide exists\u2014the preparation of if\u2013then planning by means of mental\ncontrasting (e.g., Oettingen et al., 2009; Oettingen, Pak, & Schnetter, 2001 ; for\nsummaries see Oettingen, 2 012 , 2014 ). Mental contrasting brings individuals to\nactively search through their goal-relevant knowledge and select or even derive 176 F. Wieber and P.M. Gollwitzer\ncritical situations and suitable responses. In the application of the strategy, individu-\nals are asked to formulate a personal wish, to imagine positive future outcomes of\nrealizing that wish, and to mentally contrast these outcomes with current potential\nobstacles to their goal-striving. Mental contrasting thereby increases the accessibil-\nity of both a positive future vision and the current reality, instilling a sense that\naction is necessary. Moreover, mental contrasting is thought to activate relevant\nexpectations that allow for an adjustment of personal goal commitment (a person\u2019s\nattachment to a goal or the decisiveness to reach it; Locke, Latham, & Erez, 1 988 ).\nIf the expectation of reaching the desired outcome is high, commitment is strength-\nened by mental contrasting; if it is low and effort might be in vain, commitment is\nweakened and individuals disengage.\nI n the next step, MCII guides individuals in using this knowledge of potential\nobstacles and in detecting instrumental responses to each of them. Corroborating\nthe effectiveness of combining mental contrasting and implementation intentions,\none study found that MCII participants reported greater success at reducing their\nunhealthy snacking consumption than did participants who used either only mental\ncontrasting or only implementation intentions (Study 2 in Adriaanse et al., 2 010 ).\nAccording to this line of thought, MCII is likeliest to contribute to one\u2019s goal attain-\nment when the strategic search for one\u2019s goal-relevant knowledge and planning can\nmake a difference. MCII is less likely to do so when one\u2019s environment prompts the\nwhen, where, and how of goal-directed actions to begin with.\nO ne study by Sailer et al. (2 015 ) addresses this argument. The authors ran an\nMCII intervention study on physical exercise in a clinical context. Previous research\nhad indicated that regular exercise can have positive effects on both the physical and\nmental health of persons with schizophrenia. However, shortcomings in cognition,\nperception, affect, and volition make it especially diffi cult for people with schizo-\nphrenia to plan a behavior and follow through on it. As a result, studies that had\nincorporated exercise reported poor attendance and high drop-out rates, indicating\nthat schizophrenic patients were not able to overcome the manifold barriers to phys-\nical activity. Sailer et al. therefore tested whether MCII helps convert schizophrenic\nindividuals\u2019 exercise intentions into behavior while taking into account the support-\niveness of the situational context.\nT he patients diagnosed with a schizophrenic spectrum disorder lived in either an\nautonomy-focused setting (a self-supply ward with daytime care by nurses, medical\ndoctors, and psychologists) or a highly structured setting (a ward providing intense\ntherapy to activate patients and affording continuous availability of psychiatric\ncare). Whereas participants in the autonomy-focused setting had to manage attend-\ning the exercise groups on their own, those in the highly structured setting were\nactively reminded and invited to each exercise session. The authors predicted that\nengaging in MCII would help individuals attain their exercise goals in the autonomy-\nfocused setting (in which each search and application of goal-relevant knowledge\ndepended on the patients themselves) but not in the highly structured setting (in\nwhich the environment made the relevant information available in order to prompt\nthe goal-directed actions). To test this prediction, participants who agreed to partici-\npate in the study were randomly assigned to an information-plus-goal-intention 10 Planning and the Control of Action 177\ncondition (control group) or an information-plus-MCII condition (MCII group).\nPatients in the control group read a nonfi ction text on the benefi ts of physical activ-\nity and on potential obstacles for which one must prepare (e.g., motivational prob-\nlems and tiredness). They then set the goal to attend jogging sessions and wrote it\ndown. Patients in the MCII group read the same nonfi ction text and then worked\nthrough the MCII strategy, listing three positive outcomes associated with attending\nthe exercise session (e.g., losing weight) and three obstacles (e.g., feeling tired).\nNext, they identifi ed their most important obstacle and, with their therapist, worked\nout a specifi c solution to this obstacle before translating it into an implementation\nintention in the if\u2013then format: \u201cIf [obstacle], then I will [response].\u201d In both groups\nparticipants were treated by a trained therapist during individual training sessions\nthat involved an equal amount of contact between the therapist and each of the\npatients.\nT he attendance and persistence of the patients in the exercise program of the\nparticipating clinics during the 4 weeks after their treatment was measured as the\ndependent variable. In both the autonomy-focused and the highly structured setting,\ntwo jogging sessions were scheduled every week and did not confl ict with therapies\nor other events. During jogging sessions, participants could run at their own pace\nand decide how long they wanted to run. Results in the highly structured setting\nshowed that MCII and control participants alike attended about 70 % of the offered\nexercise sessions. In the autonomy-focused setting, however, control participants\nattended less than 40 % of the sessions, whereas the MCII participants continued\nattending about 70 % of them. When it comes to successful goal attainment, these\nfi ndings demonstrate the importance of self-regulating one\u2019s goal pursuits and goal-\nstriving in rather unstructured situations. When goal-directed actions were prompted\ncontextually, MCII did not improve goal attainment, for it was already rather high.\nBut when goal-related knowledge mattered because remembering and initiating the\ngoal-directed actions was up to individuals, MCII did improve goal attainment.\nThese fi ndings imply that the MCII self-regulation strategy constitutes a time- and\ncost-effi cient action-control tool that helps patients with severe mental illness (see\nalso Toli, Webb, & Hardy, 2 016 ) to achieve their health-related goals in an autono-\nmous setting.\nStrategic Planning of the Automatic Activation of Goal-Relevant\nKnowledge\nIn addition to the spontaneous and strategic planning described above, planning\nwith implementation intentions can also be benefi cial as a context-sensitive reminder\nof one\u2019s strategies or goals that supports refl ective decision making and goal-\ndirected actions. This strategic use of the automatic effects of planning with imple-\nmentation intentions is related to the demands that have been postulated for\nhuman-centered computer systems in information management. The aim in the 178 F. Wieber and P.M. Gollwitzer\ninteraction between humans and computers in sociotechnical systems is to commu-\nnicate the right information at the right time and the right place in the right way to\nthe right person in order to empower that person to fi nd and select the best goal-\ndirected response (e.g., Fischer, 2 012 ). Implementation intentions might also be\nused to achieve this end.\nFirst, implementation intentions provide the relevant information about instru-\nmental action responses in critical situations during goal pursuit. In a study on group\ndecision-making (Th\u00fcrmer, Wieber, & Gollwitzer, 2 015a , 2 015b ), participants set\nthemselves the goal of performing well. In keeping with this goal, they then either\ngenerated the specifi c goal of reviewing the advantages of the nonpreferred alterna-\ntives before making a group decision (control condition) or included this strategy in\nthe implementation intention: \u201cAnd when we fi nally take the decision sheet to note\nour preferred alternative, then we will go over the advantages of the non-preferred\nalternatives again\u201d (Th\u00fcrmer et al., 2 015a, p. 104). As a result of this small differ-\nence in planning, implementation-intention groups succeeded more often than mere\ngoal-intention groups at transforming their respective intentions into actions and\nthereby improving their goal attainment. Apparently, implementation intentions\nprovided the strategy information to the group members just before the group deci-\nsion was taken and thereby oriented them in their search for the best solution to the\nissue on which they were about to decide.\nS econd, implementation intentions have also been found to be capable of activat-\ning one\u2019s goal at a critical juncture and thereby increasing the impact of this goal on\nindividuals\u2019 cognition and behavior (van Koningsbruggen, Stroebe, Papies, & Aarts,\n2 011 ). In a study on dieting, unsuccessful dieters either formed a think-of-dieting\nimplementation intention (\u201cThe next time that I am tempted to eat chocolate [cook-\nies, pizza, French fries, or chips], then I will think of dieting\u201d) or just indicated why\nit was important for them to resist the temptation to eat chocolate [cookies, pizza,\nFrench fries, or chips]. In a subsequent word-completion task, participants in the\nimplementation-intention condition were instructed to fi ll in unfi nished words (e.g.,\n_ij_e_) that were preceded by one of the fi ve food cues (e.g., chocolate). In complet-\ning the task, they used diet-related words (e.g., l ijnen , Dutch for dieting) instead of\nneutral words (e.g., t ijger , Dutch for tiger) more often than control participants did.\nEvidently, implementation intentions reminded individuals of their dieting goal\nwhen they encountered a tempting situation (Study 1) and thus empowered unsuc-\ncessful dieters to reduce their consumption of palatable foods (Study 2). Together,\nthe fi ndings of these studies (Th\u00fcrmer et al., 2 015a , 2015b ; van Koningsbruggen\net al., 2 011; see also Wieber, Th\u00fcrmer, & Gollwitzer, 2 015a) demonstrate that stra-\ntegic automation of action control by planning with implementation intentions can\nserve goal attainment even when a refl ective decision needs to be made or when\nindividuals are not aware of instrumental action strategies at the time of planning. 10 Planning and the Control of Action 179\nConclusion and Outlook\nI n this chapter we have examined the role that knowledge has in planning and\naction control. We have stressed that knowing which goal one intends to pursue\nand committing oneself to that goal are often only the fi rst step toward successful\ngoal attainment. Planning when, where, and how to act with implementation\nintentions has proven to be an effective self-regulation strategy for reducing this\nintention\u2013behavior gap. Regarding the acquisition and use of plan-relevant\nknowledge, we have argued that individuals have a variety of ways to form\nimplementation intentions. They range from spontaneous planning of how to\napproach a goal on the basis of accessible goal-related knowledge to strategic\nplanning that includes a systematic search of knowledge for critical situations\nand instrumental action responses.\nW ith respect to spontaneous planning, we have argued that the activation of a\ngoal coactivates goal-relevant knowledge and thus greatly facilitates the decision\non when, where, and how to pursue the goal. Although this automatic coactivation\nis likely to be an adaptive mechanism that promotes successful control of action\nmost of the time, it can also hinder behavioral change. For instance, having the\ngoal of getting to work might automatically induce one to take the car rather than\nuse public transport, even if one intends to adopt a sustainable lifestyle (e.g.,\nBamberg, 2 000 ). In that sense, strategic planning is a powerful self-regulatory\ntool informing behavioral change. In fact, authors of meta-analyses of effects that\nimplementation intention has on physical activity (B\u00e9langer-Gravel, Godin, &\nAmireault, 2 013 ) and eating behavior (Adriaanse, Vinkers, de Ridder, Hox, & de\nWit, 2 011 ) found that implementation intentions successfully aid the translation\nof individuals\u2019 intentions into action. The strategic automation of action control\nby implementation intentions has even been found to remind the individual of a\nuseful refl ective strategy (Th\u00fcrmer et al., 2 015a) , to reinforce one\u2019s goal in a criti-\ncal situation (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2011) , or to foster the restructuring of\nautomatic goal\u2013means connections that are required to change habitual behavior\n(e.g., Adriaanse, Gollwitzer, de Ridder, de Wit, & Kroese, 2 011 ). Combining\nmental contrasting and implementation intentions in order to extend planning has\nproven more effective than either mental contrasting or implementation intentions\nalone (Study 2 in Adriaanse et al., 2 010) . Hence, strategic planning with MCII\nappears to be an especially effective tool for encouraging individuals to make\neffective use of their goal-relevant knowledge and thus improve the attainment of\ntheir goals. In summary, the planning research we have presented in this chapter\nhighlights the adaptive role of spontaneous and strategic planning in turning an\nindividual\u2019s knowledge into action. 180 F.

Chapter 11\nPragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function\nof Knowledge\nTilman Reitz\nEven the members of the scientific community still do not know what it means to\nlive in a \u201cknowledge\u201d society. Recent discussions of the issue are pervaded by a\ntension that is rarely noticed, for its aspects are situated within different academic\ndisciplines. The social sciences mostly lack a well-considered definition of knowl-\nedge, whereas philosophical debates about such a definition usually fail to discuss\nthe social constitution of knowledge. The following contribution presents an analy-\nsis of this problem, outlines a solution, and points out some of its implications.\nUseful inspiration is found in pragmatic philosophy and in the efforts of social\nepistemology. Yet I argue that both of these approaches, too, overlook or repress a\ntheoretical challenge: the spatial dispersion of social knowledge, which has been\nimportant since the invention of writing and storage media but which is pivotal in\nglobal networks of information. If knowledge is seated not only in the minds of\nindividuals but also in the ways in which they collectively and collaboratively map\ntheir world, then it also matters where that knowledge is kept and how access to it is\norganized. The library thus serves as a paradigm of my account. The definition that\nwill be developed permits inclusion of material resources and places in understand-\nings of knowledge, and it can be noted at the outset that the very term social episte-\nmology was coined in library studies (Shera, 1970).\nI proceed in four steps. First, I illustrate the problematic tension of sociological\ncharacterizations and philosophical definitions of knowledge. The second step\ndevelops an alternative to dominant philosophical discussions of the issue. The\nintention is to arrive at a definition that allows one to conceive of knowledge as a\ncomplex of social practices and cultural artifacts. In the third step, I compare this\napproach to results of social epistemology and identify the problem of space. Lastly,\nI place my account in the context of reflections about the knowledge society.\nT.

Reitz\nHow to Define and How to Obscure Knowledge\nOne may question whether sociological or economic accounts of the knowledge\nsociety need to define knowledge. As soon as they do, however, quite different\nviews surface. The best examples (also in the sense of solid, not simply deficient\nconsiderations) are found in the classical theories on the topic. Drucker (1969),\nprobably the first writer to offer a conception of the knowledge society, was brief in\ndefinitional matters. Using an approach that has since become widespread (outside\nphilosophy), he also made a specific point: \u201cKnowledge, that is, the systematic\norganization of information and concepts,\u2026 makes apprenticeship obsolete.\nKnowledge substitutes systematic learning for exposure to experience\u201d (p. 268). In\ncontext, Drucker focused even more on issues of application: Knowledge is ana-\nlyzed as crucial in increasing the productivity of labor.\nFour years later, Bell (1973) highlighted the opposite side when he noted a \u201cnew\ncentrality of theoretical knowledge, the primacy of theory over empiricism\u201d (p. 343,\nhis italics). Accordingly, basic science is the main reference when he defines knowl-\nedge as \u201ca set of organized statements of facts or ideas, presenting a reasoned judg-\nment or an experimental result, which is transmitted to others through some\ncommunication medium in some systematic form\u201d (p. 175). This definition has\nremained popular in descriptions of the recent, computer-based take-off of the\nknowledge society (see Castells, 1996, p. 17, for example). But the focus on explicit\nstatements cannot account for a central novelty that characterizes the work of con-\ntemporary knowledge workers or symbol analysts (Reich, 1991)\u2014the importance\nof situated problem-solving, which demands capacities of embodied or organiza-\ntional knowledge. Such a capacity is probably at stake when Willke (1998) tries to\ndefine knowledge in structures where it matters \u201cnot as truth but as a resource\u201d\n(p. 161): \u201cWhereas information designates systemically relevant differences, knowl-\nedge originates when such information is embedded in contexts of experience\u201d\n(pp. 161\u2013162, my translation).1 Unlike the standardized situations Drucker had in\nmind, this experience presumably affords more than textbooks can convey.\nHistorical differences set aside, the given examples seem to offer three system-\natically distinguishable accounts of knowledge:\n1. Knowledge as a systematic set of applicable recipes\n2. Knowledge as an organized body of theoretical statements\n3. Knowledge as a developed capacity of situated problem-solving\nThese accounts do not necessarily constitute or presuppose different concepts of\nknowledge. Maybe they are really only about different contexts in which knowledge\nmatters and thus give different perspectives on the same thing. But if there should\n1 \u201cW\u00e4hrend Informationen systemspezifisch relevante Unterschiede bezeichnen, entsteht Wissen,\nwenn solche Informationen in bestimmte Erfahrungskontexte eingebunden sind.\u201d (Willke, 1998,\npp. 161\u2013162). An interesting question would be whether strict social systems theory is really com-\npatible with the strong accent on experience, particularly that of the individual. 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 187\nbe an underlying concept of knowledge, it would be helpful to have a definition\nmaking it explicit.\nThe preceding quotations also hint at a strong option: They all identify knowl-\nedge as information that is relatively organized and that can thus orient perception\nand action. If one adds the concept of data to that approach, a clear structural picture\nemerges:\nData is considered as a coded resource of operations, it is transformed into information\nwhen it is integrated into a relevant context where it makes a difference as a difference, it\ngains relevance and meaning relative to an integrating system. Information is transformed\ninto knowledge when it is integrated into a context of experience. (Fuchs, 2004, par. 11).2\nSuch a model leaves open different possibilities of how information is organized\nand which kind of context is relevant. Following written instructions fits, as does\nemploying individual mind maps in complex social constellations. Of course, both\nthe definition of information and the notion of a context of experience call for fur-\nther explication. As far as necessary, it is given below. But two more principal prob-\nlems should be tackled first. On the one hand, the redundancy of organizing data\ninto information and organizing information into knowledge gives pause. Is it really\nnecessary to draw two distinctions of the same kind? If knowledge should not mean\nonly very dense information (processed in human culture), one needs to spell out the\nspecific ways in which it is organized and becomes operative. On the other hand,\ndistinguishing knowledge from information may involve more than specifying a\ncontext. Semantically, knowledge is characterized by strong cognitive optimism\u2014\nor by the kind of relation to truth that authors like Willke try to dismiss. Although\ninformation may be insufficient or misleading, knowledge is supposed to be about\nwhat is really the case. If someone says that you know and not only reasonably\nbelieve something (e.g., about natural laws, financial markets, the name of a coun-\ntry\u2019s president), she or he means you are right. I try to show how this peculiar trait\nmatters in social analysis. But first and more basically, the question is what it means\nfor the definition of knowledge.\nAt this juncture one naturally turns to philosophy. I leave aside some interesting\nknowledge philosophies of the past, namely, of knowledge as systematic self-\nreflection of a culture (Hegel) or as an elucidation of our being-in-the-world\n(Heidegger). I also refrain from concentrating on the special case of scientific\nknowledge and the philosophy of science. Instead, I consider contemporary debates\nabout knowledge in general, discourses in which reduced ontological claims, pre-\ncise definitions, and aims of wide conceptual extension are to be expected. Sadly,\nmost of these debates turn out to be almost literally footnotes to Plato and not even\nbased on a precise reading of the text. As a result of this discussion, the need for a\nfresh pragmatic account will become discernible.\n2 Fuchs (2004) does not quite agree with the structural outline (which he ascribes to authors such\nas Willke instead)\u2014but only because his own project is a general theory for \u201call self-organizing\nphysical, biological, and social systems\u201d (par. 11). According to Fuchs, attention must thus be\ndrawn to restrictions: \u201c[T]he triad is not data-information-knowledge, but data-knowledge-practi-\ncal knowledge as a manifestation of information in the human realm\u201d (par. 11). 188 T. Reitz\nWhere contemporary philosophers turn to defining knowledge, they almost inev-\nitably start with the classic paradigm: justified true belief. The passages in Plato\nsuggesting this definition of knowledge are found in the dialogues Meno (trans.\n1990) and Theatetus (trans. 1996). In both dialogues, the term epist\u00e9me (knowledge\nor even science) is defined in similar ways:\n\u2022 as met\u00e0 l\u00f3gou aleth\u00e9s doxa, true belief/opinion with reasoning/explanation\n(Theatetus, 201c) and\n\u2022 as orth\u00e9 or aleth\u00e9s d\u00f3xa, correct or true belief/opinion, together with ait\u00edas\nlogism\u00f3s, an account of the reason/origin (Meno, 97b\u201398a).\nIn one of the dialogues, the proposed definition fails; in the other it is accepted.\nWhat is of interest here is only what can be made of them (which actually involves\none additional reference to the argument of Meno). Contemporary debates show\nthat, for example, a narrow Cartesian interpretation is possible. Various authors\naccentuate that only individuals can believe and thus know something, and some\ncommentators even take the degree of belief as decisive: Whoever is not certain is\nno candidate for knowing. I call this stance Cartesian because it makes individual\nconsciousness central. Other scholars, such as the British philosopher Edward Craig\n(1990), have argued that belief does not matter at all (pp. 12\u201317) or have developed\nnotions of group knowledge and belief (see below, section on Social Epistemology\nand Spatial Difference). The whole range of positions, however, leaves the structure\nof the Platonic definition remarkably untouched. This lack of conceptual innovation\nis even clearer from the fact that most discussions have focused on the meaning of\njustified or on the question in which sense reasons turn true belief into knowledge.\nA glimpse of these debates is useful to gain a sense of where the discussion got\nstuck.\nThe main idea of asking what justified means can serve as a starting point: What\nif I entertain a belief that is both justified and true, but only accidentally so?\nExamples and thought experiments relating to this question abound.3 A simple one\nshould be sufficient for my purposes in this chapter. Suppose, for instance, that I\nreasonably believe the refrigerator contains something to drink because I put orange\njuice in. And suppose that there actually is something to drink in there\u2014but not the\njuice I am thinking about, for someone took it out and replaced it with milk without\nmy realizing it. It would thereby not seem correct to say that I know the true state of\naffairs. Different solutions have been proposed, among them creative ones such as\nrecurring to intellectual virtues (which, as virtues, imply success).4 The general pat-\ntern may be derived from the initial question about the role of justification: Justified\ntrue belief that is not just contingently true.\nYet this extended definition is not the only possible solution. Goldman (1999), a\nmain proponent of social epistemology, proposed distinguishing between different\n3 A major part of the debate refers to a short text by Gettier (1963), after whom the said thought\nexperiments are named Gettier-style cases.\n4 A resulting definition reads: \u201cKnowledge is a state of (true) belief arising out of acts of intellec-\ntual virtue\u201d (Zagzebski, 1996, p. 271). 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 189\nkinds or degrees of knowledge instead. In cases of \u201cweak knowledge\u201d (p. 23), true\nbelief alone is sufficient. Reasons hardly matter when I ask, \u201cWho in this room\nknows the capital of Cambodia?\u201d But there are also cases where one insists on hav-\ning \u201cstrong knowledge,\u201d which then has to be qualified by \u201csome additional element\nor elements\u201d (p. 23) \u201csuch as justification or warrant for the belief, and the exclusion\nof alternative possibilities\u201d (p. 23). Goldman even develops a third model of quasi-\ninfallible, \u201csuper-strong knowledge\u201d (p. 23), but he does so mainly to show that\nthere is little or no practical need for such a concept. This argument about context is\nalso what I take to be the message of his account: It is necessary to ask which under-\nstanding of knowledge makes sense in what kind of everyday circumstances.\nFollowing this line, a general critique of the debates in question can be mounted.\nIt is certainly laudable that contemporary philosophers start with everyday language\nand intuitions when they discuss components and definitions of knowledge. But it is\nnot sure that these sources are differentiated enough to pin down the true and exact\nmeaning of a notion that signifies diverse and complex practices. Moreover, the\nusual approach focuses only on a very small segment of the various ways in which\npeople actually talk about knowing and knowledge. An aspect that will turn out to\nbe crucial is that analytic philosophers almost invariably explicate the verb to know\nwhen they want to find out something about the noun knowledge. In a classical\nstudy, for instance, Chisholm (1989) proposed the following \u201cdefinition of knowl-\nedge\u201d (p. 98): \u201ch is known by S = Def (1) h is true; (2) S accepts h; (3) h is evident\nfor S\u201d (followed by an unnecessarily complicated fourth clause) (p. 98).\nUnlike such definitions, everyday language seems to distinguish between verb\nand noun in important respects. Whereas knowing is exclusively attributed to per-\nsons (or, controversially, to quasi subjects like groups or clever animals), knowledge\nmay also be situated in objective media or structures and transpersonal organiza-\ntions. I do not really claim that my computer knows what I wrote during the last few\nyears (even if it has it all stored), but no formal reason keeps me from saying that\nthe knowledge of the National Security Agency (NSA) is frighteningly extensive,\nthat the library of Alexandria housed most of the knowledge of classical antiquity,\nor that Wikipedia increasingly encompasses the basic common knowledge of the\npresent world.\nSuch uses of language do not already imply an alternative definition of knowl-\nedge. They are as useful and potentially misleading as uses of to know are. But if\nthere is no sensible way to decide where to start, it is appropriate to adopt an alterna-\ntive strategy of using common language and practice to derive and test definitions.\nInstead of determining without ambiguity what is meant by one specific way to talk\nabout knowledge and knowing\u2014or, worse, intuitions about both\u2014it would be\ninstructive to ask which set of practices and capacities people typically refer to when\napplying these notions. Marginal cases such as group convictions and tacit or\nimplicit knowledge may remain problematic then, but much is gained when they\ncan at least be related to a core understanding. 190 T. Reitz\nKnowledge as Practice: Keeping Information Available\nA new approach is thus not only desirable but apparent as soon as one specifies how\na pragmatic philosophy of knowledge should proceed. It should not simply identify\nas true what proves useful (although a notion of use will indeed be important). It\nshould ask how people act in contexts in which the concept of knowledge makes\nsense. The strategy just outlined has already been employed by Craig (1990), who\nintroduced an additional reflection to make his point: What is called knowledge can\nbe best constructed in contrast to a sociocognitive state of nature without or before\nit.\nIf what I shall say is along the right lines, the core concept of knowledge is an outcome of\ncertain very general facts about the human situation; so general, indeed, that one cannot\nimagine their changing whilst anything we can still recognise as social life persists. Given\nthose facts, and a modicum of self-awareness, the concept will appear; and for the same\nreasons as caused it to appear, it will then stay (p. 10).\nI do not try to be equally transhistorical. But I do subscribe to Craig\u2019s project to\ndevelop a \u201cprototypical case\u201d (p. 15) or a social core situation of knowledge use by\nspelling out what one could not do without it.\nI am less satisfied with his answer. Craig (1990) constructs only a very basic\noriginal situation of knowledge, and he actively refuses to introduce necessary\nextensions. The basic problem he refers to is that reliable information is needed\nfrom someone else. It is this other person, not some presocial believer, to whom\nknowledge is typically (and prototypically) ascribed. This construction has two\ncomponents. The first is unproblematic, but not sufficient: \u201cTo put it briefly and\nroughly, the concept of knowledge is used to flag approved sources of information\u201d\n(p. 10). What is missing is, again, a specific way to distinguish knowledge from\nmere information, however approved its sources may be. Craig\u2019s way of solving the\nproblem brings in the second component: Although there are many possible sources\nof information, only personal informants are said to have and convey knowledge.\nOnce again, the verb to know is employed to make the distinction plausible, but\nCraig\u2019s text also includes a substantial pragmatic argument: Natural sources of\ninformation and even cultural artifacts cannot cooperate with the seeker of informa-\ntion; other members of her or his epistemic community can. The idea is most inter-\nestingly illustrated by books. Craig explains both why he does not want to attribute\nknowledge in this case and why some notion of knowledge still seems appropriate:\nBooks and the like [are] excellent sources of information, but never, even in the spirit of\nmetaphor, said to know anything\u2026Not that specialist knowledge of any kind is required to\nunravel their secrets\u2014a large part of their point is to provide a perspicuous source, acces-\nsible to anyone with a command of the language they use. But they have none of the psy-\nchology of the prototypical informant: they have no beliefs, they do not act, they are not felt\nto co-operate with us, and they cannot empathise with us so as to anticipate our purposes.\nBesides, they have a special place amongst the sources of information: they are the evidence\nlaid down by creatures that are prototypical informants precisely as the most perspicuous\nvehicle of their information. (p. 38) 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 191\nThis description is fine, but Craig (1990) seems to overlook an obvious conse-\nquence\u2014the human practice of knowledge may require both personal informants\nand storage media like books. The result is that Craig\u2019s prototype adds nothing\nsubstantial to the preconception of knowledge that has already emerged in social\nscience accounts. He, too, could have defined knowledge as information (processed\nin human culture), and he may not even be able to give a satisfying account of cul-\nture. At root, an even vaguer summary seems adequate: \u201cThe human form of life\ndemands good information, and the reliable flow of information. The concept of\nknowledge, along with related concepts, serves those needs\u201d (Greco, 2009, p. 320).\nThis summary includes a minor mistake but it hints at a basic problem. Craig\nprobably did not mix up the concept of knowledge with the practical structures it\ndesignates, but his account seems to lack important practical distinctions. In order\nto see what is lacking, one only has to ask whether the word flow applies equally\nwell to both knowledge and information. As far as I see, both have different practi-\ncal characteristics in this respect. Whereas information is typically transferred (and\nreceived as something new), knowledge is usually kept available over time. For\nexample, one speaks of a flow of information when talking about communication\ntechnology but says that knowledge is kept in books and assembled in libraries.\nEven the information age could produce the sentence, \u201cI store my knowledge in my\nfriends.\u201d It goes without saying that these formulations may all only be manners of\nspeaking and that society has also developed huge infrastructures for storing poten-\ntial information or data. But the idea that it is an essential feature of knowledge to\nbe kept available for future use is consistent with many other characteristics dis-\ncussed so far in this chapter: its higher degree of organization, its versatile employ-\nability, even the semantic connection between knowledge and truth. Above all, I\nthink this idea gives a specific answer to Craig\u2019s question of why there is occasion\nto apply the concept knowledge. It is because there are established practices of\nkeeping correct beliefs or information available over time so that people can ask\ninformants, use cultural sources of information, or just resort to their own mne-\nmonic capacities when necessary.\nBefore I try and condense these initial reflections into a definition, I would like\nto offer my own footnote to Plato, who expressed similar intuitions about knowl-\nedge. When in Meno the question is asked what makes knowledge more valuable\nthan mere true opinion, the answer is that it will not run away; reasons are ties that\nkeep it fixed in the soul (Meno, 98a). One of Plato\u2019s own examples helps show how\nthis image relates to the proposed account. If someone just happens to have a true\nopinion about the way to Larissa, she can give me the right information. But if that\nperson really knows about it (or, even better, about the location of the city), she will\nbe a steady, reliable informant in this respect. This interlocutor will, for instance,\nfirst check whether the place from which I set out is near Athens or near Thessaloniki,\nthen think about roads going northwards or southwards from there, and so on. My\ninformant may, in non-Platonic spirit, even use a map in order to refresh her knowl-\nedge or, as one might also say, have recourse to the cultural knowledge laid down in\nmaps and the like. 192 T. Reitz\nWhich definition can be drawn from this account? First, one needs basic ele-\nments such as the correct, useful opinions, beliefs, statements, or indications that\nfigure in the given examples. As most examined contemporary theories suggest,\ninformation is an adequate term for grasping their common core. In other words, the\nmaterial of knowledge consists of transferrable patterns that enable one to tell some-\nthing about something in the world or that make a difference for operations of\ndiverse systems in a changing environment. These patterns may be sentences\nexplaining a travel route, a bee dance giving directions for collecting pollen, or even\nsubstances transmitting signals in an organism. The more exclusively human char-\nacter of knowledge originates, second, when such information is assembled, inte-\ngrated into a given framework, fixated, and stored for future use (practical or\nepistemic). None of these operations is redundant, but for the sake of brevity, inte-\ngration into frameworks and fixation can be taken as implied in the exercise of\nassembly and structured storage. Most important, all operations are part of one pro-\ncess. They interact in the way information is organized, or reorganized, as a perma-\nnently available structure of orientation. Many versions of this interaction are\nconceivable. Assembling often includes generalizing and subsuming. Both opera-\ntions usually occur within established logical or topical hierarchies. Fixation, too,\ninvolves ordering and aims at facilitating accessibility. Only where such organiza-\ntion takes place do books, experts, and universities, and not merely repositories or\nhard drives, have a role to play. Together, these considerations are sufficient for\nventuring a definition of knowledge:\nKnowledge is information in the condition of being assembled and kept available\nfor future use.\nAs a definition offered in pragmatic spirit, this formulation is open to empirical\nspecification and maybe even substantial amendment. I immediately note the main\nvariable aspects, indicating where I take them to be strengths and where I think\nadditional reflection is needed.\n1. The most obvious and voluntary openness of the proposed definition is that it\ndoes not specify media of knowledge. Information may be assembled and kept\navailable in the minds of people, in cultural artifacts, and in social organizations.\nOne can even argue that artifacts and social cooperation are a necessary part of\nthe knowledge process, for people generally keep information available through\nsymbols. (The person who knows that she put something in the fridge thus turns\nout to be a weak case, comparable to a squirrel that \u201cknows\u201d where it put the\nhazelnut.) This openness about media gives space for research on knowledge\nstructures in the social sciences and humanities. The only restriction is that the\npractice of knowledge implies potential users of information.\n2. What is also left open is the way in which information is actually organized, or\nhow assembling, fixating, and keeping available work together. Maybe further\nreflection could carve out a clear functional scheme in this regard (e.g., a scheme\noriented to the telos of availability), but I rather think that there are culturally and\nhistorically varying possibilities. One paradigmatic context where the concrete 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 193\norganization of permanently available information can be studied is, obviously,\nthe institution of science.\n3. A less visible openness is implied in the perspective from which the definitional\nterms are chosen. As the notion of information exemplifies, they should work\nfrom the inside perspective of cultural participants as well as from an external\nfocus on observable operations and causal relationships. The terms assemble,\nkeep available, and use certainly have a participant bias\u2014but they are nearly\nneutral, allowing for phenomenological, hermeneutic, semantic, and objectivist\nspecification.\n4. Finally, the definition does not systematically include the idea that a language\ncommunity takes knowledge per se to be true. It only suggests why people do so:\nInformation that is kept available for future use is deemed worthy of being kept.\nWhat counts as knowledge, not just as guess, opinion, belief, or conviction in\nintersubjective settings is understandably a stock of preserved, cultivated,\nproven, and tested insights and orientations.5 Whether we\u2014individuals, groups,\ncultures\u2014are right to rely on it is a different question. In some cases we have\nvery reliable clues, sometimes whole cultures turn out to be wrong. Any further\ninquiry would also have to see whether it is really the same kind of reliance in\nwhich they may be wrong. Perhaps the key words episteme, scientia, and knowl-\nedge, or even knowledge, savoir, and Wissen, do not designate the same thing.\nThe last reflection deserves further comment; it brings up problems of relativism.\nTo avoid them, one could add that the information kept available for future use has\nto be correct, or reliable, or even organized as a true account of reality. Yet this cri-\nterion would force strong presuppositions into a mere definition. I prefer to leave\neven this consideration open by referring to the different possible views indicated in\npoint 2, above. A deeper analysis from the participant perspective would have to\nmake sense of several conflicting facts: that people cease to treat beliefs and state-\nments as knowledge when they prove to be untrue, whereas people also know they\nrisk error when they state or believe anything at all; that they disagree with the truth\nprocedures of other cultures and times and yet would not deny that those cultures\nhad knowledge; and so forth. Solutions may be either relativistic or objectivistic.\nFor research in which the observer perspective predominates, however, it is suffi-\ncient to know what counts and functions as knowledge (or something very similar)\nin different sociocultural contexts. Researchers in social science (and epistemology)\ncannot avoid coming back to their own life world, but they do not need to become\nmired in efforts to make it transparent. Moreover, only reaching beyond the horizon\nof one\u2019s inherited language and practices may show just how much relativism is\npossible.\nThe proposed conceptual philosophical reflection thus allows me to come back\nto issues of sociocultural enquiry. This is precisely the desired effect. Yet the\n5 A stronger formulation would be that information is filtered before it is kept: \u201cKnowledge\u2026is the\nconsequence of a filtering process; the process of filtering\u2026facts through the ethical system or the\nintellectual system, or the system of scholarship\u2026of the individual who receives it\u201d (Shera, 1970,\np. 96). 194 T. Reitz\nquestion remains whether a modestly innovative, pragmatic, philosophical defini-\ntion of knowledge changes anything for the empirical disciplines.\nSocial Epistemology and Spatial Difference\nAnother theoretical detour will help find answers. Proponents of social epistemol-\nogy have worked out an account that fits well with the purpose of the proposed defi-\nnition. They, too, wish to avoid restricting the attribution of knowledge to individuals.\nInstead, they situate knowledge in collectives and organizations. In doing so, they\noffer instruments that may help analyze the changing social composition of knowl-\nedge and to advance from definitions of the concept to a discussion of concrete\nconceptions. I introduce three innovations of this sort and discuss their perspectives\nand limits. As already indicated, the main problem that will show up is a lack of\nattention to the cultural media of knowledge and an ensuing space blindness\u2014\nagainst which more extensive sociodiagnostic opportunities will become apparent.\nA difficult, but interesting, point of departure can be found in Gilbert (1994),\nwho is generally concerned with shared intentionality. Specifically, she also assumes\ncollective or group beliefs. According to her, such beliefs surface when a group\nmember expresses a view to which the others presumably (and legitimately) show\nreactions of shocked surprise. All had agreed for a long while that John is an\nunpleasant type, and suddenly Maggie comes up with the remark, \u201cHow nice John\nwas again yesterday!\u201d A group of string-theory researchers sits down for lunch,\nwhen a member sighs, \u201cWhat nonsense this whole string theory is!\u201d Gilbert argues\nthat appalled reactions such as \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d are quite in order here.\nLong-standing agreement (in the first example) and shared practice (in the second\nexample) have produced a kind of obligation not to utter the statements in question.\nSuch obligations may be unpleasant themselves, but they are to some extent\nunavoidable and fulfill basic social functions:\nApart from the general function of providing individuals with a sense of unity or commu-\nnity with others\u2026, the collective beliefs evidently provide points from which people can go\nforward, not forever locked in the back and forth of argumentative conflict. (p. 253)\nI momentarily refrain from evaluating this argument and step right ahead to a\nsecond, more refined account of collective intellectual organization. Whereas\nGilbert\u2019s (1994) model refers only to the most basic practice of knowledge, the\npreservation of belief, this second account is concerned with reasons or collective\nrationality. Pettit (2003) has argued that a genuinely collective combination of ele-\nments of reasoning can often yield better results than is possible with an aggregate\nof complete individual judgments. Judging indeed offers an instructive example.\nTake a legal committee that must decide whether someone is liable for having bro-\nken a contract and whose members separately consider whether there was a valid\ncontract in place to begin with and whether a breach of contract has occurred. The\nresult may be the following distribution of premises and conclusions (Table 11.1). 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 195\nTable 11.1 Individual and collective rationality in a court decision\nJudge Valid contract? Breach? Liability?\n1 Yes Yes Yes\n2 Yes No No\n3 No Yes No\nFrom Pettit (2003), p. 169\nIn this case the majority of complete individual judgments or conclusions speaks\nagainst liability (1:2)\u2014but the sum of premises or basic judgments says the oppo-\nsite (4:2 in favor of liability). So which stance is the more rational one: respecting\nthe integral individual opinions or forming an integral collective judgment? Pettit\n(2003) suggests that comparable cases occur in various spheres of life and that in\nmost cases people choose the strategy of \u201ccollectivizing reason\u201d (p. 176). Moreover,\nif procedures and goals remain constant, collective agents emerge, and under Pettit\u2019s\npremises it really seems rational to be obliged to follow their lead. The elements of\ncollective reason, then, are not integral individual opinions but rather observations,\narguments, and other information cut out of the context of their individual\nprocessing.\nThe model of collective rationality, of course, does not offer a complete concep-\ntion of knowledge. It offers only material for rethinking aspects of knowledge prac-\ntices (affecting the element justified in the standard definition or, in Shera\u2019s (1970)\nterms, the process of filtering information; see footnote 5, above). Most important,\nit says little about how conclusions can be socially stabilized\u2014Pettit (2003) only\nsketchily refers to the concept of the juridical person in Gierke\u2019s (1990)\nGenossenschaftsrecht (law of fellowship). Hence, a third account that explicitly\nintroduces the notion of collective knowledge is welcome. Goldman (2004) pro-\nposed just such an account as an alternative to Pettit\u2019s (2003) collective rationality.\nThe new aspect is the organization of epistemic competencies and epistemic author-\nity. First, Goldman proposes to add that individual judgments may be differently\nweighed. (For instance, the opinion of an experienced doctor counts more than that\nof an apprentice.) As far as I see, this addition is compatible with (maybe even\nenvisaged by) Pettit. What is more interesting is a second nondemocratic consider-\nation, namely, whether an epistemic collective needs persons who are exclusively\nauthorized to define its knowledge and draw consequences. In Goldman\u2019s (2004)\nview, only such an authority structure can explain sentences such as, \u201cWe learned\nsince 9/11 that not only did we not know what we didn\u2019t know, but the F.B.I. didn\u2019t\nknow what it did know\u201d (p. 12).\nHow is it possible that the same entity, in this instance the U.S. Federal Bureau\nof Investigation, knew something and did not know it? Goldman\u2019s (2004) answer is\nthat the organization\u2019s authorities did not realize the threat, so the organization\ncould not react: \u201c[A]t least one Bureau official with appropriate decision-making\nauthority had to receive messages from the various agents, had to believe those mes-\nsages, and had to pool or amalgamate them into a larger pattern\u201d (p. 19). 196 T. Reitz\nThat account may be adequate, but it confounds two different aspects: achieving\nknowledge and drawing practical consequences. On the one hand, one might simply\nask whether knowledge of an imminent threat existed at all somewhere in the orga-\nnization or even at the correct place. Such knowledge could have existed, for\ninstance, because it would have been easy for people to combine alarming observa-\ntions; because at least one agent, with or without authorization, actually brought\ntogether relevant pieces of information; or because a computerized system had\nswitched over to flight-attack alert. On the other hand, this knowledge could have\nled decision-makers to draw consequences or not. In that case a fitting description\nwould be that the FBI knew something but did not react. What remains of Goldman\u2019s\n(2004) account is that epistemic organizations need nodal points where information\nis brought together and theoretical conclusions are arrived at. But these organiza-\ntions need not be so hierarchical that the persons who know and those who decide\nare the same individuals.\nTaken together, the three accounts of social epistemic structures present an inter-\nesting range of possibilities. All may be translated into conceptions of knowledge,\nbut into obviously one-sided ones. In Gilbert\u2019s (1994) case, keeping information\navailable would involve dull conformity pressure, or what Durkheim (1893/1933)\ncalled \u201cmechanical solidarity\u201d (pp. 71\u2013110). In Goldman\u2019s (2004) view, assembling\ninformation seems to be possible only in top echelons of a hierarchy. Even in Pettit\u2019s\n(2003) democratic vision constant socioepistemic unity is tied to a narrow pattern,\ncorporate law.\nHence, two very different conclusions can be drawn. The first is that the nature\nof knowledge heavily depends on its social organization. Whether a collective, a\nperson, or a set of rules decides will affect various aspects like the complexity, gen-\nerality or particularity, and expandability or closure of the information kept avail-\nable. Luckily, real social knowledge is circulating between different organizations\nand is today also structured by other patterns of social order, such as systemic codes\nof communication. But the claustrophobic impression conveyed by the discussed\nparadigms of social epistemology may also be due to another factor, their neglect of\nthe spatial and medial externality of fixated knowledge.\nMore precisely, the second possible conclusion about the effect of social epis-\ntemic structures has to do with the way in which information is stored for later use.\nGilbert (1994), Pettit (2003), and Goldman (2004) all aim at a seat of epistemic\nunity (group belief or obligation, the juridical person, and decision-making author-\nity, respectively). However, information can be kept available for future use in spa-\ntial dispersion as well. A corporation or intelligence agency may have stored its\nknowledge in experts and archives and on tapes and hard drives in various locations,\nand may still have relatively well-organized procedures of reporting and access.\nEven a group of researchers may confidently rely on past publications. Recognizing\nsuch reservoirs immediately reduces social pressure in most of the given examples.\nGilbert\u2019s string theorists could allow each other some free expressions of doubt at\nlunch time; Goldman\u2019s chief officers could leave to others some of the knowledge-\ngenerating work and concentrate on making decisions under difficult circumstances.\nAt the level of theory, the introduction of material infrastructures helps to avoid the 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 197\nsimplistic dichotomy of knowledge as a mere aggregation of individual views and\nthe idea of a completely unified knowledge community.\nCertainly, spatial dispersion also poses problems. In the given context they can\nbe subsumed in a simple principle, capturing the flip side of relaxed social pressure:\nlack of social control. Sometimes reporting procedures fail, leaving the officers in\ncharge little or no chance to bring the knowledge of their organization to bear.\nSometimes the research group falls apart because different members draw different\nconclusions from collective publications. The resulting ambivalence could be a rea-\nson why spatially dispersed knowledge is not very popular in epistemology.\nProponents of anarchist epistemologies like Jacques Derrida are the main (and in\nphilosophy almost the only) ones to show a special interest in this issue.6\nOther theoretical accounts, however, would have reason to follow, for the spa-\ntially enriched approach offers a range of systematic perspectives, not least an\nunderstanding of the way in which media- and communication-technology condi-\ntions epochs of knowledge. It undeniably helps reconstruct traditional settings in\nwhich a whole geography of knowledge centers (from Athens to Paris) and places\nof assembly (archives, libraries, collections, and schools) had to be mastered and in\nwhich new mechanisms of dispersion (e.g., the printing press and an expanding lit-\nerary market) brought about radical change. It can even be used to analyze structural\nchanges of knowledge in an age of ever-improving communication and information\ntechnology, where the epistemic importance of spatial distance is allegedly in\ndecline or at least changing its character. In this context new observations concern-\ning the density of socioepistemic control will also be possible.\nDelocalized and Resituated Knowledge in the Information Age\nI offer a deliberately fragmentary outlook encompassing only two schematic obser-\nvations pertinent to the proposed definition and the spatial structures of knowledge.\nBoth show changes in the organization and dispersion of epistemic practices. I first\nintroduce my observations, then explain and discuss each in turn:\n(a) As the physical location of knowledge loses importance, the social location of\nthe agents and use of knowledge becomes increasingly relevant.\n(b) As the long-standing functional division between information and knowledge\nbecomes partly challenged by information-processing machines, the sociophys-\nical location of stored data partly replaces the traditional geography of\nknowledge.\nPart of assumption (a) is common sense today. An optimistic statement contain-\ning it is, \u201cToday a child anywhere in the world who has Internet access has access\n6 An accessible version of Derrida\u2019s (1996/1998) theory of spatially dispersed knowledge is the\npartly autobiographic essay on monolingualism, where he explained what it means to learn French\nculture in Algeria. For a systematic reconstruction of this theory, see Quadflieg (2007). 198 T. Reitz\nto more knowledge than a child in the best schools of industrial countries did a\nquarter of a century ago\u201d (Stiglitz, 1999, p. 318). This statement is true as far as\naccess to textual sources of knowledge is concerned, and yet it sounds rather na\u00efve.\nThe reason is that Stiglitz is not speaking of the social and cognitive framework that\nhelps one choose the right sources and make sense of them, nor does he mention\npossible contexts of use. Even if the child, by chance or by genius, finds the right\ntrack to develop sophisticated knowledge in genetic engineering, or investment\nbanking, or the construction of microchips, she or he will still need other favorable\nconditions in order to put this knowledge to any use or even make money with it.\nThe ensemble of such conditions\u2014such as nationality, language background, travel\nopportunities, established contacts, educational credentials, and material means\u2014is\nwhat I propose to call (with loose reference to Bourdieu, 1985) the social location\nof the knowledge protagonist. Of course, globalized access to knowledge sources\nwill enable additional people to repair cars, build bombs, or engage in software\nprogramming, but in many cases the limits of their social location will replace the\nformer effects of spatial distance.\nFurther reflection on the economic uses of knowledge shows that social location\nmay even become more important than it has been in industrial capitalism. General\nknowledge that can be technically distributed at little more than zero cost is not well\nsuited as a source of private wealth. Standard economic approaches show that treat-\ning it as a nonpublic good incurs general inefficiencies in both immediate consump-\ntion and the chances of creating further knowledge (Arrow, 1962; Stiglitz, 1999).\nThings look different, however, for the situated knowledge of experts. Tasks such as\nadapting software to a firm\u2019s special needs, installing new microchips in a car mod-\nel\u2019s control system, finding the cheapest possible labor force where supply chains\nare still sufficient, and identifying the passages in U.S. patent law that keep com-\npetitors off the market involve profitable expertise. As the examples suggest, such\nexpertise can be needed either in productive settings or in settings marked by con-\nflicting interests, to the benefit or detriment of general welfare. In both cases, it is\nthe unique social situation of use that determines the structure of valuable knowl-\nedge. In light of the previous discussion, this new impact of social location can also\nbe seen as a factor that tightens social control. Instead of socially overdetermined\nspatial distances, mere social power relations now sort out who can successfully act\nas a knowledge agent.\nAt the same time, reduced generality, or increased sensitivity to individual\ncapacities and specific situations, affect the concept of knowledge itself. The mar-\nginal case is that knowledge is reduced to intransparent expert reputation, or mere\nknowing how to do things at a certain (social) place.7 In rather unspecific and imper-\nsonal settings, other reasons raise the question of whether knowledge is still appro-\npriate as a name. As observation (b) suggests, the old practices of keeping\ninformation available for future use have been duplicated by a process not easily\n7 The examples of knowledge work discussed by Willke (1998), taken mainly from the sphere of\nbusiness consulting, illustrate this aspect. What counts as knowledge in consulting is at least open\nto dispute. 11 Pragmatic Philosophy and the Social Function of Knowledge 199\ncalled knowledge: storing encoded information or data for future operations. The\nrelevant word here is operations, for encoded information is something that one can\nalready find in charts, written calculations, and even books. What is new is that such\ninformation can be automatically processed without the intervention of human\nagents but with huge practical and epistemic effects. Examples are the instances\nwhen stock market programs buy and sell shares, police software identifies danger-\nous persons, and semantic tools browse scientific data bases.\nThe standard definition makes it simple to distinguish the information processed\nfrom knowledge in such cases. The operations in question involve neither beliefs\nnor truth and justification, or do so only in the period when programs are designed.\nPragmatic definitions, too, offer a clear criterion of distinction in that use or context\nof experience imply that human agents participate in the process. Yet I think the\nmore interesting point is that practices of knowledge are really pervaded by pro-\ncesses that make it hard to draw boundaries. A semantic symptom is that the knowl-\nedge economy and society have always been discussed in relation to mere\ninformation.8 That scope proves to be adequate. Human agency is only one of an\nincreasing number of forces that keep information available and intervene in the\nworld accordingly.\nGoals and consequences are still a human and social affair. One of the most\nremarkable effects of the rise of information technology is that the geopolitical loca-\ntion of data storage is gaining new relevance. Although knowledge is spreading ever\nmore widely across the globe, the question of whose territory data are stored on\nplainly matters because the answer determines who will protect them or can compel\naccess to them. In broad theoretical terms, the duality of social control and not com-\npletely controllable spatial dispersion must be complemented by a third dimension:\nstruggles over the control of the spatial infrastructure of information. Such struggles\nhave probably occurred ever since the first clay-tablet reports on crops were assem-\nbled in capital cities, and they continue in the age of the transhuman information\u2013\nknowledge complex.\nConclusion\nTaken together, my sketchy concluding observations convey the thrust of the pro-\nposed definition of knowledge. The intention is to achieve not only conceptual clar-\nity but a renewed empirical view and the chance to explore hitherto unseen\nconnections. This aim can even entail risking the stability of the definition itself or\nrestricting its historical extension. I have highlighted an obvious, but usually omit-\nted, basic function of knowledge in order to escape both restricted and unspecific\n8 The first paradigm was given by Machlup (1962), who simply refused to distinguish between\nknowledge and information (p. 8). Extensive studies of the \u201cinformation economy\u201d have followed\n(Porat & Rubin, 1977), and publications on the \u201cinformation society\u201d have abounded since the late\n1970s. 200 T. Reitz\nuses of the concept. The risk stems from the fact that this very function\u2014keeping\ninformation available for future use\u2014is finding ever more near equivalents in the\nprocessing of information and the storing of data. In the course of the argument,\nhowever, it turned out that this hazard is not the only problem that keeps even social\nphilosophers from leaving traditional epistemology. As soon as the spatial disper-\nsion of knowledge looms, scholars still seem to shrink from addressing gaps in\nsocioepistemic control and from recognizing power struggles that the mind cannot\nmaster.\nReferences\nArrow, K.

Chapter 12\nSemantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning\nand Conceptual Spaces\nPeter G\u00e4rdenfors\nWhat Is Semantic Knowledge?\nWhat is it that you know when you know a language? Certainly, you know many\nwords of the language (its lexicon), and you know how to put the words together in\nan appropriate way (the syntax). More important, you know the m eaning of the\nwords (the semantics of the language). If you do not master the meaning of the\nwords you are using, there is no point in knowing the syntax (unless you are a par-\nrot). You can communicate in a foreign language with some success just by know-\ning some words and without using any grammar. In this sense semantic knowledge\nprecedes syntactic knowledge. This chapter focuses on an aspect of semantic knowl-\nedge that has not been well studied, its organization into domains.\nChildren learn a language without effort and completely voluntarily. They learn\nnew words miraculously fast. Teenagers master about 60,000 words of their mother\ntongue by the time they fi nish high school. In their speech and writing they may not\nactively use more than a subset of the words, but they understand all of them. A\nsimple calculation reveals that they have learned an average of 9\u201310 words p er day\nduring childhood. A single example of how a word is used is often suffi cient for\nlearning its meaning. No other form of learning is so obvious or so effi cient.\nN evertheless, the semantic learning mechanisms show some strong asymme-\ntries. For instance, why is it easier to explain to a 4-year-old the meaning of the\ncolor terms c hartreuse and m auve than to explain monetary terms like infl ation or\nmortgage ? The difference is not a matter of word frequency: The monetary terms\nare more frequent, but the 4-year-old masters the semantic domain of colors and\nthereby knows the meaning of many color words. Adding new color terms is just a\nmatter of learning the mapping between the new words and the color space.\nP. G\u00e4rdenfors (*)\nDepartment of Philosophy , Lund University Cognitive Science , Lund , Sweden\ne-mail: peter.gardenfors@lucs.lu.se\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017 203\nP. Meusburger et al. (eds.), Knowledge and Action, Knowledge and Space 9,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44588-5_12 204 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\nFor example, c hartreuse is a kind of yellowish green, and m auve is a pale violet. On\nthe other hand, the child is normally not acquainted with the domain of economic\ntransactions. To the child, money means concrete things\u2014coins and bills\u2014that one\ncan exchange for other things. Abstract monetary concepts are not within a child\u2019s\nsemantic reach. Grasping a new domain is a cognitively much more diffi cult step\nthan adding new terms to an already established one. Once a domain is common to\na group of potential communicators, various means (e.g., words, gestures, and\nicons) of referring to different regions of the domain can be developed. Conversely,\nif a domain is not shared, communication is hampered. The organization into\ndomains speeds up language learning.\nThis chapter presents a model of such domain-oriented language learning, based\non conceptual spaces. I illustrate the model with some of the semantic domains that\na child acquires during the fi rst formative years of life. I also present linguistic data\nsupporting the hypothesis that semantics knowledge is organized into domains.\nSemantics Based on Conceptual Spaces\nI have proposed conceptual spaces as appropriate tools for modeling the semantics\nof natural language (G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 000 ). A conceptual space is defi ned by a number\nof qualitative dimensions. Examples of perception-based qualitative dimensions are\ntemperature, weight, brightness, and pitch, as well as the three ordinary spatial\ndimensions of height, width, and depth. The dimensions represent perceived simi-\nlarity: The closer two points are within a space, the more similar they are judged to\nbe. In the next section, I present a number of further dimensions that are involved in\ncommunicative processes.\nI argue that properties can be represented as convex regions of conceptual spaces.\nFor example, the color red is a convex region of the three-dimensional color space.\nA concept can thus be defi ned as a bundle of properties combined with information\nabout how the properties are correlated (for a more precise defi nition see G\u00e4rdenfors,\n2000 , p. 105). The concept of an apple, for instance, has properties corresponding\nto regions of color space, shape space, taste space, nutrition space, and other spaces\n(see G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 000 , pp. 102\u2013103, for a more detailed account of this example).\nThe distinction between properties and concepts is useful for analyzing the cog-\nnitive role of different word classes. In G\u00e4rdenfors (2 000) , I proposed that proper-\nties are typically expressed by adjectives, which describe a convex region of some\ndomain such as color, shape, or size. Correspondingly, concepts representing a com-\nplex of properties from a number of domains are typically expressed by nouns.\nG\u00e4rdenfors and Warglien (2 012) extended this analysis to verbs on the basis of the\nmodels of actions and events outlined in the section on Action domain, below.\nBecause the notion of a domain is central to my analysis, I should clarify its\nmeaning. To do so, I draw on cognitive psychology\u2019s notions of separable and inte-\ngral dimensions (see Garner, 1 974 ; Maddox, 1 992 ; and Melara, 1 992 , among oth-\ners). A set of quality dimensions are said to be integral if one cannot assign an object 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 205\na value in one dimension without giving it a value in one or more others. For exam-\nple, an object cannot be given a hue without also giving it a brightness, and the pitch\nof a sound always goes along with its loudness. Dimensions that are not integral are\nsaid to be separable, as is the case with the size and hue dimensions. This distinction\nallows a domain to be defi ned as a set of integral dimensions separable from all\nother dimensions.\nThe notion of a domain has been used to some extent in cognitive linguistics\n(e.g., Croft, 2002 ; Croft & Cruse, 2004 ; Langacker, 1 986 ). Langacker (1 986 ) pre-\nsented his notion of a basic domain as follows:\nIt is however necessary to posit a number of \u201cbasic domains,\u201d that is, cognitively irreducible\nrepresentational spaces or fi elds of conceptual potential. Among these basic domains are\nthe experience of time and our capacity for dealing with two- and three-dimensional spatial\nconfi gurations. There are basic domains associated with various senses: color space (an\narray of possible color sensations), coordinated with the extension of the visual fi eld; the\npitch scale; a range of possible temperature sensations (coordinated with positions on the\nbody); and so on. Emotive domains must also be assumed. It is possible that certain linguis-\ntic predications are characterized solely in relation to one or more basic domains, for exam-\nple, time for [BEFORE], color space for [RED], or time and the pitch scale for [BEEP].\nHowever most expressions pertain to higher levels of conceptual organization and presup-\npose non-basic domains for their semantic characterization. (p. 5)\nL angacker\u2019s notion of domain fi ts well with the one I present. Besides basic domains,\nLangacker also talked about abstract domains, for which identifying the underlying\ndimensions is more diffi cult. In general, though, it seems that the notion of a domain\nwithin cognitive linguistics has a broader meaning than I intend (see G\u00e4rdenfors &\nL\u00f6hndorf, 2 013 , for a narrower use). Croft and Cruse (2 004 , chap. 2), for example,\neven identifi ed domains with frames.\nSemantic Domains Involved in Children\u2019s Development\nLevels of Intersubjectivity\nU sing conceptual spaces as my framework, I now trace the development of semantic\nknowledge in children by identifying and describing the domains that are required\nfor various basic forms of communication. A central hypothesis is that many of\nthese domains are tightly connected to the development of intersubjectivity (also\ncalled t heory of mind) . In this context, I use the term i ntersubjectivity to mean the\nsharing and representing of others\u2019 mentality. Following G\u00e4rdenfors (2 008 ), I break\nintersubjectivity down into fi ve capacities: representing the emotions of others\n(empathy), representing the attention of others, representing the desires of others,\nrepresenting the intentions of others, and representing the beliefs and knowledge of\nothers, an ordering arguably supported by phylogenetic and ontogenetic evidence\n(see G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 003 , 2008 ). These fi ve components are exploited so naturally in\nadult human communication that their importance often escapes attention. 206 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\nEmotive Domain\nT he ability to share others\u2019 emotions is often called e mpathy (Preston & de Waal,\n2 002) . Bodily and vocal expressions of emotion, the most obvious signals among\nthe social animals, communicate the agent\u2019s negative or positive experiences.\nPreston and de Waal argue that most, if not all, mammals are endowed with empa-\nthy (at least in a basic form) as a mechanism linking perception and action.\nThe importance of empathy to interaction highlights the question of how emo-\ntions are represented mentally. Several competing theories on the structure of the\nemotive domain exist. However, most of these theories contain two basic dimen-\nsions: a value dimension on a scale from positive to negative aspects of emotions,\nand an arousal dimension on a scale from calm to excited emotional states (e.g.,\nOsgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1 957; Russell, 1 980 ).1 The Cartesian product of\nthese two dimensions allows a spatial representation of the basic emotions (see Fig.\n1 2.1 ). Distances in emotive space indicate degrees of similarity between emotions.\nI t is well known that emotive intersubjectivity is an important aspect of mother\u2013\ninfant attunement interactions (Stern, 1 985 ). The infant learns the correlation\nbetween different emotions and the corresponding facial and vocal expressions. In\nother words, the child learns how to map behaviors into an emotive space. Sharing\nan emotion means that the participants in the exchange are in emotional states that\nare closely located within the same emotive space. That is, the emotions are attuned.\nSuch coordination of emotions is arguably the most fundamental way of sharing\nmeaning.\nVisual and Physical Domains\nDuring the fi rst months of life, the child learns to coordinate sensory input\u2014\nvision, hearing, touch and smell\u2014with motor activities (Thelen & Smith, 1 994) .\nThis process generates a narrow, egocentric space that basically maps onto her\nor his visual fi eld. The subsequent role of this space in intersubjective engage-\nment is manifested, for example, by the child\u2019s ability, as of 6 months of age, to\nfollow the gaze of the mother if she turns her head to look at an object within\nthe visual fi eld of the child (D\u2019Entremont, 2 000) . From 12 months of age, the\nchild can follow the mother\u2019s gaze if the mother just turns her eyes toward the\nobject (Butterworth & Jarret, 1 991) .\nRepresenting the attention of others means that one can understand when some-\none is looking at some object or noticing some event. As suggested above, even very\nyoung children can understand where other people are looking. Shared attention is\nthe result of two agents simultaneously attending to the same target. It has clearly\n1 Of course, a representation of more nuanced emotions may involve further dimensions. 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 207\nFig. 12.1 A two-\ndimensional emotive space\n(Reprinted from Russell\n(1 980 , p. 1168) with\npermission from the\nAmerican Psychological\nAssociation)\nbeen demonstrated among the great apes (Hare, Call, Agnetta, & Tomasello, 2 000 ).\nA more sophisticated version is drawing joint attention to an object. If I see that you\nare looking at an object, and you see that I see the same object, we have established\njoint attention.\nT he visual domain expands throughout the child\u2019s development. From about 18\nmonths on, a child can follow the gaze of others even if they look at points outside\nits immediate visual fi eld. This ability requires that the represented visual space\nextend beyond the current visual fi eld to cover the entire physical space. The child\ncan now comprehend references outside its visual fi eld. It should be understood that\nthe represented physical space is not just an extension of the visual domain but an\namodal abstraction from visual, auditory, tactile, and perhaps even olfactory\nperceptions.\nA more advanced transformation of the represented space emerges with the abil-\nity to represent an allocentric space, a space seen from the point of view of another\n(Piaget, 1 954) . This transformation involves a shift of perspective. A concrete\nexample is the ability to direct somebody whose vision is obstructed.\nM ore precisely, the domain of physical space should be seen as a combination of\nan allocentric representation of physical space and an egocentric representation pro-\nvided by the visual system. This double aspect of physical space is revealed by the\ntwo linguistic codes established for referring to positions: egocentric l eft and right ,\nand allocentric w est and east (or north and south ). 208 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\nCategory Domain\nO bjects are not only located in physical space; they are also represented in a cate-\ngory domain that has its own quality dimensions (G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 000) . If the physical\ndomain represents where an object is, the category domain represents w hat it is.2\nThe category domain is composed of a number of subdomains, such as color, size,\nand shape.\nAlthough communicative coordination in the emotion and physical domains can\nbe achieved without words, coordination in category space is, at the least, enhanced\nby the use of words. The fi rst fi fty or so words acquired by children are mainly cat-\negory words for perceptually identifi able concrete objects: people, food, body parts,\nclothing, animals, vehicles, toys, and household objects (Fenson et al., 1 994 ). They\nare often used in situations involving the joint attention of the child and an adult.\nHurford (2 007, p. 224) has written that declarative pointing communicates only\nthe location of an object and indicates nothing about its properties. This observation\nmeans that pointing may function without a shared category space having been\nestablished. Parents often scaffold children with words, in a situation of joint atten-\ntion, to provide information about a category domain. As Goldin-Meadow (2 007 )\nand others have demonstrated, children combine pointing with words long before\nthey rely on words alone. The words complement pointing or gaze-sharing and thus\nexpand the possibilities for shared meaning domains in the communicative situa-\ntion. The minds of the communicators meet in two ways: in the visual domain and\nin the category domain. Only later does the child learn words for abstract category\ndomains such as kinship relations or money.\nI t is not well known how category space develops in children. Some cues can be\nobtained from children\u2019s ability to learn nonsense words for new things (Bloom,\n2000 ; Smith, 2009 ). There seems to be a shape bias in that the shape of objects\nseems to be the most important property in determining category membership for\nsmall children (Smith & Samuelson, 2 006 ). Children also overgeneralize concepts\n(Bloom, 2 000 ; MacWhinney, 1 987 ).\nF rom 18 through 24 months of age, children undergo what might be called a\nnaming spurt, acquiring a substantial number of nouns for representing objects.\nEvidence suggests that, during this period, they also learn to extract the general\nshape of objects and that this abstraction helps in category learning (Smith, 2 009 ;\nSon, Smith, & Goldstone, 2008) . One interpretation is that the development of the\nshape domain, as a region of the category domain, strongly facilitates the learning\nof names for object categories.\n2 This distinction mirrors the products of the dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing in the\nbrain. 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 209\nValue Domain\nUnderstanding that others may not have the same desires as oneself requires a rep-\nresentation of value space, one that is detached from other domains. This capacity\ndevelops before the ability to represent the beliefs of others (see Flavell, Flavell,\nGreen, & Moses, 1 990 ; Wellman & Liu, 2 004 ), emerging as a separable domain\nsomewhere between 14 and 18 months of age (Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997) . A rea-\nsonable hypothesis given the empirical data is that children initially consider the\nvalue of an object to be intrinsic to the object, in other words, a dimension of the\ncategory domain, such as color or size. Only later is the value domain separated\nfrom the category domain so that different individuals may be understood as assign-\ning different values to the same object.\nWhereas emotions express how an individual feels, desires express an individu-\nal\u2019s attitudes toward objects, events, and other agents. Because desires are rela-\ntional, representing the desires of others is cognitively more demanding than\nrepresenting their emotions is. One way to represent an individual\u2019s value domain is\nwith a utility function that assigns values appropriately. Other representations exist.\nHowever, I do not discuss the structure of the value domain in this chapter.\nAction Domain\nExperiments on how one perceives the movement of persons and other objects (e.g.,\nGiese & Lappe, 2 002 ; Giese & Poggio, 2 003 ; Johansson, 1 973 ) have suggested that\nthe kinematics of movement contain suffi cient information to identify the underly-\ning dynamic force patterns. Runeson (1 994 , pp. 386\u2013387) has gone further, claim-\ning that one can directly perceive the forces that control different kinds of motion.\nThe process is automatic; one cannot help but see the forces. This capacity seems to\ndevelop early in infancy (White, 1 995 ). Thus, the force domain can be understood\nas a shared domain for purposes of communication.\nI n G\u00e4rdenfors (2 007b) and G\u00e4rdenfors and Warglien (2 012) , that analysis was\nextended to actions and the forces involved in generating those actions. The basic\npremise is that an action can be represented as a pattern of force vectors. The force\npattern for running is different from the force pattern for walking; the force pattern\nfor saluting is different from that of throwing (Vaina & Bennour, 1 985) . Note that\nforces as represented by the brain are psychological constructs and not Newton\u2019s\nscientifi c concept.\nS imilarities between actions should be studied in order to identify the structure\nof the action space. This investigation can be done with the same basic methods as\nthose used for objects. Walking is more similar to running than it is to throwing.\nLittle is known about the geometrical structure of action space. I make the rather\nweak assumption that the concept of betweenness remains meaningful. An action\nconcept can then be characterized, like other concepts, as a convex region, in this 210 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\ncase of force patterns. Unlike other ways of modeling action, this form of represen-\ntation does not require explicit representation of the time domain. Explicit represen-\ntations of time appear to develop comparatively late in childhood.\nL ike other basic domains, forces can be understood metaphorically. Language\noften describes applications of mental force, as when one person threatens or per-\nsuades another. In such cases the term p ower is often substituted for that of f orce\n(G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 007a ; Winter & G\u00e4rdenfors, 1 995 ).\nGoal Domain\nE ven though one can interpret another\u2019s behavior as goal-directed, doing so need\nnot mean that one represents the other\u2019s intention. It is suffi cient to represent the\naction\u2019s goal. Because the human cognitive system takes self-induced motion as a\ncue for goal-directedness, intentions to act are inferred from observed behavior.\nGergely and Csibra (2 003 ) argued that infants do not primarily interpret instrumen-\ntal actions as intentional actions. Instead, they judge them by their effi ciency in\nreaching a goal, perceiving them as a function of the physical constraints of the\nagent\u2019s situation, that is, as obstacles, visual conditions, and so forth. Only later do\nchildren adopt a mentalistic stance, learning to attribute intentions to the actor.\nT herefore, any representation of intentions requires that goals already be repre-\nsented. The goal domain is primary and must be described fi rst. When the agent is\nlocated at a certain physical distance from a desired object, the goal domain can be\nread from the physical domain. Reaching the goal is reaching the location. The dif-\nference is that, in the physical domain, the locations of the agents and objects are in\nfocus, whereas in the goal domain, the focus is on the distances between them. In\nthis example the goal domain is the space of force vectors that extend from the ini-\ntial to the desired location. When the goal is represented in this way, two principal\nways of obtaining the goal arise. One is that the agent moves to the goal location and\ngrasps the object. The other is that the agent uses imperative pointing, so that another\nindividual brings the object to the agent.\nG oal domains can be more abstract than force vectors in the physical domain. In\nprinciple, goal vectors can be defi ned in all kinds of semantic domains. If I want the\nwall to be painted purple, my goal is to change its color from the current location in\nthe green part of the color domain to the desired location in the purple region. Goal\nspaces are represented as abstract spaces in economics, cognitive science, and arti-\nfi cial intelligence. The classic example from artifi cial intelligence is Newell and\nSimon\u2019s (1 972) General Problem Solver. I suggest that these spaces are generated\nby metaphorical extensions from the original physical space and thus always main-\ntain the key notion of distance. This hypothesis is supported by the pervasiveness of\nspatial metaphors in relation to goals, as in \u201che reached his goal,\u201d \u201cthe goal was\nunattainable ,\u201d \u201cthe target was set t oo high \u201d (see also Lakoff & Johnson, 1 980 ).\nConsider next the problem of representing intentions. The basic premise is that\nthe intention domain can be seen as a product of the goal domain and the action 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 211\ndomain.3 An intention is thus a combination of a goal and a planned action con-\nceived of as leading toward that goal. Take the difference between blink and wink .\nA blink is an often unintentional action, a pattern of forces exerted on the muscles\naround the eye. By contrast, a wink is an i ntentional action combining the action of\nblinking in order \u201cto awaken the attention of or convey private intimation to [a]\nperson\u201d (C oncise Dictionary , 1 911 ).4\nEvent Domain\nThe most advanced test for intersubjectivity in humans or other animals is designed\nto fi nd out whether they can represent what others believe or know. The most com-\nmon method for evaluating this capacity is the false-belief test (e.g., Gopnik &\nAstington, 1 988; Mitchell, 1997; Perner, Leekam, & Wimmer, 1987) . It is generally\naccepted that this capacity develops in children during their fourth year.\nWellman and Liu ( 2004 ) have argued that children can represent other persons\u2019\ndiverse beliefs before they can judge false beliefs. They found that many 3-year-\nolds who cannot pass false-belief tests can still correctly answer a target question\nconcerning an agent\u2019s belief that is opposite from their own; it seems they under-\nstand that people\u2019s actions are infl uenced by diverse beliefs. Language profi ciency\nin children is correlated with their ability to pass the false-belief test (Astington &\nJenkins, 1 999) . In particular, parental use of mental predicates in their child-directed\nspeech is correlated with their children\u2019s performance in false-belief tests (de\nVilliers & Pyers, 1 997 ) .\nW hat is involved semantically in representing the beliefs of others, as in knowing\nthat somebody has a false belief? Beliefs are normally expressed as propositions.\nSo, how is the meaning of propositions related to semantic domains?5 One possibil-\nity is that most simple propositions express events. In G\u00e4rdenfors and Warglien\n( 2012 ), we modeled an event in terms of two vectors: a force v ector , which typically\nrepresents an action performed by an agent, and a result vector, which describes a\nchange in the location or properties of a patient. 6 Consequently, the event domain is\ncognitively more complex than other domains.\nGiven this model, one may reasonably speculate that understanding the beliefs of\nothers requires understanding their representation of events. If this conjecture is\n3 Product is meant in the mathematical sense. The intention domain is that product space generated\nfrom the goal domain (a vector space) and the action space (derived from the space of forces).\n4 A s I show in the following section, this model of intentions is the same as the model of events\u2014\nexcept that the action involved in an intention is only planned. This analysis fi ts well with Gergely\nand Csibra\u2019s (2 003 ) proposal that one infers the intentions of a person from the beliefs and desires\none attributes to that person.\n5 Cognitive semantics has traditionally not handled propositions well.\n6 T he event domain can thus be expressed as the product space of the action domain and either the\nphysical or the category domain (see intentions). 212 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\ncorrect, it is no wonder that understanding the beliefs of others develops rather late\nin childhood. Consider Nelson (1 996 ), who showed how the use of the word know\ndevelops over time in children and does not achieve its ordinary meaning until after\nchildren can pass the false-belief test.\nT his section has identifi ed a number of semantic domains needed for children\u2019s\ncommunication. Several are based on the different possible levels of intersubjectiv-\nity. I have outlined how these domains can be represented with the aid of conceptual\nspaces. Because independent semantic evidence suggests that the domains are nec-\nessary for modeling basic meanings, their connection to intersubjectivity can be\nused as a stepping stone to an analysis of the development of semantic knowledge.\nSome Linguistic Evidence of Semantic Domain Knowledge\nA central thesis of this chapter is that the semantic domains, as structured by con-\nceptual spaces, form an important part of semantic knowledge. In this section I\npresent linguistic evidence that the development of semantic knowledge can appro-\npriately be described as the development of separable semantic domains.\nI n the analysis of child language data, the establishment of a word in the vocabu-\nlary of children is often analyzed for the average frequency of the word\u2019s usage at a\ncertain age.7 Typically, the frequency of a word\u2019s usage starts at or close to zero,\nincreases rapidly, then levels off once the word is established in the vocabulary.8 The\nresulting curve thus has an S shape. I hereafter call the interval during which usage\nincreases rapidly the e stablishment period for a word.\nI can now formulate a general hypothesis concerning semantic domains: If one\nword from a domain is learned during a certain establishment period, then other\n(common) words from the same domain tend to be learned during roughly the same\nperiod. In order to test this hypothesis, I have analyzed data from the Child Language\nData Exchange System (CHILDES) corpus and have used the publicly available\nweb-based ChildFreq application, a highly effi cient tool for such investigations.9\nIn this chapter I can present only a few examples from my analysis.\nFor most of the domains discussed in the previous section, words are established\nduring the language spurt that takes place between 12 and 24 months of age. This\nobservation holds in particular for the different regions of the category domain. For\nexample, consider the region of fruits, part of the category domain. Figure 12.2\nshows the frequency curves for the names of several of the most common fruits:\napple , b anana , pear , g rape , and o range . These words have an establishment period\n7 An alternative to using age as the independent variable is to consider the general linguistic com-\npetence of the children, often measured in terms of an utterance\u2019s mean length (number of words).\n8 In fact, a word\u2019s usage usually shows a slow decline, in part because the need for any particular\nword decreases as more words are learned.\n9 ChildFreq was developed by Rasmus B\u00e5\u00e5th. It is available at h ttp://childfreq.sumsar.net/ 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 213\nFig. 12.2 T he establishment periods for some common fruit words (Reprinted from G\u00e4rdenfors\n(2 014 , p. 67) with permission from MIT Press)\nbetween 12 and 18 months of age. Orange is something of an exception, probably\nbecause it is also used within the color domain.\nThere are some domains for which the words are clearly established later. One\nsuch domain is that relating to life and death. Figure 1 2.3 shows that the establish-\nment of the words l ive , die , alive, and dead occurs mostly between 30 and 42 months\nof age.\nAnother example is the domain relating to knowledge and memory. Figure 12.4\nshows the frequency curves for the words b elieve , remember , forget , and guess . In\nthis case the establishment period occurs between 36 and 54 months of age. Note\nthat these words concern an individual\u2019s relation to facts and thereby relate to the\nevent domain (see the immediately preceding section). Furthermore, the period\ncoincides with the one during which children learn to pass the false-belief tests.\nA fi nal example from ChildFreq concerns the levels of intersubjectivity (see the\nsection on Levels of Intersubjectivity, above). It is diffi cult to fi nd a clear correspon-\ndence between these levels and the learning of particular words. However, I have\nchosen the verb l ook as an indicator of understanding the attention of others; and the\nverbs w ant to and wanna as indicators of understanding desires; g oing to and gonna\nas indicators of understanding intentions; and k now , think, and b elieve (the latter 214 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\nFig. 12.3 The establishment periods for some words from the \u201clive\u201d domain (Reprinted from\nG\u00e4rdenfors (2 014 , p. 68) with permission from MIT Press)\ntwo combined into one category) as indicators of understanding belief and knowl-\nedge (see Fig. 1 2.5 ).1 0\nFigure 12.5 suggests that the sequence of the establishment periods conforms to\nthe one I proposed in G\u00e4rdenfors ( 2008 ). An analysis of the uses of these words in\ndifferent contexts is required in order to establish the connection with intersubjec-\ntivity more clearly than I have in this chapter. Note that know , t hink, and believe do\nnot quite follow the usual S shape. Their trajectories may partly be explained by the\nmany idiomatic uses of these words, which make their frequencies increase at a rate\nmore constant than that of other words. Although I can present only a limited num-\nber of examples in these pages, it should be clear that my hypothesis on establish-\nment periods is rich in empirically testable predictions. I invite corpus linguists and\nchild development researchers to continue testing it.\nFurther evidence of the domain called organization of semantic knowledge is the\nway that metaphors do not come alone. Lakoff and Johnson (1 980 ) convincingly\nargued that metaphors are organized around schemas such as \u201cargument is war,\u201d\n\u201ctime is a resource,\u201d and \u201cmore is up.\u201d I have proposed that a metaphor expresses an\n10 It is diffi cult to identify any expression that corresponds to understanding emotions (empathy),\nfor this capacity develops well before words are learned. 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 215\nFig. 12.4 T he establishment periods for some words from the \u201cknowledge\u201d domain (Reprinted\nfrom G\u00e4rdenfors (2 014 , p. 69) with permission from MIT Press)\n\u201cidentity in topological or geometrical structure between different domains\u201d\n(G\u00e4rdenfors, 2 000, p. 176). That is, a word that represents a particular structure in\none domain can be used as a metaphor to express the same structure in another\ndomain. Once a metaphor has established such a mapping, it can be exploited to\nprovide other metaphors from the same domain.\nA n example of such a mapping is the designation of certain computer programs\nas v iruses . This metaphor drawing on the biological domain has created a new way\nof looking at this class of programs. It has suddenly opened up possibilities for\nexpressions like i nvasive viruses, v accination programs, and hard-disk\ndisinfection .\nConclusion\nI n the tradition of Chomskian linguistics, learning a language is learning its syntax.\nBy the same token, one does not know a language unless one knows the meanings\nof the words that one uses. In this chapter I have illustrated some key aspects of how\ncognitive structure constrains the learning of semantic knowledge. The central 216 P. G\u00e4rdenfors\nFig. 12.5 The establishment periods for some verbs related to stages of intersubjectivity (Reprinted\nfrom G\u00e4rdenfors (2 014 , p. 70) with permission from MIT Press)\nthesis is that semantic knowledge is structured by domains defi ned as sets of inte-\ngral dimensions. This understanding of domains can be used to analyze semantic\ndevelopment in children. I have presented the central domains involved in children\u2019s\ncognitive development, in particular with respect to their development of intersub-\njectivity. I have offered some linguistic evidence supporting the hypothesis that it\nbecomes easier to learn new words within a domain once it has been established.\nAcknowledgements I gratefully acknowledge support from (a) the Vagueness, Approximation,\nand Granularity (VAAG) project coordinated by the Zentrum f\u00fcr Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft\nand funded by the European Science Foundation framework LogiCCC, (b) the Swedish Research\nCouncil for support under a Senior Individual Grant, and (c) the Linnaeus environment Thinking\nin Time: Cognition, Communication and Learning. 12 Semantic Knowledge, Domains of Meaning and Conceptual Spaces 217\nReferences\nAstington, J., & Jenkins, J.

Chapter 13\nSo What Do You Do? Experimenting\nwith Space for Social Creativity\nAriane Berthoin Antal and Victor J. Friedman\nDirect experience comes from nature and man interacting with\neach other. In this interaction, human energy gathers, is\nreleased, dammed up, frustrated and victorious. There are\nrhythmic beats of want and fulfillment, pulses of doing and\nbeing withheld from doing.\n(Dewey, 1934/2005, p. 1)\nAs John Dewey (1934/2005) observed \u201cthe first great consideration is that life goes\non in an environment; not merely in it but because of it, through interaction with it\u201d\n(p. 12, italics in original). It is puzzling that although organizational scholars may\nagree with him, they have not agreed on how social and physical space interact.\nResearchers who consider it problematic that \u201cmost previous research assumes that\nspatial orderings of things and people are merely part of the background\u201d (Edenius\n& Yakhlef, 2007, p. 207) have been exploring space in organizations from different\nangles. Some authors are very critical of the passive role assigned to space: \u201cTo\npicture space as a \u2018frame\u2019 or container with no other purpose than to preserve what\nhas been put in it is an error displaying traces of Cartesian philosophy\u201d (Kornberger\n& Clegg, 2004, p. 1101). However, there is a risk that analysts attempting to redress\nthe balance sometimes attribute such great powers to space as to anthropomorphize\nit and thereby relegate its inhabitants to the status of pawns of masterbuilders (e.g.,\nKornberger & Clegg, 2004). Our contention is that a clear conceptualization of the\nrelationship between physical and social space is critical for understanding the\nactions people undertake in their present setting and envisage for the future.

Friedman\nobjective in this chapter is to deepen our understanding of the relationship between\nspace and the generation of knowledge through and for action.\nTheoretical Framework\nSome work has been done in this direction (Baldry, 1999; Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007;\nFord & Harding, 2004; Friedman, 2011; Kornberger & Clegg, 2004; Meusburger,\n2009; Taylor & Spicer, 2007; Woodward & Ellison, 2010). A review of the growing\nliterature on space in organization studies found the field fragmented but identified\nthree principal streams, each with interesting contributions and shortcomings (Taylor\n& Spicer, 2007). In one stream scholars conceive of space in terms of distance and\nproximity between points and have convincingly demonstrated how space makes a\ndifference for important issues at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. However, they\nare \u201cunable to account for the ways in which actors attribute meaning and signifi-\ncance to a space \u2026 [and] not able to explain the role which perceptions or experi-\nences of distances and proximity play\u201d (p. 329). In another stream researchers\ncompensate for this weakness by focusing on the materialization of power\u2014but it is\nquestionable \u201cwhether all spaces are necessarily manifestations of power\u201d (p. 332).\nFurthermore, such a focus implies a \u201csystematic disregard of the ways that space\nmay actually be the product of inhabitants\u2019 ongoing experience and understandings\u201d\n(p. 333). Scholars in the third stream attend to this gap by exploring \u201chow spaces are\nproduced and manifest in the experiences of those who inhabit them\u201d (p. 333). The\ninherent disadvantages are that power relations are overlooked and that the emphasis\non perception undervalues the material, physical aspects of space. Logically, there-\nfore, Taylor and Spicer argue for an integrated approach that addresses all three\ndimensions by building on the ideas of Lefebvre (1974/1991), who sought to bring\ntogether mental, physical, and social modalities of space (see also Ford and Harding\n2004, p. 817). Although we agree that an integrated approach is needed, this particu-\nlar proposal does not take some essential concepts into account.\nStrikingly absent from the organizational literature on space is the work on social\nspace by two of the twentieth century\u2019s most influential, and nonconventional,\nsocial scientists, the psychologist Kurt Lewin (1936, 1948/1997, 1951/1997) and\nthe sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1985, 1989, 1993, 1998; Bourdieu & Wacquant,\n1992). Both placed social space as the cornerstone of their theoretical and method-\nological work, turning to the philosophical work of Ernst Cassirer (1923/1953,\n1944, 1961), who conceived of space in rather relative terms as the positional qual-\nity of the material world. Cassirer, Lewin, and Bourdieu adopted the view that there\nis no empty space, only spaces that are formed by and between objects, and they\napplied this concept to the creation of social reality rather than to the physical world.\nAt the heart of social space is a relational logic of social reality, which focuses nei-\nther on the individual nor the group as the unit of analysis but rather on the pro-\ncesses through which individuals, in interaction with others, construct their social\nspaces and identities (Friedman, 2011). These interactions are causal loops that link\nthe ways people bring their thinking and feeling into the world through action, to 13 So What Do You Do? 223\nother people\u2019s responses generated by those actions, and back again to the ways\nthose responses are interpreted and to the ways they shape what people think, feel,\nand do. Cassirer (1961) depicted with special eloquence the recursive movement\nbetween thinking, feeling, and acting in space as a process of creating and experi-\nencing possibilities: \u201cHuman action is known only in its realization; only when it is\nrealized are we aware of its living possibilities\u2026. [I]ndeed, its work is precisely that\nof seeking and creating ever new possibilities\u201d (p. 37).\nSocial spaces take shape when these interactions between people are sustained\nand acquire patterns that differentiate them and give them distinctive configurations.\nEach configuration of social space can be characterized by its constituents, the posi-\ntions they hold relative to each other, the \u201crules of the game\u201d that govern interaction,\nand the shared meanings that hold the space together and facilitate sustained inter-\naction (Friedman, 2011). Hence, social space is a creation of the mind, a construct\nthat can be used to think relationally about the physical or the social world and\nthereby provide a means for making order out of any given set of elements. Both\nLewin and Bourdieu applied these basic ideas to the study of society and culture at\nevery level of aggregation.\nA problem with the conceptualization of the construction of social space thus far\nis that it has not attended to the physical dimensions of the process: humans with\nbodies interacting in physical spaces that also include objects. We propose to inte-\ngrate the physical environment in this construction process by seeing space and\nobjects as being in relation with people rather than by allotting them a separate\nontological status as containers that hold, and influence, social behavior. The rela-\ntion is created by the multiple senses with which humans experience the physical\nenvironment. Whereas the importance of bodily ways of knowing has been obvious\nto artists and neuroscientists (Lehrer, 2007), organizational researchers misplaced\ncorporeality for many years and have only recently begun to retrieve it by drawing\non notions of aesthetics (Linstead & H\u00f6pfl, 2000, p. 3). The literature review cited\nabove noted the emergence of this work in their third strand, though too narrowly,\nso we mine it further in this chapter.\nScholars seeking to bring the body back into the picture point out that \u201calthough\nan organization is indeed a social and collective construct\u2026, it is not an exclusively\ncognitive one but derives from the knowledge-creating faculties of all the human\nsenses\u201d (Strati, 2000, p. 13). The aesthetic approach to studying human behavior\nreveals the roles the body plays in reading a context, first to make sense of it because\n\u201cone of the first things a newcomer to any organization has to learn is how to navi-\ngate within this new spatial environment\u201d (Baldry, 1999, p. 535). The newcomer\nmakes \u201ca prima facie aesthetic judgment\u201d (Hein, 1976, p. 149) in defining the rela-\ntional composition of a situation. People use all their senses to seek cues to make\nsense of and orient their behavior, and when the interaction occurs in a built physi-\ncal space they orient themselves to the fixed factors (the structure, the walls, and the\nfloor) and the semifixed factors, such as furniture and other movable objects\n(Rapoport, 1982). The body thereby also participates in deciding and signaling to\nothers which rules of the game to adopt for the situation at hand. Researchers have\nshown \u201chow bodily practices produce discourse in the form of rules, routines, and\nprocedures\u201d (Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007, p. 195). 224 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nConnecting aesthetic approaches to the analysis of the construction of social\nspace therefore enriches the understanding of the relational processes of generating\nshared meaning and agreeing on how to behave in the current situation. Furthermore,\nthe aesthetic dimension of experience plays a role in defining the scope for future\nsocial space because it has the \u201ccapacity to animate actors\u2019 imaginations and\nactions\u201d (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 46).\nIn this chapter we use this integrated relational conceptualization of social and\nphysical space to analyze data from a series of action experiments we organized in\n2009 in Israel. We invited people in small mixed groups to explore together how to\nenvisage a future social space in the same setting. We consciously intensified atten-\ntion to the aesthetic dimension of the process from the outset by choosing a fine-arts\nstudio as the setting and by providing art materials for the participants to use there,\nsharing the assumption that \u201ccreative activity with portable, discrete objects allows\nan extension of potential space\u201d (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 50). For this chap-\nter we have decided to apply an aesthetic approach to the data analysis by focusing\nonly on the visual documentation in order \u201cto avoid committing the cognitive and\nrational error of ignoring the bodies of the people involved in the decision process\nand only considering their minds\u201d (Strati, 2000, p. 20). Our objective is, therefore,\nto explore how much one can learn about processes of constructing current and\nfuture social space, in which physical relations are integrated, by including aesthetic\ndimensions of the experience in the analysis.\nThe next section of the chapter describes the context in which we conducted the\naction experiments. It is followed by an explanation of the methodology that was\nused to collect and analyze the data. We then present an analysis of the sessions, in\nwhich we identify different configurations that evolved during the interactions of the\nparticipants with one another and with the physical aspects of a studio. In the final\nsection of the chapter, we present our conclusions about how to conceptualize and\nanalyze social and physical space in an integrated manner and suggest next steps.\nContext: The Studio for Social Creativity\nThe stimulus for carrying out this study was the development of the Studio for\nSocial Creativity at the Max Stern Jezreel Valley College in Israel, a college created\nto bring higher education to Israel\u2019s northern periphery (Friedman & Desivilya,\n2010). This region is characterized by chronic socioeconomic underdevelopment\nand deep intergroup divisions, especially between Jews and Palestinian Arabs.1\nVictor and several other faculty members at the college were interested in\n1 The Israeli population is composed of approximately 80 % Jewish and 20 % Palestinian Arab citi-\nzens. This Palestinian population should be distinguished from Palestinians who live in the\nOccupied Territories\u2014the West Bank (Samaria and Judea) and Gaza\u2014and are not Israeli citizens.\nThe Arab citizens of Israel are termed by different people in various ways, such as Arabs, Israeli\nArabs, and Palestinians. Each of these terms has a political implication. 13 So What Do You Do? 225\nFig. 13.1 The Studio for Social Creativity, Max Stern Jezreel Valley College, Israel (Photograph\nby the authors)\npromoting a process in which people from the region could (a) bring up problems,\nideas, and visions, (b) meet others with whom to learn and collaborate on issues of\ncommon concern, (c) work together to create innovative, viable projects and enter-\nprises to meet human and economic needs, and (d) create and enact shared visions\nof regional development that promotes inclusiveness and interdependence rather\nthan competition and divisiveness.\nThe original idea was to create a unique kind of incubator that would stimulate\nsocial entrepreneurship (Friedman & Sharir, 2009), a process that would also\ninclude conflict engagement because the tensions in the region severely restrict the\ndevelopment of social capital needed for social entrepreneurship (Friedman &\nArieli, 2011; Friedman & Desivilya, 2010). The idea of bringing in the arts to sup-\nport the learning process was stimulated by Ariane\u2019s research on various forms of\nartistic interventions as triggers for organizational learning (Berthoin Antal, 2009,\n2012, 2013, 2014) and by our joint reflections on how to benefit from working with\nthe arts in action research (Brydon-Miller, Berthoin Antal, Friedman, & Gay\u00e1\nWicks, 2011).\nSerendipitously, Victor discovered on the college campus a little-used fine-arts\nstudio, which had originally been the backstage area of a theater. He immediately\nexperienced it as a space that offered powerful creative potential and decided that\nthe studio metaphor as the environment in which to nurture innovative social think-\ning and action was much more appealing than the incubator metaphor, especially if\npeople, practices, and products from the world of the arts could be integrated into\nthese processes. The studio\u2019s large rectangular shape (approximately 16 m long and\n12 m wide, or about 52\u02b9 \u00d7 39\u02b9) offered an open, flexible space (see Fig. 13.1). A high 226 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nceiling contributed to the sense of spaciousness. The windows were set along the\ntop of one of the long sides of the room, and the shorter sides each had a narrow\nbalcony, accessible by narrow steep staircases. The stained linoleum floor showed\nsigns of years of use. Water was available from a faucet in a washbasin.\nTwo critical questions needed to be clarified in order to launch the Studio for\nSocial Creativity: What does it mean, in practice, to integrate processes of social\nentrepreneurship, conflict engagement, and the arts? How could the studio space be\nutilized to host and facilitate these processes? Having read the conceptual paper\nVictor had written with his colleague (Friedman & Desivilya, 2010), Ariane sug-\ngested interrupting the writing process to actually engage with potential stakehold-\ners\u2014social entrepreneurs, experts on conflict, activists, artists, college faculty, and\nstudents\u2014in the studio. Adapting Frye\u2019s (1964) succinct definition of imagination\nas \u201cthe power of constructing possible models of human experience\u201d (p. 22), we\nobserved that the discovery of the studio on campus offered the space for experi-\nmenting with imagination in practice. The stakeholders could be invited to\nparticipate in constructing possibilities for using the space for social innovation and\nfor strengthening the link between the college and the community.\nMethod: Action Experiments\nThe first step was to identify people in the college and in the community who we\nthought would be interested in participating in what we called a series of action\nexperiments. By this term we meant asking participants to develop and actively try\nout ideas together in a given space, recording the process, then analyzing it as a\nbasis for ensuing steps. We use the term experiment in this chapter only to imply an\nexploratory learning-by-doing\u2014trying something out in order to see what happens.\nWe do not mean it here in the sense of a laboratory experiment, which implies both\nclear predictions about what should happen and a high degree of control so as to\npermit a clear linkage between cause and effect. In this case the action experiments\nentailed bringing mixed groups to explore what the Studio for Social Creativity\ncould be in future. Victor approached each person personally and afterward sent a\nbrief written description of the studio and the experiment. The text also explained\nthat the sessions were to be filmed as a basis for development of and research on the\nstudio. We organized five sessions in June 2009, distributing the 18 volunteers so\nthat each session included participants with experience in social entrepreneurship,\nconflict engagement, and the arts, as well as both Jews and Palestinian Arabs, and\nmen and women.2 The size of the groups varied from five to nine people, including\nthe researchers. Although some of the participants knew each other, each mix\nincluded one or more people they did not know, so none of the sessions had groups\n2 We also held a sixth session but do not report on it here because it was quite different in format.\nIt encompassed 60 students from the nursing program in the college, for whom the participants of\nSession 2 planned an intervention in the studio. 13 So What Do You Do? 227\nwhose members all had experience working together. In other words, each set of\nparticipants entered what was for them a new space with a new group and a new\ntask.\nThe research team consisted of three people: the two authors and the cameraman,\nwho was a drama student and the son of one of the authors. The members of the\nresearch team did not define themselves as facilitators or observers standing outside\nthe experiment but rather interacted with the participants and took part in the think-\ning and action processes that unfolded. Victor participated fully in each session.\nBecause Ariane did not speak Hebrew, the nature of her participation varied depend-\ning on whether the session was held in Hebrew (Sessions 2 and 4) or English\n(Sessions 1, 3, and 5). The cameraman filmed all of the sessions in the red-nose\nmask from the world of theater. He felt it would greatly enhance his ability to look\non the action with curiosity and openness. By definition there was no language bar-\nrier for the cameraman: The Nose does not speak; it communicates with eyes and\nthe rest of the body. As it turned out, the Nose also became part of the studio, signal-\ning to participants as soon as they arrived that it was an unconventional place in\nwhich playfulness was allowed.\nOur hope was that the participants would generate an output that would articulate\ntheir ideas in ways that could be observed, recorded, and shared with others. We\nalso hoped that the participants would not only interact verbally but also use the\nroom and art materials in some process of thinking and acting together. At the same\ntime, we wanted to leave things as open as possible rather than impose a particular\nprocess on the participants. Our intention was to maximize the probability of gener-\nating newness. As Stark (2009) pointed out, \u201cspaces of ambiguity\u201d (p. 3) are impor-\ntant when the challenge is to generate newness by integrating knowledge from\ndifferent domains. Prior to the experiment, we therefore defined for ourselves a\nnumber of principles that guided our behavior as conveners and researchers.\n\u2022 Allow the participants to be as self-organizing as possible in their use of the\nspace, their interactions with each other, their use of the resources, and the topics\nand issues they choose to discuss.\n\u2022 Bring the participants\u2019 knowledge together on as equal a footing as possible.\nAlthough we were keenly interested in seeing how art might contribute to this\nprocess, we did not privilege the artists, nor any of the other participants, by\nexplicitly attributing to them the status of experts, facilitators, or leaders.\n\u2022 Set a clear time frame (2 h maximum). Aside from practical considerations, our\nresearch on artistic interventions sensitized us to the fact that time constraints\ncan stimulate groups to reach higher levels of performance than the participants\nhad previously considered achievable.\nBy choice, we wanted to allow each group to develop its own approach, so the gen-\neral principle we followed was \u201ctrust the process\u201d (McNiff, 1998).\nThe studio was sparsely furnished with art equipment: easels, stools, folding\nchairs, a platform (probably for a model), a spotlight, and a ladder. Each time we\narrived in the studio these furnishings were already distributed around the room in\nno given order, and we did not arrange them for our participants. The walls were 228 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nbare, except in one case, where balloons had been left hanging by the previous occu-\npants. After each of our sessions, we removed whatever work had been produced so\nthat it would not influence the participants in the subsequent session. Building on\nthe artful-listening approach with which Ariane had been experimenting to support\nreflection and expression in groups, we bought materials (e.g., oil pastels, finger\npaints, plasticene, scissors, glue, a bell, a beach ball, and different kinds and sizes of\npaper) for the participants to play with during the sessions. Experiments in seminars\nAriane had conducted had shown that people often reported that their listening was\nenhanced when they occupied their hands with other forms of expression. We placed\nthe materials on the low platform, which was at the middle-front of the room.3 The\nparticipants were also invited to bring with them materials or tools they typically\nuse in their practice. Only the musician in Session 1 took up this offer, bringing two\nmusical instruments (an oud and a recorder).\nWe invited the participants in each session to meet in Victor\u2019s office and then walk\ntogether across campus to the studio so that they would begin the experiment\ntogether. The cameraman waited at the studio entrance to greet them as they arrived.\nOnce everyone had entered the studio, we briefly explained the background to the\nexperiment: the idea of the Studio for Social Creativity and how it had originated, the\nhistory of the space itself, the participants\u2019 task, and the guidelines. After this intro-\nduction we suggested that the participants explore the space for themselves, encour-\naging them to take the initiative and engage in the task without our guidance.\nData Analysis\nWe have undertaken several modes of analysis of the action-experiment sessions in\nthe studio since conducting them in 2009. The first mode was simultaneous with the\nprocess\u2014we discussed each experience intensely together and with the cameraman,\nexchanging thoughts and feelings about what was surprising, disappointing, or\ndelighting us. The second was a preliminary review of the results based on tran-\nscripts we made of the recorded material, which we presented at a conference a\nmonth later (Berthoin Antal & Friedman, 2009). As interesting as that material was,\nhowever, we soon realized that we, like other colleagues, had \u201cfallen prey to the\ndominant approach to studying organization, by relying on discursive material\u201d\n(Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007, p. 209). We had in our hands the pictorial material those\ncolleagues yearned for after the fact, but we had focused on the written words we\nhad typed up! We therefore decided to write this chapter based entirely on what we\ncould see happening in the film material. After considering different methods of\nanalyzing these data, we decided to apply a grounded-theory approach (Glaser &\nStrauss, 1967) rather than use a formal coding system derived from existing theories\n3 Having observed in the first session that the act of unpacking the materials might have been a\nbarrier to using them, we took them out of their packaging as of the second session, spreading out\nthe oil pastels and paint bottles on the platform to make them more easily available. 13 So What Do You Do? 229\non group dynamics or collective creativity processes that would restrict our vision to\nexisting categories. More than a year after the experiences in the studio, we revisited\nthe films and turned off the audio track, noting down separately what we saw people\ndoing in the physical space\u2014when and for how long they engaged with each other\nand with the fixed or semifixed physical aspects of the studio. We then compared our\nindividual observations, jointly checking the film material again when we found we\nhad noticed things differently. It is from this iterative process that we gained fresh\ninsights into the integrated process of constructing social and physical space.\nIn the account that follows we rely as much as possible on these observations and\nprovide visual illustrations from the video recording. Although we disciplined our-\nselves to base our analysis on the film material, it is difficult to exclude additional\nknowledge from our analysis completely, for we had jointly designed and experi-\nenced all the sessions. We include some details that are not based on the visible\nevidence when we feel it would be essential for the reader\u2019s understanding.\nConfigurations in Spaces of Social Creativity\nEach of the sessions was unique in the ideas or works the participants came up with\nand in the ways they produced those outcomes. In observing the video recordings of\nthe five sessions, however, we noticed patterns, or configurations, of organization\nand behavior. We use the term configuration in four senses: (a) the participants\u2019\npositions in the room and relative to each other during a specific time period, (b) the\nobservable interactions of the participants among each other and with materials in\nthe room, (c) the observable application of behavioral rules, and (d) the creation of\nshared meaning (to the extent that it can be inferred from the group\u2019s observable\nbehavior and outputs).\nTo illustrate these configurations and make inferences from them about the use\nof space for bringing together different kinds of knowledge to generate creative\naction, we first analyze in depth the pattern of configurations formed by participants\nin one of the sessions, Session 2. We then relate this pattern to those formed by\nparticipants in other sessions. We have chosen this session for presenting our analy-\nsis because it is representative in terms of the number and types of configurations\nand because the entire session is available on video recordings (parts of this material\nof two other sessions were corrupted, so we can analyze only their soundtracks).\nLooking Closely at a Sample Session\nAs in all of the sessions, the participants in Session 2 were asked to think about how\nthey would use this space to combine processes of social entrepreneurship, conflict\nengagement, and the arts in ways that would connect the college with the commu-\nnity and contribute to regional development. However, this session was unique 230 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nTable 13.1 The nine participants in Session 2 of the action experiment at Max Stern Yezreel\nValley College in Israel\nDescription of participant Reference in text\nLecturer in the college nursing faculty, Jewish woman anthropologist Lecturer\nTwo Palestinian Arab women students participating in workshop on Student 1\nsocial entrepreneurship Student 2\nJewish woman student participant in workshop on social Student 3\nentrepreneurship\nTeaching assistant in a social entrepreneurship practicum, Palestinian Teaching assistant\nArab woman graduate of the college\nJewish woman artist Artist\nAction researcher, faculty member of the college, Jewish man Researcher 1\nSenior researcher in a German research institute, French-American Researcher 2\nwoman\nDrama student filming the session, French-American man Cameraman\nTable 13.2 Session 2 of the Sequence Configuration Duration (in min.)\naction experiment at Max\n1 Orientation 15\nStern Yezreel Valley College\n2 Meeting mode 19\nin Israel\n3 Expansion 25\n4 Creation 10\n5 Reflection 8\n6 Exhibition 3\n7 Rehearsal 20\nbecause it centered on meeting an immediate need on campus for a defined target\ngroup. A class of approximately 60 nursing students, half of them Jewish and half\nPalestinian Arab had requested support in engaging in a real conflict they were\nexperiencing in class. The head of the nursing program had asked Victor and a\nmember of the nursing faculty who taught anthropology to these students whether\nthey could help the group address the issues (see also Arieli, Friedman, & Knayzev,\n2012). The two faculty members agreed to take on the challenge and decided to use\na session in the studio to design it. Victor offered three students from his social\nentrepreneurship course the opportunity to work on the project with him as their\npractical assignment for the course, and he asked one of the teaching assistants in\nthe social entrepreneurship course to help as well. The artist chosen for this session\ncame on the recommendation of one of the students from the social entrepreneur-\nship course. Table 13.1 provides an overview of the nine participants in Session 2.\nSession 2 lasted 100 min, during which time the participants formed seven con-\nfigurations in the studio space (see Table 13.2). The session was entirely in Hebrew\nbecause the students, the teaching assistant, and the artist were not comfortable\nusing English. Researcher 2, therefore, did not speak in the session; she listened and\nobserved but could not understand exactly what was said. 13 So What Do You Do? 231\nFig. 13.2 Orientation configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nThe first configuration, Orientation, formed as soon as the participants entered\nthe studio. As visible in Fig. 13.2, the participants bunched closely at the entrance\nto the studio (the door is invisible just to the left). Three of the participants leaned\nagainst a table, one sat on a table, and three stood (the teaching assistant had not yet\narrived). At least three of the participants looked outwards into the studio space,\ngetting a sense of the room itself. A few minutes into this configuration the video\nshowed that the participants turned toward each other, talking, listening, gesturing,\nand looking at a document.4\nIn the Orientation configuration, the participants were acquiring a sense of both\nthe space and their task in the session. Researcher 1 and the artist did most of the\ntalking. To the extent that the participants explored the space, it was only with their\neyes. The students, in particular, appeared pensive and uncomfortable with the size\nof the space and the uncertainty of the task itself.\nThe shift to a new configuration occurred a quarter of an hour into the session,\nshortly after the lecturer arrived. She briefly observed the situation, then found chairs,\nwhich student 3 helped her arrange in a semicircle in front of the table at which the\nparticipants were huddling. The positioning of the chairs caused a change in the\npositioning of the participants. Those who had been standing in front of the table sat\ndown, facing the others, who were sitting or leaning on the table (see Fig. 13.3).\n4 In preparation for the intervention, the students in the nursing course had been asked to respond\nto a questionnaire asking them to define the kind of atmosphere they would like to create in their\nclass, why this kind of atmosphere was important to them, and what concrete steps should be taken\nto create it. Researchers 1 and 3, together with the students from the course on social entrepreneur-\nship, had analyzed the responses prior to Session 2 so as to provide a resource to the planning team. 232 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nFig. 13.3 Meeting-mode configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nThe new physical arrangement signaled to the participants that they were in a meet-\ning, hence our choice of the name Meeting Mode for this configuration. The partici-\npants looked more comfortable with the situation, into which they could bring the\nknown rules of behavior for meetings. More of the participants spoke during this\nconfiguration than during the Orientation.\nAlthough there was a change in the organization and physical positioning of the\nparticipants in the Meeting Mode, there was almost no change in the group\u2019s loca-\ntion in the room. Figure 13.3 shows that the members of the group remained closely\nclustered next to the door through which they had entered the studio. Researcher 2\nattempted to direct attention to the availability of larger space and the art materials\nby walking to front-center of the room, where the art materials were located on a\nlow platform. She began finger-painting on a large piece of flipchart paper, captur-\ning words she picked up from the conversation. However, the other participants did\nnot appear to pay any attention to this attempt at modeling. The ineffectiveness of\nthis attempt may be related to the language barrier that led researcher 2 to hover\naround the group but never actually join in the planning process throughout the\nsession.\nThe next configuration, which we termed Expansion, began after 19 min (see\nFig. 13.4). Researcher 1 stood up and walked toward the middle of the room, fol-\nlowed quickly by the teaching assistant. The other participants began to move\nslowly across the room toward the art materials, with the lecturer joining them after\na conversation with students 1 and 2.\nResearcher 2 stopped finger-painting and picked up her sheet of flipchart paper\nfrom the pile on the platform so that others could take paper. The artist bent down 13 So What Do You Do? 233\nFig. 13.4 Expansion configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nand began picking up sheets of flipchart paper, spreading them on the floor in the\nmiddle of the room. Some of the participants began to look at, pick up, inspect,\nand handle the materials. The artist sat down on the floor, followed by researcher\n1, the lecturer, and then the students and the teaching assistant. Researcher 2 car-\nried colors, paints, clay, and other materials from the platform to various points\nnear the group.\nWe called this configuration Expansion because the participants pushed back the\nboundaries of the space they had created for themselves. Before sitting down, the\nartist had taken off her shoes, and the others followed suit, signaling a shift to less\nformal rules of behavior in the group\u2019s new space. The video recording of Session 2\nshows the participants talking in a more relaxed way than in the previous two con-\nfigurations and occasionally laughing. The lecturer began writing with a marker on\nthe paper, researcher 1 played with finger-paints, and the teaching assistant also\nbegan to draw. The Expansion configuration involved exploration and the opening\nup of new possibilities for the use of the physical space, the materials, behaviors,\nand ways participants related to each other. Laughter broke out when researcher 1\nwithdrew an offer he had made on a piece of paper for the group to focus on.\nObserving the video material, we think that this moment marks another shift in the\nrules of behavior because the agenda-setting power of the most senior participant\nand convener of the session in the studio was visibly called into question. The lec-\nturer then began to lead a discussion, looking at the other participants and inviting\nthem to express themselves. It lasted for 25 min, the lengthiest of all the configura-\ntions in Session 2. 234 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nFig. 13.5 Creation configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nThere was a sudden transition to a new configuration in which the participants\nbegan drawing or painting on two shared sheets of paper. Everyone was leaning\nforward, and there was an appearance of great intensity. We term this configuration\nCreation (see Fig. 13.5) because a relatively cohesive group took shape and created\na collective work.5 During this Configuration the group appeared to be comfortable\nbehaving as artists, each individual concentrating on aesthetic expression.\nAfter 10 min of the intense Creation configuration, the participants of Session 2\nstopped drawing on the paper and leaned back, looked at what they had done, and\nbegan talking again. We called this the Reflection configuration (see Fig. 13.6). The\nrules of the game were no longer the same as in the previous configurations that had\nbeen dominated by talking: The participants pointed to elements on the paper, asked\nquestions, and invited others to speak. No one speaker dominated, and the material\nthat lay in the middle of the room played a significant role. The participants remained\nin the same physical location and arrangement, and there was no movement through\nthe space of the studio. However, by leaning back to consider the physical expres-\nsion of their shared thinking, they appear to have expanded the space they inhabited\ntogether at that moment.\nThe Reflection configuration lasted 8 min, at which point all of the participants\nstood up, took the picture they had created, hung it on the front wall of the studio,\nand stepped back to look at it. We termed this configuration Exhibition (see\nFig. 13.7) because it was as though the participants had transformed part of the\n5 The audio material reveals that at this point the group had just decided to experiment together\nwith how they would actually envisage the intervention with the class of 60 students. 13 So What Do You Do? 235\nFig. 13.6 Reflection configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nFig. 13.7 Exhibition configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors) 236 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nFig. 13.8 Rehearsal configuration, Session 2 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nstudio into an exhibition space, displaying their work as artists usually do. In this\nconfiguration the participants not only moved to a different part of the studio and\nused wall space for the first time, they behaved differently from all previous constel-\nlations by arranging themselves as though they were in a gallery, standing opposite\na picture, observing it, and commenting to cospectators.\nFigure 13.7 also documents how the participants traversed and utilized various\nparts of the studio space at different times. Traces of earlier configurations remain:\nthe chairs from the Meeting Mode in the foreground, near the entrance to the studio;\nand the papers on the floor in the front-center of the room.\nThe Exhibition configuration in Session 2 lasted for only 3 min, at which point\nthe participants re-formed into a kind of a loose circle with the picture to their backs\nand began talking and moving around, using a much larger part of the room. We\ntermed this new arrangement the Rehearsal configuration (Fig. 13.8) because the\nvideo recording shows the participants physically acting something out to each\nother and commenting after each performance.\nThe audio file documents that the participants were talking about and trying out\nhow to apply what they had learned from this process to the following week\u2019s\nplanned session with the 60 nursing students. The Rehearsal implied expanding the\nspace of the participants in several ways: They moved around a larger portion of the\nstudio while acting out their presentations, they extended their space into the future,\nand they related to the entire studio space as they envisioned the way 60 nursing\nstudents could use it in the upcoming intervention. 13 So What Do You Do? 237\nRehearsal was the final configuration we observed in this session. It lasted for 20\nmin\u2014until the time for Session 2 ran out\u2014at which point the group broke up, some\nparticipants rushed away, and others began cleaning up while talking.\nComparative Analysis Across Sessions\nHaving looked at Session 2 in some depth, we now compare it with the other ses-\nsions to specify the configurations and their various forms. There was a different\ngroup of participants in each session, but they were all given the same basic task.\nEach group used the space and the materials in a different way and came up with\nvery different insights and products. Nevertheless, most of the configurations we\nobserved in Session 2 recurred in the other sessions as well, though not always in\nthe same order. A comparative analysis permits us to hypothesize that\u2014\n1. there are definable configurations of participants\u2019 positions and interactions\namong each other and with materials in a given place and period of time, and\nthey change over the course of a group\u2019s engagement with social creativity;\n2. some configurations are associated with greater expansion of space than others;\n3. there are patterns in the flow between configurations; and\n4. some patterns may be more generative of social creativity than others.\nBy flow, we mean the change in and order of configurations over time. Generativity\nin this context refers to the observable collective output.\nTable 13.3 provides an overview of the configurations that took shape during all\nfive sessions. It reveals that all the sessions started with Orientation. Sessions 3 and\n4 showed the greatest similarity with the flow in Session 2, encompassing Expansion,\nCreation, and Exhibition. The flows in Sessions 1 and 5 were essentially the same,\nwith a repetition of the Meeting Mode after a phase of Expansion.\nA detailed comparison of the configurations in each session would exceed the\nscope of this chapter, but it is useful to consider some of the similarities and differ-\nences a bit more closely.\nTable 13.3 Overview of the configurations in all the action experiments\nBasis of\ncomparison:\nTime Session 2 Session 1 Session 3 Session 4 Session 5\nOrientation Orientation Orientation Orientation Orientation\nMeeting Meeting mode Expansion Meeting mode Meeting mode\nmode\nExpansion Expansion Creation Expansion Expansion\nCreation Meeting mode Exhibition Creation Meeting mode\nReflection Reflection (Reflection) Exhibition\nExhibition Pseudocreation\nRehearsal 238 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nOrientation\nThere were significant differences in the way the participants in the five sessions\ninitially oriented themselves to the space. Whereas the Orientation configuration in\nSession 2 was characterized by huddling\u2014with the participants remaining almost\nfrozen in one spot for the whole time\u2014the video recordings of Sessions 1, 3, and 5\nshow the people moving around and physically exploring the space.\nMeeting Mode\nIn each case this configuration was initiated by someone suggesting that the partici-\npants sit or by someone bringing chairs out. The Meeting Mode seemed to be a way\nof reducing the size of the room and establishing a known set of behavioral rules in\nthe undifferentiated space offered in the studio. We observed that once participants\nhad positioned themselves in the Meeting Mode it was difficult for them to break\nout of that configuration and do anything besides talk. Only in Session 3 did no\nMeeting-Mode configuration come about.\nExpansion\nThe Expansion configuration usually followed the Meeting Mode, but it formed in\nvery different ways, took different amounts of time, and led to different configura-\ntions. In Session 1 Expansion began after participants had been in a Meeting Mode\nfor over an hour. One of the participants stood up and began exploring the studio\nspace by walking around and playing his musical instrument (a small mouth organ)\nat different points in the space. Researcher 1 joined in, using some of the furniture\nin the room for drumming. The other participants stood up, moved out of the circle\nof chairs, and observed what was happening. After a few minutes, however, the\nparticipants returned to the same circle of chairs, and the group appeared to revert\nto the Meeting Mode. There was no change in their position in the room or in their\nspatial relation to each other. Nor was there any sustained change in their use of the\nphysical space. In Session 5 there was a brief Expansion when one of the partici-\npants got up from his chair and walked to the center of the room with Researcher 1\nto illustrate how he would redesign the space. However, the other participants\nremained in their places, and everyone returned to the Meeting Mode after a few\nmoments.\nIn Session 4 Expansion was quite lengthy, lasting approximately 45 min. It began\nwith a sudden burst of movement into singing, dancing, drumming, wandering\naround the room, and working with the art materials. For the most part the partici-\npants carried out these actions separately\u2014each one doing his or her own thing.\nAfter about 2 min the participants began to reconfigure themselves, interacting with\neach other one-on-one or wandering around the room and looking at what others\nwere doing. Gradually, they formed into a single group around paper and materials 13 So What Do You Do? 239\nthat the researchers had placed on the floor in the center of the room. The partici-\npants then shifted into the Creation configuration, talking around the paper and\nstarting to use the art materials. In Session 3 the participants went directly from\nOrientation into Expansion\u2014sitting on the floor and playing with materials as they\ntalked.\nCreation Configuration\nCreation was characterized by the participants\u2019 trying out new ways of jointly act-\ning and expressing thoughts and feelings that led to a collective outcome. It entailed\nthe use of the art materials provided for the session but also the use of other objects\nin the room and the participants\u2019 own bodies (e.g., drumming on a board or whis-\ntling to make music). In Session 2 the work was a set of pictures; in Session 3 the\nparticipants painted, danced, hummed, whistled, and engaged in pantomime; and in\nSession 4 they made graffiti. The Creation configuration was generally character-\nized by a shift from talking to doing. In Sessions 2 and 3 there was little or, for\nstretches of time, even no talking during Creation. In Session 4 there was an inter-\nweaving of doing and talking. The intensity and length of the configuration varied,\ntoo: Creation in Session 2 was highly intense but relatively brief (10 min). In Session\n3 it was both extremely intense and lengthy (36 min). In Session 4 it lasted for\nalmost 35 min, but at the end of that session the participants engaged in an activity\nthat we designate as pseudocreation: They accepted the offer of one of the members\nto lead them in a Tai Chi exercise. Although it was a collective dance of a kind, it\nwas highly ritualized, leaving the followers no scope for a creative response. We did\nnot observe a Creation configuration in Sessions 1 and 5, whose participants never\nappeared to form as a group around a task other than talk and did not generate an\nobservable product.\nReflection\nThe video recording shows evidence of Reflection in two of the sessions, and in\nboth cases material played a focusing role. At the end of Session 1, the participants\nare seen holding and looking at a balloon on which the cameraman had written sat-\nisfaction, and they are talking while throwing it to each other. In Session 2 the par-\nticipants leaned back to reflect together on their drawings. One of the factors that led\nus to give this configuration separate ontological status was that fact that its absence\nwas conspicuous in Session 3, in which the participants had decided to communi-\ncate without speaking. The Creation configuration lasted to the end of the session,\nand there was no time for any other configuration. However, the participants felt\nsuch a strong need to reflect on the experience and talk about it that they spontane-\nously decided to meet for dinner later in the week. The experience of Creation\nwithout Reflection left the participants feeling as though something were\nunfinished. 240 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nFig. 13.9 Exhibition configuration, Session 3 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nExhibition\nIn three sessions the participants put their work on the wall, taking the creation out\nof the group\u2019s realm and displaying it as artists do. There were interesting differ-\nences worth noting. In Sessions 1 and 4 the participants became observers standing\nopposite the work, whereas in Session 3 the participants sat under their picture and\ntook a group photograph, capturing themselves as part of the work that they had\ncreated (Fig. 13.9).\nIn Session 4 the Exhibition configuration formed when the participants hung\ntheir graffiti-like outputs of the Creation configuration onto the wall at the front of\nthe room (see Fig. 13.10). Rather than transforming that part of the studio into a\ngallery space, it transformed it into a kind of public wall on which one might paint\nor spray graffiti messages for passers-by to see.\nRehearsal\nIn this configuration the participants expanded the space in order to include other\npeople in a future session. Rehearsal was most evident in the video of Session 2,\nwhen the participants tried out ways of presenting their ideas for the intervention\nwith the nursing students. In Session 4 the Rehearsal configuration took a different\nform. It was an attempt to mentally enact or envision what might happen rather than\na physical acting out of a future event. The Exhibition of the graffiti on the studio\nwall presented the participants with a vision of what their messages could look like 13 So What Do You Do? 241\nFig. 13.10 Exhibition configuration, Session 4 of the action experiment in the Studio for Social\nCreativity (Photograph by the authors)\nif displayed on walls of the college. The audio material captured a heated discussion\nabout this scenario, revealing possible responses from students and the administra-\ntion. During Rehearsal in Session 2, the participants set out the rules of behavior for\nthemselves and the 60 nursing students, whereas Rehearsal in Session 4 involved\nthe participants\u2019 self-projection into conditions where the rules of behavior were not\nunder their control. In the end they decided not to pursue the idea of taking their\nwork out of the studio.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this chapter has been to deepen our understanding of the relationship\nbetween space and the generation of knowledge through and for action. The first\nthing we noticed from the analysis of the video recording was that the different\ngroups varied widely in their use of the space, their interactions among each other,\nand their use of the materials. Furthermore, the groups\u2019 outputs\u2014the ideas gener-\nated for using the space\u2014differed significantly. The second striking outcome of our\nanalysis was that commonalities existed across the sessions in terms of the\nknowledge- production processes. We identified seven distinct configurations:\nOrientation, Meeting Mode, Expansion, Creation, Reflection, Exhibition, and\nRehearsal. These configurations differed in content, duration, and the transitions\nbetween them. However, their fundamental structural similarity allows us to formu-\nlate key insights into, or propositions about, the relationships between space, action,\nand knowledge generation. 242 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nOrientation in Undifferentiated Space\nAs illustrated in the data analysis, every group began with the Orientation configu-\nration. The participants took some time to become acquainted with the space and to\nfigure out where and how to situate themselves so as to engage in the task. The\nOrientation configuration of each group differed significantly\u2014some stood in one\nspot and looked around. Others walked around, exploring the room. We recognize\nthat this behavior was at least in part a response to our opening suggestion that the\nparticipants explore the space for themselves. But our experience of this configura-\ntion, both in the actual moment and in subsequent observation of the video, has led\nus to conclude that it was also a reaction to uncertainty about what to do in this\nspace and how to do it. Kornberger and Clegg (2004) wrote that space can be con-\nceived of in two ways, namely, \u201cas an absence of presence, as a vast emptiness, as\nsomething that one can get lost in \u2026[A]lternatively, it may be thought of socially\u201d\n(p. 1095). By contrast, we suggest that, in practice, both conceptions can occur\nsimultaneously because the physical and the social are interrelated in space. The\nparticipants entering the studio saw a vast emptiness, which led some to huddle\nalong the wall, others to cluster close together elsewhere in the room. They per-\nceived an absence of cues for positioning and behaving, and as a group they had no\nrules of their own yet for how to engage with each other in going about the task at\nhand in this new space.\nThe Orientation configuration led us to hypothesize that the uncertainty was the\nresult of a particular relationship between features of the physical space and how the\nparticipants perceived and experienced them. The first feature was the undifferenti-\nated character of the space. Kurt Lewin (1951/1997) introduced the construct of\n\u201cdifferentiation\u201d (pp. 218\u2013220) to conceptualize learning as a change of sociopsy-\nchological space. In order to illustrate this notion, he drew an analogy to the process\nof finding one\u2019s way around an unfamiliar city without using a map. At first the city\nseems like a large undifferentiated mass, which a person experiences as uncertainty\nand in which one easily feels lost. Getting to know a city means mentally differen-\ntiating, or bounding off, distinct places and regions, seeing their location relative to\nother areas, and identifying ways of getting from one to another. Thus, the city\nbecomes differentiated in the person\u2019s mind into distinct blocks, neighborhoods,\nand districts bounded by streets and other demarcations. Differentiation of a space\nalso is at least partly about becoming aware of the rules governing behavior, such as\nknowing where one should not walk after dark.\nFor the participants in the experiment, the studio was, at first, highly undifferen-\ntiated, a characteristic that was influenced by both physical and social features. For\nthem, it was a large, unfamiliar space as well as an encounter with people who came\nfrom different backgrounds and who had never worked together as a group before.\nBaldry (1999, p. 536) pointed out that physical environments as well as social fac-\ntors (e.g., formal authority, gender) usually provide cues for behavior, so environ-\nmental cues reinforce what is socially defined as being appropriate or inappropriate.\nBoth the structure of the room and semifixed aspects such as furniture and d\u00e9cor 13 So What Do You Do? 243\nsuggest what is to be done and how it should be done. To the extent that people have\nthe prior knowledge to recognize these cues, they are likely to conform to expecta-\ntions (p. 544). If we had brought the same people into a classroom, meeting room,\nor office, they would immediately have known where to sit and how to act because\nthe space itself would have been perceived by the participants as full of clear cues\nabout the rules of the game\u2014that is, how to behave in this space. It is important to\nstress, however, that differentiation is not an intrinsic feature of the physical space\nitself but rather the way in which a person perceives that space and interacts with it.\nOrientation in Unencrusted Space\nThe second feature that contributed to uncertainty is what we call unencrustedness\nof the space. By unencrustedness we mean that the room did not retain traces of the\nproduction of our previous sessions, that it was free of vestiges that might orient\nlater groups in defining their task and shaping their expectations about the outcome.\nUnencrustedness was not a feature of the space itself but rather reflected an interac-\ntion between a decision of the convener-researchers, the physical space, and the\nparticipants. We had considered the option of leaving the products of previous\ngroups\u2019 work in the room, of preserving changes they had made in the room\u2019s\ndesign, and/or of actually incorporating their suggestions for how the room should\nbe used. Adopting any of those possibilities would have meant that each new group\nentering the studio would have been faced with evidence of the knowledge that had\nemerged from the previous group\u2019s engagement with the task. A group could have\nignored this material or could have done something quite different, but it would still\nhave been doing its work in the context of previous work and under its influence.\nSuch an approach would have meant conceiving of the experiment as shaping the\nspace through a cumulative, historical process in which each group, at least in part,\ninterpreted and built on what earlier groups had done. We decided against this\noption because our guidelines called for leaving each group as much freedom as\npossible in determining how they would think and act in this space. Encrusting the\nspace might have constrained the range of future possible ways of using the room.\nOf course, the space still had a history. Indeed, two of the participants remembered\nthat the space had been an open stage, and its now closed structure saddened them.\nQualifying Spaces of Possibility\nOur analysis confirms and extends work by scholars who have addressed the con-\nnection between space and possibility. Lewin (1951/1997, p. 268) suggested that\nundifferentiated space is not only full of uncertainty but full of possibilities. This\nassumption is also reflected in the work of contemporary scholars such as 244 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nKornberger and Clegg (2004), who argued that \u201cspace has to contain possibili-\nties, which might be perceived as emptiness\u201d (p. 1106) and that organizations\nneed \u201cchaotic, ambiguous and incomplete space\u201d (p. 1106) in order to generate\ncreative problem-solving. Other scholars, too, have suggested that \u201cspaces of\nambiguity\u201d (Stark, 2009, p. 3) and \u201cincomplete\u201d work environments lend them-\nselves to the kind of collaborative inquiry that is needed to deal with problems\ncharacterized by a lack of clarity and ambiguous information (Horgen, Joroff,\nPorter, & Sch\u00f6n, 1999, p. 197). The implication is that the experience of undif-\nferentiated space creates potential for producing new ways of thinking and act-\ning. In an analysis of aesthetic experience with theater, Woodward and Ellison\n(2010) struck a similar note, describing it \u201cas a space of imaginative elaboration,\nextension and perhaps even a space that afforded a type of \u2018reflexivity\u2019 in that it\ndrew on existing structures as the basis for the realization of creative social action\ninto the future\u201d (p. 53).\nThe results of the experiment lead us to qualify these assumptions about undif-\nferentiated space as spaces of possibility and to add the concept of unencrusted\nspace. When faced with a space that generated uncertainty, almost all the groups\nwent into the Meeting-Mode configuration. The participants sat and talked in a\nsmall circle, making no use of the open space of the room, of the artistic materials,\nor of other objects in the room. It appeared almost as though they created a room\nenclosed by invisible walls within the larger space. Thus, in a large room offering\nmany possibilities in principle, people tended to reduce their uncertainty about how\nto engage with each other and the task by recreating a traditional kind of meeting\nspace that utilized only a small fraction of the total space.\nWe hypothesize that the Meeting Mode provided participants with a sense of\nsecurity and order in the face of uncertainty caused by a vaguely defined task and a\nlarge, strange, and undifferentiated space\u2014and that the Meeting Mode exacts a\nprice for this sense of security. Although we do not claim that the Meeting-Mode\nconfiguration necessarily prevents groups from thinking and acting creatively, our\ninference from the experiment is that the Meeting Mode is less likely to offer oppor-\ntunities to experience surprise or newness. Once in the Meeting Mode, all the groups\nhad a hard time breaking out of it and transitioning into what we called the Expansion\nconfiguration, and some of them never moved into Creation. We hypothesize that\nthe Meeting-Mode configuration reflected a powerful norm or mental imprint that\ndictates how people come together to work at least in this particular organizational\nand cultural constellation. A theater or dance ensemble, like other groups from the\nart world, would most likely have perceived and used the space very differently.\nFuture research could clarify whether mixed groups of participants who already\nhave experience working together might be more experimental and playful than our\nparticipants were while working on a new task in the studio or whether their prior\nknowledge of how to work together would reduce the range of possibilities they\ncould envision in the space. 13 So What Do You Do? 245\nConstructing Spaces Conducive to Newness\nOur research leads us to suggest that the experience of undifferentiated and unen-\ncrusted space offers a potential source of newness\u2014if the participants use the\nopportunity. This view of the relationship between physical and social space is more\naccurate than a claim that undifferentiated and unencrusted spaces are spaces of\npossibility. We hypothesize that such space provides a context conducive to experi-\nencing not knowing as an opening for creating new knowledge (Berthoin Antal,\n2013). However, not knowing generates a sense of uncertainty that people (other\nthan artists) tend to experience as uncomfortable. As a consequence, this experience\nof spaces confronts people with a choice in seeking to generate new knowledge: Do\nthey impose a familiar set of rules onto the social and physical space, or do they\nengage the newness of the space to experiment with unfamiliar modes of being,\nthinking, and interacting with each other, the space, and objects in the space?\nThe qualified advantages of spaces of possibility and the phenomena of the\nMeeting Mode illustrate how space is constructed by people through interaction\nwith the physical space, with objects, and among themselves. This fundamental\npoint is often obscured in the literature when authors write about physical space as\nthough it acted, almost with a will of its own, upon the people who interact with it,\nindependently of their perception and choices. For example, Kornberger and Clegg\n(2004) asserted that \u201cspace is both the medium and outcome of the actions it recur-\nsively organizes\u201d (p. 1106) and that \u201csuch spaces are capable of transforming them-\nselves while being (ab)used and occupied by different people only temporarily\u201d\n(p. 1106). These statements tend to anthropomorphize space, attributing to it an\nability to \u201corganize\u201d or even \u201ctransform itself\u201d and thereby opening the door to\ndeterministic thinking. The findings of our experiment remind us that a space\nbecomes generative or is transformed only through the agency of people who inter-\nact with the physical space and among themselves. Our analysis of the video record-\nings of the action experiments we conducted in the Studio for Social Creativity\nillustrates how physical space comes into human perception and is then acted upon\nand shaped by people, becoming a part of social space.\nThe Relationship Between Talking and Doing6\nAnother insight from the experiments concerns the relationship between talking and\ndoing as media for innovative thinking and action. In designing the experiment, we\nhoped that the participants would go beyond verbal communication and do some-\nthing with the room, the materials, and each other. Our inclination to favor action\n6 We recognize that this duality is simplistic and even misleading because talk is also a form\nof action. We are using this formulation as a short form for purely cognitive verbal communication\nas distinct from multisensual ways of knowing, feeling, and expressing. 246 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nover talk stemmed from the assumption that doing would heighten the aesthetic\ndimensions of experience by involving the body, the senses, and movement. We\nassumed that this intensification would enhance the innovative thinking of the par-\nticipants and ultimately increase the creativity of outputs presented as a model of\naesthetic relations \u201ccentered on exchanges of emotional energy which mark out\nmoments of intersubjectivity between people\u201d (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 52).\nThe familiar Meeting-Mode configuration favored talk and other engagement at\nthe cognitive level. Even though some of this talk touched on highly interesting\ninsights, our inference, based on our observations of the group members and our\nown subjective experience of this configuration, was that discussions in the Meeting\nMode generated little energy. In Session 2, which we analyzed in depth, we could\nobserve, and feel, the gradual, positive change in energy as the group moved out of\nthe Meeting Mode into Expansion and then Creation. Our observation of the ses-\nsions revealed relationships between the engagement with objects and changes in\nenergy levels. We confirm that \u201cobjects are manipulated and energized as products\nof the relations between the material, the sensual and the embodied as they play out\nin relation to imagination and the mind\u201d (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 46). Our\nobservations lead us beyond corroborating this claim; they bring us to suggest that\nby energizing objects, people energize themselves. The bodily experience of mov-\ning and shifting position in the process of working with the objects and art materials\nin the room stimulated and reinforced energy at both the individual and the group\nlevels. The engagement of multiple bodily ways of knowing heightened the aes-\nthetic dimensions of experience in ways that were energizing. We hypothesize that\nthis energy made it easier for the participants to engage the uncertainty and explore\nnew possibilities for thinking and action.\nIn our estimation the moment of highest energy and aesthetically most powerful\nexperience occurred in the Creation configuration in Session 3. The participants\nchose to stop talking entirely. For approximately 45 min they used the artistic mate-\nrials and their bodies, communicating through their eyes, movements, and touch.\nIronically, the experience in this configuration led us to revise our thinking about the\nrelative value of doing and talking. The nonverbal communication lasted until the\nend of the session, at which point all the participants expressed a strong need to talk\nabout the experience. There was a sense of incompleteness without the opportunity\nfor shared reflection. This experience led us to see talking and doing as two crucial\nmoments whose interplay is critical in the creative process.\nMethodological Reflection\nIn addition to the insights gained about the relationship between social and physical\nspace and the generation of knowledge through and for action, we offer several\nmethodological reflections from our experience with the action experiments in the\nStudio for Social Creativity. We confirm the value of separating visual from verbal\nanalysis. It has permitted us to overcome the problem of most publications in this 13 So What Do You Do? 247\nfield: that \u201cspace has mainly been associated with the aural (auditory-oral) medium,\nemphasizing talking and listening, overlooking other salient bodily features such as\nseeing, looking, gazing, glancing, contemplating, scrutinizing, gesturing and mov-\ning in specific ways\u201d (Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007, p. 194). We benefited in at least\nthree ways from the artistic presence of the Nose with the video camera. First, it was\nhelpful to have an artist as part of our research team for a project that entailed\nexploring the possible contribution of artistic ways of knowing in social creation.\nHe helped push us out of our comfort zone by posing questions before and after the\nsessions and by sharing his perspective on the experience. Second, the participants\nresponded positively to his curious presence, reducing the camera to a playful\ninstrument in all but one instance.7 Third, his inquisitive, energy-seeking approach\nrevealed in the video material spaces of possibility the groups were not (yet) using.8\nConclusion\nThe analysis of our action experiments in the Studio for Social Creativity has per-\nmitted us to formulate propositions about the interaction between social and physi-\ncal space. First, we invited people to envisage how to generate new possibilities (for\ninteraction?) and then observed how these participants engaged with each other in\nthe social and physical space provided for their task. On this basis we identified\nseven distinct configurations: Orientation, Meeting Mode, Expansion, Creation,\nReflection, and Rehearsal. Second, by focusing on the video material, we revealed\nhow anxious it makes people to be in what they perceive as undifferentiated space,\nhow quickly they try to import rules from other spaces in order to reduce their\nuncertainty, and how they thereby risk getting locked into established ways of think-\ning and behaving. Third, the visual analysis also showed that shifting from one\nconfiguration to another involved expanding into new physical space (e.g., moving\nto the middle of room, working on the floor, or using the wall for exhibition) and\nengaging creatively with art materials and other objects. Adding aesthetic ways of\nexperiencing and communicating increased the group\u2019s social creativity. Fourth, we\npostulate that both undifferentiated and unencrusted space are conducive for\nenabling the emergence of newness by maximizing the choice participants have as\nto how to engage with each other and their task. We thereby underscore and clarify\nthe significance of space for creativity while avoiding the anthropomorphization of\n7 Although the Nose usually greeted the participants outside the studio, in one session he was\nperched on a ladder and holding the camera when the participants entered the room. One of those\nparticipants did not remember having been informed about the filming of the sessions, so he\naddressed what he felt to be an infringement. Recording stopped while the group discussed the\nsituation. One of the participants commented \u201cwith a cameraman like that, nothing bad can hap-\npen,\u201d and they all agreed to the filming.\n8 Sometimes participants subsequently used the space to which the Nose had turned his attention\n(e.g., the balcony in Session 1). We do not know whether their actions were triggered by his, or\nwhether he sensed something earlier that they discovered a little later. 248 A. Berthoin Antal and V.J. Friedman\nspace, a conceptual trap that we encountered in the literature. Fifth, we note the\nneed for movement between nonverbal and verbal forms of interaction in creating\nknowledge and sharing meaning. When people limit themselves to just talking, they\ntend to become stuck. Choosing not to talk during a phase of experimentation with\nbodily forms of knowing and communicating is generative; and verbal communica-\ntion is needed once more for shared reflection.\nThe action experiments confirm how valuable it is for us as researchers to move\nout of our comfort zone when we are seeking new knowledge. We took two such\nsteps in this project. First, we decided to participate in such an open exploratory\nprocess rather than stand back as observers or facilitators of a clearly structured\nworkshop. Second, we chose in this chapter to focus our analysis solely on the vis-\nible evidence recorded on film. Both steps have proven highly generative. However,\nwe recognize that the focus on the visible in our analysis did not give us access to\ncertain important aspects. In order to explore the meaning the participants were\ngiving to their actions, we need to listen to what they said and then connect that\nback to what we have observed. An analysis of the spoken words would enable us\nto correct or refine our configurations, for example. The other aspect we have not\nyet attended to are the power dynamics in the Studio for Social Creativity. Of\ncourse, they were present in the situation, for conflict in the region and tensions\nbetween groups at the college were two of the drivers for conducting the sessions\nin the studio. Moreover, there were differences in status among the participants\n(e.g., students vs. different levels of faculty; Palestinian Arab vs. Jewish back-\ngrounds; men vs. women; and artists, academics, and practitioners). Exploring\nthose dynamics in the construction of social space and use of physical space would\nrequire analyzing the spoken and written (e.g., graffiti) aspects along with the vis-\nible process.\nAnother issue that needs to be examined is the potential paradox inherent in the\nStudio for Social Creativity. We have posited that the undifferentiated and unen-\ncrusted nature of the space is an important condition for enabling participants to\ngenerate new ideas and ways of engaging there. How will its potential as a space of\npossibility be maintained for groups to return to over time? The more they use the\nspace, the more likely it is that they will build mental models of how to use it (even\nif they leave it unencrusted), making it harder on their return for them to break out\nof an unusual way of having used it. We sense a need to engage more frequently\nand intimately with the world of the arts to stimulate our learning. Actors and musi-\ncians have experience with the paradox because they have to keep being creative on\nthe stages they return to night after night. Fortunately, some artists are seeking\ninspiration precisely by moving out of the spaces they know in order to engage in\nlearning creatively with people from other worlds, including academics (Berthoin\nAntal, 2015).\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to the Institute for Advanced Study, Constance, for giving the\nfirst author the time and space to develop ideas for this chapter. 13 So What Do You Do? 249\nReferences\nArieli, D., Friedman, V., & Knyazev, G.

Chapter 14\nThe Decision to Move: Being Mobile\nand Being Rational in Comparative\nAnthropological Perspective\nThomas Widlok\nSmall Places, Big Issues\nL ooking at the relationship between rationality and action in the domain of space,\nanthropologists fi rst think of actions such as walking and the related decision to\nmove or to stay. Walking may be considered the prototypical human action in a\nspatial setting. Correspondingly, the decision to move is the prototypical challenge\nto human practical reasoning in the context of moving through space. I wish to con-\ntribute to the topic of rationality and action by reviewing cases of human mobility\nand human orientation in space in some detail. This chapter is based on ethno-\ngraphic work I have carried out with various groups of mobile hunters and gatherers\nover the years, particularly in southern Africa and Australia. Do these remote forag-\ners have anything to offer to understanding decisions that matter most in the current\nworld (regarding the current refugee and migration crisis, for instance)? I propose\nthe following considerations with regard to this question. First, bringing in exam-\nples from far away is a key element in combating the common bias that \u201cthere is no\nalternative\u201d (see Widlok, 2 009a ). A case study exemplifying a very different mode\nof engaging rationality with action underlines that alternatives always exist and that\nit is worthwhile to spell them out clearly and develop them creatively. Second, the\nforager decision to move occupies the opposite end of the spectrum of human pos-\nsibilities in that it focuses on rationality and action in a basic face-to-face setting\nwithout being confounded by effects of larger institutional frameworks. Third, the\nmajor global crises always come down to numerous smaller dilemmas and ques-\ntions that social agents need to solve and that preoccupy them. For most agents the\nT.

Widlok\nlarge issues become problematic only when they translate into everyday decisions\nsuch as whether or not to relocate. In this chapter I therefore adopt the general\nanthropological strategy of tackling big issues in small places: I study the relation\nbetween rationality and action as exemplifi ed by foragers in the Namibian bush.\nA lthough the decision to move may be thought of as basic, many differences\nbetween various foraging groups are ignored in this chapter for the sake of the general\nargument. One uniting feature of forager mobility stands out from the diversity of\ncases, climatic zones, and points in time: All foragers clearly have more than just eco-\nlogical reasons for relocating. Granted, when social agents justify a relocation they\noften mention environmental factors, especially the accumulating dirt at a certain place\nand the anticipated ripening of a desired fruit at another, distant place, but a variety of\nmotives can lead individuals or groups to pick up and move. Ethnographic evidence\nleaves no doubt that reference to environmental conditions is in fact usually a pretext\nto cover up either actual or imminent social confl ict that people want to escape or pre-\nvent (Kent, 1 989; Widlok, 1 999) . Moving is the main strategy for solving disputes.\nWhen ill-feelings or social tensions occur in these societies, the dominant strategy is to\nsplit up and move apart. Hence, there are many more moves than the natural environ-\nment alone necessitates. Even in situations where people are more or less settled, they\nmove their hut within the settlement for purposes of dispute resolution, altering spatial\ncloseness and distance in order to manage s ocial closeness and distance. Out of 89 huts\nin a settlement that I stayed in, less than 18 % remained in the same place in the course\nof a single year (Widlok, 1 999 , p. 10). The challenge is to understand this mobility and\nthese decisions to move, to place them in the larger framework about theories connect-\ning rationality and action. What is the rationality behind these moves? Is it a special\nkind of rationality geared specifi cally to the action at hand? What general lessons\nabout the social embeddedness of decision-making can be drawn?\nState of the Art: Rational Choice Models of Mobility\nT he mobility of hunter-gatherers is not a new fi eld, so this chapter begins with a\nbrief review of some of the existing anthropological models so as to prepare the\nground for my theoretical argument. Probably the best known anthropological\nmodel in this respect is optimal foraging theory (Martin, 1 983 ). It is particularly\ninteresting because its application has not been limited to living hunters and gather-\ners but broadened to cover human behavior more generally. For instance, this theory\nhas served to model human behavior in western-style museum exhibitions (Rounds,\n2004) . The assumption is that visitors to an exhibition optimize their visit by match-\ning elements of high-interest value with low search costs and that there are some\ndo\u2019s and don\u2019ts that result in rules for deciding how long and in what order one\nshould view the items at an exhibition. These rules (search rules, attention rules,\nquitting rules) are aimed not at the best possible solution but at one that is satisfac-\ntory given the environment as it is (p. 404).\nThe original version of optimal foraging theory consists of theorems intended to\nexplain when and how foragers move from one resource to another (see Kelly, 1 995 , 14 The Decision to Move 255\nfor an overview). For example, the theorem of diminishing returns, a central feature\nof optimal foraging theory, holds that staying in a given patch, say a grove or a small\nforest of nut trees that foragers exploit, requires increasing work in the form of\nwalking to nut trees that are ever further away within the patch. At a certain point\nthe additional work generates ever fewer returns. The rational choice solution to the\nproblem, namely, moving camp to another grove, is an initial extra investment, but\nthere is a point at which that investment is compensated for by the decreasing returns\nof the original patch. On the basis of several assumptions about caloric requirements\nand caloric expenditure (Kelly, 1995, pp. 133\u2013134), the optimal foraging theory\npredicts that hunter-gatherers will make a move to another patch when a one-way\nforaging distance reaches 3 km (1.9 miles) on average. This calculation matches\nwhat many reports say about the way in which foragers move. Foragers do not stay\nin a forest until the last nut has been consumed. They walk off much earlier, and the\nmodel can show that this strategy complies with rationality in terms of getting the\nbest deal given a number of available patches. When the gathering of the same\namount of nuts requires ever more effort, the point at which foragers will leave a\ngiven patch of resources will be earlier than the point at which approaching starva-\ntion would necessitate a move. Optimal foraging theory also goes beyond this sce-\nnario, for it takes into account more complicated ones as well. Indeed it must\nbecause many factors are involved (e.g., the number of foragers, the size of a group\nthat shares foraging returns, the variety of storage possibilities, increases or\ndecreases in the desired quantity to forage, and the nature of what is foraged). One\ncould even say that it will eventually be very diffi cult to disentangle causes and\neffects in such a model. What appears to be a given patch may turn out to be the\nvariable outcomes of a combined set of practices.\nAccording to optimal foraging theory, forager movements are rational because\nthey follow calculable thresholds. Of course, foragers do not perform this calcula-\ntion abstractly with graphs. Instead, they are driven by the logic inherent in the\nenvironmental conditions and the ways in which human exploitation interacts with\nthese conditions. Other proximate reasons, such as social tensions, may also be\nconsidered, but they are thought to boil down to the u ltimate causes inherent in the\nlogic of resource exploitation (Kelly, 1 995, p. 140). In other words, in this model\nrationality (as exhibited in the way foragers use scarce resources) is completely\ncontained in the environmental action and ultimately dictated by environmental\nconditions. It is still a sort of rationality but one that mandates certain cultural prac-\ntices by ecological necessity instead of being mandated by cultural rules.\nN onetheless, caution is needed to avoid succumbing to the \u201cfallacy of the rule\u201d\n(Bourdieu, 1 977 , p. 29), which establishes a likely outcome and reinstills it in the\nminds of the agents as something that has caused the outcome. Optimal foraging\ntheory exemplifi es a strongly deductive notion of rationality. It is usually seen as\nadhering a strict, nomothetic, deductive approach. The conditions of a patch and the\ncharacteristics of the forager group exploiting it (e.g., the number of people and\ntheir caloric intake) are defi ned as premises allowing one to derive what the rational\nbehavior in that situation will be, for that behavior necessarily follows. If real-life\nforagers depart from what is predicted, either they are mistaken (and will eventually 256 T. Widlok\ndie out from maladaptation) or the observers are mistaken in their premises and\nneed to adapt the formula (the values making up the graph), but the deductive logic\nof the model at large is not questioned. However, optimal foraging theory may be\nmore productive in combination with abductive reasoning (see below). After all, the\nassumption that foragers move (or shall move) after three days b ecause of the inher-\nent rationality of patch depletion holds only until there are alternative explanations\nthat are more plausible.\nA need for alternative explanations seems evident from a close examination of\nthe ethnographic record that describes the life of foraging groups. As formulated in\na study on Canadian Unuk (Eskimo) hunter-gatherers,\nI n the spring\u2026the spirit of impermanence seemed to infect people, so that, from my point\nof view, they seemed to make the maximum rather than the minimum necessary number of\nmoves. When the fl ooding river forced us uphill, the retreat was always made foot by foot\nas the river rose. For several days we moved camp at least once a day and sometimes\noftener, and always when the water had arrived within inches of our doorsteps....It some-\ntimes seemed as though moving\u2014rearranging the environment\u2014were a form of play for\nthe Eskimos, a pleasure in itself. Whatever the explanation, I never completely shared the\nEskimo spirit....Moves were a nuisance that disrupted my work and, worse, shifted my\nworld as a kaleidoscope shifts its bits of glass, making me uncomfortably aware of the pat-\ntern\u2019s fragility. (Briggs, 1970 , p. 32)\nThis account is but one of the many that have shed doubt on the universal appli-\ncability of optimal foraging theory. As pointed out above, residential moves are not\nguided only by subsistence effi ciency. The acquisition of other raw materials or the\nattraction of other places may also be important (e.g., for fi nding a spouse or for\njoining a ritual). A place\u2019s adverse conditions (e.g., a plague of insects) may be a\ncrucial factor, too. All these aspects are possible social motivations for residential\nmoves (Kelly, 1 995, p. 147). The model of diminishing returns is not a l aw of dimin-\nishing returns. One cannot assume (or deduce) that moves are ultimately due to\nforaging effi ciency. It is possible only to abduct that this foraging effi ciency for food\nresources is a factor that is part of the rationality at work, more in some cases and\nless in others. The implication is not, however, that the aforementioned Unuk\nEskimos (and the other known groups) are acting irrationally. Should one assume\ninstead that they have a kind of primitive rationality, now politically more correctly\ncalled a forager mode of thought? What else may lie behind formulations such as\n\u201cspirit of impermanence\u201d or \u201cthe Eskimo spirit\u201d in the quotation above?\nState of the Art: Decision-Making Probability\nM ost anthropologists studying hunter-gatherers have explored this relativistic alter-\nnative by trying to come as close as possible to achieving what is usually called the\nemic view. It is the approach of basing descriptions of the decision-making process\non locally defi ned criteria, taking the decision-makers to be the experts, and allow-\ning that the rationality of the agents may be very different from that of the observer. 14 The Decision to Move 257\nOne can try to systematically adopt the emic view by drawing on ethnographic deci-\nsion tree modeling (Gladwin, 1 989 ). The textbook example for this theory is not one\nof foragers but rather of American college students and the question of whether or\nnot they go to have lunch at McDonald\u2019s. The technique is that one tries through\ninterviews to elicit as many criteria as possible that are said to be relevant for this\ndecision to go or not to go (criteria such as whether one likes the food, likes the\nservice, knows where a McDonald\u2019s is). Then the criteria are sorted according to a\ndecision-making tree, which is subsequently tested against the decisions that the\ncollege students actually report when being asked where they have lunch. That is,\nthe model should account for most of the decisions observable in real life. Failure to\ndo so would indicate that a criterion is either missing from or misplaced in the\ndecision-making tree. As a product of inductive reasoning, the tree makes predic-\ntions on the basis of probability and takes account of local values and decision-\nmaking criteria. If some of the decision-making tree\u2019s underlying criteria and values\nare subject to change (e.g., with age), decision-making trees will likely differ from\none cultural or subcultural group to the next. One can thereby test and substantiate\na relativistic hypothesis through the inductive reasoning of probability.\nAgain, this model of ethnographic decision trees works well in some instances.\nIt apparently holds in particular for small-scale farmers and their choices of which\ncrop to grow and when. Stated differently, it seems to work in settings of small\nhomogeneous groups with decisions of seasonal regularity. It does not work as\nnicely with foragers, however, as I found when trying to employ this method with\nSan (\u201cBushmen\u201d) in Namibia. The individuals there are not homogenous in their\nresponses, and it seems that the decision to move camp is not considered an instance\nthat can be looked at through the lens of probability but rather only in personal\nterms as it were. The question that I asked in my fi eld research was not about going\nto McDonald\u2019s (Namibia being one of the world\u2019s few countries without\nMcDonald\u2019s). Instead, I asked what locals thought about attending secondary\nschool, which for them means moving away from home, attending boarding school,\nor staying with distant family. There was no problem in eliciting an ethnographic\ndecision tree. Everyone agreed that secondary education was important and that\nchildren should take this opportunity if they had found someone to pay their fees,\nbuy them a school uniform, and offer them a place to stay. There was also agreement\nthat discrimination by teachers or fellow students, food shortage at the place one\nwas staying, or similar problems should not be permitted to make the children quit\nschool. Despite this consensus, however, individuals constantly, and often for highly\nidiosyncratic reasons, deviated from the outcome predicted by the model.\nI t emerged in this research that the social agents concerned refused to see major\npersonal choices (such as moving away from home to attend school) as decisions to\nbe taken from a perspective of nowhere in particular. The agent was not regarded as\nreplaceable by anyone else. There was no notion of \u201call things being equal,\u201d which\nwould have allowed for a neutral weighing of alternatives. This personalization of\ndecisions applied to the manner in which the agent is perceived, the fact that a deci-\nsion is seen to be analogue rather than digital, and the degree to which individual 258 T. Widlok\ndecisions are seen as incongruent with those of others. In the following paragraphs\nI examine these aspects in more detail.\nF irst, the San place a high social premium on allowing individuals to make their\nown decisions, and this applies to children from an early age. Parents leave it to their\nchildren to choose whether or not to go to school. The teachers, who are exclusively\nfrom other ethnic groups with a farming background, tend to be outraged about this\npractice and shake their heads. When they go to see the parents to ask them why a\nchild has run away from school or did not attend, the parents would usually respond,\n\u201cGo and ask the child. She [He] is sitting right here.\u201d Whereas the teachers feel that\nthe parents have a duty to make their children go to school (and that the children\nhave a duty to obey their parents), San parents and children see it as a matter of\npersonal autonomy for the pupil to decide. Even if one is generally in favor of\nschooling, this preference is trumped by the self-determination of the individual for\nhis or her own life.\nSecond, San parents and children alike strongly emphasize the need to be able to\nrevise decisions. Decisions are made as one goes; they are not thought of as on/off\nswitches or inexorable if-then mechanisms. This characteristic, too, clearly surfaces\nin intercultural contact when understanding breaks down. Employers (and anthro-\npologists for that matter) who think they have struck a medium- or long-term agree-\nment that, for example, obliges local people to produce tools in exchange for money\nor to attend school for an extended period are constantly frustrated. The local people\noften decide to abandon the plan or their cooperation halfway through, even if it\nmeans that they do not receive the money or diploma they had originally envisioned.\nThis frustration by outsiders has been translated into a stereotype casting San peo-\nple as unreliable and unstable. From a San perspective, however, it is a consequence\nof avoiding decisions that cannot be revised in the light of new information and\nevents. They do not wish to make a decision once and for all at the beginning of an\naction but rather only once the action has been completed.\nT hird, social agents in the San cultural settings seem to be aware at all stages of\nthe decision-making process that they are living only that one life and that decisions\nsuch as splitting up or joining up again are not repetitions of one another, although\nthey may occur frequently. In discussions of past or future decisions, there is a pre-\noccupation with particulars. Even if everyone has agreed in principle on the criteria\nfor a sound decision on schooling, for instance, the underlying assumption is that\none small thing can be suffi cient to allow the shared hierarchy of criteria to topple.\nA minor thing of this sort could be, for instance, a brief exchange of words with a\nteacher or another student, some insult, or some minor problem with food. What\nseem to be excuses to the outside, such as the fact that one had no soap with which\nto wash, no shoes to wear, or no decent food that morning, are acceptable contingen-\ncies that distinguish one decision from another. Just as personal lives are ultimately\nunique because they are subject to particular differences, so are individual decision-\nmaking processes (see, Widlok, 2 009b , for a discussion of moral decision-making).\nDecisions may be faulty with respect to principles but comprehensible and justifi -\nable in terms of the particulars. 14 The Decision to Move 259\nG iven the high premium on individual autonomy, a stance representing a proba-\nbilistic model of reasoning becomes inimical to understanding the personal and\nsituational aspects of the decisions in this ethnographic case. Arguably, the decision\nto move is felt to be a personal, not a rational, one if the term r ational decision is\nunderstood to mean a choice arrived at from no particular perspective that allows\none to weigh aims and means in a detached manner. By contrast, the default assump-\ntion is that the decision to move is made at a particular time by a particular person\nin a particular evolving setting. I thus realized that there would always be cases\nunaccounted for by any of these decision-making trees despite a degree of agree-\nment on the criteria for the decision to move from one location to another. In prac-\ntice the predictive value of these tree models is precarious: Because of everyday\nlife\u2019s imponderabilia, decision-makers in these settings are ready to reconsider their\ndecision at any time. These decisions are seen as uniquely affecting personal lives,\nso people refuse to judge them aloofl y as being instances of a general type. Instead,\nthey highlight the personal, ultimately unique setting. A calculus of probability does\nnot work, for the underlying presupposition of such a calculus is that one such deci-\nsion is interchangeable with other decisions of the same type and that the two alter-\nnatives can be weighed against each another. However, one should be cautious to\ntreat this observation as evidence of the rare or exotic nature of decision-making in\nthis particular group of foragers. In fact, many observations in modern western set-\ntings also fi t the description of personalized decisions (Fuchs, 2 008 , p. 342), espe-\ncially when considering fundamental, irreversible decisions of one\u2019s life that do not\ncomply with ideas of stock-taking (Spaemann, 1 996 , p. 126).\nThe Pragmatics of Decision-Making\nAt this juncture I take the opportunity to recapitulate the two models presented so\nfar for understanding forager mobility. Optimal foraging theory is generally used as\na deductive model that underlines the necessity to move, that is, the assumed exi-\ngencies that ultimately dictate the decisions that foragers make. Ethnographic deci-\nsion tree modeling, by contrast, has been employed primarily to generate inductively\nwhatever local models of decision-making may exist to offer agents (and observers)\nprobable outcomes and probable criteria that constitute a decision-making process.\nOptimal foraging theory, one could say, links all rationality to outcomes, whereas\nethnographic decision trees separate out different rationalities and their resulting\nactions. I have suggested that neither of these models can fully account for the eth-\nnographic evidence of forager mobility. There appear to be patterns in the ethnogra-\nphy, but the arguments involved are neither those of necessity nor of probability but\nrather of p lausibility .\nThe need is for a less problematic model that links rationality and action in a\nprocedural view of rationality. I suggest going beyond the traditional models of\nstrict deductive or inductive logic, strict in the sense that they claim truth outside the\nconversations and interactions that unfold in the social context of the reasoning in 260 T. Widlok\nquestion. As a fi rst step it is important to have an idea of what the social context\nlooks like in this case.\nD ecision-making in a forager group such as the San of Namibia does not follow\nquasi-legal or rigid procedures. Instead, participants and observers alike can derive\ndecisions only from the continuous discourse that allows them to make decisions\nbased on plausibility. Their conversational and interactional style is a particular one\nof repetitions, overlaps, and echoing in everyday talk. Consensus is achieved as the\ninterlocutors repeat and echo some opinions or arguments and leave out others. This\nkind of exchange enables people to make intelligent guesses about what they and\nothers will be doing next. The strategy requires that everyone be allowed to join in\nthe conversation while avoiding prominence (and exposure) as an individual voice\nof authority. Similar strategies for achieving consensus have been observed else-\nwhere, as in Aboriginal Australia (Liberman, 1 985 , p. 104). Taken together, they\ndiffer not only from the dominant western-style conversation and interaction but\nalso from the aggressive and self-assertive style found in many societies, including\n\u201cBig Man societies\u201d in Melanesia or segmentary systems in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe following excerpt is one of the best known examples from the !Kung San,\nwho are neighbors of the Hai//om San with whom I have worked and who have a\nsimilar interactional practice of overlapping and echoing talk: \u201c\u2018Yesterday,\u2019 \u2018eh,\u2019 \u2018at\nDeboragu,\u2019 \u2018eh,\u2019 \u2018I saw old/Gaishay.\u2019 \u2018You saw old/Gaishay.\u2019 \u2018eh, eh.\u2019 \u2018He said that\nhe had seen the great python under the bank.\u2019 \u2018EH!\u2019 \u2018The python!\u2019 \u2018He wants us,\u2019\n\u2018eh, eh, eh,\u2019 \u2018to help him catch it\u2019\u201d (Marshall, 1 976 , p. 290).\nA mong the San, people often talk in parallel, and there is no formal conclusion\nto this talk. Instead, it is made up largely of \u201ctopographical gossip\u201d which invokes\nplaces and movements but without any formal decisions (Widlok, 1997, p. 321).\nApart from this feature of particular conversational forms, the reasoning involved\nallows for unpredictable events in that nonhuman and apparently nonanimate fea-\ntures of the environment are expected to come in as well, infl uencing the direction\nthat a decision may take. When people in this community refrain from long-term\nplanning, it is not that they are incapable of doing so but rather that they allow the\nstate of the environment or of other persons to prompt or trigger their decisions at\ncertain stages of the process. Detailed studies on the process of tracking animals\nhave shown that anticipating and predicting the movement of an animal that one is\npursuing involves a continuous creation of new hypotheses in the light of new infor-\nmation added to the incomplete picture of tracks and other signs on the ground. This\nactivity also involves a constant dialogue between trackers who are allowed to\nmaintain their diverging views as events unfold (Liebenberg, 1 990 , p. 108). Making\ndecisions about moving (or indeed any other decision) entails a similar process of\nencouraging heterodoxy in views, keeping the decision open until very late in the\nprocess and ultimately always allowing individuals to maintain their own diverging\nview. In residential mobility this tolerance of diverging views is facilitated by the\nfact that packing up one\u2019s belongings is easy; it allows for fast and fl exible reactions\neither to join a party that leaves or simply stay put.\nHaving briefl y described the mode of reasoning ethnographically, one may now\nask whether there is a more general model that can help reintegrate these observations 14 The Decision to Move 261\ninto a comparative theory on rationality and action. It turns out that the plausibility\nmode of decision-making that has been observed in fi eld research with foragers\nappears to have its counterpart in current strands of the theory of reasoning. More\nspecifi cally, the philosophy of science has a growing body of literature by scholars\nseeking to defi ne rationality not as a narrow logical concept based on necessity\n(deductive inference) or probability (inductive inference) but rather as reasoning\nbased on plausibility, or what is called abductive inference (see Flach & Kakas,\n2000 ; Josephson & Josephson, 1994 ; Walton, 2004 ). In other words, there is at least\na third form of reasoning that is both widespread in everyday decision- making and\ncapable of accounting for the complexity of decision-making among mobile\npeople.\nA bduction is the generation of hypotheses based on the evaluation of alternatives\n(Walton, 2 004 ). People witnessing a surprising event (e.g., the light going out, for-\nagers relocating yet again) creatively seek an explanation that would make sense of\nit, would make it appear to be a matter of course. When the light goes out, one\nworks backward as it were, usually fi rst suspecting that the bulb is burned out. If a ll\nlight bulbs are observed to have gone out, one may plausibly infer that a fuse has\nblown. If the lights are out not just in one\u2019s own house but in all the houses on the\nblock, then one may suspect a wider power failure as the cause, and so on. None of\nthese inferences is necessary, deductively valid, or probable in a strict sense. There\nare many possible reasons for the light bulb(s) having gone out, and some may have\nthe same estimated probability (e.g., burned-out bulbs and blown fuses). What peo-\nple do when reasoning abductively is tap into their background knowledge and\nselect the most plausible explanation in a procedural fashion. Given the premium\nthat the San place on personal autonomy, a forager of that community is constantly\nprompted to make sense of the sometimes erratic movements of other elements in\nthe environment, whether fellow foragers, game animals, or erratic rainfall. The\ndecision by the forager to move or stay rests on the background knowledge of per-\nsons and places that he or she has encountered. It is a type of reasoning that does not\nfollow strict rules of necessity, the regularities of majority rule, or predictable sea-\nsonality but emerges by deleting the less plausible alternatives in the course of pro-\ntracted social decision-making. Abduction is a way of generating an emerging\ncertainty (not truth) that identifi es the least defective alternative given the group\u2019s\nincomplete knowledge.\nA bduction is, of course, a prevalent form of reasoning. When making sense of\nactions, humans usually combine deductive, inductive, and abductive arguments\u2014\neach type of logic having its distinct function (Walton, 2004, p. 86). They all feature\nin scientifi c explanation, including that in the natural sciences (see Agar, 2013 ). But\nunlike deduction and induction, abduction reminds one that explanation and knowl-\nedge formation as a whole are dialogical and procedural. Processes of knowledge\nformation do not follow a fi xed set of linear rules. Selection of the most plausible\nhypothesis is a process of dialogue with both objects that play a role (e.g., bulbs and\nnatural processes) but also with other humans with whom one is engaged and who\nmay support or doubt one\u2019s hypotheses. 262 T. Widlok\nFor a long time, abduction was taken to be a defective form of deductive reason-\ning, for it was frequently defi ned as a case of affi rming the consequent (e.g., where\nthere is smoke, there must be fi re). The idea of abductive reasoning seems to have\nbeen marginalized together with everyday cognition (Lave, 1 988 ) as exemplifi ed by\nthe reasoning of foragers (Liebenberg, 1 990 ). But the strength of abductive infer-\nence is evidently not in an isolated statement (a syllogism) but rather in a creative\nand explanatory mode of logical reasoning that establishes the best available\nhypothesis at a certain point in an open, explanatory dialogue that invites additional\ntesting and evaluation. In other words, this strength is less likely to show up in\nexperimental isolation than in ethnographic cases. Understanding reasoning in pro-\ncesses means recognizing that it matters where actors are in a complex decision-\nmaking process. Abduction is a plausible short-cut, especially in the early stages of\ntrying to make sense of a situation or an action. But there may be situations (e.g., the\ntracking of animals) in which it is useful to cultivate this mode of reasoning for as\nlong as possible in the problem-solving process. Similarly, I argue that this mode of\nreasoning is important t hroughout many decision-making processes, not just in their\ninitial, creative stages.\nTrying to explain why someone has moved is, I suggest, very much an abductive\ndialogical exercise that entails observation of natural givens (e.g., the distribution of\nresources and the number of people involved) but also interaction with other agents\nwith whom one is in constant communication (and whose motivations one may\nabduct if they are not made explicit). Moreover, I suggest that making a rational\ndecision on when to move is also a form of abductive reasoning. Determination of\nthe best time to move (and the best destination to move to) is typically n ot based on\nnecessity or probabilistic calculus but rather on broad background knowledge,\ninformed guesses as it were, in dialogue with others, and not only fellow human\nbeings. Moreover, I suggest that abductive inference can provide an account that\nlinks reasoning and action into a coherent whole that can also explain cultural varia-\ntion. The recognition of cultural variation in abductive reasoning is the fi nal point of\nthis chapter.\nVariation in Reasoning\nThe case material presented in this chapter can enhance a general model of abduc-\ntive inference pertaining to dialogical knowledge formation as it emerges in con-\ntemporary philosophy and logic. An explanation of variation surfaces when one\nrealizes that both the type of dialogue through which reasoning takes place and the\npartners with whom it takes place are likely to vary across situations. The prototypi-\ncal forms that the dialogue of explanation takes in the philosophical literature are\nthose between teacher and student, between judge or prosecutor and witness, and,\nmore recently, between a user and an expert system of artifi cial intelligence through\nan interface (Walton, 2 004, p. 88). None of these three examples resembles that of\na group of foragers determining whether they should move or not. 14 The Decision to Move 263\n\u2022 Forager decision-making on any matter (as exemplifi ed by the San ethnography)\ndiffers greatly from the typical teacher\u2013student relationship. As Hoymann (2 010 )\nreported, asking inquisitive questions is not encouraged among foragers. Young\npeople are expected to learn by observing and trying or by being told at the\nappropriate moment, not by prompting adults as in a typical teacher\u2013learner\nsituation.\n\u2022 C ommunal talk among foragers is also very different from the hierarchical set-\nting of court proceedings in that communal talk among foragers has no fi xed\nleadership roles and no clearly delimited sequences or groups of speakers.\nIndeed, their communication makes heterodoxy possible and sometimes even\nencourages it. People in these settings may stick to their decisions and explana-\ntions. Because they are supported by others, they also have \u201cthe freedom to be\nwrong at times\u201d (Liebenberg, 1990, p. 162). When hunting, for instance, indi-\nviduals may maintain rather different views as to what the tracked animal is\nlikely to do next. When it comes to moving camp, anyone may decide not to go\nwith the majority, but there are other options, such as being on one\u2019s own or split-\nting up the group.\n\u2022 Expert systems today commonly take the form of multiple digital circuits of yes/\nno decisions. Research specifi cally on questions established that San speakers\nhave a preference for not posing yes/no questions (Hoymann, 2010) . In contrast\nto speakers of many other languages, they do not seem not to use requests for\nconfi rmation that would press the interlocutor to use yes/no. In contradiction to\nthe most typical form of questioning used in expert systems (Widlok, 2 008 ), they\navoid cornering their interlocutors and seem to take care not to infringe the\nautonomy of others. When they draw on the knowledge of others, it seems very\nunlike the process of consulting an expert machine.\nW hat the forager cases suggest is that the dialogic nature of reasoning is compat-\nible with a variety of equally competent forms of dialogue: inquisitive, circumspect,\ndigital, open, bilateral, multilateral, unilinear, and multistrand. In fact, I argue that\nthe different practices of dialogue may produce different forms of reasoning and a\nspectrum of rational outcomes. It is neither one rationality only nor anything goes\nbut rather a limited spectrum of possibilities describable in terms of the dialogical\npractices in which reasoning takes place.\nT he form of dialogue is not the only entity that may be broader than what the\nphilosophical literature usually covers; the dialoging partners, too, may have a\nwider range. Reasoning is usually thought to take place either in an experimental\nmode between individuals and nature (as in much of the research on infants) or\namong investigating humans pursuing their own individual decision-making strate-\ngies. The aforementioned example of light bulbs that had gone out could include\ninteraction with objects (e.g., shaking the bulb, checking the fuses) or interaction\nwith other subjects (e.g., the neighbors, people in the room, or the electric utilities\ncompany). The peculiarity of the case about foragers on the move is that the bound-\nary between nature and other persons is drawn in a particular way and differently\nfrom what nonforagers may expect. Personalization does not necessarily mean that 264 T. Widlok\nnatural objects are treated as persons, although such anthropomorphization occurs\nas well. In many Australian examples, Aborigines do not just talk about the land and\nits features but may address it directly, as when expressing their respect or even their\npity when the land has not been cared for properly. In Aboriginal Australia, a typical\nindication of a country1 that has not been cared for is that no one has set fi re to it and\nthat it should be visited (see Rose, 1 995 ). Cases differ as to what is subject to person-\nalization. It could be animals, various supernatural beings, sacred places or\u2014most\ncommonly\u2014a combination thereof (as in the Australian case of totemic Dreaming\nbeings that involve animals, superhuman creative beings, and places). The main and\nmore general point is not that a certain set of beings (animate or inanimate) can fea-\nture as personalized subjects, as partners with whom one may reason. Rather, it seems\nthat anything can become personalized if it is treated as a person, by which I mean that\nthis s ome-thing is taken not as a thing, an instance of a category, but rather as a unique\nsubject with which one interacts. By contrast, many phases of decision making in\npresent day economics, for instance, entail processes of depersonalization and isola-\ntion. The procedures of reasoning are regarded not as a dialogue between persons but\neither as the interaction between users and computational systems or as abstract sys-\ntemic processes devoid of personal relations, aspirations, and apprehensions.\nT herefore, both the style of the dialogue and the partners in the dialogue may be\nmuch more variable than is apparent. Beyond this case of foragers on the move, it\nmay be wise to consider procedural rationality broadly enough to allow inclusion of\nvariations in how procedures unfold as particular forms of dialogue and how part-\nners in this dialogue are personalized or depersonalized. Rationality would thereby\ncease to be a purely mental phenomenon. Instead, it would reside partially in forms\nof social communication and interaction as well as in features of the environment\nthat western philosophy and science tend to discount as irrelevant but that can be\nimportant triggers or partners in the procedure of reasoning. Why does abductive\nreasoning describe my ethnographic cases so aptly? I do not think its capacity to do\nso is coincidental. Rather, it is because this mode of inference is not a stand-alone\nmode but one that is tied closely to the interacting, corporeal, and relational social\nbeings that we humans are.\nReferences\nAgar, M.

Chapter 15\nContinuity and Change in Older Adults\u2019\nOut- of- Home Mobility Over Ten Years:\nA Qualitative-Quantitative Approach\nHeidrun Mollenkopf, Annette Hieber, and Hans-Werner Wahl\nBoth the ability and the opportunity to move about constitute essential requisites to\nolder adults\u2019 independent living and societal participation. The ability\u2013that is the\nfundamental physical capacity\u2013to move is a basic human need and essential to per-\nsonal health (e.g., Heikkinen et al., 1992; U.S. Department of Transportation, 2003).\nIn that sense, declining mobility has been understood predominantly as a physical\nhealth and geriatric issue. For decades, a broad range of research has been con-\nducted to understand, among other things, the increasing decline in mobility perfor-\nmance, including decrements in sensory abilities and sensorimotor integration, loss\nof motor control and voluntary strength, slowing motor action and speed of process-\ning. shrinking range of motion and flexibility, and decreasing ability to stabilize\nposture (e.g., Fozard, 2003; Fozard & Gordon-Salant, 2001; Ketcham & Stelmach,\n2001; O\u2019Neill & Dobbs, 2004; Owsley, 2004; Spirduso, 1995).\nThe ability to move about\u2014and by extension to travel\u2014is required to navigate\nfrom point A to point B, to seek out places of subjective interest or that are essential\nto meeting daily material needs, to participate in cultural and recreational activities,\nand to maintain social relations, familiar habits, and life styles\u2014in short, to live an\nautonomous life for as long as one\u2019s mental and physical capacities permit one to\nparticipate actively in society (Schaie, 2003). At the same time, age-related changes\nsuch as physical, cognitive, and/or sensory impairments and social losses may limit\nolder adults\u2019 possibilities of ambulating and venturing out.\nA multitude of studies in transportation research have provided rich statistical\ndata on older adults\u2019 actual travel behavior, usually defined as a movement in time\nH.

Mollenkopf et al.\nand space, measured in terms of trips or journeys and reported in standardized diary\nforms (e.g., Centre d\u2019\u00e9tudes sur les r\u00e9seaux, les transports, l\u2019urbanisme et les\nconstructions publiques [CERTU], 2001; Clarke & Sawyers, 2004; European\nConference of Ministers of Transport [ECMT], 2000; Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development, 2001; Rosenbloom, 2001; Schaie & Pietrucha,\n2000; Transportation Research Board [TRB], 1988). It is true that findings differ\ndepending on national peculiarities, but general tendencies and structures corre-\nspond in some salient aspects: In general, travel of older adults has clearly increased\nfor about two decades. However, the older individuals are, the less they tend to\ntravel, mainly due to declining health and sensory impairments. Older individuals\nwith a driver\u2019s license and access to a private automobile travel more than those\nwith no car at their disposal. Because the current generation of older women has less\neducation, a lower income, and less likelihood of having a driver\u2019s license than men\nof the same age, it is not surprising that they use public transportation more than\nmen do, whereas older men use the car more often, take more trips, and travel more\nmiles than older women (see e.g., Banister & Bowling, 2004; ECMT, 2000;\nMarottoli et al., 1997; Mollenkopf et al., 2002; Owsley, 2002; Rosenbloom, 2004).\nDespite the abundant information available from these research strands, the func-\ntional approaches to mobility often neglect the key mobility concerns of older adults\n(Alsnih & Hensher, 2003; Banister & Bowling, 2004; Gabriel & Bowling, 2004;\nHildebrand, 2003; Mollenkopf, Marcellini, Ruoppila, & Tacken, 2004a; Schlag &\nSchade, 2007; Siren & Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004). The meaning individuals attri-\nbute to mobility and their experiences when venturing out are only scarcely assessed.\nHowever, mobility can be for its own sake and not just as a derived demand\n(Mokhtarian, 2005). Case studies conducted in four European cities showed that\nmobility means much more to older adults than the mere covering of distance\n(Mollenkopf et al., 2004a). In this context the attraction or deterrence of the natural,\nsocial, and built environment can play a crucial role (Banister & Bowling, 2004;\nHolland et al., 2005). Motivational, cognitive, or personality aspects also play an\nimportant role in their decisions to go out. Moreover, in modern society, mobility is\nassociated with highly appreciated goals like freedom, autonomy, and flexibility\n(Cobb & Coughlin, 2004; Handy, Weston, & Mokhtarian, 2005; Lash & Urry, 1994;\nMollenkopf, Marcellini, Ruoppila, Sz\u00e9man, & Tacken, 2005; Rammler, 2001).\nOlder adults are members of current societies and therefore are affected by these\nsocieties\u2019 Zeitgeist, values, and expectations.\nOnly in recent years has the focus shifted to more subjective and motivational\naspects of travel and driving behavior. A series of recent studies showed that older\nadults\u2019 ability to move about and to pursue outdoor leisure activities contributes\nsignificantly to their autonomy, social participation, and subjective quality of life\n(Banister & Bowling, 2004; Cvitkovich & Wister, 2001; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ballesteros,\nZamarr\u00f3n, & Ru\u00edz, 2001; Marottoli et al., 1997; Mollenkopf et al., 2004a;\nMollenkopf, Baas, Kaspar, Oswald, & Wahl, 2006; Owsley, 2002; Pochet, 2003).\nSatisfaction with one\u2019s ability to get around, to pursue leisure activities and to travel 15 Continuity and Change 269\nwere significant determinants of quality of life in a study comparing the impact of\nsubjective appraisal of different life domains on satisfaction with life in general\n(Mollenkopf et al., 2006). In a study focusing on elderly people\u2019s own definitions of\nquality of life, Farquhar (1995) found that the ability to go out more was cited as\nimproving quality of life, whereas being housebound detracted from quality of life.\nSimilar findings were reported by Coughlin (2001) with respect to the significance\nof transportation, albeit mostly related to being able to drive a car. Banister and\nBowling (2004) found that a sense of optimism and positive expectations of life\nconstitute a main building block for the transport dimension of older adults\u2019 percep-\ntions of quality of life. Psychological variables such as control beliefs and the indi-\nvidual importance attributed to being out also played a role in characterizing groups\nof older adults who differed in their out-of-home mobility patterns (Mollenkopf\net al., 2004b).\nAltogether, these findings offer some evidence that functional necessities, on the\none hand, and modern values and individual needs on the other, strongly comple-\nment one other. In this chapter we wish to further pursue a comprehensive under-\nstanding of older adults\u2019 out-of-home mobility by taking up and integrating the\ndiverging concepts of mobility in an environmental gerontology perspective (Wahl,\nMollenkopf, Oswald, & Claus, 2007; Wahl & Oswald, 2010). Proceeding from this\napproach, which asserts that an individual\u2019s well-being is influenced by how well\nenvironmental resources match personal needs, we propose that mobility and related\nappraisals are determined by personal (health-related and psychological) and socio-\neconomic factors as well as by environmental (structural) conditions and features of\nthe person-environment interaction. Findings of the European MOBILATE project\nlargely confirmed this fundamental view of mobility in cross-sectional as well as\nlongitudinal analyses over the 5-year observation period from 1995 to 2000\n(Mollenkopf et al., 2005).\nThis chapter presents data based on an extended observational period up to 2005,\nfor a total observation time of 10 years. We assume that during that time the men\nand women who had participated in the 1995 study might have experienced age-\nrelated health impairments, critical social life events (e.g., death of a spouse), and\nchanges in their local environments, all of which can seriously jeopardize the out-\ndoor mobility of the older individual.\nThe goals of our work are threefold. First, we describe 10-year trajectories in\nterms of stability and change of various key qualifiers (e.g., satisfaction) of out-of-\nhome mobility such as out-of-home mobility in general, public transportation, out-\nof- home leisure activities, and travel. Second, we link and undergird these\ntrajectories with the explicit consideration of meaning imposed on mobility, per-\nceived changes in mobility and perceived reasons for change, as well as satisfaction\nwith life in general. Third, we will explore interindividual differences in stability\nand change. We strongly believe that only a mix of methods, in other words, qualita-\ntive and quantitative, allows these goals to be addressed in a comprehensive\nmanner. 270 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nThis study started with an initial inquiry on older adults\u2019 out-of-home mobility car-\nried out in four European cities in 1995 (Mollenkopf et al. 2004a). The German\nparts of the investigation\u2014on which the present study is based\u2014were carried out in\nthe cities of Mannheim (western Germany) and Chemnitz (eastern Germany). Both\nof them are middle-sized industrial cities with diversified settlement structures and\npublic transportation (tram and bus lines) as well as rail connections and national\nroads. The quantitative part of the study included N = 804 persons aged 55 years or\nolder, which resulted from a randomly drawn sample of addresses from the popula-\ntion registers of the Municipality Registration Offices of Chemnitz and Mannheim.\nThirty-five of the participants were selected for additional in-depth interviews\nbecause they showed a particularly low or high degree of mobility. Five years later\n(2000), 271 respondents from the original sample could be reassessed in an initial\nfollow-up as part of the project entitled \u201cMobilate: Enhancing Outdoor Mobility in\nLater Life\u201d funded by the European Commission in the Fifth Framework Programme\n(Programme Area no. 6.3, Project QLRT-1999-02236). The comparative findings of\nthis international and interdisciplinary project, including data from Finland,\nGermany, Hungary, Italy, and the Netherlands, have been published elsewhere (e.g.,\nMollenkopf et al., 2003, 2005, 2006; Mollenkopf, Ruoppila, & Marcellini, 2007).\nAnother 5 years later (2005), a third assessment took place in the German cities and\nresulted in N = 82 participants, or approximately 30 % from the first follow-up and\n11 % from the original sample. Hence, the present study covers these participants\nover a 10-year period.\nWell-trained interviewers from the USUMA research institute (Berlin) con-\nducted the German interviews in 1995 and 2000. The 2005 Chemnitz interviews\nwere also conducted by USUMA interviewers, and the interviews in Mannheim\nwere conducted by the project staff.\nSample Description and Drop-Out\nThe original German sample of N = 804 participants was disproportionately strati-\nfied by age and sex, resulting in almost equal subcategories of men and women (50\n% each) and two age groups (51.2 % respondents aged 55\u201374 years and 48.8 % aged\n75 years or older). The composition of the age groups changed from the first assess-\nment in 1995 to the second in 2000 (61.3 % aged 55\u201374 years and 38.7 % aged 75\nyears or older) and even more dramatically from the second to the third assessment\nin 2005 (84.2 % aged 55\u201374 years and 15.8 % aged 75 years or older). By shifting\nthe age group limit by 10 years and drawing on the participants\u2019 actual age in 2005,\nwe again obtained two groups of the same size (50 % each of respondents 65\u201374\nyears old and 75 years old or older). 15 Continuity and Change 271\nThe reasons for dropping out of the sample were documented in standardized\nprotocols. Because of the long period of time, the most frequent reasons were the\ndeath of the former participants or a deterioration in their health (almost 20 % each).\nOther dropouts were due to refusals to continue participation and failure to locate or\ngain access to them. Logistic regression analysis based on data from the 2000 study\nindicated that age (OR = .94*),1 education (OR = 1.59*), and the number of trans-\nport modes used in 2000 (OR = 1.27**) seemed to influence participation in 2005.\nProbability of participation increased with younger age, higher education, and\ngreater variety of transport modes used. The level of education among the\nparticipants can be regarded as relatively high, with almost half of them having\nearned a standard or advanced degree.\nAs Table 15.1 shows, the average age of the 82 individuals who could be assessed\nover the 10-year interval was 75.2 years at T3, with 50 % of these participants\nbelonging to the younger age group (65\u201374 years old) and 50 % to the higher age\ngroup (75 years old or older). Women and men were almost equally represented in\nthe sample (48 % and 52 %, respectively). Most of the participants were married (66\n%) and living in multiperson households (68 %). Approximately one in four (24 %)\nhad lost their spouse. Satisfaction with their financial situation decreased on average\nfrom M = 7.7 in 1995 to M = 7.0 in 2005. Similarly, albeit at a lower level, subjective\nhealth was rated less positively 5 and 10 years after the first assessment (M = 6.9 and\n6.7, respectively, compared to M = 7.3 in 1995).\nInstruments\nIn order to guarantee the comparability of the answers from all assessments, each\nfollow-up retained main aspects of the instruments used in the first wave of data\ncollection, that is, the standardized Outdoor Mobility Survey 1995 and the semis-\ntructured interview guidelines for the in-depth 1996 interviews (Mollenkopf et al.,\n2003, 2004a). Both of the instruments included questions on objective factors as\nwell as subjective ratings concerning important prerequisites for mobility such as\nhealth and socioeconomic status (individual factors), social networks, and the phys-\nical environment (environmental factors). The survey questionnaire was partially\nbased on methods used in previous studies, such as the Finnish Evergreen project\n(Heikkinen, 1998), the Nordic Research on Ageing (NORA) study (Avlund, Kreiner,\n& Schultz-Larsen, 1993; Heikkinen, Berg, Schroll, Steen, & Viidik, 1997), and the\nGerman Welfare Survey (Zapf & Habich, 1996). Satisfaction with mobility, with the\nability and opportunity to pursue leisure and other important life activities, and with\n1 Odds Ratio is a way to quantify how strongly the presence of a variable A increases or reduces the\nrisk that another variable B is present or absent. Risk is calibrated in this analysis such that 1.0\nmeans no change in the risk of B appearing when A is present. An OR of .94* means in our case\nthat being younger significantly reduced the risk that a participant in our study would drop out. *\n= significant at the .05 level; ** = significant at the .10 level (tentatively significant). 272 H.

In the second and third\nwave of assessment, additional questions were posed concerning changes between\n1995 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2005 with respect to factors possibly affect-\ning mobility.\nData Analyses\nAll interviews of the third assessment were tape recorded. After transcription of the\nqualitative portions of the interviews, content analysis (Mayring, 2003) was used to\nextract the main aspects and to group them into conceptually meaningful categories. 15 Continuity and Change 273\nThe statements quoted in the results section represent especially characteristic and\nmeaningful examples from the extensive amount of material. All names were\nchanged to comply with data protection acts.\nQuantitative data records were analyzed using the SAS statistical package (SAS\nInstitute, Inc.), and the analysis was kept simple because of the rather small sample\nsize. Statistical testing consisted mostly of t-tests and chi-square tests, with the\nusual levels of p < .05* applying.\nIn this study we focus particularly on finding ways to combine quantitative and\nqualitative data so that each data-analytic component complements the other.\nResults\nOverview\nWe start with findings addressing the subjective meaning of mobility over time, fol-\nlowed by perceived changes in mobility and perceived reasons for change. We then\nreport on trajectories of satisfaction with key areas of outdoor mobility as well as\nthe course of satisfaction with life in general. Finally, we explore the interindividual\nvariability over time based on case analyses selected to underscore some of the\nextremes inherent in the data. Results presented in the first step are completely\nqualitative, whereas quantitative and qualitative data analyses are interwoven in the\nremaining steps.\nSubjective Meaning of Out-of-Home Mobility Over Time\nThe terms in which our participants in 2005 expressed what out-of-home mobil-\nity meant to them were nearly the same as those they had used 10 years earlier\n(see Table 15.2). As in our earlier studies (Mollenkopf & Flaschentr\u00e4ger, 2001;\nMollenkopf et al., 2004a), we were able to categorize the elicited semantic mate-\nrial into seven categories: out-of-home mobility as a basic emotional experience;\nphysical movement as a basic human need; mobility as movement and participa-\ntion in the natural environment; mobility as a social need; mobility as an expres-\nsion of personal autonomy and freedom; mobility as a source of stimulation and\ndiversion; and mobility as a reflective expression of one\u2019s life force. For most of\nthe respondents, mobility included more than one aspect, and some of the various\nfacets are tightly interwoven, reflecting the multidimensional meaning of mobil-\nity. Taken all together, it seems that out-of-home mobility has maintained more\nor less the same bandwidth and richness of meaning over the 10-year observa-\ntional period. 274 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nTable 15.2 The meaning of out-of-home mobility: Main categories in sample verbal citations\nYear Category\nThe overarching meaning of mobility as a basic emotional experience, as essential for the\nquality of life or for life itself\n1995 \u201cJoy!\u201d; \u201cIt\u2019s everything, it\u2019s life!\u201d\n2005 \u201cA part of quality of life\u2014yes, that\u2019s a really considerable part of quality of life!\u201d\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s getting out that makes up life, isn\u2019t it?

When age is applied as the distinguishing\nfactor, it becomes evident that mobility worsens mainly after the 75th year of life.\nAlmost 30 % of the older age group stated a decline in 2000 compared to just\n24.4 % of the younger age group. Five years later, the proportions differed even\nmore starkly (50 % and 20 %, respectively). Men and women showed only minor\ndifferences in this regard.\nThe perceived reasons for change in mobility can be attributed to both personal\nand environmental circumstances and are centered mostly on the theme of loss and\ndeterioration. Declining health, in particular, but also financial constraints; the\nnecessity of caring for a family member; difficulties with using a bicycle, car, or\npublic transport and with coping with traffic conditions in general; and barriers in\nthe built environment tend to result in mobility restrictions. The following quota-\ntions illustrate how older people experience their declining mobility and what\nimpacts it has on their daily life.\nI can no longer move about in the open countryside the way I used to. Five years ago I still\nwent fishing, but I can\u2019t any more. If I go to the river, I risk being alone. And if I were to\npass out, maybe I wouldn\u2019t fall into the water, but I might lay there a long time. (Mr. Nolte,\n88 years old) 276 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nDespite the prosthesis I feel pain, and this restricts my walking. And when I come home\u2014\nnot in winter, but in the spring and summer\u2014I have to undress, and my wife gives me a\nshower. (Mr. Walter, 86 years old)\nI don\u2019t have a car anymore and have to go everywhere on foot. There are only public modes\nof transport like the tram. But I have no further options. I would have to ask my son to take\nme somewhere. (Mr. Ober, 77 years old)\nWell, as I said, I can no longer use my bike and I need some help for heavy household tasks\nmore often nowadays. (Mrs. Diffler, 68 years old)\nOf course, my whole situation has changed because of this task [caring for her husband,\nwho suffers from dementia]. I myself, if I were independent, if I did not have to care for\nsomeone, I could walk, I could travel, and I could do anything I want. (Mrs. Hansen, 75\nyears old)\nSatisfaction with Key Areas of Mobility and Satisfaction\nwith Life in General Over Time\nOut-of-Home Mobility\nThe appraisal of one\u2019s possibilities for mobility\u2014assessed on an 11-point scale\nranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (very satisfied)\u2014included all means of\ngetting where one wants to go, either on foot, by bicycle, by car as a driver or pas-\nsenger, or by public transport. In general, the older adults\u2019 satisfaction with their\nmobility options over the 10-year interval was high (Table 15.4). Toward the third\nassessment, however, it decreased from an average rating of M = 8.4 (T1) to M = 8.3\n(T2) and M = 7.8 (T3). This tendency was true of male participants in particular.\nMen and women aged 75 years or older also expressed less satisfaction with their\nmobility options than did younger elders (65\u201374 years old). As expected, older\nadults who reported a decline in their mobility options in the second and/or third\nassessment were significantly less satisfied with their mobility in general than peo-\nple whose mobility had not changed.\nPublic Transport\nAverage satisfaction with public transport increased over the 10-year interval among\nthe people who used it (M = 7.2 in 1995 to M = 8.1 in 2000 and M = 8.2 in 2005; see\nTable 15.5). Women were less satisfied than men in all assessments. When respon-\ndents with mobility impairments were distinguished from respondents without such\nlimitations, satisfaction of the impaired decreased only slightly between the second\nand third assessment (from M = 7.9\u20137.2). Older adults who had not reported mobil-\nity restrictions showed a remarkable increase in their appraisal of public transport. 15 Continuity and Change 277\nTable 15.4 Satisfaction with mobility possibilities: Two German cities\nYear\nCharacteristics of the sample 1995 2000 2005\nM SD M SD M SD\nN = 82 8.4 1.9 8.3 1.9 7.8 2.1\nAge group (in years)\n65\u201374 (n = 41) 8.3 2.0 8.4 2.0 8.2 1.8\n75 and older (n = 41) 8.5 1.8 8.1 1.9 7.4 2.3b\nGender\nFemale (n = 39) 7.9 2.1 7.8 2.4 7.6 2.5\nMale (n = 43) 8.8 1.6 8.7 1.4 8.0 1.8b\nPerceived changes in mobility 2005\nBecame worse (n = 28) 8.6 1.6 7.8 2.3a 5.8 2.4b\nRemained the same (n = 54) 8.3 2.1 8.5 1.7 8.7 1.2\nNote.

Hence, it is no surprise that changes in these domains\neventually occurred most in people who reported mobility restrictions (61 % in both\ndomains compared to 33 % change in leisure and 49 % change in travel among the\nnonimpaired). The main reasons for decreasing activities were the same as for 278 H.

This means, however, that half of older adults\nwith impairments still travel, albeit to less distant destinations and for a shorter\nperiod than previously.\nWith regard to satisfaction with one\u2019s opportunities to pursue leisure activities\nand travel, the evident tendency was similar to that pertaining to satisfaction with\nmobility options. On average, and by subgroups, there was a significant decrease\nwithin the 10-year interval. Satisfaction with leisure activities decreased from M =\n8.1 in 1995 to M = 7.9 in 2000 and M = 7.5 in 2005 (Table 15.6).

Women were somewhat less satis-\nfied than men in all assessments, but again the decrease in satisfaction did not reach\nstatistical significance. There was almost no difference between the younger and\nolder age groups. However, when individuals with and without mobility impair-\nments were distinguished, differences that support the notion of a close relationship\nbetween mobility and quality of life became obvious. Whereas satisfaction of older 280 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nadults without mobility limitations even increased over time (1995: M = 7.9; 2000:\nM = 8.5; 2005: M = 8.5), life satisfaction of mobility-impaired individuals dropped\nsignificantly between both the first and second assessment and over the 10-year\ninterval (1995: M = 8.6; 2000: M = 7.5; 2005: M = 7.1).\nExploration of Interindividual Variability Over Time in a Case\nContrast Approach\nIn this section we again examine the key areas of out-of-home mobility from the\nabove perspective and contrast selected extreme cases in their divergent trajectories.\nWe use the total sample as a platform for overall comparison and provide back-\nground material and quotations, and figures to improve understanding of this diver-\nsity. In addition, Fig. 15.1 provides an illustration of interindividual differences in\nmobility as people age.\nIn comparison with changes in satisfaction of the total sample, the changes in\nsatisfaction of Mr. Lechner (80 years old) and Mrs. Dahlmann (87 years old) mirror\ncharacteristic developments over the 10-year interval (Fig. 15.1, panel a). Mr.\nLechner\u2019s satisfaction with his out-of-home mobility options had decreased between\nthe years 1995 (M = 10.0) and 2000 (M = 9.0) because of a severe illness. He recov-\nered between the second and the third assessment and was happy about his new\nfreedom: \u201cThanks to my recovery it is possible to put more strain on my body, and\nI make the most of it for trips, hiking, and long-distance trips.\u201d\nTogether with his wife he walks at least five to six kilometers every day and does\nall his shopping and errands on foot or by public transport because they have no car\navailable. He is still able to actively pursue his hobbies\u2014cooking, painting, and\nforming wood and other materials\u2014and because he experiences no impairments he\nsaid, \u201cHence, I can be quite satisfied\u201d (M = 9.0).\nThe course that Mrs. Dahlmann\u2019s satisfaction took was quite different. Her\nmobility-related satisfaction had increased between 1995 (M = 7.0) and 2000 (M =\n9.00). However, she suffered from late effects of a cancer surgery and had to undergo\noperations on her veins and hip joint between the second and third assessment.\nBecause the latter surgery was not completely successful, her mobility is severely\nrestricted. She can still reach shops and services in the neighborhood on foot.\nHowever, longer trips are no longer possible: She gave up driving and is not yet\naccustomed to using public transport.\nInside activities are only a little limited\u2014of course, my range is not large and that makes a\nbig difference. But outdoor mobility and out-of-home activities are restricted....Actually,\nbecause of pain I walk with the aid of a cane anyway, and I feel extremely unsure as a\nresult....The movability of my feet has decreased, and when I step down a curb or something\nsimilar I have to pay careful attention....In the past I loved hiking, even in high mountain\nareas\u2014but this is no longer possible. My activities are limited to what I have to do: shop-\nping and what is necessary for daily living. 15 Continuity and Change 281\nFig. 15.1 Case examples to illustrate inter-individual differences in intra-individual changes in\nmobility-related indicators and general life satisfaction (Note: Satisfaction was assessed on an\n11-point scale ranging from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (very satisfied). Design by authors)\nAgainst this background, Mrs. Dahlmann\u2019s satisfaction with her possibilities of\nmoving about decreased sharply in the third measurement (M = 3.0). Together, the\ntwo examples point to large individual differences behind the general tendencies\n(Fig. 15.1).\nThe diverging individual conditions and experiences and the resulting evalua-\ntions regarding satisfaction with public transportation are again underscored with\ntwo examples (Fig. 15.1, panel b). Mrs. Faust, 77 years old, has taken daily care of\nher husband, who has been living in a nursing home. Her limited possibilities of\nmoving about were reflected by a rather low satisfaction with public transport 282 H. Mollenkopf et al.\n(1995: M = 5.0). When her husband passed away between the second and third\nassessment, she was able to recover from this difficult life event mainly by pursuing\nout-of-home activities. Because she never obtained a driver\u2019s license, she has taken\nmost of her trips on foot or by public transport. Because of her severe visual impair-\nment, she has difficulties orientating herself when moving about on foot. For several\nyears now public transport modes have therefore grown in significance to her\nbecause they allow her to maintain her activities (2000: M = 8.0; 2005: M = 9.0).\n\u201cEverything by bus or tram,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept to the baker\u2019s. I walk there because\nof my visual impairment and\u2014well, indeed, you are no longer entirely agile with\nadvancing age.\u201d\nMr. Nolte is 88 years old and seriously impaired in his physical mobility.\nNonetheless, in the first and second assessments he was still quite satisfied with\npublic transport (1995: M = 9.0; 2000: M = 8.0). However, between the second and\nthird assessment, his state of health worsened to the extent that he has depended\never since on help to be able to leave the house, so his satisfaction dropped to zero\n(M = 0.0). He complained:\nMy problem is that I no longer have the strength to walk to the tram stop by myself\u2026\nbecause I am physically handicapped. I am no longer satisfied with the tram because I can-\nnot use it anymore!\nSatisfaction with one\u2019s possibilities for travel decreased significantly over time\neven among nonimpaired elders, whereas satisfaction with leisure opportunities\nstayed almost the same in the respective intervals. There were again great individual\ndifferences, however, as seen in the examples of Mrs. Pfeil and Mrs. Weimann (Fig.\n15.1, panels c and d).\nThe options for leisure activities and travel for 72-year-old Mrs. Pfeil had\nimproved substantially in the last several years before the third assessment, not\nbecause of her health but because of changes in her social network. Caring for her\nalmost 100-year-old mother required a great deal of time and energy and made other\nactivities almost impossible. The situation changed when her mother passed away\nin 2002. \u201cSince retiring\u2026, I often take short trips, short cultural trips. Longer travel\nwas not possible as long as my mother was living. I always went to see her. This has\nimproved a lot now.\u201d Mrs. Pfeil was able to slowly resume her previous hobbies and\ntraveling.\nWell, I occupy myself with my computer, with my video recorder. I have been doing this for\nsome time and have built up a little video library. I read\u2014there just isn\u2019t time enough! I\nlisten to music, actually everything beautiful....I watch TV, especially cultural programs....\nMoreover, I visit the museum. In fact, outside the home I exercise, bowl, attend the theater\nand concerts, major events such as the one in the park recently.\nHer wide range of activities contributes substantially to both her satisfaction with\npossibilities of pursuing outdoor leisure activities (2000: M = 6.0; 2005: M = 8.0)\nand travel (2000: M = 5.0; 2005: M = 7.0).\nMrs. Weimann, 85 years old, is experiencing quite the opposite. Her husband\u2019s\nstroke has so severely restricted his mobility and reactions that she has to support 15 Continuity and Change 283\nhim in almost all his activities of daily living. This situation heavily impacts her\nown and shared activities.\nLeisure\u2014I am rather satisfied in this regard....I still can go out with the dog; and at home,\nof course, I can do cooking, baking, gardening. Elsewhere, I play golf and bridge\u2014but the\nlatter is more in winter....What is hard is that I can no longer play golf with my husband,\nthat we can no longer take bicycle tours together, and that we cannot go on holiday\nanymore....I cannot take him with me. Even if he had a wheelchair, he would not be able to\nmove around.\nConsequently, her satisfaction with leisure activities, which had the highest rating\n(M = 10) in 1995, fell to M = 8.0 in 2000 and to M =7.0 in 2005. Regarding satisfac-\ntion with travel, the decline was even worse (1995: M = 9.0; 2000: 0.0; 2005: 1.0).\nWith respect to individual differences in general life satisfaction (Fig. 15.1, panel\ne), we refer again to Mrs. Pfeil, whose satisfaction with outdoor activities and travel\nrose remarkably when she no longer needed to care for her mother, a task that had\nprevented her from pursuing desired activities. The same holds true for her satisfac-\ntion with life in general. Starting from a very low rating (M = 5.0) in the first assess-\nment in 1995, her subjective quality of life also increased when her radius of action\nwidened again (2000: M = 8.0; 2005: M = 10).\nWell, as long as I worried about my mother\u2014I mean, even though she was very old she was\nstill my mother. You are so worried, it was like a cloud hovering over you. We watched her\ndecline for four years, and we did a lot of grieving. Meanwhile, I have gotten over it and can\nsay, \u201cThis has changed.\u201d And this burden\u2014it is a burden, whether you want to admit it or\nnot\u2014this has changed.\nHence, the positive changes in Mrs. Pfeil\u2019s out-of-home options and her related\ndomain-specific satisfaction and subjective quality of life are due to changes in her\nsocial commitments.\nBy comparison, the example of 86-year-old Mr. Walter represents those men and\nwomen whose satisfaction with life in general decreased with advancing age, par-\nticularly because of health and mobility impairments. Although Mr. Walter was\ncompletely satisfied with his life in the first assessment (M = 10) and almost equally\nsatisfied 5 years later (M = 9.0), this appraisal decreased in the third assessment (M\n= 7.0), although he did not suffer from severe impairments. Instead, he reported a\ngeneral decline that most aging people have to cope with: \u201cBecause movability has\ndiminished and sensitivity to pain has increased\u2014thus we are somewhat less satis-\nfied, I would say.\u201d\nAt the same time he is an example of the strength and adaptability older people\ndevelop in order to meet everyday hardships and to maintain satisfying activities\ndespite mobility restrictions. \u201cBut yes, we struggle through, there is no whining and\nsniveling\u2026. When the weather is reasonable we sit outside in the garden, and\nmostly we are four to five more people; that\u2019s fun.\u201d 284 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nDiscussion\nThe longitudinal investigation of aging adults\u2019 out-of-home mobility, carried out in\ntwo German cities over an observation interval of 10 years, provided the opportu-\nnity to assess and describe how individual, social, and environmental changes affect\nolder men\u2019s and women\u2019s options of moving about and what effect these changes\nhave on their satisfaction in different mobility-related domains.\nOne initial key finding is that out-of-home mobility\u2014the opportunity and ability\nto move about outside one\u2019s home and get to places one wants or needs to go\u2014\nkeeps its remarkable significance as one grows older. Individual statements and the\ncorrelation between mobility and subjective evaluations indicate the manifold\nmeanings of out-of-home mobility and, in particular, its positive quality. The mean-\nings include aspects as basic as zest for life, autonomy and freedom, the sense of\nbelonging, and just the pleasure of moving. These results are in line with findings\nreported in previous research (Banister & Bowling, 2004; Coughlin, 2001;\nFern\u00e1ndez-Ballesteros et al., 2001; Holland et al., 2005; Mollenkopf et al., 2006),\ndemonstrating that being able to go out, be active, and meet other people can result\nin positive feelings. Consequently, we agree with Banister and Bowling (2004),\nwhose view on older people\u2019s travel and quality-of-life issues is wider than that\nconventionally found in transport research.\nThe results of the follow-up assessments also correspond with the well-\ndocumented risk of declining health and movability with advancing age (Fozard &\nGordon-Salant, 2001; Heikkinen et al., 1997; Ketcham & Stelmach, 2001; Spirduso,\n1995), conditions that lead to decreasing out-of-home mobility (CERTU, 2001;\nMarottoli et al., 2000; OECD, 2001; O\u2019Neill & Dobbs, 2004). Study participants\nreported decreasing mobility and activities in all related domains. The decline in\nmobility finds expression in the older adults\u2019 subjective evaluation of their possibili-\nties of getting out and about. In general, their satisfaction with possibilities for gen-\neral mobility and with their opportunities to pursue leisure activities and travel over\nthe 10-year interval is high, albeit with substantial individual differences. Moreover,\nsubjective evaluations decreased in the total group among the persons aged 75 years\nor older, and in particular among individuals with mobility impairments in the third\nassessment. Women showed slightly lower satisfaction scores than men with respect\nto most of the domain-specific aspects of mobility, perhaps because of the fact that,\namong the present generations of older people, basic preconditions of mobility are\ngenerally more favorable for the \u201cyoung\u201d old and for men (e.g., Banister & Bowling,\n2004; ECMT, 2000; Rosenbloom, 2004; Siren & Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004).\nHowever, the general decline of out-of-home mobility over the 10-year interval was\nsimilar.\nThe development of satisfaction with public transport differs from this general\npattern\u2014it increases among all subgroups except for the users whose mobility had\nbecome worse between the second and third assessment. This positive appraisal can\nbe explained in part by real improvements in the local transport systems of the cities\nunder study. Moreover, if the nearest stop is within easy reach, the vehicles are 15 Continuity and Change 285\neasily accessible, and the connections are reliable and cheap, the public modes of\ntransportation can be used as an alternative once previously used modes such as\ndriving a car are no longer possible.\nApart from health decrements, environmental circumstances, including techno-\nlogical deterrents, taxing traffic conditions, and obligations such as caring for a\nfamily member, were found to interfere severely with the older adults\u2019 options of\nventuring out. The effect of such restrictions actually extends over all activities\noutside the home, so it is no surprise that mobility limitations affected the respon-\ndents\u2019 subjective quality of life as well. Although average life satisfaction of the\ntotal group remained almost the same over the 10-year interval, individuals whose\nmobility had worsened over time were not only markedly less satisfied than their\nnonimpaired contemporaries with their possibilities of being mobile and active but\nwere also less satisfied with life in general. Together with the differential courses of\ndomain-specific satisfaction among individuals whose venturing out was limited\ndue to family obligations, these findings suggest a strong relationship between out-\nof- home mobility and overall life satisfaction. They also support our view that older\nadults\u2019 quality of life is largely affected by mobility aspects that promote self-\ndetermination, flexibility, and the freedom to get where one wants and to do what\none wants to do.\nThe results of our previous European studies (Mollenkopf et al., 2005, 2006)\nback up this supposition. The most important variable in almost all domain-specific\nappraisals and satisfaction with life in general was the ability to move about.\nMoreover, participation in a great diversity of outdoor activities and/or the satisfac-\ntion with one\u2019s opportunities to move about and pursue desired activities contrib-\nuted substantially to both satisfaction with life in general and emotional well-being.\nSimilarly, English studies found that poor morale became increasingly prevalent\namong older individuals with worsening mobility (Holland et al., 2005).\nIn addition, the findings can partly qualify the so-called satisfaction paradox,\naccording to which high adaptability of older individuals allows them to maintain a\nhigh level of well-being despite unfavorable or aggravating life conditions\n(Staudinger, 2000). Obviously, such adaptability no longer has this effect if funda-\nmental needs such as the need to be mobile and active are concerned. Means and\naverage numbers are apt to obscure remarkable individual developments and related\nevaluations. Hence, only a differentiated view that considers the various conditions\nof older adults\u2019 living circumstances allows for valid statements about their\nout-of- home mobility. In this respect, the longitudinal perspective of our study and\nits combination of qualitative and quantitative methods proved particularly useful.\nIn terms of limitations of this study, it should be stressed that the individuals who\nwere still able and willing to participate in this research after 10 years are a positive\nselection. Another limitation of this study is that we cannot distinguish the extent to\nwhich the findings are attributable to regional conditions. Studies comparing\nregional differences (e.g., Holland et al., 2005; Mollenkopf et al., 2005, 2006) sug-\ngest that a range of mobility factors play an equally important role in older adults\u2019\nquality of life under diverging national and regional conditions. At the same time\nsome mobility components showed differential significance depending on the area 286 H. Mollenkopf et al.\nunder observation. This observation points to the necessity of considering regional\npeculiarities as well as individual aspects in order to fully understand the respective\nrelation between mobility options and quality of life.\nThe findings confirm what is known from our basic environmental gerontology\napproach (Wahl & Oswald, 2010; Wahl et al., 2007), that an older individual\u2019s phys-\nical, social, and technical resources, as well as the structural resources provided by\na region or locality, constitute basic prerequisites for moving about. The strong\nimpact that the ability to pursue fulfilling activities has on the satisfaction with life\nreflects the importance that a congruence between personal and environmental\nresources has for an individual\u2019s well-being. At the same time, the respective cir-\ncumstances seem to be mediated by the subjective evaluation of one\u2019s own possi-\nbilities and prevailing environmental conditions.\nWe believe that our findings have relevance for policy measures and further\nresearch alike. On the one hand, more detailed knowledge is necessary to improve\nthe understanding of the nature, meaning, and significance of specific aspects of\nout-of-home mobility for older adults\u2019 quality of life. In this respect, compiling\nsociological, behavioral, and transportation approaches could provide further\ninsights. On the other hand, the available data already show how crucial it is to pro-\nmote the mobility of older adults as a means of enabling them to take part in mean-\ningful activities at locations outside their homes through various structural,\ntechnological, and social measures of prevention and support in order to maintain\ntheir quality of life and well-being.\nAcknowledgment We thank the Eugen-Otto-Butz Foundation, Germany (www.butz-stiftung.\nde), which was kind enough to provide the funding for the second follow-up in 2005 and, hence,\nthe long-term perspective of this study.\nReferences\nAlsnih, R., & Hensher, D.

The Klaus Tschira Stiftung\nIn 1995 physicist Dr. h.c. Dr.-Ing. E. h. Klaus Tschira (1940\u20132015) created the\nGerman foundation known as the Klaus Tschira Stiftung. This organization is one\nof Europe\u2019s largest privately funded non-profit foundations. It promotes the advance-\nment of natural sciences, mathematics, and computer science and strives to enhance\nthe understanding of these fields. The focal points of the foundation are \u201cNatural\nScience\u2013Right from the Beginning,\u201d \u201cResearch,\u201d and \u201cScience Communication.\u201d\nThe involvement of the Klaus Tschira Stiftung begins in kindergartens and contin-\nues in primary and secondary schools, universities, and research facilities. The\nfoundation champions new methods in the transfer of scientific knowledge, and\nsupports both the development and intelligible presentation of research findings.\nThe Klaus Tschira Stiftung pursues its objectives by conducting projects of its own\nbut also awards subsidies after approval of applications. To foster and sustain work\non selected topics, the Stiftung has also founded its own affiliates. Klaus Tschira\u2019s\ncommitment to this objective was honored in 1999 with the \u201cDeutscher Stifterpreis,\u201d\nthe award conferred by the National Association of German Foundations.\nThe Klaus Tschira Stiftung is located in Heidelberg and has its head office in the\nVilla Bosch (Fig. 1), once the residence of Carl Bosch, a Nobel laureate in chemis-\ntry. www.klaus-tschira-stiftung.de\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017 291\nP.
