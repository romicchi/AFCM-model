SKIMMING AND ACTIVE READING\nDo you ever feel like you spend way too much time reading? Do you have trouble determining which parts of\na text are the most important? Do you wish you could collect information from books in a quicker and more\nefficient way? If so, consider skimming the next time you sit down to read a text.\nA. What is skimming?\nSkimming is a strategic, selective reading method in which you focus on the main ideas of a text. When\nskimming, deliberately skip text that provides details, stories, data, or other elaboration. Instead of\nclosely reading every word, focus on the introduction, chapter summaries, first and last sentences of\nparagraphs, bold words, and text features. Skimming is extracting the essence of the author\u2019s main\nmessages rather than the finer points.\nB. Why skim?\nYou need the \u201cbig picture\u201d or main points when you\u2019re reading.Even if you\u2019re going to do a more\ndetailed reading of the text, skimming as a form of previewing can help you better comprehend what\nyou read. Knowing when and how to skim will help you become a more efficient, strategic reader. You\u2019ll\nbecome better at determining what parts of the text are most important. There may also be times when\nyour professor wants you to understand the big picture, not all of the little details. In these cases,\nskimming helps you understand the overall points of the text and its relevance to your course without\nbogging you down.\nYou need to make the most of your time.Sometimesyou don\u2019t have time to do everything. With\nskimming, you\u2019ll be able to cover vast amounts of material more quickly and save time for everything\nelse that you have on your plate. Maybe you don\u2019t have time to finish your reading before class, but\nskimming will help you get the main points and attend class much more prepared to maximize in-class\nlearning.\nYou need to review a text you have read before.Skimmingis also an efficient way to refresh your\nmemory of large amounts of material before an exam. Skimming a text that you have already read helps\nyou recall content and structure.\nC. Skimming Methods\nBeginnings & endings:Read first and last sentencesof paragraphs, first and last paragraphs of major\nsections, and introductions and summaries of chapters.\nWheat vs. chaff:Read only the amount of text necessaryto determine if a section presents a main idea\nor support for a main idea.\nVisual & verbal cues:Watch for signal words and phrasesthat indicate an author\u2019s direction (e.g.,\nhowever, although, moreover, in addition to). Things to focus on while skimming:\n\u25cf Introduction and conclusion\n\u25cf Chapter\/section summaries\n\u25cf First and last sentences\n\u25cf Titles, subtitles, and headings\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 14 \u25cf Bold words\n\u25cf Charts, graphs, or pictures\n\u25cf End of chapter review questions\nD. When to Skim\nThere are certain texts that lend themselves to skimming better than others. It is typically less beneficial\nto skim novels, poetry, and short stories or texts that do not have text features such as tables of content,\nchapter or section summaries, headings, bold words, pictures, and diagrams. Non-fiction texts, like\ntextbooks, journal articles, and essays are typically full of these kinds of text features and are more\nsuited for skimming.\nSkimming can also be a good tool for conducting research and writing papers. Typically, when\nresearching or writing, you will not need to read every word of every text closely, but will benefit more\nfrom skimming while evaluating your sources or identifying information important to your work.\nFinally, know your context. There may be some texts that you are better off reading closely and\nthoroughly. Some professors specifically tell you that they include small details from the textbook on\nexams. You may have some classes that are just difficult to understand, and you may find that reading\nclosely helps you comprehend concepts better. Before skimming, spend some time thinking about your\nclasses, professors, and needs to determine if you have any texts you may need to read more closely.\nE. Active Reading Strategies\nWhen skimming, it\u2019s important to continue to useactivereading strategies. This keeps your brain active,\nengaged, and focused, and helps you understand and retain information better and longer.\nHere are a few effective active reading strategies to pair with skimming:\nSet a purpose for reading.Instead of approachingthe text as something you just have to get\nthrough, identify a purpose for this reading. What do you want to get out of it? Why are you\nreading it? Keep this purpose in mind as you read.\nPreview.Look through the text before starting toread and focus on headings, illustrations,\ncaptions, highlighted items, end of chapter summaries, etc. These features give you an idea of\nthe main concepts of the text and what you should focus on while skimming.\nMake a prediction.Right after previewing, make aprediction about what you think the\nchapter or section is going to be about.\nActivate prior knowledge.Make a list of what youalready know about the topic and what you\nwant to know about it. Identify and write down any questions you have.\nAnnotate.Instead of copying down copious notes fromthe book, jot down brief notes and\nthoughts (in your own words) in the margins of the text or in a notebook. PDF viewers, such as\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 15 Adobe Acrobat and Preview, also let you add notes directly on the page of a digital text. Other\npossibilities include note-taking apps such as Evernote, OneNote, or Google Keep.\nSummarize the main ideas.After a section or page,stop and write a 1-3 sentence summary in\nyour own words. This keeps your brain engaged and ensures you are comprehending what you\nread.\nGenerate questions.Ask and write down questions thatyou have as you read the text and\/or\nquestions that you would ask a class if you were the instructor. Try using different levels of\nquestions.\nWorks Consulted\nHolschuh, J. and Nist, S.

ANNOTATING TEXTS\nA. What is annotation?\nAnnotation can be:\n\u25cf A systematic summary of the text that you create within the document\n\u25cf A key tool for close reading that helps you uncover patterns, notice important words, and\nidentify main points\n\u25cf An active learning strategy that improves comprehension and retention of information\nB. Why annotate?\n\u25cf Isolate and organize important material\n\u25cf Identify key concepts\n\u25cf Monitor your learning as you read\n\u25cf Make exam prep effective and streamlined\n\u25cf Can be more efficient than creating a separate set of reading notes\nC. How do you annotate?\nSummarize key points in your own words.\n\u25cf Use headers and words in bold to guide you\n\u25cf Look for main ideas, arguments, and points of evidence\n\u25cf Notice how the text organizes itself. Chronological order? Idea trees? Etc.\nCircle key concepts and phrases\n\u25cf What words would it be helpful to look-up at the end?\n\u25cf What terms show up in lecture? When are different words used for similar concepts?\nWhy?\nWrite brief comments and questions in the margins\n\u25cf Be as specific or broad as you would like\u2014use these questions to activate your thinking\nabout the content\n\u25cf See thishandout on reading comprehension tips forsome examples\nUse abbreviations and symbols\n\u25cf Try ? when you have a question or something you\nneed to explore further\n\u25cf Try ! When something is interesting, a connection,\nor otherwise worthy of note\n\u25cf Try * For anything that you might use as an example\nor evidence when you use this information.\n\u25cf Ask yourself what other system of symbols would\nmake sense to you.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 17 Highlight\/underline\n\u25cf Highlight or underline, but mindfully.Check out ourresource onstrategic highlightingfor\ntips on when and how to highlight.\n\u25cf Use comment and highlight features built into pdfs, online\/digital textbooks, or other\napps and browser add-ons\n\u25cb Are you using a PDF? Explore its highlight, edit, and comment functions to\nsupport your annotations.\n\u25cb Some browsers have add-ons or extensions that allow you to annotate web pages\nor web-based documents.\n\u25cb Does your digital or online textbook come with an annotation feature?\n\u25cb Can your digital text be imported into a note-taking tool like OneNote, EverNote,\nor Google Keep? If so, you might be able to annotate texts in those apps.\nWhat are the most important takeaways?\n\u25cf Annotation is about increasing your engagement with a text.\n\u25cf Increased engagement, where you think about and process the material then expand on\nyour learning, is how you achieve mastery in a subject.\n\u25cf As you annotate a text, ask yourself: how would I explain this to a friend?\n\u25cf Put things in your own words and draw connections to what you know and wonder.\nThe table below demonstrates this process using a geography textbook excerpt (Press\n2004):\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 18 Click to return toTable of Contents Return to beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 19 Click to return toTable of Contents Return to beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 20 D. A common concern about annotating texts: It takes time!\nYes, it can, but that time isn\u2019t lost\u2014it\u2019s invested.\nSpending the time to annotate on the front end does two important things:\n\u25a0 It saves you time later when you\u2019re studying. Your annotated notes will help speed up exam\nprep, because you can review critical concepts quickly and efficiently.\n\u25a0 It increases the likelihood that you will retain the information after the course is completed.\nThis is especially important when you are supplying the building blocks of your mind and\nfuture career.\nOne last tip:Try separating the reading and annotatingprocesses! Quickly read through a section of the\ntext first, then go back and annotate.\nWorks consulted:\nNist, S., & Holschuh, J. (2000). Active learning: strategies for college success.

USING GOOGLE DOCS\nWe will be using Google Docs instead of Microsoft Word for most of the research process in this class.\nKnowing how to fully take advantage of Google and its apps is not only beneficial for this class but also\nthe future: besides being able to access your work from any computer, they are useful for collaboration\nand easy sharing. However, you do have to spend some time getting used to them and their features.\nRemember, do all of your work in the Google Doc! Do NOT copy and paste from a Word document!\nA. Formatting\nYou will need to format your Google Doc just like you would a Word document, including Times New\nRoman, 12-point font, 1\u201d margins, and double spacing. Largely, the buttons are in the same location and\nhave the same symbols, but here\u2019s what you should do.\n1. Changing Font Style 2. Changing Font Size\nTo change the font style, go to the toolbar at the To change font size, click on the arrow next to the\ntop. The default font for Google is Arial, so scroll number to the right of the font style. Change the\ndown to change it to Times New Roman. number to 12.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 24 3. Changing the Margins\nDepending on the country of origin of your\ncomputer (and your Google account), your Doc\nmay already have the correct margins. To check\nand\/or change the margins, click onFilethen\nPage setup\u2026\nIf necessary, change the size of the margins to 1\ninch.\n4. Changing Line Spacing\nJust like with a Word document, there are a couple different ways to change the line spacing in a Google\nDoc. The easiest is to go to the toolbar again, click onFormat,Line spacing, and thenDouble. Unlike\nWord, you do not have to remove the extra space between paragraphs!\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 25 B. Sharing\nYour instructor has already shared your Research Paper Google Doc with you, but you will need to share\nit with your classmates in the future for peer reviewing. Sharing is easy and the best way to collaborate\nonline in real time.\nSTEP 1:Click on the blue \u201cSHARE\u201d button in the\nupper righthand corner of the webpage. It also\nhas the picture of a lock on it.\nSTEP 2:Click on \u201cAdd more people\u201d to enter your STEP 3:Change the share settings. Google\u2019s\nclassmate\u2019s email address. default is \u201ccan edit;\u201d change the settings to \u201ccan\ncomment\u201d by clicking on thepencil icon\u2019s\ndropdown menu. That way, your classmate can\nadd comments to your document, but they can\u2019t\naccidentally change or delete anything in your\ndocument. (We\u2019ll talk about commenting next.)\nSTEP 4:You can add a note to your classmate if youwant. Otherwise, click \u201cSEND\u201d!\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 26 C. Commenting\nBecause your classmates will only have the ability to comment on your document, this will be one of\nyour only means of communication on the document itself. (You can also use the GChat feature, but we\nwon\u2019t discuss that here.) Let\u2019s learn how to make and resolve comments.\nSTEP 1:Highlight the bit of text that you\u2019d liketo comment on. This could be as small as a punctuation\nmark or a space or as large as a paragraph. Normally, plan on highlighting only a couple of words or a\nsentence.\nSTEP 2:You have three ways to\nadd a comment.\na. After you highlight part of the\ntext, a circle with a plus sign\ninside a dialogue bubble will\nappear in the margin. Click on\nit.\nb. After you highlight, go to the\ntoolbar at the top of the page\nand click onInsertand then\nComment.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 27 c. After highlighting the text, hold downctrl + alt + m(Windows) or\u2318+ Option + m(Mac) at the\nsame time.\nA dialogue box will appear in\nthe margin. Type your comment\nand click \u201ccomment\u201d to finish.\nAn email will be sent to everyone who shares the document every time a comment is posted.\nA. To Reply to a Comment\nClick on the dialogue box that\ncontains the comment. A\ndialogue bar will appear below\nthe comment with the word\n\u201cReply.\u201d Click inside the bar and\ntype your comment. When you\nare finished, click \u201cReply\u201d to\npost it.\nAn email will be sent to everyone who shares the document every time a reply is posted.\nB. To Resolve a Comment\nIf the comment is no longer\napplicable, or you have fixed\nthe error, you may want to\nresolve (or finish) the\ncomment. To do so, go to the\ndialogue box that contains the\ncomment you\u2019d like to resolve.\nIn the upper righthand corner\nof that dialogue box is a\nbutton that says \u201cRESOLVE\u201d.\nClick that button, and the\ncomment and any replies will\ndisappear.\nAn email will be sent to everyone who shares the document every time a comment is resolved.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 28 D. History\nGoogle records every change that is made to your document. This feature is useful for you in case you\nwant to go back and see a previous version of your essay; this feature is useful for your instructor\nbecause he\/she can tell when, what, and how many changes were made and (most importantly) who\nmade those changes. If you want to check your document\u2019s history, follow these steps.\nSTEP 1:Above the toolbar, next toHelp, is a linkthat says, \u201cAll changes saved in Drive.\u201d (If yourecently\nmade changes, or Google is in the middle of autosaving your document, it will say \u201cSaving changes.\u201d\nWait until it says the former.) Click on the link. This will take you to the document\u2019s history.\nYou will see additions to your documenthighlightedin a specific color assigned by Google to your user\nname. Things that you have deleted will behighlightedas well ascrossed out.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 29 If someone has added something to your document under a different user name, it will appear in a\ndifferent color. (This should not be the case, asyou will share your document with commenting\nprivileges only.)\nSTEP 2:If you want to revert back to an earlier draft,or just want to see what specific edits were made\nwhen, click on the appropriate time stamp on the right-hand side of the screen.\nSTEP 3:To go back to editing your document, clickon the arrow in the upper lefthand corner of your\nscreen.\nGood luck! If you have any further questions, Google also has a wonderful tutorial that can walk you\nthrough these features and more. Happy writing!\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 30 6. GIVING AND USING WRITER FEEDBACK: PEER AND SELF-REVIEWS\nAs mentioned in the previous section, you can use Google Docs to comment on your own or a\nclassmate\u2019s writing. This is an effective way to provide feedback when reviewing a classmate\u2019s writing.\nA. Peer Review Strategies\nPeer reviewing, having a classmate read your work and provide feedback, is an important part of the\nwriting process. Check outthis PPTfor more informationabout the benefits of peer reviewing, both to\nthe writer and to the peer reviewer, and several effective strategies for peer review.\nPAUSE AND REFLECT\nOnce you have reviewedthe PPT,discuss the followingquestions with your team.\n1. Which peer review strategies have you engaged in? Which do you think are the most\neffective for you as a reviewer?\n2. Which strategies would you like to try?\n3. What would you like to improve on as a peer reviewer? Which strategies would you like to\nget better at?\n4. What concerns do you have about having your writing peer reviewed? What ideas do you\nhave to lessen those concerns?\nFollowing are additional tips for conducting an effective peer review:\n1. Listen to the writer.What kind of feedback are theyasking for? Do they want to know if their\nthesis is clear? Do they have questions about citing sources? Make a note about what kind of\nfeedback the writer has requested and keep that in mind as you respond.\n2. Be kind.When you are receiving criticism, isn\u2019t iteasier to hear if the person giving the criticism\nis kind and respectful to you? Do the same for your peer.\n3. Comment on global concerns first.(Seeherefor moreinformation on global vs sentence-level\nconcerns.)This means asking questions about anythingthat confuses you, checking to see if the\nwriting did what the assignment called for, and considering if the order of the paper makes\nsense.\n4. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to help stay focused on your reaction to the writing.For example, instead of\nsaying, \u201cYou aren\u2019t clear in this paragraph,\u201d try saying, \u201cI\u2019m confused in this paragraph. Did you\nmean X or Y?\u201d\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 31 5. Be specific.Don\u2019t say \u201cI liked it\u201d or \u201cIt was good\u201d unless you follow up with an explanation of\nexactly what you liked or thought was good. The same goes for criticism; say exactly what\nconfused you or what was missing.\n6. Ask questions.Use questions to clarify what the writermeans, what the resources given are\nsaying, and what the writer is trying to do.\n7. Offer advice based on your own experience.For example,you could say \u201cif this were my paper,\nthe two things I would do next are A and B.\u201d Provide options such as, \u201cIf you wanted to expand\nthis, you could do A, B, or C.\u201d\n8. Don\u2019t try to make the writer sound like you.If aword is the wrong word, note that, but if you\njust think of a word you like better, that\u2019s just a matter of style and voice.\n9. Don\u2019t edit your peer\u2019s writing for them.Only commenton editing when the writing is a final\ndraft or when your instructor has included checking for errors in the instructions for peer review.\nCorrecting errors is important at some point, but it makes no sense to spend time editing a\nparagraph if that paragraph may need to be deleted or changed. It\u2019s okay to remind the writer to\nrun spell check and grammar check if you notice minor errors. Otherwise, only ask about editing\nerrors if you have trouble understanding the sentence because of the mistakes. If your instructor\ndoes want you to comment on editing, be sure to follow the instructions. Remember that the\nresponsibility for correcting the errors lies with the writer, not with you.\nTips adapted from Burnell, Carol, et al.\u201cGiving andReceiving Feedback.\u201dThe Word on College Readingand Writing.Creative\nCommons licensed.\nB. Understanding a Peer Review Form\nWhen you do peer review, you will typically have a form to fill out to guide the things that you are\nfocusing on as you review your classmate\u2019s work. Before you start the peer review, take a few minutes to\nread over the peer review form to make sure that you understand what to look for and how to evaluate\neach item on the list. If you\u2019re not sure about something, ask your peer review partner or your instructor\nfor clarification.\nOnce you start peer reviewing, be sure to mark your assessment of each item honestly, and try to\nprovide helpful comments. What advice can you give your partner to help them improve their writing?\nRemember:peer review is an excellent opportunityto show what you know about effective writing.\nPRACTICE: Analyzing a Peer Review Form\nReview the following peer review form. Highlight anything that you aren\u2019t sure about and make\nnotes. Ask your partner or your instructor about items you\u2019d like clarification on.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 32 Summary 1, Draft 1 Peer Review\nName of Writer: Name of Reviewer:\nReviewer:Mark an X in the appropriate box for eachof the criteria below.

Applying Feedback\nOnce the peer review is complete, you should review the completed peer review form and any\ncomments made by your peer review partner. Here are some tips for applying the feedback you have\nreceived:\n1. If you have questions or need clarification about feedback or comments, try to ask your partner\nright away while the feedback is fresh in their mind. Make notes so that you remember what the\nfeedback means.\n2. Remember that ultimately you get to decide what feedback to accept. If you don\u2019t think the\nfeedback is correct, ask your instructor what they think. And give your partner a break; they are\nalso just learning how to give feedback.\n3. One way to improve the feedback you get is to ask for the kind of feedback you want. Don\u2019t be\nafraid to give your peer reviewer some direction.\n\u25cb What specific parts of the assignment were challenging for you?\n\u25cb What are you not sure about?\n\u25cb What would you like a second opinion on?\n4. Listen to or read the feedback with an open mind. Consider that the peer reviewer is your\nreader. It\u2019s good to know what a real reader got out of your writing.\n5. If you aren\u2019t sure about the feedback or feel upset about it, reconsider the suggestions after a\nbreak. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cI\u2019ll think about that.\u201d If you feel that the reviewer is trying to change your\nstyle so that the paper doesn\u2019t sound like you anymore, consider whether the feedback helps\nyou make the paper better. If not, feel free to ignore the feedback or to get another opinion.\nTips adapted from Burnell, Carol, et al.\u201cGiving andReceiving Feedback.\u201dThe Word on College Readingand Writing.Creative\nCommons.\nD. Using Self-Review Checklists\nYour instructor will provide self-review checklists throughout the semester to guide your writing or\nreview process. These checklists are a way to take control of your learning and monitor your own writing\nprocess. Developing this autonomy is a vital skill for becoming an effective learner, and it will serve you\nwell throughout your university career and beyond.\nAs with peer review forms, it\u2019s a good idea to review each self-review checklist before using it to make\nsure you understand each item. Ask your instructor for clarification.\nThere are basically two types of self-review checklists we\u2019ll use in this class. Each has a specific\npurpose.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 1: Academic Skills 35 i. In-class Writing Quiz Checklist\nYou\u2019ll use this self-review checklist when you complete an in-class writing quiz. The purpose is to\nremind you of what you need to include in your in-class writing. It\u2019s a good idea to read the\nchecklist as you prepare for each quiz so that you can think through how to complete each of the\nitems on the list and so that you don\u2019t forget anything important.

CHAPTER SUMMARY\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 43 1. INTRODUCTION\nIn this course and others in your college career, you will be using other people\u2019s ideas \u2013 found in articles,\ntextbooks, videos, and other sources \u2013 in a variety of ways. Sometimes you will be asked to explain these\nideas, respond to them, or use them to craft and support your own argument.\nThere are two ways in which you can introduce others\u2019 ideas:quotingandparaphrasing. To quote means\nto use the author\u2019s exact words, while to paraphrase means to put the author\u2019s ideas into yourown\nwords.\nHere\u2019s an example of each:\nQuotation\nNicole Pajer points out in \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021\u201d\nthat social media is \u201cdriving wedges between families and friends over differing political\nviews, keeping us glued to our phones all day long, and causing some to develop\nself-esteem issues from comparing their lives to other people\u2019s virtual ones.\u201d\nParaphrase\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer suggests\nthat social media causes us to stare at our phones 24\/7, argue with our loved ones over\npolitics, and even have problems with self-confidence because we compare ourselves to\nothers\u2019 online selves.\nNote that both the quotation and the paraphrase give credit to the author and introduce their idea. They\ndiffer, though, in sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary.\nUsing a quotation makes sense when the author uses striking words to make their point, or when you\nwant your reader to see their exact words. So\u2026 why not just quote? There are several reasons:\n1. An essay full of quotations can be repetitive and boring. Using both quotations and paraphrases\naddsvariety and interestto your writing.\n2. Paraphrasing allows you to select just the most relevant information to include in your essay and\navoid excess detail.\n3. When used in conjunction with a quotation, paraphrasing shows the reader yourinterpretation\nof the ideas.\n4. Paraphrasing lets your reader see that youunderstandthe ideas. In fact, the process of\nparaphrasing helps you to understand better. The more you do it, the better your reading skills\nwill become!\n5. Paraphrasing helps youavoid plagiarism.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 44 Here are our goals for this chapter:\n\u25cf identifying the elements of an effective paraphrase\n\u25cf closely reading and annotating a passage with the intention of paraphrasing it\n\u25cf practicing various strategies for paraphrasing sentences and paragraphs\n\u25cf paraphrasing quotations using a two-step strategy\n\u25cf citing our source using a signal phrase\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 45 2. RECOGNIZING EFFECTIVE PARAPHRASES\nFirst, let\u2019s look at some examples of what a paraphrase looks like. A good paraphrase uses some\ncombination of all of the steps we\u2019ll practice in this chapter, changing grammar and vocabulary as much\nas possible while citing the author and expressing the same meaning as the original passage. Here\u2019s an\nexample:\nQuotation\n\u201cThe point isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s nice to goof off every so often \u2014 it\u2019s that it\u2019s necessary. And\nthat\u2019s true even if your ultimate goal is doing better work: Downtime allows the brain to\nmake new connections and better decisions. Multiple studies have found that sustained\nmental attention without breaks is depleting, leading to inferior performance and\ndecision-making.\u201d - Rob Walker, \u201cHow to Take a Break\u201d\nParaphrase\nIn \u201cHow to Take a Break,\u201d Rob Walker argues that taking intentional pauses from work is\nnecessary because it helps people be more creative and productive. He points out that\nresearch has shown that we can\u2019t maintain focused attention to a task for a very long\ntime, and that if we try to do so we don\u2019t complete the work as well or make good\ndecisions.\nThe paraphrase above\n1.

ANNOTATING TO PARAPHRASE\nAs we\u2019ve learned, toannotatemeans to take notes.Annotation is an essential step in reading actively\nand understanding and remembering what you read.\nWhen tasked with paraphrasing a passage, it\u2019s important to try to break down complex ideas so that you\ncan explain them accurately in your own words. Below are steps to follow to annotate a passage you\nwish to paraphrase.\nSTEP 1.Read the passage more than once. Focus ongetting the general idea.Ask these questions:\n\u25cf What is the topic?\n\u25cf What is the author saying about the topic?\n\u25cf Is the author\u2019s attitude toward the topic positive, negative, or neutral?\nNow, of course, there are all kinds of red flags that go up when you start talking about\nartificially intelligent robots playing a bigger role in teaching. Data privacy is a big one,\nwith huge fears that kids would share personal information with an artificially intelligent\nrobot they trust, and that information could get in the hands of people who should not\nsee it. Plus, if the information that is input into the robots to allow them to learn is\nbiased or skewed, that would make the judgments of the robot flawed.Source:\nTeachers, the Robots Are Coming. But That\u2019s Not a Bad Thing. (Kevin Bushweller,\nEducation Week,7 January 2020,link)\nLooking at the passage above, identify the topic. Can you tell how the author views the topic?\nWhat are 3-4 words or phrases that help you to determine the author\u2019s attitude?\nSTEP 2.Mark and look up any unfamiliar words.\nLook at the passage again.Highlightany words thatyou\u2019re unfamiliar with, and add a brief\ndefinition in the margin.\nNow, of course, there are all kinds of red flags that go up when you start talking about\nartificially intelligent robots playing a bigger role in teaching. Data privacy is a big one,\nwith huge fears that kids would share personal information with an artificially intelligent\nrobot they trust, and that information could get in the hands of people who should not\nsee it.

But That\u2019s Not a Bad Thing. (Kevin Bushweller,\nEducation Week, 7 January 2020,link)\nThe first sentence has been broken down into two smaller chunks. Where would you logically\nsplit the other two sentences in the passage? Mark the chunks.\nSTEP 4. Use your knowledge of grammar to identifythe main idea or focus of each sentence as\nwell as supporting details or ideas that provide extra information.\nTake a look at the chunks you identified inStep 3.Examine each sentence individually. Which\nchunk represents the main idea of the sentence? Which chunk provides details or extra\ninformation? If both chunks present main ideas, do you think they are equal in importance?\nWhat key words suggest whether they are or aren\u2019t?\nSTEP 5. Identify pronouns and other pointing words,and the words or ideas they are referring to.\nCircle 4-5 other pronouns or pointing words or phrases in the passage. Underline the word or\nphrase each refers to, and draw an arrow from the pronoun to its referent (the word or phrase it\nrefers to).\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 50 KEY:they \u2192 kids, that information \u2192 (kids\u2019) personalinformation, it \u2192 personal\ninformation, them \u2192 robots, that \u2192 biased or skewed information\nSTEP 6.Read the passage again to be sure you understandhow the ideas fit together.

PARAPHRASING STEP 1: TRY TO EXPLAIN\nAfter you\u2019ve carefully read and annotated a passage, the first step in paraphrasing is simply to explain\nwhat the passage is about: What is the author trying to say? We\u2019ll practice this paraphrasing strategy\nwith some proverbs, or well-known expressions. (Note that because these expressions are common\nknowledge, we do not need to cite the author.)\n1\nExample:\u201cEvery cloud has a silver lining.\u201d\nClose your eyes and think about what this proverb means. How\nwould you explain it to someone?\nThere are lots of different ways you could explain this proverb. Here are some example paraphrases:\n\u25cf Even bad events have something good in them.\n\u25cf Always look on the bright side.\n\u25cf If it rains, that means that flowers will grow!\n\u25cf When something negative happens, there\u2019s usually something positive in it.\nPRACTICE 1: Paraphrasing Proverbs\nTry this first step with the following proverbs. Explain what each means.\n1. Proverb:Beauty is only skin-deep.\nMy paraphrase:\n2. Proverb:Never send a boy to do a man\u2019s job.\nMy paraphrase:\n3. Proverb:Practice makes perfect.\nMy paraphrase:\nWhen you select a quotation to paraphrase,alwaysstart with this first step.Without looking at the\npassage,think about how you would explain it to anotherperson. Write that down without looking at\nthe passage. Then, move on to Step 2 to improve your paraphrase.\n1Photo byJeremy BishoponUnsplash\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 53 5. PARAPHRASING STEP 2: MAKE IT YOUR OWN: COMMON PARAPHRASING\nSTRATEGIES\nThe next step is to look at your explanation. How similar or different is it to the original passage? If it is\nalready very different \u2013 while still conveying the same meaning \u2013 your paraphrase might be complete!\nHowever, if the vocabulary and grammar are still quite similar, you\u2019ll have to keep working on it. Here are\nsix strategies (which should always be used in combination) you can use to make your paraphrase your\nown:\nA. Use Synonyms\nOne effective way to quickly put a passage in your own words is to replace those words withsynonyms,\nor words that have the same meaning. Take a look at the example paraphrase from this chapter\u2019s\nintroduction. Some of the synonyms have been highlighted:\nQuotation\nNicole Pajer points out in \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in\n2021\u201d that social media is \u201cdriving wedges betweenfamilies and friendsoverdiffering\npolitical views, keeping us glued to our phonesallday long, and causing some to\ndevelopself-esteem issuesfrom comparing their livesto other people\u2019s virtual ones.\u201d\nParaphrase\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer suggests\nthat social media causes us to stare at our phones24\/7, argue withour loved onesover\npolitics, and even haveproblems with self-confidencebecause we compare ourselves to\nothers\u2019 online selves.\nNotice that one key phrase \u2013social media\u2013 hasn\u2019tbeen changed. That\u2019s OK! When paraphrasing, you\nwant to make sure thecore meaningof the passagestays the same. This sometimes means keeping key\nwords.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 54 PRACTICE 1: Identifying Key Words and Synonyms\nHighlight the synonyms you see in the quotation and paraphrase below. Underline the key word\nthat has not changed.\nQuotation\nAccording to Don Anair, the research director of the UCS Clean Transportation Program, \u201cThere\nare opportunities for ride-hailing to be part of a low-carbon transportation future, with some\nconcerted effort among ride-hailing companies, policymakers, and consumers alike.\u201d\nParaphrase\nDon Anair, the research director of the UCS Clean Transportation Program, suggests that\nride-hailing could produce fewer emissions in the years ahead if governmental organizations,\ncompanies like Uber and Lyft, and customers all work together.\nB. Change Word Forms\nWe\u2019ve talked about using synonyms to convey the author\u2019s meaning. If the author\u2019s word choice is key to\nthe passage\u2019s meaning, though \u2013 or if you\u2019re having trouble finding an appropriate synonym \u2013 you might\nchange theformof the word instead. Remember thateach word in English has its ownpart of speech;it\nmight be a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or another kind of word like a conjunction or article. Don\u2019t\nworry about those other kinds; we\u2019ll just focus on the main four here.\nTake a look at these examples of word families:\n1. beauty\nbeauty(n.) - His speech showedbeauty.\nbeautiful(adj.) - His speech wasbeautiful.\nbeautifully(adv.) - He spokebeautifully.\nNotice how the three sentences above convey the same meaning while using\ndifferent forms of the wordbeauty.\n2. run\nrun(n.) - We often see the track team go on arunaround our neighborhood.\nrun(v.) - We often see the track teamrunaroundour neighborhood.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 55 running(adj.) - We often see therunningtrack team around our\nneighborhood.\nAgain, notice how these three sentences mean the same thing while using\ndifferent forms of the wordrun.\nPRACTICE 1: Identifying Word Forms\nHighlight the different word forms you see in the quotation and paraphrase below:\nQuotation\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine an alternate future where advanced machine capabilities are used\nto empower more of us, rather than control most of us,\u201d Tufekcki writes.\nParaphrase\nTufekci suggests that it\u2019s not difficult to dream of a different future in which people use\nsophisticated machines to help humanity, with these machines empowering us instead\nof controlling us.\nPRACTICE 2: Paraphrasing with Word Forms\nChange the highlighted words to a different word form(for example, noun \u2192 verb)to make a\nsentence with the same meaning.\n1. Alex enjoysphotographingtheir friends and family.\n2. They findwrittenassignments really challenging.\n3. Cristina Hunger has taught her dog tocommunicateclearly.\n4. Her book,How Stella Learned to Talk, isfascinating.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 56 C. Modify Verbs\nAnother straightforward way to change a passage is to change the form of itsverbs. For instance, you\ncan change the tense (for example, past simple to present perfect or present simple to present\ncontinuous) or add a modal such as \u201ccan\u201d or \u201cmight.\u201d\nAgain, see our example fromStrategy 1. In additionto most of these words being synonyms, their verb\nforms are different:\nQuotation\nNicole Pajer points out in \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in\n2021\u201d that social mediais \u201cdrivingwedges betweenfamilies and friends over differing\npolitical views,keepingus glued to our phones allday long, andcausingsome to\ndevelop self-esteem issuesfrom comparingtheir livesto other people\u2019s virtual ones.\u201d\nParaphrase\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer suggests\nthat social media causes usto stareat our phones24\/7,arguewith our loved ones over\npolitics, and evenhaveproblems with self-confidencebecause we compareourselves to\nothers\u2019 online selves.\nPRACTICE 1: Paraphrasing with Verb Forms\nHighlight the changed verb forms you see in the quotation and paraphrase below.\nQuotation\n\u201cThe best way to avoid destructive conflict in the future is to continue the advance of\nour social ideals, which has already greatly reduced violence\u201d (Kurzweil 28).\nParaphrase\nRay Kurzweil suggests that the ideal way of avoiding destructive conflict is continuing to\nmake societal progress, which is already greatly reducing violence.\nPRACTICE 2: Paraphrasing with Synonyms\nRewrite the paraphrase in Practice 1 using synonyms to make it even more different from the\noriginal passage.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 57 D. Move Sentence Parts\nAnother paraphrasing strategy is to moveparts ofa sentence. You might rearrange a list of items or\nswap the order of clauses. Note the different placement of the highlighted phrases in the example\nbelow:\nQuotation\nAccording to Don Anair, the research director of the UCS Clean Transportation Program,\n\u201cThere are opportunities for ride-hailing to be part of a low-carbon transportation\nfuture, with some concerted effort amongride-hailingcompanies,policymakers, and\nconsumersalike.\u201d\nParaphrase\nDon Anair, the research director of the UCS Clean Transportation Program, suggests that\nride-hailing could produce fewer emissions in the years ahead ifgovernmental\norganizations,companies like Uber and Lyft, andcustomersall work together.\nPRACTICE 1: Moving Sentence Parts\nHighlight the rearranged elements you see in the quotation and paraphrase below.\nQuotation\nEmma Marris argues that \u201cThe climate change crisis is not going to be solved by\npersonal sacrifice. It will be solved by electing the right people, passing the right laws,\ndrafting the right regulations, signing the right treaties \u2013 and respecting those treaties\nalready signed, particularly with indigenous nations.\u201d\nParaphrase\nAccording to Emma Marris, we aren\u2019t going to be able to fix climate change with\nindividual changes. Rather, governmental organizations will be able to solve it by making\nand acknowledging official agreements (especially with indigenous nations), creating\nstrong laws and regulations, and bringing in good elected officials.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 58 E. Use Negative Forms\/Opposites\nAnother way you can change a passage is by using words with theoppositemeaning in order to make\nnegative phrases positive and vice versa. Just make sure to keep the meaning the same; this can be\ntricky!\nNote the use of negatives and opposites in the example below:\nQuotation\nNicole Pajer points out in \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in\n2021\u201d that social media is \u201cdriving wedges betweenfamilies and friendsover differing\npolitical views,keeping us glued to our phones allday long, andcausing some to\ndevelop self-esteem issuesfrom comparing their livesto other people\u2019s virtual ones.\u201d\nParaphrase\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer suggests\nthat social media causes us tonot get along witheach otherbecause of politics,stop\ndoing other activities, andnot feel positive aboutourselvesbecause we compare\nourselves to other people.\nNote too that in addition to changing positive clauses to negative ones, the writer has used\nsynonyms; a good paraphrase uses multiple strategies.\nPRACTICE 1: Identifying Negative Forms\nHighlight the opposite forms you see in the quotation and paraphrase below.\nQuotation\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine an alternate future where advanced machine capabilities are used\nto empower more of us, rather than control most of us,\u201d Tufekcki writes.\nParaphrase\nTufekci suggests that it\u2019s not difficult to dream of a different future in which people use\nsophisticated machines to help humanity, with these machines empowering us instead\nof controlling us.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 59 PRACTICE 2: Using Negative Forms\nParaphrase the sentences below, focusing on changing the negative forms to positive ones,\nand the positive forms to negative ones.\n1. Our professor told us that it\u2019s not a big deal to miss class from time to time, as long\nas we finish all of the required work.\n2. Kaisong was confident that he was well-prepared for the presentation.\nF. Combine or Separate Sentences\nYet another way to improve your paraphrase is tocombineshorter sentences orbreak apartlonger\nones. Note this strategy in the example below:\nQuotation(1 sentence)\nNicole Pajer points out in \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in\n2021\u201d that social media is \u201cdriving wedges between families and friends over differing\npolitical views, keeping us glued to our phones all day long, and causing some to develop\nself-esteem issues from comparing their lives to other people\u2019s virtual ones.\u201d\nParaphrase(divided into 3 sentences)\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer suggests\nthat social media causes us to not get along with each other because of politics. She says\nit also stops us from doing other activities. Pajer also points out that when we use social\nmedia we don\u2019t feel good about ourselves because we compare ourselves to other\npeople.\nPRACTICE 1: Combining Sentences\nCombine the two sentences in the quotation below to make one longer sentence.\nEmma Marris argues that \u201cThe climate change crisis is not going to be solved by personal\nsacrifice. It will be solved by electing the right people, passing the right laws, drafting the\nright regulations, signing the right treaties \u2013 and respecting those treaties already signed,\nparticularly with indigenous nations.\u201d\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 2: Paraphrasing 60 6. COMBINING PARAPHRASING STRATEGIES: PRACTICE\nA good paraphrase will usemanyof the strategieswe\u2019ve looked at in this chapter. You can break a\npassage into chunks when you read it, think of how you\u2019d explain the idea to a classmate, then change as\nmuch as possible of the passage\u2019s grammatical structure and vocabulary. Write down your paraphrase\nfor each of these steps. Sometimes it\u2019ll be easy to paraphrase on the first try, but other times you might\nneed to go through three or four different strategies before coming up with a strong paraphrase.\nPRACTICE 1: Combining Paraphrasing Strategies\nHere are a few sample quotations to practice paraphrasing:\n1. ORIGINAL:\u201cThere is a connection between novelty andhappiness,\u201d Dr. Laurie Santos, a\ncognitive scientist who teaches the wildly popular \u201cPsychology and the Good Life\u201d course at\nYale, told me. \u201cNovel stimuli tend to activate regions of our brain that are associated with\nrewards.\u201d There\u2019s more than just the dopamine rush, though. \u201cNovel things also capture our\nattention \u2026 you\u2019re more likely to notice things and be present,\u201d Santos continued. \u201cThere\u2019s\nlots of evidence that simply being more present can improve our mood and happiness.\u201d\n(Gabriella Paiella, \u201cThe Brain-Changing Magic of New Experiences\u201d)\nMY PARAPHRASE:\n2.

CITING YOUR SOURCE WITH SIGNAL PHRASES\nAs we\u2019ve discussed above, you always need tociteyour source\u2014to show where the information you\u2019re\nparaphrasing or quoting came from. To do this, you should use asignal phrase\u2014in other words, a phrase\nthat signals to your reader that what follows is someone else\u2019s idea rather than your own.\nHere are some examples of signal phrases that we\u2019ve seen in this chapter:\n\u201cThere is a connection between novelty and happiness,\u201dDr. Laurie Santos, a cognitive\nscientist who teaches the wildly popular \u201cPsychology and the Good Life\u201d course at\nYale, told me.\nIn \u201cHow to Have a Healthy Relationship with Social Media in 2021,\u201d Nicole Pajer\nsuggeststhat social media causes us to not get alongwith each other because of\npolitics.\nAccording to Emma Marris,we aren\u2019t going to be ableto fix climate change with\nindividual changes.\nA signal phrase must includethe author\u2019s name. Dependingon the situation, you may also include the\ntitle of the source (the article, book, or website where you found the information) or information about\nthe author (such as if they are an expert in the field).\nA signal phrase also includesa reporting verborthe phrase\u201caccording to\u201d:\nA. Reporting Verbs\nReporting verbs are verbs like \u201cclaim,\u201d \u201cargue,\u201d or \u201csay.\u201d Here are some examples of them in use:\n\u25cf Zeynep Tufekciarguesthat robots could be usefulfor humanity.\n\u25cf My teacherssaythat it is a good habit to reviewnotes right after class.\n\u25cf Don Anairdescribesways in which ride-sharing couldhelp the environment.\n* Some reporting verbs can be followed bythat+a complete idea, while others can take a\ndirect object.

You\u2019ve practiced recognizing effective paraphrases, annotating\nto paraphrase, and writing your own paraphrases using two steps: First, explaining what you\u2019ve read\nwithout looking at the text and second, making sure your paraphrase differs from the original in both\ngrammar and vocabulary.

CHAPTER SUMMARY\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 67 1. INTRODUCTION\nThere are many instances in which you will be required to summarize, or to give a short explanation of a\nwork in your own words. A professor might ask you to summarize a reading passage to show that you\u2019ve\nunderstood its meaning, or your friend might ask you to summarize a TV show to see if it sounds\ninteresting. You\u2019ve already practiced paraphrasing, an important skill for summarizing.\nOur goals for this chapter include:\n\u25cf using annotation strategies specific to summarizing\n\u25cf recognizing various patterns of organization of a text\n\u25cf using templates to construct one-sentence summaries\n\u25cf selecting and using appropriate reporting verbs\n\u25cf outlining and writing a paragraph summary\n\u25cf giving effective writing feedback\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 68 2. ANNOTATING TO SUMMARIZE: IDENTIFYING KEY IDEAS\nGood writers read a text a few times and annotate \u2013 or mark up \u2013 the text as they read. This helps them\nto identify the parts of the text and how they fit together.\nAnnotating is a personal practice; as you make it a habit, you\u2019ll discover the ways that work best for you.\nYou may prefer to use different-colored highlighters or just a pen. The important thing is that you DO\ntake notes while you read; this will make you a better reader and writer!\nBelow is one approach to annotating an article that will help you to identify the author\u2019s argument and\nsupport for it.\nSTEP 1. Get a general idea of the article.\nFirst,skimthe article quickly, just to get the gistof it.\n\u25cf Read thetitleand look at the first sentence of eachparagraph. What overalltopicis the\narticle about?\n\u25cf Do you get a sense of what the author is trying to convey about this topic?\n\u25cf If the author is trying to convince the reader to believe an idea, what kinds ofevidence\nare they using to support that argument?\n\u25cf Underline any key words or phrases that seem to be central to the topic.\nSTEP 2. Read carefully for the main idea.\nNow that you have a sense of what the article is about, read it through carefully, thinking about\nhow the ideas are connected to each other.\n\u25cf Look for words that indicate theorganizational patternof the article; underline or\nhighlight these. For example, is the author comparing two things, making an argument\nfor change, or describing the reasons that something happened?\n\u25cf Try to find a statement that shows the main idea of the article. Put a star next to this and\nwrite it in your own wordsin the margin. If you can\u2019tfind this kind of statement; don\u2019t\npanic! The main idea might beimplied(not directlystated).\n\u25cf Remember that the first paragraph(s) might be background information; be careful not\nto confuse this with the main idea.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 69 STEP 3. Read again for the points that support the main idea.\n\u25cf As you read this time, underline the supporting points for the main idea you\u2019ve identified.\nThese sentences may occur at the beginning of paragraphs (similar to topic sentences) or at\nthe end. One way to find these is to ask yourself as you finish reading each paragraph if the\nidea in this paragraph was new or if it continued the idea from the previous paragraph.\n\u25cf Underline and mark each point with a number or other symbol.\n\u25cf After you have found the supporting points, make sure that they match the main idea you\nwrote in Step 2.\n\u25cf If the pointsdon'tseem to match the main idea youidentified earlier, skim the article again\nand edit your annotations accordingly. You may need to change either the main idea or the\nsupporting points. (For example, if you wrote that the author explained the causes of\npoverty, but each of the supporting points are about the effects of poverty, you would have\nto change your main idea statement.)\n\u25cf Think about how you will explain each point; beginparaphrasingin your own words in the\nmargin. You may want to use one or two details that you found most convincing to explain\neach supporting point in your summary.\nSection adapted from Aquino-Cutcher, Andrew, et al.Final Draft 3.

RECOGNIZING PATTERNS OF ORGANIZATION\nIdentifying the organizational pattern of a text can make it much easier to summarize, particularly for\nlonger texts in which it can be particularly challenging to identify main ideas and important details. In\nthis section, we\u2019ll learn how to identify these and use them to summarize.\nA. Identifying Organizational Patterns in Academic Writing\nThe purpose of academic writing is to present a number of ideas that logically fit together. Writers use an\norganizational pattern to help organize their ideas in ways that make an argument and help you to\nunderstand the material being presented.Organizationalpatterns can be identified by transitions or\n\u201csignal words\u201dthe author uses. Recognizing the typeof pattern can help the reader put all of the facts\ntogether and understand what the text is about.\nORGANIZATIONAL\nPURPOSE SIGNAL WORDS\nPATTERN\nAlso, and, another, a number of, as well\nLists a series of reasons, examples, as, too, besides, first, for example, for\nfeatures, or characteristics that instance, furthermore, in addition, in\nClassification\nsupport the main idea fact, largest, least, moreover, most\nimportant, one plus, second, several, the\nfollowing\nCause:Because, because of, since, stems\nfrom, one cause is, one reason is, leads\nto, for this reason\nDescribes how one or more things\nCause\/Effect\ncause or are related to one another\nEffect:consequently, results in, one\nresult is, therefore, thus, as a result,\nhence\nSimilarities: both, also, similarly, likewise,\nas well as, correspondingly, in the same\nway\nDiscusses similarities and\/or\nComparison\/\ndifferences among ideas, objects,\nContrast Differences: unlike, differs from, in\npeople\ncontrast, on the other hand, instead,\ndespite, nevertheless, however, in spite\nof, whereas, as opposed to\nProblem: issue, problem, problematic,\nchallenge\nDiscusses problem(s) and provides\nProblem\/Solution\nsolution(s)\nSolution: propose, solution, answer,\nremedy, prevention, fix\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 71 Pros:advantage, benefit, in favor of,\npositive\nDiscusses advantages and\nPro\/Con\ndisadvantages\nCons:disadvantage, drawback, argument\nagainst, negative\nRefers to, can be defined as, means,\nExplains the meaning of new words\nDefinition consists of, is a term that, is called, is\nor phrases\ncharacterized by\nChronological Describes the sequence in which First, second, later, before, next, as soon\nOrder (Time) events occur in time as, after\nDescribes how to do or make\nProcess First, second, next, then, following\nsomething\nPRACTICE 1: Identifying Patterns of Organization\nFor each passage, identify the pattern of organization used by the author.\n1. Responsibility, a basic concept of Reality Therapy, is here defined as the ability to fulfill\none\u2019s needs, and to do so in a way that does not deprive others of the ability to fulfill their\nneeds. To illustrate, a responsible person is able to give and receive love. If a woman, for\nexample, falls in love with a man, we would expect him either to return her love or to let\nher know in a considerate way that he appreciates her affection, but does not share her\nfeelings. If he takes advantage of her love, we would not consider him responsible.\nA responsible person also does that which gives a feeling of self-worth and a feeling that\nthey are worthwhile to others. They are motivated to strive and perhaps endure privation\nto attain self-worth. When a responsible person says they will perform a job for us, they\nwill try to accomplish what was asked.\nPattern of Organization:\nWhy:\n2. It would seem, in retrospect, that the prohibition laws of the 1920s actually helped\nencourage, rather than hinder, illegal activity. Citizens in every section of the country\nshowed nothing but contempt for laws, and any attempt to enforce laws was met with\nindifference or hostility. Probably the worst effect of the laws was that the control of\nliquor distribution fell into the hands of organized crime, which resulted in increased\ncriminal violence throughout the country. Rather than decreasing crime, the prohibition\nlaws actually helped to increase it.\nPattern of Organization:\nWhy:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 72 3. Many high school graduates go straight on to college. Others go to work full-time, then\ndecide later to start college. The graduate who goes off to a job always runs the risk of\nbeing unable to let go of that paycheck. It may be too hard to live the lean life of a student\nagain. However, once the person does return to college, they usually bring a maturity that\nis a big asset in the classroom. True, that student will be older than the others when they\nfinally get that college degree. On the other hand, this older student more often knows\nfrom experience what kind of job best suits them. The student is less likely to end up in a\nmake-do job after college.\nPattern of Organization:\nWhy:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 73 B. Organizational Pattern Practice\nLet\u2019s take a look at how we can use organizational patterns to explain the plot of a movie.Avengers:\nEndgameis three hours long, but we can summarizeit in a concise way by using organizational patterns\nto capture the main elements of the film. Using the organizational pattern, we\u2019ve chosen the most\nimportant details and can now use them to write a summary. A lot happens in this movie, but this is the\noverall gist:\nOne-Sentence Summary: The Avengers who are left onEarth work together to defeat Thanos and\ndestroy the infinity stones to restore civilization.\nOrganizational Pattern: Problem\/Solution\nProblems Solutions\n\u25cf Thanos used the infinity stones to make \u25cf Avengers use the quantum realm to travel\n50% of the population in the universe back in time before Thanos acquired the\ndisappear infinity stones\n\u25cf With the infinity stones, Thanos has \u25cf Avengers destroy the infinity stones\nultimate power \u25cf Thanos is destroyed\n\u25cf Thanos\u2019 current whereabouts are\nundetermined\n\u25cf Members of The Avengers and their family\nmembers have disappeared\nPRACTICE 1: Organizational Pattern Practice\nUse the outline below to summarize one of your favorite pieces of media.\nYour Favorite Movie\/TV Show\/Novel:\nOne-Sentence Summary:\nOrganizational Pattern(s):\nORG PATTERN 1: ORG PATTERN 2:\n\u25cf \u25cf\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 74 C. Combining Patterns of Organization\nDon\u2019t assume that every important thought in a multi-paragraph reading will be covered by a single\norganizational pattern. It\u2019s possible for a writer to use one or more organizational patterns and still\ninclude important information that is not completely included in the pattern or patterns used to develop\nthe main idea. The test for what\u2019s important is always based on the main idea using questions like \u201cWhat\ninformation do I need in order to fully explain or prove the main idea?\u201d\nEXAMPLE 1:Cause and Effect plus Comparison and Contrast\nA study in Romania suggests that children who are abandoned at birth and placed in state-run\ninstitutions can eventually thrive if they leave the institution and are placed in foster care. In fact,\nchildren in the study who were placed in foster homes ended up on par emotionally, intellectually,\nand physically with children of the same age who had grown up with their biological families. In\ncontrast, orphaned children who never left the state-run institutions showed steady declines in their\nemotional and mental health over the course of their stay. While the study supports the idea that\nfoster care for abandoned children is better than institutional life, it\u2019s worth noting that Romanian\ninstitutions have a particularly horrific reputation for neglect. This may well account for the effects of\nlong-term and unrelieved institutionalization upon abandoned children.\nThe paragraph opens with a clear cause and effect relationship: Orphaned children who enter\nfoster care benefit from leaving the institution, and children who do not enter foster care do not\nfare as well. Note, however, that the two groups are also contrasted in order to prove the main\nidea expressed in the first sentence. Children abandoned at birth can thrive if they enter foster\ncare. Thus, as the transitional phrase \"in contrast\" suggests, comparison and contrast is the\nsecond pattern used to organize the material.\nEXAMPLE 2:Classification based on Cause and Effectwith Definition\nAccording to economists, there are four different types of unemployment, each with its own specific\ncause. The first type of unemployment is seasonal. Workers in certain industries\u2014such as\nagriculture, resorts and retail\u2014are subject to fluctuating demands for their services because of peak\nand off-peak times in these industries. This type of unemployment is regular, predictable, and\nrelatively short-term. The second type of unemployment is referred to as frictional. It is caused by\nschool and college graduates seeking jobs for the first time and by workers changing jobs. These\npeople usually remain unemployed for just a short time while they seek a position. A third type of\nunemployment is structural, caused, for example, by the use of new machinery, such as robots, that\ncan perform simple repetitive tasks. Workers displaced by structural changes often experience\nlong-term unemployment while seeking a job that matches their skills and salary expectations. The\nlast type of unemployment is cyclical. This kind is produced by the overall business cycle. Cyclical\nunemployment increases in recessions; it decreases during growth periods.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 75 The opening sentence provides two sets of clues. The phrase \u201cfour different types of\nunemployment\u201d suggests classification, mainly because the sentence suggests that these four\ntypes comprise all the possible kinds of unemployment. If it did not, then simple listing would\nbe the better answer. However, the phrase \u201ceach with its own specific cause\u201d implies the cause\nand effect pattern. In addition, the italics for the names of the four types followed by a specific\ndefinition make it clear that the definition pattern is also in play.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 76 4. WRITING A ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY\nA. Introduction\nA one-sentence summary provides information about the source that is being summarized and presents\nthe thesis or argument of that source. Think of it as a very brief introduction to your reader of the article,\nchapter, or book you\u2019ve read; all that they need to know iswhowrote it, what itstitleis, and whatits\nmainargumentis.\nIn order to write an effective summary sentence, you should keep the following in mind:\n\u25cf Include theauthor\u2019s full name.\no First mention: first and last (family) name\no Subsequent mentions (if your one-sentence summary is followed by a paragraph\nsummary, for example): last name only\n\u25cf Include thetitle of the source.\no For articles like the ones we are using in this class, put the title in quotation marks (\u201c\u201d).\nIf you need to summarize a book or movie, put the title initalics.\no If you refer to this source later in your paper, you generally only need to use the\nauthor\u2019s name,notthe title again.\n\u25cf Include thethesis or argumentof the article youare summarizing.\no State the argument or main idea concisely and clearly.\no Do not include details in the summary sentence.\n\u25cf Use a strongreporting verbthat accurately describeswhat the article is doing. (However, if\nyou use \u201caccording to\u201d in your summary sentence you will not need a reporting verb.)\nB. Basic Formula for a One-sentence Summary\nRemember fromChapter 2that the first three elements\u2013 information about the author\/article and a\nreporting verb \u2013 make up asignal phraseshowing thatthe idea came from someone else rather than\nyou. The signal phrase is a crucial part of your one-sentence summary because it gives credit to the\nauthor.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 77 C.

Signal Phrases: Saying Vs Doing\nWhen creating multiple summaries (such as a one-sentence summary and a paragraph summary) or a\nsummary\/response essay, which requires both types, it\u2019s important to find different ways to express the\nmain idea\/thesis\/argument of the article. One helpful way to approach this is to think aboutwhat the\nauthor saysandwhat the author does.\ni. Capturing What the Author Says\nFor a one-sentence summary or the first sentence of a summary-response essay, it might be most\nhelpful to focus onwhat the author says, or the mainargument of the article. These signal verbs are\ntypically followed bythatand a complete statementof the main idea.\nIn the article \u201cCoping with Procrastination,\u201d Angela Mooresuggests thatin order to change the\nhabit of procrastination, it is essential to look below the surface for the real reasons why one\nputs off doing things.(main argument of the article)\nMooreargues thatprocrastination is one of the mostpervasive bad habits among college\nstudents.(statement of a point from the author\u2019sargument)\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 79 ii.

Using Precise Reporting Verbs\nA reporting verb is a word which is used to talk about sources or to attribute an idea to someone.\nReporting verbs can be very effective in conveying meaning, but the difficulty with using them is that\nthere are many, and each of them has a slightly different and often subtle meaning.\nIt is repetitive and boring to writeSmith says...over and over again. Fortunately, there is a wide choice of\nreporting verbs in English. Reporting verbs can indicate:\n\u25cf the author\u2019s personal viewpoint\n\u25cf your viewpoint regarding what the author says\n\u25cf the author\u2019s viewpoint regarding others\u2019 ideas\nTo interpret the writer\u2019s ideas accurately, however, you will need to use a verb with the correct nuance\n(sense of meaning). Use an English learner's dictionary to check that you have the right verb for the right\ncontext.\nChoosing accurate reporting verbs to reflect both the function that the author is performing and your\nfeeling about it(or to conceal your feeling witha neutral reporting verb)is an important skill todevelop.\nConsider the following:\nMOVE \/ FUNCTION WEAKER POSITION NEUTRAL POSITION STRONGER POSITION\naddition adds\nadvice advises\napplauds,\naccepts, acknowledges,\ncongratulates,\nagreement admits, concedes agrees, concurs, confirms,\nextols, praises,\nrecognizes\nsupports\nalerts, argues, boasts,\ncontends, convinces,\nargument assures, encourages,\nemphasizes, exhorts,\nand apologizes interprets, justifies,\nforbids, insists, proves,\npersuasion reasons\npromises, persuades,\nthreatens, warns\nbelieves, claims, declares,\nexpresses, feels, holds,\nguesses, hopes, knows, maintains, asserts, guarantees,\nbelieving\nimagines professes, subscribes to, insists, upholds\nthinks\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 84 MOVE \/ FUNCTION WEAKER POSITION NEUTRAL POSITION STRONGER POSITION\nconcludes, discovers,\nconclusion\nfinds, infers, realizes\naccuses, attacks,\ncomplains, contradicts,\ncriticises, denies,\ndisagreement challenges, debates, discards, disclaims,\nand doubts, questions disagrees, questions, discounts, dismisses,\nquestioning requests, wonders disputes, disregards,\nnegates, objects to,\nopposes, refutes,\nrejects\ndiscussion comments discusses, explores reasons\naccentuates,\nemphasizes,\nemphasis\nhighlights, stresses,\nunderscores, warns\nanalyzes, appraises,\nassesses, compares\nevaluation blames, complains,\nconsiders, contrasts,\nand ignores, scrutinizes,\ncritiques, evaluates,\nexamination warns\nexamines, investigates,\nunderstands\narticulates, clarifies,\nexplanation\nexplains\ncomments, defines,\ndescribes,estimates,\nforgets, identifies,\nillustrates, implies,\ninforms, instructs, lists,\nmentions, notes,\npresentation confuses announces, promises\nobserves, outlines,\npoints out, presents,\nremarks, reminds,\nreports, restates,\nreveals, shows, states,\nstudies, tells, uses\nadvises, advocates,\nalleges, intimates, hypothesizes, posits, asserts, recommends,\nsuggestion\nspeculates postulates, proposes, urges\nsuggests, theorizes\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 85 Example Sentences\nRemember that in MLA style, reporting verbs should be in the present tense, and you should\ninclude the page number if there is one.\nBoyntonwarnsthe reader that ordinary chocolate istoo frail to withstand heat,\nmoisture, and proximity to baked beans (p. 79).\nHanksdefinesan idiom as an expression whose \u201cmeaning...isdistinct from the sum of its\nparts\u201d (p. 257).\nSmithdisagreeswithFrye when shemaintains thatmany students have trouble with\nreporting verbs.\nSome peoplesubscribe tothe idea that chocolate isunhealthy, but Boynton\u2019s book\nrefutesthis claim.\nThis paperinvestigatesthe effects of alcohol onmemory andstresses thatfurther\nresearch be done as a matter of urgency.\nThis section adapted from \u201cVerbs for Reporting.\u201d University of Adelaide Writing Centre, 2014.

What are \u201cList Summaries\u201d?\nYou may have learned to write a list summary in previous English classes. This type of summary involves\nparaphrasing topic sentences (the first line of each paragraph) from a text and adding \u201clist\u201d transitions\nbetween them.\n\u201cList\u201d transitions include:first, second, third,finally, next, also, then,\nadditionally, in addition, moreover, furthermore\nii. The Problem with List Summaries\nFor longer academic texts, list summaries are inefficient. They are often excessively long and full of\nunnecessary details. They also fail to adequately show the relationship between the ideas in the text.\niii. Summarizing by Organizational Patterns\nOne way to avoid long summaries with unnecessary details is to summarize by organizational pattern.\nThink about how the author is developing their argument. Are they presenting the effects of a cause?\nContrasting two things? Outlining a problem and offering a solution?\nPRACTICE 1: Reviewing Organizational Patterns\nBrainstorm 3-4 examples oforganizational\/rhetoricalpatternsthat authors might use in their work\nand whatsignal phrasesmay indicate that pattern.\nOrganizational Signal Phrases\nPattern (that help me identify the pattern)\n\u25cf \u25cf\nSeethis chartfrom earlier in this chapter for keywords that signal different organizational patterns.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 87 PRACTICE 2: Evaluating Sample Student Summaries\nBelow are two student summaries of an article titled\u201cThe Deadly Noodle\u201dby Michael Hastings,\nStefan Thiel, and Dana Thomas. Consider the pros and cons of each summary, then decide which\nyou think is more effective and explain why.\nSummary 1(172 words)\nIn their article \u201cThe Deadly Noodle,\u201d Hastings, Thiel,and Thomas explain that the spread\nof the American diet and lifestyle has caused health crises in countries around the world. The\nauthors note that both developed and developing countries are experiencing negative effects\nbecause of the spread of these habits. The authors explain that one effect is that these nations are\nexperiencing a more sedentary lifestyle. For example, people work on assembly lines, ride in cars,\nand watch television. In addition to physical activity, the authors also show the ways in which food\nis being affected. They write that foods are becoming less healthful because of increased use of\ncarbohydrates, oil, and sugar, which all cause an increase in calories. Finally, the authors explain\nthat because of the lack of physical activity and a healthful diet, obesity is rising, and, as a result,\nhealth care costs rise as well. The authors conclude that the popularity of the American diet and\nlifestyle internationally may be attractive, but are also causing an obesity epidemic worldwide.\nSummary 2(268 words)\nIn their article, \u201cThe Deadly Noodle\u201d, Hastings,Thiel, and Thomas write that greasy\nburgers and processed food are making the world fat. First, they write that France has resisted\nAmerican cultural imperialism in the area of food, but it is still influenced by America\u2019s junk food. A\nsign of this is that France\u2019s children are gaining more weight in recent years. Then they write that\nthe problem of the spread of American food is even more obvious in developing countries.\nUrbanization is causing people to move less and foods in these countries are becoming more\nprocessed, which makes them higher in calories and unhealthier. The authors state that nobody\nthought it would be easy to resist the American diet, but it\u2019s even more difficult than people\nthought it would be. Derek Yach says that people can blame globalization and major brands like\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 88 Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s for this issue. Next, the authors say that the number of overweight\npeople in the United States has doubled, and that Asia and Europe are also seeing increasing\nnumbers of overweight people. For example, diabetes has been rising in China and India more\nthan in any other country. Then the authors say that cooking oil is causing a problem because it\u2019s\nso cheap, so Indians use it too much. After that, the authors say that sugar is another part of the\nproblem. Another problem is that people aren\u2019t moving around and are becoming couch-potatoes.\nFinally, the authors say that this is all a problem because healthcare costs are rising. Popkin says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very attractive lifestyle, but it\u2019s killing people all the same.\u201d\nE.

What does each do well? Howcan each be improved?\nSummary 1\nIn her article \u201cThe Hidden Epidemic of Teen Hunger,\u201d Laura Bliss describes a recent study by\nSusan J. Popkin that analyzed the causes and effects of teen hunger, as well as presented some\npossible solutions. Bliss points out that teens in the U.S. are more likely to experience food\ninsecurity than younger kids because programs that fight poverty focus on little kids, while older\nteens \u201ctake on adult-like responsibilities, feel powerful social pressures, and engage in impulsive\nbehavior.\u201d Because teenagers can be embarrassed by being poor, many of them shoplift, sell\ndrugs, or even sell their own bodies in order to get food. Ironically, Bliss points out, obesity and\nfood insecurity are two sides of the same coin; fast food is cheaper than healthy food. Popkin\u2019s\nteam also suggested some possible solutions to the problem of food insecurity and the negative\nways in which teenagers try to deal with it, including giving teenagers more SNAP benefits to get\nfood, making better teen job programs, and getting teens involved in organizations that fight\nfood insecurity.\nSummary 2\nFirst, Bliss writes about Susan J. Popkin, a housing and poverty researcher who did a study on\nteen hunger. Next, she describes how little kids are different from teenagers because teenagers\nexperiencing hunger are overlooked and also feel stigma about being hungry. Bliss says that\nteenagers undertake risky behavior, like stealing, selling drugs, or using sex to get food. Then, she\nwrites that food insecurity has become \u201cnormal.\u201d Bliss describes Popkin\u2019s study that gathered\n200 teenagers from 13 to 18 in 10 communities across the United States to talk about their\nexperiences with food insecurity. First, the study found that teenagers suffer problems just as\nmuch as little kids do from food insecurity. Second, the study found that teenagers are totally\naware of the problem; they understand that healthy food is expensive and that their families\nmake sacrifices so that all the kids can eat. Third, the teenagers in the study talked about how\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 90 they find ways to get food, from staying at a friend\u2019s family\u2019s house to engaging in criminal\nactivities like shoplifting. Finally, Popkin\u2019s study talked about federal policy implications and about\nhow teenagers are capable of solving the problem of teen hunger if they work together in\norganizations.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 3: Summarizing 91 6.

INTRODUCTION\nResponding to a text involves more skills than you may think: you need to understand the text generally\nin order to respond to a relevant point, distinguish between fact and the author\u2019s opinion, understand\nwhat that opinion means, be able to think critically about that opinion, and respond to it with support.\nOur goals for this chapter include:\n\u25cf expanding understanding of annotating to include annotating to respond to the text\n\u25cf distinguishing between facts and opinions\n\u25cf demonstrating the ability to think critically by using multiple response strategies\n\u25cf organizing, outlining, and writing a summary\/response essay\n\u25cf distinguishing between your ideas and ideas from a source in your writing\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 97 2. ANNOTATING TO RESPOND\nThis section tackles response annotating; for annotating to summarize, seeChapter 3.\nResponding to a text relies on being able to distinguish between facts or factual statements and the\nauthor\u2019s opinions or opinions quoted by the author. (For more on distinguishing between fact and\nopinion, seebelow.)\nA. What You Should Annotate\nFirst of all, annotate your reactions to the author\u2019s argument and not to factual statements;\nwhile you may find some statistics shocking, you cannot agree or disagree with facts or study\nresults. (See the section onDistinguishing BetweenFact and Opinionfor more information on\nhow.) Second, there are several questions that should stay in the back of your mind while\nreading in order to jumpstart the response process:\n1. Are the ideas clear and logical?Are they confusing?Are they true or\nuntrue in your experience?\n2. How strong is the argument?Are the examples convincing?Is the logic\nsound? Is the argument based on the current situation, and or has the\nsituation changed since the text was published?\n3. Did the author leave anything out?Is the author biased?Is there another\npoint of view or experience that the author hasn\u2019t included?\n4. How does this text fit into what I already know?CanI connect the ideas\npresented in the article with anything I\u2019ve read\/seen\/heard before?\nAdditionally, reread the assignment guidelines and ask yourself: what does your instructor want\nyou to annotate for? What do they want you to respond to: main ideas? Important supporting\ndetails? The purpose for reading will guide what you should spend time responding to and\nannotating.\nB. How You Should Annotate\nIf annotating by hand, as stated in the previous chapter on summaries, annotations for main\nideas and supporting details should be kept to the left side of the paper while annotations for\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 98 responses should stay on the right side of the paper. This visual separation helps you, the reader,\nkeep opinions physically separated from facts: otherwise, the writing may get confusing!\nAs always, annotate using words, phrases, or symbols: something you\u2019ll remember when you\ncome back to the article later. Don\u2019t use full sentences, as that not only interrupts the flow of\nreading but also preempts the outlining and writing process.\n3. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FACT AND OPINION\nTheoretically understanding the difference between factual and opinion statements is easy; pointing\nthem out in an actual text is difficult. Below are some defining characteristics of each type of statement,\nbut by no means is this an exhaustive list.\nA. Factual Statements\nStatistics and dates \u2013 numbers, really \u2013 can easily be classified as factual. But what about\neverything else?Factsare statements about real situationsor events, common knowledge,\nanything that can\u2019t be argued. These statements are signified by:\n\u25cf Signal Words:Although in academic discourse, theydon\u2019t often occur, there are signal\nwords that do indeed demonstrate fact.\nFact-based:It is a fact thatthe Earth\u2019s temperatureis rising.\n\u25cf Objective Language:subjectivemeans subject to interpretation,based on personal\nthoughts.

Opinion Statements\nOpinionsare just the opposite: statements of beliefor feeling. While these statements may be\nsupported by facts, there should still be at least one sentence that you, the reader, could point to\nthat demonstrates the author\u2019s opinion or argument. Characteristics of opinions include the\nfollowing:\n\u25cf Subjective Language:This includes adjectives andadverbs that qualitatively assess the\nsubject of discussion. The example from Part A is copied here:\nOpinion-based (subjective):The Earth\u2019s temperatureis rising at analarmingrate.\nFact-based (objective):The Earth\u2019s temperature isrisingat a rate of 0.15 degrees\nFeach decade since 1901.\n\u201cAlarming\u201dis an adjective that describes the risingEarth temperature . . . and the\nauthor\u2019s opinion about it.\n\u25cf Non-Neutral Verbs:Unlike a factual statement, opinionscan be characterized by verbs\nthat indicate subjective relationships. In the examples from part A, the verbcrushedis\nan evaluation of how the Chicago Cubs performed in the game.\n\u25cf Context:Some modifiers can signify both fact andopinion depending on the context.\nMost of the time, they demonstrate an opinion, but in scientific or academic contexts,\nthey can often demonstrate fact.\nMagazine article(opinion):Composting aloneis notan adequate solutionto food\nwaste.\nScientific article(fact):One pound of worms persquare feet of spaceis an\nadequate amountfor a composting station.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 100 PRACTICE 1: Distinguishing Between Fact and Opinion\nDistinguish between the factual and opinion statements below.

STRATEGIES FOR RESPONDING\nNow that you\u2019ve picked out appropriate quotations, and you have opinions about them, you need to\nlearn and apply strategies for responding to the author.\nAn effective response will:\n1. Use a Specific Point from the Author:The point orargument should be somewhat related to the\noverall main idea or an important supporting detail and it should be quoted directly from the\nsource.\n2. Be an Opinion, Not a Fact:Remember, you can\u2019t arguewith a fact!\n3. Be Well-Supported:Give enough detailed evidence sothat the reader fully understands the point\nyou\u2019re making; make connections for your reader.\n4. Demonstrate a Variety of Response Types:Variety makesthings interesting and spicy. Be spicy.\n5. Show Evidence of Critical Thinking:Critical thinkingmeans that you have analyzed and evaluated\nan article and its argument, and you have connected on a deeper level with the content.\nThere are three basic response strategies:\nWhile you may agree with much of the author\u2019s argument, disagreeing or\npartially disagreeing with specific points the author makes demonstrates\nAgree\/Disagree\/Both that you\u2019ve critically read the text and have engaged with it at a deeper\nlevel. With this strategy, you may give hypothetical or real examples or\nexplain further with facts as support.\nThis strategy uses your own experience as support and can be combined\nPersonal Experience\nwith agreeing or disagreeing in a response paragraph.\nThis strategy connects the text to another article, movie, TV show, or news\nprogram outside of the article that you are familiar with. The easiest source\nApplication\nto connect to is another article that you\u2019ve read in class on the same topic.\nAgain, this strategy can be combined with agreeing or disagreeing.\nBelow are examples of each response strategy. Different elements of the response are labeled and color\ncoded as follows:\n\u25cf the name of the author and the article title\n\u25cf the quote from the article\n\u25cf the student\u2019s explanation of this quotation\n\u25cf the student\u2019s opinion\n\u25cf the evidence the student uses to support his opinion\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 102 Agree\/Disagree\/Both\nIn \u201c Globalization and Local Culture\u201d, the Levin Institute argue that\u201cOne of the principal\nconcerns about the new globalization of culture that is supposedly taking places is that it not only\nleads to homogenization of world culture, but also that it largely represents the \u2018Americanization\u2019 of\nworld cultures\u201d (179).I disagree with the Levin Institute\u2019sview thatglobalization makes world culture\nbecome more similar to American culture.In my perspective,culture could be affected by other\ncountries' cultures who may be more powerful than their own, but others\u2019 local cultures cannot\neliminate or be similar to those powerful countries. Culture can be changed by people, but it cannot\nbe removed by globalization. For example, local cultures are just like human personalities, and as we\nknow that personalities are what we learn and form from birth. So that local culture is the true self, no\nmatter how good or how badly other countries' cultures affect, we cannot change what we have.\nLocal culture can absorb advantages from different cultures, but local culture cannot be eliminated by\nothers\u2019 cultures.\nPersonal Experience\nHowever,I disagree withDr. Kate Darling\u2019s opinion,who is quoted by the author,that\u201c\u2018the\none thing that does separate robots from other machines is that we tend to treat them like they\u2019re\nalive.\u2019\u201dDarling means that one way to distinguishrobots and other machines is how people treat\nthem; humans treat robots like they are alive compared to other robots.However, this is only partly\ntrue.Some people might say this is true because somerobots look like dogs, fish, insects, or even\nhumans, and robots perform some specific and hard tasks that usual machines cannot perform.\nTherefore, it is possible for some people to think of robots as living things. On the other hand, many\npeople treat robots and other machines as just tools or objects that can help humans to live more\nconvenient and efficient lives. For example, when I was young, I had a robot dog called AIBO. I played\nwith this robot a lot, but I knew that this robot had no emotions and was only repeating the same\nsentences or words that are downloaded in its algorithm. Even when I was young, I knew that it was\njust a robot. I did not feed or let AIBO drink water; I just charged this robot and played with it just like\nplaying with a normal toy. Therefore, I cannot understand that people treat robots like living things\ncompared to other machines.\nApplication\nThe New York Times Editorial Boardsays that\u201c[thebonds given as babies] were intended to\nchip away at the inequalities of wealth, and the resulting inequalities of opportunity, that weigh on\ndeveloped nations.\u201dThe NTY Board means that thisgovernment money would help lift up those\npeople who aren\u2019t as wealthy as others, therefore hopefully leveling out equality that would\notherwise drag down wealthier nations.I agreebecauseI read about how money given by the\ngovernment in a different situation is helping those who are less fortunate. In the article \u201cWhy Boston\nis Paying Ex-Gang Members to Go to College\u201d by Andrew Zaleski and CityLab, the authors describe the\nnon-profit organization College Bound Dorchester which gives a stipend to former gang members to\ngo to school, receive an education, and contribute to society. This program is helping to stop gang\nmembers from cycling in and out of prison and is opening up doors to them, doors that have been\npreviously closed because of economic factors. Zaleski and CityLab show that giving government\nmoney to people to further their education works, which is why I believe that the NYT board\u2019s solution\nof baby bonds would also achieve its goal.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 103 PRACTICE 1: Identifying Support Strategies\nIn the paragraphs below, decide which type of support strategy was used. Remember, multiple\nstrategies could be used in combination. Highlight words\/phrases\/sentences in the paragraphs that\nsupport your decision.\n1. Moreover, Esme Nicholson thinks that \u201cIt seems that, given half the chance, integration in\nGermany starts in the schoolyard.\u201d Nicholson believes that starting with children, people can\nslowly break some stereotypes. I agree with that. I think many of the older generation will be\nbiased against certain things or people because of the growing environment. With the\ndevelopment of the times, with the new generation of young people as a bridge, they can\neliminate some prejudice of the past. For example, my mother used to have a deep stereotypes\nagainst homosexuality. She used to believe that homosexuality was abnormal. I'm still impressed\nby her disgust when I first asked her what homosexuality was when I was a child. When I grew up,\nI really learned about homosexual groups through the Internet and some of my classmates. Then I\nfound out how wrong my mother's attitude towards homosexuality was. Accordingly, I began to\ntry to eliminate her prejudice against homosexuality through online knowledge and some\nhomosexual classmates around me. Even if it was difficult at first, now she can see homosexuality\nas normal people like us. Just as the white and immigrant groups in the author's article accepted\neach other through their children, my mother break stereotypes against homosexual groups\nthrough her child. Many elders will have prejudice against some people or things because of their\nenvironment, and their children, as people in the new environment, are a good way for them to\neliminate prejudice and accept new things. In short, I agree with Nicholson that people can break\nprejudice through children.\nResponse strategy:\n2. According to the article \u201cBreak up the Monoculture,\u201d Helena Norberg-Hodge explains that \u201cin\nfact, if efficiency is the yardstick, the goal should be to promote economies that are diversified\nenough to meet people\u2019s needs within the shortest distance possible, depending on long-distance\ntransport only for goods that cannot be produced.\u201d This indicates that when the government or\nthe global corporations make the solutions for the negative effects of monoculture, they have to\nconsider the distance of transportation and products where it was produced. I agree with the\nauthor because it is true that through globalization, lots of people have got benefits, but they\nhave to keep in mind the localization. Also, if people use local products instead of imported\nproducts to less distance and money and develop the local economy at the time. For example,\nbuying tangerine from a neighbor's farm is better than buying imported from South-East Asia\nbecause the distance is noticeably short which is much more efficient, besides, it would\ncontribute to the local economy. Therefore, the government and the global corporations must\nconsider not only efficiency but also local economies not to be destroyed and it is beneficial\neventually.\nResponse strategy:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 104 5.

SHOWING YOUR CRITICAL THINKING\nResponse paragraphs are meant to demonstrate how and how deeply you\u2019ve interacted with the\nassigned text. This requires that you engage in a bit ofcritical thinkingby deliberately employing\nthinking strategies to arrive at a more complete conclusion than you automatically would: the opposite\nof passive, everyday thinking.\nOverall, it\u2019s a process that requires constant re-evaluation of what you know and what the text is saying.\nThis is accomplished by asking different types of questions of both yourself and the text: questioning\nyour comprehension, previous assumptions, and existing evidence. There are four categories of\nquestions that every reader should ask themselves while reading.\nWho Said It? When Did They Say It?\n\u25cf Who is it? Are they someone in a position \u25cf Is the information current or old? Does it\nof authority or power? matter?\n\u25cf Are they an expert? What are their \u25cf Is timing important? Was this information\ncredentials or past work? released at this time for a specific\n\u25cf Does it matter who told you this? purpose?\nWhat Did They Say? Why Did They Say It?\n\u25cf Did they give facts or opinions? \u25cf Did they explain the reasoning behind\n\u25cf Have they provided all the facts? their opinion\/conclusion?\n\u25cf What have they left out, if anything? Is \u25cf What was their motivation?\nthat important? \u25cf Are they biased?\nThese are important questions to ask yourself outside of class as well, while consuming news or social\nmedia, when talking with friends, and when constructing any sort of argument: thinking critically isn\u2019t\njust an academic skill; it\u2019s a life skill that requires practice!\nPRACTICE 1: Applying Critical Thinking Skills\nRead the following statement. Then, with a partner, list what questions you can ask to critically\nevaluate this information.\nStatement:This morning, a report on the news saidthat the world\u2019s climate is actually changing\nat aslowerpace than previously thought.\nQuestions for evaluation:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 106 In a response paragraph, the writer\u2019s critical thinking is demonstrated through the support used. Here\nare a few tips to help you indicate how much you\u2019ve connected with the text.\n\u27a2 Use a variety of support types.Like mentioned above,the writer should vary the types of\nstrategies used to support the response. Relying only on personal experience, for example, hints\nthat the writer has only connected with the text in one way, whereas using both personal\nexperience and an example is evidence of multiple connections.\n\u27a2 Make outside connections.While sometimes a difficulttask in a timed situation, broadening the\nmind and pulling outside texts into the conversation signals an ability to recall information, make\nconnections between texts, and evaluate both arguments to come to a conclusion.\n\u27a2 Add something new to the conversation.Even if theparagraph offers an example or a personal\nexperience as support, the writer must further the argument and go beyond simply agreeing and\nrepeating what the author says.\n\u27a2 Be critical.Once the writer has identified what they\u2019dlike to respond to, they have to think\nabout all sides of the issue. Ask those questions.\n\u27a2 But don\u2019t (necessarily) criticize.Thinking criticallydoesn\u2019t necessarily mean being mean: the\nwriter can evaluate the author\u2019s arguments through critique and still end up agreeing with the\nauthor. Remember, the writer isn\u2019t assessing the author, just their arguments.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 107 7. ORGANIZING YOUR SUMMARY\/RESPONSE ESSAY\nA summary\/response essay consists of five paragraphs and four main parts: the introduction, summary\nparagraph, response paragraphs, and conclusion.\nFor the summary paragraph, follow the same guidelines as laid out inChapter 3. To review, a summary\nshould:\nSummary Components\n\u25cf Express the overall main idea in a one-sentence summary and include the article\u2019s title and\nauthor.\n\u25cf Outline all major important supporting details.\n\u25cf Identify how the original article is organized and demonstrate that organization through the\neffective use of signal words, phrases, transitions, and other cohesive devices.\n\u25cf Paraphrase by using the writer\u2019s own words.\n\u25cf Refer to the author often, especially by last name.\nA. Moves of a Response Paragraph\nThe response paragraphs (of which there are usually two) have three main components that we\ncan further break down into moves.\nResponse Components\n\u25cf Start with asignal phrasethat includes the author\u2019slast name\nand the article title (optional).\n1. Quotation\n\u25cf Quotea specific opinion or argument from the article.This point\nshould be integral and related to the overall main idea.\n\u25cf Providecontext\/backgroundfor the point (optional)and\n2.

Even though I\nactively deal with problems and work when I feel angry, I have often lost my reason and made\nthings go wrong. Therefore, \u201canger\u201d can be harmful or beneficial depending on how it is used\nand who\u2019s using it because each person has different tolerances.For example, if a person has a\nlow tolerance for anger, this anger will be a hindrance rather than the driving force behind what\nthey are trying to do.In other words, I don\u2019t thinkthat \u201canger\u201d always helps to make peace.It is\nonly when people think rationally and act rationally when they feel anger, rather than act\nimmediately, that anger is used as a good driving force in peacemaking.\nPRACTICE 1: Analyzing a Response Paragraph\nColor code the different moves in the response paragraph below then evaluate it.\n\u25cf Signal phrase\n\u25cf Specific point from the article\n\u25cf Context and\/or explanation\n\u25cf Agree or disagree and why\n\u25cf Support\n\u25cf Significance\n\u25cf Connection back to author\u2019s point\nIn the article \u201cBreak Up the Monoculture,\u201d the author Helena Norberg-Hodge reveals that\n\u201clong-term solutions to today\u2019s social and environmental problems will also require a range of\nsmall, local initiatives that are as diverse as the cultures and environments in which they take\nplace.\u201d It is true that whatever society suggests, these issues will be difficult to solve with one\nblanket solution. For example, there is a developing country which does not have enough\nresources in comparison with advanced countries. Any solution for advanced countries is useless\nfor developing countries. That\u2019s why monoculture is the problem: it is impossible to unify\ncountless diverse aspects into one culture when they have such different needs to take into\naccount. As a result, even though the world needs lots of efforts to make various solutions for\nthe negative effects of globalization, it is essential to keep developing those solutions on a local\nrather than global level.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 109 PRACTICE 2: Practicing Response Moves\nPick an opinion from the article you read for your summary assignment.

EXAMPLE SUMMARY\/RESPONSE ESSAY\nFollowing is a sample student essay based onthisarticle.\nRobots: One Size Does Not Fit All\nIn her article, \u201cRobot Helps Sick Children Feel Less Lonely,\u201d Anna Matteo writes that a\nsmart robot called AV1 can help sick children feel better by alleviating feelings of isolation.\nWhile Mateo believes that AV1 can help sick children, I believe it is necessary to admit that this\n1\nrobot can solve some problems for these children, but it can\u2019t help every child because robots\ncan\u2019t replace a child\u2019s relationship with friends, nor can they help children of different ages\nequally.\nAnna Matteo\u2019s article describes how robots may be able to help sick children feel less\nlonely. Matteo writes that as a result of long-term illnesses, sick children have to recover at\nhome or in the hospital. As a way to help these children, the robot can go to school for the them.\nMatteo mentions that by using a tablet or a phone to control the robot, children can take part in\n2\nclassroom activities wherever they are. In order to make communication easier, the robot was\ndesigned with speakers, microphones and cameras. Matteo concludes that children can make\ngood use of the robot and feel less lonely with the company that AV1 robot can provide.\nMatteo states, \u201cThe robot takes their place at school. Through the robot, children can hear\ntheir teachers and friends.\u201d In this passage, Mateo attempts to describe how the robot helps\nchildren to interact with their classmates and teachers. However, while these robots are useful in\nsome ways, they can\u2019t replace humancompany, especiallyfrom parents and friends. Only\nwatching or listening to their friends is not enough to make them not feel lonely. While I\u2019ve\nnever had the benefit of having a robot go to school for me when I was sick, I was once forced\n3\nto miss three weeks of school because of the chicken pox. In order to not have me fall behind in\nmy studies, two of my friends collected my lessons each day and brought them to me. Because\nmy illness was contagious, they were not allowed to stay and visit, but we would spend several\nhours on the phone once they got home so that they could tell me all about what was going on at\nschool. While this helped me not to feel so disconnected from school and my friends, it was no\nsubstitute for actually being in school, and for those three weeks I was very lonely and impatient\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 114 to get better. I imagine that having a robot attend school for me would have been a similar\nexperience, giving me a glimpse into what I was missing, but not completely alleviating my\nloneliness because my face-to-face contact with my friends would still be limited.\nIn her article, Matteo does not specify the particular ages of children who might best be\nhelped through the AV1 technology but instead vaguely refers only to \u201cchildren who are\nrecovering from long-term illnesses in the hospital or at home.\u201d As a result, readers do not have\nmuch information specifically about which children this robot would benefit. This information\nwould be vital for readers to know because it is important to note that robots cannot effectively\nhelp children of different ages. It\u2019s not clear from the article whether she\u2019s taking into\nconsideration the idea that child\u2013robot interaction is more engaging for an 8-year-old child than\n4\nfor one who is 12 or 14. A younger child would likely be more engaged in the novelty of having\na robot; older children would likely lose interest much more quickly and become bored and\nimpatient as they recover from their illness. This may negatively affect their ability to focus on\nthe lessons they are missing and to catch up with their classmates. For this reason, it is important\nto consider the child\u2019s age when we talk about the robots\u2019 effectiveness. In other words, children\nof different ages will react differently to the robot. Thus, a robot can\u2019t help them all in the same\nway and may be more effective for younger children.\nWhile Matteo believes that robots can help sick children considerably, it is clear that there\nare some limitations.

While Mateo believes that AV1 can help sick children, I believe it is necessary\nto admit that this robot can solve some problems for these children, but it can\u2019t help every\nchild because robots can\u2019t replace a child\u2019s relationship with friends, nor can they help\nchildren of different ages equally.\n1.

Matteo writes that as a result of long-term illnesses, sick children have to recover at\nhome or in the hospital. As a way to help these children,the robot can go to school for the\nthem. Matteo mentions that by using a tablet or a phone to control the robot, children can\ntake part in classroom activities wherever they are. In order to make communication easier,\nthe robot was designed with speakers, microphones and cameras. Matteo concludes that\nchildren can make good use of the robot and feel less lonely with the company that AV1\nrobot can provide.\n1. What\u2019s the purpose of Paragraph 2?\n2.

Which aspects are unclear?\nParagraph 3 (Response 1)\nMatteo states, \u201cThe robot takes their place at school. Through the robot, children can\nhear their teachers and friends.\u201d In this passage, Mateo attempts to describe how the robot\nhelps children to interact with their classmates and teachers. However, while these robots\nare useful in some ways, they can\u2019t replace humancompany, especially from parents and\nfriends. Only watching or listening to their friends is not enough to make them not feel\nlonely. While I\u2019ve never had the benefit of having a robot go to school for me when I was\nsick, I was once forced to miss three weeks of school because of the chicken pox. In order\nto not have me fall behind in my studies, two of my friends collected my lessons each day\nand brought them to me. Because my illness was contagious, they were not allowed to stay\nand visit, but we would spend several hours on the phone once they got home so that they\ncould tell me all about what was going on at school. While this helped me not to feel so\ndisconnected from school and my friends, it was no substitute for actually being in school,\nand for those three weeks I was very lonely and impatient to get better. I imagine that\nhaving a robot attend school for me would have been a similar experience, giving me a\nglimpse into what I was missing, but not completely alleviating my loneliness because my\nface-to-face contact with my friends would still be limited.\n1.

Is the student\u2019s response listed in their thesis?Highlightit in the thesis.\nParagraph 4 (Response 2)\nIn her article, Matteo does not specify the particular ages of children who might best be\nhelped through the AV1 technology but instead vaguely refers only to \u201cchildren who are\nrecovering from long-term illnesses in the hospital or at home.\u201d As a result, readers do not\nhave much information specifically about which children this robot would benefit. This\ninformation would be vital for readers to know because it is important to note that robots\ncannot effectively help children of different ages. It\u2019s not clear from the article whether\nshe\u2019s taking into consideration the idea that child\u2013robot interaction is more engaging for an\n8-year-old child than for one who is 12 or 14. A younger child would likely be more\nengaged in the novelty of having a robot; older children would likely lose interest much\nmore quickly and become bored and impatient as they recover from their illness. This may\nnegatively affect their ability to focus on the lessons they are missing and to catch up with\ntheir classmates. For this reason, it is important to consider the child\u2019s age when we talk\nabout the robots\u2019 effectiveness. In other words, children of different ages will react\ndifferently to the robot. Thus, a robot can\u2019t help them all in the same way and may be more\neffective for younger children.\n1. What\u2019s the purpose of Paragraph 4?\n2. Underline Sentence 1.What information is includedin the first sentence of\nParagraph 4?\n3. Highlightany quotes or paraphrases.

Is the student\u2019s response listed in their thesis?Highlightit in the thesis.\nParagraph 5 (Conclusion)\nWhile Matteo believes that robots can help sick children considerably, it is clear that\nthere are some limitations. Robots can provide some help, but the help still can\u2019t replace the\nintimacy and caring of human beings and can\u2019t equally help children of different ages. In\norder to improve the relationship between children and robots, we should consider tailoring\nthe individual robot to the specific needs and age of the child and take different factors into\naccount in our future robots\u2019 design.\n1.

CITING YOUR SOURCE: DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN YOUR IDEAS AND\nSOURCE IDEAS\nWhen incorporating outside sources or ideas into your essay, the first thing to consider is how to avoid\nplagiarism, which involves citing your source and distinguishing between the source\u2019s ideas and your\nideas. A clear distinction also removes any confusion on the reader\u2019s part as to which ideas belong to\nwhom.\nThere are three strategies, used in combination to distinguish between idea sources.\nA. Quotation Marks\nPunctuation marks are the easiest, most distinct way of separating a source\u2019s ideas from your\nown both before the source material begins and after it ends. Use double quotation marks (\u201c...\u201d)\nwhen quoting directly from a source. Everything from the source should fall within those marks,\nincluding punctuation; only if there is a citation does the citation and punctuation go outside the\nlast mark.\nEx. A wise person once said, \u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d I agree with this idea because. . .\nAs Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez states in his book Love in the Time of Cholera, \u201cWhat matters in\nlife is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it\u201d (1).\nB. Signal Phrases\nSignal phrases introduce quotations, and they aren\u2019t just forone-sentence summaries; they\u2019re\nused any time ideas and words are introduced which don\u2019t belong to the writer. This phrase tells\nthe reader that the following information comes from someone other than the writer, therefore\ndistinguishing it from the previous sentences and is particularly important for paraphrases or\nsummaries as there is no punctuation to visually separate the ideas. For more information on\nsignal phrases, including templates, seeChapter 1.\nC. In-Text Citation\nIf signal phrases mark the end of the writer\u2019s thoughts and the beginning of outside ideas, then\nin-text citations mark the end of outside ideas and the reprise of the writer\u2019s argument. Not all\ntexts and not all situations required in-text citation after source material, however. To learn the\nrules, seeChapter 5.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 4: Responding to a Text 121 12.

INTRODUCTION\nYour next writing assignment is an argumentative research paper, one based on both your own\nexperienceandoutside resources. This assignmentis where you get to put all of your skills together:\nparaphrasing, summarizing, critical thinking, clear organization and logical cohesion, developing and\nsupporting your own opinions . . . the research paper has it all.\nResearch papers can seem like a large, daunting task, but they don\u2019t have to be! Think of this assignment\nas a chance to start exploring your own writing voice.\nThe general organization of an argumentative essay is as follows:\nINTRODUCTION\n- Hook\n- Background Information\n- Thesis Statement\nBODY\n\u25cf Supporting Point 1\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\n\u25cf Supporting Point 2\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\n\u25cf Supporting Point 3\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\nCONCLUSION\n- Restatement of Thesis\n- Summary of Supporting Points\n- Final Comment\nHere are our goals for this chapter:\n\u25cf outlining an argumentative essay, including a solid thesis statement\n\u25cf analyzing the parts of a research question\n\u25cf developing an argument\n\u25cf locating sources and annotate them for evidence\n\u25cf using that evidence to compose source sandwiches\n\u25cf developing argumentation ability and critical thinking through incorporating opposing\nviewpoints\n\u25cf creating a Works Cited page with multiple sources\n\u25cf writing a 5-paragraph argumentative essay with an opposing viewpoint\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 127 2. CREATING AN OUTLINE\nA. Types of Outlines\nThere are different ways that you can approach outlining, all depending on how you organize ideas best.\nThe three most popular ways are a numbered outline, a graphic organizer, and a chart.\nNumbered outlinesare just like the outline above:they use a combination of symbols or numbers and\nletters to organize ideas. All of the same symbols represent the same level of organization. For example,\nall bullet points that look like this \u2022 could symbolize supporting points, this symbol \u25e6 represents\nsubpoints, and so on.\nGraphic organizers, on the other hand, use picturesto help organize your thoughts. Usually shown as a\nseries of connected bubbles, this outline method is very useful if you prefer to organize your thoughts\nthrough pictures or drawings. You can create your own graphic organizer or download one from the\ninternet for free.\nFinally, achartoutline is what you\u2019ve been usingfor other assignments, and it\u2019s what you\u2019ll use for your\nargumentative research paper. This method is a combination of both a numbered outline and a graphic\norganizer and can help you visualize how all the pieces of your essay will fit together.\nThis is the type of outline you\u2019ll be using for this assignment.While outlining, you can move throughthe\noutline vertically (column by column) or horizontally (row by row). Each row of the chart below the\ncolumn row will be its own paragraph. See below andAppendix Cfor the outline you\u2019ll be using.\nRemember, parts of this outline may change, and that\u2019s okay! Change means you\u2019ve evaluated your\noriginal ideas and have found flaws or ideas that are more effective, both of which shows you\u2019re thinking\ncritically about your own writing. That\u2019s a good thing!\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 128 3.

ANALYZING A RESEARCH QUESTION\nEvery research paper starts with a prompt or research question upon which the rest of your essay will be\nbased. The main goal of this assignment is to answer the research question; that\u2019s it! There are two main\nparts to the research question:\n1. Thetopic: usually a noun or noun phrase, this willtell you what you should generally write about\n2. Theorganizational focus: usually key words or phrases,this will tell you how you should organize\nyour essay, what genre it will be, and what kind of information to look for in your research\nExample Research Question:\nWhydoesclimate changeoccur?\nThetopicwould be \u201cclimate change\u201d and theorganizationalfocusis \u201cwhy;\u201d therefore, you would look\nfor information about and organize your essay around the causes of climate change.\nA. Types of Organizational Focus\nThere are many different ways to approach a given topic, which is why theorganizational focus\nis included in the research question: to narrow the scope of your search. Think of organizational\nfocus as the organizational pattern of your own text: the focus of a research question points you\ntowards the specific aspect of your topic that you are going to argue and develop throughout\nyour paper. The different types of focus you may encounter look very similar to the\norganizational patterns we\u2019ve been discussing so far.\nORGANIZATIONAL FOCUS EXAMPLE\nArgument- \u201cshould\u201d**usually a yes\/no Shouldthe government or private industries\nquestion be responsible for solving climate change?\nCause- \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201creasons\u201d Whydoes climate change occur?\nEffect- \u201ceffect,\u201d \u201cconsequence,\u201d \u201cimpact,\u201d What is theimpactof climate change?\n\u201cresult\u201d\nProblem and Solution- \u201cproblem,\u201d Howcan we solve climate change?\n\u201csolution,\u201d \u201cissue\u201d What are differentproblemsconnected to\nclimate change?\nPro\/Con- \u201cadvantage,\u201d \u201cdisadvantage, What are theadvantagesof solving climate\n\u201cpositive\u201d change to developing countries?\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 130 Comparison- \u201csimilar,\u201d \u201cdifferent,\u201d Comparethe effects of climate change on\n\u201ccompare\u201d coastal regions and desert regions.\nDefinition- \u201cdefine,\u201d \u201cin other words\u201d Describe thesignsof climate change.\nProcess- \u201csteps,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201cprocess\u201d What are thestagesof climate change?\nJust like organizational patterns for summary\/response essays, organizational focuses can be\nmixed in a research question to inspire a more complex response.\nPRACTICE 1: Identifying Organizational Focus\nFor the research questions that follow, identify the topic and organizational focus.\nResearch Question 1:How do expectations about studyingabroad differ from reality?\nTopic:\nOrganizational focus:\nResearch Question 2:What effect does meditation haveon a student\u2019s mental health?\nTopic:\nOrganizational focus:\nResearch Question 3:Should governments provide aUniversal Basic Income (a salary for all\ncitizens, even those who do not work) for all of its citizens?\nTopic:\nOrganizational focus:\nPRACTICE 2: Analyzing Research Questions\nWrite or copy\/paste your two research questions below.

COMPOSING A THESIS STATEMENT\nYourthesis statementis the overall main idea ofyour essay; it shows readers your opinion about the\ntopic as well as previews what you\u2019re going to talk about. A reader should be able to point to this one\nsentence in your essay and know exactly what you\u2019re going to discuss as well as how your essay is going\nto be organized.\nThere are five characteristics of a good thesis statement:\n1. Most importantly, itanswers your research questionby including the essay\u2019s topic and\norganizational focus.\n2. Itprovides a previewof the essay\u2019s supporting points,in the same order as previewed in the\nthesis; these points are logically connected to the organizational focus.\n3. It isgeneral enoughto encompass the whole essaybutspecific enoughwithout going into too\nmuch detail.\n4. It useseffective vocabularyand parallel structure.\n5. It isone (grammatically accurate) sentence.\nBasically, follow this equation:\nTopic+Organizational Focus+3 Supporting Points\nThere is a difference between a topic and a thesis statement. As stated before, a topic is general \u2013\nusually a word or phrase \u2013 while a thesis statement is a complete sentence.\nExample Thesis Statement\nResearch Question:Why does climate change occur?\nTopic:Climate change\nThesis statement:A lack of governmental policies,municipal recycling programs, and\ncorporate accountability are all reasons why climate change is increasing.\nA. Parallel Structure in Thesis Statements\nThe supporting points previewed in your thesis need to be parallel or haveparallel structure,\nwhich means that each preview follows the same grammar rules. For example, if one supporting\npoint is listed as a noun phrase (such as WH-word + noun + verb), then all others previewed\nmust follow that same grammar. Structuring your thesis in this way makes your writing easier to\nunderstand.\nHere are some examples below. On the left, you have examples of thesis statements that are not\nparallel, and on the right, you can see a corrected version.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 133 Not Parallel Parallel\nClaudio\u2019s favorite things areplaying soccer with\nClaudio\u2019s favorite things areplaying friends, reading manga, and feeding his pet birds.\nsoccer with friends,to read manga, and\nhis pet birds.

The best friends are the ones who listen to you without judgment, support your decisions,\nand bring you food when you feel sad.\n2. Succeeding in their courses, understanding a new culture, and making new friends are the\ngoals of all international students.\n3.

Not only can you take a Chicago architecture tour this weekend, but you can also explore the\nneighborhood around UIC.\n5. The new TV show Tanya is watching is both dramatic and thrilling.\nPRACTICE 2: Improving Parallelism\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 134 Underline orhighlightthe part of each sentence that is not parallel. Then rewrite the sentence in\nparallel form.\n1. International politics is difficult to navigate because leaders change all the time, value\ndifferences, and changes happen slowly.\nYour sentence:\n2. Being able to secure a loan from a bank depends on your income and how much debt\nyou have.\nYour sentence:\n3. Good, well-draining soil and having enough light are both necessary if you want to make\nyour plants happy.\nYour sentence:\nB. Overview of Supporting Points\nThe third component in your thesis statement is the three supporting points you plan on\ndeveloping in your essay. They should explain three ways that the argument expressed in your\nthesis is correct. Think of them as chair legs propping up the seat of your thesis. Because the\nthesis is typically the first step in the research process, brainstorming answers to the research\nquestion is an effective way to gather the best of your ideas and craft a solid, logical argument.\nHere are some examples of a student\u2019s brainstorming process and their rough outline followed\nby the first draft of their thesis statement.\nCompare the effectiveness of nuclear energy and\nResearch Question:\nrenewable energy sources.\nOrganizational Focus of\nCompare\/contrast\nResearch Question:\n1.

Pollution\nLoss of habitat, overhunting, and pollution are three\nThesis Statement: reasons why animal species become endangered or\nextinct.\nA reader would expect the writer to discuss these supporting points in the same order as\npreviewed in the thesis.\nAdditionally, these supporting points may change once you start interacting with sources, talking\nwith classmates, and thinking more critically about the topic, and changing them is okay! For\nexample, you may decide to rearrange the order to make more logical sense or you may decide\nto entirely replace a point because it\u2019s not sufficiently supported by your sources or personal\nexperience. Just make sure you remember to change your thesis as well.\nPRACTICE 1: Analyzing Thesis Statements\nAnalyze each rough outline and research question and decide whether each thesis statement\nis a good answer to the research question, i.e. does it include an appropriate organizational\nfocus? Does it include an overview of supporting points? Explain your answer.\nRough Outline 1\nResearch Question: Should higher education be free for everyone?\nOrganizational Focus of\nArgument\nResearch Question:\nBrainstormed\/Possible 1.

Just Enough Information\nA good thesis statement gives just enough information to let the reader know the key points you\nwill make about your topic. After reading your thesis statement, your reader should be able to\nanswer the questions: what is this paper going to tell me, and how is this paper going to be\norganized?\nExample: Too Little Information\nBystander intervention can prevent crimes.\nWhat problems do you see with this thesis statement? Write your answer here:\nExample: Too Much Information\nThere are many reasons that bystanders don\u2019t intervene in conflicts such as they don\u2019t\nknow the best methods to intervene and don\u2019t know how to get involved, they think\nsomeone else is going to intervene instead and therefore they don\u2019t have the\nresponsibility to take action, and they believe they are going to get hurt in some way,\neither on purpose or on accident, and they don\u2019t want to get hurt.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with this one?

DEVELOPING AN ARGUMENT\nA. Parts of a Body Paragraph\nThere are four parts to a typical body paragraph:\n1. Topic sentence:This sentence conveys your supportingpoint and acts as the main\nidea of the paragraph. Each topic sentence should match one of the ideas conveyed in\nthe thesis, and this sentence should be the first sentence in the paragraph.\n2. Subpoints or claims:These are 2-3 ideas that helpsupport the topic sentence.\n3. Evidence:There are many types of evidence, but itall should support the claims made\nin the subpoints.\n4. Concluding sentence:This sentence should restatethe topic of the paragraph in a\nnew way and should be the last sentence of the paragraph.\nA fully outlined essay would look like this:\n6.A. Structure of an Essay Chart\nA fully outlined body paragraph would look like this:\nBODY\n\u25cf Body Paragraph\/Supporting Point\n\u25cb Topic Sentence\n\u25cb Subpoint 1\n\u25a0 Evidence\n\u25a0 Analysis of Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2\n\u25a0 Evidence\n\u25a0 Analysis of Evidence\n\u25cb Concluding Sentence\nEXAMPLE:\nTopic Sentence:Using social media is effective formaking social change because the information\non social media is extremely diverse, and people cancommunicateabout their culture fromlong\ndistancesand use that communication toeliminatesocial bias.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 141 Sub-point 1: With the development of the Internetand social media, communicationbetween\ndifferent countries becomes more and more frequent, especially for some countries with really\nlong distances.\nEvidence & Analysis: For those countries, they generallyhave greater differences in society or\nculture. Through social media, people in these countries can learn about the life and culture of\npeople in other countries. People always like comparison, so they can know and follow the\nexample of something from other cultures that they think is better than themselves or show\nthe advantages of their own culture through social media. So, social media can allow many\ndifferent cultures from different countries to compare and improve.\nSub-point 2: Second, a variety of sources caneliminatesome unnecessarysocial bias.\nEvidence & Analysis: Several years ago, there wasa serious social phenomenon in China,\nwhich was called regional bias. Henan Province is an important example. Henan has the largest\npopulation in China. So some people from Henan chose to go somewhere else to work, then\nthey took a lot of job opportunities in other provinces. This led to a large number of people\nhaving bad opinions of people from Henan, even if some of them had not really met people\nfrom Henan. After the widespread use of the internet and social media in China, many people\nfrom Henan could post their real life on social media to defend themselves against this regional\nbias online. It is actually very common for people to blindly believe others\u2019 opinions, which will\noften cause some social issues, but it is obvious that the diversity of information on social\nmedia can prevent and eliminate such bias.\nConcluding Sentence:Therefore, people can use socialmedia to prevent many social problems\nthrough communication even over long distances thereby reducing social conflict.\nREMEMBER!The example above is one complete body paragraphwith two sub-points. An essay\nshould have three body paragraphs in total.\nPRACTICE 1: Analyzing a Body Paragraph\nBelow is a complete body paragraph.

Indeed, in \u201cDrones, Ethics and the Armchair\nSoldiers,\u201d John Kaag mentions that \u201cthey now have \u2018leisure,\u2019 meaning they are not constantly\nafraid of being killed.\u201d In my point of view, as for the release of drones and other high-tech\nmilitary machines, less human soldiers have to appear on the battlefield, thus their lives can be\nsaved from warfare dangers. To a certain extent, AI makes the soldiers less afraid of being killed,\nthus allowing them to focus on accomplishing the mission in the war. A second advantage of AI\nin a military context is there are robotic assistants that provide help to injured soldiers on the\nbattlefield. There is a robot named Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot (BEAR) that can use its\npowerful hydraulic system to carry wounded soldiers over long distances and rough terrains like\nrocks or stairs. From my perspective, this robot not only helps keep the soldiers away from the\ndistraction of their mates\u2019 injuries while fighting but also helps remove wounded soldiers quickly\nfrom the battlefield, hence possibly saving many more lives. To conclude, wars are always crucial\nand brutal but thanks to the existence of technology, fewer deaths occur on the battlefield.\nB. Choosing and Organizing Supporting Points\nWhen you brainstorm answers to your research question, you will likely think of more than three\nanswers that appeal to you and that you may want to argue in your essay. You can\u2019t argue\neverything, so how do you decide? Choosing which supporting point to include is an iterative\nprocess, meaning that you may revise multiple times before settling on one set of supporting\npoints for your outline. You can start the decision-making process by answering the following\nquestions:\n1. Does this supporting point fully and directly answer theresearch question?\n2. Does this supporting point connect to and support the argument in mythesis?\n3. Is this supporting pointbroad enoughthat I can furtherdivide it into two\nclaims butnarrow enoughthat it doesn\u2019t deserve multipleparagraphs?\n4. Do I havepersonal experienceto support (or oppose)this argument?\n5. Do mysourcessupport (or oppose) this supportingpoint?\nIf you answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first three questions, the last two should be the final determiners of\nwhat supporting points you include.\nThe order of your supporting points should strengthen your argument: typically, writers put the\nstrongest point at the end\/body paragraph 3, second strongest at the beginning\/body paragraph\n1\/, and least strongest in the middle\/body paragraph 2. (There should be no \u201cweak\u201d arguments!)\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 143 II Body Paragraphs:\n1. 2nd strongest\n2. 3rd strongest\n3. 1st strongest\nPRACTICE 1: Ordering Supporting Points\nCopy\/paste your working thesis below.

You can use evidence to support your\nargument, give an example, acknowledge a weakness in your argument, and\/or add credibility\nto your argument by showing that others agree with you. In order to be considered effective,\neach piece of evidence must directly relate to the claim\/subpoint that it\u2019s proving. Evidence is\nwhat makes research papers unique: at least some of the evidence used in your research\npaper should be from a previously-approved (and cited!) outside source that is carefully\nchosen to support your argument.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to incorporate these sources into your body paragraphs in theComposing\nSource Sandwichessection later on in the chapter.\ni. Types of Evidence\nThere are multiple types of evidence that you can use in your essay, and you should vary the\ntype of evidence used based on the argument you\u2019re making and the evidence available. As\nstated previously, if you can\u2019t find evidence to support your claim\/subpoint, outlining your\nessay may become a dialogue between your ideas and what evidence you can use to support\nthose ideas, and you might consider changing your argument to fit the evidence you have.\nHere are some popular types of evidence and examples.\nFacts:statements that can be proven or are generallyknown.\nEx:Access to natural resources has been dwindlingaround the world for the last\nfew decades.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 152 Statistics:numbers, dates, data that usually comefrom published research or polls.\nEx:While the Earth\u2019s surface is nearly 70% water,only 2.5% of that volume is fresh,\ndrinkable water.\nOutside Sources:information taken directly from reputablesources such as newspapers,\nacademic journals, experts, lecturers, etc. These can come in the form of paraphrases (see\nChapter 2), summaries (seeChapter 3), or quotations(words, phrases, sentences taken\ndirectly from another source). When quoting, you use double quotation marks (\u201c . . .\u201d) to\nshow the exact words you\u2019re using.\nEx:According to a report from the National IntelligenceCouncil, \u201cthere are\nsignificant scarcity challenges for a number of key natural resources with potential\nimpact on US security.\u201d\nExamples:These are usually stories \u2013 sometimes trueand sometimes hypothetical \u2013 that\nprove your argument.\nEx:Lake Chad, on the border of Nigeria, Niger, andCameroon, is extremely\nimportant in the region but has steadily been drying up in recent decades.\nPersonal Anecdotes:stories and experiences that you,yourself, or someone you know\nhave experienced.\nEx:My grandfather\u2019s farm relies on a nearby riverfor water, but recently, there\nhave been longer droughts, and he has been having trouble watering his crops.\nFor your own essays, you\u2019ll want to choose a variety of evidence types, as this not only\nmaintains the reader\u2019s interest but also strengthens your argument by showing that multiple\ntypes of sources support it.\nPAUSE AND REFLECT\nAfter you read through the types of evidence above, discuss with a partner:\n\u25cf What are some situations when each type of evidence might be appropriate?\n\u25cf Which types of evidence seem the most appropriate for your research question?\n\u25cf Which types of evidence are you planning on using for your own essay?

Choosing Effective Evidence\nThere is so much information out there, and even though your choices are limited to the\nprovided source list, choosing which evidence to use can still be an overwhelming prospect. Here\nare some tips to get you started.\n\u27a2 First things first:read the titles on the SourceList. The entire Source List. Compare\narticle\/lecture titles to your subpoints and look for keywords and synonyms, and mark\nthose articles to look at later.\n\u27a2 You want tomake sure the sources you find will beuseful without wasting too much\ntime. Look up the sources you marked and skim them:look at charts\/graphs, read\nsubheadings, watch the first minute of the lecture. If it\u2019s an academic research article,\nread the abstract to see if the source will be useful to you. Use your browser\u2019s search\nfeature to look for keywords connected to your subpoint. Mark all relevant sources on\nyour Source List.\n\u27a2 Read the sources in their entirety.Annotate importantsections\/sentences that you\ncould use as evidence to support your argument. (SeeAnnotating for Evidence\nbelow.)\n\u27a2 Fill in any gapsin your outline with personal experienceor examples. (You could also\nstart with this step if you know you have relevant stories that support your argument.)\nAfter this process, you may find that you have more evidence than you could possibly use in your\nessay, especially if you have both personal experience and an outside source that are relevant to\nthe same subpoint. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll need to narrow down your focus and decide which\npieces of evidence will be the most effective.Thereare four questions to ask yourself when\ndeciding what evidence to use.\n1. Does this piece of evidence directly relate to my subpoint?\nReally effective evidence flows like an uninterrupted continuation of your subpoint.\nRemember: the evidence you use is meant to prove part of your argument; if it\u2019s\noff-topic or doesn\u2019t connect to this specific subpoint, it won\u2019t effectively prove anything.\nDoes the evidence help you make your point?\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 155 2. Do I actually understand what this piece of evidence is saying?\nIf you can\u2019t paraphrase it, you probably don\u2019t actually understand what your source is\ntrying to tell you, and therefore using it effectively in an essay will be extremely difficult.\nAsk your professor for help, or keep searching for a source that you do understand.\n3. Is this type of evidence effective?\nYour essay shouldn\u2019t consist of only one type of evidence: strive for a balance between\noutside sources and personal experience. Additionally, choose your evidence type\ncarefully. For example, statistics are always an attractive type of evidence, and you may\nwant to include some in your essay, but stop and think: can my subpoint be supported\nby statistics, or would an expert opinion be better suited?\n4. Is this piece of evidence too long?\nThe focus of this assignment is you, and your voice should be the most prevalent in your\nwriting; after all, the evidence is only supposed to support your argument. A good\nguideline is 2 sentences: if a quotation that you want to use is longer than two\nsentences, consider summarizing the relevant section or finding another source\/passage\nthat argues something similar.\nAnalyze your answers to the questions above and ask yourself if you need to make adjustments\nto the evidence you\u2019re using.\nPRACTICE 1: Identifying Evidence to Support Claims\nUsing the Source List, copy\/paste the titles of at least three sources that would be relevant to\nyour argument. If you can, include which subpoint\/claim the title could support.\nTITLE OF SOURCE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE FROM SOURCE\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 156 B.

ANNOTATING FOR EVIDENCE\nIt\u2019s easy to get bogged down in reading longer articles: especially when the topic is interesting to you,\nyour mind may start to wander from the purpose: gathering evidence. Besides all of the tips listed in\nChapter 1like skimming and highlighting, here aresome general tips for annotating your articles for\nresearch paper evidence:\n\u27a2 Keep an outline or at least a list of your subpoints next to you while you read. This will help focus\nyou on the task and the claims at hand.\n\u27a2 Decide how you read best, either on paper or on an electronic device. This choice will determine\nhow you annotate and take notes.2\n\u27a2 Mark anything that connects to one of your\nclaims or seems useful to your argument. Don\u2019t\nanalyze, just mark. If you\u2019ve printed the articles,\nconsider using symbols, arrows, or lines to mark\nimportant passages. If you\u2019re reading on a\ncomputer or tablet, use different colors to\ndistinguish between subpoints. In either\nmedium, make it clear which information goes\nwith which subpoint.\n\u27a2 Save your sources somewhere you can easily access later\/while you\u2019re writing! You don\u2019t want to\nbe lost on the internet while you should be writing in class. Suggestions: if working electronically,\ndownload and save your sources to your Google Drive, create a list of titles with links, or simply\nmark the links themselves on the Source List. If you\u2019ve printed the articles, consider buying a\nfolder specifically to store your research articles.\n\u27a2 Once you\u2019ve finished reading, go back and make margin notes\/comments matching the evidence\nto your subpoints. Consider color-coding your subpoints to more easily retrieve information.\n\u27a2 Copy\/paste or type your evidence onto your Outline in the third column (Evidence) next to the\nappropriate subpoint.\nAssignment 1:Copy\/paste your evidence (includingthe title of the article, author, and page number\nif necessary) into theEvidence column (Column 3)of the Outline. If you are planning on using\npersonal experience or examples, write words and phrases only.\nAssignment 2:Using the work you\u2019ve done so far inthis chapter, complete the Outline.\n2\"Styleful \/ artful highlighter pens drawing on paper \/ COPICS \/ sharpie\" by photosteve101 is licensed with CC BY 2.0.

COMPOSING SOURCE SANDWICHES\nIf you have ever written a summary\/response essay before, then you have incorporated sources into an\nessay: you have already picked out relevant information from an outside source, introduced it with a\nsignal phrase, and learned how to paraphrase it. Now you will take your source integration skills even\nfurther by learning about and writingsource sandwiches:how you will bring together thesubpointand\nevidencecolumns in your outline.\nA. Parts of a Source Sandwich\nThere are three parts to a source sandwich:\nWe refer to this writing strategy as a sandwich not only because there are three parts but also\nbecause the \u201ctop\u201d and the \u201cbottom\u201d of the \u201csandwich\u201d both come from the same source: you.\nThe bread in this analogy is your argument and the filling of the sandwich comes from a source.\nLet\u2019s discuss each of these sections separately.\ni. Claim\/Context\nTheclaim, as you know, comes from theSubpoint column(Column 2)in your outline and\nlays out the next part of your argument. You always want to start with at least one sentence\nof your own argument because the reader will want to know how this evidence fits into your\noverall argument. Starting out a paragraph with a source will cause confusion for the reader.\nContextis an optional, not-always-necessary partof the sandwich\u2019s first section that gives\nmore information about the source or the situation surrounding the evidence in order for\nthe reader to understand how it all fits together. Think of the claim portion as connecting\nyour argument to the evidence and the context as connecting the source to the evidence.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 159 Here\u2019s an example when both aclaimandcontextare necessary:\nPlanting a larger number of trees reduces the loss of water and the production of\npollution.Al Stefan tells the story of Uruk, an ancientcity dependent on the\ndevelopment of irrigation cities, as an example.Inhis article, \"What Happens if You Cut\nDown All of a City's Trees?\" Stefan argues that \"But without trees to filter their water\nsupply, Uruk\u2019s irrigation system became contaminated. Evaporating water left mineral\ndeposits, which rendered the soil too salty for agriculture.\"\nWithout the context in this example, the reader would be very confused: what\u2019s Uruk? A\ncity? A person? And how does it prove the writer\u2019s claim? The writer added a bit of context\nfrom the original article to help situate the reader in relation to both the claim and the\noutside source.\nBelow is another example where the context was simply more information expanding on the\nclaim.\nElectric scooter riders must be required to wear a helmet because helmets reduce the risk\nof serious brain injury.If a scooter hits a rockor a pothole, the operator could easily lose\ncontrol, fall, and hit their head. Brain injury would be a result.\nii. Source Material\nSource materialcomes from theEvidence column (Column3)of your outline and supports\nthe argument put forth in the claim. Therefore, when we say source material, we\u2019re talking\nabout anything from quotations of outside sources to examples to personal experience. Just\nlike there are numerous foods you can put into a sandwich, there are numerous types of\nevidence you can use for your sandwich, and they all get treated the same way in crafting\nyour argument.\nAs mentioned inChapter 1, you must always cite anyoutside information you use in an\nessay, and just like a summary or summary\/response essay, as mentioned inChapter 3, you\nshould introduce your source first. Introduce the source by including thetitleand the\nauthor\u2019s namethe first time you use it; if you mentionthe source again, you only need to\nuse the author\u2019s last name per MLA citation guidelines.3Additionally, remember to\npunctuate the title correctly.\n3 Different disciplines have different citation formats and requirements. This course uses MLA format. In future\nsemesters, check which format your professor wants you to use and adjust accordingly.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 160 Forlonger works, like books, useitalics.\n\u2192Things Fall Apartby Chinua Achebe\nForshorter works, like articles or TedTalks, usedouble quotation marks.\n\u2192 \u201cA Modest Proposal\u201d by Jonathan Swift\n(For more information on introducing a source with a signal phrase, including templates and\nsuggestions for signal verbs, seeChapter 3.)\nIf you are using information from an outside source, there are three main strategies for\nincorporating them into your source sandwich:\n1. Quote:As aforementioned, a quotation is a passagetaken directly from the original\nsource, which then needs to be cited. You would use this strategy if the original\nsource material says the idea in such a way that it cannot be improved upon, and a\nquotation should be no longer than 1-2 sentences maximum.\n2. Paraphrase:As you learned inChapter 2, a paraphraseis when you keep the\nmeaning from the specific passage of an outside source, but you put it into your own\nideas, cite the original source, and don\u2019t use quotation marks. You would use this\nstrategy to vary your evidence format and avoid quoting too much.\n3. Summarize:As you learned inChapter 3, a summaryboils down the information\nfrom a longer passage or source into only the necessary and important information\nthat pertains to your argument. You would use this strategy if the evidence you want\nto use is longer than 2 sentences.\nIn-Text Citations (MLA Format)\nIn order to give full credit to a source as well as to signal to the reader that your evidence is\ncomplete, you may need to include in-text citations. (For citing sources through a Works\nCited page, seebelow.) Starting the source materialwith a signal phrase that includes the\ntitle and author\u2019s full name shows the reader where the source\u2019s ideas begin, and ending the\nsource material with in-text citation shows the reader where the source ends and your own\nideas begin again.\nSources that have page numbers include books and some articles that were originally\npublished in physical journals, magazines, or newspapers; sources that won\u2019t have page\nnumbers include websites, articles published electronically, and videos. A good rule of\nthumb is to consider how you\u2019re viewing the source: if it\u2019s a website, there won\u2019t be a page\nnumber; if it\u2019s a PDF, check the corners of the pages for numbers \u2013 if there are numbers, you\nshould include the number of the page where you found your information.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 161 \u25cf When the source is used for the first time, and it includes a page number, the source\nmaterial part of the source sandwich includes theauthor\u2019s full name,title,source\nmaterial,andpage number:\nAsGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquezstates in his bookLovein the Time of Cholera,\u201cWhat\nmatters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you\nremember it\u201d(1).\n\u25cf If the same source is used again, and it includes a page number, the source material part\nof the source sandwich includes only the author\u2019s last name, source material, and the\npage number:\nM\u00e1rquezimplores the reader to\u201cthink of love as astate of grace: not the means\nto anything but the alpha and omega, an end in itself\u201d(35).\nOR\nAnother definition of love is\u201cas a state of grace:not the means to anything but\nthe alpha and omega, an end in itself\u201d(M\u00e1rquez35).\n\u25cf When the source is used for the first time, and itdoes notinclude a page number, the\nsource material part of the source sandwich includes theauthor\u2019s full name,title,and\nsource material:\nAccording toAngela Demarkoin her article\"Bike Helmets:Unused Lifesavers,\"\nwearing a helmet gives extra padding to the head and takes the shock of an\naccident, reducing head injury risk by 85%.\n\u25cf If the same source is used again, and it includes a page number, the source material part\nof the source sandwich includes only theauthor\u2019slast nameandsource material:\nDemarkoclaims thatwearing a helmet gives extra paddingto the head and takes\nthe shock of an accident, reducing head injury risk by 85%.\nOR\nIn fact, in terms of helmets,wearing one gives extrapadding to the head and\ntakes the shock of an accident, reducing head injury risk by 85%(Demarko).\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 162 Remember, authors are listed in the Source List and your Works Cited page by last name (e.g.\nLastName, FirstName \u2192 Demarko, Angela), and you will have to reverse the order when you\nrefer to the authors in your essay itself (e.g. FirstName LastName \u2192 Angela Demarko).\nPRACTICE 1: Incorporating Signal Phrases\nUsing the strategies above, introduce the quotations below using a signal phrase and correct\nin-text citations.\nOriginal Quotation:\u201c[M]inority students who attendracially segregated schools perform\nworse academically than minority students at racially integrated schools.\u201d\nCitation:\u201cNew York\u2019s Schools are the Most Segregatedin Mention:first mention\nthe Nation\u201d by Grace Chen; online article\nIntegrated Quotation:\nOriginal Quotation:\u201cCurrently, computational systemscan infer all sorts of things about\nyou from your digital crumbs, even if you have not disclosed those things.\u201d\nCitation:\u201cMachine Intelligence Makes Human Morals Mention:second mention\nMore Important\u201d by Zeynep Tufecki; TedTalk\nIntegrated Quotation:\nOriginal Quotation:\u201cGrowth of culture, inheritanceand transmission is through\ncommunication, language, symbols and other artistic forms.\u201d\nCitation:\u201cCulture, Tradition, and Globalisation:Some Mention:second mention\nPhilosophical Questions\u201d by Asha Mukherjee; journal\narticle; found on page 54\nIntegrated Quotation:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 163 iii. Analysis\/Comment\nTheanalysis and commentare arguably the most importantpart of your source sandwich.\nThis section is where you connect the evidence and your argument and expand on them; it\u2019s\nwhere the heart of your argument happens, so logically it should be the most\nwell-developed portion. There are two components \u2013 the analysis and comment, of course \u2013\nand they serve different functions.\n\u25cf Theanalysisparaphrases, rephrases, or explains whatyou think the author means. It\nhighlights in your own words the most important point the evidence makes.\n\u25cf Thecommentexplains how the source material fitsinto your argument, whether it\nsupports oropposesit, and finishes by wrapping upthat subpoint\/portion of the\nargument.\nYou never want to end a paragraph on the source material: the reader needs to understand\nhow you interpret the evidence and how you think it supports your argument, and the\nanalysis\/comment is where the writer explains that logic.\nHere\u2019s an example of one writer\u2019sanalysisandcomment:\nThis reduction is directly attributable to wearing helmets.Because scooters are\nunprotected and can travel at relatively fast speeds, the risk of injury \u2013 especially head\ninjury \u2013 is large. Concussions and similar consequences cause lasting damage such as\nlight sensitivity, memory issues, and even death in severe circumstances. If bicyclists are\nrequired to wear helmets, operators of motorized scooters should be held to the same\nrequirements. Scooter riders must protect themselves with a helmet.\nB. Putting It All Together\nA full source sandwich withclaim\/context,sourcematerial, andanalysis\/commentwould look\nlike this:\nElectric scooter riders must be required to wear a helmet\nbecause helmets reduce the risk of serious brain injury. If a\nscooter hits a rock or a pothole, the operator could easily lose\ncontrol, fall, and hit their head. Brain injury would be a result.\nAccording to Angela Demarko in her article \"Bike Helmets:\nUnused Lifesavers,\" wearing a helmet gives extra padding to\nthe head and takes the shock of an accident, reducing head\ninjury risk by 85% (348).This reduction is directlyattributable\nto wearing helmets.

If bicyclists are required to wear helmets,\noperators of motorized scooters should be held to the same requirements. Scooter riders must\nprotect themselves with a helmet.\nREMEMBER!Each subpoint should be its own source sandwich.Therefore, each body paragraph\nshould have two source sandwiches, and the whole essay should contain 6 source sandwiches.\nINTRODUCTION\n- Hook\n- Background Information\n- Thesis Statement\nBODY\n\u25cf Supporting Point 1\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\n\u25cf Supporting Point 2\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\n\u25cf Supporting Point 3\n\u25cb Subpoint 1 + Evidence\n\u25cb Subpoint 2 + Evidence\nCONCLUSION\n- Restatement of Thesis\n- Summary of Supporting Points\n- Final Comment\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 165 PRACTICE 1: Analyzing Source Sandwiches\nFollow the directions below to determine which sentences belong in which parts of the source\nsandwich.\n1.

One reason AI creates jobs is machines need supervision and monitoring.\nDriverless cars help in reducing risk on road and at the same time create jobs for people for\nsupervision. In the article \u201cMaking AI Into Jobs\u201d by David Rotman explains the concept of\nself-driven cars has come into the economy which is reducing accidents, risk of lives and is\ncreating jobs for humans for monitoring and guiding robots (4). Driverless cars may be safe but\nat the same time, humans are required to ensure that the robots are functioning properly or not.\nHumans still need to keep an eye on the machines as they always cannot work solely. Either the\nautomobile companies or the government would create supervisory jobs for humans to monitor\nthe functioning of robots.Hence, robots supplement people rather than taking away their jobs\ncompletely.\nParagraph 2:\nMoreover, a large part of air pollution in cities comes from automobile exhaust, and the\nconstruction of a perfect public transport system can greatly reduce the use of cars, but this\nsolution needs a lot of money.

Manole\nOlivia-Elena say that \u201ctransport, besides their positive impact on the developing of economy and\nthe welfare of civilians, because of its increasing number, has become one of the major sources\nof pollution, both because of the noise, but mostly because of the gas emissions with\ngreenhouse effect being responsible for the global warmth\u201d in the article \u201cTransportation.\nPollution. Fiscality\u201d (33). As Olivia-Elena said, more and more cars have become one of the main\ncauses of air pollution. The way to solve this problem is to provide people with a more\nconvenient and cheaper way to go outside, so that they can give up driving. And a perfect public\ntransport system just meets this standard.

OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS\nOppositionsare a necessary part of the argumentationprocess. They demonstrate that the writer is fair\nand unbiased, that the writer has considered all the information on both sides and has come to the\nconclusion that their opinion is the strongest. Basically, writers use oppositions to demonstrate to the\nreader how and why the writer\u2019s opinion is superior.\nThere are three basic parts of an opposition:\n1. Opposing View\n2. Concession (optional)\n3. Refutation\n1. Theopposing viewpointis an idea or opinion thatis the opposite of your argument: it\u2019s an idea\nyou do not support. In your essay, the opposing viewpoint should be completely distinct from\nany other point already argued, e.g. if two supporting points argue that the social media has\nnegative effects on relationships and students\u2019 health, the opposing viewpoint cannot be that\nsocial media has positive effects on relationships; the writer has already argued that idea.\nInstead, the opposing viewpoint should be an entirely new idea that hasn\u2019t been previously\ndiscussed in the essay.\n4\n2. The second part of an opposition is the concession,\nwhich admits that the opposing viewpoint ispartiallycorrect.\nThe concession acts as a bridge or transition between the\nopposing viewpoint and the refutation and shows, again, that\nthe writer is fair and unbiased. This portion of an opposition\nisn\u2019t always necessary, and an opposition without a separate\nconcession sentence is called a simple concession (discussed\nfurther below).\n3. Lastly,the third step in the process is called a\nrefutation. To refute means to explain why the opposing\nargument is incorrect or not as strong as the writer\u2019s\nargument, so this step highlights the strength of the original\nargument as presented in the essay. The writer should better support the refutation than the\nopposing viewpoint: after all, the writer believes the original argument is correct!

The writer cannot simply\nrepeat a previous claim or start an entirely unrelated debate: that choice would show that the\nwriter either doesn\u2019t have an answer to the opposing viewpoint or doesn\u2019t have confidence in\ntheir answer.\nAs aforementioned, asimple concessionis an oppositionwithout a separate concession; with this\nstrategy, the concession is built into the opposing viewpoint. The writer may choose this type of\nconcession for many reasons, for example to keep the focus on the refutation\/writer\u2019s own argument or\ndue to lack of space in essay requirements. A simple concession consists of only one sentence.\nSimple Concession (includesopposing viewpoint withbuilt-inconcessionandrefutation):\nFormula:subordinating concession word+opposingviewpoint+refutation\nAlthough\/Even though\/Though______,_______.\nWhile\/Whereas\/Despite the fact that______,_______.\nAlthoughcities don\u2019t have enough space to plant anentire forest of trees,even\nsmall clusters of trees scattered throughout the city can make a positive impact on\nthe environment.\nAcomplex concession, on the other hand, includesmore than one sentence for each step in the\nopposition; however, the concession is still optional.\nComplex Concession (includesopposing viewpointandrefutation):\nA criticism of trees as a solution to cities\u2019 environmental challenges is that cities\ndon\u2019t have enough space to plant an entire forest of trees.

INTRODUCTION STRATEGIES\nIntroductions can seem boring and like a chore if you allow them to be. However, you can keep them\nrelevant to you and your goal if you keep in mind the purposes of an essay introduction: to attract the\nreader\u2019s attention, identify the topic the essay will cover and why it\u2019s important, and ultimately lead the\nreader to the thesis. Writing that is clear and concise will give the reader an accurate view of what to\nexpect from the rest of the essay. Think of this part of your essay the same way you think of meeting\nsomeone new: first impressions are important, and you want your essay to make a good one!\nThe introduction of an argumentative research paper is not like the one you wrote for your\nsummary\/response essay; instead, these introductions follow the traditional pattern of any regular\n5-paragraph essay you have probably written in the past. They have three parts:\nINTRODUCTION\n- Hook\n- Background Information\n- Thesis Statement\nThehookis what you use to engage your reader\u2019s attention.Some example hooks are:\n\u25cf General statement\n\u25cf Interesting fact or statistic\n\u25cf Quotation\n\u25cf Shocking statement\n\u25cf Anecdote*: a brief story that can help set the scene for the rest of the intro\n\u25cf Question*\n*While these techniques are effective in hooking the reader, they are not as common in formal or\nacademic writing and should be avoided if possible.\nAnoverviewof orbackground informationabout thetopic is the second and often overlooked part of\nan introduction. You can\u2019t assume that the reader knows everything that you do, so this section prepares\nthe reader for the essay by giving them any prior knowledge they may need in order to understand the\nthesis. Think of this section as adding context to the thesis statement.\nFor a reminder about thethesis statement, see thisprevious section.\nAs for deciding which information to include and how to include it, there are two popular introduction\nstrategies.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 175 A. Funnel Strategy\nIf you\u2019ve ever used a funnel while cooking, you will\nprobably understand this concept. In this strategy, the\ninformation in the introduction transitions from more\ngeneral in the hook at the beginning to the most specific\ninformation being in the thesis statement at the end of\nthe intro. In picture form, it would look like this:\nIn the introduction below, the hook is ingreen, thebackground information is inyellow, and the\nthesis is inred.\nExample:\nThe question of productivity of employees at their workplace is one of the biggest interests\nof companies.In the 21st century, unique techniquessuch as computer gaming or napping\nat the workplace are used to make an employee more comfortable and productive at work,\nand employers are still working on developing techniques to make workplaces more\ncomfortable and due to the comfort employees will be more productive. The debate\naround how the inside design of the office affects employees\u2019 mood and working ability has\nbothered the minds of companies for a long time.Awell-designed office positively affects\nemployees\u2019 morale and health which increases a company\u2019s productivity.\nB. Turnabout Strategy\nA turnabout introduction includes an opposing viewpoint: the paragraph can start with the\nopposition and could comprise half the paragraph, or it could simply be the sentence before the\nthesis. Either way, the introduction would include both the writer\u2019s opinion and the opposite.\nIn the example below, the opposing viewpoint ishighlighted.\nExample:\nMany people's attention is focused on the issue of equality. When it comes to the biggest\nproblem faced by urban residents, many people think of equality at first because of recent\nheadlines. Granted, there is a serious problem of inequality in today's society.\nNevertheless, behind the issue of equality, there is a bigger and more fatal problem, that is,\nthe environmental problem. Nowadays, almost all cities are facing severe environmental\nproblems, and thousands of urban residents get sick or even die every year. Therefore, I\nthink the biggest challenge that city residents face is the environment and the government\ncould solve it by building more parks, contributing a better public transport system and\nmoving factories around the city further away from the city.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 176 PRACTICE 1: Analyzing Introduction Paragraphs\nRead the introductions below, and change the hook togreen, the background information to\nyellow, and the thesisred. If it\u2019s a turnabout introduction,highlightthe opposing viewpoint.\nWhat type of hook did the writer use? Was it effective? What feedback would you give the\nwriter, both positive and negative?\nIn the past, when the very first camera was invented, you had to sit still for 8 hours to take a\npicture of yourself. However, nowadays when you want to take a picture of yourself, it will just\ntake a second. Compared to the future, now our society has more developed technology and\nwe are living in the generation that cannot live without the technology or robots. In particular,\nrobotic technology is growing so fast that it could even replace humans\u2019 jobs. Today robots\nhave replaced humans in many different areas, and these changes have positive impacts to\nhumans, such as developed technology makes jobs easier, offers robotic friends and helps\nmundane tasks to be done in more efficient ways.\nType of hook:\nFeedback:\nI have had countless moments when I want to ask for help from a robot in my life. Although I\ndidn't know about robots at that time, I thought it could do anything. Whenever I didn't want\nto clean my house, I hoped that the robot could help me clean it; whenever I was in trouble, I\nwanted the robot to appear in front of me immediately. Of course, technology is constantly\nevolving. Although the robots are still unable to do some things, the above experiences are the\nexperience of many people. Robots are no longer far from humans, and they are slowly\nentering various fields of humanity, helping humans in these fields. Nowadays, technology has\nreplaced humans in a variety of ways, and I think these changes are mostly positive because\nmachines can guarantee work efficiency and quality, can make humans\u2019 lives easier, and\npromote economic development.\nType of hook:\nFeedback:\nAI taking over the world without realizing it is not a mere myth anymore. In this sensationalistic\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 177 era of globalization, robots have been spread in the presence of humanity. In a mere\ncoincidence, humans designed robots to behave as one human being. Not only that, but also\nrobots replacing humans in the workplace in several aspects are now becoming more real than\nwe have thought. Many would have asked, \u201chow can they help in our society?\u201d and \u201chow do\nyou feel collaborating with robots while working?\u201d This may sound unrealistic for people who\ndo not fully comprehend the utilization of robots. However, robots in our society have made a\npositive impact in helping factories to accomplish their tasks, supporting doctors to help sick\npeople, and assisting students in their studies.\nType of hook:\nFeedback:\nAssignment:Write the introduction to your researchpaper using one of the strategies listed above.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 178 12. CONCLUSION STRATEGIES\nIf the purpose of an introduction is to preview the essay content, the conclusion\u2019s purpose is to guide the\nreader out of the essay by reinforcing the argument one more time and offering an interesting closing\nthought. The conclusion, similar to the summary\/response essay, is organized into three parts:\nCONCLUSION\n- Restatement of Thesis\n- Summary of Supporting Points\n- Final Comment\nThink of it as wrapping the rest of the essay up like a present: the conclusion shouldn\u2019t introduce any\nnew information to the reader; otherwise, the present needs to be unwrapped again.\nWhen the writerrestates the thesis, they state theargument in a new way or paraphrase their original\nthesis statement.\nInsummarizing the supporting points or subpoints,the writer will highlight the most important\ninformation from their argument. Since in an argumentative research paper, the thesis should already\nreview the supporting points, most sentences in this section will summarize the subpoints instead.\n5\nFor a final comment, the writer leaves the reader with a special\nsomething extra to take away from the argument. The following\nstrategies are the most common in academic writing:\n\u25cf prediction\n\u25cf call to action\n\u25cf warning\n\u25cf suggestion\/recommendation\n\u27a2 TIP:Avoid giving an opinion as a final comment, especiallyin argumentative essays. The writer just\nspent the rest of the essay arguing your point of view: why would this opinion be any different? It\nonly becomes repetitive.\nIn the example conclusion below, the thesis restatement is inorange, the summary of the supporting\npoints is inblue, and the final comment is inpurple.\nExample:\nIn conclusion, office designs and layouts are important in improving the productivity of the\ncompany and increasing an employee\u2019s motivation in terms of morale and health.A good design\nimproves the well-being of the employees and reduces work-related physical injuries.Altogether, if\ncompanies are interested in increasing their financial growth, companies should invest in renewing\ntheir office space.\n5\"Gift\" by asenat29 is licensed with CC BY 2.0.

Was it effective? What feedback would you give the writer, both positive and\nnegative? (Hint: these correspond with the intros you analyzed earlier.)\nIn conclusion, developed technology like machines or robots have replaced humans\u2019 jobs in\nmany different aspects. This is because robots replacing humans makes jobs easier, provides\nrobot friends and helps mundane tasks to be done in productive ways. By using robots instead\nof humans, it makes the work to be done more accurately and faster. It can also be friends with\nthe people who have a hard time making friends or elderly people. It can finish mundane tasks\nlike lifting heavy things or taking care of the weak in more effective ways. Machines and robots\nare an important part of our life now, but it will be a more substantial part of life in the future.\nHence, robotics engineers have to develop and study harder about the robots to have more\npositive impacts for humans when it is replacing humans.\nType of Final Comment:\nFeedback:\nIn conclusion, machines instead of humans have more positive effects in some areas of work.\nAt work, machines ensure efficiency and quality; in life, it makes humans\u2019 lives easier.\nMoreover, machines can make the economy grow quickly. Even though robots have not been\nfully used in various fields, it is certain that robots will appear more widely in people's lives and\nwork, and will help people create a better future. People should not worry about how to\nprevent the ability of machines to surpass humans, because people's enemies are not\nmachines, but themselves, so people should constantly learn new skills.\nType of Final Comment:\nFeedback:\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 180 Allowing robots to interact and join human life will make positive impacts. Because of these\nrobots, they ultimately help us in warehouses, medical institutions, and also at school. The way\nthey assist us makes all jobs become easier and conventional rather than work by humans\nalone. I am sure that robots will be beneficial in our mortal life, because they continue to\ndevelop at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, society needs to believe that robots can make\nhuman\u2019s life easier; however, we should also utilize the power of robots so they will not fully\nundertake what truly belongs to us.\nType of Final Comment:\nFeedback:\nAssignment:Write the conclusion to your researchpaper using one of the strategies listed above.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 181 13. IMPROVING COHESION\nAmerican academic writing prizes ideas that are logically connected to one another. This clear, logical\nconnection is calledcohesion, and it comes in manyforms and should occur in many places. The places\nwhere readers look for cohesion in essays fall into two main categories: within paragraphs and between\nparts of the essay.\nBetween Parts Within Paragraphs\nBetween: Between:\n\u25cf Research question and thesis statement \u25cf Topic sentences and claims\n\u25cf Thesis statement and topic sentences \u25cf Subpoints\n\u25cf Body paragraphs\nThe strategies below can help writers connect these elements to increase cohesion and logical flow of\nthe argument.\n\u27a2 listsupporting points and subpoints in the thesisstatement or topic sentences,\nrespectively\n\u27a2 discuss supporting points in body paragraphs inthesame orderas they appear in the\nthesis statement\n\u27a2 repeat vocabulary:\n\u25cb same wordsfrom the thesis statement in the topicsentences of your body\nparagraphs\n\u25cb word forms(members of the same word family)\n\u25cb synonyms(words that have the same or similar meaning)\n\u27a2 usetransition words and phrases; seeChapter 3fora list\n\u27a2 usepointing wordssuch asthis, that, these,andthose\n\u27a2 usesimilar sentence beginnings\n\u27a2 usesimilar prepositional phrasesor subjects andverbs\n\u27a2 usecorrelative conjunctionssuch asnot only . .. but also, andboth . . . and\nUse a variety of these methods to 1) increase cohesion, and 2) keep the reader interested.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 182 PRACTICE 1: Identifying Cohesion Strategies\nAnalyze the following examples, and mark and label the various cohesion strategies that are\nused to connect the thesis statement and topic sentences.\n1. Thesis Statement:We could relieve our environmentby restricting the building, by\nimproving water-related systems, by strengthening the natural environment.\nTopic Sentences:\nWe could relieve our environment by restricting and limiting the buildings in the city.\nWe could relieve our environmental issues in cities by enhancing cities\u2019 water-related\nsystems, like the drain system, river control and redirect ideas.\nWe could relieve environmental issues in cities by enhancing cities\u2019 natural\nenvironment.\n2. Thesis Statement:Being able to focus on buildingskills for the future, decreasing the\namount of student debt, and decreasing income inequality are three reasons why higher\neducation should be free.\nTopic Sentences:\nFirst of all, higher education should be free because students could focus on their\nacademic work and build skills in internships, both of which get students ready for\ntheir future.\nAnother reason college should be free is the amount of debt students graduate with\nwould decrease, allowing new graduates to start their lives on a positive path and add\nmore to the country\u2019s economy.\nLastly, free college education would allow low-income students to succeed by\nbroadening school choice and eliminating the barrier to enter school.\n3. Thesis Statement:Renewable energy sources are moreeffective than nuclear energy in\nterms of their waste, safety, and storage.\nTopic Sentences:\nFirst, the amount of waste makes renewables more attractive than nuclear because\nwind and solar don\u2019t have byproducts and nuclear energy waste takes up a lot of\nspace.\nNuclear energy is less safe than wind energy because the waste is dangerous to store\nand nuclear technology can also be used to make bombs.\nNot only is renewable energy more effective because of waste and safety, but also it is\neasier to store because of batteries and the amount of time it can be stored.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 5: Argumentative ResearchPaper 183 PRACTICE 2: Applying Cohesion Strategies within Context\nIn the sentences below, decide how the ideas fit together, and identify the type of transition\nthat best fits.

INTRODUCTION\nYourFinal Portfoliois a collection of your writingfrom this semester, revised once more, to be presented\nto the English 160 Committee, who will use the portfolio along with your final exam essay to determine\nwhether you are ready to move on to English 160. The portfolio will be accompanied by a cover letter in\nwhich you explain what you have learned this semester and how you have improved each of the\nassignments you include in the portfolio. The portfolio gives you an opportunity to showcase your skills\nwith drafted writing, just as your final exam essay will demonstrate your timed writing skills.\nHere are our goals for this chapter:\n\u25cf Understand the guidelines for the Final Portfolio assignment.\n\u25cf Select writing assignments to include in the Final Portfolio.\n\u25cf Create and follow a Portfolio work schedule.\n\u25cf Practice various strategies for revising writing assignments.\n\u25cf Produce a reflective cover letter to include in the Portfolio.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 195 2. FINAL PORTFOLIO GUIDELINES\nThe final portfolio consists of thethreeprojectsyou have completed for class, allsignificantlyrevised\nusing peer comments and your instructor\u2019s written responses. To revise means to rethink, reconsider,\nrework, and rewrite to the best of your ability. It also means that you have considered the rhetorical\npurpose for the document and determined the best way to present that document according to its\npurpose.\nFor the last few weeks of the semester, you will engage in revising your\nthree projects so that they will serve as representations of your best\nwork for the class. A portion of our class time and homework time will\nbe devoted to workshopping our projects and continuing the revision\nprocess. You may ask questions, ask for feedback from your instructor\nand from your peers, as well as spend time in class working on your\nassignments.\nA.

The Cover Letter\nThe cover letter to your final portfolio should be a letter (addressed to the ENGL 160 Committee)\nwhich discusses your personal writing experience throughout this class.In particular, you should\nfocus on the writing process (brainstorming, drafting, peer review, revising, evaluation, re-revising)\nfor each of the pieces in your portfolio, what you have learned from it, and how writing and\nrevising that piece has improved your writing skills.\nThe body of your cover letter should discuss the three pieces you\u2019ve included in the portfolio.\nFor each piece, explain the following in a detailed paragraph or two:\n\u25cf why you chose the piece for your portfolio\n\u25cf how the original writing process went for the piece\n\u25cf how you changed the piece for the portfolio\n\u25cf why you feel the changes you made improved the piece\n\u25cf how the piece illustrates your abilities as a writer\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 196 You should write a fairly detailed explanation for each piece included in your portfolio. The goal of\nyour cover letter is to help your instructor and the committee understand your approach to writing\nand revising as well as the specific changes you made as you compiled your portfolio.\nYour concluding paragraph should make a case for why you feel you are\nready for English 160. It might include any realizations you\u2019ve made about\nyourself as a writer and any changes you\u2019ve made (or plan to make) in your\nwriting process.\nYour cover letter should be typed, single-spaced, between 600 and 750\nwords, and written using formal paragraphs.Take timeto edit and\nproofread carefully.\nC. Things to Remember\nYour portfolio represents your best work for the semester, and so it should be presented in the most\nprofessional manner possible. The guidelines below should be followed when putting together and\nsubmitting your portfolio.\n\u25cf Final portfolios must be completed in the Final PortfolioGoogle docyour instructor shares\nwith you, then submitted toBlackboard. Assignmentsthat are revised outside the Portfolio\ndoc and copied and pasted into it will not be shown to the English 160 Committee.\n\u25cf Final portfolios should consist of the final,extensively-revisedversions of your three\nprojects from the course and acover letterto theEnglish 160 committee.\n\u25cf Final portfolios should include aTable of Contentswith your name, class, etc., as well as a\nlist of all of your project titles and the order in which they appear.\n\u25cf The complete portfolio is due in theWriting Assignmentsfolder on Blackboard at the\nbeginning of classon the due date.\n\u25cf Any plagiarism, including of the cover letter, will result in your Portfolio not being shown to\nthe English 160 Committee.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 197 D.

SELECTING AND REVISING PORTFOLIO ASSIGNMENTS\nThe first step in compiling your portfolio is to review the writing you have done throughout the semester\nand to select the assignments you would like to include in your portfolio.\nA. Selecting Writing Samples for Your Portfolio\nThe purpose of your final portfolio is to show your instructor and the ENGL 160 Committee your\nunderstanding of the writing process and of specific types of writing and to demonstrate the\nprogress you have made throughout the semester. For that reason, it is important to carefully\nconsider which three assignments you will select for your portfolio. Here are some things to keep in\nmind:\n\u25cf Your instructor and the Committee are looking at your writing process. You should select\nassignments for which you have written multiple drafts. Each draft should show the types of\nchanges that you have made to improve the assignment.\n\u25cf You shouldn\u2019t necessarily select the three assignments you received the highest grade on.\nYou might also consider:\no Selecting works from the beginning, middle, and end of the semester to help\ndemonstrate your progress.\no Selecting works for which you see significant room for improvement so that you can\ndemonstrate your revising skills.\no Selecting works from early in the semester so that you can apply what you learned later\nin the semester to an earlier assignment.\n\u25cf For each assignment you select, you will need to explain in your cover letter why you\nselected it, what improvements you intended to make, and how you think those\nimprovements make the assignment better and demonstrate your skills.\n\u25cf You will have one last opportunity to revise the assignments that you select. While it\u2019s okay\nto talk with your instructor or UIC Global tutors about specific ways to improve your work,\nyou must not allow someone to edit or revise your work for you. The improvements made\nneed to be your own.\nSTOP AND REFLECT: Selecting Your Portfolio Assignments\nWith your team, talk about which assignments you are considering including in your\nportfolio. Why have you selected each one? How do you think improving it will\ndemonstrate your writing abilities?\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 199 SUMMARY SUMMARY-RESPONSE RESEARCH PAPER\nSelectONE: SelectONE:\n\u25cf Summary 1 \u25cf Summary-Response 1 \u25cf Research Paper\n\u25cf Summary 2 \u25cf Summary-Response 2\nB. Sample Table of Contents\nYou will compile your portfolio documents in the Google Doc that your instructor shares with you for\nthat purpose. A linked Table of Contents will be included in that doc. You will fill in some information,\nsuch as your name and the specific summary and summary-response assignments you\u2019ve chosen to\ninclude in the portfolio. Replace anything inredwith your own information.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 200 4. CREATING YOUR EAP II PORTFOLIO WORK SCHEDULE\nAs mentioned in theFinal Portfolio Guidelines, youhave the opportunity to revise and submit some\nof your writing assignments from this semester and to reflect on how you have grown as a writer.\nYou will have around two weeks to complete and submit your portfolio. To make the most of that\ntime, think about how much time you need to devote to each of the following pieces of your\nportfolio, and make a schedule to help you stay on track.\nFor each of the three assignments you are revising, use thisformto help you think through what\nchanges to focus on.\nAssignments to revise:\n\u25cf Summary\n\u25cf Summary-Response\n\u25cf Research Paper\nYou will also need to compose acover letteroutlininghow your writing has improved over the\nsemester and how you approached your revision of each of the three assignments. You can choose to\nwrite the cover letter paragraph by paragraph as you revise each assignment, or you can compose the\nfull cover letter after you have completed all revisions of your assignments.\nSTOP AND REFLECT 1: Reflecting on Past Writing\nDiscuss the following questions with your team.\n\u25cf Which assignment(s) do you think will take themostwork to revise?\n\u25cb What revisions do you want to focus on for that assignment?\n\u25cb How much time do you think it will take to revise?\n\u25cf Which assignment(s) do you think will take theleastwork to revise?\n\u25cb What revisions do you want to focus on for that assignment?\n\u25cb How much time do you think it will take to revise?\n\u25cf Which parts of the cover letter do you think will be the most challenging to write?

Make sure you\u2019re giving yourself enough time to\nwork on each assignment.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 204 5. THE REVISION PROCESS\nA. Annotating for Revision\nAs we\u2019ve learned and practiced throughout the semester, annotation involves reading closely and\nengaging critically with what you read. This has helped us to understand and organize the major\nideas of articles and other texts.\nOur current focus for annotation will require us to carefully and critically read the individual scores,\nfeedback, and comments your instructor has made on your writing assignments, and to use that\nfeedback to help us make decisions about how to revise our work for the Final Portfolio.\nIn order to effectively \u201cread\u201d a grading rubric, it is important to understand the difference between\nglobal and sentence-level writing issues and to pay attention to the global issues.\nB. Global VS Sentence-Level Issues\nTo help you understand and categorize the feedback you receive, we have identified three types of\nfeedback:global,sentence-level, andusing sources.Most of the items on a writing assignment\nrubric will fall under one of these categories. The chart below identifies writing issues under each of\nthese categories.\nGLOBAL ISSUES SENTENCE-LEVEL ISSUES USING SOURCES\n\u25cf responding effectively to the writing grammar issues \u25cf in-text citation\nprompt \u25cf verb tenses \u25cf references\/works cited\n\u25cf demonstrating an understanding of \u25cf subject-verb agreement entries\ngenre and rhetorical mode \u25cf pronoun reference \u25cf paraphrasing\n\u25cf demonstrating a good understanding \u25cf singular\/plural words \u25cf incorporating quotes into\nof the issue and\/or the reading(s) \u25cf parallelism your own sentences\n\u25cf main points are clear and logical \u25cf relative clauses \u25cf using source sandwiches\n\u25cf logical organization of ideas \u25cf prepositions effectively\n\u25cf ideas are adequately developed and \u25cf articles \u25cf understanding\/\nexplained \u25cf sentence structure (fragments, analyzing\/explaining\n\u25cf there is a variety of evidence in run-ons, comma splices) sources\nsupport of main points\/evidence is\nvocabulary issues\nsufficient\n\u25cf word choice\n\u25cf the draft fulfills the writer\u2019s intention\n\u25cf word forms\n\u25cf effective connecting ideas or\n\u25cf register\ntransitioning between ideas\n\u25cf flow\nmechanics issues\n\u25cf sentence variety (having sentences of\n\u25cf spelling\ndifferent lengths and with different\n\u25cf punctuation\nbeginning structures; using various\n\u25cf capitalization\ncomplex sentence structures\n\u25cf formatting\neffectively)\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 205 STOP AND REFLECT\nTake a few minutes to read through the list above. Are there any items that you aren\u2019t familiar with\nor would like an explanation or example of?\nWhy is it important to understand the difference between global and sentence-level\nissues?\nVery often students focus on improving sentence-level issues instead of global issues in their writing,\nmainly because these issues, such as punctuation and spelling, are easier to correct. However, it\u2019s\nimportant to understand that focusing on global issues, such as organization and development, can\nlead to more significant improvement in an assignment. As you decide how to approach revising\neach portfolio essay, focus on addressing the global issues first.\nA good place to start annotating for revision is the graded writing assignments you plan to use for\nyour portfolio, the rubrics your instructor used to evaluate each assignment, and your instructor\u2019s\ncomments on the graded assignments. In the rubric and the comments, your instructor is\ncommunicating what you did well on each assignment and how you can improve.\nIn addition to using instructor feedback, you can consider what you have learned about writing and\nthe writing skills you have improved on since you submitted the assignment, and check the\nassignment to see if there are ways you might apply your new knowledge and skills to improve your\nwriting.\nC. Strategies for Revising\nHere are some tips for annotating your writing assignments in order to revise them:\n\u25cf Reread the assignment guidelines, your submitted assignment, the rubric, and your\ninstructor\u2019s comments.\n\u25cf Take notes directly on the assignment and the rubric.\n\u25cf Highlight instructor comments that you wish to address, and make note of your ideas for\nimproving those parts of the assignment.\n\u25cf Number or indicate an order in which you want to address the comments you\u2019ve highlighted.\nFor example, it makes sense to improve your organization of a paragraph before you fix the\nmechanical issues because those sentences with mechanical issues may change or be\ndeleted.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 206 \u25cf Bring your materials to office hours or the Writing Center, and talk through your revision plan\nwith your instructor or a tutor. Ask questions to clarify feedback comments you are not sure\nabout, and make notes in your docs.\n\u25cf Take time to notice and keep a list of issues that come up repeatedly in your writing\nassignments. If you\u2019re not sure how to address these issues, ask your instructor for help.\n\u25cf Keep track of the issues you\u2019ve addressed as you improve the assignment.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 207 6. UNDERSTANDING AND USING INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK\nYour instructor provides written feedback on your writing in two ways:\n\u25cf the assignment rubric\n\u25cf comments\nThis feedback is meant to help you understand how you are performing on each assignment, including the skills that you are demonstrating\nsatisfactorily and those that need more attention. Your instructor intends for you to use this feedback to help you improve each assignment. This\nis particularly important as you work to improve your assignments for the final portfolio. Your instructor\u2019s feedback can guide your revision plan.\nA. Analyzing a Rubric\nLook at the rubric your teacher filled in for the Summary-Response assignment you are including in your portfolio. What type of feedback did\nthey give you? Categorize the feedback using the chart below.\nUnderstanding Instructor Feedback Chart\nGlobal or\n# of\nArea of Feedback Sentence Example Comments from Rubric or Instructor\nComments\nLevel?\nIntroduction, Organization, Conclusion\n\u25cf First sentenceincludes accurate and complete in-text\ncitation information and an accurate and brief\none-sentence summaryof the article.\n\u25cf The introduction includes a clearthesis statementthat\nagrees or disagreeswith the article.

VERBAL PEER REVIEW\nPeer review is an essential part of the writing process. It can help you as a writer to identify areas of your\nwriting that are confusing to your reader or that do not communicate as clearly as you wish. As you\nrevise each assignment for your portfolio, consider asking a classmate to peer review your work. You can\nuse the peer review forms we used for each assignment during the semester (see Blackboard). For a\nchange of pace, a verbal peer review can be helpful in collecting feedback.\nPortfolio Verbal Peer Review\nThe verbal peer review is a great way to get feedback on the assignments in your portfolio. It also gives\nyou the opportunity to talk through your revision process, which is an effective first step in putting\ntogether your cover letter paragraph for the assignment.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 212 8. ADDRESSING YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT REVISING\nBelow are common concerns that students have about revising their writing assignments, with advice\non how to manage each concern. For additional advice, talk to your instructor or a Writing Center\ntutor.\nCONCERN ADVICE\nThat\u2019s a common misconception that sometimes arises from fear,\nsometimes from laziness. The truth is, though, that except for\nthose rare moments of inspiration or genius when the perfect ideas\nWhenever I revise, I just\nexpressed in the perfect words in the perfect order flow gracefully\nmake things worse.

If a better thesis comes along, let go of the\nold one. Also, don\u2019t think of revision as just rewording. It is a\nchance to look at the entire paper, not just isolated words and\nsentences.\nIf you take revision seriously, sometimes the process will lead you\nto questions you cannot answer, objections or exceptions to your\nthesis, cases that don\u2019t fit, loose ends or contradictions that just\nwon\u2019t go away. If this happens (and it will if you think long enough),\nthen you have several choices. You could choose to ignore the\nWhat happens if I find that I loose ends and hope your reader doesn\u2019t notice them, but that\u2019s\nno longer agree with my own risky.

Or you could simply acknowledge\nthe contradictions and show why your main point still holds up in\nspite of them.

A sentence should be alive\u201d (Writingwith Power,\np. 135).\nPractical advice for ensuring that your sentences are alive:\n\u25cf Use forceful verbs\u2014replace long verb phrases with a more specific verb. For example, replace \u201cShe\nargues for the importance of the idea\u201d with \u201cShe defends the idea.\u201d\n\u25cf Look for places where you\u2019ve used the same word or phrase twice or more in consecutive\nsentences and look for alternative ways to say the same thing OR for ways to combine the two\nsentences.\n\u25cf Cut as many prepositional phrases as you can without losing your meaning. For instance, the\nfollowing sentence, \u201cThere are several examples of the issue of integrity in the book,\u201d would be\nmuch better this way, \u201cThe book repeatedly addresses the issue of integrity.\u201d\n\u25cf Check your sentence variety. If more than two sentences in a row start the same way (with a\nsubject followed by a verb, for example), then try using a different sentence pattern.\n\u25cf Aim for precision in word choice. Don\u2019t settle for the best word you can think of at the\nmoment\u2014use a thesaurus (along with a dictionary) to search for the word that says exactly what\nyou want to say.\n\u25cf For more information, please visit these handouts onword choiceandstyle.\nSection adapted fromRevision Concerns.

COMPOSING YOUR COVER LETTER\nYour cover letter is a chance for you to speak to the ENGL 160 Committee directly to explain what skills\nyou have improved this semester, how you approached each of the three assignments in the portfolio,\nand why you feel the work you\u2019ve included demonstrates your readiness for ENGL 160. Your cover letter\nis the first thing the Committee will see when reviewing your portfolio.\nA. Cover Letter Purpose and Guidelines\nThe cover letter to your final portfolio should be a letter (addressed to the ENGL 160 Committee)\nwhich discusses your personal writing experience throughout this class.In particular, you should\nfocus on the writing process (brainstorming, drafting, peer review, revising, evaluation, re-revising)\nfor each of the pieces in your portfolio, what you have learned from it, and how writing and\nrevising that piece has improved your writing skills.\nThe body of your letter should discuss the three pieces you\u2019ve included in the portfolio.

INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH\nEAP 2 was a tough course to me. Online class, time difference, and new environment made the\ncourse even harder. At the beginning, I thought I would be okay to pass this course because I already\nhad learned the most of writing skills in EAP1. In addition, I did pretty well on EAP1. However, EAP2\nwasn't as easy as I thought. As I mentioned first, the new circumstance came to me as a big challenge.\nThe criteria of evaluation also got more selective. I had to write essays more logically and critically.\nHowever, despite the hard work and hard time, I have been able to write cohesive and sophisticated\nessays. Now, I feel I\u2019m able to attend ENG 160 and I deserve it. Here are some improvements that I\nmade throughout the course.\nWHAT THE PARAGRAPH DOES WELL: HOW THE PARAGRAPH COULD BE IMPROVED:\n\u25cf \u25cf\n2. BODY PARAGRAPH: SUMMARY\nFor summary 2, I think I did a better job than before and the article I think I understand more than\nthe first summary, I think I improve a lot after this semester. This semester we are focusing on\nsummarizing and responding, both of these things are helping me get into english 160.\nWHAT THE PARAGRAPH DOES WELL: HOW THE PARAGRAPH COULD BE IMPROVED:\n\u25cf \u25cf\n3. BODY PARAGRAPH: SUMMARY-RESPONSE\nFurther, In this course, my second assignment was a summary\/response essay. In this assignment, we\nhave to read an essay, summarize it as well as write a response to two quotes from the author and\nrespond to it by using different sources or by sharing personal experience for this assignment. Before\nwriting a summary\/response essay, I was unable to develop an organizational pattern and write a thesis\nstatement by reading the essay. I think this assignment has helped me a lot to improve my writing in\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 217 summary\/response and it also improved my writing skills in developing organizational patterns and\nthesis statements as I mentioned above in this paragraph. I would say that not only this assignment\ndeveloped my organizational skills and thesis statement but it also helped me to improve my vocabulary\nskills for further assignment in English courses.\nWHAT THE PARAGRAPH DOES WELL: HOW THE PARAGRAPH COULD BE IMPROVED:\n\u25cf \u25cf\n4. BODY PARAGRAPH: RESEARCH PAPER\nAt last, my third and final assignment was about a research paper. In this assignment, I wrote about\nthe research with relation to globalization and its positive and negative effects to the health and\nlifestyle of people. I had written about the positive effects of globalization such as improved health\ncare, education based on new technologies and improved academia which you see below in detail in my\nresearch paper assignment. This assignment helped not only for the academics but also I came to know\nmore in detail about globalization and its positives after doing research about globalization. For this\nassignment, I took help from sources as well as I share my personal experience about education. I think\nthat research paper was one of the best assignments for me that have written and shared personal\nexperience in this assignment.\nWHAT THE PARAGRAPH DOES WELL: HOW THE PARAGRAPH COULD BE IMPROVED:\n\u25cf \u25cf\n5. CONCLUSION PARAGRAPH\nAll in all, in this course, with the encouragement from my teacher and classmates, I learned a lot in\nthis course, from different summarizing skills to work and discuss with classmates. I feel confident\nenough that I am willing to take ENGL 160 as my next goal to achieve to be a higher level English writer.\nWHAT THE PARAGRAPH DOES WELL: HOW THE PARAGRAPH COULD BE IMPROVED:\n\u25cf \u25cf\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 6: Compiling a Writing Portfolio 218 C.

Midterm Exam (Spring\/Fall)\nThe midterm exam serves as practice for your final exam, in which you will write a four- to\nfive-paragraph summary-response essay within a 90-minute time limit. Because fall and spring EAP II\nclasses meet for less than 90 minutes per session, the midterm exam will not look exactly like the\nfinal, but in both of the alternatives below, you will be able to practice the skills necessary to\nsuccessfully complete the final exam: critical reading, paraphrasing, summarizing, responding to a\ntext, and drafting an essay within a time limit.\nALTERNATIVE 1: ALTERNATIVE 2:\nFEATURE\nONE-DAY EXAM TWO-DAY EXAM\nTime Limit 75minutes 50minutes each day\n\u25cf Read an article of 550-650 DAY 1\nwords \u25cf Read an article of 550-700\nwords\n\u25cf Write a complete \u25cf Write a One-sentence\nfour-paragraph Summary and a Summary\nsummary-response essay Paragraph\n\u25cb Introduction\nTasks\n\u25cb Summary paragraph DAY 2\n\u25cb Response paragraph \u25cf Read an article of 550-700\n\u25cb Conclusion words(different article from\nDay 1)\n\u25cf Write a thesis statement and\none or two response\nparagraphs\nCheck with your instructor for which exam alternative will be used for your midterm exam.\nB. Midterm Exam (Summer)\nFor the summer semester, the midterm is similar to the final exam. You will write a four- to five-\nparagraph summary-response essay within a 90-minute time limit. The exam will take place over one\nclass session. The summer midterm exam is typically scheduled for the last class session of Week 5.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 224 C. Final Exam (Spring\/Summer\/Fall)\nFor the final exam, you will write a four- to five-paragraph summary-response essay within a\n90-minute time limit. For spring and fall semesters, the exam will be given in Week 16 according to\ntheUIC Final Exam schedule.

Breakdown of Two-day Exam: Sample Essay\nBelow is a sample summary-response essay. The parts have been color-coded to show what parts of the\nessay you will focus on during the two days of the midterm exam. Here is thelinkto the article the\nfollowing essay focuses on.\nEXAM DAY 1 EXAM DAY 2\n\u25cf One-sentence Summary \u25cf Thesis statement\n\u25cf Summary paragraph \u25cf One or two response paragraphs\nRobots: One Size Does Not Fit All\nIn her article, \u201cRobot Helps Sick Children Feel Less Lonely,\u201d Anna Matteo writes that a smart robot\ncalled AV1 can help sick children feel better by alleviating feelings of isolation.While Mateo states that\nAV1 can help sick children, I believe it is necessary to admit that this robot can solve some problems\nfor these children, but it can\u2019t help every child because robots can\u2019t replace a child\u2019s relationship with\nfriends, nor can they help children of different ages equally.\nAnna Matteo\u2019s article describes how robots may be able to help sick children feel less lonely when\nthey are unable to attend school for an extended time. Matteo writes that as a result of long-term\nillnesses, sick children often have to recover at home or in the hospital. As a way to help these\nchildren, the robot can go to school for them. Matteo explains that the life-size robot sits in the child\u2019s\ndesk at school, and by using a tablet or a phone to control the robot, the sick child can take part in\nclassroom activities wherever they are. In order to make communication easier and more natural, the\nrobot was designed with speakers, microphones and cameras. According to the article, the reason the\ndesigners chose a life-size robot that resembles the human figure instead of a smaller piece of\nequipment, such as a tablet or computer with a rotating camera, is that they want the students in the\nclassroom to treat the robot as a friend, not as a toy that can be carried away. Matteo concludes that\nchildren can make good use of the robot and feel less lonely with the company that AV1 robot can\nprovide.\nMatteo states, \u201cThe robot takes their place at school. Through the robot, children can hear their\nteachers and friends.\u201d In this passage, Mateo attempts to describe how the robot helps children to\ninteract with their classmates and teachers. However, while these robots are useful in some ways,\nthey can\u2019t replace human company, especially from parents and friends. Only watching or listening to\ntheir friends is not enough to make them not feel lonely. While I\u2019ve never had the benefit of having a\nrobot go to school for me when I was sick, I was once forced to miss three weeks of school because of\nthe chicken pox. In order to not have me fall behind in my studies, two of my friends collected my\nlessons each day and brought them to me. Because my illness was contagious, they were not allowed\nto stay and visit, but we would spend several hours on the phone once they got home so that they\ncould tell me all about what was going on at school. While this helped me not to feel so disconnected\nfrom school and my friends, it was no substitute for actually being in school, and for those three\nweeks I was very lonely and impatient to get better. I imagine that having a robot attend school for me\nwould have been a similar experience, giving me a glimpse into what I was missing, but not completely\nalleviating my loneliness because my face-to-face contact with my friends would still be limited.\nIn the article, Matteo does not specify the particular ages of children who might best be helped\nthrough the AV1 technology but instead vaguely refers only to \u201cchildren who are recovering from\nlong-term illnesses in the hospital or at home.\u201d As a result, readers do not have much information\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 229 specifically about which children this robot would benefit. This information would be vital for readers\nto know because it is important to note that robots cannot effectively help children of different ages.\nIt\u2019s not clear from the article whether she\u2019s taking into consideration the idea that child\u2013robot\ninteraction is more engaging for an 8-year-old child than for one who is 12 or 14. A younger child\nwould likely be more engaged in the novelty of having a robot; older children would likely lose interest\nmuch more quickly and become bored and impatient as they recover from their illness. This may\nnegatively affect their ability to focus on the lessons they are missing and to catch up with their\nclassmates. For this reason, it is important to consider the child\u2019s age when we talk about the robots\u2019\neffectiveness. In other words, children of different ages will react differently to the robot. Thus, a\nrobot can\u2019t help them all in the same way and may be more effective for younger children.\nWhile Matteo believes that robots can help sick children considerably, it is clear that there are some\nlimitations. Robots can provide some help, but the help still can\u2019t replace the intimacy and caring of\nhuman beings and can\u2019t equally help children of different ages. In order to improve the relationship\nbetween children and robots, we should consider tailoring the individual robot to the specific needs and\nage of the child and take different factors into account in our future robots\u2019 design.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 230 iii.

Annotating for Exams\nEffective writers read a text multiple times and annotate (make notes on) the text as they read. This\nhelps them to identify the parts of the text and how they fit together. Below are strategies for\nannotating an article that will help you to identify the author\u2019s argument and points to respond to.\nSTEP 1. Get a general idea of the article.\nThe first time you read an article, think about these general questions:\n\u25cf What is the article about?\n\u25cf What is the author\u2019s view on this topic?\n\u25cf What evidence does the author use to convince me of their argument?\nSTEP 2. Find the important information in the introductoryparagraph.\nReview the article a second time.

When it comes to the social network, it's not an isolated instance of mishandling user data or a\nsingle bad policy... it's that the company hasrepeatedlymishandled user data. It hascontinuously\nmade bad policy decisions, and even doubled down on them when criticized by experts and the\nbroader public. Some of Facebook's most pressing issues have been a problem for over ten years\nnow. Other social networking apps have had similar issues, though not to the extent of Facebook.\nWe all know at least one person who claims that they will quit Facebook\/Twitter\/another social\nnetwork but never do, or if they do, they quietly return a short time later. Why are social networks so\nhard to quit using? There are many reasons why, but one is that they tend to stimulate our brains in\nfundamental ways.\nAccording to researchers at Harvard University, social interactions played an important in the\nevolution of our large and powerful brains. These researchers argue that when you\u2019re part of a\nhuman group, your group protects you, feeds you, cares for you, helps you, and even provides you\nwith mating opportunities. Over time, this meant humans were unable to survive alone in the wild,\nbut did succeed in a group. Basically, we\u2019ve evolved to like and need social interactions. Social\ninteractions and pleasure are connected.\nSocial media provides us with the opportunity to socialize with others 24\/7 effortlessly. Our brains\ngain a lot of enjoyment from such a thing. Being able to interact with others at any time provides us\nwith the protection, care, and attention that we as humans love and require.\nSimilarly, a negative social interaction, a rejection, causes us immense pain. This is because of how\nhumans have evolved: if your survival depends on being accepted by the group, being rejected by\nothers is a matter of life or death, so positive social interactions are crucial.\nWe may want to be liked and accepted by others, but we also want to be admired by them. Social\nstatus is important for many species, and humans are no different. Social phobias are by far the most\ncommon kinds, so any time you engage with someone new it\u2019s potentially very important, requiring\na lot of effort. And maybe because of this, we want to make sure other people like us as much as\npossible.\nSocial media also allows us nearly total control over how others perceive us. We can choose exactly\nhow to look and what to say whenever we wish to say it, rather than allowing people to judge us\nwithout our control. Using social media reduces uncertainty and provides a very comforting sense of\ncontrol in social interactions. What Facebook and other social networks do is provide the social\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 241 interactions, connections and approval we desire, but because we can control these interactions, it is\nless risky and easier to do.\nFacebook and other social media platforms give us the attention that we need for survival. For that\nreason, it\u2019s pretty obvious why so many have trouble getting away from it, despite all its considerable\nflaws.\nMany suggest that we\u2019re \u201caddicted\u201d to Facebook, but that\u2019s a bit extreme. Instead, Facebook is part\nof our survival as humans because of the social aspect of it. But then we figured out how to refine\nour use of social media and now need self-discipline and control to avoid the problems that come\nwith it.\nFacebook is like sugar for the brain: something we hunger after, but can ultimately be unhealthy and\nfor us. And, much like social media, if eating bag after bag of sugar didn\u2019t make you noticeably sick\nand had no detectable health consequences, it would probably be hard to stop.\nArticle adapted from Burnett, Dean. \u201cDelete Facebook?

Outlining an Article\nRead the article below, then complete the summary-response outline that follows.\nThe Rise of the New Group Think\nSusan Cain (she)\nSolitude is out of fashion. Our companies, our schools and our culture are in thrall to an idea I call the\nNew Groupthink, which holds that creativity and achievement come from an oddly gregarious place.\nMost of us now work in teams, in offices without walls, for managers who prize people skills above all.\nLone geniuses are out. Collaboration is in.\nBut there\u2019s a problem with this view. Research strongly suggests that people are more creative when\nthey enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption. And the most spectacularly creative people in\nmany fields are often introverted, according to studies by the psychologists Mihaly Slovek and Gregory\nFeist. They\u2019re extroverted enough to exchange and advance ideas, but see themselves as independent\nand individualistic. They\u2019re not joiners by nature.\nLike Slovek and Feist, many introverts resist being herded together. They prefer having nooks and\ncrannies they can hide away in and just be away from everybody. Privacy often makes us productive.\nIt\u2019s one thing to associate with a group in whicheach member works autonomously on his piece of the\npuzzle; it\u2019s another to be corralled into endless meetings or conference calls conducted in offices that\nafford no rest from the noise and gaze of co-workers. Studies show that open-plan offices make\nworkers hostile, insecure and distracted. They\u2019re also more likely to suffer from high blood pressure,\nstress, the flu and exhaustion. And people whose work is interrupted make 50 percent more mistakes\nand take twice as long to finish it.\nSolitude can even help us learn. According to research on expert performance by the psychologist\nAnders Ericsson, the best way to master a field is to work on the task that\u2019s most demanding for you\npersonally. And often the best way to do this is alone. Only then, Mr. Ericsson told me, can you \u201cgo\ndirectly to the part that\u2019s challenging to you. If you want to improve, you have to be the one who\ngenerates the move. Imagine a group class \u2014 you\u2019re the one generating the move only a small\npercentage of the time.\u201d\nI\u2019m not suggesting that we abolish teamwork. Indeed, recent studies suggest that influential academic\nwork is increasingly conducted by teams rather than by individuals. (Although teams whose members\ncollaborate remotely, from separate universities, appear to be the most influential of all.) The\nproblems we face in science, economics and many other fields are more complex than ever before,\nand we\u2019ll need to stand on one another\u2019s shoulders if we can possibly hope to solve them.\nBut even if the problems are different, human nature remains the same. And most humans have two\ncontradictory impulses: we love and need one another, yet we crave privacy and autonomy. To harness\nthe energy that fuels both these drives, we need to move beyond the New Groupthink and embrace a\nmore nuanced approach to creativity and learning. Our offices should encourage casual, cafe-style\ninteractions, but allow people to disappear into personalized, private spaces when they want to be\nalone. Our schools should teach children to work with others, but also to work on their own for\nsustained periods of time. And we must recognize that introverts need extra quiet and privacy to do\ntheir best work.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 243 Article adapted from Cain, Susan. \u201cThe Rise of the New Groupthink.\u201dThe New York Times, 13 Jan. 2012.Article link.\nPractice 1: Identifying Key Summary Features\nIdentify the author\u2019sthesis\/argument, and make anoutline of themain supporting pointsfrom the\narticle.

While I agree with Carr that\n1\nnew technologies, such as the internet and text messaging, are pushing us toward a more\nsuperficial interaction with information, I think he overstates the internet\u2019s negative impact and\nignores simple fixes that could substantially lessen it.\nCarr argues that while the internet has many advantages, our nonstop use of it for work,\nschool, and leisure is negatively impacting us by rewiring our brains and changing how we\ninteract with information. Carr believes that the Internet is transforming us into easily\ndistractible decoders of information who are losing our ability to interpret text and to make\ndeeper critical connections between ideas. Carr approaches his argument from a personal\nstandpoint, describing his own experiences with struggling to concentrate on complex texts\nbecause he has gotten used to consuming information in small snippets and quickly skipping\nfrom link to link. He cites the work of researcher Marianne Wolf, specifically the elemental\n2\ndifferences between reading an ideogram language and an alphabet language, to show that how\nwe read shapes the circuitry of our brains and how we interpret the world. Carr goes even\nfurther to argue that not only is the internet shaping how we interact with ideas, it is shaping\nhow ideas are presented to us. As an example, he describes the New York Times\u2019s recent decision\nto provide brief summaries of all of their stories so that readers can skim the headlines and main\nideas of stories all in one place rather than having to read entire articles. In the end, he\nemphasizes that by relying on the Internet for information, we sacrifice the traditional culture\nthat enhances our capacity to think.\nIn speaking about his own experience, Carr argues that \u201cwhat the internet seems to be doing\nis chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to\ntake in information the way the internet distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles.\nOnce I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet\n3\nSki.\u201d Here he compares how he currently interacts with information to how he used to before he\nstarted relying so much on the internet, and he laments how his capacity to think deeply has\ndecreased as he has become more accustomed to how information is presented on the internet. I\nagree with Carr\u2019s assessment of his recent lack of ability to interact deeply with ideas and his\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 245 disappointment with this because I\u2019ve noticed the same issue in my own experience. Over the\nyears, and I use the internet more and more, I have found that I have less patience for engaging\nwith complex ideas, and I prefer to consume information on a surface level. Even while\nskimming an internet newspaper, I cannot be bothered to read the whole article but prefer to\nskim the headline and the one-sentence summary that typically appears at the beginning of the\narticle. This summary seems to be a new development; I don\u2019t think newspapers always had\nthem but that, like theNew York Times\u2019s summary page,they have become more popular\nrecently in response to how people prefer to consume the news. Like Carr, I miss the \u201cdeep\nreading\u201d that used to come so naturally to me.\nWhile I can relate to Carr\u2019s observation of how his reading has changed, I believe that he is\noverstating the negative impact of the internet and ignoring the very solution he mentions in the\narticle. In summarizing the work of researcher Marianne Wolf, Carr says \u201cReading is not an\ninstinctive skill for human beings the way speech is. We have to teach our minds how to\ntranslate the symbolic characters we see into the language we understand.\u201d While he\nacknowledges that reading is a skill that requires practice and consistent skill building, he fails\nto make the connection between this idea and the issue he\u2019s describing throughout the article. If\n4\nour overreliance on the internet causes us to lose our ability to concentrate on complex texts, the\nsolution is to periodically disengage from the internet and mindfully practice reading and\nengaging with complex texts. Or alternately, we can use the internet to seek out deeper analyses\nof complex ideas from time to time. If Carr wants to reverse the negative effects of his internet\nconsumption on his thinking, he needs to change his habits and \u201creteach his mind\u201d how to\neffectively engage with complex texts. Or, to use the metaphor he employs in the article, he\nneeds to relearn how to scuba dive rather than only choosing to use his Jet Ski.\nIn \u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d Nicholas Carr blames his increased internet use for\nnegatively impacting how he reads and interacts with information. While I have noticed this\ntrend in my personal experience, I believe it can be reversed with focused engagement with\n5\ndeeper reading and complex ideas. As Carr stated, reading is not automatic and requires work;\nperhaps breaking that work into smaller, focused tasks will make it more manageable and help\nto build back the skills that were lost.\nWork Cited\nCarr, Nicholas. \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?.\"TheAtlantic.July\/August 2008.

Managers said they were wasting too much time in\ninterviewing people who seemed to have no social skills at all, and that if you didn\u2019t have any by the\ntime you started applying for jobs it was probably too late to acquire them.\nWe need to prepare our young people for a world some of us are only now beginning to face.\nBut how to begin? Six out of 10 of the 12- to 17-year-olds polled for the report said they were lonely.\nOne in 20 said they never spent time with friends outside school. Girls were lonelier than boys. A\nthird of the young people polled said they hardly ever felt popular with their peers and 36% said it\nwas \u201cdifficult to make friends\u201d. Nine out of 10 said they were nervous about mixing with people from\ndifferent backgrounds. It seems that many teens struggle to interact meaningfully.\nIf today\u2019s young people are locked in their bedrooms, gazing at their smartphones, this, at least\naccording to the report, isn\u2019t actually making things worse. The young people who spent more time\nonline said they had more fulfilling and stable friendships than the ones who spent less. This, says the\nreport, could be because it helped them to practise their social skills before trying them out in \u201creal\nlife.\u201d\nStill, the takeaways are clear. Adolescents who want to get ahead at work need to spend a bit less\ntime on their smartphones and get an awful lot better at studying human interaction. They need to\nunderstand how to read and respond effectively to body language and nonverbal communication\ncues. They need to know when a colleague needs a kind word or some quiet to get on with a\ndeadline. They need to know that when the boss\u2019s face goes red, you can\u2019t just swipe left and move\non.\nClick to return toTable of Contents Returnto beginning ofChapter 7: Timed Writing Assignments 257 Not least because these are the things that robots still can\u2019t do. About half of jobs are at risk of\nautomation, according to a series of terrifying reports, including one by the Oxford academics Carl\nBenedikt Frey and Michael Osborne on The Future of Employment. It\u2019s still not exactly clear what will\nbe left when the robots come, but wedo knowthatthey are on their way. And that it isn\u2019t just the\nlow-skilled workers who will see their jobs wiped out.\nIn this forcibly brave new digital world, the shift will be away from employees to freelancers and\ncontractors. It will, in other words, be away from security to a world where you have to bid for every\ntiny scrap of work. If you are good at it, you will be taken on for a project, and when that is over you\nwill be dropped. It\u2019s zero hours and it\u2019s a stressful way to live. Ask a journalist who has lost their job.\nAsk me.\nWe need to prepare our young people for a world some of us are only now beginning to face. We\nneed to teach them to be strong and to cope with disappointment. We need to teach them how to\ncope when they work at home on their own, but also the social skills to win the work. Parents need to\ndo this. Schools need to do this. And students need to understand the importance of building their\nsocial skills for their future.\nArticle adapted from Patterson, Christina. \u201cOur Teens Need Social Skills, Not Social Networks.\u201dThe Guardian,22\nMarch 2016.Article link.\nB.
