The book is rich in detail and, as the table of contents\nindicates, broad in scope. It first considers rhetoric in relation to\nphilosophy, then to argumentation, then to politics, and finally to education.\nIn each section of the book we find substantial challenges to received\nopinion as well as provocations to pursue new avenues of research.\nThree of the identifying characteristics of informal logic have been (i) its\nfocus on public discourse rather than technical or scientific discourse, (ii) its\nrejection of formal methods, including formal logic, and (iii) its\ndetermination to offer approaches and methods that will be of value to\nstudents and the public. Christian Kock\u2019s work fits into this broad\nframework but he develops each of the characteristics in a specific way.\nFirst, he concentrates on discourse that has to do with deliberation and\npractical reasoning rather than the whole field of public discourse. Second,\neven though he shares with other argumentation theorists their rejection of\nformal logic, he criticizes informal logic\u2019s lack of attention to the\ndistinction between theoretical and practical reasoning. And third, he takes\na special interest in developing standards and directions for criticism of an\nimportant part of public discourse, deliberative political debate in\ndemocracies.\nKock\u2019s rhetorical theory is rooted in Aristotle\u2019s theory of deliberation\nand its reliance on practical reasoning. Practical reasoning is about what to\ndo, not what to believe, and hence it is not subject to the same alethic\nstandards as logical reasoning. When practical reasoning is done\ncollectively, whether in the family circle or on the national stage, it is\nrhetorical argumentation that must carry the day. Rhetoric is, basically, for\nKock, what one does by speech when deliberating with others about what to\ndo. However, rhetoric as deliberation simply cannot operate without social\nvalues and this recognition presents a new set of problems for rhetorical\nargumentation: value subjectivity, value pluralism and value\nincommensurability, all of which encumber deliberation by putting up\nobstacles to a direct path to solutions. In as much as Kock is an advocate\nfor the theory of deliberative argumentation, he lays out in some detail the\ndifficulties that beset those actually engaged in this kind of rhetorical\nactivity. Contemporary political discourse is of special interest to Kock in the\npresent book. He carries the same passion for deliberation that we imagine\nfilled the Greek agoras forward to our time. This is evident, I think, when\nwe consider his approach to debates. Our usual practice is that debaters will\nuse an audience in their efforts to win a debate, and eventually an election.\nThis they do by currying their audiences\u2019 favour. Yet often political\narguers give no arguments at all for their views, sometimes they give weak\narguments and sometimes they fail to respond relevantly to objections of\nwhich they are well aware. Kock\u2019s view, elaborated on the basis of his own\ncritical studies of contemporary debates in Denmark and the European\nUnion, is that we would be better served if we demanded that political\ndebates be occasions for audiences to become more thoroughly acquainted\nwith the details of the debaters\u2019 positions and their reasons for them. On\nthis model it is the debaters that are being used: they are serving us, the\npublic, making us better informed and ready for civic action.\nI think this book, Professor Kock\u2019s Deliberative Rhetoric, is a very\nimportant publication in the Windsor Studies in Argumentation series. This\nis partly because it is an historically informed study of rhetorical theory and\nalso because it engages and responds to alternative approaches to\nargumentation by some of the leading contemporary argumentation\ntheorists, including Douglas Walton, Stephen Toulmin, and Frans van\nEemeren. Mostly, however, Christian Kock\u2019s book will be appreciated for\nre-invigorating our thinking about the function and value of rhetoric in our\nmodern democracies.\nHVH\nWindsor, Ontario\nNovember 2017. Acknowledgments\nWindsor Studies in Argumentation gratefully acknowledges the\nassistance of Mr Luc Quenneville, typesetter in the University of Windsor\nPrint Shop. We also thank Professor Kock for allowing us to use his\nvariation of Raphael\u2019s School of Athens for the book\u2019s front cover. Most of\nall, we are extremely grateful to Mr Dave Johnston, Co-Director of the\nCentre for Digital Scholarship in the Leddy Library, University of Windsor,\nfor patiently and persistently seeing the publication of this book through all\nthe way to the finish line. Without Dave\u2019s dedication, skill, and energy, this\nbook would not be. Introduction\nThis volume brings together a selection of work done across a period of\nmore than thirty years. I would like to offer this introduction as a help to\nreaders who want to follow the thread of the papers in it and to explain the\nthinking behind them. I hope that these pieces will then together appear as a\n(somewhat) coherent effort centered on a unifying cluster of ideas.\nThe volume is called Deliberative Rhetoric: Arguing about Doing\nbecause I think this title and subtitle highlight the central ideas in that\ncluster. To start with the subtitle, this is not just a book focusing on\nargumentation and on arguing in general. It is a central feature of the book\nthat I see arguing about doing as a distinctive category within the larger\ncategory of argumentation. I think that contemporary argumentation\ntheory\u2014a collective effort that I warmly applaud, by many excellent\nscholars who have done pioneering work\u2014has, despite its advances, paid\ntoo little attention to the category of practical argumentation. Underlying\nthis neglect is a failure to pay sufficient attention to a basic distinction,\nnamely that between epistemic and practical reasoning\u2014or, respectively,\nreasoning about what is true and reasoning about what to do. Several of the\nchapters in the volume address this distinction, arguing for it and seeking to\ntease out its implications. I have felt it necessary for a long time to insist on\nthis distinction in publications and in talks, and readers of this volume may\nfind passages here and there that sound pretty much like echoes of other\npassages. For this I apologize, but the reason is that I have found it hard to\nget a proper hearing for it. There seems to be a strong tendency among\nargumentation scholars\u2014especially those whose background is in certain\nbranches of philosophy\u2014to fail to recognize that this distinction is valid\nand important. I object, for example, to textbooks and theories of\nargumentation that axiomatically state that the purpose of argumentation is\nto determine what is true. No, I say, in practical argument the ultimate\npurpose is to decide on a choice, and, to reiterate a quote from Aristotle that\nI have used many times, \u201cchoice is not either true or false.\u201d\nMy insistence on the difference between arguing about what is true and\narguing about what to do has been taken as an assertion of a dichotomy; it\nhas been pointed out, rightly, that there are many issues where a purported\nexclusive disjunction between arguing about truth and arguing about choice\ncannot be upheld. I completely accept this objection and have tried to\naccommodate it, e.g., in chapter 8. But as critics of unwarranted\n1 dichotomies should know well, one also implies an unwarranted dichotomy\nby asuming that if two things do not constitute a dichotomy, then they must\nbe identical. There are important differences that do not constitute classic\ndichotomies, and the difference between epistemic and practical reasoning\nis an example of this. The two things are importantly different in many\nrespects despite the fact that there are intermediary forms between them and\nalso many hard or undecidable cases.\nMoving from right to left in the title of this volume, we come to the\nword deliberation. I believe that precisely because of the differences\nbetween practical and epistemic reasoning, practical reasoning must always\nin principle be deliberative. This means\u2014and here we may think of the\netymology of the word deliberate and its cognates, which derive from libra,\na scale for weighing\u2014that in the standard case, there will be reasons (or\n\u201carguments\u201d) both for and against anything that one considers doing\u2014that\nis to say, valid reasons. In this I deliberately use the term valid in a different\nsense from its use in formal logic. As will soon be clear, I believe that\nlogically \u201cvalid\u201d reasoning is in principle not available in practical\nreasoning, that is, reasoning for or against a given choice. This is because in\npractical reasoning there will be reasons of a certain weight on both sides. It\nfollows from this that in practical reasoning a weighing or balancing must\ntake place. If one accepts that, then one has to let go of any desire to see\nsuch reasoning as a deductive process. In practical reasoning there are in\nprinciple no reasons that deductively entail a certain decision as their\nconclusion. If there were, there could not be arguments of \u201csome\u201d weight\non both sides. Why that is so I will try to explain, and many of the chapters\nmake similar attempts.\nIn the model case of deductive argumentation, mathematics, there cannot\nbe reasons of some weight on both sides. There is, for example, a\ndeductively valid set of reasons, including a few axioms, that simply entail\na theorem like that of Pythagoras. (In fact there are several proofs, i.e., sets\nof reasons or steps, that all force the conclusion that Pythagoras\u2019 theorem is\ntrue.) This fact entails that there could never be an argument \u201cof some\nweight,\u201d or indeed of any weight, against the theorem. It is true, and any\ndenial of it, or any alleged argument for doubting it, is false.\nWhat about empirical sciences\u2014like, e.g., cosmology, which involves\ntheories like that of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d? Will my deep distinction between\nepistemic and practical reasoning not collapse because in such a domain\n(undeniably an epistemic domain) there will also be arguments of some\nweight both for and against a theory? Yes, there will no doubt, but in a\n2 different sense of the concept \u201cweight.\u201d If some scientists believe that the\nuniverse began with a Big Bang and others believe it didn\u2019t, then they\ncannot both be right: both those claims cannot be true at the same time. If\none of them is right, then the other is wrong. We may believe that the truth\nin the matter may never be conclusively found (which is what any\nPopperian theory of science tells us, since such a theory can never in\nprinciple be verified, only falsified). But even so, both parties in a possible\ndebate between pro-Big-Bangers and anti-Big-Bangers are surely out on a\nquest for the truth. They both assume that there is a truth about the origin of\nthe universe, and that it exists independently of us all, although they\nprobably also agree that it can never be conclusively determined. All we\ncan have in its stead, then, is probability. In that sense each of the parties in\nthe dispute may have arguments of a certain weight: reasons that either add\nto or detract from the probability of their theory.\nIn practical reasoning, however, for example in political debate, things\nare not like that. Some people in a given society will want lower taxes and\nfewer public welfare programs. Others will want more welfare programs\nand will accept higher taxes as a means to it. There is no \u201ctruth\u201d anywhere\nabout what the correct level of taxation and welfare programs might be, and\nso there is no deductively binding (i.e., logically \u201cvalid\u201d) reasoning\navailable to tell us which of the two disagreeing groups is right. There is not\neven such a thing as \u201ccogent\u201d or \u201csufficient\u201d reasoning to this effect\u2014if the\nwords \u201ccogent\u201d or \u201csufficient\u201d are to have any discernible meaning. I say\nthis because I admit to being impatient with the use of these terms in\ndiscussions of what a \u201cgood\u201d argument is. The accepted meanings of these\nwords is that if a piece of reasoning has one of these qualities (which are\noften taken to be the same), then it deductively entails its conclusion. Then\nwhy not say that\u2014if that is what one means? If that is not what one means,\nthen I find the meanings of these words unclear, and I tend to see the use of\nthem as an attempt to, on the one hand, reject deductivism and, on the other\nhand, have it too.\nAs for the political dispute between those who want a strong state with\nwelfare programs and high taxation vs. those who want the opposite, their\nrespective claims are not about what the world is like, but about what they\nwant the world to be like. Both probably have reasons for their positions,\nand both might even, if they were to engage in deliberative debate, accept\nthat there are certain reasons against their positions; but in that case they no\ndoubt assign different weights to these reasons. Debater A will believe that\nthe reason x speaks for his position, while the reason y speaks against it.\n3 Conversely, debater B may believe that the reason y speaks for his position\nand the reason x against it. But they assign different weights to the reasons x\nand y\u2014and that is where they disagree. There will be no deductive proof\navailable to any of them, entailing the truth of his position\u2014or even the\n\u201cprobability\u201d of it. We are simply not talking about truth here, or about its\nmore available substitute, probability; we are talking about choice or, if you\nwill, \u201cpreference,\u201d \u201cdesire,\u201d or \u201cwill.\u201d And not only are the weights\nassigned to x and y different in the two debaters; also, the weights assigned\nby A and B to x and y may change, perhaps as a result of something that A\nand B say to each other\u2014in short, as a result of rhetoric.\nThis shows that the \u201cweight\u201d of each reason should not be taken as\ncompletely analogous to the physical weight of an object (as argumentation\nscholars know, no analogies are complete anyway). The physical weight of\nan object is objectively determined by its mass and the gravitational force\nacting on the object. In contrast, the \u201cweight\u201d of reasons in practical\nreasoning is a metaphorical term; it may change by slow degrees or by\ndiscontinuous leaps, caused either by rhetoric, by personal experience or by\nsome other factor. And as we saw, it may vary from one individual to the\nnext. Moreover, to compound the complexity, this weight is in principle\nalways relative: a reason has a certain weight (which is in fact an uncertain\nweight) in relation to the aggregate weight of other reasons pertaining to the\nissue.\nThe fact that there are reasons on both sides of a disagreement with\nassigned \u201cweights\u201d that are variable in all these ways implies that practical\nreasoning is always in principle deliberation\u2014i.e., an act of weighing on a\npair of metaphorical scales. It is a process, always renewable, that in\nprinciple involves\u2014or should involve\u2014all relevant reasons pertaining to\nthe issue.\nThis is a rather different image than the picture of argumentation\nunderlying much traditional theory and pedagogy\u2014where one typically\nassesses one argument at a time, and where, in the most traditional versions,\neach argument is assessed on a dichotomous scale as either valid (in which\ncase the conclusion is deductively entailed) or invalid (in which case the\nargument is irrelevant and worthless).\nRather than this dichotomous, stop-go approach to the evaluation of\nargument I speak in these papers for something that could be called a\n\u201cscale\u201d model, which necessarily involves taking into account reasons on\nboth pans of the scale. Another meaning of the term \u201cscale\u201d also applies, by\n4 the way: the \u201cweight\u201d of a reason should rather be seen as something that\ncan be marked on a continuous scale or gradient, rather than as something\nthat can have only two dichotomous values. The idea of \u201cconductive\nreasoning\u201d captures this kind of process, and so does the hallowed term\n\u201cdeliberation.\u201d\nThere is further a need to recognize that in this taking-into-account there\nwill typically be reasons on the two sides that cannot be measured by the\nsame unit or yardstick: reasons in practical reasoning are often what I call\n\u201cmultidimensional\u201d in the sense that they belong to different dimensions.\nPhilosophers have used terms like \u201cvalue pluralism\u201d and\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d for this complicating circumstance. Thus\ndeliberation, i.e., the metaphorical weighing of the reasons relevant to an\nissue, is a process with no one authoritative answer, and there is no reason\nto assume that arguers in a dispute will necessarily find consensus, let alone\nthe \u201ctruth.\u201d They may continue to disagree, in an enduring state of what\nJohn Rawls has called \u201creasonable disagreement.\u201d\nThis brings us to the last keyword in the book title: \u201crhetorical.\u201d\nRhetoric, I argue, has from its first practical implementation by the sophists\nand its first theoretical conception by Aristotle been a social practice\ndesigned to deal with precisely the kind of reasoning circumscribed above.\nAristotle, I argue, laid down a particularly strict and clearly demarcated\nconceptual definition of rhetoric, namely as public discussion of issues on\nwhich we may \u201cdeliberate\u201d (bouleuein). Those issues are, as he repeatedly\nmakes clear, only the sort of things we may decide to do or undertake\u2014not\nall sorts of other issues where we can do nothing one way or the other.\nRhetoric, by this definition, is precisely the public discussion of what we, as\na collective, will decide to do.\nThis implies that traditional definitions of rhetoric as dealing with \u201cthe\ncontingent,\u201d \u201cthe probable,\u201d etc., are not strict enough\u2014at least not by\nAristotle\u2019s standards. Rhetoric is the discussion of what we will do because\nwe want things to be in certain ways; the \u201ccontingent\u201d and the \u201cprobable\u201d\nare terms whose core meaning is that they deny absolute certainty or\nnecessity; but they still have to do with how things are, not how we want\nthem to be.\nI do not speak for a definition of rhetoric as strict as Aristotle\u2019s (I mean\nhis \u201cintensional\u201d definition, which is the one I referred to above; his\n\u201cextensional\u201d definition is looser, genre-based and more empirical). But I\nthink his narrow definition is worth highlighting because it identifies what I\n5 consider to be the central domain of rhetorical argumentation: disagreement\nover proposed action. I would add, however, that in the rhetorical tradition\nthis strict understanding has been supplemented, as with concentric circles\naround a core, with other domains of argument\u2014and with other types of\n\u201cspeech acts\u201d (or if you will, Wittgensteinian \u201clanguage-games\u201d) that are\nnot argumentation at all, having no strictly persuasive motive, but which are\nrather to seen as exemplifying the other two Ciceronian \u201coffices\u201d of the\nrhetor besides movere: docere and delectare. Common to all these functions\nare that in each of them a rhetor aims, through discourse, to have some kind\nof impact on his or her audience. Rhetors are out to affect people, not\nmerely to prove propositions (which is something they cannot do anyway in\nrhetorical argument, since, as we have seen, no deductive proof is available\nthere).\nOn the other hand, in order to perform all these functions, rhetoric\ndisposes of a vast store of instruments and insights. They exist in order to\nhelp rhetors do things (or try to do them). As regards rhetorical\nargumentation, rhetorical arguers should openly admit that when they\nengage in it they are \u201cstrategic\u201d in the sense that they want to persuade\u2014\nthat is, they want, if possible, to have their way.\nThese facts have, ever since Plato\u2019s Gorgias, cause a deep distrust of\nrhetoric and rhetors. So they are out to persuade? Persuade by any means\u2014\nany whatsoever, regardless of truth and ethics? The reply to this concern is\nthat some rhetors are indeed like that, that is, without regard for truth and\nethics\u2014but rhetoric and rhetors are not necessarily guilty of culpable\ndisregard for the truth, or for ethics, for that matter. Rather, since rhetoric\u2019s\ncentral domain is deliberation about what we should do, it follows that there\nmay in principle be legitimate but opposite courses of action to choose\nbetween\u2014as for example in the choice between a neo-liberalist and a\ncommunitarian set of political values. (Or, for that matter, for a family that\nconsiders whether to spend their vacation in Spain or France.) No binding\nproof is available in any of these cases\u2014but on the other hand a multitude\nof other means of impacting one\u2019s audience and its inclinations are\navailable.\nDespite the fact that in rhetoric one argues about decision, not about\ntruth, and despite the fact that there are countless ways one can use\ndiscourse to argue for a decision, it is nevertheless an essential tenet in this\nbook that there is such a thing as reasonable and responsible rhetoric, as\nwell as its opposite: rhetoric that is unreasonable, irresponsible and socially\npernicious. The foundational thinkers in the rhetorical tradition\u2014figures\n6 like Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Erasmus, Vico, Campbell, Kenneth\nBurke, Perelman\u2014all take it for granted that on the one hand rhetoric can\nfulfill a constructive and necessary function in a polity; but on the other\nhand it can also do the opposite (and everything in between). This makes it\nmeaningful to try to formulate what the criteria for socially constructive\nrhetoric are. What are rhetorical virtues, what are vices?\nAll of the thinkers just mentioned have\u2014realistically\u2014seen rhetoric as\nfunctioning on two levels: the personal and the social. A rhetor may speak\nstrategically for his own cause, and in that there is nothing wrong per se; in\nfact it seems a plausible speculation that language arose among humans in\norder to perform various \u201cstrategic\u201d functions. On the other hand one may\nalso ask about the social functions and significance of a society\u2019s rhetorical\npractices.\nMuch of the work in this book circles around that issue. There is much\nto be said and much to be discussed when we ask what the criteria for\nsocially desirable rhetoric are, precisely because rhetoric cannot be required\nto prove truths or be deductively valid. So what can we require? And if we\nhave some idea of what sorts of rhetoric we wish to see and hear in a\nsociety, how can we encourage and nurture them, and how can we expose\nand discourage the less desirable kinds? What forms and venues of critical\nobservation and commentary might have some kind of impact? What could\nbe done in the educational system for a better argumentative dialogue on\nmatters of shared concern, in the public sphere and among citizens? These\nare some of the issues that argumentation scholars, regardless of \u201cschool,\u201d\nshould get together to address.\nSome remarks to introduce the individual chapters in the book and\nestablish a certain coherence between them might be in place. The chapters\nhave been arranged in four parts.\nPart 1, \u201cRhetoric and Philosophy,\u201d has three chapters that all address the\nrelationship between these two humanistic disciplines, the oldest of all. I\nwish to suggest that they can learn from each other, rather than continue the\nmutual warfare that Plato began, and both make their distinctive\ncontributions to a humanistic understanding of man in society.\nChapter 1, \u201cGorgias Reloaded. A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias\nand Socrates,\u201d is not quite what the title asserts. It was originally a talk at\nthe presentation of a new complete translation of Plato\u2019s writings into\nDanish. I happen to think that the criticism of rhetoric that Plato launched\n7 through Socrates in Gorgias has enjoyed far too much unreflecting\nrepetition by philosophers and other thinkers in later centuries. Reflection,\nhowever, is what it should bring about, so I playfully let Gorgias talk back\ninstead of performing the part of the willing lamb-to-the-slaughter that\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutors have assigned to them in some of the dialogues. I let\nGorgias enjoy the benefit of having learned from conversation with\nAristotle in the Elysian fields, and I also let him expose what I consider an\nunfair, fallacious analogy argument in Socrates\u2019 comparison of the\nsophist/rhetorician and the harp-player in the Protagoras.\nChapter 2, \u201cChoice Is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical\nArgumentation,\u201d is a programmatic text in which I argue that leading\ncontemporary argumentation theorists such as Johnson, van Eemeren and\nHoutlosser, and Tindale \u2014all of whom I admire for many of their ideas, but\nnot necessarily for all of them\u2014have, in their attempts to address rhetoric,\ntended to define rhetorical argumentation with reference either to (a) the\nrhetorical arguer\u2019s goal (to persuade effectively), or (b) the means he\nemploys to do so. However, a central strand in the rhetorical tradition itself,\nled by Aristotle, and arguably the dominant view in that tradition, sees\nrhetorical argumentation as defined with reference to the domain of issues\ndiscussed. On that view, the domain of rhetorical argumentation is centered\non choice of action in the civic sphere, and the distinctive nature of issues in\nthis domain is considered crucial. I argue that argumentation theories such\nas those discussed in the first part of the chapter promulgate an\nunderstanding of rhetoric that is historically inadequate. I further suggest\nthat theories adopting this understanding of rhetoric risk ignoring important\ndistinctive features of argumentation about action.\nChapter 3, \u201cAristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and\nRhetoric\u2014Then and Now,\u201d is an attempt to highlight connections between\nAristotle\u2019s thinking on rhetoric and on ethics and politics. Aristotle differs\nfrom most later philosophers in distinguishing clearly between epistemic\nreasoning, which aims for truth, and practical reasoning, which aims for\nchoice. How can he posit this distinction and yet not dismiss practical\nreasoning as truth-neglecting flattery and manipulation, as Plato did? The\nquestion I try to answer here is one that many later rhetors and rhetoricians\nhave also had to face. The answer lies in the concepts of deliberation\n(boul\u0113, bouleusis) and deliberate choice (proairesis). They link Aristotle's\nrhetoric, ethics, and politics together and help provide interconnected\ndefinitions of all three. Ethics is about deliberate choices made by\nindividuals. Politics and rhetoric are about the collective choices made by\nthe polity: politics is about making such choices that the good life of all\n8 citizens is optimally secured; rhetoric is the principal means to do this.\nThese links have not been much discussed by scholars, probably because\nfew studies range across all three of these Aristotelian arts; a proper\ndiscussion of them should draw on modern work in ethics, political science,\nand rhetoric. The key concepts in Aristotle that the paper discusses offer\ninspiration for modern theories of \u201cdeliberative democracy,\u201d citizenship,\nargumentation, debate, and the public sphere.\nPart 2, \u201cRhetoric and Argumentation,\u201d collects five chapters where I\nhave done what I could to make clear how a rhetorical view can contribute\nto argumentation theory proper. I have great respect for what the leading\nfigures in contemporary argumentation theory have done for this discipline\nthat is fairly new in academe but no less necessary for that, but I also think\nrhetoric can bring useful new insights to the shared table. And the common\ndenominator for those might be \u201cpluralism.\u201d In all of these chapters there is\na plea that significant distinctions should be made that much of the current\ntheory is apt to neglect or downplay.\nChapter 4, \u201cMultiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning,\u201d is one of two\npapers that discuss the lasting contribution of Stephen Toulmin to\nargumentation theory in light of the central ideas I wish to propose. The\nconcept of \u201cwarrant,\u201d I argue, reflects Toulmin's general insights that\nargumentative validity in reasoning (which is not the same as logical\n\u201cvalidity\u201d) comes in many forms, and that reasoning in most fields cannot\npossess the necessity and certainty that have attracted many thinkers to the\n\u201cRationalist\u201d paradigm. However, there is a scarcity of concepts in one part\nof Toulmin's theory of argument. While pedagogical applications of his\nmodel offer a fine-grained system of warrant types for epistemic\npropositions (\u201csign\u201d warrants, \u201ccausal\u201d warrants, etc.), they lack categories\nof warrants for practical claims (i.e., proposals for action). One version of\nToulmin-based pedagogy has only one such category\u2014the \u201cmotivational\u201d\nwarrant. Ancient rhetorical thinking can help us correct this insufficiency.\nThe author of the rhetorical textbook allegedly used by Alexander the Great\nproposed a broader typology of practical warrants. His approach highlights\nwhat I call the \u201cmultidimensionality,\u201d and hence what modern moral\nphilosophers call the \u201cincommensurability,\u201d of warrants\u2014the absence of a\ncommon measure allowing for a \u201crational\u201d balancing of conflicting\nwarrants. The widespread occurrence of multidimensionality in practical\nargument lends support to Toulmin's general anti-rationalist view of\nreasoning. Moreover, while multidimensionality prevents a \u201crational\u201d and\n9 binding balancing, I argue that it legitimizes and in fact necessitates the use\nof rhetoric in practical reasoning.\nChapter 5, \u201cIs Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\u201d addresses attempts by\nthe most prolific contemporary argumentation theorist, Douglas Walton, to\nfit practical reasoning into a theoretical mold that in my view does not\nsufficiently recognize its distinctive features. Walton\u2019s model of practical\nreasoning as \u201cpresumptive\u201d is, I argue, misleading. The notions of\n\u201cinference\u201d and of the \u201cburden of proof\u201d shifting back and forth between\nproponent and respondent lead to counterintuitive consequences. Because\nthe issue in practical reasoning is a proposal, rather than a proposition,\nthere are, in the standard case, several perfectly good reasons on both sides\nsimultaneously, which implies that argument appraisal necessarily contains\na subjective element\u2014a fact that argumentation theory needs to\nconceptualize.\nChapter 6, \u201cMultidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative\nArgumentation,\u201d argues that the focus in contemporary argumentation\ntheory is too rarely on practical or deliberative argumentation as such.\nMany modern theorists mistakenly tend to see all argumentation as one\nhomogeneous domain. Even so, there has recently been a tendency to\ndifferentiate more, for example in the work of Walton, who has defined\ndifferent types of argumentative dialogue. However, to understand\ndeliberative argumentation better, we also need to differentiate in another\nway, namely on the basis of argumentative issues (one might also say\n\u201cdomains,\u201d cf. above). When the issue is practical (i.e., action or choice),\nthere will typically be multidimensionality among the reasons or warrants\ninvoked, and this helps explain why deductive \u201cvalidity\u201d is not an option\nnor a meaningful evaluative criterion.\nChapter 7, \u201cConstructive Controversy: Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented\nDiscourse,\u201d similarly suggests that current theories of argumentation\nunderestimate the difference, emphasized by Aristotle, between theoretical\nand practical (action-oriented) argumentation. This is exemplified with the\nargument theories of Toulmin, Pragma-Dialectics, Habermas, Walton, and\neven Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (whose fundamental views and\ninsights I am otherwise strongly indebted to). Since antiquity, rhetoric has\ndefined itself, not as argument designed to \u201cwin,\u201d but as action-oriented\nargument. What is perhaps most noticeable in this chapter is that it specifies\nsome of the distinctive features of action-oriented argument. One is that its\nwarrants include value concepts in audiences, implying an element of\nsubjectivity in argument assessment. Between disagreeing individuals, but\n10 also inside each individual, several conflicting value dimensions are\ntypically involved, not just the dimension of truth-falsity\u2014and this makes\nsustained, reasonable dissensus inevitable.\nChapter 8, \u201cWhy Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Types of\nClaim,\u201d further explores the distinction between epistemic reasoning (about\nthe truth of propositions) and practical reasoning (about the adoption of\nproposals), emphasizing the depth of the differences. I use Aristotle's views\nof practical reasoning, as interpreted by the philosopher Anthony Kenny, to\nshow that practical reasoning has a complex, \u201c'backward\u201d structure that\ndoes not allow for the predication of \u201ctruth\u201d for the claims advanced, nor\nfor a strict notion of \u201cinference.\u201d Other features of practical reasoning such\nas multidimensionality and the role of subjectivity are discussed, and a\nspectrum of types of claim, ranging from the purely epistemic to the purely\npractical, is suggested.\nPart 3, \u201cRhetoric and Democracy,\u201d widens the scope by bringing\ntogether seven chapters that all look at how argumentation and persuasion\nworks, or should work, in the practical world of politics, ethics, and daily\naffairs.\nChapter 9, \u201cNorms of Legitimate Dissensus,\u201d can be said to summarize\nmuch of what is said in this volume about the nature of deliberative debate\nand the consequent criteria for the assessment of it. I call for argumentation\ntheory to learn from moral and political philosophy. Several thinkers in\nthese fields help understand the occurrence of what we may call legitimate\ndissensus: enduring disagreement even between reasonable people arguing\nreasonably. It inevitably occurs over practical issues, e.g., issues of action\nrather than truth, because there will normally be legitimate arguments on\nboth sides, and these tend to be incommensurable, i.e., they cannot be\nobjectively weighed against each other. Accordingly, \u201cinference,\u201d logical\n\u201cvalidity,\u201d and \u201csufficiency\u201d are inapplicable notions. Further distinctive\nfeatures of pro and con arguments in practical argumentation are explored,\nand some corollaries are drawn regarding evaluative norms of legitimate\ndissensus. Examples from immigration-related public debates in Denmark\nare given.\nChapter 10, \u201cDialectical Obligations in Political Debate,\u201d zooms in on\nthe crucial importance in public debate of not only arguing for one\u2019s own\nposition, but also answering counter-arguments. Given the distinctive\nfeatures of political debate, and of all practical reasoning, that have been\nasserted in this volume, it follows that political debaters have particularly\n11 stringent dialectical obligations: it becomes crucial, in the interest of the\naudience (i.e., all us citizens), that political debaters acknowledge good\narguments on the opposite side and explain why, on balance, they deem the\narguments favoring their own side to be weightier.\nChapter 11, \u201cVirtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in\nPolitical Debate,\u201d summarizes, in a systematic overview, the principal\n\u201cstultifying vices\u201d that I have analyzed in a book whose title means \u201cThey\nAre Not Answering\u201d\u2014vices that I believe beset most public political debate\nin Western democracies. The conceptual hierarchy of these \u201cvices\u201d reflects\na view of argumentative norms inspired by the \u201cARG\u201d triad\n(\u201cAcceptability\u2014Relevance\u2014Good Grounds\u201d) as well as by the concept of\n\u201cdialectical obligations,\u201d both advanced by thinkers connected with the\nschool of Informal Logic. The resultant typology presents, in negative, a bid\nfor something that civic instruction might profitably teach students at all\nlevels about deliberative democracy.\nChapter 12, \u201cRhetoric that Shifts Votes: A Large-Scale Exploratory\nStudy of Persuasion in Issue-Oriented Public Debates,\u201d was written with\ntwo colleagues in the Rhetoric program at the University of Copenhagen,\nCharlotte J\u00f8rgensen and Lone R\u00f8rbech. It differs from all the preceding\nchapters in being a strictly empirical study\u2014with a normative twist. It\nsummarizes a study of 37 televised debates on political issues in Denmark,\nconducted live before representative audiences, with polls on the issues\ntaken in the audience before and after each debate. These debates are of\ninterest as research data because they were authentic, not experimental, and\nthey suggest valuable insights about persuasive effects. Various rhetorical\nfeatures were observed and related to debaters' success in attracting votes.\nIn a qualitative interpretation of the observations, we suggest that debates\nsuch as these are likely to be won by debaters whose argumentation is fair\nand thoughtful. The debate format may enhance such a result, for the\nbenefit of the democratic process. It was our study of these policy debates, I\nbelieve, that first alerted me to differences between epistemic and logical\nreasoning on the one hand and practical reasoning, including political\ndebate, on the other.\nChapter 13, \u201cThe Rhetorical Audience in Public Debate and the\nStrategies of Vote-gathering and Vote-shifting,\u201d written with Charlotte\nJ\u00f8rgensen, grew out of our work with the \u201cRhetoric that Shifts Votes\u201d\nproject, which generated the hypothesis that two different rhetorical\nstrategies in issue-oriented debates will be apt to win votes from two\ndifferent groups: what we call vote-gathering will be more likely to appeal\nto the Undecided voters, while the strategy we call vote-shifting is more\n12 likely to win votes from the opposite side. While vote-gathering tends to be\n\u201cfront-widening,\u201d vote-shifting tends to be \u201cfront-narrowing.\u201d We speak for\ndebate formats that allow vote-shifting rhetoric to unfold and suggest that it\nwould be strategically wise for debaters, as well as more useful for\naudiences, if debaters would focus on winning over shiftable voters from\nthe opposite side.\nChapter 14, \u201cEvaluation of Public Spokespersons,\u201d was written with the\nlate Flemming Hansen, Professor of Marketing at the Copenhagen Business\nSchool. Like the preceding chapter, it is strictly empirical, aiming to find\nwhat properties ordinary people connect with the notion of \u201ccredibility\u201d\u2014a\nlongtime pet subject of empirical communication research. The study uses\nfactor analysis, as do many previous studies of the credibility construct, but\nwith important modifications. Our findings suggest, essentially, that people\ntend to correlate credibility with some of the same qualities that were found\nto characterize \u201cvote-shifters\u201d in the \u201cRhetoric that Shifts Votes\u201d study. To\nbe credible, one need not be telegenic, spectacular or provocative (these\nattributes correlate more with a factor we call \u201ccharisma\u201d), but should rather\ndemonstrate the qualities one would hope to find in a judge: intelligence,\ncompetence, civility, respect for both sides of an issue.\nChapter 15, \u201cArgumentation Democracy 101,\u201d is a sort of beginner\u2019s\nguide to the normative assessment of public debate, with proposals for its\nimprovement. It builds on the opening chapter of my book in Danish, De\nsvarer ikke: Fordummende uskikke i den politiske debat (\u201cThey Are Not\nAnswering: Stultifying Vices in Political Debate,\u201d 2011, 2nd ed. 2013). I\nam pleased to report that for several weeks this book, aimed at a general\naudience, topped the Danish list of best-selling non-fiction. The chapter\nbased on it sketches in broad strokes and accessible language a view of\nwhat deliberative debate in democracy could be, and ideally should be.\nPart 4, \u201cRhetoric and Practice,\u201d widens the scope further. The chapters\nin this part overlap with other neighbor disciplines of rhetoric such as\nlinguistics, pedagogy, and media studies.\nChapter 16, \u201cNon-Truth-Conditional Quantification,\u201d is the earliest of\nthe papers in the book. When I wrote it I didn\u2019t think of myself as either a\nrhetorician or an argumentation scholar, but more as a pragmatic linguist.\nThe paper parallels, and is inspired by, Oswald Ducrot\u2019s thinking on\nlanguage as more argumentative than referential, and I argue that an\nomnipresent element in everyday communication, namely the meanings of\nwhat I call \u201cvague\u201d adjectives and adverbials (elements that I later learned\nmany linguists call \u201cscalar\u201d) can only be understood if we see those\nmeanings as argumentative. (Looking back, I would like to have said\n13 \u201crhetorical.\u201d As it happens, Ducrot himself went on to draw on terms and\nnotions from the rhetorical tradition.) I polemically address a widespread\nview of how to account to for the meaning of linguistic items: the view that\nsees meaning as (almost) exhaustively describable in terms of \u201ctruth\nconditions.\u201d This stab at the \u201cmeaning-as-truth-conditions\u201d theory\nanticipates my later claim that not all argument is about some proposition\nbeing true; lurking behind my stance here is a \u201crhetorical\u201d theory of\nlanguage to the effect that language is more fundamentally about inducing\ncooperation from others than about uttering true propositions.\nChapter 17, \u201cInception: How the Unsaid May Become Public\nKnowledge,\u201d opens a section featuring specific analyses of how language\nmay function rhetorically\u2014for better or worse. It uses H.P. Grice\u2019s concept\nof conversational implicature, and develops concepts based on Gricean\nthinking, in a rhetorical analysis of several passages in President George W.\nBush\u2019s speeches prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. I propose that the\npassages in question, along with many others, were apt to suggest to\naudiences something that Bush never asserted (and ostensibly denied),\nnamely that he believed Saddam Hussein to have been complicit in the 9/11\nterrorist acts. Three types of suggestive mechanism are analyzed. They are\noffered as examples of rhetorical devices used in political communication\nthat may create a kind of \u201cpublic knowledge\u201d that has neither been asserted,\nsupported with reasons, or reflected upon. The intended relevance of this\nanalysis for argumentation studies is that it cautions citizens in democracies\nabout the views that political leaders will have us adopt underhandedly,\nwithout argument.\nIn Chapter 18, \u201cA Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic\nWriting the Macro-Toulmin Way,\u201d my co-author Signe Hegelund and I\ncontend that many of our students\u2019 problems in the writing of academic\npapers (including problems concerning typical rhetorical aspects like genre\nand task definition) may be addressed if we adapt Toulmin's argument\nmodel to explain the genre requirements regarding argumentation in\nacademic papers, as opposed to everyday argumentation (including\npractical reasoning). Students, we say, should be encouraged to apply the\nmodel as an assessment criterion and, at the same time, as a heuristic tool\nwhile writing their papers. This involves a \u201cmacroscopic\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d\napproach to the evolving draft, not a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d analysis of individual\npassages. The paper suggests a number of class activities that will help\nstudents apply such a \u201cMacro-Toulmin\u201d view to their own work. I might\nadd that I think this is what the \u201cToulmin model\u201d is probably best at\u2014\n14 because it was not in the first place conceived to model practical argument\n(i.e., argumentation about doing). I believe it is better seen as part of\nToulmin\u2019s Wittgenstein-inspired campaign for a pluralism where different\nscholarly and scientific \u201cfields\u201d have, as it were, different \u201clanguage-\ngames\u201d with different rules for what counts as data and, in particular, as\nwarrants. This again reflects the fact that Toulmin, at the time when he\nwrote The Uses of Argument, was mainly interested in the theory of science.\nIt is, indeed, striking that the book contains no examples of examples of\narguments about doing, only examples of epistemic arguments (who can\nforget \u201cHarry is a British subject\u201d?). For these reasons I also believe that\nToulmin\u2019s theory and model are in fact insufficient and potentially\nmisleading as a theoretical basis for a study or pedagogy of practical\nargument.\nIn Chapter 19, \u201cGeneralizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use,\u201d I\npropose a modernized version of ancient thinking about stasis (or status)\u2014a\ntopical system for argument invention used by defendants in court trials.\nEssentially, I suggest that, for purposes of pedagogy, criticism, and also\nargumentative practice, we may extend the use of stasis thinking to all\npractical disagreements, not just forensic cases, since all such\ndisagreements invoke norms, formal or informal, that are functionally\nsimilar to the legal statutes in forensic reasoning. Furthermore, I suggest\nthat we collapse the two main components of stasis theory\u2014the status\nrationales and the status legales. The resulting systematic overview of\nargumentative strategies could, I argue, help focus political and social\ndisagreements on the points where the essential disagreements remain. This\nmight at the same time give more powerful persuasive tools to debaters and\n\u201cmore light, less heat\u201d to their audiences.\nChapter 20, \u201cRhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive\nCriticism,\u201d seeks to apply an idea of rhetoric as a socially constructive force\nto media criticism. With reference to studies in news reporting and political\njournalism and commentary, I suggest that various current program types\nand framing practices do not serve democracy and deliberation as well as\nthey might.\nOn these pages I have underlined some of the central issues that weave\nthrough this book. Hopefully they will become more visible with the above\nremarks in mind. I have briefly summarized the individual chapters in a\nway that is meant to clarify how they relate to the recurrent themes. While I\n15 ask for the reader\u2019s attentiveness in recognizing these themes, I also\napologize for having made the going bumpier than necessary. Most of the\nflaws of exposition that I am aware of have to do with the fact that these\npapers were produced over a long stretch of time, in an attempt to\nprogressively clarify my own thoughts. This has made me repeat certain key\nideas and examples more times than would have been fitting for a\nmonograph. And the papers in this volume are reproduced in exactly the\nformulation they originally had. There would have been no point in trying\nto revise and update them\u2014that task would inevitably lead to complete\nrethinking in monograph form (which is in fact a project I am engaged in).\nIn addition to some unnecessary repetition, there is also on the other hand a\ncertain lack of repetition and consistency in my use of key terms. I have\ntried out various wordings and key terms for key ideas and have at times,\nfor example, spoken of reasoning, argumentation, or deliberation as more or\nless overlapping or synonymous notions. A list of other blemishes of\nexpository rhetoric might be put together. I ask the reader\u2019s indulgence with\nthis in the hope that the central ideas I speak for will crystallize and earn the\nreader\u2019s thoughtful consideration.\n16 Part 1: Rhetoric and Philosophy\n17 1.\nGorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between\nGorgias and Socrates\nIn the Elysian Fields, Socrates to his surprise meets his old rhetorical\nadversary Gorgias\u2014who has, in the meantime, come to think twice about\nsome of the alleged errors that Socrates made him admit to in the Platonic\ndialogue about their original encounter. Among other things, Gorgias has\nhad the advantage of gathering a few points from a certain young thinker\nhailing \u201cfrom up North\u201d (he presumably means Stagira). Thus equipped, he\ntakes Socrates to task about several of his anti-rhetorical pronouncements\nfrom back then that Gorgias now feels he is in a position to challenge.\nSOCRATES Well, if that isn\u2019t\u2014you can call me a sophist if that isn\u2019t\u2014\nGorgias! Old boy! Fancy meeting you here\u2014in the Elysian Fields! The\nIsland of the Blessed! The very man who brought that awful nuisance,\nrhetoric, to Athens! I\u2019d never have thought I\u2019d live to see that. In fact, I\ndidn\u2019t.\nGORGIAS No, you didn\u2019t see that one coming, did you, Socrates? And\nyou know, it was only recently that they let us in, me and my gang\u2014you\nknow, the other sophists, Protagoras and Prodicus and Antisthenes and\nthose guys.\nAnd why do think that is? You did that to us. You did such a great job\ndragging our names through the mud, smearing me and the other sophists or\nrhetoricians, as you call us, and thanks to you most philosophers until this\nday have detested us.\nTake a philosopher like John Locke, one of the bright lights who started\nthe so-called Enlightenment\u2014he said this in An Essay on Human\nUnderstanding (1690): \u201cIt is evident how much men love to deceive and be\ndeceived, since rhetoric, that powerful instrument of error and deceit, has its\nestablished professors, is publicly taught, and has always been had in great\nreputation.\u201d He also said that rhetoric does nothing but \u201cinsinuate wrong\nideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment\u201d Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\n(Book III, 34; 1841, 360). The great Immanuel Kant, a hundred years\nlater, said that rhetoric \u201cdeserves no respect at all\u201d \u2014it is \u201cgar keiner\nAchtung w\u00fcrdig\u201d (Buch II, \u00a7 53; 1839, 192). And you, Socrates, taught\nthem to say these things.\nSOCRATES Okay, much of the stuff they said about you wasn\u2019t quite fair\nof you guys, I suppose.\nGORGIAS But they got it from you, Socrates. You said, in the Gorgias,\n463a, that rhetoric is \u201ca practice that\u2019s not craftlike, but one that a mind\ngiven to making hunches takes to, a mind that\u2019s bold and naturally clever at\ndealing with people. I call it flattery, basically.\u201d\nSOCRATES But then again, Gorgias, what you\u2019re quoting there does have\nsome truth in it. You are the one who believes that words can act like a\ndrug, and you wrote a speech in defence of Helen of Troy\u2014who left her\nhusband, damn it, to marry an enemy of Greece, because she couldn\u2019t help\nit: his sweet words had acted on her and seduced her with their flattery and\ntheir rhythm and their musical repetitions\u2014acted like hypnotism. And you\nare fascinated by that! Admit it! Honestly, do you really think that speech is\nnothing but seduction?\nGORGIAS Okay, Socrates, you are right, speech is not just seduction, but\nit is seduction among other things. I did say it\u2019s like a drug, and we all\nknow that some drugs do good things and others do bad things, and\nsometimes they do a good thing and the next day they do a bad thing. You\nknow what drugs are like: some put an end to disease and others to life, and\nthat goes for discourses as well: \u201csome give pain, others delight, others\nterrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile\npersuasion drug and trick the soul.\u201d I wrote that, in that speech you\nmention. Pretty persuasive, isn\u2019t it?\nSOCRATES But it\u2019s terrible to use speech to do all those things, Gorgias.\nGORGIAS Yes, I agree, sometimes it is terrible, but at least it\u2019s good to\nknow that speech can do all these things\u2014and to know how it\u2019s done. And I\npointed that out, Socrates. A lot of it has to do with repetition and rhythm\nand variation and ambiguity and puns and parallelisms and with raising\nexpectations and fulfilling them and circumventing them and surprising\nthem, and things like that. With all this, words can work like music. You\nknow, I can imagine how one day a huge crowd of people will be put into a\nstate of rapture or frenzy by one person who speaks or sings. Imagine a\nthousand young girls screaming with joy\u2014or a thousand young boys, for\nthat matter, Socrates?\n19 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nSOCRATES Now let\u2019s not get carried away, Gorgias. Better let\u2019s discuss\nwhat rhetoric really is. I asked you that when we last conversed, but I don\u2019t\nthink you were able to answer.\nGORGIAS Well, all this is part of what rhetoric is, Socrates. Words and\nsounds can do things to us, and carry us away, and it\u2019s better to know about\nit beforehand, so that we don\u2019t get carried away unless we really want to.\nIt\u2019s a part of life, but you never seemed to really understand that. And the\nguy who wrote down everything you said, what\u2019s his name, he never\nunderstood it either. And that\u2019s strange because he wrote pretty beautifully\nhimself\u2014in fact, when I think about it, he wrote even better than I do, but\ndid he want to be called a rhetorician? God forbid!\nSOCRATES But you and your gang, Gorgias, you rhetoricians and\nsophists, you not only told people about these things, you also taught them\nto do these things.\nGORGIAS You know, Socrates, nowadays there a quite a few wise people\nwho think differently. We were not spin-doctors and manipulators, we were\nforerunners of democracy and the Open Society. Open discussion of\neverything! Nothing should be taken for granted! \u201cThe Open Society!\u201d\u2014do\nyou know that the guy who wrote about that, he said that we were on the\nsame side, you and I, fighting for human reason, on guard against\ndogmatism! Now what do say, Socrates?\nSOCRATES I will ask the questions here, Gorgias. That\u2019s what makes it\nreal, responsible dialectics. So now I ask again. What is rhetoric? And what\nis it about?\nGORGIAS Well you know, Socrates, it\u2019s been nearly 2,500 years since I\nlast tried to explain to all you Athenians what rhetoric is, and I\u2019ve actually\nlearned a great deal since then. Soon after I came to the Elysian Fields here\nI ran into another clever fellow, although he was not a real Athenian\u2014he\ncame from up North, he wrote books about rhetoric and all sorts of other\nthings, and he put things in perspective for me. Did you not meet him when\nwe were still down there, on earth?\nSOCRATES There was a lot I didn\u2019t get around to, Gorgias. I was cut\nshort.\nGORGIAS Yeah, isn\u2019t that\u2019s too bad, Socrates, but come to think of it,\nyou pretty much dug your own grave with that \u201capology\u201d you came up\nwith. You should have let me write that for you. But the way you handled\nthat situation, you might as well have taken poison\u2014I mean, taken it from\nthe start.\n20 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nSOCRATES You\u2019re trying to dodge my question again, Gorgias. So let me\nrepeat the question I asked you 2,400 years ago: \u201cWhat kind of persuasion,\nand of persuasion dealing with what, is rhetoric the art?\u201d (Gorgias, 454a).\nGORGIAS Well, that is something I have given a lot of thought since our\nlast talk all those years ago, and I\u2019ve found out that in that talk you really\ntricked me. You sometimes do that to people, you\u2019re no better than the rest\nof us. Take for example what you said about my colleague Protagoras. You\ncompared a player of the harp or lyre [kitharist\u0113s] to a sophist, such as me\nor Protagoras, and you said that the harp-player can teach us to talk about\nharp-playing; but what can the sophist teach us to talk about? Nothing in\nparticular, you said\u2014since his speeches can be about anything, or, in other\nwords, nothing (Protagoras, 312d-e).\nSOCRATES That\u2019s right, Gorgias.\nGORGIAS But that\u2019s where you tricked us. You should have asked what\nskill each of them can teach. The harp-player can teach us the skill of harp-\nplaying, and the sophist can teach the skill of public speaking. Instead you\nasked what the sophist\u2019s speeches are about. But then you should also have\nasked what the harp-player\u2019s music is about. If you want to compare two\nthings, you should ask the same questions about them both. But you tricked\nus. You stacked the cards.\nSOCRATES Very clever, Gorgias, it only took you 2,400 years to figure\nthat out.\nGORGIAS Well Socrates, this is just one example of how you pretend to\nbe so honest and truth-seeking, but just like me you\u2019re simply out to\npersuade people. There are honest ways of doing that as well as less honest\nways, and you know both kinds. Welcome in the club. I remember what you\nsaid about us sophists, it also applies to you: \u201cthere is no need to know the\ntruth of the actual matters, but one merely needs to have discovered some\ndevice of persuasion which will make one appear to those who do not know\nto know better than those who know\u201d (Gorgias, 459b-c).\nSOCRATES Yes, and what did you answer, Gorgias? You walked right\ninto my trap and said \u201cis it not a great convenience, Socrates, to make\noneself a match for the professionals by learning just this single art and\nomitting all the others?\u201d\nGORGIAS Honestly, Socrates, that\u2019s what I said according to that young\nman who wrote all those dialogues about you, just as Dr. Watson did about\nSherlock Holmes! Would I actually have made such a stupid answer? What\n21 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nyour young friend did there was to set up a \u201cstraw man\u201d version of my\nopinion. Just like all the politicians are constantly doing to each other.\nSOCRATES And it was you and your friends who taught the politicians\nand their spin-doctors all those underhanded tricks, Gorgias.\nGORGIAS So did you, Socrates. But I think you philosophers and us\nrhetoricians, we should join forces to expose all the underhanded tricks we\nhear in political debate so that we can all deliberate about our common\naffairs in a reasonable manner.\nSOCRATES So you are still dreaming about that silly idea, \u201cdemocracy,\u201d\nGorgias? I think it\u2019s not a dream, it\u2019s a nightmare.\nGORGIAS Yes I do, Socrates, and let me tell what I learned after\nspeaking to that guy from up North. He thinks rhetoric is a part of political\nscience, and that political science is about securing the good life for\neveryone as far as possible, and he says that the most highly esteemed of\nthe faculties in political science are strategy, domestic economy\u2014and\nrhetoric! That\u2019s what he said in his Politics, 1094 b.\nAnd what is rhetoric about? I agree with you, Socrates: it is very\nimportant to define what rhetoric is. I think it is about how we human\nbeings can try to get each other to cooperate by using speech. If I were to\ncome back to Athens today and set up as a teacher of rhetoric again, I would\nfollow that guy\u2019s definition of what rhetoric is, and what its uses are. He\nsays in his book about rhetoric, 1357a: \u201cThe duty of rhetoric is to deal with\nsuch matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us.\u201d\nAnd he makes it very clear that what we can deliberate about is only that\nwhich we can decide to do. So rhetoric is the means we have in a\ndemocratic society to deliberate and make decisions together about our\nshared issues and problems. We can do that well or we can do it badly. Or\nwe can let a dictator or the philosophers do it for us\u2014that\u2019s what you want,\nright?\nSOCRATES But what about the truth, Gorgias, should our first concern\nnot be to find the truth? And that is where rhetoric fails us.\nGORGIAS No, Socrates, I said that rhetoric should be our means for\ndiscussing what to do. Things like, should we wage war against the\nSpartans? Should we all use the same kind of money? Should we all form a\nlarge union, or should we stand alone? In these matters we do not discuss\nwhat the truth is, we discuss what we want to do. It\u2019s like when you discuss\nat home whether to buy a home, or when you discuss whether to see an\n22 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nexhibition of sculptures or a wrestling match, you and your wife\nXanthippe\u2014\nSOCRATES You keep her out of it!\nGORGIAS What I mean is that both you and your wife have a right to\nwant what you want, and to win the discussion about it. You want to see the\nwrestlers, she wants to see the sculptures. Neither of your opinions is the\n\u201ctruth.\u201d My young Northern friend has said, in one of his books on ethics:\n\u201cchoice is not either true of false\u201d (Eudemian Ethics 1226a). It\u2019s a matter of\nwhat you want, not of finding the truth.\nSOCRATES If I want to see the wrestlers, and she wants to see the\nsculptures, then we discuss it in a civilized dialectical manner, and then we\ngo to see the sculptures. That\u2019s dialectic. No rhetoric can help me there.\nGORGIAS But without rhetoric, there\u2019s really no democracy, is there,\nSocrates?\nSOCRATES There you go again with your \u201cdemocracy.\u201d At the end of the\nday, what did I get out of it? They took a democratic vote and made me take\npoison.\nGORGIAS But democracy is not just taking a vote, Socrates, it\u2019s having a\nreasonable public discussion where we deliberate on the choice we face,\nand then we take a vote. You know, our Greek word for \u201cdeliberate\u201d is\nbased on our word for \u201cwill.\u201d But the reasonable public discussion should\nbe there first. As citizens we should all know rhetoric, not just so we can\ntake part in public debates, but also so we can attend public debates with a\ncritical ear and use what we hear, or the good parts of it, in our own\ndeliberations. And that\u2019s where we can learn from you, Socrates, you know\nhow to ask really penetrating questions, and insist on an answer to them.\nYou really have a critical ear.\nSOCRATES I have two critical ears, Gorgias.\nGORGIAS Yes, but you also need to have an appreciative ear that can\nrecognize a reasonable argument when you hear one. The citizens of\nAthens, for example, should be able to recognize both bad arguments and\ngood ones when they hear them\u2014even when the good arguments come\nfrom someone they disagree with. We should all learn to speak\u2014but what\ngood is that if no one listens to anyone else? Rhetoric can teach us that. It\u2019s\nnot enough to have a big mouth that blabbers away. But it is not enough\neither to tear apart everything that other people say, the way you sometimes\ndo. Look, this is my critical ear\u2014and this is my listening ear.\n23 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nSOCRATES I think what matters is what\u2019s between the ears, Gorgias.\nTrue wisdom, you know.\nGORGIAS What use is it that we all have true wisdom between the ears if\nwe don\u2019t also use it? I\u2019d like to quote another Athenian, who happened to\nbe my student. His name was Isocrates.\nSOCRATES I knew him, Gorgias.\nGORGIAS Well, then you also know that he wrote this: \u201cbecause there\nhas been implanted in us the power to persuade each other and to make\nclear to each other whatever we desire, not only have we escaped the life of\nwild beasts, but we have come together and founded cities and made laws\nand invented arts; and, generally speaking, there is no institution devised by\nman which the power of speech has not helped us to establish\u201d (Antidosis,\n254). What he\u2019s saying is that a city like Athens could never have existed\nwithout rhetoric.\nSOCRATES But What use is rhetoric without wisdom, Gorgias?\nGORGIAS Then again, what use is wisdom without rhetoric, Socrates?\nHere is something else that Isocrates said: \u201cit behoves all men to want to\nhave many of their youth engaged in training to become speakers, and you\nAthenians most of all. For you, yourselves, are pre-eminent and superior to\nthe rest of the world, not in your application to the business of war, nor\nbecause you govern yourselves more excellently or preserve the laws\nhanded down to you by your ancestors more faithfully than others, but in\nthose qualities by which the nature of man rises above the other animals\u201d\n(Antidosis, 293). He means speech, Socrates. He means rhetoric.\nSOCRATES Honestly, Gorgias, I think I need to go home.\nGORGIAS No, Socrates, we need you. And you know, the people of\nAthens still remember you. It\u2019s me that they\u2019ve forgotten. But they need us\nboth. I can teach them what words can do. You can teach them to be\ncritical. We can both teach them to listen to each other.\u2014Hey, are you\nlistening?!\nSOCRATES Sorry, what? Oh, right. I was just thinking that I don\u2019t know.\nIn fact I have often thought that I know nothing, except one thing, which is\nthat I don\u2019t know anything.\nGORGIAS Well, isn\u2019t that\u2019s something, Socrates?\nSOCRATES I don\u2019t know. Look, isn\u2019t it getting pretty hot here? Come on,\nlet\u2019s go.\nGORGIAS Sure, Socrates. You know, I think this is the beginning of a\nbeautiful friendship.\n24 Gorgias Reloaded: A New-Found Dialogue between Gorgias and Socrates\nREFERENCES\nAristotle. 1954.

London:\nRoutledge.\n25 2.\nChoice is Not True or False:\nThe Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation*\nLeading contemporary argumentation theories such as those of Ralph\nJohnson, Frans van Eemeren and Peter Houtlosser, and Christopher\nTindale, in their attempts to address rhetoric, tend to define rhetorical\nargumentation with reference to (a) the rhetorical arguer\u2019s goal (to\npersuade effectively), and (b) the means he employs to do so. However, a\ncentral strand in the rhetorical tradition itself, led by Aristotle, and\narguably the dominant view, sees rhetorical argumentation as defined with\nreference to the domain of issues discussed. On that view, the domain of\nrhetorical argumentation is centered on choice of action in the civic sphere,\nand the distinctive nature of issues in this domain is considered crucial.\nHence, argumentation theories such as those discussed, insofar as they do\nnot see rhetoric as defined by its distinctive domain, apply an\nunderstanding of rhetoric that is historically inadequate. It is further\nsuggested that theories adopting this understanding of rhetoric risk\nignoring important distinctive features of argumentation about action.\nSince around the century\u2019s turn, leading argumentation theorists have\nbeen keen to address, even to integrate rhetoric\u2014cf. Johnson (2000), van\nEemeren and Houtlosser (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002), and Tindale (1999,\n2004). These scholars are performing an important task. However, I aim to\nshow that if they would pay attention to the way rhetoric has been defined\nby a lineage of important thinkers in the rhetorical tradition itself, they\ncould enrich their understanding of the relationship between rhetoric and\nother approaches to argumentation, and important new insights about\nargumentation might ensue, in particular with regard to distinctive features\nof action-related argumentation.\n* Originally published in Argumentation 23 (2009), 61-80. Reprinted with permission of\nSpringer Publishers. Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nFirst we should acknowledge the fact that rhetorical thinking is about\nmuch more than argumentation. To George Campbell (1776, 1969), rhetoric\nis about \u201c[t]hat art or talent by which the discourse is adapted to its end.\u201d\nCampbell goes on to explain that \u201c[a]ll the ends of speaking are reducible to\nfour; every speech being intended to enlighten the understanding, to please\nthe imagination, to move the passions, or to influence the will.\u201d So the ends\nof discourse are multiple, and not all the discourse that Campbell would call\nrhetorical is argumentation, by any definition of that term; for example,\npoetry, in so far as it aims to \u201cplease the imagination\u201d, would not belong to\nthe subject matter of argumentation theory. Clearly, then, argumentation\ntheory does not cover the entire discipline that rhetoricians cultivate;\nargumentation and rhetoric intersect but are not coextensive. Not all of\nrhetoric is about argumentation; more importantly, not all argumentation is\nrhetorical.\nThe feature that several of the most important thinkers in the rhetorical\ntradition itself tend to emphasize in setting some argumentation apart as\n\u201crhetorical\u201d is its subject matter. They see rhetorical argumentation as\ncentered around a certain domain of issues\u2014those concerning choice of\naction, typically in the civic sphere. However, many contemporary\nargumentation theorists who address the rhetorical tradition neglect this fact\nand instead apply a view of rhetorical argumentation based on its aims and\nmeans.\nI shall support these claims by first looking at three important\nargumentation theories in our time which explicitly address rhetoric, but\nwhich define rhetorical argumentation without any reference to a domain of\nissues. Then I will show, by contrast, how a strong lineage of rhetorical\nthinking since Aristotle asserts a definition of rhetorical argumentation\nbased on its domain: that of civic issues. Finally, I will discuss special\ncharacteristics of argumentation within this domain that remain\nundertheorized in modern argumentation theories as a result of this neglect.\nI will comment on the three theories in ascending order of their\n\u201cfriendliness\u201d towards rhetoric.\nRalph Johnson, whose theory is most coherently set forth in Manifest\nRationality (2000), is one of the founders of the \u201cInformal Logic\u201d\nmovement. Insisting on the dialectical nature of argumentation, he has\nproposed the notion of a \u201cdialectical tier\u201d in argumentation as separate from\nits \u201cillative core\u201d (1996, 2000, 2002), the dialectical tier being that level in\nargumentation where the arguer addresses argumentation presented by\nopponent(s). In general, Informal Logic has much in common with\n27 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nrhetorical thinking, in particular skepticism towards formalization and\ndeductivism in argument description and evaluation. But Johnson lists three\nfeatures that, in his view, distinguish the rhetorical view of argumentation\nfrom the conception he advocates.\nFirst, rhetoric emphasizes \u201cthe need to take into account the role of\nEthos and Pathos. To be effectively rational, rhetoric will insist that the\nargument takes account of the human environment and that it, as well,\nconnects with human sentiment. Logic, on the other hand, sees the telos of\nrational persuasion as governed especially by Logos\u201d (p. 269). Secondly,\n\u201cRhetoric will not generally require a dialectical tier in the argument\u201d (p.\n270). Thirdly, regarding the evaluation of argument, Johnson states:\n\u201cInformal Logic should tend to favor the truth requirement over the\nacceptability requirement, whereas rhetoric will, I believe, take the reverse\nview\u201d (p. 271). Rhetoricians might or might not embrace this formulation,\ndepending on how it is read. The more likely reading is that, according to\nJohnson, rhetorical argumentation involves a willingness to set aside truth\nfor the sake of acceptance by the audience, i.e., persuasive efficiency. On\nthis view, rhetorical argumentation is defined by the arguer\u2019s attitude and is\nnot seen as rooted in a distinctive domain.\nMuch the same is true of the second theoretical effort we will consider:\nthe pragma-dialectical school. With a background in \u201cspeech act\u201d\nphilosophy, Popper\u2019s rationalism and a belief in the reasonable resolution of\ndisputes that has much in common with Habermas, representatives of this\nschool have taken an increasingly friendly and integrative stance towards\nrhetoric (van Eemeren and Houtlosser 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002). But\nessentially they represent the same view as in Johnson\u2019s third point, seeing\nrhetoric as persuasive efforts aimed at winning, i.e., at resolving a\ndifference of opinion in one\u2019s own favor. As a result, rhetorical\nargumentation, in their view, involves \u201cStrategic Manoeuvring\u201d, which\nmanifests itself in three respects: (1) topical selectivity, (2) audience\nadaptation, and (3) presentational devices.\nThese three points undeniably capture important aspects of rhetoric. But\nin equating rhetorical argumentation with Strategic Manoeuvring, driven by\na wish to win, van Eemeren and Houtlosser neglect the strong tradition in\nrhetorical thinking which defines rhetorical argumentation not only in terms\nof the arguer\u2019s attitude or resources, but also in terms of the issues\ndiscussed, i.e., in terms of its domain.\nDefining rhetoric as they do, van Eemeren and Houtlosser risk being\ncaught on the horns of a dilemma. What they envisage is, I contend, the\n28 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\npeaceful coexistence of two ultimately irreconcilable motives. On the one\nhand, there is the dialectical assumption, built into their theory, that the\npurpose of argumentation is to resolve a difference of opinion, which may\nentail, among other things, the obligation for at least one of the debaters,\npossibly for both, to retract or modify their original standpoint. On the other\nhand, there is the motive, in the rhetorical arguer as defined by their theory,\nto resolve the difference of opinion in his own favor. It is obvious that if\nboth parties in a discussion bring a rhetorical attitude, as thus defined, to\ntheir common enterprise, then in at least one of them the dialectical motive\nand the rhetorical motive will eventually clash; they cannot both \u201cmeet their\ndialectical obligations without sacrificing their rhetorical aims\u201d (van\nEemeren and Houtlosser 1999, p. 481). If, however, we define rhetorical\nargumentation with reference to a certain domain of issues, then we shall\nsee this dilemma dissolve.1\nThe third of the argumentation theories we shall consider, and the one\nthat most wholeheartedly embraces rhetoric, is that of Christopher Tindale\n(1999, 2004). Indeed, \u201cRhetorical Argumentation\u201d is the title of a recent\nbook of his. Yet, like Johnson and van Eemeren and Houtlosser, Tindale\nneglects many rhetoricians\u2019 domain-based definition of rhetorical\nargumentation; his view is that students of argumentation should approach\n1 Undoubtedly, van Eemeren and Houtlosser would deny that there is such a dilemma.\nIndeed, some of their formulations of how debaters could be rhetorical and dialectical at the\nsame time are such that rhetoricians ought to give them their wholehearted endorsement, for\nexample when they speak of \u201cmaintaining certain standards of reasonableness and expecting\nothers to comply with the same critical standards\u201d, after which they go on to say that this\ncommitment need not prevent debaters from \u201cattempting to resolve the difference of opinion\nin their own favour\u201d (2001, p. 151). This sounds like the position often articulated by the late\nWayne Booth, and I agree with it completely. However, obeying standards of reasonableness\nis not the same as being committed to resolving the difference of opinion. It may be true that\nif debaters in politics and other spheres did obey such standards, they would reach consensus\nmore often; but even with the severest standards upheld they often would not. Why? Some of\nthe authentic debate examples that van Eemeren and Houtlosser have analyzed are actually\nabout the kind of issues where consensus may never ensue, no matter how much reasonable\ndiscussion the discussants would have engaged in; this is also the kind of issue where\nrhetorical argumentation typically occurs. For instance, in the British debate about fox-\nhunting clearly no resolution of the difference occurs. Yet in most of the strategic\nmanoeuvres on the two sides that van Eemeren and Houtlosser have discussed there is no\nunreasonableness, no \u201cderailment\u201d of strategic manoeuvring; but there is no consensus\neither. The pragma-dialectical theory, based on the ideal of the critical discussion and aiming\nat a resolution of the difference, predicts that if the rules are obeyed, consensus will occur.\nSo why doesn\u2019t it? My answer is that legislation on fox-hunting is a typical example of an\nissue belonging to the rhetorical domain of issues\u2014those ultimately concerned with choice\nof action, not truth.\n29 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nthe entirety of argumentation from a rhetorical point of view, incorporating\nlogical and dialectical approaches in it. While Johnson and the pragma-\ndialecticians broadly agree to see argumentation in its entirety as a\ndialectical enterprise, Tindale sees argumentation, in its entirety, as a\nrhetorical pursuit: \u201cas a central human activity, argumentation is essentially\nrhetorical in ways that far exceed methodology alone\u201d (2004, p. 19). Only a\nrhetorical theory of argumentation, then, can be adequate. Central to what\nTindale understands by a rhetorical theory is \u201caddressivity\u201d, i.e., the notion\nthat argumentation essentially relates to its audience; it is always \u201cin\naudience\u201d, and similarly, it is always \u201cin language\u201d, addressing and\nanticipating its audience in its every linguistic choice. This amounts to\nsaying that all argumentation necessarily has (some of) the properties that\nvan Eemeren and Houtlosser subsume under \u201cStrategic Manoeuvring\u201d.\nFurther, while the logical approach to argumentation, according to Tindale,\nsees argumentation as product, and the dialectical approach is concerned\nwith procedure, the rhetorical approach that he favors sees it as a process in\nwhich arguer, audience, and argument are inextricably involved.2\nTo be sure, nearly everything in Tindale\u2019s approach recommends itself\nto rhetoricians. The features he highlights are indeed significant aspects of\nrhetorical argumentation which deserve illumination, and his work is full of\nvaluable insights.\nJohnson sees some argumentation as rhetorical by virtue of the strategic\nattitude held by the arguer; the pragma-dialecticians, we might perhaps say,\nsee argumentation as rhetorical in varying degrees, depending on the\namount and nature of the strategic manoeuvring present in it; Tindale sees\nall argumentation as essentially rhetorical.\nPart of what this approach implies is seen in Tindale\u2019s view that truth\nshould be replaced with acceptability in the assessment of premisses. This\nmove, in which Tindale chooses Johnson as his opponent, becomes less\nconvincing for being completely general. Tindale questions the use of\n\u201ctruth\u201d in argument evaluation across the entire front, regardless of what\nissues are being discussed. But this obscures the fact that even if his general\nobjections against truth-based argument evaluation fall, there is still a\ndomain of issues where truth would be a misplaced concept; to use a\nhomespun formulation, there are some issues where the concept of \u201ctruth\u201d\nis even more misplaced than in others. This domain is that of practical\nissues, as distinct from epistemic ones\u2014that is, issues regarding choice of\n2 This division of labour was first suggested by Wenzel (1990).\n30 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\naction rather than knowledge. Johnson and the pragma-dialecticians offer\nno indication that a theory of argumentation in the practical domain would\nhave to be in any way different from the general theory they present, for\ninstance with regard to the availability of consensus or the possibility of\ndetermining the validity of arguments independently of audiences; neither\ndoes Tindale, despite his wholesale espousal of a rhetorical perspective.\nTindale does not distinguish between rhetorical argumentation and other\ntypes of argumentation that are not rhetorical. Johnson, as we saw, does\nmakes this distinction by claiming, among other things, that rhetorical\nargumentation favors acceptability over truth. The pragma-dialecticians also\nmake the distinction in the sense that argumentation using \u201cStrategic\nManoeuvring\u201d is seen by them as rhetorical. However, the criteria we\nactually need to make the distinction do not have to do primarily with the\narguers\u2019 attitude (as in Johnson), or with the strategies used by the arguers\n(as in the pragma-dialecticians). Instead, the rhetorical attitude that arguers\nsometimes take, and the rhetorical strategies they employ, are corollaries of\nthe domain of issues about which they argue. As stated at the outset, the\nrhetorical nature of an argument or an argumentative exchange has to do\nwith the domain to which the issue in question belongs.\nSo what is this domain? The domain of rhetorical argumentation\ncentrally includes decisions about specific actions. The action may be a\npolitical one, e.g., laying down a law or declaring a war; or it may be a\nforensic action, i.e., one that responds under the law to a past act.\nTraditionally, rhetoric also includes epideictic, which is not directly tied to\naction; however, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969) see the main\nfunction of epideictic as underpinning the social values invoked in\nargumentation over actions.\nThis domain-based view of rhetorical argumentation, which sees it as\ncentrally concerned with choice of action, rather than with any issue at all,\ncan also help us realize that argumentation about actions has characteristics\nthat differ significantly from argumentation over the other main type of\nissues: those concerned with how something \u201cis\u201d.\nAnother way of marking the same distinction would be to recall the\ndistinction between, on the one hand, \u201cDirective\u201d and \u201cCommissive\u201d\nspeech act types and, on the other, \u201cAssertive\u201d speech act types in regard to\n\u201cdirection of fit\u201d. As Searle has it, \u201cthe Assertive class has the word-to-\nworld direction of fit and the Commissive and Directive classes have the\nworld-to-word direction of fit\u201d (1979a, p. 76; see also Searle 1979b, 1983).\nThe term \u201cdirection of fit\u201d originates in Austin (1953) and was explored in\n31 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nAnscombe (1957). What it pinpoints is that what matters in assertives is that\nthe word (statement) should fit the world; what matters in commissives and\ndirectives is that the world should be made to fit the word. The issue in\npublic argumentation over choice of action is a commissive, not an\nassertive.\nIt is crucial to realize that in argumentation about actions, such as\npolitical debates, the issue cannot necessarily be dialectically or\nphilosophically resolved. About some issues arguers may legitimately\nentertain, and uphold, divergent standpoints.\nThe claim that some issues are like that superficially resembles the\n\u201cProtagorean\u201d position in epistemology. To put it simply, Protagoras\nbelieved all issues were like that, while Plato\u2019s believed that no issues were\nlike that. Since Aristotle, however, a long line of rhetorical thinkers have\nrealized that some issues are essentially like that, namely those concerning\nchoice of action; here, reasonable and legitimate disagreement is common,\nso a difference of opinion between debaters may not be resolvable, no\nmatter how much reasonable discussion they engage in.\nThe distinction between those issues that are essentially resolvable and\nthose that are not, together with the very existence of these latter issues, is\noften bypassed, or explicitly denied, in philosophical thinking. However, to\nunderstand rhetoric, and to understand practical argumentation in the\npolitical sphere and elsewhere, one must accept this distinction. Further, to\nunderstand the distinction one must understand that issues relating to\nspecific actions, or to the evaluation of them, are essentially non-resolvable.\nIn discussing essentially non-resolvable issues arguers may legitimately\nwish to win and persist in this wish, resorting to \u201cStrategic Manoeuvring\u201d\nall the way. No amount of reasonable dialectical discussion will necessarily\ncompel an arguer to retract or modify his standpoint (although he is\nsometimes persuaded to do so). Instead, ethos and pathos will often be\ninvolved in debates over such issues. The existence of these kinds of issues\nunderlies Perelman\u2019s insistence on the distinction between \u201cdemonstration\u201d\nand \u201cargumentation\u201d, where argumentation, unlike demonstration, is\ninevitably audience-relative.\nIn the following section, I take a closer look at how an important\ntradition in rhetoric itself has seen rhetorical argumentation as defined by a\ndistinctive domain: issues of civic action. The first and foremost\nrepresentative of this view, I contend, is Aristotle, but the view of rhetorical\nargumentation as crucially concerned with civic action dominates rhetorical\nthinking throughout antiquity. In later epochs too it remains continually\n32 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\npresent, sometimes dominant, sometimes standing alongside other views\nwhich see \u201crhetoric\u201d as primarily defined by the rhetor\u2019s aim: to persuade.\nYet the original conception of rhetoric as a discipline that deals with\nargumentation, as hammered out by ancient theorists from Aristotle\nonwards, is centered around the notion of rhetoric as argumentation about\ncivic action.3 Consequently, an argumentation theory that defines \u201crhetoric\u201d\n(and its derivatives) primarily with reference to the arguer\u2019s aim to persuade\nhas a seriously truncated view of what rhetoric means in the rhetorical\ntradition itself. Further, I argue that theorists who accept this aim-based,\ntruncated view of rhetoric do so at a cost, since the domain-based\nconception of rhetorical argumentation as concerned with civic action could\nhave helped them understand crucial features of argumentation in this\ndomain that otherwise tend to be overlooked.\nThe focus on civic issues as central to the classical conception of\nrhetoric is well expressed in George Kennedy\u2019s unequivocal statement:\n\u201cRhetoric in Greece was specifically the civic art of public speaking as it\ndeveloped under constitutional government, especially in Athenian\ndemocracy of the fifth and fourth centuries\u201d (1999, p. 1). The emphasis on\ncivic issues was there from the beginning.\nAristotle has a twofold definition of rhetoric: an intensional and an\nextensional. As for the intensional approach, the locus classicus is this: \u201cLet\nrhetoric be [defined as] an ability, in each [particular] case, to see the\navailable means of persuasion\u201d (1355b; Kennedy\u2019s translation (1991)). This\nstatement, when read in isolation, does not in itself imply that rhetoric has a\nparticular domain of its own, but Aristotle has more to say. Other arts, such\nas medicine and geometry, have their particular domains; the doubt that this\n3 Jeffrey Walker seems to make a strong case against such a claim. He sees rhetoric as rooted\nin the poetic/epideictic kind of discourse performed by \u201csingers\u201d, aiodoi, according to\nHesiod (c. 700 BC.); the \u201cpragmatic discourse\u201d of later age is, to Walker, a \u201c\u2018secondary\u2019\nprojection of that rhetoric into the particular forums and dispute occasions of civic life\u201d\n(2000, p. 10). I have no need to contradict Walker\u2019s genealogy; as I noted initially, rhetoric\nis a wider concept than rhetorical argumentation. Yet it remains true that most ancient\ntheorists of rhetorical argumentation from Aristotle onwards see it as rooted in civic issues.\nAnd in fact, there is a reason why poetic and epideictic features of the discourse of the aiodoi\nmay be \u201cprojected\u201d into the domain of civic debate. As will be discussed below, such debate\nis about choosing action, not about the truth of propositions. In debate about choice of\naction, two opposite standpoints may both be legitimate and reasonable; it is not the case that\none is \u201ctrue\u201d while the other is \u201cfalse\u201d. Hence neither debater may be compelled by\ndialectical argument to retract his standpoint and agree with the other. Instead, debaters must\nseek to win the free adherence of their opponents and audience by including, among other\narguments and appeals, features known poetic and epideictic discourse.\n33 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nraises is whether rhetorical argumentation may then deal with these\ndomains (since no demarcation as to domain has so far been implied), or\nwhether they are off limits to rhetorical argumentation. But a few pages\nlater, in the discussion of the function of rhetoric, Aristotle effectively\ncancels out the idea that rhetorical argumentation may be about any subject\nwhatever: \u201cIts function is concerned with the sort of thing we debate\n[bouleuometha] and for which we do not have [other] arts\u201d (1357a).4 Here\nthe domain of rhetorical argumentation is expressly limited to things about\nwhich we \u201cbouleuometha\u201d, that is, \u201cdeliberate, take counsel or make a\ndecision\u201d (Liddell and Scott\u2019s counterparts for bouleuein/ bouleuesthai).\nThe stem of this verb (of which bouleuometha is the middle voice, first\nperson plural) is boul\u0113: will, determination, plan, design, decree; it is\ngenetically related to words in later languages such as volontas or, indeed,\n\u201cwill\u201d. So bouleuometha means that we resolve with ourselves (hence the\nmiddle voice) what is our will on an issue.5 Hence rhetoric is not a generic\nname for any kind of argument that aims to persuade, regardless of what it\nis about.\nThe next phrase further limits the range of rhetorical argumentation:\n\u201c\u2026and among such listeners as are not able to see many things all together\nor to reason from a distant starting point\u201d. This may imply that arguing is\nonly rhetoric when it occurs before such an audience; but another plausible\nreading is that this specifies the usual context of rhetorical argumentation,\nrather than an essential feature. The following passage adds a further\nlimitation: \u201cAnd we debate [bouleuometha] about things that seem to be\ncapable of admitting two possibilities\u201d. This implies that bouleuein/\nbouleuesthai only makes sense in relation to certain issues\u2014on my\ninterpretation those where we may decide to effectuate either one or the\nother possibility. Aristotle could not here, I suggest, be referring to all those\nissues on which people may have different views, for that would hardly\nimply any limitation at all, thus making the statement vacuous. For\nexample, the question of whether matter is composed of atoms was never an\nissue on which it would be meaningful to bouleuein.6 To be sure,\n4 This follows Kennedy\u2019s translation (1991). The translation in the complete English edition\nof Aristotle\u2019s works, by J.H. Freese (Aristotle 1926), consistently uses \u201cdeliberate\u201d, as does\nKennedy some of the time; it is a word which, like the Greek bouleuein, is tied more closely\nthan \u201cdebate\u201d to discussions of what we will.\n5 Long notes that Aristotle uses the middle voice of bouleuein throughout the Ethics, giving\nthe word the self-reflexive meaning \u201cto take council with oneself\u201d, and thereby underlining\nthe importance of this self-reflexivity to his concept of phron\u0113sis (2002, p. 52).\n6 This example will probably raise objections to the effect that, as Alan Gross (1990), Jeanne\n34 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\ngenerations of physicists argued over the existence of atoms; but (to set up a\npointed contrast) atoms cannot be \u201cwilled\u201d into existence (or out of it), so\none cannot bouleuein about their existence. An atomic bomb, on the other\nhand, can be willed into existence, so there is every reason to bouleuein\nabout doing just that. By contrast, Aristotle\u2019s next sentence again insists\nthat some issues are unsuitable for rhetorical argument: \u201cno one debates\n[bouleuetai] things incapable of being different either in past or future or\npresent, at least not if they suppose that to be the case\u201d (1359a makes an\nalmost identical stipulation).\nSo much for Aristotle\u2019s attempt to define rhetorical argumentation\nintensionally, i.e., with reference to its essential properties; we see that his\ndefinition crucially involves domain, i.e., the type of issues discussed.\nAristotle \u201cextensional\u201d definition of rhetoric enumerates its three\nconstituting genres: the deliberative, the forensic and the epideictic. This\ntoo clearly restricts the domain of rhetoric. Eugene Garver, in a\ncommentary on van Eemeren and Houtlosser, has put it simply enough:\n\u201crhetoric is restricted to the subjects of deliberation, judicial disputes and\nepideictic situations\u201d (2000, p. 311).\nSome would ask whether (and how) the epideictic genre shares all the\nfeatures Aristotle saw as essential to rhetoric. It clearly shares some features\nwith he other two genres, including their context (speeches in front of a\npublic audience) and all their linguistic resources; but it is not immediately\nclear that what we do in epideictic speeches is bouleuein in the sense just\nFahnestock (2003) and others have shown, argumentation in the natural sciences is full of\nrhetoric. However, while features of rhetorical argumentation may, unavoidably, show up\neven in domains like science, there remains a difference of principle between arguments over\ntruth and arguments over action. To be sure, a scientist may have been influenced in part by\nthe rhetoric of, e.g., Einstein\u2019s writing, to opt for atomic theory in the sense that he chooses\nto believe in the existence of atoms and to propagate this belief in his teaching, etc.; but he\nmay not decide to bring about the existence of atoms, any more than he may decide to bring\nabout anything else in the fundamental constitution of nature. He may, however, as any other\nhuman being, decide to bring about any number of changes or events in his own life, e.g., to\nmarry, to quit smoking, to eat a hamburger, to kill himself; or he may decide to help bring\nabout events and changes in the social world he inhabits, e.g., by voting for a given\npresidential candidate. Similarly, he may argue for the truth of atomic theory, but not for\natoms coming into existence; conversely, he may argue for the election of the candidate of\nhis choice, but that argument is not an argument for the \u201ctruth\u201d of that choice. Of course, an\nargument for someone\u2019s election may be (and usually is) supported by assertions whose truth\nthe arguer argues for, e.g., that the candidate is well qualified, that his policies are wise, etc.\nBut what we argue for in deliberation, such a the election of a given candidate, is not a\nproposition that may have a truth value; by contrast, what we argue for in science is precisely\na proposition that may have a truth value, even though the philosophy of science tells us that\nwe will never be able conclusively to determine that truth value.\n35 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\ndiscussed. In the other two genres we clearly do that: in the deliberative\ngenre we argue about a future action in order to reach a decision together\n(hence genos SUM-bouleutikon); this does not imply that we all agree on\nthat decision, but, to apply a distinction suggested by Rescher (1993), those\nwho do not agree with it acquiesce to it. In the forensic genre, we argue in\norder to decide on our action in response to a fact in the past (a crime or\nother legal issue, to which we may decide to respond with a certain\npunishment or other legal action). So both these genres fit the description of\nthe domain of rhetorical argumentation given above: we argue about what\naction it is our will to take. The epideictic only fits that description more\nindirectly; as noted above, Perelman (1969) sees epideictic speeches as\nconsolidating the values on which all debate about actions and judgments\nmust rest (for a related view, see Hauser 1999). Arguably, however,\nAristotle\u2019s intensional definition of rhetoric (based on the nature of its\ndomain) is not completely coextensive with his extensional definition; but\nboth agree on defining rhetoric and rhetorical argumentation with reference\nnot to a motive or a set of resources, but to a certain domain.\nIn Chapters 4\u20138 of the Rhetoric, Book I, Aristotle goes on to discuss\nwhat he clearly sees as the first and foremost of the three genres: the\ndeliberative. He uses the same words (primarily bouleuein/bouleuesthai)\nand makes many of the same stipulations as he did about rhetoric in general\nin the first chapters, thus in effect elevating the deliberative to the\nquintessence of rhetoric, and reiterating how deliberation is restricted to a\ncertain domain of issues, i.e., things that we may decide to do:\nAs to whatever necessarily exists or will exist or is impossible to be or to\nhave come about, on these matters there is no deliberation\u2026the subjects\nof deliberation [peri hos\u014dn estin to bouleuesthai] are clear; and these are\nwhatever, by their nature, are within our power and of which the\ninception lies with us (1359a).\nThis domain-based notion of rhetorical argumentation is also manifest in\nthe following reproach: \u201cmuch more than its proper area of consideration\nhas currently been assigned to rhetoric\u201d (1359b). There could hardly be a\n\u201cproper area\u201d if rhetorical argumentation is persuasive argument on\nanything. But who is the target of criticism here? A likely answer is:\nsophists who have taught that all issues belong to the domain of rhetoric.\nThe remarks in the Rhetoric on the restricted domain of bouleuein do not\nstand alone. Again and again in Aristotle\u2019s other writings on ethics, politics,\nand related subjects, we find similar, emphatic stipulations. The\nNicomachean Ethics is quite insistent:\n36 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\n\u2026 nobody deliberates about things eternal, such as the order of the\nuniverse, or the incommensurability of the diagonal and the side, of a\nsquare. Nor yet about things that change but follow a regular process,\nwhether from necessity or by nature or through some other cause: such\nphenomena for instance as the solstices and the sunrise. Nor about\nirregular occurrences, such as droughts and rains. Nor about the results\nof chance, such as finding a hidden treasure. The reason why we do not\ndeliberate about these things is that none of them can be effected by our\nagency. We deliberate about things that are in our control and are\nattainable by action\u2026we do not deliberate about all human affairs\nwithout exception either: for example, no Lacedaemonian deliberates\nabout the best form of government for Scythia; but any particular set of\nmen deliberates about the things attainable by their own actions (1112a;\nthis is Rackham\u2019s translation, which, unlike Kennedy\u2019s translation of the\nRhetoric, is consistent in translating bouleuein as \u201cdeliberate\u201d).\nLikewise, the Eudemian Ethics has several pointed formulations\ninsisting that we can only bouleuein about things we may choose to do\nbecause they \u201crest with us\u201d: \u201cwe do not deliberate about affairs in India, or\nabout how to square the circle; for affairs in India do not rest with us,\nwhereas the objects of choice and things practicable are among things\nresting with us\u201d (1226a).\nTo sum up, bouleuein/bouleuesthai is what we do in rhetorical\nargumentation; moreover, it is a central concept in Aristotle\u2019s ethical and\npolitical thinking, as is witnessed by the dozens of occurrences of it, many\nwith careful discussion, not only in the Rhetoric, but also in the ethical\nbooks, the Politics, the Athenian Constitution, the Virtues and Vices, the\nMetaphysics, and others. These passages embody a notion of bouleuein as\napplicable only to debate over actions within the debaters\u2019 agency. In brief,\nthe domain of rhetorical argumentation is, for Aristotle, civic action, that is,\nissues concerning how a body of humans will choose to act.\nThis exegesis of course comes with the qualification that Aristotle\u2019s text\nis complex and often appears to contradict itself. The scope of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of rhetoric remains contested\u2014see, for example, the variety of\npositions in Gross and Walzer\u2019s volume (2000). Even so, the point that\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d is about actions within our own agency stands out so strongly\nin the Aristotelian corpus that commentators should pay more attention to it\nthan they have.\nCertainly the notion that rhetorical argumentation is about civic action is\nasserted again and again by later Hellenistic rhetoricians. According to\n37 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nKennedy (1994, p. 97, citing Sextus Empiricus\u2019 Against the Professors,\n2.62), Hermagoras of Temnos defined the duty of the orator as \u201cto treat the\nproposed political question (politikon z\u0113t\u0113ma) as persuasively as possible\u201d.\nAlthough his writings are lost, we know from the many references to him in\nCicero, Quintilian, and others, that for Hermagoras rhetoric was rooted in\ncivic life (this is the meaning of \u201cpolitical\u201d); forensic and deliberative\ndebate were its two pillars.\nMuch of the Hermagorean thinking is reproduced in the earliest Latin\nbook of rhetoric, the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium, and in Cicero\u2019s\nDe inventione. The Rhetorica ad Herennium (Anon 1964; c. 90 BC) defines\nthe function of the orator as follows (in Caplan\u2019s translation): \u201cThe task of\nthe public speaker is to discuss capably those matters which law and custom\nhave fixed for the uses of citizenship [ad usum civilem], and to secure as far\nas possible the agreement of his hearers\u201d (I.II.2). Notice how the definition\nof the domain of rhetoric given here goes hand in hand with the\nunderstanding that the object sought in rhetoric is the agreement [adsensio]\nof hearers (or as Perelman would say: their adherence); further, that the\nadherence of one\u2019s hearers is a matter of degree in the sense that one should\nseek to secure it as far as possible\u2014a phrase echoing Aristotle\u2019s\nendechomenon.\nCicero\u2019s youthful work De inventione (Cicero 1968; c. 85 BC) endorses\nAristotle\u2019s extensional circumscription of rhetoric to the three genres, and\nagrees that the domain of rhetorical argumentation is indeed circumscribed;\nhe proposes to classify \u201coratorical ability as a part of political science\u201d (I,\nvi, 6). Accordingly, Hermagoras is criticized for including too much in the\n\u201cmaterial of the orator\u201d, namely both \u201cspecial cases\u201d [causae] and \u201cgeneral\nquestions\u201d [quaestiones] like \u201cIs there any good except honor?\u201d This\ndichotomy appears also under the names definite vs. infinite questions.\nRhetorical argumentation has no business dealing with the latter, whereas\nthe former constitute its distinctive domain: \u201cIt seems the height of folly to\nassign to an orator as if they were trifles these subjects in which we know\nthat the sublime genius of philosophers has spent so much labour\u201d (I, vi, 8).\nCicero may later have felt that he limited the domain of rhetorical\nargumentation unduly by assigning only the finite issues to its domain.\nSome of his later writings on rhetoric further dichotomize the \u201cinfinite\u201d\nissues into questions about cognition and questions about action. De\npartitione oratoria (c. 45 BC) distinguishes between a \u201cpropositum\ncognitionis\u201d, whose object is a scientia, and a \u201cpropositum actionis, quod\nrefertur ad faciendum quid\u201d. While the former, we may assume, is still the\n38 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\ndomain of philosophers and \u201cfar removed from the business of an orator\u201d, it\nis debatable whether the latter category of issues should be seen as\nphilosophical, rhetorical, or something in between, a \u201crhetoric of the\nphilosophers\u201d, as it were\u2014a term actually used by Cicero in De finibus\n2.6.17, as discussed by Remer (1999, p. 46). (Today many would call such\nthinking \u201cpractical philosophy\u201d.) What remains clear is that rhetorical\nargumentation is still defined by the social and practical nature of the issues\ndiscussed. A statement to that effect from Cicero\u2019s fullest work of rhetorical\nthinking is these words of the statesman and lawyer Antonius in De oratore\n(Cicero 1967; c. 55 BC):\n\u2026 to return to our starting point, let us take the orator to be someone\nwho, as Crassus described him, is able to speak in a manner that is suited\nto persuasion. Moreover, let his sphere be restricted to the ordinary\npractice of public life in communities; let him put aside all other\npursuits, however magnificent and splendid they may be, and, so to\nspeak, be hard pressed day and night in performing this one labor. (Book\nI, 260)\nHere the broader, motive-based definition (\u201cto speak in a manner that is\nsuited to persuasion\u201d) is narrowed and thus becomes the \u201cclassical\u201d,\ndomain-based definition of rhetoric as speaking about \u201cthe ordinary practice\nof public life in communities\u201d. Cicero lets Scaevola take a similar view\n(Book I, 35\u201344). It is true that Crassus\u2014whose views are usually taken to\ncoincide with Cicero\u2019s own mature position\u2014represents the more\nexpansive conception of rhetoric, where rhetors are in effect defined as\npractical philosophers; this is most clearly seen in his famous eulogy of\noratory as the founder and upholder of human societies. The others object to\nthe breadth of the scope of rhetoric as Crassus sees it, or rather, they\nquestion the comprehensiveness of the wisdom and knowledge attributed to\nthe rhetor. The fact remains that all three interlocutors, including Crassus,\nfirmly link the function of rhetoric to the practical and social sphere; in the\nwords of Crassus, rhetoric pertains to the \u201chumanum cultum civilem\u201d and\nthe establishment of \u201cleges iudicia iura\u201d (Book I, 33).\nIn some of the rhetorical thinkers who build on Aristotle and Cicero we\nsee a broad, \u201cgeneral\u201d definition and a narrow, \u201ccivic\u201d definition either\nalternate or coexist. Quintilian\u2019s Institutio oratoria (Quintilian 2001; c. 90\nAD), conceived in a time of absolute imperial power where citizens had\nlittle room for debate and less for decision on the practice of public life,\nleans toward the broad view, making rhetoric the centerpiece of the\neducation of the \u201cgood man\u201d; yet Quintilian too, echoing Isocrates and\n39 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nCicero\u2019s Crassus, emphasizes the indispensability of rhetoric in the domain\nof civic action: \u201cI cannot imagine how the founders of cities would have\nmade a homeless multitude come together to form a people, had they not\nmoved them by their skilful speech, or how legislators would have\nsucceeded in restraining mankind in the servitude of the law had they not\nhad the highest gifts of oratory\u201d (II.xvi.9). So even if, to Quintilian, rhetoric\ndoes not necessarily concern communal civic action, the intimate bond\nbetween the two still holds in the sense that communal civic action\nnecessarily involves rhetoric; and despite the broadness of his definition,\naction is still at its center: \u201cin the main, rhetoric is concerned with action;\nfor in action it accomplishes that which it is its duty to do \u2026 it is with\naction that its practice is chiefly and most frequently concerned\u201d (II.xviii.2).\nTo Greek rhetoricians in the following centuries, the domain of rhetoric\nwas even more sharply defined, as Malcolm Heath makes clear: \u201cThe\npremise that rhetoric was concerned with speech on civic questions is\nsomething on which Zeno, Minucianus, and Hermogenes still agreed in the\nsecond century AD\u201d (2004, p. 299). Hermogenes (c. 150 AD), who was to\nbecome for centuries the authoritative rhetorician in the Byzantine world,\ngives no explicit definition of rhetoric, but in the opening of his treatise on\nstasis simply declares: \u201cThe present discussion deals with the division of\npolitical questions into what are known as heads\u201d; he goes on to stipulate\nthat a political question (politikon z\u0113t\u0113ma) is \u201ca rational dispute on a\nparticular matter, based on the established laws or customs of any given\npeople, concerned with what is considered just, honourable, advantageous,\nor all or some of all these things together. It is not the function of rhetoric to\ninvestigate what is really and universally just, honourable, etc.\u201d (Quoted\nfrom Heath 1995, p. 14). A similar assumption that rhetoric is\nargumentation about political issues is evident in the two Greek treatises of\nthe third century edited by Dilts and Kennedy (1997), the \u201cArt of Political\nSpeech\u201d by Anonymous Seguerianus and the \u201cArt of Rhetoric\u201d by Apsines\nof Gadara.\nA string of rhetoricians writing in Latin under Christian emperors\ncontinue to assert the civic/political definition. In the De rhetorica formerly\nattributed to St. Augustine the rhetor undertakes his task \u201cproposita\nquaestione civili\u201d (Halm 1863, p. 137). Sulpicius Victor (c. 400 AD)\nexpressly rejects the broad \u201cbene dicendi scientia\u201d as his definition of\nrhetoric in favor of \u201cbene dicendi scientia in quaestione civili\u201d, noting that\nin such questions it is asked \u201cwhether something should be done or not\ndone, whether it is just or unjust, expedient or inexpedient\u201d (Halm 1863, p.\n40 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\n313). To C. Chirius Fortunatianus (c. 450 AD) the function of the orator is\n\u201c[t]o speak well on civil questions. To what end? In order to persuade,\ninsofar as the state of affairs and the attitude of the audience permits, in\ncivil questions\u201d (Halm 1863, p. 81; translated in Miller et al. 1973, p. 25).\nBoethius (c. 457\u2013526), in De topicis differentiis (Boethius 1978), aims to\neffect a grand synthesis of argumentative topics into a single art. While the\ndialectical discipline \u201cexamines the thesis only\u201d (1205C), the subject matter\nof rhetoric is \u201cthe political question\u201d (1207C); it is concerned with\n\u201chypotheses, that is, questions hedged in a multitude of circumstances\u201d\n(1205D). He notes another difference not often attended to by modern\nargumentation theorists, namely that the rhetorician \u201chas as judge someone\nother than his opponent, someone who decides between them\u201d (1206C). So,\naccording to Boethius, rhetorical argumentation addresses audiences, not\nopponents, and is defined by its domain: that of civic/political issues. It may\nbe said of Boethius as of many of the other thinkers we are enumerating\nhere: all the distinctive properties of rhetorical argumentation, including its\ngeneral aim, persuasiveness, and its specific topics and resources, follow as\ncorollaries of its domain. As I shall discuss in more detail shortly, when a\ndebate is about choosing action, not about the truth of propositions, two\nopposite standpoints may both be legitimate and reasonable; it is not the\ncase that one is \u201ctrue\u201d while the other is \u201cfalse\u201d. Hence neither debater may\nbe dialectically compelled to retract his standpoint and agree with the other.\nDebaters must instead try to persuade their opponents (or audiences) to give\ntheir adherence freely; this they do by employing a broader range of\n(noncompelling) topics and resources than the limited range of resources\nthrough which, in dialectics, agreement may be compelled. The domain-\nbased definition is upheld throughout the Middle Ages even by thinkers\naiming to apply ancient teachings to the purposes of the church, such as\nIsidore of Seville (c. 630): \u201cRhetoric is the science of speaking well: it is a\nflow of eloquence on civil questions whose purpose is to persuade men to\ndo what is just and good\u201d (Miller et al. 1973, p. 80); and Rabanus Maurus\n(c. 820): \u201cRhetoric is, as the ancients have told us, skill in speaking well\nconcerning secular matters in civil cases\u201d (Miller et al., 1973, p. 125).\nHonorius of Autin (12th Century) describes rhetoric as \u201cthe second city\nthrough which the road toward home passes\u201d and declares: \u201cThe gate of the\ncity is civil responsibility, and the highway is the three ways of exercising\nthat responsibility: demonstrative oratory, deliberative, and judicial\u201d (Miller\net al. 1973, p. 201). For encyclopedists of the 13th Century such as Vincent\nde Beauvais and Brunetto Latini rhetoric is indisputably the science of\n41 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nspeaking well on civil questions; for the latter, it \u201cis under the science of\ngoverning the city just as the art of making bits and saddles is included\nunder the art of cavalry\u201d (Robert 1960, p. 110).\nRenaissance culture in Italy sees a resurgence of rhetorical thinking with\na decisive emphasis on the civic definition. Fumaroli states that \u201crhetoric\nappears as the connective tissue peculiar to civil society and to its proper\nfinalities, happiness and political peace hic et nunc\u201d (1983, pp. 253\u2013254).\nAccording to Cox (2003), rhetoric in Quattrocento Italy \u201cpositioned itself,\nas it had done in Cicero\u2019s Rome, as an essential component of the science\nof government, teaching as it did the skills of rational persuasion through\nwhich collective decisions were reached\u2026 Practical utility, and specifically\nutility to civic life, is patently the governing criterion of the genre\u201d (p. 671).\nThe first and perhaps the most comprehensive renaissance textbook of\nrhetoric, George of Trebizond\u2019s Rhetoricorum libri quinque (c. 1430),\ndrawing on the Rhetorica ad Herennium and other classical sources,\nconsistently affirms the domain-based view of rhetoric as \u201ca science of\ncivic life in which, with the agreement of the audience insofar as possible,\nwe speak on civil questions\u201d (quoted from Kennedy 1999, p. 235). Thomas\nWilson\u2019s Art of Rhetoric, as one of many Renaissance rhetoric texts in the\nvernacular, squarely identifies the \u201cMatter Whereupon an Orator Must\nSpeak\u201d as civic issues, i.e., as \u201call those questions which by law and man\u2019s\nordinance are enacted and appointed for the use and profit of man\u201d (1994\n[1560], p. 45)\u2014a close paraphrase of the Rhetorica ad Herennium.\nWhile the lineage of politically-based definitions of rhetoric thus\nremains unbroken from antiquity until the Renaissance, it is true that there\nare also, most of that time, thinkers asserting the broader, persuasion-based\ndefinition. In fact, this tradition gains strength in the following centuries\u2014\nan epoch where rhetoric falls into academic and philosophical disrepute,\nbranded as verbal trickery by leading thinkers such as Locke and, a century\nlater, Kant.7 Giambattista Vico\u2019s is a lonely voice speaking up for rhetoric;\ncharacteristically, his Institutiones oratoriae (1711\u20131741) reasserts the\naction-centred definition: \u201cThe task of rhetoric is to persuade or bend the\nwill of others. The will is the arbiter of what is to be done and what is to be\navoided. Therefore, the subject matter of rhetoric is whatever is that which\nfalls under deliberation of whether it is to be done or not to be done\u201d (1996,\n7 For Locke rhetoric is a \u201cpowerful instrument of error and deceit\u201d (1959 [1690], II, p. 146;\nBook III, X, p. 34); for Kant it is \u201cgar keiner Achtung w\u00fcrdig\u201d (1914 [1790], p. 404; Sect.\n53, footnote).\n42 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\n9). Perhaps the most influential 18th Century rhetorician, Hugh Blair\n(1783), leans towards the broader definition but, like Quintilian, maintains\nthat \u201cthe most important subject of discourse is Action, or Conduct, the\npower of Eloquence chiefly appears when it is employed to influence\nConduct, and persuade to Action\u201d (2004, p. 265).\nThe 20th and 21st Centuries have seen the gradual return of rhetoric to\nacademic respectability. It is true that the term itself has meant a variety of\nthings to different modern thinkers, but the notion that rhetoric is defined\nprimarily by its domain of issues is common to a series of the most\nimportant ones. To Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca that domain is generally\ndefined as those issues where arguers seek the adherence of audiences\nrather than the demonstration of truths; but from the start they treat\n\u201cdeliberation and argumentation\u201d as synonyms (1969, p. 1) and describe\ntheir aim as \u201ca theory of argumentation that will acknowledge the use of\nreason in directing our own actions and influencing those of others\u201d (3).\nThe view of rhetorical argumentation as crucially concerned with action\nseems to become clearer in later writings by Perelman, such as the long\narticle which summarizes his theory (1970), significantly titled \u201cThe New\nRhetoric: A Theory of Practical Reasoning\u201d. Other seminal thinkers on\nrhetoric in our time who have maintained the same connection include\nLloyd Bitzer: \u201ca work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for\nthe sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce\naction or change in the world\u201d (1968, p. 4) and Gerard Hauser: \u201crhetorical\ncommunication, at least implicitly and often explicitly, attempts to\ncoordinate social action\u201d (2002, p. 3).\nTo sum up, it seems fair on this background to say that when\ncontemporary argumentation theorists such as those discussed in the first\nsection, in their attempt to address or integrate rhetoric, adopt a view of it as\ndefined primarily by a motive to persuade, without considering the domain-\nbased view of rhetoric as deliberation about civic action, then they neglect\nwhat is arguably the dominant notion in the rhetorical tradition itself of its\nidentity.\nBut what makes this oversight important? Why does an argumentation\ntheory guilty of this oversight\u2014even a theory that integrates rhetoric or\nprofesses to be rhetorical\u2014run the risk of seriously underestimating\nimportant insights and distinctions?\nThe answer is that argumentation which is concerned with proposals for\naction has distinctive properties setting it apart from argumentation over\npropositions; these are the properties that are easily overlooked by\n43 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nargumentation theories, such as the three we have discussed, which see\nargumentation as concerned with the truth or falsity of propositions and\ninferences. Whenever a debater argues for a certain action and/or an\nopponent argues against it, neither of these two standpoints can ever be\npredicated to be \u201ctrue\u201d. As Aristotle points out in the Eudemian Ethics, in\ndeliberation we argue about choice; and a choice is not a proposition that\ncan be true or false:\n\u2026 it is manifest that purposive choice is not opinion either, nor\nsomething that one simply thinks; for we saw that a thing chosen is\nsomething in one\u2019s own power, but we have opinions as to many things\nthat do not depend on us, for instance that the diagonal of a square is\nincommensurable with the side; and again, choice is not true or false.\n(1226a)\nOne way to explain why this is so is the following. When a human (or a\ncollective of humans, such as a legislative body) deliberates about a choice,\nseveral values may be invoked both pro and con, and several desirable\n\u201cends\u201d will be variously affected by whatever choice is eventually made.\nFriends, wealth, health, honor, security are some of them (Aristotle has\nenumerated these in Book I, Chapter 5 of the Rhetoric). Normally, a given\nproposal cannot serve all these ends equally; if it is designed to serve one of\nthem, the consideration of one at least of the other ends may speak against\nit. For example, the introduction in public hospitals of a new treatment\nwhich can help some patients may be so costly that it hinders the attainment\nof other worthy ends; any decision that has a cost by the same token\nprecludes the use of the same financial means for some other proposal.\nHowever, there is no generally agreed and intersubjective way to calculate\nand balance benefits in one area against costs in another; for example, most\npeople would agree that not all the important considerations relevant to\npolitical actions can (or should) be converted into economic terms. In\naddition to economic cost there are all sorts of other accounts on which a\nproposal may be either recommended or opposed. For example, national\nsecurity considerations that may arguably be served by, e.g., the indefinite\ndetainment of suspected terrorists might be contradicted by\ncounterconsiderations of ethics, legality, honor, or the friendship of other\ncountries. In such situations, some individuals in the governing body and\nthe electorate usually judge that the considerations speaking for the\nproposal or policy outweigh those against, while other individuals judge\njust as decisively that those speaking against it are weightier.\n44 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nSo in principle, deliberation will always have to recognize the relevance\nof several ends, several kinds of considerations, and several dimensions to\nthe choice that has to be made. Moreover, individuals will differ in regard\nto the relative weight they assign to them. It may be that for each\nconsideration in itself\u2014such as the economic cost of a war, or its cost in\nhuman lives\u2014debaters may have views that may be more or less true (or at\nleast probable). But the fact remains that the relevant considerations in such\na case belong to different dimensions, so that none of these considerations,\ne.g., cost in human lives, can be reduced or converted to one of the others,\nor to a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d or \u201ccovering\u201d unit for all the relevant\nconsiderations. What lacks is, in a phrase from John Stuart Mill, a\n\u201ccommon umpire\u201d (1969, p. 226) to which all the considerations may be\nreferred, yielding an objective calculation of how to balance the pros and\nthe cons.\nThis is where we may see the importance of insisting that the central\ndomain of rhetoric is debate over proposals for action, and of setting this\ndomain apart from that of propositions. Proposals and choices cannot be\n\u201ctrue\u201d, and do not aspire to it. The problem is not that it is hard to assess the\ntruth value of a political proposal, or that \u201cprobability\u201d will have to do;\nmore radically, it is a categorical mistake to speak of truth (or probability,\nfor that matter) in regard to a proposal as such. It may be supported by\npropositions that can be true (or probable); but in principle, none of the\nopposing standpoints in a deliberation can ever possess truth. Hence,\ndebaters representing opposite courses of action may legitimately do so, and\ncontinue to do so. Because of the inherent multi-dimensional structure of\ndeliberation over proposals (i.e., the fact that several competing ends or\nconsiderations may be invoked), debaters may assess the aggregate weight\nof the pros and the cons differently, and continue to do so; the same holds\nfor the individuals who listen to them and whose adherence they seek.\nLooking back, we may now see why it is that the dilemma faced by van\nEemeren and Houtlosser dissolves when we realize that rhetorical\nargumentation is rooted in the domain of proposals and action, not in that of\npropositions and truth. The dilemma was that arguers cannot \u201cmeet their\ndialectical obligations without sacrificing their rhetorical aims\u201d (1999, p.\n481), where the arguers\u2019 \u201crhetorical aims\u201d refer to their intention to \u201cwin\u201d\n(have the difference of opinion resolved in their own favor). There is no\ndilemma because arguers debating proposals are not dialectically obliged to\nresolve their difference of opinion. In debating choice of action there is no\ntruth to be attained, and unlike what happens in Socratic dialectic, or in\n45 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\npragma-dialectical \u201ccritical discussion\u201d, opponents arguing reasonably will\nnot necessarily move towards consensus. The opposing standpoints\nrepresented by the two debaters are not contradictory propositions that\ncannot both be true, and of which at least one has accordingly to be\nretracted or modified; they are about choice, and, in the words of Aristotle,\n\u201cchoice is not true or false\u201d. Arguing for a given choice and arguing against\nit are in principle equally legitimate standpoints, and it is not the case that,\nas a result of reasonable discussion between the two arguers, one of the\nstandpoints must necessarily be retracted. So it is not unreasonable for both\narguers, when the issue is choice of action, to wish to win (and hence to\nresort to \u201cStrategic Manoeuvring\u201d): it would only be unreasonable for an\narguer to persist in his wish to win if his standpoint had to be retracted as a\nresult of the discussion\u2014 which is not necessarily the case.\nThe fact that, in matters of choice, none of the arguers will necessarily\nbe forced to retract his standpoint, and, conversely, that none can\nconclusively \u201cprove\u201d his standpoint, is also the reason why all the resources\nof rhetorical argumentation: ethos and pathos, topical selectivity, audience\nadaptation, presentational devices, and more, will usually be mustered.\nEven if arguers cannot demonstrate the \u201ctruth\u201d of their standpoints, they\nmay try to win the adherence of the individuals in the audience, or even of\ntheir opponent, for them. The pros and the cons in a given issue of choice\ncannot be aggregated or balanced in an intersubjective manner, since no\ncommon measure exists; individuals must assess the relative weights of the\npros and cons by their own lights, but arguers have all the resources of\nrhetoric at their disposal to win their adherence.\nAs we have seen, a strong and unbroken tradition of rhetorical thinking\nfrom Aristotle until the present sees rhetoric as defined by its domain:\nissues of choice in the civic sphere, where the adherence of other\nindividuals may be worked upon and perhaps gained. But doing just that is\nalso an important concern for arguers discoursing on issues outside the\ncircumscribed domain of civic action; most proponents of, e.g., scientific or\nphilosophical theories naturally wish to be persuasive. So the resources of\nrhetorical argumentation also play a part outside its central domain; indeed,\nmany thinkers in the rhetorical tradition itself lean towards the \u201cbroad\u201d\ndefinition. Nevertheless it is problematic when theorists of argumentation\nsee rhetoric as primarily or even exclusively defined by the arguer\u2019s wish to\npersuade. Such a truncated definition allows theorists to forget what most\nrhetorical thinkers have always known, namely that argumentation\nconcerning choice of action is a distinct domain with distinctive features.\n46 Choice is Not True or False: The Domain of Rhetorical Argumentation\nTo reiterate, some of these distinctive features of rhetorical\nargumentation are the following: in argumentation about choice of action\nreasonable disagreement may exist and persist indefinitely8; in that domain\nit is not the case that one of two opposed arguers may conclusively prove\nhis standpoint, or be forced to retract it; but it is a domain rich in resources\nby which arguers may influence other individuals\u2019 adherence. When an\nissue is truly a matter of choice, as in political deliberation and the civic\nsphere generally, rhetorical argumentation plays a central and indispensable\npart, precisely because \u201cchoice is not true or false\u201d. Every individual,\nlegislator or voter regularly has choices to face; rhetoric is a social practice\nthat helps us choose. In the words of the Nicomachean Ethics (1112b),\nquoted by Garver (2000, p. 310): \u201cOn any important decision we deliberate\ntogether because we do not trust ourselves\u201d.\nREFERENCES\nAnon. 1964.

How can he posit this distinction and yet not dismiss\npractical reasoning as flattery and manipulation, as Plato did? The answer\nlies in the concepts of deliberation (boul\u0113, bouleusis) and deliberate choice\n(proairesis). They link Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric, ethics, and politics together and\nhelp provide definitions of all three: ethics is about deliberate choices by\nindividuals. Politics and rhetoric are about the collective deliberate choices\nby the polity: politics is about making these choices well so that the good\nlife of all citizens is optimally secured; rhetoric is the principal means to do\nthis. These links have not been much discussed by scholars, probably\nbecause few studies range across these three Aristotelian \u201carts\u201d; a proper\ndiscussion of them should draw on modern work in ethics, political science,\nand rhetoric. These key concepts and Aristotle\u2019s discussions of them offer\ninspiration for modern theories of \u201cdeliberative democracy,\u201d citizenship,\nargumentation, debate, and the public sphere.\nOne important difference emphasized by Aristotle which Plato had\nsought to downplay concerns reasoning in different realms. Aristotle differs\nfrom his master, and from many later philosophers, in seeing epistemic\nreasoning and practical reasoning as distinct domains. In the former, the\nconcern is to find truth, or, failing that, the nearest we can come to it:\nprobability. In the latter, what we are ultimately concerned with is not truth\nbut decisions on action.\n* Originally published in Let\u2019s Talk Politics. New Essays on Deliberative Rhetoric, H. Van\nBelle, P.

Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\nBy insisting on this as an essential feature of practical reasoning, and\nmore specifically, of that subspecies of it which he calls rhetoric, Aristotle\nbared a flank to a charge that has ever since been leveled against rhetoric,\nmost forcefully by Plato: that it is truth-neglecting flattery and\nmanipulation.\nIt is well known that Aristotle did not agree with this charge. It is less\nclearly realized that the reason why has to do with his concepts of\ndeliberation and deliberate choice. Not only do they help furnish a reply to\nthe charge, they also link together Aristotle\u2019s theories of rhetoric, ethics,\nand politics together and help provide definitions of all three: ethics is about\ndeliberate choices by individuals. Politics and rhetoric are about the\ncollective deliberate choices by the polity: politics is about making these\nchoices well so that the good life of all citizens is optimally secured;\nrhetoric is one of the principal means to do this.\nThese links have not been much discussed by scholars, probably because\nfew scholars have had interests ranging across all the three Aristotelian\n\u201carts\u201d just mentioned. Moreover, if we want to have the full benefit of\nAristotle\u2019s cross-disciplinary thinking in this area, it will be useful also to\nconnect it with modern work in ethics, political science, and rhetoric. These\nkey concepts and Aristotle\u2019s discussions of them offer inspiration for\nmodern theories of \u201cdeliberative democracy,\u201d citizenship, argumentation,\ndebate, and the public sphere.\nThe original terms in Aristotle usually translated as \u201cdeliberation\u201d are\nboul\u0113 and bouleusis. The core meaning of boul\u0113 is usually given as \u201cwill,\ndetermination\u201d; there is probably a genetic relation between boul\u0113 in Greek,\nvoluntas in Latin, and modern equivalents like will in English, Wille in\nGerman, etc. The corresponding verb, bouleuein, is usually translated in\nAristotle\u2019s writings as \u201cto deliberate\u201d.9\nThis term is crucially important in several of Aristotle\u2019s writings,\nprimarily in the ethical works. In all of them, he specifically insists that we\n9 It is striking that the modern translation of the Rhetoric most frequently quoted, that of\nGeorge Kennedy, unlike older translations like that of Freese and others, is inconsistent in its\nrenderings of this word and its derivatives; for example, in a crucial passage where Aristotle\nstates the function of rhetoric, using the medial first person plural of bouleuein, i.e.,\nbouleuometha, Kennedy\u2019s translation says that rhetoric is \u201cconcerned with the sort of things\nwe debate\u201d (1357a; Kennedy, p. 41; my emphasis). As will be clear below, Aristotle is\ninsistent that what we \u201cdeliberate\u201d upon is a clearly defined subcategory of that which we\n\u201cdebate\u201d. There seems to be no reason for Kennedy\u2019s choice here other than carelessness\u2014\nbut he is not alone among modern scholars in overlooking how Aristotle makes a crucial\ndistinction and sharply demarcates the scope of rhetoric.\n53 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\ncan only deliberate about what we can undertake ourselves. \u201cWe deliberate\nabout things that are in our power and can be done\u201d (Nicomachean Ethics\n1112a) is one of many statements. Another is: \u201cwe do not deliberate about\nthe affairs of the Indians nor how the circle may be squared; for the first are\nnot in our power, the second is wholly beyond the power of action\u201d\n(Eudemian Ethics 1226a). So, for example, \u201cno one deliberates about what\ncannot be otherwise\u201d (Nicomachean Ethics 1139b, with an almost identical\nformulation at 1140a); \u201csince it is impossible to deliberate about things that\nare of necessity, practical wisdom cannot be knowledge nor art\u201d (ibid.,\n1140b); \u201cabout things that could not have been, and cannot now or in the\nfuture be, other than they are, nobody who takes them to be of this nature\nwastes his time in deliberation\u201d (Rhetoric 1357a).\nDeliberation is the kind of reasoning that precedes deliberate choice, for\nwhich Aristotle\u2019s term is proairesis (some translate it \u201cpurposive choice\u201d,\ne.g., Kenny 1979). Proairesis literally means \u201ctaking something rather than\n(something else)\u201d.\nWhat makes these concepts so important to Aristotle\u2019s ethical thinking is\nthat the individual\u2019s deliberate choices are what primarily determines that\nindividual\u2019s ethical worth. Rhetoric, however, is also about deliberate\nchoice, but of a different kind, i.e., collective choices by people organized\nin groups like the polis.\nThe identity of rhetoric is closely bound up with deliberation, inasmuch\nas the function of rhetoric (its ergon) is \u201cto deal with such matters as we\ndeliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us, in the hearing of\npersons who cannot take in at a glance a complicated argument, or follow a\nlong chain of reasoning\u201d (1357a). In most references to Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition(s) of rhetoric it tends to be forgotten that rhetoric is thus rooted in\n\u201csuch matters as we deliberate upon\u201d; instead, all the attention is given to\nterms like \u201cthe available means of persuasion\u201d (1355b), \u201cpresent us with\nalternative possibilities\u201d (1357a), the presence of hearers, the lack of\nsystematic rules, and other features. However, the restriction of rhetoric to\ndealing with \u201csuch matters as we deliberate upon,\u201d in the understanding just\nstated, is a crucial element in Aristotle\u2019s intensional definition of rhetoric;\nindeed most leading rhetorical thinkers since Aristotle follow him in thus\ndefining rhetoric as argument concerned with social decision or action,\n\u201ccivic issues,\u201d etc., as documented in Kock (2009).\nThis demarcation of rhetoric, I contend, is more to the point\u2014\nhistorically and theoretically\u2014than the many current demarcations that\nemphasize the \u201ccontingent,\u201d the \u201cprobable,\u201d etc., as for example in\n54 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\nBrockriede & Ehninger (1960), the paper that initiated the use of Toulmin\u2019s\ntheory in the teaching of argument:\nWhereas in traditional logic arguments are specifically designed to\nproduce universal propositions, Toulmin's second triad of backing,\nrebuttal, and qualifier provide, within the framework of his basic\nstructural model, for the establishment of claims that are no more than\nprobable. (p. 46)\nTo be sure, there are \u201cbroader\u201d definitions of rhetoric which do not see\nrhetoric as rooted in any particular domain of issues, e.g., in Quintilian and\nin Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric (1776); the latter defines rhetoric (or\nrather, eloquence) as \u201cthat art or talent by which the discourse is adapted to\nits end.\u201d This is also a meaningful demarcation and aligns well with how\nrhetoric is defined in many academic programs (including the one this\nwriter is affiliated with at the University of Copenhagen). So my insistence\nthat Aristotle defines rhetoric as linked to \u201cthings on which we deliberate\u201d\nis not an endorsement of this definition, which is indeed quite restrictive;\nrather, I point to it because it is often overlooked, and mainly because it\nbrings out Aristotle\u2019s insistence on the differences between epistemic and\npractical reasoning\u2014to which I think we should pay more attention.\nIt is worth repeating that what Aristotle does is to distinguish between\nthe domain where we ultimately discuss truth, and the domain where we\nultimately discuss choice. In his view, there is a domain where there is no\n\u201ctruth\u201d to find, but there are also domains where truth does exist and can\neither be found, or where at least the best attainable degrees of probability\nmay serve in its stead.\nSo, if we follow Aristotle, it is clear that we should not theorize about\nargumentation as if all claims people may argue about are claims about\nsomething being true. Some claims, for example, are claims for a deliberate\nchoice, a proairesis. And a proairesis is not a proposition expressing a\nbelief or an opinion (doxa). The Eudemian Ethics in particular makes that\nclear:\nChoice is not an opinion either, nor, generally, what one thinks; for the\nobject of choice was something in one\u2019s power and many things may be\nthought that are not in our power, e.g. that the diagonal is\ncommensurable. Further, choice is not either true or false [eti ouk esti\nproairesis al\u0113th\u0113s \u0113 pseud\u0113s]. Nor yet is choice identical with our\nopinion about matters of practice which are in our own power, as when\nwe think that we ought to do or not to do something. This argument\napplies to wish as well as to opinion. (1226a)\n55 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\nOnce this is clear, it seems to me to terminate the old dispute between\nwhat we might call hardcore \u201cPlatonists\u201d and other thinkers we might call\nhardcore \u201cProtagoreans\u201d: both are wrong. Hardcore Platonists are wrong in\nthinking that a truth exists and can be found (through dialectical/pseudo-\nmathematical reasoning) on any kind of issue. Hardcore \u201cProtagoreans\u201d\n(and many contemporary thinkers, including some \u201cdiscourse\u201d theorists and\nsome \u201csocial constructivists\u201d) are wrong in thinking that on no kinds of\nissue does a truth exist.\nAristotle\u2019s distinction might also help \u201csolve\u201d (or dissolve) the old\nantagonism between (some) champions of rhetoric and philosophy,\nrespectively: since rhetoric is (centrally, \u201cultimately\u201d) not concerned with\n\u201ctruth,\u201d but with (social) choice, there is no reason why philosophers should\nsuspect rhetoric per se of subverting, or unconscionably disregarding, truth;\nrhetoric is not about truth. To be sure, it relies on the giving of reasons that\nmay be true or false, or at least probable or improbable; but that for which\nthe reasons are given is not an assertion that may be true or false.\nIncidentally, rhetoricians should realize that not all philosophers believe, in\nPlatonic fashion, that every issue is about the truth of some assertion.\nBut why is it that choice is neither true nor false? This question may be\nelucidated with reference to a few distinctive features of the way we reason\nabout deliberate choice. Not all of these features, I should add, are\ndiscussed by Aristotle; some of the insights I am going to cite are drawn\nfrom other thinkers, and some nuances I wish to add on my own.\n1) Although deliberate choice of some action is based partly on\nepistemic beliefs (as we just saw), it is never based only on epistemic\nbeliefs, i.e., beliefs about what is true or probable, but also on inner\nattitudes in the choosing individual; these attitudes, since they are located in\nthe individual, may in that sense be termed \u201csubjective.\u201d Some of them are\nethical and are discussed by Aristotle in the pertinent works on ethics;\nothers are emotions, path\u0113, discussed primarily in the second book of the\nRhetoric. It is worth recalling here that the theory of emotions set forth\nthere sees an emotion as having two components: (a) an affective one and\n(b) an epistemic one (cf. Fortenbaugh 1970 and later writings). The second\nbook of the Rhetoric defines a series of emotions (path\u0113) in such a manner;\nfor example, anger is defined as follows: \u201cAnger may be defined as (a) a\ndesire accompanied by pain, for a conspicuous revenge for (b) a\nconspicuous slight at the hand of men who have no call to slight oneself or\none\u2019s friends\u201d (1378a).\n2) These \u201cattitudes\u201d of both kinds, besides being individual, are graded, i.e.,\nthey come in any number of degrees. That is to say, someone\u2019s allegiance to\n56 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\na certain ethical value may be more or less strong, by any number of\ndegrees, compared to his or her allegiance to other values that may, in a\ngiven case, contradict it. Similarly, the emotion, e.g., anger, that motivates\nan individual to a certain action, may be more or less strong compared to\nthe factors that prompt that individual to desist from the action.\n3) As the previous point indicates, plural values are involved, even for an\nindividual: each of us believes in a plurality of values that often collide, that\nis to say, speak for contradictory decisions on specific issues. This\nrecognition is tantamount to the meta-ethical belief often named \u201cvalue\npluralism,\u201d associated with thinkers like Isaiah Berlin.\nAristotle\u2019s account of practical reasoning as interpreted by Anthony\nKenny (1979) may help us further understand this plurality/pluralism that\nmakes it impossible to infer the \u201ctrue\u201d answer to a question of choice. Put in\nsimple terms: an action that promotes one value or good probably\ncounteracts another.\nKenny explains how in all practical reasoning, as Aristotle sees it, we\nargue as it were backwards; that is, we start with a certain goal, value or end\nthat we want to promote, for example, health; given that the end is good, we\nlook for a means to bring about that end, because that means will also, in\nthat respect, be good. Thus, if health is the end, it follows that what brings\nhealth is also good, and since exercise is something that brings health, it\nfollows that exercise is good. So, to speak generally, we look for steps in\nreasoning that will transfer or preserve goodness from the end to the means.\nIf we compare this kind of reasoning with reasoning about propositions,\nwe see that there we look for steps in reasoning that will preserve truth. For\nthat purpose we need truth-preserving rules, whereas in practical reasoning\nwe need \u201cgoodness-preserving\u201d rules. But these two kinds of rules are quite\ndifferent. Kenny points out that whereas Aristotle himself managed to\nformulate truth-preserving rules for propositions, he did not even try to\nformulate a parallel set of goodness-preserving rules for practical reasoning;\nnor has anyone else attempted to do so. The reason is that practical\nreasoning is much more complicated, and so are the goodness-preserving\nrules that would be required to codify it. Because practical reasoning works\nas it were backwards from the desired end or effect or good to an available\nmeans, whereas reasoning about propositions works forward from the truth\nof one proposition to the truth of another that follows, the following applies:\nIf a proposition is true, then it is not also false; but if a project or\nproposal or decision is good, that does not exclude its being also, from\nanother point of view, bad. Hence, while truth-preserving rules will\n57 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\nexclude falsehood, goodness-preserving rules will not exclude badness.\n(Kenny 1979, p. 146)\nThis explains why, for a given choice we face that asks us to either\nundertake a given action or desist from it, there usually is no one \u201ctrue\u201d\nchoice. For example, we may consider undertaking a given action because\nwe believe it will promote a certain ethical good that we wish to promote;\nbut any action that promotes one good or value tends to counteract others.\nThis state of affairs is brought out in figure 1\u2014a diagrammatic rendition of\ncertain aspects of Aristotle\u2019s theory of the will, relying in part on Kenny.\nFigure 1. The logic of practical reasoning illustrtated\nCircles illustrate goals\nRectagles illustrate available means\nTriangles illustrate unavailable means\nA bold arrow means: promotes a goal\nA dotted arrow means: counteracts a goal\nWhat we see here is, first, that we all endorse a plural set of values or\nends (the circles). Certain actions might be imagined that would simply\npromote one or more of these goods without counteracting any; but such\nactions are generally unavailable. As a banal illustration of this, no state can\ndecide to spend some of its wealth on building a beautiful opera house and\nyet retain the same amount of wealth to spend for other worthy purposes.\nWealth that does not diminish when spent is, alas, not available. But a\n58 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\ncertain amount of wealth of the ordinary kind is often available, besides\nother means for achieving the ends we endorse. Another means available to\nmost states is warfare; it might bring about some benefit, but it certainly has\ncosts, e.g., in human lives, thus counteracting the common end of\npreserving human lives. Thus any action will have good and bad\n(presumptive) effects, or in different terms, advantages and drawbacks. And\nthat just accounts for the foreseen consequences of that action. A different\nset of considerations might concern deontic principles that it might either\nembody or violate, e.g., a principle that the taking of human lives is per se\nwrong.\nThus it is clear that any action has any number of straight as well as\ndotted arrows emanating from it towards goods (values, goals) that it is seen\neither to promote or counteract. The facts that any individual\u2019s set of these\nvalues/goals is (1) in principle subjective (although to a large extent\nshared), (2) graded, and (3) plural, together ensure that, as a standard case,\nno one incontrovertible choice presents itself, nor does anything that we\nmight, even in a derived sense, call the \u201ctruth.\u201d\nThe main theme in what I have said so far is what we might call the\ninevitable plurality and, indeed, multidimensionality of the ends, goods, or\nvalues (in Toulmin\u2019s terms it would be \u201cwarrants\u201d) that are potentially\nrelevant in deliberation (and hence in its subdivisions: ethical and rhetorical\nreasoning). There is not just one kind of value that should be attended to, as\nis the case in epistemic reasoning, where that value is truth value\n(substitutable, if need be, with probability value).\nBefore moving on to how Aristotle might illuminate the interrelations\nbetween rhetoric, ethics, and politics, we may pause to comment on the\nquestion of whether Aristotle himself is a \u201cvalue pluralist.\u201d There has been\nmuch debate on this between philosophers, with, among others, Martha\nNussbaum (1986) on the \u201cpluralist\u201d side and Charles Larmore (1996) on the\n\u201cmonist\u201d side. Aristotle does not declare himself a pluralist, in fact he says\nthat there is a supreme ethical value that dominates all others, namely\nphilosophical contemplation (Nicomachean Ethics 1177b); but on the other\nhand his ethical theory does analyze several distinct ethical qualities, and\nhis famous theory of the golden mean (to meson) can be seen as a theory\nwhere two potentially contradictory values must be balanced. For example,\ncourage is analyzed as a mean between bravery that sets aside fear and\nprudence that seeks self-preservation (1115a ff.); both are ethically good if\nnot driven to excess, so true courage is a mean between them. Another\ninstance of Aristotle reasoning in a way that arguably is de facto pluralist\n59 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\noccurs at the opening of the Politics; there he suggests a plurality of\n(intrinsic) values that humans, unlike animals, are committed to:\n\u2026 whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is\ntherefore found in other animals (for their nature attends to the\nperception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one\nanother, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the\nexpedient and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust.\nAnd it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and\nevil, of just or unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings\nwho have this sense makes a family and a state. (1253a)\nSince, as humans, we both understand what is beneficial vs. harmful,\nand also what is just and unjust, we can indeed be said to have at least two\nmutually independent goals or ends to guide us in our choice of action; and\nthen the argument made above on the multidimensional and pluralistic\nnature of our practical reasonings will apply.\nSo there is in Aristotle, as in ancient rhetoric generally, a realization that\nin deliberation about choice several heterogeneous (or we might say,\nincommensurable) values or ends will inevitably be intertwined. That goes\nfor reasoning in ethics as well as in rhetoric, where (as we saw above) we\nreason together about the collective decisions of the polity.\nChristopher Lyle Johnstone is one of the first, and still one of the few,\nphilosophers who have tried to relate the Ethics, the Rhetoric and the\nPolitics to each other. He would have it that in these reasonings in the\npolity, ethical values are somehow supreme; \u201cmoral truths\u201d of a communal\nkind, he argues, are amalgamated out of individual moral visions through\nthe agency of rhetoric:\nThe deliberative functions of rhetoric identify it as the instrument\nwhereby individual moral visions are shared, modified, and fused into\nthe communal moral principles that regulate our shared undertakings.\nOut of individual knowings we create communal moral truths; rhetoric is\nthe instrument of that creation. (1980, p. 17)\nI would argue that Johnstone\u2019s view of the workings of rhetoric in society,\nas expressed here, is too idealistic. Aristotle is more of a realist, some\nwould say more of a believer in Realpolitik. To be sure, he has succinctly\ndefined and comprehensively analyzed ethical reasoning; but he has not\nsaid that rhetorical reasoning is identical with ethical reasoning. On the\nother hand, nor has he said that ethical reasoning has no place in rhetorical\nreasoning. Rather, the broad picture of his thought on rhetoric, ethics and\n60 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\npolitics is that rhetorical deliberation in the polity is, and has to be, a jumble\nof individuals\u2019 self-interest, the collective self-interest of the polity,\nconsidered in terms of presumptive consequences, ethical and legal\n(deontic) principles, and all sorts of other considerations. It is, to use the\nterms employed above, pluralistic and multidimensional.\nThe few scholars who, after Johnstone, have attempted to correlate in a\nmore systematic way Aristotle's theories of rhetoric, ethics, and society,\nhave been less prone than he was to equate rhetoric with the creation of\n\u201cmoral truths.\u201d One of these scholars is the political theorist Mary P.\nNichols, who emphasizes how public deliberation, i.e., rhetoric, fuses\nprivate interests with considerations of the collectively advantageous as\nwell as the just:\nBy recognizing the heterogeneity of common opinion and trying to\nincorporate that heterogeneity into a consistent whole, the rhetorician\narrives at a comprehensive position that is both rooted in common\nopinion and able to go beyond common opinion. He is restrained by the\nindividuals whom he addresses at the same time that he is able to\neducate them. \u2026 It is the existence of a public realm of discourse that\nmakes man\u2019s political life more than the conflict of private interests and\npassions, that allows cities that come into existence for the sake of mere\nlife to become associations in which men share speech about the\nadvantageous and the just. (1987, pp. 661-662)\nNichols cites, at this point, the same passage from the opening of the\nPolitics that was quoted above about logos as man\u2019s prerogative; and she\ngoes on to argue that the obligation of the deliberative rhetor to integrate\nand absorb self-interest in fact makes it a noble pursuit: \u201cParadoxically,\ndeliberative rhetoric is nobler and more statesmanlike than forensic not only\nbecause it aims at a general or public end but also because it must address a\ngreater variety of private interests and concerns\u201d (1987, p. 663).\nPublic rhetoric, Nichols also observes, which allows self-interest a\nchance to appeal to the population at large, contains in itself a safeguard\nagainst precisely the kind of selfish manipulation that Platonic critics expect\nfrom it; that safeguard is the fact that any instance of public rhetoric is\nrevelatory of the ethos of the speaker from the very first word. Thus ethotic\neffects constitute a reason to cultivate public rhetoric rather than to suspect\nit:\nAddressing the popular fear that the speech of a clever rhetorician might\nhide his ends, Aristotle calls attention to the extent that a man reveals\n61 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\nhimself in his speech. If a rhetorician is to be persuasive, he must show\nthat his advice is advantageous to his audience, that what he is praising\nis noble, or that he has justice on his side. In such cases, his premises,\nhis conclusions, and his examples all reveal his character. (1987, p. 665)\nAbove and elsewhere, I have emphasized the inevitability of plural\nvalues, and, as a corollary of that, of dissensus (cf. Kock 2007). So does the\npolitical scientist Triadafilos Triadafilopoulos: \u201cAristotle argues that\npolitical speech should bridge the gaps between the public and private\nspheres, passions and reason, individual interests and the common good,\nequity and law\u201d (1999, p. 742). That is to say, Aristotle shows us how to\nsteer a middle course, find a meson as it were, between rival conceptions of\nthe public sphere, namely those which see it, respectively, as all-out rivalry\nbetween entrenched interests, and as Habermasian communicative\nrationality:\nAristotle\u2019s fusion of reason, emotion, and performance also provides us\nwith a unique alternative to both agonistic and rational/deliberative\nconceptions of the public sphere ... Deliberative rhetoric is unique in that\nit appeals both to the listener\u2019s private interests and the business of the\ncommunity. ... Orators on either side of a debate use persuasive speech\nto influence their audience\u2019s decision. ... Unlike Habermas, he rejects the\nclaim that truly universalizable norms can be apprehended\nintersubjectively through rational discourse. (1999, pp. 744ff.)\nGoing a step further, the political theorist Bernard Yack argues that the\nobligation of public deliberative rhetors to integrate appeals to advantage\nand self-interest with communal considerations is ennobling rather than\ndemeaning. For one thing, \u201cit rules out explicitly self-serving arguments\u201d\n(2006, p. 422). Other recent political theorists, including John Dryzek\n(2000, 2010), have argued along similar lines for the place of deliberation\nand rhetoric in democracy. That is, although we all have our own interests\nat heart as one strong motivating force, we still know and expect that in\npublic rhetoric the appeal should be to the public interest.\nSuch a mixed, pluralist, multidimensional view of political deliberation\ngoes against certain influential paradigms in political science and\neconomics. Among these are the so-called \u201cRational Choice\u201d theories, and\nsimilarly a close relative of these, namely the \u201ceconomic theory of\ndemocracy\u201d of Anthony Downs (1957). Regarding the forces that motivate\npoliticians and citizens alike, Downs (like the Rational Choice theorists,\namong whom he may or may not be counted) holds one-track, pseudo-\nphysical theories. As to what motivates political parties this theory claims:\n62 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\n\u2026 political parties in a democracy formulate policy strictly as a means\nof gaining votes. They do not seek to gain office in order to carry out\ncertain preconceived policies or to serve any particular interest groups;\nrather they formulate policies and serve interest groups in order to gain\noffice. Thus their social function\u2014which is to formulate and carry out\npolicies when in power as the government\u2014is accomplished as a by-\nproduct of their private motive\u2014which is to attain the income, power,\nand prestige of being in office. (1957a, p. 137)\nAs to what motivates citizens (voters), Downs\u2019s theory in its original pure\nform is equally categorical in its reliance on just one factor:\nBecause the citizens of our model democracy are rational, each of them\nviews elections strictly as means of selecting the government most\nbeneficial to him. Each citizen estimates the utility income from\ngovernment action he expects each party would provide him if it were in\npower in the forthcoming election period, that is, he first estimates the\nutility income Party A would provide him, then the income Party B\nwould provide, and so on. He votes for whatever party he believes would\nprovide him with the highest utility income from government action.\n(1957a, p. 138)\nThis attitude in citizens is what Downs and like-minded theorists see as\n\u201crational\u201d: \u201cWhenever we speak of rational behavior, we always mean\nrational behavior directed primarily to selfish ends\u201d (1957b, p. 27).\nWhat we can safely say is that Aristotle\u2019s thinking on rhetoric, ethics\nand politics presents a more complex picture than this, and one that I would\nargue is more realistic. He neither postulates the supremacy in public\ndeliberation of \u201cmoral truth\u201d nor that of crass self-interest, but explains how\nboth these kinds of motive, and the full spectrum in between, have roles to\nplay.\nAs for the role of self-interest and considerations of advantage as against\nethics, Yack makes clear that, unlike what is ideally the case in forensic\nreasoning (namely that only justice should determine any decision, as\nsymbolized by the blindfolded Lady Justice), deliberation on political\ndecisions has no right to completely disregard the interest of the members\nof the polity in the name of blind justice. Indeed, total abnegation of self-\ninterest on behalf of the collective would undercut a rhetor's ethos:\n\u201cImpartiality and disinterestedness recommend individuals to us as judges\nbut not as political deliberators, since deliberators are supposed to be\n63 Aristotle on Deliberation: Its Place in Ethics, Politics and Rhetoric\npondering our fate and theirs, not the disputes and interests of others\u201d\n(2006, pp. 423-424).\nThe function of a state according to Aristotle, as the opening of the\nNicomachean Ethics makes clear, is to secure for all its citizens the\n\u201cSupreme Good,\u201d and that is why the science of politics is the master-craft,\n\u201cthe most authoritative of the sciences.\u201d This also is why Aristotle lists\nrhetoric, along with \u201cdomestic economic and strategy,\u201d as \u201cone of the most\nhighly esteemed of the faculties\u201d in the state (1094a): rhetoric enables the\npolitical community to perform its essential function, which also provides\nits definition. In the words of Bernard Yack, the function of political\ncommunities is to serve \u201cour shared interest in establishing the conditions\u2014\nlaws, moral habituation, opportunities for the exercise of prudence, and the\nother virtues\u2014that make it possible to lead the Aristotelian good life\u201d (p.\n424).\nIt may be in place to sum up the main insights that we may gain by\npulling together Aristotle\u2019s thoughts on deliberation as expressed in his\nethical, political and rhetorical writings.\nFrom the ethical works, students of rhetoric may learn that if rhetoric is\nconcerned with such matters as we deliberate upon, then its central subject\nmatter is not the truth or probability of propositions, but actions that we\nmay choose to undertake. From Aristotle's Politics, rhetoricians may learn\nthat politics is the noble art of statecraft and that rhetoric should be proud to\nbe an integral and necessary part of it.\nEthics, in turn, might learn from rhetoric and politics that rhetorical\ndeliberation in the state is a distinctive human activity that is just as\nnecessary and worthy as the individual\u2019s deliberation over ethical choice, as\nwell as being more complex.\nPolitics, finally, might learn from ethics about the essential nature of\ndeliberation. From rhetoric it might learn about the specific workings and\nresources of this verbal praxis, so essential to the state\u2019s endeavor to secure\nthe good life for all.\nREFERENCES\nAristotle. 1991.

However, there is a scarcity of concepts in one part\nof Toulmin\u2019s theory of argument. While the pedagogical applications of\nToulmin\u2019s model offer a fine-grained system of warrant types for\npropositions (sign warrants, causal warrants, etc.), they have only one\ncategory of warrant for practical claims (proposals for action)\u2014the\n\u2018motivational\u2019 warrant. Fortunately, ancient rhetorical thinking can help us\ncorrect this insufficiency. For example, the author of the rhetorical textbook\nused by Alexander the Great proposed a typology of practical warrants. His\napproach highlights what I propose to call the \u2018multidimensionality\u2019, and\nhence what modern moral philosophers call the \u2018incommensurability\u2019 of\nwarrants\u2014the absence of a common measure allowing for a \u2018rational\u2019\nbalancing of conflicting warrants. The widespread occurrence of\nmultidimensionality in practical argument lends support to Toulmin\u2019s\ngeneral anti-rationalist view of reasoning. Moreover, while\nmultidimensionality prevents \u2018rational\u2019 balancing, it legitimizes and even\nnecessitates the use of rhetoric in practical reasoning.\nFor over 50 years, Stephen Toulmin has consistently argued that validity\nin reasoning comes in many forms dependent on field, function, and\ncontext. Just as energetically, he has argued that most of all these forms of\nvalidity are different, each in its own way, from the paradigm set up in the\n17th Century in the wake of Descartes\u2019 rationalism and Newton\u2019s universal\nmechanics\u2014the paradigm in which validity in reasoning meant geometrical\ncertainty, universality, and necessity. Toulmin\u2019s first book, An Examination\n* Originally published in Arguing on the Toulmin Model: New Essays on Argument Analysis\nand Evaluation, D. Hitchcock and B. Verheij (Eds.). Dordrecht: Springer 2006, 247-259.\nReprinted with permission of the Publisher. Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nof the Place of Reason in Ethics from 1950, was also his first to strike this\ntheme. Here, he argued that what constitutes good reasoning in the field of\nethics follows different rules than good reasoning in other fields, e.g.,\nmathematics, physics, or aesthetics. Indeed, reasoning in ethics is at least\ntwo separate things, both distinct in function and form.\nToulmin\u2019s fundamental insight into the multiform, non-universal and\nnon-necessary nature of validity in reasoning was inspired, no doubt, by the\nlater Wittgenstein\u2019s teaching at Cambridge. This insight, at any rate, is\nbound up with an unmistakably Wittgensteinian view of language, several\nyears before the actual publication of the later Wittgenstein's thinking, as in\nthis statement: \u201cSpeech is no single-purpose tool. It is, in fact, more like a\nBoy Scout\u2019s knife\u201d (Toulmin 1950, p. 83).\nThe idea that good reasons are many kinds of things, while anticipated in\n1950 and reiterated to this day, was stated in its most explicit form in The\nUses of Argument in 1958. The idea underlies the famous \u2018argument\nmodel,\u2019 whose centerpiece is the notion of \u2018warrant.\u2019 The main difference\nbetween Toulmin\u2019s model and traditional formal models, beginning with\nthe Aristotelian syllogism, is that warrants are not premisses about the issue\nin question but assumptions we rely on about the kind and degree of\nargumentative weight we may assign to the grounds offered. And the\nunderlying insight here is precisely that there are, depending on field and\ncontext, many kinds and degrees of argumentative weight.\nSo Toulmin\u2019s main point in introducing the notion of warrant is to\nhighlight the variety of ways and degrees in which the step from grounds to\nclaim may be justified. There is no one universal and timeless way in which\nreasoning takes place. From first to last, the main thrust of Toulmin\u2019s\nthinking about reasoning is against the assumed uniformity of warrants, and\nagainst the idea that reasoning in all fields of human reasoning proceeds\nfrom premisses to conclusions in a certain, deductive, and universal\nmanner. The relations between grounds and claims in human reasoning may\nbe warranted to varying degrees and in any number of ways; and, to adopt a\nphrase from Toulmin\u2019s latest book, Return to Reason, this is why we now\nneed to abandon the dream which ties \u201ccertainty, necessity, and rationality\ninto one single philosophical package\u201d (2001, pp. 205-206). This entrancing\ndream, the intellectual program of Modernity, as Toulmin calls it, sprang\nfrom seeds planted in the 17th Century in reaction against the rampant\nirrationality of the religious wars and in exultation over the triumphs of\nuniversalist, geometrical reasoning as demonstrated by Newton. Only in the\n69 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nlast decades, Toulmin argues, are Western intellectuals waking up from this\ndream.\nFurther, one might say that Toulmin is above all concerned with the\nepistemology and history of science, and his master insight is that even\nscience is not describable by the mathematical paradigm of certainty,\nnecessity, and rationality. There is no unitary Royal Road to certain\nknowledge of what is the case.\nThe centrality of this concern in Toulmin\u2019s thinking perhaps explains the\ncuriously subdued part played by practical reasoning, i.e., argumentation\nover political and social action, in most of his theoretical work. As shown\nby all his examples in The Uses of Argument (including the classic assertion\n\u201cHarry is a British subject\u201d), Toulmin's theory of argumentation tends to\ndwell on arguments over propositions, i.e., claims about what is the case,\nand it rarely looks at claims regarding policy, i.e., proposals for action,\nwhether in the political or the personal sphere. Toulmin\u2019s main concern is\nwith the epistemology of reasoning and hence with those fields primarily\nwhere the Rationalist paradigm has in particular made its seductive bid for\nsupremacy\u2014e.g., the sciences, economics, and philosophical ethics. That a\ngeometrical or Rationalist account of political argumentation is illusory is\nfar more obvious to most, even philosophers.\nThe fact that Toulmin in The Uses of Argument dealt so cursorily with\npractical reasoning may explain why the pedagogical applications of\nToulmin\u2019s model also have had little to say about it. Wayne Brockriede and\nDouglas Ehninger (1960) were the pioneers in using Toulmin's model as a\npedagogical tool. It is from them that we have the most common typology\nof warrants. They base it on the Aristotelian concepts of logos, ethos, and\npathos, respectively:\n(1) an arguer may carry data to claim by means of an assumption\nconcerning the relationship existing among phenomena in the external\nworld, (2) by means of an assumption concerning the quality of the\nsource from which the data are derived; and (3) by means of an\nassumption concerning the inner drives, values, or aspirations which\nimpel the behavior of those persons to whom the argument is addressed.\n(1960, p. 48)\nArguments of type (1) are called substantive, of type (2) authoritative,\nand of type (3) motivational. Of these main types, only substantive\narguments are further subdivided\u2014by means of a \u201ccommonly recognized,\u201d\nsix-fold ordering that includes arguments based on cause, sign,\n70 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\ngeneralization, parallel case, analogy, and classification. No further\ndistinctions are introduced concerning \u201cauthoritative\u201d or \u201cmotivational\u201d\narguments. Instead, Brockriede and Ehninger cross-tabulate the types they\nhave defined with a typology of claims based on the ancient stasis system,\nwhich renders four categories: designative claims (whether something is),\ndefinitive claims (what something is), evaluative claims (of what worth it\nis), and advocative claims (what course of action should be pursued). The\nresulting table shows, among other things, that \u201cmotivational\u201d arguments\nare applicable only to evaluative and advocative claims. Conversely, about\nthe warrants that may be invoked in support of advocative claims, we only\nlearn that they are motivational.\nThe net result is that in the applications of Toulmin\u2019s model to the\nteaching of argument there is a surprising shortage of concepts to describe\nwarrants relevant to advocative claims, i.e., practical reasoning. The solitary\nterm \u201cmotivational\u201d is little help, in fact it might mislead us into thinking\nthat only pathos appeals have a role here, or even that their only role is\nhere.\nThis omission is serious not only because it keeps us from understanding\nthat there are different types of \u201cmotivational\u201d warrant. Even more, it is\nserious because if we do not understand and consider the variety of warrant\ntypes invoked in arguments about action, neither do we understand why\nthese arguments so often involve the amount of controversy that they do,\nand why they necessarily involve rhetoric rather than geometrical\ndemonstration.\nThis neglected reason for the \u2018rhetorical\u2019 rather than demonstrative or\nrational nature of practical argument has to do with what I have proposed to\ncall the multidimensionality of such arguments (Kock, 2003). The main\nreason why we should distinguish between types of motivational warrants is\nthat these belong to different dimensions; and this fact again explains why\npractical arguments are the province of rhetoric, not demonstration.\nThe point in choosing the term \u201cdimensions\u201d for different types of\nwarrant is that dimensions are not reducible or translatable to one another;\nfor the understanding of a multidimensional complex, each dimension is\nnecessary.\nThe issues that cluster around the notion of multidimensionality have\nbeen discussed by philosophers for the last 25 years or so under other\nheadings such as incommensurability and incomparability.\n71 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nPerhaps the most articulate and convincing spokesman for the notion of\nincommensurability in recent years has been Joseph Raz. He defines the\ncondition of two reasons for action being 'incommensurate' in the following\nway:\nTwo competing reasons (for specific actions on specific occasions) are\nincommensurate if and only if it is not true that one defeats the other, nor\nthat they are of equal strength or stringency. They are incommensurate\nin strength, that is, reason does not determine which of them should be\nfollowed, not even that there is equal reason to follow either. When\nreasons are incommensurate, they are rendered optional, not because it is\nequally good (or right or reasonable) to choose the option supported by\neither reason, but because it is reasonable to choose either option (for\nboth are supported by an undefeated reason) and it is not unreasonable or\nwrong to refrain from pursuing either option (for both are opposed by an\nundefeated reason). (2000, pp. 102-103)\nRaz sees his position, including his belief in the widespread occurrence\nof incommensurate reasons, as an instantiation of what he calls a \u201cclassical\u201d\nstance, as against a \u201crationalist\u201d one. Interestingly, then, Raz joins Toulmin\nin the ranks of the self-styled anti-rationalists. There are, according to Raz,\nthree crucial differences between the two conceptions:\nFirst, the rationalist conception regards reasons as requiring action,\nwhereas the classical conception regards reasons as rendering options\neligible. Second, the rationalist conception regards the agent\u2019s own\ndesire as a reason, whereas the classical conception regards the will as\nan independent factor. Third, the classical conception presupposes the\nexistence of widespread incommensurabilities of reasons for action,\nwhereas the rationalist conception, if not committed to complete\ncommensurability, is committed to the view that incommensurabilities\nare relatively rare anomalies. The three differences come down to a\ncontrast between the rationalist view that generally rational choices and\nrational actions are determined by one\u2019s reasons or one\u2019s belief in\nreasons and are explained by them, as against the classical conception\nthat regards typical choices and actions as determined by a will that is\ninformed and constrained by reason but plays an autonomous role in\naction. (2000, pp. 47-48)\nTo simplify, what characterizes the \u201crationalist\u201d is his belief that reasons\nfor one action are necessarily stronger than those for another, and hence\n\u201crequire\u201d or \u201cdetermine\u201d that particular action. Raz, like Toulmin, is\nsceptical of such determinism. As we saw, the crucial insight in Toulmin is\n72 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nhis rejection of necessity and certainty in human reasoning. And that, in\nToulmin, goes for human reasoning of all kinds, not just for moral or\npractical reasoning.\nBut Raz, I suggest, has insights that might supplement Toulmin\u2019s. This\nis because he is more consistently concerned than Toulmin with the\nparticular complexity inherent in practical reasoning as a result of the\nsimultaneous presence of incommensurate reasons. To go a step further, I\nsuggest that the main reason to reject necessity in practical reasoning is not\nthe epistemic complexity of any individual single warrant (this is the issue\nthat has always been Toulmin's central concern), but the\nmultidimensionality and hence incommensurability (Raz\u2019s main concern) of\nthe set of warrants that may be invoked in each case.\nIt should be noted here that the multidimensionality and\nincommensurability we are talking about here is not the same concept as the\nincommensurability that Thomas Kuhn pointed to in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions in 1962. What Kuhn meant was the inability of two\ncompeting epistemic paradigms to accommodate each other\u2019s viewpoints\u2014\nthe kind of incompatibility that, according to Kuhn, would precede a\nscientific revolution. Instead, what we are talking about here is the issue\nthat has been a constant concern of moral philosophers at least since it was\nhighlighted by James Griffin in the article \u201cAre There Incommensurable\nValues?\u201d (Griffin, 1977). It is the problem that may arise for anyone facing\na practical decision because a certain value or warrant argues for a certain\naction A, whereas another value or warrant, incommensurate with the first,\nargues against A. As a paradigmatic example, we might cite the British\ndebate over fox-hunting, where the \u201ccruelty to animals\u201d argument against\nthis practice relies on a bio-ethical warrant, whereas pro-fox-hunting\narguments rely on economic and social warrants about livelihood and\n\u201challowed traditions.\u201d Or again, there is the ongoing debate in many\ncountries over criminal legislation; here left-wingers rely on a social utility\nwarrant when they point out that severe punishments are costly and do not\nprevent crime, whereas right-wingers tend to rely, among other things, on a\n\u201cjustice\u201d warrant in demanding that victims\u2019 sentiments be respected.\nIn each of these two exemplary issues, incommensurate warrants are at\nplay. In both cases, both sides have arguments that carry some weight. The\nproblem is one of deliberation\u2014a word that etymologically means the\nweighing of alternatives against each other on a scale. To decide which\nalternative has the weightier arguments in its favour, one would seem to\nneed one common measure or warrant that could put the grounds arguing\n73 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nfor the two alternatives on a common denominator and calculate the net\nresult in a deductive, i.e., necessary way. No such common denominator\nexists, and, as I have tried to show elsewhere (Kock, 2003), no matter how\none would try to define it, it would involve arbitrariness and hence not be\nnecessary.\nYet numerous philosophers beginning with Plato have felt the need for\nsuch a common measure and have suggested what it might be. Martha\nNussbaum in Love\u2019s Knowledge has discussed the Greeks\u2019 need for such a\n\u2018value monism\u2019 that reduces all values, whether physical beauty, scientific\ntruth or moral goodness, to one and the same, thus saving humans from\nfacing the disturbing complexities of ethical and practical decisions.\nToulmin himself has pointed to the distinctly mathematical inspiration\nbehind Plato\u2019s epistemology and ethics (2001, 18-19). Against the Platonic\nmonism Nussbaum sets Aristotle\u2019s belief that each virtue and good is a\nparticular thing, so that in regard to \u201chonor, wisdom, and pleasure, just in\nrespect of their goodness, the accounts are distinct and diverse\u201d\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1096b). But the monistic urge in philosophy has been\nstrong, as witness, e.g., John Stuart Mill\u2019s belief in the necessity of setting\nup utility as an \u201cumpire\u201d in the clashes between incompatible moral\ndemands:\nIf utility is the ultimate source of moral obligations, utility may be\ninvoked to decide between them when their demands are incompatible.\nThough the application of the standard may be difficult, it is better than\nnone at all: while in other systems, the moral laws all claiming\nindependent authority, there is no common umpire entitled to interfere\nbetween them; their claims to precedence one over another rest on little\nbetter than sophistry, and unless determined, as they generally are, by\nthe unacknowledged influence of considerations of utility, afford a free\nscope for the action of personal desires and partialities. (Utilitarianism,\nCh. 2)\nHowever, in spite of all such attempts, a growing number of moral\nphilosophers nowadays are convinced, like Raz, that incommensurability\nand hence optional choices, rather than required choices, are a condition of\nour moral and practical life.\nBut what that means is only that there is no necessary, deductive and\ncertain algorithm telling us what is required when a moral or practical\nchoice has grounds that argue for different actions and invoke different\nwarrants or values. However, the existence of incommensurability and\noptional choices does not mean that we do not weigh alternatives and make\n74 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nchoices. We do make choices, and we do so because we have debated\nreasons and weighed them against each other. Only we do not have a\ncommon measure or umpire that will render an indisputable, algorithmic\nverdict, in the way that a pair of scales renders an objective, physical\nverdict as to which scale has most weight on it.\nThis description of the situation for anyone faced with a choice between\nincommensurate reasons is similar to the description faced by Cha\u00efm\nPerelman when, in concluding his project De la justice in 1945, he realized\nthat he could find no rationally binding justification of the values\nunderlying human laws. When Perelman found that such a value\nrationalism was not viable, he did not, as is well known, opt for complete\nscepticism or relativism. Instead, he acknowledged that people do in fact\nargue about the values they cannot prove. And he decided to investigate\nhow they argue.\nThis, as is also well known, led to his \u201cre-discovery\u201d of rhetoric.\nPerelman and Toulmin, in the same year, both made a pioneering case for\nthe claim that in most human matters no necessity or certainty is achievable,\nyet for precisely that reason argumentation is possible and indeed\nnecessary. But they both concentrated on the uncertainty of our reliance on\nany single warrant or value on which we wish to step from grounds to\nclaim; neither of them gave their full attention to the particular difficulty\ncaused by the simultaneous presence of several incommensurate values or\nwarrants.\nIt is a fact not often remarked upon that 1958, the year which saw the\npublication of both Perelman\u2019s and Toulmin\u2019s groundbreaking works on\nargumentation, was also the year in which Isaiah Berlin's thinking on value\npluralism was first fully articulated in his inaugural lecture at Oxford, \u201cTwo\nConcepts of Liberty.\u201d As in the case of Toulmin, Berlin\u2019s seminal idea\nsprings from a view that there is no single and universal criterion of\nmeaningfulness for all domains of human knowledge or science. But more\nexplicitly than Toulmin, Berlin takes his pluralist reasoning into the realm\nof ethics and politics, shaping (if not inventing) the notion of\nincommensurability.\nToulmin, of course, was not unaware of it. He had commented on the\ntype of quandary it presents as early as in Reason in Ethics:\nGiven two conflicting claims \u2026 one has to weigh up, as well as one can,\nthe risks involved in ignoring either, and choose \u2018the lesser of two evils.\u2019\nAppeal to a single current principle, though the primary test of the\n75 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nrightness of an action, cannot therefore be relied upon as a universal test:\nwhere this fails, we are driven back upon our estimate of the probable\nconsequences. (1950, p. 147)\nHere we have Toulmin\u2019s characteristic rejection of the universal\nsupremacy of any single principle, and we also have the understanding that\na weighing must take place. The appeal to a principle and the estimate of\nconsequences, by the way, are the two different types of reasoning in ethics\nthat may both be valid, depending on the situation. But what Toulmin does\nnot go into is the fact that the weighing of consequences will lack\ndeterminacy when the conflicting claims rest on warrants belonging to\ndifferent dimensions, e.g., honour and utility in the guises of, respectively,\nbio-ethics and livelihood.\nMany years later, Jonsen and Toulmin in The Abuse of Casuistry were\nacutely aware that humans may face moral problems \u201cbeyond the reach of\nuniversal principles and general theories, and require them to strike\nequitable balances between varied considerations in ways relevant to the\ndetails of each particular set of circumstances\u201d (1988, p. 306). \u201cAt any stage\nin the development of a people and culture, experience brings them to adopt\ncertain general opinions about the scope, force, and relative priority of\ndifferent kinds of moral considerations\u201d (p. 325). The crucial terms here,\nseen from our angle, are \u201cequitable balances\u201d and \u201crelative priority.\u201d\nSimilarly, as one of the main reasons for the difficulty of applying concepts\n\u201coutwardly\u201d to the world of concrete objects, Jonsen and Toulmin mention\nthat \u201cparallel arguments often point to different presumptions the practical\nimplications of which have to be reconciled\u201d (p. 327). However, even in\nthis work of practical ethics, by far the most attention is given to the other\nmain reason that mere principles are insufficient, the epistemic reason, i.e.,\nthe consideration that \u201cpresumptive conclusions can have \u2018certitude\u2019 only\nwhen the relevance of the concepts or terms involved is not in doubt\u201d (p.\n327).\nThis epistemic difficulty militating against determinism in reasoning\nclearly is and always was Toulmin's main concern. The paradoxical\nrequirement in practical decisions to strike a balance between warrants\nlacking a common measure is one that he does not explore in similar depth.\nIn An Introduction to Reasoning, the textbook that Toulmin co-authored\nwith Rieke and Janik (1979), we find fine-grained distinctions between\nwarrant types for factual propositions, very similar to those in Brockriede\nand Ehninger (sign warrants, causal warrants, etc.), but again there is no\n76 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\ncomparable attempt to distinguish between warrants for practical\n(advocative) claims.\nAncient rhetoric, however, had more to offer here. From its beginning in\nso-called sophistic teaching, rhetoric was centrally concerned with\nargument about action. We need only go to what is probably the very oldest\nextant textbook on rhetoric in the West, the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum, a\nwork whose author\u2014one Anaximenes\u2014we do not know, but which is\nbelieved to have been written for the rhetorical training of the young\nAlexander the Great.\nThis book has had a strange fortune in the history of rhetoric. We do not\nknow whether young Alexander actually used it, but we know that it has\nbeen either ignored or roundly condemned by commentators ever since. The\nclassicist Manfred Fuhrmann, for one, who edited a modern text of this\nwork, has also written an introduction to classical rhetoric in which he calls\nit \u201cradically relativistic,\u201d condemning its \u201cbarefaced opportunism\u201d and\n\u201ceely routine\u201d (1984, 29). The kind of teaching that brings down this abuse\non the author\u2019s head is exemplified in the following enumeration:\n\u2026 he who persuades must show that those things to which he exhorts\nare just, lawful, expedient, honourable, pleasant, and easy of\naccomplishment. Failing that, when he is exhorting to that which is\ndifficult, he must show that it is practicable and that its execution is\nnecessary \u2026 It is for these qualities \u2026 that those who seek to persuade\nor dissuade must look. (1421b)\nWhat hostile critics appear to feel about such advice is that the author is\ntelling us to claim indiscriminately that any proposal we advocate is all\nthese things. However, we may also read \u201cAnaximenes\u201d as saying that the\nfollowing are the warrants which are in fact invoked in arguing about\nactions. Such actions\u2014so arguments might go\u2014should be executed\nbecause they are one or more of the following:\n\uf0b7 just (dikaia)\n\uf0b7 lawful (nomima)\n\uf0b7 expedient (sympheronta)\n\uf0b7 honourable (kala) (a better translation than Rackham\u2019s might be\n'noble')\n\uf0b7 pleasant (h\u0113dea)\n\uf0b7 easy of accomplishment (rhaidia)\n77 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nWhere difficult actions are concerned, we may further invoke the warrants\nthat are:\n\uf0b7 practicable (dynata) and\n\uf0b7 necessary (anankaia)\nSuddenly, it becomes clear that what \u201cAnaximenes\u201d presents is an\ninventory of the warrants available for practical reasoning. In arguing over\npractical issues, people essentially invoke warrants found in this list. They\ndo so because they have to. What alternatives can we cite that do not really\nfall under one of these headings? On the other hand, can any items be\nstricken from the list? Even if we did made minor corrections of that kind,\nwe still have here a helpful synopsis of the dimensions of practical\nreasoning. The point about dimensions, please recall, is that they are all\nnecessary; they are not reducible or translatable to one another. An action\nmay be \u201chonourable\u201d but not very \u201cexpedient;\u201d it may be \u201cjust,\u201d but not\n\u201clawful;\u201d etc. Even disregarding the epistemic uncertainty of applying these\nattributes \u201coutwardly\u201d to the world of concrete objects, we are still faced\nwith the second difficulty: that of weighing incommensurate warrants on\nthe same scale, for example, just so much \u201chonour\u201d against so much\n\u201cexpediency.\u201d We lack the common measure that will enable us to do this\nwith \u201ccertainty, necessity, and rationality.\u201d\nThis second difficulty undercutting rationality in practical reasoning has,\nI suggest, only had passing attention in Toulmin\u2019s work. It is this kind of\nincommensurability that Raz and other moral philosophers have explored.\nBut while Raz can thus be said to take his analysis a step further than\nToulmin, he too stops short. It is not enough to say that two competing\ncourses of action, relying on incommensurate reasons, are optional. It is true\nthat we cannot weigh them with certainty and necessity, as the rationalist\nwould; but we humans do weigh such options and make choices anyway.\nPerelman and \u201cAnaximenes\u201d are among the thinkers who have realized\nhow we do that. Since a number of incommensurate warrants may be\ninvoked, and since there is no logical or philosophical way to measure\nwhich one carries most weight in any given case, we are left with the\nresources of rhetoric to help us decide, or\u2014if that is our aim\u2014to win the\nadherence of others for a given choice. We cannot measure.\n\u201cDemonstration,\u201d to use Perelman\u2019s term, is not applicable; but rhetoric is.\n78 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nAmong the resources we can use to help us weigh alternatives whose\nweight cannot be measured are, according to \u201cAnaximenes,\u201d analogies,\nopposites, and examples. By emphasizing likenesses and/or differences\nbetween the action under consideration and other, paradigmatic ones, we\nmay bring ourselves and others to decide that the reasons arguing for that\naction are weightier than those arguing against.\nEssentially, the resources we are directed to here are the same that\nPerelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca found in the empirical project which\nbecame The New Rhetoric. Moreover, these resources constitute the method\nof \u201ccasuistry\u201d which Jonsen and Toulmin explored in their book, and which\nToulmin has in effect advocated from the start of his career. Instead of\nuniversal principles, casuistry deals in analogy or \u201cparallel arguments\u201d:\nPractical arguments, they state,\ndraw on the outcomes of previous experience, carrying over the\nprocedures used to resolve earlier problems and reapplying them in new\nproblematic situations ... the facts of the present case define the grounds\non which any resolution must be based; the general considerations that\ncarried weight in similar situations provide the warrants that help settle\nfuture cases...[and] so the resolution of any problem holds good\npresumptively; its strength depends on the similarities between the\npresent case and the precedents; and its soundness can be challenged in\nsituations that are recognized as exceptional. (1988, p. 35)\nBy 1988, Jonsen and Toulmin had realized that argumentation as they\nsee it and rhetoric are largely synonymous terms: \u201cPractical moral\nreasoning today still fits the patterns of topical (or \u2018rhetorical\u2019)\nargumentation better than it does those of formal (or \u2018geometrical\u2019)\ndemonstration\u201d (p. 326). But this was not always Toulmin\u2019s understanding\nof what the term \u201crhetoric\u201d means. As a philosopher, he seems to have been\ntaught that rhetoric is the strategic effort to win compliance in one\u2019s\naudience by any means; in Reason in Ethics the phrase \u201crhetorical force\u201d\nrefers to properties which are \u201cuseful in forwarding \u2026 particular policies\u201d\n(1950, p. 195). Only later does the insight gradually develop in Toulmin\u2019s\nwritings that rhetoric is more than the strategic promotion of one\u2019s interests;\nthat in fact rhetoric is legitimate and necessary in debating ethical and\ndeliberative issues.\nOne important reason why this is so, and one which\u2014had he considered\nit\u2014might have led Toulmin to embrace the term \u201crhetoric\u201d and the\nrhetorical tradition earlier, is precisely the multidimensionality of the\nwarrants invoked in practical argumentation and the resultant lack of a\n79 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\ncommon measure to help us decide which is the weightiest. Since no logical\ninference or calculation can tell us how incommensurate dimensions should\nbe weighted in deliberation, the result is that two opposite standpoints on a\ndeliberative issue may both be legitimate (or \u201coptional,\u201d as Raz has it); and\nthis again implies that the use of rhetoric to win adherence for one\u2019s\nstandpoint becomes not only legitimate but necessary.\nRhetoric comes into the picture not just because people want to sway\nand persuade each other but because people may legitimately have different\nviews of the same matter and prefer different courses of action. When\npeople use rhetoric to try to win each other\u2019s adherence, they do so not just\nbecause they want others to comply at any cost (this is the \u201cstrategic\u201d\ndefinition of rhetoric), but because they may be legitimately convinced that\nthe view they represent is not only an optional one but the preferable one;\nand their opponents may have the same legitimacy in thinking likewise of\ntheir standpoint. So rhetoric exists because it may be legitimate to hold\nseveral different views on a matter and because those holding each of these\nviews may legitimately wish to win the adherence of the others.\nPhilosophers have been slow to acknowledge, let alone explain, that this\nis so. Why it is so has to do, as I have tried to show, with\nmultidimensionality. This concept implies 1) that different warrants may be\ninvoked in a debate which are incommensurate with each other; and 2) that\ndifferent people, or the same person at different times, may assign different\nweights to arguments belonging to different dimensions.\nBoth these facts, again, have to do with the fact that on the one hand\nthere is no rational, necessary and certain way to weigh arguments invoking\nincommensurate warrants on the same scale; on the other hand people who\nhave to make practical decisions have to weigh them on the same scale\nsomehow. Rhetoric helps them do this, but not in a rational way, i.e., not in\na way that can pretend to be necessary and certain. So the existence of\nrhetoric helps explain how there can be, on the one hand, choices where no\none alternative is mandatory, yet where some people, on reasoning, find one\nalternative preferable and some the other.\nThis kind of situation is well known to us all, and the more thoughtful\ntextbooks on argumentation are aware of it as well:\nIn many ethical judgments, you and your audience might agree on\ncertain values, but not necessarily rank them in the same way. \u2026 most\nof the time weighting will be the crucial issue for your audience. People\nare quite likely to agree about the relevance of a set of criteria, but they\n80 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\noften disagree about which particular ones are most important in a given\nsituation. (Fahnestock and Secor, 2004, p. 249)\nRhetorical theory and textbooks ever since antiquity have been acutely\naware of the same fact. As the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum exemplifies, they\nhave been aware of the incommensurate warrants in practical\nargumentation, so that they can help us correct this scarcity of concepts in\none part of Toulmin\u2019s system. Also, they are aware of the means we still\nhave of weighing alternatives, including the topical tools of similarities,\ndifferences, and paradigmatic examples, as well as the numerous devices of\namplification and diminution, with the aid of which we may add to or\ndetract from the weight of any given argument.\nSuch a sophistic argumentation theory antagonized Plato and is still by\nmany seen as cynical, relativist and opportunist. Indeed, some of the major\nclassical rhetoricians, including Aristotle, did what they could to reduce the\nwarrants invoked in practical argumentation to one single dimension (that\nof expediency, sympheron, cf. Rhetoric, 1358b).\nHowever, the earliest rhetorical theorists, I suggest, had it right. They\nknew that practical reasoning has several dimensions, which is why\ndecisions cannot be found on a merely rationalist basis. For example, they\nwould have dismissed current pretensions to prioritize objectively between\npolicies for the improvement of the world\u2019s predicament on the basis of the\nsingle warrant of economic cost-benefit. Yet they did point to resources for\nreason to use where rationality fails. The type of multidimensional theory\nrepresented by the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum has, even now, a realism and\npractical applicability which argumentation theory, along Toulmin\u2019s lines\nor otherwise, would do well to attend to.\nSo, practical reasoning in situations characterized by\nmultidimensionality and incommensurability becomes the realm of rhetoric.\nSome might object here that while the displacement of the rationalist\nparadigm with its demand for universal and necessary forms of argument\ndoes open space for a conception of rhetoric as a legitimate mode of ethical\nand political inquiry, it also tempts rhetoricians to rush too quickly into this\nspace and lay claim to occupy more of it than they can justify. Instead of\nmaking the strong claims that the practical reason is the province of rhetoric\nand that rhetoric is necessary to it, should we not make the more modest\nand more easily sustained claim that rhetoric is one legitimate dimension of\npractical reason? Ethics, for one, would certainly seem to be another.\n81 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nA reply to this concern would be that while ethical considerations and\narguments undeniably are and should be involved in practical reasoning,\nincluding policy debates, that still does not imply that the part played by\nrhetoric is, by the same token, diminished. The two categories are not\nmutually exclusive. That is to say, we might perhaps define them so that\nthey are; but such a definition would be, as far as rhetoric is concerned,\nmisleading. Rhetoric, I suggest, should be understood as the totality of\nresources at the disposal of arguers who wish to increase adherence to their\nstandpoint in debates where choices are, as Raz has it, optional\u2019. They are\noptional because individuals may legitimately opt for one or the other.\nPhilosophy ends here, because philosophy is, by its very nature, about\nfinding solutions that hold with equal validity for all. Ethics, as a branch of\nphilosophy, is about answering ethical questions in ways that hold equally\nfor all.\nRhetoric, by contrast, is not about finding answers that hold equally for\nall. And rhetoric is not complementary to ethics (which would make the two\nmutually exclusive). Rather, rhetoric can be defined as the means we have\nto influence the standpoints of individuals on optional issues. They are\nusually optional because there is incommensurability involved. Ethical\nconsiderations may indeed enter into the rhetorical efforts of one individual\nto win the adherence of others, perhaps in conflict with other ethical\nconsiderations, or with considerations of, say, expediency. The point is that\non optional issues, individuals may opt differently, and be differently\ninfluenced, and even be moved to change their minds\u2014individually. All\nthis is what rhetoric is there to do. Philosophy can only state that\nincommensurability and the resultant optional issues exist\u2014a rather recent\nphilosophical insight that many philosophers still hotly deny, possibly\nbecause it seems to leave them at a dead end.\nBut the dead end is only apparent, an appearance caused by the\nphilosophical presumption to find solutions holding equally for all. The\nroad sign at this point might read, \u201cIncommensurability ahead.\u201d Beyond is\nthe realm of rhetoric. We can bring all our reasonings there, including\nethics. Thanks to rhetoric, we are not, even in that realm, stuck with\nunsolvable dilemmas. We may actually find solutions to the quandaries we\nmeet, and with rhetoric we can perhaps win the adherence of other\nindividuals for those solutions; but because of incommensurability, the\nadherence of individuals is all that our reasoning may achieve.\n82 Multiple Warrants in Practical Reasoning\nReferences\nAristotle. 1926.

However, Walton\u2019s attempt to model\npractical reasoning as presumptive is misguided. The notions of\n\u201cinference\u201d and of the burden of proof shifting back and forth between\nproponent and respondent are misleading and lead to counterintuitive\nconsequences. Because the issue in practical reasoning is a proposal, not a\nproposition, there are, in the standard case, several perfectly good reasons\non both sides simultaneously, which implies that argument appraisal\nnecessarily contains a subjective element\u2014a fact argumentation theory\nneeds to conceptualize.\nOne of many notions in argumentation theory that have received\ndeserved recognition thanks to the work of Douglas Walton is presumptive\nreasoning. Several items on his impressive list of publications deal with it\n(among them 1991, 1993, 1996a, 1997a, 2001). It means, as is well known,\na type of argumentation midway between assertion and assumption: in its\nbasic form, a proponent offers an argument for a claim, and this argument is\nseen as sufficient to shift the burden of proof to those who want to question\nthe claim: \u201cWith presumption then, the burden of (dis)proof lies on the\nrespondent, not on the proponent\u201d (Walton 1996, xii). The\nopponent/respondent must either (presumptively) accept the claim or rebut\nthe argument. Presumptive reasoning, thus conceived, creates a special kind\nof inference, different from both deductive and inductive inference, and\ncharacterized in particular by the shifting of the burden of proof. It is\n\u201cnonmonotonic\u201d and can be modeled with the calculus for \u201cplausible\nreasoning\u201d suggested by Rescher (1976). Other related concepts are\n\u201cdefault reasoning\u201d (as in Reiter 1980) and \u201cdefeasibility.\u201d Walton has\n* Originally published in Informal Logic 27 (2007), 91-108. Reprinted with permission of\nthe Editors. Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nshown that presumptive reasoning is widespread in real-life argumentation\nof any kind.\nBeside the burden-of-proof criterion, the other crucial component of\nWalton\u2019s theory of presumptive reasoning is the notion of argumentation\nschemes, with associated lists of \u201cCritical Questions,\u201d one list for each\nscheme. In presumptive reasoning a proponent basically advances a claim\nby using a certain recognized argumentation scheme; this shifts the burden\nof proof to the opponent, who should then take it upon himself to rebut or\ncriticize the argument by raising questions of the types specified for each\nargument scheme.\nWalton\u2019s work on presumptive reasoning is valuable, first, by\nhighlighting this notion itself and by demonstrating how widespread it is in\nreal-life discourse, and second, by compiling and exemplifying\nargumentation schemes. However, as Blair has argued, both the\n\u201cprovenance\u201d and the classification of Walton\u2019s schemes remain\nunaccounted for; \u201cWalton\u2019s list of schemes seems to drop from out of the\nblue\u201d (Blair 2001, p. 379). Third but not least, Walton\u2019s lists of \u201cassociated\u201d\ncritical questions constitute an immensely helpful resource for reasoning in\nseveral domains.\n1. Practical Reasoning\nThe point where I wish to challenge Walton\u2019s theory of presumptive\nreasoning is where its application to practical reasoning is concerned.\nWalton defines practical reasoning as \u201ca goal-driven, knowledge-based,\naction-guiding species of reasoning that coordinates goals with possible\nalternative courses of action that are means to carry out these goals, in\nrelation to an agent's given situation as he/she/it sees it, and concludes in a\nproposition that recommends a prudent course of action\u201d (1997b, p. 160).\nFurthermore, Walton repeatedly refers to \u201cthe two basic types of practical\ninferences,\u201d which are \u201cthe necessary condition scheme and the sufficient\ncondition scheme\u201d (1996a, p. 11; emphases in the original). In more recent\nversions, though, the \u201csufficient condition scheme\u201d (where the argument\nthat an action is a sufficient reason to carry out a goal creates the inference\nthat the action should be undertaken) seems to disappear, and the\nassumption seems to be that there is only one argumentation scheme of\npractical reasoning (e.g., Walton and Godden 2005, who repeatedly refer to\n\u201cthe practical reasoning scheme\u201d, as if there was only one, and meaning by\nthis the scheme where, if something is a necessary condition for realizing a\n86 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\ngoal, it creates a presumptive inference that this action should be\nundertaken).\nWhile doubting parts of the basic definition, I believe to be in harmony\nwith Walton in understanding practical reasoning as concerning action\u2014\neither about whether a given action (or policy) is to be undertaken by an\nagent, or about what action is to be undertaken. Practical reasoning\nconcerns decisions about actions that an agent contemplates, and which are\nin his or her power to undertake.\nMy claim is that for practical reasoning the presumptive model is\nmisleading. To put it in provisional terms, it is just not the case in practical\nargumentation that any argument for an action creates a presumptive\ninference that the action it supports should either be undertaken, or has\nsomething \u201cwrong\u201d with it. It is wrong to suggest that if not rebutted, such\nan argument is strong enough to immediately mandate the decision (albeit\nin a presumptive way); and it is just as wrong to suggest that if a pertinent\ncritical question is raised about the argument, then it is rebutted and as it\nwere dealt with.\nAn objection reminiscent of this has been made by Robert Pinto (2001,\n2003). Essentially, he claims that many of the \u201ccritical questions\u201d attached\nto the argumentation schemes have a purely heuristic, rather than a\nnormative force. Hence they \u201ccannot be used, as Walton says they can, to\nshift the burden of proof back to a proponent\u201d (Pinto 2001, p. 112). For\nexample, in the case of an Argument from Sign, when the critical question\n\u201cAre there any other events that would more reliably account for the sign?\u201d\nis raised by the respondent, then there is, according to Pinto, no burden on\nthe proponent to show that there are no such events; instead there is a\nburden on the respondent to identify one.\nI agree that critical questions do not automatically have the force to\ninitiate this tennis-like back-and-forth-volleying of the burden of proof. In\nfact, Walton has recently modified (and mollified) his earlier conception to\naccommodate this insight; in regard to whether a critical question is\nsufficient to make the argument default, or whether the burden is on the\nquestioner, he now finds that \u201cthis may be different for different critical\nquestions of a scheme\u201d (Walton, Prakken, and Reed 2004, p. 86; cf. also\nWalton and Godden 2005). However, my criticism is more fundamental. I\nreject the underlying notion introduced by the very idea of presumption: the\npurely \u201cbinary\u201d view where a party either carries a burden of proof or does\nnot, and where that burden is either incurred or shifted through\npresumption.\n87 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nSuch an implicit binarism is particularly misleading where arguments in\npractical reasoning are concerned. As I shall try to demonstrate with an\nextended example, in practical reasoning it is often legitimate, indeed\nnecessary, to speak of degrees of strength in arguments (or \u201cpremises\u201d); and\nfurthermore it is necessary to recognize that in practical reasoning the\ndegree of strength of premisses is, in the nature of the case, often assessed\nsubjectively and hence differently by individuals involved in the decision\nprocess.\nA first reply to this criticism could be that Walton recognizes practical\nreasoning as a distinct domain, and that the theory of presumptive reasoning\naccounts for counterarguments precisely by specifying appropriate critical\nquestions to be raised (1996a, p. 12).\nIndeed Walton, almost alone among the argumentation theorists today\nwho come from a philosophical background, does recognize practical\nargumentation as a separate domain (1990; 1996a, pp. 11-13, 176-180;\n1996b; 1997b). What many overlook is the simple fact that in practical\nreasoning people argue about an action, not about a proposition or assertion.\nYet Walton too, while alert to this difference, has often tended to blur it\neven while stating it. Commenting on a distinction between practical and\n\u201ctheoretical or discursive\u201d reasoning, he states: \u201cIn the action type of\ncritical discussion, the proposition is a practical ought-proposition that\ncontains an imperative\u201d (1996a, p. 177). This phrase is puzzling. Evidently,\nWalton senses that the issue in practical reasoning is not merely an \u201cought-\nproposition,\u201d and so he adds that it \u201ccontains an imperative\u201d\u2014thereby\ninventing a new hybrid. But is a proposition that \u201ccontains\u201d an imperative\nstill a proposition? Is an imperative not a wholly different kind of speech\nact? Apparently Walton, at this stage, cannot abandon the ingrained idea\nthat reasoning, and hence also practical reasoning, is about propositions.\nBut that for which we argue in practical reasoning is not a proposition about\nwhat we \u201cought\u201d to do, nor about what is \u201cprudent,\u201d although both these\nconsiderations (which are far from identical) may enter into the reasoning\nas premisses. The issue in practical reasoning is a proposal about what to do\n(a point I have contended, and whose implications I have tried to explore, in\nKock 2003a, 2003b, this volume, Chapter 6).\nFor the sake of clarity, let me state clearly that one of the distinctive\nfeatures of proposals vis-\u00e0-vis propositions is that proposals are not\ncognitive and hence do not have truth-values. Although not everyone shares\nthat view, I will not belabor it here, beyond an example that, in my estimate,\nmakes it obvious. Let us take the case of a president making a proposal for\n88 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nhis country to invade another country, say, Iraq. I do not see how what he\nproposes, invading Iraq, could possibly be true or false. It is an act, and acts\ndo not have truth-values; propositions do (or some of them). However, the\npremisses for the proposal (e.g., that Iraq has WMD\u2019s) may have truth-\nvalues. Also, the claim that the invasion will promote democracy in the\nMiddle East (another premiss) may have (or acquire) a truth-value. As for\nthe value-claim that democracy in the Middle East is a highly valuable good\nit is a moot point whether and how such statements may have truth-values.\nMy point is not dependent on how this question is answered. What I do\nclaim, among other things, is that acts, and proposals to undertake acts,\ncannot have truth-values; that instead they have a large and open-ended\nrange of properties, about all of which we may make propositions that may\nhave truth-values; that about all of these properties we may make value-\njudgments; that these may legitimately differ across individuals; and that for\nall these reasons decisions about acts and proposals cannot be \u201cinferred\u201d\nfrom the truth of any single proposition relating to them.\nHence, even to conclude that a proposed act would be \u201cprudent,\u201d\nhowever debatable that judgment itself might be, licences no \u201cinference\u201d to\nthe act itself. We may decide to do the \u201cprudent\u201d thing, but on the other\nhand we might not, for example because considerations of ethics, duty or\nhonor override \u201cmere\u201d prudence. Or again, prudent decisions may be\noverridden by motives such as desire for glory, thrills, or sexual pleasure.\nWhat this shows is the categorical difference between a proposition, which\nis the issue in theoretical/discursive reasoning, and a proposal, which is the\nissue in practical reasoning. This distinction Walton, while aware of\npractical reasoning as a separate domain, has repeatedly failed to formulate\nwith any clarity.\nIt should be said, in all justice, that recent work by Walton on practical\nargumentation (2006) does much to dissipate the fog generated by earlier\nformulations. He now recognizes that the issue in what he calls\n\u201cdeliberation dialogue\u201d is indeed a proposal, not a proposition, and that a\nproposal is a distinctive kind of speech act. He further presents a valuable\noverview of the criteria and critical questions that may be invoked in\ndeliberation dialogue and in the appraisal of it, and he discusses other\nhallmarks of deliberation or practical reasoning, such as its dependence on\nvalues and the simultaneous presence in it of relevant pro and con\narguments. But the fundamental notions of inference and presumption are\nstill not questioned, the implied binarism is still extant in them, and the\n89 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nmisleading and counterintuitive features of his \u201cpresumptive\u201d account of\npractical reasoning which I shall discuss below, remain.\n2. Walton's Inference Model\nAlthough Walton has moved towards clarity in accepting that\ndeliberation/practical reasoning is about proposals, not propositions, he still\nassumes that what we argue for in practical reasoning follows as a\nconclusion or inference from a properly applied argument scheme, the way\na proposition follows from its premisses by inference. In practice his\nrevised account does not contradict formulations found in the earlier\nversions such as these: \u201cIn a practical inference, the conclusion is an\nimperative that directs the agent to a prudent course of action\u201d (1996a, p.\n11); \u201cit concludes in an imperative that directs the agent to a course of\naction\u201d (1990, p. xi). Here we have, besides the notions of \u201cinference\u201d and\n\u201cconclusion,\u201d two additional residues from propositional logic, suggesting\nthe binding nature of this conclusion: it is an imperative, and it directs.\nWalton\u2019s model of practical reasoning, and hence also of how to evaluate\narguments in that domain, is still a wholehearted inference model.\nInference models of argumentation and argument evaluation (whether\ndeductive, inductive, presumptive or otherwise) may be likened to an\nelectrical circuit. In deductive inference, validity turns the switch on, and it\nstays on; if validity is absent, the switch is off and stays off. In non-\nmonotonic inference, there is a toggle switch which can turn the inference\non and off again. In the presumptive inference model the toggle switch\nturns a presumption of the inference on and off, while at the same time\nshifting the burden of proof back and forth. In all inference models, a given\nargument is evaluated in terms of whether it turns the inference on or not,\nand the switch only has two positions: on and off. This is tantamount to\nsaying that when you accept an argument in such a model, you are bound to\naccept the conclusion. There is a two-way bind between argument and\nconclusion, even when, as in presumption, it is possible to become unbound\nagain.\nIn such a model, in order for an argument not to turn the inference (or\ninference presumption) on, there has to be something \u201cwrong\u201d with the\nargument, and the critical questions associated with the argument schemes\nare there to help identify what may be \u201cwrong.\u201d Blair, in his critique of\nWalton's presumptive reasoning model, explicitly aligns presumptive\ninference with the deductive and inductive varieties; he refers to its\n90 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\n\u201cprobative force\u201d and \u201ccogency\u201d as if these terms were synonymous, and\nstates that for presumptive inference, \u201cto accept the premises and grant the\nvalidity of the inference using that scheme yet deny the plausibility of the\nconclusion, under the circumstances\u2014without suggesting that any\nconditions of rebuttal exist\u2014is pragmatically inconsistent\u201d (2001, p. 376).\nBlair criticizes Walton for not providing rationales explaining why each\nargumentation scheme is cogent, but implicitly accepts that what we should\nexpect of any argumentation is \u201ccogency.\u201d\n3. Why the Inference Model is Misleading\nThe inference model of practical reasoning is misleading because it is\nnot necessarily a defect in an argument used in practical reasoning that it\ndoes not authorize an inference. Walton\u2019s model, unquestioned in this\nrespect by Blair, rests on the erroneous assumption that in practical\nreasoning (as in any other kind of presumptive reasoning), an argument\neither turns the (presumptive) inference on, or it can be rebutted.\nAccordingly, the critical questions which form a central part of Walton\u2019s\ntheory are designed to rebut presumptive arguments, i.e., to throw the\nburden of proof back on the proponent. However, in practical reasoning an\nopponent of a proposal will not and should not necessarily doubt or rebut an\nargument proffered by the proponent; instead, he may fully acknowledge\nthe proponent\u2019s argument, but then present a counterargument which, in his\nview, speaks even more strongly against the proposal than the proponent\u2019s\nargument speaks for it.\nIt might be objected here that Walton\u2019s model anticipates the existence\nof such counterarguments, and it does so precisely in the form of critical\nquestions. The book version (1996, p. 13) lists the following kinds of\ncritical questions to be asked in practical reasoning about a proposed action,\nA, aimed by an agent, a, at realizing a goal, G:\nQ1: Are there alternative ways (other than A) of realizing G?\nQ2: Is it possible for a to do A?\nQ3: Does a have goals other than G that should be taken into account?\nQ4: Are there other consequences of bringing about A that should be\ntaken into account?\nThe first version of this list (in 1990, p. 85) makes no mention of \u201cother\ngoals.\u201d In a later, shorter version Walton gives a slightly expanded list\n(1997, p. 610; A is now the goal and B the action):\nAre there alternatives to B?\n91 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nIs B an acceptable (or the best) alternative?\nIs it possible to bring about B?\nDoes B have bad side effects?\nAre there goals other than A that need to be considered?\nThere is no denying that these are relevant questions to raise about any\nproposal, and they seem to categorize possible counterarguments against it\nwell. However, the problem is with the fundamental structure of the model,\nnot with the questions as such.\n4. Unreasonable Implications of the Inference Model\nIn the inference model, to adduce possible alternatives, other\nconsequences, and other goals serves to rebut the original argument and\nthus turn the \u201cpractical inference\u201d off. On this analysis, any argument for\nwhich any of the critical questions has an affirmative answer is relegated to\nthe \u201coff\u201d category, along with arguments that are palpably absurd and\nworthless.\nBut any practical argument for which, e.g., one of the questions Q1-Q4\ncan be answered affirmatively, is certainly not by that token worthless. In\npractical reasoning affirmative answers to several of the questions would be\nthe standard case. If nothing else, there will always, no matter what goal a\nproposal aims to promote, be \u201cother goals\u201d to take into account, since any\nperson in any society will entertain multiple other wishes, purposes or\nvalues which he wants promoted. Any proposal has costs in relation to\nsome of these other goals. For example, nearly every political action costs\nmoney, thus counteracting the \u201cgoal\u201d of preserving our common wealth\n(and also counteracting all the other goals we might spend money on). So at\nleast one of the critical questions Q1-Q4 has an affirmative answer even for\narguments that most people would find highly relevant, acceptable, and\nstrong.\nAlso, generally there would be no way to rebut these critical questions.\nProponents would have to admit, \u201cYes, there are other consequences; yes,\nthere are goals other than G to take into account.\u201d And there would\nprobably be alternative actions that might serve the same goal. So every\nsingle argument for any practical proposal would find itself relegated to the\n\u201coff\u201d category. Strangely, Walton seems to think this would be the\nexception, e.g.: \u201cPresumptive inferences ... are subject to withdrawal or\nrebuttal in exceptional cases\u201d (1996a, p. xi; emphasis added). Nevertheless,\nwhat the presumption model implies is, absurdly, that any proposal to do\n92 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nanything for the promotion of any goal should, by the lights of state-of-the-\nart argumentation theory, be abandoned.\nClearly, an appropriate model for practical reasoning should instead\nrecognize it as a characteristic feature of practical reasoning that there may\nbe legitimate, non-rebuttable arguments both for and against a proposal\u2014\narguments which would not necessarily contradict or refute each other. A\npro-argument, A, might be perfectly true, acceptable, and relevant, and at\nthe same time a con argument, B, might be so too; and yet they might not\ncontradict each other at all. The contradiction would only be between the\nproposals they were used to support.\nIn other words, an argument in practical reasoning may have nothing at\nall wrong with it, in the sense that there is nothing to criticize or rebut, and\nyet it may not create any natural presumption, directive or imperative to\nembrace the proposal it is used to support; conversely, in order to escape the\nburden of proof regarding a proposal, an opponent of it does not have to\ncriticize or rebut every argument supporting it.\nBut even for its unnaturalness, might not the presumptive model be\ndefended as a handy way of stating the standard argument types in practical\nreasoning? No, the model is not only awkward and unrealistic when applied\nto practical reasoning; it also has pernicious consequences, one of which is\nthe following:\nBecause the presumptive model implies that in order for a discussant to\nbe entitled to reject a proposal for which an argument is presented, he must\nrebut the argument, it follows that he must either give that proposal\npresumptive acceptance, or else rebut every single argument presented in its\nfavour.\nSuch compulsive refusal of recognition to opposing arguments is in fact\nwhat we witness daily in public debates or interviews with politicians as\nparticipants. Politicians and other public discussants routinely behave as if\nrecognizing any argument or any critical question from the opposite side\nwould create a cogent inference to the opponent\u2019s proposal; hence such\nrecognition must be avoided by any available means, including evasion,\ndistortion or blank denial. The social harm of this practice is that the public\naudience gets much less of a chance to critically assess the relative strengths\nof the case for, respectively against, the proposal under discussion.\n5. An Alternative Model\n93 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nA theory of political and other practical argumentation which recognizes\nthat there may be legitimate arguments on both sides of an issue would\ncounteract this tendency. It would make clear that there need not be\nanything wrong or questionable about an argument in practical reasoning,\nbut even so respondents (or voters) may be entitled to reject the proposal for\nwhich the argument is presented in support. On such a model, one may\nrecognize the merit of a (counter-) argument without underwriting a\npresumptive inference to the proposal for which it argues; one would not\nnecessarily reject the truth of the opponent\u2019s argument as such, nor its\nacceptability or relevance in support of the proposal, but the forced\npresumptive inference from recognition of the argument to acceptance of\nthe proposal.\nThe presumptive model, in contrast, instantiates the same misleading\nbinarism that inheres in other inference-based models of argumentation and\nargument evaluation. Either one accepts the argument and gets the inference\nto the proposal in the bargain; or, if one wants to reject the proposal, one is\ncompelled to reject the argument, together with any other conceivable\nargument for the proposal as well.\nRather than institutionalizing this dilemma, argumentation theory should\nstop basing argument appraisal in practical reasoning on the recognition of\nan inference from argument to \u201cconclusion\u201d \u2014deductive, inductive,\npresumptive or otherwise. In practical argumentation, even legitimate\narguments legitimate no inference to the proposal; instead they provide an\nimpact of a certain strength to a decision-maker\u2019s decision about that\nproposal.\nThe phrase \u201ca certain strength\u201d is crucial. A theory which is adequately\nto reflect practical reasoning must conceptualize the fact that in such\nreasoning the strength of arguments is a matter of degrees.\nIn present-day argumentation theory there is a certain consensus that the\ncriteria to be applied in argument evaluation can be formulated as\nacceptability, relevance, and sufficiency. This is the case in Informal Logic\n(see, e.g., Blair & Johnson 1987, Blair 1992, 1995; Johnson 2000 has\nacceptability, truth, relevance, and sufficiency); but the same trio is also\nfound in theory based on the pragma-dialectical framework (e.g.,\nHenkemans 2003) and in textbook literature, (e.g., Trapp, Driscoll et al.\n2005). We may speak of these three as the recognized dimensions of\nargument evaluation.\n94 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nIf argumentation theory is to conceptualize degrees of strength in\narguments, which of these dimensions would it affect, and how?\nAcceptability (and/or \u201ctruth\u201d) is, as it were, the epistemic dimension. As\nfor relevance, it has to do with the argument\u2019s conceptual or qualitative\ncorrectness, its having an appropriate application to the issue at hand. For\nboth of these dimensions, it is debatable whether and how a concept of\ndegrees might be applicable to them. Sufficiency, however, is by its nature\na quantitative, not a qualitative concept; it is about there being enough of\nsomething. In argument evaluation it says that there is enough acceptable,\nrelevant argumentation to cross a certain threshold. But \u201csufficiency,\u201d like\nthe other concepts in the triad, is a binary criterion. This is how it is used in\nmathematics, where, e.g., a condition is either sufficient, or it is not; there is\nno such thing as it being \u201csomewhat\u201d sufficient, or \u201cmore\u201d sufficient than\nanother condition. However, in practical reasoning arguments differ along\nthe quantitative dimension not just in a binary (on-off) way, but by degrees;\nwe have just seen the counterintuitive consequences of insisting on a purely\nbinary conception. Yet most philosophical argumentation theory lacks\ntheoretical tools to deal with degrees along the quantitative dimension.\n6. Degrees of Argument Strength and Subjectivity\nArguments are sometimes referred to as having a certain weight.\n\u201cPremiss weight\u201d has been suggested as a concept to be used in deductive\nlogic for uncertain premises (e.g., Adams et al., 1975). \u201cFuzzy logic\u201d (or\nmodels inspired by it) has spawned many attempts to conceptualize\nreasoning about concepts that \u201cdo not have crisp boundaries\u201d (Zadeh 1965,\np. 141).\nAnother precedent for using \u201cweight\u201d about arguments in practical\nreasoning is the \u201cset of scales\u201d metaphor, where arguments are seen as\nweights of varying mass, placed in the two scales. This metaphor has served\nthe judicial system in Western countries since the Romans. The idea is that\nany weight in one scale is merely one element in a larger act of deliberation\n(a word which means \u201cweighing on scales\u201d). Crucial to this metaphor is the\nfeature so characteristic of weight: it has degrees\u2014 the notion that is\nexcluded by inference models.\nThe notions of gradualism and of the aggregate totality of arguments are\nwell embodied by the \u201cscales\u201d image. But another implication of that image\nis less appropriate. Weight/mass, as a purely physical parameter, suggests\nthat there is an objective, physically determinable mass to any single\n95 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nargument\u2014and hence a possibility of determining, with precision and\nobjectivity, which scale outweighs the other.\nTrudy Govier makes just this point in a note on the idea of \u201cweighing\u201d\nreasons in the chapter on \u201cConductive Arguments and\nCounterconsiderations\u201d in her widely used text, A Practical Study of\nArgument:\nNo implication that we can mathematically measure or judge the\nrelevance and comparative strength of various reasons or\ncounterconsiderations is intended at this point. The metaphor of\n\u2018weighing\u2019 could be deemed misleading; however, it does not seem\npossible to eliminate it save by substituting another metaphor. (2004, p.\n415, n. 5)\nPrecisely the wish to make well-defined, intersubjectively valid\ninferences and calculations even with fuzzy premisses drives the attempts to\nuse \u201cweight\u201d and related physical concepts in theories inspired by Fuzzy\nLogic and related conceptions. But just as a binary quantitative argument\nevaluation cannot be upheld in practical reasoning, intersubjectivity too\ncannot be fully upheld.\nThe need to recognize degrees of premiss strength is only the first\nnecessary step. In addition, we must recognize that individuals may\nevaluate a given premiss differently along the quantitative dimension. The\nlack of intersubjectivity in this respect is the reason why \u201cweight\u201d is a\nquestionable metaphor. Instead, we might simply refer to the quantitative\ndimension of arguments in practical reasoning as \u201cstrength.\u201d\nAre we driven, then, to the conclusion that the appraisal of argument\nstrength in practical reasoning inherently involves a subjective element? My\nanswer is yes.\nGovier, however, presents a \u201cmethod for appraising conductive\narguments\u201d that some might see as aiming at objective appraisal of\nconductive arguments\u2014defined, following Wellman (1971), as cases where\nare several separately relevant premises both on the pro and the con side,\nwhich is precisely the category where practical reasoning belongs. The\nmethod involves determining the acceptability and relevance of all premises\nthat may be adduced on both sides and then judging which side outweighs\nthe other. Cautiously, Govier neither claims nor denies that this (rather\ncommonsensical) procedure will yield \u201cobjective\u201d appraisal. But she does\nsay this: \u201cTo reflect on what the pros and cons are, and how you would\nevaluate them or \u2018weigh up\u2019 the reasons requires good judgment, which you\n96 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nhave to supply for yourself\u201d (2004, 404). An earlier version of the text had\nformulations like this: \u201cAnswers, however, especially for issues as profound\nas that of euthanasia, will emerge from individual judgment about the\nsignificance of the various factors\u201d (1992, p. 311).\nAll in all, the denial of \u201cmathematical\u201d weighing, the use of the second\nperson pronoun, and the reference to \u201cindividual\u201d judgment which \u201cyou\nhave to supply for yourself\u201d make it clear that Govier does not see her\nmethod as yielding objective or intersubjective appraisal, but rather as\ninvolving a subjective element, at least in the \u201cweighing\u201d of the factors\u2014\nalthough she seems reluctant to say so. This reluctance might have to do\nwith the fact that she does not set off practical reasoning as a separate\ndomain within conductive argument, and/or with her background as a\nphilosopher. Other texts by writers with a rhetorical background are less\nhesitant to acknowledge this subjective element explicitly, as in this\nstatement:\nIn many ethical judgments, you and your audience might agree on\ncertain values, but not necessarily rank them in the same way. \u2026 most\nof the time weighting will be the crucial issue for your audience. People\nare quite likely to agree about the relevance of a set of criteria, but they\noften disagree about which particular one are most important in a given\nsituation. (Fahnestock and Secor, 2004, p. 249)\nI concur. To reiterate the two claims I make about argument \u201cstrength\u201d in\npractical reasoning, they are: 1) We must conceptualize argument strength\nas a non-binary, that is, gradualistic (\u201cscalar\u201d) notion. 2) We must\nconceptualize the fact that the strength assigned to arguments in practical\nreasoning may legitimately differ from one individual to another.\nI will support these claims, which together also provide my main reasons\nfor questioning Walton\u2019s presumptive model of practical reasoning, by\ndiscussing an authentic, paradigmatic example.\n6. An Example of Practical Reasoning: the Euro Debate\nA practical political issue in many European countries in the \u2018nineties\nwas the adoption of a common currency, the Euro. In most countries this\nissue was decided by Parliament; some countries had referendums\n(Denmark, 2000; result: rejection. Sweden, 2003; result: rejection). Other\ncountries are currently deliberating the issue.\nIn these debates, several macroeconomic arguments have been proffered,\nmainly predictions of likely consequences of either adoption or rejection of\n97 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nthe Euro. Some arguments have turned on microeconomics and simple\nconvenience: e.g., it is easier to travel between countries if one does not\nhave to change one\u2019s cash. Arguments of yet another nature have had to do\nwith the political implications, in a broader sense, of Europe (or most of it)\ngoing together on one single currency. Other arguments invoke feelings of\nnational identity, or the symbolic significance of a national currency. As is\nwell known, many people in Germany were reluctant to abandon the\nDeutschmark, but most German skeptics have now apparently acquiesced.\nOn the other hand, there is a continuing wish among Britons to retain\nSterling for reasons that have to do, at least in part, with national identity,\nand these feelings are strong enough to make the Government move with\nextreme caution on the issue.\nWe have here a paradigm case of an issue in practical reasoning. It\nillustrates a number of significant facts, stated above, about practical\nreasoning in general.\nFirst, let us consider the argument that if a country joins the Euro, its\ncitizens will not have to change their money nearly as often when traveling\nbetween European countries. There is no doubt that this is a true\n(\u201cacceptable\u201d) argument: all else equal, international travel will undeniably\nbe easier with the Euro. Also, this argument is undoubtedly relevant; greater\nease of international travel is an irrefutable advantage of adopting the Euro.\nHowever, it would be hard to find many who feel that this premiss alone\u2014\nwe may call it the convenience argument\u2014is \u201csufficient\u201d to trigger\nadoption of the Euro as an inference. On the other hand, it is also clear that\nthere is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d or defective at all about the convenience\nargument. Even if one does not see it as reason enough to join the Euro, it is\nundeniably an argument of some strength. Notice that this strength, such as\nit is, cannot be rebutted or annulled; it counts (although most people would\nprobably agree that it does not have \u201ca lot of\u201d strength).\nSo, clearly, in practical reasoning arguments may have a certain degree\nof strength which may not, however, be considered sufficient to trigger\nwhat Walton calls a directive inference, but which still counts.\nMoreover, given that an argument has some degree of strength, it will\nnot necessarily have the same degree of strength for everyone. This\nformulation is of course of a rather intuitive nature; what \u201cthe same\u201d means\nin this context is so far unclear. We might imagine an empirical definition,\nby which individuals would have to mark the perceived strength of the\nargument on a 1-7 Likert scale; a fair prediction is that not all marks would\n98 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\nhit the same point on the scale, although most marks would probably cluster\nat the lower end.\nAgain, we might think of two different types of people, e.g., a person\nliving in a rural inland area who rarely travels abroad, and a businessperson\nwho does so regularly. It is entirely plausible that to the latter person the\nconvenience argument would have more strength than it would to the\nformer. We might say that to both these people the convenience of a\ncommon currency would be an advantage of some value, but that to one of\nthem this value is greater than it is to the other. Furthermore, we should\nrecognize that this difference between the two people regarding the\nrespective strength they assign to the convenience argument is completely\n\u201clegitimate.\u201d It matters less to the first person than it does to the second.\nThis undeniable circumstance shows that in practical argumentation at least,\nthere is such a thing as argument strength which legitimately varies from\none person to the next.\nIt might be objected to this example that it is somehow \u201cwrong\u201d for a\ngiven voter, in deciding whether to vote for the Euro, to think merely of his\nor her own subjective convenience. Arguably what both our individuals\nought to do would be to consider what is best for the country, since they are\npresumably both going to be involved in a collective decision for the\ncountry as a whole.\nLet us accept this premiss for the sake of the argument. Still, regarding\nthe relative strengths of the arguments that we have enumerated, we would\nfind legitimate individual differences which could not be delegitimized or\nexplained away by theory. The convenience argument has not been the only\none to play a part in the Euro debates. (If it had been the only relevant\none\u2014but only in that unnatural case\u2014then we might have had a\npresumptive inference in favor of joining the Euro.) On any such issue there\nare, as a matter of course, countless other considerations: the macro- and\nmicroeconomic ones, political goals, and considerations relating to national\nidentity, symbolic significance, etc. The simultaneous existence of all these\nexplains why no single argument on such an issue can be sufficient to\ntrigger a directive inference, even though a number of these considerations\nmight all be acceptable, relevant and endowed with some strength.\nWhat concerns us just now is that to some people a given consideration,\ne.g., Sterling\u2019s \u201cnational-symbolic\u201d value, may have more relative strength\nthan it does to others. As a matter of fact, it appears that in Britain national-\nsymbolic arguments have sufficient strength for many people to override\narguments relating to convenience or economics. If we agree that this\n99 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\ndivergent assignment of argument strength across individuals is an\nempirical fact, then the question is whether argumentation theory should\nrecognize it as legitimate\u2014or whether such a recognition should be\ncondemned as relativistic. Of course it is legitimate, and a fact\nargumentation theory should describe and account for, not try to legislate\nout of existence. For example, to some Britons the status of the Sterling as a\nsymbol of national identity has sufficient strength as an argument to\ndetermine their stand against the Euro. To other Britons, the \u201cnational\nidentity\u201d argument may also be a strong anti-Euro argument, but they may\nnot perceive it as quite strong enough to override the economic or political\narguments they believe speak for the Euro. To still another group of\nBritons, the \u201cnational identity\u201d argument is perhaps of utterly negligible\nstrength; to them, it may even have what we might call negative strength, in\nthe sense that traditional feelings of British national identity are so\nunappealing to them that they would be more than willing to give up any\ntokens of such feelings the sooner the better.\n7. What the Example Demonstrates\nWe may define \u201cdegrees of strength\u201d in some absolute sense or in a\nrelative sense (as describing how strong a given argument is perceived to be\nby a given person in relation to other arguments). What the example of the\n\u201cnational identity\u201d argument demonstrates is, again, that in practical\nreasoning an argument may legitimately have different degrees of strength\nto different people; and it would demonstrate this no matter which absolute\nor relative definition of strength we might devise.\nOur example has also shown a fundamental yet curiously under-\ntheorized circumstance: in practical reasoning arguers appeal to a\nmultiplicity of goals to which those who are to decide are committed.\nWalton is aware of this when he describes practical reasoning as \u201ca goal-\ndriven, knowledge-based, action-guiding species of reasoning that\ncoordinates goals with possible alternative courses of action that are means\nto carry out these goals\u201d (1997, p. 608). This formulation captures much of\nthe complexity of practical reasoning. It is precisely true that there are\nalways several goals which must be coordinated; and that is the primary\nreason why practical reasoning is unfit to be modeled as presumptive.\nUnfortunately, however, Walton forgets this insight when he repeatedly\nrefers to \u201cthe local inference used in practical reasoning,\u201d in which \u201cA is the\ngoal,\u201d and, since \u201cB is necessary to bring about A, therefore, it is required to\nbring about B\u201d (1997, p. 608). Such a conception, where there is only one\n100 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\ngoal and one argument scheme in view, and where anything that is\nnecessary to bring that goal about is then \u201crequired,\u201d is inadvertently\nsuggestive of a closed mindset utterly alien to all that Walton stands for.\nInstead of speaking about \u201cgoals,\u201d a terminology which perhaps\nencourages narrowing \u201cone-goal-at-a-time\u201d conception of practical\nreasoning, we might speak about values. Any \u201cgoal\u201d implies that one\nassigns a value to a certain state of affairs that one wishes to promote. In\npractical deliberation, several values are involved for each participating\nindividual. A proposal may be seen, by each individual, as promoting some\nof his or her values and at the same time as counteracting others. It then\nbecomes a question, for that individual, of how strongly the decision is seen\nas promoting or counteracting the values involved. Further, the decision\ndepends on the strength of the individual\u2019s commitment to each of the\npertinent values. Whether we want to define the \u201cstrength\u201d of these values,\nfor each individual, in absolute terms or in relative terms, the fact remains\nthat not all individuals, not even all individuals in a circumscribed cultural\ngroup (such as \u201call Britons\u201d), can legitimately be expected to hold identical\nsets of values, arranged in the same relative order\u2014or \u201chierarchy,\u201d to use\nPerelman\u2019s and Olbrechts-Tyteca\u2019s term (1969, pp. 80-84). So, when facing\na practical proposal, such as adopting the Euro, each individual who is to\ndecide and, possibly, participate in the debate, will, in principle, consider\nthe arguments proffered in it from the vantage point of his or her own\nhierarchical set of values.\n8. The Charge of Relativism\nA claim such as this runs the risk of being branded by some\nargumentation theorists as \u201crelativism.\u201d The charge of relativism against\nother theories has been made repeatedly in writings by the Pragma-\nDialectical school (most recently in van Eemeren & Grootendorst 2004, p.\n130, with reference to Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969). A similar\ncriticism has recently been made, in very sweeping fashion, by Boger\n(2005).\nThe attack on relativism, but also much of the theory that is under attack\nfor alleged relativism, is based on the tacit but faulty assumption that this\nscholarly issue is about audience relativity (\u201crelativism\u201d) in all\nargumentation and in all compartments of argument evaluation. In other\nwords, the mistake on all sides is a failure to distinguish between those\ndomains and types of argumentation where audience relativity is inherently\n101 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\npresent, and those where it is not. Proponents of audience relativity tend to\nwrite as if their claims have reference to all argumentation; their critics\nmake the same mistake. Consequently, the scholarly discussion becomes a\nrather pointless quarrel where one party is perceived as saying that all\nevaluation criteria in argumentation are audience-relative, and the other\nparty counters this perceived claim by saying, indignantly, that their\nopponents are perniciously relativistic and that all evaluation criteria should\ncertainly be audience-independent. What I argue is not that all evaluation\ncriteria are audience-relative, but that some are, more specifically those\npertaining to the degree of relative strength of value-based arguments in\npractical reasoning.\nThus, if argument strength, in value-based practical reasoning,\nlegitimately varies from one person to the next, it does not deserve to be\ncalled \u201crelativism\u201d or the like, if this term implies that argumentation theory\nought not to recognize such a thing. The convenience of not having to\nchange currency when traveling will matter in different degrees to people\nwho deliberate the Euro issue. A theory which refuses to conceptualize facts\nsuch as this commits a grave error of omission; a proper theory should\ndescribe them and find proper places for them.\nCalling such a theory \u201crelativistic\u201d does not make the facts it describes\nless true or more avoidable. What alternative description could a \u201cnon-\nrelativistic\u201d argumentation offer? Would it venture to assess objectively\nprecisely how strong the various arguments in, e.g., the Euro debate, are?\nWill argumentation scholars tell voters just how much strength they ought\nto assign to the convenience argument, to the \u201cnational identity\u201d argument,\nand to the economic and political arguments, respectively? Or would\nargumentation theorists, to evade recognition of this alleged relativism, fall\nback on the time-worn denial strategy of postulating that all arguments, in\npractical reasoning as in logic, are either valid or invalid? While many\nargumentation theorists, including Douglas Walton, have abandoned\ndeductive validity as the sole criterion of argument evaluation, and while\nthe new concepts and categorizations which they have suggested have\nindeed deepened our insight into the workings of real-life argument, still\nwhen it comes to argument appraisal they have largely remained transfixed\nby the linear and binary mode of thinking characteristic of deductive logic.\nThe few exceptions, such as Wellman's notion of \u201cconduction\u201d (1971), have\nreceived too little attention. Theorists have been afraid of opening the door\nto gradualism in the appraisal of argument strength, perhaps because they\nsee that they will then have no way of avoiding what they abhor as\n102 Is Practical Reasoning Presumptive?\n\u201crelativism.\u201d Thus, newer concepts to substitute traditional \u201cvalidity\u201d have\nnot managed to (or even sought to) escape binarism; that is equally true\nwhether the criterion suggested is \u201csufficiency,\u201d or, as in Walton\u2019s\npresumptive reasoning, correct use of argumentation schemes.\nTrue enough, there are many aspects of everyday argumentation on\nwhich argumentation scholars can and should pronounce evaluative\nassessments in binary terms. In the public sphere we may every day hear\nmoves which are unequivocally fallacious or dishonest and deserve\nexposure. Yet, as Walton has repeatedly shown, there are just as many\npoints where argumentation scholars have been overzealous to pronounce\ngeneralized, categorical judgment. Walton has added countless welcome\nnuances to the appraisal of real-life argumentation. However, where\npractical reasoning is concerned\u2014and the Euro debate is just one instance\nof that\u2014his presumptive model fails to capture some of the central features.\nBecause practical reasoning deals with actions and with the multiple values\nwhich provide warrants for them, it works in a way that argumentation\nscholars should study rather than be uncomfortable with: there are degrees\nof argument strength; the appraisal of degrees of argument strength may be\ninherently subjective; and this is legitimately so.\nREFERENCES\nAdams, E.W., and H.P.

Many modern theorists tend to see argumentation\nas a homogeneous phenomenon. Even so, there has recently been a\ntendency to differentiate more, for example in the works of Douglas Walton,\nwho has defined different types of argumentative dialogue. However, to\nunderstand deliberative argumentation better, we also need to differentiate\nin another way, namely on the basis of argumentative issues. Aristotle did\nthis when he defined the three main genres of rhetoric. And if we take a\ncloser look at the nature of the issues in deliberative argumentation, several\ninteresting implications will ensue. Deliberative argumentation will turn\nout to be at odds with assumptions widely accepted in current theories, such\nas pragma-dialectics and the model of \u201cpresumptive\u201d reasoning advocated\nby Walton.\nThe essential fact about deliberative argumentation is that it is not about\ntruth, but action. This fact has been cursorily acknowledged by some\ntheorists, but hardly explored. Toulmin (1958), who makes a strong case for\ndistinguishing between argumentative fields, nevertheless only considers\narguments for claims like \u201cHarry is a British citizen\u201d and other constative\npropositions. Even Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca fail to make a consistent\ndistinction between arguments about action and arguments about truth. On\nthe one hand, they emphasize that deliberative argumentation is \u201coriented\ntoward the future\u201d and \u201csets out to bring about some action or to prepare for\nit by acting, by discursive methods, on the minds of the hearers\u201d (1969, p.\n* Originally published in Anyone Who Has a View: Theoretical Contributions to the Study of\nArgumentation, F.H. van Eemeren, J.A. Blair, C.A. Willard & A.F. Snoeck Henkemans\n(Eds.). Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers 2003, 157-171. Reprinted with permission\nof Springer Publishers. Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\n47); on the other hand, they cloud the distinction by repeatedly speaking of\n\u201ctheses\u201d presented for the audience\u2019s assent. Characteristically, to find\nacknowledgement that the issues in deliberative argumentation are not\npropositions or theses, we must go to the textbook literature, including the\nwork that Toulmin co-authored (1979). Educators remember what theorists\nlike to forget: deliberative argumentation is ultimately not about what is\ntrue, but about what to do.\nA typical deliberative issue is (for the United States, at the time of\nwriting), \u201cstarting a war on Iraq.\u201d Those who propose this action are\nmaking a proposal. It would be a categorical mistake to predicate truth, or\nfor that matter falsehood, of a proposal. Proposals are not propositions\n(assertions, constative statements); they do not predicate that anything is the\ncase.\nWalton comes close to saying just that in his distinction between\n\u201cpractical\u201d and \u201cdiscursive\u201d reasoning, when he states: \u201cIn the action type\nof critical discussion, the proposition is a practical ought-proposition that\ncontains an imperative\u201d (1996, p. 177). However, he blurs the distinction\nagain by describing the deliberative issue as a proposition about what is\n\u201cprudential.\u201d The issue in deliberative argumentation is not a proposition; it\nis a proposal. It does not predicate a state of affairs, nor what ought to be\nthe case; it proposes an action. It is like proposing a toast, or proposing\nmarriage to someone. Proposals cannot be true or false.\nAll this is not to deny that deliberative argumentation usually involves a\ngreat deal of constative propositions, e.g., \u201cIraq supports Al-Qaeda\nterrorists.\u201d Such a claim may indeed be used as an argument in favour of\nstarting a war; but the ultimate issue at the top of the argumentative\nhierarchy is the decision on whether to take action in the form of war.\nSimilarly, the issues of recent referendums in Europe have not been\npropositions, but proposals to adopt the common currency, or to accept the\ntreaty of Nice. Such issues cannot be formulated as constative statements,\nand they cannot have truth-values. What we vote about is not the truth of a\nproposition, but the acceptance of a proposal.\nIt may seem formalistic to insist on this distinction. But it has important\nimplications. One of them is that, strictly speaking, there cannot be any\nlogic of deliberative argumentation. This is because \u201clogic\u201d is about\npropositions, whereas deliberative argumentation is about proposals. And\nthis accounts for another essential feature of deliberative argumentation,\nnamely what we may call its multidimensionality.\n107 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nThis term means that arguments for or against a proposal may belong to\na number of separate dimensions. If I propose marriage to someone, she\nmight find me a prudential choice; but she might not love me. And even if\nshe did love me, there would still be the fact that to marry her, I would have\nto break up my current family, which would be ethically questionable. So in\ndeliberating upon my proposal of marriage, the chosen woman would have\nto do some mental juggling of arguments belonging to three dimensions:\nprudence, inclination, and ethics\u2014and perhaps even more.\nAs we know from experience as well as from countless fictional\nnarratives in literature, drama, or film, no logical rules can tell us how to\nput such heterogeneous arguments on a common denominator and calculate\nthe net result. They lack commensurability. On the war against Iraq, too,\nthere are many arguments on both sides, representing many dimensions.\nSome believe it will stabilize the region; others, that it will not. Both these\narguments belong to the dimension of the socially advantageous, or, in\nWalton\u2019s term, the \u201cprudential.\u201d But other arguments in the same debate\nbelong to an ethical or religious dimension. Some argue that a pre-emptive\nattack on another country is an indefensible infringement of international\nlaw; others, that murderous dictators like Saddam Hussein must be deposed.\nAgain, the dimensions that the various arguments belong to lack\ncommensurability.\nBy contrast, in a discussion of whether a certain proposition is true\u2014that\nis, whether a certain predicate can be truthfully predicated of a certain\nsubject\u2014we only have to consider one dimension, namely the one\nrepresented by that predicate.\nThe insight that deliberative rhetoric is multidimensional is as old as\nrhetoric itself, and it remains standard doctrine throughout antiquity. A brief\noverview of classical thinking on this theme may be in order here.\nWe find the multidimensional view of deliberation full-fledged in early\nSophistic rhetoric, as in the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum, probably the oldest\nextant book on rhetoric, once thought to be by Aristotle. This text, which\nmay antedate Aristotle\u2019s by a few years, offers a list of dimensions in\ndeliberative argument: \u201che who persuades must show that those things to\nwhich he exhorts are just, lawful, expedient, honourable, pleasant, and easy\nof accomplishment\u201d (1421b).\nThis type of advice has always struck some commentators as cynical or\nopportunistic in the way it suggests a battery of alternative lines of\nargument; it has an air of \u201ctry anything that works\u201d or even \u201canything\n108 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\ngoes.\u201d But this seeming opportunism represents the fundamental insight that\nwhen we have to decide about contested actions, more than one general\npremise may come into play.\nAristotle, Plato\u2019s student, who saw his task as that of turning rhetorical\ntextbook lore into a tekhn\u0113, went out of his way to make deliberative debate\nneatly one-dimensional by declaring that \u201c[t]he end of the deliberative\nspeaker is the expedient or harmful [to sympheron kai blaberon] \u2026 all other\nconsiderations, such as justice and injustice, honour and disgrace, are\nincluded as accessory to this [symparalambanei]\u201d (Rhetoric, I, iii, 5;\n1358b).\nSubsequent classical theory, however, continues to recognise at least two\nmutually independent dimensions in deliberative argument. The anonymous\nauthor of the influential Rhetorica ad Herennium (c. 90 B.C.) pays only a\ntoken tribute to one-dimensionality but effectually comes down on the side\nof the multidimensional view (1954, 3.3.):\nThe orator who gives counsel will throughout his speech set up\nAdvantage (utilitas) as his aim, so that the complete economy of his\nentire speech may be directed to it.\nAdvantage in political deliberation has two aspects: Security (tuta)\nand Honour (honesta).\nHe goes on to subdivide each of these two, establishing a multi-layered\nhierarchy of values. However, the governing notion that Advantage is one\nnotion is hard to see as more than a fudge when is has two \u201caspects\u201d\n(partes) as potentially antagonistic as Security and Honour.\nYoung Cicero, writing his De inventione perhaps a few years later,\nexplicitly recognizes that deliberative argument has two dimensions,\nhonestas and utilitas, whereas for each of the other two main genres there is\nonly one: aequitas for the forensic genre, honestas for the epideictic. As\nalso done in the ad Herennium, each of these is then subdivided into several\ncomponent parts, and further complications are introduced in the form of\nfeasibility, ease of accomplishment, necessity, and affectio (meaning a\ntemporary change in the way some specific situation is evaluated) (De\ninventione, 2, pp. 156-176).\nRoughly similar analyses appear in Cicero's mature works. In the De\noratore (written 55 B.C.) the experienced Antonius explains how, in\ndeliberative matters, some debaters will emphasize aspects of utilitas, such\nas peace, wealth, power, or revenue, while others will talk about aspects of\nhonestas, notably immortalis memoria and laus. Whichever of these one\n109 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nprefers, considerations of feasibility and necessity are always paramount (II,\n334ff.). The shorter and more technical work De partitione oratoria\n(written towards 50 B.C.) presents a somewhat more complex analysis.\nFurther considerations introduced here include the assessment of how\nimportant a course of action is (quam sit magnum), a factor which may\nargue for it although it may be hard of accomplishment. Also, Cicero points\nout that the hearers who are to decide on deliberative issues are of two\nclasses: one which in all matters prefers dignitas (a term also used in De\noratore, which may or may not be synonymous with honestas), and another\nwhich always looks for gain and for voluptas (De partitione, 83-89).\nQuintilian devotes the whole of book III, chapter 8, of his Institutio to a\ndiscussion of the deliberative genre, declaring at the outset disagreement\nwith those rhetoricians who see utilitas as its sole end. If one criterion were\nsufficient in deliberative debate, he would opt for Cicero's dignitas;\nhowever, we must recognize the fact that deliberative audiences will often\nconsist mainly of uneducated people, and this implies that we should\ndistinguish between utile and honestum. In another respect, too, deliberative\nargument is multidimensional: it is not, as some claim, restricted to\nquestions belonging to the qualitative status; issues of conjecture and\ndefinition, and issues belonging to the various legal status are involved as\nwell.\nIn the so-called \u201csecond sophistic\u201d during the centuries following\nQuintilian, we find, as in the early sophistic reflected in the Ad Alexandrum,\nan unabashed recognition that deliberative rhetoric has a diversity of equal,\nincommensurable dimensions, and no attempt is made to make one of them\nthe master dimension or common denominator of all. The meticulous\nsystematizer of Hellenistic rhetoric, Hermogenes (c. 150 A.D.), has\nincluded deliberative argumentation in his stasis system under the name\n\u201cthe practical issue\u201d(stasis pragmatikos), and he simply states that its\n\u201cdivisions\u201d are the following: \u201clegality; justice; advantage; feasibility;\nhonour; consequence\u201d (1995, p. 52). His work on invention gives a highly\ntechnical account of how any line of argument that one chooses may be\nsystematically structured and \u201cworked up\u201d (ergasia). Conley rightly says of\nthe Hermogenean system: \u201cThis is clearly a long way from the syllogism-\nbased notion of rhetoric familiar from, say, Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric\u201d (1990, p.\n56).\nWhat is important to gather from this overview of classical thinking\nabout deliberation is primarily the insight that unites all these thinkers, with\nthe possible exception of Aristotle himself: deliberative argumentation has\n110 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nmore than one dimension. How many dimensions or \u201ctopics\u201d each thinker\nrecognizes, how they are named, and what exactly is the structure of the\nconceptual hierarchy in which they are arranged, is not the issue here.\nInstead I wish to highlight the fact that with as soon as we have more than\none dimension, we have, in principle, incommensurability.\nWe might add that even in a model which recognises only one master\ndimension, such as Aristotle's with its sympheron-blaberon axis, we find\nthat the explication of what this implies takes us back to Aristotle's ethical\nkey concept of eudaimonia\u2014which he then proceeds to analyse in chapters\n5 and 6 of his Book I. Chapter 7 presents a list of topoi for deciding which\nof two goods is the greater one. But even in such a system,\nincommensurability is inevitable. The very fact that there is a list of topoi\nfor deciding which is the greater or lesser good implies that an action A\nmay involve a greater good than B in relation to one topos\u2014 but at the\nsame time a lesser good in relation to another topos. At the end of the day,\nthe master rule that allows us to calculate objectively which good is the\ngreater one eludes us.\nA further important observation is that gradual differences in regard to a\ngiven dimension are recognized by all the classical rhetoricians. The\ndimensions they deal in are not exclusive dichotomies, like the true vs. false\nopposition. Not only in to regard to importance, as we saw in Cicero, but\nfor all relevant dimensions it is clearly possible that a given action may\nhave more or less of the quality designated by that dimension. The\nadvantage that will accrue from a given action may be greater or lesser; it\nmay be honourable, or dishonourable, to a greater or lesser degree; it may\nbe more or less feasible.\nFinally, both Cicero and Quintilian emphatically note that people differ\nin regard to the weight they will ascribe to each of the dimensions. So not\nonly are there separate dimensions, on each of which the proposed action\nwill be assigned a graduated evaluation; also, each of the individuals who\nare to evaluate will do their separate and subjective evaluations.\nAll in all, the kind of multi-dimensional theory typified by Hermogenes\u2019\nlist, or that of the Ad Alexandrum, which is practically the same, is, as we\nhave now seen, mainstream thinking in ancient rhetoric. The diversity of\nsuch lists, and the absence of \u201ctruth\u201d from them, were no doubt some of the\naspects of sophistic doctrine that made Plato and others see rhetoric as\nopportunistic flattery and a method for turning black into white. We may\ncompare this sophistic recognition of multidimensionality with the\ndisillusioning discovery by the Pythagorean mathematicians of irrational\n111 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nnumbers. (For example, the relation between the diagonal and the sides of a\nsquare is irrational. No mathematical calculation can find a common\ndenominator, or \u201ccommensurability,\u201d between them.)\nBy contrast, economic cost and benefit, for example, are commensurable\nentities. Both have the same denomination: money; they may therefore be\nreduced to one coefficient. Not so with the various arguments that are\nadvanced about deliberative proposals such as starting a war, adopting the\nEuro, banning abortion or capital punishment. In such matters, there is no\nalgorithm for tallying up the pros and cons.\nThis is why the distinction between and propositions and proposals is\nimportant. With propositions, we may, in principle, have deductive validity.\nA proposition is one-dimensional in that it asserts one predicate, and that is\nwhy the truth of that predication may follow from the truth of the premises.\nA proposal does not assert anything, although several propositions\nrepresenting separate dimensions may be asserted as premises for or against\nthe decision to accept a given proposal.\nAs a consequence, in deliberative issues there can be no deductive\ninference from premises to acceptance. This point is central to Perelman\u2019s\nentire thinking about argumentation; indeed, he sees the defining feature of\n\u201cargumentation,\u201d as opposed to \u201cdemonstration,\u201d in the fact that\nargumentation is \u201cnoncompulsive,\u201d i.e., that deductive inference is not\npossible. The following statement of this principle from one of Perelman\u2019s\nlater writings squarely aligns \u201ctruth,\u201d as in propositions, with\n\u201cdemonstration,\u201d and \u201cargumentation with \u201cdecision,\u201d as in proposals.\nIn argumentation, it is not a matter of showing (as it is in demonstration)\nthat an objective quality (such as truth) moves from the premises\ntowards the conclusion, but rather it is a matter of showing that one can\nconvince others of the reasonable and acceptable character of a decision,\nbased on what the audience already assumes and based on the theses to\nwhich it adheres with sufficient intensity. (1989, p. 11)\nBy contrast, in arguing for a proposition we may in principle make a\ndeductive inference, i.e., make the truth of the premises \u201cmove towards the\nconclusion,\u201d and this proposition may then be used in deliberative debate as\nan argument for adopting a given proposal. But at that stage there is no\ndeductive inference. There will always be other arguments in the matter,\npertaining to other dimensions, and there is no deductive way to reduce the\nmultiple, multidimensional arguments to one common denominator and\ndeduce a net result.\n112 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nPerelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca anticipated this characteristic of\ndeliberative argumentation. They pointed out that \u201cthe possibility of arguing\nin such a way as to reach opposite conclusions\u201d will always exist \u201cwhen the\nargumentation aims at bringing about an action which is the result of a\ndeliberate choice among several possibilities\u201d (1969, p. 46).\nHowever, much current theory has failed to follow this lead. In pragma-\ndialectics, for example, some form of deductivism is central, i.e., a belief in\na normative rule demanding that the conclusion should follow in a valid\nmanner from the premises. One of the ten basic rules of pragma-dialectics\nstates: \u201cA party may use only arguments in its argumentation that are\nlogically valid or capable of being validated by making explicit one or more\nunexpressed premises\u201d (Rule 8 in van Eemeren et al., 1996, p. 284). But as\nwe have just seen, because deliberative argumentation is about proposals\nand hence multidimensional, it does not allow for logical validity.\nPragma-dialecticians are aware of a difficulty here. A footnote to the\npassage just quoted states that \u201cvalid\u201d is used in \u201ca broader sense,\u201d so that\nthere is no \u201cdogmatic commitment\u201d to deductivism. However, it never\nbecomes quite clear in what broader sense \u201cvalid\u201d is to be taken. There are\nsporadic comments, but they all deal with the kind of reservations about the\nvalidity concept that are internal to the purely formal definition, e.g., how to\navoid granting \u201cvalidity\u201d to an inference where the conclusion\ntautologically repeats a premise. What we generally do not find in pragma-\ndialectics, however, is a clear recognition that arguments in, e.g., ethical or\npolitical debate may be perfectly good and legitimate, and yet not be valid\nin any sense resembling deductive validity.\nThe qualification that arguments, if not logically valid, should be\n\u201ccapable of being validated by making explicit one or more unexpressed\npremises\u201d does not fix this hole in the theory. The unexpressed premises\nthus imputed to arguers so that their arguments may be \u201cvalidated\u201d are, in\nmany cases, premises that these people themselves would undoubtedly\nreject. For example, a British opponent of the Euro may believe in the\nargument that Sterling, as a symbol of national identity, should be\npreserved. But that person is not thereby committed to the premise that any\nsymbol of national identity should always be preserved in any country or\ncontext. And only such a general premise would serve to \u201cvalidate\u201d his\nargument against the Euro. So the notion of \u201cvalidating\u201d arguments by\nreconstructing their unexpressed premises does not do justice to the way\nmany people actually use arguments on deliberative issues.\n113 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nAnother example of a premise where this kind of validation would\nmisrepresent the arguer\u2019s own standpoint may be cited from a televised\ndebate discussed in J\u00f8rgensen, Kock and R\u00f8rbech (1998). The issue was\nwhether to ban surrogate motherhood arrangements. The opponent of this\nproposal was Ms. Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard (later to become leader of the anti-\nimmigrant Danish People\u2019s Party, which has recently generated\ninternational attention). Her main argument was that a ban on surrogate\nmotherhood would be a curtailment of personal freedom. Interestingly, this\ncharismatic and powerful political leader lost the debate to a soft-spoken\nacademic who argued that babies born by surrogate mothers might become\nmerchandise. But what is more relevant in the present context is the fact\nMs. Kj\u00e6rsgaard would never accept a general premise rejecting every\ncurtailment of personal freedom. After all, any law curtails personal\nfreedom. For example, her party has recently helped introducing new laws\nseverely restricting citizens\u2019 rights to bring foreign spouses to the country.\nSeveral theorists who sympathize with pragma-dialectics have sensed\nthat its deductivist position is in need of qualification or defence. One such\ntheorist is Leo Groarke, who states, with praiseworthy explicitness, \u201cnatural\nlanguage arguments should be understood as attempts to formulate\ndeductive arguments\u201d (1999, p. 2). He points out, amongst other things, that\nvalidity in the relation between premises and conclusion only means that\nthe conclusion preserves any certainty inherent in the premises, not that a\ncertain conclusion can be drawn from uncertain premises. But even with\nthis\u2014perhaps rather obvious\u2014qualification, deductivism is still at odds\nwith the kind of arguments found in deliberative debate. And the way\nGroarke speaks of \u201cinductivism\u201d as the only alternative to deductivism\nindicates that in fact he only has argumentation about propositions, i.e.,\nconstatives, in mind. The fact is that in deliberative debates we often hear\narguments that are quite certain and legitimate, for example that if we adopt\nthe Euro, we will not need to change our money when travelling to another\nmember country; but in spite of such unassailable arguments, the\nconclusion, namely the adoption of the Euro, does not follow deductively\n(as a majority of Danish voters demonstrated when they rejected the Euro in\na referendum in September 2000).\nAnother attempt to preserve some version of the normative validity\nrequirement is based on the idea of arguments being presumptive or\ndefeasible. Douglas Walton is the foremost exponent of this approach.\nHowever, the notion of presumptiveness is slippery. It is clear that\npresumptive reasoning is non-monotonic, in the sense that new arguments\n114 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nmay come up so that debaters are no longer committed to the presumed\nconclusion. But what is the nature of this commitment to the presumed\nconclusion\u2014as long as it lasts? It seems that there are two versions of this\ncommitment, one weaker and one stronger. In the weak version, when an\narguer offers an argument in support of a conclusion, then a burden of proof\nis shifted onto the respondent, who then has to question or attack the\nargument. By doing that, he can shift the burden back onto the other side. In\nthe strong version of what presumption means, the respondent is committed\nto accepting the conclusion, in a presumptive way, unless he can find fault\nwith the argument.\nThis latter meaning of presumption seems to be understood in the\nfollowing statement by Walton, summarizing the views of van Eemeren and\nGrootendorst (1992): \u201cIf the hearer accepts the premises of the speaker\u2019s\nargument, and the argument is an instance of a genuine and appropriate\nargumentation scheme (for the type of dialogue they are engaged in), then\nthe hearer must or should (in some binding way) accept the conclusion\u201d\n(Walton 1996, p. 10). Walton goes on to say that this \u201cdoes not appear to be\n\u2018validity\u2019 in the same sense in which the word is familiarly used in\ndeductive (or even inductive) logic.\u201d But still we find here the same general\ntendency as in the deductive model of argumentation: if an argument is\n\u201cvalid,\u201d then the hearer is in some way \u201cbound\u201d to accept the conclusion.\nValidity, even if it does not mean deductive or monotonic validity, means\n\u201cbindingness\u201d\u2014although the precise nature of the binding commitment or\nburden is often hard to pin down.\nI suggest that argumentation theory, at least as far as deliberative\nargumentation is concerned, needs to abandon the notion that the validity of\nan argument has to do with the conclusion being in some way binding. Plain\ndeductivism, reconstructionism, and presumptionism are all versions of the\ndeductivist way of thinking about argumentation. But for deliberative\nargumentation at least, this way of thinking is false. A look at any\ndeliberative debate will show that the arguments used there may be\nperfectly good and legitimate, indeed that they may fully deserve the term\n\u201cvalid\u201d\u2014and yet the conclusion they support does not follow in any\nbinding way. In most cases, not even the debater who uses a given\nargument in deliberation believes that the hearer should be bound by the\nconclusion. Moreover, respondents in deliberative argumentation often do\nnot feel obliged to raise critical questions about their opponents\u2019 arguments,\nlest they should become bound to accepting their conclusion. This is not\nbecause they abandon their standpoint or shirk their duties as debaters. Just\n115 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nas often, it is because they acknowledge that the opponent has a legitimate\nargument; but, on the other hand, they believe they have arguments for their\nown standpoint that have greater weight.\nThe reason that deliberative debaters may think so is precisely that\ndeliberative argumentation is multidimensional. This property implies that\narguments may be perfectly good and yet not binding.\nIn a recent paper by van Eemeren himself, with Peter Houtlosser (2000),\nwe find an excellent example of deliberative argumentation, illustrative of\nmany of its central features. They quote a heated British debate on fox-\nhunting, which can be seen as illustration of how each side, precisely\nbecause of the multidimensionality of such debates, has legitimate\narguments which carry some weight, but which cannot in themselves entail\na conclusion.\nThe anti-hunters argue that foxhunting is cruel, and they draw an\nanalogy to cock-fighting and bear-baiting\u2014both of which were banned long\nago. The pro-hunters argue that a ban would unsettle popular rural traditions\nand have a divisive effect, \u201csetting town against country.\u201d Both these\narguments are legitimate and carry some weight, yet neither of them is\nsufficient in itself to entail a conclusion. Even many of those who would\nuse one of these arguments in a debate over this issue are probably not\nready to accept a \u201creconstructed\u201d general premise that would make their\nargument deductively valid; even die-hard foxhunters hardly believe that\nany socially divisive policy should necessarily be rejected. The abolitionist\ncampaign in the United States 150 years ago was socially divisive and did\nset town against country; and even for an abolitionist like Lincoln himself,\nthis argument no doubt was legitimate and had a certain weight. However,\nin the particular situation it was outweighed, for him and for many other\nAmericans, by other considerations. Similarly, the cruelty argument is\nlegitimate and yet not deductively valid. There are many cruel practices in\nour society, some of them traditional and some modern, but recognizing\nthat they are cruel does not entail a commitment to having them all banned.\nNeither does the analogy to other cruel practices that have been banned\nentail such a commitment. One debater in van Eemeren and Houtlosser\u2019s\narticle offers further analogies such as horse races and \u201cthe far larger cruelty\nof factory farming.\u201d However, many people who feel that there is indeed an\namount of cruelty in horse racing and factory farming probably do not\nbelieve that they should eo ipso be banned. Thus, when theorists impute\nsuch an unexpressed belief to them in order to \u201cvalidate\u201d their argument,\nthe theorists are at odds with how people actually think.\n116 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nThe example questions not only the deductivist account of\nargumentation, but also the presumptionist theory. That theory would hold\nthat if a debater points out that foxhunting is cruel and argues that it should\ntherefore be banned, then that presumption stands, and the opponent should\nthen carry the burden of proof and refute the argument. But none of the pro-\nfox-hunters in the debate seem to have tried to refute the cruelty argument,\nin fact they may tacitly have recognized its legitimacy; instead, they meet it\nwith an argument belonging to another dimension, i.e., the social good of\nhallowed traditions and the avoidance of divisive laws. Thus an ethical\nargument is countered, not cancelled, with social arguments. One may see\nall these arguments as acceptable and having at least some weight\u2014and\nmany people probably do. This is tantamount to saying that none of them is\nlogically valid or \u201cbinding,\u201d not even in the \u201cpresumptive\u201d way.\nA final, paradigmatic example may be in order. In an article titled \u201cThe\nright to live vs. the right to die: No single yardstick,\u201d columnist Ellen\nGoodman (1986) describes two cases of people who wished to be allowed\nto die by starvation. One was an 85-year-old man in Syracuse, N.Y., who\nhad recently had a stroke, and who had deliberately stopped eating. The\nadministrators of the nursing home where he lived wanted to force-feed\nhim, and took the case to court. However, Justice Miller of the State\nSupreme Court ruled against them, writing in his ruling, \u201cI will not, against\nhis wishes, order this man to be operated upon and/or to be force-fed.\u201d\nGoodman comments that she approves of this ruling. The fact that the man\nwished to die of starvation was indeed a legitimate reason in favour of\nletting him die\u2014but even so, it was not a reason that deductively entailed\nthe decision.\nHere Groarke's point about deductive validity being only certainty-\npreserving, not certainty-establishing, is irrelevant: the man certainly\nwished to die, and this was undoubtedly a legitimate argument, yet the\ndecision did not follow deductively. It would obviously be false to\n\u201creconstruct\u201d a general unexpressed premise underlying the Justice\u2019s\ndecision (and Goodman\u2019s approval of it) to the effect that \u201call persons who\nwish to die of starvation should be allowed to do so.\u201d The premise we may\nreconstruct is rather that a person\u2019s wish to die of starvation is a reason in\nfavour of letting that person do so. No more, no less.\nThat this is so is brought out explicitly by Goodman's second example: a\n26-year old woman in California, severely handicapped by cerebral palsy,\nwanted to be allowed to starve herself to death. Yet here the judge denied\nher request. And Goodman agrees with this decision too. But there is no\n117 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\ninconsistency. It is much more reasonable to say that in both cases, she (like\nthe judges handling the cases) holds the premise, stated before, that a\nperson\u2019s wish to die of starvation is a reason in favour of letting that person\ndo so. No more, no less. It is a premise with some weight in both cases, but\nin neither case does this premise, however true and certain, deductively\nentail the conclusion. In one case, this reason is on the \u201cwinning\u201d side of the\nargument; in the other case, on the losing side. In both cases, it is legitimate\nand has a certain weight.\nIn defence of the deductivist account, one might rightly point out that the\npatient\u2019s own wish is not the only premise in either of the two cases. The\ndeductivist might then argue that when this premise is added to the other\npertinent premises in each of the cases, then the conclusion in each of the\ntwo cases follows deductively. In other words, for the old man one would\nsay something like this: his own wish, his advanced age and the nature of\nhis illness together entail the conclusion that he should be allowed to die.\nFor the young woman, her youth would be one of the premises that, in spite\nof her own wish, deductively entail the opposite conclusion.\nIt is easy to see how artificial such an account would be. How does one\nadd up the premises favouring a certain conclusion, and how does one\nsubtract the ones favouring the opposite conclusion? How old does one\nhave to be to be allowed to starve oneself to death? How ill? We would\nneed an algorithm assigning a specific weight to each premise, using the\nsame common denominator for all the premises, and we would need a rule\ndefining just how much weight on one side would be needed to constitute a\ndeductively valid inference. The two cases in question were both brought to\ncourt and decided there, but obviously no such formula exists in the laws of\nthe two states. Even if it did, it is obvious that a rule stating just how much\nweight is needed to make a conclusion deductively \u201cvalid\u201d would be quite\narbitrary; a different threshold value might just as well have been chosen.\nFor Goodman too, a whole set of considerations explain why she thinks\ndifferently of the two cases. But that is precisely the nature of making\ndecisions, whether in court, in politics, in ethics or in everyday life. In a\nsituation where several considerations or premises simultaneously play\nlegitimate parts, the demand that conclusions follow deductively from their\npremises is doomed to failure, or forced to resort to artificial ad hoc\nconstructions. The only natural way to account for argumentation in such\nsituations is to say that a number of arguments or premises are all legitimate\nand relevant, but that there is no deductively valid link from the relevant\npremises to any conclusion.\n118 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nIndeed, we might argue that the use of the term \u201cvalid\u201d in logic is a\nmisnomer, and that the term might be much better employed for precisely\nthose arguments that are legitimate without being deductively valid or\ncogent. Instead, \u201cvalid\u201d arguments would be those that speak with some\nweight for the conclusion.\nIf one follows Walton\u2019s account, one might object that these cases still\nallow of a semi-deductivist or \u201cpresumptionist\u201d interpretation. A patient\u2019s\nown wish to die of starvation, we might say, creates a presumption that the\npatient be allowed to do so\u2014unless there are other factors that negate this\npresumption. Thus we have a valid inference of the \u201cpresumptive\u201d or\n\u201cdefeasible\u201d kind.\nThe answer to this account is that there are always other factors. They do\nnot arrive out of the blue; they are always there already. But in neither of\nthe two cases do these other factors that may plead for the opposite decision\nnegate the legitimacy of the patient\u2019s own wish. That wish remains a\nlegitimate argument of some weight, even if we decide that there are other\narguments of greater weight that plead for the opposite decision. The idea\nthat we either have to negate and demolish an argument, or else accept the\nconclusion for which it pleads, is false.\nThe attentive reader will not have missed the fact that the two contrasted\nexamples cited by Goodman do not strictly belong to the deliberative genre,\nbut are in fact cases of judicial reasoning. However, this circumstance\nmight actually be seen as an a fortiori argument for the thesis presented\nhere: we see that even in legal argumentation, which is of course much\nmore constrained than deliberative argumentation by the existence of\nexplicit and binding rules (such as laws and other provisions), we find that\ndecisions with deductive force are (often) not possible; even here we often\nfind an array of arguments on both sides, belonging to several dimensions,\nso that there is no objective or deductive way of calculating the relative\nstrength of the opposite cases. This fact has long been central to the\nthinking of leading theorists of legal reasoning, including Joseph Raz,\nRobert Alexy, and Aleksander Peczenik (cf., e.g., Alexy 1978, Raz 1986,\nPeczenik 1995). Essentially, it implies that \u201c[a] reasonable legal\nargumentation is a special case of a reasonable moral argumentation\u201d\n(Peczenik, p. 747). Accordingly, the \u201cincommensurability\u201d of values or\ndimensions entering into ethical, political and legal decisions has been the\nobject of sustained theoretical reflection in recent years (cf., notably, the\nwriters contributing to Chang 1998).\n119 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nThe two cases described by Goodman are thus telling examples of how\nthe making of decisions in politics, ethics or law is better described by the\nterm \u201ccasuistry,\u201d as defined by Jonsen and Toulmin (1988), than by a model\nbased on the deductive application of general principles.\nIt seems that we need an alternative metaphor for thinking not only\nabout deliberative argumentation, but more broadly about how we discuss\ndecisions\u2014instead of the old metaphors that have to do with \u201cchains\u201d of\nreasoning or lines of argument that \u201cbind\u201d the opponent.\nThe ancient forensic image of the scales in which opposing arguments\nare weighed is a good starting point, emphasizing as it does that\ndeliberation is related to libra, the Latin word for scales. However, while\nthis image is illustrative of some features of deliberative debate, it is\nmisleading about others.\nSome interesting aspects well illustrated by the \u201cscales\u201d image are:\n(1) In deliberative debate there is no deductive or \u201cvalid\u201d demonstration\nof the claim, in the sense of \u201cvalid\u201d defined by logic. Indeed, deliberative\ndebaters often do not proceed from \u201cpremises\u201d to \u201cconclusion,\u201d as logicians\ndo, but the other way around, i.e., they begin with a standpoint for which\nthey then try to find arguments. To apply the scales image, people generally\nhave a preconceived wish to tip the scales one way or the other, and they\nlook for weights to throw into one of the two pans.\n(2) Arguments used by deliberative debaters defy evaluation by binary\nstandards such as valid/invalid, or sound/unsound; in deliberative debate\nthere will generally be some arguments on both sides that have some\nweight. The assessment of the relative merit of arguments will typically be\na matter of degrees.\n(3) Although deliberative debaters sometimes pretend that their\narguments make their proposals deductively valid or \u201cbinding,\u201d just as often\nthey do not and would not pretend any such thing. This calls into question\nthe way argumentation theorists \u201creconstruct\u201d deliberative arguments by\nintroducing \u201cvalidating\u201d premises.\n(4) Deliberative debate is usually not linear, i.e., it is usually not limited\nto the establishment or refutation of one \u201cclinching\u201d argument. This is\nbecause there are no clinching arguments in deliberative debate, which\nagain is why there are often several arguments on each side. Staking all on\none line of argument in the belief that if the opponent accepts that, he must\nalso accept the conclusion, is illusory.\n120 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nThe renaissance thinker Lorenzo Valla, a harsh critic of the medieval\nmode of thinking that aimed at logical proof in human or theological\nmatters, made this point eloquently, if perhaps with off-putting belligerence,\nwhen he wrote, in a commentary on the medieval philosopher Boethius:\nWhat is more inept than arguing the way the philosophers do, where, if\none word is wrong, the whole case falls? The orator, on the other hand,\nuses many reasons of various kinds, he brings in opposites, he cites\nexamples, he compares similar phenomena and forces even the hidden\ntruth to appear. How miserable and inept is the general who lets the\nentire outcome of the war depend on the life of one single soldier! The\nfight should be conducted across the whole front, and if one soldier falls,\nor if one squadron is destroyed, others and still others are at hand. This is\nwhat Boethius should have done, but like so many others he was too\ndeep in love with dialectics. (Valla, 1970, p. 113).10\nAll this is well illustrated by the \u201cscales\u201d image. However, even more\ninteresting are certain features of deliberative argumentation that this image\nmisrepresents:\n(5) The decision on a deliberative issue cannot be deductively inferred\nby adding and subtracting the respective weights on the two sides.\nArguments in deliberative debate may lack commensurability, i.e., they\ncannot be put on a common denominator in any binding way. Attempts to\ntally up the relative merits of alternative proposals in an objective fashion,\ne.g., in terms of economic cost and benefit, are thus illusory.\n(6) This is because the weight of each argument is a subjective or\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d property relative to each member of the audience. As\nwe saw, one may acknowledge that fox-hunting has some social value, and\nat the same time feel that the suffering inflicted on the foxes argues against\nfoxhunting with greater weight. But for the person sitting next to you it\nmight be the other way around.\n(7) However, even if there is no binding or formal way to define a\n\u201ccommon denominator\u201d for the pros and cons on a given deliberative issue,\npeople nevertheless may have to decide between the two sides. And\n10 Quid enim ineptius philosophorum more ut si uno verbo sit erratum tota causa\npericlitemur? At orator multis et variis rationibus utitur, affert contraria, exempla repetit,\nsimilitudines comparat et cogit etiam latitantem prodire veritatem. Quam miser ac pauper\nimperator est qui omnem fortunam belli in anima in unius militis ponit! Universitate\npugnandum est et si quis miles concidit aut si qua turma plofligata est, alia subinde atque\nalia sufficienda. Hoc modo agendum Boethio erat, qui ut plurimi alii nimio amore dialectice\ndeceptus est.\n121 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nsomehow they manage. Sometimes they even change sides after listening to\nargumentation. Apparently they do find a way to put the arguments on the\nsame scales and assess which side has more weight. But this cannot be done\nformally; which way the scale tips is, for each person, a\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d property, resulting from the total impact of all the\nrhetorical stimuli which that person has received. In deliberative\nargumentation gravity, too, is relative. Weight in deliberative argumentation\nis a matter of degrees: deliberative arguments are not either valid or invalid,\nbut have more or less weight. Moreover, that weight is relative to the person\nwho judges it, and that person's judgment is influenced by the rhetoric that\nis used to either enhance or reduce that weight. Enhancing the weight of an\nargument is what Aristotle called aux\u0113sis and Latin rhetoricians\namplificatio; reduction is meiosis. The insight that the weight of an\nargument may be enhanced or reduced by degrees, and for each member of\nthe audience individually, is one of the defining features of rhetoric; the\ninsight that arguments belong to many dimensions is another.\nThe very fact of multidimensionality in deliberation, which prevents\ndeduction in any form, also necessitates rhetoric. Deliberative\nargumentation is full of arguments on both sides that all have a certain\nweight\u2014except that their weight is anything but certain or definite, but\nchangeable and relative.\nAn important qualification is in place here. The present account of the\n\u201clogic\u201d of deliberative argumentation does not include the view that any\nargument proffered in any deliberative debate has some weight. The\naccount given here has as its central tenet that arguments in deliberation\nbelong to several dimensions and that this is one reason why deductive\nvalidity is not a relevant yardstick in the evaluation of such arguments.\nHowever, it does not follow from this that no concept of validity should be\napplied, nor that no arguments are ever \u201cinvalid.\u201d An account with such\nimplications would be not only counter-intuitive but also pernicious.\nPragma-dialectics is right in insisting that there is a need for a set of rules\nstating which speech acts are permissible and which are more or less\nblameworthy in a critical exchange. My point of departure has been that at\nleast one of the standard rules of pragma-dialectics, and probably some of\nthe others, must be rewritten if we are to have an adequate and useful tool\nfor modelling deliberative debates. But the normative thrust of the pragma-\ndialectical account must be preserved. Argumentation specialists critically\nneed conceptual tools for the normative monitoring of, and critical\nintervention in, ongoing political and social debates.\n122 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\nConstruction of a conceptual basis for such practically oriented\nmonitoring and intervention is well under way among argumentation\nspecialists belonging to many orientations, such as pragma-dialectics,\ninformal logic, and others. These efforts ought to be coordinated and\nstrengthened. However, theoretical views which overlook the\nmultidimensionality of social and political debate and which hold, e.g., that\nsome form of deductive validity is an applicable value criterion, impede the\neffort to build a platform for the normative criticism of public debate.\nIndeed, I believe that one of the main categories of blameworthy debate\nbehaviour is the tendency on the part of politicians and other debaters to\nsuggest that an argument of theirs entails a certain policy with deductive\nvalidity; or, in a looser formulation, a tendency to say or suggest that their\nown arguments have stronger force than is warranted. Typically we find\ndebaters behaving as if it was the case that because the policy they propose\nmay have this or that advantage, it therefore follows that it should be\nadopted. The point in such cases is precisely what has been the main point\nof this article: that an argument for a policy may be perfectly good, yet this\nis not equivalent to saying that the adoption of that policy follows\ndeductively. This distinction is overlooked by theories committed to\ndeductive validity in any form.\nSimilarly, the idea that the other side may have legitimate arguments of\nsome weight seems abhorrent to many politicians. This might be the\ncommon denominator for another main category of blameworthy debate\nbehaviour: the tendency to ignore, misrepresent or offhandedly dismiss any\nargument that can be made against one's own policies, or in favour of those\nof the opponent. Many citizens, by contrast, probably believe that on most\ncontested issues, there is in fact something to be said on both sides. Such\nvoters will want to know what it is and to get a chance to evaluate the\nrelative merits of all reasonable arguments. Politicians who flatly deny or\nignore that the opposition may have a point, maintaining that their own\npolicies are unassailable, are not credible in such citizens\u2019 eyes, and they\nprobably help promote the kind of democratic cynicism reflected in, e.g.,\ndwindling election turnouts.\nArgumentation theory should teach would-be deliberative debaters to\nacknowledge legitimate arguments on the opposite side. They would\nprobably be more willing to do so if it were also made clear that the\nacceptance of some of the opponent\u2019s arguments does not deductively entail\na commitment to the opponent's proposals or policies. In accordance with\nthis principle, argumentation specialists should keep a vigilant eye on\n123 Multidimensionality and Non-Deductiveness in Deliberative Argumentation\ndebaters who tend to suppress or misrepresent arguments made by the\nopponent; this is something pragma-dialectics has always emphasized, and\nrightly so. And they should show that the necessary function of deliberative\ndebate is to identify, in Aristotle\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe available means of\npersuasion\u201d (cf. Rhetoric 1355b) on both sides, thereby helping audiences\nform their own individual assessments of their relative weight. This would\nin turn help democracies sustain the credibility of political processes\ncurrently threatened by polarization, non-participation, and cynicism.\nREFERENCES\nAlexy, R. 1978.

This is exemplified with the argument theories of\nToulmin, pragma-dialectics, Habermas, Walton, and Perelman. Since\nantiquity, rhetoric has defined itself, not as argument designed to \u201cwin,\u201d\nbut as action-oriented argument. Several distinctive features of action-\noriented argument are identified. One is that its warrants include value\nconcepts in audiences, implying an element of subjectivity in argument\nassessment. Between individuals, but also inside each individual, several\nconflicting value dimensions are typically involved, not just the dimension\nof truth-falsity, which makes sustained, reasonable dissensus inevitable.\nAll those of us who are interested in the theory of argumentation cannot\nand should not try to describe all kinds of argumentation with one model or\none theory. I believe that numerous misunderstandings and mistakes which\nargumentation theorists have been guilty of, in the past as well as today, can\nbe put down to a misguided attempt to develop one great theory that is\nsupposed to account for all the essential characteristics of all argumentation.\nIt is not that there is anything wrong per se with such strong and\ncomprehensive theories of an entire domain. It would be wonderful to have\none if it worked. But such theories rarely do; nevertheless we often let them\nmislead us into making naive initial assumptions which we cling to and do\nnot really question or investigate because we are too busy working on our\ntheory so that it may be thought to cover the entire domain.\nTo be more specific, I will claim that there are certain fundamental\ndifferences between argumentation about what is true, on the one hand, and\n* Originally published in Cogency 1 (2009), 89-112. Reprinted with permission of the\npublisher. Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\non the other hand, argumentation about what to do. Philosophers since\nAristotle have designated this same difference with the terms theoretical\nreasoning vs. practical reasoning. Historically, philosophers have been\npredominantly concerned with theoretical reason, but at least many of them\nhave been aware of this difference. Arguably, however, many thinkers and\neducators who have made argumentation their chief interest have tended to\nforget this difference in their eagerness to cover the whole domain of\nargumentation with one theory.\nI will first comment briefly on a few of the leading theories and theorists\nof argumentation. My view is that what each of these has given us is\nessentially either a theory that applies well to theoretical argumentation, or\na theory that applies well to practical argumentation. But all of them have\nbelieved that one grand theory could encompass the essential features of\nargumentation as such; none have thought that here were fundamental\ndifferences between theoretical and practical argumentation. Hence, they\nhave done little to explore these differences. I will try to do a little more.\nThe argumentation theory of Stephen Toulmin, centered on the famous\nargument model (Toulmin 1958), is a case in point. The model has been\nused to map and to teach all kinds of argumentation, whether theoretical or\npractical, and perhaps especially practical argumentation, since that is what\nstudents in schools and colleges most call for and need. This has been done,\nalso by Toulmin himself (cf. Toulmin et al., 1979), despite the fact that\nToulmin's theory and model were primarily meant to elucidate\nargumentation as it occurs in science and scholarship. That becomes clear\nwhen we read The Uses of Argument in the context of those of Toulmin\u2019s\nother writings (e.g., 1961, 1985, 1990, 2001), whose focus is his campaign\nagainst the Cartesian idea of deductive certainty and universality as criteria\nfor reasoning in all scientific fields. Instead, Toulmin argues that each\nscience, each field, has its own rules and warrants; hence there are many\ndifferent kinds and degrees of validity in reasoning, depending on field. On\nthe other hand, it is arguably a common feature of scientific and scholarly\nreasoning in any field that its basic building blocks are those found in\nToulmin\u2019s famous model: claims, grounds, warrants, backing, qualifiers and\nrebuttals. If so, the model captures essential features of any true piece of\nacademic reasoning, including those attempted by students in papers and\ntheses, etc. And thus the most natural educational use of the model is in the\nteaching of academic writing.\nThis claim (which has been developed in Hegelund and Kock, 2000,\n2003) may be supported with a few examples of how the model usefully\n127 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nillustrates, on the one hand, the way academic writing in a given field, in\norder to qualify as such, ought to contain instantiations of the six\nelementary components of argument; on the other hand, for each theoretical\nfield, how the instantiations of them will be different. For instance, in\nhistorical scholarship an argument will typically use so-called sources as\ngrounds to argue for a claim about the past. The warrant here will typically\nbe what historians call source criticism (Quellenkritik, as Leopold von\nRanke called it). Warranted by proper source criticism, historical data will\ngive a certain kind and degree of validity to a claim. The theoretical backing\nfor these warrants has been formulated by Ranke and other thinkers who\nhave theorized about historical method.\nAnother example: in quantitative fields where statistical tests and the\nlike are used as grounds for a claim, the warrants that confer a specific kind\nand degree of validity on them consist in statements about the internal and\nexternal validity of the samples and other aspects of study design, about the\nappropriateness of the tests used, etc. Backing for these warrants is supplied\nby theoretical thinking, much of it developed by Sir Ronald Fisher and later\nscholars in statistics. In all scholarly fields, we must also have qualifiers,\nrebuttals and other types of discussion of reasonable objections, etc. So the\nToulmin model well reflects what is expected of scholarly argument in a\ngiven field, while also allowing for the differences between concepts and\nnorms of validity across fields.\nBut by the same token it is also clear that Toulmin\u2019s model is less well\nfit to represent what we call practical argumentation, i.e., arguments about\nwhat to do. For one thing, such reasoning typically does not discuss its own\nwarrants; the explicit discussion of warrants, possibly with backing and all\nthe rest, is precisely what sets academic reasoning apart. Students given the\nToulmin model in order to analyze a piece of everyday practical reasoning\nwill often look in vain for these typically academic elements, and they may\nthen, in frustration, endow a more or less arbitrary sentence in the text with\nthe status of \u201cwarrant.\u201d This illustrates our general thesis: theoretical\nreasoning is a species apart; taking a model meant to capture the essential\nfeatures of theoretical reasoning in science and scholarship and expecting it\nto perform as well in practical and everyday argumentation is problematic.\nIt may be objected that much of Toulmin\u2019s later thinking (in particular in\nJonsen & Toulmin, 1988, as well as several smaller works, such as 1981)\ndoes focus on a distinction between theoretical and practical reason. This is\nparticularly so where Toulmin engages questions of medical ethics; here,\ntheoretical and practical reason are described as \u201ctwo very different\n128 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\naccounts of ethics and morality: one that seeks eternal, invariable principles,\nthe practical implications of which can be free of exception or\nqualifications, and another which pays closest attention to the specific\ndetails of particular moral cases and circumstances\u201d (Jonsen & Toulmin,\n1988, p. 2). Notice again Toulmin\u2019s persistent anti-universalist stance in the\nrejection of \u201cinvariable principles\u201d and his respect for \u201cparticular moral\ncases\u201d and \u201ccasuistry\u201d (a term that inspired the book\u2019s title); but where the\nemphasis in The Uses of Argument was on the distinctness of warrants in\neach cognitive field, the distinction that he and Jonsen now draw\naccentuates the individual case where action must be decided on. Warrants\naccording to the 1958 model, while field-dependent, are general and cannot\nprovide decisions in the hard cases that, e.g., medical ethics encounters.\nOne reason why this is so is that specific cases cannot always be subsumed\nwith certainty under any given principle (or warrant): \u201cpresumptive\nconclusions can have \u2018certitude\u2019 only when the relevance of the concepts or\nterms involved is not in doubt\u201d (1988, p. 327). Another difficulty is that in\nany given case, several principles (warrants) may be relevant\nsimultaneously, requiring reasoners to \u201cstrike equitable balances between\nvaried considerations in ways relevant to the details of each particular set of\ncircumstances\u201d (1988, p. 306). The existence, in practical reasoning, of\nconflicting considerations that are simultaneously valid is, as we shall see\nbelow, a major difference between practical and theoretical reasoning. In\nfact Toulmin had been aware of these kinds of difficulties ever since his\nfirst book, An Examination of the Place of Reason in Ethics (1950), which\nhas, for example, the following statement: \u201cGiven two conflicting claims \u2026\none has to weigh up, as well as one can, the risks involved in ignoring\neither, and choose \u2018the lesser of two evils.\u2019 Appeal to a single current\nprinciple, though the primary test of the rightness of an action, cannot\ntherefore be relied upon as a universal test: where this fails, we are driven\nback upon our estimate of the probable consequences\u201d (1950, p. 147). But\nthe fact remains that the theory and model for which he is most famous\nbelong to a line of thought and a segment of his career where his overriding\nconcern was the field-dependency of warrants in theoretical reasoning.\nPragma-dialectics (most recently and authoritatively set forth in van\nEemeren and Grootendorst, 2004) is another influential theory in our time\nwhich has the advantage of capturing features (or rather: norms) of\ntheoretical argument\u2014yet I argue that it too has problems with practical\nargument. One of its main tenets is that argumentation is always in principle\na critical discussion between a protagonist and an antagonist, where the\n129 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nprotagonist seeks to defend a thesis against the antagonist\u2019s objections and\ncritical questions. This view is inspired by the critical rationalism of Karl\nPopper and provides a useful model of the way academic argumentation\nought to proceed. Another tenet is that the goal of critical discussion is\nalways to resolve a difference of opinion between protagonist and\nantagonist, i.e., to reach consensus. This too reflects the way things ought\nideally to be in scholarly discussion, because scholarly discussion is\nessentially theoretical argumentation. But for practical argumentation this\nmodel does not hold, as we shall see.\nAn important thinker about argumentation who has received too little\nattention from argumentation theorists is J\u00fcrgen Habermas. He, unlike the\npragma-dialecticians, is strongly aware of differences between various\ntypes of claims that people may argue for. In what we call practical\nargumentation we do not argue, as Habermas makes clear, about the truth of\npropositions, but about actions, and so the warrants that we appeal to are\nnot propositions that we hold to be true, but norms of action that we hold to\nbe right. The rightness of certain norms is a very different kind of validity\nclaim (G\u00fcltigkeitsbedingung, as Habermas calls it) from the truth that\nvalidates constative speech acts. And both are different from the sincerity\nthat validates expressive self-representations and from the adequacy of\nvalue standards that validates evaluative expressions.\nArgumentation theorists would do well to heed the distinctions that\nHabermas lays down here. Of particular importance in this context is\nHabermas\u2019 insistence that the validity claim of a proposal for action is not\nthe truth of a premiss but rightness according to some norm. However, his\nmain thrust is to say that even though a proposal for action makes a\ndifferent kind of validity claim, it is still subject to a \u201ccommunicative\nrationality\u201d whose goal is for the discussants to reach consensus on right\naction thanks to the paradoxical \u201cunforced force of the better argument.\u201d\nSo, regarding the orientation towards consensus, Habermas essentially\nholds the same view as the pragma-dialecticians and sees no difference\nbetween the various types of speech act that he has defined. He sums up his\ntheory as follows:\n\u2026 actions regulated by norms, expressive self-representations, and\nalso evaluative expressions, supplement constative speech acts in\nconstituting a communicative practice which, against the background of\na lifeworld, is oriented to achieving, sustaining, and renewing\nconsensus\u2014and indeed a consensus that rests on the intersubjective\nrecognition of criticizable validity claims. (1997, p. 17).\n130 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nHabermas, in his thinking about communicative action, anticipated the\npragma-dialecticians by insisting that argumentation should be guided by\ncertain procedural rules of reasonableness or rational communication; these\nrules exist to ensure that the speech acts performed by discussants do not\nobstruct the inherent goal of the argumentative dialogue: consensus; and\nthey primarily require that discussants are under no force or constraint\nexcept the paradoxical \u201cunforced force of the better argument.\u201d\nAccording to Habermas all this should equally be the case in theoretical\nargumentation and in practical argumentation. But while there is certainly a\nneed for norms of reasonableness in practical argumentation, for example in\npublic political debate, it does not follow that the goal of such debates is or\nshould be consensus, nor that the compliance with such norms will lead\ntowards consensus. In taking this view, one confronts formidable opposition\namong present-day thinkers. Not only is there the pragma-dialectical school\nand the many argumentation theorists who tend to go along with it; in\naddition, a broad range of political, philosophical and rhetorical thinkers in\nour time who have attempted to ground the legitimacy of democracy in\ndeliberation and debate have assumed that the inherent aim of deliberation\nis consensus. Besides Habermas, this includes, in various ways, political\ntheorists like Joshua Cohen (e.g., 1989, 1993, 1998), Joseph Bessette\n(1994), and Seyla Benhabib (e.g., 1994, 1996), or a rhetorician like Thomas\nGoodnight (e.g., 1993).\nWhat unites all these theories is the idea that in practical argumentation\nas well as in theoretical argumentation, if we have a truly rational, critical\ndiscussion, we will eventually or at least tendentially approach a resolution\nto our difference of opinion; in these theories, the right action exists as a\npotential inference from the accepted premisses and the agreed rules of\nreasonable discussion.\nAnother version of a theory that sees practical argumentation as merely a\nspecial kind of inference has been proposed by Douglas Walton. As one of\nthe few philosophical argumentation theorists today, Walton recognizes\npractical argumentation as a separate domain (Walton, 1990; 1996a, pp. 11-\n13, 176-180; 1996b; 1997b). What many other theorists have overlooked is\nthe simple fact that in practical reasoning people argue about an action, not\nabout a proposition or assertion. But my objection to Walton\u2019s analysis is\nthat he never decisively abandons the assumption that practical reasoning is\nabout propositions, and so he never questions the assumption that what we\nargue for in practical reasoning follows as a conclusion or inference from a\nproperly applied argument scheme, the way a proposition follows from its\n131 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\npremisses by inference. Consider the following formulations: \u201cIn a practical\ninference, the conclusion is an imperative that directs the agent to a prudent\ncourse of action\u201d (1996a, p. 11); \u201cit concludes in an imperative that directs\nthe agent to a course of action\u201d (1990, p. xi). Here we have, as in\npropositional logic, the notions of \u201cinference\u201d and of a \u201cconclusion,\u201d as\nwell as two additional indications of the binding nature of this conclusion: it\nis an imperative which directs. Walton's model of practical reasoning, and\nhence also of how to evaluate arguments in that domain, is an inference\nmodel: what to do follows as an inference. However, as Walton has\nemphasized in many contexts, the inference in practical argumentation is\npresumptive or defeasible. If there is a good argument for doing something,\nit follows that we should do it\u2014unless there are other considerations which\nthen cancel out the argument. It is, as he would say, subject to defeat; what\nwas a valid argument becomes defeated or invalid. In other words, a good\nargument in practical argumentation is good if the conclusion follows from\nit\u2014presumptively, that is.\nAlthough Walton has done much to elucidate practical argumentation,\nthis is a serious problem in his theory: arguments in practical argumentation\neither trigger an inference, or they are invalidated. I shall argue that\npractical argumentation is not like that (for a fuller version of this critique,\nsee Kock 2007).\nTo be sure, a recent development in Walton\u2019s work on practical\nargumentation (see, e.g., Walton 2006) takes a long step towards repairing\nthe shortcomings of his earlier conception. In particular, he now clearly\nrecognizes that the conclusion in what he calls \u201cdeliberation dialogue\u201d is a\nproposal, not a proposition, and that a proposal is a distinctive kind of\nspeech act, of which he then presents a careful analysis. Also, the same\npaper contains, among other things, a valuable overview of the criteria and\ncritical questions that may be invoked in deliberation dialogue and in the\nevaluation of it. The dependence of deliberation on values is theorized, and\nso is the existence of simultaneous pro and con arguments. However, the\npaper does not recognize that the notions of inference and presumption in\ndeliberation are called into question by this new approach, and most of the\ndistinctive features of argumentation in deliberation dialogue which will be\ndiscussed below, and all of which are corollaries of the basic properties just\nmentioned, remain largely unaddressed.\nThe last leading theorist I will mention in this overview is Cha\u00efm\nPerelman. He differs from all the others in the sense that what his theory is\nreally about is practical argumentation. This is not quite clear in The New\n132 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nRhetoric (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca 1969), which often claims to be a\ntheory of all argumentation. This work is somewhat vague on the\ndistinction between argumentation for truth and argumentation for action,\nand hence it repeatedly describes argumentation, the domain of rhetoric, as\nwhat we do to gain \u201cadherence to a thesis.\u201d But in Perelman\u2019s later writings\n(e.g., 1979, which is titled \u201cThe New Rhetoric: A Theory of Practical\nReasoning\u201d) he is more explicit that what he is concerned with is indeed\n\u201cpractical reason\u201d \u2013 defined as \u201cthe actual process of deliberation that leads\nto decision making in practical fields such as politics, law, and morals\u201d\n(1083) or as \u201cfinding good reasons to justify a decision\u201d (1099). He even\nstates explicitly that \u201cit is highly unlikely that any reasoning from which we\ncould draw reasons for acting could be conducted under the sign of truth\u201d\n(1086).\nWhen Perelman defines rhetoric or argumentation as reasoning about\nactions decisions, he is in unison with the dominant rhetorical tradition\nitself. For Aristotle, what we do in rhetoric is to deliberate, \u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, and\nhe makes it clear that \u201cthe subjects of deliberation are clear; and these are\nwhatever, by their nature, are within our power and of which the inception\nlies with us,\u201d in other words, what we may decide to do. The same idea is\nstated repeatedly in his ethical writings: \u201cWe deliberate about things that\nare in our control and are attainable by action\u201d (1112a). A similar\ndemarcation of the realm of rhetoric occurs in most of the later sources,\nsuch as the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which states: \u201cThe task of the public\nspeaker is to discuss capably those matters which law and custom have\nfixed for the uses of citizenship,\u201d or Boethius, to whom the subject matter\nof rhetoric is explicitly \u201cthe political question.\u201d (A fuller discussion of the\naction-based definition of rhetorical argument in the rhetorical tradition\nitself is found in Kock 2009.)\nWe may note here that most modern argumentation theorists who have\ndiscussed rhetoric have misunderstood what the classical conception of\nrhetoric is. They see rhetoric as that kind of argumentation where the main\nobject is to win the discussion, not to find the truth. But rhetoricians\nprimarily define their discipline as concerned with argument about actions;\nand that is why, in a sense, rhetorical argumentation is unconcerned with\ntruth, since actions are neither true nor false.\nWhat we have seen now is that a series of leading thinkers in the field of\nargumentation are all guilty of a hasty generalization: they all believe either\nthat all argumentation works pretty much along the lines of theoretical\nargumentation, or (in the case of Perelman in The New Rhetoric) the other\n133 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nway around. I will now try to point out some deep differences between\nthese two basic domains.\nWe may start with the well-known observation that practical\nargumentation so often leaves out explicit statements of the warrant and its\nbacking. This is because the grounds we give in practical reasoning for a\nproposed action are typically different from those used in theoretical\nargumentation. These grounds are generally alleged advantages of doing\nthe action or alleged drawbacks of not doing it. And an advantage relies for\nits warrant on something we assume is already present in our audience: a\nvalue concept we believe we share with that audience. If we say that a given\nplan will bring peace to the Middle East, we take for granted that our\naudience values peace in the Middle East, and peace generally. If a friend or\nfamily member suggests that we watch a DVD of the film American Pie\ntonight, we might argue against this by saying that American Pie is vulgar,\nthereby taking for granted that the circle of friends or family members share\na negative valuation of vulgarity. In other words, the ultimate warrants in\npractical argumentation are value concepts, and these we often assume are\nalready present in our interlocutors, so that we do not have to establish\nthem, not even make them explicit.\nThis is why practical reasoning about worldly concerns is full of\nenthymemes. That is Aristotle\u2019s term for a premiss which is assumed to be\npresent in the hearer\u2019s mind\u2014and just that is the original meaning of the\nword. The feature that an enthymeme is often left unexpressed is not\nessential (for an authoritative statement of this view, see Burnyeat 1996).\nAn enthymeme is something which is already in the thymos, i.e., \u201cin the\nsoul,\u201d of the hearer.\nSo warrants in practical argumentation are value concepts located in\naudiences. From this follows another fact which some theorists find\nscandalous (notably the pragma-dialecticians, in several statements),\nnamely that these warrants are subjective: they vary across individuals.\nSome individuals might think that vulgarity, although quite bad, is not such\na bad thing, so they might agree to watch a film which has some vulgarity\nin it if it also has other, redeeming qualities. Others again might actually\nfind that the kind of vulgarity to be found in American Pie is in fact\nappealing, not appalling.\nAnother example illustrating the same point, but this time on the level of\nnational policy, might be laws which curtail people\u2019s right to privacy in\norder to promote security against terrorism. Some individuals might resent\nsuch laws, feeling that their loss of privacy far outweighs the alleged gain in\n134 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nsecurity; but others might have it the other way around. This shows that\ndifferent individuals may not endorse the warrants invoked in practical\nargumentation with the same degree of strength. The strength of the value\nconcepts on which practical argumentation relies for its warrants is\nsubjective; in a slightly less provocative term, it is audience-relative. This is\na fundamental fact in practical argumentation, yet several leading thinkers\nin state-of-the-art argumentation theory have failed to recognize it and have\nroundly condemned those theorists, notably Perelman, who have provided a\nplace of honour in their theories for this fact. (We can now see that the\nreason Perelman provided a place for it is that his theory is really about\npractical argumentation, whereas the theory of his harshest critics\u2014the\npragma-dialecticians\u2014is really about theoretical argumentation.) The\nfailure to recognize this is one instance of the grave misunderstandings\ncaused by an underlying failure to respect the distinction between\ntheoretical and practical reasoning.\nAlthough value concepts are not held with equal strength by all\nindividuals, it is probably true that most people in a culture do have most of\ntheir value concepts in common. Yet each individual probably also holds\nsome values not shared by a majority. And just as importantly, we have\nseen that they do not agree on the relative priorities between the values that\nthey do share.\nYet another complication is that the set of values held by a given\nindividual, and even that subset of these values which is shared by\npractically everyone in the culture, are not necessarily in harmony with each\nother. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has talked about the \u201cpluralism\u201d of\nvalues, meaning that \u201cnot all good things are compatible, still less all the\nideals of mankind.\u201d For example, he points out \u201cthat neither political\nequality nor efficient organization nor social justice is compatible with\nmore than a modicum of individual liberty, and certainly not with\nunrestricted laissez-faire; that justice and generosity, public and private\nloyalties, the demands of genius and the claims of society can conflict\nviolently with each other\u201d (1958, repr. 1998, p. 238).\nOf course this is something that ordinary human beings have always\nknown in an intuitive way. Practical philosophers, such as Cicero, who was\na rhetorician as well, have known it too. He writes:\n\u2026 between those very actions which are morally right, a conflict and\ncomparison may frequently arise, as to which of two actions is morally\nbetter\u2014a point overlooked by Panaetius. For, since all moral rectitude\nsprings from four sources (one of which is prudence; the second, social\n135 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\ninstinct; the third, courage; the fourth, temperance), it is often necessary\nin deciding a question of duty that these virtues be weighed against one\nanother. (De officiis 1.63.152.)\nBut philosophers, beginning with Plato and including many in recent\ndecades who have become argumentation theorists, tend to theorize as if all\nvalues were compatible and did not clash. Or at least as if the lack of\ncompatibility between them was no real problem. They tend to think, for\nexample, that if we can agree that something is good, then it follows that we\nmust have it, or do it. Philosophers have concentrated on figuring out what\nit meant for a thing to be good, and on arguing about what things are truly\ngood in a general sense, and have given less thought to situations where\nmany different things are indeed good, but where we cannot have them all\nat the same time. However, this is a kind of situation we face every day in\nour lives.\nTrue enough, some philosophers have indeed worked on this issue, but\ntheir thinking has either run along the lines of Plato\u2019s insistence that virtue\nand well-being are in fact one and the same value, or they have, like Jeremy\nBentham and John Stuart Mill, believed that they could order all human\naction by applying the rule of the greatest happiness for the greatest\npossible number. That would indeed be convenient, but it would require\nwhat Mill calls a \u201ccommon umpire\u201d to settle the claims between the\nincompatible values. In other words, there would have to be a universally\nagreed common unit or denominator so that the advantages a given action\nmight have in regard to a certain value might be objectively converted into\nhappiness and weighed against the unhappiness caused by the drawbacks\nthe action might have in regard to another value; for example, for\nlegislation involving an invasion of privacy, that drawback would have be\nobjectively measured against the alleged advantage of reducing the risk of\nterrorist acts, and increasing the chance of solving terrorist crimes to a\ncertain unknown degree. Unfortunately, and obviously, such a common\ndenominator does not exist and could never be constructed; the very\nconstruction of it would be just as controversial as the debatable legislation\nitself. What we cannot do is what the philosopher John Finnis describes in\nthe following words: \u201cAggregate the pluses, subtract the minuses, and\npursue the option with the highest balance\u201d (1998, p. 216). It is impossible\nbecause the relevant arguments in any practical issue usually belong to\ndifferent dimensions. There is no common denominator or unit by which\nthey can all be objectively compared and computed. They are, to use a\nmathematical term, incommensurable.\n136 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nSo we have at least three fundamental reasons why practical\nargumentation works in a different way from theoretical argumentation:\nThere is, first, the subjectivity of the value concepts which are the necessary\nwarrants when we discuss what actions to take; secondly, there is the\nincompatibility of all human values, and thirdly, we now also face what\nsome recent philosophers have recently called their ultimate\nincommensurability (see, e.g., Griffin 1977, Raz 1998, Finnis 1998). There\nis no objective or philosophical way to compute the advantages and\ndrawbacks of proposed human actions and weigh them up against each\nother.\nThis does not mean that all possible actions are equally good, or that\nthere is no point in discussing what to do, or in choosing one action over\nanother. What it means is merely that we have no objective method of\ncalculating what to choose. In fact, if we had such a method, we would\nhave no choice; our \u201cchoices\u201d would be made for us beforehand. Choice\nmeans precisely that we may legitimately elect to do either one thing or\nanother. But that there is choice surely does not mean that we might as well\nnot choose anything, or that there is no reason to debate our upcoming\nchoices. The point is that each individual has the right to choose, and that\nno one has the right or the authority to choose on everyone\u2019s behalf. Nor is\nthere any way for philosophy to determine in a compelling manner (i.e., by\ninference) what the right policy is.\nYet individuals must choose, and choice makes it desirable that they\nhave in fact balanced or weighed the advantages and drawbacks of the\npossible decisions facing them or their society. Now this \u201cweighing\u201d\nprocess, while it is not possible in an objective or inter-subjective way, is\nstill necessary and possible for the individual. The balancing process in\nmatters where a body of individuals must choose between actions within\ntheir power is called deliberation. This is an appropriate term, since it\ncomes from the Latin word libra, meaning a pair of scales. Given the\nindividual\u2019s value concepts (which we remember are in principle\nsubjective) and the choices as they appear to him, one of the alternatives\nmay eventually, after weighing the advantages and drawbacks, appear\npreferable to him. The same alternative may not appear preferable to his\nneighbour, or to the majority of citizens. But then the individual is free to\ntry to influence his neighbours so that they may eventually come around\nand see things his way. This kind of influence is usually exerted by means\nof language and is called rhetoric.\n137 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nThe three distinctive features of practical argumentation just\nenumerated: the subjectivity of the values on which it depends, their\nincompatibility, and their incommensurability, as well as the approach to\nthese notions taken in the rhetorical tradition, have been more fully\ndiscussed in Kock (2003) and Kock (2007).\nWe may now look at some distinctive features of practical\nargumentation not captured by models or theories designed for theoretical\nargumentation. Let us remember the categorical difference between what\nwe argue about in the two domains. Theoretical argumentation is about\npropositions that may be true or false. Practical argumentation is about what\nto do, and whatever we do does not have the property of being true or false.\nWe argue about proposals, not propositions.\nFirst, the status of reasons is different in the two domains. Practical pro\nand con reasons, as we saw, represent advantages and drawbacks of\ncompeting policies; they remain valid and are not made invalid even if one\npolicy is chosen over another. We choose a given policy because we place a\nhigh value on its alleged advantages, but the possible drawbacks inherent in\nthat policy do not lose their validity or cease to exist.\nLet us take one simple example drawn from the micro-politics of family\nlife. One family member, let us call him F, wants to buy a large Chesterfield\narmchair for the family room. He argues that such a chair is highly\ncomfortable and suitable for TV watching and generally chilling out.\nAnother family member, let us call her M, strongly opposes the plan. She\nagrees that such a chair is comfortable, but argues that it is ugly, heavy and\nvery expensive indeed. F happens to acknowledge these drawbacks but\nthinks that the expected comfort to be had in the chair outweighs them. M\nthinks they do not.\nThe example shows how the primary pro and con reasons in deliberative\nargumentation have the status of advantages and drawbacks as perceived by\nthe arguers. Notice that both F and M may well agree on all the advantages\nand drawbacks of the chair. For both of them, they are inherent in the plan\nto buy the chair. However, they disagree on how much weight to assign to\nthem. And no advantages or drawbacks are refuted even if one plan\nconclusively defeats the other. If the scheme is conclusively abandoned, the\narmchair does not cease to be comfortable. If the family actually buys the\nchair, it remains heavy and expensive. (It is a little different with the alleged\nugliness of the chair. Ugliness is an aesthetic quality, and aesthetic\nargumentation is a category in itself with intricacies which we will not get\ninvolved with at the moment.)\n138 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nIn theoretical argumentation, by contrast, pro and con reasons are only\nimportant by virtue of their probative or inferential force (or, with a word\nused by informal logicians and derived from the same verb as \u201cinferential\u201d:\ntheir illative force); that is, they are important for what may perhaps be\ninferred from them, i.e., what they point to, signify or suggest, not for what\nthey are. Once the issue has been decided one way or the other, the reasons\nsupporting the discarded position lose their relevance. For example, until a\nfew years ago doctors used to believe that ulcers were caused by stress and\nacidity; when two Australian doctors, Marshall and Warren, in papers in the\nearly 1980\u2019s, suggested that ulcers were caused by bacteria (later named\nHeliobacter pylori), they were generally disbelieved. The bacteria known\naround 1980 could not survive in the acidic environment of the stomach;\nthis seemed to suggest that no bacteria could survive there, hence ulcers\ncould not be caused by bacteria. However, it was soon found that certain\nbacteria, including the heliobacter, could indeed survive in the stomach.\nThus the illative force of the original reasons was simply cancelled; it lost\nits validity. Marshall and Warren\u2019s theory is now generally accepted; they\nreceived the Nobel Prize in 2005, and millions of patients have been cured\nof their ulcers. This example shows how the relevance of facts used as\nreasons in theoretical reasoning resides in what these facts point to, signify\nor suggest, that is, in their illative force, not in those facts themselves.\nSecond, we see that in practical argumentation both pro and con reasons\nmay be relevant simultaneously. In other words, the advantages and\ndrawbacks indicated by the pro and con reasons may be real and remain so.\nIn theoretical argumentation the pro and con reasons may also be real in\nthemselves, but the two opposite states of affairs supported by the pro\nreasons and the con reasons, respectively, may not both be real\nsimultaneously.\nThird, this means that in practical argumentation no party can be\nlogically proven to be either right or wrong. This is tantamount to saying\nthat reasons in practical argumentation can never in principle be \u201cvalid\u201d in\nthe traditional sense of entailing their conclusion, nor can they be\n\u201csufficient\u201d to entail a conclusion. No reasons in practical argumentation\nentail the proposals for which they argue. No reasons are \u201csufficient.\u201d No\nmatter how many reasons you may muster for your proposal, your opponent\nis never compelled by those reasons to accept it. Put another way, in\npractical argumentation all reasons are, in principle, weights among other\nweights on a pair of scales. This means that in practical argumentation a set\nof reasons P1 through Pn may very well be both true, relevant and weighty,\n139 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nand yet the conclusion (i.e., the proposal for which they argue) is not \u201ctrue\u201d\n(as we have noted, proposals cannot be true or false), nor does it follow by\nany kind of inference or entailment. Whether or not to accept the proposal is\na matter of choice for each individual audience member. In theoretical\nargumentation, conclusive inferences do exist, and scholars and scientists\nare trying to find them all the time. The theory that no bacteria can live for\nlong in an acidic environment like our stomach has been conclusively\nrefuted.\nFourth, the strength or weight of reasons in practical argumentation is a\nmatter of degrees. Advantages and drawbacks come in all sizes. Along with\nthis comes the fact that practical argumentation typically persuades by\ndegrees. An individual may gradually attribute more weight to a given\nreason, so he or she may gradually become more favorably disposed\ntowards the proposal. Not so in theoretical argumentation. A medical\nscientist is not free to say that the existence of heliobacter in the stomach\ncarries little weight in regard to whether bacteria can live in that kind of\nenvironment.\nFifth, in practical argumentation arguers should have no problem in\ngranting that their opponents may have relevant reasons. The drawbacks\nthat my opponent sees in my proposal may in fact be relevant, just as the\nadvantages that I see in it, and the ones that my opponent sees in his\nproposal. Arguers may be more prone to adopt this attitude when they\nrealize that just because you acknowledge the relevance of an opponent\u2019s\nreasons, this does not entail that you adopt his proposal. In theoretical\nargumentation one reason against a thesis may defeat it. Unfortunately\npublic debaters seem to believe this is also the case in practical\nargumentation, and so they tend to deny that their opponents have any\nrelevant reasons at all, even when they patently do.\nSixth, this brings us to a crucial difference between practical\nargumentation and theoretical argumentation. As the armchair example\nshows, two opponents in practical argumentation will not necessarily tend\ntowards consensus, let alone reach it, even if they follow all the rules we\nmay devise for responsible and rational discussion. They may legitimately\nsupport contradictory proposals, and continue to do so even after prolonged\ndiscussion.\nIn theoretical argumentation, prolonged and rule-obeying discussion\nmust eventually or tendentially lead to consensus. Doctors who believe that\nbacteria cause the majority of ulcers and doctors who believe that they don\u2019t\ncannot both be right. But one of the parties has to be right. There is a truth\n140 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nsomewhere about the matter, and the goal is to find it. So prolonged\ndisagreement in, e.g., medical science over an issue like that is an unstable\nand unsatisfactory state.\nRules of critical discussion, as we find them in particular in pragma-\ndialectics, are devised to ensure that discussions proceed toward the goal\nwhich pragma-dialecticians as well as Habermas and his followers postulate\nfor them: a resolution of the difference of opinion, or in another word:\nconsensus.\nWe should have such rules by all means. We all know the depths to\nwhich public political argumentation often descends. But again, individuals\nmay legitimately differ over some practical proposal, and continue to do so,\neven after a prolonged discussion that follows all the rules. This is due to\nthe fact that although most norms in a culture are shared by most of its\nmembers, not all their norms are the same, and furthermore everyone does\nnot subscribe to the same hierarchy of norms. In other words, as we saw in\nthe armchair example, for some people an appeal to one norm carries more\nweight than an appeal to another norm, whereas for another individual it is\nthe other way around\u2014even when they in fact share both norms. Hence\nthey may never reach consensus on what to do, no matter how reasonably\nthey argue.\nSo in practical argumentation consensus is not the inherent goal, and it\nbecomes legitimate, in a sense not accounted for by Habermas, for both\nindividuals in such a discussion to argue in order to achieve success for his\nor her proposal, rather than consensus. In deliberation, dissensus is not an\nanomaly to be corrected. Instead of trying to prove the opponent wrong the\nwise deliberative debater will often acknowledge that the opponent has\nsome relevant reasons, but nevertheless try to make his own reasons\noutweigh them in the view of those who are to judge. This kind of discourse\nis the essence of rhetoric.\nSeventh: The last characteristic of practical argumentation we shall look\nat has to do with what we just saw. In practical argumentation arguers argue\nin order to persuade individually. The weight of each reason is assessed\nsubjectively by each individual arguer and spectator, and each individual\nmust also subjectively assess the aggregate weight of all the relevant\nreasons; it follows from this that what will persuade one individual will not\nnecessarily persuade another. In theoretical argumentation, by contrast,\nthere is an underlying presumption that whatever is valid for one is valid for\nall. Admittedly, it is also a fact that a theoretical proposition will only be\naccepted by some, not by all; but the presumption of any philosophical\n141 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\ntheory is that it is presents a truth which is valid for all. Practical arguers\nmake no such presumption, but hope to persuade some individuals to adopt\nthe proposal they support. That is also why we tend to have a vote on\npractical proposals, but not on propositions. A majority cannot decide what\nthe truth is; but it can decide what a body of people will do.\nSo the nature of practical argumentation is controversy, not consensus. It\nis good if antagonists can find a way to what John Rawls (1993) calls an\noverlapping consensus, but they might not, and it is legitimate that they\nremain at odds. In theoretical argumentation continued dissensus means that\nuncertainty still prevails, and debate must continue until consensus is\nreached. In practical argumentation dissensus may persist indefinitely\nbecause values differ, and this is legitimate.\nBut why have argumentation at all if not in order to find consensus or at\nleast move toward it? What other purpose could argumentation between two\nantagonists possibly have? And how could it have such a function, whatever\nit is?\nTo answer these questions one has only to think of a factor that is\ncuriously left out of most current theories of argumentation as well as\ntheories of the public sphere and deliberative democracy: the audience. It is\nprimarily for the sake of the audience that debates between opponents in\npractical argumentation make sense. A public sphere consists not only of\nparticipants, but also, and primarily, of spectators. They are individuals who\nare all, in principle, entitled to choose freely which of two or more\nalternative policies they find preferable. In order to choose they need\ninformation on their alleged advantages and drawbacks, on how real,\nrelevant, and weighty they appear in the light of their respective value\nsystems.\nA crucial factor in this assessment is that both debaters must always\nanswer what their opponent has to say. Any reason either pro or con offered\nby one debater must have a reply from the opponent, who should either\nacknowledge its relevance and weight or give reasons why its relevance\nand/or weight should be downgraded. Listening to this kind of exchange\nwill help each audience member form his own assessment of how relevant\nand weighty the reasons on both sides are. This is how continued dissensus\nand controversy may be constructive without ever approaching consensus.\nIt is an old assumption in rhetorical thinking that rhetorical debate is\nconstructive not only in helping debaters motivate and perhaps propagate\ntheir views, and not only in helping audience members build an informed\n142 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nopinion, but also in building society. Isocrates and Cicero are among the\nchief exponents of this vision. We cannot all agree on everything, but we\ncan build a cohesive society through constructive controversy.\nIt is worth noting, in conclusion, that in political science and philosophy\nthere is a growing body of scholarship and opinion arguing for a conception\nof democracy based on a recognition of dissensus rather than consensus.\nFor example, Rescher (1993) is resolutely pluralist and anti-consensus, in\ntheoretical as well as practical reasoning. There are determined \u201cagonists\u201d\nsuch as Honig (1993) and Mouffe (e.g., 1999, 2000, 2005), as well as\nthinkers who emphasize the centrality of \u201cdifference\u201d in democracy (such\nas Young, e.g., 1997). Gutmann & Thompson take a balanced view,\nemphasizing deliberation as well as pluralism: \u201cA democracy can govern\neffectively and prosper morally if its citizens seek to clarify and narrow\ntheir deliberative disagreements without giving up their core moral\ncommitments. This is the pluralist hope. It is, in our view, both more\ncharitable and more realistic than the pursuit of the comprehensive common\ngood that consensus democrats favor\u201d (2004, p. 29). Dryzek too is\ncautiously balanced in arguing that the ideal of deliberative democracy must\nrecognize dissensus: \u201cDiscursive democracy should be pluralistic in\nembracing the necessity to communicate across difference without erasing\ndifference\u201d (2002, p. 3). All these thinkers acknowledge the need for\ncontinued exchange among citizens of views and reasons, despite the\nimpossibility (or undesirability) of deliberative consensus.\nFew seem to realize that rhetoric has always existed in this democratic\ntension: we cannot force agreement, but we can and should present reasons\nto each other for the free choices we all have to make. As Eugene Garver\nhas said: \u201cThe more we take disagreement to be a permanent part of the\nsituation of practical reasoning, and not something soon to be overcome by\nappropriate theory or universal enlightenment, the more rhetorical facility\nbecomes a central part of practical reason\u201d (2004, p. 175).\nContinuing dissensus is an inherent characteristic of practical\nargumentation. In the rhetorical tradition this insight has always been a\ngiven. In contemporary political philosophy it is by now perhaps the\ndominant view. Argumentation theory should not be so specialized that it\nremains ignorant of these facts.\nREFERENCES\n143 Constructive Controversy\u2014Rhetoric as Dissensus-oriented Discourse\nBenhabib, S. 1994.

Not all claims that people may disagree about concern the truth of\nsome proposition. Some claims, for example, are proposals for doing\nsomething. The distinction between propositions and proposals equals that\nbetween epistemic and practical reasoning, and the article leans on\nAristotle\u2019s thinking about these concepts, as interpreted by Anthony Kenny.\nAlso, the essential kinship of the notions of deliberation, rhetoric and\nconductive reasoning is asserted, as is the inalienable role of subjectivity in\npractical reasoning. The proposed spectrum of types of claim ranges from\nepistemic (factual) claims at one end to practical claims at the other\u2014with,\ne.g., evaluative, interpretive, and stipulative claims in between.\n1. Introduction\nArgumentation theory needs a typology of types of claim (where \u201cclaim\u201d\nmeans that for which an arguer argues). This view is in line with the\nWittgensteinian idea of multiple \u201cSprachspiele\u201d and with the notion of\ndifferent fields with different types of warrant, etc., in Toulmin (who was,\nincidentally, Wittgenstein\u2019s student).\nThe main reason that necessitates such a typology is that much which\ncan be said theoretically about argument for one type of claim is misleading\nwhen said about argument for claims of other types; neglecting the\ndifferences between these types is a pernicious Platonic fallacy, against\nwhich philosophical argumentation scholars should be warned.\nOne important type distinction, as I have argued repeatedly elsewhere, is\nthat between theoretical or epistemic reasoning (i.e., arguing for truth of\npropositions) and practical reasoning (i.e., arguing for the adoption of\nproposals); although some argumentation theorists have recognized this\n* Originally published in Conductive Argument: An Overlooked Type of Defeasible\nReasoning, J.A. Blair, and R.H. Johnson, (Eds.). London: College Publications, 2011, 62-73.\nReprinted with permission of the publisher. Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\ndistinction, they have not, I believe, fully understood the amount and the\ndepth of the differences it implies.\nIn general, there is no lack of recognition that not all the claims we argue\nabout in real-life argument are about philosophical truth. But the\ndistinctions most often applied are, I suggest, either too vague or directly\nmisleading. For example, we often hear a distinction between necessary and\ncontingent propositions, where a contingent proposition is one that is\nneither necessarily true nor necessarily false. But as this definition makes\nclear, all claims are still seen as propositions which are to be assessed with\nregard to their truth or falsity. Another related, insufficient distinction\ndepends on the concept of probability: some claims, it says, are about\nsomething being true, others about something being merely probable. This\ndistinction, for example, is seen by Brockriede and Ehninger as an\nimportant reason to adopt Toulmin's argument theory for the teaching of\npractical argument:\nWhereas in traditional logic arguments are specifically designed to\nproduce universal propositions, Toulmin's second triad of backing,\nrebuttal, and qualifier provide, within the framework of his basic\nstructural model, for the establishment of claims that are no more than\nprobable (1960, p. 46).\nHowever, I would argue that the concept of probability misleads us\nregarding the nature of the claims we argue about in practical reasoning. To\nsay that something is probably the case is an epistemic claim just like the\nclaim that something is definitely the case. To say that the ongoing global\nwarming is probably to a large extent man-made is such a claim. But to say\nthat the EU should reduce its CO emissions by 30 per cent is not a claim or\n2\nproposition about what is \u201cno more than probable\u201d; it is not a proposition at\nall, but a proposal to the EU to make a decision and implement it.\nJust as the concepts of contingency and probability are insufficient to\nidentify the differences between the types of claim that we may argue\nabout, they are also insufficient for another task, namely that of\ndemarcating what rhetoric is about. Although rhetoric has been defined, at\nleast since Aristotle, as argument centered on issues in a certain domain,\nthat domain is not properly defined by means of concepts like the\ncontingent or the probable, nor is that what Aristotle did, as we shall see\nbelow.\nJeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor are rhetoricians who, in a number of\npapers and textbooks over several years, have made a proposal for a\n149 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\ntypology of claims or arguments, based on a reinterpretation of ancient\nstasis theory. One recent version of their proposal (Fahnestock and Secor,\n2003) distinguishes between the following types of argument: What is it?\n(definition arguments); how did it get that way? (causal arguments); is it\ngood or bad? (evaluation arguments); what should we do about it? (proposal\narguments). An earlier version (Fahnestock and Secor, 1988) proposed that\nwhat they call the stasis of an argument could belong to five types,\naccording to whether it concerns an issue of fact, definition, cause, value, or\naction.\nBasically, my proposal in this paper is not new and adds nothing to such\nan approach as far as the notion of different types of claim is concerned.\nRather, my intention is to point to the necessity of making this kind of\ntypological distinction at all, and to show that the differences between types\nare deeper than generally assumed by most contemporary theorists of\nargumentation. As a consequence, we will find that many irreducible\ntheoretical differences emerge, in particular between \u201ctheoretical,\u201d truth-\noriented argument on the one hand and practical, action-oriented argument\non the other.\n2. A spectrum of types\nHowever, I do not wish to set up what might be a misleading dichotomy.\nNor am I eager to commit myself to a fixed number of distinguishable\n\u201ctypes,\u201d whether four or five or another number, as in Fahnestock and\nSecor\u2019s theory and pedagogy. Rather, I suggest that we need to think about\nthe relevant differences in terms of a spectrum. It would have purely\ntheoretical (truth-oriented, \u201calethic\u201d) claims at one end and purely practical\nones at the other. In between, and probably with intermediary areas\nseparating the \u201ctypes,\u201d should, at least, be types like interpretive claims\n(next to theoretical claims) and value claims of different kinds (next to\npractical claims). My basic concern is to heighten an awareness of\ndifferences.\nI believe the point I want to make here is highly apposite because\ncontemporary argumentation theorists, in my view, give far too little\nattention to these differences, assuming too blithely that argumentation is\nabout one homogeneous kind of thing, and that, for instance, all\nargumentation is basically about showing the truth of something. As the\nexample of Fahnestock and Secor shows, scholars with strong practical and\n150 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\npedagogical leanings are far more aware of the usefulness of making these\ndistinctions.\nWhat this has to do with conductive argument is that the closer you\nmove toward the \u201cpractical\u201d end of this spectrum, the more will conductive\nargument be the natural and inevitable order of the day. Some of the\ncorollaries of this are these: at this end of the spectrum, good arguments are\nrarely, if ever, logically valid; the \u201cgoodness\u201d of arguments is gradual,\nmultidimensional, and in certain respects relative to individuals; and\ninference, in the strict, traditional sense of that term, does not exist.\nIt should be added that rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Cicero, and many\nothers, have always, in some form or other, recognized these views (or most\nof them), although not many rhetoricians after Aristotle have theorized\nthem. However, philosophically trained argumentation scholars have, at\nbest, only recognized them very reluctantly, or not at all. So I am also trying\nto add the weight of an \u201cauthority\u201d argument to my case when I base it, in\nparticular, on Aristotle. To spell out one important difference between the\ntwo ends of the spectrum I turn to Aristotle\u2019s theory of the will and related\nsubjects, including his theory of practical reasoning, i.e., reasoning about\nwhat to do, as propounded by the British philosopher Anthony Kenny\n(1979).\n3. The logic of practical reasoning\nOne important insight in Aristotle that Kenny has helped clarify is that in\npractical reasoning we argue as it were backwards; that is, we start with the\nvaluable goal or result that we want to bring about, for example, health;\nthus, if health is a good thing, it follows that what brings health is also\ngood, and since exercise is something which brings health, it follows that\nexercise is good; moreover, if I bicycle to work rather than drive, I get\nexercise, so bicycling to work is good. Bicycling to work is an available\nmeans to this good, i.e., it is in my powers to do. So I may decide to do it.\nBefore I decide to do it I may engage in deliberation (with myself and\npossibly with my family) on whether that is what I will do.\nWhat we see here is that in practical reasoning, and hence in practical\nargumentation (we leave aside for the moment the relation between these\ntwo terms) we begin with the goal or the end, i.e., the value we wish to\npromote. Given that the end is good, we look for a means to bring about\nthat end, because that means will also, in that respect, be good. So we look\n151 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nfor steps in reasoning that will transfer or preserve goodness from the end\nto the means.\nIf we compare this kind of reasoning with reasoning about propositions,\nwe see that there we look for steps in reasoning that will preserve truth. For\nthat purpose we need truth-preserving rules, whereas in practical reasoning\nwhat we need is something that could be called goodness-preserving rules.\nBut these two kinds of rules are quite different. Kenny makes clear that\nwhereas Aristotle himself managed to formulate truth-preserving rules for\npropositions, he did not even try to formulate a parallel set of goodness-\npreserving rules for practical reasoning, nor has anyone else attempted to do\nso, let alone succeeded. The reason is that practical reasoning is much more\ncomplicated, and so are the goodness-preserving rules that would be\nrequired to codify it. Because practical reasoning works as it were\nbackwards from the desired effect or good to an available means, whereas\nreasoning about propositions works forward from the truth of one to\nproposition to the truth of another that follows, we may notice the\nfollowing:\nIf a proposition is true, then it is not also false; but if a project or\nproposal or decision is good, that does not exclude its being also, from\nanother point of view, bad. Hence, while truth-preserving rules will\nexclude falsehood, goodness-preserving rules will not exclude badness.\n(Kenny 1979, p. 146)\nAs an example of this \u201cbackwardness\u201d, we might take the following\npiece of reasoning:\n\u201cMore nuclear power means reduced CO emission\u201d (p => q).\n2\n=>\n\u201cReduced CO emission is good\u201d => More nuclear power is good\u201d (q\n2\ngood => p good).\nNotice the backward, goodness-preserving reasoning from the desired\ngoal to an available means. What should be remembered, however, is that\nmore nuclear power may be good from this point of view\u2014but possibly bad\nfrom other points of view. So it does not simply follow deductively that we\nshould have more nuclear power because we want reduced CO emission,\n2\ni.e., no such \u201cinference\u201d is valid. The notion \u201cpractical inference,\u201d if\nunderstood as a piece of reasoning on which a certain purposive choice\nfollows as a deduction or entailment from the recognition of a certain goal,\nis a phantom; other means to the same goal might be available and indeed\npreferable, and there might be other goals that might be interfered with if\n152 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nwe chose to aim for this particular goal. It is no improvement on the notion\nof \u201cpractical inference\u201d to speculate that practical inference is an entailment\nthat is \u201cpresumptive\u201d; what this amounts to is essentially to say that when a\ngood reason for a given choice has been offered, the inference is accepted,\nbut as soon as a counter consideration is brought forward, it is cancelled\u2014\nand so on ad infinitum (cf. this volume, Chapter 4).\nThis state of affairs is illustrated in Figure 1. The rectangles are available\nmeans or courses of action, while the circles are the goals or ends, that is to\nsay, the goods that we wish to promote. Triangles are means that happen to\nbe unavailable. A straight arrow between a means and a goal indicates that\nthis means will promote this goal, while a dotted arrow indicates that the\nmeans will counteract the goal. The point is that for any goal there is more\nthan one available means; but any means that promotes some goal will at\nthe same time counteract at least one other goal. As for the means\nrepresented by triangles, all their effects are desirable, i.e., they promote\nseveral of our goals and counteract none; sadly, however, these means are\nunavailable.\nFigure 1: Practical\nreasoning illustrated.\nThe rectangles are\navailable means or courses\nof action, while the circles\nare goals (goods that we\nwish to promote). Triangles\nare unavailable means. A\nbold arrow between a\nmeans and a goal indicates\nthat this means will\npromote this goal, while a\ndotted arrow indicates that\nthe means will counteract\nthe goal.\nTo this complicated structure is added the further complication that\nwhen we are engaged in practical reasoning, what we have to do first is\nconsider a goal we want to promote, and then look backwards along the\nstraight arrows at the various means that might promote it. Some of these,\nas we saw, happen to be unavailable, and among the ones that are available\n153 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nwe find that they also have dotted arrows leading towards other goals; that\nis, although they may be good from the point of view of the goal we began\nour reasoning with, they counteract other goals and are thus bad from other\npoints of view.\nThe backward logic by which we reason from ends to means is called by\nKenny, in an early paper (1966), a \u201clogic of satisfactoriness,\" as opposed to\nthe \u201clogic of satisfaction.\u201d The former is concerned with the way a\nsatisfactory end or goal transfers its satisfactoriness backwards to the\nchoices that will promote it, while the latter is concerned with the way a\nproposition\u2019s state of satisfaction, i.e., of being satisfied, is transferred\nforwards to another proposition.\nIf we could reduce practical reasoning to inferences from the truth of\ncertain propositions to the truth of others that follow, things would be\nsimpler; but we are not reasoning about truth. If I want to stay healthy and\ntherefore choose, in light of that premiss, to pursue the habit of bicycling to\nwork, then that decision cannot be called true, nor is it false. It may be true\nthat this kind of exercise may enhance my health, but that is not the same\nthing as saying that the decision to pursue it is a \u201ctrue\u201d decision. Kenny,\ninterpreting Aristotle, says: \u201cif the conclusion of a piece of practical\nreasoning has the imperative form \u2018Pursue this\u2019 or \u2018Avoid that\u2019 it is not\nsomething which can itself be straightforwardly described as true or false.\u201d\n(Kenny 1979, p. 94)\nAnother way of stating the same difference is this: Truth is a one-\ndimensional thing, perhaps even a dichotomous thing; for many\npropositions it is indeed the case that they are either true or false. Goodness,\nby contrast, is a multi-dimensional thing (cf. this volume, Chapters 6 and 5).\nThat is why there is no goodness-preserving rule that excludes badness. My\ndecision to bicycle the twelve miles to work may be good from the point of\nview of my personal fitness; but it may be bad from another point of view:\nit might imply that I cannot find the time or energy to do my work properly,\nor to walk my dog in due time after work, or maybe I risk being run over by\ncars or mugged on the way, or catching pneumonia in the rain, or over-\nexercising and thereby permanently damaging my weak knee. Also, there is\nthe fact that I may find exercise of any kind, including bicycling, so\ndreadfully boring that is significantly reduces my quality of life.\nThus it is clear that we must stop theorizing as if all claims people may\nargue about are claims about something being true. Some claims are claims\nfor a purposive choice, or in Aristotle\u2019s term, for a \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. And a\n154 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is not a proposition expressing a belief or an opinion (a \u03b4\u1f79\u03be\u03b1).\nThe Eudemian Ethics in particular makes that very clear:\n\u2026 it is manifest that purposive choice is not opinion either, nor\nsomething that one simply thinks; for we saw that a thing chosen is\nsomething in one\u2019s own power, but we have opinions as to many things\nthat do not depend on us, for instance that the diagonal of a square is\nincommensurable with the side; and again, choice is not true or false [\u1f14\u03c4\u03b9\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03ae\u03c2]. Nor yet is purposive choice an\nopinion about practicable things within one\u2019s own power that makes us\nthink that we ought to do or not to do something; but this characteristic\nis common to opinion and to wish. (1226a)\nCarl Wellman, the originator of the concept of conductive reasoning,\nseems to take an ambiguous position on the question of whether what we\nargue for in practical reasoning can be true or false. In several of his ethical\nwritings he declares himself an ethical objectivist, in the sense that ethical\njudgments in his view can indeed be true or false; but on the other hand a\nstatement like the following seems to accept that truth or falsity is not what\nwe argue about in practical reasoning:\nToo often reasoning is conceived of as a logical operation upon\npropositions, statements, sentences, or beliefs only. Reasoning must be\nso restricted, it is alleged, because the validity of an argument is tied to\nthe truth-value of the premises and the conclusion. Where there is no\ntruth or falsity, as in the case of exclamations or imperatives, there can\nbe no reasoning. But if this were so, there could be no such thing as\npractical reasoning; reasoning that does not arrive at practice or action in\nthe end is not genuinely practical. (1976, p. 545)\nSo practical reasoning is ultimately about action, not about beliefs that\nmay have truth or falsity. But could we not say that after all purposive\nchoice is a kind of belief, namely to the effect that one should do\nsomething? Aristotle specifically addresses this question and answers it in\nthe negative. His reasons include the following: The object of such a belief\nis a goal, e.g., to be healthy; by contrast, the object of purposive choice is a\nmeans, e.g., exercise. Moreover, one can believe that one should do\nsomething without acting on that belief or even intending to. Other\nobservations in Aristotle that refute the identification of a purposive choice\nwith a belief are these: We choose to do something or avoid it; we believe\nthat something; a choice is judged as good because its object is good, i.e., it\nis a choice of the right object, whereas a good belief is judged as good\n155 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nbecause is the right kind of belief, i.e., a true belief; and finally, belief has\ngradations, whereas purposive choice is dichotomous: you either choose to\ndo a thing or you don\u2019t (Nicomachean Ethics 1112a2-14; Kenny 1979, p.\n72).\n4. Deliberation, rhetoric and conductive reasoning\nIn Aristotle's thinking on practical reasoning, the concept of purposive\nchoice is wedded to that of deliberation. The domain of deliberation is\ndemarcated in exactly the same way as that of purposive choice. A\npurposive choice is one that is preceded by deliberation on the object of that\nchoice. This is where we may notice a link in Aristotle\u2019s thinking that has\nnot been properly pointed out yet, not even by experts like Kenny, namely\nthe link between his ethical thinking and his rhetoric. It is precisely the\nconcept of deliberation that connects them. Deliberation (\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7; verb:\n\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) is the kind of reasoning that concerns our ethically relevant\nchoices; but it is also the kind of reasoning that rhetoric is made of. What\ndistinguishes rhetoric from ethical reasoning is the fact that rhetoric is\nspeech in front of audiences about the things on which we deliberate in\npublic, i.e., the purposive, collective choices of the polity; moreover, the\nfunction of such reasoning is not to achieve consensus between the\ndiscussants but to influence the members of the audience, whose role (as\nAristotle makes clear) is to act as judges.\nLet me add that the expression \u201cinfluence the members of the audience\u201d\nreflects the function of rhetoric from the point of view of the public\nspeaker; from the point of view of the polity as such, the function of\nrhetoric is to supply the available reasons for the decisions being\nconsidered. (There is more on social deliberation as the domain of rhetoric\nin this volume Chapter 2; more on the social function of rhetoric in\nChapters 5 and 9.)\nMoreover, it is clear that as soon as we are looking at claims for\nsomething being the best choice, we are dealing with conductive reasoning.\nThis is precisely because any purposive choice, although it may be good\nfrom some point of view, might still be bad from another point of view. In\nfact these other points of view are always relevant\u2014or shall we say, in the\nstandard case they are. Admittedly, it is also true that Aristotle in his\ndiscussions of practical reasoning and practical inference has pretty\nconsistently limited himself to cases where only one end is taken into\nconsideration and only one available means to bring it about is considered;\n156 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nthus one might get the false impression that in practical reasoning, as in\ndeductive reasoning, the normal case is that we are able to establish a chain\nof reasoning which necessarily leads us to a conclusion, namely a claim\nregarding what one should do. That is to say, we might get the false\nimpression that there is something we might call practical inference which\nis structurally very similar to deductive inference, and we might be tempted\nto introduce the term \u201cpractical syllogism,\u201d although there is no such\nexpression in Aristotle, and although the examples of practical reasoning\nwe find in him are hardly ever syllogisms in form, but are much more\ncomplex.\nTwo further claims that I made at the outset should also be explained,\nnamely these: \u201cgoodness\u201d of arguments is gradual, and it is, in certain\nrespects, relative to individuals. Both of these claims are based on the\nmultiplex structure of practical reasoning. Nuclear power plants may help\nus reduce CO emission, and that is a good reason for building them\u2014but\n2\nhow good? That of course depends on what can be said against building\nthem, i.e., it depends on what other goals might be adversely affected, and\nwhat alternative means might also be available to promote the same goal.\nFor example, the risk connected with radioactive waste from nuclear power\nplants is a well-known reason that speaks against them, and so is the cost of\nbuilding them, running them, demolishing them, etc.\nWhat we have here is clearly a case of conductive reasoning, insofar as\nthere are, in Govier\u2019s terms, \u201cseparately relevant non-sufficient factors\u201d as\nwell as \u201ccounter considerations\u201d (Govier, p. 69). But once we recognize the\npresence of separately relevant factors and counter considerations, we must\nnecessarily ask how strong these factors and considerations are, i.e., \u201chow\nmuch support they give to the conclusion\u201d (Govier 1987, p. 70)\u2014in other\nwords, we must recognize that their strength is a matter of degrees. And\nalong with that insight also goes the insight that the strength of the reasons\nand counter considerations is, at least in some respect, relative to\nindividuals. How could it be otherwise? If we recognize that the weight of\nreasons and counter considerations is assessed by individuals along\ncontinuous scales, how likely would it be that all individuals would assign\nexactly the same weight along these scales to all these reasons and counter\nconsiderations?\nIn the example of the nuclear plants this problem of indeterminate\ndegrees is obvious: just how strong is the counter consideration about\nradioactive waste disposal? Experts can give us figures about radioactive\ndecay and the likelihood of accidents now and in the future\u2014but how much\n157 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nweight these considerations will have in our deliberations on whether we to\nchoose to build more nuclear power plants is still, and unavoidably will be,\nrelative to individuals. Some will decide that the counter considerations\noutweigh the pro considerations, others that they do not. There is no\nobjective answer to the question\u2014which amounts to saying that the answer\nis relative to the individuals who have to decide.\nThis is so not only because of the fact that individuals must be assumed\nto assign weight to any given factor along a continuous scale, but also\nbecause of the fact that there is no inter-subjectively recognized\ncommensurability between the scales that will be involved. For example,\njust how much weight will risks affecting future generations have in\nrelation to risks affecting the present generation? What part should be\nplayed here by ethical considerations? And how much weight will risks as\nsuch have when held against the putative benefits in regard to the\nprevention of climate change, especially when these benefits are also\nputative and of uncertain magnitude\u2014just as are the predicted climate\nchanges? Moreover, what about the financial costs of making certain\nchoices now, held against the putative future costs of not making them?\nAnd what about risks and costs held against benefits?\nMy point is not that we should not try to hold all these considerations\ntogether and against each other, because we have to, and that is what\ndeliberation is all about; but the point is that there is not and cannot be any\nauthoritative and inter-subjectively demonstrable way or doing so.\n5. The vexed subjectivity issue\nThe issue I have just addressed is one that, in my view, constitutes a sore\npoint in philosophy and philosophically based argumentation theory. It is an\nissue that you had better not touch, or you risk an outcry of pain and rage.\nPhilosophers, at least those coming from logic and epistemology, seem so\nwary of being associated with any sort of \u201csubjectivism\u201d or \u201crelativism\u201d\nthat they, as I see it, will blithely deny the testimony of an overwhelming\nbulk of everyday experience. Even those few philosophers, such as\nWellman, Govier, and other informal logicians who have been bold enough\nto reject deductive validity as the one criterion of good argument, and who\nhave given us a three-dimensional method of assessing arguments (e.g.,\nGovier\u2019s \u201cARG\u201d: Acceptability, Relevance, and Good Grounds/weight)\u2014\neven these thinkers have been extremely wary, or blankly unwilling, to\nconcede the property that seems to me to follow with necessity from the\n158 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nadmission of relevance and weight as aspects of a good argument: namely\nthe fact that both of these aspects, and in particular weight, are subject to\nlegitimate individual judgment.\nWellman\u2019s position on this issue is representative. He insists that the\n\u201cvalidity\u201d of arguments in conductive reasoning is not governed by rules or\ncriteria\u2014where, we should remember, the \u201cvalidity\u201d of an argument does\nnot mean deductive validity, but simply that it offers \u201cgood reasons for its\nconclusion\u201d (Wellman 1971, p. 21). Yet both in Challenge and Response\nand elsewhere he professes ethical objectivism and says, e.g., \u201cthat there\ncan be one and only one correct answer to any ethical question and that\nwhich answer is correct is independent of anyone\u2019s acceptance or rejection\u201d\n(Wellman 1968, p. 98). Although he insists that no objective weighing can\ntake place, as in an actual pair of scales, his basic position is that \u201cwe\u201d will\nweigh the arguments in conductive reasoning as if we were one person; the\nway to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer is to continue our discussion, because such\n\u201cdisagreement can be overcome by further reasoning\u201d (Wellman 1975, p.\n220). His view of validity \u201cprojects an ideal of universal agreement\u201d\n(Wellman 1971, p. 96) \u2014with one restriction \u201cbuilt into the claim\u201d: \u201ca valid\nargument will, through the process of criticism, remain or become\npersuasive for everyone who thinks in the normal way\u201d (ibid.).\nWe may remark, in passing, that this \u201crestricted\u201d view of validity would\nseem to place Wellman in the company of Perelman and his \u201cuniversal\naudience.\u201d But in any case, I suggest that even if we accept the claim that\nvalid arguments in ethics (and other instances of conductive argument) will\nbe persuasive for anyone who thinks \u201cin the normal way,\u201d this does not\nprove the stronger claim that \u201cthere can be one and only one correct answer\nto any ethical question\u201d (or similar claims in different phrasings). For what\nis a \u201cvalid\u201d argument to Wellman? It is simply a good one; but it is not one\nthat entails its conclusion. And even if we all (or at least all those of us who\nare \u201cnormal\u201d) were to agree that an argument is \u201cgood,\u201d this may not lead\nto the same conclusion for us all, for it does not entail its conclusion.\nThere is, for one thing, the matter of just how good the argument is, i.e.,\nthe matter of its weight, and even more importantly, of its relative weight\nwhen held against the counter considerations. Of these \u201cweights\u201d Wellman,\nGovier, and others have clearly said (and I could not agree more) that they\ncannot be \u201ccalculated,\u201d \u201cmeasured\u201d or the like. In fact, Wellman himself,\nalmost inadvertently as it appears, concedes that the \u201cweighing\u201d may not\nlead to the same result for everyone; the whole \u201ccalculation\u201d idea \u201csuggests\ntoo mechanical a process as well as the possibility of everyone reading off\n159 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nthe result in the same way\u201d; so assuming that everyone would do that is\napparently erroneous, and furthermore we should avoid \u201csuggesting any\nautomatic procedure that would dispense with individual judgment\u201d\n(Wellman 1971, p. 58).\nThis is possibly the only reference to individual judgment in the book,\nbut it represents, I would say, an inevitable insight that many philosophers\nhave sought to repress because they feel about it the same way one feels\nabout a sore tooth. In ethical assessment, there is individual judgment\ninvolved, certainly in the sense that the relative weight of a consideration\nwhen \u201cweighed\u201d against other considerations, pro and con, is subject to\nindividual judgment. As I said, even if we do admit that we may have\nuniversal agreement among all normal people that an argument is \u201cvalid\u201d\n(i.e., good)\u2014and we may admit that for the sake of the argument\u2014we\nwould still, to reach the one \u201ccorrect\u201d answer together, also have to agree\non the relative weight on this consideration when \u201chefted\u201d against all the\nothers (to use the term Wellman suggests). And why and how would we\nassume that this quasi-universal agreement on the relative weight of all\nrelevant considerations would come about? To claim that it would is an\nempirical hypothesis that, as I see it, is challenged by a massive amount of\ndaily experience. Do disagreements of this nature generally get resolved by\nprolonged discussion between people holding different ethical and political\nviews? Have recurring disagreements of this kind generally been settled by\ncenturies of discussion among philosophers? These, obviously, are\n\u201crhetorical\u201d questions: they answer themselves.\nMost of those who happen to read this paper are probably academics\nwho routinely serve as examiners in their institutions. In my own country,\nmany exams are graded by two examiners\u2014one \u201cinternal\u201d (the instructor\nwho has taught the course) and one \u201cexternal\u201d (an experienced expert in the\nfield, coming from outside the institution). Often in grading a paper or an\noral presentation these two will disagree on the \u201cconclusion,\u201d i.e., the grade\nto be given. Both may agree on all the noteworthy properties of the\nstudent\u2019s effort, the good ones as well as the not so good ones; so there will\nbe agreement on which considerations are acceptable and relevant to the\nassessment. Yet we may still disagree on the relative weight of these\nconsiderations, and often do; for example, the fact that the student does not\nspell very well will undoubtedly count as a \u201cnegative\u201d factor for both of us,\nbut in the eyes of the external examiner this shortcoming is perhaps weighty\nenough to cause the grade to be a C, all things considered, whereas to me it\n160 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nis not quite as weighty as that, given the \u201cpositive\u201d considerations, to which\nI assign more relative weight.\nIn such cases we naturally discuss things for a while, but let us say that\nthis does not bring agreement. We also look at rules and regulations, but\nalthough there is a clause about \u201cformal\u201d factors such as spelling having\nsome weight in assessment, there is no rule to help us decide whether this\ndegree of bad spilling is enough to land this effort in the C category, or\nwhether it should still be a B. Yet rules dictate that we should find\nagreement.\nWhat I believe this example shows, along with countless others in\neveryday disagreements in the domains of ethics, politics, education, etc., is\nthat there is no \u201cone and only one correct answer\u201d as to the merit of the\nstudent\u2019s paper. The external examiner and I both disapprove of bad\nspelling; it just happens that, in this particular case, he disapproves more\nstrongly than I do. To generalize, the circumstance that different individuals\nmay legitimately differ as to how much relative weight they assign to\nrelevant considerations when making practical decisions such as this one, is\nan undeniable and ineradicable fact of life, and moreover, I suggest, one\nthat no one could really wish would go away.\n6. The problem of many dimensions\nMoreover, while this example highlights a problem that could hardly be\nseen as ethical, the argument I have made could be made in an analogous\nmanner for issues with clear ethical considerations involved. Let us imagine\na student who does rather badly at an exam. The external examiner wants to\nfail her; I lean towards letting her scrape through. I now point out that she is\neight and half months pregnant and poor as well; in fact, she comes from a\ndisrupted family with a history of drug abuse, crime, sexual abuse, etc. The\nexternal examiner seems unmoved. I now change tactics and point out that\nthe department depends for its survival on the number of graduates we turn\nout, and every \u201cpass\u201d grade counts. Silence. I further inform my co-\nexaminer that the young woman, if she passes this exam, will have finished\nher final degree, and incidentally that her whole family, or what is left of it,\nis eagerly waiting at home to start the celebrations, but also she already has\na been offered a rather nice job, provided she gets her degree; however, if\nshe fails to get it, and thus the job, her residence permit will expire, and she\nwill be expelled from the country, to which she came as a fugitive from\nAfghanistan, and where she worked her way up through the educational\n161 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nsystem, studying at day and washing floors at night. Back in Afghanistan,\nby the way, there\u2019s a good chance that she will be caught by fundamentalist\nthugs and killed.\nWhat would you say if you were the external examiner in this case?\nWould you say that all these considerations are absolutely irrelevant and\nshould not have been cited, and we should simply assess the young\nwoman\u2019s performance at its merit and fail her? Or would you say that one\nor two of these considerations, especially the last one, might after all fact be\nrelevant to what you decide, and if relevant, it is also weighty enough for\nyou to let her pass? (In any case, you would probably say that the internal\nexaminer\u2014that is, me\u2014 \u201cdoth protest too much.\u201d) Or would you say that\nthe first considerations I mentioned are perhaps relevant, but surely not\nweighty enough to let her pass, but the last ones are?\nWhat I believe the example shows is a number of things: 1) It is also true\nof ethical considerations that they may legitimately be assigned different\nrelative weights by different individuals. 2) Moreover, it is quite possible\nthat also the relevance of given considerations in ethical and other practical\nissues may legitimately be differently assessed by different individuals. 3)\nIn relation to a given decision, such as grading an exam, there may be\nconsiderations belonging to different dimensions of judgment\u2014\nconsiderations which are not compatible because they are\nincommensurable. In academic exams, grading is supposed to be\ndetermined only by professional (i.e., scholarly) considerations; but who\ncan deny that, at least in extreme cases, other considerations, such as ethical\nand humanitarian ones, to say nothing of economic ones, may legitimately\nbe cited.\nEven if, in deliberating on a given choice, we did not have multiple and\nincommensurable factors to deal with, and even if we could have some kind\nof objective quantification of just how much good that choice would do in\nrelation to a given goal or value, and even if that choice could objectively\nbe said to do a lot of good, it would still be categorially wrong to call it a\n\u201ctrue\u201d choice. Truth value is one thing, but the kind of value that a good\nchoice brings is another.\n7. The spectrum of claims\nI have now tried to show that argumentation scholars should distinguish\nbetween claims about beliefs and claims about choices. But instead of\nadvocating a dichotomy I wish to suggest that our typology of claim types\n162 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nshould probably be more like a spectrum. It would have purely theoretical\n(truth-functional or alethic) claims at one end and purely practical ones\n(choices) at the other. In between, and probably with intermediary areas\nseparating the \u201ctypes\u201d, should, at least, be types like interpretive claims and\nvalue claims of different kinds.\nA hasty version of such a spectrum or continuum might look like the\nchart on page 165.\nSome of the points I wish to make are these:\nThere are intermediary gradations between pure factual (alethic) claims\nand pure claims of choice. Norms and values are in a third position in\nbetween; they are not facts about the world as such, nor are they pure\narbitrary choices. Aristotle sees them as intuitions underlying claims of\nchoice.\nCarl Wellman, it might be added, is another philosopher who thinks that\npractical claims are distinct from epistemic ones, and also that there are\nadditional subtypes and intermediary types of claim or argument that ought\nto be distinguished. Some claims or arguments are more practical than\nothers: \u201cThe most practical arguments, I suppose, are those that conclude\nwith judgments of what ought to be done or ought not to be done; only one\nstep more remote from practice are those which conclude with value\njudgments setting up goals worthy of pursuit or evils to be avoided\u201d\n(Wellman 1976, p. 531). So Wellman too sees value judgments in some\nintermediary position between epistemic claims and \u201creal\u201d practical\narguments.\nSpecific evaluations are more like choices than abstract values are; using\nabstract values as warrants, we make specific evaluations of acts or objects\nin our world.\nInterpretive claims as a category seem to me to resemble choices even\nmore. We choose a paradigm or a theory in scholarship not simply because\nwe think it is truer but because it addresses other issues, generates more\nvaluable insight, more interesting discussions, more perspectives\u2014in short,\nwe think it yields more value along several dimensions. (For example, I\nthink it generates more value to look at practical argumentation as\nconductive rather than as presumptive, deductive, abductive, or what other\nalternatives there might be.)\nStipulative claims are almost like interpretive claims; they are purposive\nchoices, and as such they cannot have truth value, but we make them\n163 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\nbecause we think they bring other kinds of value, such as being more\npractical.\nFinally, the purely practical claims about purposive choices are similarly\nmade by people who think that on balance the values, purposes or goals\nthey subscribe to are more strongly promoted by a certain choice than by\nothers (for example, by not making the choice they consider)\u2014but as we\nsaw, because of the complexities of practical choices, including their\nirreducible relativity to individuals, it is categorially misleading to describe\nthem as either true or false.\nIn conclusion, my aim has been to demonstrate that argumentation\ntheory should abandon all attempts to look at all claims as if they were of\none and the same type, namely propositions which may be true or false.\nInstead of seeing truth value as the only kind of value that is relevant for\nargumentation theory, we should recognize that there are many values\u2014in\nfact, an open set of them\u2014that are relevant in argumentation, and that it\nought also to be so in argumentation theory.\nThe difference I have highlighted between propositions and proposals\nfor purposive choice is basically a reflection of distinctions recognized not\nonly in Aristotle but in modern philosophy as well, notably in the\ndistinction in speech act philosophy between assertives on the one hand and\ndirectives, commissives, etc., on the other (Searle 1975, 1983), or he\ndistinction set up by Austin (1953), Anscombe (1957), and others between\nutterances with a word-to-world \u201cdirection of fit\u201d and those with a world-\nto-word direction of fit (such as directives and commissives).\nUnderstanding the importance of this difference will make the need for a\ndeveloped theory of conductive argument more obvious, for argumentation\nfor purposive choice is necessarily conductive. If argumentation theory\ninsists on neglecting these insights, it makes a bad choice.\n164 Why Argumentation Theory Should Differentiate Between Types of Claim\ngoE oE C\niv nf ax f lax la\ne r e a m c a m im\ns o p le im sp le ty\nn s s s p e\nb rb n w T a \u201dth \u201c o T c sth ( F\nu t w a te y a n y th in g o t b e c a u s e d e s e e c o u ld h e c h a n n e ls r e r e v o ltin g ! e p e a s a n ts L o o k , S ir e , n M a r s ; ish we r ae te la im e o r e tic a l) a le th ic , a c tu a l\nr\nkE omT ssC\ne e p itv e r n eu ltic h is u c h so c ia la im\ns y n a l\ns o u a s f s\na y in g n e ltu r a l tio n is n o r m a c ts , a b o u t\na\npfaM gC aM vC\ne a c e f u l w o r ldo r a m o r e lis m m a k e s -u ltic u ltu r r e a te s t g o o dh a r ity is th e lis m is g o o d ;u -ltic u ltu r a lu e sla im s a b o u t\nm - b li on wd in gu n iv e r s e is th e e x p a n d in g d is c o v e r y o f H u b b le \u2019 s r \u201de v o ltin g !p e a s a n ts a r e \u201c Y u c k !

Several thinkers in these fields help understand the occurrence\nof what we may call legitimate dissensus: enduring disagreement even\nbetween reasonable people arguing reasonably. It inevitably occurs over\npractical issues, e.g., issues of action rather than truth, because there will\nnormally be legitimate arguments on both sides, and these will be\nincommensurable, i.e., they cannot be objectively weighed against each\nother. Accordingly, \u201cinference,\u201d \u201cvalidity,\u201d and \u201csufficiency\u201d are\ninapplicable notions. Further distinctive features of pro and con arguments\nin practical argumentation are explored, and some corollaries are drawn\nregarding evaluative norms of legitimate dissensus. Examples from\nimmigration-related public debates in Denmark are given.\nThis paper makes a call for argumentation theory to open up towards\ndisciplines such as moral and political philosophy. As argumentation\nscholars, we have much to learn from them and their emphasis on human\naction, as an individual as well as a social phenomenon. They, on the other\nhand, have something to learn from scholars who scrutinize words, texts,\nand utterances to see how people use them to act.\nI suggest that, on the whole, contemporary argumentation theory has\nbeen too narrowly allied to one or two branches of philosophy\u2014logic and\nepistemology\u2014to the neglect of those other traditions which see humans as\nmoral and political agents. This narrow perspective has allowed theorists in\nour field to work on the tacit assumption that argumentation is largely about\nhow the truth of certain statements (called conclusions) may be inferred\nfrom the truth of other statements; and how people proceed, or should\nproceed, when arguing over such matters.\nIf argumentation theory would open up more towards moral and political\nphilosophy, it would attain a widened perspective\u2014one where not all\n* Originally published in Informal Logic 27 (2007), 179-96. Reprinted with permission of\nthe Editors. Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nargumentation is about whether statements are true, because some\nargumentation is about what to do.\nThese two categories of argumentation ought really, I suggest, to be seen\nas two separate domains. Aristotle saw them that way and named the two\ndomains episteme and praxis. Also, as we shall see, he believed that\nargumentation in one of these domains is in many respects very different\nfrom argumentation in the other. To Plato, on the other hand, truth was the\nissue in any serious discussion, and he would have considered the\nAristotelian distinction false. Unfortunately, modern argumentation theory\nhas largely walked tacitly in Plato\u2019s footsteps in this respect, not in\nAristotle\u2019s.\nOne of the perspectives that get left by the wayside when argumentation\ntheory takes this line is what I tentatively label legitimate dissensus.\nBut isn\u2019t this a near-tautology? After all, any discussion begins with\ndissensus; argumentation itself is based on it. So of course dissensus is\nlegitimate. In the argumentation business it is our daily bread.\nI am not talking about that kind of dissensus, though. The kind of\ndissensus I mean is the kind that will not go away, even after prolonged\ndiscussion. This kind of dissensus I call legitimate because it may not only\nexist but also endure. Even while using our best tools for the sake of\ncommon understanding, we do not reach consensus. At the end of our\nmutual engagement, we may still not have resolved our dispute, that is, we\ndo not even agree as to who has won the argument; each of us may have\nplayed by the rules, yet there is no objective state of affairs as to the\noutcome of the game. Very likely we have also disagreed along the way as\nto the validity, or legitimacy, of some of the individual moves made by the\ndiscussants.\nBy contrast, in a game like for example chess there can be no such\ndissensus. Either both agree who has won, or both agree that the game is\ndrawn. To have dissensus over the result of a chess game is just not chess.\nBoard games are based on unanimity as to the legitimacy of the moves and\nthe outcome of the game. A player who disputes the legitimacy of my\nmoves or claims he has won when he is in fact checkmate is not being\nreasonable, and no one should play chess with such a person. For chess\nplayers to dissent on such matters is not legitimate.\nSince Plato, it has been a prevalent idea among philosophers that when\nwe discuss any matter, the discussion works the same way as in chess, or at\nleast it should if we are reasonable. We may have a dispute at the beginning\n170 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nof the discussion and we may both wish to prevail in it, but the idea is that\nwe discuss by a set of rules that are agreed between us; that way we will\nalways be in agreement as to the legitimacy of any move made by any of us,\nand we move from dissensus toward consensus in the sense that either I\nprevail, or you prevail, or we both agree to assume a third position; but\nwhichever result ensues none of us disputes it. In that sense we move hand\nin hand from dispute to its resolution.\nPlato himself dramatized this method in many of his dialogues, most\ntellingly in the Meno, where Socrates questions a slave on how to construct\na square twice as big as another square. Through their question-answer\ndialogue they come to the common understanding that the right way to do\nthat is not to draw a square with sides twice the length of the original, but to\nuse the diagonal of the original square as the side of the new one. And no\none has questioned that insight since. In the Gorgias, Socrates describes the\nmethod explicitly by explaining that the two discussants are each other\u2019s\nonly witnesses: \u201cif on my part I fail to produce yourself as my one witness\nto confirm what I say, I consider I have achieved nothing of any account\ntowards the matter of our discussion, whatever it may be; nor have you\neither, I conceive, unless I act alone as your one witness, and you have\nnothing to do with all these others\u201d (472b). \u201cSee therefore,\u201d he goes on, \u201cif\nyou will consent to be put to the proof in your turn by answering my\nquestions\u201d (474a).\nThe basic assumption here, and the basic warranty for the epistemic\nvalue of the method, is the same as the basic assumption in chess: both\nplayers agree on the rules, both agree on the legitimacy of each move, and\nboth in consensus vouch for the outcome.\nA similar view underlies the modern notion of \u201clogical dialogue games.\u201d\nIt has played an important role in the work of Douglas Walton (1984 and\nmany other publications), and it underlies the idea of the \u201ccritical\ndiscussion\u201d in Pragma-dialectics (most recently codified in van Eemeren\nand Grootendorst 2004). In all of these conceptions\u2014chess and other board\ngames, the Platonic dialectic, logical dialogue games, and Pragma-\ndialectics\u2014we find the same belief in commonly agreed rules securing\nunanimity as to the legitimacy of every move, resulting in a movement\ntowards resolution of the original dispute, that is, consensus.\nOutside of argumentation theory proper, there is yet another school of\nthought which has central notions in common with all these. The political\nphilosophy of J\u00fcrgen Habermas and many who are inspired by him is\ncentered around the ideal of a public discourse where participants obey\n171 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\n\u201cden zwanglosen Zwang des besseren Arguments\u201d (\u201cthe unforced force of\nthe better argument\u201d) (1972, 161), reaching (or approximating) consensus\nalong this road.\nHowever, Habermas, unlike Plato and unlike the pragma-dialecticians,\nexplicitly recognizes important differences between the two domains of\nargument that we began with, those of episteme and praxis, respectively.\nArguing about actions is not like arguing about the truth of propositions, in\nthat the warrants we appeal to will not be other propositions we hold to be\ntrue, but norms of action that we hold to be \u201cright.\u201d This rightness is a\ndifferent kind of validity claim (G\u00fcltigkeitsbedingung) from the truth that\nvalidates constative (i.e., epistemic) speech acts; and both are again\ndifferent from the sincerity that validates expressive self-representations or\nfrom the adequacy of value standards that validates evaluative expressions.\nArgumentation theorists might pay more attention to the distinctions that\nHabermas lays down here. Nevertheless, as far as the main thrust of\nHabermas\u2019s argumentation theory is concerned, he joins the other thinkers\nwho conceptualize argumentation as analogous to chess. Even though a\nproposal for action does make a distinctive kind of validity claim which is\nnot truth, it is still just one form of a communicative practice which \u201cis\noriented to achieving, sustaining, and renewing consensus\u2014and indeed a\nconsensus that rests on the intersubjective recognition of criticizable\nvalidity claims\u201d (1997, 17).\nCentral to all these conceptions is the idea that discussants in a dispute\nare as it were collaborators in a quest for consensus; they start from\ndissensus, but using regulated and reasonable discussion as their tool they\ncollaborate towards a common understanding, which may either be identical\nwith what one of them began with, or an understanding new to both.\nIn opposition to all of these, my claim is precisely that because of the\ndifference Habermas has seen (while the others, from Plato onwards, have\neither denied or underestimated it), namely the difference between\nepistemic and practical reasoning, we should understand that whereas\nconsensus may be a meaningful theoretical ideal in the epistemic domain, it\nis not so in that of praxis. In the domain of praxis, enduring dissensus is\ninevitable and legitimate in a way that it is not in the epistemic domain, and\nit is high time that argumentation theory comes to a full and unabashed\nunderstanding of this.\nOn this point some of the leading figures in the moral and political\nphilosophy of our time have something to teach us argumentation theorists.\n172 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nOn the other hand, we may have something to tell them about how people\nactually argue about such matters, and how it is still meaningful for them to\nso argue, even though it is legitimate for them to dissent. But we cannot\nteach them much about actual argumentation until we, on our part, have\nfully accepted their insight, namely that on practical issues people may find\nthemselves in legitimate and enduring dissensus.\nJust why is that?\nPerhaps the simplest way to answer that question is to say that practical\nissues are essentially about choice, not truth, and the notion of choice\nimplies the legitimacy of enduring dissensus. Aristotle said it succinctly in\nthe Eudemian Ethics: \u201cchoice is not true or false\u201d (1226a).\nAnother kind of answer to the question has been attempted by John\nRawls (perhaps, with Habermas, the most influential social and political\nphilosopher of our time). His statement of the question is interesting in\nitself: \u201cWhy does our sincere and conscientious attempt to reason with one\nanother fail to lead us to agreement? It seems to lead to agreement in\nscience, or if disagreement in social theory and economics often seems\nintractable, at least\u2014in the long run\u2014in natural science\u201d (1989, 236).\nNotice that Rawls accepts the distinction between the epistemic and\npractical domains: in natural science consensus is, at least in the long run,\nan ideal and an actual achievement; in social theory and economics, given\ntheir inevitable overlap with practical politics, it is less so, and in practical\npolitics proper: not at all. Rawls disregards answers to the effect that people\nare driven by narrow interests or that they are irrational or stupid; we want\nto know why reasonable people disagree. Assuming that they \u201cshare a\ncommon human reason, similar powers of thought and judgment, a capacity\nto draw inferences and to weigh evidence and to balance competing\nconsiderations,\u201d then what could the sources of disagreement be? Whatever\nthey are, Rawls calls them \u201cthe burdens of reason,\u201d or \u201cthe burdens of\njudgment\u201d in the version appearing four years later in Political Liberalism\n(1993). His tentative list of them includes the following points (emphases\nare mine):\n(a) The evidence\u2014empirical and scientific\u2014bearing on the case may\nbe conflicting and complex, and hence hard to assess and evaluate.\n(b) Even where we agree fully about the kinds of considerations that\nare relevant, we may disagree about their weight, and so arrive at\ndifferent judgments.\n173 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\n(c) To some extent all of our concepts, not only our moral and\npolitical concepts, are vague and subject to hard cases; this\nindeterminacy means that we must rely on judgment and interpretation\n(and on judgments about interpretations) within some range (not itself\nsharply specifiable) wherein reasonable persons may differ.\n(d) \u2026 our total experience, our whole course of life up to now,\nshapes the way we assess evidence and weigh moral and political\nvalues, and our total experiences surely differ \u2026 in a modern society \u2026\nthe total experiences of citizens are disparate enough for their judgments\nto diverge.\n(e) Often there are different kinds of normative considerations of\ndifferent force on both sides of a question and it is difficult to make an\noverall assessment.\n(f) \u2026 In being forced to select among cherished values, we face great\ndifficulties in setting priorities, and other hard decisions that may seem\nto have no clear answer.\nWith all due respect for Rawls I believe we may further reduce and\narrange this list as follows.\n1) First on the list of sources of reasonable disagreement is still the\ncomplexity of evidence (a). This difficulty is found in epistemic as well as\npractical discussions.\n2) Second on the list I put the vagueness or disputability of the concepts\nwe use to subsume the cases we discuss (c).\n3) The third source of reasonable disagreement is the disputability of the\nweight we assign to relevant considerations. This is Rawls\u2019s item (b).\nLooking at our revised list so far, anyone familiar with the history of\nrhetoric will perhaps recognize a reformulation of the ancient system of\nstasis or status (lucidly explained in Heath 1995). (1) corresponds to the\nconjectural status of fact. (2) is the definitional status: under what concept\nare we to subsume the fact? (3) is the qualitative status where we discuss\nthe circumstances of the fact because they may influence the weight or\ngravity we assign to the fact.\nFurthermore, it may be argued not only that the first three of Rawls\u2019s\nburdens of reason match the three main status in ancient argumentation\ntheory, but also that both these sets match the three types of evaluation\ncriteria set up by many modern theorists, such as Govier\u2019s \u201cARG\u201d\nconditions as defined in her well-known textbook (2005, 63ff.): the\nacceptability condition, the relevance condition, and the good grounds\n174 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\ncondition. An argument is acceptable if we take it as referring to a fact; it is\nrelevant if the concept it invokes is indeed instantiated by the matter at\nissue; and the judgment that is represents good grounds is an assessment of\nits weight or gravity.\nAs for Rawls\u2019s point (d), it actually provides part of the empirical\nexplanation of (b) and (c) and is thus not a separate point in itself. Now for\n(e) and (f). Rawls remarks that the first four are not peculiar to reasoning\nabout values (1989, 236), or as he says in the later version, they are \u201cnot\npeculiar to the reasonable and the rational in their moral and practical use\u201d\n(1993, 56); but the last two are. This is a crucial observation.\nI suggest that (f) logically comes first. It means that our values may\nconflict. It is not just that two different individuals or groups in a society\nmay believe in conflicting values; it is also that the set of values held by a\ngiven individual (as well as that subset of these values which are shared by\npractically everyone in the culture) are not fully in harmony with each\nother. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has talked about the \u201cpluralism\u201d of\nvalues, meaning that \u201cnot all good things are compatible, still less all the\nideals of mankind.\u201d For example, he points out \u201cthat neither political\nequality nor efficient organization nor social justice is compatible with\nmore than a modicum of individual liberty, and certainly not with\nunrestricted laissez-faire; that justice and generosity, public and private\nloyalties, the demands of genius and the claims of society can conflict\nviolently with each other\u201d (1958, repr. 1998, 238).\nOf course this is something that ordinary human beings have always\nknown in an intuitive way. Practical philosophers, such as Cicero, who was\na rhetorician as well, have also known it. He writes:\nbetween those very actions which are morally right, a conflict and\ncomparison may frequently arise, as to which of two actions is morally\nbetter \u2026 For, since all moral rectitude springs from four sources (one of\nwhich is prudence; the second, social instinct; the third, courage; the\nfourth, temperance), it is often necessary in deciding a question of duty\nthat these virtues be weighed against one another. (De officiis 1.63.152)\nThe everyday reality of moral conflict between the values in which an\nindividual or a social group believes has in our time been asserted by a wide\nrange of moral philosophers. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (1988) has argued\nin depth that moral conflict is indeed possible. Rawls himself cites Thomas\nNagel (1979) for the view that \u201cthere are basic conflicts of value in which\nthere seem to be decisive and sufficient (normative) reasons for two or more\n175 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nincompatible courses of action; and yet some decision must be made\u201d (237,\nfootnote 7).\nTo understand why this may be so, I believe we should look at item (e),\nwhere Rawls talks about \u201cdifferent kinds of normative considerations \u2026 on\nboth sides of a question\u201d (237). The fact that considerations may be of\ndifferent kinds is the reason why we often cannot just calculate which side\nhas the stronger case. Cicero cites four different sources of moral rectitude;\nothers might be added. Because they are qualitatively different, there is no\nintersubjective, algorithmic way of measuring them on the same scale. They\nare incommensurable. And we are not just talking about the sort of\nincommensurability first identified by the ancient mathematicians who\nfound that, e.g., the side of a square and its diagonal are incommensurable.\nAfter all, they still belong to the same dimension: length; hence they are\nobjectively comparable, and it is easy to demonstrate that the diagonal is\nlonger than the side (cf. Stocker 1990, p. 176). But considerations involved\nin moral and other practical decisions often do not have \u201clengths\u201d that can\nbe objectively compared, nor do they have objective \u201cweights,\u201d although\nwe often use that term about them. Neither are we talking about situations\nlike a business investment that has involved a certain cost and brought a\ncertain return. Cost and return belong to the same dimension (money);\ndeduct one from the other, and you have the net result: profit.\nNot so when we consider the pros and cons of a practical decision. As\nTrudy Govier has emphasized, \u201cthere is no formula or rule that we can\napply to determine whether reasons for the conclusion outweigh reasons\nagainst it\u201d (2005, 399), and in a footnote commenting on the term\n\u201coutweigh\u201d she says: \u201cNo implication that we can mathematically measure\nor judge the relevance and comparative strength of various reasons or\ncounterconsiderations is intended at this point\u201d (p. 415). When for example\nwe discuss whether it was right to let a certain number of lives be sacrificed\nin an attempt to bring democracy to a foreign country, then the cost on one\ndimension is not as it were restored on the other dimension; instead a\nqualitatively different benefit is appealed to (cf. Stocker 1990, pp. 272-277).\nWe may refer to this circumstance as the irreducible multidimensionality of\ndeliberative argumentation (Kock 2003). Because of this\nmultidimensionality, profound incommensurability obtains; and that again\nis why a value conflict in an individual or a group committed to a plurality\nof values, as we all are, may have no intersubjective solution. The values\ninvolved are not, as the philosophers Charles Larmore has said, \u201crankable\nwith respect to a common denominator of value\u201d (Larmore 1996, 159). As a\n176 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nresult, we cannot do what another moral and legal philosopher, John Finnis,\ndescribes in the following way: \u201cAggregate the pluses, subtract the minuses,\nand pursue the option with the highest balance\u201d (1998, 216). That is, in\ndeliberative argumentation there may be no objective or intersubjective way\nto determine which side outweighs the other.\nPerhaps the most articulate contemporary interpreter of the notion of\nincommensurability is Joseph Raz. He defines the condition of two reasons\nfor action being \u201cincommensurate\u201d in the following way:\nTwo competing reasons (for specific actions on specific occasions) are\nincommensurate if and only if it is not true that one defeats the other, nor\nthat they are of equal strength or stringency. They are incommensurate\nin strength, that is, reason does not determine which of them should be\nfollowed, not even that there is equal reason to follow either. When\nreasons are incommensurate, they are rendered optional, not because it is\nequally good (or right or reasonable) to choose the option supported by\neither reason, but because it is reasonable to choose either option (for\nboth are supported by an undefeated reason) and it is not unreasonable or\nwrong to refrain from pursuing either option (for both are opposed by an\nundefeated reason). (2000, pp. 102-103)\nRaz describes his own belief in the everyday occurrence of\nincommensurate reasons as a \u201cclassical\u201d stance, as against a \u201crationalist\u201d\none. There are, according to Raz, three crucial differences between the two\nconceptions:\nFirst, the rationalist conception regards reasons as requiring action,\nwhereas the classical conception regards reasons as rendering options\neligible. Second, the rationalist conception regards the agent's own\ndesire as a reason, whereas the classical conception regards the will as\nan independent factor. Third, the classical conception presupposes the\nexistence of widespread incommensurabilities of reasons for action,\nwhereas the rationalist conception, if not committed to complete\ncommensurability, is committed to the view that incommensurabilities\nare relatively rare anomalies. The three differences come down to a\ncontrast between the rationalist view that generally rational choices and\nrational actions are determined by one's reasons or one's belief in reasons\nand are explained by them, as against the classical conception that\nregards typical choices and actions as determined by a will that is\ninformed and constrained by reason but plays an autonomous role in\naction. (2000, pp. 47-48)\n177 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nIn other words, \u201crationalists\u201d believe that reasons for one action are\nnecessarily stronger than those for another, and hence that they \u201crequire\u201d or\n\u201cdetermine\u201d that action. Classicists, such as Raz and the other moral\nphilosophers I have cited, and everyone in the classical rhetorical tradition,\nincluding myself, believe that on moral and other practical issues there is\noption or choice, or if you will, legitimate enduring dissensus, not just in\npractice but also in theory.\nThe important insight from moral philosophy has now been fully spelled\nout for us argumentation theorists, and it is time for us to offer some\ninsights to them in return. The point is that after philosophers realize there\nis no required or determinable solution to a practical issue, they tend to\nconclude that there is no more to be said, and people will just have to plump\nfor one or the other solution. This probably leaves many philosophers\nfeeling slightly uneasy. After all, philosophy trades in general solutions to\nproblems. Not that they do not admit of heated discussions of alternative\nsolutions, but usually the philosophical assumption is that if a solution to a\nproblem holds, then it holds generally, that is, for all. Consequently, if an\nissue is indeed optional, philosophical argument about it stops.\nWhat we can teach philosophers, if indeed we understand it ourselves, is\nthat even if there is no determinable philosophical solution to an issue, that\ndoes not mean that we cannot or should not argue about it. Although\npractical issues are in principle optional, not determinable, argument about\nthem certainly goes on, and it should. Although an individual is free to\nchoose on practical issues, that individual may change his mind, and he may\nbe worked upon.\nThe kind of argumentation through which we may work upon other\nindividuals\u2019 free choice is rhetoric. The core of rhetoric is argumentation\nintended to work upon other individuals\u2019 choices regarding actions that they\nare free to undertake. This has been settled in the rhetorical tradition at least\nsince Aristotle, who uses the verb bouleuein/bouleuesthai about the kind of\nreasoning that constitutes rhetoric. It is a word that we usually translate to\n\u201cdeliberate,\u201d and it is derived from boul\u0113, a word with an original meaning\nof \u201cwill,\u201d related to the Latin volo and the English will. Aristotle repeatedly\ninsists that what we may deliberate about is only actions we may choose to\nundertake. As he says in the Nichomachean Ethics, III: \u201cany particular set\nof men deliberates about the things attainable by their own actions\u201d\n(1112a). So rhetoric is debate about choosing action, and by the same token\nit is aimed at individuals and does not pretend to find solutions that are\nbinding for all. (For a fuller statement of this, see this volume, Ch. 2.)\n178 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nIf a philosopher now asks, \u201cBut how can we argue about individual\noptions?\u201d the obvious answer is that the points where we can work\nrhetorically on individual choices are the same points where dissensus may\narise in the first place: the sources of reasonable disagreement identified by\nRawls and systematized earlier on in this paper. First, we may discuss facts.\nSecondly, the categories we use to subsume facts. And thirdly, matters of\ndegree based on circumstances. But then, in the practical domain, where the\nissue is not what is true but what to do, we have two further complications:\nthere may be conflict between equally relevant reasons on both sides, and\nthey are not objectively commensurable. Rawls says that these\ncomplications are \u201cpeculiar to reasoning about values\u201d (1989, p. 236). An\nexample might illustrate why.\nAs a model case of deliberation by a collective body on a practical issue\nwe may take the case of a family considering the purchase of a large\nChesterfield armchair. The parents, let us call them Dick and Jane, happen\nto agree that such a chair is comfortable, but also that it is somewhat\ninelegant, not to say ugly. So comfort and elegance are two value concepts\nshared by both Dick and Jane, but unfortunately they find that in this case\nthese two value concepts conflict. Dick and Jane, too, are in conflict,\nbecause Dick values the chair\u2019s comfort so highly that he wants to buy it,\nwhile Jane finds its ugliness so prohibitive that she will have none of it.\nThey have discussed the issue at length but find that there is no objective\nway for them to balance the comfort against the ugliness in a way they can\nboth agree on. He finds that comfort trumps ugliness, she has it the other\nway around. We have a classic case of legitimate and enduring dissensus.\nThis occurs because we are in the practical domain, and in that domain the\nissue is not about truth and facts, but on decisions based on values assigned\nto facts.\nAt this point, I cannot help citing one of my favorite examples of how\npeople, when considering issues in the practical domain, may agree in\nprinciple that something has a positive value, yet their views may diverge\nwidely as to just how great a positive value it has. In Jane Austen\u2019s Pride\nand Prejudice Mr Collins, the unctuous clergyman, says, in proposing\nmarriage to Elizabeth Bennet: \u201cMy situation in life, my connections with\nthe family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\ncircumstances highly in my favour\u201d (II, xix). As we know, Elizabeth does\nnot think these circumstances are as highly in his favour as all that.\nThese examples further show something that many argumentation\nscholars take to be rather scandalous, namely that at least as far as the\n179 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\n\u201cweight\u201d or \u201cstrength\u201d factor in practical reasoning is concerned, there is an\nineradicable element of subjectivity in argument appraisal. To those who\nargue that the admission of such subjectivity compromises argumentation\ntheory, branding it as relativism and the like, I reply that their own theories\nare deficient for not seeing what moral philosophers since antiquity have\nseen, namely the inherent audience-relativity of argumentation over issues\nwhere values are involved\u2014as they are in deliberative debate. In\nargumentation theory, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969) were perhaps\nthe first to fully understand this kind of subjectivity. The divergent \u201cvalue\nhierarchies\u201d of audiences is one of the concepts in which they find this\nsubjectivity expressed. It is the same subjectivity that is brought in by\nRawls\u2019s last two points, which, as you will recall, are \u201cpeculiar to reasoning\nabout values.\u201d\nOur examples also show that pro and con arguments in the practical\ndomain typically have the status of advantages and drawbacks as perceived\nby the arguers. Dick and Jane happen to agree on all the advantages and\ndrawbacks of the armchair. For both of them, those advantages and\ndrawbacks are inherent in the chair. But Dick and Jane disagree on how\nmuch weight to assign to them. And no advantages or drawbacks are\nrefuted, rebutted or defeated even if either Dick or Jane prevails. Even if the\narmchair scheme is abandoned, an armchair like this does not cease to be\ncomfortable. If the family actually buys the chair, it remains inelegant.\nIn the epistemic domain, by contrast, pro and con arguments are only\nimportant by virtue of their probative or inferential force (or, with a word\nused by some theorists and derived from the same verb as \u201cinferential\u201d:\ntheir illative force); that is, they are important for what they appear to\nsignify or suggest, not for what they are. Once the issue has been decided\none way or the other, the arguments supporting the discarded position lose\ntheir relevance.\nThe example of the armchair further shows that in the practical domain\npro and con arguments may be real and relevant simultaneously. The\nadvantages and drawbacks are real to the arguers and remain so. In\nepistemic argumentation, on the other hand, the pro and con arguments may\nin themselves be real circumstances, but the two opposite states of affairs\nsignified by the pro and con arguments, respectively, may not both be real\nsimultaneously.\nAlso, this means that in practical argumentation no party can be logically\nproven to be either right or wrong. In principle, arguments in the practical\ndomain can never be \u201cvalid\u201d in the sense of entailing their conclusion, nor\n180 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\ncan they be \u201csufficient\u201d to entail a conclusion. No matter how many\narguments you muster for your proposal, your opponent is never compelled\nby those arguments to accept it. This is why, as we have seen, the practical\ndomain is one of choice.\nFurther, the strength or weight of arguments in practical argumentation\nis a matter of degrees. Advantages and drawbacks come in all sizes. Along\nwith this comes the fact that practical argumentation typically persuades by\ndegrees. An individual may gradually come to attribute more weight to a\ngiven argument, so he or she may gradually become more favorably\ndisposed towards the proposal. This is one of the reasons why argument in\nmatters of choice is meaningful.\nFinally, let us repeat that practical reasoning crucially depends on\nindividuals\u2019 subjective value assignment. That goes for each single reason\ngiven in the discussion of the issue, but also for the balancing of the\nmultiple, incommensurable reasons relevant to the case.\nThe type of argumentation described here is really a branch of Carl\nWellman\u2019s \u201cconductive reasoning.\u201d Govier among others has adopted this\nterm, but does not distinguish as I wish to between arguments in the\nepistemic and the practical domain. What I have just been describing is\npractical reasoning. All practical reasoning is conductive, but not all\nconductive reasoning is practical.\nNow that we have established practical reasoning as a separate domain\nof argumentation with particular properties, we may ask: what norms may\nwe appropriately apply to this kind of argumentation?\nFirst, we may conclude that as criteria in argument evaluation, the\nnotions of validity, inference, sufficiency all have to go; no arguments for\nor against actions have any of these properties. \u201cSufficiency\u201d or \u201cadequacy\u201d\nare no change or improvement on the traditional \u201cvalidity\u201d requirement. If\n\u201csufficiency\u201d is to have a clear meaning, it must mean, as in mathematics,\nthat there is inference. And inference, in a nutshell, is the negation of\nchoice.\nFurthermore, since even reasonable people arguing reasonably cannot be\nexpected to reach consensus, we may conclude that a set of norms that\nposits eventual consensus as the goal of reasonable discussion, such as the\nargumentation theories of Habermas or Pragma-dialectics, is not applicable\nto practical reasoning.\nBut if consensus is not the goal of discussion, and if it may even be\nlegitimate for discussants to remain fully committed to their initial\n181 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nstandpoints, a set of norms should perhaps be more concerned with what\ndiscussion can do for the audience.\nThe function of practical argumentation for its audience would more\nmeaningfully be defined in terms of the enlightenment it might provide, i.e.,\nthe extent to which it equips the audience to make up their own minds on\nthe issue. Since argumentation in the practical domain is never compelling,\nand since inference does not exist, and since the audience\u2019s needs are\ncentral, it seems reasonable that such argumentation should not be required\nto permit an inference to its conclusion, but rather to supply explicit and\nrelevant informative reasons at any point of dispute.\nAlso, since there will usually be several relevant reasons and counter\nconsiderations, belonging to different dimensions, it becomes essential that\ndebaters should, in the metaphorical sense, weigh those reasons and\nconsiderations up against each other. \u201cWeighing\u201d here does not mean\n\u201cmeasuring,\u201d because there is no such thing, but it does mean \u201ccomparing.\u201d\nEach debater must use the resources of rhetoric somehow to hold the\nmultidimensional pros and cons together, making a bid as to his or her own\nindividual assessment of how they compare and balance, and giving\naudience members added input to make their own individual assessments.\nFrom these principles we might derive rules such as the following:\nFor any point where dissensus exists, debaters must give reasons. This\ngoes not only for the dominating standpoint for which each debater argues,\nbut also for each argument given at a lower place in the argument hierarchy.\nMore specifically, this implies that if a debater does not recognize the\nacceptability, relevance or weight of one of the opponent\u2019s arguments, he\nmust give reasons for this non-recognition. Similarly, if a debater does not\nwant an objection to one of his arguments to stand, he must give reasons\nwhy it does not stand.\nWe should note at this point that recognizing an argument given by the\nopponent does not mean that acceptance of his standpoint or proposal can\nbe inferred. As we have seen, in the practical domain there is no such thing\nas inference. This is worth emphasizing, because political debaters often\nseem compulsively to deny each and every argument given by opponents,\napparently for fear that if they did concede the relevance of any point made\nby the opposition, they would be compelled by inference to accept the\nopposing standpoint. This kind of behavior polarizes and distorts public\ndebate, and it goes to show how mistaken it is to think of practical\nargumentation in terms of inference.\n182 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nThe explicitness principle, turned into a negative, further implies that on\nany point where dissensus exists, a debater should not implicitly assume his\nor her own view to be generally accepted. This sounds obvious, but this\ntype of behavior accounts for many of the \u201cspin\u201d maneuvers and other\nmisdemeanors we find in political debate. Discussions of issues such as\nabortion, taxation, or terrorism are full of linguistic maneuvers in which a\nview or assumption that part of the audience contests is taken for granted by\nmeans of framing language, presupposition, conversational implicature, and\nthe like. On all such points argumentation scholars should insist that any\nassumption on which there is dissensus should be made explicit and\nsupported by reasons. And the same principle also dictates that any reasons\ngiven by opponent should be answered\u2014either rebutted or acknowledged,\nand if acknowledged, compared and \u201cweighed,\u201d all on the assumption that\nin conductive reasoning there may be non-rebuttable reasons on both sides.\nAll in all, it can be said that in this revised set of norms for legitimate\ndissensus answering becomes essential. And because advantages and\ndrawbacks are properties of the proposal they argue for, not just signifiers,\nand hence do not go away, there will often be relevant counter\nconsiderations. So, to recall the armchair example, an appropriate answer\nfrom Jane to Dick\u2019s argument that a Chesterfield chair is comfortable is not\nto deny this fact or its relevance to the issue, but to explain why, in Jane\u2019s\nview, this property counts for less than the chair\u2019s negative value on another\ndimension, that of elegance. Jane can never prove to Dick or to the\naudience, which in this case means Dick and Jane\u2019s teenage kids, Ethan and\nChelsea, that this is so; consequently, Jane must try to make them see it.\nShe will have to use rhetoric to win their support of the way she balances\nthe incompatible and incommensurable values involved in the issue. She\nmight not be able to win over Dick himself, but Ethan and/or Chelsea might\neventually come down on her side, and that might settle the issue. What she\nshould not do, neither for her own sake nor in the light of reasonable norms\nof legitimate dissensus, is to flatly deny or ignore the argument that the\nchair is comfortable. For an audience member who considers both comfort\nand elegance to be relevant, and who needs input to help them decide for\nthemselves which is weightier, such a debater is no help at all.\nThe Australian political scientist John Dryzek is among those who deny\nthat consensus is the reasonable theoretical endpoint of deliberative debates.\nInstead he has introduced the concept of meta-consensus. As we have done\nhere, he sees deliberative debate as having three levels: that of normative\nvalues, that of epistemic beliefs (\u201cfacts\u201d), and based on these two, that of\n183 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\npreferences regarding action. Dryzek, writing with Simon Niemeyer,\ndefines normative meta-consensus as \u201cagreement on recognition of the\nlegitimacy of a value, though not extending to agreement on which of two\nor more values ought to receive priority in a given decision\u201d (Dryzek and\nNiemeyer 2006, p. 639; the term \u201cnormative meta-consensus\u201d corresponds\nto \u201caxiological consensus\u201d in Rescher 1993). One norm of argumentation in\nthe case of enduring dissensus is that a debater should recognize the\nlegitimacy of a value to which his opponent appeals if he himself shares\nthat value, even when he disagrees on its relative priority. Such a situation\nobtained between Dick and Jane on the armchair issue. Dryzek also notes\nthat \u201cadversarial processes (such as Anglo-American legal systems) may\nweaken normative meta-consensus if they frame issues in ways that induce\nadvocates to denigrate the legitimacy of the values of the other side.\u201d He\nsuggests that \u201cone of the main tasks of deliberation could be to uncover\nexisting normative meta-consensus obscured by the strategic actions of\npartisans who try to de-legitimate the values held by their opponents\u201d\n(2006, p. 639).\nThe debate that has been going on for the last twenty years or so in my\nown country, Denmark, about issues relating to immigration and\nimmigrants, provides many examples of argumentation flouting this norm.\nOne controversial issue has been the legislation introduced by the current\nright-wing government regulating the residence in Denmark of couples\nwhere one spouse is a Danish national and the other is not. Among other\nthings, both spouses must be at least 24; there are income, housing and\nemployment requirements; and the combined \u201cattachment\u201d of the spouses\nto Denmark must be greater than their attachment to any other country.\nSupporters of these rules have argued that they help integration and prevent\nmany forced marriages. Opponents have argued that these rules curtail\npersonal freedom, including citizens\u2019 rights to live in their home country\nwith spouses of their choice.\nOn the whole, opponents of this law have tended to focus single-\nmindedly on these values and have rarely addressed the law\u2019s alleged social\nbenefits, including its presumed effects against forced marriages\u2014a\nconsideration that has made a certain number of immigrant women support\nthe law. I would argue that while argumentation theory could not expect or\nrequire opponents on such an issue to reach consensus, they should not\nbehave as if one principle might decide the issue as it were by inference;\ninstead they should recognize the relevance of the alleged social benefits\nappealed to by the other side. We might add that arguably personal freedom\n184 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nis involved on both sides of the issue: on the one hand, the law curtails\npeople\u2019s freedom of marriage and/or residence, but on the other hand the\nargument is that the law extends young people\u2019s freedom to avoid forced\nmarriages. So what one might expect from the law\u2019s opponents is that they\nexplain why, in their view, these alleged advantages do not outweigh the\nrather obvious drawback of curtailing certain personal freedoms. To supply\nsuch an explanation, opponents might spell out the effects of these\ncurtailments based on specific examples, either authentic or devised; or they\nmight seek to reduce the perceived benefits of the law by using statistics to\nshow that forced marriages are a small or a dwindling problem; or they\nmight make a pathos-based attempt to heighten the perceived weight of\nindividual freedom as a principle; or they might analogize to other cases of\nfreedom-curtailing legislation that most people would agree to condemn; or\nthey might try to show that the legislation will create more social ills than\nbenefits and in effect counteract integration. This amounts to saying that\nthey might use any and all of the resources of rhetoric to help them compare\nthe weights of the pros and cons. In fact, rhetorical resources are all we\nhave to help us compare those weights and decide on the issue, since they\ncannot be weighed, measured or calculated in any objective way. But\ncompare them we must.\nWe might add to this that such a meta-consensus might be called for not\nonly where debaters disagree on the priorities of values in a given case, but\nalso when they disagree on their very applicability to that case. The\nnotorious affair of the Muhammad cartoons which a Danish daily published\non September 30, 2005, and which, the following winter, caused a political\ncrisis in Denmark and serious unrest with deaths and destruction in many\nMuslim countries, is a case in point. In Denmark, one side in the debate that\nensued held that freedom of speech was at issue, while the other held that\ninterpersonal respect was at issue. However, the issue separating the two\nopposed factions in the Danish debate was not, as they should both have\nrecognized, their commitment to the value of freedom of expression, but\ntheir interpretation of the specific events of the affair. A similar view,\nhighlighting the role of interpretation in apparently intractable conflicts, has\nbeen suggested by the philosopher Georgia Warnke in Legitimate\nDifferences (1999). Since the dispute in Denmark was not really over\nprinciples and values, but over the interpretation of the cartoons in relation\nto those values, the debate ought to have been about that interpretation, not\nabout whether certain people had betrayed the cause of freedom of\nexpression. But the supporters of the cartoons on the whole did not enter\n185 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\ninto debate about their view that the publication of them was indeed a\nmatter of defending freedom of expression; rather they argued in a way that\ntook this contested interpretation for granted. This they did using linguistic\nmechanisms such as framing, presupposition, implicature, etc. What should\nhave been the issue of explicit argumentation from both sides, namely the\nproper conceptual interpretation of the newspaper\u2019s act, was an issue on\nwhich the cartoon-supporters presented almost no explicit argumentation.\nInstead, they used their energy to say that those who had criticized the\ncartoons or failed to lend the newspaper their whole-hearted support, for\nexample by refusing to reprint them, were to be roundly condemned for\nbetraying freedom of expression. On February 26, 2006, Prime Minister\nFogh Rasmussen said in an interview with a national daily: \u201cWriters and\nothers, who so much live by the freedom of expression, have, as you know,\nfailed in this matter. \u2026 As far as I am concerned, the sheep have been\nseparated from the goats.\u201d Thus the pro-cartoon faction, led by the Prime\nMinister, illegitimately took their interpretation for granted instead of\ndefending it; but the faction that was critical of the cartoons, in its insistence\nthat the matter had nothing to do freedom of expression, but instead with\nlack of proper respect for religious minorities, perhaps did not sufficiently\narticulate their shared allegiance to freedom of expression and their concern\nthat certain tendencies in Muslim populations were in fact a threat to that\nfreedom. The reason for this was presumably their view that freedom of\nexpression was not relevant to the case at all, since they had not questioned\nthe newspaper\u2019s right to print the cartoons. Yet they might have helped\nbring about a meta-consensus by admitting that the situation seen in a\nbroader perspective clearly did make freedom of expression an important\nconcern. What happened subsequently in the Danish debate was a\npredictable orgy of name-calling. The pro-cartoon debaters in particular\nwere uninhibited in taking their own contested interpretation as a given\neven though they must have known that their opponents did not\nacknowledge it\u2014a maneuver that has been described as linguistic\n\u201cbullying\u201d (Harder and Kock 1976). Both factions in the heat of the\nsquabble thrashed away at obvious straw men; for example, a past Minister\nof Foreign Affairs who had from the beginning been critical of the\nnewspaper\u2019s publication of the cartoons was accused, by implicature, of\nadvocating groveling surrender to the violent protesters in the Middle East.\nThe whole debate showed all the symptoms of pernicious and pointless\npolarization. The diagnosis: no one made the attempt to find any kind of\nnormative meta-consensus, on the basis of which there could have been a\n186 Norms of Legitimate Dissensus\nreasoned and explicit discussion of the interpretations and weightings over\nwhich debaters were actually, and legitimately, in dissensus.\nFor some appropriate concluding remarks to these reflections on norms\nof legitimate dissensus we might again turn to John Rawls. His listing of the\nsources of reasonable disagreement leads to what he calls \u201cprecepts of\nreasonable discussion.\u201d They are, in slightly abbreviated form:\nFirst, the political discussion aims to reach reasonable agreement, and\nhence so far as possible should be conducted to serve that aim. We\nshould not readily accuse one another of self- or group-interest,\nprejudice or bias, and of such deeply entrenched errors as ideological\nblindness and delusion. \u2026\nSecond, when we are reasonable we are prepared to find substantive\nand even intractable disagreements on basic questions. \u2026\nThird, when we are reasonable, we are ready to enter discussion\ncrediting others with a certain good faith. We expect deep differences of\nopinion, and accept this diversity as the normal state of the public\nculture of a democratic society. (1989, pp. 238-239)\nAnother way of stating the same desiderata is to say, with Amy\nGutmann and Denis Thompson in Why Deliberative Democracy?, that we\nneed norms of dissensus \u201cwhich permit greater moral disagreement about\npolicy and greater moral agreement on how to disagree about policy\u201d (2004,\np. 65).\nREFERENCES\nAristotle. 1995.

From all this follows a view of the rhetor\u2019s special obligation\nin democratic, deliberative rhetoric on which it becomes crucial, in the\ninterest of the audience, that political debaters acknowledge good\narguments on the opposite side and explain why, on balance, they deem the\narguments favoring their own side to be stronger.\nThe present paper has sprung from an intuitive sense that much is amiss\nin the way public political debate is generally conducted, even in societies\nwith entrenched commitments to democracy and free speech. I believe any\nargumentation scholar who listens for some time to public debating by\ncontemporary politicians, whether in legislative bodies or in the media, will\nagree that debaters routinely engage in dialectical moves that impede rather\nthan promote the purposes of the debate, whatever they are. While\nsubscribing to Johnson\u2019s seminal notion of a separate \u201cdialectical tier\u201d in\nargumentation (2000; 2002), I nevertheless believe that current theories of\nargumentation are not sufficiently sensitive to the distinctive properties of\npolitical and other deliberative argumentation to provide meaningful criteria\nfor a normative critique of debate in that sphere. Therefore, the aim of this\npaper is, on the basis of a discussion of these distinctive properties, to\nindicate what I see as the central dialectical obligations of public political\n* Originally published in Informal Logic 27 (2007), 223-47.

Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\ndebaters, so that argumentation theorists will have firmer theoretical\ngrounds for criticism of what they hear.\nThe nature of deliberative argumentation\nPolitical debate, as a subcategory of deliberative argumentation, is\nultimately about undertaking action, not about the truth or falsity of\nstatements. Another way of saying this is that deliberative argumentation\ngenerally is not about propositions but about proposals. (An alternative\nterm is policies; one advantage of it is that support of the status quo, i.e., the\nrejection of a proposal, can also be called a policy.)\nTo be sure, deliberative argumentation usually involves debate, often of\na heated kind, over propositions that may be true or false, e.g., about\nwhether a certain dictator has (or has had) weapons of mass destruction, or\nwhether a certain tax reform will mainly benefit the rich; but the issues that\ndeliberative argumentation is ultimately about are proposals for action, such\nas invading the dictator\u2019s country or adopting the tax reform. What is at\nissue in regard to such actions is whether to undertake them, not whether\nthey are \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d\nThe proposition-proposal distinction in itself is not unfamiliar to\nphilosophers. It is related to Aristotle\u2019s separation of the three domains of\ntheoria, poi\u0113sis, and pr\u0101xis, where proposals belong to the latter. It has\ncorrelates in contemporary thinking as well. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, for one, has\nemphatically pointed to the differences between various types of claims that\npeople may argue for. In practical argumentation one does not, according to\nHabermas, argue about the truth of propositions, but about the rightness of\nactions (Habermas, 1997).\nNot realized by many theorists, however, this distinction implies deep\ndifferences in the way argumentation works, depending on whether the\nissue is a proposition or a proposal.\nOne difference is that, in the standard case, there are often not just\narguments on both sides, but good arguments on both sides. The non-\ntechnical word \u201cgood\u201d reflects the fact that arguments about proposals are\ntypically different from arguments about propositions. Arguments about\nproposals primarily refer to alleged advantages or drawbacks of adopting\nthe proposal or of rejecting it.11 This is why there are \u201cgood\u201d arguments\n11 This is a simplification: by focusing on telic arguments, i.e., the \u201cadvantages\u201d and\n\u201cdrawbacks\u201d of proposals, we bypass arguments of a deontic nature, e.g., that a proposed\nwar might be a contravention of international law. But acknowledgement of this and other\n191 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nboth pro and con. If the proposal is for a war in a foreign country to depose\nits tyrannical dictator, then his elimination will be an advantage of that\npolicy, but a drawback of it will be that in wars lives are lost. Notice that\nnone of these facts can \u201ccancel out\u201d the other.\nThis example also demonstrates another distinctive property of\narguments about proposals: although they may be perfectly real, relevant,\nand hence \u201cgood,\u201d they are never what logicians call \u201cvalid,\u201d in the sense\nthat if the argument is true, then the truth of the conclusion follows by\nnecessity (i.e., as an inference). Since proposals can be neither true nor\nfalse, validity is a misplaced concept in relation to argumentation about\nproposals. Not only could the \u201ctruth\u201d of a proposal not follow from\nanything, but neither does the adoption of the proposal \u201cfollow\u201d by any\nkind of necessity or inference from any number of \u201cgood\u201d arguments. The\nproposed action may have n undeniable advantages speaking in its favor,\nwhich hence earn the status of \u201cgood\u201d arguments, yet they are not valid in\nthe traditional sense, nor are they even \u201csufficient,\u201d neither singly nor in\nconjunction. The tyrannical dictator\u2019s removal might, per se and all else\nequal, be seen as a great advantage of the war and hence as a very good\nargument in its favor, perhaps one of many, yet no number of convergent\narguments would be sufficient to cause the war plan to follow as a\nnecessary or \u201cvalid\u201d inference; many people would still, legitimately,\nwithhold support from it.\nThis is because the advantages (benefits) of any proposed action are\nalways offset by its concomitant drawbacks (costs). War, for example,\nalways has costs, measurable in lives, welfare, money, and other\ndimensions.\nGenerally speaking, since any proposal is likely to have both benefits\nand costs, and since they can both be true at the same time, it will be\nappropriate for those who are to decide on the proposal, not only to\nconsider the pro and con arguments, but to compare them.\nIn argumentation about propositions, on the other hand, pro and con\narguments are typically not about advantages and drawbacks. Instead, their\nrelevance depends on their probative or inferential force (or, with a word\nused by some theorists and derived from the same verb as \u201cinferential\u201d:\ntypes of arguments only lends increased strength to the points made in this section: that\narguments for or against proposals refer to inherent properties of the proposals and do not\ncancel out each other.\n192 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\ntheir illative force). They are relevant transitively, i.e., by virtue of what\nthey appear to point to, signify or suggest, not for what they are. This means\nthat pro and con arguments cannot both signify truly at the same time. If\nseveral arguments speak for a proposition p, while several others speak for\nnon-p, both sets may be well-considered, yet p and non-p cannot both be\ntrue at the same time. Once a dispute over a proposition has been decided\none way or the other, the arguments signifying the truth of the rejected\nproposition have been determined to signify falsely or misleadingly and\nhave been denied the illative force they were previously held to possess.\nIn contrast, an argument about a proposal, in referring to an advantage or\ndrawback of it, refers to an inherent property of the proposed action. An\naction has many properties, instantiating many dimensions. Some of them\nwill be seen as advantages/benefits, others as drawbacks/costs. Once the\ndispute over the proposal has been decided one way or the other (for\nexample by democratic vote), the arguments referring to the advantages of\nthe rejected policy have not thereby been judged wrong, nor have the\narguments referring to the adopted policy\u2019s drawbacks. We opt for a policy\nbecause we place a higher value on its inherent advantages than we do on\nits inherent drawbacks, but in the standard case there will be advantages and\ndrawbacks that remain in force simultaneously and do not cancel out each\nother.\nThe reason why properties on the pro and con side do not cancel each\nother out is that the warrants that valorize them are values which are\nmutually incompatible. We are faced here with what Isaiah Berlin called the\n\u201cpluralism\u201d of values, meaning that \u201cnot all good things are compatible,\nstill less all the ideals of mankind.\u201d For example, \u201cneither political equality\nnor efficient organization nor social justice is compatible with more than a\nmodicum of individual liberty\u201d (1958, repr. 1998, p. 238).\nValue concepts, such as those cited here, constitute the warrants that\ndeliberative argumentation relies on. For example, individual liberty,\nbroadly defined, will serve as a warrant for many of those who support a\nwar because it topples a tyrannical dictator. But Berlin insists that a value\nendorsed by one individual or party will often be incompatible with another\nvalue endorsed by another individual or party (this is value diversity);\nmoreover, and more critically, the values held by any one individual (or one\nculture) may also be incompatible\u2014in the sense that one of these values can\nonly be fully realized at the cost of at least one of the others.\nSeveral contemporary moral philosophers have argued that value\npluralism, in this sense, is a condition of our everyday existence (cf., e.g.,\n193 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nSinnott-Armstrong 1988, Stocker 1990, Lukes 1991, Larmore 1996, Finnis\n2\n1998, Raz 1998). This is why arguments that we recognize as real and\nrelevant about a policy may still be contradictory: argument A for the policy\nis warranted by a certain value to which we are committed, but argument B\nagainst the policy is warranted by another value to which we are also\ncommitted.\nEven so, value pluralism might not be a major difficulty in deliberation\n(and in argumentation theory), and a form of value monism might yet be\nderived, if these values were not also incommensurable\u2014meaning that no\n\u201ccommon denominator\u201d can be found, providing \u201ca common basis for\ndetermining, in given situations, the respective weights of the conflicting\ncommitments\u201d (Larmore 1996, p. 157).\nIncompatibility and incommensurability are often confused, and both\nconcepts are sometimes confused with value diversity. Drawing on Lukes\n(1991, pp. 10-11), we may distinguish between them as follows. Diversity\nmeans that different people are committed to different values (which may\nbe incompatible). Incompatibility means the potentiality of conflict between\ntwo values; if they are held by the same individual or group, we have value\npluralism, meaning that the values to which that individual or group is\ncommitted are not one, but many. Value pluralism may be superficial if the\nconflicting values may both be converted into a common denominator; but\nit is profound if incommensurability also obtains, that is, if the arguments\nrelying on the conflicting values are not \u201crankable with respect to a\ncommon denominator of value\u201d (Larmore 1996, p. 159). As a result, we\ncannot do what John Finnis describes in the following way: \u201cAggregate the\npluses, subtract the minuses, and pursue the option with the highest\nbalance\u201d (1998, p. 216). That is, in deliberative argumentation there may be\nno objective or intersubjective way to determine which side outweighs the\nother.\nThe underlying reason for this is that arguments for and against a\nproposal often belong to different \u201cdimensions\u201d: they refer to properties of\nirreducibly different kinds. That is, we are not talking about situations like a\nbusiness investment that has involved a cost of a certain size and brought a\nreturn of a certain size; return and cost have the same dimension (money),\nand when one is deducted from the other we get the net result: the profit.\nAlso, we are not just talking about the sort of incommensurability first\nidentified by the ancient mathematicians who found that, e.g., the side of a\nsquare and its diagonal are incommensurable. Although the ratio between\nthe two can never be expressed by rational numbers, they still instantiate the\n194 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nsame dimension: length. Hence they are objectively comparable, and it is\neasy to demonstrate that the diagonal is longer than the side (cf. Stocker\n1990, p. 176).\nIn contrast, the benefit gained by freeing a foreign country of its\ntyrannical dictator versus the loss of many lives (one\u2019s own troops as well\nas the foreign country\u2019s citizens) are two arguments (among many) which,\nwhile relating to the same policy, represent qualitatively different\ndimensions. There is no intersubjective, algorithmic way of measuring them\non the same scale. They do not have comparable \u201clengths\u201d or \u201cweights.\u201d\nThe cost on one dimension is not restored on the other dimension; to\noutweigh the cost, a qualitatively different benefit is sought (cf. Stocker\n1990, pp. 272-277). We may refer to this property as the irreducible\nmultidimensionality of deliberative argumentation (Kock 2003).\nBut although relevant arguments in deliberative argumentation may be\nincompatible, as well as incommensurable, they are not, as everyday\nexperience will remind us, incomparable. When facing a choice where\nrelevant arguments are contradictory, individuals do compare them and\nchoose. So incommensurability precludes neither comparability nor choice;\nthis observation is made emphatically by, e.g., Larmore (1996), and Raz\n(1986, 1998).\nWhat is less strongly emphasized in moral philosophy is that since there\nis no intersubjectively compelling reasoning determining such choices (and\nif there were, they would not be choices), they are in fact subjective. In\ndeliberative debate over a proposal to go to war each legislator and, ideally,\neach citizen, must choose individually (\u201csubjectively\u201d) which policy to\nsupport. This is so not because \u201ctruth\u201d is subjective (e.g., on whether the\ndictator has weapons of mass destruction) but because the values that\nfunction as warrants in deliberation are subjective as well as\nincommensurable.\nAdd to this the facts that all individuals may not interpret the values they\nshare in the same way when applying them to specific phenomena (this is\nthe central issue in Warnke 1999); and that although they may be\ncommitted to shared values, their commitments may be differently ranked\n(this is the meaning of Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca\u2019s \u201cvalue\nhierarchies\u201d); and that they may not be committed to all the same values.\nAll this means that when deliberating individuals compare pro and con\narguments\u2014and they do, defying incommensurability\u2014the choices ensuing\nfrom these acts of comparing will differ from one individual to the next; in\n195 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nother words, the choices will, in all these respects, be subjective\u2014and\nlegitimately so.\nA last, important characteristic of deliberative argumentation is that, for\nall the reasons just laid out, it cannot be expected, not even as a theoretical\nideal, that it will lead towards consensus. For example, even individuals\nsharing the same values will, facing a proposal of war in a distant country,\nopt for different policies, if for no other reason because their value\nhierarchies (or \u201cpriorities\u201d) are different. Some will decide that large-scale\nwar, with heavy foreseeable losses, is a sad but acceptable cost to pay to\nwin democracy for that country; others will accept some casualties, but not\non the scale anticipated by the first group; and some will not endorse any\nwar for such a gain. Very likely only a minority in each of these groups will\nchange their stand, even after prolonged debate (although some might); and\ntheir different stands may be grounded in legitimately different ways of\ncomparing pros and cons. Hence any theory of argumentation which sees it\nas a theoretical norm that they should reach agreement seriously\nmisunderstands the nature of deliberative argumentation.\nBut if not consensus, what could then be the purpose of proponents of\ndifferent policies engaging in deliberative debate? Briefly stated, the main\nreason why such debates are potentially meaningful is that other individuals\nfacing such a choice (legislators and citizens) may hear, consider and\ncompare the arguments relating to the choice. How debates may best fulfill\ntheir function vis-\u00e0-vis these third parties will be the subject of the last part\nof this paper.\nThe inadequacy of alternative models of deliberation\nThe above overview of the properties of argumentation about proposals,\nand by extension, of all deliberative argumentation (indeed all practical\nreasoning), has focused on a handful of distinctive features which may be\nsummarized as follows:\nThere will always be several good but contradictory arguments.\nContradictory arguments do not cancel out each other.\nA good argument never entails a policy by necessity or inference.\nContradictory arguments often rely on plural values which are not\nobjectively commensurable.\nContradictory arguments must nevertheless be compared for choices\nto be made. Choices rely on individuals\u2019 value commitments and are\nsubjective.\n196 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nDebates between exponents of opposite policies cannot be expected\nto lead towards agreement, but may help other individuals consider and\ncompare the pro and con arguments relating to a policy.\nThe view that these statements reflect will recall the notion of\n\u201cconductive argument,\u201d coined by Wellman (1971) and adopted for\ntextbook use by Govier (2005). The acceptance of several good arguments\non both sides and the abandonment of the notions of validity and\nsufficiency are the same (although Govier retains notions like \u201ccogency\u201d\nand \u201cenough reasons\u201d). The nuances that my view of deliberative\nargumentation adds to their \u201cconductive argument\u201d are primarily these:\nFirst, I insist on the distinctive, non-alethic nature of the issues in\ndeliberative argumentation and on the consequent \u201cnon-probative\u201d and\n\u201cnon-cancelable\u201d nature of arguments in that domain; Wellman and Govier\noffer no clear demarcation of the domain of conductive argument, although\nthey note that, for reasons they do not analyze, it tends mainly to occur in\npractical and moral reasoning. Further, because of the evaluative nature of\nwarrants in deliberative argumentation, I insist on the pervasiveness in\nthose warrants of subjectivity, and, because of their multidimensionality, of\ntheir incompatibility and incommensurability. Finally, the legitimacy and\nthe frequent inevitability of dissensus follow from all this.\nA look at these views of deliberative argumentation will soon reveal that\nthey are at odds with several dominant assumptions in contemporary\nargumentation theory. I will briefly consider some current theories of\nargumentation and try to show that they need revision as far as deliberative\nargumentation is concerned. If that is so, then it is to be expected that their\nviews of dialectical obligations in that domain would be off the mark as\nwell, despite the fact that reflection on the dialectical nature of\nargumentation as such is a common and central concern of contemporary\nargumentation theory.\nFor example, the pragma-dialectical school sets up \u201ccritical discussion\u201d\nas the model for all argumentation. As is well known, in critical discussions\nthe shared aim of both discussants is the resolution of their difference of\nopinion. Also crucial in Pragma-dialectics is the concept of reasonableness\nin argumentation; being reasonable means avoiding fallacies, which again\nare defined as argumentative speech acts that obstruct the goal of critical\ndiscussion: resolving the difference of opinion. So the notion of\n\u201creasonableness\u201d and the normativity that are both intrinsic to the pragma-\ndialectical approach are similarly bound up with the ideal of resolution of\nthe difference of opinion (in another word, consensus). In what we might\n197 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\ncall the \u201cclassic\u201d stance of Pragma-dialectics (as in, e.g., van Eemeren and\nGrootendorst 1992, and most recently van Eemeren and Grootendorst\n2004), it remains an alien and suspect idea that both discussants\u2019 driving\nmotive might be to \u201cwin\u201d the discussion rather than to reach consensus.\nHowever, several publications by van Eemeren and Houtlosser (e.g., 1999,\n2000, 2001, 2002) represent a newer phase characterized by a wish to\nintegrate rhetoric in the theory, where \u201crhetoric\u201d is identified with a wish to\n\u201cwin\u201d that results in \u201cstrategic maneuvering.\u201d Such maneuvering is now\nseen as legitimate so long it is not \u201cderailed.\u201d My contention is that\nalthough this new version of Pragma-dialectics shows great understanding\nfor rhetorical devices and has contributed insightful analyses of strategic\nmaneuvering, it has no way of explaining how both discussants may at the\nsame time be legitimately strategic, i.e., legitimately committed to\n\u201cwinning,\u201d and yet also committed to consensus, as Pragma-dialectics\ncontinues to insist that they are. What Pragma-dialectical theory does not\ntake into account, I suggest, is precisely the fact that rhetoric is rooted in\ndeliberative argumentation, a domain where consensus is not to be\nexpected, eve as a theoretical ideal, owing to the domain\u2019s distinctive\nproperties, as laid out above.\nIt is a curious fact that outside of argumentation theory proper, there is\nanother school of thought which has central notions in common with\nPragma-dialectics, and which has had an even wider resonance, yet the two\nschools seem to have almost no cognizance of each other. The political\nphilosophy of J\u00fcrgen Habermas and many who are inspired by him is\ncentered around the ideal of a public discourse where participants obey\n\u201cden zwanglosen Zwang des besseren Arguments\u201d (\u201cthe unforced force of\nthe better argument\u201d) (1972, p. 161), reaching (or approximating) consensus\nalong this road.\nAs we have seen, Habermas, unlike the pragma-dialecticians, recognizes\ndifferences between various types of claims that people may argue for.\nArguing about actions is different from arguing about the truth of\npropositions in that the warrants we appeal to will not be other propositions\nwe hold to be true, but norms of action we hold to be \u201cright.\u201d This rightness\nis a very different kind of validity claim (G\u00fcl-tigkeitsbedingung) from the\ntruth that validates constative speech acts; and both are different from the\nsincerity that validates expressive self-representations and from the\nadequacy of value standards that validates evaluative expressions.\nArgumentation theorists might pay more attention to the distinctions that\nHabermas lays down here. However, his main thrust is to say that even\n198 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nthough a proposal for action makes a distinctive kind of validity claim, it is\nstill just one form of a communicative practice \u201cwhich, against the\nbackground of a lifeworld, is oriented to achieving, sustaining, and\nrenewing consensus\u2014and indeed a consensus that rests on the\nintersubjective recognition of criticizable validity claims\u201d (1997, p. 17).\nSeveral contemporary thinkers in political philosophy\u2014especially those\nconcerned with \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d\u2014have either followed this\nconsensus-oriented line of thought in Habermas, or have thought along\nparallel lines; these include Joshua Cohen (e.g., 1989a, 1989b, 1998),\nJoseph Bessette (1994), and Seyla Benhabib (e.g., 1994, 1996), or a\nrhetorician like Thomas Goodnight (e.g., 1993). Then again, other recent\nthinkers, united mainly by their background in moral philosophy and their\nacknowledgment of real moral conflict, have pointed to the intrinsic\nincompatibility, incommensurability and subjectivity in practical reasoning\nbased on plural values. I have drawn on some of these thinkers in the\ndiscussion above.\nIn argumentation theory proper, another widely held notion is\n\u201cpresumptive reasoning\u201d as discussed in particular by Walton (1996). As\none of the few philosophical argumentation theorists today, Walton sees\npractical reasoning as a separate domain (Walton, 1990) and has (recently)\nrecognized the simple fact that in practical reasoning people argue about a\nproposal, not about a proposition or assertion (2006). But Walton\u2019s attempt\nto see practical argumentation in terms of presumptive reasoning leads to\nrather counterintuitive results. As in argumentation theory generally, a\n\u201cgood\u201d argument in his model of practical argumentation is one that\nlicenses an inference; however, the inference is presumptive or defeasible,\nand what is inferred is not a proposition but an action. Thus if we have a\ngoal G, and if an action A may serve to bring about G, then it is an inference\nthat we should do A\u2014a presumptive inference, that is. This, one might\nobject, implies that any action which may serve to bring about any agreed\ngoal may be presumptively inferred from that fact. But the presumption is\ncanceled again for arguments that can be rebutted, and that happens when\nany one of a list of critical questions about the argument has an affirmative\nanswer. One such question is whether the agent planning the action has\nother goals that should be taken into account (since the action might\ninterfere with them). That, however, is, as we have seen, the standard case:\nthe benefits conferred by any action always have concomitant costs and\nhence interfere with other goals. So presumptive inference as a model of\ndeliberative argumentation implies that, in the first round, any action may\n199 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nbe (presumptively) \u201cinferred\u201d if it brings any benefit, i.e., serves any goal;\nbut then, in the second round, for each of these actions the benefits/goals\ncited on their behalf are rebutted and canceled because of the other goals\ninterfered with. Presumptively, then, any action that might bring any benefit\nshould be undertaken; eventually, however, no arguments for any action are\nany good, so no action should be undertaken at all.\nSuch a model of deliberative argumentation is of little help in describing\nhow we actually use and evaluate deliberative arguments. Argumentation\ntheory paints itself into this kind of corner because it has not taken seriously\nthese intuitive insights: (1) that in deliberative argumentation it is the\nstandard case that there are good arguments on both sides; (2) that a good\nargument for an action does not license an inference to that action; and (3)\nthat good arguments on opposite sides do not cancel out each other. (For a\nfuller statement of my criticism of Walton\u2019s \u201cpresumptive\u201d view of\npractical reasoning, see this volume, Chapter 5.)\nDebaters\u2019 dialectical obligations\nIn this final section of the paper I will discuss what the view of\ndeliberative argumentation presented above implies in regard to debaters\u2019\ndialectical obligations, and I will point out some of the ways in which the\ncurrent assumptions just discussed need, in my view, to be amended.\nBecause good, non-cancelable arguments are likely to exist on both sides\nin deliberative argumentation, it follows that in order to come to a reasoned\ndecision one will need to juxtapose, compare and balance them; and this\ngoes for the audience as well as for the debaters themselves. It is not\nenough that each argument relating to the issue is appraised singly, or even\nthat all the arguments on one side are appraised conjunctively to see if there\nare \u201cenough\u201d or \u201csufficient\u201d grounds for the proposed action to be inferred.\nWalton\u2019s model based on presumptive inference suggests, misleadingly,\nthat if an argument for the opponent\u2019s policy is recognized as good, then, by\nvirtue of this very fact, it already triggers an inference to that policy (albeit\npresumptively). Such a view would urge a debater to seek to \u201crebut\u201d every\ncounterargument at any cost (possibly by turning it into a \u201cstraw man\u201d that\nis easy to rebut), or alternatively to ignore it. In fact this kind of behavior is\nwhat we often see in public political debaters, to the frustration of their\ndeliberating audiences. Another misleading implication of the\n\u201cpresumptive\u201d model is that an argument which has been \u201crebutted\u201d is\nhenceforth counted as null and void, having no strength at all, as if a toggle\n200 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nswitch had been clicked. Rather, the standard case is that some arguments\non both sides have some strength; they do not trigger an inference, but they\nare not null and void either. So the audience very much needs to hear what a\ndebater has to say in regard to such arguments presented against him from\nthe other side; nothing short of this will be trustworthy help for the audience\nin assessing whether arguments in the debate are in fact relevant, and if so,\nhow they compare and balance. What audience members do not need is to\nhear each debater either systematically deny the acceptability or relevance\nof all the opponent\u2019s arguments, or distort them (in order to avoid\nrecognizing them): this will compromise the individual audience member\u2019s\nchance to compare the pros and cons. If each debater instead offers his own\ncomparison of pros and cons, trying sincerely to advise the audience as to\nwhy he sees the arguments on his own side as outbalancing those on the\nother side, then audience members will be substantially helped in making\ntheir own comparison of pros and cons. They will have two contrasting bids\nfor an appropriate comparison to consider; and they will have the\nopportunity to see how well each debater can make his case stand up\nagainst counterarguments. Only by fulfilling these duties can the debater be\ntrustworthy and hence helpful to the deliberating audience member.\nThe fact that the comparison of pros and cons will often involve an\nessentially subjective weighing of them is just another reason why the\naudience will need the debaters\u2019 help and advice in this process: the\ndebaters presumably are individuals who have themselves found or devised\nways to compare the pros and cons on the issue, in spite of their\nincommensurability, and reached assessments they are confident with\n(however mutually contradictory). The debaters can be helpful advisers in\noffering their individual assessments and the considerations that led to\nthem, while recognizing that alternative assessments are legitimate.\nAudiences will not need an attitude on the part of the debaters which\nsuggests that the comparison can only have one correct result, and that\nconsensus on that result ought ideally to ensue; any such view, which\neffectually delegitimizes continued dissensus, suspends the anchoring that\nindividuals\u2019 deliberative decision-making cannot do without: their value\nhierarchies, such as they are.\nIn sum, precisely because there usually are, in the nature of the case,\nlegitimate, non-cancelable arguments on both sides (or all) in political\ndebate, and in view of all that follows from this, it becomes central to a\npolitical debater\u2019s dialectical obligation that he should pay proper and\nexplicit attention to arguments supporting the opposite side. I suggest that\n201 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nthe main consequent specifications of this general requirement are the\nfollowing:\nThe debater\u2019s main dialectical obligation is to make motivated\ncomparisons between contradictory arguments. As we have seen, it is a\nstandard situation that contradictory arguments do not (because of their\nincommensurability) cancel each other out and cannot be objectively\naggregated and weighed against each other; on the other hand, individuals\nwho would choose between rival policies must, and usually somehow\nmanage to, compare the arguments supporting them in ways that assist their\nchoice. Public debaters, who cannot be required or expected to find a\nconsensus, might instead see it as their primary function to help individuals\nwho are third parties to their debate in this choice. This the debaters could\ndo by explaining how contradictory arguments compare in their subjective\nview, and why.\nOften it is not appropriate to try to rebut, refute or deny arguments that\ncontradict one\u2019s own policy. As we have seen, good arguments\ncontradicting a debater\u2019s policy are often grounded in values shared by the\ndebater himself; it is just that the con arguments do not register in the\ndebater\u2019s subjective comparison of pros and cons with the same strength as\nthe pro arguments, or the values grounding the con arguments are lower in\nhis value hierarchy than the values grounding the pro arguments.\nWhichever is the case, the appropriate thing for that debater to do is\nprobably just to explain why it is so. \u201cAppropriate\u201d in this context means:\nlikely to serve the purpose of the debate, insofar as the purpose of the\ndebate is not to achieve consensus between the debaters, but rather to help\nthe third parties in their process of choice.\nSome of the things the debater might do in this attempt at explaining\nmight be to offer specifics about the benefits and/or costs involved in\nadopting either his own or the opposite policy, thereby enhancing the\npresence of these benefits/costs, and thus perhaps causing others to share\nthe assessment on which the pros subjectively outweigh the cons. He might\nalso try to invoke parallels, either of a similar or opposite nature, adducing\nanalogies, precedents, similarities, contrasts, or differences; or he might\nemploy metaphors and other verbal devices to enhance the pros or attenuate\nthe cons relating to his policy. In many cases it will probably be to his own\nadvantage and to the audience\u2019s enlightenment if he chooses the same\ndevices in addressing the audience as have perhaps caused himself to assess\nthe present case as he does, thereby possibly causing individuals in the\naudience to adopt a similar assessment. It might also happen that, on a\n202 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nsomewhat deeper level, the listener is caused to revise the hierarchical\nordering of those values in terms of which he sees the issue, because the\nspecifics and parallels that have been adduced make him, e.g., find the costs\nin terms of one value unacceptable compared with the benefit in terms of\nanother value that he has so far favored.\nThe attentive reader will not have failed to notice that the devices I have\nmentioned here, which are just a sample of the moves a rhetor might\nemploy, are all central resources in the traditional discipline of rhetoric. The\njustification of all these devices, and of rhetoric as such, is that they are all\nwe have in situations where no objective algorithm can determine our\nchoice, i.e., in deliberation.\nNo quantity of good arguments on one side is in itself sufficient to decide\nthe matter. Just as attempts at blank rebuttal of counterarguments are often\nnot appropriate, because the counterarguments are in fact perfectly good, so\nalso does a debater not sufficiently honor his dialectical obligation merely\nby marshaling all the good arguments speaking for his own policy. A\ncomparison of the arguments on the two sides is still called for, and if this is\nnot offered, the third parties have still not been helped in making their own\ncomparisons. Failing an objective, algorithmic procedure for the\ncommensuration of incommensurable pros and cons, a special act of\nincommensurability-transcending comparison remains necessary,\nemploying, e.g., strategies based on specifics or parallels, as described\nabove.\nLooking back, one might skeptically ask what purpose is actually served\nby political debate, even when dialectical obligations like those discussed\nabove are respected. Since debaters cannot be expected to reach consensus,\nand since audience members cannot expect sufficient grounds to be offered\nfor any one policy but will still have to choose subjectively, might public\npolitical debate not be dispensed with altogether? My answer is of course\nnegative. While public political debate as brought to us by the media is\noften at its worst, a kind of debate that would respect the dialectical\nobligations as sketched in this paper might indeed help deliberative\ndemocracy become just that: a democracy that not just votes but deliberates,\ni.e., considers contradictory arguments and tries to weigh them against each\nother, as in a libra, a pair of scales. Although the decision that the\nindividual makes about deliberative issues will be subjective, it can still be\na reasoned decision; just because no objective balancing of contradictory\narguments is possible, we should not conclude that individuals facing\npolitical decisions are left with mere gut feeling to help them decide, or\n203 Dialectical Obligations in Political Debate\nrather, simply plump for one or the other policy. Public reasoning by\ndebaters in front of decision-makers about the decisions they face is still\npossible and can be helpful. True, individuals\u2019 decisions will be subjective,\nbut the subjectivity comes in because the warrants relied on in deliberative\nreasoning are values, and because individuals\u2019 sets of values, their\ninterpretations of them, and their hierarchical rankings of them are not\nidentical. Nevertheless, it is a need for every individual facing a decision to\ngain understanding of what is implied by competing proposals and policies\nin terms of that individual\u2019s values\u2014such as they are, or such as they may\ndynamically evolve as a result of the reasoning offered. Public debate in\nrespect of obligations like those discussed above would promote that kind\nof understanding.\nREFERENCES\nBenhabib, S. 1994.

This\nfunctional understanding underlies a view of what \u201cvirtuous\u201d political\nargumentation might be like, which again implies the proposed typology of\nvices. It integrates, revises and extends concepts from, primarily, informal\nlogic, such as the triad of acceptability, relevance, and sufficiency, and the\nnotion of dialectical obligations. I further draw on insights from several\npractical philosophers and political theorists.\nMy typology, I suggest, could be a useful tool not only for academic\nobservers of political debate but also for political reporters and\ncommentators and journalists acting as interviewers or moderators in\ndebates; with it, they might better identify and respond to the argumentative\nvices they meet. Moreover, I propose the theory, the set of norms, and the\ntypology as a bid for something that civic instruction might profitably try to\n* Originally published in Virtues of Argumentation.

Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\nteach students at all levels about deliberative democracy\u2014or, with a term I\nprefer, \u201crhetorical citizenship\u201d (Kock and Villadsen, 2012).\nWhat Citizens Need\nI believe we should assess the virtues of political argumentation from the\npoint of view of citizens. In contrast, political commentators and pundits\ntend to primarily estimate or second-guess how politicians\u2019 pronouncements\nand debate behavior will benefit politicians themselves. They speculate on\ntheir underlying strategy and on which voter segments or political factions\nwill respond favorably. This strategic framing (Cappella and Jamieson,\n1997) represents a prevailing, while often implicit, view that politicians are\nmotivated, mainly or exclusively, by a desire to strengthen or consolidate\ntheir positions of power. According to the strategic framing politicians try\nto do this by pleasing other politicians and mainly by pleasing the voters, or\ncertain segments of voters. To counterbalance this trend I suggest that we\nargumentation scholars should come forward in the public sphere and assess\nto what extent politicians\u2019 contributions to the debate are of any use to us\ncitizens.\nWe need norms on the basis of which this can be done. So what must\npolitical debates and debaters deliver in order to meet citizens\u2019 needs? My\nstarting point is that political debate should function as citizens\u2019 basis for\nmaking choices. It should help each of us estimate what problems we face,\nwhat ought to be done about them, and who has the best approach to them.\nDebates should help each one of us take a stand on what should be done\u2014\nbefore it is done. In short, public debate should be deliberative to help us\ncitizens deliberate.\nThe political theorist Robert Goodin has referred to this stand-taking by\ncitizens as \u201cdeliberation within\u201d (2000). Simone Chambers, another\npolitical theorist, similarly believes that deliberation is central to\ndemocracy, but we should realize that \u201cthe mass public can never be\ndeliberative\u201d in the active sense of the word, i.e., we shall never see all the\nmembers of the mass public engage in deliberative debate with each other.\nHowever, the public rhetoric we hear, mainly through the media, does have\na potential for providing deliberation to serve deliberating citizens\u2019 needs\u2014\nbut only a potential. Most public rhetoric is what Chambers calls\n\u201cplebiscitary,\u201d based on pandering and manipulation. So scholars should\ncritically assess public rhetoric, and the media that provides it, in hopes of\n\u201cmaking the mass public more rather than less deliberative.\u201d She says: \u201cIf\n209 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\nrhetoric in general is the study of how speech affects an audience then\ndeliberative rhetoric must be about the way speech induces deliberation in\nthe sense of inducing considered reflection about a future action\u201d (2009, p.\n335).\nI agree with Goodin and Chambers that we need public political debate\nthat is deliberative, not plebiscitary, mainly in order that we citizens may be\noptimally prepared for \u201cdeliberation within.\u201d This is the basic normative\nconsideration on which I build a categorization of argumentative virtues and\nvices. The proposal aims to be simple and useful, for example in teaching\ncitizenship and for journalists who want to contribute to the quality of\ndeliberation in the media.\nThe cardinal virtues, in brief, are these: First, debaters who seek our\nadherence should do so by explicitly offering arguments, rather than trying\nto gain it with strategies that bypass arguments. Second, the arguments\noffered should themselves have merit, judged by criteria to which I will\nreturn. Third, debaters should provide answers to counterarguments and\ncriticisms from opponents or questioners.\nThe typology of argumentative vices I propose is a mirror image of this\ntriad. The first major category of vices comprises strategies by which our\nadherence to policies is sought without any arguments being given. In the\nsecond category, reasons are offered, but they are deficient or useless from\na citizen\u2019s point of view. The third category comprises ways in which\nresponses to criticism or counterarguments may be lacking or deficient.\nVices, Type I: No Arguments\nFirst, a look at some strategies by which politicians try to win voters\u2019\nadherence to policies without providing argumentation. In my critical work\nwith political debate, most explicitly in my book in Danish for a general\naudience De svarer ikke (\u201cThey Are Not Answering,\u201d 2013) I discuss four\nrelated ways of presenting debatable ideas for the hearer\u2019s acceptance\nwithout making it explicit that this is what one is doing, i.e., without\nasserting these ideas or arguing for them. Because the ideas have not been\nasserted, chances are that hearers will accept them unreflectingly and\nwithout asking for arguments.\nThe range of linguistic features that can work like this includes such\nphenomena as Orwellian \u201cNewspeak,\u201d i.e., words and expressions\n\u201cintended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using\nthem,\u201d as Orwell explains (1949); also, second, \u201cframing\u201d language as\n210 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\ndiscussed by, among others, George Lakoff (1996, 2004), for example the\nterm death tax for estate tax; third, illicit use of presuppositions (Harder and\nKock, 1976). This refers to assumptions tied to words and expressions\nwhich are taken for granted even if the sentence in which they occur is\nnegated or turned into a question. In the standard case, such assumptions\nshould be shared by the speaker and the hearer; the illicit use of them occurs\nwhen a speaker introduces presuppositions not shared by the hearers in\norder to get the hearer\u2019s unreflecting acceptance of them.\nI will discuss a fourth phenomenon: implicatures\u2014ideas that hearers\nunderstand and derive from an utterance, often involuntarily, although they\nare not asserted in it. Linguists, following Grice (1975), tend to distinguish\nbetween two types: conventional implicatures, which attach to a statement\nwhenever it is uttered, regardless of context; and conversational\nimplicatures; which hearers derive from a statement as a function of its\nspecific context. Perelman and others have reminded us that what we call\nstyle is an integral part of argumentation. One of the merits of Jeanne\nFahnestock\u2019s Rhetorical Style (2011) is to have shown this in detail. For\nexample, in her chapter about \u201cinterclausal relations\u201d she demonstrates how\nrhetors can call on readers\u2019 or hearers\u2019 discourse knowledge, a knowledge\nof the kinds of meaning relations that can exist between clauses (p. 356).\nThis triggers a process in which listeners\u2019 minds are basically made to act\ninvoluntarily, constructing possible links between the parts of an utterance.\nConsider this passage from George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\nspeech on January 28, 2003.\nBefore September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam\nHussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and\nshadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained.\nIn the first sentence, why is it relevant to say, in the past tense, that many\nbelieved Saddam could be contained? The most obvious reason would be\nthat now people no more believe this. That may also provide relevance to\nthe phrase Before September the 11th. Ostensibly, that day people gave up\ntheir former belief\u2014for if they had kept it even after September 11, it\nwould be irrelevant to specify the date. But if precisely that date refuted the\nbelief that we can contain Saddam, then the most obvious reason for that\nwould be that Saddam was partly or fully responsible for what happened\nthat day. (There might be other reasons, and Bush did have another, much\nmore convoluted reason in mind, but this is certainly the most obvious one.)\n211 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\nNext consider both sentences together. Now more implicatures may\narise, most obviously that Saddam had chemical agents, lethal viruses and\nshadowy terrorist networks, and that these were involved in 9/11. Otherwise\nthe second sentence would be irrelevant to the first.\nMany similar examples from the Bush administration\u2019s rhetoric on Iraq\ncould be cited. The point is that the use of implicatures is one of a range of\ndevices by which politicians may transfer debatable beliefs to citizens\nwithout explicitly giving arguments.\nVices, Type II: Deficient Arguments\nNow for the second main category of argumentative vices. If arguments\nare in fact given, what criteria may we apply to them? Taking the reverse\nview, what can be wrong with them?\nI start with the observation that there are usually \u201cgood\u201d arguments both\nfor and against a particular policy.\nFrom this it follows that a good argument is not the same thing that\nlogicians call a \u201cvalid argument\u201d; we need to say this because many\ntextbooks still cling to \u201cvalidity.\u201d In standard logic \u201cvalid\u201d means that the\ntruth of the conclusion necessarily follows from the truth of the arguments\n(premises). When this is so, we speak of \u201cdeductive reasoning,\u201d\n\u201centailment,\u201d or \u201cdemonstration.\u201d But to Cha\u00efm Perelman (Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca, 1958), argumentation is reasoning where demonstration\nis precisely not attainable; and argumentation thus defined is \u201cthe realm of\nrhetoric.\u201d Similarly, it is arguably the defining feature of informal logic that\nit looks at how argumentation can be reasonable without being deductively\nvalid.\nIs the validity criterion any use to us, then? Yes, it is of some use,\nbecause we often hear debaters pretend, explicitly or implicitly, that their\narguments for a proposal entails an adoption of that proposal. And such\nfalse pretenses should be exposed. In politics the logical yardstick of\ndeductive validity has this, rather limited, purpose. Where policies and\ndecisions are concerned, we are dealing with what many philosophers,\ninspired by Aristotle, call practical reasoning; here I claim that there are\nnever, in principle, any deductive entailment from the arguments for a\nproposal to the adoption of it. Although there are good arguments for it,\nthere are, as a rule, also good arguments against it. As the philosopher\nAnthony Kenny has it, \u201cif a project or proposal or decision is good, that\ndoes not exclude its being also, from another point of view, bad\u201d (1979, p.\n212 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\n146). Hence we cannot blame debaters for not presenting arguments which\nentail their proposal; we can, however, blame them if they will make us\nbelieve that they do.\nAdd to this that for any problem one would like to do something about,\nthere are often several alternative policies. Even if one of them is good,\nanother might be better.\nAll in all, assessing argument merit is much more complicated in\npolitics, and in practical reasoning generally, than in logic. This is so not\njust in practice, but also in theory. So how can we go about it?\nBuilding on the work of informal logicians such as Johnson and Blair\n(2006), Blair (2012), Johnson (2000), and Govier (1987, 2009), I would\nposit the following three dimensions of argument appraisal in practical\nreasoning. Arguments should be:\n1. Accurate\n2. Relevant\n3. Weighty\nAccurate means that one can answer \u201cYes\u201d to the question, \u201cIs that so?\u201d\nI prefer the term \u201caccurate\u201d to the informal logicians\u2019 preferred term\n\u201cacceptable\u201d because \u201caccurate\u201d refers more to the relation between\nstatements and reality, whereas \u201cacceptable\u201d refers more to the relation\nbetween statements and hearers. This is the ground covered by fact-\nchecking organizations like the websites Factcheck.org or Politifact.com.\nPolitical debate is replete with alleged facts and statistics that should not go\nunchecked.\nIt is important that outright falsity is not the only vice here. Accountants\nand lawyers use the expression \u201ctrue and fair.\u201d This means that alleged facts\nand numbers provide a good and trustworthy account of how things really\nare\u2014not just that the numbers, taken in isolation, are \u201ctrue,\u201d but that we get\na full picture.\nFurther, terms used in such information must, as Jamieson and Waldman\n(2002) have discussed, have a clear definition\u2014and one that tallies with\nhow the same terms are used by other debaters and understood by the\npublic. But loose and idiosyncratic use of terms is one major vice in\npolitical debate; I suggest calling it the vice of \u201cfuzzy facts.\u201d\nAnother major vice, one degree worse, is what we may call \u201cfudging\nfacts\u201d: \u201cfactual\u201d information which is not downright false but which invites\n213 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\nus to believe falsehoods. We have just seen how deftly worded\ncommunication can invite people to believe things that aren\u2019t so.\nThe rampant use of fuzzy and fudging facts makes public debate near\nuseless for citizens. That is why Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said:\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to their own views, but not to their own facts.\u201d\nRelevant. Relevance concerns the relation between arguments and their\nwarrants, whether these be explicit or implicit, as they often are. Problems\narise in two kinds of situations: when an argument is not in fact covered or\nsubsumed by the warrant it depends on, and when the warrant it depends on\nis one that the hearers cannot endorse. The warrants appealed to in practical\nargumentation will often be value concepts and ideological positions\nendorsed by the debater, but not by his opponents or hearers. Warrants are\noften differentially recognized by different individuals. It is a fact that the\nFalkland Islanders have voted overwhelmingly for staying British, but\nArgentina does not recognize popular majority as a warrant and instead\nbases her claim for the islands on a territorial warrant\u2014which in turn is not\nrecognized by Britain. This example makes it clear that relevance appraisal\nin argumentation, more than the assessment of factual accuracy, allows for\na certain amount of disagreement, even deep disagreement, and if you\nprefer, subjectivity.\nThe insight that underlying values are sometimes not shared should also\ntell us that if we want to influence our opponents\u2019 views, we should search\nfor values on even deeper levels that we do share with them. The principle\nthat there has to be this sort of common ground is central to Perelman\u2019s\nconcept of argumentation. In principle, we should expect debaters on public\nissues to base their case on warrants that are shared by every member of the\npublic. And a corresponding vice is to base one\u2019s case on values and other\nwarrants that are only shared by a narrowly targeted faction. We should\nexpect public argumentation that does not simply pander to the pre-existing\npolicy preferences of selected segments, but which tries to change some\npeople\u2019s policy preferences by appealing to underlying shared warrants.\nAlso, whether an argument is covered by a warrant is often a matter of\ninterpretation. Everyone agrees that killing innocent human beings is\nwrong, but does this notion cover abortion? We need debates in which\ndebaters recognize that their disagreement with opponents is not necessarily\na disagreement over deeply held values, but a difference in the\ninterpretation of these values (Warnke, 1999).\n214 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\nComing back to what we actually get, a rampant relevance-related vice\nthat is objectively and unconditionally vicious is argumentation directed at\n\u201cstraw men,\u201d i.e., distorted versions of opponents\u2019 standpoints or of their\narguments (these are two different things). A straw man version of an\nopponent\u2019s standpoint tends to radicalize and transmogrify it into a\ncaricature that is easy to reject; we may call it a \u201cdetestable straw man.\u201d\nWhile a \u201cstraw\u201d version of one\u2019s opponent\u2019s standpoint may well be\ndetestable, however, there is no warrant for concluding from this that one\u2019s\nopponent\u2019s real standpoint is detestable too. As for straw versions of an\nopponent\u2019s arguments, these are routinely weakened and emasculated into\nsomething we might call \u201cpitiable straw men.\u201d\nAnother subtype of relevance-related vice which is perhaps not quite so\nobjectively and unconditionally wrong is the ascription of sinister ulterior\nmotives to opponents. The possible presence of such motives has at most\nmarginal relevance, or none at all. There are accuracy problems as well\u2014\nhow can we know whether an opponent really has the hidden motives\nascribed to him if they are hidden? Even if it shown that some of those who\nadvance a proposal do have hidden motives, should the proposal not be\njudged on what it actually does, rather than what someone intended it to do?\nEven if an argument is clearly relevant, and factually accurate too, our\nargument appraisal is not done. Since the warrants for arguments in political\ndebate are typically value concepts, we come to a further fundamental\ncomplication. As we have seen, a policy might be good according to one\nrelevant value, for example that one should keep one\u2019s promises; but it\nmight be bad according to another relevant warrant, for example economic\nprudence. A government may have made pre-election promises to\nimplement certain policies\u2014but doing so turns out to be disastrously\nexpensive. Many citizens in such a case would probably feel that both these\nwarrants have some relevance, so the task for citizens engaged in\n\u201cdeliberation within\u201d would be to prioritize. That would be each citizen\u2019s\npersonal responsibility, since there is no pre-ordained or intersubjective\nway to determine whether the ethics of promises or economic prudence has\nmore weight in a particular case.\nThis shows that relevant warrants in practical argumentation are\ntypically multiple (Kock, 2006), and that they can easily be in conflict\n(Stocker, 1990), and that they are not commensurable (Raz, 1998) in any\nagreed and pre-ordained way.\nAs you may have noticed, the weight criterion just popped up here. In\nchoosing the term \u201cweight\u201d I deviate from the term most frequently used by\n215 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\ninformal logicians such as Anthony Blair: \u201csufficiency.\u201d The problem is\nthat sufficiency is dichotomous. A quantity is either sufficient for some\npurpose, or it isn\u2019t; it cannot be \u201crather sufficient.\u201d Do I have sufficient time\nto catch my plane? I cannot catch my plane to some extent. Also,\nsufficiency is known in mathematics in phrases like \u201cthe necessary and\nsufficient condition.\u201d A condition is sufficient for something to be the case\nif that something necessarily follows; that is, deductive inference obtains.\nInformal logicians rightly want to abandon deductive inference as a\nnecessary criterion of good argumentation; but if they include \u201csufficiency\u201d\nin their criteria, that either means that deductive inference is still required\u2014\nor it has some other meaning which is fuzzy and idiosyncratic.\nFurthermore, the weight of an argument is of a peculiar, metaphorical\nkind because one cannot assess it for one argument taken by itself; one has\nto look at it in relation to the other good arguments on the same issue\u2014and\nthere are usually several on both sides. So weight means relative weight. All\nthe arguments on both sides are in play when we want to \u201cweigh\u201d an\nargument.\nThis metaphorical weighing of arguments against each other will be\nadditionally complicated by the presence of the elements of individuality or\nsubjectivity. As I have shown, these complications arise in regard to the\nrecognition and the interpretation of warrants, and they arise even more\nwhen arguments are to be prioritized or \u201cweighed.\u201d\nThis is because, for one thing, arguments belong to different dimensions.\nShould the economic argument that cutbacks are (perhaps) prudent trump\nthe moral argument that promises to the contrary were made? There is no\nobjective or \u201cphilosophical\u201d answer, so citizens must try to decide for\nthemselves. But before they do, they need all the help they can get, and this\nkind of help they should expect from public debaters\u2014as well as from\njournalists, pundits and academics in the public sphere. They need to hear\nthe good arguments on both sides, and to be able to weigh them against\neach other they especially need debaters on each side to hear and answer\narguments from the other side.\nVices, Type III: No Answers\nThis brings us to our last category of vices. Flouting the \u201cdialectical\nobligation\u201d (Johnson, 1996, 2000, 2002; Kock, 2007) to sincerely hear and\nanswer counterarguments or critical questions is perhaps the chief vice that\nmakes public debate near useless for citizens. There is reason to believe that\n216 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\na great deal of what communication consultants do for the politicians they\nserve is teach them how to respond in ways that superficially appear to\nanswer counterarguments and critical questions, but which in reality bypass\nthem. Not every response is an answer. The obligation to answer can in\nprinciple only be satisfied in two ways:\nEither one tries to show why the counterargument is deficient\u2014 i.e.,\nthat it is either inaccurate or irrelevant, or both.\nOr if the counterargument happens to fulfil the accuracy and\nrelevance conditions, as it often does, then one explains why one still\nsees the arguments for one\u2019s own position as weightier than the\narguments against it.\nThese two kinds of behavior are rarely found in public debate. Instead\nwe get responses in which counterarguments are either bypassed in silence,\ndistorted into pitiable straw men, or blankly dismissed, i.e., without any\nreasons being offered for the dismissal. These vices are often camouflaged\nwith repetitions of stale talking points, or talk about other subjects,\nincluding straw man versions of opponents\u2019 views and condemnation of\ntheir alleged hidden motives.\nIt is the discussion of arguments pro and con, as in 1) and 2), that\nconstitutes true deliberation. That is the kind of input that will most help\ncitizens and voters engage in \u201cdeliberation within.\u201d It will help them muster\nthe available arguments on both sides, what the issue involves, what\narguments pertain to it, which arguments are accurate and relevant, and\nwhat the other party has to say in answer to them.\nThat kind of deliberation will not result in universal consensus; there are\nreasons why we have such a thing as \u201creasonable disagreement\u201d (Rawls,\n1989, 1993). Perhaps there will not even be many people who will change\ntheir views. Even if none of these things happen, it will probably still be the\ncase that a citizen who engages in \u201cdeliberation within\u201d will realize that\nother citizens who disagree with him in regard to their preferred policies\noften have reasons to do so which may make him wiser. He may understand\nthat their reasons may say something about reality that he has not yet\nthought about, but which may be accurate and relevant, and which may\neven have some weight. Such an insight does not entail that our citizen\nshould necessarily endorse his opponents\u2019 preferred policies. As we saw at\nfirst, that kind of entailment has no place in practical reasoning. This\nimplies that we should not be afraid to admit that our opponents may have\nsome points that we have not yet given enough thought. In other words,\n217 Virtue Reversed: Principal Argumentative Vices in Political Debate\neven though we may never agree on divisive issues, it might do us good to\nsit down and talk. It might even do our politicians good.\nREFERENCES\nBenoit, W.L. 1989. Attorney argumentation and Supreme Court opinions.\nArgumentation and Advocacy, 26, 22-38.\nBlair, J.A. 2012.

In a qualitative interpretation of the\nobservations, we suggest that debates such as these are likely to be won by\ndebaters whose argumentation is fair and thoughtful. Audiences may\nrespond differently depending on whether they are voters or merely\nviewers. The debate format may enhance such a response, for the benefit of\nthe democratic process.\nTwo important efforts in the study of persuasion are analyses of\nauthentic political communication and experimental effect studies. The first\nkind, as exemplified in the work of Kathleen Hall Jamieson (e.g., 1992;\nJamieson and Birdsell, 1988), has brought important insights but generally\nlacks data to link specific features and effects. On the other hand,\nexperimental studies developing the tradition of the Yale group (as in\nHovland et al., 1953) focus specifically on effects, isolating one variable at\na time and controlling for disturbing influences; however, this very\nmethodology makes it problematic to transfer results to the world of\nauthentic political communication, in which countless variables are\nconstantly at play. The empirical study of persuasion might benefit from\nobservations of persuasion taking place in authentic settings, but with built-\nin controls that make it possible to link causes and effects.\n* This article was co-authored with Charlotte J\u00f8rgensen and Lone R\u00f8rbech.

Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nOur study is based on videotaped events that meet this dual\nrequirement.12 Over the years 1975-1985, the Danish Broadcasting\nCorporation televised 37 one hour debates, titled Town Parliament\n(Bytinget). In each, two debaters took opposing sides on such issues as\n\u201cShould the electoral age be lowered to 18?\u201d and \u201cShould legal abortion be\nrestricted?\u201d Debaters were often prominent figures, noted for their interest\nin the issue. Each debater brought three \u201cwitnesses,\u201d interrogating each for\nfour minutes; the opponent would then cross-examine for three minutes.\nThe studio audience, a panel of a hundred \u201cjurors\u201d who served for three or\nfour debates, were a randomized sample of the citizens of Silkeborg, where\nthe debates were held\u2014then Denmark\u2019s political \u201cMiddletown,\u201d mirroring\nthe national party distribution in elections. Unlike most studio audiences,\nthese were reasonably representative of the electorate.\nTwo secret push-button polls were taken in each debate; the first after\nboth debaters had briefly presented their views and the other at the end,\nafter two minute concluding speeches by the debaters. Jurors had three\noptions: yes, no, and undecided.\nOf the 37 debates, we had at our disposal 30 on videotape and one on\naudio tape.13 For all debates, we knew the issues, the participants, and the\nnet polling results. For 20 of the available debates, we also knew the\ninternal movements between yes, no, and undecided.\nIn sum, the issues debated were real and important; debaters argued\nviews that they truly held because they wanted to persuade; the jurors were\na representative sample; what jurors voted on was not who \u201cdid best\u201d but by\nwhom they were persuaded; and finally, if votes were shifted between the\ntwo polls, this must have been caused by the debaters\u2019 and witnesses\u2019\npersuasive efforts because the audience was under no other influence.\n12 The study reported here was supported by the Danish Research Council for the Humanities\nand published in our Danish monograph Retorik der flytter stemmer: Hvordan man\noverbeviser i offentlig debat (\u201cRhetoric That Shifts Votes: How to Persuade in Public\nDebate\u201d; J\u00f8rgensen, Kock, and R\u00f8rbech, 1994). There, we present extensive analyses of data\nand examples of all features studied, as well as thorough discussions of our methodology and\nstatistical procedures. Many methodological questions that might be raised are discussed in\nthe book; they have necessarily been compressed here to give an international audience an\noutline of our study within article length. Our consultant on statistics was Knut Conradsen,\nProfessor of Mathematical Statistics and Operations Research at the Technological\nUniversity of Denmark.\n13 The earliest of these debates were held before videotape recorders became common. The\ndebates missing in this study do not exist in the archives of the Danish Broadcasting\nCorporation nor in any other collection of which we have inquired.\n221 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nHence, we believe the debates are important data for a study in persuasive\neffects.14\nMethod\nExploratory Nature of the Study. Given the exceptional value of these\ndebates as data, it was clear to us that our study would have to be\nexploratory and hence different from traditional experimental studies. We\ndid not approach the material with any one hypothesis to test. Naturally, we\nhad ideas concerning what to look for. But to exploit the material optimally,\nwe tried not to be guided by preformed hypotheses that might blindfold us\nto unexpected observations.\nFor all features studied, we tested for correlations with the voting results.\nWe emphasize that our tests and p values cannot be given a strict\nprobabilistic interpretation but instead are used in a descriptive way to\nindicate how well the data correspond to the persuasive effects for which\nwe were looking. We used one tailed tests only when a unidirectional\nhypothesis was obvious. If we had no a priori reason to hypothesize that a\npossible effect would be either negative or positive, we did two-tailed tests;\nthese cases are explicitly indicated.\n\u201cFeaturizing\u201d authentic persuasion was a complicated task. For example,\nin a forensic format with testimony and cross-examination, a debater\u2019s\nwitnesses act as co-debaters. Still, the debater is the team leader. Certain\nfeatures are ascribable to debaters, others concern witnesses, and others\nagain concern the performance of the whole team. However, the audience\ndoes not vote for the witnesses or the teams but for the debaters\u2019 claims;\nhence, for statistical tests we attributed all features to the debaters.\nDebaters and witnesses, facing a real audience, employ a wide range of\nconstantly intermingling appeals. We wanted to study the full range of\nappeals, from actio over inventio to overall strategy. Yet there are\nundoubtedly many patterns we have overlooked. On the other hand, many\nfeatures that we considered including in the study were left out, either\nbecause they turned out to be practically absent or because they could not\nbe coded with any degree of precision. Such difficulties are inherent to\nauthentic communication. What we explore is not the effect of single\n14 A study such as ours only offers insight into short-term persuasive effects and yields no\ndata on what long-term effects would be. Also, because all the debates took place between\n1975 and 1985, it is possible that the effects we hypothesize may not be valid now.\n222 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nfeatures in contexts where all others are held constant but features recurring\nacross many debates in interaction with countless others; this creates\ncomplexities but also a realism hard to achieve in experimental studies.\nCoding. Conveniently, our criterion variable\u2014the persuasiveness of the\ndebaters\u2014had been quantitatively coded by the 100 jurors. For the coding\nof the independent variables, we relied on our own judgment.15 When in\ndoubt, we reached consensus on the coding after extensive discussion\namong the three of us.\nWe used dichotomous coding, not gradation, for two reasons: First, there\nwould have been additional reliability problems in applying graded coding\nof, for example, \u201cintense gaze\u201d; second, quantification of a feature (as in\ncontent analysis) would assume that the effect of a feature is proportional to\nthe degree of its presence. However, even one use of a highly aggressive\ngesture by a debater may have an immense effect on the audience,\nrendering strict quantification pointless. For some features, however, we did\nuse relative quantification, estimating which of two debaters had more of\nthe feature in question.\nCases in which dichotomous coding remained problematic were coded\nas undecidable. We did not use subjective features such as high versus low\ncredibility.\nStatistical Tests. For each feature, we identified all debaters who had it\nand tested their success in terms of winning votes. A debater might be in the\nminority in both polls yet be more successful than his opponent by gaining\nmore votes. We looked at net gain, not proportional gain (i.e., the debater\u2019s\nnet gain in proportion to his initial number of votes); a minority debater\ngaining 10 votes is hardly more successful than a majority debater who does\nthe same. In parliamentary elections, the winner is considered to be the\nparty, large or small, making the largest net gain. Our data confirm this\ninterpretation: debaters who are in the minority in the first poll gain more\n15 Charlotte J\u00f8rgensen worked on audience response, hostility, nonsupportive testimony, and\ntypes of grounds. Christian Kock worked on demographic features, ideology, rhetorical\nstrategy, and claim demarcation. Lone R\u00f8rbech worked on nonverbal features, stylistic\nfeatures, and the last word strategy.\nAn obvious question is how we dealt with possible \u201csuccess\u201d biases. Because we knew\nthe outcome of the votes in advance, we might have been inclined to find justification for\nthis outcome in the coding. Extended discussion of doubtful cases among the three of us\ncannot completely eliminate this problem, but the temptation to bias would have been\nstronger if we had had any specific hypotheses to prove. As we did not, we had no a priori\nwish to code any given debater in any particular way for any feature.\n223 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nvotes in exactly as many cases as do majority debaters. Thus, to win was to\ngain more votes than the opponent; a tie was when the opposing debaters\nmade equal gains.\nTied debates, and debates in which both debaters, or none, have a\nparticular feature (F), cannot in themselves show anything about the effect\nof F. When these are discounted, we have a set of debaters with F\nconfronting debaters without F. The winner-loser distribution among F-\ndebaters allows us to do a binomial test. For brevity, we shall say, for\ninstance, \u201cF-debaters won 10 times and lost once;\u201d this should be\nunderstood to refer to the 11 debates that were not tied and in which F-\ndebaters confronted non-F-debaters.\nThe binomial test, using nominal data only and excluding many debates,\ndoes not fully exploit the data; it would be desirable to include all debates in\nwhich a feature appears and to define degrees of success. But we cannot\nsimply compare all debaters\u2019 net gains because some debaters, presumably,\nhave stronger opponents than others; however, this problem is reduced for\ngroups of debaters. Also, it may be harder to gain votes on some issues than\non others. In fact, it turned out that debaters\u2019 average gains were roughly\nproportional to the number of undecided voters in the first poll, both in\ndebates with many undecided votes, in debates with an average number\n(about 10), and in debates with few undecided votes. Hence, we postulated\nthat the jurors\u2019 volatility in a given debate is proportional to the number of\nundecided votes in the first poll. (The number of undecided votes does not,\nwe believe, reflect any other factor, such as jurors\u2019 view of the salience of\nan issue\u2014a factor that usually affects the turnout in referendums and the\nlike. In these debates, the jurors already had turned out.) Thus, if there are\nn undecided voters in the first poll, and if a debater\u2019s net gain is G , then\n1 N\nthe formula G N:n yields comparable \u201csuccess factors\u201d for all debaters.\n1\nNotice that in this definition, two opponents\u2019 success factors are not mere\nreciprocal figures.\nThe success factors were not normally distributed (there were several\nextreme values). Therefore, we chose a nonparametric statistic: we\nconverted success factors into a rank order and applied the Mann-Whitney\nU test.\nOne problem remained: we could not lump together all debaters. That\nwould have placed the winner and the loser of a given debate in the same\nrank order, resulting in Type I errors. Instead, we used one rank order for\n\u201cA\u201d debaters (those who spoke first in each debate) and one for \u201cB\u201d\ndebaters (those who spoke last). The risk now is Type II error: to obtain\n224 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nsignificant results in both these half-sized groups is a stiff requirement.\nThus, the rank order test and the binomial test have complementary\nadvantages. Also, because they are quite different, we assumed that\nwhenever they confirmed each other, our results would be bolstered.\nBecause data on some features (e.g., debaters\u2019 age) were available\noutside the debates, the rank order for these features includes all 37 debates.\nMost features (e.g., types of evidence) could be studied only in the debates;\nhence, the rank order for these features is based on 31 debates. Other\nfeatures (e.g., gestures) could only be studied on video-tapes; here, only 30\ndebates were included.\nSome features make a third statistic meaningful. When there were two\nextremes on a scale, with an undecidable in the middle (e.g., the feature\nvoice, which may be modulated, monotonous, or undecidable), we used\n\u201cwinner versus loser\u201d as the independent variable and the three-point scale\nas a rank-ordered criterion variable. This, unlike a Chi-square test, allowed\nus to capture a skew toward, for example, more modulated voice in\nwinners.\nResults\nDemographic Features. Does persuasive effect correlate with\nprofessional status? This feature was elusive because debaters tended to\nhave multiple or borderline professional identities, such as\npolitician/lawyer/businessman. The only profession category that we found\noperational was \u201cmember of Parliament\u201d (MP; past or present). It is perhaps\nsurprising that MPs (41 out of 74 debaters) did not excel in persuasion: their\naverage rank was 18.8 against a total average of 19.\nWhat about educational background? In Denmark, the word academic\nmeans a person with a full university degree (Master's or above). Academic\ndebaters won 10 times and lost twice (p = .0193). The rank order test\nyielded p = .13 for the A group and p < .01 for the B group. The reason\nacademic debaters won, we assume, is that they had special skills in\nsupporting a case. \u201cInitial ethos\u201d (McCroskey, 1997, pp. 91-95) cannot\nexplain their success: in most cases no information on debaters\u2019 educational\nbackground was given and there generally seemed to be no way for the\naudience to make inferences about it; we ourselves had to research\nextensively to find out.\nAs for non-university backgrounds, one might expect journalists and\nschoolteachers to show persuasive skills. However, both groups were too\n225 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nsmall for statistical testing, they both ranked well below average\n(journalists, 12.4 against 19; schoolteachers, 13.3).\nThe hypothesis that academics have special persuasive skills\ncorresponds with observations on witness roles. Debaters bringing\nprofessional researchers as witnesses (academics in the American sense)\nwon nine times and lost twice (p = .0327). In the rank order test, the result\nfor the A group was nonsignificant; for the B group, p = .06.\nAnother witness role is the professional expert, for example, a general\ntestifying on a military issue. We also found witnesses without professional\nexpertise on the issue but with special personal experience that was used by\nthe debater to exemplify the issue (we return to these below under the\nheading Types of Grounds).\nThe residual group of witnesses was typically used to express the views\nof ordinary people. Debaters using such witnesses won three times but lost\neight times (p = .2266, two-tailed); the rank order test went in the same\ndirection but was of course nonsignificant.\nAs for gender, women ranked slightly below men. In male-female\nconfrontations, the men won eight times, the women twice (p = .1094, two-\ntailed). Results in the rank order test were nonsignificant.\nWe also looked at cases in which all-male debate teams confronted\nmixed teams; this is relevant because there was only one all-female team,\nwhereas 34 teams\u2014nearly half of all teams\u2014were all-male. All-male teams\nwon 12 times and lost five times (p = .1434, two-tailed). The rank order test\nhad a p of .05 for the A group, whereas p for the B group was\nnonsignificant.\nProbably, however, these results are best explained in terms of\neducation. Only seven (44%) of the female debaters held university degrees\nbut those did well above average (21.1). There was a positive correlation\nbetween men and academics (\u03c72 = 1.89, p = .17, two-tailed). That mixed\nteams lost to all-male teams may stem from the fact that female witnesses\nalways (with one exception) appeared as \u201cordinary people.\u201d\nAge. Age as such had little correlation with rank (Pearson\u2019s r = .18 for\nthe A group, .13 for the B group). We also grouped debaters in age intervals\nof five years, with about the same number of debaters in each. Here, for\nexample, the middle-aged (46-50) lost 12 times and won twice (p = .0130,\ntwo-tailed), whereas the old (those over 55) won nine times and lost three\ntimes (p = .1460, two-tailed). Again, these results probably have to do with\n226 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\neducation as only 26.7 percent of the middle aged were academics, against\n85.7 percent of the old.\nOverall, the only demographic feature correlating plausibly with\npersuasiveness was a university degree. This suggestive fact foreshadows\nthe general picture that emerges from our analysis.\nNonverbal Features. Several significant winning or losing features\nrelated to nonverbal aspects. We identified four categories: voice, facial\nexpressions, posture, gestures.\nVoice. One would expect debaters speaking in a monotonous voice to do\nless well than debaters with a modulated voice, that is, a voice with a broad\nrange of variation in pitch, speed, or volume. (An intermediate group was\ncoded as undecidable.) Indeed, modulated debaters won 9 times and lost 3\ntimes (p = .0730); monotonous debaters lost 10 times and won once (p =\n.0059). In the A group, modulated debaters ranked only slightly above\naverage, but monotonous ones ranked significantly lower (p < .01); in the B\ngroup, modulated debaters ranked higher (p = .11), and monotonous ones\nranked lower to a similar degree. In a rank order test on degree of\nmodulation, winners were significantly more modulated than losers (p <\n.01).\nArticulation is another classic feature of effective delivery. On a three-\npoint scale (energetic, undecidable, and sloppy articulation), energetic\ndebaters won 12 times and lost five times (p = .0717); sloppy debaters lost\neight times and won twice (p = .0547). The rank order test yielded no\nsignificant results, but a test on degrees of articulation showed that winners\nranked significantly higher than losers (p = .03).\nFacial Expressions. The feature friendliness versus unfriendliness\nyielded nonsignificant results, though with some skew toward friendliness.\nWe noticed another feature, though: a noticeably intense gaze fixed on the\nwitnesses or the audience at appropriate moments. Debaters with an intense\ngaze won 11 times and lost no debates (p = .0005). The rank order test\nyielded qualified support to this finding (A group, p = .11; B group, p <\n.01).\nPosture. We identified three recurrent features. The open posture is one\nin which the speaker generally holds his or her arms in an open position,\naway from the body, and the chest open and upright; in the closed posture,\nspeakers tend to crouch and cover their chest with their arms. (There also\nwas an intermediate undecidable class.) Debaters with an open posture did\nmarginally better than average, and debaters with a closed posture did\n227 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nslightly worse, but a rank order test showed that winners were significantly\nmore open than losers (p = .03).\nA combination of closed posture and unfriendly facial expression struck\nus as a recurrent syndrome; we call it the dismissive attitude. Six debaters\nhad it: Five lost, one won (p = .1094). All were in the B group; a rank order\ntest suggested that the dismissive attitude is, indeed, for debaters opposing a\nproposition, a losing feature (p = .04).\nLike energy in articulation, we hypothesized that an energetic posture\nmight also be a winning feature. We noted a tendency in some debaters to\nsit alertly on the edge of their chairs with sustained muscle tension, as if\nready to pounce. Eleven debaters with this posture won, and one lost (p =\n.0032). Rank order test results were as follows: for A debaters, p = .09; for\nB debaters, p = .02.\nGesticulation. Again, we found three recurrent patterns. Some debaters\ngesticulated eagerly, others hardly at all, with an undecidable group in\nbetween. Eager debaters won 12 times and lost twice (p = .0193); on the\nrank order test, they were average in the A group but significantly better in\nthe B group (p = .05). However, debaters who hardly gesticulated were not\nlosers: they won nine times and lost 11 times; on the rank order test, they\nwere slightly above average in the A group but were significantly below\naverage in the B group (p = .04).\nAnother pattern was open, embracing gestures. Debaters with this\nfeature won eight times and lost twice (p = .0547). On the rank order test,\nthe p for the A group was nonsignificant; for the B group, p = .05.\nFirm, directive gestures were typically fist, edge-of-hand, or index finger\nmovements, performed energetically and selectively to underscore key\npoints. Debaters with this feature won 13 times and lost twice (p = .0037).\nOn the rank order test, the p for the A group was .05; for the B group, p <\n.01.\nA look at the whole range of nonverbal features suggests that while\nenergy and liveliness are certainly important, the most persuasive nonverbal\nfeatures are those that are used in a selective, precise, and directive way to\nemphasize specific, crucial features of content. We do not believe that any\nstandardized nonverbal feature will guarantee success. Persuasiveness\ncannot be assured by adding a few effects extraneous to the nature of one\u2019s\narguments, strategy, or general ethos. For instance, firm, directive gestures\ncomprise an indefinite number of different movements; the indiscriminate\nuse of any one gesture would appear robotic. More generally, we believe\n228 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nthat when nonverbal features are persuasive, it is because they are\nintegrated with spoken words to highlight and structure ideas also presented\nverbally.\nStylistic Features. Testing the persuasive effects of linguistic and\nstylistic features would be a time consuming project, which we gave low\npriority because probes suggested that such features per se have little\npersuasive effect. Debaters using rhetorical figures in their concluding\nspeeches did only averagely. Results might have been different if we had\nbeen able to test for apt use. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969)\ndistinguish between figures used argumentatively and as embellishment, but\nwe lacked an operational way to apply this distinction.\nA few debaters used what we might call \u201cnutshells\u201d (Flower, 1985).\nThese are repeated and pointed one-word or one-line formulations that sum\nup the main reason for their stand. An example is \u201cBabies will become\nmerchandise,\u201d used in support of a ban on surrogate motherhood. Debaters\nwith this feature were all large winners.\nA related observation concerns debaters whose concluding speeches\nused what we call rhythmical pith. These debaters ranked high and won\nseven times, while losing three times. This feature resembles another aspect\nof verbal pith: A small group of debaters had an unusually low average T-\nunit length (10-12.5 words per T-unit) in their concluding speeches (a T-\nunit is an independent clause and all subordinate elements attached to it,\nwhether clausal or phrasal, cf. Hunt, 1965). These debaters seemed to us to\nproject energy and precision and were in fact large winners.\nApart from this, both general T-unit length and percentage of long\nwords, as used in readability tests, were persuasively neutral. We believe\nthat energy and purposeful variation\u2014features that we did not attempt to\noperationalize\u2014are more relevant, especially in oral communication, than\naverage values.\nAudience Response. Inspired by Atkinson (1984), we examined the\noccurrence of audience response.16 In this civilized format there was little of\nit; no instances of directly hostile response occurred. Of the four teams that\nevoked clapping from the audience, one won and three lost. As for laughter,\nalthough it was nearly always given in a spirit of sympathy, laughter-\n16 Atkinson (1984) assumed, reasonably, that applause is indicative of attention and\napproval. However, no theoretical reason predicts that applause indicates persuasive effect:\none should remember that the audience in Atkinson's material is generally a partisan group,\ntypically a national party convention.\n229 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nevoking teams ranked below average. When we asked which of two sides\ngot laughter more often, the negative effect became pronounced: six of\nthose teams won and 14 lost (p = .1154; two-tailed). This does seem to\nsuggest that the audience is not persuaded just by being amused nor by any\nassumed ethos appeal of a person with humor. Possibly, the appeal to\nlaughter in issue-oriented debates is a boomerang: in the final count it may\nleave the impression that a debater lacks sincerity.\nHostility. There is a widespread notion of debate as inherently eristic;\nWalton (1989/1992) places debate on a level below the \u201ccritical discussion\u201d\nas a semi-quarrel\u2014a description we find misleading (J\u00f8rgensen, 1998). We\ndefine hostile debate behavior, or eristic behavior, as any impoliteness\ntoward the opponent unnecessary to elucidate the difference of opinion.\nHostile debaters attack the person (Infante et al., 1992); they seek\ndivergence, making the gap as broad as possible; they show disrespect for\ntheir opponents and their views. Not only does this behavior pose an\nunavoidable threat to the opponent\u2019s face (Goffman, 1955), it also\ndeliberately attacks it. Within this broad definition, we established three\ncategories of features that identify the eristic: (1) hostile interrogation\u2014\nuntimely interruption, demanding an unwilling yes or no answer, or\ndistorted summary; (2) direct personal attacks\u2014slurs on the opponent's\nexternal characteristics, such as looks, age, or sex; attacks on the opponent's\ncharacter such as truthfulness or motives; verbal aggressiveness, such as\nderogatory expressions, insults, and name calling; (3) non verbal expression\nof hostility\u2014through voice, facial expressions, body postures, or gestures.\nThere are, of course, degrees of hostility. We identified hostile debaters\nby asking whether their team had a number of the hostile features or used\none of them repeatedly or emphatically, in such a way that the impression\nof hostility attached to the whole. By this criterion, 10 out of 62 debate\nteams were clearly eristic. Eight were more hostile than their opponents:\nfour of these were winners, four losers.\nThe picture is thus inconclusive. However, one eristic feature that we\nfound meaningful to test in isolation did seem to have a negative effect.\nThis is a subtype of conspiracy arguments that we call the coup argument:\nThe debater accuses the opponent of having a hidden agenda behind his or\nher claim. Teams with this feature won twice but lost seven times (p =\n.1796, two-tailed). Their average rank was 10.8 (against a total average of\n16). Eight of nine debaters using coup arguments were in the B group; these\ndefenders of the status quo ranked significantly lower than the rest (p = .05,\ntwo-tailed).\n230 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nNonsupportive Testimony. A few debaters used witnesses who explicitly\ndid not support their claims. We found two types: (1) neutral witnesses,\nwho took no stand on the claim, and (2) disagreeing witnesses, who\nsupported the opponent\u2019s claim.\nThese strategies recall the distinction between biased, unbiased, and\nreluctant testimony (Arnold and McCroskey, 1967). They reflect the\ndebater's confidence that \u201cbare facts\u201d will persuade the jurors. Apparently,\nthey do not. Only one debater using non-supportive testimony won; four\nlost. Their average rank was 9.3 (against 16). The reason might be that if\nthe testimony offered by the witness does not warrant the claim in the eyes\nof the witness him- or herself, why should it impress the jurors? There may\nalso be an ethos effect: a debater who says, \u201cWe just lay down the facts, we\ndon\u2019t tell you what to think,\u201d may seem not to care about the audience\u2019s\nopinion, thus wasting its time and, in fact, declaring his or her own evidence\nirrelevant.\nTypes of Grounds. The types of grounds offered by debaters formed a\nmajor part of our study. (We adopt the layout and terminology introduced\nby Toulmin, 1958, revised in Toulmin et al., 1984.) Four types recurred\nconstantly and cover most of the argumentation in the material: (1)\nexamples used as precedents, which again were of three kinds\u2014precedents\nfrom the past, contemporary precedents from other countries, and\nprecedents based on analogy; (2) grounds involving statistical evidence; (3)\nspecific instances; and (4) ideological grounds. A fifth main type, appeal to\nauthority, was disregarded because the use of witnesses created a hybrid of\nexpert testimony and external appeal to authority, making the distinction\nbetween them inoperative.\nContemporary precedents from other countries were used by one or both\ndebaters in 23 of 31 debates. They appear to be a productive modern topos,\nan element in any debater\u2019s heuristics. By contrast, the past was rarely\nreferred to and then mainly for negative precedents. A few positive models\nfrom the past were used to show the proposed action as one step in a long\nprogression. Ideals were located in the future, not in the past as in the topoi\nof Founding Fathers and the Golden Age in the classical tradition (Finley,\n1975; Zarefsky, 1990).\nWe saw no persuasive effect of precedents as such. The important\ndistinction, one might assume, is between using them well and badly. The\nlack of an operational criterion of good precedents prevented us from\ntesting this assumption.\n231 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nA similar dim picture emerged concerning the effect of statistical\nevidence. Debaters who used expert witnesses to present a high\nconcentration of numerical information won four times and lost four times.\nFour teams that used decidedly more statistical evidence than their\nopponents won, and seven lost.\nAn interesting type of ground was the single, specific instance of the\nissue at hand. In our definition, a specific instance should narrate a specific\nepisode, real or hypothetical, or introduce a representative specimen, such\nas a witness who testifies on the impact of a proposed action for the\ncompany where she works, without narrating one evolving event. Such\nspecific instances, however, appeared in most debates. We did not test how\nusers compared with nonusers because there were issues for which specific\ninstances would have been less appropriate. However, the few debaters\nwho, in our view, might have relied much more on them than they did\nranked far below average.\nSharpening our criterion, we identified debaters who devoted an entire\ntestimony (out of three) to a first-hand account by the witness of a specific\ninstance. These 22 debaters ranked above average, but not significantly.\nSecond, we ventured to apply qualitative criteria. We defined a good\nspecific instance as one that was relevant and weighty. A similar\nrequirement relating to arguments generally was suggested by Hitchcock\n(1992). Five debaters had obvious problems with the relevance or weight of\nthe instances they presented. We applied the criterion with caution,\neliminating only instances whose off-the-point or trivial characters was, in\nour view, blatant. Of those who remained, nine won and two lost (p =\n.0327); the rank order test yielded p < .06 for the A group and p < .05 for\nthe B group. This strongly suggests that first-hand testimony relating a\nrelevant and weighty specific instance is persuasive.\nWe hypothesized, more generally, that any good use of specific\ninstantiation is persuasive. To test this, we considered the amount of\nspecific instantiation presented by each debater, firsthand or secondhand. A\ndebater was considered to have more specific instantiation than his or her\nopponent if the difference was at least of the order of one elaborated\ninstance or two instances that were somewhat extended. Again, we\ndisregarded specific instances that we considered obviously irrelevant or\ntrivial. Of the 17 debaters who had more relevant, weighty specific\ninstantiation than their opponents, 12 won and five lost (p = .0717). We take\nthis as confirmation that in issue-oriented debates, what we may call\nextended use of good specific instances is a persuasive feature.\n232 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nA very different strategy is what we call ideological grounds. We are not\nusing the term in the Marxist sense of \u201cfalse consciousness.\u201d Rather, in a\nnon-evaluative way, \u201cideological\u201d for us refers to argumentation in which a\ndebater supports his or her claim by identifying the issue as an instance of a\nmore abstract evaluative concept.17\nIdeological grounds abounded in a debate on abortion; one side argued\nthat \u201cNo one should have the right to exterminate others,\u201d and the other said\nthat \u201cEvery woman should have the right to control her own life\u201d (our\nitalics). \u201cExterminate others\u201d and \u201ccontrol one\u2019s own life\u201d are evaluative\nterms far higher on a ladder of abstraction than the issue at hand: abortion.\nTwelve debaters clearly offered ideological notions (as defined here) as\nimportant, independent grounds for their claim. Their average rank was\n11.0 (against 16). In the eight debates in which ideological debaters\nconfronted non-ideological opponents, they lost every time (p = .0078, two-\ntailed). As the groups were small, a two-tailed rank order test gave less\nimpressive results (p < .20 in both groups). All 10 debaters using\nideological grounds more than their opponents lost (p = .0020, two-tailed).\nAs with many other features, we realize that the apparent preference in\nthe audience for non-ideological grounds, even if internally valid, may not\ntransfer to other situations; however, in a forensic debate format like Town\nParliament, the use of ideological grounds seems to be a losing strategy.\nWhy? One reason might be that ideological grounds offer no new\ninformation. Placing abortion under the category \u201cextermination of life\u201d\ndoes not extend or deepen the audience\u2019s store of facts about abortion.\nIn this sense, ideological argument and specific instantiation represent\nopposite extremes on the same dimension. Specific instantiation is about the\nconcrete, everyday consequences of a proposition; moving down on a\nladder of abstraction, the debater finds instances of the issue, giving\ninformation that is perhaps new to the audience and in any case \u201cenhancing\npresence\u201d (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969). Ideological grounds\nrepresent an upward move on the same ladder, classifying the issue as one\n17 Recently, there have been several attempts to redefine ideology, separating the concept\nfrom the false consciousness notion of critical and Marxist theory and bringing it in line with\nthe more intuitive way it is used in everyday political commentary (Flood, 1996; Hinich and\nMunger, 1994). An ideology, in these attempts, is a system of generalized, evaluative\nconcepts that subsumes many specific phenomena. An individual holding an ideology is able\nto take a stand on an issue as soon as the issue is subsumed under an ideological concept,\nwithout requiring additional or specific information about it. Argumentation that seeks to\npersuade by subsuming phenomena in this way is, in our terminology, ideological.\n233 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\ninstance of an evaluative abstraction. The two opposite strategies are\nindependently distributed, permitting us to add up the two results; in\nconjunction, they indicate strongly that persuasiveness in an issue-oriented\ndebate increases with the amount of relevant and weighty instantiation.\nRhetorical Strategy. Gradually, we became aware of two opposite\ntendencies in overall argumentative strategy. Some debaters tended to base\ntheir claims on multiple grounds: parallel, mutually independent grounds in\ndirect support of their claim. Others used a single ground: one central or\noverarching reason, which may be supported by subordinate grounds or\nsupplemented by rebuttals of the opponent\u2019s grounds. To make this\ndistinction manageable, we coded debaters\u2019 strategy on the basis of their\nconcluding speeches.\nSingle-ground debaters won 11 times and lost three times (p = .0574).\nThe rank order test for A debaters yielded p = .14; for B debaters, p = .08.\nMultiple ground debaters lost 12 times and won twice (p = .0130). The rank\norder test for A debaters yielded p = .10; for B debaters, p = .28 (two-\ntailed). A rank order test on degrees of singularity showed that winners\nranked significantly higher on this feature than losers (p < .01, two-tailed).\nThis result might be taken to suggest that jurors prefer simplistic views,\nbut it might also be attributable to the presence of a focus in the debater\u2019s\nperformance. Much work in writing pedagogy and rhetoric emphasizes the\nimportance of structuring utterances around one organizing viewpoint: a\nwell-formed text should \u201csay one thing\u201d (Meyer, 1975; Murray, 1984).\nSuch a strategy creates a hierarchy, rather than a battery, of arguments. The\ndominance of one ground means that more evidence and instantiation may\nbe offered in its support, and this may account for the persuasiveness of the\nsingle-ground strategy. This fits with the observation that several debaters\nwhose concluding speeches were not of the single-ground type but who all\nalong dwelled much longer on one ground than on others also did very well.\nA related criterion is whether debaters\u2019 concluding speeches were\nlargely repetitions of their opening remarks or largely presented material\nnot found there. Debaters of the former type won six times and lost three\ntimes; debaters of the latter type won three times and lost eight times. A\nrank order test on degree of repetition showed that winners tended to rank\nhigher on this feature than losers (p = .07).\nThis feature seems related to another strategy: having the last word.\nSome debaters managed to make an interrogation end in a way that\nemphasized an important point of their own\u2014either by leading the witness\n234 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nto give the exact answer needed to emphasize the point or by stating it in a\nremark of their own. Debaters who failed to have the last word let\ninterrogations end at points that seemed arbitrary, often because they could\nthink of no further questions, or they tried to have the last word but were\nbeaten to it by the witness. Last-word debaters, remarkably, won 19 times\nand lost twice (p < .0001). The rank order test yielded p < .01 for both\ngroups. We do not interpret this as showing that jurors prefer slogan-laden\nor repetitive argumentation. Instead, we suggest that they reward the last\nword debater\u2019s manifest energy and will to present a unified argument.\nFinally, what we call claim demarcation helps complete the picture of\nwinning strategy. In the debate on abortion, the anti-abortionist demarcated\nhis claim, stating that the issue was \u201cnot whether abortions may occur at all,\nbut whether abortions may be performed for any reason whatever, however\ntrivial or frivolous.\u201d The function of this maneuver is to indicate that one\u2019s\nclaim is narrower than some people might think. Logically, this is\nunnecessary, but rhetorically it is meaningful to signal to the jurors that they\nshould only change their views in a specified respect, not adopt an entirely\nnew outlook. Debaters whose concluding speech demarcated their claim\nwon 12 times and lost three times (p = .0352, two-tailed). The rank order\ntests yielded p = 0.01 for the A group, p = 0.05 for the B group.\nWe believe this feature tallies with other observations we have made on\nargumentative strategy. What the typical winning debater did was to press\none point (a single ground) with comprehensive support (specific\ninstantiation) in an insistent manner (last word) to gain adherence to an\nexplicitly limited claim (claim demarcation).\nDiscussion\nOverall Pattern and Underlying Persuasive Qualities. The features we\nhave identified above are situated on different levels of abstraction: some\nare specific and local, others represent more abstract properties.18 To extract\n18 In addition to the statistics described, we used two types of multivariate analysis: logistic\nregression and CART (classification and regression trees). In their way, these may reveal\nwhether any features have special power to predict winners. (Only the winner/loser\nparameter was used, not rank orders.)\nLogistic regression, performed on all debaters for whom data on all features were\navailable, yielded the following features: (1) having the last word, (2) dismissive attitude\n(negative loading), (3) modulated voice, (4) the single ground (positive loading) versus\nmultiple grounds (negative loading), (5) age over 55, (6) ordinary people used as witnesses\n235 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\na pattern and explain how it portrays the persuasive debater, we now shift to\na more speculative, qualitative mode, looking for underlying qualities that\nmay be too abstract to be testable.\nWe suggest that the following four factors may be seen as the\nfundamental persuasive qualities in the debate format we studied: precision,\nfirmness, energy, and commitment. Clearly, these are interrelated and partly\noverlapping constructs.\nThey are all instantiated in the winning nonverbal features discussed\nabove: modulated voice, energetic articulation, intense gaze, energetic\nposture, eager gesticulation, and firm, directive gestures. All of these\ninstantiate energy and commitment. Intense gaze and firm, directive\ngestures signal firmness. Firm, directive gestures are highly specific and\nselectively used; that is, they demand and signal precision. Similarly,\nmodulated voice and energetic articulation are used to reinforce selected\naspects of content, thus reflecting the speaker\u2019s energy and commitment to\nwhat he or she says. Energy in articulation similarly signals insistence and\nhence firmness. Conversely, the significant losing features\u2014monotonous\nvoice and sloppy articulation\u2014suggest the absence of all four underlying\nqualities.\nThe other results may, in retrospect, be reduced to the same\ndenominators: If the evocation of applause and laughter is not persuasive,\nthis may be because the debater seems to lack commitment and precision,\nexpending energy on peripherals. Lack of precision might also explain the\nineffectiveness of hostility and the negative effect of coup arguments: by\nstooping to personal attack rather than concentrating on the issue, the\ndebater expends energy diffusely. Nonsupportive testimony obviously\nreflects noncommitment. Ideological grounds are weak in issue-oriented\n(negative loading), and (7) full firsthand testimony giving a relevant and weighty specific\ninstance.\nWhen the A and B groups were analyzed separately, three additional features emerged:\nfor the A group, claim demarcation and all-male debate team and for the B group,\nideological grounds (negative loading).\nCART yielded an inverted tree in which each node bifurcated into a winner branch and a\nloser branch. The winner\u2019s route in the CART analysis (based on the 30 debaters for whom\nall data were available) contained the following three features: (1) having the last word, (2)\nmultiple grounds (negative loading), and (3) monotonous voice (negative loading). In other\nwords, any debater in our material who had the last word, did not use multiple grounds, and\ndid not speak in a monotonous voice was a winner.\nCART analysis also yielded an alternative ordered list of highly predictive features,\nwhich included, in addition to features already mentioned, the winning nonverbal features\ndiscussed above and conspiracy arguments (negative loading).\n236 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\ndebates-possibly because the concepts they appeal to are by nature vague.\nSpecific instantiation embodies precision by supplying in-depth, detailed\ninformation; the insistence of debaters who stay on one specific instance\nthroughout a whole testimony signals energy and firmness. The power of\nthe single-ground strategy, and the weakness of parallel grounds, bespeaks\njurors\u2019 preference for argumentation that concentrates its energy rather than\nbeing wasted across a wide range. Similarly, in claim demarcation the claim\nis circumscribed with careful precision. Finally, debaters who want to have\nthe last word must stick firmly to their line of argument and energetically\ndrive home their precise point at the strategic moment.\nIt is natural here to raise a question that has hovered in our minds\nthroughout this project: does our profile of the winning debater bring alarm\nor reassurance for those who are concerned about norms of discourse in\npublic debate? In incisive analyses, Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1992) called\nfor \u201cfair, accurate, contextual, comparative, engaged campaign discourse\u201d\n(p. 11). She also demonstrated that whereas campaigning politicians failed\nto honor this ideal, in congressional debates they\ndelivered thoughtful speeches that engaged the ideas of others, examined\nevidence, and moved with care to warranted conclusions. \u2026 The\nmembers of Congress spoke a language of good will, presuming the\nintegrity of those in disagreement. Rarely were the motives or integrity\nof those in disagreement impugned. (Jamieson, 1992, pp. 203-204)\nDoes our typical debate winner resemble the dirty campaigner or the\nthoughtful lawmaker?\nOur answer is that the representative audiences in our debates cast their\nvote for evidence and thoughtful reasoning. Our winning debaters, we\nsuggest, would on the whole be applauded by those who, like Jamieson, call\nfor reasoned argument in public debate.\nVote-Gathering Versus Vote-Shifting Rhetoric. The two faces of the\nmodern politician portrayed by Jamieson (1992) resemble two modes of\npolitical rhetoric exemplified in Town Parliament. As explained, we have,\nfor 20 of the 37 debates, data on how many jurors moved between the yes,\nno, and undecided groups. We did not use these incomplete data\nstatistically, but they suggest an interesting pattern.\nIn bipartisan debates there are two ways to win votes. Vote-gathering is\nto win undecided votes; vote-shifting is to win votes from the opposition.\nWinning debaters generally do both, but some debaters are much better in\none of these respects than in the other. Typical vote-gatherers seem to\n237 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nprefer ideological arguments; they lean toward categorical, polarized\nformulations; and they tend to use attention-getting devices reminiscent of\npopular journalism. They are \u201ctelegenic.\u201d Typical vote-shifters, by contrast,\ntend to use the single ground strategy; they use much specific instantiation;\nthey often demarcate their claims; and they are generally moderate and\npolite verbally as well as nonverbally. They are less sprightly than vote-\ngatherers, but more earnest and insistent.\nAn interesting point is that whereas vote-gatherers are undoubtedly\nfavored by television and other popular media, the winner in debates of the\ntype we studied was more likely to be a typical vote-shifter.19\nThe reason is simple. On two-way issues, votes won from the opposition\ncount twice: down for them, up for us. And although partisan voters are no\ndoubt less volatile than the undecided, they were also, in our material, more\nnumerous: on the average, there were 10 undecided voters in the first poll\n(of which about eight took sides in the second poll) against 90 partisan\nvoters (of which about nine changed sides and about two joined the\nundecided). Hence, when a pure vote-gatherer confronts a pure vote-shifter,\nthe latter is likely to win. In other words, a strategy in issue-oriented\ndebates that concentrates on those of the opponent\u2019s followers that can be\nshifted, rather than on the undecided, leads to higher standards of argument,\nand it pays.\nSuch a result flouts much contemporary campaign strategy, perhaps\nespecially in the United States. A likely explanation is that in American\npresidential elections, the turnout is usually about 50 percent, which means\nthat an obvious strategy is to gather (mobilize) some of the passive 50\npercent. Even John Kennedy was a typical vote-gatherer: an interview\nsurvey (Lang and Lang, 1962) showed that in the Kennedy Nixon television\ndebates, he won 18 new votes (out of 95). However, only three of these 18\nwere shifted from Nixon\u2019s side, whereas 15 had been undecided (who all\ndeclared that they were basically Democrats). By contrast, with only 10\npercent undecided in our study (paralleling the fact that the turnout in\nDanish elections usually is between 80 percent and 90 percent), typical vote\ngatherers had fewer latent followers to mobilize.\nHow far are the hypotheses in this study generalizable to other types of\ndebate, particularly the \u201cvote-for-me\u201d debates so typical of political\n19 It is suggestive that of five politicians who were singled out in a newspaper article by two\nnoted media experts as exceptionally able to \u201ccommunicate on TV\u201d (Politiken, March 14,\n1989), four had appeared as debaters in Town Parliament\u2014and lost.\n238 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\ncampaigns? We cannot be sure, but we assume that, all else equal, those by\nwhom we are persuaded in deliberative debate, that is, those we trust to\nadvise us best, are also those we trust to lead us best. The qualities we have\nposited in our interpretation of the data\u2014precision, firmness, energy, and\ncommitment\u2014all seem as relevant in leadership as in deliberation. Of\ncourse all else is not equal. There is more to leadership than these qualities,\nbut why should there be a contradiction? If vote winning in presidential\ncampaign advertising, for example, seems to follow different rules from\nwhat we see in our study, then the reason may have to do with the medium\nand the format rather than with any intrinsic difference between issue-\noriented and candidate-oriented debates. Determining how far the similarity\ngoes between winning behavior in deliberative and personalized debate is a\ntask for further studies.\nOn an even more general level, we may also ask whether the effects we\nhave suggested will transfer from a Danish context. Cultures differ, and\npolitical cultures differ even more, so we might well have to do with purely\nlocal patterns. For example, our results on the effects of hostility or the\ninducement of laughter and applause might merely reflect the fact that this\nis an audience of Scandinavians, whom cultural clich\u00e9 portrays as cool,\ninhibited, and conflict shunning.\nEven so, there is a marked difference between the winner\u2019s profile in our\nquasi forensic debate format and the features that are considered winning in\ntypical television-mediated communication. Our main hypothesis, then, is\nthat debate format makes a difference and that this difference is hardly\nculture specific. Even if vote-gatherers have better chances in a typical\nAmerican context, we hypothesize that a live debate in a format such as\nours would still be more congenial to fair, evidence-oriented rhetoric, as\nrepresented by our winner\u2019s profile, than typical television-mediated\nformats. Future research and experience might put this hypothesis to the\ntest. If it finds support, political communication scholars would have reason\nto take a heightened interest in alternative political debate formats. David\nWeaver (1994), among others, has discussed how nontraditional media,\nsuch as electronic and televised town hall meetings, contribute to political\nagenda setting, enhancing voter involvement. Our study suggests, apart\nfrom this effect, that a town hall meeting format, if administered by the\nproducers in proper respect of its deliberative functions, may also enhance\nthe quality of political debate by rewarding engaged, thoughtful, accurate\ndiscourse.\n239 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\nIndeed, we might speculate whether political debates, even when\ncandidate or party oriented, might not, in the public interest, be turned more\ntoward sustained deliberation on issues. Leaders could be figures with\nvisions of what to do and engagement to persuade a majority that they are\nright, rather than figures who promise to do what a majority wants. What\nthe media could do would be to let candidates holding opposite views on\nkey issues engage in sustained forensic-type debates with, for instance, one\nissue per debate; the journalists might then act more as mere keepers of\norder.\nPerspective: A Future for Deliberative Rhetoric\nIn recent years, the role of television as a medium for political debate\nhas caused increasing concern. Appearing on Danish television on August\n15, 1993, the Nestor of television journalism, Walter Cronkite, expressed\ndisillusionment over the state of democratic debate mediated by television:\nOur use of television for political campaigns has been absolutely\ndisastrous to the democracy. Here is this magnificent medium to carry\nmeaningful debate on the serious subjects under consideration by the\ngovernment to the people, and it is not used in that fashion at all. Our\ndebates are a laugh. They are not debates at all, they are shows.\nOur main point is that debates in a format like the Town Parliament are\ngenerally not a laughing matter. Voters here tend to reward debaters who\nact out principles of serious deliberative argument, highlighting an ironic\ncontradiction between what television as a medium appears to demand and\nthe criteria for deliberative debate. Jurors laughed at the entertaining\ndebater\u2019s wisecracks\u2014and voted for the opponent. This calls to mind\nBennett\u2019s (1992, p. 402) paradox: \u201cpeople tune in, but ultimately turn\nagainst, the politicians and journalists who make the news.\u201d As voters,\nballot in hand, we seem to judge the persuasiveness of a debater\u2019s case by\ncriteria other than those by which we, as viewers, remote control in hand,\nrespond to television programs.\nCurrently, political communication seems dominated by viewers\u2019 needs,\nnot voters\u2019. Political debate is equated with quarrel and telegenic spectacle.\nBut if television continues to disregard our needs as voters, we may become\na body of cheering or jeering spectators, with no real participation in the\npolitical process.\nHowever, scholars in communication and rhetoric should not turn\ncynical. We believe our study suggests that there is indeed a place, even\n240 Rhetoric That Shifts Votes\ntoday, for deliberative public debate. Television has, irreversibly, become\nthe town hall where most public communication is transacted; our\ninterpretation of the Town Parliament supports a call for debate formats on\ntelevision that rely on deliberative argument. Whatever fare television\nviewers prefer, we suggest that as voters, watching such debates, they\ndemand and reward thoughtful, engaged persuasion, delivered in the\nlanguage of good will.\nREFERENCES\nArnold, W.E., and J.C.

We criticize the view reflected\nin opinion polls and much political journalism that the voters, except for the\nundecided, have already taken permanent stands. Recalling and\nexemplifying our own distinction between vote-gathering and vote-shifting\nrhetoric, we argue that many voters can indeed be shifted. We propose a\nsimple taxonomy of voters, based on the two parameters \u201cinvolvement\u201d and\n\u201cassurance,\u201d which yields four types: spectators, partisans, abstainers, and\ndeliberating citizens. The latter, high on involvement but often less high on\nassurance, are the ones most likely to be shifted, and rhetoric aimed at them\nwould, we suggest, give us more democratically useful debates.\nIn the pragma-dialectical approach to argumentation, as represented by\nvan Eemeren and Grootendorst (e.g., 1992) or Walton (1989, 1992, 1995),\ncritical discussion provides the normative model for rational argument. But\ndo the norms for critical discussion also apply to political debate? As\nrhetoricians, we insist that critical discussion and political debate are\ndifferent genres with different norms. Critical discussion is dialogical,\ndebate is trialogical (Dieckmann 1981, Klein 1991). The arguers in the\ndiscussion address each other with the cooperative goal of resolving the\ndispute; debaters do not argue in order to persuade each other, but to win\nthe adherence of a third party: the audience (J\u00f8rgensen 1998).\nBecause of its trialogical nature, a debate must answer the needs of the\naudience. This means that a debate should be evaluated in relation to the\n* This article was co-authored with Charlotte J\u00f8rgensen.

We are interested not only in\nthe functions of debate, but also in the specific features of debates that serve\nthese functions: and our approach is normative.\nWe shall concentrate on issue-oriented debates, such as the Irish debate\nover the Ulster peace plan, or the Danish debate over the Amsterdam treaty.\nWhat we have to say about the rhetorical audience and the quality of public\ndebate has particular reference to how debate is conducted on TV.\nOpinion polls will tell us that the audience of such debates consists of\nthree groups: those in favor, those against, and the undecided.\nCommentators typically refer to the undecided as those who have not made\nup their minds yet, implying that all the others have indeed made up their\nminds. Accordingly, it is assumed that the outcome depends on the\nremaining undecided voters.\nBut this is misleading. Both among those in favor and among those\nagainst, there are many who have not made their minds up, and who may\nwell change sides\u2014under the influence of events or arguments. To\ndocument this, we may cite a poll in the French daily Lib\u00e9ration shortly\nbefore the referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty in 1992. Here\u2014\ninterestingly\u2014voters were asked whether they might change sides on the\nissue. No less than 37 % of those who intended to vote yes admitted they\nmight also vote no, and conversely for 34 % of those who said they\nintended to vote no. It is probably true that especially in matters concerning\nthe European Union many voters are of two minds; they feel that there are\narguments on both sides of the issue, and they are constantly weighing them\nagainst each other.\nWhat this means is that on any issue, the audience represents a spectrum\nof opinion, with unmovable partisans at both ends, and with a fair number\nof voters near the middle of the road who lean to one side but who may be\nshifted. But debaters and TV programmers tend to make the undecided their\nprimary target because they falsely believe that the static and simplistic\nYes-Undecided-No model says all one needs to know about the debate\naudience. They forget the lesson of the Danish referendum which rejected\nMaastricht because many voters changed sides at a late stage, even at the\npolling station.\nTo understand how some voters can thus be of two minds, we shall\npropose a model of the debate audience (inspired by Tonsgaard 1992). This,\nin turn, will allow us to distinguish between the different functions of\n244 The Rhetorical Audience\ndebate for the public audience.\nIn Figure 1 (next page), the undecided are represented by the area\nbeneath the curve. The area above it represents the decided voters, i.e.,\nthose who say that they are going to vote yes or no, respectively. Those near\nthe curve are the hesitant voters. The point is that there are two variables\nwhich may explain why voters hesitate. These are represented by the two\naxes.\nThe x-axis represents involvement in the issue, that is, how important the\nvoter perceives the issue to be. The y-axis represents the voter's feeling of\nassurance on the issue. Those high in both assurance and involvement\nbelong in the area marked \u201cP\u201d (for partisans). What they will want from\ndebates is mainly reinforcement of their existing views. Those low in both\nassurance and involvement will belong in the area marked \u201cA\u201d (for\nabstainers, because these people will probably end up not voting at all). But\nit is also possible to have a quite fixed and assured view of the issue, either\nfor it or against it, and yet feel that it is all quite distant and uninteresting.\nThese voters\u2014high in assurance but low in involvement\u2014will be in the \u201cS\u201d\narea (for Spectators). They will probably feel little need for guidance\nbecause they know what they think\u2014but more of a need for entertainment,\nand some need for reinforcement. Finally, many voters\u2014certainly in\nDenmark\u2014see the European issue as highly important, but also as complex\nand baffling; and that is why they are hesitant. These voters\u2014who are high\nin involvement but low in assurance\u2014belong in the \u201cD\u201d area (for\ndeliberating citizens). Although they lean to one side, they feel they need to\nknow and understand more, because they are still of two minds; hence they\nwant the ongoing debate to give them guidance for the decision they\nconfront.\nThis segmentation of the debate audience reflects the analysis of three of\nthe audience roles defined by Gurevitch and Blumler (1977). Their account\nalso includes roles for \u201cmedia personnel\u201d and \u201cparty spokesmen,\u201d as seen in\ntable 1 (next page).\n245 The Rhetorical Audience\nS P\nS = Spectators\nP = Partisans\nA = Abstainers\nD = Deliberating citizens\nA D\nFigure 1: The Rhetorical Debate Audience\nAudience Media Personnel Party Spokesmen\nPartisan Editorial guide Gladiator\nLiberal citizen Moderator Rational persuader\nMonitor Watchdog Information provider\nSpectator Entertainer Actor/Performer\nTable 1: The Complementarity of Roles in\na Political Communication System\nIn our context, we may disregard the \u201cmonitor\u201d role, since we regard it\nas less relevant for members of a debate audience, and more applicable to,\nfor example, political scientists and commentators. What the voter seeks\nwhen he appears in the partisan role is precisely \u201creinforcement of his\nexisting beliefs\u201d; as a spectator, he seeks \u201cexcitement and other affective\n246 The Rhetorical Audience\nsatisfactions\u201d; as a deliberating citizen\u2014 or, as Gurevitch and Blumler have\nit, \u201cliberal citizen\u201d\u2014the voter seeks \u201cguidance in deciding how to vote\u201d\n(1977, p. 276).\nOur model of the debate audience explains the notion of audience roles\nand their underlying parameters. The model also implies that there are two\nbasically different ways that a debater can try to increase adherence to his\nview, depending on to which segment of the model he is mainly appealing.\n1) The debater can prefer to appeal mainly to those who are rather high\nin assurance, but low in involvement. These people will basically tend to\nchoose the spectator role. Since they are rather assured about their views,\nthe debater must concentrate on those voters in this group who lean to his\nside already. Those who plan to vote for the side anyway will merely have\ntheir enthusiasm boosted. Those who might not have voted may be\nstimulated to come out and do so. Thus the way this strategy may gain votes\nis by mobilizing some of the undecided vote. We call this strategy vote-\ngathering.\n2) The other general strategy is to appeal to those voters who lean to the\nother side but who may be won over. These people are high in involvement,\nthat is, they think the issue is important; but they are low in assurance.\nTypically, they arc deliberating citizens who acknowledge that there are\ntwo sides to the issue and that their decision should be based on the weight\nof the arguments. As we have pointed out, there are often a substantial\nnumber of such voters on both sides. We call this strategy vote-shifting.\nThe distinction between vote-gathering and vote-shifting was one of the\nperspectives we became aware of in a study of televised public policy\ndebates in Denmark (J\u00f8rgensen, Kock, and R\u00f8rbech 1994; 1998; this\nvolume, Chapter 12). In these debates we found voting patterns suggesting\nthat some debaters are particularly good at vote-gathering, others at vote-\nshifting. For example, in one debate, in front of a hundred representative\njurors, one debater gathered no less than 14 votes from the undecided\ngroup, but she shifted only one from the opposite side; the opponent\ngathered just 5, but shifted 9. This is shown in Figure 2, where the blue\ncolumns show votes gathered and the red ones show votes shifted.\nThe typical vote-gatherer will tend to claim fundamental, black-and-\nwhite differences and introduce a series of further points of contention that\nwill broaden the front between the two sides. He will claim a fundamental\nideological opposition between the two sides: he will impute a series of\nfurther claims and positions to the opponent that have not been mentioned\nby the opponent himself; he will see the opponent's proposal as \u201cthe thin\n247 The Rhetorical Audience\nend of the wedge,\u201d as part of a large campaign, or even of a conspiracy; he\nmay attack his opponent\u2019s motives, he may bring in matters that cast doubt\non the opponent\u2019s intelligence, ethics, or good will; he will typically\nattack the weakest arguments made by the opponent, trying to make them\nout as ridiculous, or as self-contradictory. Front-broadening arguers\ngenerally spend much energy on refutations of arguments made by the\nopponent, and on counter-refutations of refutations, and so on ad infinitum.\nIn all this, the issue at hand will often disappear in a confusing verbal\nduel. As audience, we may find ourselves turning our heads back from right\nto left and back again, as if watching a tennis match. Refutation and\ncounter-refutation are what we would call secondary argumentation, as\ndistinct from primary arguments. These are the grounds offered by the\ndebaters in direct support of their standpoints\u2014i.e., the main merits of their\nown proposal, or the drawbacks of the opponent\u2019s. Throughout, the front-\nbroadening debater introduces topics of disagreement that are not necessary\nto elucidate the disagreement at hand.\nThe vote-shifter, on the other hand, will argue so as to narrow the front,\nconcentrating on the specific issue that separates the opponents. He will, for\nexample, concede that the opponent has certain weighty arguments, but he\n248 The Rhetorical Audience\nwill then try to show that his own arguments are weightier. He will typically\nnarrow or demarcate his claim, stating, for example, that he does not\nadvocate a federal super-state in Europe, but that he does strongly advocate\na union of nation states for certain reasons. He will concentrate on his own\nprimary grounds for his claim; for example, he will concentrate on the main\nreasons why he thinks the Amsterdam treaty is a good idea (or, if he is\nagainst it, a bad idea), and he will spend less energy refuting the opponent\u2019s\ngrounds, or counter-refuting the opponent\u2019s refutations. We might add that\nthis emphasis on primary grounds, rather than on refutation, is one point\nwhere our normative criteria, based on audience needs, differ from the\nnorms for critical discussion.\nFurthermore, the front-narrowing debater will treat his opponent with\npoliteness and respect and avoid face-threatening attacks on his person,\nethics, and competence. In all these maneuvers, the debater seeks to find\nand preserve whatever common ground there is between the opposite sides,\nnarrowing the front to what is absolutely necessary.\nIn terms of the traditional rhetorical appeals, the vote-gatherer will rely\nheavily on pathos and will, for instance, use Atkinson\u2019s \u201cclaptraps\u201d in\nabundance (Atkinson 1984). As is well known, Atkinson described two\nprincipal types of claptrap: the contrast, which is clearly a front-broadening\nfeature, and the list of three, a schematic figure of great dynamism, known\nfrom ritual and folk literature. Both are clearly front-broadening devices to\nenhance the feeling of \u201cus\u201d against \u201cthem.\u201d The use of these devices will\nhelp the vote-gatherer boost the partisan\u2019s spirit and give the spectators a\ngood show. The vote-shifter, in contrast, relies mainly on logos appeals and\navoids devices that may appear cheap or facile. As for ethos, the vote-\ngatherer will tend to impress by being either sparkling or passionate, while\nthe vote-shifter tends to be a more academic type, perhaps slightly stiff and\ndry, but serious and knowledgeable.\nAll in all, it is clear that of these two types of argumentation, the vote-\ngathering, front-broadening type is by far the more \u201ctelegenic,\u201d as media\npeople say. This brings us to the role of TV in public debate.\nNow, our point in contrasting the two types is of course not that debaters\nshould become pure vote-shifters and never try to be vote-gatherers. Surely\ngood debaters are those who manage to combine elements from both\nstrategies. Nor do we claim that vote-gathering is bad rhetoric at all times.\nMany situations call especially for vote-gathering; but issue-oriented debate\ndoes not. The problem is that many forces in modern TV-mediated\ndemocracy unite in suppressing the kind of political argument that aspires,\n249 The Rhetorical Audience\nand inspires, to vote-shifting debate. TV debates, when best, are both\nentertaining and informative. But at times there is a conflict. What works\nwell as TV is often front-broadening features that leave little opportunity\nfor vote-shifting rhetoric to unfold; what boosts and entertains partisans and\nspectators often alienates the deliberating citizen looking for guidance. In\nconsequence, the media furthers the transformation of citizens to a body of,\nin Jamieson\u2019s words, viewers \u201cobserving the \u2018sport\u2019 of politics\u201d (Jamieson\n1992, p. 191).\nFront-broadening, vote-gathering TV debates thus appear to be the\nmodem version of sophistic rhetoric. Sophistic debate is basically a type of\ncombat, with debaters in the role of gladiators, in Gurevitch and Blumler\u2019s\nterm. Such a debate may serve a mobilizing purpose for us if we are\npartisans of the gladiators, but that role easily slips into the purely\nspectatorial role where debaters are as much actors, at whose performance\nwe either applaud or hiss. This audience role echoes Aristotle\u2019s description\nof the auditor as \u201cspectator'\u2019\u201d in epideictic speech, vs. the role as \u201cjudge\u201d in\npolitical and forensic speech. According to Aristotle, the spectator is\nconcerned with the ability of the speaker (Rhetoric III, 1358b). The\nspectator, as George Kennedy explains, \u201cis not called upon to take a\nspecific action, in the way that an assemblyman or juryman is called upon\nto vote\u201d; the whole event becomes \u201can oratorical contest\u201d (Aristotle 1991,\np. 48, note 77)\u2014which is also how commentators see it when they discuss\nwhich politician \u201cdid best\u201d in a TV debate. Thus the deliberative function of\ndebate is suppressed by the simplistic question, so dear to the media, of\n\u201cwho loses and who wins.\u201d While spectators see such debates as sporting\nevents, their effect on partisans may be described in the words of Perelman\nand Olbrechts-Tyteca commenting on the epideictic genre: \u201cthe\nargumentation in epidictic discourse sets out to increase the intensity of\nadherence to certain values\u201d (1969, p. 51).\nWhat is problematic with the spectator and partisan roles according to\nthe deliberative ideal is that they tend to turn the audience into mere\nbystanders rather than participants in the political process. Only as\ndeliberating citizens do we become a genuine rhetorical audience in Bitzer's\nsense of the word\u2014an audience of decision-makers \u201ccapable of being\ninfluenced by discourse and of being mediators of change\u201d (Bitzer 1968;\n1992, p. 7).\nWe may compare our view here with Walton\u2019s pragmatic approach:\nWalton is critical of debaters who have fixed positions, so that there is no\n\u201cgenuine chance of either side persuading the other\u201d (1992, p. 157).\n250 The Rhetorical Audience\nHowever, Walton ignores the trialogical nature of debate, which makes it\nquite acceptable for debaters to be unwilling to be persuaded by each other.\nWhat threatens the legitimacy of debate is when it is conducted in such a\nway that there is no chance of anyone in the audience shifting to the other\nside.\nTo sum up, what we advocate in issue-oriented debate is that vote-\nshifting argumentation be allowed to unfold\u2014i.e., argumentation strongly\ncharacterized by the features we have called front-narrowing. The purpose,\nof course, is not the shifting of voters as such. We call for more vote-\nshifting argumentation for normative reasons. We propose that if debaters\nargue with the shiftable voters on the opposite side as their primary\naddressees, this would stimulate them to produce convincing\nargumentation, i.e., arguments that those on both sides of the boundary who\nrecognize the force of argument would consider weighty\u2014whether they are\npersuaded by them or not. Thus, the deliberative goal would not be lost,\nnamely that of providing citizens with the best arguments on both sides, to\nbe weighed against each other, in order to reach a decision. The net result at\nthe polling station would perhaps be pretty much the same. But decisions\nwould be made on a firmer basis, and debates would better serve the\npurpose of informed political argument. They would not degenerate into\nmere sports events for spectators or pep talk for partisans, and citizens\nmight remain active participants in the political process.\nREFERENCES\nAristotle. 1991.

This result contrasts with earlier studies of the credibility\nconstruct, which take it to merely be a covering umbrella term for all the\nproperties that a public spokesperson might wish to have. We find\ncredibility to comprise properties like intelligence and competence, but\nalso\u2014which is perhaps more noteworthy\u2014ability to see a matter from\ndifferent angles, balance, respect for others\u2019 opinions, and ability to admit\na mistake. Charisma, in contrast, is comprised of properties including\nextroversion, passion, dynamism, and self-confidence.\n\u201c\u2026but when I was speaking in America, they told me that there were\n105 million TV sets in America ... It is a strange feeling to speak to\nmillions of people. I think one feels it. There is something strange about\ntelevision, very odd, also in another way. They told me over there that\ntelevision is dangerous, it gives you away, you can\u2019t hide your true\nnature, appearing on television. They said that McCarthy, then a very\npopular person, was ruined in one or two days, after appearing on\ntelevision. People did not believe him, or they did not trust him any\nmore \u2026 . In general, people who appeared on television over there were\nkind of \u201cwaterproof.\u201d\n(Quotation from radio interview with Karen Blixen, 1955)\nBackground\nIn our generation, audio-visual media have become a dominant force in\nthe public arena, for political debate, transmission of news, business, and\nfor many other purposes. In this context, the credibility of public persons\nhas become an important item in the public sphere. For example, in\nDenmark the current Prime Minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is said by\n* Co-authored with Flemming Hansen. Originally published in Nordicom Review 24 (2003),\n25-30. Reprinted with permission of the Publisher. Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nmany commentators to have a severe \u201ccredibility problem.\u201d This liability is\nsaid to have brought him defeat in the referendum he had called on the\ncommon European currency in September, 2000, which was won by the\nanti-Euro coalition, and it is also cited as grounds for his likely upset in the\nupcoming general election. Such claims are current in spite of the fact that\nMr. Nyrup Rasmussen's administration is admitted to have performed well\nby objective standards, at least as far as the economy is concerned.\nIt is not a new fact that credibility is considered important. For the last\n50 years or so, communication scholars have studied it intensively. Hovland\net al. (1953) initiated this effort, Andersen & Clevenger (1963) summarized\nwork so far, followed by, among many others, J. McCroskey (e.g.,\nMcCroskey 1966; Whitehead 1968; Tuppen 1974).\nAfter the heyday of empirical credibility studies, a new facet to the issue\ncame into focus as television became the main source of political and other\npublic communication. The ability to communicate well on TV was\nhighlighted in the 1980\u2019s in press commentaries as well as scholarly studies\ncentering on President Ronald Reagan as a \u201cmaster communicator.\u201d\nReagan\u2019s masterful handling of the specific demands of this all-important\nmedium were scrutinized. Since then, it has been a standard assumption that\nthe ability to perform well on TV and in other mass-mediated contexts is\ncrucial to success in politics as well as in business and public opinion\ngenerally, and there is a strong tendency to equate the notion of a source's\ncredibility with that source\u2019s ability to handle TV and other media well and\nto \u201ccome across\u201d in a way that will ingratiate viewers.\nThat raises the question as to what connection there might be between\nthese two constructs: 1) credibility, as analyzed in the many empirical\nstudies since the 50\u2019s, and 2) the status as mass-mediated \u201cmaster\ncommunicator,\u201d as instantiated by Ronald Reagan, or in later decades, Bill\nClinton or British PM Tony Blair. Are these two constructs basically the\nsame? Or are they different but correlated? Or are they perhaps clearly\nseparate?\nTo return to the case of Prime Minister Nyrup Rasmussen, it is generally\nsaid not only that his credibility is low, but also that his performance on TV\nis often toe-cringing. One way to see such a case is to conclude that\ncredibility and the qualities that make a master communicator are closely\nconnected, and that this is why a public figure would rank low in both\nrespects.\n254 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nOn the other hand, there are observations that might suggest a different\nhypothesis. A point of departure for this study has been the regular\nappearance of credibility ratings for public persons, media, and\norganizations. One source of such ratings in Denmark has been the business\nweekly B\u00f8rsens Nyhedsmagasin, which publishes an annual \u201ccredibility\nbarometer.\u201d More than once, we have been struck by the fact that the people\nand organizations usually considered \u201cmaster communicators\u201d\u2014for\nexample those politicians most praised by the media and by communication\nexperts as being \u201ctelegenic,\u201d capable of \u201ccoming across\u201d on TV, of\ncommunicating in \u201cheadlines,\u201d etc.\u2014are often quite low on the list.\nConversely, figures or organizations at the top of the list are generally such\nas usually appear to lack or to shun these qualities; more typically, they\nappear reflective, balanced, measured, and even reticent in their media\nappearances.\nFrom these observations we have built the hypothesis that in this age of\nmass-mediated communication there might well be more than one\ndimension on which the public communication of, e.g., politicians and\norganizations are evaluated by the general public. Further, we hypothesize\nthat these dimensions may well be separate and perhaps even negatively\ncorrelated. Specifically, we hypothesize that the \u201cmaster communicator\u201d\ndimension might be separate from the \u201ccredibility\u201d construct.\nIn studies done over the last decades, scholars have tended to find that\ncredibility has as one of its dimensions a factor revolving around\n\u201cdynamism\u201d or \u201ccharisma.\u201d The work of Berlo et al. (1969) has been\ninfluential in this respect. What Berlo and his associates did was to compile\na set of semantic differentials (statements) by asking a number of people to\nname qualities that would be found in people of whom they might say\n(rather vaguely perhaps), \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for him, it\u2019s good enough for\nme.\u201d They then had a number of individuals rate a set of \u201cmessage sources\u201d\nalong these differentials and subjected the data to factor analysis. Other\nresearchers, working largely along similar lines, included a growing number\nof differentials in their studies.\nThe problem with this tendency was that it became increasingly unclear\nwhether all these differentials were actually relevant to the concept of\ncredibility, or whether the construct whose factors were being studied was a\nlarger, less coherent one. Berlo et al. chose, in the title of their paper, to use\nthe term \u201cAcceptability of Message Sources,\u201d a term which leaves some\nobscurity as to whether this is the same as \u201ccredibility\u201d or perhaps a vaguer,\nmore inclusive concept.\n255 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nAn impressive number of studies on credibility and ethos continued to\nappear in the Seventies, designed largely along the same lines: more and\nmore semantic descriptors were selected and subjected to increasingly\nsophisticated factor-analytic procedures. At the same time, however, one of\nthe originators, and perhaps the key figure, of this whole line of research,\nJ.C. McCroskey, was beginning to doubt the soundness of the direction it\nwas taking (McCroskey and Young, 1981). He felt that credibility scholars,\nincluding himself, had distorted the credibility construct by including an\never wider battery of descriptors, while still assuming that they were\ndealing with the same concept: credibility (or as McCroskey preferred to\ncall it: ethos). By doing this they confounded credibility with other source\ncharacteristics unrelated to it. Source credibility, McCroskey now found,\nwas merely a subset of a much larger construct of \u201cperson perception,\u201d and\nscholars would have done well to limit their factor analysis of it to the\noriginal Aristotelian ethos construct, with its main factors of competence\n(phronesis), moral character (arete), and good will towards the audience\n(eunoia)\u2014a formula which had proved its robustness in one empirical study\nafter the other, including McCroskey\u2019s own.\nThe present study is based on a hypothesis that heeds McCroskey\u2019s\nwarning: credibility, we hypothesize, is a quite narrow concept that is\nseparate from other important and desirable source characteristics. Among\nthese other desirable characteristics are, for example, \u201ctelegenic\u201d qualities\nenabling a person to come across well on TV, as well as such personable\nqualities which might easily allow audiences to relate to and identify with\nthat person.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we have assembled a set of scales that\nmight be involved in creating either of the overall impressions of a source\nthat we wish to analyze. Among these are a number of statements that are\ntypically used to refer to a public person's media performance. This is one\nrespect in which our study differs from the long line of pre-1980 studies, in\nwhich media performance was not a specific issue in relation to credibility.\nA further difference is that in a methodically simple but perhaps debatable\nmove, we have included our main dependent variable, credibility, in the list\nof scales. We did this in order to see how the other scales would correlate\nwith it, and whether a factor would actually emerge that might meaningfully\nbe called \u201ccredibility.\u201d\nJust as we believe that there is a tendency to confound unrelated aspects\nof source evaluation under the term \u201ccredibility,\u201d we also hypothesize that\ndifferentiation is called for in another respect: credibility, for different\n256 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\ncategories of public persons, may depend on different characteristics. This\nshould really be a rather obvious point, yet is one that was not explicitly\nmade in credibility research until Cronkhite and Liska (1976).\nIt is likely that credibility and overall source evaluation for different\npublic persons depend upon quite different characteristics of the source.\nThe present study presents an attempt to develop an instrument which can\ngive a more precise and more detailed picture of the way in which public\nspokespersons are perceived. At the same time it is an initial attempt to\nestablish data that can show how such evaluations look in an European\n(Danish) context.\nHypotheses\nTo sum up: In the present study, we want to test the following\nhypotheses.\nH1. Evaluation of public persons is made along several dimensions,\namong which credibility is one and just one.\nH2. The dimension of credibility is separate from the dimension that\nmight characterise telegenic \u201cmaster communicators.\u201d\nH3. Different public persons are evaluated differently, along\nevaluative dimensions.\nH4. In particular, credibility depends, for different public persons, on\ndifferent aspects of the overall impression made by that person.\nIn testing these hypotheses, ideally, a large number of different public\npersons should be evaluated along a large number of scales. To do so would\nrequire a questionnaire so extensive that it was feared that it would\ninfluence the response-rate and the quality of the responses.\nFor this reason, it was chosen to limit the study to five different public\npersons, with expectedly very different profiles.\nMethodology\nFor the study, a battery of statements were developed, covering items\nthat might be used meaningfully in describing public spokespersons.\nInspiration came from past studies of source effects (McCroskey et al.\n1972), from corporate image studies (Worcester 1972), and from other\nevaluative measurement instruments, such as Osgood's Attitude scales\n(Osgood, Suci and Tannenbaum 1963). After some sorting and testing, a\n257 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nbattery of 45 items was decided upon. The battery includes statements of\nthe type: \u201cis informative\u201d, \u201cis eloquent,\u201d etc.\nIn the study, five high-profile public figures were included. These were\ntwo well-known political leaders with very different political orientations:\nMr. Svend Auken (57), a leading Social Democrat, currently Minister of the\nEnvironment, and Ms. Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard (53), leader of the right-wing, anti-\nimmigration Danish People's Party; Denmark's most notable businessman,\nMr. Maersk McKinney M\u00f8ller (87), owner of the huge and successful A.P.\nM\u00f8ller group; Ms. Bodil Nyboe Andersen (60), Governor of the National\nBank; and a celebrated sports personality who has moved into politics: Mr.\nUlrik Wilbek (42), former manager of the Danish ladies\u2019 handball team,\nwhich he led to a series of international triumphs in the 90\u2019s. Each of these\npersons was rated on a five-point Likert scale for each of the 45 statements.\nRespondents were 78 students in a graduate class of Marketing and\nCommunication.\nData analysis\nSelf-rating of the respondents\u2019 awareness of the five spokespersons was\nalso included in the questionnaire. Since the respondents were graduate\nstudents in business economics, we find it surprising that Mr. M\u00f8ller and\nMs. Nyboe Andersen were judged by several to be \u201cnot very well-known.\u201d\nSvend Auken Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard M\u00e6rsk Mckinney M\u00f8ller Bodil Nyboe Andersen Ulrik Wilbek\nOthers 1 1 1 5 1\n1 11 28 3\n2 4 1 10 19 9\n3 15 9 18 12 16\n4 20 23 17 9 15\n5 25 31 16 4 23\n6 13 13 5 1 11\nTable 1: Awareness. 1-6 reflect degrees of awareness,\n6 being the highest, and 1 = do not know.\nIn the following analysis, respondents\u2019 ratings of persons they do not\nknow, or do not know very well, are excluded. Awareness and average\nscores on self-rated credibility for the five public figures are shown in Table\n1. It is obvious that considerable variation in the data exists. The two most\ncredible figures, by far, are the non-political Governor of the National Bank\n258 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nand the leading business personality, but they are also the least known.\nFactor analysis was conducted for each of the five persons. For a\ndescription of this technique, applied in the manner done here, see, e.g.,\nGreen and Tull (1978).\nIt appears that the solutions emerging here has significant similarity\nacross individuals. This we take as an indication that the dimensions along\nwhich the different public persons are evaluated are similar, even though\nthe precise evaluation of the persons may differ markedly. For this reason,\nwe decided to define the dimensions based upon a combined analysis for all\nfive public spokespersons. In this manner, the number of observations on\nwhich the analyses are based is increased from 78 to 391. The stability of\nthe solution thereby improves significantly.\nWith three factors, 47 percent of the total variance in the data is\naccounted for. Adding more variables only slightly increases the amount of\nexplained variance. As in other analyses of this kind, \u201cnoise\u201d in the raw\ndata (the ratings), combined with effects of skewness of the distribution of\nanswers for many of the items, may account for this. It is a common\nobservation that one can rarely explain more than 50-60 percent with\nfactors which each accounts for at least as much variance as one single\nquestion. In the present case, to reach this level, the inclusion of nine factors\nwould be required (64 percent explained variance). However, each of the\nlast six factors explains only a little more variance than any single question.\nFor this reason\u2014and since the three-dimensional solution lends itself easily\nto a meaningful interpretation\u2014we chose to focus on this. The solution is\nshown in table 2.\nThe first factor, accounting for more than half of the explained variance,\ncenters on credibility, which comes out with the highest loading of all\nstatements. This lends support to the notion that \u201ccredibility\u201d is indeed a\nseparate factor, and that its name is an apt one. Moreover, the loadings of\nthe other statements on this factor suggest some of the aspects that enter\ninto the perception of credibility. On average for the five public figures, to\nbe \u201cirritating\u201d (not surprisingly) detracts from credibility, whereas the\nperceptions that a person is intelligent, objective, and competent add to it.\nThese are clearly representative of the Aristotelian \u201cphronesis\u201d dimension\n(cf. Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric). Further, it is noteworthy that being able to see\nmatters from different angles and being balanced and respectful of others\u2019\nopinions are properties with high loadings. These represent a dimension that\nbear some resemblance to the Aristotelian arete and eunoia dimensions, but\n259 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nwhich may more properly be described as standing for judge-like\nqualities\u2014independence, objectivity, incorruptibility, etc.\nThe second separate dimension in the evaluation of the five persons can\nbe labelled \u201ccharisma.\u201d Public spokespersons having this characteristics are\nextrovert, entertaining, telegenic, passionate, and able to explain things in a\ndown-to-earth manner. Such people are the darlings of talk-show hosts and\ndebate moderators on TV because they come across so well on the screen.\nIt is no surprise that this is a dimension in source evaluation. The\ninteresting thing is that this dimension is separate from credibility proper.\nThis finding may explain the observation which originally instigated this\nstudy: that political and public figures high in telegenic qualities and the\nability to \u201csell tickets\u201d on the screen (to translate a favourite Danish term)\noften ranked low in credibility ratings, while precisely people like Ms.\nNyboe Andersen\u2014high in expertise, independence, and balance, but soft-\nspoken and low in media magnetism\u2014were invariably rated most credible.\nCredible 0.88\nIrritating -0.85\nProfessional 0.80\nIntelligent 0.79\nCompetent 0.78\nUnappealing -0.77\nPerson I often agree with 0.76\nRealistic 0.76\nAppealing 0.75\nCan see matters from different angles 0.72\nPleasant 0.71\nCalm 0.70\nBalanced 0.69\nStupid -0.69\nSeen to often -0.66\nSincere 0.65\nDishonest -0.64\nRespects other people's opinions 0.60\nArtificial -0.56\nEloquent 0.55 0.48\n260 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nInformative 0.54\nExciting personality 0.52\nNot able to lie 0.46\nExtrovert 0.68\nEntertaining 0.67\nStraightforward 0.59\nTV appeal 0.58\nPassionate 0.55\nBrings matters down to earth 0.54\nHas charisma 0.41 0.51\nImaginative 0.51\nGood popularizer 0.45 0.50\nLacks TV appeal -0.50\nGood at making debate 0.49\nDynamic 0.48\nSelf-confident 0.47\nDull personality -0.45\nKnowledge 0.44\nSensitive 0.62\nWarm 0.60\nUnassuming 0.41 0.53\nCapable of admitting mistakes 0.48 0.49\nIncapable of admitting mistakes -0.39 -0.47\nDoesn\u2019t respect other people's opinions -0.40 -0.43\nTable 2: Three-dimensional solution\nThe third dimension has a more emotional side to it. Important traits of\npersons scoring high on this factor are: sensitive, warm, folksy, plain, and\nable to admit mistakes. The common denominator for these perceptions\nmight be a homey, \u201cone-of-us\u201d quality.\nThree-dimensional evaluation of spokespersons\nHaving determined three dimensions along which people evaluate public\n261 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\npersons, we may try to profile the five public spokespersons individually on\nthe three dimensions. This we could do by averaging each person\u2019s scores\non the more important items belonging to each of the three factors. A more\nsensitive and elaborate procedure, however, is to compute factor scores for\neach respondent\u2019s evaluation of each public person on each of the three\ndimensions. The average factor score for each dimension then represents\nthe degree to which each of the three public persons is associated with that\ndimension. These scores are shown in table 3:\nFactor I Factor II Factor III\nSvend Auken -0,24 -0,24 0,29\nPia Kj\u00e6rsgaard -0,91 0,43 -0,51\nM\u00e6rsk McKinney M\u00f8ller 0,70 -0,19 -0,54\nBodil Nyboe Andersen 0,52 -0,50 0,00\nUlrik Wilbek -0,07 0,51 0,77\nTable 3: Average factor scores on each dimension for each person\nIt is evident that the way in which the five spokespersons are regarded is\nvery different. M\u00e6rsk McKinney M\u00f8ller is most credible, but he scores less\nwell on the other factors. Least credible is Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard. However, along\nwith sports celebrity Ulrik Wilbek, the right-wing party leader scores\nhighest on charisma. This dimension is one that the low-key National Bank\nGovernor, Bodil Nyboe Andersen, completely lacks. On the other hand, she\nis the only one to come anywhere near M\u00f8ller on credibility. On the\nemotional \u201cone-of-us\u201d dimension, Auken and especially Wilbek stand out.\nThe nature of credibility\nThe way the five spokespersons achieve such credibility as they have\nvaries significantly. At one end of the scale, we find Nyboe Andersen, at the\nother end Kj\u00e6rsgaard (Table 3). But as we shall see, what explains the\ndegree of credibility that each of the five persons has varies much between\nthem.\nThe overall nature of credibility can be inferred from the statements that\nload high on the credibility dimension in the analysis shown in Table 2. It\nis, however, possible to analyse credibility in a slightly different way as\nwell. By using the credibility score as a dependent variable in a correlation\n262 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nanalysis, and using answers to the 45 statements as independent variables, it\nis possible to single out exactly what constitutes credibility for each\nspokesperson. To achieve this, a regression analysis for each of the five\npersons was carried out. Here the amount of explained variance in the\ncredibility score varies from 85 to 99 percent.\nFrom this analysis, it is obvious that credibility for the different\nspokespersons has to do with different perceived qualities in them. Findings\nare shown in table 4. Only few statements correlate significantly with\ncredibility for more than one of the five spokespersons\nClearly, each of these public figures has a different \u201ccredibility profile\u201d;\ncredibility has a somewhat different meaning depending on whose\ncredibility we are talking about. The perceived credibility of Svend Auken,\nthe Minister of Energy and the Environment, seems to have to do with his\nbeing realistic, respectful of the opinions of others, and informative, but not\nwith any willingness to admit mistakes nor\u2014surprisingly perhaps\u2014with his\nbeing eloquent or extrovert. Many people would probably agree that Auken\nhas these qualities; it seems, then, that there might be a tendency for his\neloquence and extroversion to strike people as \u201ctoo much,\u201d detracting from\nhis credibility. For Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, the right-wing, anti-immigrant party\nleader, the most significant findings are that those who find her credible\nalso perceive her as disrepectful of the opinions of others, and that they do\nnot see her as warm; they do not agree that she is unable to admit mistakes\n(but, somewhat contradictorily, will not go so far as to agree that she is able\nto admit them). For Mr M\u00e6rsk M\u00f8ller, the business tycoon, those who find\nhim credible tend to find him intelligent, pleasant, and objective, while they\nreject the notion that he is dishonest. National Bank Governor Bodil Nyboe\nAndersen is seen as credible by people who see her as calm, competent,\npleasant, and, perhaps surprisingly, entertaining; they feel that she is not\ndishonest, nor is she warm or someone they often agree with. For Ulrik\nWilbek, the celebrated sports personality, credibility seems to depend on his\nbeing seen as straightforward, calm, and unable to lie; those who see him as\ncredible do not feel that he is telegenic or charismatic, nor that he is stupid.\n263 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nRegression Analysis Unstandardized Standardized t Sig.\nCoefficients Coefficients\nBStd.

Here, it has been proposed to work\nwith a three-dimensional analysis: credibility, charisma, and \u201cone-of-us\u201d\nemotional appeal. This analysis supports our hypotheses 1 and 2: credibility\nis just one factor in the evaluation of a public communicator; and more\nspecifically, credibility is separate from other qualities that public\ncommunicators may also wish to possess, such as a) charisma and b) \u201cone-\nof-us\u201d emotional appeal. To be even more specific: the much vaunted\ncharismatic, \u201cmaster communicator\u201d quality that politicians and other\npublic figures are often said to need in order to \u201ccome across\u201d on TV is not\nthe same thing as credibility.\nTo say this is not tantamount to saying that credible \u201cmaster\ncommunicators\u201d do not exist, or that the \u201cmastery\u201d they possess is not a\nvaluable and important one. That claim would fly in the face of facts, e.g.,\nthe case of Ms. Kj\u00e6rsgaard, who is undoubtedly, in some way, a master\ncommunicator with charismatic traits. Such a figure is clearly effective and\npersuasive in terms of building popular support. That raises the intriguing\nquestion of what the different kinds of persuasiveness or effectiveness are\nthat we find in communicators who are strong on each of our three\ndimensions: credibility, charisma, and \u201cone-of-us\u201d appeal, respectively. The\npresent study gives us no basis for theorizing on that. However, the question\ncalls to mind a perspective raised by an empirical study of persuasion in\nwhich one of the authors was involved (J\u00f8rgensen, Kock and R\u00f8rbech 1994;\n1998; this volume, Chapter 12). In that study, it became clear that we may\ndistinguish between two different kinds of persuasive effectiveness, each\ncorresponding to a separate persuasive strategy. These are vote-shifting and\nvote-gathering, respectively. Vote-shifting is the ability to win over votes\nfrom the opposite side. Vote-gathering is the ability to mobilize latent\nfollowers from the \u201cundecided\u201d group and to galvanize the enthusiasm of\nfollowers already mobilized. The typical vote-shifter, it turns out, is very\nreminiscent of the typical \u201ccredible\u201d person of the present study; the typical\nvote-gatherer has most of the qualities that constitute our \u201ccharisma\u201d factor.\nIn fact, a public debate featuring Ms. Kj\u00e6rsgaard was a key case in the\nearlier study, and it turned out then that in persuasive strategy as well as in\nmeasurable persuasive effect she was perhaps the most typical vote-gatherer\nof all debaters studied (out of 74).\nWe began with a reference to the case of Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister,\nPoul Nyrup Rasmussen. Looking back, we may now state that although in\n265 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nmany people\u2019s estimate he has neither credibility nor charisma, this should\nnot lead anyone to think that the two dimensions are the same. They are\nidentifiable and separate dimensions in the evaluation of public\ncommunicators.\nHowever, when that is said, it also seems likely that these dimensions\ninvolve somewhat different qualities for different communicators. For\nexample, our everyday judgement of the credibility of different\ncommunicators relies upon different traits. This lends support to our\nhypotheses 3 and 4. When we look for reasons why this should be so, it is\nnatural to point to the fact that these five figures belong to very different\nspheres. First, we may assume that respondents have not rated their\ncredibility in abstracto, but on the assumption that they should be seen as\ncommunicating within the particular sphere in which they are active. When\nMr. M\u00f8ller communicates to the public at all (a rare event), he talks about\nbusiness and how various policies will affect it, not about sports. So the\ncredibility ratings he achieves refer to what he says within that sphere.\nSecondly, it is natural to assume that the qualities which make Mr. M\u00f8ller\ncredible on business matters are different from those which make Mr.\nWilbek credible on (certain) sports. Our readers may explore our tables for\nthemselves to look for qualities that may be constitutive of credibility in\npolitics, business, sports, etc., respectively. Suffice it here to conclude that\ndifferences in what makes for credibility in people from different life\nspheres are to be expected and have indeed emerged, yet the more\ninteresting fact is perhaps that in spite of these differences there is a relation\nand an overlap between the credibility profiles of these very different\nfigures\u2014enough to allow us to conclude that credibility is an identifiable\nand separate construct, as are the other two factors in our analysis.\nBased upon the present study, it would be possible to devise a\nmeaningful instrument of manageable size for the profiling of\nspokespersons along the three dimensions suggested here. To estimate\nsomeone's credibility, one would concentrate on those items in the analysis\nthat contribute strongly to the credibility of at least one of the\nspokespersons. With regard to the second and third dimension, it would be\nadvisable to work with at least three statements for each, providing a total\nbattery of 16-20 statements, to be used for each person to be evaluated.\nREFERENCES\n266 Evaluation of Public Spokespersons\nAndersen, K., and T.

Along the way, some current theories of democracy and the\nroles of rhetoric and argumentation in it are invoked as either supports or\ntargets.\nIn Western democracies, political debate is\u2014fortunately\u2014intense.\nEspecially when an election is drawing near, hopeful candidates as well as\nincumbents find themselves busy with pronouncements, signals and\nbranding. Attack and counter-attack fly back and forth. Moreover, there is\nvigorous debate between opinion leaders who aren\u2019t politicians themselves.\nUnlike politicians, they are not running for office, but like politicians they\nseek acceptance of their positions from citizens and voters.\nParticularly in regard to what politicians say and do the media delivers\ncommentary and evaluations. This often takes the form of judgments of\nwhat strategic intentions may have motivated a given pronouncement, and\nwhether its actual effects are likely to be desirable from the strategic point\nof view of the politician who made it, or his or her party or block. In other\nwords, these assessments concern how well this politician is doing from his\nor her own perspective. Will a given move win votes? Which voter\nsegments or factions will like it? Is it clever?\nBelow, a different perspective will be taken. It, too, serves to render a\nqualitative assessment of public debate\u2014but from the point of view of\ncitizens.\nWhile the media\u2019s political commentators tend to pontificate\u2014often as\nself-appointed authorities, without supporting reasons\u2014on whether and\nhow the politicians\u2019 contributions to the debate benefit the politicians\nthemselves, the question in this essay will be whether the politicians\u2019 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\ncontributions to the debate are of any use to citizens; that is to say, whether\nthey deliver what citizens need.\nAccording to a widespread view, politicians themselves are exclusively\nor primarily driven by a need to strengthen or consolidate their power\npositions by pleasing other persons of power and, most of all, by pleasing\nthe voters. But citizens\u2013voters\u2014what do they need? What should political\ndebates deliver in order to meet their needs? And do they get it?\nEven if we assume that all politicians aim merely to strengthen their\npower positions as much as possible, as political pundits tend to assume\n(but this is a very questionable theory), then that is not likely to give\ncitizens what they need. In fact it is impossible for the simple reason that all\nthe competing politicians cannot strengthen their positions at the same time.\nWhat Norms Should Count?\nIf one aims to make qualitative evaluations of political debates from\ncitizens\u2019 point of view, then one must have a set of norms on the basis of\nwhich this can be done. That is, norms that deal with what citizens, not\npoliticians, actually need.\nThink about the public debate that takes place in a Parliament or in\nCongress. It probably has to be there according to the Constitution or\ntradition. But why do citizens need it? What good does it do? What good\ncould it do? What is its purpose?\nOne would think that a Constitution, for example, would say something\nabout these questions; or perhaps other rules or statutes or treatises of\nconstitutional law. But, on the whole, this is not the case.\nThat one can, from the citizens\u2019 side, formulate requirements and norms\nfor political debates\u2014norms that reflect citizens\u2019 needs and not just the\nstrategic interests of politicians\u2014is nevertheless a perspective that is slowly\ngaining validity, even in the media. One can see this in the way several\nwebsites, TV/radio stations and newspapers have begun fact-checking\nclaims that politicians put forward, especially during election campaigns.\nWe must go further down this road. Indeed, politicians\u2019 arguments\nshould not distort or misrepresent facts\u2014but that is just one of the norms in\npolitical debate that reflect what citizens need (and do not need). There are\nother needs we should also wish to see fulfilled if a debate is to be useful.\nThe main thesis here is simply that we citizens should be able to use\npublic political debate as a basis for making decisions. It is, for example,\n269 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nfor this reason that we should demand that we are neither lied to nor given\nmisleading representations of facts that leave out important information and\nthereby lead us to believe things that aren\u2019t so. As citizens we need debates\nthat help us acquire a view of reality that is, as they say in the auditing\nprofession, \u201ctrue and fair.\u201d More generally, debates fulfilling this and other\nquality standards are needed in order for us to judge who we think has the\nbest approach to the political problems and what should be done about\nthem. Based on such a judgment we can each take a position on who\ndeserves to be elected. And between elections we can influence our\npoliticians by communicating with them or letting our voices be heard in\nthe political debate in other ways.\nIf this is citizens\u2019 primary purpose in hearing (and reading) political\ndebate, then our first and most elementary requirement as citizens, all things\nconsidered, is that we deserve debates containing arguments\u2014that is,\nreasons why given policies under consideration are right or wrong.\nThis is not the only purpose we citizens can have in attending to debate.\nDebate can also be entertaining, suspenseful, exciting. We may sometimes\nwithdraw to a position as mere observers and wonder \u201cwho loses and who\nwins, who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out,\u201d as Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear said to his good\nand virtuous daughter, Cordelia. Who is the frontrunner? Who makes\noutrageous claims? Who makes gaffes? Who is in a tight spot? There can be\na particular satisfaction in following a debate where the side one roots for\ndoes well while the others embarrass themselves.\nAnother important purpose in having debates, such as those held in a\nCongress or Parliament, is that by learning elected politicians\u2019 public\nreasons for their decisions, we can afterwards hold them accountable for\nthose decisions. We can say, for example, \u201cYou supported this because you\nthought it would bring such and such a benefit\u2014but now look what has\nhappened.\u201d\nBut the primary purpose must still be a forward-looking one: we need\ndebates so that we can each take a position on what should be done\u2014before\nit is done. What are the exigencies, problems and challenges we face? What\ncan be done? What proposals are there? What will be best? There are issues\nenough: economic crises, taxes, unemployment, health care, schools, the\nenvironment, immigration, the climate, terrorism, military involvements ...\nTaking positions on such issues may help us take positions on whom to vote\nfor. And our votes are not our only means of influence. Politicians can be\ninfluenced by opinion polls, by debate pieces in newspapers and on blogs,\nand by direct contact via, for example, e-mail or the social media.\n270 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nWe need debates to provide us with input we can use to take stands on\nall the issues facing our society, and to decide, on that basis, whom to vote\nfor. Perhaps we even want to interfere in ongoing debates and raise our\nvoices ourselves. This input that we need for all this consists of several\nthings. There should be alternative proposals or policies for our\nconsideration. These policies should be supported with arguments20, and\nthose arguments should be good ones, which means, among other things,\nthat they should not be untruthful, deceptive or misleading. In addition,\ndebates should offer counterarguments and criticisms of proposed policies\nand their supporting arguments, and all these too must meet certain critical\nstandards. And finally, debates should provide good answers to\ncounterarguments and criticisms, for it is only by hearing opposing\narguments and the respective answers to them that we are really in a\nposition to evaluate them.\nBut all this, which we as citizens need and require from political debates,\nis something we aren\u2019t getting in any satisfactory measure. We get\npersonality contests, performance, spin, slogans, talking points, one-liners,\nand we get mutual accusations and mudslinging. All these things are what\npolitical analysts, commentators and \u201cpundits\u201d like to analyze and applaud\nor disparage in their commentaries, where they pontificate on \u201cwho loses\nand who wins, who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out\u201d; and sometimes, when these analysts\nare hired as communication consultants, as they often are, this is also what\nthey teach politicians to be good at. As a result, we often know little more\nabout a candidate we have voted for than a slogan, a few one-liners, a party\naffiliation and how he or she looks on a lot of identical posters.\nCommunication consultants know that superficial and casual impressions\nand expressions are often the only input that many voters manage to receive\nbefore an election. True enough, more and more media compete for our\nlimited time. The result is that \u201cso much political rhetoric today looks more\nlike advertising than like deliberative argument,\u201d as political theorist Bryan\nGarsten has noted (2011, p. 160).\nThere is nothing wrong in itself with one-liners, slogans, TV\ncommercials and snappy advertisements on buses. It is in order, after all,\n20 The expression \u201can argument\u201d will be used as synonomous with \u201ca reason,\u201d i.e., a\nstatement that is seen as given in support of some conclusion (a proposition or proposal).\nThus, \u201can argument\u201d is not used in the sense often heard of \u201can exchange between\ndisagreeing people.\u201d Nor is it used in the sense often found in scholarship of \u201ca constellation\nof reasons and the conclusion they support.\u201d When something like that is meant, the term\n\u201cargumentation\u201d will typically be used.\n271 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nthat there are short, to-the-point messages; and color on a campaign poster\nis better than if all is black, white and grey. But things have gone wrong if\nwe get all this instead of proper debates with arguments that can help us\nfind our positions.\nAnd such arguments we are hard pressed to find. The fact that\ncommercials, one-liners, etc., play a big role is not the main focus here.\nRather, the concern is with much of what is put forward as being proper\ndebate with usable argumentation in it\u2014because usually it isn\u2019t.\nTo be sure, there is a great deal of debate. But, first, much of the debate\nis marked by the fact that it contains no real arguments; instead a range of\ntechniques are used to get us to buy policies and assumptions that are not\nbacked by arguments (many of these techniques are the ones known from\nadvertising). Second, many of the arguments (and counterarguments) that\nwe do get are bad ones. And third, the answers that should be given to the\ncounterarguments and criticisms are often of miserable quality, or they\naren\u2019t there at all.\nThis is why we need to evaluate the quality of public debate from the\npoint of view of the citizen\u2019s needs. Citizens should think of themselves as\ncritical consumers of debate. We should hold public and political debaters\nresponsible for giving us input that serves our needs as citizens. The\nimportant question about political communication is not how well it serves\npoliticians\u2019 purposes. We are consumers of debate because we need debate;\nbut we should also be critical monitors of what we get. We should learn to\ndetect and identify the typical shortcomings and tricks in political\ncommunication by which we citizens get shortchanged.\nA covering term for these tricks and shortcomings that tend to make\nmuch political communication useless or even stultifying could be vices.\nBelow I try to sketch the principal criteria that we, as critical consumers,\nmight apply to the political communication we get; that will enable us to\ndefine the principal types of vices that occur when these criteria are\ndisobeyed. These vices can be placed under the three main categories I have\nindicated: no arguments\u2014poor arguments\u2014poor answers to arguments.\nWhat we have a shortage of in our public sphere is not talk about\nproblems, it is not debate, nor is it proposals for solutions; what has been\nlacking is rather real elucidation of the problems and of the proposed\nsolutions in the form of good argumentation.\nWe need to specify what that is. One cannot begin to criticize someone\nor something without making clear on what basis one is doing it\u2014that is to\n272 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nsay, without identifying and motivating the criteria for evaluation that one\nclaims are not being met.\nBut Can Voters Be Bothered with Argumentation?\nA critical question might be raised in response to what I have said so far:\nare citizens and voters really interested in argumentation? Don\u2019t they\nalready know what they want, and don\u2019t they just expect politicians to give\nit to them? And in that case, what would they need argumentation for?\nThat the individual voter merely wants particular policies, period, and is\ntherefore not much interested in argumentation is a widespread assumption\nthat is firmly held by many political scientists, but also by politicians\nthemselves and political journalists. Arguably, a majority of political\nreporting and analysis in the media is based on the understanding that the\nelectorate is composed of certain \u201csegments,\u201d all of which have given\ninterests at heart, and to have those interests satisfied is what they care\nabout; so all a politician can do to win voters\u2019 support is simply to make\nthem think that he or she gives them what they want\u2014not to try to change\ntheir views on issues or policies by means of argumentation.\nAn important political initiative in the United States springing from this\nnotion was the so-called \u201cContract with America,\u201d a document written by\nConservative politicians before the mid-term Congressional election in\n1994, in which they set out very specifically a long series of promises that\nthe Republican party were to enact if they were to gain a majority in the\nelection. It was signed by all but two of the party\u2019s members of the House\nof Representatives and all its non-incumbent candidates. In the election the\nRepublicans gained 54 seats in the House and 9 seats in the Senate and won\na majority in both houses. This set a trend in the US, and in other countries\nas well, that has sometimes been referred to as \u201ccontract politics.\u201d It is a\nway of political thinking according to which voters know what they want,\nso that the role of politicians is to say, \u201cWe promise to give you what you\nwant, and in return you vote for us.\u201d\nIt is also a way of thinking where argumentation plays a very small role.\nThere is, on this view, no need for it, precisely because voters are already\nsupposed to know what they want, and what could change that? Politicians\u2019\nhands, on this view, are tied by the promises that get them elected: if they\nmake good on those, they may be reelected, and if they don\u2019t, they can be\nthrown out in the next election.\n273 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nIt is clear that when such a view of politics dominates, politicians see no\nreason to present much in the way of argumentation for what they intend to\ndo, or to answer counterarguments. More nearly the opposite is true:\ncounterarguments and critical considerations should simply be passed over\nand ignored, because even mentioning them, let alone answering them,\nwould just give them attention and media coverage that one doesn\u2019t want\nthem to get. And certainly if one considers one\u2019s policies to be fixed by a\n\u201ccontract\u201d with the voters, and if voters are not likely to be swayed by\narguments, one need not argue for those policies. Instead, one is simply\nbound to do what the contract says. To even enter a debate or argument\nabout one of them can be interpreted as if there is doubt about it. For that\nreason \u201ccontract\u201d politicians tend to discourage such debates.\nSo, even though it is an advantage of \u201ccontract politics\u201d that politicians\nare obligated to say in advance what they intend to do, and also to some\nextent to stand by what they have said, a problematic side of contract\npolitics is that it tends to suspend or sideline open debate and\nargumentation. That is precisely because it is based on the presumption that\neach individual voter wants something quite definite that is not debatable\u2014\nand that debate therefore cannot affect or change what voters want. In other\nwords, here again we have the underlying notion that voters have fixed,\ngiven positions (\u201cpreferences\u201d is the term often used by political\nscientists)\u2014so they will not let themselves be moved by arguments.\nThis way of looking at things not only lies beneath contract politics, it\nalso, as pointed out a moment ago, lies beneath a great deal of political\ndebate and journalism. And it is reinforced by some of the prevalent\ntendencies in political science\u2014a discipline in which increasing numbers of\npoliticians, journalists, commentators and administrators are schooled.\nDemocracy as Cutting up the Cake\nA connected and deeply entrenched view in political science is that\npolitics is purely and simply the fight over the distribution of society\u2019s\ngoods. Democracy, on this view, means that goods and influence in a\nsociety are distributed among social segments in proportion to their relative\nstrength. On this view, the citizens of a society only care about their own\nwishes in the distribution process; to them politics is to promote their own\nand their segment\u2019s interests. Everyone, by this interpretation, is a \u201cutility\n274 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nmaximizer\u201d\u2014to borrow a phrase from classic economic theory, which\nassumes that individuals are (primarily) driven by one motive: getting the\nmaximum value (\u201cutility\u201d) out of all the choices they make. Democracy is\nlikewise seen as a system in which everyone\u2019s concern is to maximally\nsatisfy his or her preferences\u2014and in principle the preferences of all\nindividuals are then channeled (\u201caggregated\u201d) into an authoritative decision\nprocedure; that procedure is how democracy works.\nA problem in this connection that is of concern to many political\nscientists aligned with what they call \u201cSocial Choice Theory\u201d is that in\nprinciple no system seems to exist that can accurately and unambiguously\ntransform the aggregate preferences of all citizens into policies; depending\non which voting procedure is used, various contradictory policies may\nresult from the same set of voter preferences, and politicians have ample\nopportunities for manipulating what happens in this process. In other words,\neven in systems where citizens have the right to vote as they wish,\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d in the sense that the state is ruled by the will of the people\ndoes not really exist, because the notion \u201cthe will of the people\u201d has no\nclear and unambiguous meaning. The work of the political scientist William\nRiker has been very influential in stating this view (see, e.g., Riker 1982).\nBut perhaps the dominant mode of thinking in political science is that\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d is a notion that does have a clear meaning: it means that\ncitizens get their preferences satisfied and are allotted their proportionate\nshare of society\u2019s goods according to their strength. Democracy is cutting\nup the cake of society between competing groups that all want the biggest\npossible slice. The Canadian political scientist David Easton (1917-2014)\nproposed a general theory of political \u201csystems\u201d that has been widely\nadopted to the degree of being considered the basic doctrine for a whole\ngeneration of political scientists. It includes, among other things, a famous\ndefinition of politics as the \u201cauthoritative allocation of values for a society\u201d\n(1965, p. 50). In this lies also the idea that we citizens are basically seen as\nconsumers who are always trying to get the political system to apportion us\nvalues\u2014and the system tries to give us what we want because then we will\nsupport it and thereby secure its continuation. Easton\u2019s \u201csystems\u201d model\nhas for decades been a staple in what we might call \u201cPolitical Science 101.\u201d\nAnother leading political scientist, Anthony Downs, whose theories have\nlong been part of academic curricula, says it as follows: \u201cBecause the\ncitizens of our model democracy are rational, each of them views elections\nstrictly as a means of selecting the government most beneficial to him\u201d\n275 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\n(1957, p. 138\u2014an article that political scientists have cited thousands of\ntimes).\nBut if people think only of maximally fulfilling their self-interest, then\ntheir political attitudes will depend only on what they think will benefit\nthem most, as viewed from their position in the social structure, and\u2014\naccording to this line of thinking\u2014they tend to know this already and be\nfirmly convinced of it; in which case they will not set much store by any\narguments they hear, or feel much need for arguments in the first place. For\nexample, pensioners will want their public pensions to at least stay the\nsame, or, better, to be increased; they will want more money for home-care,\nand probably less for education. In short, people from a particular segment\nof society want to have precisely this and that. And a lot of debating won\u2019t\nchange what they want. This is how a dominant way of thinking goes.\nA Less Simplistic Picture\nBut it is, in the first place, a simplistic and false idea that people seek\nonly their own \u201cmaximum utility.\u201d One might get the impression that\nscholars in the emergent field of Political Science seized on theories by\nthinkers like Easton and Downs because they offered views of the political\nworld as beautifully clear and rule-governed as the view of the universe\noffered by Newton\u2019s laws. It is a fact that theories that inject this kind of\nbeautiful mathematical simplicity in a murky and complicated field exert a\ntremendous attraction to some scholars. Interestingly, Adam Smith, the\nfather of another beautifully simple theory, classical economics, was also a\nrhetorician, and he was very aware of this effect (we might call it the\n\u201cNewton effect\u201d). He defined the Newtonian method as follows: \u201cwe may\nlay down certain principles, primary, or proved, in the beginning, from\nwhence we account for the several phenomena, connecting all together by\nthe same chain\u201d (1971, p.140)\u2014and he added: \u201cIt gives us pleasure to see\nthe phenomena which we reckoned the most unaccountable, all deduced\nfrom some principle.\u201d So, if this is right, we may assume that theories like\nEaston\u2019s or Downs\u2019s reduction of politics to one grand, materialist principle\nhave gained acceptance partly because their quasi-mathematical simplicity\nprovides pleasure to people with a certain mindset.\nBut the fact that these theories are wrong in their seductive simplicity\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they are all wrong. Most people probably do think about\ntheir self-interest and their wallets a lot of the time, such as when they\nconsider whom to vote for. But most voters also think about a wider range\n276 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nof issues than their personal economy. Other values than economic ones do\ninfluence the positions they take on concrete issues. It is not for nothing that\nin the last few years there has been considerable talk about \u201cvalue politics,\u201d\nfor it reflects precisely the view that politics is about much more than\neconomy: citizens believe in certain values that they want legislation and\nother public action to reflect, so, for one thing, citizens\u2019 \u201cpreferences\u201d are\nnot exclusively determined by what benefits them most economically. Also,\nresearch shows that voters do not choose a standpoint on policy solely with\na view to what they think will best serve their special interests and\npreferences, but also to a significant degree with a view to what they think\nis best for the community.\nIn the second place, the assumption that people\u2019s standpoints on all sorts\nof concrete issues are fixed it also a simplistic and mistaken idea. Many\npeople in many social segments (to use the accepted terminology) actually\nchange or modify their standpoints after they have heard arguments.\nGranted, it is no doubt true that most of us have rather fixed attitudes on\nseveral issues; but no one has fixed views on every issue. For one thing, for\nmost people there are many issues on which they have no views at all. They\nmay not even know that an issue exists until a pollster asks them to state\ntheir opinion on it. Or they will have views on it that are very superficially\ninformed, undecided and volatile. Many people will tell the pollster that\nthey support one or the other of the views he presents to them, but only\nbecause they feel they have to choose something and may not want to\nappear stupid. The pollster will then put them down as having taken a stand,\nand only those who didn\u2019t choose any of the suggested options will be put\ndown as \u201cundecided.\u201d If, for example, a referendum is upcoming (as in\nBritain on EU membership in the summer of 2016), those who have told the\npollster what option they support will be put down as having taken a stand,\nand only the rest will be referred to in the media as those who have not yet\ndecided. But the truth in such situations is that a large proportion of those\nwho have declared a stand in a poll are also undecided; they may well\nchange sides before the voting day, perhaps several times. Unfortunately the\nway the media, and pollsters themselves, tend to refer to opinion polls does\nnot reflect this. But the fact remains that even on issues where an individual\nmight have a rather firm view it is still possible\u2014and often seen in\npractice\u2014that this individual changes that view after having some\nexperience, or hearing some argument. All this goes to show that citizens\ncan be affected by argumentation\u2014and, by the same token, that they need\nargumentation.\n277 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nWhat Is Good Argumentation?\nIf it is assumed that citizens do need to hear arguments on political\nissues, then the question arises as to what sort of arguments. As already\nsaid, often those arguments that are in fact used in political debates, if any\nare used at all, are, unfortunately, bad ones. But what does that mean?\nWhen are arguments bad, when are they good?\nA starting point in regard to this is the observation that there are often\ngood arguments both for and against a particular decision or policy.\nFrom this it follows, among other things, that \u201cgood\u201d arguments are not\nthe same as what philosophical logic calls \u201cvalid\u201d arguments; it is necessary\nto say this because a good number of textbooks in argumentation and logic\nstill build on this concept.\nIn logic the meaning of a \u201cvalid\u201d argument is an argument that entails\nthe conclusion it supports. This amounts to saying that if the argument is\ntrue, then it follows necessarily and automatically that the conclusion is\nalso true. One authoritative formulation of this understanding of \u201cvalid\u201d is\nthis: \u201cFor a valid argument, it is not possible for the premises to be true with\nthe conclusion false. That is, necessarily if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\u201d (This is from the article \u201cArgument\u201d in The Internet\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy.) This kind of argumentation is best known\nfrom geometry and other branches of mathematics. For example, if a is\nlonger than b, and b is longer than c, then it follows necessarily that a is\nlonger than c; or if is true that a given triangle is right-angled, then it\nfollows necessarily that the square on its long side equals the sum of the\nsquares on the two shorter sides. This insight is called the Pythagoras\ntheorem; proofs that demonstrate its truth were known centuries before\nChrist.\nLogic textbooks tend to equate a good argument with a valid argument,\nand they like to show examples of bad arguments like this one: \u201cAll birds\nlay eggs; this animal lays eggs; so this is a bird.\u201d This is of course an\ninvalid argument, and every schoolchild probably knows that. It is clearly\nimportant that when someone in a political debate claims that the policy or\nclaim he advances follows necessarily from argumentation like this\u2014and\nthat does happen\u2014then that kind of argumentation should be exposed as\nfalse. Invalid arguments should not be allowed to pass as valid.\nBut using \u201cvalidity\u201d as a yardstick in political argumentation is a\nproblem if it is our only yardstick. The problem is that in politics a lot of the\n278 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nrelevant arguments that we would all agree are \u201cgood\u201d in some sense are\nnot valid\u2014the conclusion they argue for does not follow necessarily.\nTake for example this argument that has been used a great deal in the\ndebate about Britain\u2019s membership of the EU: \u201cIf Britain leaves the EU,\nthen it has more freedom to pass its own laws.\u201d This is surely true, and one\ncannot deny that it is a relevant argument. Surely for a country to have more\nfreedom to pass its own laws is, taken in itself, a good thing\u2014no one would\ncall it a bad thing or an irrelevant thing. So as an argument for leaving the\nEU it surely is relevant and has some weight. However, the conclusion it\nargues for\u2014that Britain should leave the EU\u2014does not follow necessarily\nfrom it. And why not? Because there are many other considerations that are\nrelevant in regard to the issue. For example, what will happen to Britain\u2019s\nforeign trade if it leaves the EU\u2014and to its economy generally?\nPractical vs. Epistemic Argumentation\nThe issue of whether Britain should be a member of the EU or not is an\nexample of what is sometimes called a practical issue: it is about what to\ndo. The issue of whether a given animal is a bird is different; it is an\nexample of what is sometimes called an epistemic issue: it is about what is\ntrue. To put a crucial difference between practical and epistemic issues in a\nsimple way we can say that an epistemic issue is one-dimensional: it\nconcerns one dimension only, namely this: what is the truth. Here the\nvalidity yardstick helps us a long part of the way. That is also the reason\nwhy in logic textbooks the examples used to illustrate good and bad\nargumentation are nearly all drawn from the epistemic realm\u2014they are\nmainly or exclusively issues about what is true, not about what to do.\nPractical issues, on the other hand, are multi-dimensional: for example, in\nthe case of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU there is a dimension that has to\ndo with national independence, but there is also the economic dimension;\nand there are many more. This, essentially, is the reason why, on political\nissues (and other practical issues), we cannot expect that arguments should\nbe \u201cvalid\u201d in the sense that their conclusion follows necessarily from them.\nThey can be good without being valid; in fact it is arguable that arguments\non practical issues can never be valid in the strict logical sense. However,\nthey can still be good\u2014and they can certainly also be bad.\nTo sum up: in regard to political argumentation (and practical\nargumentation generally) we cannot use the logicians\u2019 \u201cvalidity\u201d yardstick\nas our only normative evaluation tool. It is not for that reason superfluous,\n279 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nthough. In politics we can, among other things, use the logical measuring\nstick to expose and criticize people if they try to fool us into thinking that\ntheir political views follow as necessary conclusions from their arguments.\nConclusions do this extremely rarely where politics are concerned. Even\nthough there may be good arguments for something\u2014for example, in\nBritain\u2019s case, for either leaving the EU or staying in it\u2014then there are, as a\nrule, also good arguments for the opposite view. Therefore, on the whole,\nthat something or other is to be done is arguably never a \u201clogical\u201d (that is to\nsay, necessary) consequence of there being good arguments for it. And for\nthat reason we cannot criticize debaters for not bringing forward arguments\nwhich logically entail that we must agree with their policies; we can, on the\nother hand, criticize them if they try to make us believe that they have such\narguments.\nThis brings us back to the initial point made a while ago: in politics there\nare typically both good arguments for a course of action\u2014and good\narguments against it. One cannot conclude that we must undertake a certain\naction\u2014nor that we must refrain from doing it. This kind of situation is an\neveryday experience both in our daily lives and in politics, but validity-\nbased logic cannot really account for it; according to it, there cannot be\n\u201cvalid\u201d arguments on both sides, since two opposite courses of action\ncannot both follow by necessity from the arguments brought forward.\nAdded to this is the fact that in relation to every problem one would like\nto do something about, there are not only several arguments both for and\nagainst any proposed action, but also there are often several alternative\npossible actions. And even if one of them can be said to be good, this does\nnot exclude the possibility that another alternative action is even better.\nWhat Citizens Need from Debates\nFor this reason the matter of judging what is a good argument in politics\n(and in practical argumentation generally) is much more complicated than\nin the logical world. Among other things, what we need as citizens (and\nvoters) in relation to political debates is two things:\nThe first thing: we need to hear the arguments on both sides of a given\nissue\u2014pro and con.\n(In fact we need to know the good arguments for all the different,\nalternative actions. But it is simpler to say that we need to hear the\narguments both for and against every policy or action.)\n280 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nThe second thing: we need to weigh the arguments on the two sides.\n(Remember that the term \u201cweight\u201d popped up a while ago in relation to the\nargument for Britain\u2019s leaving the EU that this will give Britons more\nfreedom to pass their own laws. By contrast, no one would say that one of\nthe steps in the proof of the Pythagoras theorem has a certain \u201cweight.\u201d)\nAs a general rule, no argument or set of arguments arguing for a certain\naction may entail the necessity to undertake that action. So we must\n\u201cweigh.\u201d And our most important help in weighing is that those who defend\na particular policy must answer the arguments on the other side.\nNow back to the initial question, whose complications we have just tried\nto disentangle: if we cannot use \u201cvalidity\u201d as our sole yardstick, how do we\njudge whether an argument in a political debate, for example, is a good\none?\nThe answer to be given here relies mainly on work within the\nphilosophical school that calls itself \u201cInformal Logic,\u201d in particular work by\nthe philosopher Trudy Govier. Not everything in this chapter aligns\ncompletely with Govier and the other Informal Logicians, in particular not\nthe rather essential distinction advanced above between epistemic and\npractical argumentation, but an important point of agreement is that it is\nuseful to consider the following three dimensions of what a good argument\nis. Here they will be designated as follows:\n1. Accurate\n2. Relevant\n3. Weighty\nAccurate\u2014it means, in simple terms, that one can answer Yes to the\nquestion, \u201cIs that so?\u201d\nWhy not just say that any arguments used should be true? The answer is\nthat the word \u201ctrue\u201d says at the same time too much and too little. It is \u201ctoo\nmuch\u201d in the sense that the concept of truth in itself is one whose meaning\nphilosophers have never stopped arguing about. It is better to avoid getting\nentangled in a philosophical quarrel about what it means that something is\n\u201ctrue.\u201d An eminent contemporary philosopher, Donald Davidson (1996),\nhas written an article titled \u201cThe Folly of Trying to Define Truth.\u201d Most\npeople, on the other hand, have a commonsense notion of what it means to\nsay something that isn\u2019t so. Aristotle said: \u201cTo say of that which is that it is\nand of that which is not that it is not is true\" (Metaphysics 1011b). What\nsomeone says about reality must not mislead others about reality so that\nthey do stupid things, such as walking off a cliff that they have been told\n281 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nwasn\u2019t there. We need statements about the world that we may reliably act\nupon; if that is the case, then they do not have to include every last detail,\nand there may even be a few minor errors in them. In that sense a strict\nnotion of truth may be too much to ask.\nIn another sense it is too little. Auditors and lawyers use the expression\n\u201ctrue and fair.\u201d A company\u2019s annual accounts must be true and fair. What\nthis means is among other things that the numbers and other information\ngiven must provide a good and trustworthy picture of how things really\nare\u2014one that may be acted upon. It does not just mean that the information\nand the numbers given, taken in themselves, are \u201cright\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d\u2014but also\nthat the accounts present a full picture, meaning that no important\ninformation and numbers are left out so that we\u2019re misled about how things\nreally stand.\nSo one thing that is suggested by the word accuracy is that statements\nused as arguments should not just \u201csay of that which is not that it is,\u201d but\nalso they should not tend to make us believe that it is. This is worth\nemphasizing because there are ways of saying things that are true in\nthemselves, but in a \u201cfudging\u201d way that will make some people believe\nsomething untrue.\nRegrettably, numbers are precisely one form of argument where a lot of\nfudging is going on, both in the selection and the presentation of them, as\nwell as with the terms used, etc. So what we get in political debate is often a\nvery foggy or even misleading picture of how things are. It is a sad fact that\nit has come to this, because if we do not have reliable numbers and other\nfactual statements about reality we cannot have a reliable political debate. A\nconcern about accuracy in argumentation implies, among other things, that\none must look out for fog-mongering, obfuscation and fudging with\nnumbers.\nNext, what does relevant mean? One can also say \u201cpertinent to the\nissue.\u201d It is no doubt pertinent to the issue of whether Britain should remain\nin the EU that this will give the country greater freedom to pass its own\nlaws. On the other hand it is also relevant to the issue if it seems likely that\nleaving the EU will negatively affect much of Britain\u2019s foreign trade.\nA crucial problem with an issue like this is that there is no way one can\nobjectively weigh and balance these two arguments against each other. It is\nnot just that the notions involved in these arguments are all rather vague and\nuncertain. Just how much freedom would Britain actually have, in practice,\nto pass its own laws outside the EU? On the other hand, just how certain is\n282 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nit that its foreign trade would be affected, and how much? None of these\nquestions can be answered with any precision.\nOver and above these problems, however, there is the overriding\nproblem that there is no \u201cofficial\u201d way to determine how much the\n\u201cfreedom\u201d consideration weighs against the \u201ctrade\u201d consideration. And\nthere are any number of additional considerations besides these\u2014all\nrelevant to the issue.\nBesides the relevant considerations on issues like this there are, of\ncourse, a great many others being advanced that are clearly irrelevant, or\nwhose relevance is much less clear. An example from a different debate is\nthe view that if an American President wants to restrict people\u2019s ability to\nbuy automatic firearms, then many opponents of such a step will argue that\nthe President\u2019s motive is really to completely take away all the American\ncitizen\u2019s constitutional rights to have guns, and in a sinister next step, to\nsuspend all individual freedoms. This is, in all probability, not true, so this\nargument fails the \u201caccuracy\u201d criterion; but moreover, even if we were to\nassume for a moment that it were true, it is arguably still irrelevant: such a\nPresident would not have a chance to have his way with a plan like that, and\nit could be stopped a hundred times before ever being implemented\u2014so the\nargument that the President has this hidden motive really has little or no\nrelevance in regard to his actual proposal to limit the accessibility of\nautomatic firearms somewhat.\nA related type of bad argument is the straw man argument. If the\nPresident proposes to put certain restrictions on the sale of automatic guns,\nthen to claim that he has proposed to ban all guns altogether is a straw man.\nTo make a straw man is to attribute a claim or a proposal to someone who\nhasn\u2019t made it. One can also make straw man versions of other people\u2019s\narguments. This is what happens when someone attributes an argument to\nsomeone who hasn\u2019t advanced it. An example would be to say that the\nPresident in our example argues for his proposal by saying that it will\ncompletely eliminate homicides in the US. Probably no one, no matter how\nstrongly in favor of gun control, would advance such an extravagant\nargument, and if a spokesman for gun ownership claims that his opponents\nargue like this, then the debate is quickly turning absurd. Nevertheless\narguments of the irrelevant types just exemplified are heard much too\nfrequently\u2014usually from both sides (or all sides) on any given issue.\nWeighty: this concept, which has been mentioned a few times already,\nbecomes crucially important in practical argumentation precisely because\nthere are more than one dimension to them, and probably several\n283 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nconsiderations belonging to each dimension. How much weight an\nargument has becomes worth considering if it is deemed accurate and\nrelevant. (If it is not accurate or relevant, it can, of course, not have any\nweight either.)\nIt is a peculiar complication in considering the weight of an argument\nthat one cannot do it for that argument taken by itself; one has to do it in\nrelation to other relevant arguments on the same issue\u2014and of those there\nare, as we saw, usually several on both sides. Weight therefore really means\nrelative weight. All the arguments on both sides are in play when we are out\nto \u201cweigh\u201d an argument.\nThe weighing of all the arguments against each other will be additionally\ncomplicated by the presence of interpersonal variance\u2014or, in a word,\n\u201csubjectivity.\u201d For example, on the topic of Britain\u2019s EU membership,\nsome will hold that freedom for Britain to pass its own laws without any\ninterference from \u201cBrussels\u201d carries a tremendous weight and outweighs all\nother considerations. Others, however, will feel that this aspect of national\nfreedom is in practice pretty restricted anyway, and that on the whole it\ndoesn\u2019t matter all that much; economy is more important.\nHere we see in a nutshell the difficulty in weighing arguments in\npolitics: there are no objective truths about relative weight.\nWe can criticize and evaluate arguments, and debaters and experts can\nhelp us understand what, for example, certain facts and numbers mean, and\nhow certain they are. On these points there is much that is objective, and\nsubjective views will not all be equally plausible; some factual claims\nsimply are inaccurate, not to say false or untrue. It is not the case that\n\u201ceveryone has a right to his own statistics,\u201d as an American politician is\nreputed to have said. And some arguments really are irrelevant in a way\nthat should be exposed.\nHowever, the weighing of arguments is another matter; everyone must\nsomehow weigh or balance the arguments for him- or herself, and in that\nthere is considerable room for different subjective perspectives.\nThis is because, for one thing, arguments are of different kinds (or\ndimensions, as we said above). Should the economic argument trump the\n\u201cfreedom\u201d argument? We have no physical pair of scales on which we can\nliterally \u201cweigh\u201d the arguments on an issue against each other; the weighing\nis not a literal, physical and hence objective one, but is basically\ncharacterized by subjectivity. The philosopher Carl Wellman (1971) was\naware of this; he not only coined the term \u201cconductive reasoning\u201d for the\n284 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nsituation where we try to balance the pro and con arguments on an issue\n(that is, we bring those arguments together, so we \u201ccon-duct\u201d them)\u2014he\nalso used the old term \u201chefting\u201d for what we do when we \u201cweigh\u201d\narguments against each that cannot be weighed in an objective sense.\nBut despite all these complications and despite the ineradicable presence\nof subjectivity on the scene\u2014or precisely because of it\u2014it is still the case\nthat an individual trying to take a stand on a disputed issue needs all the\nhelp he or she can get in the form of good arguments on both sides. And in\norder to be able to weigh them against each other one especially needs the\ndebaters on each side to hear and answer the arguments from the other side.\nA Public Debate Based on Common Values\nLet us imagine to ourselves an argument about Britain\u2019s EU membership\nin which someone says: \u201cWe bankers have really made a bundle with\nBritain in the EU, so let\u2019s remain so we can continue to rake it in.\u201d Is this a\ngood argument?\nMany will say: No\u2014it may be true, but it is not good, because it is not a\nrelevant argument for staying in the EU\u2014for the rest of us who are not\nbankers, that is. Or take this argument: \u201cWe Conservatives believe Britain\nshould leave the EU because if we don\u2019t say that a lot of our voters will go\nover to UKIP\u201d (a party whose main platform is that Britain should leave the\nEU). That kind of argument would also jar the ears, and in fact one rarely\nhears politicians say such things\u2014in public, that is.\nThe reason is that both these arguments are built on special interest. The\nfirst argument builds on the fact that a certain group of voters (bankers)\nhave a selfish interest in preserving a state of affairs that they profit from.\nThe second is built on the idea that a given political party would rather gain\nthan lose votes\u2014and we can well understand that, but it is nevertheless\nsomething that the rest of us voters need not care about. Both arguments are\nprobably accurate enough because they both invoke something that is\nprobably a fact; but neither of these facts appears to be really relevant to the\nvoter who is about to choose a standpoint.\nThe point is that arguments that are put forward in public debate should\nbe related to the common good. To put it simply, arguments in public debate\nshould refer to concerns that matter to the public. They should refer to\nvalues or effects that everyone, or a lot of people, recognize as important.\nThis is just a special case of the principle that if you want to persuade\nsomeone you should refer to some belief that this person or group already\n285 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\nshares. Most citizens don\u2019t believe it is very desirable in itself that bankers\nmake a bundle\u2014in fact a lot of citizens probably think that if they do, then\nsome change is called for, because it isn\u2019t really just that one profession\nshould rake it in while many others in our society are in dire straits.\nThe principle we are dealing with here is essentially the same that has\nbeen stated in Cha\u00efm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca\u2019s The New\nRhetoric (1969) as the necessity of there being some \u201ccommon ground\u201d that\nserves as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for anyone\u2019s attempt to convince someone of\nsomething. In democracy theory, Amy Gutmann and Denis Thompson have\nformulated the principle of \u201creciprocity,\u201d which means, essentially, that \u201ca\ncitizen offers reason that can be accepted by others who are similarly\nmotivated to find reasons that can be accepted by others\u201d (2009, p. 53).\nNote how it is implied here that a debater is motivated to find such\nreasons\u2014because they constitute his chance of having his conclusion or\npolicy accepted by others. But the fact that debaters find\u2014and need to\nfind\u2014reasons (arguments) that can be accepted by others does not imply\nthat others will necessarily accept their conclusions\u2014for example, the\npolicies they argue for; as Gutmann and Thompson also emphasize,\nreciprocity does not always produce agreement.\nTo argue on the basis of the common good can also be defined as\narguing with reference to values that are commonly shared. They have to be\nvalues that others share, including those who do not agree with the policy\none argues for; if they don\u2019t somehow share a value invoked in the\nargument we make, then our chance of persuading them is nil. That a\nparticular group or a particular party wants to protect its self-interest has\nnothing to do with common values. And for that reason such an argument\nhas no place in public political debate. It is something that may be said in\nclosed groups, behind closed doors. The argument that bankers will\ncontinue to do well if Britain stays in the EU will have traction among\nbankers, but not much outside that segment. Similarly, a Muslim\nfundamentalist (or a fundamentalist Christian) probably (and hopefully)\nwould not get far in a public debate with an argument to the effect that we\nshould ban homosexuality because the Koran (or the Bible) condemns it.\nThese books are not expressions of common values, at least not if they are\ninterpreted literally and in a fundamentalist way.\nHere we have one of the advantages of public debate (there are\ndisadvantages too): in public it is a bad idea to argue with reference to self-\ninterest; one must do it with reference to values that are held in common\u2014\nif not by all, then by most. Purely group-related arguments have little or no\n286 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\npublic traction. To promise financial payments to members of a particular\ngroup if they cooperate in getting one elected is not argumentation at all,\nbut more like a business transaction. \u201cIf you give me this, then I will give\nyou that. You scratch my back, and I\u2019ll scratch yours.\u201d Said in a private\ncontext something like this is sometimes called \u201clog-rolling.\u201d Said in a\npublic context to a broad group it is sometimes called \u201cpork barrel politics.\u201d\nOne could also call it political marketing.\nIt is a fact that in political campaigns nowadays we do see a great deal of\npolitical marketing. Political campaigners and their consultants are\nbecoming increasingly adept at using current technology to home in on\ncarefully selected segments of the electorate and appeal to their particular\nself-interest in communication that only they receive. This kind of selective\ncommunication will become ever easier, in part because of the new digital\nmedia and advanced databases in which citizens are divided into segments\nthis way and that. For example, a politician running for a seat in a\nconstituency with many well-off homeowners may distribute flyers or send\nout emails to this group of people saying: \u201cHere in our district there are\nmany homeowners for whom the freeze on property taxes proposed by\nParty X will save thousands every year. If you want that, then vote for me,\nthe candidate for party X.\u201d If a candidate were to argue to the population at\nlarge for a freeze on home-owner tax on the ground that it would\nparticularly benefit owners of big houses, it might cost him votes rather\nthan win them. He would instead have to defend this policy with reference\nto \u201ccommon\u201d values\u2014for example, financial security for all homeowners,\nor the social desirability of a general tax freeze.\nIn these times of precisely targeted political marketing appealing it\nbecomes increasingly important that there should be public argumentation\nappealing to common values. There are many divisive forces at work that\nwill pull us apart from each other for the sake of placing us in separate\nsegments or interest groups. To go down this road is to approach a society\nof mutually isolated \u201cparallel societies.\u201d\nAnswering as Crucial in Argumentation Democracy\nIn public debate in a democracy it is important, not only that those who\nargue for a candidate or a policy try to live up to the three criteria: accurate,\nrelevant, weighty\u2014it is equally important that those who debate with\nothers, or who are asked to defend their policies in the media, attend to\narguments and criticisms coming from others and answer them. It is\n287 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\narguably the real acid test of useful democratic debate that debaters in\nprinciple answer arguments from others.\nBut what does it mean to answer? Not every reply is an answer. What is\nrequired?\nThe obligation to answer can in principle be satisfied in two ways\u2014and\nin two ways only:\n\u2013 Either one explains why the opponent\u2019s or questioner\u2019s argument is\nbad. It can be bad in two ways\u2014by having a problem with accuracy or with\nrelevance (possibly with both).\n\u2013 Or one acknowledges that the opponent\u2019s argument is good enough\n(i.e., it fulfills the accuracy and relevance criteria); but then one explains\nwhy one doesn\u2019t think it is especially weighty, that is to say, why the\narguments for one\u2019s own position still outweigh the opponent\u2019s arguments\nagainst it.\nIt is this final comparison of pro and con arguments that constitutes\nweighing. It is what every single voter must do for him- or herself. The\nweighing has to be a kind of \u201ccomparison,\u201d since it cannot be an actual\nphysical weighing in terms of pounds or kilograms or some other objective\nunit. (For that reason let us put \u201cweighing\u201d in quotes from now on.) And\nbecause of this we need to do the \u201cweighing\u201d ourselves and assume the\nresponsibility for it ourselves. We cannot call in experts to do it for us.\nThere are no experts that can do it for us.\nThis does not alter the fact that in advance of this personal \u201cweighing\u201d\nof arguments there is a great deal we do need\u2014both from the politicians\nwho want us to adopt a particular standpoint and from people with\nexperience on the issue as well as experts of all kinds. By listening to all of\nthem we may hope to acquire a basis for our own \u201cweighing\u201d of the\narguments. This will help us get an overall view of what the issue involves,\nwhat arguments pertain to it, which arguments from each side are accurate\nand relevant, what the other party has to say in answer to them\u2014and how\nmuch \u201cweight\u201d we then feel we can assign to them, in relation to the other\nrelevant arguments.\nPerhaps the fundamental principles of public debate that have just been\nsketched sound obvious, almost banal. But they imply a number of not-so-\nbanal consequences:\n\u2013 Democracy is not just the principles that people can vote, and the\nmajority rules. There also has to be public debate in which the parties give\nrelevant arguments for their standpoints and answer opposing arguments.\n288 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\n\u2013 Consensus, i.e., complete agreement on an issue, cannot be expected to\narise, and no one can expect to win over all the others to his or her side.\n\u2013 There will be some individuals on both sides who will change their\nstandpoints, but only some.\n\u2013 Some of those who did not have a standpoint initially will choose a\nstandpoint.\n\u2013 All who participate in the debate, or listen to it, will, however, become\nbetter informed about the issue. Even though most of those who have a\nstandpoint will probably continue to hold it, many of them will be likely to\nfind additional support for it, extend it, modify it or attach some\nqualifications to it.\n\u2013 Arguments should appeal to shared values; arguments based on the\narguer\u2019s personal value system or on his or her pure self-interest have no\nweight for those who do not share that value system or that self-interest.\n\u2013 Answers to an opposing argument must include either a reasonable\ncriticism of it or an acknowledgment of it, plus a \u201cweighing\u201d of the\narguments for and against.\nA democracy that has public debates like these can be called an\nargumentation democracy. A current term used by an increasing number of\nthinkers and scholars is deliberative democracy. Its key notion is\ndeliberation, which is simply a Latin word that means \u201cweighing.\u201d One\ncould say that what has just been described is one notion of what a\n\u201cdeliberative\u201d democracy implies.\nA related concept is that of a \u201cconversation democracy\u201d (or \u201cdialogue\ndemocracy\u201d). This term was used in a book written in 1945 by a forerunner\nof the deliberative democracy strand of thinking\u2014the Danish theologian\nand educator Hal Koch. For him the central features of democracy were not\njust that general elections are held and that the majority decides, but also\nthat there is ongoing debate. The rules and principles for such a debate are\nsimilar to those outlined above.\nImportantly, \u201cconversation democracy\u201d does not mean that the\ndiscussants must necessarily come to agreement but only that through\nconversation one \u201cseeks to get the matter looked at from all sides and that\nthe parties to the conversation strive to ... reach a more correct and\nreasonable understanding of the problem behind the conflict\u201d (1945, p. 16).\nKoch\u2019s thinking has been criticized because it was thought that he was\nbeating the drum for a kind of consensus democracy\u2014a democracy in\nwhich it is expected that all will come to agreement if only they continue to\n289 Argumentation Democracy 101: Deliberative Norms Made Easy\ntalk reasonably with each other. Such an ideal is attributed\u2014rightly or\nwrongly\u2014to the German social philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas. But that was\nnot what Koch meant, and a conversation-based or argumentation-based\ndemocracy does not build on this idea at all. There are many good reasons\nwhy a group of people will not necessarily come to an agreement, no matter\nhow much and how well they argue. To believe that deliberation or\nargumentation or conversation is essential to democracy does not entail the\nview that argumentation must lead to agreement among the debaters. It can\ndo that, or at least bring it closer\u2014but much of the time the debaters\ncontinue to hold exactly the same positions after the debate that they did\nbefore it. However, even so, debate is essential to democracy; it is, after all,\nnot for the sake of the debaters that debates are held but for their audiences\n(citizens, voters).\nDebates should be held and evaluated with a view to what citizens need.\nWhat they need is open discussion of what is best for the society\u2014\ndiscussion that brings bring accurate and relevant arguments onto the stage,\nand makes sure that citizens are helped in their attempts to \u201cweigh\u201d them\u2014\nwhich requires that they are properly answered.\nThat ideal has become increasingly distant in debates in contemporary\nWestern democracies in the last ten to twenty years. This essay tries to set\nup a yardstick that can help us assess what we get\u2014and be conscious of\nwhat we lack.\nREFERENCES\nDavidson, D., 1996. The folly of trying to define truth.

Instead, a huge class of common\nquantifying expressions should be seen as essentially \u201cargumentative\u201d or\n\u201cpersuasive.\u201d Their only clear meaning lies in their aptness to support a\nconclusion of a certain kind.\nThis article\u2014or rather, this collection of rambling remarks\u2014allows itself\nan amount of irreverence which calls for some apology.

I believe there are countless cases of vagueness in\nquantification in natural language where the vagueness is crucial and\nunresolvable. Now if my linguistic intuition tells me about all these cases of\nunresolvable vagueness, I look for a theory to explain why the vagueness is\nthere, not for one that tries to say that it isn\u2019t. I make the assumption that a\ntruth-conditionally based semantics cannot put up with unresolvable\nvagueness in quantification. If this is not the case, my remarks become\ninoperative as far as truth-conditionalism is concerned. However, the claim\nthat unresolvable vagueness is common in natural language remains, and\nmy wish is to make it implausible to say that it isn\u2019t. I confess that I am\neither unfamiliar or unimpressed with existing attempts to resolve\nvagueness in quantification\u2014mostly because they employ an amount of\n*This his article was originally published in Possibilities and Limitations of Pragmatics:\nProceedings of the Conference on Pragmatics, Urbino, July 1979.

For example, there is\nAltham and Tennant (1975), whose \u201csortal quantification,\u201d as far as I\nunderstand it, has recourse to the classes-and-norms idea discussed below;\nand there is Kamp (1975), which, for the student who can comprehend that\nsort of thing, might contain something that refutes my claims. Be that as it\nmay, I still think somebody has to make new observations about natural\nlanguage. Logicians may then try to explain the mechanisms in what they\nhave seen, not to explain it away. It cannot be satisfactory to let logicians\nset up a theory of natural language based on \"The King of France is bald\"\nand other bits and scraps made up to illustrate what they are looking for in\nthe first place.\nCurrently, logically oriented semantic theories are much attracted by the\nproject of accounting for meaning in terms of truth conditions. This seminal\nidea is the sort of notion that is capable of grabbing hold of the minds of a\nlarge body of students within a subject, while others in the same subject,\nwho are in the hold of some other seminal idea, tend to be impatient with it,\nand conversely. It will be no secret in the following that the present writer,\nnot exactly a linguist and much less a logician, belongs to the class of\nimpatients as far as truth conditions are concerned. In a general way, I think\nthat linguists and other researchers in academic fields to a large extent have\ntheir views dictated to them by the charm that various seminal ideas\nexercise over their senses. And the charm that certain ideas have to certain\npeople is again derived from certain ruling instincts in their conscious and\nunconscious minds. This is no less true, I believe, of logicians than anybody\nelse. Furthermore, the whole point of the following remarks is coherent\nwith the idea that the primitive function of natural languages is to help\nsatisfy the conscious or subconscious needs of individuals, as dictated by\ncertain basic instincts.\nAs a believer in this, I am likely to say things like \u201cThe contribution\nmade by truth conditions to the meaning of utterances in natural languages\nis small, while the contribution made by other mechanisms is large,\u201d\nwhereas believers in logical semantics would put it the other way round.\nFor instance, Ruth Kempson (1977, p. 41), after conceding that areas of\nmeaning like non-indicative sentences may not be describable in terms of\ntruth conditions, adds a footnote saying: \u201cA small and inhomogeneous\ngroup of lexical items also seems to resist analysis in terms of truth\nconditions. These include even, but, deplore, and some uses of if\u201d (!). What\nI want to suggest is that a large group of lexical items seems to resist\nanalysis in such terms. And in anticipation of what I have to say, let me\n294 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\ndirect your attention to the first sentence in the quote, and to the first\nsentence of my own following it.\nThe final, and boldest, claim I am going to make below is precisely that\nthe meaning of such uses of small and large as we find here cannot in any\nrespectable way be accounted for truth-conditionally, but only if natural\nlanguage is seen as purposive action for the furtherance of speakers\u2019\ninterests and needs.\nThus, a great many adjectival and adverbial quantifiers appear to be\nmuch more easily accounted for in terms of speaker\u2019s purpose than in truth-\nconditional terms. Take a sentence like\n(1) The dictator had several clergymen arrested\nThis would typically occur in a newspaper report, e .g., about social riots\nin some Latin American country. It would be evidently suitable to support\nthe reporter\u2019s statement as to what sort of a country it is, or what sort of\nman the dictator is. But it does not give the reader much idea of just how\nmany clergymen were arrested. However, if it was substituted with a\nsentence that does, such as\n(2) The dictator had 117 clergymen arrested\nit would probably be of much less use in conveying the reporter's idea, and\nthe reader might be inclined to ask: \u201cSo what? What do you make of that?\u201d\nOn the other hand, the item several would not be of much use to the dictator\nhimself in the situation where he wants his National Guard, or whatever, to\ngo out and arrest a certain number of clergymen taking part in a\ndemonstration or something. The order:\n(3) Arrest several of those clergymen!\nwould be rather inappropriate here and probably put the National Guard in a\nstate of disorientation.\nThe point is that the purpose of several is not so much truth-conditional\nas it is argumentative, in the sense suggested by Ducrot (1973), Anscombre\nand Ducrot (1976, 1978). Leaning on their formulation of argumentative\nproperties of items like almost (presque), we might say that the most\nimportant lexical feature of several is the following: it may be used in a\nsentence S to support any sentence S which is such that S receives\n1 2 2\nstronger support the more members of a class are referred to in S . It is not\n1\nimportant, in a sentence containing several, to know just how many\nmembers of a class it refers to. The important thing is that the kind of\nstatement it is meant to support is the kind just defined, e.g., the statement\nThe dictator has taken a harsh course on political dissent within the church.\n295 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\nNow in a situation where, say, 1,000 clergymen have been demonstrating\nand 117 arrested, one reporter might write The dictator had several\nclergymen arrested, whereas another might write The dictator only had a\nfew of the clergymen arrested. The meaning of several and only a few is\nnon-truth-conditional in the sense that there is no saying whether the actual\nstate of affairs described by the two statements fulfils the truth conditions of\none or the other. But so much is certain to any reader familiar with the\nlexical properties of the two items in question: only the writer of the first\nstatement may, with coherence, go on to say the dictator has taken a harsh\ncourse on political dissent within the church.\nAn interesting adverbial quantifier is a bit. Suppose I say\n(4) Scotland is a bit rocky\nAgain it is quite unclear just what degree of rockiness I wish to predicate\nof Scotland. I am not saying anything that you could go to Scotland and test\nto see if Scotland satisfies the truth conditions of it. Truth-conditionally, I\nam probably only saying that there are rocks in Scotland. But I am saying\nmore than this. I am saying that whatever degree of rockiness can be\ntruthfully predicated of Scotland, it is too much for my taste. A typical\nsituation for (4) to occur in would be a discussion with my wife over where\nwe ought to go on holiday. A likely reaction to (4) would be to say, What do\nyou mean? Rocks are LOVELY! Such a reaction would be a purposive\nact\u2014trying to get me to see the nice side of rocks\u2014against the purposive\nact represented by (4), which is an attempt to avoid going to Scotland on\nholiday.\nConsider now a statement like (5), which is quite likely to be heard in\nthe current debate over nuclear energy:\n(5) Nuclear plants often have uncontrolled radioactive blowouts\nAs before, my claim is going to be that the quantifier contained in this\nsentence, often, carries a kind of meaning that cannot be described in terms\nof truth conditions. It should begin to be clear by now that if this claim can\nbe validated the carpet is drawn away under the truth conditional account of\nan enormous amount of quantifying expressions.\nAs far as I can see, the only notion truth-conditionalism can rely on to\nkeep the carpet under its feet against attacks of this sort is the notion of\n-\nimplicit norms. The idea is that apparent vagueness in adjectives or\n.\nadverbials is resolved in each individual case by looking at what class, or\nsort, of thing, or event, the vague expression applies to. The argument is\nusually advanced in connection with what Lyons (1968, p. 465) calls\n296 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\n\u201cimplicitly graded antonyms,\u201d i.e., pairs like small vs. big, where the\napparent vagueness of This elephant is big is resolved by implying that the\nelephant is bigger than the norm for that sort of thing, i.e., elephants. I wish\nto return to items like big and small below, but I would like to take a first\nskirmish with the \u201cnorm\u201d theory now. In the case of (5), what norm could\none adduce in order to resolve the vagueness of often? The example is\nchosen expressly with a view to exclude such a resolution, yet I claim that\n(5) is a perfectly natural and meaningful sort of thing to say, as in fact we\nall do all the time. You can\u2019t explicate often by saying that radioactive\nblowouts happen often in nuclear plants compared to the \u201cnorm\u201d for, e.g.,\npower plants in general, for in other power plants radioactive blowouts do\nnot occur at all. Hence there is no such norm. It is interesting that (5) is a\nstatement that one would very likely hear from an opponent of nuclear\npower, whereas it would probably never come from one of its advocates.\nThe case is quite analogous to that of several. Two opposed participants in a\nhearing or panel discussion on nuclear power might be quite agreed as to\njust how many radioactive blowouts have occurred in nuclear plants within\na given period, e.g., 117; yet one will probably maintain that they happen\noften, while the other will maintain that they do not\u2014or perhaps that they\ndo happen often, but represent no danger. The meaning of often is thus\nargumentative, not truth-conditional; in the sense that the basic bit of lexical\ninformation about often is that it may be used to describe a certain state of\naffairs if you have a certain kind of conclusion you want to support in doing\nso; if you reject this kind of conclusion, you may only use it if you follow it\nup with a sentence containing but or a synonym of but.\nI would ask the reader, without further comment, to consider the\nfunctioning of items like repeatedly, again and again and all the time in\nterms similar to those just suggested.\nNow consider (6):\n(6) Uncontrolled radioactive blowouts from nuclear plants are frequent\nIt would take a great deal of hair-splitting to claim that (5) and (6) are\nnot synonymous. That is to say, if my argument about often in (5) holds\ngood, it also applies to frequent in (6). And in that case it will turn out that\nan enormous amount of utterances in daily communication involve non-\ntruth-conditional predication, viz. all those where adjectives of the type\nfrequent/rare, small/big are operative in the predicate. These are Lyons\u2019s\n\u201cimplicitly graded antonyms,\u201d or, in the terminology suggested by P.T.\nGeach (1956): \u201clogically attributive adjectives.\u201d These he distinguishes\nfrom \u201clogically predicative adjectives\u201d like red or round, which apply to\n297 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\nany individual in the same way regardless how it is specified. In contrast, it\nis characteristic of a logically attributive adjective that the individual it\napplies to must be specified as a member of some class for which some\nnorm may be indicated (regarding size, or whatever it is). Fink (1973, p. 26)\nalso calls such adjectives \u201clogically comparative\u201d because the positive form\nof such an adjective is \u201clogically dependent on its comparative and not vice\nversa. A big mouse is not bigger than other mice because the property\nbigness is realized in it in an especially high degree; it is a big mouse\nsimply because it is bigger than most other mice.\u201d This, as far as I can see,\namounts to saying that there is a norm for bigness in mice which can be\ndefined as a degree of bigness such that half the mice in the world are\nbigger and the other half smaller. Lyons makes essentially the same point\nwhen he remarks that \u201csuch words as big and small, or good and bad, do\nnot refer to independent, \u2018opposite\u2019 qualities, but are merely lexical devices\nfor grading as \u2018more than\u2019 or \u2018less than\u2019 with respect to some implicit\nnorm\u201d (1968, pp. 465-66).\nBut whereas this idea is nicely applicable to paradigmatic cases like This\nmouse is big, it is hard to see how it can apply to (6). The application of an\nimplicit norm regarding the quality attributed to the subject is, as we have\nseen, dependent on the reference of the subject to some class. While it is\neasy enough to refer an individual like this mouse to the class of all existing\nmice, what is one to do if the subject is not an individual, but a whole class\nin itself? The only way seems to be to regard it as a subclass of some super-\nclass\u2014but what is that to be? As we have already seen, we cannot in (6),\nany more than in (5), have recourse to a super-class of \u201cuncontrolled\nradioactive blowouts in all kinds of plants,\u201d for this super-class would have\nno more members than the sub-class. If pressed, we might try to establish as\nsuper-class either \u201call kinds of blowouts in nuclear plants\u201d or \u201call accidents\nin all kinds of plants\u201d or an unlimited number of other super-classes, none\nof which are in any way suggested by (6) itself.\nIt is possibly the case that in most sentences with a logically attributive\nin the predicate the subject may be referred to some class with some\nimplicit norm. But the point is that this operation is not possible in all such\nsentences. Hence I claim that the cases where a class and a norm may be\nappropriately adduced are special cases of a more general phenomenon. The\n,\nmore general phenomenon is that predicates with logically attributive\nadjectives in them are basically argumentative, not truth-conditional;\nhowever, they may be so directly, or via some norm. In order to sa1vage the\n\u201cnorm\u201d account as a general p1oy to resolve vagueness, one might, in a last\n298 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\ndesperate move, suggest that each occurrence of a logically attributive\nadjective in the predicate either refers to some pre-existent implicit norm,\nor, if this is not possible, sets up an idiosyncratic, ad-hoc norm. In order to\ntest this suggestion, let us consider one more example of the kind that\nresists the simpler analysis. Let us imagine a man and a wife who have to\npart from each other for a certain period, say, three weeks. In parting they\ntell one another to cheer up and not be too sad about it, and one of them\nsays,\n(7) Three weeks is not long\nNow in many such cases it would be implausible to suggest that the\ncouple already have, in their shared background knowledge or whatever we\nwant to call it, an implicit norm regarding the length of periods of\nseparation according to which three weeks is not \u201clong.\u201d At any rate, one\ncannot in such a situation, along the lines suggested by Fink, interpret not\nlong to mean \u201cshorter than most periods of separation\u201d; it may be the\ncouple\u2019s first and even their only period away from each other. Now the\n\u201clast desperate move\u201d consists in saying that the utterance of (7) establishes\na norm where none existed before; that is, we now have to do with a \u201cnorm\u201d\nthat is not implicit. But all we know about this very ephemeral, ad-hoc\nnorm is that according to it, three weeks is not long. Now if we wish, as a\nlogical semanticist would, to resolve the vagueness and find the truth-\nconditional meaning of (7), this is all we have to work with, and hence all\nwe can do is to substitute, for the phrase not long, the phrase three weeks in\nwhich case we end up with Three weeks is three weeks. On a pragmatic\naccount this might indeed have some meaning, but certainly not the same as\nthe original utterance. On any account, Three weeks is three weeks is, on the\nface of it, tautological, and on a truth-conditional account it would then\nhave no meaning at all.\nAs we see, the truth-conditional account in cases such as this only\nmanages to eliminate any meaning the utterance might have had. An\nalternative account, which I am not in a position to develop fully here,\nought instead to interpret the meaning of the utterance in terms of what\nsentences it may cohere with. Three weeks is not long in the given situation\nmay cohere with any sentence that serves to encourage mental fortitude in\nthe hearer and/or to discourage sorrow. Thus the speaker, in saying Three\nweeks is not long, is not making an assertion as to how long three weeks are\nin relation to any norm, but he/she is acting to encourage fortitude, etc., in\nrelation to the length of the period of separation, such as it is. This\ninterpretation is of course situation dependent (in that it assumes, among\n299 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\nother things, that the speaker and hearer are unhappy about being\nseparated). But it may be made independent of such contextual factors if we\nsay the following: The meaning of the utterance is that it may cohere, in a\nsupporting function, with any sentence which is such that it receives\nstronger support the shorter the period of absence is. Conversely, there will\nbe no coherence with any sentence which does not fulfill this condition.\nThus, in terms of coherence, the meaning of Three weeks is not long may be\nunderstood and described without vagueness even though there is no actual\nsentence for it to cohere with, and without making it circular by imputing to\nit a reliance on any volatile, ad-hoc \u201cnorm.\u201d The meaning of the utterance,\nif truth-conditional, is void.\nSuch a radically non-truth-conditional use of logically attributive\nadjectives is not limited to situations of the emotional nature suggested in\nthe above example. On the contrary, it is found all the time in such\nallegedly non-emotional, matter-of-fact types of communication as\nnewspaper reporting and political debate or statement. To illustrate this, let\nme choose just one example, quite randomly, from a newspaper I picked up\non my way to the pragmatics conference at Urbino, The International\nHerald Tribune from Thursday, July 5, 1979. One of the cover stories of\nthis issue is headed \u201cEEC Aides See OPEC Drive to Set Oil Ceiling\u201d and\nreports on talks held in London between high-ranking EEC and OPEC\nrepresentatives. The reporter, Joseph Fitchett, writes:\nIn the London talks, the European team, which apparently did most of\nthe talking while OPEC listened, concentrated on conveying\n\u2018confidence-building measures\u2019 aimed at demonstrating the intentions of\nindustrial countries to cooperate over energy matters. The French\nindustry minister, for instance, reportedly spent much of his time trying\nto convince the OPEC team that the U. S. commitment at the Tokyo\nsummit to a ceiling on oil imports until 1985 was a sincere, important\nstep by the Carter administration to promote energy-saving.\nConsider the adjective much in the second sentence. The function of this\nsentence, which gives it coherence with the first, is to establish support for\nthe assertion made in the first\u2014the sort of conjunctive relation that Halliday\nand Hasan (1976, p. 248) would call \u201cexemplificatory apposition\u201d and place\nunder the heading of \u201cinternal additive relations.\u201d My point is that much\ncannot be referred to any norm that gives us any clue as to just how much of\nhis time the French minister spent trying to convince the OPEC team. The\ncontribution made to meaning by much is not truth-conditional. Its purpose\nis simply to get the reader to accept the assertion contained in the first\n300 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\nperiod, not to supply information on the actual amount of time spent by the\nminister doing this or that.\nFurther down in the article, the reporter quotes Mr. Guido Brunner, the\n\u00b7\nEEC commissioner for energy, on the outcome of the talks: \u201cDespite the\ninauspicious start in London, Mr. Brunner said that \u2018we stand a fair chance\nto continue\u2019 some form of dialogue, perhaps in another framework.\u201d\nConsider the word fair in the quote from Mr. Brunner. Just how big a\nchance could he have meant there was for a continuation of the talks? 25\n%? 50 %? More than 50 %? There is no way for the hearer or the reader of\nMr. Brunner\u2019s statement to assess this. Most likely Mr. Brunner himself did\nnot have any figure in mind at all. The function of his statement is simply\nwhat we might call persuasive; its meaning emerges when one considers the\nvarious continuations it might think ably cohere with in a supporting\nfunction. All we know about these is that they must be such that they will\nreceive stronger support, the fairer the chance is.\nWe may now revert to the quarrel as to whether the group of lexical\n.\u2022\nitems unaccountable for in truth-conditional terms is \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge.\u201d\nThe difference between logical semanticists and more instinctive ones like\nmyself is that I would say it was large, and they would say it was small. I\nhave tried above to show that it is certainly larger than they think. But even\nif they concede that some of my points are correctly taken, they will\nprobably still say it is small, and I will still say it is large. Both statements\nare vague when interpreted truth-conditionally; in fact there is no deciding\nwhether the actual state of affairs, if it could be agreed upon, comes closer\nto satisfying the truth conditions of my statement or those of theirs. My\nwhole point is that this is quite as it should be, if you believe in the sort of\ntheory of language that I think ought to be developed; but not if you believe\nin theirs. People who be1ieve that all sentences, or even all declarative\nsentences, have a statable truth-conditional meaning, ought to be biting their\ntongues a lot of the times they use predicates involving words like big or\nsmall; the rest of us may go on using them unabashedly, as we always have.\nThe use of unresolvably vague, non-truth-conditional quantification in\nnatural language is, I believe, as omnipresent as people\u2019s attempts, in\nwhatever they do or say, to further their interests, dictated by instincts.\nREFERENCES\n301 Non-Truth-Conditional Quantification\nAltham, J.E.J., and Neil W.

The corpus from which the\nexamples are drawn is President George W. Bush\u2019s public speeches during\nthe months before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and the controversial\nbut implicit proposition that they may have helped putting over to many\nAmericans is that Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein had some complicity in the\nterrorist attacks of 9/11. To analyze the linguistic mechanisms that may\nhave allowed this to happen, the paper invokes H.P. Grice\u2019s notion of\n\u201cconversational implicature,\u201d but also two other mechanisms that may\nwork in similar ways, and which are, it seems, less explored in linguistics\npragmatics and rhetoric.\nIntroduction\nArguably, the discipline of rhetoric can be defined as the study of\ncommunication as it impacts on the minds of audiences. This paper will\nlook at examples of one category of such impact: it will study how\nutterances by a speaker may\u2014more or less strongly\u2014invite audiences to\ninterpret them as conveying semantic content that is not explicitly\nexpressed. In other words, some people in the audience take that content as\npart of what the speaker meant to say, yet it is not manifestly there in the\nspeaker\u2019s utterances.\nIt is of course a trivial insight that speakers\u2019 utterances imply more than\nthey explicitly state. There have been insightful studies of how politicians\n* Originally published in Rhetoric, Discourse and Knowledge, M. Za\u0140eska and U. Okulska,\n(Eds.). Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 2016, 276-286. Reprinted with permission of the\nPublisher. Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nimplicitly convey views they want their audiences to accept, as for example\nthe rhetorician Anders Sigrell\u2019s study of persuasion \u201cbetween the lines\u201d in\nmodern political argumentation (1995), or the discourse analyst Teun van\nDijk\u2019s study of \u201cpolitical implicatures\u201d in Spanish Prime Minister Aznar\u2019s\nrhetoric on his country\u2019s participation in the Iraq war (2005). The views\nconveyed in these ways generally are ones that the speakers in question also\nstate explicitly, and indeed in any way they can; however, what is common\nto the phenomena I will look at below is that they may, in the understanding\nof some hearers, convey content that the speaker a) is not willing to state\nexplicitly, and b) would deny if asked point-blank whether he intended to\nconvey it. In fact, in the case studied, the speaker did deny it.\nThe case concerns public speeches given by President George W. Bush\nduring the half year that preceded the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and\nthe particular notion that I believe some hearers believed he meant to\nconvey, but which he did not assert, was that Iraq\u2019s dictator Saddam\nHussein had somehow been involved in the terrorist acts of September 11,\n2001.\nWithout discussing whether Bush and his speechwriters deliberately\nintended their words to convey this notion, I wish to emphasize that there\nmay be the following advantages for a public speaker in conveying certain\nnotions in this manner. First, the speaker cannot be held responsible for\nthem since he did not state them or otherwise convey them in a manner that\nis manifest and unquestionable (e.g., by direct assertion or by\npresupposition). Second, these notions are likely to \u201cfly under the radar\u201d of\nmany in the speaker\u2019s audience, since non-explicit semantic content is\nubiquitous in human communication. In the standard case, it helps securing\nspeedy and unimpeded communication between people, and hence it is\nnormally processed rather automatically by hearers and out of their mental\nfocus; for these reasons at least some hearers are likely to accept such\ncontent unreflectingly as being part of the speaker\u2019s meaning, and maybe\neven as being true. Third, for the same reasons, the speaker is not so likely\nto be expected to offer argumentation in their support. Because of these\npotential advantages a public speaker may have a strong motive for using\nlanguage inviting hearers to imply views that the speaker does not wish to\nstate or to argue for\u2014views that he does not want to be consciously\nprocessed, questioned or scrutinized. To the extent the speaker is successful\nin this, such views may become part of what many in the audience consider\npublic, shared knowledge.\n304 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nAn important pioneer in the study of implicit semantic meaning is the\nphilosopher H. Paul Grice. The first of three phenomena that I will\nexemplify belongs to the category he, in a celebrated paper, called\nconversational implicature (1975; 1989). I will then discuss examples of\ntwo related concepts inspired by his approach; I call them fuzzy reference\nand suggestive sentence collocation. I will discuss these three mechanisms\nin descending order of what we may call \u201csuggestive force.\u201d Conversational\nimplicature is the type I think most likely to suggest unasserted ideas in\nhearers\u2019 minds; hence these are the ones that make it most relevant to blame\nthe speaker for manipulation. The other two types may also act suggestively\nand automatically in varying degrees, but here a smaller part of the blame\nmay be laid to the speaker and a correspondingly larger part to the\ncarelessness of hearers.\nIn my rhetorical analysis, I will specifically suggest that several\npronouncements by President George W. Bush shortly before the invasion\nof Iraq had the capacity to prompt, invite or sustain in the minds of hearers\nthe idea that Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein was somehow complicit in the terrorist\nacts of September 11. This idea, which Bush never explicitly asserted,\nbecame widespread in the US population in the months preceding the\ninvasion of Iraq, concurrent with the rhetorical campaign by the Bush\nadministration from which I draw my examples.\nMore generally, I will suggest that an explicit and nuanced awareness of\nsuch phenomena can help rhetoricians and other students of public and\npolitical communication expose and illuminate phenomena that deserve\nsuch exposure. Because they work the way they do, many hearers may\naccept ideas conveyed in this way without reasons for them being asked, or\ngiven. Moreover, I believe much of the mental work in the minds of hearers\nwho accept these ideas is automatic and subliminal; and that is another\nreason why it is useful to be distinctly aware of what goes on. Hence it is\nparticularly useful to know these devices and to be able to distinguish\nbetween them. That way we citizens, and also the media, may better\nrecognize them and engage in analysis and deliberation when we hear them;\nand we may consider to what degree politicians who use such devices are to\nblame for it, and to what degree we should blame ourselves for letting them\nwork on our minds without giving them proper attention.\nIn this analysis concepts and approaches drawn from linguistic\npragmatics are adduced to provide a more explicit conceptual understanding\nof the mechanisms involved; on the other hand, the understanding and\nassessment of precisely how these mechanism function and are used (or\n305 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nexploited) in actual political rhetoric in a specific historical context is a task\nfor rhetorical criticism. The two disciplines may thus mutually aid and\nsupplement each other.\nConversational implicature\nFirst, the mechanism that H.P. Grice has called conversational\nimplicature. An implicature of an utterance is the hearers\u2019 understanding of\nsomething that is not said, but which the hearers believe the speaker means\nthem to understand. Grice thinks implicatures arise because of what he calls\nthe \u201cCooperative Principle\u201d underlying all normal conversations. It states:\n\u201cMake your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at\nwhich it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in\nwhich you are engaged\u201d (Grice 1989, p. 26). Speakers (and writers) are\nnormally expected to adhere to this principle, and hearers\u2019 (and readers\u2019)\nimplicit awareness of this may cause them to assume, often inadvertently,\nthat certain ideas are implicated as part of the speaker\u2019s intended\nmeaning\u2014because if they were not, the speaker would be perceived as\nviolating the Cooperative Principle.\nFrom this principle Grice infers a set of \u201cconversational maxims\u201d (Grice\n1989, pp. 26\u201327). At issue in the present context is, primarily, the second\n\u201cmaxim of Quantity,\u201d which says: \u201cDo not make your contribution more\ninformative than is required.\u201d Because our default expectation is that\nspeakers will obey this rule, we tend, in the default case, to automatically\nbelieve that all the information they put into their utterance and all the\nchoices it reflects have meanings that they intend us to grasp.\nThere is also the \u201cmaxim of Relation,\u201d which says, simply: \u201cBe\nrelevant.\u201d This makes us automatically expect that speakers intend\neverything in their utterances to be relevant; for example, conjoined\nsentences should be relevant to each other somehow, that is, have some\nsemantic coherence. This will be in evidence in some of the examples\ndiscussed below.\nThe first example comes from Bush\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d speech\nshortly before the invasion of Iraq.21\n(1) Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam\nHussein could be contained.\n21 Held in Congress on January 28, 2003. All quotations from the documents discussed have\nbeen taken from the site http://georgewbush-\nwhitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/archive.html.\n306 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nExample (1) has the implicature that those who believed, before 9/11,\nthat Saddam could be contained, stopped believing it that day\u2014otherwise it\nwould be pointless to say that they believed it before 9/11, and (1) would be\n\u201cmore informative than required.\u201d But why did they stop believing it after\nthat day? Bush does not state the reason explicitly. But surely the minds of\nmany hearers would automatically have set to work on it. If 9/11 changed\npeople\u2019s view of Saddam, then the most obvious reason would be that\nSaddam was involved in 9/11. There may be other reasons, as we shall see,\nbut none as obvious.\nNow consider the next sentence in the speech:\n(2) But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks\nare not easily contained.\nHere, new implicatures may arise. The preferred one will probably be\nthat Saddam has these agents and viruses and supports these networks;\notherwise (2) also would be \u201cmore informative than required.\u201d\nIf, then, (1) invites an implicature that Saddam was indeed involved in\n9/11, then (2) coheres with that idea since the phrase shadowy terrorist\nnetworks could now be heard as referring to the same terrorist network(s)\nthat perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. However, the chemical agents and viruses\ncannot connect with this idea, since nothing of those kinds was involved in\nthe attacks. The two sentences together, including their implicatures, may\nthen be heard as implicating that Saddam was involved in 9/11 through his\nconnection with terrorist networks, and that he also has chemical and\nbiological weapons that he may lend to a new attack.\nHowever, Bush\u2019s official reason why 9/11 should make Americans\nchange their view of Saddam only contained the second idea: that Saddam\nmight equip a new terrorist attack, not that he was involved in the first one.\nConsider this passage from a press release:\n(3) We felt secure here in the country. There's no way we could have\npossibly envisioned that the battlefield would change. And it has. And\nthat\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to deal with all the threats. That\u2019s why Americans\nmust understand that when a tyrant like Saddam Hussein possesses\nweapons of mass destruction (\u2026).22\nIn other words, we now know that terrorists can attack the mainland, and\nall villanous dictators like Saddam who could equip them with WMD\u2019s\nshould therefore be seen as threats that we must deal with.\n22 \u201cBush, Prime Minister Blair Discuss Keeping the Peace,\u201d September 7, 2002.\n307 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nBut surely this reason for connecting Saddam and 9/11 is less plausible\nthan the simple idea that he was involved in 9/11. First, the need to deal\nwith all threats from villainous dictators who might act like this does not\nexplain why Saddam in particular is such an urgent concern, or why\nSaddam is singled out for mention in (1) there rather than all villanous\ndictators. Secondly, as for terrorists bringing WMD\u2019s to America, nothing\nreally seems to have changed. For them to bring nuclear weapons is\nprobably out of the question, and always has been; as for chemical and\nbiological WMD\u2019s, these can be so small that it has always been possible to\nbring them into the US, so here too there is nothing new. Moreover,\nterrorists can probably get these things elsewhere if Saddam is deposed. So\nBush\u2019s reasoning as to why 9/11 suddenly reveals the necessity of deposing\nSaddam is much more complex than the idea that Saddam was involved in\n9/11, and also rather implausible. Thus the most natural implicature in (1)\nand (2) is still that Saddam was involved in 9/11.\nOn January 31, 2003, Bush received British Prime Minister Blair, and in\na joint press conference a journalist asked them: \u201cDo you believe that there\nis a link between Saddam Hussein, a direct link, and the men who attacked\non September the 11th?\u201d Bush replied:\n(4) I can't make that claim.\nAnd he never did.23 Yet when the invasion of Iraq was begun in March\n2003, and for some time after, most Americans had come to believe that\nthere was such a link. I am arguing that several public utterances by Bush\nand his staff in the months before the invasion were apt to suggest or sustain\nthe idea in hearers\u2019 minds that Bush believed in this link. Is this denial such\nan utterance?\nAt any rate Bush\u2019s denial of the claim about the direct link between\nSaddam and 9/11 is worded in a peculiar way. The default wording of a\ndenial when asked whether one believes something that one in fact does not\nbelieve would be something like No, I don\u2019t. The linguist and social\nanthropologist Stephen Levinson proposes a heuristic for what he calls\n\u201cmarked\u201d formulations, based on Grice\u2019s maxim of Quantity (i.e., that one\nshould not be more informative than required): \u201cWhat\u2019s said in an abnormal\nway, isn\u2019t normal; or Marked message indicates marked situation\u201d (2000, p.\n23 As late as 2009, former Vice President Dick Cheney also denied the Saddam-9/11\nlink, see \u201cCheney: No link between Saddam Hussein, 9/11,\u201d\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/01/cheney.speech/.\n308 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\n33). Hearers\u2019 minds, using this heuristic, may automatically proceed to\ninterpret Bush\u2019s \u201cabnormally\u201d worded denial as implicating that even\nthough he cannot make the claim, he would still like to, perhaps because he\nbelieves it to be true but just does not (yet) have the evidence that would\nallow him to do make it (thus obeying Grice\u2019s second \u201cmaxim of Quality\u201d:\n\u201cDo not say that for which you lack evidence.\u201d) The rhetorician Jeanne\nFahnestock, in a paper on Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca\u2019s view of style as\nargument, makes a similar observation about \u201cthe marked term being the\nless expected choice that can draw attention to itself and initiate a Gricean\nimplicature to detect intentions behind its use\u201d (\u201cNo neutral choices,\u201d 2011,\np. 36). On that principle, some hearers might reason that Bush intended\nthem to understand that he holds the claim to be true.\nConcluding on the examples considered so far, Bush bears a\nresponsibility for speaking in ways that are apt to mislead hearers as to his\nintended meaning\u2014and understanding a speaker\u2019s intended meaning is,\naccording to another seminal insight by Grice (1957, 1969), the criterion for\nunderstanding what someone\u2019s utterance means. Bush probably made a\nnumber of Americans take him to mean something that he neither asserted\nnor gave reasons for. And the people that were thus duped are only partly to\nbe blamed for it.\nFuzzy reference\nOur second suggestive mechanism is \u201cfuzzy reference.\u201d Certain phrases\nin Bush\u2019s speeches may be heard as having either a relatively vague\nreference, or a more specific one that suggests a connection between\nSaddam and 9/11; both interpretations are possible and natural. On the\nvague interpretation, Bush\u2019s sentences do not violate any maxims of\nconversation and do not become pointless. Hearers in whose minds the\nmore specific interpretation pops up thus have themselves to blame in a\nhigher degree than in the examples we have seen so far.\nIn a long speech on \u201cthe Iraqi threat\u201d we get this passage:\n(5) We\u2019ve experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen\nthat those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings\nfull of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact,\nthey would be eager, to use biological or chemical, or a nuclear\nweapon.24\n24 \u201cPresident Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat,\u201d October 7, 2002.\n309 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nWhom do the phrases those who hate America and our enemies refer to?\nHere contextual information must help the hearer work that out. Surely\nSaddam must belong to at least one of these sets, or be connected with it,\nsince the passage is part of a speech in which \u201cPresident Bush Outlines\nIraqi Threat.\u201d Are the referents of these two phrases the same sets of\npeople? If we expect a \u201crich\u201d coherence between sentences we might take\nBush to mean just that. Saddam is clearly cast as America\u2019s central enemy\nin this speech, and it is also natural to accept that he is among those who\nhate America (although in the eighties, during the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam\nwas a friend of the US and was visited by US officials like later Defense\nSecretary Rumsfeld); but if he is among those who hate America, then he is\nalso among those we know are willing to crash airplanes. We have seen\nthem do so, so the nominal phrase must include the perpetrators of the 9/11\nterrorist acts. In other words, Saddam must somehow be connected with this\nlot. That is a line of automatic reasoning that may easily be triggered by this\npassage.\nLater in the speech we have this:\n(6) The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast\noceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had\nonly hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat\nwhose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whose consequences\ncould be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein\u2019s actions have put us on\nnotice, and there is no refuge from our responsibilities.\nAgain, an impulse to hear a \u201crich\u201d connection between sentences might\nmake hearers assume that what connects the terrorists referred to in the first\ntwo sentences of (6) and the agents named in the last two sentences (Iraq\nand Saddam) is not only that they threaten Americans, but also that there is\na personal overlap between them. This understanding may be strengthened\nby the phrase Saddam Hussein's actions, since it is plausible, in the context,\nto hear this phrase as referring to Saddam\u2019s supposed part in 9/11.\nThe last two examples demonstrate that definite nominal phrases are\npotent devices for suggestion. In the following passage too a definite\nnominal phrase may put a hearer\u2019s mind to work to identify a specific\nreferent:\n310 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\n(7) \u2026 the best way to secure the homeland is to chase the killers down,\none at a time, and bring them to justice. (Applause.) And that's what\nwe're going to do.25\nThe date is December 2002; Bush and his staff are campaigning for an\ninvasion of Iraq. That makes it natural for hearers to assume that the\nproposed invasion is the same as the plan to chase the killers down, since\nthat is what we\u2019re going to do. But then Saddam and Iraq become in some\nsense co-referential with the definite noun phrase the killers. The definite\narticle, as used here, normally requires that the killers are already known to\nhearers as killers. Where would hearers have that knowledge from? An\nobvious answer is: from 9/11.\nLater we get this:\n(8) (\u2026) out of the evil done to this country, is going to come incredible\ngood (\u2026)\nThe evil done to this country surely refers to 9/11; the good probably\nrefers to the imagined results of a war against Saddam. The causal claim\nthat this good comes out of that evil makes much more sense to hearers if\nthey assume that the phrase about evil also refers to something Saddam was\ninvolved in\u2014in this case, 9/11.\nOn February 13, Bush said this:\n(9) The terrorists brought this war to us\u2014and now we\u2019re taking it back\nto them. (Applause.)26\nHere, the terrorists and them are surely coreferential; them is anaphoric,\nas Halliday and Hasan (1976) would say. Since them, uttered at this point in\ntime, clearly means Saddam and his regime, whom the US is preparing to\nattack, it also seems natural to hear the phrase about the terrorists as\nreferring to, or including, Saddam\u2014unless both the terrorists and them are\ntaken to refer very broadly to, say, all terrorists in the world.\nIn all these examples of fuzzy reference, and many similar ones, we find\nambiguous nominal phrases which may or may not be taken to identify\nSaddam as involved in 9/11; another term for the same phenomenon might\nbe \u201csemantical underdeterminacy\u201d (Atlas 2000). Even when these phrases\nare interpreted in the vague sense they do not flout any conversational\n25 \u201cRemarks by the President in Terrell for Senate and Louisiana Republican Party\nLuncheon,\u201d December 3, 2002.\n26 \u201cPresident Salutes Sailors at Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville,\u201d February 13, 2003.\n311 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nmaxims; so hearers who hear a more specific reference to Saddam should\nrealize that they are letting themselves be duped.\nSuggestive sentence collocation\nJeanne Fahnestock devotes the fourth section of her monograph on\nRhetorical Style to \u201cpassage construction.\u201d This term comprises concepts\nsuch as coherence and cohesion (Halliday and Hasan 1976), \u201cgiven/new,\u201d\nand \u201ctopic/comment.\u201d As a motto for the section she quotes the 18th\nCentury rhetorician George Campbell\u2019s classic work The Philosophy of\nRhetoric (1776) as saying that \u201cas there should always be a natural\nconnexion in the sentiments of a discourse, there should generally be\ncorresponding to this, an artificial connexion in the signs. Without such a\nconnexion the whole will appear a sort of patchwork and not a uniform\npiece\u201d (from the chapter on \u201cConnectives Employed in Combining the\nSentences in a Discourse\u201d; Fahnestock 2011, p. 345).\nThis is a clear anticipation of Grice\u2019s thinking about implicatures\u2014the\npoint being that if hearers (or readers) do not perceive an \u201cartificial\nconnexion,\u201d i.e., explicit \u201cconnectives\u201d (coherence-signaling devices) in a\ntext, then it will be natural for them to try to construct a \u201cnatural connexion\nin the sentiments\u201d (i.e., in the semantic meaning) of the discourse because if\nsuch connection is absent, the text will appear a \u201cpatchwork and not a\nuniform piece.\u201d\nThis is in fact an apt description of the third type I will discuss of\nsuggestive mechanisms in Bush\u2019s rhetoric on Iraq. Here, where we have to\ndo with \u201cpassage construction,\u201d i.e., with collocations of sentences, the\nhearer bears even more responsibility for hearing what is not said than in\nthe first two types. It is a default expectation, as both Campbell, Grice and\nFahnestock are aware, that collocated sentences in well-written texts cohere\nsemantically; but just how much coherence across sentences and what\nspecific semantic ties the speaker has intended is partly guesswork on the\nhearer\u2019s part.\nConsider these sentences:\n(10) The entire world has witnessed Iraq\u2019s eleven-year history of\ndefiance, deception and bad faith.\n312 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nWe also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On\nSeptember the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability\u2014even to threats\nthat gather on the other side of the earth.27\nIt is a clear possibility to hear all three sentences as describing the\nactions of the same agent, namely Saddam\u2019s Iraq; on the other hand, the\npassage does not violate any conversational maxims when not heard like\nthis. In the same speech, we get this:\n(11) We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-\nmaking and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after\nSeptember the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the\nterrorist attacks on America.\nHere two sentences are not just collocated but conjoined with and. That\nconjunction is rich in potential meanings. One might say, for example, that\nGrice\u2019s Maxim of Relevance prompts us to hear conjoined sentences as\nmaximally relevant to each other, and/or jointly relevant to some\nencompassing purpose or direction. But a hearer\u2019s mind is likely to wonder:\nrelevant in what way, for what purpose, in what direction?\nLevinson states that \u201cwhen events are conjoined, they tend to be read as\ntemporally successive and, if at all plausible, as causally connected\u201d (2000,\np. 122). In fact, a temporal reading of and is clearly possible; moreover, one\nmay read both sentences as relevant support for an unsaid conclusion to the\neffect, for example, that Saddam is a villain. But a causal reading is also\ninviting: Iraq has been training terrorists; the 9/11 terrorists were among\nthem, and that caused Saddam\u2019s regime to celebrate their act\u2014this is how\nsuch an interpretation might go. On the other hand the passage is still\nmeaningful when not heard like this.\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s speeches before the Iraq invasion contain many\npassages where similar phenomena are in evidence. Sentences referring to\n9/11 repeatedly rub shoulders with sentences referring to Saddam. Those\nwho heard these statements as implicating that Saddam was involved in\n9/11 bamboozled themselves; but Bush and his speechwriters gave them\nample opportunities to do so.\nConclusion\nIn 2007, a group of communication scholars (John et al., 2007) issued a\ncall that has not yet, I believe, been adequately answered:\n27 \u201cPresident Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat.\u201d\n313 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nResearch that examines with analytical precision the specific\nmechanisms of Implication of September 11, al Qaeda, and Saddam used\nby Bush in his public communications, as well as how these implications\nwere buttressed by public claims of other administration members, is an\nimportant task for future scholarship. (p. 207)\nMore specifically, John et al. said: \u201cUsing threat rhetoric, Bush over\ntime adroitly associated terrorists such as al Qaeda, which evoked the\nhorrors of September 11, with Saddam and Iraq, without necessarily\nconnecting the two directly\u201d (2007, p. 207). Also they pointed out:\nIn 2006, two national polls showed that more than 40 Percent of\nAmerican adults still believed Saddam was involved in September 11.\nThe president and his administration denied ever making any such claim,\nand nowhere in these texts did Bush directly say Saddam supported\neither the September 11 attacks or al Qaeda. However, our findings\nconfirm the view expressed by growing numbers of critics that the\nimpression was conveyed, even implied, by the rhetoric of Bush and his\nadministration. The result was a political advantage for the\nadministration and Republicans, but the cost was a misinformed public\nand a political discourse that pushed\u2014largely unchecked by those in the\nmainstream\u2014toward war with Iraq. (John et al. 2007, p. 212)\nWhat is said here clearly motivates studies like the present one. Many\nhave felt that the Bush administration\u2019s public communications somehow\nconveyed the assumption that Saddam was involved in 9/11, although he\nnever made that direct claim (declaring that he couldn\u2019t); but the exact\nmechanisms by which they did it have remained less illuminated.\nSteuter & Wills (2008) report that Frank Luntz, a communication\nconsultant for the Bush administration, wrote a memo in June 2004,\nadvising Bush to justify the war in Iraq indirectly, rather than directly,\navoiding arguments about preemption and relying instead on references to\n9/11. The memo was titled Communicating the Principles of Prevention &\nProtection in the War on Terror and offered advice on what language to use\nin referring to the war in Iraq:\nHis advice was to connect the war on terror to the war in Iraq by\nensuring that \u201cno speech about homeland security or Iraq should begin\nwithout a reference to 9/11.\u201d Luntz\u2019s recommended phrases such as \u201cIt\nis better to fight the War on Terror on the streets of Baghdad than on the\nstreets of New York or Washington\u201d and \u201c9/11 changed everything,\u201d\nbecame staples of Republican rhetoric. (Steuter and Wills 2008, p. 14)\n314 Inception: How the Unsaid May Become Public Knowledge\nThe examples in this paper provide good reasons why citizens in a\ndemocracy should learn about the automatic (or if you prefer, \u201csubliminal\u201d)\nimpact of political discourse on audiences\u2019 minds. There are several\nrhetorical devices that depend on automatic cognitive mechanisms in\naudiences. Practicing rhetors (such as Presidents and speechwriters) use\nthem routinely and skillfully; rhetorical critics may notice them and point\nthem out, and they should. Concepts and insights inspired by work in other\ndisciplines such as linguistic pragmatics may help them do so more\nexplicitly and with more nuance and a better basis for pronouncing critique\nand caution. The devices studied above are apt to create phony public\n\u201cknowledge\u201d in our minds, or as rhetoricians might say, dubious doxai\u2014\nwithout our conscious knowledge.\nREFERENCES\nAtlas, J.

The student\nshould be encouraged to apply the model as an assessment criterion and, at\nthe same time, as a heuristic tool during her work on the paper. This\ninvolves a \u201cmacroscopic\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to the evolving draft,\nnot a \u201cmicroscopic\u201d analysis of individual passages. The paper suggests a\nnumber of class activities that will help students apply a \u201cMacro-Toulmin\u201d\nview to their own work.\nFaculty across all departments, perhaps especially in the liberal arts\nsubjects, have trouble teaching students what an academic paper is, and\nhow to write it. Central to the problem is students\u2019 difficulty with \u201ctask\ndefinition\u201d (Flower et al. 1990), i.e., in making the appropriate \u201ctask\ninterpretation\u201d (Nelson, 1990). Another way of saying this is that what\nmany students lack is not the motivation or even the ability to write good\nacademic discourse, but an understanding of the genre of the academic\npaper. They fail to understand one or more of the following: the overall\npurpose of the academic paper, its components, and how the components\ncontribute to the overall purpose.

A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nstudents alike. To argumentation scholars, there is nothing new in using the\nToulmin model for pedagogical purposes; however, its use in general\nargumentation courses is, in many people\u2019s experience, very debatable\u2014a\nview also taken in Fulkerson\u2019s comprehensive discussion (1996), with\nwhich we tend to agree. But what we shall suggest in this paper is that the\nmodel, while not particularly successful in general argumentation\npedagogy, is highly useful precisely when it comes to teaching academic\nwriting.\nIn our view, the main problem with the Toulmin model in relation to\ngeneral argumentation from everyday life is that it sends students searching\nfor warrants in texts where the warrant, ever so often, is simply not there.\nInstead, such texts often contain multiple grounds or data for the claim they\nsupport. Armed with Toulmin\u2019s model, students tend arbitrarily to label\nsome of these \u201cwarrants\u201d and others \u201cdata,\u201d but they often realize that there\nis no real difference in status between the elements thus labelled\u2014and\nconfusion ensues.\nA better approach, but still a problematic one, is to point out that\neveryday argumentation is often based on tacit \u201cassumptions\u201d of a general\nkind. Toulmin\u2019s model may then be invoked, with \u201cwarrant\u201d serving as a\nsynonym for such assumptions. This is the approach taken in one of the\nbetter argumentation textbooks, John Gage\u2019s The Shape of Reason (1991).\nHowever, the explicit formulation of other people\u2019s tacit assumptions\u2014\nwhat many argumentation theorists call \u201creconstructing\u201d the argument\u2014is,\nwe believe, a questionable practice, especially when it amounts to\nformulating those unstated premises that will make the argument\ndeductively \u201cvalid\u201d (cf. van Eemeren et al.1993).\nBut the typical absence of stated warrants in everyday argumentation is\nprecisely one of the major features that separate it from argumentation as it\nis supposed to be in academic papers. Thus, what amounts to a weakness in\nthe Toulmin model when applied to the analysis of ordinary argument is a\nstrength when we use it as a tool in teaching the academic paper. We\ncontend that students\u2019 problems with genre and task definition in the\nwriting of academic papers may be significantly helped if we adapt the\nmodel to explain what the genre requirements of the academic paper are.\nThe adaptation implies that we use the model in a macroscopic way\u2014\nhence our neologism, \u201cMacro-Toulmin.\u201d We suggest that we should use the\nmodel to attack the difficulties of the academic paper top-down, saying to\nstudents, \u201cThe overall purpose, components, and inner functioning of an\n318 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nacademic paper as a whole can be better understood by means of this\nmodel.\u201d\nWhat this means in practice is that the student is encouraged to apply the\nmodel as an assessment criterion and, at the same time, as a heuristic tool\nduring her work on the paper. The idea is not to use it microscopically,\nlooking at individual sentences in her text and checking for data or warrants\nfor claims that occur (or do not occur) in them. This is the way the model is\noften used in attempts to adapt it to the analysis of everyday argumentative\ntexts. Instead, we suggest that the student should learn to apply the model to\nher evolving draft in a top-down manner, asking herself, \u201cDoes my draft\ncontain material that will fit into each of the six categories represented by\nthe model?\u201d As a general rule we suggest that a \u201cdefault\u201d good academic\npaper contains material representing each of the six categories. The\naccompanying graph (see next page) will illustrate how.\nAs the figure suggests, the Claim in a typical academic paper is\nsomething that will often be located in the conclusion. This feature,\nincidentally, is one that often annoys non-academic readers, who\n(understandably) expect to be told or at least warned from the outset what\nthe drift of the paper is going to be. Wise instructors, especially in academic\nsub-genres that come close to non-academic writing, such as literary\ncriticism, comply with this expectation by asking students to offer the\nreader some pre-understanding of their line of argument in the Introduction.\nBut in many academic papers, perhaps most, the claim cannot be located in\none or two single passages. Even so, a good paper does make a claim. It\nshould not merely be the kind of paper that many students write, and which\nsome are even required to write, titled \u201cAn Analysis of ... .\u201d Such a paper is\nnot a valid instantiation of what academic research is about; rather, it can be\nseen as an exercise that sharpens a skill necessary for doing \u201creal\u201d papers,\ni.e., real research work. A good paper is not merely an \u201canalysis\u201d of\nsomething; it may use analysis as a tool, but its end is to make a point or\nclaim.\n319 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nData Qualifier Claim\n- from authorities in the field - signals how - usually presented in Conclusion,\n- from studies by others definitely and but may be anticipated in\n- from one's own study, e.g., how Introduction, Problem Statement,\ntextual evidence, categorically Hypothesis, and/or Discussion\nconceptual analysis, the writer sections\nempirical data wishes to\nadvance her\nclaim\nWarrant\n- the writer has used a field-\nRebuttal\ndependent, general method of\ngetting from Data to Claim whose - statement and discussion of\nlegitimacy the paper's intended what might count against the\naudience will acknowledge method\nBacking\n- statement and discussion of what\nkind and degree of legitimacy the\nmethod has\nThere are many criteria that the claim in an academic paper should live\nup to, more than can be discussed here; but the first criterion is simply that\nthe claim should be there. The student should have something to say\u2014she\nshould make a statement that is hers, not just reiterate or summarize\nstatements made by the scholars she has studied.\nThe second category is, of course, Data. It usually constitutes the body\nof the paper. Basic criteria for the data include: 1) Data should support the\nclaim. 2) Data that are irrelevant to the claim should be omitted. 3) Data\nthat the student can be expected to know, and which might serve to\nundermine or qualify the claim, should be discussed.\nData may be of at least three kinds; what a specific paper, including the\npresent one, has to present by way of data is often a combination of all three\ntypes:\n1) Theoretical data, i.e., theories, concepts, definitions drawn from\nauthorities, either esteemed individuals (for example, \u201cHabermas says ... .\u201d)\nor current paradigms (for example, \u201cit is generally assumed in Generative\nGrammar ... \u201d). Such general assumptions belonging to a current paradigm\nthat the writer subscribes to are often presupposed rather than stated.\n320 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\n2) Specific data, drawn from studies by others.\n3) Specific data, drawn from one\u2019s own study.\nSpecific data may include, according to field: textual evidence,\nconceptual analysis, examples, qualitative or quantitative empirical data,\nand many more.\nThe Warrant category: One of the defining features, perhaps the\nconstitutive feature, of academic writing is that the writer should carefully\ndiscuss the warrant for the data she presents. Debaters in practical argument\nare generally not required to do so, and rarely do it\u2014which is part of the\nreason why we find it so hard to teach the proper understanding of warrant\nin practical, extended argument. What happens when students try to apply\nthe Toulmin model to instances of practical argument is often that they\narbitrarily label some of the statements in the text \u201cdata\u201d and others\n\u201cwarrant,\u201d while other students analysing the same text may have applied\nthese labels the other way around.\nIn academic writing, as opposed to practical argument, the notion of\nwarrant has much more meaning. This will be clear when we specify that\nwhat we propose to call warrant in academic writing is what academics\noften refer to as method. The method in a piece of research can be defined\nas its manner of collecting, selecting, and interpreting data. A given\nacademic field allows and makes possible the use of certain types of data,\nand it prescribes ways these data may or may not be interpreted.\nIn some fields the methods are few, strictly defined and rigorously\nadhered to. In other fields, it is common that new studies give methodology\na slightly new twist, e.g., by suggesting new types of data (as, for example,\na new type of qualitative interview). In such cases it is essential that the\npaper clearly explain how these data are collected, selected, and interpreted.\nIt may be that the method is drawn or at least inspired by studies in a\nneighbouring field; the method may also be a combination of traditional\nfeatures, borrowed or adapted features, and new features. By codifying how\nto interpret data, methods constitute the bridge between data and claim; and\nthis is why warrant is really another word for method.\nLike warrants, methods are field-dependent. In fact, warrants or methods\nare not only field-dependent; they are actually constitutive of fields. The\nmastery of the codes we call method or warrant is at the heart of what\nconstitutes professional competence in any academic field. Bazerman\n(1981) presents an instructive study of how professional competence in\n321 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nthree highly separate academic fields is largely constituted by differing\nnorms as to what counts as warrants in the respective fields.\nBacking, according to Toulmin, is what we come up with if we are asked\n\u201cwhy in general this warrant should be accepted as having authority\u201d (1958,\np. 103). That is, the \u201cbacking\u201d category should be represented by statements\nabout how and why we are justified in adducing and interpreting the data\nwe offer in support of our claim. And that implies discussing and defending\nnot only this way of interpreting, but also the way we collect and select our\ndata. Here again we have various options. We may refer to authority, either\n\u201cauthority figures\u201d (here again, Habermas may be our example) or a current\nparadigm that sanctions such an interpretation; or we may point to parallel\nstudies where a similar or related method has borne fruitful and reliable\nresults. The synonym generally used for what the model labels backing is\ntheory.\nRebuttal indicates \u201ccircumstances in which the general authority of the\nwarrant would have to be set aside\u201d (Toulmin 1958, p. 101). The criterion\nthat there has to be something in the rebuttal category means that the paper\nmust show awareness of what counts against allowing the step from data to\nclaim. Hence the rebuttal category is connected to the warrant category;\nnotice that rebuttal in this sense does not include data that seems to count\nagainst the claim; such data should be discussed in the paper as well, but\nbelong in the data category, as mentioned above.\nRebuttal may take many forms, according to field. On a very general\nlevel, a specific study might lead to the kind of fundamental problems of\ntheory or paradigm known to many fields, for example as to whether the\nstudy of human phenomena is better or worse off by limiting itself to the\nobservation of behaviour, or whether introspection is allowable or\npreferable, and the like. In other situations, there might be specific\nquestions, of either a theoretical, a practical or even an ethical nature, which\nmight be raised to question the warrant of the data used.\nWhat we see generally is that awareness of what might count in rebuttal\nof one\u2019s method of interpreting is central not only to the merit of an\nindividual paper, but also to the professional competence and identity of the\nwriter.\nTaken together, the three elements Warrant, Backing and Rebuttal\nconstitute what we might call a full-blown statement and discussion of\nMethod. Depending on how known and accepted that method is by the\nintended audience, the categories Backing and Rebuttal may be represented\n322 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nby more or less material. The liminal case is research papers written so\nsquarely within a paradigm accepted by the intended audience that the\nwarrant may be taken for granted. This may be so, for example, in certain\nschools of literary criticism where the use of biographical data in the\ninterpretation of texts by a given writer is seen as a matter of course\n(whereas other schools, as is well known, do not take that view at all). Here\nwe may in fact see papers consisting exclusively of data and claim\u2014and\nperhaps some instantiation of the last of the six elements in the model: the\nqualifier.\nThe Qualifier, in Toulmin\u2019s own words, indicates \u201cthe strength\nconferred by the warrant\u201d on the step from data to claim. For the academic\npaper, this means that the student should discuss or at least signal how\ndefinitely and how categorically she wishes to advance her claim. There\nneed not be any separate passage that can be labelled \u201cqualifier\u201d; more\noften a certain amount of qualification is indicated along the way by means\nof phrases like \u201cthis rather strongly suggests\u201d or \u201ca plausible interpretation\nwould be.\u201d\nWe believe that the Toulmin model, thus interpreted, may not only help\nstudents understand the definition of the task of that problematic genre, the\nacademic paper; it may also be a procedural help to them in producing such\npapers: While work on the paper is in progress, the student may use the\nmodel as a criterion for assessing material already in the draft, as well as a\nheuristic for inventing material still missing\u2014by asking, \u201cWhat have I got\nin this draft to fit into each of the categories represented in the model?\u201d\nThus, the model may help giving an awareness of the overall function of the\ngenre, as well as of its component parts. Also, just as it may help in\nassessing one\u2019s own writing-in-progress, it may also help students read and\nassess academic writing by others.\nIn our experience, the main pedagogical advantage of using the Toulmin\nmodel as a macroscopic layout of the academic paper is that it increases the\nstudent\u2019s sense of the paper as one focused or functional unity. Students get\na better understanding of what intimidating words like \u201cdata,\u201d \u201cmethod,\u201d\nand \u201ctheory\u201d refer to if they understand more clearly what these elements\ndo. This in turn helps them tie the components of their paper together. This\nis also true on the verbal level, where we may see an increased and more\ndiscriminating use of meta-discourse\u2014signposts telling the reader how the\nparts of the text work together.\nOn the level of substance, students may, for instance, suddenly realize\nhow theories may supply the Backing that legitimizes or even prescribes a\n323 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\ncertain methodological choice; this again may help them collect, select, and\ninterpret the material that constitutes their data. They may realize the\nvarious functions that theory may have in academic discourse, which may\nin turn help them generate theoretical ideas of their own and give them a\ncritical understanding of what goes on in professional debates within a field.\nA functional awareness of Backing and Rebuttal may help them make a\nClaim that is no greater than their data will plausibly permit, and with the\nappropriate degree of qualification. Students realize how important it is for\nthe plausibility of their claim that Method is made explicit (Warrant),\nlegitimized (Backing) and scrutinized (Rebuttal). Essentially, students may\nlearn to assess critically the merit of their own work\u2014a skill high in the\nBloom hierarchy of educational goals. This in turn may help them assess\nstrengths and weakness in the work of others, either their peers or\nestablished authorities in their field.\nMany students have difficulty applying theories in a critical and\nconstructive way. This, we believe, is especially so in those fields in the\nhumanities where methodological considerations are usually implicit rather\nthan explicit, e.g., literary criticism. Student papers in these fields often\nleave the impression that theories are adduced, not in order to strengthen the\nwriter\u2019s argument, but in order to please the instructor. Students whose\npapers seem to use theories in this way may benefit from seeing how\ntheories function in an overall argumentative plan; they may realize that\ntheories matter to method, both as legitimization and as criticism. And they\nmay see that theories themselves may be subject to analysis in terms of\nargument structure.\nFinally, approaching the academic paper as one argument may benefit\nstudents by heightening their awareness of the uses of metadiscourse to\nsignal the overall plan of a paper. As noted by, among others, Prosser and\nWebb (1994), the presence of meaningful metadiscourse significantly\nmakes for higher grades; Hyland (1998) has shown how meta-discourse in\nacademic writing functions not only as a help for the reader to understand\nthe intended structural relations within the paper, but also text-externally,\n(i.e., relations to discourse outside the text itself), by alluding to\npresupposed disciplinary assumptions and by helping the reader construct\nappropriate contexts.\nAdmittedly, the approach to the paper as one and just one argument is a\npedagogical simplification. Many academic papers can better be described\nas making several claims, either parallel or hierarchically arranged (or a\ncombination of both). Still, the model has the pedagogical advantage of\n324 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nfacilitating novices\u2019 overall understanding of the genre, as well as of the\nspecific paper they are working on. In our experience, the model does not\ninhibit creativity; instead, the overview of the paper\u2019s constituent parts that\nthe model affords often allows students to improve further on its design.\nWe have used the model in teaching academic writing in a variety of\nformats. In the most basic version, it is possible, in a one-hour period, to\nintroduce the model and offer a few examples of its elements with reference\nto excerpts or projects contributed by students in the class. A more spacious\nformat is a seminar of two separate three-hour sessions. This allows for\nmore elaborate presentation of the model, more extensive exemplification\nfrom students\u2019 papers in progress with class discussion, and some exercise\nactivities, of which we will describe a few.\nActivity: Early Claim Formulation\nThis is the instruction given to the class for this activity:\n1. Write freely for 8-10 minutes on \u201cthe essence of my papers is ... \u201d\n2. Boil down the essence of your paper to one sentence\u2014either a\nstatement or a question.\n3. Based on this sentence, state the claim of your paper. To help you\ndo this, ask yourself the following question: \u201cIf I were to hand in\nthis paper to-morrow, what would my conclusion be?\u201d\n4. Read aloud\u2014let us all hear what claims in research papers may\nsound like.\n5. (Optional question to the class:) Which of these claims would you\nchoose to base a paper on?\nActivity: Analysis of Model Examples\nWe generally use fairly short excerpts from selected student papers\n(max. 3 pages, preferably with line numbers). These papers are not by\nparticipants, but it is still important to use student papers so as to encourage\nthe response \u201cWhatever they can do, I can do.\u201d After silent in-class reading,\neveryone is instructed to locate claims, data, warrant, rebuttal, backing, and\nqualifiers. The aim is to teach students to identify the various elements,\nwhich are not always separate or neatly marked off, and assess the balance\nin the argument as a whole\u2014e.g., will this set of data support a claim as\nlarge as this, is there enough backing, shouldn\u2019t the qualifiers be stronger?\n325 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nThis activity is a useful exercise before analysing the participants\u2019 own\npapers-in-progress.\nActivity: The Devil\u2019s Advocate\u2014Critical Assessment of Argumentation in\nOthers\nThe class looks closely at the argumentation in a paper and discusses\nwhether each element is sound in itself, and whether the elements are in\nharmony. As an aid in this discussion, a checklist with these questions is\nhanded out:\n\uf0b7 What is the main claim? Given the argumentation presented in the\npaper, is it reasonable to make this claim?\n\uf0b7 From where is data drawn to support the claim? Is the data credible\nand sufficient?\n\uf0b7 What is the warrant, i.e., what method is used? Has the method\nbeen used in a sound way?\n\uf0b7 What problems are there in connection with this method? What\npossible rebuttals are there?\n\uf0b7 Why is the method applicable? What backing is there that may\neliminate or minimize the effect of the rebuttals?\n\uf0b7 How certain may we be of the soundness of the claim when we\nconsider rebuttals and backing? In other words, what kind of\nqualification is called for?\nActivity: Apply the Model to Your Own Paper-in-Progress\nThis activity plays a large role in our seminars. We have developed the\nfollowing rubric, which we ask students to fill in with answers relating to\ntheir own papers-in-progress. If they are able to fill in all the slots and find\nthat the elements are in reasonable balance, then the paper is probably on\nthe right course. We find that this rubric has a capacity to get many students\ngoing. Some realize that they have a great deal more material in the right\nplaces then they thought, while others are confronted with holes that should\nbe filled, or with a claim that needs modification, etc.\nQuestions on the overall argument in my paper. (Model examples, drawn\nfrom an archaeology paper, are given in italics.)\n326 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nClaim: \u201cWhat is my claim at this point in the writing process?\u201d\nModel example: The ancient city of X has directly influenced the\narchitecture of city Y. Hence, there must have been a migration\nfrom X to Y.\nMy paper: \u2026\nData: \u201cWhat will I use as data for this claim?\u201d\nModel example: The bricks used in X and Y are identical to the\nmillimetre.\nMy paper: \u2026\nWarrant: \u201cWhat is my warrant (what method will I employ)?\u201d\nModel example: Description of how I will proceed as to selection of\nsamples, measurement, number of bricks selected, etc.\nMy paper: \u2026\nRebuttal: \u201cWhat may be said in rebuttal of this method (what makes it\nproblematic)?\u201d\nModel example: Only one parameter is used. The identity, rather\nthan suggesting an influence, could be a coincidence.\nMy paper: \u2026\nBacking: \u201cWhat supports the warrant (the use of this method), in spite of\nrebuttal(s)?\u201d\nModel example: It is extremely unlikely that such a similarity could\nbe a coincidence, hence an influence must have taken place: the\nbricks must come from he same mould.\nMy paper: \u2026\nQualifier: \u201cGiven the rebuttal and backing cited above, I expect to make\nmy claim with the following qualifier.\u201d\nModel example: It is highly probable that a migration has taken\nplace from X to Y, but\u2026\nMy paper: \u2026\nIn our experience, students benefit particularly from analysis and\nassessment of argumentation in model excerpts drawn from papers in the\ntop third of the scale. In one and the same process, students are trained in\napplying the model, recognizing well-made academic argumentation, and\nmaking critical but constructive assessment of each other\u2019s work. Thus, this\n327 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nactivity may be used in the early part of a course, and it may be a help even\nfor novice writers of academic papers.\nSpecial non-credit courses, featuring activities such as those described\nabove, are not the only way to heighten students\u2019 awareness of the\nacademic paper as a genre. In \u201ccontent\u201d courses, especially on the more\nadvanced levels, there will be frequent opportunities to apply the model to\nheighten students\u2019 awareness of the demands of the genre.\nFor example, it is customary in such courses to include excerpts from\nscholarly books, papers from journals, etc., as required reading in\ncoursepacks or the like. As a rule, such readings are discussed only for the\ncontent, i.e., the results, theories, or ideas that they present. However, the\ninstructor may also make a point of discussing such readings with regard to\nhow they relate to the argument model.\nFor example, in history courses where actual historical studies in the\nform of journal articles or book chapters are studied, it will be relevant to\ndwell on passages where the writers discuss the validity of their sources.\nSuch passages, in which some of the key skills that constitute \u201chistorical\nmethod\u201d are called for, usually represent the \u201cwarrant\u201d category. The\nsources used are, of course, the data. The claim is the historical\ninterpretation derived from the sources.\nIn papers reporting empirical studies, it will generally be easy to locate\npassages where the elements of the model are in evidence. Often there is a\nseparate \u201cMethod\u201d section, which will usually contain most of the\n\u201cWarrant\u201d material in the paper. The theory underpinning the study, i.e., the\nBacking, may often be found in the introductory section, and/or under the\ndiscussion of Method. The Claim may be found near the beginning in the\nform of a hypothesis, and in the \u201cDiscussion\u201d section in the form of an\nactual claim. Often, the Discussion will also contain elements of Rebuttal,\nas well as material that may be identified as Qualifier. As an example,\nchosen at random, we may cite this passage from a journal article on\nadvertising (McQuarrie and Mick 1999, p. 52). In the subsection\n\u201cLimitations and Future Research\u201d (under \u201cGeneral Discussion\u201d) we read:\nWe did not demonstrate that replacing, say, the visual pun in the almond\nad with a verbal pun conveying the same brand attitude would, in turn,\nproduce the same impact on consumer response. This limits our ability\nto assert that, for instance, a pun is a pun, whether visual or verbal, with\nthe same characteristic impact.\nA propos a discussion of the points the writers are trying to make about\nvisual effects in advertising, the teacher may also point out to students that\n328 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\nsuch a passage constitutes a Qualifier, and that its presence (together with\nseveral others) increase the credibility of the article as a whole. If it is part\nof the course requirement to write a research paper, we think the teacher\nshould go out of his way to point out that the use of appropriate qualifiers,\nlike this one, is one of the criteria by which these papers will be graded.\nMore generally, in any content course there will numerous opportunities\nfor the teacher to make statements or initiate discussions on the functions\nand merits of specific passages in the course materials. This practice is a\nmodern version of what ancient rhetoricians called imitatio: we read\nimportant writers not just in order to learn what they have to say, but also in\norder to learn from them how to say what we have to say.\nAn important part of this kind of reading is to be as critical as we are\nwhen reading papers or drafts by our peers. Here, too, the teacher will\nprobably have to show the way. Statements by the teacher like: \u201cThis is an\ninteresting study, but I think part of the data is irrelevant, and the writer\nought to have discussed the following obvious objection to his method \u2026\u201d\nmay be eye-opening to students. They will realize that published research\nby esteemed scholars is not necessarily beyond reproach; that the merits of\nsuch research is not a black-or-white matter, but one in which there may be\npros and cons; and that the criteria the teacher will apply in assessing the\nstudents\u2019 own papers include these, by which he finds others to fall short.\nEven when only textbooks are being used (as opposed to actual research\npapers), it is still possible for the teacher to make observations like this:\n\u201cWhat the textbook does here is something you should never try to do in a\nresearch paper. These are two different genres. It carefully introduces and\nexplains Habermas\u2019s theory of the public sphere, but does not supply\nbacking for its application to talk shows on TV; in your paper it should be\nthe other way around.\u201d\nTo sum up, we suggest that there is indeed a use for the Toulmin model,\ndespite much frustration with it in the teaching of general argument analysis\namong faculty and students alike. Coming as it does from a philosopher and\nex-scientist, it is perhaps not surprising that more than anything it models\nthe ideal case of academic argument. Moreover, we suggest that its real\nusefulness is only brought out when we give up applying Toulmin\u2019s labels\nmicroscopically to individual sentences and phrases in existing texts\u2014and\nturn it upside down, as a tool for searching a text top down for material\nrepresenting each of the categories. Finally, what we propose is using the\nmodel as an aid in production rather than in analysis, i.e., as a set of criteria\nto guide the tentative unfolding of a paper-in-progress. What it does in that\n329 A Good Paper Makes a Case: Teaching Academic Writing the Macro-Toulmin Way\ncapacity, judging by the responses of the hundreds of students who have\nattended our non-credit seminars, is to furnish them with an understanding\nof the academic paper as one kind of purpose-driven speech act.\nREFERENCES\nBazerman, C. 1981.

It is argued that a\n\u201cgeneralized\u201d version of the system would be useful today as a resource for\nthe production and assessment of argumentation about matters of shared\nconcern in a society\u2014not just as an aid for defendants in criminal cases.\nOne generalizing move suggested is to integrate the sub-system known in\nantiquity as the \u201cstatus legales,\u201d treating it as a subcategorization of the\nsecond of the \u201cstatus rationales\u201d: that of \u201cdefinition.\u201d A second\ngeneralizing move is to see the resulting conceptual system as a taxonomy\nof disagreements and controversies of all kinds that may occur in a society:\nethical, political, etc.\u2014not just criminal accusations. The paper suggests\nthat those who learn to think about disagreements with this taxonomy in\nmind will be better able to understand what ongoing controversies are\nessentially about; however, it may also be a resource for debaters, helping\nthem focus their argumentation on those points where they stand the best\nchance of persuading opponents.\nIntroduction: Public debate as trench warfare\nWhen debaters disagree, it is important to understand the exact nature\nand scope of their disagreement. Each debater has an interest in knowing\nthe precise reasons that make his opponents disagree with him, because if\nhe wants some of his opponents to change their minds, those are the reasons\nhe should try to refute. The onlooker, too, has an interest in knowing them,\nbecause they are probably the reasons that will best help him decide for\nhimself.\nHowever, public debaters often misrepresent and widen their\ndisagreements. They distort each other\u2019s standpoints and reasons,\n*Originally published in Bending Opinion: Essays on Persuasion in the Public Domain, T.\nvan Haaften, H. Jansen, J. de Jong, and W. Koetsenruijter (Eds.). Leiden University Press,\nLeiden, 2011, 81-94. Reprinted with permission of the Publisher.\n332 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nrepresenting them as either bizarre or toothless (two subtypes of the \u2018straw\nman\u2019 fallacy). Or they ignore the opponents\u2019 real reasons and attribute\nimaginary reasons to them. They speculate on their opponents\u2019 base, hidden\nmotives. Often they see an opponent as part of a large, monolithic block, so\nthat he is either a member of a conspiracy or at least a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d.\nAttacks on the opponent\u2019s ethics, intellect, and personality often follow.\nPartisanship and polarization flourish. Debaters see their own standpoint as\nrepresenting righteousness, while any divergent standpoint is seen as\nopposite, usually in a dichotomous sense: there are no third positions, no\nneutral ground. This way, political and social debate may resemble trench\nwarfare as in the First World War. In both, we can see a typical widening of\nthe front zone where the two parties clash.\nFor onlookers who look to debates for enlightenment to choose a\nstandpoint there is little help. They would be better served if the debate\nwould focus on those smaller sectors of the front where debaters crucially\ndisagree, and where a true breakthrough might most likely occur. Litigation\nlawyers know the need to focus their argument on potentially decisive\npoints and present a coordinative argumentation rather than a multiple set of\nunconnected reasons\u2014to use the terminology of Franciska Snoeck\nHenkemans (2000). Interestingly, an empirical study of televised political\ndebates where representative audiences voted on issues before and after\neach debate showed that here too the coordinative strategy is superior: what\nwe called \u201csingle ground\u201d debaters performed significantly better in terms\nof votes than \u201cmultiple ground\u201d debaters (J\u00f8rgensen, Kock and R\u00f8rbech\n1994; 1998, this volume, Chapter 12). Readers of a famous essay by Orwell\n(1946) will know that to shoot a mad elephant (as young Orwell once had\nto) one should place one bullet in the exact right spot with great force. A\nsimilar piece of advice seems to be sound regarding deliberative argument.\nStatus theory as a focusing tool\nAncient stasis (status) theory was a tool to help forensic debaters focus\ntheir case. The central part of the theory was the status rationales: the\nconjectural, the definitional, and the qualitative, equivalent to the questions:\nWhat are the facts? How are the facts to be categorized? What particular\ncircumstances characterize them?\nThese status rationales question the facts at issue, but another main part\nof status theory was the status legales, which question the laws by which\nthe facts were to be judged.\n333 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nUsually, four types of disagreement are mentioned. In all of them the\ndebater argues that there is no clear one-to-one match between a law and a\nfact. Ratiocinatio is when there is no norm that meaningfully covers the\nfact, so we must reason by analogy from existing norms about something\nelse. Ambiguum is where there is one relevant norm that may cover the\nfact, but it is ambiguous or abstract. In scriptum et voluntas there is also one\nrelevant norm, but this time it is too specific; it may literally cover the fact,\nbut the argument is that we should read the spirit of the law, not the letter.\nFinally, contrariae leges is where two or more norms which may cover the\nfact, but they point to different conclusions.\nNotice that here we pass logically from cases with no applicable norms,\nto cases where one norm may apply, which is either too abstract or too\nspecific, to cases with more than one applicable norm.\nAncient status theories also included lists of so-called \u201cpractical issues,\u201d\nsuch as legality, justice, advantage, feasibility, honor, consequence. All\nthese are examples of relevant norms (or norm systems) that may\nlegitimately be invoked in social and political argument, but they are\nmutually heterogeneous, i.e., the set of relevant norms is\n\u201cmultidimensional,\u201d and hence the norms will necessarily tend to clash. For\nexample, a debater might support a policy as advantageous; another might\noppose it as dishonourable. This is the practical parallel to the issue of\ncontrariae leges. But the main components of the status system\u2014the status\nrationales and the status legales\u2014were intended for legal argument; they\npresupposed the existence of explicit, formal rules (leges), which were\nmeant to cover the facts of the case, i.e., to correlate ius and factum.\nI suggest a way to generalize and integrate all these strategies into one\nscheme which can help identify and narrow down the decisive reasons not\njust in legal argument, but in deliberative argument as well, that is, in any\nsocial disagreement over action. Such a scheme might help clarify, for\ndebaters and onlookers alike, what current disagreements are essentially\nabout, and in particular what they are not about.\nWe should note that the differences between legal and political argument\nare not absolute. Legal argument often relies on informal norms used in\npractical reasoning; political argument often invokes legal considerations.\nBoth kinds are about action\u2014legal argument is about legal action in\nresponse to past acts, political argument is mainly about future action but\nalso about evaluating and modifying past acts. In both cases acts are being\nsupported or opposed with reference to norms of right action, which\nfunction as \u201cwarrants,\u201d to use Toulmin\u2019s term (1958). The difference is\n334 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nmainly that legal norms are typically written statutes which are recognized\nas valid and operative by all; norms underlying political argument are\nusually informal, unwritten and not always recognized as valid by all, or to\nthe same degree. Also, they are most often implicit rather than explicitly\nstated, and they are more heterogeneous or \u201cmultidimensional\u201d than legal\nnorms: some may be purely prudential and are perhaps only concerned with\neconomic consequences; others may be virtue-ethical norms about moral\nconduct, fairness or justice; others again are in fact formal and legal, for\nexample considerations as to whether a policy is constitutional.\nApplying status theory to social and political argument\nStatus theory is a typology of the problems we may meet in correlating\nnorms and facts, and since these problems are analogous in the two fields, I\npropose we use status theory to consider not just legal argument, but social\nand political argument as well.\nFor this purpose, I further propose to integrate the status legales in the\nstatus rationales. In the status of definition, we discuss how a fact can be\nsubsumed under a norm. The status legales are about the same kind of\ndiscussion, but they start from the other end: the norms. The reason they are\nuseful is that they specify the problems raised by the correlation of norms\nand facts. Finally, I also propose to include the \u201cpractical issues\u201d of political\nargument among the many norms that are invoked, implicitly or explicitly,\nin political argument.\nSo this is how we may integrate and generalize the various components\nof ancient status thinking into a comprehensive typology of disagreement in\nsocial debates. 1) We generalize the formal legal concept of \u201claws\u201d into a\nbroader, more varied concept of norms. 2) We see the status legales as\nspecifications of the ways in which the correlation between facts and norms\nmay be contentious. 3) We use the \u201cpractical issues\u201d to specify some of the\nvaried norms that may clash in social debates.\nThe complete, integrated status system for practical debates is given in\nthe following table (see table on pp. 338-339). I have named the cells with\nletters and number, filled in some terms drawn from ancient status theories\nand supplied examples for the different types of disagreement. We will look\nat some of these. (Notice that the table also contains examples and\ncomments not cited in the text of this paper.)\nBut you may ask, Why do all this? Is this meant to be a better\ninterpretation of what ancient rhetoricians meant? No, I propose it as a\n335 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nuseful tool for handling current social and political disagreements. If public\ndebaters and audiences would think about disagreements in terms like these,\nthey might better avoid the characteristic widening of disagreements where\ndebaters impute imaginary standpoints, policies, reasons, intentions and\npersonality features to each other. With greater awareness of the specific\ntype of disagreement in a particular case, debaters may be more conscious\nof the norms that their own argument relies on, and of those on the other\nside.\nLet us look at some of the types of disagreement that our generalized\nand integrated version of the status system specifies. Those that primarily\ncall for comment are those representing the four status legales, seen as\nspecifications of the status finitionis (C5-F5 in the table). This is where the\ntraditional system of status rationales is most notably enriched; the status\nconjecturae and the status qualitatis, on the other hand, are defined and\nsubdivided by the present scheme in the same way as we find in ancient\ntheory (more specifically that of Hermogenes).\nIf for example the disagreement is one where no pre-existing norm\nclearly and indisputably applies (cell C5 in the table), then that\nunderstanding might be a starting point for a discussion where both parties\ncollaborate to find a relevant norm. Issues where such a search for relevant\nnorms is indicated concern such \u201cnew\u201d phenomena as are currently\nemerging in fields like bioethics and information technology: Cloning of\nhigher organisms and stem cell research are activities where there is\nindeterminacy as to what categories may relevantly apply to the entities in\nquestion\u2014and hence there are also quandaries as to what exisiting norms, if\nany, may relevantly apply to them. Various forms of digital file sharing are\ntechnological phenomena which, at least according to some, fundamentally\nquestion existing norms relating to property and intellectual rights, thus\nnecessitating the formulation of new norms.\n336 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\n1 Classical 1.

The philosopher\nGeorgia Warnke (1999) has written about this sort of \u201cinterpretive\u201d\ndisagreement. The abortion issue in the United States is a prime example;\nthe problem is that the participants in that debate do not realize it. Both\nsides are surely \u201cpro life\u201d as well as \u201cpro choice,\u201d but the disagreement is\non whether the removal of a new foetus, or fertilized egg, constitutes the\ntaking of a human life, and whether a woman\u2019s choice to have a new foetus\nremoved from her body can be seen as her own choice.\nDisagreements belonging in cell E5 are those where a strict and literal\nunderstanding of a norm (either written or unwritten) is opposed by one that\nwill read a different underlying spirit into that norm. For example, anti-\nabolitionists in the debate on slavery in the US in the Nineteenth Century\nwere apt to believe that the words in the Declaration of Independence about\n\u201call men\u201d being \u201ccreated equal,\u201d when read in the right spirit, did not really\napply to black slaves, although they admittedly saw them, in a certain sense,\nas men.\nAgain, two disagreeing debaters in the abortion controversy might find\nthat they mutually endorse the other side\u2019s interpretation of the norms that\nare invoked. Then we have a dispute belonging in cell F5: there is\nagreement on two relevant norms which in the specific case point to\nopposite conclusions, and the crucial point is now whether the argument\nrelying on one of these norms can be made to appear weightier than the\nargument relying on the other.\nColumn F in the table is the deliberative counterpart of contrariae\nleges\u2014cases like those where two or more normative concepts are used as\nwarrants on opposite sides. We face such issues all the time. The invasion\nof Iraq was supported by some with reference to defence against terrorism,\ndissemination of democracy and the need to overturn tyrants, but it was\nopposed by others with reference to its non-compliance with international\nlaw, the loss in human and material terms, and the dangerous chaos that\nwould be its likely consequence.\nAll of these considerations were in some sense potentially relevant to the\nissue, so we had a case of what Carl Wellman (1971) and Trudy Govier\n(1987, 2004) have called \u201cconductive reasoning,\u201d i.e., we must somehow\nweigh the pros against the cons. Such situations exemplify the \u201cvalue\npluralism\u201d propounded by Isaiah Berlin (1998, 2002), that is, the\n339 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nunderstanding that several norms may be relevant to a given issue, but\nargue for opposite decisions\u2014and this not only between two disagreeing\ndebaters, but also inside the mind of an individual. Other philosophers have\nrecently emphasized the \u201cincommensurability\u201d that obtains between such\nnorms, which implies that it cannot be objectively determined whether one\nor the other norm should have priority because the relevant norms belong to\ndifferent dimensions (see, e.g., Raz 1998, and Kock 2003; this volume,\nChapter 6). In legal argument the status of contrariae leges describes such\nsituations, and if we apply status thinking to social disagreements we are\nreminded that similar contradictions are common there as well, probably\nmore so.\nBesides value pluralism and incommensurability, another concept that\nmay be illuminative in polarized debates about controversial issues is that\nof normative metaconsensus. The political theorist John Dryzek defines it\nas \u201cagreement on recognition of the legitimacy of a value, though not\nextending to agreement on which of two or more values ought to receive\npriority in a given decision\u201d (see, e.g., Dryzek & Niemeyer 2006, p. 639).\nIn the Iraq debate, both supporters and opponents of the invasion might\nprobably agree on values such as spreading democracy as well as respecting\ninternational law. The dispute would then be narrowed down to one about\nthe priority, in the specific case, of one norm over the other; that is, there\nwould be normative metaconsensus. Normative metaconsensus might also\nbe said to exist between the two sides in the abortion debate. Life and\nchoice are two values that both sides recognize, and their dispute is either\none of interpretation because both these notions are vague, or one of\npriorities.\nIn proposing to apply status thinking to deliberative disputes I do not\nsuggest that we can expect consensus on issues like the ones I have\nmentioned. The belief that rational argumentative discourse will necessarily\nlead to consensus (or towards consensus) has been championed by\nHabermas in philosophy and by political theorists such as Elster (1986). In\nargumentation theory, the pragma-dialectical school builds on the\nhypothetical assumption that the purpose of all argumentation is for the\ndiscussants to resolve their dispute. But as John Rawls and others have\nmaintained, there are reasons why people may not ever agree on issues\nwhere values are involved; hence his term \u201creasonable disagreement\u201d\n(1989, 1993). One of these reasons is precisely the fact that people may,\neven within the bounds of reasonableness, interpret values differently; this\nis the main idea in Georgia Warnke (1999). Another reason that people may\n340 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nprioritize values differently; or, in the terminology of Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca (1969), their value hierarchies differ.\nNevertheless, although consensus cannot, for these reasons, be expected\nto emerge, in some cases it actually might, and of course that would be\nwelcome. But in the absence of consensus, to realize that there is normative\nmetaconsensus is also an achievement. It would reveal that a dispute is not\nalways an all-out clash between monolithic blocks that reject each other\u2019s\nvalues. Thus it would help narrow down the scope of the disagreement and\nfocus everyone\u2019s attention on where it actually is rather than on where it is\nnot. The polarization and the trench warfare we often see in public debates\nwould lose some of their fuel. Moreover, debaters on both sides might find\nmore persuasive arguments for their views. The status system in antiquity\nhad this kind of purpose. The reason it might work like that is that it helps\nus focus on the decisive points of disagreement. If one could change\nopponents\u2019 minds about those, then one might change their minds about the\nwhole issue. Similarly for undecided onlookers. They too would more likely\ntake our side if we were to focus on the decisive point of disagreement and\nmake them accept our case on that precise point.\nTo complete the picture, let us briefly consider the types of disagreement\nrepresented by the cells G5-L5. In G5, we have issues where a norms is\nrecognized, but where the presence of \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances is\ninvoked to justify the suspension of that norm. For example, during the\nNazi occupation of various European countries, including my own country,\nDenmark, many individuals known or assumed to be informers against\nmembers of the resistance movements were summarily liquidated by\nresistance men. No law or social norm was invoked to justify these killings\nor the fact that no legal steps were taken against them after the war, only the\ncompletely exceptional nature of the situation was invoked.\nCell H5 represents issues of a partly similar nature, including the use of\n\u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d and physical pressure bordering on torture against\nso-called \u201cillegal combatants\u201d captured in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Whereas\nin G5 cases the basic norm outlawing the liquidation of one individual by\nanother is simply suspended by exceptional circumstances, in H5 cases\nthere is more of a weighing of contradictory norms against each other, with\none being regretfully \u201cbent\u201d because trumped by another, based on self-\ndefence.\nCases represented by cells I5-L5 show gradually increasing degrees of\nrecognition of the norm that is being broken: In I5 cases, the victim of the\nnorm breach is cited as giving cause for it and deserving retaliation (\u201cthey\n341 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nasked for it\u201d). In J5 cases, no degree of mitigation of the norm breach itself\nis sought, yet the perpetrator seeks acquittal or at least mitigation for\nhimself by seeking to shift the blame to a third party, supposedly so\npowerful that no alternative was available for the perpetrator (\u201cwe were\nunder orders\u201d). In K5 cases the perpetrator admits his transgression and his\nresponsibility for it, yet he seeks mitigation in the fact that, e.g., the victim\nhad long tormented or provoked him\u2014a circumstance that may indeed\nexplain and even mitigate the transgression but never justify it. Finally, in\nL5 the perpetrator fully recognizes the transgression and his own\nresponsibility, seeking mitigation only as an act of mercy, following his\navowal of guilt and contrition. This strategy may be exemplified by former\nPresident Clinton\u2019s words, \u201cI misled people, including even my wife. I\ndeeply regret that\u201d (words which came after a series of attempts at some of\nthe strategies discussed above).\nLet me reiterate that what I see as the most useful feature of this\nproposal to generalize status theory to everyday disagreements is the\nintegration of the four status legales as a series of specifications of how we\nmay disagree about the definition or nature of the act we debate. As an\nexample, consider the debate on the Muhammad cartoons published by a\nDanish newspaper in 2005. In October of 2008, the debate was revived in\nanother newspaper between its editor, T\u00f8ger Seidenfaden, a leading critic of\nthe cartoons, and Frederik Stjernfelt, a well-known academic (Mogensen\n2008). Seidenfaden argued that the cartoons were an act of gratuitous\noffence denying due empathy to a domestic minority not deserving such\ntreatment, namely all those Muslims in Denmark who are peaceful and want\nintegration, and thus the cartoons were likely to set back integration.\nStjernfelt, a self-declared enlightenment thinker, argued that the cartoons\nwere part of a global struggle for freedom of speech, against special rights\nfor cultural groups, and he rebuked Seidenfaden for wearing \u201dblinkers\u201d and\nseeing only \u201cthe tiny Danish corner\u201d of the issue, ignoring the global\naspects.\nAs an onlooker, I cannot help wondering why these two debaters, both\nhighly articulate and intelligent men, did not see more clearly the\nsimultaneous relevance of two contradictory norms, both of which they\nprobably both support. In other words, there was normative metaconsensus\nbetween them, but they did not realize it. Stjernfelt persisted in assuming\nthat opposing the cartoons constituted a betrayal of the principle of free\nspeech, and rejected the relevance of the \u201cgratuitous offence\u201d argument as\n\u201ctiny\u201d; Seidenfaden, on the other hand, appeared similarly insensitive to the\n342 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nglobal context, where some Muslims in fact acted violently to curtail\nfreedom of speech, and he was unwilling to concede that the cartoons might\nrelevantly be seen in that context\u2014in which the domestically-based\ncriticism of them (and of the Danish government\u2019s no-comment attitude to\nthem) might appear as a failure to stand up for free speech. As an onlooker,\nI find it obvious that the quarrel between the two sides in this debate was\nnot about any one of them betraying one or the other of the norms invoked\n(empathy with deserving minorities and free speech, respectively), but\nabout how to interpret these norms, how they were relevant to the case, and\nin particular what relative weight or priority should be assigned to them. In\nother words, the disagreement was primarily an instance of the deliberative\ncounterpart of contrariae leges (cell F5), with elements of interpretive\ndisagreement (cell D5)\u2014and the debaters should have realized that, or have\nbeen made aware of it. As a general principle, I would argue that onlookers\nlooking for guidance on a controversial issue are let down by a debate\nwhere each debater only insists on the exclusive relevance of his \u201cown\u201d\nfavoured norm. What might have helped onlookers more would be mutual\nrecognition by the opposite sides that contradictory norms are relevant, plus\na motivated bid from each side as to why its favoured norm should be given\npriority in the case at hand.\nEven more generally, I suggest that democracies like ours need a greater\nawareness among debaters, audiences, journalists and educators that social\ndisputes should not be seen as all-out clashes along enormous front lines,\nbut may usually often be narrowed down to focused disagreements on more\nspecific, but also more potentially persuasive points. I suggest that the\ninsights contained in status theory as presented here can help promote such\nan awareness. Let us not be like the two lovers in Matthew Arnold\u2019s famous\npoem \u201cDover Beach,\u201d who feel that \u201cwe are here as on a darkling plain/\nSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, / Where ignorant armies\nclash by night.\u201d\n343 Generalizing Stasis Theory for Everyday Use\nREFERENCES\nBerlin, I. 1998.

Rhetoricians tend to think that we use public\ndiscourse to do certain things for us with words. Rhetoric is a practical\nsubject, which also implies that it is normative: it will teach us, not only to\ndo certain things with words, but also to do these things well with words.\nBecause rhetoric is about doing things well with words, it is also central to\nit that we should always be very aware of what we are trying to do, for we\ncan do many different things with words, and they need to be done with\ndifferent words; in general rhetoric teaches us that the function a message\nis meant to serve very largely determines all the properties that the message\nshould have, which again implies that messages meant to serve different\nfunctions will have very different properties.\nRhetoric is not just a subject about how each individual can do his or her\nown thing with words, sometimes at the expense of others. It also holds that\nwe have language and communication to perform certain vital functions in\nsociety. Rhetoric has always been seen by some of its practitioners as the\nongoing public discourse that has helped establish human societies and hold\nthem together; society would not have existed without the constant\nworkings of rhetoric. In fact, the way rhetoricians figure that is that they\nbelieve that if everyone is enabled and allowed to do their own things with\nwords, then that is the way in which the interest of society is best served.\nToday, the media are the forum where public discourse is conducted. It\nfollows that we should criticize the media when they fail to perform this\nfunction, and we should try to suggest how they could do it better.\nBy taking this stance toward the media, rhetoric distances itself from a\ncouple of other positions that are strongly represented in today\u2019s academic\n* From Nordicom Review 25 (2004: 1-2) (Special issue), 103-110. See no. 15. Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nworld. In Critical Discourse Analysis and similar orientations there is, as in\nRhetoric, an emphasis on the utterance and its specific properties, and on\nhow discourse is always an attempt to further the encoder\u2019s interests; but\nthere is also, inspired by Foucault, a constant assumption that public\ndiscourse serves to maintain a hegemony, that is, to preserve and extend\npower structures.\nThe strong suit of Critical Discourse Analysis, as practiced by\nFairclough and others, is its meticulous observation of verbal messages\nrevealing how even the smallest linguistic features of public messages may\nwork to impress a view on us\u2014a view which fits the agenda of the ruling\npowers. Critical Discourse Analysis, as Fairclough and others define it, is\nan astute attempt to incorporate linguistic analysis into social science so as\nto understand the transformations of modern capitalism. So basically,\nCritical Discourse Analysis is a purely descriptive pursuit. There is no\ntheory of how public communication ought to be in order for it to fulfil a\nconstructive role in society. There seems to be no theory of public\ncommunication as a necessary factor in a modern coherent society, no\nnotion of a constructive function for public discourse at all.\nRhetoric, in contrast, is based on the premise that public discourse is\nbeneficial and indeed necessary in human societies\u2014but not any kind of\ndiscourse. Rhetoric shares with Critical Discourse Analysis the wish to\nlook very closely at utterances in the public sphere and to analyse what they\ndo and how they do it, but Rhetoric believes that there is good discourse\nand bad discourse, i.e., some properties of public discourse will hinder and\nsome will serve the functions for which public discourse in needed. Hence\nRhetoric is informed by the wish to identify these properties and to suggest\nor demand specific changes in current social discourse practices.\nThere are other voices in the study of public communication which also\nrepresent a purely descriptive stance, but with an orientation that is a far cry\nfrom the systematic suspicion of the critical discourse analysts. Polemically,\none might refer to these other scholars as uncritical analysts in that they\nseem to have taken it upon themselves to defend the media en bloc against\nany criticism. The outstanding British-American scholar Pippa Norris, it\nmight be argued, is a representative of this trend. In her recent book, A\nVirtuous Circle: Political Communications in Postindustrial Societies\n(2000), she broadly dismisses what she refers to as \u201cmedia malaise\u201d and\ndemonstrates with a wide battery of empirical data that there is a\nconsistently positive correlation between attention to the news media and\npolitical knowledge, trust and participation. Hence, runs the argument, we\n347 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nshould not \u201cblame the messenger\u201d but should look elsewhere to understand\nand confront the more deep-rooted flaws in current representative\ndemocracy.\nBut it is hardly surprising that there is a positive correlation between\nmedia use and political engagement; how could it be otherwise? Still this\nobvious fact does not acquit the media from any criticism of how, and how\nwell, they perform their social functions. As a rhetorician one must find it\ndisappointing that a media scholar like Norris never descends from the\nbird\u2019s-eye-view to look at specific types or even instances of political\njournalism. Also it is striking that Norris and other leading media scholars\nrefrain from entering into any normative judgments; she has nothing to say\nas to which types of political journalism might be better than others in some\nway, nor as to types of political debate or engagement. Such media studies\ncan be of very little help both to society and to the media themselves.\nIn contrast to these two broad orientations, which we may polemically\ncall the paranoid and the obsequious, a rhetorician looks at public\ncommunication and the media with a functionalist eye. It recognizes that we\nneed public communication for society to exist at all, and it asks not only:\n\u201cHow well does public communication perform the social functions it is\nmeant to perform?\u201d but also: \u201cHow could it perform them better?\u201d\nA trend in media studies that rhetoric has much in common with is uses-\nand-gratifications theory. Rhetoric shares with it the notion that utterances\nare used for different, specific purposes. However, uses-and-gratifications\ntheory assumes, optimistically and individualistically, that each user selects\nand uses media content for his or her individual purposes. Rhetoric takes\nthe social angle: how can we have communication that will perform these\nsocial functions for us? As a result, rhetoricians look closely at specific\nproperties of media content, often with a view to how it could be different,\nwhereas uses-and-gratifications theory, in a much broader approach,\ndescribes what each medium, considered as such, is used for.\nRhetoric acknowledges that the function of verbal communication is\nmainly to impress our views and our will on others. However, its view of\ninterpersonal communication has more to it than this. If citizens have the\nmeans and the opportunity to make a case for their views in open debate,\nthen that is the best way to build a human society that will endure.\nWhat we are talking about here is often called the deliberative function\nof public communication. Deliberation actually means to weigh something,\nas on a pair of scales, and what we weigh when we deliberate is decisions.\n348 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nWhere decisions are concerned you cannot prove anything, i.e., make a\nlogically \u201cvalid\u201d case one way or the other; instead, you have to see if you\ncan increase your audience\u2019s adherence to your proposal. It follows that the\nbest we can do in public debate is to make sure that the best reasons on both\nsides of a case are heard, understood and given attention.\nThe criteria for public debate just given have several implications.\nPublic communication on politics should give much attention to the reasons\nthat may be offered for or against a proposed policy. Hence, rhetoricians\nwould, for example, look critically at the ways in which the media present\nreasons for a decision to go to war. Do the media, in particular, manage to\nmake the available arguments on both sides of the issue accessible and\nunderstandable to the public? Also, rhetoric would look carefully at how\nspokespersons on each side of an issue make their case, and what treatment\nthey in turn are given by the media. For example, it would expect would-be\ndeliberative debaters to acknowledge legitimate arguments on the opposite\nside. Good reasons should be stated, heard and attended to, also by those\nwho disagree. One important complaint against the way politicians and\nother decision makers argue is precisely that they tend to suppress, ignore\nor distort the reasons that the opposite side has to offer\u2014especially the\ngood ones. The media should try to make politicians attend to good reasons\noffered by the other side, and media critics should watch that the media do\nso. This is because the necessary function of deliberative debate is to\nidentify, in Aristotle\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe available means of persuasion\u201d (cf.\nRhetoric 1355b) on both sides, thereby helping audiences form their own\nreasoned standpoints.\nAs an example of how scholars with a rhetorical approach would look at\nthe media and their performance, we might consider the studies that\nKathleen Hall Jamieson and Joseph Cappella presented, in their book Spiral\nof Cynicism (1997), of how the media reported the political activities\naround a possible health care reform in the US during the early years of the\nClinton presidency. What Jamieson and Cappella found was essentially that\nthe media, instead of focusing on \u201cissues,\u201d i.e., the problems facing the\nAmerican health care system, their possible solutions and what cases could\nbe made for them, focused overwhelmingly on \u201cstrategy,\u201d i.e., the moves of\nthe warring parties and political figures in the legislative process. The view\nof politics underlying this kind of coverage is that, as a general assumption,\npoliticians are driven by a wish to preserve and extend their personal power,\nnot by ideas about what policies are best for society. Further, Jamieson and\nCappella argued that this strategic focus was instrumental in bringing the\n349 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nlegislative process to a deadlock so that no reform came about. The book\npresents a series of studies suggesting that strategic coverage of specific\nissues tends to infect media users with a general cynicism regarding the\nentire political process; also, that media users do not want or demand\nstrategic coverage of politics to nearly the extent that media people think\nthey do, and that as cynicism grows, so does also public distrust of the\nmedia themselves\u2014hence the term \u201cspiral of cynicism.\u201d\nRegina Lawrence (2000) did a further study of the dysfunctional\nworkings of political coverage in the media, showing how media, in the\nphase where a piece of legislation was still in the making, would\nconcentrate on the strategic aspects of the political process; only after it was\nmade effective would they begin to describe how it would affect citizens.\nThere are several other empirical data which suggest that the media and\ntheir users do not see eye to eye as to what aspects of politics political\njournalism ought to focus on. In a 1999 study of the presidential election in\n1996, two University of Connecticut researchers found that the way the\nmedia covered that election was grossly out of touch with how voters\nwanted it covered (Dautrich and Hartley 1999). Consistently throughout the\ncampaign, voters found that the media focused too much on candidates\u2019\npersonalities, on \u201chorse race\u201d and on strategy and tactics, but too little on\ntheir standpoints on issues, on the effect if either of them were elected, and\non the views of third parties.\nFor two years I directed a project financed by the Danish Newspapers\nAssociation to investigate current and alternative ways of doing political\njournalism in print media. The project is reported in the book Forst\u00e5\nverden: Politisk journalistik for fremtiden (Frederiksberg:\nSamfundslitteratur, 2002). In one study, I did a content analysis of all\narticles in the Danish daily newspapers about the budget negotiations for\nthe year 2000. The articles, it turned out, were mainly about strategic\nmaneuvering by the various parties involved in, or excluded from,\nnegotiations about the upcoming budget. In addition, there was a good\nnumber of articles about minor, controversial items or proposals, many of\nwhich never materialised. But there was virtually no coverage of the overall\nstructure of the budget, for example the fact that out of the 400 billion\nkroner in the Danish state budget, the vast majority is bound by other laws\nand hence untouchable, whereas less than 10 billion may in fact be shifted\nabout in budget negotiations. But what, then, are the purposes for which we\nset aside nearly all of our national household money? How big are these\nprograms in relation to each other and in relation to corresponding accounts\n350 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nin other countries? Which have grown most, and why? Why does a rich\nnation not have enough for health, education, and care for the elderly? How\nmuch do we spend on these accounts, by the way? In short, what are we\nspending our household money on? These are the questions that traditional\nbudget negotiation coverage in newspapers leaves unanswered. Imagine a\nfamily living in similar ignorance of what their available income is spent\non.\nMoreover, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that newspaper\nreaders or even TV audiences actually want the coverage of national budget\naffairs to be the way it traditionally is.\nMedia researchers ought to intervene here and point out that this is the\nway the media treat a subject like this; they might try to work out what\nusers actually feel about it, and what the objective effects of it is; and they\nmight suggest alternatives and do research to find out what users might\nthink of them.\nA group of journalism students who had heard of the critical stance our\nproject was taking towards traditional political journalism did a study to see\nwhether a sample of ordinary readers were in agreement with the media\u2019s\nown criteria as to which types of news stories they found most interesting\n(reported in the book). They constructed a list of 10 made-up news\nheadlines, five reflecting \u201ctraditional\u201d criteria of newsworthiness, and five\nwhich reflected a focus on broader structural issues. They asked political\neditors at five national newspapers and 76 ordinary readers to select the five\nstories that they would be most eager to print, respectively to read. This\nbrought out a strong discrepancy between editors\u2019 and readers\u2019 preferences.\nThe most attractive story to the editors was one that stated that the Minister\nof Culture would withdraw from politics in connection with the upcoming\nbirth of her third child. This story was the one that readers were least likely\nto read. Instead, they gave top priority to a story whose headline asked the\nquestion: \u201cEuthanasia\u2014murder or charity. We have the right to live. Should\nwe also be given the right to die?\u201d\nAn interesting wider implication of this study was that some of the\nstories ranked highest by readers were in fact not about news. Their number\n3 favourite was one whose headline said, \u201cA multicultural democracy\u2014\nEurope is the cradle of democracy, but are we willing to give immigrant\ncitizens full democratic rights?\u201d To this one editor objected that such a\nheadline was \u201cdreadfully abstract,\u201d and editors ranked this story eighth.\n351 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nThe interesting general issue here is that the media apparently do not\nnecessarily give the audience what they want. There have been many claims\nthat the media nowadays are run by money people, not by news people, and\nthat this is the reason behind much of the current media malaise. But what\nwe see in the case of political journalism is that what the media offer us is\nto a large extent not what the market forces would dictate. The forces that\ngive us cynical, horse-race-oriented, unenlightening political journalism are\nnot the market forces of public demand, but perhaps rather the forces of\njournalistic myth and orthodoxy.\nOne article of orthodox journalistic faith is precisely the cynical view of\npolitics\u2014the view of politicians as self-serving individuals whose every\naction or statement is dictated by a will to preserve or extend their power.\nThis attitude, on the one hand, supplies an explanatory framework that is\ncharacteristic of the journalistic profession; it makes the journalist who\nadopts this attitude look like a seasoned expert, someone with savvy and no\nillusions, who is not easily taken in; however, with this framework to\nexplain anything that goes on in politics, the journalist is not obliged to\nhave any substantive knowledge of any actual policy areas. For example, in\ncommenting on politicians\u2019 moves on health care legislation, the journalist\nneeds no medical expertise or knowledge of health care economics, but may\nfall back on the same type of catch-all theory as for any other area of\npolitical debate: the power struggle framework. Adopting this framework is\nthus not only gratifying for the journalist, because it gives him a distinctive\njournalistic angle on politics; it is also cheap: with this one simplistic\nframework applied to everything any cub reporter can be a professional,\nbecause he needs no real knowledge of anything. For this stance I would\nlike to suggest the term \u201cInstant professionalism.\u201d\nThe cynical view that gives political journalists Instant professionalism\nis only one of several myths that haunt the media. It is a myth in the sense\nthat contrary to what many journalists believe, it is not good for society, and\nsince readers do not particularly want it, it is not good for business either.\nAnother myth that specifically plagues newspaper journalism has to do not\nwith the ideological but with the formal or structural dimension of\nmessages. It is the myth of the \u201cinverted news pyramid.\u201d This term refers to\nthe traditional structure of news copy where everything is arranged in a\nlinear sequence, beginning with whatever has most news value and then\npresenting additional chunks of information in order of descending\nimportance. This often means: irrespective of chronology, logic and clarity.\n352 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nThe inverted pyramid is similar to the set menu at some restaurants,\nwhere the chef alone decides what we are having and in what order. Except\nthat when we read it is easier to rebel and either drop out, which is what\nmost readers do most of the time, or skip around, in which case one often\nhas to skip pretty much at random, because it is usually not possible to see\nin advance what the individual parts of the article contain.\nAs stated before, it is a key point in a rhetorician's approach to the media\nthat a given medium has several widely differing functions. Consequently,\nit makes little sense to speak of the function of that medium as such, or to\nassume that the medium as such imposes specific conditions on whatever\ncontent it is used to mediate. The function of a medium is to mediate the\nfunctions of the content that it carries. And each medium may carry many\ntypes of content, each with its own distinctive function.\nIt is clear that each medium will be better suited for certain functions\nthan for others. Still, it is a mistake to believe that a given medium, e.g.,\ntelevision, imposes certain specific requirements on all of its content\nregardless of function. For example, there has been a strong desire in TV\nprogramming to inject narrative qualities into material that is not by nature\nnarrative. This often involves an entire dramaturgy with heroes, villains,\nbuild-up, point of no return, etc. However, it is not necessarily the case that\nsuch a dramaturgy is functional in dealing with political issues, and while\nmany viewers who watch a TV documentary based on these principles may\nfeel that they are offered a strong narrative experience, they may also feel\nthat somehow they are not given a fair and useful understanding of the issue\ninvolved.\nMedia scholars might perhaps expect a rhetorician to say to them, \u201cGo\nahead, learn all the tricks of the rhetorical trade, and use them. Use\nmetaphors, symbols, tropes and figures, narrative suspense, identification\nand all the other tools that rhetoricians have identified.\u201d But no, what this\nrhetorician would say above all is, \u201cLearn all these tricks of the trade but\nalso learn to use them for what they are good for, for the functions that they\nwill serve well and not for other functions where they tend to have a\nconfounding effect.\u201d\nAn example of how rhetorical devices tend to confound some functions\nwhile pretending to serve others is a study by Michael Milburn and Anne\nMcGrail on \u201cThe Dramatic Presentation of News and its Effects on\nCognitive Complexity\u201d (1992). What they did was to show authentic,\ndramatic news stories to two groups, for example an item about election\nunrest in Chile, where one group saw the original while the other saw a\n353 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nversion with the most dramatic scenes cut out. What they found was that\n\u201cexposure to the dramatic news stories significantly decreased subjects\u2019\nrecall of the information in the stories and reduced the complexity with\nwhich individuals thought about the events reported.\u201d\nMore generally, as a rhetorician one would welcome more studies of the\nuse of visuals in news programs on TV, such as what types of visuals are\nused for particular types of content, what effects they have, for example in\nterms of recall, learning, etc., and what other types might be used, if indeed\nvisuals are necessary regardless of the type of story that is being presented.\nSimilar types of studies might be conducted on the use of visuals in\nnewspapers. One aspect of this that deserves closer study is the use or non-\nuse of graphics such as diagrams, maps, tables, etc. What are such devices\ngood for, what are they not good for, where may graphs do a better job than\npictures or verbal copy, what types are better than other types, what is\ncurrent practice, and what suggestions for reform and experimentation\nmight we make?\nThe use of graphics is one of the important but neglected issues for any\nmedium that wishes to present quantitative information about national or\ninternational issues, and even more if one wants to help readers understand\ncorrelation, causation etc. Any important political issue involves\nquantitative dimensions and question of what causes what, for example\nglobal warming, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and budget balancing. This\nis one question that cannot be left to the media themselves. For one thing,\nthe use of graphs requires specialized knowledge of statistics and mapping\ntechniques that are generally not part of journalism programs and certainly\nnot of traditional journalistic skills. Also, the proper use of any such\ncommunicative device requires empirical studies, qualitative as well as\nquantitative, for which news organizations have neither the skills nor the\nmeans. As part of our political journalism project we did a study of the\nactual use of graphs in a leading newspaper, and the results clearly suggest\nthat practical journalists grapple in the dark as to what types of graphic\npresentation of data exist, and what they can do.\nGraphics are just one example of a type of rhetorical-communicative\ndevices that is available to the media but is not used at all to serve the\nfunctions that it might. There seems to be a prejudice in the profession to\nthe effect that graphics are trite and superficial, and another to the effect\nthat they are nerdy and hence boring. So what some media have done, e.g.,\nthe American daily USA Today, is to use banal graphics that are pepped up\nwith much colour and cartoon-like artwork. What few people in the\n354 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nprofession have realized is that graphics of the type used by USA Today are\nperhaps boring because they are banal; no amount of four-colour hysterical\nartwork will conceal the fact they generally communicate nothing.\nGraphics, then, represent one aspect of media rhetoric that media studies\nmight give more attention to. By nature, they are two-dimensional and they\nmay be packed with information and even insight at a ratio that is hard to\nmatch with other means. All this suggests that they are particularly suited\nfor print media. And that brings us to the general question: which rhetorical\ndevices are particularly suited for which media?\nIn addition to this, we already have another equally general question:\nwhich rhetorical functions are particularly suited for which media? That is\nthe kind of question that our project asked itself in relation the daily\nnewspaper, especially regarding its coverage of politics. Our answer was\none that involved not only the physical makeup of the newspaper, including\nwhat we call its enormous, easily navigable user interface, but also the fact\nthat it appears once a day and once only, as well as the fact that most\nnewspapers have a long-established credibility or ethos to draw upon.\nMoreover, the newspaper is under increasing pressure as to the time readers\nwill have or want to spend on it, given competition from other media and\nactivities. All these particular conditions and constraints go together to\nsuggest that what the newspaper of tomorrow should increasingly focus on\nas far as political coverage is concerned is well-researched material that\ntries to illuminate structures and issues that are currently debated or which\nwill be in the time to come; and they should do this with an increased\nemphasis on two-dimensional devices, i.e., an array of elements, verbal or\nvisual, that illuminate separate aspects of an issue, and which are easily\nidentifiable as to what they offer. For example, it should be possible to\n\u201cread\u201d a graphic separately, or an item specifying historical background, or\na narrative item representing the human side of the issue, or an analytic\npiece predicting likely outcomes, or setting out reasons on both sides of the\nissue. All this means less emphasis on breaking news, less use of the so-\ncalled inverted pyramid in reportage, which, as a linear and purely verbal\nstructure, makes little advantage of the newspaper\u2019s two-dimensionality and\nfails to take account of readers\u2019 time constraints and reading behaviours.\nAlso it means less opinionated preaching of party lines and correct opinions\nand more respect for readers who want help to form a considered view for\nthemselves.\n355 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nAn obvious objection to all these claims would be that political\njournalism which follows these guidelines would not be read because it\nwould be boring.\nThere are two answers to this. The first is that of course it is a good thing\nnot to be boring, and the media should try to make sure that material about\nsociety and its problems is interesting. It might be argued that a piece which\nactually managed to explain something like the makeup of the national\nbudget would be scary rather than anything else, and what\u2019s scary is at least\nnot boring.\nThe second answer is that interest in this kind of material should come\nfrom its capacity to illuminate, that is, to bring insight, not necessarily from\nits entertainment quality. We all want entertainment, but many of us also\nwant enlightenment, and the two functions, as any rhetorician remembers,\nare different. Some genres are good at one of these functions; others are\ngood at the other.\nThese have been a few examples of how media experts might look\nrhetorically at the media. The main emphasis has been on that old-fashioned\nmedium that media studies perhaps tend to neglect: the newspaper. But as\nwe know there are several other media to look at, and several other\nfunctions that we would like these media to perform in society, so there are\ncountless opportunities to ask questions of the type, \u201cWhat functions should\nthis particular medium be used to serve, which ones is it particularly good\nat, for which does it have constraints that call for special solutions, which\nrhetorical devices could this medium use to perform this function? What is\ncurrent practice, and how could it be changed or reformed? What will users\nthink of such a change, and what will its effect on them be?\u201d These are what\nI, as a rhetorician speaking to media scholars, would call true rhetorical\nquestions.\nREFERENCES\n356 Rhetoric in Media Studies: The Voice of Constructive Criticism\nCappella, J.N., and K.H.
