both personally and professionally.\nWhen Bill arrived at Dalhousie University in 1979, he threw himself into intensive field work. His graduate\nstudentsbecamewellversedinfieldskillsandmanyhavegoneontoplaykeyenvironment-relatedrolesinNova\nScotia and elsewhere. Bill was a superb supervisor.\nBill authored or co-authored over 100 refereed research papers. Collectively they could be described as\nquantitative descriptions of natural and human-stressed habitats and their associated flora and fauna. Those\nstudies continue to provide invaluable reference or baseline data on the state of a wide range of aquatic and\nterrestrialsitesinaworldchangingevermorerapidlyundertheinfluenceofhumans.Manyofthequantitative\nexamples Bill provides in this book are drawn from those papers.\nA lot of Bill\u2019s earliest work focused on effects of acid rain on surface waters and forests and relationships of\naquaticplantsandamphibianstoacidity.Heventuredintoassessmentofcarbonstorageinforestswellbefore\nitbecameanimportanttopic,subjecttointernationalagreementsrelatedtoGHGs,andhewasoneofthefirst\nenvironmentalists to highlight the potential of protected areas for carbon storage. In later years, he took an\ninterest in urban ecology.

It was the first Canadian text on Environmental Science, and he updated\nit 5 times. The 6th edition was headed for publication by a prominent academic press, but delays and\nmiscommunications following his passing led Bill\u2019s spouse, George-Anne, to withdraw it and seek to have it\npublished as a free online text available from Dalhousie. I strongly encouraged that initiative in part because I\nthink no one would be happier about it than Bill.\nIt is a wonderful gift: 1097 highly readable, referenced, well-illustrated pages organized under five sections\nandtwenty-twochapters.Theliteraturecitedgoesuptomid-2015.Withtheinformationandreferencesgiven,\nit would require little effort to assemble the more recent research on any particular topic, e.g., using Google\nScholar. I think the book will be widely and well used by Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and thank\nGeorge-Anne, Dalhousie University and of course my friend and much missed colleague Bill for it being so-\navailable.\nDavid Graham Patriquin\nProfessor of Biology (retired)\nDalhousie University\nxx | Bill Freedman: an appreciation Preface\nEnvironmental Literacy\nEnvironmental literacy can be defined as: \u201cthe degree to which people have an objective and well-informed\nunderstanding of environmental issues.\u201d Today, it is extremely important to have a understanding of\nenvironmental issues. This is because the human economy is engaged in a wide range of activities that are\ncausingenormousdamagetotheecosystemsthatsustainbothourspeciesandEarth\u2019slegacyofbiodiversity.All\naroundus,thisiswitnessedbypollution,climatewarming,collapsingfisheries,deforestation,thedegradationof\nagricultural soil, extinctions and endangerment of species, and other damages.\nNevertheless,weneednotbeoverlypessimistic.Ifoursocietytakesconstructiveactionsnow,oratleastsoon,\nit will not be too late to prevent or repair many of these important environmental problems, which threaten\nthewelfareofpeopleandmostotherspecies.Withinlimits,humansareprescientcreatures,andoursocietyis\ncapable of implementing a sustainable economy that can support our livelihoods as well as healthy ecosystems.\nItisclear,however,thatanysustainableeconomywillinvolvewaysofdoingbusinessthataredifferentfrom\nthosethathaverecentlybeendominant.Itwillalsorequirefundamentalchangesinthelifestylesofmanypeople,\nespecially those living in wealthy countries such as Canada. Ultimately, such socio-economic transformations\nmustinvolvemuchlessuseofenergy,materials,andotherresources,incomparisonwithwhatmanyofustake\nfor granted today. A more respectful attitude toward the natural world is also badly needed.\nAchieving such a transformation will depend on citizens having a sound understanding of environmental\nissues. Any imposition of restrictions on access to resources will initially be uncomfortable for many people.\nNevertheless,Ibelievethatpeoplewillbemorewillingtosoftentheirlifestyleiftheyunderstandthereasonsfor\nthosechangesinthecontextofthelivelihoodsoffuturegenerationsandecologicalsustainabilitymoregenerally.\nWithsuchanunderstanding,mostpeoplewillsupporteconomicandsocialchangesthatconservethequalityof\ntheir own and future environments.\nAbroad-basedenvironmentalliteracywillbeakeyrequirementifacountrysuchasCanadaistoachievethe\ndifficult transition into an ecologically sustainable economy. Within that context, this book was developed to\nhelp Canadian students in universities and colleges to have an objective and well-informed understanding of\nimportant environmental issues.\nA Canadian Textbook\nThistextbookisintendedtoprovidethecoreelementsofacurriculumforteachingenvironmentalscienceatthe\nintroductorylevelinCanadiancollegesanduniversities.Thisbookissuitableforstudentsbeginningaprogram\nin environmental science, environmental studies, or sustainability. It is also appropriate for arts students who\nrequire a science elective, and for science students who require a non-major elective. Not many introductory\ntextbooks in environmental science are written in a way that provides a deep examination of issues that are\nparticularlyimportantinCanada,andthewaystheyarebeingdealtwithbygovernmentsandsociety-at-large.\nCanadahasuniquenationalandregionalperspectivesthatshouldbeunderstoodbyCanadianstudents,anditis\nregrettable that many of them are studying from textbooks whose focus is not their own country.\nPreface | xxi This book, however, was written from the ground-up to provide Canadian information and examples. This\nnational context is integrated throughout the text, along with North American and global data that provide a\nbroaderperspective.SpecialCanadianFocusboxesillustrateimportantexamplesofenvironmentalissuesinour\nnational context. At the same time, Global Focus boxes enhance the international context for learning about\nissues, while In Detail boxes examine particular topics in greater depth.\nApproach and Organization of the Book\nEnvironmentalsciencedrawsonknowledgeandmethodsfrommanyfieldsofthesciencesandsocialsciences,\nincluding biology, chemistry, economics, ethics, geography, geology, medicine, physics, political science,\nsociology,andstatistics.Manyenvironmentalspecialistsadoptaninterdisciplinaryapproachtointegratethese\ndifferentwaysofknowinginordertohelpunderstandandpreventenvironmentaldamage.Thisbookalsoadopts\nan interdisciplinary approach by drawing on a variety of disciplines.

As such, the\nsubject matter of environmental studies engages all forms of understanding that are relevant to identifying,\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 3 understanding,andresolvingenvironmentalproblems.Withinthatcontext,environmentalscienceexaminesthe\nscience-related implications of environmental issues (this is explained in more detail in the following section).\nThe subject matter of environmental science is the focus of this book.\nIssuesrelatedtoenvironmentalproblemsareextremelydiverseandtheyinteractinmyriadways.Despitethis\ncomplexity, environmental issues can be studied by aggregating them into three broad categories:\n1. the causes and consequences of the rapidly increasing human population\n2. the use and depletion of natural resources\n3. damage caused by pollution and disturbances, including the endangerment of biodiversity\nTheseareextremelybigissues\u2013theirsustainableresolutionposesgreatchallengestopeopleandtheireconomy\nat all scales. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the study of environmental issues should not\nbe regarded as being a gloomy task of understanding awful problems \u2013 rather, the major goal is to identify\nproblemsandfindpracticalwaystorepairthemandpreventothersfromoccurring.Theseareworthwhileand\nnecessaryactionsthatrepresentrealprogresstowardsanecologicallysustainableeconomy.Assuch,peoplewho\nunderstandandworktowardstheresolutionofenvironmentalproblemscanachievehighlevelsofsatisfaction\nwith their contribution, which is something that helps to make life worth living.\nTypical questions that might be examined in environmental science include the following:\n1. How large is the human population likely to be in Canada, or on Earth, in 50 or 200 years?\n2. How can the use of fossil fuels be integrated into a sustainable economy, in view of the fact that they are\nnon-renewable resources that do not regenerate?\n3. How can we harvest renewable resources (which do have the potential to regenerate) in ways that do not\ndegrade their stocks, such as cod in Atlantic Canada, wild salmon in British Columbia, wheat and other\ngrains in the Prairie provinces, and forest resources across much of the country?\n4. What ecological damages are caused by various kinds of pollution, such as acid rain, ozone, pesticides, and\nsulphur dioxide, and how can these effects be prevented or repaired?\n5. Are human influences affecting global climate, and if so, what are the causes and consequences of this\neffect?\n6. Where and how quickly are species and natural habitats becoming endangered or extinct, and how can\nthese calamities be prevented?\nImage1.1.PlanetEarth.EarthisthethirdclosestplanettotheSun,anditistheonlyplaceintheuniverse\nthat is definitely known to sustain life and ecosystems.

However, the work requires an\ninterdisciplinary approach that engages many disciplines in a coordinated manner. This integration is\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 5 suggested by the overlaps among the disciplinary fields.\nThis book deals with the key subject areas of environmental science. To some degree, however, certain non-\nscience topics are also examined because they are vital to understanding and resolving environmental issues.\nThese non-science fields include ethics, philosophy, and economics.\nOfalloftheacademicdisciplines,ecologyisthemostrelevanttoenvironmentalscience,andinfacttheterms\nare often confused.

Suzuki has built a worldwide following of a broad constituency of\npeople concerned about environmental damage and social equity. By doing this, he has contributed\ngreatly to the identification and resolution of environmental problems in Canada and the world.\nEarth, Life, and Ecosystems\nThe universe consists of billions of billions of stars and probably an even larger number of associated planets.\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 7 OurEarthisoneparticularplanet,locatedwithinaseeminglyordinarysolarsystem,whichconsistsoftheSun,\neight planets, three \u201cdwarf\u201d planets, and additional orbiting bodies, such as asteroids and comets.\nEarth is the third closest planet to the sun, orbiting that medium-sized star every 365 days at an average\ndistanceof149millionkilometres,andrevolvingonitsownaxisevery24hours.Earthisasphericalbodywitha\ndiameterof12,700kilometres.About70%ofitssurfaceiscoveredwithliquidwater,andtheremainingterrestrial\nareaofexposedlandandrockiscoveredmostlywithvegetation.Withsomuchofitssurfacecoveredwithwater,\none might wonder why our planet was not named \u201cWater\u201d instead of \u201cEarth.\u201d\nThe most singularly exceptional characteristic of Earth is the fact that certain qualities of its environment\nhaveledtothegenesisandsubsequentevolutionoforganismsandecosystems.Thesefavourableenvironmental\nfactors include aspects of Earth\u2019s chemistry, surface temperature, and strength of gravity.\nThe beginning of life occurred about 3.5 billion years ago, only 1 billion years following the origin of Earth\nduring the formation of the solar system.

This makes Earth an\nextraordinarily special place. We can consider the universe at various hierarchical levels (Figure 1.2). The scale\nranges from the extremely small, such as subatomic particles and photons, to the fantastically large, such as\ngalaxies and, ultimately, the universe.\nFigure 1.2. Hierarchical Organization of the Universe.\n8 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans Life on Earth occupies intermediate levels of this hierarchy. The realm of ecology encompasses the following\nlevels:\n1. individual organisms, which are living entities that are genetically and physically discrete\n2. populations, or individuals of the same species that occur together in time and space\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 9 3. communities, or populations of various species, also co-occurring at the same time and place\n4. landscapes and seascapes (collectively, these are ecoscapes), which are spatial integrations of various\ncommunities over large areas\n5. and the biosphere in its entirety, which is composed of all life and ecosystems on Earth\nSpecies and Ecosystems\nAspeciesisdefinedasindividualsandpopulationsthatcanpotentiallyinterbreedandproducefertileoffspring\n(see Chapter 7).

Even the biosphere can be viewed as being a single ecosystem.\nEcological interpretations of the natural world consider the web-like connections among the many\ncomponentsofecosystemsinaholisticmanner.Thisecosystemapproachdoesnotviewthesystemasarandom\ngroupingofindividuals,populations,species,communities,andenvironments.Rather,itconfirmsalloftheseas\nbeingintrinsicallyconnectedandmutuallydependent,althoughinvaryingdegrees,andalsoashavingemergent\nproperties (In Detail 1.1).\nAn important ecological principle is that all species are sustained by environmental resources: the \u201cgoods\nand services\u201d that are provided by their ecosystem. All organisms require specific necessities of life, such\nas inorganic nutrients, food, and habitat with particular biological and physical qualities. Green plants, for\nexample, need access to an adequate supply of moisture, inorganic nutrients (such as nitrate and phosphate),\nsunlight,andspace.Animalsrequiresuitablefoodsofplantoranimalbiomass(organicmatter),alongwithhabitat\nrequirements that differ for each species.\nIt is important to understand that humans are no different in this respect from other species. Although\nthis dependence may not always seem to be immediately apparent as we live our daily lives, we nevertheless\ndependonenvironmentalresourcessuchasfood,energy,shelter,andwatertosustainourselvesandourlarger\neconomies.\nIt follows that the development and growth of individual people, their populations, and their societies and\nculturesarelimitedtosomedegreebyenvironmentalfactors.Examplesofsuchconstraintsincludeexcessively\ncoldordryclimaticconditions,mountainousorotherwiseinhospitableterrain,andotherfactorsthatinfluence\nfood production by agriculture or hunting.\nHowever, humans are often able to favourably manipulate their environmental circumstances. For example,\ncropproductivitymaybeincreasedbyirrigatingagriculturalland,byapplyingfertilizer,orbymanagingpests.\nIn fact, humans are enormously more capable of overcoming their environmental constraints than any other\nspecies. This ability is a distinguishing characteristic of our species.\nThe human species is labelled by the scientific term Homo sapiens, a two-word name (or binomial) that is\nLatin for \u201cwise man.\u201d Indeed, humans are the most intelligent of all the species, with an enormous cognitive\nability (that is, an aptitude for solving problems). When humans and their societies perceive an environmental\nconstraint, such as a scarcity of resources, they often have been able to understand the limiting factors and\nto then use insight and tools to manipulate the environment accordingly. The clever solutions have generally\ninvolvedmanagementoftheenvironmentorotherspeciestothebenefitofhumans,orthedevelopmentofsocial\nsystems and technologies that allow a more efficient exploitation of natural resources.\n10 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans Humans are not the only species that can cope with ecological constraints in clever ways. A few other\nspecies have learned to use rudimentary tools to exploit the resources of their environment more efficiently.\nForexample,thewoodpeckerfinchoftheGalapagosIslandsusescactusspinestopryitsfoodofinsectsoutof\nfissuresinbarkandrottingwood.Chimpanzeesmodifytwigsandusethemtoextracttermites,afavouritefood,\nfrom termite mounds. Egyptian vultures pick up stones in their beak and drop them on ostrich eggs, breaking\nthem and allowing access to the rich food inside.\nA few such innovations or \u201cdiscoveries\u201d by other species have even been observed.

The feeding tactic became widespread and was even adopted by several other species, such as the blue tit.\nCream-eating was a clever innovation, allowing access to a new and valuable food resource.\nAlthough other species have developed behavioural changes that allow more efficient exploitation of their\nenvironment, none have approached the number and variety of innovations developed by humans. Moreover,\nno other species has developed a cumulative expertise for exploiting such a broad range of resources. And no\notherspecieshasmanagedtospreadtheseadaptivecapabilitiesasextensivelyashumanshave,inanincreasingly\nglobal culture. Unfortunately, humans also have developed an unparalleled ability to degrade resources and\necosystems and to cause the extinction of other species. The intense damage caused by humans and our\neconomy is, of course, a major element of the subject matter of environmental science.\nIn Detail 1.1. Systems and Complexity\nTheconceptofsystemsisimportantinthehierarchicalorganizationofenvironmentalscience.Forthis\npurpose,asystemmaybedefinedasagrouporcombinationofregularlyinteractingandinterdependent\nelements that form a collective entity, but one that is more than the mere sum of its constituents. A\nsystem can be isolated for purposes of study. Systems occur in various spheres of life, including the\nfollowing:\u2022biosystems, whicharerepresentedbyanyofthelevelsoforganizationoflife,rangingfrom\nbiochemistrytothebiosphere\u2022ecosystems,whicharebiosystemsthatconsistofecologicalcommunities\nthat interact with their environment as a defined unit \u2022 economic systems, or integrated activities\nthat produce goods and services in an economy \u2022 socio-cultural systems, which consist of ways that\nspecialized people, information, and technologies are organized to achieve some goal \u2022 and numerous\nothers,includingmusicalsymphonies,physicalartsuchaspaintings,andforthatmatter,thewordsand\ndata in this book\nNote,however,thatthesevarioussystemsarenotmutuallyexclusive.Forexample,anagroecosystem\nincludes elements of biosystems, ecosystems, and socio-cultural systems.\nSystems have collective properties, which are based on the summation of their parts. One such\npropertymightbethetotalnumberoforganismspresentinadefinedarea,whichmightbemeasuredas\nthe sum of all of the individual plants, animals, and microorganisms that are estimated to be present.\nSystems also have emergent properties, which are revealed only when their components interact to\ndevelop functional attributes that do not exist at simpler, lower levels. For example, harmonies and\nmelodies are emergent properties of music, as occurs when vocalists, a drummer, a bass and lead\nguitarist,andakeyboardplayerofarockbandallintegratetheiractivitiestoperformasong.Emergent\nproperties are complex and may be difficult to predict or manage.\nBiologicalsystems provide numerous examples ofemergentproperties (seeChapter9).Forexample,\ncertain kinds of fungi and algae join together as a life form known as a lichen, which is an intimate,\nmutually beneficial relationship (a mutualism). The biological properties of a lichen are different from\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 11 thoseofthepartnerspecies(whichcannotliveapartinnature),andtheyareimpossibletopredictbased\nonly on knowledge of the alga and the fungus.\nSimilarly, assemblages of various species occurring in the same place and time (an ecological\ncommunity)developemergentpropertiesbasedonsuchinteractionsascompetition,disease,herbivory,\nand predation. This complexity makes it difficult to predict changes caused by the introduction of\na new disease or predator to a community (including the harvesting of certain species by humans).\nAssemblages of communities over large areas, known as ecoscapes, also have emergent properties, as\ndoes the biosphere as a whole.\nEmergent properties are extremely difficult to predict and often emerge as \u201csurprises,\u201d for example,\noccurringwhenecosystemsarestressedbysomehumaninfluence.Theinterconnectionswithinsystems\nare particularly important: any effects on particular components will inevitably affect all of the others.\nThisextremecomplexityisoneofthedefiningattributesoflifeandecosystems,incontrastwithphysical\n(or non-biological) systems, which are less complex.\nSystems analysis is the study of the characteristics of systems, including their components, the\nrelationships among those elements, and their collective and emergent properties. Systems analysis\nis used to study commercial, industrial, and scientific operations, usually with the goal of improving\ntheir efficiency. It can also be applied to improve the management of ecosystems being exploited to\nprovidegoodsandservicesforusebythehumaneconomy.Ecologistsalsousesystemsanalysistobetter\nunderstand the organization and working of natural ecosystems, regardless of any direct relationship\ntotheharvestingofnaturalresources.Akeyresultofmanysuchanalysesisthatthecomplexityofthe\nsystem often precludes accurate predictions.\nToseearemarkableexampleofamusicalsystemwithemergentproperties,havealookatthevideo,\nStringfever Bolero athttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5MLNMgpywk\nStressors and Responses\nThe development and productivity of organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems are naturally\nconstrained by environmental factors. These constraints can be viewed as being environmental stressors (or\nstressors).Forexample,anindividualplantmaybestressedbyinadequatenutrition,perhapsbecauseofinfertile\nsoil or competition with nearby plants for scarce resources.

Because reproductive (and evolutionary) success is related to the number of progeny an organism\nproduces to carry on its genetic lineage, the realized success of this individual plant is less than its potential.\nSimilarly, the development and productivity of an animal (including any human) are constrained by the\nenvironmentalconditionsunderwhichitlives.Forinstance,anindividualmayhavetodealwithstressescaused\nby food shortage or by difficult interactions with other animals through predation, parasitism, or competition\nfor scarce resources.\nThe most benign (or least stressful) natural environments are characterized by conditions in which factors\nsuch as moisture, nutrients, and temperature are not unduly constraining, while disturbances associated with\ndisease,wildfire,windstorm,orothercataclysmsarerare.Thesekindsofrelativelybenevolentconditionsallow\nthe most complex and biodiverse ecosystems to develop, namely old-growth rainforest and coral reefs. Other\n12 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans environments, however, are characterized by conditions that are more stressful, which therefore limits their\ndevelopment to less complex ecosystems, such as prairie, tundra, or desert.\nAll ecosystems are dynamic, in the sense that they change profoundly, and quite naturally, over time. Many\necosystemsareespeciallydynamic,inthattheyregularlyexperiencelargechangesintheirspecies,amountsof\nbiomass,andratesofproductivityandnutrientcycling.Forexample,ecosystemsthatoccurinseasonalclimates\nusuallyhaveadiscretegrowingseason,whichisfollowedbyadormantperiodwhenlittleornogrowthoccurs.\nTovaryingdegrees,allofthenaturalecosystems ofCanadaareseasonallydynamic:awarmgrowingseasonis\nfollowedbyacolddormantperiodwhennoplantproductivityorgrowthoccurs.Animalsmaysurvivethehard\ntimes of winter by migrating, hibernating, or feeding on plant biomass remaining from the previous growing\nseason.\nEcosystems that have recently been affected by a disturbance (an episode of destruction) are particularly\ndynamicbecausetheyareundergoingaprocessofecologicalrecoveryknownassuccession.Successionoccurs\ninresponsetochangesassociatedwithnaturaldisturbancessuchasawildfire,windstorm,orinsectordisease\nepidemic.

Although catastrophic disturbances may affect those stable ecosystems, they\nare rare under natural conditions. Nevertheless, as with all ecosystems, these stable types are influenced by\npervasive changes in climate and by other long-term dynamics, such as evolution.\nInfact,naturalenvironmentalandecologicalchangeshavecausedtheextinctionofalmostallofthespecies\nthat have ever lived on Earth since life began about 3.5 billion years ago. Many of the extinctions occurred\nbecause particular species could not cope with the stresses of changes in climate or in biological interactions\nsuch as competition, disease, or predation. However, many of the extinctions appear to have occurred\nsynchronously(ataboutthesametime)andwerepresumablycausedbyanunpredictablecatastrophe,suchas\na meteorite colliding with the Earth. (See Chapters 7 and 26 for descriptions of natural extinctions and those\ncaused by human influences.)\nEnvironmental stressors and disturbances have always been an important, natural context for life on Earth.\nSo, too, have been the resulting ecological responses, including changes in species and the dynamics of their\ncommunities and ecosystems.\nImage1.2.Modernconsumerismresultsinhugedemandsformaterialandenergyresourcestobuildand\nrun homes and to manufacture and operate machines and other goods.

For example, the harvesting of trees alters the habitat\nconditions for the diversity of plants, animals, and microorganisms that require forested habitat, thereby\naffectingtheirpopulations.Atthesametime,timberharvestingindirectlychangesfunctionalpropertiesofthe\nlandscape, such as erosion, productivity, and the quantity of water flowing in streams. Both the direct and\nindirect effects of humans on ecosystems are important.\nHumanshavealwaysleft\u201cfootprints\u201dinnature\u2013tosomedegree,theyhavealwaysinfluencedtheecosystems\nof which they were a component.

However,\n14 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans during the cultural evolution of humans, the ecological changes associated with our activities progressively\nintensified. This process of cultural evolution has been characterized by the discovery and use of increasingly\nmoresophisticatedmethods,tools,andsocialorganizationstosecureresourcesbyexploitingtheenvironment\nand other species.\nCertaininnovationsoccurringduringtheculturalevolutionofhumansrepresentedparticularlylargeincreases\nincapability.Becauseoftheirgreatinfluenceonhumansuccess,theseadvancesarereferredtoas\u201crevolutions.\u201d\nThe following are examples of early technological revolutions:\n\u2022 the discovery of ways of making improved weapons for hunting animals\n\u2022 domestication of the dog, which also greatly facilitated hunting\n\u2022 domestication of fire, which provided warmth and allowed for cooked, more digestible foods\n\u2022 ways of cultivating and domesticating plants and livestock, which resulted in huge increases in food\navailability\n\u2022 techniques for working raw metals into tools, which were much better than those made of wood, stone, or\nbone The rate of new discoveries has increased enormously over time. More recent technological\nrevolutions include the following:\n\u2022 methods of using machines and energy to perform work previously done by humans or draught animals\n\u2022 further advances in the domestication and cultivation of plants and animals\n\u2022 discoveries in medicine and sanitation\n\u2022 extraordinary strides in communications and information-processing technologies\nThese and other revolutionary innovations all led to substantial increases in the ability of humans to exploit\nthe resources of their environment and to achieve population growth (Chapter 10). Unfortunately, enhanced\nexploitation has rarely been accompanied by the development of a compensating ethic that encourages\nconservationoftheresourcesneededforsurvival.Evenearlyhuntingsocietiesofmorethanabout10,000years\nago appear to have caused the extinction of species that were hunted too effectively (Chapter 26).\nThe diverse effects of human activities on environmental quality are vital issues, and they will be examined\nin detail in later chapters. For now, we emphasize the message that intense environmental stress associated\nwith diverse human activities has become the major factor causing ecological changes on Earth. Many of the\nchangesaredegradingtheabilityoftheenvironmentandecosystems tosustain humansandtheireconomies.\nAnthropogenicactivitiesarealsocausingenormousdamagetonaturalecosystems,includingtohabitatsneeded\nto support most other species.\nInfact,theenvironmentalandecologicaldamagecausedbyhumanshasbecomesoseverethatanappropriate\nmetaphorforthehumanenterprisemaybethatofamalignancy,orcancer.Thisisasoberingimage.Itisusefulto\ndwellonitsothatitsmeaningdoesnotescapeourunderstanding.Humansandtheiractivitiesareendangering\nspecies and natural ecosystems on such a tremendous scale and rate that the integrity of Earth\u2019s life-support\nsystems is at risk.\nFromanecologicalperspective,thepaceandintensityofthesechangesisstaggering.Moreover,thedamage\nwillbecomesubstantiallyworsebeforecorrectiveactionsare(hopefully)undertakentoreversethedamageand\nallowanecologicallysustainablehumanenterprisetobecomepossible.Fromapessimisticstandpoint,however,\nitmayprovetobebeyondthecapabilityofhumansocietiestoacteffectivelytofixthedamageandtodesignand\nimplement solutions for sustainability.\nTheseare,ofcourse,onlyopinions,albeittheinformedviewsofmanyenvironmentalspecialists.Anticipating\nthe future is always uncertain, and things may turn out to be less grim than is now commonly predicted.

In fact, no other outcome could be considered acceptable.\nEthics and World Views\nThe choice that people make can influence environmental quality in many ways \u2013 by affecting the availability\nofresources,causingpollution, andcausingspeciesandnaturalecosystems tobecomeendangered.Decisions\ninfluencing environmental quality are influenced by two types of considerations: knowledge and ethics.\nInthepresentcontextbook,knowledgereferstoinformationandunderstandingaboutthenaturalworld,and\nethicsreferstotheperceptionofrightandwrongandtheappropriatebehaviourofpeopletowardeachother,\nother species, and nature. Of course, people may choose to interact with the environment and ecosystems in\nvarious ways. On the one hand, knowledge provides guidance about the consequences of alternative choices,\nincludingdamagethatmightbecausedandactionsthatcouldbetakentoavoidthateffect.Ontheotherhand,\nethics provides guidance about which alternative actions should be favoured or even allowed to occur.\nBecause modern humans have enormous power to utilize and damage the environment, the influence of\nknowledge and ethics on choices is a vital consideration. And we can choose among various alternatives. For\nexample, individual people can decide whether to have children, purchase an automobile, or eat meat, while\nsocietycanchoosewhethertoallowthehuntingofwhales,clear-cuttingofforests,orconstructionofnuclear-\npower plants. All of these options have implications for environmental quality.\nPerceptions of value (of merit or importance) also profoundly influence how the consequences of human\nactions are interpreted. Environmental values can be divided into two broad classes: utilitarian and intrinsic.\n1. Utilitarian value (also known as instrumental value) is based on the known importance of something to\nthe welfare of people (see also the discussion of the anthropocentric world view, below). Accordingly,\ncomponents of the environment and ecosystems are considered important only if they are resources\nnecessarytosustainhumans\u2014thatis,iftheybestoweconomicbenefits,providelivelihoods,andcontribute\nto the life-support system. In effect, people harvest materials from nature because they have utilitarian\nvalue.Thesenecessitiesincludewater,timber,fishandanimalshuntedinwildplaces,andagriculturalcrops\ngrown in managed ecosystems.\nEcological values are somewhat broader utilitarian values\u2014they are based on the needs of humans, but\nalso on those of other species and natural ecosystems. Ecological values often take a longer-term view.\nAestheticvaluesarealsoutilitarianbutarebasedonanappreciationofbeauty,buttheyaresubjectiveand\ninfluencedbyculturalperspectives.Forinstance,environmentalaestheticsmightvaluenaturalwilderness\noverhuman-dominatedecosystems,free-livingwhalesoverwhalemeat,andlargestandingtreesovertoilet\npaper. On the other hand, aesthetics that are heavily influenced by more anthropogenic considerations\nmight result in the opposite preferences. Maintaining aesthetic values can provide substantial cultural,\nsocial, psychological, and economic benefits.\n2. Intrinsic value is based on the belief that components of the natural environment (such as species and\nnaturalecosystems)haveinherentvalueandarighttoexist,regardlessofanypositive,negative,orneutral\nrelationshipswithhumans.Underthissystem,itwouldbewrongforpeopletotreatothercreaturescruelly,\n16 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans to take actions that cause natural entities to become endangered or extinct, or to fail to prevent such\noccurrences.\nAswasnotedpreviously,ethicsconcernstheperceptionofrightandwrongandthevaluesandrulesthatshould\ngovern human conduct. Clearly, ethics of all kinds depend upon the values that people believe are important.\nEnvironmental ethics deal with the responsibilities of present humans to both future generations and other\nspeciestoensurethattheworldwillcontinuetofunctioninanecologicallyhealthyway,andtoprovideadequate\nresources and livelihoods (this is also a key aspect of sustainable development; see the last section of this\nchapter). The environmental values described above underlie this system of ethics. Applying environmental\nethicsoftenmeansanalyzingandbalancingstandardsthatmayconflict,becauseaesthetic,ecological,intrinsic,\nand utilitarian values rarely all coincide (see In Detail 1.2).\nThere is also tension between ethical considerations that are individualistic and those that are holistic.\nFor example, animal-rights activists are highly concerned with issues involving the treatment of individual\norganisms.Ecologists,however,aretypicallymoreconcernedwithholisticvalues,suchasapopulation,species,\norecosystem.Assuch,anecologistmightadvocateacullofoverabundantdeerinaparkinordertofavourthe\nsurvival of populations of endangered plants, whereas that action might be resisted by an animal-rights activist.\nValues and ethics, in turn, support larger systems known as world views. A world view is a comprehensive\nphilosophyofhumanlifeandtheuniverse,andoftherelationshipbetweenpeopleandthenaturalworld.World\nviewsincludetraditionalreligions,philosophies,andscience,aswellasotherbeliefsystems.Inanenvironmental\ncontext, generally important world views are known as anthropocentric, biocentric, and ecocentric, while the\nfrontierandsustainabilityworldviewsaremorerelatedtotheuseofresources.Theanthropocentricworldview\nconsidershumansasbeingatthecentreofmoralconsideration.Peopleareviewedasbeingmoreworthythan\nanyotherspeciesandasuniquelydisconnectedfromtherestofnature.Therefore,theanthropocentricworld\nviewjudgestheimportanceandworthinessofeverything,includingotherspeciesandecosystems,intermsof\nthe implications for human welfare.\nImage1.3.Accordingtothebiocentricandecocentricworldviews,allspecieshaveintrinsic value.This\ndoesnot,however,meanthatonespeciescannotexploitanother.Thisimageofagirlandherpuppywas\ntaken in Kimmirut, southern Baffin Island.

This world view claims that people are superior and have a right to exploit nature.\nMoreover,thesupplyofresourcestosustainhumansisconsideredtobelimitless,becausenewstockscanalways\nbefound,orsubstitutesdiscovered.Theconsumptionofresourcesisconsideredtobegoodbecauseitenables\neconomiestogrow.Nationsandindividualsshouldbeallowedtoconsumeresourcesaggressively,aslongasno\npeople are hurt in the process.\nThe sustainability world view acknowledges that humans must have access to vital resources, but the\nexploitation of those necessities should be governed by appropriate ecological, intrinsic, and aesthetic values.\nThesustainabilityworldviewcanassume various forms. Thespaceship worldviewis quiteanthropocentric.It\nfocuses only on sustaining resources needed by people, and it assumes that humans can exert a great degree\nofcontrolovernaturalprocessesandcansafelypilot\u201cspaceshipEarth.\u201dIncontrast,ecologicalsustainabilityis\nmoreecocentric.Itconsiderspeoplewithinanecologicalcontextandfocusesonsustainingallcomponentsof\nEarth\u2019slife-supportsystembypreventinghumanactionsthatwoulddegradethem.Inanecologicallysustainable\neconomy, natural goods and services should be utilized only in ways that do not compromise their future\navailability and do not endanger the survival of species or natural ecosystems.\nThe attitudes of people and their societies toward other species, natural ecosystems, and resources have\nenormous implications for environmental quality. Extraordinary damages have been legitimized by attitudes\nbased on a belief in the inalienable right of humans to harvest whatever they desire from nature, without\nconsiderationofpollution,threatstospecies,ortheavailabilityofresourcesforfuturegenerations.Clearly,one\nofthekeystoresolvingtheenvironmentalcrisisistoachieveawidespreadadoptionofecocentricandecological\nsustainability world views.\nEnvironmental Issues 1.1.

Old-growth forest is also a special kind of natural\necosystem, different from other forests, and supporting species that cannot survive elsewhere. These\necological qualities give coastal old-growth forest an intrinsic value that is not replicated elsewhere in\nCanada. This ecosystem represents a distinct element of our natural heritage.\nOld-growth forest is also an extremely valuable resource because it contains large trees that can be\nharvested and manufactured into lumber or paper. If utilized in this manner, old-growth forest can\nprovide livelihoods for people and revenues for local, provincial, and national economies. Old-growth\nforest also supports other economic values, including deer that can be harvested by hunters, and\nsalmonbyfishers,aswellasbirdsandwildflowersthatenticeecotouriststovisitthesespecialhabitats.\n18 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans Intact old-growth forest also provides other valuable services, such as flows of clean streamwater and\nassistance in the regulation of atmospheric concentrations of vital gases such as carbon dioxide and\noxygen.

Industrial schemes to harvest old-growth trees for manufacturing into lumber or paper are\nincompatible with other proposals to protect this special ecosystem in parks and wilderness areas.\nThe conflicting perceptions of values have resulted in emotional confrontations between loggers and\npreservationists, in some cases resulting in civil disobedience, arrests, and jail terms. Ultimately, these\nsorts of controversies can only be resolved by finding a balance among the utilitarian, ecological,\naesthetic,andintrinsicvaluesofold-growthforest,andbyensuringthatallofthesevaluesaresustained.\nThe Environmental Crisis\nThe modern environmental crisis encompasses many issues. In large part, however, we can classify the issues\ninto three categories: population, resources, and environmental quality. In essence, these topics are what this\nbook is about. However, the core of their subject areas is the following:\nPopulation\n\u2022\nIn 2015, the human population numbered more than 7.3 billion, including about 34 million in Canada . At\nthegloballevel,thehumanpopulationhasbeenincreasingbecauseoftheexcessofbirthratesoverdeath\nrates.Therecentexplosivepopulationgrowth,andthepovertyofsomanypeople,isarootcauseofmuchof\ntheenvironmentalcrisis.Directlyorindirectly,largepopulationincreasesresultinextensivedeforestation,\nexpandingdeserts,landdegradationbyerosion,shortagesofwater,changeinregionalandglobalclimate,\nendangerment and extinction of species, and other great environmental problems. Considered together,\nthese damages represent changes in the character of the biosphere that are as cataclysmic as major\ngeologicalevents,suchasglaciation.WewilldiscussthehumanpopulationinmoredetailinChapters10and\n11.\nResources\n\u2022\nTwo kinds of natural resources can be distinguished. A non-renewable resource is present in a finite\nquantity. As these resources are extracted from the environment, in a process referred to as mining,\ntheir stocks are inexorably diminished and so are available in increasingly smaller quantities for future\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 19 generations. Non-renewable resources include metals and fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal. In\ncontrast, a renewable resource can regenerate after harvesting, and if managed suitably, can provide a\nsupplythatissustainableforever.However,toberenewable,theabilityoftheresourcetoregeneratecannot\nbe compromised by excessive harvesting or inappropriate management practices. Examples of renewable\nresourcesincludefreshwater,thebiomassoftreesandagriculturalplantsandlivestock,andhuntedanimals\nsuch as fish and deer. Ultimately, a sustainable economy must be supported by renewable resources. Too\noften,however,potentiallyrenewableresourcesarenotusedresponsibly,whichimpairstheirrenewaland\nrepresentsatypeofmining. ThesubjectareaofnaturalresourcesisexaminedindetailinChapters 12,13,\nand 14.\nEnvironmental Quality\n\u2022\nThis subject area deals with anthropogenic pollution and disturbances and their effects on people, their\neconomies, other species, and natural ecosystems. Pollution may be caused by gases emitted by power\nplants and vehicles, pesticides, or heated water discharged into lakes. Examples of disturbance include\nclear-cutting, fishing, and forest fires. The consequences of pollution and disturbance for biodiversity,\nclimatechange,resourceavailability,riskstohumanhealth,andotheraspectsofenvironmentalqualityare\nexamined in Chapters 15 to 26.\nEnvironmental Impacts of Humans\nInageneralsense,thecumulativeimpactofhumansonthebiosphereisafunctionoftwomajorfactors:(1)the\nsize of the population and (2) the per-capita (per-person) environmental impact. The human population varies\ngreatly among and within countries, as does the per-capita impact, which depends on the kind and degree of\neconomic development that has occurred.\nPaul Ehrlich, an American ecologist, has expressed this simple relationship using an \u201cimpact formula,\u201d as\nfollows: I = P \u00d7 A \u00d7 T, where\n\u2022 I is the total environmental impact of a human population\n\u2022 P is the population size\n\u2022 A is an estimate of the per-capita affluence in terms of resource use\n\u2022 T is the degree of technological development of the economy, on a per-capita basis\nCalculations based on this simple PAT formula show that affluent, technological societies have a much larger\nper-capita environmental impact than do poorer ones.\nHowdoesCanada\u2019simpactontheenvironmentcomparewiththatofmorepopulouscountries,suchasChina\nand India? We can examine this question by looking at two simple indicators of the environmental impact of\nbothindividual people andnational economies: (a)thesizeofthehumanpopulation, (b)theuse ofenergyand\n(c)grossdomesticproduct(GDP,ortheannualvalueofallgoodsandservicesproducedbyacountry).Theuse\nof energy is a helpful environmental indicator because power is needed to carry out virtually all activities in a\nmodernsociety,includingdrivingvehicles,heatingorcoolingbuildings,manufacturingindustrialproducts,and\n20 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans running computers. GDP represents all of the economic activities in a country, each of which results in some\ndegree of environmental impact.\nOne ofthe major influences on the environmental impactofanyhuman population is the number ofpeople\n(the population size). In this respect, Canada has a much smaller population (35.1 million in 2015) compared to\nChina (1.3 billion), India (1.1 billion), or the United States (321 million) (Figure 1.3a).\nHowever,onaper-personbasis,peoplelivinginCanadaortheU.S.havemuchlargerenvironmentalimpacts\nthan do those living in China or India, as indicated by both per-capita energy use (Figure 1.3c) and per-capita\nGDP(Figure1.3e).ThisdifferenceisaninevitableconsequenceoftheprosperousnatureofthelifestyleofNorth\nAmericans and other wealthier people, which on a per-capita basis is achieved by consuming relatively large\namounts of natural resources and energy, while generating a great deal of waste materials. Sometimes this\nenvironmental effect of a wealthier population is referred to as \u201caffluenza\u201d.\nHowever,theper-capitaenvironmentalimpactisonlypartoftheenvironmentalinfluenceofacountry,orof\nanyhumanpopulation.Todeterminethenationaleffect,theper-capitavaluemustbemultipliedbythesizeof\nthepopulation.Whenthisisdoneforenergy,ChinaandtheU.S.havebyfarthelargestvalues,whileCanadaand\nIndiaaremuchless(Figure1.3b).Still,itisremarkablethatthenationalenergyuseofCanada,withitsrelatively\nsmall population, is close to that of India and within an order of magnitude of China, which have enormously\nlarger populations. The same pattern is true of national the GDPs of those countries.\nTheseobservationsdrivehomethefactthattheenvironmentalimpactofanyhumanpopulationisafunction\nofboth(a)thenumberofpeopleand(b)theper-personenvironmentalimpact.Becauseofthiscontext,relatively\nwealthycountrieslikeCanadahavemuchlargerenvironmentalimpactsthanmightbepredictedbasedonlyon\nthesizeoftheirpopulation.Ontheotherhand,theenvironmentalimpactsofpoorercountriesaresmallerthan\nmight be predicted based on their population. We can conclude that the environmental crisis is due to both\noverpopulation and excessive resource consumption.\nFigure 1.3. The relative environmental impacts of China, India, Canada, and the United States. The\nenvironmental impacts of countries, and of their individual citizens, can be compared using simple\nindicators, such as the use of energy and the gross domestic product. Canada\u2019s relatively small\npopulation, compared with China and India, is somewhat offset by its higher per-capita GDP and use\nofenergy.However,becausetheper-capitadatafortheU.S.andCanadaaresimilar,relativepopulation\nsizes are the key influence on the environmental impacts of these two countries. Sources of data:\npopulation data are for 2015 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015); energy use (all commercial fuels) for 2013 (BP,\n2013); GDP for 2013 (CIA, 2014).\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 21 22 | Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans Chapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 23 Image 1.4.

Freedman.\nEcologically Sustainable Development\nSustainabledevelopmentreferstodevelopmentofaneconomicsystemthatusesnaturalresourcesinwaysthat\ndonotdepletethemorotherwisecompromisetheiravailabilitytofuturegenerations.Inthissense,thepresent\nhuman economy is clearly non-sustainable. The reason for this bold assertion is that the present economy\nachieves rapid economic growth through vigorous depletion of both non-renewable and renewable resources\n(see Chapters 12-14). Economic growth and development are different phenomena. Economic growth refers to\nincreasesinthesizeofaneconomybecauseofexpansionsofbothpopulationandper-capitaresourceuse.This\ngrowth is typically achieved by increasing the consumption of natural resources, particularly non-renewable\nones such as fossil fuels and metals. The rapid use results in an aggressive depletion of vital non-renewable\nresources, andevenrenewable ones. InCanada, forexample, considerable economic growthisbeing achieved\nbythehugeinvestmentsofcapitalneededtomineandprocessthegreatoil-sandresourcesofnorthernAlberta\n(seeCanadianFocus13.1).Incontrast,acomparablescaleofinvestmentinrenewableenergyinitiatives,suchas\nwind or solar power, or in energy conservation, would have contributed more so to sustainable development.\nAlmostallnationaleconomieshavebeengrowingrapidlyinrecenttimes.Moreover,mostpoliticians,economic\nplanners,andbusinesspeoplehopeforadditionalgrowthofeconomicactivity,inordertogeneratemorewealth\nand to provide a better life for citizens.

In contrast, less-developed or low-income countries have much less economic\ninfrastructure and low per-capita earnings. Examples include Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar, and Zimbabwe. A\nthird group is comprised of rapidly developing or middle-income countries, such as Brazil, Chile, China, India,\nMalaysia, Russia, and Thailand.\nA sustainable economy must be fundamentally supported by the wise use of renewable resources, meaning\nthey are not used more quickly than their rate of regeneration. For these reasons, the term sustainable\ndevelopment should refer only to progress being made toward a sustainable economic system. Progress in\nsustainable development involves the following sorts of desirable changes:\n\u2022 increasing efficiency of use of non-renewable resources, for example, by careful recycling of metals and by\noptimizing the use of energy\n\u2022 increasing use of renewable sources of energy and materials in the economy (to replace non-renewable\nsources)\n\u2022 improving social equity, with the ultimate goal of helping all people (and not just a privileged minority) to\nhave reasonable access to the basic necessities and amenities of life\nDespiteabundantpublicrhetoric,oursocietyhasnotyetmademuchprogresstowardtruesustainability.This\nhas happened because most actions undertaken by governments and businesses have supported economic\ngrowth,ratherthansustainabledevelopment.WewillfurtherexaminetheseissuesinChapter12andotherparts\nof this book.\nSustainable development is a lofty and necessary goal for society to pursue. But if a sustainable human\neconomyisnotattained,thenthenon-sustainableonewillrunshortofresourcesandcouldcollapse.Thiswould\ncause terrible misery for huge numbers of people and colossal damage to the biosphere.\nThe notion of sustainability can be further extended to that of ecologically sustainable development. This\nidea includes the usual aspect of sustainable development in which countries develop without depleting their\nessential base of natural resources, essentially by basing their economy on the wise use of renewable sources\nof energy and materials. Beyond that, however, an ecologically sustainable economy runs without causing\nan irretrievable loss of natural ecosystems or extinctions of species, while also maintaining important\nenvironmental services, such as the provision of clean air and water. Ecological sustainability is a reasonable\nextensionofsustainability,whichonlyfocusesonthehumaneconomy.Byexpandingtoembracetheinterests\nof other species and natural ecosystems, ecological sustainability provides an inclusive vision for a truly\nharmonious enterprise of humans on planet Earth. Identifying and resolving the barriers to ecological\nsustainability are the fundamental objectives and subject matter of environmental studies. It provides a\nframework for all that we do.\nChapter 1 ~ Ecosystems and Humans | 25 Conclusions\nEnvironmentalscienceisahighlyinterdisciplinaryfieldthatisconcernedwithissuesassociatedwiththerapidly\nincreasinghumanpopulation,theuseanddiminishingstocksofnaturalresources,damagecausedbypollution\nanddisturbance,andeffectsonbiodiversityandthebiosphere.Theseareextremelyimportantissues,butthey\ninvolvecomplexandpoorlyunderstoodsystems.Theyalsoengageconflictsbetweendirecthumaninterestsand\nthose of other species and the natural world.\nUltimately, the design and implementation of an ecologically sustainable human economy will require a\nwidespreadadoptionofnewworldviewsandculturalattitudesthatarebasedonenvironmentalandecological\nethics, which include consideration for the needs of future generations of people as well as other species and\nnatural ecosystems.

Describe the nature of science and its usefulness in explaining the natural world.\n2. Distinguish among facts, hypotheses, and theories.\n3. Outline the methodology of science, including the importance of tests designed to disprove hypotheses.\n4. Discuss the importance of uncertainty in many scientific predictions, and the relevance of this to\nenvironmental controversies.\nThe Nature of Science\nScience can be defined as the systematic examination of the structure and functioning of the natural world,\nincluding both its physical and biological attributes. Science is also a rapidly expanding body of knowledge,\nwhoseultimategoalistodiscoverthesimplestgeneralprinciplesthatcanexplaintheenormouscomplexityof\nnature. These principles can be used to gain insights about the of the natural world and to make predictions\nabout future change.\nScienceisarelativelyrecentwayoflearningaboutnaturalphenomena,havinglargelyreplacedtheinfluences\nof less objective methods and world views. The major alternatives to science are belief systems that are\ninfluential in all cultures, including those based on religion, morality, and aesthetics. These belief systems are\nprimarilydirectedtowarddifferentendsthanscience,suchasfindingmeaningthattranscendsmereexistence,\nlearning how people ought to behave, and understanding the value of artistic expression.\nModern science evolved from a way of learning called natural philosophy, which was developed by classical\nGreeksandwasconcernedwiththerationalinvestigationofexistence,knowledge,andphenomena.Compared\nwith modern science, however, studies in natural philosophy used unsophisticated technologies and methods\nand were not particularly quantitative, sometimes involving only the application of logic.\nModernsciencebeganwiththesystematicinvestigationsoffamous16th-and17th-centuryscientists,suchas:\n\u2022 Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), a Polish astronomer who conceived the modern theory of the solar system\n\u2022 William Gilbert (1544-1603), an Englishman who worked on magnetism\n\u2022 Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian who conducted research on the physics of objects in motion, as well as\nastronomy\n\u2022 William Harvey (1578-1657): an Englishman who described the circulation of the blood\n\u2022 Isaac Newton (1642-1727): an Englishman who made important contributions to understanding gravity and\nthe nature of light, formulated laws of motion, and developed the mathematics of calculus\nChapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural\nWorld | 31 Inductive and Deductive Logic\nThe English philosopher Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was also highly influential in the development of modern\nscience. Bacon was not an actual practitioner of science but was a strong proponent of its emerging\nmethodologies. He promoted the application of inductive logic, in which conclusions are developed from the\naccumulating evidence of experience and the results of experiments. Inductive logic can lead to unifying\nexplanationsbasedonlargebodiesofdataandobservationsofphenomena.Considerthefollowingillustration\nof inductive logic, applied to an environmental topic:\n\u2022 Observation 1: Marine mammals off the Atlantic coast of Canada have large residues of DDT and other\nchlorinated hydrocarbons in their fat and other body tissues.\n\u2022 Observation 2: So do marine mammals off British Columbia.\n\u2022 Observation 3: As do those in the Arctic Ocean, although in lower concentrations.\nInductiveconclusion:Thereisawidespreadcontaminationofmarinemammalswithchlorinatedhydrocarbons.\nFurtherresearchmaydemonstratethatthecontaminationisaglobalphenomenon.Thissuggestsapotentially\nimportant environmental problem.\nIn contrast, deductive logic involves making one or more initial assumptions and then drawing logical\nconclusionsfromthosepremises.Consequently,thetruthofadeductiveconclusiondependsontheveracityof\ntheoriginalassumptions.Ifthosesuppositionsarebasedonfalseinformationoronincorrectsupernaturalbelief,\nthen any deduced conclusions are likely to be wrong. Consider the following illustration of deductive logic:\n\u2022 Assumption 1: TCDD, an extremely toxic chemical in the dioxin family, is poisonous when present in even\nthe smallest concentrations in food and water\u2014even a single molecule can cause toxicity.\n\u2022 Assumption 2: Exposure to anything that is poisonous in even the smallest concentrations is unsafe.\n\u2022 Assumption 3: No exposure that is unsafe should be allowed.\nDeductive conclusion 1:No exposure to TCDD is safe.\nDeductive conclusion 2:No emissions of TCDD should be allowed.\nThe two conclusions are consistent with the original assumptions. However, there is disagreement among\nhighlyqualifiedscientistsaboutthoseassumptions.ManytoxicologistsbelievethatexposurestoTCDD(andany\nother potentially toxic chemicals) must exceed a threshold of biological tolerance before poisoning will result\n(see Chapter 15). In contrast, other scientists believe that even the smallest exposure to TCDD carries some\ndegreeoftoxicrisk.Thus,thestrengthofdeductivelogicdependsontheacceptanceandtruthoftheoriginal\nassumptions from which its conclusions flow.\nIn general, inductive logic plays a much stronger role in modern science than does deductive logic. In both\ncases, however, the usefulness of any conclusions depends greatly on the accuracy of any observations and\notherdataonwhichtheywerebased.Poordatamayleadtoaninaccurateconclusionthroughtheapplicationof\ninductive logic, as will inappropriate assumptions in deductive logic.\n32 | Chapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World Goals of Science\nThebroadgoalsofsciencearetounderstandnaturalphenomenaandtoexplainhowtheymaybechangingover\ntime.Toachievethosegoals,scientistsundertakeinvestigationsthatarebasedoninformation,inferences,and\nconclusionsdevelopedthroughasystematicapplicationoflogic,usuallyoftheinductivesort.Assuch,scientists\ncarefully observe natural phenomena and conduct experiments.\nAhighergoalofscientificresearchistoformulatelawsthatdescribetheworkingsoftheuniverseingeneral\nterms. (For example, see Chapter 4 for a description of the laws of thermodynamics, which deal with the\ntransformations of energy among its various states.)

However, many natural phenomena are\nextremelycomplexandmayneverbefullyunderstoodintermsofphysicallaws.Thisisparticularlytrueofthe\nways that organisms and ecosystems are organized and function.\nScientific investigations may be pure or applied.

Facts are based\non experience and scientific evidence. In contrast, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for the occurrence\nofaphenomenon.Scientistsformulatehypothesesasstatementsandthentestthemthroughexperimentsand\notherformsofresearch.Hypothesesaredevelopedusinglogic,inference,andmathematicalargumentsinorder\ntoexplainobservedphenomena.However,itmustalwaysbepossibletorefuteascientifichypothesis.Thus,the\nhypothesisthat\u201ccatsaresointelligentthattheypreventhumansfromdiscoveringit\u201dcannotbelogicallyrefuted,\nand so it is not a scientific hypothesis.\nAtheoryisabroaderconceptionthatreferstoasetofexplanations,rules,andlaws.Thesearesupportedbya\nlargebodyofobservationalandexperimentalevidence,allleadingtorobustconclusions.Thefollowingaresome\nof the most famous theories in science:\n\u2022 the theory of gravitation, first proposed by Isaac Newton (1642-1727)\n\u2022 the theory of evolution by natural selection, published simultaneously in 1858 by two English naturalists,\nCharles Darwin (1809-1882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913)\n\u2022 the theory of relativity, identified by the German\u2013Swiss physicist, Albert Einstein (1879-1955)\nCelebratedtheorieslikethesearestronglysupportedbylargebodiesofevidence,andtheywilllikelypersistfor\nalongtime.However,wecannotsaythatthese(oranyother)theoriesareknownwithcertaintytobetrue\u2013some\nfuture experiments may yet falsify even these famous theories.\nThe scientific method begins with the identification of a question involving the structure or function of the\nnaturalworld,whichisusuallydevelopedusinginductivelogic(Figure2.1).Thequestionisinterpretedinterms\nof existing theory, and specific hypotheses are formulated to explain the character and causes of the natural\nChapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World | 33 phenomenon.Theresearchmightinvolveobservationsmadeinnature,orcarefullycontrolledexperiments,and\ntheresultsusuallygivescientistsreasonstorejecthypothesesratherthantoacceptthem.Mosthypothesesare\nrejectedbecause their predictions are not borne out during the course of research.

Consequently, science cannot resolve value-laden questions, such as the meaning of life, good\nversus evil, or the existence and qualities of God or any other supernatural being or force.\nAn experiment is a test or investigation that is designed to provide evidence in support of, or preferably\nagainst, a hypothesis. A natural experiment is conducted by observing actual variations of phenomena in\nnature,andthendevelopingexplanationsbyanalysisofpossiblecausalmechanisms.Amanipulativeexperiment\ninvolves the deliberate alteration of factors that are hypothesized to influence phenomena.

This does not, however, serve to \u201cprove\u201d the hypothesis \u2013\nrather, it only supports its conditional acceptance. As soon as a clearly defined hypothesis is falsified by an\nappropriately designed and well-conducted experiment, it is disproved for all time. This is why experiments\ndesigned to disprove hypotheses are a key aspect of the scientific method.\nRevolutionary advances in understanding may occur when an important hypothesis or theory are rejected\nthroughdiscoveriesofscience.Forinstance,onceitwasdiscoveredthattheEarthisnotflat,itbecamepossible\ntoconfidentlysailbeyondthevisiblehorizonwithoutfearoffallingofftheedgeoftheworld.Anotherexample\ninvolved the discovery by Copernicus that the planets of our solar system revolve around the Sun, and the\nrelatedconceptthattheSunisanordinarystaramongmany\u2013theserevolutionaryideasreplacedthepreviously\ndominant one that the planets, Sun, and stars all revolved around the Earth.\nThomas Kuhn (1922-1995) was a philosopher of science who emphasized the important role of \u201cscientific\nrevolutions\u201dinachievinggreatadvancesinourunderstandingofthenaturalworld.Inessence,Kuhn(1996)said\nthatascientificrevolutionoccurswhenawell-establishedtheoryisrigorouslytestedandthencollapsesunder\ntheaccumulatingweightofnewfactsandobservationsthatcannotbeexplained.Thisrenderstheoriginaltheory\nobsolete,tobereplacedbyanew,moreinformedparadigm(i.e.,asetofassumptions,concepts,practices,and\nvalues that constitutes a way of viewing reality and is shared by an intellectual community).\nA variable is a factor that is believed to influence a natural phenomenon. For example, a scientist might\nhypothesize that the productivity of a wheat crop is potentially limited by such variables as the availability\nof water, or of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Some of the most powerful scientific experiments\ninvolve the manipulation of key (or controlling) variables and the comparison of results of those treatments\nwith a control that was not manipulated. In the example just described, the specific variable that controls\nwheatproductivitycouldbeidentifiedbyconductinganexperimentinwhichtestpopulationsareprovidedwith\nvaryingamountsofwater,nitrogen,andphosphorus,aloneandincombination,andthencomparingtheresults\nwith a non-manipulated control.\nIn some respects, however, the explanation of the scientific method offered above is a bit uncritical. It\nperhaps suggests a too-orderly progression in terms of logical, objective experimentation and comparison of\nalternative hypotheses. These are, in fact, important components of the scientific method. Nevertheless, it is\nimportanttounderstandthattheinsightsandpersonalbiasesofscientistsarealsosignificantintheconductand\nprogressofscience.Inmostcases,scientistsdesignresearchthattheythinkwill\u201cwork\u201dtoyieldusefulresults\nand contribute to the orderly advancement of knowledge in their field.

An experiment is a controlled investigation designed to provide evidence for, or preferably\nagainst, a hypothesis about the working of the natural world. This laboratory experiment exposed\ntest populations of a grass to different concentrations of a toxic chemical.\nUncertainty\nMuch scientific investigation involves the collection of observations by measuring phenomena in the natural\nworld. Another important aspect of science involves making predictions about the future values of variables.\nSuch projections require a degree of understanding of the relationships among variables and their influencing\nfactors, and of recent patterns of change. However, many kinds of scientific information and predictions\nare subject to inaccuracy. This occurs because measured data are often approximations of the true values\nof phenomena, and predictions are rarely fulfilled exactly. The accuracy of observations and predictions is\ninfluenced by various factors, especially those described in the following sections.\nPredictability\nAfewphenomenaareconsideredtohaveauniversalcharacterandareconsistentwhereverandwheneverthey\n36 | Chapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World are accurately measured. One of the best examples of such a universal constant is the speed of light, which\nalways has a value of 2.998 \u00d7 108meters per second, regardless of where it is measured or of the speed of the\nbodyfrom which the lightis emitted.Similarly, certain relationships describing transformations of energyand\nmatter, known as the laws of thermodynamics (Chapter 4), always give reliable predictions.\nHowever,mostnaturalphenomenaarenotsoconsistent\u2014dependingoncircumstances,thereareexceptions\ntogeneralpredictions aboutthem.Thiscircumstanceisparticularlytrueofbiologyandecology,relatedfields\nofscienceinwhichalmostallgeneralpredictionshaveexceptions.Infact,lawsorunifyingprinciplesofbiology\nor ecology have not yet been discovered, in contrast to the several esteemed laws and 11 universal constants\nof physics. For this reason, biologists and ecologists have great difficulties making accurate predictions about\ntheresponsesoforganismsandecosystemstoenvironmentalchange.Thisiswhybiologistsandecologistsare\nsometimes said to have \u201cphysics envy.\u201d\nInlargepart,theinaccuraciesofbiologyandecologyoccurbecausekeyfunctionsarecontrolledbycomplexes\nof poorly understood, and sometimes unidentified, environmental influences. Consequently, predictions about\nfuturevaluesofbiologicalandecologicalvariablesorthecausesofchangesareseldomaccurate.Forexample,\neven though ecologists in eastern Canada have been monitoring the population size of spruce budworm (an\nimportant pest of conifer forests) for some years, they cannot accurately predict its future abundance in\nparticular stands of forest or in larger regions. This is because the abundance of this moth is influenced by\na complex of environmental factors, including tree-species composition, age of the forest, abundance of its\npredators and parasites, quantities of its preferred foods, weather at critical times of year, and insecticide use\ntoreduceitspopulations(seeChapter21).Biologistsandecologistsdonotfullyunderstandthiscomplexity,and\nperhaps they never will.\nVariability\nMany natural phenomena are highly variable in space and time. This is true of physical and chemical variables\nas well as of biological and ecological ones. Within a forest, for example, the amount of sunlight reaching the\nground varies greatly with time, depending on the hour of the day and the season of the year. It also varies\nspatially, depending on the density of foliage over any place where sunlight is being measured. Similarly, the\ndensityofaparticularspeciesoffishwithinarivertypicallyvariesinresponsetochangesinhabitatconditions\nandotherinfluences.Mostfishpopulationsalsovaryovertime,especiallymigratoryspeciessuchassalmon.In\nenvironmental science, replicated (or independently repeated) measurements and statistical analyses are used\nto measure and account for these kinds of temporal and spatial variations.\nAccuracy and Precision\nAccuracyreferstothedegreetowhichameasurementorobservationreflectstheactual,ortrue,valueofthe\nsubject. For example, the insecticide DDT and the metal mercury are potentially toxic chemicals that occur in\ntrace concentrations in all organisms, but their small residues are difficult to analyze chemically. Some of the\nanalytical methods used to determine the concentrations of DDT and mercury are more accurate than others\nandthereforeproviderelativelyusefulandreliabledatacomparedwithlessaccuratemethods.Infact,analytical\ndata are usually approximations of the real values \u2013 rigorous accuracy is rarely attainable.\nPrecision is related to the degree of repeatability of a measurement or observation. For example, suppose\nChapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World | 37 thattheactualnumberofcaribouinamigratingherdis10,246animals.Awildlifeecologistmightestimatethat\ntherewereabout10,000animalsinthatherd,whichforpracticalpurposesisareasonablyaccuratereckoning\nof the actual number of caribou. If other ecologists also independently estimate the size of the herd at about\n10,000caribou,thereisagooddegreeofprecisionamongthevalues.If,however,somesystematicbiasexisted\ninthemethodologyusedtocounttheherd,givingconsistentestimatesof15,000animals(remember,theactual\npopulation is 10 246 caribou), these estimates would be considered precise, but not particularly accurate.\nPrecision is also related to the number of digits with which data are reported. If you were using a flexible\ntape to measure the lengths of 10 large, wriggly snakes, you would probably measure the reptiles only to the\nnearestcentimetre.Thestrengthandsquirminessoftheanimalsmakemoreprecisemeasurementsimpossible.\nThereportedaveragelengthofthe10snakesshouldreflecttheoriginalmeasurementsandmightbegivenas204\ncmandnotavaluesuchas203.8759cm.Thelatternumbermightbedisplayedasadigitalaveragebyacalculator\nor computer, but it is unrealistically precise.\nSignificant figures are related to accuracy and precision and can be defined as the number of digits used to\nreportdatafromanalysesorcalculations(seealsoAppendixA).Significantfiguresaremosteasilyunderstoodby\nexamples.Thenumber179hasthreesignificantfigures,asdoesthenumber0.0849andalso0.000794(thezeros\nprecedingthesignificantintegersdonotcount).However,thenumber195,000,000hasninesignificantfigures\n(the zeros following are meaningful), although the number 195 \u00d7 106has only three significant figures.\nIt is rarely useful to report environmental or ecological data to more than 2-4 significant figures. This is\nbecauseanymorewouldgenerallyexceedtheaccuracyandprecisionofthemethodologyusedintheestimation\nandwouldthereforebeunrealistic.Forexample,theapproximatepopulationofCanadain2015was35.1million\npeople(or35.1\u00d7106;bothofthesenotationshavethreesignificantfigures).However,thepopulationshouldnot\nbe reported as 33,100,000, which implies an unrealistic accuracy and precision of eight significant figures.\nA Need for Scepticism\nEnvironmental science is filled with many examples of uncertainty\u2014in present values and future changes of\nenvironmental variables, as well as in predictions of biological and ecological responses to those changes. To\nsome degree the difficulties associated with scientific uncertainty can be mitigated by developing improved\nmethods and technologies for analysis and by modelling and examining changes occurring in different parts\nof the world. The latter approach enhances our understanding by providing convergent evidence about the\noccurrence and causes of natural phenomena.\nHowever, scientific information and understanding will always be subject to some degree of uncertainty.\nTherefore, predictions will always be inaccurate to some extent, and this uncertainty must be considered\nwhen trying to understand and deal with the causes and consequences of environmental changes. As such,\nall information and predictions in environmental science must be critically interpreted with uncertainty in\nmind (In Detail 2.1). This should be done whenever one is learning about an environmental issue, whether it\ninvolves listening to a speaker in a classroom, at a conference, or on video, or when reading an article in a\nnewspaper,textbook, website, orscientificjournal. Because oftheuncertaintyofmanypredictions inscience,\nandparticularlyintheenvironmentalrealm,acertainamountofscepticismandcriticalanalysisisalwaysuseful.\nEnvironmental issues are acutely important to the welfare of people and other species. Science and its\nmethods allow for a critical and objective identification of key issues, the investigation of their causes, and\na degree of understanding of the consequences of environmental change. Scientific information influences\ndecisionmakingaboutenvironmentalissues,includingwhethertopursueexpensivestrategiestoavoidfurther,\nbut often uncertain, damage.\n38 | Chapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World Scientificinformation is,however,onlyone consideration fordecision makers, whoarealso concernedwith\nthe economic, cultural, and political contexts of environmental problems (see Environmental Issues 1.1 and\nChapter 27). In fact, when deciding how to deal with the causes and consequences of environmental changes,\ndecisionmakersmaygivegreaterweighttonon-scientific(socialandeconomic)considerationsthantoscientific\nones,especiallywhenthereisuncertaintyaboutthelatter.Themostimportantdecisionsaboutenvironmental\nissues are made by politicians and senior bureaucrats in government, or by private managers, rather than by\nenvironmentalscientists.Decisionmakerstypicallyworryabouttheshort-termimplicationsoftheirdecisions\nontheirchancesforre-electionorcontinuedemployment,andontheeconomicactivityofacompanyorsociety\nat large, as much as they do about the consequences of environmental damage (see also Chapter 27).\nIn Detail 2.1. Critical Evaluation of an Overload of Information\nMore so than any previous society, we live today in a world of easy and abundant information. It has\nbecomeremarkablyeasyforpeopletocommunicatewithothersovervastdistances,turningtheworld\ninto a \u201cglobal village\u201d (a phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980), a Canadian philosopher, to\ndescribe the phenomenon of universal networking). This global connectedness has been facilitated by\ntechnologiesfortransferringideasandknowledge\u2014particularlyelectroniccommunicationdevices,such\nasradio,television,computers,andtheirnetworks.Today,thesetechnologiescompressspaceandtime\nto achieve a virtually instantaneous communication. In fact, so much information is now available that\nthe situation is often referred to as an \u201cinformation overload\u201d that must be analyzed critically. Critical\nanalysisistheprocessofsortinginformationandmakingscientificenquiriesaboutdata.Involvedinall\naspectsofthescientificprocess,criticalanalysisscrutinizesinformationandresearchbyposingsensible\nquestions such as the following:\n\u2022 Is the information derived from a scientific framework consisting of a hypothesis that has been\ndeveloped and tested, within the context of an existing body of knowledge and theory in the field?\n\u2022 Werethemethodologiesusedlikelytoprovidedatathatareobjective,accurate,andprecise?Were\nthe data analyzed by statistical methods that are appropriate to the data structure and to the\nquestions being asked?\n\u2022 Were the results of the research compared with other pertinent work that has been previously\npublished?Werekeysimilaritiesanddifferencesdiscussedandaconclusiondeducedaboutwhatthe\nnew work reveals about the issue being investigated?\n\u2022 Is the information based on research published in a refereed journal\u2014one that requires highly\nqualifiedreviewersinthesubjectareatoscrutinizethework,followedbyaneditorialdecisionabout\nwhether it warrants publication?\n\u2022 If the analysis of an issue was based on incomplete or possibly inaccurate information, was a\nprecautionary approach used in order to accommodate the uncertainty inherent in the\nrecommendations?Allusersofpublishedresearchhaveanobligationtocriticallyevaluatewhatthey\narereadinginthesewaysinordertodecidewhetherthetheoryisappropriate,themethodologies\nreliable, and the conclusions sufficiently robust. Because so many environmental issues are\ncontroversial, with data and information presented on both sides of the debate, people need to\nbe able to formulate objectively critical judgments. For this reason, people need a high degree\nof environmental literacy\u2014an informed understanding of the causes and consequences of\nenvironmental damages. Being able to critically analyze information is a key personal benefit of\nstudying environmental science.\nChapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World | 39 Conclusions\nThe procedures and methods of science are important in the identifying, understanding, and resolving\nenvironmental problems. At the same time, however, social and economic issues are also vital considerations.\nAlthough science has made tremendous progress in helping us to understand the natural world, the extreme\ncomplexityofbiologyandecosystemsmakesitdifficultforenvironmentalscientiststomakereliablepredictions\nabout the consequences of many human economic activities and other influences. This context underscores\ntheneedforcontinuedstudyofthescientificandsocio-economicdimensionsofenvironmentalproblems,even\nwhile practical decisions must be made to deal with obvious issues as they arise.\nQuestions for Review\n1. Outline the reasons why science is a rational way of understanding the natural world.\n2. What are the differences between inductive and deductive logic? Why is inductive logic more often used by\nscientists when formulating hypotheses and generalizations about the natural world?\n3. Why are null hypotheses an efficient way to conduct scientific research? Identify a hypothesis that is\nsuitable for examining a specific problem in environmental science and suggest a corresponding null\nhypothesis that could be examined through research.\n4. What are the causes of variation in natural phenomena? Choose an example, such as differences in the\nbody weights of a defined group of people, and suggest reasons for the variation.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. What are the key differences between science and a less objective belief system, such as religion?\n2. What factors result in scientific controversies about environmental issues? Contrast these with\nenvironmental controversies that exist because of differing values and world views.\n3. Explain why there are no scientific \u201claws\u201d to explain the structure and function of ecosystems.\n4. Many natural phenomena are highly variable, particularly ones that are biological or ecological. What are\nthe implications of this variability for understanding and predicting the causes and consequences of\nenvironmental changes? How do environmental scientists cope with this challenge of a variable natural\nworld?\nExploring Issues\n1. Devise an environmental question of interest to yourself. Suggest useful hypotheses to investigate, identify\nthe null hypotheses, and outline experiments that you might conduct to provide answers to this question.\n2. During a research project investigating mercury, an environmental scientist performed a series of chemical\nanalyses of fish caught in Lake Canuck. The sampling program involved seven species of fish obtained from\nvarious habitats within the lake. A total of 360 fish of various sizes and sexes were analyzed. It was\n40 | Chapter 2 ~ Science as a Way of Understanding the Natural World discovered that 30% of the fish had residue levels greater than 0.5 ppm of mercury, the upper level of\ncontamination recommended by Health Canada for fish eaten by humans. The scientist reported these\nresults to a governmental regulator, who was alarmed by the high mercury residues because of Lake\nCanuck\u2019s popularity as a place where people fish for food. The regulator asked the scientist to recommend\nwhether it was safe to eat any fish from the lake or whether to avoid only certain sizes, sexes, species, or\nhabitats.

Understanding these subjects is important in environmental\nscience because they provide a context for interpreting many of the changes that are being caused by human\nactivities.\nPlanet Earth\nThe universe is thought to have originated as many as 12-15 billion years ago during a ginormous cataclysm\nknownasthe\u201cbig bang.\u201dInitially,virtuallyall ofthemass ofthenascentuniverse consistedofthetwolightest\nelements, hydrogen and helium, which existed as an extremely diffuse gaseous mass. Eventually, under the\npervasive influence of gravity, the hydrogen and helium were aggregated into immense masses that became\nincreasingly compressed under enormously high pressure and temperature. When the pressure and\ntemperatureweresufficientlyintense,nuclearfusionreactionsbegantooccurwithinthemasses,atwhichpoint\ntheyhadbecomeyoungstars.Inadditiontoreleasingimmensequantitiesofenergy,thefusionreactionscaused\ntheformationofheavierelements.Becauseoftheseprocesses,therearenow88naturallyoccurringelements.\nHydrogenandheliumarestill,however,themostabundantelements,comprisingmorethan99.9%ofthemass\nof the universe.\nThe Sun is an ordinary star, one of billions of billions that exist in the universe. The Sun, its eight orbiting\nplanets,plusmiscellaneouscomets,meteors,asteroids,andothermaterials(suchasspacedust)arecollectively\nknown as the solar system. This particular region of the universe is organized and held together by a balance\nof the attractive force of gravitation and counteracting influences associated with rotation and orbiting (these\nsameforces,along withcontinuing expansion fromtheinitialbigbang,alsoorganizetheuniverse).Theageof\nthe solar system (and of Earth) is at least 4.6 billion years.\n42 | Chapter 3 ~ The Physical World Earthisthethird-closestplanettotheSun.Earthisadenseplanet,asareotherso-calledterrestrialplanets\nlocatedrelativelyclosetotheSun:Mercury,Venus,andMars.Themassoftheseplanetsconsistsalmostentirely\nofheavierelementssuchasiron,nickel,magnesium,aluminum,andsilicon.Theseinnerplanetswereformedby\naselective condensing of heavier elements out of the primordial planetary nebula (the disk of gases and other\nmatterthatslowlyrotatedaroundtheSunduringtheearlystagesofformationofitssolarsystem).Thishappened\nbecause the inner planets were subjected to relatively intense heating by solar radiation, which caused lighter\ngasessuchashydrogenandheliumtodispersefurtheraway,totheextentthattheyendedupmostlyintheouter,\ncooler planets. Meanwhile the terrestrial planets retained heavier elements. Consequently, the more distant\nplanets in the solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are relatively large, gaseous, and diffuse in character.\nMostoftheirvolumeiscomposedofanextensiveatmosphereofhydrogenandhelium,althoughtheseplanets\nmay contain heavier elements in their core.\nEarth is the only place in the universe that is definitely known to sustain life. It is quite possible, however,\nthat other planets in the cosmos also sustain life. Although there is no direct evidence of this, many scientists\nconsideritlikelythatlifehasevolvedelsewhere.Oneestimatesuggeststhattheuniversecontains1022(10,000\nbillionbillion)stars,withperhaps10%ofthemhavingplanetarysystems(1021systems).Withsuchincrediblylarge\nnumbers, it is highly probable that at least some of the billions of billions of other planetary systems support\nsuitable conditions for a genesis of life, in addition to what occurred on Earth.\nEarthisasphericalbodywithadiameterofabout12,740km.ItrevolvesaroundtheSuninanellipticalorbit,at\nanaveragedistanceofabout149millionkm,completinganorbitin365.26days,oroneyear.Earthalsorotates\non its axis every 24 hours, or one day. Its single moon has a diameter of about 3,474 km and a mass about 2%\nthatofEarth.TheMoonrevolvesaroundEarthinanellipticalorbitatanaveragedistanceofabout385,000km,\ncompleted every 27.3 days (the lunar month).\nThe sphere of Earth is composed of four layers\u2014the core, mantle, lithosphere, and crust\u2014arranged in\nconcentric layers like an onion. The massive core has a diameter of about 3,500 km and is composed of hot,\nmolten metals, particularly iron and nickel. The internal heat of Earth is thought to be generated by the slow,\nradioactive decay of unstable isotopes of certain elements, such as uranium.\nThemantleisalessdenseregionthatenclosesthecore.Itisabout2,800kmthickandcomposedofminerals\nin a plastic, semi-liquid state known as magma. The mantle contains relatively light elements, notably silicon,\noxygen, and magnesium, occurring as various mineral compounds. Magma from the upper mantle sometimes\nerupts to the surface at mountainous vents known as volcanoes and is usually spewed to the surface as lava,\nwhich cools to form basaltic rock.\nThenextlayer,thelithosphere,isonlyabout80kmthickandismadeofrigid,relativelylightrocks,especially\nbasaltic,granitic,andsedimentaryones.Theserockscontainelementsfoundinthemantleaswellasenriched\nquantities of aluminum, carbon, calcium, potassium, sodium, sulphur, and other lighter elements.\nThe outermost layer is known as the crust. Oceanic crust is relatively thin, averaging 10\u201315 km, while\ncontinental crust is 20\u201360 km thick. Earth\u2019s crust has an extremely complex mineralogical composition, in\ncontrast to the mantle and especially the core, which are thought to be relatively uniform in structure and\nconstitution. The most abundant elements in the crust are oxygen (45%), silicon (27%), aluminum (8.0%), iron\n(5.8%), calcium (5.1%), magnesium (2.8%), sodium (2.3%), potassium (1.7%), titanium (0.86%), vanadium (0.17%),\nhydrogen (0.14%), phosphorus (0.10%), and carbon (0.032%).\nTherocksformingthecrustcanbegroupedintothreebasictypes:igneous,sedimentary,andmetamorphic.\nIgneous rocks include basalt and granite, which are formed by the cooling of molten magma. The mineral\nforms depend on the rate of cooling plus other factors. Basalt is a heavy, dark, extremely fine-grained rock\nthat sometimes forms vertical, columnar structures. Basaltic rocks are the major constituent of oceanic crust,\noriginating in submarine places where magmic lava erupts to the sea-floor surface, such as deep-ocean\nspreadingzonesandabyssalvolcanoes.Basaltcanalsobeformedatterrestrialvolcanoes\u2013forinstance,itisthe\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 43 basementrockoftheHawaiianarchipelagoandothervolcanicislands.Graniticrocksdominatethecontinental\ncrust, are typically relatively light in colour and density, and are coarser-grained, with readily distinguishable\ncrystals.Thecomplexcrystallinestructureincludesthemineralsquartzandfeldspar,andmicaandhornblende\nare often present.\nSedimentary rocks include limestone, dolomite, shale, sandstone, and conglomerates. These form from\nparticles eroded from other rocks or from precipitated minerals such as calcite (CaCO3) that become lithified\n(turnedintostone)undergreatpressureindeepoceanicdeposits.Sedimentaryrockstypicallyoverliebasalticor\ngranitic rocks.\nMetamorphic rocks are formed from igneous or sedimentary ones that were changed under the combined\ninfluencesofmassivegeologicalheatandpressure.Theseconditionswereencounteredwhentheprimaryrocks\nwerecarrieddeepintothelithospherebycrustalmovements,suchasthoseassociatedwithmountainbuilding\n(describedbelow).Gneiss,forexample,isametamorphicrockderivedfromgranite,whilemarbleisderivedfrom\nlimestone,andslatefromshale.About30%ofEarth\u2019ssurfaceiscoveredbythesolidsubstratesofcontinentsand\nislands.Theother70%ofEarth\u2019ssurfaceisliquidwater,almostallofwhichisoceanic.Inaddition,Earth\u2019sdense\nsphereisimmersedinagaseousenvelopeknownastheatmosphere,whichextendstoadistanceofabout1,000\nkm. However, about 99% of the mass of the atmosphere occurs within 30 km of the planet\u2019s surface.\nGeological Dynamics\nThroughout its history, Earth has been subject to enormous geological forces that have greatly affected its\nmineralogical composition and surface features. The predominant influences are tectonic forces, which are\nassociatedwithcrustalmovementsandotherprocessesthatcausestructuraldeformationofrocksandminerals.\nGeological forces also cause the continents and their underlying plates to slowly move about Earth\u2019s surface,\nmuchlikeraftsofsolidrockridinguponaseaofplasticmagma.Mountainrangesarebuiltwherecrustalplates\ncollide and push up surface rocks.\nEarthquakes and volcanoes are also tectonic phenomena, which influence Earth\u2019s crust and surface with\nextremely powerful, sometimes disastrous events. Other massive geological forces include rare, cataclysmic\nstrikesintoourplanetbymeteoritesandextensiveglaciationassociatedwithcoolingoftheclimate.Slowerbut\nstillpervasivegeologicalforcesareerosion(causedbywater,wind,andgravity)andweathering(thefracturing\nof rocks and dissolution of minerals).\nOver geological time, these various physical processes have profoundly influenced the character of Earth.\nGeologicalforcescontinuetohaveenormousinfluencesonEarthanditsecosystems,overbothshort-andlong-\nterm time scales. Environmental changes associated with these geological dynamics provide a natural context\nfor the substantial changes that humans are now causing through their economic activities.\nMeteorites\nEarth is frequently struck by fast-moving rocky or metallic objects from space known as meteorites. Although\nmeteorites are relatively small objects (by planetary standards), they have immense momentum because of\ntheirspeed,whichtypicallyrangesfrom10-100km/s.Thesmallest,mostnumerousmeteoritesreachingEarth\ntypicallyburnuporexplodeintheatmospherebecauseofheatgeneratedbyfriction,butlargeronesmaysurvive\n44 | Chapter 3 ~ The Physical World toimpactthesurface.Ithasbeenestimatedthateachdayameteoriteweighingatleast100gstrikesthesurface\nsomewhere in Canada.\nVerylargemeteoritesareextremelyrare,butiftheimpactthesurfaceenormousdamageiscaused.Theimpact\nsiteistypicallyobliteratedandalargecraterisformedbecausevastamountsofcrustalmaterialsareejectedinto\nthe atmosphere.

Paleontologists recognize these cataclysms by the occurrence of rapid changes in the fossil\nrecord,whichpointtoatransitionbetweenstagesinthegeologicaltimescale(Table3.1).Accordingtosurviving\nevidence, the most intense mass extinction event occurred 245 million years ago at the end of the Permian\nperiod, when an astonishing 96% of species may have become extinct. Another mass extinction occurred 65\nmillionyearsagoattheendoftheCretaceousperiod,whenperhaps76%ofspeciesbecameextinct,including\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 45 thelastofthedinosaurs.Accordingtoonetheory,theend-of-Cretaceousextinctionswerecausedwhena10\u201315\nkmwide meteoriteimpactedtheEarth.Thisresultedinthathugeamountsoffine dustbeing spewedintothe\nupperatmosphere,whichcausedaseverecoolingoftheclimatethatlargeanimalsandmanyecosystemscould\nnottolerate.SomegeologistsbelievethattheimpactsitewasneartheYucatancoastofMexico,whereaburied,\n170-km-wideringstructureexists,datedtoabout65millionyearsold.Althoughcontroversial,thetheoryofrare,\nmeteorite-caused catastrophes has also been used to explain other mass extinctions in the geological record.\nTable 3.1. The Geological Time Scale. The divisions between geological time stages are assigned on\nthe basis of rapid changes in mineralogy and in species composition of the fossil record. These are\nrelatedtoeventsofmass extinction, which werefollowedbytheevolutionaryradiation ofnewspecies\nand families. The record is most detailed for relatively recent times, because the fossil remains are\nmore complete. Time is given in Mya (millions of years ago) and indicates the beginning of each time\nstage. For example, the Holocene epoch ranges from 0.01 Mya (10,000 years ago) to the present; the\nPleistocene ranges from 1.6 million years ago to 0.01 Mya.\nPlate Tectonics\nThe theory of plate tectonics concerns the dynamics of surface crustal materials. In simple terms, this theory\nsuggests that the crust and mantle behave as an enormous convecting system that, at the surface, is\ncharacterizedbyextremelyslowmovementsofhugeplatesofrigidcrustalmaterial.Theplatesmovefromzones\nwhere they are created by an upwelling of magma from the upper mantle, toward other zones where they are\n46 | Chapter 3 ~ The Physical World destroyedbydownwardmovementintotheupperthemantle.Inthecreationzones,theplasticmagmarisesto\nthesurface,solidifies,andthenextendslaterallyinaprocessknownassea-floorspreading.Inthedown-welling\nzones,thereisasubductionofsea-floorcrustbackdownintothemantle,whereitisre-meltedandconvected\nlaterally.Themagmamayeventuallyreachanotherupwellingregionandagainbecarriedtothecrust.Theslowly\nmoving, rigid plates of surface crust have a basement of basaltic rock, with lighter, granitic-based continents\nrafting on the surface of some of the oceanic plates (Figure 3.1).\nFigure 3.1. Tectonic Forces. (a) The continents are viewed as granitic islands that are rafting upon\nunderlying plates of basaltic oceanic crust. (b) Heat and density gradients in the mantle cause a slow,\nconvective circulation to develop in the molten magma. This circulation forms new basaltic crust at\nzones of magmic upwelling known as mid-oceanic ridges, followed by lateral sea-floor spreading and\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 47 eventual subduction back to the mantle at the boundary with another crustal plate.\nFor example, in the Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between the Americas and Europe and Africa, a deep-sea\ngeologicalstructurecalledtheMid-AtlanticRidgerunsinaroughlynorthtosouthdirection.Thisabyssalridge\nisazoneofsea-floorspreading,fromwhichthetwocontinentalregionsaredivergingataslowbutsteadyrate\nof 2-4 cm/year.

This primeval super-continent, referred to as Pangaea, was surrounded by a single, global ocean.\nHowever,divergentforcesofcrustalplatesmovingindifferentdirectionsthenpulledPangaeaapart,initiallyinto\ntwo masses known as Laurasia and Gondwanaland, and then into the existing continents of North and South\nAmerica, Africa, Eurasia, Australia, and Antarctica.\nAn earthquake is a trembling or movement of the Earth caused by a sudden release of geological stresses\nat some point within the crust or upper mantle. Earthquakes are most often caused when crustal plates slip\nacrossorbeneatheachotherattheirfaults,buttheycanalsobecausedbyavolcanicexplosion.Althoughtheir\nseismic energy can affect a large area, earthquakes have a spatial focus, known as the epicentre and defined\nas the surface position lying above the deep point of energy release. An intense earthquake can cause great\ndamagetobuildings,andthecollapsingstructures,fires,andotherdestructioncantakeagreattollonpeople.\nIn 1556 an earthquake struck Shanxi Province in China and caused about 830,000 deaths, making it the most\ndeadlyearthquakeinrecordedhistory.ThemostfamouscatastrophicearthquakeinNorthAmericawastheSan\nFrancisco event in 1906, caused by slippage along the San Andreas Fault, which killed 503 people and resulted\nin tremendous physical damage.

Unfortunately, none of the countries that bore the brunt of the\ndevastation were forewarned of the impending catastrophe, so no action was taken to move people\nfrom low-lying coastal areas to higher ground. This happened mostly because there was no tsunami-\ndetectionsystemintheIndianOcean,althoughnegligencewasalsoinvolvedbecausetheextremelylarge\nearthquake should have alerted civil authorities to a potential catastrophe.\nThecolossaltsunamiwavesweremovingatspeedsofabout60km/hrwhentheyimpactedtheshore.\nThey caused widespread devastation and more than 225,000 deaths by drowning and injuries caused\nby floating debris and collapsing buildings. The hardest-hit places were Sumatra (which suffered at\nleast 168,000 dead and missing), Sri Lanka (35,000), the eastern coast and islands of India (18,000),\nand Thailand (8,000). At least 7,000 of the deaths were tourists from developed countries who were\nvisitingcoastalresortsduringtheirholidaybreak.Inadditiontothemortality,tensofmillionsofpeople\nwere displaced from their homes and livelihoods by the flooding. In many of the worst-hit places, the\ndamage wasmade muchmoreseverebecause ofincreasedcoastal vulnerabilitycausedbythe removal\nofpreviouslyabundantmangroveforest,mostlytodeveloptouristresortsandbrackishpondsforshrimp\naquaculture. Where mangroves remained intact, the coastal forest provided a sea-wall that helped to\nabsorb much of the force of the tsunami, providing a measure of protection to areas further inland.\nRespondingtotheoverwhelmingtollofdeathanddestruction,citizensandgovernmentsofmanynon-\naffectedcountriesdeliveredlargedonationsofaidforrescueandsubsequentrecovery,includingmoney\n(pledges totalled about US$5.4 billion), specialized rescue personnel, food and water, and materials\nfor reconstruction. From the environmental perspective, important lessons to be learned from this\ndevastating tsunami include the facts that natural disasters are unpredictable and inevitable, and that\nthe ensuing destruction can be made much worse by inappropriate land-use practices and a lack of\nemergency planning and response capability.\nImage 3.2.

Freedman.\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 53 Weathering and Erosion\nMeteorite impacts, earthquakes, volcanic explosions, and glaciation are all tremendous geological forces \u2013\nthey are capable of obliterating both natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. However, less forceful geological\ndynamics are also important, although they exert their influences more pervasively, by operating relatively\nslowly over longer time scales rather than as extremely destructive events.\nWeathering refers to physical and chemical processes by which rocks and minerals are broken down by\nenvironmentalagents.Non-biological(abiotic)forcesofweatheringincluderain,wind,andtemperaturechanges\n(especially freeze-thaw cycles). Biological forces include the rock-cracking powers that are exerted by plant\nroots. Weathering proceeds by the fracturing of rocks and by the solubilization (chemical decomposition) of\nminerals by acidic rainwater and by corrosive excretions of plant roots and microorganisms.\nErosion refers to the removal of rocks and soil through the actions of gravity, flowing water, ice, and wind.\nErosion is a pervasive geological process, occurring at various rates in all environments. Usually it is gradual,\noccurring as particles are slowly removed by flowing water or blowing wind, or when dissolved minerals are\ncarriedawaybyundergroundflowsofwater.However,erosionalsooccursasmassevents,suchasalandslide\nin steep terrain.

The somewhat less ancient hills of the Appalachians of eastern North\nAmerica, which extend into New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, are also the eroded relics of a\nonce-great mountain range.

The major elements of the global hydrologic cycle are illustrated in Figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2. Major Elements of the Hydrologic Cycle. The hydrologic cycle includes the influences of\noceans and other kinds of surface water (such as lakes and rivers), as well as groundwater and\natmospheric moisture (occurring as clouds and humidity). Water evaporates, precipitates as rain and\nsnow, and flows in various kinds of channels, both along the surface as well as underground.\nEachcompartmentofthehydrologiccyclehasbothinputandoutputfluxes,andthesumofalloftheseelements\ncomprises the cycle.

For example, a\nparticular area may temporarily flood or dry out. In addition, local hydrological conditions can change over\nthe long term. Glaciation, for example, stores immense quantities of solid water on land, and excessive use of\ngroundwater can deplete an artesian reservoir (aquifer).\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 55 Image3.4.Theglobalhydrologiccycleinvolveswatermovementthroughtheatmosphere,onthesurface,\nand underground, as well as storage in oceans, lakes, glaciers, and groundwater.

The oceans are the largest hydrological compartment, accounting for about 97.4% of all water on the\nplanet.\n2. Surface waters occur on the landmasses and account for 2.3% of global water. Almost all that amount is\ntied up in glaciers, mostly in Antarctica and Greenland, with lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and other surface\nbodies of liquid water amounting to only 0.002%.\n3. Groundwater accounts for 0.32% of global water. Groundwater can occur in relatively shallow soil horizons,\nwhere it is accessible for uptake by plants, or it can drain laterally into surface waters such as lakes and\nstreams. Deeper groundwater is inaccessible for these purposes and it forms artesian reservoirs in spaces\nwithin porous or fractured bedrock. Such aquifers receive water infiltrating by deep drainage from above or\nby long-distance underground transport from nearby upland areas.\n4. Atmospheric water accounts for only about 0.001% of the global total. It can occur as a gas, vapour (tiny,\nsuspended droplets), or solid (ice crystals), all of which are highly variable over space and time. A cloud is a\ndense aggregation of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere, while gaseous water is invisible. Note that the\nmaximum amount of water a volume of atmosphere can hold is highly dependent on temperature, with\nwarmer air having a much greater water-storage capacity than cold air. The term humidity refers to the\nactual concentration of water in the atmosphere (measured in g/m3), while relative humidity expresses\n56 | Chapter 3 ~ The Physical World actual humidity as a percentage of the saturation value for a particular temperature.\nTable 3.2. The Hydrologic Cycle. This table shows the quantity of water involved in various global\ncompartments and fluxes. Source of data: Botkin and Keller (2014).\nEvaporation is a change of state of water from a liquid to a gas, or from a solid directly to a gas (evaporation\ndirectly from ice or snow is more properly referred to as sublimation).

The atmosphere consists of four layers, the boundaries of which are inexact because they\nmay vary over time and space:\n1. The troposphere (or lower atmosphere) contains 85-90% of the atmospheric mass and extends from the\nsurface to an altitude of 8-20 km. It is thinner at high latitudes, and thicker at equatorial latitudes, but also\nvaries seasonally, at any place being thicker during the summer than in the winter. It is typical for air\ntemperature to decrease with increasing altitude within the troposphere, and convective air currents\n(winds) are common. Consequently, the troposphere is sometimes referred to as the \u201cweather layer.\u201d\n2. The stratosphere extends from the troposphere to as high as about 50 km, depending on the season and\nlatitude. Air temperature varies little with altitude within the stratosphere, and there are few convective air\ncurrents.\n3. The mesosphere extends beyond the stratosphere to about 75 km.\n4. The thermosphere extends to 450 km or more.\nImage 3.5. The atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases, fine particulates, and water vapour\noccurring as clouds. This view of a foggy tropical forest was taken in the highlands of Peru. Source: B.\nFreedman\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 59 Beyond the atmosphere is outer space, an immeasurably vast region where the Earth exerts no detectable\nchemical or thermal influences.\nAbout 78% of the mass of the atmosphere is composed of nitrogen gas (N2), while 21% is oxygen (O2), 0.9%\nargon (Ar), and 0.04% carbon dioxide (CO2). The rest is various trace gases, including potentially toxic ones\nsuch as ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) (see Chapter 16).

Wind directions are also influenced by the Coriolis effect, which is caused by the west-to-east\nrotation of Earth. For example, in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, the distribution of pressure\nin the lower atmosphere provides a northward force on wind direction. The Coriolis force, which deflects\nmotions to the right in that hemisphere, balances the pressure-gradient force so that the winds tend to blow\nfrom west to east. In comparison, in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, the pressure gradient\nforceisdirectedtowardthesouth, while theCoriolis forcedeflectsmotions totheleft.Onbalance,thisagain\nresults in winds tending to blow from west to east. Local patterns of wind flow are also influenced by surface\ntopography\u2014mountains are barriers that deflect winds upward or around, while valleys can channel wind flows.\nPrevailing winds blow relatively continuously in a dominant direction. There are three major classes of\nprevailing winds:\n1. trade winds are tropical airflows that blow from the northeast (to the southwest) in the Northern\nHemisphere, and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere\n2. westerlies are mid-latitude winds that blow from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere, and from the\nnorthwest in the Southern Hemisphere\n3. polar easterlies blow from the northeast at high northern latitudes, and from the southeast near Antarctica.\nClimate and Weather\nClimatereferstotheprevailingatmosphericconditionsoftemperature,precipitation,humidity,windspeedand\ndirection(together,thesearewindvelocity),insolation(incomingsolarradiation),visibility,fog,andcloudcover\ninaplaceorregion.Climaticdataareusuallycalculatedasstatistics(suchasaveragesorrangesofvalues),using\ndataobtainedfromatleastseveraldecadesofmonitoring(thepreferredperiodforthecalculationof\u201cnormal\u201d\nclimatic parameters is at least 30 years).\n60 | Chapter 3 ~ The Physical World Incontrast,weatherreferstoday-to-dayorinstantaneousmeteorologicalconditions(thelatterisreferredto\nas\u201creal-time\u201dweather).Becauseweatherisrelatedtoshort-termconditions,itismuchmorevariableovertime\nandspacethanclimate.Mostaspectsofclimatearefunctionsofsolarinsolationandofhowthisincomingenergy\nisabsorbed,reflected,andre-radiatedbytheatmosphere,oceans,andterrestrialsurfaces.Thecomplexsubject\nofphysicalenergybudgetsisdescribedinChapter4.Forthepresentpurpose,itisworthwhiletoexamineseveral\necologically important aspects:\n\u2022 Give Thanks to the Sun.If it were not for the warming influence of solar radiation, the temperature of the\nsurface and atmosphere would approach the coldest that is physically possible \u2013 this is absolute zero, or\n-273\u00b0C (or 0o on the Kelvin scale). Although Earth has a limited ability to generate its own heat by the decay\nof radioactive elements in its core, this is insufficient to provide much warming at the surface. Therefore,\nsolar energy is critical to maintaining the surface temperature within a range that organisms can tolerate.\n\u2022 Atmospheric Reflection and Absorption.Conditions in the atmosphere have a great influence on climatic\nfactors. For instance, cloud cover and tiny particulates are highly reflective of many visible wavelengths of\nsolar radiation and so have a marked cooling effect on the lower atmosphere and the surface. In addition,\nthe atmosphere contains trace concentrations of certain gases that absorb some of the infrared radiation\nthat the planet emits to cool itself of the heat obtained by absorbing solar radiation. The most important of\nthese so-called \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d are water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane. This influence is called\nthe greenhouse effect, and it maintains the surface temperature of Earth at an average of about 15\u00b0C, or\n33\u00b0C warmer than the -18\u00b0C it would be without this moderating effect (see Chapters 4 and 17).\n\u2022 Night and Day.At any place on the surface, the input of solar radiation is high during the day and low at\nnight. (At night, the only radiation inputs are from distant stars and from solar radiation reflected by\natmospheric particulates and the moon\u2014these sparse inputs are known as \u201cskylight.\u201d) The daily, 24-hour\n(diurnal) variations in energy input result in large changes in weather. However, this effect varies greatly\nbetween tropical and polar latitudes. Tropical regions have approximately equal day and night lengths of\nabout 12 hours each, which do not vary much during the year. In contrast, polar latitudes are much more\nseasonal, with almost continuous light during much of the summer, and constant night during part of the\nwinter. Temperate latitudes are intermediate, with longer day lengths during the summer and shorter ones\nduring winter.\n\u2022 Effects of Latitude.Places at tropical latitudes tend to face incoming solar radiation on a relatively\nperpendicular angle (closer to 90\u00b0 at noon). Polar latitudes have a more oblique angle of solar incidence,\nand temperate latitudes are intermediate in this regard. The more perpendicular the angle of incidence of\nsolar radiation is, the smaller the surface area over which the incoming energy is distributed and the more\nintense the resulting heating. The angle of solar incidence has a strong influence on the amounts of unit-\narea solar radiation that are received at various latitudes, and is a major reason (along with seasonality) why\nthe tropics are warmer than polar regions.\n\u2022 Seasons.Earth\u2019s axis tilts at a 23.5\u00b0 angle relative to the incidence of solar radiation. Consequently, during\nthe planet\u2019s annual revolution around the Sun, there are seasonal differences in energy received between\nthe Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, the angle of incidence is closer to\nperpendicular from March 21 to September 22, giving relatively warmer conditions, while the angle is more\noblique from September 22 to March 21, resulting in cooler conditions. These seasons are reversed in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. Because Earth\u2019s orbit is elliptical, climatic seasons are also influenced by the varying\ndistance from the Sun. However, this effect is relatively small compared with that of the inclination of the\naxis.\n\u2022 Aspect.On a local scale, the direction that a slope faces (known as its aspect) has a substantial influence on\nthe amount of solar radiation received. In the Northern Hemisphere, south-facing, and to a lesser degree\nChapter 3 ~ The Physical World | 61 west-facing slopes are relatively warm, while north- and east-facing slopes are cooler. In the Southern\nHemisphere, north-facing slopes are warmer.\n\u2022 Slope.The degree of slope, or the angle of inclination of the land, also affects the amount of energy\nreceived. The closer the slope approximates a perpendicular angle to incoming solar radiation, the greater\nis the energy input per unit of surface area. In the Northern Hemisphere, this effect is greatest on south-\nfacing slopes.\n\u2022 Soil and Vegetation Cover.Darker surfaces absorb much more solar radiation than do lighter surfaces. This\nis the reason why a black asphalt surface gets much hotter during the day than one made of light-coloured\ncement. Plant canopies also vary in their absorption and reflection characteristics, depending on the colour\nof the foliage and the angle at which it is oriented to incoming solar radiation. Major changes in the\ncharacter of vegetation, as occur when forest is converted into agricultural or urban land-use, can affect\nlocal, and sometimes regional, weather and climate.\n\u2022 Snow and Ice Cover.Because snow and ice are highly reflective of solar radiation, surfaces covered by\nthose materials absorb relatively little insolation. The melting of snow cover in the springtime exposes a\nmuch more absorptive ground surface, and warming then accelerates.\n\u2022 Evaporation of Water.Moist surfaces are cooled by the evaporation of water, a process that absorbs\nthermal energy. Therefore, the transpiration of water from plant foliage has a cooling effect, similar to the\nevaporation of sweat from the body surface of a human.\nTheabovefactorsinfluencetheinput,reflection,absorption,anddissipationofsolarradiation,resultinginlarge\nvariationsofair,water,andsurfacetemperaturesoverthesurfaceofEarth.Theenergygradientsthatdevelop\nresult in global processes that attempt to distribute the energy more evenly, by movements of air masses in\ntheatmosphere(winds)andcurrentsofwaterintheoceans.Inaddition,prevailingwinddirectionscaninteract\nwithoceaniccurrentstogeneratecircularwaterflowsknownasgyres.Subtropicalgyresrotateclockwiseinthe\nNorthern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, while subpolar gyres rotate in the\nopposite directions.\nClimatehasanimportantinfluenceonthecharacterofecologicaldevelopmentinanyregionorplace.Climatic\nconditions can vary on a large scale, called macroclimate, which affects the nature of ecosystems over a large\narea.

In general, places with cold temperatures develop tundra vegetation,\nwhereas warmer temperatures may support forest. Temperate and polar latitudes have large seasonal\nfluctuations in temperature.

Consider the following aspects: (a) the number of monitoring\nsites, (b) where monitoring sites should be located, (c) what variables to measure (such as wind,\ntemperature, precipitation, sunlight), and (d) how long you must monitor conditions before determining the\nnormal climate (as opposed to the weather).\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nAlvarez, W., E.G.

In physics, work is defined as the result of a force being applied over a distance. In all of the following\nexamples of work, energy is transformed and some measurable outcome is achieved:\n\u2022 A hockey stick strikes a puck, causing it to speed toward a target\n\u2022 A book is picked up from the floor, lifted, and then laid on a table\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 67 \u2022 A vehicle is driven along a road\n\u2022 Heat from a stove is absorbed by water in a kettle, causing it to become hotter and eventually to boil\n\u2022 The photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, converting the electromagnetic energy into a\nform that plants and algae can utilize to synthesize sugars\nEnergy can exist in various states, each of which is fundamentally different from the others. However, under\nsuitable conditions energy in any state can be converted into another one through physical or chemical\ntransformations. The states of energy can be grouped into three categories: electromagnetic, kinetic, and\npotential.\nElectromagnetic Energy\nElectromagnetic energy (or electromagnetic radiation) is associated with photons. These have properties of\nboth particles and waves and travel through space at a constant speed of 3 \u00d7 108m/s (the speed of light).\nElectromagnetic energy exists as a continuous spectrum of wavelengths, which (ordered from the shortest to\nlongestwavelengths)areknownasgamma,X-ray,ultraviolet,visiblelight,infrared,microwave,andradio(Figure\n4.1).Thehumaneyecanperceiveelectromagneticenergyoverarangeofwavelengthsofabout0.4to0.7\u03bcm,a\npartofthespectrumthatisreferredtoasvisibleradiationorlight(1\u03bcm,or1micrometre,is10\u20136m;seeAppendix\nA).\nFigure 4.1. The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The spectrum is divided into major regions on the basis of\nwavelength and is presented on a logarithmic scale (log10) in units of micrometres (1 \u00b5m = 10\u20133mm\n= 10\u20136m). Note the expansion of the visible component and the wavelength ranges for red, orange,\nyellow, green, blue, and violet colours.\nElectromagnetic energy is given off (or radiated) by all objects that have a surface temperature greater than\nabsolutezero(greaterthan-273\u00b0Cor0\u00b0K).Thesurfacetemperatureofabodydeterminestherateandspectral\nqualityoftheradiationitemits.Comparedwithacoolerbody,ahotteronehasamuchlargerrateofemission,\nandtheradiation isdominatedbyshorter,higher-energywavelengths.

The energy of the Sun is derived from nuclear fusion reactions involving hydrogen nuclei.\nThese reactions generate enormous quantities of thermal and electromagnetic energy. Solar\nelectromagnetic radiation is the most crucial source of energy that sustains ecological and biological\n68 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems processes.

Two classes of kinetic energy can be distinguished.\nMechanical kinetic energyis associated with any object that is in motion, meaning it is travelling from one\nplacetoanother.Forexample,ahockeypuckflyingthroughtheair,atrail-bikebeingriddenalongapath,adeer\nrunningthroughaforest,waterflowinginastream,oraplanetmovingthroughspaceareallexpressionsofthis\nkindofkineticenergy.Theamountofmechanicalkineticenergyisdeterminedbythemassofanobjectandits\nspeed.\nThermalkineticenergyisassociatedwiththeratethatatomsormoleculesarevibrating.Suchvibrationsare\nfrozenat-273\u00b0C(absolutezero),butareprogressivelymorevigorousathighertemperatures,correspondingtoa\nlarger content of thermal kinetic energy, which is also referred to as heat.\nPotential Energy\nPotential energy is the stored ability to perform work. To actually perform work, potential energy must be\ntransformed into electromagnetic or kinetic energy. There are a number of kinds of potential energy:\nGravitational potential energyresults from gravity, or the attractive forces that exist among all objects.\nFor example, water stored at any height above sea level contains gravitational potential energy. This can be\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 69 convertedintokineticenergyifthereisapathwaythatallowsthewatertoflowdownhill.Gravitationalpotential\nenergy can be converted into electrical energy through the technology of hydroelectric power plants.\nChemicalpotentialenergyisstoredinthebondsbetweenatomswithinmolecules.Chemicalpotentialenergy\ncanbeliberatedbyexothermicreactions(thosewhichleadtoanetreleaseofthermalenergy),asinthefollowing\nexamples:\n\u2022 Chemical potential energy is stored in the molecular bonds of sulphide minerals, such as iron sulphide\n(FeS2), and some of this energy is released when the sulphides are oxidized. Specialized bacteria can\nmetabolically tap the potential energy of sulphides to support their own productivity, through a process\nknown as chemosynthesis (this is further examined later in this chapter).\n\u2022 The ionic bonds of salts also store chemical potential energy. For example, when sodium chloride (table\nsalt, NaCl) is dissolved in water, ionic potential energy is released as heat, which slightly increases the\nwater temperature.\n\u2022 Hydrocarbons store energy in the bonds between their hydrogen and carbon atoms (hydrocarbons contain\nonly these atoms). The chemical potential energy of gasoline, a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, is liberated\nin an internal combustion engine and becomes mechanically transformed to achieve the kinetic energy of\nvehicular motion.\n\u2022 Organic compounds (biochemicals) produced metabolically by organisms also store large quantities of\npotential energy in their inter-atomic bonds. The typical energy density of carbohydrates is about 16.8 kJ/\ng, while that of proteins is 21.0 kJ/g, and lipids (or fats) 38.5 kJ/g. Many organisms store their energy\nreserves as fat because these biochemicals have such a high energy density.\nElectricalpotentialenergyresultsfromdifferencesinthequantityofelectrons,whicharesubatomic,negatively\ncharged particles that flow from areas of high density to areas where it is lower.

The\ninternationally accepted system for scientific units is the SI system (Syst\u00e8me International d\u2019Unit\u00e9s), and its\nrecommended unit for energy is the joule (J). One joule is defined as the energy required to accelerate 1 kg of\nmass at 1 m/s2(1 metre per second per second) over a distance of 1 m.\nAcalorie(orgram-calorie,abbreviationcal)isanotherunitofenergy.Onecalorieisequivalentto4.184J,and\nitisdefinedastheamountofenergyrequiredtoraisethetemperatureof1gofpurewaterby1\u00b0C(specifically,\nfrom15\u00b0Cto16\u00b0C).Note,however,thatthedietician\u2019s\u201cCalorie\u201disequivalentto1000calories(1Calorie=1kcal).\nHowever,theenergycontentofmanyfoodproductsisnowlistedinkJincountriesusingtheSIsystemofunits,\nsuch as Canada.\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 71 Energy Transformations\nAs was previously noted, energy can be transformed among its various states. For example, when solar\nelectromagneticradiationisabsorbedbyadarkobject,itistransformedintothermalenergyandtheabsorbing\nbodyincreasesintemperature.Thegravitationalpotentialenergyofwaterstoredataheightisconvertedinto\nthe kinetic energy of flowing water at a waterfall, which may be harnessed using hydroelectric technology\nto spin a turbine and generate electrical energy. As well, visible wavelengths of solar radiation are absorbed\nby chlorophyll, a green pigment in plant foliage, and some of the captured energy is converted into chemical\npotential energy of sugars via the biochemistry of photosynthesis.\nAll transformations of energy must behave according to certain physical principles, which are known as\nthe laws of thermodynamics. These are universal principles, meaning they are always true, regardless of the\ncircumstances.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, can be stated as follows:\nEnergycanundergotransformationsamongitsvariousstatesbutitisnevercreatedordestroyed;therefore,the\nenergycontentoftheuniverseremainsconstant.Aconsequenceofthislawisthatthereisalwaysazerobalance\namong the energy inputs to a system, any net storage within it, and the energy output from the system.\nConsiderthecaseofanautomobiledrivingalongahighway.Thevehicleconsumesgasoline,anenergyinput\nthatcanbemeasured.Thepotentialenergyofthefuelisconvertedintovariousotherkindsofenergy,including\nkineticenergyembodiedinforwardmotionofthevehicle,electricalenergypoweringthelightsandwindshield\nwipers, heat from friction between the vehicle and the atmosphere and road surface, and hot exhaust gases\n(thermalenergy)andunburnedfuel(chemicalpotentialenergy)thatareventedthroughthetailpipe.Overall,in\naccordancewiththefirstlawofthermodynamics,anaccuratemeasuringofallofthesetransformationswould\nfindthat,whiletheenergyofthegasoline wasconvertedintovariousotherforms,thetotalamountofenergy\nwas conserved (it remained constant).\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics\nThe second law of thermodynamics can be expressed as follows: Transformations of energy can occur\nspontaneouslyonlyunderconditionsinwhichthereisanincreaseintheentropyoftheuniverse.Entropyisa\nphysical attribute related to disorder, and is associated with the degree of randomness in the distributions of\nmatterandenergy.Astherandomness(disorder)increases,sodoesentropy.Adecreaseindisorderisreferredto\nasnegativeentropy.Consider,forexample,aninflatedballoon.Becauseofthepotentialenergyofitscompressed\ngases, that balloon may slowly leak its contents to the surrounding atmosphere, and it may even burst. Either\noftheseoutcomescanoccurinaspontaneouslyfashion, becausebothprocesses wouldrepresentanincrease\nin the entropy of the universe. This is because compressed gases are more highly ordered than those widely\ndispersedintheatmosphere.Incontrast,dispersedgasesintheatmospherewouldneverspontaneouslyrelocate\nto inflate a balloon. A balloon will only inflate only if energy is expended through a local application of work,\nsuchasbyapersonblowingintotheballoon.Inotherwords,energymustbeexpendedtocausealocaldecrease\n72 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems of entropy in a system. However, note that this energy cost itself gives rise to an increase in the entropy of\ntheuniverse.Forinstance,theeffortofapersoninflatingaballooninvolvesadditionalrespiration,whichuses\nbiochemical energy and results in heat being released into the environment.\nAnotherexampleconcernsplanetEarth.Theplanetcontinuouslyreceivessolarradiation,almostallofwhich\nis visible and near-infrared wavelengths in the range of about 0.4 to 2.0 \u03bcm. Some of this electromagnetic\nenergyisabsorbedandconvertedtothermalenergy,whichheatstheatmosphereandsurface.Theplanetcools\nitselfoftheabsorbedsolarradiationinvariousways,butultimatelythatenergyisdissipatedbyanemissionof\nelectromagnetic energy to outer space as longer-wave infrared radiation (of a spectral quality that peaks at a\nwavelengthof10\u03bcm).Inthiscase,relativelyshort-wavelengthsolarradiationisultimatelytransformedintothe\nlonger-wavelengthradiationemittedbyEarth,aprocessthatrepresentsadegradationinqualityoftheenergy\nand an increase in the entropy of the universe.\nAn important corollary (or secondary proposition) of the second law of thermodynamics is that energy\ntransformations can never be completely efficient\u2014some of the initial content of energy must always be\nconverted to heat so that entropy increases. This helps to explain why, even when using the best available\ntechnology, only about 30% of the potential energy of gasoline can be converted into the kinetic energy of\na moving automobile, and no more than about 40% of the energy of coal or natural gas can be transformed\nintoelectricityinageneratingstation.Therearealsothermodynamiclimitstotheefficiencyofphotosynthesis,\nthe process by which plants convert visible radiation into biochemical, even when it is occurring under ideal\nconditions with optimal supplies of nutrients, water, and light.\nA superficial assessment might suggest that life in general appears to contradict the second law of\nthermodynamics.Plants,forexample,absorbvisiblewavelengthsofelectromagneticradiationandusethishighly\ndispersedformofenergytofixsimpleinorganicmolecules(carbondioxideandwater)intoextremelycomplex\nand energy-dense biochemicals. The plant biomass may then be consumed by animals and microbes, which\nsynthesize their own complex biochemicals. These various bio-syntheses represent energy transformations\nthat greatly decrease local entropy because relatively dispersed electromagnetic energy and simple inorganic\ncompoundsarebeingconvertedintothecomplex,highlyorderedbiochemicalsoforganisms.Dothesebiological\ntransformations contravene the second law of thermodynamics?\nThis seeming paradox of life can be resolved using the following logic: the localized bio-concentration of\nnegativeentropycanonlyoccurbecausethesystem(ultimatelyreferringtothebiosphere,oralllifeonEarth)\nreceivesaconstantinputofenergyintheformofsolarradiation.Ifthisexternalsourceofenergyweresomehow\nterminated,alloftheorganismsandorganicmaterialswouldspontaneouslydegrade,releasingsimpleinorganic\nmoleculesandheatandtherebyincreasingtheentropyoftheuniverse.Therefore,lifeandecosystems cannot\nsurvive without continual inputs of solar energy, which are required to organize and maintain their negative\nentropy. In this sense, the biosphere can be viewed as representing an \u201cisland\u201d of negative entropy, highly\nlocalized in space and time, and continuously fuelled by the Sun as an external source of energy.\nEarth: An Energy Flow-Through System\nElectromagneticradiationemittedbytheSunisbyfarthemajorinputofenergythatdrivesecosystems.Solar\nenergyheatstheplanet,circulates itsatmosphereandoceans, evaporates itswater,andsustains almost all its\necologicalproductivity.Eventually,allofthesolarenergyabsorbedbyEarthisre-radiatedbacktospaceinthe\nform of electromagnetic radiation of a longer wavelength than what was originally captured. In other words,\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 73 Earth is a flow-through system, with a perfect balance between the input of solar energy and output of re-\nradiated energy, and no net storage over the longer term.\nIn addition, almost all ecosystems absolutely depend on solar radiation as the source of energy that\nphotosynthetic organisms (such as plants and algae) utilize to synthesize simple organic compounds (such as\nsugars)from inorganic molecules (carbon dioxide and water).Plants and algae then use the chemical potential\nenergyinthesesugars,plusinorganicnutrients(suchasnitrateandphosphate),tosynthesizeahugediversity\nof biochemicals through various metabolic reactions. Plants grow and reproduce by using these biochemicals\nand their potential energy. Moreover, plant biomass is used as food by the enormous numbers of organisms\nthatareincapableofphotosynthesis.Theseorganismsincludeherbivoresthateatplantsdirectly,carnivoresthat\neatotheranimals,anddetritivoresthatfeedondeadbiomass.(Theenergyrelationshipswithinecosystemsare\ndescribed later.)\nLess than 0.02% of the solar energy received at Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed and fixed by photosynthetic\nplants and algae. Although this represents a quantitatively trivial component of the planet\u2019s energy budget, it\nis extremely important qualitatively because this biologically absorbed and fixed energy is the foundation of\necologicalproductivity.Ultimatelyandeventually,however,thesolarenergyfixedbyplantsandalgaeisreleased\ntotheenvironmentagainasheatandiseventuallyradiatedbacktoouterspace.ThisreinforcestheideaofEarth\nbeing a flow-through system for energy, with a perfect baance between the input and output.\nEarth\u2019s Energy Budget\nAn energy budget of a system describes the rates of energy input and output as well as any internal\ntransformations among its various states, including changes in stored quantities. Figure 4.2 illustrates key\naspects of the physical energy budget of Earth.\nTherateofinputofsolarradiationtoEarthaveragesabout8.36J/cm2-minute(2.00cal/cm2-min),measured\nattheouterlimitoftheatmosphere.Abouthalfofthisenergyinputisvisibleradiationandhalfisnearinfrared.\nThe output of energy from Earth is also about 8.36 J/cm2-min, occurring as longer-wave infrared. Because\nthe rates of energy input and output are equal, there is no net storage of energy, and the average surface\ntemperatureoftheplanetremainsstable.Therefore,aswaspreviouslynoted,theenergybudgetofEarthcanbe\ncharacterized as a zero-sum, flow-through system.\nHowever,theaboveisnotexactlytrue.Overextremelylongscalesofgeologicaltime,asmallamountofstorage\nof solar energy has occurred through an accumulation of undecomposed biomass that eventually transformed\ninto fossil fuels. In addition, relatively minor long-term fluctuations in Earth\u2019s surface temperature occur,\nrepresentinganimportantelementofclimatechange.Nevertheless,thesearequantitativelytrivialexceptionsto\nthe statement that Earth is a zero-sum, flow-through system for solar energy.\nFigure 4.2. Important Components of Earth\u2019s Physical Energy Budget. About 30% of the incoming solar\nradiation is reflected by atmospheric clouds and particulates and by the surface of the planet. The\nremaining 70% is absorbed and then dissipated in various ways. Much of the absorbed energy heats\nthe atmosphere and terrestrial surfaces, and most is then re-radiated as long-wave infrared radiation.\nAtmospheric moisture and greenhouse gases interfere with this process of re-radiation, keeping the\nsurface considerably warmer than it would otherwise be (see also Chapter 17). The numbers refer to\nthe percentage of incoming solar radiation. See the text for a more detailed description of important\n74 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems factors in this energy budget. Source: Modified from Schneider (1989).\nEven though the amount of energy emitted by Earth eventually equals the quantity of solar radiation that is\nabsorbed, many ecologically important transformations occur between the initial absorption and eventual re-\nradiation.Thesearetheinternalelementsofthephysicalenergybudgetoftheplanet(seeFigure4.2).Themost\nimportant components are described below:\nReflection \u2013On average, Earth\u2019s atmosphere and surface reflect about 30% of incoming solar energy back\nto outer space. Earth\u2019s reflectivity (albedo) is influenced by such factors as the angle of the incoming solar\nradiation(whichvariesduringthedayandovertheyear),theamountsofreflectivecloudcoverandatmospheric\nparticulates (also highly variable), and the character of the surface, especially the types and amounts of water\n(including snow and ice) and darker vegetation.\nAbsorption by the Atmosphere \u2013About 25% of incident solar radiation is absorbed by gases, vapours, and\nparticulatesintheatmosphere,includingclouds.Therateofabsorptioniswavelength-specific,withportionsof\ntheinfraredrangebeingintensivelyabsorbedbytheso-called\u201cgreenhouse\u201dgases(especiallywatervapourand\ncarbondioxide;seeChapter17).Theabsorbedenergyisconvertedtoheatandre-radiatedasinfraredradiation\nof a longer wavelength than what has been initialy absorbed.\nAbsorption by the Surface \u2013On average, about 45% of incoming solar radiation passes through the\natmosphere and is absorbed at Earth\u2019s by living and non-living materials at the surface, a trabsformation that\nincreases their temperature. However, this figure of 45% is highly variable, depending partly on atmospheric\nconditions, especially cloud cover, and also on whether the incident light has passed through a plant canopy.\nAlthough over the longer term (years) and even the medium term (days) the global net storage of heat is\nessentiallyzero,insomeplacestheremaybesubstantialchangesinthenetstorageofthermalenergywithinthe\nyear.ThisoccurseverywhereinCanadabecauseoftheseasonalityofitsclimate,inthatenvironmentsaremuch\nwarmer during the summer than in the winter. Nevertheless, almost all of the absorbed energy is eventually\ndissipated by re-radiation from the surface as long-wave infrared.\nEvaporationofWater\u2013Someofthethermalenergyoflivingandnon-livingsurfacescauseswatertoevaporate\nin a process known as evapotranspiration. This process has two components: the evaporation of water from\nlakes, rivers, streams, moist rocks, soil, and other non-living substrates, and transpiration of water from any\nliving surface, particularly from plant foliage, but also from moist body surfaces and lungs of animals.\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 75 Melting of Snow and Ice \u2013Absorbed thermal energy can also cause ice and snow to melt, representing an\nenergy transformation associated with a change of state of water from a solid to a liquid form.\nWindandWaterCurrents\u2013Thereisahighlyunevendistributionofthecontentofthermalenergyatandnear\nthe surface of Earth, with some regions being quite cold (such as the Arctic) and others much warmer warm\n(thetropics).Becauseofthisirregularallocationofheat,thesurfacedevelopsprocessestodiminishtheenergy\ngradients by transporting mass around the globe, such as by winds and oceanic currents (see also Chapter 3).\nBiological Fixation \u2013A very small but ecologically critical portion of incoming solar radiation (globally\naveraginglessthan0.02%)isabsorbedbychlorophyllinplantsandalgaeandusedtodrivephotosynthesis.This\nbiologicalfixationallowssomeofthesolarenergytobetemporarilystoredaspotentialenergyinbiochemicals,\nthereby serving as the energetic basis for ecological productivity and life on Earth.\nEnergy in Ecosystems\nAnecologicalenergybudgetfocusesontheabsorptionofenergybyphotosyntheticorganismsandthetransfer\nofthatfixedenergythroughthetrophiclevelsofecosystems(\u201ctrophic\u201dreferstothemeansoforganicnutrition).\nEcologists classify organisms in terms of the sources of energy they utilize.\nAutotrophs are capable of synthesizing their complex biochemicals using simple inorganic compounds and\nanexternalsourceofenergytodrivetheprocess.Thegreatmajorityarephotoautotrophs,whichusesunlight\nastheirexternalsourceofenergy.Photoautotrophscapturesolarradiationusingphotosyntheticpigments,the\nmostimportantofwhichischlorophyll.Greenplantsarethemostabundantexamplesofphotoautotrophs,but\nalgae and some bacteria are also photoautotrophic.\nA much smaller number of autotrophs are chemoautotrophs, which harness some of the energy content of\ncertaininorganicchemicalstodriveaprocesscalledchemosynthesis.ThebacteriumThiobacillus thiooxidans,\nforexample,oxidizessulphidemineralstosulphateandusessomeoftheenergyliberatedduringthisreaction\nto chemosynthesize organic molecules.\nBecause autotrophs are the biological foundation of ecological productivity, ecologists refer to them as\nprimary producers. The total fixation of solar energy by all of the primary producers within an ecosystem\nis known as gross primary production (GPP). Primary producers use some of this production for their own\nrespiration(R)\u2013thatis,forthephysiologicalfunctionsneededtomaintaintheirhealthandtogrow.Respiration\nisthemetabolic oxidation ofbiochemicals, anditrequiresasupplyofoxygenandreleases carbondioxide and\nwateraswasteproducts.Netprimaryproduction(NPP)referstothefractionofGPPthatremainsafterprimary\nproducers have used some for their own respiration.

For example,\nstudies of a natural oak\u2013pine forest found that the total fixation of solar energy by the vegetation (the annual\ngrossprimaryproduction)wasequivalentto4.81\u00d7104kJ/m2-y(48100kJ/m2-y)(Odum,1993).Thisfixationrate\nwasequivalenttolessthan0.1%oftheannualinputofsolarradiation.Becausetheplantsused2.72\u00d7104kJ/m2-y\nduringtheirrespiration,thenetprimaryproductivitywas2.09\u00d7104kJ/m2-y,representedmainlybythegrowing\nbiomassofthetrees.Thevariousheterotrophicorganismsintheforestused1.26\u00d7104kJ/m2-ytosupporttheir\nrespiration.Ultimately,thenetaccumulationofbiomassbyallorganismsintheecosystem(referredtoasthenet\necosystem productivity) was equivalent to 0.83 \u00d7 104 kJ/m2-y, or 8.3 \u00d7 103 kJ/m2-y.\nThe primary productivities of the world\u2019s major classes of ecosystems are summarized in Table 4.1. Note\nthat the rate of production is greatest in tropical forests, wetlands, coral reefs, and estuaries. The production\nfor each ecosystem type is calculated as its productivity multiplied by its area. However, the largest amounts\nof production occur in tropical forests and the open ocean. Note that the open ocean has a relatively small\nproductivity, but its global production is large because of its enormous area.\nTable 4.1. Primary Production of Earth\u2019s Major Ecosystems. The ecosystems are listed in order of net\nprimary productivity. Productivity is the rate of production, standardized to area and time, while\nproductionisthetotalamountofbiomass(indrytonnes)producedbytheglobalareaofanecosystem.\nSee Chapter 8 for descriptions of these biomes (major kinds of ecosystems).

Food webs are complex systems, involving\n78 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems many species and various food chains.\nInaccordancewiththesecondlawofthermodynamics,thetransferofenergyinfoodwebsisalwaysinefficient\nbecause some of the fixed energy must be converted into heat. For example, when a herbivore consumes\nplant biomass, only some of the energy content can be assimilated and transformed into its biomass. The\nrest is excreted in feces or utilized in respiration (Figure 4.4). Consequently, in all ecosystems the amount of\nproductivitybyautotrophsisalwaysmuchgreaterthanthatofherbivores,whichinturnisalwaysmuchgreater\nthanthatoftheirpredators.Asabroadgeneralization,thereisabouta90%lossofenergyateachtransferstage.\nInotherwords,theproductivityofherbivoresisonlyabout10%ofthatoftheirplantfood,andtheproductivity\nof the first carnivore level is only 10% of that of the herbivores they feed upon.\nFigure4.4.ModelofEnergyTransferinanEcosystem.Lowerlevelsofafoodwebalwayshaveagreater\nproductionthanhigherlevels.Forthisreason,thetrophicstructureisroughlypyramidal.Accordingto\nthesecondlawofthermodynamics,someoftheenergycontentinfoodwebsisconvertedintoheator\nrespiration (R).

The second law does not, however, directly explain the accumulated biomass of an ecosystem.\nConsequently,itisonlythetrophicstructureofproductivitythatisalwayspyramid-shaped.Insomeecosystems,\n80 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems other variables mayhaveapyramid-shapedtrophic structure, such astheamountsofbiomass (standing crop)\npresent at specific times, or the sizes or densities of populations.

To sustain a viable population of top predators, there must be a suitably large production of prey\nthattheseanimalscanexploit.Thispreymustinturnbesustainedbyanappropriatelyhighplantproductivity.\nBecause of these ecological constraints, only extremely productive or very extensive ecosystems can support\ntoppredators.OfallEarth\u2019sterrestrialecosystems,nonesupportsmorespeciesofhigher-ordercarnivoresthan\nthe savannahs and grasslands of Africa.

Vegetarianism and Energy Efficiency\nMostpeoplehaveanomnivorousdiet,meaningtheyeatawidevarietyoffoodsofbothplantandanimal\norigin. Vegetarians, however, do not eat meat or other foods produced by killing birds, fish, mammals,\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 81 or other animals. Some vegetarians, known as vegans, do not eat any foods of animal origin, including\ncheese, eggs, honey, or milk. People may choose to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle for various reasons,\nincludingthosethatfocusontheethicsoftherearingandslaughterofanimalsandthehealthbenefits\nof a balanced diet that does not include animal products. In addition, there are large environmental\nbenefitsofvegetarianism.Theyareduestoavoidingcertainair,water,andsoilpollutants,andreducing\nthe conversion of natural habitat into agroecosystems used for livestock rearing. In addition, it takes\nmuch less energy to feed a population of vegetarian humans than omnivorous ones.\nCultivated animals eat a great deal of food. In the industrial agriculture practised in developed\ncountries,includingCanada,livestockareraisedmostlyonadietofplantproducts,includingcultivated\ngrain.Somevegetariansarguethatifthatgrainwerefeddirectlytopeople,thetotalamountsofcereals\nand agricultural land needed to support the human population would be much less. This argument is\nbasedontheinefficiencyofenergytransferbetweentrophiclevels,whichweexaminedinthischapter\nin a more ecological context. This energy-efficiency argument is most compelling for animals that are\nfedongrainandotherconcentratedfoods.Itislessrelevanttolivestockthatspendallorpartoftheir\nlifegrazingonwildrangeland\u2013inthatecologicalcontext,ruminantanimalssuchascowsandsheepare\neatingplantbiomassthathumanscouldnotdirectlyconsumeandsotheyareproducingfoodthatwould\nnot otherwise be available.\nSimilarly,manychickens,pigs,andotherlivestockarefedfoodwastes(forexample,fromrestaurants)\nand processing by-products (such as vegetable and fruit culls and peelings, and grain mash from\nbreweries)thatarenotsuitableforhumanconsumption.Ithasbeenestimatedthatabout25%ofglobal\ncropland is being used to grow grain and other foods for livestock, and that 37% of the world\u2019s cereal\nproductionisfedtoagriculturalanimals.InNorthAmerica,however,about70%ofthegrainproduction\nisfedtolivestock.Andthereareimmensenumbersofagriculturalanimals:globally,therearemorethan\n3billioncows,goats,andsheep,andatleast20billionchickens.Thecowsaloneeattheequivalentofthe\ncaloric needs of 8\u20139 billion people.\nAssimilation efficiency is a measure of the percentage of the energy content of an ingested food\nthat is absorbed by the gut and therefore available to support the metabolic needs of an animal. This\nefficiencyvariesamonggroupsofanimalsandalsodependsonthetypeoffoodbeingeaten.Herbivorous\nanimalstypicallyhaveanassimilationefficiencyof20\u201350%,withthesmallerratebeingfortough,fibrous,\npoor-quality foods such as grass and straw, and the larger one for higher-quality foods such as grain.\nCarnivoreshaveahigherassimilationefficiency,around80%,becausetheirfoodissodenseinprotein\nand fat. Overall, it takes about 16 kg of feed to produce 1 kg of beef in a feedlot. The ratios for other\nlivestockare6:1forpork,3:1forchicken,and2:1to3:1forfarmedfish.Theseassimilationinefficiencies\nwould be avoided if people directly ate the grain consumed by livestock.\nEcological energetics is not the only consideration in the energy efficiency of vegetarianism. Huge\namountsofenergyarealsousedtoconvertnaturalecosystems intofarmland, tocultivateandmanage\nthe agroecosystems, to transport commodities, to process and package foods, and to transport, treat,\nor dispose of waste materials. These energy expenditures would also be substantially reduced if more\npeople had a vegetarian diet and lifestyle. Clearly, vegetarians have a smaller \u201cecological footprint\u201d\nassociated with their feeding habits (see Table 25.1 in Chapter 25).\n82 | Chapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems Conclusions\nEnergy can exist in various states, but transformations from one to another must obey the laws of\nthermodynamics. Organisms and ecosystems would spontaneously degrade if they did not have continuous\naccess to external sources of energy. Ultimately, sunlight is the key source of energy that supports almost all\nlife and ecosystems. Sunlight is used by photoautotrophs to combine carbon dioxide and water into simple\norganicmoleculesthroughthemetabolicprocessofphotosynthesis.Thefixedenergyofplantbiomasssupports\necologicalfoodwebs.Plantsmaybeeatenbyherbivoresandtheenergyobtainedisusedtosupporttheirown\ngrowth.Herbivoresmaythenbeeatenbycarnivores.Deadbiomasssupportsadecomposerfoodweb.Sunlight\nalso drives important planetary functions, such as the hydrologic and climatic systems. Human activities can\nhave a large and degrading influence on food webs, and even on Earth\u2019s climatic system by influencing the\nintensity of the planet\u2019s greenhouse effect.\nQuestions for Review\n1. What forms of energy are described in this chapter? How can each be changed into other forms?\n2. What are the first and second laws of thermodynamics? How do they govern transformations of energy?\n3. What are the major elements of Earth\u2019s physical energy budget?\n4. Why is the trophic structure of ecological productivity pyramid-shaped?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. According to the second law of thermodynamics, systems always spontaneously move toward a condition\nof greater entropy. Yet life and ecosystems on Earth represent local systems where negative entropy is\ncontinuously being generated. What conditions allow this apparent paradox to exist?\n2. Why are there no natural higher-order predators that kill and eat lions, wolves, and sharks?\n3. Why would it be more efficient for people to be vegetarian? Discuss your answer in view of the pyramid-\nshaped structure of ecological productivity.\n4. Make a list of the key sources and transformations of energy that support you and your activities on a\ntypical day. What is the ultimate source of each of the energy resources you use (such as sunlight and fossil\nfuels)?\nExploring Issues\n1. As part of a study of the cycling of pollutants, you have been asked to describe the food web of two local\necosystems. One of the ecosystems is a natural forest (or prairie) and the other is an area used to grow\nwheat (or another crop). How would you determine the major components of the food webs of these\nChapter 4 ~ Energy and Ecosystems | 83 ecosystems, the species occurring in their trophic levels, and the interactions among the various species\nthat are present?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nBotkin, D.B. and E.A.

Explain what nutrients are and give examples.\n2. Discuss the concept of nutrient cycling and describe important compartments and fluxes.\n3. Describe factors that affect the development of major soil types.\n4. Describe the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur.\nNutrients\nNutrients are any chemicals that are needed for the proper functioning of organisms. We can distinguish two\nbasic types of nutrients: (1) inorganic chemicals that autotrophic organisms require for photosynthesis and\nmetabolism, and (2) organic compounds ingested as food by heterotrophic organisms. This chapter deals with\nthe inorganic nutrients.\nPlantsabsorbawiderangeofinorganicnutrientsfromtheirenvironment,typicallyassimplecompounds.For\nexample,mostplantsobtaintheircarbonasgaseouscarbondioxide(CO2)fromtheatmosphere,theirnitrogen\nastheions(chargedmolecules)nitrate(NO3\u2013)orammonium(NH4+),theirphosphorusasphosphate(PO43\u2013),and\ntheircalciumandmagnesiumassimpleions(Ca2+andMg2+).Theionsareobtainedindissolvedforminsoilwater\nabsorbedbyplantroots.Plantsutilizethesevariousnutrientsinphotosynthesisandothermetabolicprocesses\nto manufacture all of the biochemicals they need for growth and reproduction.\nSome inorganic nutrients, referred to as macronutrients, are needed by plants in relatively large quantities.\nThese are carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulphur.\nCarbon and oxygen are required in the largest amounts because carbon typically comprises about 50% of the\ndryweightofplantbiomassandoxygensomewhatless.Hydrogenaccountsforabout6%ofdryplantbiomass,\nwhile nitrogen and potassium occur in concentrations of 1-2% and those of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,\nandsulphurare0.1-0.5%.Micronutrientsareneededinmuchsmalleramounts,andtheyincludeboron,chlorine,\ncopper,iron,manganese,molybdenum,andzinc.Eachoftheseaccountsforlessthan0.01%ofplantbiomassand\nas little as a few parts per million (ppm, or 10\u20136; 1 ppm is equivalent to 0.0001%; see Appendix A).\nImage5.1.Theproductivityofanaturalecosystemisoftenlimitedbythesupplyofnutrients.Thiscanbe\ninvestigatedbyexperimentallyaddingfertilizertothesystem.Inthiscase,nitrogenfertilizerwasadded\ntoameadowinArctictundraonEllesmereIsland,resultinginincreasedproductivity.Theexperimental\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 85 plot is a slightly darker colour.

As a consequence of this fact, nutrients and other materials \u201ccycle\u201d within and between\necosystems. In contrast, energy always \u201cflows through\u201d ecosystems and the biosphere (Chapter 4). Nutrient\ncycling refers to the transfers, chemical transformations, and recycling of nutrients in ecosystems. A nutrient\nbudgetisaquantitative(numerical)estimateoftheratesofnutrientinputandoutputtoandfromanecosystem,\nas well as the amounts present and transferred within the system.\nThemajorelementsofanutrientcycleareshowninFigure5.1.Theouterboundaryofthediagramdefinesthe\nlimitsofanecosystem.(Itcouldevenrepresenttheentirebiosphere,inwhichcasetherewouldbenoinputsto\noroutputsfromthesystem.)Inecologicalstudies,thesystemisoftendefinedasaparticularlandscape,lake,or\nwatershed(aterrestrialbasinfromwhichwaterdrainsintoastreamorlake).Eachofthesesystemshasinputs\nand outputs of nutrients, the rates of which can be measured.\n86 | Chapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients The boxes within the boundary represent compartments, each of which stores a quantity of material.\nCompartment sizes are typically expressed in units of mass per unit of surface area. Examples of such units\nare kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) or tonnes per hectare (t/ha). In aquatic studies, compartment sizes may be\nexpressedperunitofwatervolume(suchasg/m3).Thearrowsinthediagramrepresentfluxes,ortransfersof\nmaterialbetweencompartments.Fluxesareratefunctions,andaremeasuredintermsofmassperareapertime\n(e.g., kg/ha-yr).\nThe system can be divided into four major compartments:\n1. The atmosphereconsists of gases and small concentrations of suspended particulates and water vapour.\n2. Rocks and soilconsist of insoluble minerals that are not directly available for uptake by organisms.\n3. Available nutrientsare present in chemical forms that are water soluble to some degree, so they can be\nabsorbed by organisms from their environment and contribute to their mineral nutrition.\n4. The organic compartmentconsists of nutrients present within living and dead organic matter. This\ncompartment can be divided into three functional groups: (a) living biomass of autotrophs such as plants,\nalgae, and autotrophic bacteria, (b) living heterotrophs including herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and\ndetritivores, and (c) and all forms of dead organic matter.\nThe major transfers of material between compartments, or fluxes, are also shown in Figure 5.1. These are\nimportanttransferpathwayswithinnutrientcycles.Forinstance,insolubleformsofnutrientsinrocksandsoil\nbecome available for uptake by organisms through various chemical transformations, such as weathering, that\nrender the nutrients soluble in water. This is reversed by reactions that produce insoluble compounds from\nsoluble ones. These latter reactions form secondary minerals such as carbonates (e.g. limestone, CaCO3, and\ndolomite, MgCO3), oxides of iron and aluminum (Fe2O3and Al(OH)3), sulphides (e.g., iron sulphide, FeS2), and\nother compounds that are not directly available for biological uptake.\nFigure5.1.ConceptualDiagramofaNutrientCycle.Thisdiagramshowsthemajorelementsofanutrient\ncycleforaparticularecosystem,suchasawatershed.Eachboxrepresentsacompartment(atmosphere,\nsoilandrocks,organicmaterial,andavailablenutrients)thatcontainsaquantityofmaterial.Thearrows\nrepresent fluxes, or transfers of material between compartments. Source: Modified from Likens et\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 87 al. (1977).\nOther fluxes in nutrient cycles include the biological uptake of nutrients from the atmosphere or from the\navailable pool in soil. For example, plant foliage assimilates carbon dioxide (CO2) from air, and roots absorb\nnitrate(NO3\u2013)andammonium(NH4+)ionsdissolvedinsoilwater.Plantsthenmetabolicallyfixthesenutrients\ninto their growing biomass. The organic nutrients may then enter the food web and are eventually deposited\nas dead biomass.

In addition, inputs of litter (dead biomass) from plants increase the content of organic matter in\nsoil. Fresh litter is a food substrate for many decomposer species of soil-dwelling animals, fungi, and bacteria.\nThese organisms eventually oxidize the organic debris into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic nutrients\nsuch as ammonium, although some material remaining as complex organic matter, known as humus. As soils\ndevelop, they assume a vertical stratification known as a soil profile, which has recognizable layers known\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 89 as horizons.

Because anaerobic decomposition is relatively inefficient, dead organic matter often accumulates in\nwetlands such as swamps and bogs, eventually forming peat. Under suitable geological conditions of deep\nburial, high pressure and temperature, and a lack of oxygen, peat and other organic materials may be slowly\ntransformed into carbon-rich fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas (see Chapter 13).\nAtmosphericCO2alsodissolvesintooceanicwater,formingthebicarbonateion(HCO3\u2013),whichcanbetaken\nupandfixedbyphotosyntheticalgaeandbacteria,whicharethebaseofthemarinefoodweb.Variousmarine\norganisms also use oceanic CO2and HCO3\u2013 to manufacture their shells of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), an\ninsoluble mineral that slowly accumulates in sediment and may eventually lithify into limestone (also CaCO3).\nOver almost all of geological time, the amount of CO2absorbed by the global biota from the atmosphere\nwas similar to that released through respiration and decomposition. Consequently, the cycling of this nutrient\ncanbeviewedasasteady-statesystem.Inmoderntimes,however,anthropogenicemissionshavechangedthe\natmospheric carbon balance.

Like the carbon cycle, that of nitrogen has an important\natmospheric phase. However, unlike carbon, nitrogen is not a significant constituent of rocks and minerals.\nConsequently, the atmospheric reservoir plays a paramount role in the cycling of nitrogen (Figure 5.4).\nFigure 5.4. Model of the Global Nitrogen Cycle. Nitrogen occurs in three main compartments: the\natmosphere,terrestrialorganicmaterial,andoceanicorganicmaterial.Theamountsofnitrogenstored\nincompartmentsareexpressedinunitsofmillionsoftonnesofnitrogen(106tormegatonnes,Mt),while\nfluxes are in 106t/y. Based on data from Hutzinger (1982) and Freedman (1995).\nVirtually all nitrogen in the atmosphere occurs in the form of nitrogen gas (N2, sometimes referred to as\ndinitrogen), which is present in a concentration of 78%. Other gaseous forms of nitrogen are ammonia (NH3),\nnitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These trace gases typically occur in\natmospheric concentrations much less than 1 ppm, although there may be larger amounts close to sources of\nanthropogenic emissions (see Chapter 16). Nitrogen also occurs in trace particulates containing nitrate (NO3\u2013)\nand ammonium (NH4+), such as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4), both of\nwhich can be significant pollutants related to acid rain and haze (see Chapters 16 and 19).\nNitrogen occurs in many additional forms in terrestrial and aquatic environments. \u201cOrganic nitrogen\u201d refers\nto the great variety of nitrogen-containing molecules in living and dead biomass. These chemicals range in\n94 | Chapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients character from simple amino acids, through proteins and nucleic acids, to large and complex molecules that\narecomponentsofhumifiedorganicmatter.Nitrogeninecosystemsalsooccursinasmallnumberofinorganic\ncompounds, the most important of which are N2and NH3gases and the ions nitrate, nitrite (NO2\u2013), and\nammonium. The nitrogen cycle involves the transformation and cycling of the various organic and inorganic\nforms of nitrogen within ecosystems.\nNitrogen Fixation\nBecause the two nitrogen atoms in dinitrogen gas are held together by a strong triple bond, N2is a highly\nunreactivecompound.ForthisreasonN2canbedirectlyusedbyonlyafewspecializedorganisms,eventhough\nit is extremely abundant in the environment. These nitrogen-fixing species, all of which are microorganisms,\nhave the ability to metabolize N2into NH3gas, which can then be used for their nutrition. More importantly,\nthe NH3also becomes indirectly available to the great majority of autotrophic plants and microorganisms that\ncannot fix N2themselves.\nBiologicalnitrogenfixationisacriticalprocess\u2013mostecosystemsdependonittoprovidethenitrogenthat\nsustains their primary productivity. In fact, because nitrogen is not an important constituent of rocks and soil\nminerals,N2fixationisultimatelyresponsibleforalmostalloftheorganicnitrogeninthebiomassoforganisms\nandecosystemsthroughoutthebiosphere.Theonlyothersignificantsourcesoffixednitrogenforecosystems\naretheatmosphericdepositionofnitrateandammoniuminprecipitationanddustfall,andtheuptakeofNOand\nNO2gases by plants. However, these are generally minor sources in comparison with biological N2fixation.\nThe best known of the N2-fixing microorganisms are bacteria called Rhizobium, which live in specialized\nnodulesontherootsofleguminousplants,suchaspeasandbeans.Somenon-legumes,suchasalders,alsolive\ninabeneficialsymbiosis(amutualism;seeChapter9)withN2-fixingmicroorganisms.Sodomostlichens,which\nare a mutualism between a fungus and an alga. Many other N2-fixing microbes are free-living in soil or water,\nsuch as cyanobacteria (blue-green bacteria).\nNon-biological nitrogen fixation also occurs, for instance during a lightning event when atmospheric\nN2combines with O2under conditions of great heat and pressure. Humans can also cause N2to be fixed. For\nexample, nitrogen fertilizer is manufactured by combining N2with hydrogen gas (H2, which is manufactured\nfrom CH4, a fossil fuel) in the presence of iron catalysts to produce NH3. In addition, NO gas is formed in\nthe internal combustion engines of vehicles, where N2combines with O2under conditions of high pressure\nand temperature. Large amounts of NO are emitted to the atmosphere in vehicle exhaust, contributing to air\npollution(Chapter16).AnthropogenicN2fixationnowamountstoabout120milliontonnesperyear,about83%\nofwhichisthemanufacturingoffertilizer.Thisisagloballyimportantcomponentofthemodernnitrogencycle\nand is comparable in magnitude with non-human N2fixation (about 170 million tonnes per year).\nImage 5.3. Most species in the pea family (Fabaceae), such as these soybeans, develop a mutualism\nwith Rhizobium bacteria. The Rhizobium live in nodules on the roots and fix nitrogen gas (N2) into\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 95 ammonia (NH3), which the plant can use as a nutrient. Source: D. Patriquin\nAmmonification and Nitrification\nAfter an organism dies, its organically bound nitrogen must be converted to inorganic forms; otherwise, the\nrecycling of its fixed nitrogen would not be possible (Figure 5.5). The initial stage of this process is\nammonification, in which the organic nitrogen of dead biomass is transformed to ammonia, which acquires\na hydrogen ion (H+) to form ammonium (NH4+). As such, ammonification is a component of the complex\nprocess of decay, but one that is specific to the nitrogen cycle. Ammonification is carried out by a variety\nof microorganisms. The resulting ammonium is a suitable source of nutrition for many species of plants,\nparticularlythosethatliveinenvironmentswithacidicsoil.Mostplants,however,cannotutilizeNH4+effectively,\nand they require nitrate (NO3\u2013) as their main source of nitrogen nutrition.\nNitrificationistheprocessbywhichnitrateissynthesizedfromammonium.Theinitialstepistheconversion\nofNH4+tonitrite(NO2\u2013),afunctioncarriedoutbybacteriaknownasNitrosomonas.Oncethenitriteisformed,\nitisrapidlyoxidizedtonitratebyNitrobacterbacteria.BecauseNitrosomonasandNitrobacteraresensitiveto\nacidity,nitrificationdoesnotoccurinacidicsoilorwater.Thisiswhyplantsgrowinginacidichabitatsmustbe\nable to use ammonium as their source of nitrogen.\nFigure 5.5. Important Transformations of Fixed Nitrogen in Ecosystems. The diagram indicates the key\ntransformations of nitrogen among its most important inorganic forms in soil and aquatic ecosystems.\n96 | Chapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients Source: Modified from Freedman (1995).\nDenitrification\nIn denitrification, also performed by a wide variety of microbial species, nitrate is converted to either of the\ngasesN2OorN2,whicharereleasedtotheatmosphere.Denitrificationoccursunderanaerobicconditions,and\nits rate is greatest when there is a large concentration of nitrate, for example in fertilized agricultural land\nthatistemporarilyflooded.Insomerespects,denitrificationcanbeconsideredacounter-balancingprocessto\nnitrogenfixation.Infact,globalratesofnitrogenfixationanddenitrificationareinaroughbalance,sothetotal\namount of fixed nitrogen in the biosphere is not changing much over time.\nThe Phosphorus Cycle\nPhosphorus is a key constituent of many biochemicals, including fats and lipids, nucleic acids such as the\ngeneticmaterialsDNAandRNA,andenergy-carryingmoleculessuchasATP.However,phosphorusisrequired\nby organisms in much smaller quantities than nitrogen or carbon. Nevertheless, phosphorus is often in short\nsupply and so it is a critical nutrient in many ecosystems, particularly in freshwater and agriculture.\nIn contrast to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, that of phosphorus does not have a significant atmospheric\nphase. Although phosphorus compounds do occur in the atmosphere, as trace quantities in particulates, the\nresulting inputs to ecosystems are small compared with the amounts available from soil minerals or from the\nadditionoffertilizertoagriculturalland.Phosphorustendstomovefromtheterrestriallandscapeintosurface\nwatersandtheneventuallytotheoceans,whereitdepositstosedimentthatactsasalong-termsink.Although\nsomephosphorusmineralsinoceanicsedimentareeventuallyrecycledtothelandbygeologicalupliftassociated\nwith mountain building, this is an extremely slow process and is not meaningful in ecological time scales.\nTherefore, aspects of the global phosphorus cycle represent a flow-through system.\nNevertheless,certainprocessesdoreturnsomemarinephosphorustoportionsofthecontinentallandscape.\nFor example, some kinds of fish spend most of their life at sea but migrate up rivers to breed. When they are\nabundant, fish such as salmon import substantial quantities of organic phosphorus to the higher reaches of\nrivers,whereitisdecomposedtophosphateafterthefishspawnanddie.Fish-eatingmarinebirdsarealsolocally\nimportant in returning oceanic phosphorus to land through their excrement.\nSoil is the principal source of phosphorus uptake for terrestrial vegetation. The phosphate ion (PO43\u2013) is\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 97 the most important form of plant-available phosphorus. Although phosphate ions typically occur in small\nconcentrations in soil, they are constantly produced from slowly dissolving minerals such as calcium,\nmagnesium,andironphosphates(Ca3(PO4)2,Mg3(PO4)2,andFePO4).Phosphateisalsoproducedbythemicrobial\noxidationoforganicphosphorus,acomponentofthemoregeneralprocessofdecay.Water-solublephosphate\nis quickly absorbed by microorganisms and by plant roots and used in the synthesis of a wide range of\nbiochemicals.\nAquatic autotrophs also use phosphate as their principal source of phosphorus nutrition.

For some time, the major source of phosphorus\nfertilizers was guano, the dried excrement of marine birds.

Too Much of a Good Thing \u2013 Pollution by Nutrients\nNutrients are essential to the healthy metabolism of organisms and to the proper functioning of\necosystems. Often, an increase in the supply of certain nutrients will enhance the productivity of wild\nandcultivatedplants\u2013thisistheprinciplebehindtheuseoffertilizerinagriculture.However,thereare\nalso cases in which an excessive supply of nutrients has caused important environmental problems.\nBecause the supply of available forms of nitrogen (particularly NO3\u2013 and NH4+) is often a limiting\nfactortoagriculturalproductivity,thesearegenerallythemostabundantnutrientsinfertilizer.However,\nthe use of agricultural fertilizer can result in concentrations of NO3\u2013 in drinking water that are high\nenough to be toxic to humans, especially to infants (see Chapter 24). We also know that plants can\ntake up gaseous NO and N2O from the atmosphere and use them as nutrients, along with NO3\u2013 and\nNH4+ from precipitation and soil water. Yet gaseous NO and N2O are air pollutants if they occur in\nhigh concentrations, especially in sunny environments where they are involved in the photochemical\nproduction of toxic ozone (see Chapter 16). Furthermore, large amounts of NO3\u2013 and NH4+ in rain and\nsnow may contribute to acid rain (see Chapter 19).\nThere are other examples of environmental problems caused by excessive nutrients. For instance,\nCO2isoneofthemostimportantplantnutrientsbecausecarboncomprisesabouthalfofplantbiomass.\nBut this critical nutrient occurs in a relatively small atmospheric concentration \u2013 only about 0.04%.\nHowever,theconcentrationofCO2intheatmospherehasincreasedbyabout45%duringthepasttwo\ncenturies anditcontinues toamplify.Thiswell-documentedchange iscontributing toglobal warming,\nan important environmental problem (see Chapter 17).\nEutrophication,oranexcessiveproductivityofwaterbodies,isanotherenvironmentalproblemrelated\nto an excessive supply of nutrients. It is most often caused by an excess of PO43\u2013, usually because of\nChapter 5 ~ Flows and Cycles of Nutrients | 99 sewagedumpingorrunofffromfertilizedagriculturalland(seeChapter20).Highlyeutrophiclakesare\ndegraded ecologically and may no longer be useful as a source of drinking water or for recreation.\nClearly, these examples show that there is a fine balance between chemicals serving as beneficial\nnutrients, or as damaging pollutants.\nThe Sulphur Cycle\nSulphur is a key constituent of certain amino acids, proteins, and other biochemicals. Sulphur is abundant in\nsome minerals and rocks and has a significant presence in soil, water, and the atmosphere.\nAtmosphericsulphuroccursinvariouscompounds,someofwhichareimportantairpollutants(seeChapter\n16).Sulphurdioxide(SO2),agas,isemittedbyvolcaniceruptionsandisalsoreleasedbycoal-firedpowerplants\nandmetalsmelters.SO2istoxictomanyplantsatconcentrationslowerthan1ppm.Insomeplaces,suchasthe\nSudbury area, important ecological damage has been caused by this gas (Chapter 16).\nIntheatmosphere,SO2becomesoxidizedtotheanion(negativelychargedion)sulphate(SO42\u2013),whichoccurs\nas tiny particulates or is dissolved in suspended droplets of moisture.

Dimethyl sulphide is\nanother reduced-sulphur gas that is produced in the oceans and emitted to the atmosphere. In oxygen-rich\nenvironments, such as the atmosphere, H2S is oxidized to sulphate, as is dimethyl sulphide, but more slowly.\nMostemissions ofSO2totheatmosphereareassociatedwithhumanactivities,butalmostallH2Semissions\nare natural. An important exception is the emission of H2S from sour-gas wells and processing facilities, for\nexample,inAlberta.Overall,theglobalemissionofallsulphur-containinggasesisequivalenttoabout251million\ntonnes of sulphur per year. About 41% of this emission is anthropogenic and the rest is natural (see Chapter 16).\nSulphur occurs in rocks and soils in a variety of mineral forms, the most important of which are sulphides,\nwhich occur as compounds with metals. Iron sulphides (such as FeS2, called pyrite when it occurs as cubic\ncrystals)arethemostcommonsulphideminerals,butalloftheheavymetals(suchascopper,lead,andnickel)\ncanexistinthismineralform.Wherevermetalsulphidesbecomeexposedtoanoxygen-richenvironment,the\nbacterium Thiobacillus thiooxidans oxidizes the mineral, generating sulphate as a product. This autotrophic\nbacterium uses energy from this chemical transformation to sustain its growth and reproduction. This kind of\nprimary productivity is called chemosynthesis (in parallel with the photosynthesis of plants). In places where\nlarge amounts of sulphide are oxidized, high levels of acidity are associated with the sulphate product, a\nphenomenon referred to as acid-mine drainage (see Chapter 19).\nSulphur also occurs in a variety of organically bound forms in soil and water.

If they are\ninsufficient in quantity, then ecological productivity is less than it potentially could be. Nutrients can also\nbe present in excess, in which case environmental damage may be caused by toxicity and other problems.\nNutrientsroutinelycycleamonginorganicandorganicformswithinecosystems.Keyaspectsofnutrientcycles\nare illustrated by the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur cycles.\nQuestions for Review\n1.

Discuss the differences between creationism and evolution as explanations of the origin of life and species.\n3. Describe the theory of evolution by natural selection.\n4. Explain the role of genetics in understanding evolution and biodiversity.\nIn the Beginning \u2026\nBased on geological and astronomical data, the Earth is believed to have originated by the condensation of\ninterstellar dust about 4.5 billion years ago. The pre-life environments of the planet were vastly different\nfromwhatexiststoday.Theinitialatmospherelikelyresultedfromvolcanicout-gassing anditschemistrywas\ndominated by hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other gases\nthat today exist only in trace concentrations. In contrast, the modern atmosphere has large concentrations of\noxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2).\nOnereasonforaprofoundchangeinatmosphericchemistrywastheevolutionofphotosyntheticorganisms,\nwhichreleaseO2asawasteproductoftheirautotrophicmetabolism.AstheconcentrationofO2increased,the\natmosphere changed from an environment that favoured reducing reactions (in which the reaction products\nhaveanetgaininelectrons)tooneinwhichoxidizingreactionswerepredominant.Hydrogensulphide,methane,\nand ammonia are all reduced compounds, but in an O2-rich atmosphere, they become oxidized to sulphate\n(SO42\u2013), carbon dioxide, and nitrate (NO3\u2013), respectively. In addition, O2can participate in photochemical\nreactions that produce small amounts of ozone (O3). When present in the upper atmosphere, ozone absorbs\nsolar ultraviolet radiation and thereby shields organisms from many of the damaging effects of this kind of\nelectromagnetic energy.\nThe genesis of life on Earth is thought to have occurred in a primordial aquatic environment at least 3.5\nbillion years ago. It is not known exactly how life first began from inanimate matter, although many biologists\nbelievethattheprocesswasaspontaneousoccurrence.Inotherwords,theoriginoflifehappenednaturally,asa\nconsequenceoftheexistenceofappropriateconditionsofchemistry,temperature,pressure,energy,andother\nenvironmental factors.\nAs such, the origin of life could have happened as a series of random events occurring under suitable\nconditions.Somebiologists,however,believethatgenesiscouldhavetakenplaceinamorepurposefulmanner,\nunder the influence of autocatalytic (self-catalyzed) reactions that favoured the synthesis and persistence of\nparticular organic chemicals. Under those selective influences, molecules and their interrelationships became\nincreasingly more complex and eventually developed the qualities that define the simplest forms of life:\nmetabolism, growth, and reproduction.\nThe appropriate environmental conditions for the genesis of life probably included the presence of many\nChapter 6 ~ Evolution | 103 simpleorganiccompoundsinprimordialwaters.Itisbelievedthatthesimpleorganiccompoundswerenaturally\nsynthesized by inorganic (i.e., non-living) reactions among the ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulphide, and\nother compounds that were abundant in the pre-life atmosphere. These reactions were favoured because the\natmosphere at that time was a high-energy environment associated with ultraviolet radiation and lightning\nstrikes. The resulting organic compounds were deposited into the primordial ocean by rainfall, where they\nbecameprogressivelyconcentrated,especiallyinshallowpoolsonoceanicshores,wheretherateofevaporation\nwould have been high.\nModern scientists have performed simple laboratory experiments that are thought to simulate those\nprimordial conditions. In airtight flasks, mixtures of water and gaseous CH4, NH3, and H2S are sparked by\nelectric arcs. These experiments yield various types of hydrocarbons, amino acids (precursors of proteins),\nnitrogenous bases (precursors of nucleic acids), and other organic chemicals. Scientists think that something\nsimilar happened prior to the origin of life on Earth.\nHowever, it is an enormous step from the occurrence of appropriate environmental conditions to the\nspontaneousgenesisoflivingmicroorganisms.Scientistsdonotyetunderstandhowthismomentousevent\u2014the\norigin of the first organisms\u2014occurred. In fact, the boundary between complex chemical systems and living\norganisms is somewhat arbitrary (for example, viruses exist at this boundary). Nevertheless, there is a broad\nconsensus among scientists that microorganisms did appear in the oceans about 3.5 billion years ago (Table\n6.1). Those first microorganisms were heterotrophic consumers of the rich soup of organic compounds that\nhad accumulated in pre-biological oceans over hundreds of millions of years. The first chemoautotrophic\nmicroorganismsevolvedseveralhundredmillionyearslater,andthefirstphotosyntheticonesabout2.5billion\nyears ago.\nTable 6.1.

Eventually, eukaryotes (which\nhave a nucleus bounded by a membrane) evolved from simpler prokaryotic predecessors.\nMorecomplexmicroorganisms,containingsubcellularorganellessuchasmitochondria,plastids,andcilia,are\nthought to have evolved as a result of symbiotic associations occurring among different species.

The evolution and radiation of these complex organisms was driven by physiological\nChapter 6 ~ Evolution | 105 and ecological adaptations associated with interactions of specialized cells and, eventually, organs.

Source: B. Freedman.\nIn Detail 6.1. A Primer on Genetics\nEvery organism has an individual complement of genetic information contained in the specific\narrangement of nucleotides in its DNA or RNA. The following is a brief outline of the storage and\ntranslation of genetic information.\nDNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) carries the genetic information in almost all species. In some viruses,\nhowever,thegeneticinformationiscontainedinRNA(seebelow).DNA,anucleicacid,consistsoflinear\nsequencesofonlyfournucleotides:adenine,cytosine,guanine,andthymine.Thesequencesarearranged\nas two strands, which coil as a double helix (spiral) and are held together by hydrogen bonds between\ncomplementarynucleotides:adeninewiththymine,andcytosinewithguanine.Thegeneticinformation\nis embedded in the precise sequence of the nucleotides.\nRNA(ribonucleicacid)iscomposedofasinglestrandofnucleotides.InRNA,uracilsubstitutesforthe\nthymine of DNA. The nucleotide sequences of RNA guide the translation of the genetic information of\nDNA into the structure of proteins (see below).\nChromosomesare composed of DNA and protein and they contain the genetic information of the\ncell. Chromosomes are self-duplicating\u2014they create exact copies of themselves throughthe process of\nreplication(seebelow).Anexactcopyispassedtoeachdaughtercellwhenacelldivides.Chromosomes\nin body (somatic) cells of plants and animals occur as complementary pairs (homologous pairs). The\nnumber of pairs of chromosomes varies greatly among species, from one to hundreds.\nGenesare specific regions of a chromosome that determine the development of a particular trait by\ncodingforaspecificproteinduringtranscription(seebelow).Becausechromosomesoccurinpairs,the\nChapter 6 ~ Evolution | 107 genes also arepaired.Genes commonlyoccurinmorethanone form,eachofwhichiscalledanallele.\nOften,onealleleisdominant(D)andtheotherrecessive(r).Thedominantoneisexpressedwhenboth\nallelesinagenepairareofthistype(DD),andalsowhenbothdominantandrecessiveallelesoccur(rDor\nDr).Recessiveallelesareexpressedonlyifbothareofthistype(rr).Theconditioninwhichbothallelesare\nthe same (DD or rr) is referred to as homozygous, while the mixed condition (rD or Dr) is heterozygous.\nReplicationisthebiochemicalprocessduringwhichthenucleotidesequenceofeachstrandofDNAis\ncopied.Replicationisnecessaryforcellulardivisiontooccur,becauseeachnewcellrequiresanidentical\ncopyoftheDNA.Duringreplication,thedoublehelixofDNA\u201cunzips,\u201dwhichallowsfreenucleotidesto\nhydrogen-bondwiththoseineachstrand,producingnewbutidenticalDNAmolecules.Ifanerroroccurs\nduring replication, the result in a change in the genetic information, which is called a mutation.\nTranscriptioninvolvesDNAunzippingandacomplementarystrandofRNAbeingmadeononeofthe\nDNA strands, in a manner similar to replication.

Proteins are extremely\nimportant,mainlyasstructuralchemicalsandmetabolism-regulatingenzymes.)Theinformationonthe\nmRNA,copiedfromtheDNA,determinestheexactsequenceofaminoacidsinaprotein,andtherefore\ndetermines its function.\nMeiosisisimportantinsexualreproduction,inwhichtwo\u201csex\u201dcells,onefromeachparent,combine\ntostartanewlife.Ifthosecellsweresomaticcells,eachwouldhavethesamenumberofchromosomes\nastheparent(thediploidnumber),andtheprogenywouldthenhavedoublethenumberoftheparent.\nHowever,thisdoesnotoccurbecausesexcellsarenotdiploid.Instead,throughmeiosis,thenumberof\nchromosomesinsexcellsishalved(tohaploid),sotheprogenyhasthesamenumberofchromosomesas\nthe parent.\nDuring meiosis, the paired chromosomes separate, with one of each pair going randomly to each\ndaughter \u201csex\u201d cell. Just before they separate, exchanges of genetic material may occur between the\npaired chromosomes\u2014a phenomenon known as crossing-over. Both of these processes increase the\nvariabilityofgeneticinformationinsexcells.Whenthehaploidsexcells(onefromeachparent)combine,\nthe result is a diploid progeny. Having chromosomes from each parent, the progeny is genetically\ndifferentfromthem,butalsosimilar.Thisishowparentspasstheirgeneticinformationtotheiroffspring.\nGenotyperefers to the unique genetic information of individual organisms, as embodied in the\nnucleotide sequences of their DNA. The unique genotype of an individual is fixed (except for rare\nmutations).However,thecollectivegenotypesofpopulationsandspeciesarequitevariable,althoughthis\nis restricted by the range of genetic variation among the constituent individuals.\nPhenotyperefers to the actual expression of an individual\u2019s genotype in terms of its anatomical\ndevelopment, behaviour, and biochemistry. For example, recessive alleles, unless in a homozygous\ncondition, are not expressed, even though they appear in the genotype.\nMoreimportantly,theexpressionofgeneticpotentialisalsoaffectedbyenvironmentalconditionsand\nother circumstances. For instance, a geranium plant, with a fixed complement of genetic information,\nmay be relatively tall and robust if it is grown under well-watered, fertile, uncrowded conditions.\nHowever, if that same individual were grown under drier, less fertile, more competitive conditions,\n108 | Chapter 6 ~ Evolution its productivity and appearance would be quite different. Such varying growth patterns of the same\ngenotype represent a phenotypically \u201cplastic\u201d response to environmental conditions. In contrast, the\nflower colour of individual geraniums (which can be white, red, or pink) is fixed genetically and is not\naffected by their environmental conditions.\nThe ability of an individual to exhibit phenotypically plastic responses to environmental variations\nis itself genetically determined to some extent. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity reflects both genetic\ncapabilityandvaryingexpressionofthatcapability,dependingonthecircumstancesmetduringthelife\nof an individual.\nEvolution\nEvolution may be simply defined as genetically based changes in populations of organisms, occurring over\nsuccessive generations.

In essence, natural\nselection predicts that individual organisms that are better adapted to coping with the opportunities or\nlimitations of their environment will have an increased likelihood of leaving descendants. If the adaptive\nadvantages are genetically determined, they will be passed to some of the progeny, then to subsequent\ngenerations, and so on. This process will result in evolutionary change.\nEvolutioncanalsooccurinresponsetocatastrophicinfluencesonpopulationsoforganisms,suchasaforest\nfireorflood.Thismayresultinmorehaphazard(random)changesinthegeneticstructureofapopulation.Small\npopulationsareparticularlysubjecttosuchnon-selectiveevolutionaryinfluences.Evolutionmayalsooccurin\nresponsetochoicesmadebyhumansofdesirabletraitsincertainspecies\u2014thisisknownasculturalselection(or\nartificial selection).\nIt is important to understand that individual organisms do not evolve. Evolution is a process of genetic\nchangefromgenerationtogeneration,occurringinpopulationsorhigher-ordergroupingsoforganisms(such\nas species). This is not to say that individual organisms cannot display variable responses to environmental\nconditions. These responses are, however, constrained by the degree of biochemical, developmental, and\nbehaviouralflexibilitythatisallowedbythegeneticcomplementofeachindividual(itsgenotype).Thevariable\nexpression of the genetic information of an individual is called phenotypic plasticity, but this response to\nvariationsinenvironmentalconditionsisnotevolutionarychange.Forevolutiontooccurtheremustbeachange\nin the collective genetic information of a population or species.\nEvolutioncanoccuratvariousscales.Evolutionarybiologistsusethetermmicroevolutiontorefertorelatively\nsubtle changes occurring within a population or species, often within only a few generations.

Early studies of this sort mostly involved comparative anatomy. Research on animals\nrelied mostly on the characteristics of bones, shells, skins, and other enduring structures, while studies of\nplants largely involved the anatomy of flowers and fruits. More recent studies gather a much wider range of\ncomparative information to examine relatedness among groups of species, including information about their\nbehaviour,ecology,proteins,and\u2014mostrecently\u2014specificbasesequencesofDNA.Forexample,studiesinvolving\nDNA and blood proteins have clearly shown that humans are closely related to other great apes, such as the\nchimpanzee, orangutan, and gorilla.

In particular, creationists reject the theory of evolution in favour of a literal\ninterpretation of Genesis. They assert that the account given in Genesis means that God created the universe\nandalllivingorganismsduringasix-dayperiod,culminatingwiththecreationofhumans.Humanswerecreated\n112 | Chapter 6 ~ Evolution inthephysicalimageofGodandweregivenauthorityandpowertofreelyusetheresourcesofEarth:\u201cAndGod\nsaid,letusmakeManinourimage,afterourlikeness;andletthemhavedominionoverthefishofthesea,and\noverthefowloftheair,andoverthecattle,andoveralltheEarthandovereverycreepingthingthatcreepeth\nover the Earth.\u201d\nMoreover, humans were instructed to increase their populations and to exploit nature: \u201cBe fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it.\u201d\nNote, however, that there is some controversy about the meaning of the word \u201creplenish\u201d in this biblical\npassage.Somepeoplehaveinterpreteditinthesenseofconservation,asintorefillorrestoreresourcesasthey\nare used. Others, however, maintain that the original meaning was \u201cto fill up,\u201d and, in this sense, it referred to\nfilling the Earth with humans and their economic activities. The latter interpretation is the one that is usually\nacceptedinmodernenvironmentalwritingsthatexaminetherelationshipbetweenhumans,theireconomy,and\nthe natural world.\nBased on their literal interpretation of Genesis and other passages in the Bible, creationists have drawn the\nfollowing conclusions relevant to evolution:\n\u2022 Earth and its species are not ancient because creation occurred only a few thousand years ago.\n\u2022 Species are essentially immutable, having been created as entities that have not changed since their\ncreation.\n\u2022 Because species were individually created, existing species did not descend from earlier ones through\nevolution.\n\u2022 Humans are particularly special, having been created in the Creator\u2019s image\u2014they are not related to or\ndescended from any other species.\nBut these ideas do not accord with scientific findings, as were described on the preceding pages. In particular:\n\u2022 The geological record clearly demonstrates that Earth and the solar system are extremely old, having\nbegun to develop at least 4.5 billion years ago. Life is also ancient, having originated about 3.5 billion years\nago. Earth and organisms date back much further than a few thousand years.\n\u2022 The fossil record provides many examples of large changes in the characteristics of species over time, as do\nstudies of some living species. Clearly, species are not immutable. Moreover, the existing complement of\nspecies on Earth represents only a small sample of all those that have ever lived. The fossil record\ndemonstrates that most species that evolved during the long biological history of our planet are now\nextinct. Many of the extinct species, families, and even phyla have no living descendants\u2014their entire\nlineage is extinct (see Chapter 7).\n\u2022 The fossil record presents clear evidence of lineages among groups of organisms, indicating that living\nspecies have descended from earlier ones. In almost all cases, the progenitor species are now extinct.\nThere are even a few examples in the fossil record of links between major groups. Perhaps the most famous\nof these is Archaeopteryx, a metre-long creature that lived about 150 million years ago. It had teeth and\nother dinosaurian characters, but it also had a feathered body and could fly. Archaeopteryx is considered to\nbe a link between extinct dinosaurs and living birds.\n\u2022 Fossil and genetic information indicate that humans are descended from earlier, now-extinct species and\ngenera. Fossil records show that the human species (Homo sapiens) is derived from an evolutionary lineage\nof anthropoid apes. There are a few other surviving species in that lineage, with chimpanzees, and to a\nlesser degree gorillas and orangutans, being the closest living relatives of humans. All surviving members of\nthe ape family are descended from now-extinct progenitors.\nChapter 6 ~ Evolution | 113 PeopleknownasscientificcreationistsalsoinsistthattheirinterpretationofGenesisisthemostreliablesource\nof knowledge about the origin and evolution of life. Scientific creationists have attempted to explain some of\nthe discrepancies between their beliefs and current scientific understanding of evolution. For example, some\nof them acknowledge that geological and fossil evidence suggests that Earth and life are ancient phenomena\nand that most species have become extinct. Most scientific creationists also acknowledge that species have\nchanged over time, but only through microevolution\u2014they do not agree that macroevolution has led to the\ndevelopment of new species from earlier ones. By extension, scientific creationists also do not believe that\nhumans are descended from previous species of hominids or are related to other ape-like creatures or other\nprimates.Moreover,thetheoryofscientificcreationismdoesnotabandonthenotionthat,atoneparticulartime\nin the past, God created all species that have ever lived on Earth.\nScience proceeds by careful observation and hypothesis testing. But scientific creationism rests on a belief,\nnotatestablehypothesis,concerningaliteralinterpretationoftheBibleasrepresenting\u201ctruth\u201dand\u201cknowledge\u201d.\nMostpredictionsofscientificcreationistscannotbetestedbyrigorousmethodology,butwhentheycanbe,they\nare refuted by the evidence. In short, despite its name, scientific creationism is not science.\nEvolution by Natural Selection\nBecause organisms vary in their genetics and phenotypes, they also differ in their abilities to deal successfully\nwithstressesandopportunitiesintheirenvironment.Undercertainconditions,anindividualwithaparticular\nphenotype(whichissubstantiallydeterminedbyitsgenotype)mayberelativelysuccessfulcomparedwithothers\nhaving different genotypes and phenotypes.\nInthesensemeanthere,the\u201csuccess\u201dofanindividualmeanssuccessfulreproduction\u2013havingprogenythat\nthemselves go on to reproduce successfully. This is also referred to as fitness, or the proportionate genetic\ncontributionmadebyanindividualtoalloftheprogenyinitspopulation.Acentraltenetofevolutionarytheory\nis that individuals maximize their fitness by optimizing the degree to which their own genetic attributes will\ninfluence future generations of their species.\nBiologistsbelievethatevolutionproceedsmainlybynaturalselection,whichoperateswhengeneticallybased\nvariationexistsamongindividualswithinapopulation,sothatsomeofthemarebetteradaptedtodealwiththe\nprevailingenvironmentalconditions.Onaverage,themore-fitorganismshavegreatersuccessinreproduction,\nand so have a disproportionate influence on the evolution of subsequent generations.\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection is perhaps the greatest unifying concept in modern biology, as\nit gives context to virtually all aspects of the study of life. This theory was co-announced publicly in 1858 by\ntwo English naturalists: Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823\u20131913). Darwin, however,\nhad been working on aspects of the theory for about 20 years prior to its publication, and he had collected\ndetailed evidence in support of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution. Darwin\u2019s copious evidence was\nmarshalled in the famous book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, published in 1859.\nBecauseofthisbook,DarwinhasbecomemorecloselylinkedthanWallacetothetheoryofevolutionbynatural\nselection.Darwinisalsothemorefamousofthetwoscientists,largelybecauseofhisgreatcontributionstoward\nunderstandingthemechanismsofevolution.Perhapsthemostinfluentialbiologistofalltime,Darwinundertook\nan astonishingly broad range of research projects on a great variety of species and biological topics.\nIn his Origin of Species, Darwin summarized natural selection in the following way: \u201cCan we doubt \u2026 that\nindividuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of\n114 | Chapter 6 ~ Evolution procreatingtheirkind?Ontheotherhand,wemayfeelsurethatanyvariationintheleastdegreeinjuriouswould\nbe rigidly destroyed.

Only some individuals manage to\nsurvive this struggle for existence and reproduce.\n\u2022 Because individuals within a species are different from each other, and much of this variation is heritable, it\nis reasonable to suggest that survival in the struggle for existence is partly influenced by genetically\ndetermined differences in abilities.\n\u2022 Individuals that are more capable will have a better chance of surviving and reproducing, and their\ngenetically based attributes will be disproportionately represented in future generations.\n\u2022 Over long periods of time, this process of natural selection will lead to evolutionary changes within\npopulations, and eventually to the evolution of new species.\nWhen it was first presented publicly in 1858, the theory of evolution by natural selection created a sensation\namongscientistsandalsowithinsociety.Theexcitementandcontroversyoccurredlargelybecausethetheory\nprovidedthefirstconvincingbodyofevidenceinsupportofthefollowingthreenotions:(a)evolutionoccurs,(b)\nit proceeds under natural influences, and (c) it has resulted in the great diversity of living species.\nThiswasaradicallydifferentviewfromthatofcreationism,whichwastheprevailingexplanationoftheorigin\noflifeandspeciesinthemid-nineteenthcentury.Interestingly,Darwin\u2019swritingsdidnotdirectlychallengethe\nexistenceofadivineCreator.Hemostlydiscussedthecausesofchangeinspeciesovertime,anddidnotdirectly\nsuggestthattheinitialancestorshadnotbeencreatedbyGod.Moderntheoriesaboutthespontaneousgenesis\noflifeonEartharebasedonrelativelysophisticatedsciencethatwasunknowntoDarwin.Nordidheknowof\nthe mechanisms of genetics and the inheritance of traits.\nModern extensions of the theory of evolution by natural selection suggest that new species evolve from\nprogenitors (a process known as speciation). This is thought to happen when populations become isolated\nby intervening barriers such as a mountain range, extensive glaciers, or other inhospitable discontinuities.\nIsolation is important in speciation because it reduces or eliminates genetic interchanges, and thereby allows\ndifferentiation to proceed more effectively.

One popular theory, the \u201cinheritance of acquired traits\u201d, was based on the\nobservationthatthemorphology,behaviour,and/orbiochemistryofindividualorganismscouldvaryinresponse\nto environmental change. According to the theory, these plastic responses to environmental conditions could\nbe passed along to an individual\u2019s progeny.

It is, however, useful to examine the key\nexperiments that first suggested the existence of genes.\nThisresearchwasconductedbyGregorMendel(1822\u20131884),anAustrianscientist(andmonk)whodeveloped\nimportantideasaboutinheritancethroughbreedingexperimentswiththegardenpea(Pisumsativum).Mendel\nwas interested in producing pea hybrids, which involves crossing two parent plants, each having distinctive\ntraits. Prior research had shown that certain traits were fixed in cultivated varieties of peas, including flower\ncolour (white or purple) and whether the seeds have a wrinkled or smooth coat. In total, Mendel worked with\n32 traits of this sort. Pea flowers are bisexual, containing both female (pistil, containing the ovules) and male\n(anthers, containing pollen) parts. These are compatible within the same individual, so self-fertilization can\noccur. However, Mendel experimented by cross-fertilizing selected parents, producing known hybridizations.\nIn each experiment, Mendel cross-bred two inbred varieties in which certain traits \u201cbred true\u201d (they were\nhomozygous, such as for a white or purple flower colour). The progeny (first generation) were all the same:\ntheyallhadpurpleflowers.However,crossesbetweenthefirst-generationplantsyieldedaratioofaboutthree\npurpleflowerstoonewhiteflowerinthesecondgeneration.Thisfitsthepredictionfortwo-generationcrosses\nbetween two homozygous lines, as follows:\n1. Represent the original purple variety as AA. This trait is dominant over the white flower trait (called\nrecessive).\n2. Represent the original white variety as aa.\n3. When the two plants are crossed, the first-generation progeny all have purple flowers but are\nheterozygous (Aa).\n4. A cross between the first-generation plants yields four possible outcomes: AA, Aa, aA, and aa. Each is\nequally probable. Because A is dominant to a, the AA, Aa, and aA progeny all have purple flowers. Only aa\nhas white flowers. Therefore, the expected ratio of purple to white among the second-generation progeny\n116 | Chapter 6 ~ Evolution is 3:1.\nThemostimportantconclusiontoemergefromMendel\u2019sworkwasthattheinheritanceofgeneticinformation\noccursina\u201cparticulate\u201dform(whichwenowrefertoasgenes),ofteninvolvingdominantandrecessivealleles.\nInheritance is not a blended condition\u2014in the example just described, a cross of purple- and white-flowered\npeaplantsdoesnotyieldprogenyofanintermediatecolour.Therefore,flowercolourandmanyothertraitsare\ndiscrete units that remain intact during inheritance and either are, or are not, expressed in progeny.\nMendelfirstpublishedhisresultsin1865inarelativelyobscurejournal.Asaresult,theworkwasunknownto\nthemainstreamofscienceformanyyears.However,Mendel\u2019sworkwasre-discoveredandrepublishedin1900\nand it quickly became the basis of modern theories of genetic inheritance.\nMendel\u2019s work and the subsequent flourishing of the science of genetics have been extremely important in\nbiology and in the development of the modern theory of evolution. This is because genetics allows a rational\nexplanation of inheritance as a mechanism by which genetically fixed traits can be passed along to offspring.\nSubsequent research has found that new genotypes can arise through various mechanisms, such as\nhybridization, polyploidism (a spontaneous increase in the number of chromosomes), and mutations. Genetic\nvariation is, of course, the menu of possibilities from which natural selection can choose so that adaptive\nevolution can occur.\nIt is important to recognize that much genetic information in an individual does not appear to code for\nfunctional enzymes or other proteins, and so does not code for traits that could be selected for or against.\nBecauseofitsneutralitywithrespecttonaturalselection,thistypeofgeneticmaterialissometimesreferredto\nas\u201cjunkDNA\u201d.However,wemaybeignorantofotherrolesthatso-calledjunkDNAmayplayinthefunctioning\nof the genome.\nEnvironmental Issues 6.1. Genetically Modified Organisms\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs) are a highly controversial topic. But what, exactly, is meant by\nthe term?\nStrictly speaking, GMOs are organisms whose genotype has been influenced by human intervention.\nBut people have been doing this for an extremely long time. As early as about 10,000 years ago, when\npeoplefirstbegantocultivateotherspeciesascrops,theyselectivelybredindividualplantsandanimals\nthat had favourable traits (see Chapter 10 for an explanation of socio-cultural evolution, including the\nearlydevelopmentofagriculture).This\u201cartificialselection\u201drapidlyledtotheevolutionofcropvarieties\nthat were more responsive to management and had greater yields than their wild progenitors. In this\nsense, almost all domesticated species of plants, animals, and microorganisms that are cultivated as\nsources of food, material, or energy are \u201cgenetically modified organisms.\u201d They were produced using\nconventional methods of selective breeding, a process that is not very controversial.\nMorerecently,however,newtechniquesinbiotechnology,specificallyinmolecularbiology,havebeen\nusedtocreatenovelgeneticmodificationsoforganisms.Thesetechniquesallowbiologiststoselectively\ninsert portions of the DNA of one species into the genome of another species. This is a fundamentally\ndifferent kind of genetic modification than selective breeding, and it should more properly be referred\nto as transgenic modification, or as recombinant bioengineering. There are potential benefits to this\nkindofgeneticmodificationofcropspecies,includingthedevelopmentofvarietiesthatareresistantto\ndiseases or pests and that require less fertilizer or pesticide. In spite of these seeming benefits, there\nis controversy over transgenic biotechnology and the commercial use of GMOs, largely because of the\nfollowing issues:\n\u2022 Should scientists be interfering with the very foundation of life\u2014the genetics of species\u2014by using\nChapter 6 ~ Evolution | 117 methods of genetic \u201cengineering\u201d that do not normally exist in nature?\n\u2022 Donovel,transgenicorganismsrepresent\u201cnew\u201dvarietiesofdesignedandmanufacturedlifethatare\nappropriateforpatentinganduseforcommercialgain?(Infact,variouslegalrulingshavestatedthat\nthis can be done, and some transgenic crops have become extremely profitable to owners of the\npatents.)\n\u2022 Are important ecological risks associated with the cultivation of transgenic organisms? Because\nmany biological and ecological unknowns are associated with this practice, \u201csurprises\u201d may follow\nfromthereleaseoftheseorganismsintotheenvironment,includingunanticipateddamagetocrops,\nwild species, and natural ecosystems.\nThese are contentious and precautionary issues, and the controversy is not resolved. In some cases,\nillegal releases of GMO products have been made by private interests, a circumstance that reflects\nweakness intheregulatorycontrolmechanisms (Clapp,2008).Nevertheless, someGMOproductshave\nbeen widely commercialized and are now routinely used. For instance, transgenic GMO varieties of\nsoybean and canola have been developed to be resistant to glyphosate, which allows this herbicide\nto be used on those crops. This practice results in benefits to farmers from reduced costs of energy\nand machinery needed to control weeds. In a similar vein, transgenic varieties of maize (corn) have\nbeen developed that contain modified DNA of the insecticidal bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. This\nprovides resistance to important insect pests and allows farmers to use less insecticide. These and\nother transgenic crops are now widely cultivated in North America (although they are banned in other\ncountries, including most of Europe and Brazil), but relatively little is known about the biological and\necological risks that may arise when their transgenic factors escape to wild plants.\nAdditional Mechanisms of Evolution\nAlthough natural selection is the most important mechanism of evolution, it is not the only one. For example,\nartificial selection involves the deliberate breeding of plants, animals, and microorganisms to enhance certain\ntraits that humans view as desirable. Artificial selection has obvious parallels to natural selection in that\nindividual organisms with particular, genetically based traits experience greater success in breeding, so they\nbecomeover-representedinsubsequentgenerations.However,traitsthatarefavouredinartificialselectionmay\nnotbeadaptiveinthenaturalworld.Inaddition,becausethebreedingofdesiredgenotypescanbecontrolled,\nevolutionary change occurs much more rapidly under artificial selection than under natural selection.\nFor example, maize (or corn, Zea mays) is an important crop that, through artificial selection, now differs\nenormouslyfromitsclosestwildprogenitor,aMexicangrassknownasteosinte(Euchlaenamexicana).Artificial\nselection has caused many evolutionary changes in maize. For example, the fruiting head (consisting of the\ncob and seeds) is much larger than in wild ancestors of maize; the seeds have different coloration; the seeds\nimplantsecurelyontothecobsotheydonotscatterbeforeharvesting;theripefruitistightlywrappedwithin\nenclosingleavesknownasbracts,againtopreventpre-harvestlosses;andtherearevigorousgrowthresponses\nto fertilizer application, weed control, and other cultivation practices. Moreover, without the intervention of\nhumans through cultivation, maize would likely become extinct within only a few generations. This is partly\nbecause artificial selection has rendered its seeds virtually incapable of detaching from the cob, which in any\nevent is tightly bound in leafy bracts. Therefore, unaided seed dispersal is almost impossible.\nAll domesticated plant, animal, and microbial species have undergone artificial selection for desirable traits.\n118 | Chapter 6 ~ Evolution Sometimes,however,artificialselectionproceedsinbizarredirections,withthefosteringofgenetictraitsthat\nare viewed as desirable for aesthetic rather than practical reasons. For example, oriental breeders of pet fish\nhaveproducedsomeamazingvarietiesofgoldfish(Carassiusauratus)andkoi(agolden-colouredvarietyofcarp,\nCyprinuscarpio).Thesevarieties,oftenwithgrotesqueshapesandbehaviours,wouldberapidlyeliminatedina\nwildpopulationbutareprizedasunusualandvaluablespecimensbyaficionadosoftheseaquaticpets.Similar\ncomments could be made about curious varieties of cats, dogs, pigeons, and many kinds of horticultural plants.\nEvolution can also occur through a process known as genetic drift, or random changes in the frequencies\nof genes occurring in small and isolated populations. Such populations often exist on islands, or they may be\ncreatedthroughacatastrophicreductionofalargerpopulationbecauseofdisease,disturbance,orsomeother\nfactor. The relatively small genetic base of small populations is sometimes called a \u201cbottleneck.\u201d Subsequent\nevolution is based on the restricted genetic variation of only a few individuals, which may become further\nreduced through the effects of inbreeding (reproduction between closely related individuals, such as siblings).\nGiventherestrictedamountofgeneticvariation,theevolutionofasmallpopulationmayproceedverydifferently\nfrom that of a larger population.\nImage 6.3.

It is thought\nthatlifespontaneouslyaroseatleast3.5billionyearsago,becauseoftheexistenceofenvironmentalconditions\nappropriate for its genesis. Since that origin, profound changes have occurred in the morphology and\nfunctionalityoforganisms throughaprocessknownasevolution. Evolution maybesimplydefinedaschanges\nin the genetic makeup of populations and species over time (individual organisms do not evolve).

How is natural selection a mechanism of evolution? What are other means by which evolution can occur?\n4.

Describe the five kingdoms of life.\nBiodiversity\nBiodiversity is the richness of biological variation. It is often considered to have three levels of organization:\n1. genetic variation within populations and species\n2. numbers of species (also known as species richness)\n3. and the variety and dynamics of ecological communities on larger scales, such as landscapes and seascapes\nGenetic Variation\nInalmostallspecies,individualsdiffergenetically\u2013thatis,intermsofinformationencodedintheirDNA.This\nvariation constitutes genetic biodiversity at the level of populations, and ultimately of the species.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this generalization.

This value is fundamental to all elements of biodiversity, and is irreplaceable.\nThis intrinsic value raises certain ethical questions about actions that threaten biodiversity. Do humans have\nthe \u201cright\u201d to impoverish or exterminate unique and irretrievable elements of biodiversity, even if our species\nis technologically able to do so? Is the human existence somehow impoverished by extinctions caused by our\nactions? These are philosophical issues, and they cannot be resolved by science alone. However, enlightened\npeople or societies would not facilitate the endangerment or extinction of species or natural communities.\nBiodiversity Is Worthwhile\nMany people firmly believe that wild biodiversity and natural ecosystems are worthwhile and important. They\ncitetheutilitarianandintrinsicvaluesofbiodiversity,butmayalsomentionlesstangibleopinions,suchasthe\ncharisma of many species (such as wolves, pandas, and baby harp seals) and the spirituality of natural places\n(suchastoweringold-growthforestandotherkindsofwilderness).Becausethisbeliefisbecomingincreasingly\nwidespreadandpopularized,itishavingamajorinfluenceonpoliticians,whoareincludingbiodiversityissuesin\ntheir agendas for action\u2014threats to biodiversity have become politically important.\nUndoubtedly,thereisanundiscoveredwealthofproductsofbiodiversitythatarepotentiallyusefultohumans.\nManyofthesebio-productswillbefoundintropicalspeciesthathavenotyetbeen\u201cdiscovered\u201dbybiologists.\nClearly, the most important argument in favour of preserving biodiversity is the need to maintain natural\necosystemssotheycancontinuetoprovidetheirvastinventoryofusefulproductsandtheirvaluableecological\nservices. In addition, biodiversity must also be preserved for its intrinsic value.\nImage 7.4.

These classifications are made by systematists (biologists who study the evolutionary relationships\namong groups of organisms) and taxonomists (who focus on naming groups of organisms).\nThe systematics of life is organized hierarchically, with levels ranging through subspecies, species, genus,\nfamily, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. This system is illustrated in Table 7.2.\nTable 7.2. Biological Classification. The hierarchical, systematic classification of organisms is illustrated\nChapter 7 ~ Biodiversity | 131 by three representative species.\nA species is described using two Latinized words, known as a binomial. If a subspecies is also recognized, the\nname has three Latin words (such as Pseudotsuga menziesii glauca, the interior form of the Douglas-fir).\nManyspeciesalsohaveascientificallyrecognized\u201ccommonname,\u201dandtheymayalsohaveinformalcommon\nnames.Forexample,thescientificallyrecognizedcommonnameofthewidespreadtreePopulustremuloidesis\ntrembling aspen, but this species is also known as aspen, golden aspen, mountain aspen, poplar, quaking asp,\nquakingaspen,tremblingpoplar,andthatold-timefavourite,\u201cpopple.\u201dSomeofthecommonnameshaveonlya\nlocaluseandareunknowninotherpartsoftherangeofthespecies.Commonnamesmayalsooverlapamong\nspecies\u2014for instance, both the balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and large-toothed aspen (P. grandidentata)\nare often called \u201cpoplar.\u201d\nToavoidtheambiguitiesassociatedwithcommonnames,speciesareassignedagloballyrecognizedbinomial\nand sometimes a \u201cproper\u201d common name. Because of this system, biologists working in Canada, the United\nStates, Germany, Turkey, Russia, China, and other countries where the animal Ursus arctos occurs all know it\nby its binomial. In English, this animal is known as the grizzly or brown bear, and in other languages by other\ncommon names. But no one is confused by its scientific binomial name.\nThe Organization of Life\nMost biologists divide all of Earth\u2019s species into five major groups, known as kingdoms. Although somewhat\ncontroversial and subject to ongoing refinement, this systematic organization is believed to reflect the\nevolutionaryrelationshipsamonggroupsoforganisms.Thekingdomsandtheirmajorcharacteristicsarebriefly\ndescribed below.\nMonera\nMonerans are the simplest of single-celled microorganisms and include bacteria and blue-green bacteria, the\nlatter being photosynthetic.

Some bacteria can tolerate extreme\nenvironments, living in hot springs as torrid as 78\u00b0C, while others are active as deep as 400 m in glacial ice.\nManybacterialspeciesliveinmutuallybeneficialsymbioses(mutualisms)withmore-complexorganisms.For\nexample,someliveasacommunityintherumensofcowsandsheep,andothersliveinthehumangut,inboth\ncasesaidinginthedigestionoffood.Otherbacteria,knownasRhizobium,liveintherootsofleguminousplants\n(suchaspeasandclovers),wheretheyfixatmosphericnitrogengasintoaform(ammonia)thatplantscanuseas\na nutrient (see Chapter 5).\nMany bacteria are parasites of other species, causing various diseases.

The\nlattergroupincludesthelargeseaweedsknownaskelps,someofwhichareover10mlong.ThekingdomProtista\nconsists of 14 phyla and about 60,000 named species, which vary enormously in their genetics, morphology,\nandfunction.ManybiologistsbelievethattheProtistaisacatch-allgroupofnot-so-closelyrelatedgroups.Itis\nlikelythattheprotistswilleventuallybedividedintoseveralkingdomsbecauseofaccumulatingevidenceofkey\ndifferencesamonggroupsandrecognitionthattheother,more-complexeukaryotickingdoms(fungi,plants,and\nanimals) evolved from different protistan ancestors.\nSeveral phyla of protists, broadly known as algae, are photosynthetic. These groups include the diatoms\n(Bacillariophyta),greenalgae(Chlorophyta),dinoflagellates(Dinoflagellata),euglenoids(Euglenophyta),redalgae\n(Rhodophyta), and brown algae such as kelps (Phaeophyta). Algae are important primary producers in marine\nand freshwater ecosystems. Some seaweeds are harvested to extract chemicals known as alginates, which are\nimportant additives to many foods and cosmetics. Uncommon marine phenomena known as \u201cred tides\u201d are\nblooms of certain dinoflagellates that produce extremely toxic metabolites.\nOther phyla of protists are heterotrophic in their nutrition. These groups include the ciliates (Ciliophora),\nforams (Foraminifera), slime moulds (Myxomycota), amoebae (Rhizopoda), and unicellular flagellates\n(Zoomastigina). Forams are unicellular microorganisms that form an architecturally complex shell of calcium\ncarbonate, the remains of which may accumulate over geological time to form a mineral known as chalk- the\nwhitecliffsofDoverinsouthernEnglandaremadeofforamremains.Trypanosomesareunicellularflagellates\nthatareresponsibleforsleepingsickness,adiseaseofhumansandothervertebrateanimals.Certainspeciesof\namoebae are parasites of animals, including amoebic dysentery in humans.

There are about 600 named\nspecies,themostfamiliarofwhicharethebreadmoulds,suchasRhizopus,withtheirfluffymycelium(aloosely\norganized mass of hyphae).\nThe ascomycetes (division Ascomycota) include about 30,000 named species, some of which are commonly\nknown as a cup fungus or morel.

Damage to biodiversity is a principal aspect of the environmental crisis.\nQuestions for Review\n1. What are the major components of biodiversity? Provide an example of each.\n2. Pick any species in which you are interested. Illustrate the hierarchical classification of life by giving the\nscientific names of its species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom.\n3. What are the five kingdoms of life? Identify several groups within each of the kingdoms.\nChapter 7 ~ Biodiversity | 139 Questions for Discussion\n1. Why is biodiversity important? Outline several reasons.\n2. Discuss the notion that all species are similarly \u201cadvanced\u201d in the evolutionary sense but may vary greatly in\ntheir complexity.\n3. All elements of biodiversity are considered to have intrinsic value. What does this mean? Can it be fully\njustified in a strictly scientific context?\n4. Choose an economically important \u201cpest,\u201d such as the house mouse (Mus musculus), a disease-carrying\nmosquito (such as an Anopheles species), or the groups A and B Streptococcus bacteria that cause deadly\ninfections. Now suppose that a new method has been discovered to eradicate that pest, which would cause\nits global extinction. Based on ideas about intrinsic value and other considerations, could you mount a\nlogical defence of the pest to argue against its extinction?\nExploring Issues\n1. You are a biodiversity specialist, and a group of politicians has asked why it should spend public money to\nprotect an endangered species occurring within their jurisdiction. You know that these people are\nsceptical, and that if you do not convince them to preserve the species and its habitat, it may become\nextinct. What information and arguments would you include in your presentation to the politicians?\n2. Make a comprehensive list of products of biodiversity that you use in a typical day. The list can include raw\nand processed foods, medicines, materials, and sources of energy.\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nBegon, M., R.W. Howorth, and C.R. Townsend. 2014.

Identify the major biomes and outline their characteristics.\n2. Identify Canada\u2019s ecozones.\n3. Describe the differences between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems.\nBiomes: Global Ecosystems\nA biome is a geographically extensive type of ecosystem. A particular biome occurs wherever environmental\nconditionsaresuitableforitsdevelopment,anywhereintheworld.Biomesarecharacterizedbythelifeforms\nof their dominant organisms, but not necessarily by their particular species. On land, biomes are generally\nidentifiedbytheirmatureorolder-growthvegetation.Incontrast,aquaticbiomesareusuallydistinguishedby\ntheir dominant animals. Biomes are classified using a system that is used at an international level\u2014that is, by\necologists working in many countries.\nFigure 8.1 shows a map of the distribution of the most extensive terrestrial biomes.

In other words, the different species are\nChapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones | 143 comparable in their form and function, because the regimes of natural selection occurring in similar\nenvironmentsresultinparallel(orconvergent)evolutionaryresponses.Therefore,biomesaredefinedprimarily\nby the structure and function of their ecosystem, but not necessarily their species composition.\nThiscontextisillustratedbytheborealforest,anextensivebiomethatoccursinnorthernregionsofCanada,\nAlaska,andEurasia.Theborealforestoccursinregionswithacoldandlongwinter,shortbutwarmsummer,and\ngenerallymoistsoil.Thisbiomeissituatedbetweenthemorenortherntundra,andtemperateforestorprairieto\nthesouth.Thedominantvegetationofborealforestistypicallyconiferoustrees,especiallyspeciesoffir,larch,\npine, or spruce.

Alpine tundra occurs at higher elevations in mountainous\nregions, even in tropical countries. Arctic tundra occurs at high latitudes\u2014that is, in northern regions of the\nNorthern Hemisphere and southern parts of the Southern Hemisphere. Most tundras are a meteorological\ndesert because they receive sparse precipitation. Nevertheless, the soil may be moist or wet because the cold\nenvironment restricts the amount of evaporation that occurs, and frozen soil may prevent deep drainage of\nwater.Thecoldest,mostnortherly,high-Arctictundraisextremelyunproductiveanddominatedbyshort,long-\nlivedplants,generallygrowinglessthan5-10cmabovethesurface.Intheless-coldenvironmentsofthelower\nArctic,well-drainedtundramaybedominatedbyshrubsgrowingastallas1-2m,whilewetterhabitatssupport\nproductive meadows of sedge, cottongrass, and grass.\nImage 8.1.

Freedman.\nFreshwater Biomes\nLenticecosystems containstandingorveryslowlyflowingwater,asoccursinlakesandponds.Theecological\ncharacter of lentic systems is most strongly influenced by water chemistry, particularly its transparency and\nnutrient concentration. Waters that are well supplied with nutrients are highly productive (eutrophic), while\ninfertile waters are unproductive (oligotrophic). In general, shallow waterbodies are much more productive\nthan deeper ones of a comparable surface area. However, waterbodies with poor transparency are much less\nproductive than might be predicted on the basis of their nutrient supply. Waters that are brown-coloured\nbecause of dissolved organic matter have poor transparency, as do turbid waters with fine suspended\nparticulates.Lenticecosystemsarecharacterizedbyzonationintwodimensions.Horizontalzonationisdueto\nchanges in water depth and is usually relatedto the slope and length of the shore. Vertical zonation occurs in\ndeeperwaterandisrelatedtotheamountoflight,watertemperature,andnutrientandoxygenconcentrations.\nLentic ecosystems often develop distinct communities along their shore (known as the littoral zone), in their\ndeeper open water (the pelagic zone), and on their sediment (the benthic zone).\nLotic ecosystems are characterized by flowing water and include rivers and streams. The quantity, velocity,\n150 | Chapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones and seasonal variation of water flow are important environmental factors. Within streams or rivers, silt-sized\nparticles are deposited in places with relatively calm water, leaving a fine-grained or muddy substrate. In\ncontrast,thesubstrateofplaceswithvigorouswaterflowisrockybecausefineparticleshavebeenerodedaway.\nFor similar reasons, the turbidity is greatest during times of high water flow. Turbidity is an important factor\nbecauseitinterfereswithlightpenetrationandtherebyrestrictsprimaryproductivity.Loticecosystemssustain\nsome productivity of algae and aquatic plants, but usually their primary production is not large. Most of the\nproductivityofaquaticinvertebratesandfishinloticecosystemsissustainedbyinputsoforganicmatterfrom\nupstream lakes and from the terrestrial watershed in the form of plant debris.\nWetlands occur in shallow, flooded places on land.

Freedman.\nMarine Biomes\nThe open ocean consists of pelagic and benthic ecosystems. The pelagic (open-water) ecosystem is strongly\ninfluenced by physical and chemical factors, particularly waves, tides, currents, salinity, temperature, light\nintensity, and nutrient concentration. The rate of productivity is small, and comparable to that of terrestrial\ndesert. The primary production is associated with phytoplankton, which range in size from extremely small\nphotosynthetic bacteria to larger (but still microscopic) unicellular and colonial algae. The phytoplankton are\ngrazedbytinyanimalsknownaszooplankton(mostofwhicharecrustaceans),whichareeateninturnbylarger\nzooplankton and small fish. Large predators such as bluefin tuna, sharks, squid, and whales are at the top of\nthe pelagic food web. The benthic ecosystem of the open ocean biome is supported by a sparse rain of dead\nbiomass from the surface. The benthic ecosystem of the deep oceans is not yet well described, but it appears\nto be somewhat rich in species, low in productivity, and extremely stable over time. Some large regions of\nthe open ocean have an enormous rotating surface current known as a gyre, which is caused by the Coriolis\neffectassociatedwiththerotationofEarth.GyresintheNorthernHemisphererotateinaclockwisedirection,\nwhilethoseintheSouthernHemispherearecounter-clockwise.Gyrescollectfloatingmaterial,suchasfloating\nseaweedslikeSargassum,aswellasgarbagefromcoastaldumpinganddebrisfromfishingfleets.Oneexample\nistheNorthPacificgyre,whichcoversmostofthatoceanicbasin,andanotheristheNorthAtlanticgyre,also\nknown as the Sargasso Sea.\nContinental shelf waters occur near the shores of continents and are relatively shallow because they overlie\n152 | Chapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones anunderwaterprojectionofthelandmass(acontinentalshelf).Comparedwiththeopenocean,thesenearshore\nwatersarerelativelywarmandwellsuppliedwithnutrients.Thenutrientscomefrominputsofriversandfrom\ndeeper, relatively fertile oceanic water that is occasionally stirred from the bottom by currents or turbulence\ncaused by windstorms. Because the nutrient supply of coastal waters is relatively high, phytoplankton are\nproductive and support a higher biomass of animals than occurs in the open ocean. Some of the world\u2019s most\nimportant fisheries are supported by the continental shelf biome \u2013 for example, those on the Grand Banks\nandothershallowwatersofnortheasternNorthAmerica,inthenearshorewatersofwesternNorthandSouth\nAmerica, and in the Gulf of Mexico.\nImage 8.9.

They\nare highly productive ecosystems, largely because their semi-enclosed circulation tends to retain much of the\nwater-borneinputofterrestrialnutrients.Estuariesprovidecriticalhabitatforjuvenilestagesofcommercially\nimportant fishes, shellfish, and crustaceans.\nChapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones | 153 Seashoresareaninterfaceofterrestrialandoceanicbiomesandtheysupportacomplexofcoastalecosystems.\nTheseashorebiomeislocallyinfluencedbyphysicalenvironmentalfactors,especiallybottomtype,theintensity\nof wave action, and the frequency of major disturbances such as storms. Hard-rock and cobblestone bottoms\nin temperate regions usually develop communities dominated by large species of seaweeds or kelp. These are\nproductive ecosystems and can maintain large amounts of algal biomass. Areas with softer bottoms of sand\nor mud develop communities supported by the productivity of benthic algae and inputs of organic detritus\nfrom elsewhere. These soft-bottom ecosystems are usually dominated by invertebrates, especially molluscs,\nechinoderms, crustaceans, and marine worms.\nCoralreefs areatropicalmarine biome thatdevelops inshallow,relativelyinfertile placesclose toland.

Transnational Species and Ecosystems\nBecause biomes are defined as \u201cgeographically extensive ecosystems, occurring throughout the world\nwherever environmental conditions are suitable,\u201d they have a global context. Temperate forest, for\ninstance, occurs in all countries in which environmental conditions are favourable for its development.\nIncomparison,ecozonesaremorespecificallydefinedonthebasisoftheirlandforms,climate,species,\nand ecological communities. Because ecozones are identified on the basis of their natural biophysical\nfeatures,whicharenotrelatedtothepoliticalboundariesofcountries,thesoutherlyecozonesofCanada\nextend into the neighbouring United States.\nSpecies may also have a transnational context. For example, the western red cedar (Thuja plicata)\noccurs in humid coastal forest throughout western North America, as does white pine (Pinus strobus)\nin the east. The grizzly (or brown) bear (Ursus arctos) is even more widespread\u2014its original range\nencompassed much of Eurasia and North America, in the latter extending from Arctic regions of\nnorthwestern Canada, through much of the western United States, to northern Mexico.\nManyanimalsaremigratory,undertakinglong-distancemovementsbetweentheirsummerandwinter\nranges.

The monarch is highly migratory in its\nNorthAmericanrange.Attheendofthegrowingseason,duringSeptemberandOctober,adultmonarchs\nundertake along migration to the south, where they spend the winter in one of two small areas.

The longest migrations are made by\nmonarchsthatwerebornineasternCanada\u2014theseintrepidbutterfliestravelthousandsofkilometresto\nreach their wintering roosts in Mexico.\nWhen spring comes, the overwintering monarchs begin a northward migration. When they find a\nsufficientabundanceofmilkweedplants(Asclepiasspp.),theonlyfoodeatenbythelarvae,thefemales\nlay about 400 eggs and die soon afterward. The larvae hatch, feed voraciously, metamorphose into\n154 | Chapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones adults after 20-45 days, and then continue the northward migration. After a breeding relay of three to\nfive generations, adult monarchs reach the northernmost parts of their range in Canada, where they\nbreedwherever milkweedis abundant.The last generation of the year, which transforms into adults in\nSeptember, is the one that undertakes the astonishing southward migration to the wintering roosts in\nMexico or California.\nThe conservation of the monarch butterfly is greatly complicated by its migratory habit, the use of\nvarious kinds of ecosystems at different times of the year, and the fact that all of its habitats must be\nconservedifthespeciesistosurvive.However,thegreatestconservationriskisthesurvivalofitsonly\n12winterroostsinMexico.Thesecriticalhabitatsareinnaturalforestofoyamelfir(Abiesreligiosa)that\nis threatened by deforestation, illegal logging, and tourism development.

These human-dominated ecosystems are anthropogenic in the sense that\ntheir characteristics are a consequence of environmental conditions associated with the activities of people.\nThe character of these ecosystems may be an intended result of management practices, as is the case of\nagroecosystemsinwhichcropsaregrown,orhorticulturalecosystemswheretheintentismoreaesthetic.Less-\ndeliberate anthropogenic influences, such as pollution and disturbance, also affect the character of human-\ndominated ecosystems, often by causing ecological damage.\nOf course, human-dominated ecosystems are prevalent wherever people are living in dense populations,\nsuch as in cities and towns. But they are also widely prevalent in the countryside where resource-extraction\nindustriessuchasforestryandminingareimportant,andintransportationcorridorsassociatedwithhighways\nand electricity-transmission lines. Because anthropogenic ecosystems are becoming so widespread, and they\nsupportrelativelyfewnativespecies,theyaretheleadingcauseofthebiodiversitycrisis,whichischaracterized\nby the extinction and endangerment of native species and even of kinds of natural ecosystems (see Chapter\n26). There is a great diversity of human-dominated ecosystems, but they can be aggregated into three major\ncategories: urban-industrial techno-ecosystems, rural techno-ecosystems, and agroecosystems.\nUrban-industrial techno-ecosystems are typical of urbanized areas and are dominated by the dwellings,\nbusinesses, factories, and other infrastructure of society (see Chapter 25). This anthropogenic biome supports\nmanyspeciesinadditiontohumans,buttheyaremostlyalienplantsandanimalsthathavebeenintroducedfrom\nother regions. Typically, the non-native species cannot live locally outside this biome (other than the foreign\nbiome to which they are indigenous).\nRural techno-ecosystems occur outside of urbanized areas and consist of the extensive technological\ninfrastructure of civilization. These ecosystems include rural transportation corridors (highways, railways, and\nelectricity-transmission corridors) as well as small towns supporting industries involved in the extraction and\nprocessing of natural resources. Rural techno-ecosystems support a blend of introduced species, plus those\nnative species that are tolerant of stresses associated with human activities.\nAgroecosystems are a complex of habitats that are managed to grow crops for use by humans. The most\nintensively managed kinds involve monocultures (single-species crops) of plants or animals that are cultivated\nin agriculture, aquaculture, or forestry. These valuable and necessary crops are grown under conditions that\nenhance their productivity, although intensive management systems may cause many ecological problems\n(see Chapter 24). Less-intensively managed agroecosystems may involve the cultivation of mixtures of species\n(polycultures),andtheymayprovidehabitatforsomenativespecies.Semi-naturalhabitatsusedforthegrazing\noflivestockalsosupportsomeindigenousbiodiversity.Whenaagroecosystemisabandoned,itslowlyrevertsto\namorenaturalcondition,althoughitcantakemanydecadesbeforethereareecologicalcommunitiesthatare\nsimilar to what was originally present, especially in forested regions.\nImage 8.11.

Alexandra Fiord: A High-Arctic Oasis\nAn important field of research in ecology involves undertaking integrated studies of particular\necosystems. Such work is carried out by teams of ecologists, geologists, meteorologists, and other\nenvironmental scientists. This sort of work allows scientists to understand the physical, chemical, and\nbiological factors that govern the structure and function of ecosystems and sustain their species.\nOne such project began in 1980, when a team of Canadian scientists working in the tundra biome\nbegan to study a place with a relatively moderate climate, known as a high-Arctic oasis. This one in\nparticularislocatedonalowlandadjacenttothecoastofAlexandraFiordoneasternEllesmereIsland.\nTheir objectives were to describe the plant and animal communities of the oasis and to determine the\nenvironmentalfactorsthatinfluenceitsbiodiversityandproductivity.Specificresearchtopicsincluded\nwork on the local and regional climate, geology, soils, distribution and species composition of plant\nChapter 8 ~ Biomes and Ecozones | 161 communities, ecological productivity, the life histories of prominent plant species, responses of\nvegetationtoexperimentalmanipulationsofenvironmentalconditions,andanimalpopulationsandtheir\nhabitat relationships.\nThis was a multidisciplinary research program, but because all the component studies were carried\noutinthesameplace,theirresultscouldbeintegratedtodevelopalargerpictureofthestructureand\nfunction ofthe oasis. This kind ofunderstanding is ofscientific importance because ecosystems in the\nArctic biome have not yet been well studied. The research also contributes to the knowledge required\nto assess the many kinds of ecological damage that are potentially associated with increasing resource\nexploitation, ecotourism, and climate change in the Arctic.\nTheteamatAlexandraFiordfoundthattheclimateofthelowlandisindeedmoremoderatethanthat\nofthelargerlandscape.Ingeneral,theairandsurfacetemperaturesarewarmer,soilmoistureisgreater,\nandthereislesswind.Itappearsthatdark-colouredcliffsonnearbyuplandsabsorbsolarradiationand\nthen re-radiate infrared energy that helps to warm the oasis, in a similar manner to how an oven is\nheatedbyitshot,enclosingwalls.Thelowlandisalsorelativelysheltered,soheat-dispersingwindsare\nlessvigorous.Inaddition,snowmeltwaterfromsurroundinguplandshelpstokeeplocalsoilsmoist,so\nwet meadows and other communities that depend on abundant moisture can develop.\nThemoderateenvironmentalconditionsallowthelowlandtosupportabundantvegetation,including\nlushwetmeadowsdominatedbysedgeandcottongrass.Thecommunitiesindrierplacesaredominated\nby dwarf shrubs and cushion plants, which are long-lived woody plants that grow no taller than 5 cm\nabovethesoilsurface.Theseincludeavens,bilberry,whiteheather,arcticwillow,andpurplesaxifrage.\nDisturbed habitats beside rivers and streams or near human habitations (the lowland contains an\nabandonedpostoftheRoyalCanadianMountedPolice)supportprofusefloweringsofherbaceousplants,\nsuch as arctic poppy and willow-herb.

For detailed\ninformation, visithttp://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/ecozones/ecozones.htm.\n3. Select any Canadian ecozone. What are the most important environmental factors affecting the species and\necological communities of that ecozone? Have these factors changed much over the past century or during\nthe past decade? For detailed information on the ecozone, visit the website noted in the previous question.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Why is it useful to know about the species of plants and animals that live in some defined area, such as a\npark, county, or province? Is it useful to know about the ecological communities? How does this kind of\ninformation assist in planning for conservation and sustainable development?\n2. Ecologists usually consider native species to have greater \u201cvalue\u201d than non-native ones. Why do they think\nthis way? Is the rationalization only scientific, or does it include an element of non-objectivity?\n3. Select any one of the more southerly Canadian ecozones, where human activities have become dominant\ninfluences affecting species and ecological communities. Describe any damage that you think human\nactivities might have caused to the native species and natural ecosystems of that ecozone, and consider\nwhether it might be possible to repair any of those effects.

Other environmental influences are stressors, or constraints on\nproductivity and reproductive success. Many stressors operate in a continuous (chronic) fashion, as is often\nthe case for climatic factors, soil and water pollution, and many biological interactions. Other stressors affect\norganisms and ecosystems as events of disturbance, which cause severe damage in a short period of time. A\ndisturbance is followed by an extended period of ecological recovery called succession. Disturbance may be\ncaused by natural forces such as a wildfire or windstorm, or by anthropogenic influences such as the clear-\ncutting of a forest or ploughing of a field.\nImage 9.1.

Acommunityis an assembly of populations of various species that co-exist and interact as a distinctive\ngrouping.\n5. Anecoscapeis a spatial integration of various kinds of communities over a large area.

Pinder\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 167 Individuals and Species\nAutecology is the field within ecology that deals with the study of individuals, populations, and species.\nImportant topics in autecology include the following:\n\u2022 differences among species in life-history characteristics and in adaptations to various kinds of\nenvironmental conditions\n\u2022 influences of the environment on individual organisms, including effects on their development and\nbehaviour\n\u2022 the causes of changes in the size and makeup of populations\nLife-History Characteristics\nEach species is unique and can be described by its anatomical, behavioural, biochemical, and ecological\nattributes.Thesecharacteristicsareultimatelydeterminedbythecollectivegeneticvariationthatexistsamong\nthe individuals that comprise the species.\nEach species is unique. Nevertheless, species can be aggregated into groups based on similarities of their\nattributes. These affinities may be due to ancestral relatedness, due to related species sharing aspects of\ntheir evolutionary history. For example, all maple trees (genus Acer) look rather alike and occur in habitats\nof temperate forest. Similarly, all members of the cat family (Felidae) bear a certain resemblance and are\necologically comparable in that all are predators, although of different prey and in different kinds of habitat.\nHowever, unrelated species may also display similar attributes, usually because they have had a history of\nanalogous changes through a phenomenon known as evolutionary convergence (or parallel evolution).\nConvergencesuggeststhat,throughnaturalselection,unrelatedspecieslivingincomparableenvironmentsmay\nevolve to resemble each other and to play similar functional roles in their ecosystem.\nThere are many examples of evolutionary convergence among unrelated groups of organisms. For instance,\nall perennial (long-lived) plants growing in arid environments have a need to conserve moisture. This critical\nfunction is enhanced by a growth form that includes adaptations to reduce water loss, such as a cylindrical\ntrunkandbranches,tissuesprotectedbyawaxycuticle,andnoleaves.Thorninessisanotherusefultraitinan\naridenvironmentbecausespinesdeterherbivoresfromconsumingbiomassandstoresofwater.Manydesert-\ninhabitingplantshavedevelopedoneormoreoftheseadaptations,includingspeciesofcacti(familyCactaceae),\neuphorbs (Euphorbiaceae), and succulents (Crassulaceae). Although species in these families are not closely\nrelated in an evolutionary sense, they may resemble each other because of evolutionary convergence.\nThere are also examples of convergence among species of animal. One is the similarities of the timber wolf\n(Canis lupus) of Eurasia and North America and the marsupial wolf (thylacine, Thylacinus cynocephalus) of\nAustralia. Another example is the groundhog (Marmota monax) of North America and the marsupial wombat\n(Vombatusursinus)ofAustralia.Also,thepenguins(familySpheniscidae)oftheSouthernHemispherearesimilar\nto the guillemots, murres, puffins, and related auks (family Alcidae) of the Northern Hemisphere.\nEcologists often categorize plant species on the basis of their autecology. One system is based on the\nadaptations of plants for coping with certain kinds of habitat conditions.

Any particular environment can be characterized by the importance of these two groups of\nfactors, which results in four basic kinds of habitat conditions:\n1. low stress and rare disturbance\n2. low stress but frequent disturbance\n3. intense stress but rare disturbance\n4. intense stress and frequent disturbance\nHowever,Grimesuggeststhatplantsexhibitonlythreeprimarylife-historystrategies,becausetheycannotcope\nwith an environment that is both stressful and frequently disturbed (4 above). The three primary life-history\nstrategies are:\n\u2022 Competitorplants are dominant in habitats in which disturbance is rare and environmental stresses are\nrelatively unimportant. Under such conditions, competition is the major selective influence on plant\nevolution and on the organization of their communities. Competitive plants are effective at acquiring\nresources and using them to achieve a dominant position in their community by interfering with the\nproductivity of other plants. Useful adaptations in competitors include rapid tall growth, a spreading\ncanopy, and a widely spreading root system\u2014these characters help to occupy space and take advantage of\nresources. In addition, seedlings of many competitive plants can establish themselves beneath a closed\ncanopy.\n\u2022 Ruderalsoccur in frequently disturbed environments with abundant resources, so stress is not great.\nRuderal plants are therefore well adapted to utilizing rich but temporary habitats. They are typically short-\nlived and intolerant of stress and competition. Ruderals produce large numbers of seeds, which usually\nhave mechanisms for long-distance dispersal so that newly disturbed habitats can be colonized.\n\u2022 Stress-toleratorsare adapted to environments that are marginal in terms of climate, moisture, or nutrient\nsupply, but are infrequently disturbed and therefore stable. They are typical of arctic, desert, and other\nstressful environments, and are generally short, slow-growing, and intolerant of competition.\nAnother system of categorizing organisms, more commonly applied to animals, involves two groups of life-\nhistorycharacteristics.Oneconsistsoflonger-livedorganismsthatproducerelativelyfewprogeny,butinvesta\nlotofresourcesineachtoimprovetheirchanceofsurvival.TheseareknownasK-selectedspecies.Theother\ngroup, referred to as r-selected, includes short-lived species that produce large numbers of small offspring,\neachofwhichhasarelativelysmallchanceofsurvival,butduetotheenormousnumbersitislikelythatsome\nwill persist. K-selected species are dominant in relatively stable, mature habitats in which competition is the\ncontrolling influence on community structure, while r-selected species occur in younger, recently disturbed\nhabitatsinwhichresourcesarefreelyavailableandrapidpopulationgrowthispossible.(Thesourceofthe\u201cK\u201d\nand\u201cr\u201dlabelscomesfromthelogisticequation,afundamentalelementofpopulationecologythat,forsimplicity,\nis not examined here.)\nSpecies can also be considered in terms of other aspects of their reproductive strategy, such as how often\nthey reproduce. Some species have only one reproductive event during their lifetime, usually dying afterward.\nThis type of reproduction, known as semelparous, is seen in annual and biennial plants, many insects and\notherinvertebrates,andPacificsalmon.Mostsemelparousspeciesareshort-lived,butsomecanliveformany\nyears,graduallyaccumulatingenoughenergytosustainamassive,\u201cbig-bang\u201dreproductiveeffort.Semelparous\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 169 reproductionisfavouredinrichhabitatsthatarefrequentlydisturbed,anditiscommonamongruderalandr-\nselected species.\nSpeciesthatreproduceanumberoftimesduringtheirlivesareknownasiteroparous.Thesearetypicallylong-\nlived species that live in stable habitats.

However, the expression of genetic information (the phenotype) is influenced by\nenvironmental conditions, a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. If individuals experience difficult\nenvironmentalconditions,thephenotypicexpressionoftheirgeneticpotentialmayincludeasuboptimalgrowth\nrate and the production of few or no progeny. In contrast, other individuals that live in a more benign\nenvironmentcanachievehigherproductivityandhavemanyoffspring.Thelatter,moreprolificcircumstanceis\nhighly desirable in terms of an individual achieving evolutionary \u201csuccess.\u201d By definition, successful individuals\nhave managed to maximize their fitness\u2014their genetic contribution to future generations.\nThesuccessofanindividualorganismisalsoaffectedbyunpredictabledisturbances,whichmayresultininjury\norprematuredeath.Eveniflivinginabenignenvironment,withgoodaccesstothenecessitiesoflife,anunlucky\nindividualmayjusthappentobescorchedbyawildfire,devouredbyapredator,debilitatedbyadisease,orhit\nby a truck.\nPopulation Ecology\nThe study of populations is another aspect of autecology. The abundance of all species changes over time in\nresponsetoenvironmentalfactorsthataffectfourpopulation-related(ordemographic)variables:birthrate(BR),\nimmigrationrate(IR),deathrate(DR),andemigrationrate(ER).Thechangeinpopulationsize(\u0394P)duringaunit\nof time (say, a year) is described using the following equation:\n\u0394P = BR \u2013 DR + IR \u2013 ER\nThis demographic relationship is true of all species, including humans. In some cases, isolated (or closed)\npopulations do not receive any immigration of new individuals and do not lose any to emigration. Under such\nconditions, \u0394P is calculated as BR \u2013 DR, a value known as the natural rate of population change.\nOften,\u0394Pisexpressedasapercentagechangebydividingitsvaluebytheinitialpopulationsize\u2013forinstance,\napopulationof100individualsthatincreasesby10inoneyearhasa10%annualgrowthrate.Ifthepercentage\nchange in a population is constant over time, there will be an accelerating rate of increase or decrease, called\nexponential change.\nImagineacircumstanceinwhichafertilepairofindividualsmanagestodiscoveranewsuitablehabitat\u2014one\nthathasnotbeenpreviouslyoccupiedbytheirspecies.Undersuchconditions,thefounderindividualswillbreed\nand the population will grow over time.

At or beyond the carrying capacity, opportunities are constrained by the limited availability of\nresources, and so individuals in the population must compete with each other. Intense competition results in\nphysiologicalstress,whichmaycauseadecreasetooccurinthebirthrateandanincreaseinthedeathrate.In\nsomecases,therateofpopulationincreasemaythendecreasetozero,whichoccurswhenthebirthrateequals\nthedeathrate.Thisconditionisreferredtoaszeropopulationgrowth(ZPG).IfZPGismaintained,thepopulation\nsizewilleventuallyleveloff,perhapsatalevelappropriatetothecarryingcapacityofthehabitat.Apopulation\ncurve of this type is referred to as \u201cS-shaped.\u201d\nHowever,theearlier exponentialgrowthmayhaveresultedinanabundancethatexceededwhatthehabitat\ncould support.

In\nsmall habitats, however, the crash can be massive enough to extirpate a local population.\nPopulation ecologists have developed mathematical models of population dynamics that account for the\ninfluences of such factors as the intrinsic rate of population increase, the carrying capacity of habitats, the\neffectsofpredationanddisease,andeventheeffectsofunpredictabledisturbances.Thesemodelsaredescribed\ninintroductorytextbooksofecologyandarenotdealtwithhereinanydetail.Forthepresentpurposes,there\nare several important points to understand about population ecology:\n\u2022 Populations of all species are dynamic. They change over time due to varying rates of birth, death,\nimmigration, and emigration.\n\u2022 Populations of all species can, potentially, increase rapidly under conditions in which resource availability\nand other factors are not constraining. Examples of rapid population growth are illustrated in Figure 9.1.\nHowever, unlimited growth cannot be sustained \u2013 in all of the cases in Figure 9.1, the population sizes\neventually levelled off, decreased, or crashed.\n\u2022 Ultimately, the sustainable abundance of a species is limited by the carrying capacity of the available\nhabitat. Examples of population growth that level off at the carrying capacity of the habitat are illustrated in\nFigure 9.2.\n\u2022 Some populations are relatively stable. Usually they exist in environments in which resource availability is\npredictable so that a balance can be achieved with the carrying capacity. For example, relatively little\nchange occurs in the year-to-year populations of trees growing in old-growth forest, unless a rare,\ncatastrophic disturbance occurs.\n\u2022 Other populations are relatively dynamic, changing greatly over time and rarely achieving even a short-\nterm balance with the carrying capacity of their habitat. This is commonly true of species living in habitats\nthat are disturbed frequently or are in an early, relatively dynamic stage of succession. Some populations\nare cyclic, achieving great abundances at regular intervals, interspersed by longer periods of lower\nabundance. Cyclic populations are obviously unstable over the short term, but they may be stable over the\nlong term.\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 171 \u2022 Populations that exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat are never sustainable at that high level,\nbecause of the environmental damage is caused. Unsustainable populations eventually crash to a smaller\nabundance and sometimes to extinction. Figure 9.3 shows an example of rapid population growth that\nresulted in habitat degradation and a subsequent population crash. Populations can also crash for other\nreasons, such as the sudden occurrence of a deadly disease. This is happening with the native white elm\n(Ulmus americana) of North America, which is being decimated by an introduced pathogen (the Dutch elm\ndisease fungus, Ceratocystis ulmi) to which this tree has little immunity. Other causes of population\ncrashes include unsustainable levels of predation and extensive disturbances such as wildfire or clear-\ncutting.\nFigure 9.1. Rapid Growth of Some Natural Populations.

Biological populations also grow in an exponential\nfashion if their rate of increase is constant.

The study of relationships among\nspecieswithincommunitiesisknownassynecology.Strictlyspeaking,acommunityconsistsofallplant,animal,\nand microbial populations occurring together on a site.\nThe Niche\nEach species within a community exploits the environment and interacts with other species in a particular\nmanner. Ecologists use the word niche to describe the role of a species in its community, which can also be\nviewedasits\u201coccupation\u201dorlivelihood.Somenichesarerelativelynarrowandspecialized,asisthenicheofbats\nthatfeedonlyonflyinginsectsofacertainsize,orwaspsthatpollinateonlyoneorafewspeciesofplants.Other\nniches,however,aremuchbroader,suchasthoseofbearsandhumans,bothofwhichforageoveranextremely\nbroad range and affect their ecosystem in diverse ways.\nThe so-called fundamental niche is determined by the range of a species\u2019 tolerance of environmental\nconditions. These tolerances are reflected in the ways that a species obtains its nutrition and how it interacts\nwithotherspecies,andtheyaremediatedbyaspectsofbehaviour,morphology,andphysiology.Incomparison,\nthe realized niche reflects the range of environmental conditions that a species actually manages to exploit\nin nature. The realized niche is smaller than the fundamental niche because all species are to some degree\nconstrained by biological interactions such as competition, predation, and disease.\nFunctional Communities\nBecauseoftheircomplexity,entirecommunitiesarerarelyexaminedbyecologists.Ecologicalstudiesareusually\nlimitedbytheamountsoffundingandbreadthofexpertiseavailable.Instead,community-levelresearchusually\ninvolvestheexamination ofselectedgroupsofsimilar organisms, suchas\u201ccommunities\u201d ofinsects,fish, birds,\nplants,ormicrobes.Althoughthescopeofsuchworkislimited,itdoesallowecologiststoinvestigateimportant\naspects of community ecology.\nForest communities, for example, contain a wide range of organisms of various species and sizes, including\nplants,animals,andmicroorganisms.Thepopulationsofthediversespeciesinteractinmyriadways.Trees,for\ninstance, provide the physical structure of the habitat, make food available for herbivores, and drop leaf litter\nthat is decomposed by species of the detrital food web. Other interactions within a forest community include\npredation,parasitism,anddisease,aswellassymbiosessuchaspollination,seeddispersal,androotmycorrhizae.\nBecause of the inherent complexity of forest communities, most ecological studies only investigate selected\ncomponents.\nThis pragmatic approach to community-level research can be illustrated by studies of the ecological effects\nofforestryconductedintheMaritimesbytheauthorandanumberofstudents.Todothisworkwedividedthe\nlarger community into the following functional groups:\n\u2022 trees, which we defined as woody plants with a diameter greater than 10 cm\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 175 \u2022 shrubs, with a diameter less than 10 cm but taller than 1 m, including shrub-sized young individuals of tree\nspecies as well as \u201ctrue\u201d shrubs\n\u2022 ground vegetation, including all plants, mosses, and lichens, growing within 1 m of the ground\n\u2022 epiphytes growing on other plants, such as lichens and mosses on the bark-covered surfaces of trees\n\u2022 small mammals such as mice, shrews, voles, and squirrels\n\u2022 large mammals such as deer, bear, and coyote\n\u2022 birds\n\u2022 reptiles and amphibians\n\u2022 insects\n\u2022 fungi and other microorganisms in the soil\nDuring some of the studies of birds, specific work was done with species that nest in cavities in trees. These\ncomprise a \u201ccavity-requiring\u201d element of the larger avian community. Similarly, work on insects and other\ninvertebrates hasinvolvedfunctional groups thatlivein soil, in rotting deadwood, oron foliage. Buteven with\nall of these (and other) functional groups, we did not manage to examine all of the elements of the forest\ncommunities that we were studying.\nFactors Influencing CommunitiesEcological communities are affected by various environmental factors,\nparticularly those described below.\nSpecies Present\u2013 Obviously, only those species that are present in a habitat, or are capable of dispersing\ninto it, can play a role in the community that develops. The ability of a species to colonize an available habitat\nis influenced by its biology, intervening barriers such as a mountain range or ocean, the disturbance regime,\nand other factors. Increasingly, humans are influencing the species composition of communities, often by\nintroducing non-indigenous species beyond their natural range.\nAppropriateHabitat\u2013Ifahabitatisunsuitable,thenaparticularspecieswillnotbeabletouseitevenifitis\ncapableofdispersingtothesite.Therearemanyaspectsofhabitatsuitability,andallofthemmustbesatisfied\nwithin the limits of tolerance of a species if it is to become a component of a community.\nBiologicalInteractions\u2013Speciesinteractthroughherbivory,predation,competition,disease,andsymbiosis,\nthe latter including mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. All of these interactions can influence the\npresence and abundance of species within communities. The following examples illustrate these influences.\nHerbivory\u2013occurswhenanimalsfeedonplantbiomass.Larvaeofthehemlocklooper(Lambdinafiscellaria)\nare voracious feeders on the foliage of spruce, fir, and other coniferous trees.

Species interact with each other in various ways, such as herbivory, predation, competition,\n176 | Chapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere disease, and symbiosis. This photo shows caribou (Rangifer tarandus) grazing in a tundra meadow\nin the Nunavik region of northern Quebec. Source: B. Freedman.\nCompetition\u2013 occurs when the biological demand for an ecological resource exceeds the supply, causing\norganisms to interfere with each other. Plants, for example, often compete for access to limited supplies of\nsunlight,water,nutrients,andspace.Animalsmaycompeteforfood,nestingsites,mates,andotherresources.\nIntraspecific competition occurs when individuals of the same species vie for access to resources, while\ninterspecificcompetitionoccursbetweenspecies.Ifaspeciesisparticularlyeffectiveatco-optingresourcesto\nitsownbenefit,itmaydisplaceotherspecies,aphenomenonknownascompetitivedisplacement(orinextreme\ncases, competitive exclusion). This affects the presence and relative abundance of species in the community.\nForexample,sugarmaple(Acersaccharum)isahighlycompetitivetreeinhardwoodforestsofeasternCanada.\nWhere environmental conditions are well suited for this species, it can dominate mature stands. If large sugar\nmapletreesareremovedfromastand,perhapsbyaselectivetimberharvest,othertreespecies(aswellassmall\nsugar maples) will benefit from the reduced competition and will grow more vigorously.\nDisease\u2013 is a pathological relationship in which the health of plants or animals suffers from an infestation\nof another species, usually a microbe. Virulent diseases can cause enormous changes in the composition of\necologicalcommunities.Intheearly1900s,theAmericanchestnut(Castaneadentata)wasafflictedbychestnut\nblight (Endothia parasitica), an introduced fungal pathogen.

This may involve an obligate\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 177 relationshipinwhichthesymbiontscannotliveapart,butmorecommonlytheassociationissomewhatflexible.\nSymbioses can greatly influence the performance of species in particular environments by improving their\ncompetitive ability and decreasing their vulnerability to predation, disease, or other stresses.\nThemaintypesofsymbiosisaremutualism,inwhichbothpartnersbenefit;parasitism,inwhichoneorganism\nbenefitsandtheotherisharmed;andcommensalism,inwhichoneorganismbenefitswithoutharmingtheother.\nWhilesymbiosesarecriticaltooneorbothpartners,theycanalsoindirectlyaffectthehabitatandtheresources\navailable to other members of the community.\nLichensareafamiliarexampleofamutualism.Theyareanobligateassociationbetweenafungusandeitheran\nalgaorablue-greenbacterium.Thefungusbenefitsfromtheproductivityofthephotosyntheticpartner,while\nthe latter gains a relatively moist microhabitat and improved access to inorganic nutrients.\nAnother mutualism, called a mycorrhiza, is an intimate association between fungi and the roots of vascular\nplants.Theplantbenefitsthroughenhancedaccesstonutrients,especiallyphosphate,whilethefungusreceives\nnutritious exudates from the roots. This mutualism also provides a broad, community-level benefit through\nincreased primary productivity. Many species of legumes live in a mutualism with the bacterium Rhizobium\njaponicum, which fixes nitrogen gas (N2) into ammonia, a critical nutrient.\nAnother mutualism involves species of dinoflagellates (single-celled algae) that live within corals (small,\ncolonial animals), where they receive protection and access to nutrients. The corals benefit through access to\nthe photosynthetic productivity of the algae.\nManyanimalseatplantbiomass,butfewareable,ontheirown,todigestcomplexpolymericbiochemicalssuch\nascelluloseandlignin.Consequently,manyherbivoresliveinamutualismwithmicroorganisms,whichinhabit\ntheir gut and secrete enzymes that digest cellulose and lignin, making those abundant sources of nutrition\navailabletotheanimal.Cows,deer,andsheephosttheirdigestion-aidingmicroorganismsinaspecializedpouch\noftheirfore-stomach,calledtherumen.Humansalsoharbouradiversecommunityofmicroorganismsintheir\ngut, many of which are important to our nutrition.\nOther mutualisms include the many species of flowers that are pollinated by particular kinds of insects.\nPollination is crucial to the reproductive success of plants, while the insects benefit from an abundant food\nsource of nectar or pollen. In addition, herbivores in the community benefit from the fruits that are produced\nbecause of pollination, and in turn they may help to disperse the plant seeds.\nAn example of commensalism is the epiphyte community of plants, lichens, and mosses that often grow on\nlarge trees.

Thus, taxonomists treat\n178 | Chapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere them as a single \u201cspecies.\u201d Source: B. Freedman.\nDisturbanceis an event of destruction of some part of a community, an occurrence that is followed by a\nsometimesprongedperiodofecologicalrecoverycalledsuccession.Allcommunitiesaredynamic,changingover\ntime in their species composition and functional attributes (such as productivity, decomposition, and nutrient\ncycling).However,therateofchangedependsonthestabilityofenvironmentalconditions,whichisgreatestin\ncommunities that are close to the end-point of a succession. In contrast, the most dynamic communities are\nassociated with the younger stages of succession. Disturbances can occur on two spatial scales.\n\u2022 Stand-replacing disturbancesare caused by wildfire, a disease epidemic, clear-cutting, and other\ncataclysmic events. This kind of disturbance is extensive and results in the immediate replacement of a\ncommunity with a different one, followed by a period of successional recovery. Over time, succession may\nregenerate a community similar to what existed before the disruption, or a different one may result. The\nyounger stages of a sere (successional sequence) are especially dynamic in terms of community change.\nDuring the initial years of recovery, competition is not intense, and ruderal, r-selected species dominate.\nLater stages of succession are much less dynamic, and K-selected species dominate.\n\u2022 Microdisturbancesare local disruptions that affect small areas within an otherwise intact community. A\nmicrodisturbance may, for instance, be associated with the death of an individual large tree, which results\nin a gap in the canopy, below which community change is relatively dynamic as species compete to take\nadvantage of the additional sunlight. Similarly, the death of an individual coral head represents a\nmicrodisturbance within a tropical reef community. Although ecological changes are dynamic within a gap\ncreated by a recent microdisturbance, at the stand level the community is relatively stable. Gap-phase\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 179 community dynamics occur in all ecosystems but are especially important during later stages of\nsuccession, such as in older-growth forests.\nImage 9.6.

This type of\nspatial change is reflected in gradual variations of communities because individual species have different\nbut overlapping tolerances and requirements of environmental conditions. These biological differences\nresult in overlaps of the distributions of species, which can make it difficult for ecologists to determine the\nlocations of boundaries (ecotones) between types of communities.\n\u2022 Rapid changes in environmental conditions occur at sharp boundaries between different kinds of soil or\nbedrock, at interfaces between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and in places affected by disturbance. The\nlatter influence can occur, for instance, between a burned and unburned tract of forest, or between an\necological reserve and its surrounding area, which may be affected by agriculture or forestry. Relatively\ndiscrete changes in environmental conditions favour large differences in community types, with distinct\nboundaries between them.\nLandscape Ecology\nLandscapes(orseascapesinthemarinecontext)areamosaicof\u201cpatches\u201d,eachofwhichrepresentsanecological\ncommunity. A landscape may contain various kinds of communities for the following reasons:\n\u2022 each community reflects particular environmental conditions, such as different soil or bedrock types or\nvariations of standing water (as in lakes, streams, or wetlands)\n\u2022 the communities represent various stages in succession, such as patches of different age after wildfire or\ninsect damage\n\u2022 the communities may be related to land-use, as when parts of landscapes are affected by urbanization,\nagriculture, forestry, roads, or other human influences.\nOver time, the spatial patterns of communities on landscapes are highly dynamic. This largely reflects the\ninfluence of disturbances and successional recovery. A patch that today is a pasture, a recent clear-cut, or a\nburn may be a mature forest after 50 years of succession. Similarly, a pond may in-fill over the centuries and\nbecomeawetland,whichwithfurthertimemaysucceedintoaforest.Ecologistsusetheterm\u201cshiftingmosaic\u201d\ntointegratethespatialandtemporalvariationsofcommunitiesonlandscapes.Thefollowingfactorsaffectthe\nshifting mosaic of communities.\n\u2022 Patch size relates to the area of particular stands of communities (a stand is a community in a specific\nplace). All species need some minimal area of habitat to support their populations, and small patches may\nnot be adequate for that purpose. Relatively small patches may, however, help to support a population living\nin several stands on the landscape (an extensive population of this sort is known as a metapopulation). This\ncan happen if the patches are connected by corridors to other suitable habitat, or if the species is capable\nof dispersing through surrounding inhospitable habitat (for this to occur, the landscape matrix must be\npermeable to movements of the species).\n\u2022 The amount of edge is important because it influences the length of ecotone (transitional) habitat\nassociated with a patch. A circular patch has the smallest ratio of edge to area, and smaller patches have\nhigher ratios than larger ones of the same shape. An ecotone between patch types is a particular kind of\nhabitat, and it may be selectively used by \u201cedge species.\u201d However, the greater the ratio of edge to area, the\nless \u201cinterior\u201d habitat there is (this is uninfluenced by ecological conditions associated with an ecotone).\n182 | Chapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere Ecologists have identified \u201cinterior species\u201d that are less successful if they try to use habitat close to an\nedge. Certain forest birds, for example, experience greater rates of predation and nest parasitism in small\nremnants of mature forest (see Chapter 26).\n\u2022 Connectedness refers to the presence of links between otherwise discrete patches of similar habitat. These\nlinks may be used by a species as corridors to move among patches, allowing their metapopulation to\nfunction on the landscape. As was noted previously, connectedness is also related to the ability of a species\nto disperse among habitable patches through the surrounding habitat.\n\u2022 Age-class adjacency is important in a landscape in which patches represent different stages of a\nsuccessional sequence. This commonly occurs in landscapes affected by disturbances such as wildfire,\ninsect epidemics, or clear-cutting. In general, patches of a similar post-disturbance age will be comparable\nin many aspects of habitat, while those of different age will be less similar. This can be an important\nconsideration for movements of species among isolated patches that are suitable as habitat.\n\u2022 Complex habitat requirements are characteristic of some larger animals, such as deer, bear, and wolf. These\nspecies need different kinds of habitat patches for specific purposes at various times of year. Because these\nanimals participate in various kinds of communities, all of the habitat patches they need must be present on\nthe landscape if a viable metapopulation is to be sustained.\n\u2022 Landscape-level biodiversity is related to the richness of community types over a large area (see Chapter 7).\nA landscape that is uniformly covered by a single community has less biodiversity at this scale than one\ncomposed of a rich and dynamic mosaic of different kinds of communities.\n\u2022 Landscape-level functions operate over extensive areas, and they may integrate the influences of many\nkinds of communities. A watershed, for example, is the expanse of terrain from which water drains into a\nstream, lake, or some other waterbody. Most watersheds contain various kinds of habitat patches, each\nwith particular influences on hydrology and water chemistry. In general, watersheds covered with mature\nforest yield the cleanest flows of water. Other environmental services provided by well-vegetated\nlandscapes include evapotranspiration, control of erosion, moderation of climatic extremes, and absorption\nof atmospheric carbon dioxide and release of oxygen.\nLandscapeecologyisanimportantsubjectareainenvironmentalscience.Humanscommonlyaffectindividual\nstands of particular kinds of communities, but many of the ecological effects must be managed at the scale of\nlandscapes and seascapes.\nImage9.7.Alandscapeisamosaicofvariouskindsofcommunities,eachstandofwhichrepresentapatch.\nIn addition, landscapes are subjected to patch dynamics associated with natural disturbances, such as\nwildfire, windstorms, and insect outbreaks.

Source: M. Sullivan.\nThe Biosphere\nThe biosphere consists of all life and ecosystems on Earth. It is bounded by the presence of living organisms,\nanditistheonlyplaceintheuniversedefinitelyknowntosupportlife.Ecologicalprocessesatthelevelofthe\nbiosphere include global climatic, oceanic, and atmospheric regimes (Chapter 3), the planetary energy budget\n(Chapter4),andglobalnutrientcycles(Chapter5).Thesebiosphericprocessesinfluencealllifeandecosystems.\nAt the same time, life and ecosystems also influence biosphere-level processes.\nIn fact, some scientists have suggested that there may be a degree of homeostatic control, or feedback,\nbetween the reciprocal influences of global ecosystems and their environment. A notion describing these\nbiosphere-environment relationships is known as the Gaia hypothesis, a controversial idea popularized by the\nscientist James Lovelock. He suggests that organisms and ecosystems have caused large changes to occur in\ncertain physical and chemical attributes of the global environment, and they have resulted in improvements\nin living conditions on the planet. The hypothesis envisions all of Earth\u2019s species and ecosystems as being a\nsort of \u201csuperorganism,\u201d which is called Gaia. According to Lovelock, Gaia attempts to optimize environmental\nconditionstowardenhancingitsownhealthandcontinuity,anditusesfeedbackmechanismstohelpmaintain\nconditionswithinarangethatlifecantolerate.TheancientGreeksbelievedthatGaia(orGaea)wastheprolific\nancestor of many of their most important gods. The Romans, who adopted many Greek gods and ideas, knew\nGaia as Terra. More recently, the Gaian myth has been personified as \u201cmother Earth.\u201d\nThe Gaian idea is attractive and interesting, largely because it integrates many ideas and large-scale\nobservations into a consolidated belief and world view. However, Earth is the only planet in the universe that\nis known to support life and ecosystems, and so it is the only known replicate in the great experiment of life.\n184 | Chapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis cannot be tested by rigorous experimentation, and for this reason many\nscientistsrejectitsinferences.Exceptinthebroadestofterms,Gaianideasmaynotbeusefulinhelpinghumans\nto manage the detrimental impacts of their increasing population and industrial activities on the biosphere.\nNevertheless,someintriguinglinesofevidencecanbemarshalledinsupportoftheGaiannotion.Twoexamples\nfollow.\nAtmospheric Oxygen\nEarth\u2019sprimordialatmospheredidnotcontainoxygen(O2).Thisgasappearedonlyafterthefirstphotosynthetic\norganisms, blue-green bacteria, evolved. These, and the somewhat later evolved green algae, give off O2as a\nwasteproductofphotosynthesis. Themodern concentrationofO2intheatmosphere,about21%,hasresulted\nentirely from photosynthesis and is a critical environmental factor for most species and many key ecological\nprocesses. It appears that the concentration of atmospheric O2has been fairly stable for several billions of\nyears. This suggests a long-term equilibrium between O2production by photoautotrophs and its consumption\nby respiration, including decomposition. Interestingly, if the concentration of oxygen were much higher than\n21%,say25%,thenbiomasswouldbemuchmorecombustible.Thisconditionwouldleadtomorefrequentand\nextensivewildfires,whichwouldseverelydamageterrestrialecosystems.Theseobservationscanbeinterpreted\nas suggesting the existence of a homeostatic control of the concentration of atmospheric O2, operating at the\nbiospheric scale.

If these changes were\nto exceed the biospheric limits of homeostatic tolerance and repair, the consequences for the planet\u2019s\ngeophysiology and ecology could be catastrophic.\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 185 Evolutionary Ecology\nEvolutionary ecology is a fusion of ecology and evolution \u2013 it involves the interpretation of ecological\nrelationshipsintermsofevolution,naturalselection,andrelatedthemes.Moreover,itacknowledgesthatspecies\nand their ecology have an evolutionary history that involves change over time, usually occurring as adaptive\nresponses toenvironmentalinfluences.Naturalselectionisaparticularlysignificantinfluenceonevolutionary\nchange, and it is evident in the regimes of environmental stressors and disturbances that affect the survival\nand reproductive success of organisms. Core subject areas in evolutionary ecology are the evolution of life-\nhistorytraits,ofrelationsbetweenspecies(suchasmutualism,parasitism,pollination,andpredatorandprey),\nandofcommunitiesandbiodiversityingeneral.Examplesoftheinterpretationofnatureintermsofevolutionary\necology include convergence and coevolution:\n\u2022 Convergence occurs when unrelated species occupy similar niches in distant but comparable\nenvironments. As a result they are subjected to parallel regimes of natural selection, and evolve to be\nsimilar in morphology and behaviour. An example noted earlier is the placental wolf (Canis lupus) of Eurasia\nand North America and the thylacine or marsupial wolf (Thylacinus cynocephalus) of Tasmania.\n\u2022 Coevolution occurs when species interact in ways that affect the survival or reproductive success, so that\nthey are subject to regimes of natural selection that result in integrated evolutionary change. The intensity\nof coevolution can, however, vary greatly. In extreme cases, it may lead to the evolution of an obligate\nmutualism, meaning that neither partner can survive without the other. Lichens are one example\u2014these are\nmutualisms between a fungus and an alga, neither of which can survive on its own.\nCoevolution also affects the feeding relationships of organisms. For example, milkweed plants (such as the\ncommonmilkweed,Asclepiassyriaca)haveevolvedtoproducehighconcentrationsofcardiacglycosides,which\nare distasteful and poisonous to most animals and help to protect the plants from being eaten. However, the\nmonarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) has evolved a tolerance to those biochemicals and so can eat milkweed\ntissues (in fact, their larvae eat nothing else). When this happens, the cardiac glycosides are incorporated into\ntissues of the monarchs, giving a measure of protection from being eaten by birds and other predators. The\ndefenceissoeffectivethattheunrelatedviceroybutterfly(Limenitisarchippus)hasevolvedacolourationand\nflight pattern that mimic those of the monarch, which helps deter its own predators.\nCoevolutionary interactions have also been studied between many plants and their pollinating insects.

There are three major subject areas:\n1. the management of renewable resources, such as those important in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry\nChapter 9 ~ Ecology: From Individuals to the Biosphere | 187 2. the prevention or repair of ecological damages, such as those related to endangered biodiversity, and the\nrestoration of degraded land or water\n3. the management of ecological processes, such as productivity, carbon storage, nutrient cycling, hydrology,\nand erosion\nLater chapters in this textbook contain many examples of the use of applied ecology to deal with problems of\nresourcemanagement,pollution,anddisturbance.Althoughthesubjectisnotdealtwithhereindetail,itcanbe\nbriefly illustrated by the following examples:\n\u2022 Setting Harvest Limits: The rate of forest productivity in a region can be estimated by measuring trees in\nplots that are re-sampled over the years, or by coring populations of trees and examining the annual ring-\nwidth of the recently grown wood. This information can be used to set limits on the amount of timber that\ncan be harvested without degrading the resource. Analogous methods of measuring productivity can be\nused to manage the sustainable harvesting of populations of mammals, birds, and fish.\n\u2022 Increasing Biological Productivity: Applied ecological research can determine whether the productivity of\nbiological resources can be increased\u2014for example, if forest growth could be enhanced by applying\nfertilizer, thinning dense stands, or establishing plantations. Research can also predict other implications of\nthese management practices, including effects on biodiversity and water quality.\n\u2022 Remediation, Reclamation, and Restoration: Ecologists can provide research-based advice for improving\nconditions in areas that have been degraded by pollution or disturbance. Various kinds of schemes can be\nused to deal with ecological damage:\n\u2022 Remediation involves actions that are undertaken to deal with a particular problem, such as liming lakes\nand rivers to decrease their acidity, planting tolerant plants in polluted environments, or undertaking\ncaptive breeding and release to increase the abundance of an endangered species.\n\u2022 Reclamation involves more comprehensive actions to establish a productive ecosystem on degraded land.\nFor example, an old landfill or a disused industrial site may be reclaimed to a permanent cover of\nvegetation, such as a pasture.\n\u2022 Restoration has a loftier goal of attempting to establish a self-maintaining facsimile of a natural ecosystem\non degraded land. For instance, the techniques of restoration ecology might be used to convert abandoned\nfarmland back to a native prairie or forest.\n\u2022 Offsets for Greenhouse Gases: Ecologists can predict the amount of forest that must be grown and\nprotected in order to offset industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. This can allow companies and\nnations to reduce their net emissions of CO2and to make progress toward meeting international\nagreements to deal with climate change.\n\u2022 Reducing Erosion: Some areas have been badly degraded by erosion caused by deforestation and other\nland-use changes. Ecologists can find ways to deal with this problem\u2014for example, by planting forests,\nusing terraced agricultural fields, or managing local hydrology to reduce overland or subsurface water\nflows.\nConclusions\nEcology is the study of the relationships of organisms with the environmental factors that provide the\nrequirementsoflifeandlivelihood.

Moreover, there is every indication that the present, extremely large\npopulation will continue to increase for at least another 50-100 years. Several possible scenarios of future\npopulation growth will be examined later in this chapter.\nTheenvironmentalconsequencesofanyhumanpopulationareafunctionofanumberofinteractingfactors,\nbut two are especially important: the number of people and their per-capita environmental impact.

This inference is based on the following\nobservations:\n\u2022 the population growth has been sustained over a long period of time\n\u2022 an extraordinarily large abundance has already been achieved\n\u2022 there has been a similarly impressive population growth of species that live in a close, mutualist\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 193 relationship with humans, such as cows, pigs, chickens, and agricultural plants, which have their own\ncumulative environmental impacts\n\u2022 a remarkable variety of species and ecosystems is being exploited as natural resources to support the\nhuman enterprise\nImage 10.1. The human population is growing rapidly and now numbers more than 7 billion. This scene\nshows an urban market in Hong Kong. Source: B. Freedman.\nIn large part, these phenomenal achievements of Homo sapiens have been realized through the profound\nbenefits of cultural evolution (or socio-cultural evolution). This term refers to the progression, throughout\nhuman history, of a series of adaptive discoveries of increasingly sophisticated tools and social systems. The\ncapacity of people to learn from the experience of others, including the transmission of knowledge from one\ngeneration to the next, has allowed cultural evolution to proceed. In turn, this adaptive process has allowed\npeople to become increasingly more efficient in the capture of natural resources by exploiting other species,\necosystems, and non-renewable materials (Chapter 12). Cultural evolution has allowed humans to achieve an\nunparalleled success in their domestication of planet Earth.\nUnfortunately,theremarkablegrowthofthehumaneconomy(whichrepresentsincreasesinbothpopulation\nand per-capita environmental impact) has also caused terrible damage to the biosphere. Much of this damage\nhas resulted in a large reduction in the carrying capacity for people and their enterprise. Moreover, natural\necosystems have been severely reduced in area, a change that is causing a massive loss of innumerable other\nspecies(seeChapter26).Initstotality,thisdamagealreadyrepresentsaglobalenvironmentalcrisis,anditisstill\nworsening. Regrettably, the impressive growth of the human enterprise through cultural evolution has largely\nbeen achieved by reducing the ability of the biosphere to support most other species and natural ecosystems.\nItisimportanttounderstandthattheincreasingsizeofthehumanpopulationisnot,onitsown,therootcause\noftheenvironmentalcrisis.Therapidescalationofper-capitaresourceuseandwasteproductionisatleastas\n194 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations important.Nevertheless,However,asustainableresolutionoftheenvironmentalcrisiscannotbeachievedifthe\nexplosive growth of the human population is not dealt with.\nInthischapterweexaminetheremarkablechangesthathaveoccurredintheabundanceofpeopleduringthe\npast10,000orsoyears,andhowculturalevolutionhasfurtherincreasedtheintensityofresourceuse.Wealso\nlookatpredictionsofpopulationchangeintothenearfuture.Globalpatternsofchangeareemphasizedinthis\nchapter; we will examine the population of Canada in Chapter 11.\nCultural Evolution and Carrying Capacity\nThebiologicalhistoryofhominids,includingAustralopithecusafricanus,extendstoperhaps4millionyears.The\ngenusHomogoesbackabout2millionyears;Homosapiens,theonlysurvivingspecies,isabout200,000years\nold.\nForalmostalloftheevolutionaryhistoryofourspecies,relativelysmallnumbersofpeoplewereengagedin\nsubsistence lifestyles \u2013 they foraged over large areas while hunting wild animals and gathering edible plants.\nThesepeopleroamedthelandscapeinsmallfamilygroups,searchingforfoodandothernecessitiesandusing\nsimpleweaponsandtoolsmadeofbone,stone,wood,andothernaturalmaterials.Thehunter\u2013gathererlifestyle\ncharacterizedthefirst95%orsoofhumanhistory,andduringthatlengthytimethepopulationofourspecies\nwas probably fewer than 1 million individuals.\nBysome12-15-thousandyearsago,peoplehaddiscoveredallofthemajorhabitablelandmasses,includingthe\nAmericas.Thelatterwerecolonizedrelativelylate,whensmallgroupsrovedeastwardacrossabroad(upto1000\nkmwide)buttemporarylandbridgethatconnectedSiberiaandAlaska,througharegionthatisnowtheAleutian\nIslands.

Descendants of those first colonists of the Americas spread quickly, in the manner of an\nexpanding wave, to occupy and exploit all habitable regions of North, Central, and South America. Occurring\nat the same time as the colonizing surge of people was a mass extinction of many species of large mammals\nand birds. It is likely that these unfortunate animals were naive to the lethal prowess of the novel two-legged\npredatorsthathuntedinwell-coordinatedpacks,andtheywereunabletoadapttotheonslaught(Chapters12\nand 26).\nCultural evolution has been a pervasive characteristic of our species, and there were many adaptive\ninnovationsofsocietyandtechnologyduringthelong-lastingprehistoricphaseofforagingsocieties.Thesewere\ncumulative advancements, meaning that each innovation built upon earlier ones and so the tools, practices,\nand social organizations got better and better. The innovations allowed natural resources to be exploited\nmore efficiently, and economies of increasing size and complexity to be supported. The key advances of these\nprehistorictimes,whichbecauseoftheirimmenseinfluencearesometimesreferredtoas\u201crevolutions\u201d(orgreat\nforward steps) of cultural evolution, include the following:\n\u2022 the invention and improvement of tools and weapons\n\u2022 discoveries of edible and medicinal species\n\u2022 the elaboration of language and other means of communication\n\u2022 the development of improved social organizations\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 195 \u2022 the mastery of fire\n\u2022 the domestication of the dog, which allowed hunting to be more efficient, provided a pack animal, and\nhelped keep encampments clean\nEach of these breakthroughs enhanced the ability of people to exploit natural resources.

Because crops must be tended\nandprotected,theadoptionofagriculturalpracticesmeantthatlifestyleshadtobemuchmoresedentary.The\neventual achievement of predictable food surpluses allowed some people to be supported as non-agricultural\nworkers living in villages. This social and economic change eventually fostered the development of city-states\nand then nation-states, along with their relatively sophisticated cultures and technologies.\nFigure 10.1. History of Population Growth.\nFor most of the history of Homo sapiens, the global population was several millions or less.

There were also many non-agricultural enhancements of the\ncarrying capacity, including the discoveries of the useful properties of metals and their alloys, which allowed\nthe manufacturing of tools and weapons that were far superior to those made of bone, stone, or wood. In\naddition,thedomesticationofbeastsofburdenandtheinventionofboatsandwheeledvehiclesmadeiteasier\nto transport large quantities of valuable commodities, which greatly stimulated trade.\nThis brief outline suggests that the cultural evolution of human socio-technological systems has involved a\nlongandcumulativeseriesofadaptivediscoveriesandinnovations.Eachofthemincreasedtheabilityofpeople\nto exploit the resources of their environment, which increased the effective carrying capacity and thereby\nfostered growth of the populations of people and their mutualist species, and of the overall human economy.\nAs a result of this adaptive progression, there were about 1-5 million people alive at the dawn of agriculture\nabout10-thousandyearsago,200\u2013300millionatthebeginningoftheCommonEra2000yearsago(0CE),and\n500 million in 1650.\nTherateofpopulationgrowththenbegantoincreasemarkedly,atrendthathasbeenmaintainedtopresent\ntimes. These recent, extremely rapid increases in the human population have occurred for several reasons. Of\nprimary importance have been the discoveries of increasingly effective processes and tools in sanitation and\nmedicine, which resulted in great decreases in death rates. Ways of preventing lethal communicable diseases\nhave been especially important in this respect.\nInaddition,recentlydiscoveredtechnologieshaveallowedforanincreasinglyeffectiveharvestingofnatural\nresources, the manufacturing of improved products, and greatly improved methods and infrastructure for\ntransportation and communications. These have been achieved as a result of the industrial revolution, which\nbegan in the mid-eighteenth century. Agricultural systems have also been greatly improved through the\ndevelopment of improved crop varieties and better methods of cultivation, which have resulted in substantial\nincreases of yield. Again, all of these progressions of cultural evolution have further increased the carrying\ncapacity of the environment for people.\nBetween8000BCEand1650CE,thehumanpopulationincreasedfromabout5millionto500million,withan\naveragedoublingtimeof1500yearsandagrowthrateof0.01%peryear(Figure10.2).Sincethenthepopulation\nhasincreasedgreatlyandthedoublingtimeshavebecomeless.Theglobalpopulationreached1billionin1850,2\nbillion in 1930, 4 billion in 1975, and 7.3 billion in 2015.\nFigure 10.2.

The quality of life has also been improved through improved\naccess to aesthetic resources and amenities, such as culture and recreation.

The additional\nwork has, however, reaped benefits of the sort noted above, and for much larger numbers of people.\nIt is important to understand that the many improvements in human security and lifestyle have involved a\ngreat intensification of the per-capita environmental impact. We can easily understand this important change\nby examining patterns of energy usage, which is a simple indicator of per-capita impact (Figure 10.3; see also\nChapter1).Comparedwithhunter-gatherers,peoplelivinginanadvancedtechnologicalsocietyuseatleast50\ntimes more energy, and their environmental impact is greater by a similar degree.\nFigure 10.3. Cultural Evolution and Energy Use. These data are estimates of the per-capita use of\nenergy by people engaged in various kinds of lifestyles. Energy use is presented here as a simple\nindicator of environmental impact.

Its\nsocioeconomic condition is partly due to legacies of its colonial history, including national boundaries that\noften make little sense in view of the distributions of tribal and language groups. In some countries, other\nfactorsalsodetractfromdevelopment,particularlyendemiccorruptioningovernmentandbusinessandstrife\nbetween tribes. In addition to those important problems, the increasing populations of African countries are\nalso making itextremelydifficult todealwithchronic poverty.Thepopulation ofcontinentalAfricawasabout\n224 million in 1950, 1,136 million in 2014, and an anticipated 2,428 million (or 2.43 billion) in 2060. With human\npopulations increasing so quickly, and the amounts of agricultural land and other resources remaining static\nor even declining because of over-exploitation, it will be a formidable challenge to avert social and ecological\ncatastrophes in many African countries. Resolving these problems will require both national fortitude and\ngenerous international assistance.\nTable10.1.RegionalPopulationGrowth.Datafor2025and2050areestimatedfromrecentdemographic\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 201 trends(i.e.,inratesofbirth,immigration,death,andemigration).Thenaturalrateofpopulationincrease\n(in2014,datainpercent)iscalculatedasbirthsminusdeaths,whilethetotalratealsoaccountsfornet\nmigration.

Population Growth in Selected Countries. Data are from World Resources Institute (2008)\n202 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations and Population Reference Bureau (2015).\nThere are, however, some anomalous situations whose dynamics are largely driven by the movements of large\nnumbers of refugees. For instance, Afghanistan had a population decrease of 1.8% per year during the period\n1980to1985(WRI,2008).Thiswasmostlybecauseadevastatingcivilwarkilledmanypeople,whileevenlarger\nnumbers fled to neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. In contrast, the population of Afghanistan increased by an\nextraordinary 6.9% per year during 1990\u20131995, largely because many refugees migrated back after a sporadic\nceasefire restored relative peace. Overall, the intrinsic rate of increase of the Afghani population has been\n2.7-3.5%peryear.In1950,thepopulationofAfghanistanwas8million.By2014ithadincreasedfour-foldto31\nmillion, and it is projected to reach 44 million by 2030 and 57 million by 2060.\nSomecountrieshavehadrecentpopulationgrowthevenmorerapidthanAfghanistan.InNigeria,forexample,\nthepopulationwas33millionin1950andisprojectedtoreach262millionin2030(aboutan8-foldincrease)and\n397millionin2060(12-fold).(Note,however,thatsuchpredictionsforNigeriaandsomeothercountriescould\nproveinaccuratebecauseofmortalityfromtheAIDSepidemicorsomeotherdisaster;seethelastsectionofthis\nchapterandGlobalFocus10.2).InIran,thepopulationincreasebetween1950and2030isprojectedtobeabout\n5-fold.

The challenges are daunting.\nThe countries with the most stable populations are mainly in Europe. The populations of most European\ncountries are growing at less than 0.5% per year, and the doubling times are longer than 100 years. As was\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 203 previouslynoted,theintrinsicratesofpopulationincreaseinCanadaandtheUnitedStatesaresimilartothese\nvalues, although because of substantial immigration, their populations are still growing at about 1% per year.\nFortunately, many countries are showing rapid decreases in their rate of population increase. China, for\nexample, had population growth rates exceeding 3% per year in the 1960s and 1970s, but this decreased\nto 0.5% per year in 2014. The slowdown is occurring because the government of China has recognized the\nacute problems associated with population growth, and so has developed policies to slow the increases and is\nimplementingtheminaneffectivemanner.However,China\u2019sgovernmenthasimposeditspopulationpolicywith\na determination that has sparked debates about human rights. Controversial measures have included coerced\nsterilizationandtheenforcementofaone-child-per-familyguideline,particularlyinurbanareas.Nonetheless,\nChina appears to be firmly on the road to rapidly decreasing its rate of population growth. We can only hope\nthisnecessaryactionhasoccurredintime.China\u2019spopulationin2050was555million,butthishadmorethan\ndoubledin2014to1.4billion,andevenwithitsaggressivepopulationpolicythiscouldstillincreasefurther.These\nare immense numbers of people to accommodate within the bounds of the landmass and natural resources of\nChina, which are not increasing in area or quantity.\nThe situations in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand are similar, although none of these\ncountries is experiencing declining rates of population growth as rapid as that of China. India, the world\u2019s\nsecond-most populous country, had 1.3 billion people in 2014, and may somehow have to support 1.5 billion in\n2030.Althoughallofthesecountrieshavestartedtodeveloppopulationpoliciesaimedatreducinggrowthrates,\nthey are not being implemented as effectively as in China.\nIngeneral,countriesthatareexperiencingthemostrapidpopulationgrowtharerelativelyundevelopedand\npoor,andtheyaretropicalorsubtropicalindistribution.However,notallpoorcountrieshavehighpopulation\ngrowth rates. The population growth rates of Cuba, for example, have been consistently less than 1% per year\nsince the 1950s. Although Cuba is relatively poor, almost all of its citizens are literate and its social system\nprovides ready access to housing, food, social security, and health care, including effective means of birth\ncontrol.\nIt can be broadly generalized that the wealth and state of development of nations correlate inversely with\ntheirpopulationgrowthrate.Nevertheless,anycountrywithanappropriateandeffectivelydeliveredpopulation\npolicycanachieveastrongmeasureofcontroloftherateatwhichitspopulationisincreasing.ThecaseofCuba\ndemonstrates this fact.\nTheexplosiveratesofpopulationincreaseinsomanypoorcountriesarestrainingtheecosystemsthatmust\nsomehowsustaintheburgeoningnumbersofpeopleandtheirlivelihoods.Thiscanbeillustratedbythecaseof\nSudan,innortheasternAfrica.ThepopulationofSudanwas2.9millionin1917,butithadirruptedto38million\nby2006,anincreaseof6.4times(OlssonandRapp,1991;WRI,2008)(anirruptionisarapidincrease).Because\nmost Sudanis are engaged in agricultural livelihoods, the populations of livestock also increased tremendously\nduringthatperiod.Thenumberofcattleincreased51-fold(to41million);camels,17-fold(to3.9million);sheep,\n39-fold(to50million);andgoats,35-fold(to43million).Theseenormousamountsofgrowthinthepopulations\nofpeopleandlivestockhavedegradedthecarryingcapacityofrangelandsinSudanandotherregionsofAfrica.\nAt the same time, terrible damage has been caused to natural ecosystems.\nIt must be remembered, however, that comparable rates of growth occurred in Europe and North America\nin previous centuries.

The large\nreductions of death rate are due to the benefits of improved sanitation, medicine, immunization, and social\nwelfare, along with widespread access to education (which, among other things, provides a widespread\nawareness of the benefits of sanitation and medicine).\nThelife-savingbenefitsofsanitation,immunization,andmedicineareparticularlyconsequentialforyounger\npeople, especially those less than five years old. This group tends to have the highest death rates under\n\u201cprimitive\u201dconditions.Otherrelativelyvulnerablegroupsthathavebenefitedincludetheelderlyandwomenin\nchildbirth. As well, large reductions in mortality from infectious diseases, such as bubonic plague, diphtheria,\ninfluenza, malaria, plague, smallpox, tuberculosis, and yellow fever, have been important in reducing mortality\nduring the past several centuries.\nHowever,thesemedicalandsocialbenefitshavenotbeensharedequallyamongcountries,oramongincome\ngroups within nations. For this reason, people living in less-developed countries, and poorer income groups\nwithincountries,typicallyhaveconsiderablyhigherdeathratesthandomore-developedorwealthierones.This\ntrend is readily apparent if data for death rates in poorer countries with increasing populations are compared\nwith those of wealthier countries having more stable populations (Table 10.4).\nComparedwiththerelativelylargedecreasesofdeathratesinallofcountriesandcultures,decreasesinbirth\nrateshavebeenmuchslower(Table10.3).Ingeneral,thewealthiest,mostdevelopedcountrieshaverelativelylow\nbirthrates,withratestypicallyabout10perthousand.Moreover,thesearealmostinbalancewithdeathrates,\nsothenaturalpopulationincreaseinthosecountriesisloworzero.Inlargepart,therelativelylowbirthratesof\nthewealthiercountrieshaveresultedfromtheemergenceofaculturalinclinationtohavesmallfamilies,which\ncan be achieved because there is ready access to safe and effective methods of birth control.\nTable 10.3. Demographic Information for Selected Countries. Note that the intrinsic rate of population\nchange is calculated as the birth rate minus the death rate. A difference of +10 units is equal to a\n1% increase per year. The fertility rate is the number of children born to an average woman over\nher lifetime. Life expectancy is the number of years lived from birth. Data are from World Resources\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 205 Institute (2008) and Population Reference Bureau (2015).\nChangesinculturalattitudesaboutfamilysizeappeartobeanaturaloutcomeofincreasingaffluenceandhealth\nas societies develop and become wealthier. Such cultural changes are critically important for dealing with the\npotentiallyexplosivepopulationgrowthofmoderntimes.Inasociologicalsense,however,itisnotexactlyknown\nhow these changes in attitude come about. In less-developed societies, children are often viewed as a source\nof inexpensive labour and providers of material comfort for their parents in old age. In contrast, in wealthier\nsocieties,childrenareconsideredtobesubstantialeconomicandsocialresponsibilitiesfortheirparents\u2013they\nareexpensiveconsumersofspace,education,energy,food,clothing,andothernecessities.Thiscontextprovides\na strong incentive for having a smaller family.\nAlthoughbirthrateshaverecentlybeendecreasing,theyareneverthelessquitehighinmostless-developed\ncountries. Because death rates have fallen considerably, their populations are growing rapidly (see Table 10.4).\nIn general, birth rates have remained high because of cultural preferences for larger families \u2013 this factor is\nstronglyinfluencedbyhighdeathratesinrecenthistory,particularlyofyoungchildren.Fiftyyearsago,afamily\nmighthavehadsixbirthedchildren,withonlythreesurvivingbecauseofahighrateofinfantmortality.Today,\nhowever, all six might survive. In addition, some religions influence birth rates because they promote large\nfamilies or strongly disapprove of modern methods of birth control. The social factors result in a lag in the\nculturaladjustmentofbirthratetooffsettherapiddeclinesinmortality.Theensuingimbalancehasresultedin\nthe rapid population growth that is occurring in almost all less-developed countries.\nHowever, the situation is not quite as simple as this. In many countries, the fertility rate is maintained at\na considerably higher level than many people, particularly women of childbearing age, might freely choose.\nThis happens because manywomen donot havesufficientaccess tosafeandeffectivemeans ofbirthcontrol.\nExceptionsarecountriessuchasChinaandCuba,andtoalesserdegreeBrazil,India,Indonesia,Korea,SriLanka,\nandThailand,allofwhicharesubstantiallyreducingtheirpopulationgrowthrates,mainlybyensuringthattheir\ncitizens have access to effective means of controlling their fertility.\n206 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations The Demographic Transition\nAlmostallofhumanhistoryhasbeencharacterizedbyrelativelyprimitivelivingconditions,andduringthattime\nthere was low or zero population growth (ZPG) because high death rates were balanced by high birth rates.\nDuringthepastseveralcenturies,however,manycountrieshavehadrapidpopulationgrowthbecausetherate\nof births exceeded that of deaths. More recently, during the past five decades or so, a condition of ZPG has\noccurredinrelatively\u201cdeveloped\u201dnationsandcultures,inwhichlowdeathratesarebalancedbylowbirthrates.\nThe so-called demographic transition refers to the transition of a population from a condition of high birth\nand death rates to another of low birth and death rates (Figure 10.5). It typically takes a rather long time,\nusually several generations, for a society to make it through this transition, and while that is happening the\npopulation increases at a high rate. The imbalance occurs because modern sanitation, immunization, and\nmedicine contribute to a rapid decrease of mortality, but that occurs without a simultaneous off-setting\ndecrease in birth rates. If, for example, the annual birth rate remained at 45 per thousand while the death\nrate declined to 11 per thousand, the population would grow at 3.4% per year. If that situation continued, the\npopulation would double in only 20years. These numbers are, by the way, actual demographic parameters for\nZambia in 2014, one of the least-developed countries in the world.\nFigure 10.5. The Demographic Transition. This illustration models the transition from a condition of\nhigh birth and death rates to one of low birth and death rates. Typically, the death rates decrease\nfaster than birth rates, and the corresponding imbalance has an explosive influence on population\ngrowth. Zero population growth occurs when birth and death rates offset each other. If the birth\nrate falls below the death rate, the population will decrease in size.\nNoculturespreferhighdeathrates,butsomedohaveapreferenceforlargerfamilies.Recenthistoryhasshown\nthatittakesoneortwogenerationstoovercomeculturalinclinationstowardhavinglargefamilies,andforbirth\nrates to decline to a level that is in balance with modern death rates.\nMany of the developed countries of today had the great fortune of passing through their demographic\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 207 transition during times when their populations were relatively small, and under circumstances in which their\n\u201csurplus\u201d people were able to migrate to other places. At the time, many European countries had a surfeit of\nlabourers because of mechanization associated with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, as well as the\nconsolidationofsmallfarmsintolargerones,whichalsodeprivedlargenumbersofpeoplefromemployment.To\nescapetheirpovertyanddimprospects,manypeoplechosetoemigratetocolonial\u201cfrontiers\u201dintheAmericas,\nAustralia, and elsewhere. Many countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New\nZealand, South Africa, the United States, and Venezuela, were then colonies of European nations. At the time,\nthese were considered to be \u201cunderpopulated\u201d places with bountiful resources, capable of assimilating a large\namount of immigration.\nIn actual fact, however, at the time of their European \u201cdiscovery\u201d these regions were already occupied by\nindigenous peoples. Nevertheless, in the socio-political context of the time (16th to 19th centuries), European\npowers seized ownership of many foreign regions, displaced or subjugated the original inhabitants, and\ncolonized the freed-up land through an immigration of poor or otherwise mobile citizens from the home\ncountries. To a substantial degree, the notion of under-population lingers today, particularly in Canada, the\nUnitedStates,andAustralia,whichstillallowrelativelyhighratesofimmigrationofpeoplefromothercountries.\nAsaresult,thepopulationgrowthratesinthosecountriessubstantiallyexceedwhatwouldbeexpectedbased\non birth and death rates, which are almost in balance and reflect passage through the demographic transition.\nInrecentcenturies,immigrantsfromagreatmanycountrieshaveswelledthepopulationsofCanadaandthe\nUnitedStates.Forexample,atthetimeofthefirstUnitedStatescensus,in1790,thatcountryhadapopulation\nof 4 million.

This aspect of population structure\ndiffers greatly between populations that are growing or stable, and there are important implications for their\nfuture growth.\nPopulations that have been stable for some time have similar proportions of people in various age classes\n(Figure 10.8). In other words, there are roughly comparable numbers of people aged 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25\nyears,andsoon.Thisequitabledistributionholdsformostage-classes,exceptfortheelderly,whoalwayshave\nahigherriskofmortality.Thiskindofage-classdistributionistypicalofrelativelydevelopedcountriesthathave\nmade it through their demographic transition.\nFigure10.8.Age-ClassStructureoftheGlobalPopulation.Comparetheage-classstructuresofarelatively\nyoung,rapidlygrowingpopulation(theless-developedworld,in2010)withastablepopulation(developed\n212 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations countries).

In fact, almost half of the people in a rapidly\ngrowingpopulationaretypicallylessthan15yearsold(Table10.5).Thiskindofpopulationstructuresuggestsan\nenormous potential for future growth as increasingly larger numbers of young people mature to reproductive\nage. This kind of age-class distribution is typical of less-developed countries that have not passed through a\ndemographic transition.\nTable 10.5. Age Structure of the Populations of Selected Countries in 2014. Data from Population\nReference Bureau (2015).\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 213 The growth potential of populations with a triangular age structure is an important demographic fact. It is\ndifficult for populations to stop growing quickly because of this age-class inertia, and it usually takes several\ngenerationstopassthroughthedemographictransition.Forexample,a\u201cyoung\u201dpopulation(havingatriangular\nage-class structure) might rapidly achieve a replacement fertility rate, at which the number of progeny would\nonly replace their parents (this is equivalent to about 2.1 children per family, which is slightly more than 2 per\nfamilytoaccountforthefactthatsomepeopleareinfertile).Nevertheless,apopulationwithatriangularage-\nclassstructurewouldcontinuetogrowforsometime,althoughataprogressivelyslowingrateofincrease.This\nhappens because, for several decades, increasingly larger numbers of people mature to a reproductive age, a\ncircumstancethatisrelatedtotheinitial,triangularage-classstructureofthepopulation.Eventually,however,\nthereplacementfertilityratewouldbringaboutastableage-classstructure,thedemographictransitionwould\nbe achieved, and there would be zero population growth.\nSince1979,thegovernmentofChinahasenforceda\u201cone-childpolicy\u201dformostfamiliesinthecountry,whichis\nafertilityratethatisconsiderablysmallerthanthatwhichwouldreplacethenumbersofparents(about2.1).This\npolicyismostlyenforcedinurbanareas,andethnicminoritiesareexemptfromit.Familiesthataresubjectedto\ntheone-childpolicymayexperienceintensesocialpressuretonothavemorethanonechildandtherearealso\nsubstantialeconomicdisincentivessuchasfinesandpooreducationalopportunitiesforsecondchildren.Many\nparents have been sterilized against their will.\nIn addition, there is a cultural preference in China for male children because of the prevailing system of\ninheritance of family lineage and property by the first-born son.

Because populations are growing most quickly\nin those less-developed countries, this pattern of the global distribution of people will become even more\npronounced over time (see Figure 10.7). The rapidly growing populations in those countries present enormous\nchallengestotheirgovernments,internationalagencies(suchastheUnitedNationsaswellasnon-governmental\norganizations),andmorebroadly,thesustainabilityoftheglobalhumansocietyandeconomy.Eventoday,many\nof the great masses of poor people in less-developed countries do not have access to equitable livelihoods,\nor even to acceptable standards of food, shelter, education, health care, and other necessities, not to mention\nthe cultural and entertainment amenities that help to make life a worthwhile experience. Faced with rapidly\nincreasingpopulations,willthesepoorcountriesbeabletodobetterinthefuture?Willwealthiercountriesbe\nwilling to help them to the degree that is necessary?\nUrbanization(thedevelopmentofcitiesandtowns)isacriticalaspectofpopulationdistribution.Allcountries\nare urbanizing rapidly, and in fact, urbanization is occurring more rapidly than population growth. Increasing\nurbanization is being driven by a number of interacting factors, the most important of which is the migration\nofpoorruralpeopletotownsandcitiesinsearchofemployment,services,andculturalamenities.Onaverage,\naboutthree-quartersofthepopulationofdevelopedcountriesarenowlivinginurbanenvironments,compared\nwith one-third of people in the less-developed parts of the world. By 2025, it is expected that the urban\npopulation will double to more than 5 billion and 90% of that increase will be in developing countries. Global\nurbanization represents an extraordinary change in the distribution of people, compared with the essentially\nagrarian societies of only one century ago, when more than 95% of people lived in rural areas.\nThe greatest metropolitan areas in the world are known as megacities (having >10 million inhabitants) or\nas urban agglomerations (large contiguous urban areas). Most of the largest ones are located in developing\ncountries (Table 10.6), a trend that will increase in the future. Note that in the year 1950, the only megacity in\ntheworldwasNewYork.Thisfacthighlightsthefactthaturbanizationoftheglobalpopulationduringthepast\nseveral centuries is an extremely important aspect of human history.\nTable 10.6. Megacities. These are the largest urban agglomerations in the world, of which 33 existed\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 215 in 2014. Data are for 2014 (Demographia, 2014).\nOf course, urban people live under densely crowded conditions, and their livelihoods tend to involve work in\nmanufacturing,government,financialinstitutions,commerce,education,andservices(seealsoChapter25).In\naddition, many urban people depend on social assistance. No cities are self-sufficient in food, energy, or raw\nmaterials for building and manufacturing, and few have enough potable water. Urban areas depend on trade\nwith the surrounding countryside and with foreign nations to provide these necessities of life and economy.\nUrbanareasalsogenerateenormousquantitiesofwastematerials,muchofwhichisdisposedofinnearbyrural\nareas.Thedevelopmentandmaintenanceofthecomplexeconomic,physical,andsocialinfrastructuresrequired\nto care for enormous numbers of urban people is an extraordinary challenge for governments, especially in\nrelatively poor countries.\nBirth Control\nMany individual people and families make conscious choices about their reproduction, including how many\nchildren to have. Historically, the available methods of controlling pregnancy were few, unreliable, and\nsometimes unsafe.\n216 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations One of the most effective methods of birth control is the avoidance of sexual intercourse before marriage\n(or before a non-married spousal partnership). This is because society generally accepts that matrimony is\na social institution involving a commitment by both parents to care for their children. Avoidance of sexual\nintercourse affectspopulation-levelbirthratesbydelayingandspacing reproduction.Acomplementaryeffect\nis gained by delaying marriage until relatively late in life, which if accompanied by pre-marital chastity, also\ndelaysreproductionanddecreasesbirthrates.Coitusinterruptus,orwithdrawalofthepenispriortoejaculation,\nlikewise contributes to lower rates of impregnation associated with copulation. This practice has been widely\nused throughout history. In addition, breast-feeding mothers have a lower probability of conceiving another\nchild, so delaying the weaning of children also helps to space births.\nSome birth control practices have long been used, even by hunter-gatherer and early agricultural cultures,\nparticularly when they had to deal with resource crises such as insufficient food. These practices include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 the use of traditional medicines to prevent conception or to induce abortion\n\u2022 infibulation, or the insertion of pebbles or other objects into the uterus, where they may be retained for\nyears, and prevent the implantation of fertilized ova\n\u2022 the use of mechanical means of inducing abortion\n\u2022 infanticide, or the killing of newborn infants\n\u2022 use of means to raise the temperature within the scrotum, such as wearing a warming pouch, which\ninhibits sperm production and reduces fertility of the male\nThe Polynesian culture inhabits islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

These courageous,\nextremely risky dispersals allowed some of the population surplus to discover new ecological opportunities,\nalthough many unfortunate people must have perished at sea.\nToday, people have access to a diversity of methods of birth control that are safer and more effective than\nmostofthoseavailableinthepast(seeInDetail10.1).Consequently,individualsandfamiliesinmanycountries\ncannowchoosefromarangeofsafeandreadilyavailablemethodsofbirthcontroltocontroltheirreproduction.\nHowever, the use of birth control raises questions beyond issues that are purely medical and scientific,\nincludingmanyrelatedtoreligion,ethics,andphilosophy.Forexample,becauseofbeliefsregardingthesanctity\nofhumanprocreation,theCatholicChurchopposesalmostallmethodsofcontrolofconceptionandbirth.Sodo\nmost fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, and Muslim denominations.\nInCanadaandtheUnitedStates,themostcontentiousmethodofbirthcontrolisabortion.Ontheonehand,\nanti-abortionists(alsoknownas\u201cpro-life\u201dactivists)contendthatabortionviolatesthesanctityoflifeandshould\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 217 never be permitted. On the other hand, pro-abortion activists (also known as \u201cpro-choice\u201d) argue that a fetus\nis not a viable life and that each woman living in a free and democratic society should have the right to make\ndecisions regarding her own body and reproduction. The acrimonious debate over abortion has erupted in\nboth legal and illegal demonstrations, including the picketing of clinics and hospitals. Unlawful acts have been\ncommitted by radical fringe elements from both sides of the issue, including a few cases of extremists who\noppose abortion committing arson and even the murder of physicians and other medical personnel.\nIn Detail 10.1.

From the perspective of\nenvironmentalstudies,thepopulationproblemsofless-developedanddevelopedcountriesarequitedifferentin\nterms of their characteristics and prospects for effective action through the implementation of a policy.\nLess-Developed Countries\nAswaspreviouslyexamined,less-developedcountriesarerelativelypoorandhavenotprogressedfarinterms\nof industrial and socio-economic development.

When they were going through their own\ndemographic transition some 100-200 years ago, the presently developed countries exported much of their\nsurplus population to colonies in the Americas and elsewhere. This option is not available to less-developed\ncountries today. National population policies in less-developed countries must focus on reducing birth rates\nas quickly as possible so that population growth can be arrested and hopefully even reversed (this is negative\npopulation growth, or NPG). Ideally, this would be achieved by educating the populace about the social and\neconomic benefits of smaller families, so that individuals and families would make appropriate choices about\nreproductiveplanningandthenumberofchildrentohave.Also,ideally,therewouldbereadyaccesstosafeand\neffective means of birth control in support of this kind of enlightened population-level initiative.\nIn addition, because people who are better off are more inclined to have smaller families, a more equitable\ndistribution of wealth in less-developed countries would contribute greatly to achieving the necessary\npopulationgoals.Forasimilarreason,manypeopleandagencies(suchastheUnitedNationsPopulationFund)\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 219 support the idea of a transfer of some wealth from developed to less-developed countries. This could include\nboth direct transfers of wealth and relief of much of the foreign-held debt loads of poorer countries.\nAn effective but less desirable alternative to these sorts of population policies involves coercive initiatives\nin family planning, such as social and/or economic disincentives to having more than one or two children\nper family. Forcing people to use family-planning practices infringes on their human rights, even if there are\nlong-term social and environmental benefits. Consequently, coercion presents a social and ethical dilemma\nfor governments. Such actions may, however, prove to be necessary if free choices do not result in sufficient\nreductions of population growth.\nThere is also, of course, another alternative, which is easily implemented by all societies and governments.\nInsteadofdesigningandadoptingeffectivepopulationpolicies,governmentscoulddolittletoreducebirthrates,\ntherebyallowingpopulationstocontinuetorapidlygrow.Thiswouldintensifythesevereenvironmentaldamage\nalreadybeingcausedinmostless-developedcountries,whichwouldfurtherdecreasethecarryingcapacityfor\npeople, their economy, and other species. The population and resource crises would then eventually resolve\nthemselves in a natural, biological fashion, as would happen for any species. There would be a catastrophic\nincrease in the death rate \u2013 a crash of the population.\nImage10.3.Comparedwithpeoplelivinginwealthycountries,theinhabitantsofless-developedcountries\nuse much smaller amounts of material and energy resources. Therefore, on a per-capita basis, the\nenvironmental impacts of poorer people are relatively small. This family is engaged in subsistence\nagriculture in West Papua (Western New Guinea), Indonesia. Image: Bill Freedman.\n220 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations Developed Countries\nDeveloped countries are relatively wealthy, and their average citizens have access to desirable lifestyles\ncompared to the typical conditions in less-developed countries. Moreover, most developed countries have\npassedthroughtheirdemographictransitionorhavesubstantiallydoneso.Consequently,theirnaturalrateof\npopulation growth is relatively slow.\nProgress through the demographic transition requires the maturation of new cultural attitudes about\nappropriatefamilysizeandaccess toeffectivemeans ofcontrolling reproduction. As such, population policies\nindevelopedcountriestendtoensurethatpeoplearesympathetictosmall-familygoalsandthattheyhaveeasy\naccess to means of birth control.\nA major issue concerning the population policies of developed countries is the rate of immigration to allow.\nThere are huge numbers of poor people living in less-developed countries who would happily migrate to\nwealthier ones in search of better economic, lifestyle, and social opportunities. In fact, many economists and\npoliticians believe that this kind of immigration should be encouraged. They believe that it is desirable for\ndevelopedcountriestohaveagrowingpopulation,whichwouldbeanincreasingmarketplaceforsaleablegoods\nwhile providing an abundant source of inexpensive labour.

As was examined in Chapter 1, people who are living a resource-rich lifestyle\ncause agreater intensityofper-capitaenvironmental damage than do typical people in poorer countries.

Under unsanitary conditions, humans and rats may live in close proximity, which can allow\nrat-fleas to bite people and spread bubonic plague.

In fact, many HIV-positive people in less-developed countries\ndo not even know that they are HIV-positive. Fortunately, this situation in less-developed countries is\nimprovingduetoassistanceprogramsoriginatinginmore-developedones.Intotal,about13millionHIV-\npositive people had access to antiretroviral therapy in 2013, compared with 5 million in 2009.\nSome countries in Africa have been hit especially hard by AIDS. Botswana is one of the worst-hit\ncountries,with23%ofadultsbeingHIV-positivein2013.AIDS-relatedmortalitywillhaveanenormous\neffect on life expectancy in that country, which in 2012 was 47 years, compared with 65 years in the\nabsence of AIDS. The huge increase in mortality has enormous implications for social and economic\nconditions in that country, as is the case of all heavily afflicted countries.\nAIDS is a terrible illness that is devastating for afflicted people and their families, and it is already\ncontributingtoslowingtherateofincreaseofthehumanpopulation.Nevertheless,thismedicalcalamity\ndoes not mean that world governments no longer need to develop and implement rational population\npolicies. The human population is still expected to grow substantially from its present huge size. Like\npopulation growth, the AIDS epidemic is only partially recognized by most governments, and like\npopulation growth, it can be dealt with if appropriate policies are developed and effective actions are\ntaken.\nFamine\nThespecteroffaminehasbeenpresentthroughouthumanhistory.Afaminescanbecausedbyvariousfactors,\nincludinganinsectoutbreak,insufficientrainfallcausingdrought,excessiveprecipitationcausingflooding,and\nwarfareandothersocio-politicalupheavals.Ancienthistoricalrecordsarefullofdescriptionsofdeadlyfamines\nin many societies. Some of the most catastrophic famines of pre-twentieth-century Asia and Europe killed\nhundreds of thousands of people.\nHowever, much greater famines have occurred since the beginning of the twentieth century. For example,\nas many as 5-10 million people may have starved in the Soviet Union during 1932-1934 as a combined result\nof drought and social upheaval associated with the forced collectivization of private farms by the communist\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 223 government.AnotherfamineinWestBengalin1943killed2-4millionpeople.Morerecentfamineshaveoccurred\ninvariouspartsofAfricaandAsia,usuallycausedbyacropfailureduetodroughtandotherextremesofweather,\nand often aggravated by the chaos of war or revolution.\nOverpopulation exacerbates most factors that contribute to famine. In general, a region or country is\nvulnerable to famine under the following conditions:\n\u2022 the population is large and dense\n\u2022 there are only small reserves of stored food\n\u2022 the environmental conditions for agriculture are marginal, partly because population pressure has led to\nland being cultivated in semi-arid regions that are susceptible to drought\n\u2022 there is little foreign exchange to purchase food from elsewhere during times of shortage, so people and\ngovernments must rely on goodwill and aid\n\u2022 the economic and political systems do not foster the stable governments and social systems that are\nrequired for effectively dealing with crisis\nEnvironmental Issues 10.1. Controversy over Population Policies, Family Planning, and Birth Control\nAny objective consideration of national and global environmental problems would have to conclude\nthat the rapidly increasing population of humans is a key issue \u2013 in general, more people means an\naccelerating depletion of natural resources, as well as more pollution and damage to biodiversity. Of\ncourse,itisnotassimpleasthisbecauseenvironmentaldamageisalsogreatlyaffectedbythelifestyles\nthatpeoplelead,whichinfluencestheirper-capitauseofresources,generationofwastes,andeffectson\nthe natural world.\nInspiteoftheobviousimportanceofactionstoreducetherateofpopulationincrease,thereismuch\ncontroversy over policies related to family planning and birth control. A population policy is a strategy\nthatisdesignedandimplementedbyagovernmentinordertoinfluencegrowthofthenumbersofpeople\nandotherdemographicfactors,suchastheagedistribution.Forexample,herearesomekeyelementsof\nprovincial or national population policies in Canada:\n\u2022 encouraging immigration (which has more than double the influence on population growth in\nCanada than does natural increase; see Chapter 11)\n\u2022 in particular, encouraging the immigration of younger persons, who have a relatively long lifespan\nwithin the working economy and so would help to offset the increased \u201caging\u201d of the general\npopulation\n\u2022 having more babies \u2013 various jurisdictions have enacted pro-natalist policies to encourage larger\nfamily sizes, such as financial subsidies and relief from income tax\n\u2022 ensuring that Canadians have easy access to safe and effective measures of birth control, which\nallows people to make choices about their reproduction and family size\nHowever, no Canadian government has ever indicated what it considers to be a \u201cdesirable\u201d size of the\npopulation. In fact, there is a general apprehension among politicians that our regional and national\npopulationsmustkeepgrowinginordertoincreasethesizeofthelabourforceandtheeconomy,which\nareviewedasbeinginherently\u201cgood\u201dresultsfromasocietalperspective.Althoughthispro-growthview\nhasnotyetgeneratedmuchcontroversy,itisarguablethattheworlddoesnotneedincreasingnumbers\nof people living such environmentally intensive lifestyles as those of typical Canadians.\nIn many other countries, however, national leaders view an increasing population as being a clear\nthreattothesustainabilityoftheireconomyandtootherenvironmentalconcerns.Chinaisonesuchcase\n224 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations \u2013itspopulationwas0.55billionin1950andgrewto1.364billionin2014,thelargestofanycountry(Table\n10.3).Because the Governmentof China is acutely aware of the economic and environmental risks that\nare associated with rapidly increasing numbers of people, it has enacted a relatively strong population\npolicy. That policy is substantially founded on allowing people to have easy access to a wide range of\neffective means of birth control, including abortion, as well as only allowing one child per family (the\nlatter policy began in 1979). This strategy is showing signs of success, and the national population is\nexpected to peak at around 1.4 billion in 2030, and to then have a moderate decline to 1.3 billion in 2060.\nHowever,theone-childpolicyisintenselycontroversialbecauseitdeniestherightofpeopletochoose\ntheir familysize.Moreover,those who havemorethan one child maybesubjectedtostrong economic\norsocialpenalties,suchasafineorrestrictedaccesstoschooling,andinearlyyearsofimplementation\nof the policy there were cases of coerced abortion or sterilization \u2013 all of these consequences may be\nviewed as being contrary to basic human rights.

In many other countries, however, other means of family planning are also\ncontroversial \u2013 in some cases, only abstinence is considered acceptable. This is particularly the case\nof countries or social communities in which fundamentalist religious views have a powerful influence\non public attitudes and governmental policies, including nations in which the dominant religions are\nfundamentalistversionsofChristianity,Hinduism,Islam,orJudaism.Thissocialcircumstancecouldalso\nberegardedasdisregardingcertainbasicrights,suchasthatofawomantocontrolherownbodyand\nfertility,andthatofafamilytoplanitssize.Therearevaryingrationalesfortherestrictionofaccessto\nmeans of birth control in these sorts of countries or communities. In essence, they involve ideas such\nas natural population increase being mandated by God, while birth control is not, and they are further\ncomplicatedbythenotionthatalargepopulationsomehowtransmutesintoincreasednationalpoweror\ninfluence.\nIt is clear that controversies over population policies, family planning, and birth control are not fully\nresolvable\u2013theyareasocietaldilemma.Fromtheenvironmentalperspective,itiscrucialthatthehuman\npopulationbelimitedtoasizethatcanbesustainedbythecapacityofthebiospheretoprovideresources\nand assimilate wastes, while also respecting the need to conserve a viable natural world. This goal of\nsustainability can only be achieved if people have easy access to effective means of controlling their\nreproduction, and in many cases, the existing policies and laws are in conflict with those sorts of free\nchoices.\nDecline of Carrying Capacity\nEnvironmentalcatastrophistssuggestthattherecouldbeacollapseintheecologicalcarryingcapacityforthe\nextremelylargehumanpopulation.Ifthatweretohappen,widespreadstarvationwouldfollow.Itisalreadyclear\nthat some potentially renewable resources have been exhausted by over-harvesting and that stocks of non-\nrenewable ones are being rapidly depleted (Chapters 12, 13, and 14). Compelling evidence of this phenomenon\ncomes from collapsing fish stocks, deforestation, desertification, depleted groundwater, degradation of\nagriculturalsoil,anddiminishingstocksoffossilfuelsandmetals.Largedeclinesofnaturalresourcesareaclear\nsignal of a decrease in the carrying capacity of the biosphere for the human enterprise.\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 225 A Nuclear Holocaust\nEnormousnumbersofpeoplehavediedprematurelythroughthedirectandindirectconsequencesofwarfare.\nThemostlethalconflictsweretheFirstWorldWar,whichkilledasmanyas20millionpeople,andtheSecond\nWorld War, during which at least 38 million died (Freedman, 1995).

There are precedents for such a rare\nevent,withclearevidencefromthegeologicalrecord(Chapter3).Forinstance,itappearsthatabout65million\nyearsago,Earthmayhavebeenstruckbyameteorite,anaccidentthatcausedenormousenvironmentalchange\nand resulted in a mass-extinction event (Chapters 6 and 26). Fortunately, cosmic calamities of such a colossal\nintensity are exceedingly rare, occurring only every 25-30 million years or so. It is much more likely that any\ncrashthatmightoccurinthehumanpopulationwouldbecausedbyavirulentdiseaseoracollapseofcarrying\ncapacity, rather than by a big-bang cataclysm from a meteorite strike.\nConclusions\nThehumanpopulationhasbeengrowingexponentiallyinrecentcenturies.Additionalgrowthwilloccurinthe\nforeseeable future, but at decreasing rates. Demographic models suggest that the population will eventually\nstabilize, but this may happen at a level at least 50% larger than the more than 6 billion people alive today.\nAccompanying the growth of the human population has been an even more rapid increase in per-capita\nenvironmental impact. In combination, these have changed the biosphere on a scale and intensity that is\ncomparable to the effects of such enormous geological events as full-blown glaciation. The damage includes\ndeforestation, depletion of all kinds of natural resources, pollution, and mass extinction. It is clearly apparent\nthatthecumulative,anthropogenicimpactsontheenvironmentwillescalateevenfurtherwithincreasesinthe\nabundance of people.\nA key to decreasing the growth of the human population is to get less-developed countries through their\ndemographic transition, which requires reducing birth rates to a level that balances already low death rates.\nIf this is to happen, a widespread cultural change in favour of smaller families will have to occur, or else\n226 | Chapter 10 ~ Global Populations governments will have to coerce people to have fewer children. In either case, it will be necessary to provide\nwidespread access to safe and effective means of birth control for all people, but particularly women.\nTheenormousgrowthofthehumanpopulationmustbekeptinmindwheneverenvironmentalproblemsare\nconsidered.Tosomedegree,theenvironmentaleffectsofpeopleandtheireconomiescanbeavoidedorrepaired\nby technological strategies such as pollution control and the conservation of natural resources. However, the\nsize of the human population remains a root cause of the ecological damage caused by our species.\nQuestions for Review\n1. What are major stages of cultural evolution? How do they relate to changes in carrying capacity and growth\nof the human population?\n2. Explain the demographic transition. Compare its dynamics in developed and less-developed countries.\n3. Why is age-class structure so important in future growth of a population?\n4. Describe possible reasons why the human population will eventually level off or decrease.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. What is the recent pattern of growth of the human population? Discuss possible scenarios for future\ngrowth.\n2. Compare demographic parameters and population growth rates in developed and less-developed\ncountries. What social and economic factors explain the differences?\n3. What are the major means of birth control? Discuss controversies associated with their use.\n4. What is the likelihood of a human population crash? What are the potential causes?\n5. Why is HIV/AIDS more prevalent in poorer countries than in wealthier ones?\nExploring Issues\n1. The government of a less-developed country has asked for your help in designing a population policy. You\nwill visit the country for several months to get an appreciation of the socio-economic and environmental\nproblems that exist and to help you understand cultural influences on the design of a population policy.\nWhat kinds of studies would you want to make during your visit? What key elements would you\nrecommend for the population policy?\n2. The personal choice to use birth control can be difficult and is further complicated by considerations about\nthe various methods that are available. Make a list of the key ethical, social, and economic issues associated\nwith any three methods of birth control (you can select them from In Detail 10.1). Consider both the\npersonal dimensions of choice (personal ethics and views) as well as those relevant to society at large (such\nas group pressure, whether a particular method is legal, and the ease of access to particular methods).\nChapter 10 ~ Global Populations | 227 References Cited and Further Reading\nAnderson, B.A. 2014.

They did not, however, find unpopulated lands. In fact, all of\nthe Americas were fully occupied by various indigenous or Aboriginal cultures (consisting of First Nations\nor Amerindians, plus the northern Inuit). At the end of the fifteenth century, at the time of the voyages of\nChristopherColumbusandJohnCabot,theindigenouspeoplesoftheAmericashadanestimatedpopulationof\nabout 35 million people. About 30 million of these people lived in South and Central America, and 5 million in\nNorth America.\nSome of the First Nations had developed advanced cultures and economies, particularly the Aztecs and\nMaya of Central America and the Inca of South America. These people built elaborate cities that contained\ngreat pyramids and other impressive buildings. Their nations were supported by complex physical and social\ninfrastructures. Like cities everywhere, those of the more advanced Amerindian societies relied on the\nsurrounding agricultural landscape to supply food, water, and other resources. Furthermore, taxes were\ncollectedfrompeoplelivingintheproducingregionstosupporttherulers,administrators,soldiers,andartisans\nwho were living in the urbanized centers.\nTheFirstNationsculturesinwhatisnowCanadawerediverse,comprising12languagegroups,someofwhich\nhadmanydialects.Someofthecultures,suchastheHuronandIroquoisoftheeasterntemperatewoodlands,\nwereessentiallyagrariansocieties.Thesepeoplesupplementedtheiragriculturallivelihoodbyforagingforuseful\nwild plants and by hunting deer, birds, fish, and other animals.

The most important causes of this calamitous mortality were infectious diseases, particularly\nmeasles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenzas. Europeans were relatively tolerant of these diseases that they\nbrought to the Americas, but the indigenous peoples were extremely vulnerable. Epidemiologists refer to\npopulationsthatarehypersensitivetoinfectiousdiseasesas\u201cvirginfields\u201d.Suchpopulationscansufferintense\nmortality from introduced diseases (known as virgin-field epidemics).\nIn addition, huge numbers of Aboriginal peoples died as a direct and indirect result of conflicts associated\nwith the European conquest.

For example, the rapacious 19th-\ncentury slaughter of the great bison herds was partly a stratagem to deprive the Plains First Nations of their\ncrucial resource base.\nIn1500,therewereabout300,000indigenouspeopleinCanada,apopulationthatsubsequentlycollapsedto\nperhaps 60,000. The Aboriginal nations of Canada now number about 1.4 million people whose self-identified\nancestry is First Nation (or Indian; 852-thousand), M\u00e9tis (452-thousand), or Inuit (60-thousand) (2011 data;\nStatistics Canada, 2012).\nEarly European Immigration\nThe initial wave of Europeans coming to Canada were mostly French and British adventurers seeking furs,\nfish,timber,agriculturalland,trade,andcoloniallands.ComparedwiththeirEuropeanhomelands,whicheven\nthen were relatively densely populated, Canada represented a great frontier to these colonists, replete with\nboundlessopportunitiestodeveloplivelihoodsandmakemoney.Thefactthattheselandswerealreadyoccupied\nbyAboriginalculturesdidnotmattermuchtotheEuropeancolonistsbecausethedominantworldviewsofthe\ntimewereaggressiveandimperialist.Thesebeliefsservedtolegitimizethedisplacementofindigenouspeoples\nby the technologically empowered Europeans.\nSlowlyoverthefirstcenturyorso,andthenasagreatfloodofimmigration,colonistscametoCanadafrom\nFranceandBritain,andlaterfrommanyothercountries.Today,thepopulationisanamalgamderivedfromarich\ndiversity of immigrants from virtually all parts of the world, plus descendants of the original Aboriginal cultures.\nBetween1500and1700,thepopulationoftheNorthAmericancontinentincreasedtoabout6millionpeople.\nThis included about 1 million black slaves, who had been brought unwillingly from Africa to the southeastern\ncolonies to work on plantations. Under laws of the time, slaves were the human property of their \u201cowners,\u201d\nChapter 11 ~ The Canadian Population | 233 having no personal freedom and few rights. Although people in the northern colonies had few slaves, they did\nemploy large numbers of indentured servants, mostly of European origin, who were bound to their employers\nbycontractsanddebtsthatinmanycaseswereimpossibletopayoff.Thosedifficultobligationswerenotmuch\nremoved from slavery.\nFollowingthisinitialphaseofcolonization,thepaceofimmigrationmarkedlyquickened.Dataarenotavailable\nfor the entire period, but between 1820 and 1930 at least 50 million persons of European birth migrated to\ncoloniesandformercoloniesaroundtheworld,butparticularlytotheAmericas.Thisimmensehumandispersal\ninvolved about one-fifth of the population of Europe during the period. The mass migration was stimulated\nby a combination of factors: rapid population growth in Europe, a shortage of arable land there, famine in\nIreland and other countries, and rivalries among the imperial powers to develop empires and dominate world\ntrade.Inaddition,somereligiousandethnicminoritieswereheavilypersecutedinEuropeancountries,andthis\npersuaded many of those oppressed peoples to emigrate to North America or elsewhere.\nAs was noted in Chapter 10, this great 19th and 20th-century dispersal was a critical factor in allowing\nEuropean countries to have a relatively easy passage through their demographic transitions.\nCanadian Focus 11.1.

In the early 1600s, there were about 500 French colonists in the region known as New\nFrance.In1663,afterahalf-centuryoftentativecolonization,acensusreported3,215peopleofFrench\norigin in Quebec, while another in 1671 found about 400 in Acadia. Most were single men who had\njourneyedtotheCanadianfrontierassoldiers,aspriestshopingtoconvertindigenouspeopletoRoman\nCatholicism, as government administrators, or as adventurers seeking their fortune through the fur\ntrade.\nInthefollowingdecade,thepaceofcolonizationquickenedmarkedlybecauseofrenewedsponsorship\nby the French government. Many families of settlers arrived from France, intent on developing\nagricultureinthefertilelowlandsofAcadiaandalongtheSt.LawrenceRiver.Theimmigrationofsingle\nwomenwasalsoencouragedtooffsetasubstantialdeficitoffemalesinNewFrance.Manyoftheseyoung\nwomenwererecruitedfromParisianorphanagesandwereknownaslesfillesduroi.In1673,therewere\nabout 6700 Francophones in New France.\nImmigration then greatly slowed because royal sponsorship of emigrants ended and there were also\n234 | Chapter 11 ~ The Canadian Population dwindling prospects for finding work in the colonies.

After 1759, all the growth\nof the French-Canadian population was due to the natural excess of births over mortality, while much\nof the growth of the non-francophone population was due to immigration. By 1815, the francophone\npopulationofQuebecwas269,000(therewerealsoabout60,000Britishcolonists),andin1885,itwas1.18\nmillion(plus250,000non-Francophones).Duringthenineteenthcentury,theaveragenumberofbirths\nin Catholic families in Quebec was about seven (this refers to all Catholics, but the great majority of\nthemwereFrench).Thishighfecundityistypicalofpopulations atthebeginning oftheirdemographic\ntransition.Itshouldbepointedout,however,thathighfecunditywasnotuniquetoQuebec\u2013itwasalso\ntypical of areas elsewhere in Canada, including Ontario.\nIn1926,therewereabout3millionFrancophonesinQuebec,elsewhereinCanada,andintheUnited\nStates.AlmostallofthesepeopleweredescendantsoftheoriginalfewhundredemigrantsfromFrance.\nAt the present time, there are about 6.8 million French Canadians.

This period of relatively high fecundity was due to social\noptimism following the end of the Second World War.

Since the early 1970s there has been a substantial increase in the numbers\nof immigrants. Between 1972 and 1991, an annual average of 144,000 people immigrated to Canada. This was\nfollowed by an increase to 243,000 per year during 1996\u20132001 and 250,000 during 2002-2014.\nSince the mid-1980s, net immigration has contributed about half of Canada\u2019s population growth rate (the\nrestisduetonaturalgrowth;Figure11.3).Ifsustained,the0.98%peryearrateofincreaseof2010\u20132014would\nresultinthepopulationdoublinginonly72years.ThisrateofpopulationgrowthissimilartothatoftheUnited\nStates and Australia, which are also relatively wealthy countries with small natural rates of population growth\nbut substantial rates of immigration.

Data for the low-, medium, and high-growth models are from\nStatistics Canada (2014b).\nPopulation Structure\nThe age structure of the Canadian population is illustrated in Figure 11.5. In general, the pattern is typical\nof a population that has progressed most of the way through its demographic transition. Note, however, the\nanomalous bulge of numbers that corresponds to the baby boomers. Fecundity dropped in Canada after the\nbabyboom,andoncethisbulgehasworkeditswaythroughthepopulationstructure,theagedistributionwill\nassume a more uniformly vertical shape. As the baby boomers age and retire from work, they are expected to\nexert significant strain on Canada\u2019s capacity for providing social and medical care for its elderly citizens.\nAlthough Canada has a population structure characteristic of a country that has almost completed its\ndemographic transition, the growth rate remains relatively high, at about 1% per year. Much of the population\ngrowth is due to immigration. Although this factor is not related to age-class structure, it is notable that\nrelatively young people of childbearing age are prominent among immigrants to Canada. This adds further\nmomentum to population growth.\nChapter 11 ~ The Canadian Population | 239 Figure11.5.AgeStructureoftheCanadianPopulationin2014.Thisdiagramshowstherelativenumbers\nof people by age. The demographic \u201cbump\u201d of people peaking at about 55 years old corresponds to\na period of high birth rates that occurred in the post-war 1940s to early 1960s, known as the baby\nboom.

Data from\nStatistics Canada (1997, 2014i).\n244 | Chapter 11 ~ The Canadian Population Population Policy\nMost government planners, politicians, and leaders in business do not consider Canada to be overpopulated.\nIn fact, they more typically believe that Canada is underpopulated and capable of comfortably absorbing\nconsiderable growth of its population. This view is debatable in view of the relatively intensive lifestyles of\nCanadians (which is typical of people living in developed countries) and the correspondingly large per-capita\nenvironmental impact. Nevertheless, continuing the population-growth paradigm is the predominant way of\nthinkingamongdecisionmakersinCanadiangovernmentsandbusinesses.Consequently,Canadaanditsregions\ndo not have well-developed population policies, other than those that establish targets and guidelines for the\nnumbers and types of immigrants that will be allowed into the country.\nIn addition, Canadian governments have not encouraged other countries to develop their own population\npolicies,especiallythosethatareless-developedandhaverapidlygrowingpopulations.Canadiangovernments\nalso do not provide significant aid to those poorer countries to help them increase the availability of birth\ncontrol. By not becoming involved in the population problems of less-developed countries, our governments\navoid potentially high-profile controversy. However, this attitude contributes little to dealing with the global\nincrease of the human population.\nGovernmentswithinCanadaalsolackpoliciestoencouragetheircitizenstohavesmallerfamiliesasameans\nofslowingthegrowthofnationalorregionalpopulations.Infact,Canadiangovernmentsmoretypicallypursue\npolicies that are pro-natalist. This has been true of the government of Quebec, which in recent times has\nprovided cash payments to women based on the number of children they have, and had provided daycare at\ngreatly subsidized costs to parents. In addition, all provinces and the federal government provide substantial\nincome-tax breaks to parents based on the number of children they are supporting. These tax benefits are\nintended to help lower-income families with the costs of child-rearing, but they can be interpreted as a pro-\nnatalist aspect of the income-tax system.\nImage 11.2.

The\ncontroversyhasresultedinmanypublicdemonstrationsandconfrontationsbetweenpro-life(anti-abortion)and\npro-choice (pro-abortion) groups. In a few instances, the patrons and personnel of abortion clinics have been\nillegally harassed or assaulted, and clinics have even been firebombed. In the 1990s, there were three cases of\ndoctors who had provided abortion services being shot (in Ancaster, Vancouver, and Winnipeg), and in 2000\nanother was stabbed at his clinic (Vancouver).\nNevertheless,althoughabortionandothermeansofbirthcontrolremaincontroversialissues,Canadianswho\ndesiretocontrolthenumberandspacingoftheirchildrendohaverelativelyeasyandinexpensiveaccesstosafe\nandeffectivemeansofbirthcontrol.WhilemostCanadianstakeresponsibleadvantageofthisopportunity,itis\nnotcomparablyavailabletomostpeopleintheworld.Consequently,thenaturalrateofpopulationincreasein\nCanada is relatively small, while it is high in almost all poorer countries.\nMoreover,immigrationisakeycontributortopopulationgrowthinCanada.Itiswellknownthat,otherthan\ndescendants of its original Aboriginal peoples, Canada is almost entirely populated by immigrants and their\noffspring(accountingforabout97%ofthetotalpopulation).Canadahasalwayshadarelativelyopenimmigration\npolicy,andthiscontinuestoday.In2013,Canadaadmitted259-thousandimmigrants(permanentresidents)from\nmorethan200countries,including24-thousandrefugees,equivalenttoabout0.8%ofthenationalpopulation\n(CitizenshipandImmigrationCanada,2014).ThetopsourcecountriesofimmigrantswerethePhilippines(14%),\nChina(12%),andIndia(10%).TheoverallpopulationgrowthofCanadaisabout1%peryear,andnetimmigration\naccountsforabout60%ofthatgrowth.Ifnotforitsrathervigorousimmigrationrate,Canadawouldbecloseto\na ZPG (zero population growth) condition.\nThere has always been some controversy over the immigration and refugee policies of Canada, as is true of\nallcountries.Newcomershavecontributedenormouslytotheeconomicdevelopmentandculturaldiversityof\nCanada\u2013theyhavehelpedtomakethecountryaninterestingandprosperousplacetolive.Thesebenefitsmust,\nhowever,bebalancedagainstsomeofthedownsidesofcontinuingtohaverelativelyopenimmigrationpolicies,\nbecauseoftheircontributiontorapidpopulationgrowth.Itisobviousthatanypopulationpolicytoreducethe\nrate of population growth in Canada must deal with the numbers of immigrants that the country accepts.\nCanadian Focus 11.3. Birth Control and the Issue of Abortion.\nThe key reason for the growth of the human population has been a precipitous reduction of mortality\nrates, due to great improvements in sanitation and medical science. The most desirable way to slow\npopulation growth is to reduce the birth rate \u2013 it would never be acceptable to increase the death\nrate! Various family-planning options are available (see Chapter 10), including abstinence, the use of\nwaystopreventconception(birth-controlpills,condoms,diaphragms,intrauterinedevices),sterilization\n(vasectomyofthemaleortuballigation ofthefemale),andtermination ofapregnancybyabortion.

Such images also\nrevealthatbeyondEarthanditsatmosphereistheimmense,blackvoidofspace\u2013anextremelydilute,universal\nmatrix. If we divert our attention from this compelling image of spaceship Earth and focus instead on the\nunimaginably larger abyss of space, we cannot fail to be stirred by the utter isolation of our lonely planet, the\nonly place in the cosmos that is known to sustain life and ecosystems.\nWith such a lucid image of Earth in mind, it is not difficult to understand that the resources necessary to\nsustain life are limited to those already contained on the planet. That is, with one critical exception \u2013 the\nelectromagneticradiationthatiscontinuouslyemittedbytheSun.Atinyfractionofthatsolarenergyirradiates\nEarth,warmstheplanet,anddrivesphotosynthesis.Withtheexceptionofsunlight,however,Earth\u2019sresources\nare entirely self-contained and finite.\nIt is an undeniable reality that all organisms must have continuous access to resources obtained from their\nenvironment. Plants and algae, for example, require sunlight and inorganic nutrients, while animals and\nheterotrophic microbes must feed on the living or dead biomass of other organisms. Because their organisms\nmust be nourished by environmental capital, the concept can also be extended to ecosystems in their totality.\nThenecessaryresourcesmustbeavailableinatleasttheminimalamountsneededtosustainlife,andinlarger\nquantities in ecosystems that are increasing in biomass and complexity, as occurs during succession.\nThe same reality holds for individual humans, our societies, and our economic systems. All people and their\nenterprises are subsidized by the harvesting of resources from the environment (including those taken from\necosystems). These necessities must be available in the minimal amounts needed to sustain human life, and in\nmuchlargerquantitiesineconomicsystemsthataregrowingovertime.Anobviousconclusionisthateconomic\nand ecological systems are inextricably linked. Indeed, this is an undeniable fact.\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 253 Themainconnectionsbetweeneconomicsystemsandthenaturalworldinvolveflowsofresourcesfromthe\nenvironment (including ecosystems) into the human economy, and offsetting flows of disused materials, by-\nproducts, and heat (these are sometimes referred to as wastes) from the economy back to the environment.\nAssociated with these interchanges of materials and energy are many kinds of damage caused to natural and\nmanagedecosystems.Thedamagesmaybecausedbydisturbancesassociatedwithharvestingnaturalresources,\nbyemissionsofpollutants,andbyotherstressorsrelatedtoanthropogenicactivities,especiallythoseoccurring\nin heavily industrialized economies.\nAn ultimate goal of environmental studies to understand how the use of natural resources and changes\nin environmental conditions are related to a sustainable economic system and to the quality of human life.\nUltimately, a sustainable economy is one that runs forever, and that operates without a net consumption of\nnatural capital \u2013 the rates of resource use are equal to or smaller than the rates at which the resources\nare regenerated or recycled. This definition focuses on the resource-related aspects of sustainability. Also\nimportant, however, are environmental damages that may be caused by the extraction and management of\nnaturalresources.Thesocialcontextmustalsobeconsidered,particularlythewaysthatwealthissharedamong\nthe people who are participating in an economy.\nIn this chapter, we examine the broader issues relatedto the use of natural resources in economic systems.\nInitially,weexaminethecharacteristicsofnon-renewableandrenewableresources.Non-renewableresources\nare finite, do not regenerate, and therefore are diminished by use. In contrast, renewable resources can\nregenerate and may be managed to maintain or increase their productivity, and we describe practices that\nfosterthosegoals.Thisisfollowedbyaninvestigationofthereasonsforacatastrophicbutremarkablycommon\nphenomenon \u2013 the depletion of potentially renewable resources through excessive use. Finally, we consider\nthe notion of sustainability, a topic that is critically important to the long-term health of both economic and\necological systems. This chapter deals with natural resources in a conceptual manner; Chapters 13 and 14\ninvestigate the actual use of resources in the international and Canadian economies.\nNatural Resources\nAll natural resources (also known as natural capital) can be divided into two categories: non-renewable and\nrenewable.\nNon-Renewables\nNon-renewable resources are present in a finite quantity and do not regenerate after they are harvested\nand used. Consequently, as non-renewable resources are used, their remaining stocks in the environment are\ndepleted.Thismeansthatnon-renewableresourcescanneverbeusedinasustainablefashion\u2013theycanonly\nbe \u201cmined.\u201d Examples of non-renewable resources include metal ores, petroleum, coal, and natural gas.\nAlthough continuing exploration may discover additional stocks of non-renewable resources that can be\nexploited,thisdoesnotchangethefactthatthereisafinitequantityoftheseresourcespresentonEarth.For\nexample,thediscoveryofalargeamountofmetaloreinaremoteplacemaysubstantiallyincreasetheknown,\nexploitablereservesofthosenon-renewablematerials.Thatdiscoverydoesnot,however,affecttheamountsof\nthe metal present on Earth.\n254 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development Metals are often used to manufacture parts of buildings and machinery. To some degree, the metals can\nbe recovered after these uses and recycled back into the economy, effectively extending the lifespan of their\nreserves. However, due to the growth and increasing industrialization of the economy, the demand for metals\nis accelerating. Because recycling cannot keep up with the increasing demands for metals, large additional\nquantitiesmustbeminedfromtheirknownreservesintheenvironment.Forvaluablemetals,suchasgoldand\nplatinum, there is a high efficiency of recycling, but it is much less so for iron and other less-costly metals.\nFossilfuelsaretheothermajorcategoryofnon-renewableresources.Theyaremostlycombustedtoprovide\nenergyfortransportationandheating,whichconvertstheirorganiccompoundsintocarbondioxideandwater,\nwhich are released into the environment. Some of that CO2and H2O may be absorbed by plants and other\nphotosyntheticorganismsandbeconvertedbackintoorganicmaterials,aprocessthatmightbeinterpretedas\nbeing a kind of recycling. However, the rate at which this happens is insignificantly small compared with the\nrelease of the CO2and H2O by the combustion of fossil fuels, so these materials should be viewed as being as\nnon-renewable as metals are.\nAmoreminoruseoffossilfuelsistomanufacturevariouskindsofplastics.Thesesyntheticmaterialscanbe\nrecycled after initial uses, which does help to extend the lifespan of the reserves of fossil fuels. Nevertheless,\nbecause the dominant use of fossil fuels is as sources of energy, they essentially flow through an industrial\neconomy, with little new recycling.\nImage 12.1.

Most renewable resources are biological, although some are non-biological.Biological Renewable\nResourcesRenewable resources that are biological in nature (bio-resources) include the following:\n\u2022 wild animals that are hunted as food or for bio-materials, such as deer, moose, hare, ducks, fish, lobster,\nand seals\n\u2022 forest biomass that is harvested for lumber, fiber, or energy\n\u2022 wild plants that are gathered as sources of food\n\u2022 plants cultivated as sources of food, medicine, materials, or energy\n\u2022 the organic-based capability of soil to sustain the productivity of agricultural crops\nImage 12.2. Renewable resources, such as timber and fish, are capable of regenerating after they are\nharvested. Provided they are not over-harvested or managed inappropriately, renewable resources can\nbeharvestedinasustainablefashion.ThisphotoshowsaloadoftimberthatwasharvestedonVancouver\nIsland. Source: B. Freedman.\nNon-Biological Renewable ResourcesThe following are renewable resources that are non-biological:\n\u2022 sunlight, of which there is a continuous input to Earth\n\u2022 surface water and groundwater, which are renewed through the hydrologic cycle\n\u2022 winds, which are renewed through the heat-distribution system of the atmosphere\n\u2022 water currents and waves, which are renewed through the heat-distribution system of the oceans, as well\n256 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development as the tidal influence of the Moon\nMany renewable resources can be managed to increase their rates of recruitment and productivity and to\ndecreasemortality.Inthefollowingsectionweexplainhowmanagementpracticescanbeusedtoincreasethe\nproductivity of biological resources.\nAlthough a renewable resource can regenerate after harvesting, it can also be badly degraded by excessive\nuseorbyinappropriatemanagement.Thesepracticescandamagetheabilitytoregenerateandmayultimately\ncause a collapse of the stock. If this happens, the renewable resource is being \u201cmined\u201d, or used as if it were a\nnon-renewableresource.Assuch,itbecomesdepletedbyexcessiveuse.Forthisreason,ecologistscommonly\nuse the qualified term: potentially renewable resources.\nGlobal Focus 12.1. Easter Island as a Metaphor for Spaceship Earth\nA case of resource depletion that is relevant to the metaphor of \u201cspaceship Earth\u201d occurred on Easter\nIsland,asmall(389km2),extremelyisolatedplaceinthesouthernPacificOcean(Ponting,1991;Diamond,\n2004). Easter Island was first discovered by wandering Polynesians around the 9th century. The only\nfoodsthesepeoplebroughtwiththemwerechickenandsweetpotato(theclimateistootemperatefor\ntropicalfoodsknowntothePolynesians,suchasbreadfruit,coconut,taro,andyam).Initially,theEaster\nIslanderscouldhuntabundantfishandporpoisesintherichcoastalwatersoftheirisland,andtheycould\ncatch wild Polynesian rats, a species they had introduced.\nBythe16thcentury,theEasterIslandershaddevelopedaflourishingsociety,withapopulationaslarge\nas15,000.Becauseoffoodsurpluses,theyhadtimetoengageinaculturalactivitythatinvolvedcarving\nhugeslabsofstoneintohuman-facedmonoliths,whichtheyerectedongreatbasesofstoneatspecial\nplaces along the coast. The heavy monoliths (weighing up to 75 t) and their massive bases were carved\nataninlandquarryandthenmovedwithenormoushumaneffort(therewerenodraftanimals)totheir\ncoastal sites, perhaps by rolling them on logs cut from the island\u2019s forest.\nImage 11.3. Human-faced moai, which are large monoliths carved of volcanic stone on Easter Island.\nSource: Aurbina, Wikimedia Commons;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#mediaviewer/\nFile:Moai_Rano_raraku.jpg.\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 257 However, Easter Island was soon deforested by the aggressive cutting of trees for fuel, to construct\nbuildings and fishing boats, and for use as rollers. Once the forest resource was gone, several key\nenterprises of the islanders collapsed. Stone monoliths could no longer be moved, sturdy homes could\nnotbebuilt,andfishingandporpoisehuntingbecameimpossible.Italsobecamedifficulttocookfood\nandkeepwarmbecausetheonlyotherfuelavailablewasthesparsebiomassofshrubsandherbaceous\nplants.\nIn other words, the deforestation of their island caused the economy of this Polynesian society to\ncollapse. TheculturalandeconomicdisintegrationsweresogreatthatwhenEuropeansfirstarrivedat\nEaster Island in 1772, the inhabitants could not remember why the stone monoliths had been erected.\nThese people were living in squalid conditions in caves and reedhuts, were engagedin warfare among\nrivalclans,andwerecannibals,possiblytosupplementthemeagrefoodavailableontheirtreelessisland.\nAn obvious lesson of Easter Island is that even primitive societies are capable of over-exploiting the\nvital resources needed for subsistence. Undoubtedly, the Easter Islanders were keenly aware of their\nprecariouscircumstances\u2013especiallythelimitedresourcesavailabletosustaintheirsocietyonasmall\nandisolatedisland.Asthesevitalresourcesbecameobviouslydiminished,thepeoplelikelydiscussedthe\n258 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development needtoconservetheireconomicbase.However,anysuchdeliberationscametonaught,andtherewas\nan irreversible collapse of the economy and culture of these people.\nEasterIslandisacompellingmetaphorforEarthasaplanetary\u201cisland.\u201dEarth,too,haslimitedstocksof\nenergy,minerals,andbiologicalresourcestosustainthehumaneconomy.Anyofthesenaturalresources\ncan be rapidly depleted by excessive use. There was no alternate, resource-rich refuge to which the\nEasterIslanderscouldescapefromtheirself-inflictedcatastrophe.Likewise,asfarasweknow,thereis\nno alternative to planet Earth.\nManagement of Renewables\nPotentially at least, populations of animals and plants, and their assemblages known as communities and\necosystems (such as a tract of forest), can be harvested in a sustainable manner \u2013 that is, without depleting\nthe size of the resource or its capability to renewal. Essentially, this is due to the fact that, within limits, bio-\nresourcesareabletoregenerateaftersomeoftheirbiomassisharvested.Aslongastherateofharvestingdoes\nnot exceed that of regeneration, a bio-resource can be used in a sustainable way.\nUltimately,theupperlimitsoftheproductivityofanindividualorganismislimitedbygeneticallydetermined\nfactorsthatinfluenceitsfecundity,longevity,andgrowthrate.Toreachthatpotentiallimitofproductivity,an\norganism must experience optimal environmental conditions. In a collective sense, genetic factors also set a\nceilingonthepotentialproductivityofpopulationsororganisms,aswellascommunitiesandlargerecosystems.\nHowever, in the real world it is typical that environmental conditions are not optimal, and so the actual (or\nrealized)recruitment,growth,andmaturationofindividualsandbiomassarelessthantheirpotentialamounts.\nAs a result, it is possible to increase the size of a harvest by the use of management practices that enhance\nthe productivity of bio-resources. When these practices are used in a coordinated way, they are called a\nmanagement system.\nIn general, the various management practices are designed to alleviate environmental constraints on\nproductivity. This is done by mitigating factors that may be preventing some recruitment, or are causing\nmortality, or are constraining the rate of productivity. In addition, the selective breeding of individuals with\ndesirabletraitsmaybeusedtoalleviategeneticallybasedconstraintstoproductivity\u2013ultimately,suchgenetic\n\u201cimprovements\u201d may result in domesticated varieties of crops.\nIn any case, however, the expression of many genetic factors is influenced by environmental conditions,\nvarious of which restrict productivity (Figure 12.1). Therefore, in the real world of ecosystems, the actual\nproductivity of bio-resources is less than their potential.\nFigure 12.1. Factors Affecting the Yield of a Biological Resource. The biomass and productivity of a\nbio-resource are determined by the recruitment of individuals into the population, their growth rates,\nand their mortality through either harvesting or natural means. These factors are affected by both\ngenetically determined and environmental influences. Often, environmental and biological factors can\nbe managed to increase the productivity and size of the stock of a bio-resource. Source: Modified\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 259 from Begon et al. (2005).\nIf resource managers understand the nature of constraints on the productivity of bio-resources, and can\ndevise ways to reduce those influences, then the yield of harvested products can be increased. In any truly\nsustainable system of resource management, those increases in yield must be obtained without degrading the\ncapabilityoftheresourceforrenewal(theycannotbeobtainedbyover-harvestingtheresourceorbydegrading\nenvironmental conditions). The most important practices that are used to increase the productivity of bio-\nresourcesaredescribedbelow.(Note,however,thatwhilethesearecommonlyusedmethodsofincreasingthe\nproductivityofbio-resources,allmanagementpracticescausesomedegreeofecologicaldamage,asisexamined\nin later chapters.)\nSelective Breeding\nIn all species, there is some degree of genetically based influence on biological attributes of individuals such\nas fecundity, longevity, and productivity. Plant and animal breeders deliberately select individuals that display\ntraitsthatareconsidereddesirableandusetheminbreedingprogramsintendedtodevelop\u201cimproved\u201dvarieties\nof crops. This is the basis by which all domesticated species used in agriculture were developed, and cultural\nselectionisstillanimportantwayinwhichcropvarietiesareproduced(seealsoChapter14).Inaddition,since\n260 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development the1980s,newmethodshavebeendevelopedfortransferringgeneticinformationfromonespeciestoanother\n\u2013 these have been used to create so-called transgenic crops (see Environmental Issues 6.1).\nEnhancement of Recruitment\nTherateofrecruitmentofnewindividualsintoanexploitedpopulationcanbeincreasedinvariousways.Some\ncommonly used methods are described below.\n\u2022 Planting:In intensively managed agricultural, aquacultural, and forestry systems, managers may try to\nachieve an optimally spaced monoculture of the crop. This is done so that the productivity will not be\nlimited by competition with non-crop species or by individuals of the crop growing too closely together.\nThe recruitment of plant crops is often managed by sowing seeds under conditions that favour their\ngermination and establishment, while optimizing density to minimize competition. Sometimes young plants\nare grown elsewhere and then out-planted, a practice that is used to cultivate paddy rice, develop fruit-\ntree orchards, and establish plantations in forestry.\n\u2022 Regeneration of Perennial Crops:Some management systems encourage perennial crops to regenerate by\nre-sprouting from surviving rhizomes or stumps after the above-ground biomass is harvested. This\nregeneration system is used with sugar cane and with stands of ash, aspen, maple, and poplar in forestry. In\nsome cases, the regenerating population may have to be thinned to optimize its density.\n\u2022 Stock Enhancement:Recruitment of many fishes, particularly salmon and trout, is often enhanced by\nstripping wild animals or hatchery stock of their eggs and milt (sperm). The eggs are then fertilized under\ncontrolled conditions and incubated until they hatch. The larval fish (called fry) are cultivated until they\nreach a fingerling size, when they are released to suitable habitat to supplement the natural recruitment of\nwild fish.\n\u2022 Site Preparation:Certain practices favour the recruitment of economically preferred tree species in\nforestry. For instance, some pines recruit well onto clear-cuts that have been site-prepared by burning, as\nlong as a supply of seeds is available. Seedlings of other tree species establish readily onto exposed mineral\nsoil and are favoured by mechanical scarification that exposes that substrate by disrupting the organic\nsurface mat.\n\u2022 Managing the Sex Ratio:Recruitment of some hunted animals can be maintained by allowing only adult\nmales to be harvested. For example, most species of deer are polygynous (males breed with more than one\nfemale). Consequently, a hunt can be restricted to males, on the assumption that the surviving bucks will\nstill be able to impregnate all of the females in the local population.\n\u2022 Harvest Season:Recruitment of some animals can be managed by limiting the hunting season to a\nparticular time of the year. For example, restricting the hunt of waterfowl to the autumn allows ducks and\ngeese to breed during the spring and summer so that recruitment can occur. Hunting in the springtime\ninterferes with that reproduction.\nEnhancement of Growth Rate\nAsnotedpreviously,theproductivityofallplantsandanimalsisconstrainedbyenvironmentalinfluences,which\nincludeinorganicfactorssuchasnutrientavailabilityandtemperatureandbiologicalonessuchascompetition\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 261 anddisease.Often,managementpracticescanbeusedtomanipulateenvironmentalconditionstoreducetheir\nlimitation on growth rate, allowing an increased harvestable yield. Sometimes a management system is used,\ninvolving a variety of practices applied in a coordinated manner. Some examples follow.\n\u2022 Agricultural Systems:In intensive agricultural systems, high-yield varieties of crops are grown and\nmanaged to optimize their productivity. The management practices typically combine some or all of the\nfollowing: fertilizer addition to enhance nutrient availability, irrigation to reduce the effects of drought,\ntillage (ploughing) or herbicide use to decrease competition from weeds, fungicide use and other practices\nto control diseases, and insecticide use and other practices to lessen damage caused by insects and other\npests.\n\u2022 Forestry:The intensity of management used in forestry varies greatly, but crop-tree productivity can be\nincreased through silvicultural practices such as thinning young stands to reduce competition among crop\ntrees, using herbicide to control weeds, and using insecticide to cope with infestations of insects.\n\u2022 Aquaculture:High-yield varieties of fish, crustaceans, or mollusks may be grown at high density in ponds\nor pens, where they are well fed and protected from diseases and parasites through the use of antibiotics\nand other chemicals.\nManagement of Mortality Rate\nMortalityofjuvenilesandadultscanseriouslyaffectthesizesofplantandanimalstocks.However,bythinning\nout the stock, mortality also influences the intensity of competition and that can increase the growth rate of\nsurvivors. Natural mortality can be caused by predation, disease, or disturbance, while harvesting mortality\nis associated with use by humans. Resource depletion occurs when the total rate of mortality (natural plus\nharvesting) exceeds the regenerative capability of the stock.\n\u2022 Natural mortalityassociated with predators, parasites, diseases, and accidents can be decreased in various\nways:\n\u25e6 Diseases, Parasites, and Herbivores:Mortality of crop plants caused by herbivorous insects may be\nmanaged by using insecticide or by changing the growth conditions to develop a habitat that is less\nfavourable to the pest. Livestock are commonly affected by parasites, a problem that may also be\nreduced by using a pesticide. For example, sheep infested with ticks are dipped in chemical baths that\nkill the pests. Similarly, mortality caused by disease may be reduced by using medicines that treat the\nsymptoms, by administering antibiotics to deal with bacterial infections, or by changing cultivation\nmethods to decrease vulnerability. All such practices allow diseases, parasites, and herbivores to be\ncontrolled over the short term, but none are long-term solutions to these causes of productivity loss\nand mortality.\n\u25e6 Natural Predators:It is uncommon for coyote, wolf, cougar, or bears to be important predators of\nlivestock, but many farmers still consider any losses to these species to be unacceptable. Some hunters\nfeel the same way about mortality that natural predators cause to hunted wildlife, such as deer, moose,\nand caribou. Consequently, in many regions these large predators have been relentlessly persecuted by\nshooting, trapping, and poisoning. An alternative to killing the predators is to restrict their access to\nlivestock using fences or guard animals such as dogs and donkeys.\n\u2022 Harvesting mortalitymust also be closely managed to ensure that the total mortality (natural plus\nanthropogenic) stays below the threshold for depleting the resource. For an ideal population, the maximum\n262 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest amount of harvesting mortality that can occur without degrading the\nstock. Theoretically, a harvest rate less than MSY would leave a \u201csurplus\u201d of the stock to natural sources of\nmortality, while any greater than MSY would impair regeneration. Note that any harvest rate equal to or\nless than MSY would theoretically sustain the resource. Harvest-related mortality is influenced by many\nfactors, including the amount and kinds of harvesting equipment and personnel, and the time the units\nspend harvesting. Resource managers can adjust the mortality by controlling the total harvesting effort,\nwhich is a function of both the means (such as the kinds of fishing boats and their gear) and the intensity\n(the number of boats and the amount of time each spends fishing) of harvesting.\n\u25e6 Technology:Equipment has a great influence on harvesting rate. Consider, for example, the various\nmethods of catching fish, summarized in Figure 12.2. These technologies vary greatly in efficiency,\nwhich might be indicated by the amount of fish caught per-person fishing, per-unit of energy\nexpended, or per-unit of investment in equipment. In general, much greater harvesting mortality is\nassociated with the more intensive technologies, such as drift nets, trawls, and seines, compared with\nsimpler methods such as hand-lines. The more efficient methods may also have a much greater by-\ncatch of species that are not the target of the fishery and are often thrown away. Similarly, a hunter\narmed with a rifle is more efficient than one using a bow-and-arrow, and trees can be harvested more\nquickly using a feller-buncher than a chainsaw or an axe. (A feller-buncher is a large machine that cuts\nand de-limbs trees and then stacks the logs into piles.).\nFigure12.2.FishingTechnologies.Methodsofcatchingfishvaryenormouslyintheirefficiency\nandintheassociatedharvestingmortality.(a)Linemethodsrangefromhand-lineswithoneor\nmorehooks,tofloatingorbottomlong-linesthatextendforkilometersandhavethousandsof\nhooks.

Source: Freedman (2010).\n\u25e6 Selection of Species and Sizes:The great variation in selectivity of harvesting methods, with regards to\nboth species and size, can be an important consideration in resource management. In a fishery, for\nexample, a change in the net-mesh diameter influences the sizes of animals that are caught. Usually, it\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 263 is advantageous to not harvest smaller individuals, which may not yet have bred and often have a\nsmaller value-per-unit-weight than bigger animals. In forestry, size- or species-selective cutting might\nbe used in preference to clear-cutting, perhaps to encourage regeneration of the most desirable tree\nspecies. Those methods also reduce environmental damage, by keeping the physical structure of the\nforest relatively intact. oNumber of Harvesting Units:An obvious way to manage mortality associated\nwith harvesting is to limit the number of units that are participating in a harvest. In a fishery, for\nexample, the government could limit the number of fishers by issuing only a certain number of\nlicenses. Usually, the kind of technology that the harvesters can use is also specified, such as the\nnumber of boats using a particular fishing gear. oTime Spent Harvesting:The harvesting effort is also\ninfluenced by the amount of time that each unit works. Often there is strong pressure on regulators to\nallow harvesting to occur for as long as possible, because of the great economic value of investments\nmade in machinery and personnel. Even so, in some cases, the harvesting time is closely regulated. For\nexample, certain herring fisheries in coastal waters of western North America are only allowed to\noperate for as little as several hours per year.\n\u2022 Regulatory toolsare legal and administrative procedures that managers use to achieve a measure of\ncontrol over the harvesting effort, and therefore over the mortality associated with exploitation. Relatively\ndirect controls include licenses that regulate the numbers of participants, the technology they may use,\ntheir resource quotas, and the times and places they may harvest. Indirect tools can be used to influence\nthe profitability of different harvesting strategies, such as the following:\n\u25e6 fines for non-compliance, which decrease profit by raising costs\n\u25e6 taxes on more harmful harvesting methods, or subsidies on less harmful ones, which influence profit\nby increasing or reducing costs, respectively\n\u25e6 buyouts of inappropriate or excess harvesting capacity (either equipment or licenses), which increase\nprofit for the remaining harvesters by improving their relative allocation\nMaximum Sustainable Yield\nPotentially, all management options (including selective breeding, enhancement of growth and recruitment\nrates,andmanagementofmortalityrate)canresultinlargeryieldsofbio-resources.However,thefactorsthat\ninfluencethesizeandproductivityofstocksofrenewableresourcesareimperfectlyunderstood.Consequently,\nthe management systems advocated by resource scientists are also imperfect.

These are, however, more than offset by the longer-term economic and ecological benefits of adopting\nprudent strategies of resource use.\nMoreover, the regional economic benefits of smaller (but sustainable) harvests can be enhanced by taking\nsteps to ensure that the manufactured outputs of resource-dependent industries focus more so on \u201cvalue-\nadded\u201dproducts.Inforestry,forexample,theexportofrawlogsmightbeprohibited,whilelocalmanufacturing\n264 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development ofvalue-addedproductssuchaslumber,furniture,andviolinswouldbeencouraged.Similarly,aregionalfishing\nindustry might focus on the production and export of higher-valued products, such as prepared foods, rather\nthanunprocessedfish.Thesekindsofintegrationsofresourceharvestingandmanufacturingcanoptimizethe\nregional economic benefits of resource-based industries, while allowing smaller, sustainable harvests of the\nresource to take place.\nRegrettably, non-sustainable rates of harvesting have been common in the real world of open, poorly\nregulated, bio-resource exploitation. This has happened even where so-called \u201cscientific\u201d management was\nbeingused.Thesefactsbecomeclearfromtheexamplesofresourcedegradationdescribedinthischapter(and\nalso in Chapters 14 and 26).\nNon-Sustainable Use\nMany potentially renewable resources have been used by humans in an unsustainable manner.

In other cases, seemingly abundant species were rendered endangered\nby over-harvesting, including American ginseng, Eskimo curlew, northern fur seal, plains bison, right whale,\ntrumpeter swan, and other once-common species (Chapter 26). In fact, there are remarkably few examples of\neconomically valuable, potentially renewable resources that have not been severely depleted at one time or\nanother through excessive use or inappropriate management.\nAdditional examples of the mining of potentially renewable resources include the following:\n\u2022 extensive deforestation of many parts of the world, which has resulted in losses of timber and fuelwood\nresources as well as environmental damages such as erosion and regional changes in climate (Chapter 23)\n\u2022 extensive degradation of the quality of agricultural soil, resulting in declining crop yields and sometimes\nthe abandonment of previously arable land (Chapter 24)\n\u2022 widespread depletions of groundwater by over-use for irrigated agriculture, which is rapidly drawing down\nlocal and even regional aquifers (Chapter 24)\n\u2022 exhaustion of fisheries, such as those of cod and other groundfish off the Atlantic Provinces, and salmon\nand herring off British Columbia (Chapter 14)\n\u2022 depletion of many hunted resources \u2013 various species of fish, antelope, deer, furbearers, waterfowl, whales,\nand others (Chapter 14)\nNotallcasesoftheminingofpotentiallyrenewableresourceshaveoccurredinmoderntimes.Examplesthatare\nprehistoricaredescribedinGlobalFocus12.1and12.2.Thesewell-knowncasesdemonstratethatevenrelatively\nunsophisticated human societies with primitive technologies have caused enormous damage to their crucial\nresource base.\nInsomecases,anearlydepletionofpotentiallyrenewableresourceswasfollowedbyeffortsofconservation\norimprovedmanagement,whichsubsequentlyrestoredthedepletedstocks(butnotonesthathadbeenmade\nextinct).(Inthesenseusedhere,conservationreferstothe\u201cwiseuse\u201dofnaturalresources,includingrecycling\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 265 and other means of efficient utilization, as well as ensuring that the harvesting of renewable resources does\nnotexceedtheirregeneration.)Forexample,regulatingthehuntingofwhite-tailedandmuledeerhasallowed\nthosespeciestoremainabundantinregionswherehabitatissuitable.Comparablesuccesseshavebeenachieved\nwith other once-depleted animals, such as certain sportfish, ducks, and geese.

Within\na relatively short time, at least 56 species of large mammals (weighing more than 44 kg), 21 smaller\nmammals, and several large birds had become extinct.

This swept away numerous large, flightless birds, including a 250-kg,\n3-m giant moa (Dinornis maximus), 26 other species of moa, a goose (Cnemiornis calcitrans), a swan\n(Cygnus sumnerensis), a giant coot (Fulica chathamensis), a pelican (Pelecanus novaezealandiae), an\neagle (Harpagornis moorei), and fur seals and various large lizards and frogs.

Under such conditions, the stocks are\nquickly mined, and they collapse to economic or biological extinction.\nSometimes,a\u201cvirgin\u201d(orpreviouslyunexploited)resourceisdominatedbylarge,old-growthindividuals,which\nare harvested selectively during the initial stages of resource \u201cdevelopment.\u201d This changes the structure of\nthe resource to one that is dominated by smaller, younger individuals. Because younger individuals are often\nrelatively fast growing, the productivity of the resource is not necessarily smaller than that of the initial old-\ngrowthstock,althoughthetotalbiomassmaybeless.However,ifthiskindofresourcedegradationistakentoo\nfar, the population may collapse in both productivity and biomass. The collapse may be caused by inadequate\nrecruitmentintotheharvestedpopulationbecausethefecundityofyoungerindividualsisnotsufficienttooffset\nthe harvesting mortality.\nPatterns of resource degradation are more complicated in the case of mixed-species resources, which are\noftenover-exploitedinasequentialmanner.Atfirst,onlycertainspeciesinthevirginmixed-speciesresource\nmay be considered desirable from the economic perspective. In addition, some individual organisms may be\nvery large, especially in the case of old-growth resources. For instance, old-growth forest of coastal British\nColumbia is typically dominated by large individuals of valuable tree species, which are coexisting with many\nsmaller individuals (see Chapter 23). Many pre-exploitation communities of fish, whales, and other species are\nalso typically dominated by large individuals of desirable species.\nThe exploitation of a mixed-species resource usually involves a sequential harvest of commodities with\nprogressively smaller economic value (measured as value per individual, as well as per unit of biomass and of\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 267 harvested area). Initially, the largest individuals of the most valuable species are harvested selectively and are\nrapidly depleted. In an old-growth forest, for example, the largest logs of the most desirable species have the\nhighestvalueperunitofbiomass\u2013theycanbeusedtomanufacturelarge-dimensionlumberofpreciousspecies\norcostlyveneerproducts.Theintentionofpost-harvestingmanagementisnottore-createanotherold-growth\nforest, because this would take too much time and would also involve an extended period of relatively low\nproductivity (see Chapter 23). Instead, the site is typically converted into a second-growth forest.\nNext, smaller individuals of the most desired species might be harvested selectively, along with the largest\nindividuals of secondarily desired species. In a forest, the economic products might be smaller-dimension\nlumber.Ifmanagementoftheregeneratingstandisintendedtoproducetimberformanufacturingintolumber,\nthe subsequent harvests would be on a relatively long rotation, say 60-100 years, depending on the growing\nconditions.\nHowever, area-harvesting methods might then be used to harvest all individuals of all species for\nmanufacturingintobulkcommodities.Inthecaseofforestry,treesmightbeclear-cutfortheproductionofsmall\nlumber,pulp,industrialfuel,charcoal,ordomesticfuelwood.Subsequentharvestsforsuchpurposeswouldbe\nonashortrotation,perhaps30-50years.Sometimesthearea-harvestingsystemisfollowedbymanagementthat\nregenerates a productive resource, although it has a different character from the original, natural ecosystem.\nIn forestry, for example, natural mixed-species forest might be converted into a single-species plantation or\nperhaps into an agricultural ecosystem (see Chapter 23).\nIntensive harvesting, sequential or otherwise, can also lead to a collapse of biological productivity and\ntherefore to a huge loss of resource value. For instance, clear-cut forests sometimes regenerate into shrub-\ndominated ecosystems that resist the establishment of tree seedlings. This severe resource degradation may\nrequire expensive management to restore another economically useful forest.\nImage 12.5. Ecologically rich old-growth forest in tropical countries is being rapidly cleared to provide\nagricultural land. The conversion results in destruction of the forest (the mining of a potentially\nrenewableresource),oftentodevelopagriculturallandthatmaynotbeproductiveforverylong.Inthis\ncase, the rice paddies may be cultivated for many years, but the hillsides have been badly degraded\n268 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development by temporary agricultural use. This scene is from Sumatra, Indonesia. Source: B. Freedman.\nReasons for the Abuse of Natural Resources\nTo function over the longer term, an economy depends on a sustained input of natural resources. Given\nthis vital context, it would appear to be economically self-destructive to degrade renewable resources by\nover-harvestingthemorbyinappropriatemanagement.Nevertheless,thismaladaptivebehaviourhasoccurred\nfrequently through human history. In fact, most uses of potentially renewable resources have been decidedly\nnon-sustainable, and have caused stocks to become depleted. The most important reasons for this foolish\nbehaviour are outlined below.\n\u2022 The world\u2019s dominant cultures have developed an ethic that presumes that humans have the \u201cright\u201d to take\nwhatever they want from nature for subsistence or economic benefits. This is an expression of the\nanthropocentric world view (Chapter 1). Particularly noteworthy is the so-called Judeo-Christian ethic\n(White, 1967), which is based on the Biblical story of creation. In that story, God directed humans to \u201cbe\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it,\u201d and to \u201chave dominion over the fish of the sea,\nand over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth\u201d (Genesis 1:28). From a purely ecological perspective, this is an arrogant attitude,\nbut it is typical of the world\u2019s dominant cultures and religions. Modern technological ethics have developed\nfrom this commanding world view and are now used to legitimize the rapid mining of natural resources and\nthe collateral ecological damage.\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 269 \u2022 Individual people and their societies are intrinsically self-interested. This attitude is responsible for many\ncases of over-exploitation of resources in order to optimize short-term profit. At the same time, ecological\ndamage associated with the resource depletion is discounted as being unimportant. This is easily done\nbecause, in most economic systems, the consequences of ecological damage are usually shared broadly\nacross society (by degradation of the common environment, or by tax monies being used to fix the\nproblem), rather than being considered the responsibility of the persons or corporations who cause the\ndamage.\n\u2022 Natural resources are perceived as being boundless. Many people believe that nature and its resources are\nunlimited in their extent, quantity, and productivity. This is referred to as the cornucopian world view\n(Chapter 1; a cornucopia is the mythical horn of plenty that yields food in boundless amounts). In actual\nfact, Earth has limited stocks of resources available for use by humans, and most of these are being rapidly\ndepleted.\n\u2022 Investments of money in some sectors of the economy may accumulate profit faster than the growth rate\nof renewable resources. Consequently, apparent profit can be increased over the shorter term by\nliquidating natural resources and then investing the money earned in a faster-growing sector of the\neconomy (see In Detail 12.1). Following this line of reasoning, the growth of many regional and national\neconomies has been jump-started by economic \u201ccapital\u201d gained through the non-sustainable mining of\nnatural \u201ccapital.\u201d\n\u2022 Not all of the true costs of over-exploitation are taken into account. The economic strategies suggested\nabove only work if the ecological costs of over-exploitation are not paid for. In fact, some kinds of\nenvironmental damage can be interpreted as being \u201cgood\u201d for the economy because they add to the gross\nnational product (GNP). For example, the wreck of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska and the cleanup of the spilled\npetroleum were responsible for billions of dollars of \u201cgrowth\u201d in the GNP of the United States over several\nyears (see Chapter 21). In actual fact, however, the environmental damages represent a depletion of natural\ncapital and contribute to a \u201cnatural debt.\u201d When conventional economics (meaning economics as it is\nusually practiced) calculates the apparent profit gained through over-exploitation, it does not properly\naccount for costs associated with resource depletion and other environmental damages. In theory, at least,\necological economics (a type of economics advocated by many enlightened economists and\nenvironmentalists) would fully cost those damages. An economic systems that tallies all costs, including\nthose of environmental damage, is known as a full-cost accounting system.\nWithin an economic context that involves free access to common-property resources (these are owned by\nall of society), the above factors inevitably lead to the over-harvesting of potentially renewable resources. In\na highly influential essay, Garrett Hardin (1968) called this frequently observed phenomenon \u201cthe tragedy of\nthe commons.\u201d He explained this economic misadventure using the analogy of a publicly owned pasture (the\n\u201ccommons\u201d)towhichalllocalfarmershadopenaccessforgrazingtheirsheep.Individual,self-interestedfarmers\nbelieved that they would gain additional economic benefits by having as many of their own sheep as possible\ngrazingthepasture.Thisledtoanexcessiveaggregateuseofthepasture,whichdamagedtheforageresource.\nHardin\u2019smajorconclusionwasthat\u201cfreedominacommonsbringsruintoall,\u201dandthishasgenerallybeentrueof\nthe ways in which many renewable resources have been abused.\nMany nations are experiencing crises because of diminishing stocks of natural resources and the associated\necological damage caused by disturbances, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Remarkably, many of these\ncountrieshavenotyetattemptedtodealeffectivelywiththeresourcedepletion.Withfewexceptions,thedesign\nand implementation of intelligent strategies for using natural resources has so far proven to be beyond the\ncapability of modern political and economic systems.\nNevertheless, people are definitely capable of designing and implementing systems that would conserve\n270 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development naturalresourcesandthehealthyecosystemsthatarerequiredtosustaineconomies.Thesolutionstoresource-\nrelatedpredicamentsrequireanintegrationofscientificknowledgeandsocialchange,alongwiththeadoption\nof ecologically based economic policies that pursue true sustainability. Such solutions are far preferable to\nunfettered economic growth based on the depletion of natural resources.\nIn Detail 12.1.

In this sense,\nsustainable economic development involves the following actions:\n\u2022 increasing the efficiency of use of non-renewable resources \u2013 for example, by recycling and re-using\nmetals and other materials; by minimizing the use of energy for industrial, transportation, and space-\nheating purposes; and by improving the designs of other materials and products\n\u2022 increasing the use of renewable materials in the economy, such as products manufactured from trees or\nagricultural biomass\n\u2022 rapidly increasing the use of renewable sources of energy, such as electricity generated using hydro, solar,\nwind, or biomass technologies (see Chapter 13)\n\u2022 improving social equity, ultimately to such a degree that all citizens (and not just a minority of wealthy\npeople) have access to the necessities and amenities of life\nSustainable Development\nSustainabledevelopmentreferstomakingprogresstowardaneconomicsystemthatusesnaturalresourcesin\nwaysthatdonotdepletetheircapitalorotherwisecompromisetheiravailabilitytofuturegenerationsofpeople.\nIn this sense, the present human economy is obviously non-sustainable because it involves rapid economic\ngrowth that is achieved by vigorously mining both non-renewable and potentially renewable resources.\nManypoliticians,economists,resourcemanagers,andcorporatespokespersonshavepubliclystatedthatthey\nare in favour of sustainable development. However, most of these people are confusing genuine sustainable\ndevelopment with \u201csustained economic growth,\u201d which by definition is not possible.\nTheterm\u201csustainabledevelopment\u201dwasfirstpopularizedinthewidelyacclaimedreportOurCommonFuture,\nby the World Commission on Environment and Development, an agency of the United Nations. (This report,\npublishedin 1987, is often referredto as the Brundtland Report, after Gro Harlem Brundtland, the chair of the\nCommission at the time.) However, even this report obscured some important differences between economic\ngrowthanddevelopment.Infact,theBrundtlandReportadvocatedalargeexpansionoftheglobaleconomy:\u201cIt\nis...essentialthatthestagnantordeclininggrowthtrendsofthisdecade[the1980s]bereversed.\u201dThereport\nsuggestedthateconomicgrowth,coupledwithamoreequitabledistributionofwealth,wasrequiredtoimprove\nthelivingstandardsofpoorerpeoplesoftheworld.Itfurtherpresumedthatrealprogresstowardano-growth,\nequilibriumeconomycouldnotbemadeuntilsocietyhadachievedtheequitablesocio-economicconditionsthat\nare required for stopping both population growth and the rampant depletion of natural resources.\nOneoftherecommendationsoftheBrundtlandReportwasthattheglobalaverageper-capitaincomeshould\ngrowby3%peryear(ifmaintained,thiswoulddoubleper-capitaincomeevery23years).However,becausethe\nglobal population was increasing at about 2% per year at the time, the economic growth rate would have to\ncompensate,requiringa5%peryearincreaseinthetotaleconomy(3%plus2%,resultingina14-yeardoubling\ntime).

These\nsustainable solutions are more difficult and unpopular than the policies advocated by most mainstream\npoliticians and economists, but they appear to be necessary if a sustainable human economy is to be achieved.\nIn Detail 12.2. Economics, Environment, and Ecology\nConventional economics is a social science that examines the allocation of scarce resources (referred\nto as goods and services) among potential uses that are in competition with each other. A goal of\neconomicsistounderstandandpossiblymanagethepatternsofconsumptionofresourcesbyindividuals\nand by sectors of society. In economics, the worth (or value) of goods and services is assessed on an\nanthropocentricbasis\u2013thatis,intermsofthedirectorindirectusefulnesstopeopleandtheirwelfare.\nIn large part, value is determined by the supply of a resource compared to the demand for it. When\nthe supply is abundant, goods and services are relatively cheap; when they are scarce, they become\nmoreexpensive,whichstimulateseffortstoincreasethesupplyand/orfindinexpensivesubstitutes.Key\nassumptionsofeconomicsarethatpeopleseektoincreasetheirwell-being,andcorporationsstriveto\nmaximizetheirprofit.Asaresult,theirchoicescanbeusedtorevealtheirvaluationsandinvestmentsin\ngoodsandservices.Suchvaluationsareusuallymadeinunitsoftradablecurrency(suchasdollars),and\nthey are routinely made for goods and services for which there are markets, such as the following:\n\u2022 manufactured goods, including buildings, clothing, computers, and vehicles\n\u2022 services, such as those provided by entertainers, farmers, physicians, and teachers\n\u2022 naturalresourcesusedintheeconomy,includingnon-renewableones(metalsandfossilfuels)and\nothers that are renewable (foodstuffs, fish, and timber)\nHowever,conventionaleconomicsperformsmuchlesswellinthevaluationofresourcesforwhichthere\narenoobviousmarkets.Suchvaluationsrequiretheuseofsurveysortheobservationofbehaviour(such\nas the numbers of people visiting a park, or those contributing money to an environmental charity).\nThese sorts of valuations are difficult and somewhat controversial, but they are necessary if society is\nto implement a full-cost accounting system that acknowledges the fact that important environmental\ndamageisassociatedwithmanyeconomicactivities.Thesekindsofvaluationsaremadeintherelatively\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 273 newfieldofenvironmentaleconomics,andtheymayinvolvefindingthecostsofthefollowingkindsof\ndamages:\n\u2022 the depletion of natural resources, including its longer-term implications for the survival of future\ngenerations\n\u2022 pollution and its ecological and human health effects\n\u2022 disturbances that cause damage to natural ecosystems\n\u2022 endangerment and extinction of species\n\u2022 impairment of ecosystem services, which are a major part of the life-support system of the planet\n\u2022 social effects of environmental damage, including unacceptable economic disparities (including\npoverty) and the disenfranchisement of indigenous people and socioeconomic groups\nThesekindsofenvironmentaldamagearewidelyrecognizedasbeingimportant,buttheirvalueisonly\npartially captured by conventional economics. This is a great deficiency, because it means that the\nmarketplace is not fully accounting for environmental damage as a real cost of doing business and an\nexpensetobereckonedwhencalculatingprofit.Environmentaleconomistsarguethataslongasthese\ndamagesarebeingproperlyvaluatedandviewedasexpenses,theycanbeobjectivelyconsideredincost-\nbenefitanalysesthatareassociatedwithdecisionstoundertakepoliciesorengageinactivitiesthatcarry\nrisksforenvironmentalquality(includinganylinkageswithresourceandecologicalsustainability).This\nisakeypartoftheplanningprocessknownasenvironmentalimpactassessment(seeChapter27),which\niscrucialinhelpingsocietytodesignandrunitseconomywithoutcausingunacceptabledamagetothe\necosystems that sustain people and all other species.\nThefieldofecologicaleconomicsgoesevenfurtherthanthefullvaluationofenvironmentaldamage.\nEcological economics arose as a conceptual fusion of economics and ecology (note that the names of\nthese disciplines share the same root, ecos, derivedfrom the Greek wordoikos, meaning \u201chousehold\u201d).\nThe most important feature of ecological economics is that it attempts to examine the relationships\nbetween ecosystems and economic systems in a non-anthropocentric manner (one that goes beyond\nany known usefulness to humans). In particular, ecological economics employs a variety of biophysical\nmeasuresofscarcityandvaluation.Theseincludetheembodiedenergycontent(acomprehensivelife-\ncycle assessment of the energy used to manufacture, transport, and eventually discard of a product)\nandtheecologicalfootprint(thelandareaneededtosupporttheneedsforenergyandmaterials ofan\nindividual,city,orcountry;seeChapter25).Theseapproachescanyieldcompellingresultsthathelpus\ntounderstand the consequences ofoureconomic activities andencourage individuals, businesses, and\nsociety at large to make choices that are less damaging to the environment.\nSustainable Economies\nThe proper definition of a sustainable economy is one that can be maintained over time without causing a\ndepletion of its capital of natural resources. Ultimately, a sustainable economy can be supported only by the\n\u201cwise use\u201d of renewable resources, which would be harvested at rates equal to or less than their productivity.\nTherefore,\u201ceconomicdevelopment\u201dshouldreferonlytoprogressmadetowardasustainableeconomicsystem.\nUnfortunately,therehavebeenfewsubstantialgainsinthisdirection.Thisisbecausemostactionsundertaken\nby politicians, economists, planners, and businesspeople have supported rapid economic growth rather than\n274 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development sustainableeconomicdevelopment.Inlargepart,theydothisbecausetheybelievetheyarefollowingthewishes\nof the public to have greater access to wealth and employment.\nBecause non-renewable resources are always depleted by their use, they cannot provide an ultimate\nfoundation of a sustainable economic system. However, non-renewable resources do have an important role\nto play in a sustainable economy. Their use should, however, be tied to improving the stocks of comparable\nrenewableresourcessothatanetdepletionofcapitaldoesnotoccur.Forexample,ifpeoplewanttousenon-\nrenewablecoal,theymightacttoprovideacompensatingincreaseinforestareaandbiomass.Thiscouldresult\ninnonetconsumptionofpotentialenergy(becausetreebiomassandcoalarebothfuels),andnonetincrease\nintheconcentrationofatmosphericcarbondioxideorotherpollutants(becausetreesabsorbCO2astheygrow,\nand mature forest can store carbon for a long time if not disturbed). Of course, any non-renewable materials\nalready in use in the economy should continue to be used and be recycled as efficiently as possible.\nSymptoms of Non-Sustainability\nAs was previously mentioned, the dominant trends of local, national, and global economies are mostly toward\nvigorouseconomicgrowth,ratherthantowardsustainable development.Thekeyindicatorsofthesetrendsof\nnon-sustainable growth are summarized below.\n\u2022 Rapid Growth of Economies:Because of increases in both population and per-capita use of materials and\nenergy, almost all economies are growing. This well-known fact is reflected by trends in many economic\nindicators, such as stock markets, growth indexes, and the gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the value\nof all goods and services produced by a country in a year; it is equal to gross national product (GNP) minus\nnet investment from foreign nations. Overall, the Canadian GDP grew by about 110% between 1981 and 2012,\ncompared with a 40% increase in population (Figure 12.3). This implies an increase of per-capita GDP\nduring the period, which reflects an improvement of individual wealth in terms of access to goods and\nservices in the economy.\nFigure 12.3. Growth of the Canadian Economy and Population. Gross domestic product (GDP) is an\neconomic indicator that is related to the total size of a national economy. Because these data for\nCanadian GDP are standardized to constant 2007 dollars, the pattern of steady growth is not due to\ninflation. The data show a close correlation between growth of the Canadian population and the GDP\n(ther2valueoftherelationshipis0.984,whichinastatisticalsensemeansthat98.4%ofthevariationof\npopulationisaccountedforbyvariationinGDP).Note,however,thattheclosevisualconvergenceofthe\ntwocurvesisanartifactcausedbyadjustmentoftheverticalaxes.Sourcesofdata:GDPfromStatistics\nCanada (2014) and population from Figure 11.1.\nChapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development | 275 \u2022 Depletion of Non-Renewable Resources:All stocks of metal ores, petroleum, natural gas, coal, and other\nnon-renewable resources are finite, being limited to what is present on Earth. These resources are being\nrapidly consumed, and their exploitable reserves will eventually become depleted. However, discoveries of\nadditional exploitable stocks will extend the economic lifetimes of non-renewable resources, as will\nefficient recycling. Nevertheless, global stocks of non-renewable resources are being rapidly depleted (see\nChapter 13).\n\u2022 Depletion of (Potentially) Renewable Resources:Around the globe there are crises of depletion of\nrenewable resources. In many regions, for example, once- enormous fish stocks are collapsing,\ndeforestation is proceeding rapidly, the fertility of agricultural soil is declining, supplies of surface water\nand groundwater are being depleted and polluted, and hunted animals are becoming scarcer. Not all stocks\nof renewable resources are being severely depleted, but the declines are becoming more common and\nwidespread (see Chapter 14).\n\u2022 Depletion of Non-Economic, Environmental Resources:Some resources that are necessary for the health\nof economic systems are not assigned value in the marketplace\u2014that is, they are not valuated in dollars, and\nare not actively traded. Nevertheless, these resources are important to the health of the ecosystems that\nsustain the human economy. Examples of such non-valuated environmental resources include: (1) the\nability of ecosystems to cleanse the environment of toxic pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and ozone, (2)\necological services such as the production of atmospheric O2and consumption of CO2(the latter being an\nimportant anthropogenic pollutant), and (3) ecosystem functions that support the productivity of\nconventional resources, such as the plant and algal productivity that ultimately allows the growth of stocks\nof hunted deer, fish, and other animals.\n\u2022 Depletion of Other Ecological Values:Some ecological values are not directly or indirectly important in the\nhuman economy, but they still have intrinsic (or existence) worth. This makes these values significant,\nregardless of any perceived importance to human welfare (see Chapter 1). The most important examples of\nthese ecological values are associated with biodiversity, especially the many species and natural\n276 | Chapter 12 ~ Resources and Sustainable Development ecosystems that are indigenous to particular regions. These biodiversity values are increasingly being\nthreatened and lost in all regions of the globe (Chapter 26). Such losses would never be tolerated in an\necologically sustainable economy (that is, one in which resources are used in ways that do not compromise\ntheir future availability and do not endanger species or natural ecosystems; Chapters 1 and 27).\nModern economies deliver great benefits to people who are wealthy enough to purchase a happy and healthy\nlifestyle, replete with sufficient food, shelter, material goods, and recreational opportunities. For less-wealthy\npeople, however, current economic systems may allow only minimal access to the most fundamental basics of\nsubsistence.Ifafairer,moreequitabledeliveryofeconomicbenefitstothepoorerpeopleoftheworldistobe\nachieved, then either non-sustainable economic growth or a substantial redistribution of some of the existing\nwealth will be required.\nUltimately,theglobal scaleandlong-term sustainabilityofthehumaneconomywill belimitedbytheability\nofthebiospheretodeliverrenewableresourcesandecosystemservices.However,thelimitsofmanypotentially\nrenewable resources have already been exceeded, resulting in stock declines or collapses. These well-\ndocumenteddamagesshouldberegardedaswarningsofthelikelyfutureofthehumanenterprise,unlessthere\nare marked improvements in resource-use systems. If critical resources are no longer available to support\neconomic activity, the non-sustainable economy will be forced to contract in size, and may collapse.\nIt must be recognized that an ecologically sustainable economy might not be very popular with much of\nthe public, or with politicians, government administrators, and business interests. These stakeholders would\nexperience short-term pain (likely felt over decades) to achieve long-term, sustainable, societal gains. The\npain would be associated with a less-intensive use of natural resources, the abandonment of the paradigm of\neconomic growth, and the rapid stabilization \u2013 and perhaps downsizing \u2013 of the human population. The gains\nwould be associated with an ecologically sustainable economic system that could support human society, and\nthe rest of the biosphere, for a long time.\nAs we have repeatedly observed, people rely on natural resources to sustain their enterprise. Throughout\nhistory, resources that are essential to economies have been consumed to exhaustion (assuming there was a\ntechnologicalcapabilitytodoso).Itisclearthatbetter,moresustainablesystemsmustbefoundthatwillallow\nustousenaturalcapitalwithoutdepletingitsstocksandwithoutdegradingecosystemsinunacceptableways.\nHumansocietiesdesperatelyrequirethesesustainablesystems,butitremainstobeseenwhetherwewilldesign\nand implement them.\nConclusions\nThe human economy can function only if it has continuous access to an input of natural resources, of which\ntherearetwokinds:non-renewableandrenewable.Non-renewableresourcescannotregenerate,sotheyalways\nbecome depleted as they are used. In contrast, renewable resources are capable of regeneration, so they can\npotentially be available forever.

Describe the global and Canadian production and use of metals, fossil fuels, and other non-renewable\nresources.\n2. Explain the heavy reliance of industrialized economies on non-renewable resources, and predict whether\nthese essential sources of materials and energy will continue to be readily available into the foreseeable\nfuture.\n3. Outline five major sources of energy that are available for use in industrialized countries, and describe the\npotential roles of these in a sustainable economy.\nIntroduction\nAs we noted in Chapter 12, the reserves of non-renewable resources are inexorably diminished as they are\nextractedfromtheenvironmentandusedinthehumaneconomy.Thisisbecausenon-renewableresourcesare\nfinite in quantity and their stocks do not regenerate after they are mined. Note that the word reserve has a\nspecific meaning here \u2013 it is used to denote a known amount of material that can be economically recovered\nfrom the environment (that is, while making a profit).\nOf course, continuing exploration may discover previously unknown deposits of non-renewable resources.\nIf that happens, there is an increase in the known reserves of the resource. For example, the world\u2019s known\nreservesofnickelandcopperhavebeenincreasedduringthepasttwodecadesbecauseofthediscoveryofrich\ndeposits of those metals in northern Quebec and Labrador. There are, however, limits to the number of \u201cnew\u201d\ndiscoveries of non-renewable resources that can be made on planet Earth.\nChanges in the value of non-renewable commodities also affect the sizes of their economically recoverable\nreserves.Forexample,ifthevalueofgoldincreasesinitsmarketplace,thenitmaybecomeprofitabletoprospect\nfornewstocksinremoteplaces,tominelower-gradeores,andtoreprocess\u201cwaste\u201dmaterialscontainingsmall\nquantities of this valuable metal. An improvement of technology may have the same effect, for instance, by\nmaking it profitable to process ores mine that were previously non-economic.\nIn addition, the life cycle in the economy of some non-renewable resources, particularly metals, can be\nextended by recycling. This process involves collecting and processing disused industrial and household\nproducts to recover reusable materials, such as metals and plastics. However, there are thermodynamic and\neconomic limits to recycling, which means the process cannot be 100% efficient. Furthermore, the demand\nfor non-renewable resources is increasing rapidly because of population growth, spreading industrialization,\nand improving standards of living along with the associated per-capita consumption. This has resulted in\nan accelerating demand for non-renewables that must be satisfied by mining additional quantities from the\nenvironment.\nThe most important classes of non-renewable resources are metals, fossil fuels, and certain other minerals\nChapter 13 ~ Non-Renewable Resources | 281 suchasgypsumandpotash.Theproductionandusesoftheseimportantnaturalresourcesareexaminedinthe\nfollowing sections.\nMetals\nMetals have a wide range of useful physical and chemical properties. They can be used as pure elemental\nsubstances, as alloys (mixtures) of various metals, and as compounds that also contain non-metals. Metals\nare used to manufacture tools, machines, and electricity-conducting wires; to construct buildings and other\nstructures; and for many other purposes. The most prominent metals in industrial use are aluminum (Al),\nchromium(Cr),cobalt(Co),copper(Cu),iron(Fe),lead(Pb),manganese(Mn),mercury(Hg),nickel(Ni),tin(Sn),\nuranium (U), and zinc (Zn). The precious metals gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and silver (Ag) have some industrial\nuses(suchasconductorsinelectronics),butarevaluedmostlyforaestheticreasons,particularlytomanufacture\njewelry.Someofthemorecommonmetalalloysarebrass(containingatleast50%Cu,plusZn),bronze(mostly\nCu, plus Sn and sometimes Zn and Pb), and steel (mostly Fe, but also containing carbon, Cr, Mn, and/or Ni).\nMetals are mined from the environment, usually as minerals that also contain sulphur or oxygen.

This releases gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO2) while leaving the metals\nbehind. The concentrate from the smelter is later processed into pure metal in a facility called a refinery. The\npure metal is then used to manufacture industrial and consumer products. The SO2may be processed into\nsulphur or sulphuric acid that can be used in various other industrial processes, or it may be released to the\nenvironment as a pollutant.\nAfter the useful life of manufactured products has ended, they can be recycled back into the refining and\nmanufacturing processes, or they may be discarded into a landfill.\nHigh-quality ores are geologically uncommon. The deposits that are most economic for mining are typically\nlocated fairly close to the surface, and the ores have a relatively high concentration of metals. However, the\nthresholds vary depending on the value of the metal being processed.

Also note the large\nincrease in production of most metals since 1977. Iron and aluminum are the metals produced and used in the\nlargest quantities. The life index (or production life, calculated as the known reserves divided by the annual\nrate of production) of aluminum is about 592 years, and for iron ore it is 58 years (Table 13.1). Life indexes for\nother metals listed in the table are less, which suggests that their known reserves are being quickly depleted.\nItisimportanttoremember,however,thatthoseknownreservesareincreasedbynewdiscoveries,changesin\ntechnology, and more favourable economics for the resource.\nTable 13.1.

Fossil fuels are also used to produce energy to heat indoor spaces, an especially important\nfunction in countries with a seasonally cold climate. Another key use is for the manufacturing of synthetic\nmaterials, including almost all plastics.

In nuclear fission, the atomic structure is\nfundamentally altered, and small amounts of matter are transformed into immense quantities of energy.\nMostoftheenergyliberatedbynuclearfissionisreleasedasheat.Inanuclearpowerplant,someoftheheatis\nusedtoboilwater.Theresultingsteamdrivesaturbine,whichgenerateselectricity.Mostnuclear-fuelledpower\nplants are huge commercial reactors that produce electricity for industrial and residential use in large urban\nareas(Image13.4).Smallerreactorsaresometimesusedtopowermilitaryshipsandsubmarines,orforresearch.\n235U is the fuel that is used in conventional nuclear reactors, such as the CANDU system developed and used\ninCanada.235Uisobtainedfromuraniumore,whichisminedinvariousplacesintheworld.(Canadaisamajor\nplayerinuraniummining,mostofwhichisexported;seeTable13.2.)Uraniumproducedbyrefiningoretypically\nconsists ofabout99.3%non-fissile238Uandonly0.7%235U.Mostcommercialreactorsrequireafuel thathas\nbeen further refined to enrich the235U concentration to about 3%. However, the Canadian-designed CANDU\nreactors can use non-enriched uranium as fuel.\nVariouselements,mostofwhicharealsoradioactive(suchasradongas),areproducedduringfissionreactions.\nOne of these,239Pu, can also be used as a component of nuclear fuel in power plants. To obtain239Pu for\nthis purpose (or for use in manufacturing nuclear weapons), spent fuel from nuclear generating stations is\nreprocessed. Other trans-uranium elements and any remaining235U (as well as non-fissile238U) can also be\nrecovered and be used to manufacture new fuel for reactors.\nSo-calledfast-breederreactorsaredesignedtooptimizetheproductionof239Pu(whichoccurswhenanatom\nof238U absorbs a neutron to produce239U, which then forms239Pu by the emission of two beta electrons).\nAlthoughfast-breederreactorshavebeendemonstrated,theyhavenotbeencommerciallydeveloped.Breeder\nreactorsproduce\u201cnew\u201dnuclearfuel(byproducingplutonium)andtherebyhelptooptimizeuseoftheuranium\nresource.However,therearelimitstotheprocessbecausetheoriginalquantityof238Uiseventuallydepleted.\nTherefore, both235U and239Pu should be considered to be non-renewable resources.\nA number of important environmental problems are associated with nuclear power. These include the small\nbut real possibility of a catastrophic accident such as a meltdown of the reactor core, which can result in the\nrelease of large amounts of radioactive material into the environment (as happened at the Chernobyl reactor\nin Ukraine in 1986). Nuclear reactions also produce extremely toxic, long-lived radioactive by-products (such\nas plutonium), which must be safely managed for very long periods of time (up to tens of thousands of years).\nEnormous quantities of these \u201chigh-level\u201d wastes are stockpiled in Canada and in other countries that use\nnuclear power, but so far there are no permanent solutions to the problem of their long-term management.\nAnother problem is the emission of toxic radon gas and radioactivity from \u201clow-level\u201d wastes associated with\nuranium mines, structural elements of nuclear power plants, and other sources.\nFusionisanotherkindofenergy-producingnuclearreaction.Thisprocessoccurswhenlightnucleiareforced\ntocombineunderconditionsofextremelyhightemperature(millionsofdegrees)andpressure,resultinginan\nenormous release of energy. Fusion usually involves the combining of hydrogen isotopes. One common fusion\nreaction involves two protons (two hydrogen nuclei,1H) fusing to form a deuterium nucleus (composed of one\nproton and one neutron,2H), while also emitting a beta electron and an extremely large amount of energy.\nFusion reactions occur naturally in the interior of the Sun and other stars, and they can also be initiated by\nexposing hydrogen to the enormous heat and pressure generated by a fission nuclear explosion, as occurs in\na so-called hydrogen bomb.

There are two classes of technologies for the generation of hydroelectricity.\n\u2022 Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity involves tapping the natural flow of a watercourse without developing a\nlarge up-river storage reservoir. Consequently, this electricity generation depends on the natural patterns\nof river flow and is highly seasonal.\n\u2022 Reservoir-generated hydroelectricity involves the construction of a dam in a river to store a huge quantity\nof water in a lake-like waterbody. The reservoir accumulates part of the seasonal high flow so that the\ngeneration of electricity can occur relatively steadily throughout the year. Some enormous reservoirs have\nbeen developed by flooding extensive tracts of land that had previously been covered by forest and\nwetlands in various places in Canada, such as in British Columbia, Labrador, Manitoba, and Quebec.\nCanada\u2019slargesthydroelectricgeneratingfacilitiesarelocatedChurchillFallsinLabradorwithacapacityof5,429\nmegawatts(MW),LaGrande-2innorthernQuebecwith5,328MW,G.M.ShruminBritishColumbiawith2,730\nMW, and La Grande 4 and 3 in Quebec, with 2,651 and 2,304 MW, respectively. All of these facilities have large\nreservoirs to store water. Although hydroelectric energy is renewable, important environmental impacts are\nassociatedwithuseofthistechnology.Changesintheamountandtimingofwaterflowinriverscauseimportant\necological damages, as does the extensive flooding that occurs when a reservoir is developed (see Chapter 20).\nImage 13.5.

In general, the per-capita use of primary energy\n(this refers to fuels that are commercially traded, including renewables used to generate electricity) in less-\ndevelopedcountriesislessthanabout1toeperpersonperyear.However,intheless-developedcountriesthere\nisarelativelylargeruseofnon-commercialor\u201ctraditional\u201dfuelsforpurposesofsubsistenceandlocalcommerce,\nsuchaswood,charcoal,driedanimalmanure,andfood-processingresiduessuchascoconutshellsandbagasse\n(a residue of sugar cane pressing). The use of traditional fuels is not reflected in the data of Table 13.8.\nCountries that are developing rapidly are intermediate in their per-capita energy consumption, but their\nrates of energy use are increasing rapidly due to their industrialization. In Malaysia, for example, the national\nconsumptionofprimaryenergyincreasedby167%between1993and2013,whileinSouthKoreaitincreasedby\n118%,inChinaby270%,inIndiaby189%,andinBrazilby103%(bycomparison,thegrowthwas17%inCanadaand\n11%intheU.S.;WRI,2014).Whiletheuseofenergyhasgrownintheseandotherrapidlydevelopingcountries,\ntheirrelianceontraditionalfuelshasdropped.Thishappensbecausetraditionalfuelsarerelativelybulky,smoky,\nandlessconvenienttousethanelectricityorfossilfuels,particularlyintheurbanenvironmentswherepeople\narelivinginincreasinglylargenumbers.Inaddition,thesuppliesofwood,charcoal,andothertraditionalfuels\nhave become severely depleted in most rapidly developing countries, particularly near urban areas.\nRelatively developed countries have a high per-capita consumption of energy (Table 13.8). Their energy use\nis typically more than 3 toe/person and almost entirely involves electricity and fossil fuels. The world\u2019s most\nenergy-intensiveeconomies,onaper-capitabasis,arethoseofCanadaandtheUnitedStates(9.38and7.13toe/\nperson, respectively) , which have more than 40-50 times the per-capita usage of people living in the least-\ndeveloped economies of the world.\nTable 13.8. Consumption of Primary Energy in Selected Countries in 2013. Primary energy refers to\nfuels that are commercially traded, including renewables used to generate electricity. National energy\nconsumption mostly reflects the size of the economy of a country and its population, while per-capita\nuse allows for a comparison of the lifestyle-intensity of average people. Source: Data from BP (2014).\nChapter 13 ~ Non-Renewable Resources | 301 In terms of the total amounts of energy being used, the largest consumers are China (2,852 toe in 2013), the\nUnited States (2,266), and Russia (699 toe). Canada is a highly developed country, but because of moderately-\nsized population and economy, it uses considerably less energy in total, about 333 toe.\nTheuseofcommercialenergyinCanadaincreasedby116%between1965and1990,andby33%between1990\nand2013,whileper-capitaconsumptionincreasedby54%and4%duringthesameperiods,respectively(Figure\n13.2).Thefactthatper-capitaenergyuseincreasedmuchlessquicklythannationalconsumptionsuggeststhat\nCanadianshavebecomemoreefficientintheiruseofenergy,especiallyduringthemorerecentperiod.Smaller\nautomobiles,improvedgaseconomyofvehicles,betterinsulationofresidencesandcommercialbuildings,and\nthe use of more efficient industrial processes have all contributed to this increased efficiency. Nevertheless,\nalthough these gains of energy efficiency have been substantial, they have been more than offset by growth\nin the per-capita ownership of automobiles, consumer electronics, and other energy-demanding products\nand technologies. Also important have been large increases in industrial energy use associated with oil-sands\ndevelopments in Alberta during the past several decades. These latter changes have caused the overall use of\nenergy in Canada to increase substantially.\nFigure 13.2. Trends in the Consumption of Primary Energy in Canada. Note the different scales of\nnational energy consumption (1018 J) and per capita consumption (1012 J/person). Sources: Data from\n302 | Chapter 13 ~ Non-Renewable Resources British Petroleum (2013).\nTheintensiveenergyusagebyCanadiansreflectsthehighdegreeofindustrializationofournationaleconomy.\nAlso significant is the relative affluence of average Canadians (compared to the global average). Wealth allows\npeopletoleadarelativelyluxuriouslifestyle,withreadyaccesstoenergy-consumingamenitiessuchasmotor\nvehicles, home appliances, space heating, and air conditioning. Canada is also a large country, so there are\nrelativelylargeexpendituresofenergyfortravelling.Inaddition,thecoldwinterclimatemeansthatpeopleuse\na great deal of energy to keep warm.\nEnergy Production\nAs was examined in Chapter 12, a sustainable enterprise cannot be supported primarily by the mining of non-\nrenewablesourcesofenergyorotherresources.Therefore,asustainableeconomymustbebasedontheuseof\nrenewable sources of energy.\nHowever, most energy production in industrialized countries is based on non-renewable sources. Averaged\nacross the relatively developed countries shown in Table 13.9, non-renewable fossil fuels and nuclear power\naccount for 91% of the total use of energy. Renewable sources, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind,\nand biomass fuels, account for only about 9%. With such a small reliance on non-renewable sources, it is\nclear that the major economies of the world are not close to having developed sustainable energy systems.\nConsidering the rapid rate at which reserves of non-renewable energy resources are being depleted, one\nwonders how long the energy-intensive economies of developed nations can be maintained.\nTable 13.9. Energy Consumption in Selected Countries in 2013. Data are in units of 106 tonnes of\nChapter 13 ~ Non-Renewable Resources | 303 oil equivalent.

Within the renewable sector, hydro accounted for 96% of the electricity production, wind for 3%, and\nothers for 1%.\nConclusions\nNon-renewable resources are always diminished as they are used. Although non-renewables can be used\nwith great enthusiasm to achieve economic growth, they cannot be the basis of a sustainable economy. Only\nrenewable resources can play that fundamental role. In this chapter we learned that the non-renewable\nresourcesthatarevitaltothefunctioningofmodern\u201cadvanced\u201deconomies,suchasthatofCanada,arebeing\nrapidlydepleted.Forinstance,thelifeindexoftheglobalreservesofcopperisonlyabout39years,whilethat\nof nickel is 30 years, and zinc 19 years. Among fossil fuels, the life index of the global reserves of petroleum\nis about 58 years, while that of natural gas is 55 years, and coal 113 years. While it is true that continuing\nexplorationwillfindadditionalreservesoftheseandothernon-renewableresources,therearelimitstothose\nChapter 13 ~ Non-Renewable Resources | 305 further discoveries. In addition, about 72% of the consumption of primary energy in Canada is based on non-\nrenewablesources,asis39%oftheelectricitygeneration.Becausethereservesofallnon-renewableresources\narebeingdepletedrapidly,bothinCanadaandaroundtheworld,thelonger-termsustainabilityoftheenergy-\nintensive economies of developed countries, and the lifestyles of their citizens, is highly doubtful.\nQuestions for Review\n1. Using information from this chapter, describe the Canadian and global production and use of non-\nrenewable resources.\n2. Show how industrialized countries rely mostly on non-renewable resources to sustain their economies.\nWill this kind of resource use be able to continue for very long? Why or why not?\n3.

What are the key sources of energy and materials that are ultimately based on sunlight? Which of these\nresources would you consider to be renewable, and which not?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Outline the ways in which you use energy, both directly and indirectly. For each of your major uses, how\ncould you decrease your energy consumption? How would a decrease in energy consumption affect your\nlifestyle?\n2. What are the apparent barriers to the widespread adoption of renewable sources of materials and energy in\nadvanced economies (such as Canada)?\n3. What are the roles of non-renewable and renewable resources in a sustainable economy?\n4. Biomass, wind, and hydroelectricity are all examples of renewable sources of energy. Examine the energy-\nsource distributions for several countries in Table 13.9 and discuss why they are not relying more on\nrenewable sources of energy.\n5. Make lists of the apparent benefits and risks associated with nuclear power. Focus on resource and\nenvironmental issues, such as the depletion of fossil fuels, emissions of greenhouse gases, and the long-\nterm disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.\nExploring Issues\n1.

List the major classes of renewable resources and describe the character of each.\n2. Identify ways by which renewable resources can be degraded by excessive harvesting or inappropriate\nmanagement.\n3. Describe the renewable resource base of Canada and discuss whether those resources are being used in a\nsustainable fashion.\n4. Show how the commercial hunts of cod and whales have represented the \u201cmining\u201d of potentially renewable\nresources.\nIntroduction\nRenewable resources are capable of regenerating after harvesting, so their use can potentially be sustained\nforever. For this to happen, however, the rate of use must be less than that of regeneration \u2013 otherwise, a\nrenewable resource is being mined, or being used as if it was a non-renewable resource.\nThe most important classes of renewable resources are water, agricultural soil quality, forests, and hunted\nanimals such as fish, deer, and waterfowl. In the following sections we examine the use and abuse of these\npotentiallyrenewableresources.(Wepreviouslylookedatrenewablesourcesofenergy,suchashydroelectricity,\nsolar power, wind, and biomass, in Chapter 13.)\nFresh Water\nAlthoughwaterisextremelyabundantonEarth,about97%ofitoccursintheoceansandistoosaltyformany\nusesbyorganismsorthehumaneconomy.Oftheremaining3%thatisfreshwater,almostalloccursinglacial\niceandisnoteasilyavailableforusebypeopleorotherspecies.The\u201cavailable\u201dformsoffreshwatermostlyoccur\ninthesurfacewatersoflakesandrivers,orasgroundwaterinsoilorrocks.Theselimitedstocksoffreshwater\nare a vital resource for ecosystem processes and for many of the economic activities of people.\nSurface Water\nSurface water is a collective term for lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers. Fresh water from these bodies can\nbe used for drinking, cleaning, agricultural irrigation, generation of hydroelectricity, industrial cooling, and\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 309 recreation. Surface waters are abundant in regions where the climate is characterized by more precipitation\nthanevapotranspiration,whichallowstheaqueousresourcetoberecharged(seeChapter3).However,indrier\nregionssurfacewatersareuncommonorrare,andthispresentsanaturalconstraintonecologicalandeconomic\ndevelopment.\nIn regions where there is a low rate of recharge of surface water, excessive use for irrigation or industrial\nor municipal purposes (such as drinking, washing, and flushing toilets) can rapidly deplete the resource. A\ndeficiency of surface water in an arid region can lead to conflicts between local areas, and even between\ncountries. Each region wants to have access to as much water as possible to support its agricultural and\nindustrialactivitiesandtoserviceitsurbanareas.Thisisthereasonwhyseverecompetitionforsurfacewateris\nachronicproblemindrierpartsoftheworld,particularlyintheMiddleEast,muchofAfrica,andsouthwestern\nNorth America.\nIn the Middle East, for example, the watershed of the Jordan River is shared by Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and\nSyria. All of these countries have a dry climate, and all demand a share of the critical water resource. Also in\nthe Middle East, the watersheds of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers originate in Turkey, while Iraq and (to a\nlesserdegree)Syriaarehighlydependentdown-riverusersthatarethreatenedbyhydroelectricandagricultural\ndiversion schemes in Turkey. In northern Africa, the watershed of the Nile River encompasses territory in\nnine countries: Egypt,Ethiopia, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, DemocraticRepublic ofCongo, Tanzania, Kenya,and\nUganda. The collective needs of those countries for water exceed the limited capacity of even that great river.\nIn North America, the most contentious water-use conflicts involve the Colorado River and the Rio Grande,\nwhich are shared by the United States and Mexico. The use of water from these rivers is extremely intensive,\nparticularly for irrigated agriculture. In fact, virtually all the flow of the Colorado River could potentially be\nused in the United States before it even reaches northern Mexico, where there is also a substantial demand.\nInaddition,thechemicalqualityofthewaterisdegradedbyinputsofdissolvedsaltsmobilizedbyagricultural\npracticesintheU.S.,afactorthatseverelycompromisesthepotentialuseofanyremainingriver-waterflowin\nMexico.Becausethisbinationalproblemisimportant,thetwofederalgovernmentshavenegotiatedatreatythat\nguarantees a minimum quantity of flow and water quality where the Colorado River crosses the international\nboundary. The Rio Grande has a similar problem, which is also being dealt with by a treaty between the two\ncountries.\nEven where surface waters are relatively abundant, their quality can be degraded by pollution by nutrients,\nhydrocarbons, pesticides, metals, or oxygen-consuming organic matter. Excessive nutrients can increase the\nproductivity of surface waters, causing a problem known as eutrophication (see Chapter 20).

For instance, groundwater may be polluted by gasoline leaking from underground\nstorage tanks at service stations, degraded by the infiltration of agricultural fertilizer and pesticides, or\ncontaminated by bacteria and nutrients seeping from manured fields or septic systems. Badly contaminated\ngroundwater may not be usable as a source of drinking water, and even for the irrigation of crops.\nItisimportanttounderstandthatgroundwatermayberenderedpersistentlyunusableasasourceofdrinking\nwaterifithasbeencontaminatedbyhazardousortoxicsubstances,suchashydrocarbons(gasoline,engineoil,\nor home-heating fuel), pesticides, nitrate originating with agricultural fertilizer, or Escherichia coli and other\npathogensoriginatingwiththedumpingoflivestockmanureoruntreatedurbansewagesludge.Becausemany\naquifersrechargeandturnoverslowly,itmaytakedecadesorevencenturiesforthesekindsofcontaminantsto\nbepurgedfromthesystem.Ingeneral,the\u201cdilutionsolutiontopollution\u201ddoesnotworkwellwhengroundwater\nisthereceivingmedium.Itisalwaysprecautionarytoavoidactivitiesthatcarryariskofdamagingthequalityof\nwater in an aquifer.\nGroundwater can also be degraded by the intrusion of salt water, which can render the resource unfit for\ndrinking or irrigation.

Once this\nhappens, it is extremely difficult to displace the salt water, and the ability of the aquifer to supply fresh water\nmay have been destroyed.\nWater Supply and Use\nThe regions of the world with the smallest per-capita water resources are Asia, Africa, and Europe, a pattern\nthatpartlyreflectsthehighpopulationdensitiesofthosecontinents.Ingeneral,Canadahasabundantsupplies\nof both surface water and groundwater.

Often, groundwater is naturally cleaner than surface water and is\nthereforebettersuitedformanypurposes,especiallyhouseholduse.Sometimes,however,groundwaterquality\nis impaired through naturally high concentrations of calcium, iron, and other chemicals.\nIn general, national patterns of water use are influenced by the degree and kind of economic development,\nthe population size, and amounts of rainfall.

Unfortunately, E.coli pollutedthe groundwater in one of the wellfields.\nThis was likely caused by livestock manure that had been spread on the surface of nearby agricultural\nfields. This practice is commonly used to discard the enormous amounts of fecal waste generated by\nlivestock in Canada.\nA subsequent inquiry discovered a remarkable combination of irresponsibility and incompetence on\nthe part of town officials. Initially, the bacterial pollution was not detected by routine water-quality\nmonitoring, but even when it was discovered, sensible action was not immediately taken to deal with\ntheproblem.AccordingtothelocalMedicalOfficerofHealth,officialsintheWalkertonPublicUtilities\nCommission knew about the E. coli pollution for several days before they informed the public about\nthe hazard. Meanwhile, people continued to drink their tapwater, which resulted in hundreds of them\nbecoming severely ill.

Site capability is a complex ecological quality that depends on nutrients,\norganic matter, and moisture in the soil, plus additional factors that affect the productivity of crops. These\nfactorsareinfluencedbyclimateanddrainage,bythevigourofecologicalprocessessuchasdecompositionand\nnutrient cycling, and by the kinds of microbial and plant communities that are present.\nSite capability is extremely important to the productivity of agricultural systems, and therefore to the\nproductionandavailabilityoffood.Becausethebeneficialqualitiesofcultivatedlandcanbemaintainedandeven\n316 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources improved by the use of appropriate management practices, site capability represents a potentially renewable\nresource. However, it can also be degraded by certain agricultural practices (see Chapter 24).\nUltimately, site capability for agriculture depends on seven interrelated factors: soil fertility, organic matter,\nbulk density (including compaction), resistance to erosion, moisture status, salinization, and the abundance of\nweeds. These factors are examined below:\nSoil fertilityis related to the ability of an ecosystem to supply the nutrients that are needed to sustain\nthe productivity of a crop. Especially important are the sources of nitrogen, particularly inorganic forms such\nas ammonium and nitrate, as well as phosphate, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulphur. Soil fertility is\ninfluencednotonlybytheamountsofthesenutrients,butalsobyfactorsthataffecttheiravailabilitytoplants,\nsuch as:\n\u2022 the cation exchange capacity, or the degree to which positively charged ions (these are cations) of such\nnutrients as ammonium (NH4+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca2+) are bound by soil\n\u2022 the anion exchange capacity, which is related to the binding of negatively charged ions (anions) such as\nnitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43\u2013), and sulphate (SO42\u2013)\n\u2022 soil acidity or alkalinity, which are usually measured as pH, and affect the solubility of many nutrients as\nwell as key aspects of microbial activity\n\u2022 the rate of oxidation of organically bound nutrients into inorganic compounds that plants can take up and\nuse more effectively in their nutrition\n\u2022 the enhancement of nutrient availability through the addition of agricultural fertilizer or other practices\nFor example, consider the process of nitrification (see Chapter 5), an important function that is performed by\ncertain bacteria and that transforms ammonium into nitrate. The rate of nitrification is greatly decreased in\nsoil thatisacidicorwaterlogged,whichresults inmuchless availabilityofnitratetocrops.Soil fertilityisalso\ndegradedifexcessiveamountsofnutrientsareremovedwhencropsareharvested,andalsobythecompaction\nof soil, depletion of soil organic matter, waterlogging, and acidification.\nSoilorganicmatterconsistsofplantdebrisandhumifiedorganicmaterial.Organicmattercontributestothe\nabilityofsoiltoformaloose,crumblystructurecalledtilth.Soilwithgoodtilthiswellaerated,allowsplantroots\nto grow freely, and retains moisture, all of which are important factors that affect crop growth.\nIn addition, some nutrients are components of soil organic matter. These organically bound nutrients are\nslowly released for plant uptake through the process of decomposition, which in this respect can be viewed\nas a natural, slow-release, organic fertilization. Organic matter in the soil also helps to retain ionic forms\nof nutrients through cation and anion exchange capacity. Intensive cropping with insufficient return of crop\nresidues typically results in a loss of soil organic matter and degradation of the valuable ecological services it\nprovides.\nBulk densityof soil (its weight per unit volume) has a large effect on tilth and drainage. It is generally\npreferable to have a low bulk density, but this can be degraded by the loss of soil organic matter and by\ncompaction caused by the repeated passage of heavy machinery, especially when fields are wet. Soil that has\nbeen degraded by compaction may become wetter, lack oxygen, and have impaired nutrient cycling and poor\nroot growth. These changes can result in a substantial decrease of productivity.\nResistancetoerosionisdegradedwhensoilisleftwithoutacoverofvegetationorcropresiduesduringthe\nwinter,whencontourploughingisnotpracticed(suchaswhencultivationrunsdownasloperatherthanalong\nit),andwhensteepterrainistilled.Incontrast,sitesareresistanttoerosioniftheyarewellvegetated,havegood\ntilth,areflat,andtheclimateisnotexcessivelywetorwindy.Ineffect,erosionrepresentanimportantproblem\nbecauseitisalossofsoilmass,whichoccursasparticlesarecarriedawaybytheforcesofwindorrunningwater.\nAnyagriculturalpracticesthatincreasetherateoferosionshouldbeviewedasaminingofsoilcapital.Insevere\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 317 cases,erosioncanstripawaytherelativelyfertile,surfacehorizonsofthesoil.Intheworstcases,bedrockmay\nbe exposed and the land is forever ruined for agricultural use.\nMoisture statusis another important aspect of site capability. In general, an intermediate moisture status\n(referredtoasmesic)ispreferredforthegrowthofmostcrops.Excessivelydry(xeric)siteswillproduceasmall\nyield,andcropsmayperishfromdrought.Incontrast,excessivelywet(hydric)sitestendtohavecoolsoilwith\nlittle or no oxygen present, which are conditions that are stressful to most crops.\nThe moisture status of sites is largely affected by climatic factors, especially the rates of precipitation and\nevapotranspiration. Soil moisture is also affected by the drainage characteristics \u2013 coarse-grained soils may\ndrain too rapidly and have little ability to hold moisture, while heavy clay soils may not drain well enough,\nretaining water close to the surface. Soils with good tilth tend to have a degree of drainage midway between\nthese extremes.\nSalinizationreferstotheaccumulationofvariouskindsofsaltsinthesoil,particularlyexcessiveamountsof\nsodium,magnesium,potassium,chloride,orsulphate.Theseandothersaltsarepresentinirrigationwaterand\nin certain kinds of fertilizer and they remain behind when water evaporates to the atmosphere. Salinization is\na common problem in agricultural fields that are irrigated but do not have enough drainage to carry the salts\ndownward into the soil and away, causing them to accumulate at the surface.\nTheabundanceofweedsisimportantbecausewhenabundant,theyprovidetoomuchcompetitionforcrop\nplants.Theterm\u201cweed\u201dcanbedefinedasplantsthatarejudgedtobeinterferingwithsomehumanpurpose(see\nChapter22).Anincreasedabundanceofweedsmaybecausedwhenaparticularspeciesofcropiscultivatedina\ncontinuousfashion,withoutrotationwithothercrops.Anexcessiveabundanceofweedsiscommonlymanaged\nbytillingthesoiland/orbyusingherbicide.Inaddition,abuildupofweedpopulationscanbeavoidedbyrotating\ncropsandbyusingothermanagementpracticesthatprovidelessfavourableconditionsfortheunwantedplants.\nDegradation of Site Capability\nOver the longer term, intensive agricultural management can result in a degradation of site capability. When\nthis happens, the productivity of crops decreases, and in severe cases the land may no longer be suitable\nfor agricultural use. Fortunately, such damage can often be avoided or repaired by changing the management\nsystem. For example, inorganic fertilizer may be applied to the soil in an attempt to compensate for declining\nfertility.Organicsoilconditioners,suchascompostandmanure,canalsobeaddedtomitigatelossesoforganic\nmatter,therebyhelpingtomaintainthefertilityandtilthofsoil.Inothercases,pesticidesmaybeusedtotryto\nmanageweedsandotherpests.Thesemanagementoptionsare,however,intensiveintheiruseofmaterialand\nenergy resources, and they may cause additional damage to the site and nearby ecosystems. Ultimately, truly\nsustainable agricultural systems involve the use of management strategies that conserve site capability while\nminimizing the use of nutrients, pesticides, and non-renewable sources of energy (see the section on Organic\nAgriculture in Chapter 24).\nProduction and Management\nIn2014,morethan7.3-billionpeoplewerealive,andalmostallwerereliantonagriculturalcropsastheirprime\nsource of food. There are also relatively minor amounts of food that are harvested from the wild, such as by\nfisheries, but agricultural production is responsible for the great bulk of the modern human diet.\n318 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources In addition, our associated domestic animals largely depend on the production of agricultural crops. The\nnumbersoflivestockareactuallygreaterthanthoseofpeople,includingabout1.5-billioncows,1.5-billionsheep,\n1.2-billiongoats,1.0-billionpigs,and22billionchickens(Chapter10).Althoughsomeofthesedomesticlivestock\nforageonwildplantsinunbrokenpastures(whichhavenotbeenseededtoagriculturalforageplants),manyare\nfedgrainandhaythathasspecificallybeengrownforthem.Infact,about40%oftheglobalproductionofgrain\nisfedtolivestock.Eventually,foodproductsderivedfromthelivestockareeatenbypeople,whoaresecondary\nconsumers (and top predators) in this part of the agricultural food chain.\nIfacountryhasanexcessofagriculturalproductionoverdomesticconsumption,thenithasasurplusavailable\nforexport,whilethosewithadeficitmustimportsomeoftheirfood(Table14.4).Ingeneral,thegreatestfood-\nexporting nations have a relatively developed economy.

In agriculture,\nmanagement practices are intended to mitigate some of the constraints that are limiting crop productivity,\nincluding those associated with site quality, inclement weather, insect infestations, weeds, and diseases. The\nproductivity of cereals and other crops varies greatly among countries, but it is not necessarily lower in less-\ndeveloped than in more-developed ones (Table 14.5). Although wealthier countries use highly mechanized\nmanagement systems with inputs of fertilizer, pesticides, and sometimes irrigation water, less-wealthier\ncountries may also use intensive management systems, albeit ones that depend more strongly on human and\nanimal labour and with smaller material inputs.\n320 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources Table 14.5.

Not surprisingly, this pattern is even more striking in the data for the least-developed\ncountries, which show little improvement in per-capita food production over the period.\nThese observations suggest that there is a food \u201ctreadmill\u201d, in which increases in food production, obtained\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 321 by converting natural habitats and adopting more intensive management practices, are being mostly offset by\npopulation growth. The metaphor of a treadmill is apt in this case, because on that sort of running machine a\ngreat deal of effort is expended, but the runner stays in about the same place.\nFigure14.1.Changesintwoindicatorsofagriculturalproduction.Theproductionindexdata(a),aswellas\ntheper-capitaindex(b),arerelativetotheperiod 2004-2006,whicharesettoascaleof100.Separate\ngraphs are shown for global values and least-developed countries.

For example, the most important agricultural\nfertilizers are inorganic compounds of nitrogen, such as urea or ammonium nitrate, both of which are\nmanufactured using natural gas. The second- and third-most important fertilizer nutrients are compounds\nof phosphate and potassium, which are produced from mined minerals. In addition, most pesticides are\nmanufactured from petrochemicals, using energy-intensive technologies. Moreover, the mechanization of\nagricultural systems involves the use of tractors pulling heavy equipment for tilling, harvesting, and other\n322 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources purposes.Themanufacturingofthesemachinesrequireslargeamountsofnon-renewableenergyandmaterials,\nsuch as metals and plastics. Furthermore, the machines run on non-renewable fuels, such as gasoline or diesel.\nTable14.6comparesindicatorsoftheintensityofagriculturalmanagementamongselectedcountries.There\nis great variation among countries, with some less-developed ones using practices that are intensive as some\ndevelopedones.Ingeneral,however,theintensityofmanagementisgreaterinwealthiercountries,withgreater\nuse of fertilizer and pesticide, more mechanization, and larger more industrial farms.\nTable 14.6.

Water use is the percent\nof total withdrawals that are used for agriculture. Source: Data from FAO (2014b).\nAswasjustnoted,someagriculturalsystemsusedinless-developedcountriesarequiteintensiveandresultin\nhigh yields. For example, in many humid tropical countries, rice is cultivated using a system known as paddy.\nAlthough some paddy-rice agriculture has been mechanized, it is often carried out on smaller-scale family\nfarms. Typically, water buffalo are used to plough and till the dyked, flooded fields (each of which is a paddy).\nPeople then hand-transplant young rice plants, weed the crop with hoes, and eventually harvest by scything\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 323 and gathering sheaves of the plant stalks.

The least productive systems are used in semi-\narid regions. Under such conditions, it is not possible to cultivate many plant crops. However, livestock such\nas camels, cows, goats, and sheep can roam extensively over the landscape, harvesting the sparse production\nofnativeforage.Thedispersedplantbiomass ofsemi-arid ecosystems istoo small inquantityandtoo poor in\nnutritional quality for direct harvesting and use by people.

For example, in order to maintain the productivity of many\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 325 agroecosystems, large amounts of fertilizer and soil conditioners must be added to the system.

The rapid intensification of agriculture is, however, substantially dependent on the use of non-\nrenewablesourcesofenergyandmaterials,afactthatchallengesthesustainabilityoftheproductionsystems.\nMoreover, intensive agricultural systems cause important damages to the environment, many of which are\nexamined in later chapters, especially in Chapter 24.\nCanadian Focus 14.1. Weather Extremes and Agriculture\nClimatic factors, such as heat, wind, and soil moisture, have an important influence on agricultural\nproduction. Harvests can be bountiful when climatic conditions are good, but if they occur as extreme\nevents, crops can be wiped out. For instance, periods of extended dry conditions, or drought, are\noccasionally present in the Prairie region, where large areas have only a marginal availability of soil\nmoisture for key crops such as wheat and canola (Agriculture Canada, 2014; Canada History, 2013).\nThe most devastating period of drought during the past century occurred from 1929 to 1937, when\nlow precipitation and over-cultivation of prairie soil caused the land to turn to a fine dust that blew\naway during windstorms. The dust accumulated as dunes and windrows, covering roads and buildings\nand making life difficult or impossible for many rural people in the affected regions. Since then, the\nprecipitation regime has been more moderate and there has been a widespread adoption of soil-\n328 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources conservationpractices,suchasplantinglinesoftreesandwindbreaks,fallowingoffieldsaspartofacrop\nrotation, and additional measures.\nNevertheless, events of severe drought continue to occur in the prairie region. For example, during\n2001muchofwesternCanadaexperiencedsomeofthedriestgrowingconditionseverrecorded.Large\nsouthern regions of Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan had record-low precipitation and\nsevere drought. This resulted in widespread decreases in yield and even crop failures in the drought-\nstrickenareas.Droughtwasalsoseverein2002,althoughthemostseverelystrickenareaswerefurther\nnorth, in central Alberta and nearby Saskatchewan. In the southernmost Prairie Provinces, where\ndroughtwasmostseverein2001,moisturewasnormalorbetterin2002.Droughthasbeengenerallyless\nof a problem since those years.\nYears of severe drought have a destabilizing influence on the agricultural economy of the Prairie\nregion. In 2002, owing to the cumulative effects of three consecutive years of poor spring runoff (due\nto below-average snowfall) and sparse precipitation during the growing season, the amount of forage\navailable in drought-stricken areas was critically low. Many ranchers had to sell off most or all of their\ncattle, including vital breeding stock, because they were unable to grow enough forage to feed their\nanimals and were unable to pay the high cost of importing feed.\nThe production of crops was also hard hit. The national production of non-durum wheat, which is\nmostly grown in the Prairie Provinces, was only 12-million tonnes in 2002, compared with 18-million\ntonnes in 2001 and 21-million tonnes in 2000 (an overall 44% decrease). The production of canola was\nalsomarkedlydown,from7-milliontonnesin2000to5-million tonnesin2001and3-milliontonnesin\n2002(a55%decrease).AlthoughCanadaisnormallyanexporterofgraintoglobalmarkets,in2002we\nimported wheat from Russia.\nFarmers have a number of management options available to them during periods of drought. For\ninstance, they can practice summer fallow, a practice in which the land is not cultivated in some years\nin order to conserve its vital soil moisture. Farmers can also choose to grow crops that are relatively\ntolerantofdrought,suchasfield-peaorwheat.Ifsurfacewaterorgroundwaterareavailable,irrigation\nmay be an option.\nThe practice of agriculture has always been somewhat risky in the Prairie region, and farmers can\nsuffer terribly from the economic and emotional damage of drought. During such times, it is essential\nthat affordable crop insurance and other means of financial support be available to the agricultural\ncommunity.Thisshould,infact,beanationalpriority\u2013allCanadiansarefedbytheproducegrownby\nfarmers,andwemustsharewiththemtheconsequencesoftheecologicalandeconomicrisksinherent\nin their agricultural enterprise.\nForest Resources\nForests of various kinds are extremely important terrestrial ecosystems.

Tree\nbiomass is harvested for three major reasons:\n1. as a fuel for subsistence, that is, to burn as a source of energy for cooking and warmth\n2. as an industrial fuel, used to generate electricity or to produce steam or heat for a manufacturing process\n3. as a raw material to manufacture lumber, paper, composite materials such as plywood and waferboards,\nand other products, such as synthetic rayon and celluloid In addition, forests may be cleared not so much\nfor their biomass, but to create new agricultural or urbanized land. These longer-term ecological\nconversions result in deforestation, which is a permanent loss of forest cover.\nThenetprimaryproductionofglobalforestshasbeenestimatedtobeabout49-billiontonnesperyear,ofwhich\nan extraordinary 28% is used by humans (Vitousek et al., 1986). Human use can be divided into the following\ncategories:\n\u2022 short-term clearing of forests for shifting cultivation in less-developed countries (45%)\n\u2022 more permanent conversion of forests to agricultural land-uses (18%)\n\u2022 harvesting of tree biomass (16%)\n\u2022 productivity of trees in plantations (12%)\n\u2022 loss during harvest (9%)\nImage 14.2.

Extensive deforestation also occurred during the First World War, when\nEuropean countries were engaged in \u201ctotal war\u201d economies and were harvesting wood as quickly as possible,\n332 | Chapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources often for use as pit props in underground coal mining. Large parts of these regions are now largely devoid of\nforest cover, which has been replaced by agroecosystems and urbanized land.\nThis process of deforestation largely stopped around 1920 to 1930. At that time, forested areas began to\nincrease in many developed countries. This happened because many small farms of marginal agricultural\ncapability were abandoned and their inhabitants migrated to urban areas to seek work. Over time, the land\nreverted to forest. In much of Europe, this involved the establishment of plantations (tree-farms), usually of\nconiferspecies.Inotherregionstherewasanaturalafforestationastree-seedsestablishednewpopulationson\ndisusedruralland.Forexample,becauseofthesesocio-economicandecologicaldynamics,theareaofforestin\nmuchoftheMaritimeProvinceshasapproximatelydoubledsincethebeginningofthetwentiethcentury.Similar\nchanges have occurred in other developed regions of the world.\nHarvesting and Managing Forests\nGlobally,thenettrendisoneofrapiddeforestation.Between1990and2010,about7-millionhectaresofforest\nper year were lost to deforestation (UNEP, 2014). Almost all of this aggressive deforestation is associated with\ntheconversionoftropicalforestintoagriculturalland,buttheharvestingofforestproductsisalsoimportantin\nsome regions. Globally, only about half of the original forest area remains.\nDuring 2013, the global consumption of wood averaged 3.6-billion cubic metres, representing a 1% increase\nfrom a decade earlier (Table 14.11). The wood consumption included the following:\n\u2022 0.96 x 109m3of sawn and veneer timber (a 7% decrease from 2004)\n\u2022 0.43 x 109m3of wood panels such as plywood (45% increase)\n\u2022 0.40 x 109m3of fibre such as pulpwood, used to make paper (12% increase)\n\u2022 1.70 x 109m3of industrial roundwood (no change)\n\u2022 1.88 x 109m3of fuelwood (2% increase; 90% was consumed in less-developed countries)\nIn Canada, an enormous industrial complex depends on the harvesting of forest biomass, largely for\nmanufacturingintolumber,compositematerialssuchasplywoodandwaferboard,andpulpandpaper.Thetotal\nvalue of products manufactured from forest resources in 2013 was $53-billion (Canadian Forest Service, 2014).\nMost of Canada\u2019s production of forest products is intended for export, providing foreign earnings that are\ncrucial to maintaining a positive balance of trade. In 2013, Canadian exports of forest products had a value of\n$33.7-billion, and the net contribution to the international balance of trade was $12.7-billion (this is the value\nof exports minus imports within the forestry sector (Canadian Forest Service, 2014). By comparison, Canada\u2019s\noverall balance of trade in 2012 was minus $6.7-billion, and it would have been worse without the positive\ncontributionoftheforestrysector(StatisticsCanada.2014g).Overall,Canadaistheworld\u2019sleadingexporterof\nforest products, accounting for 9% of global trade.\nFor comparison to the net earnings from the export of forest products ($12.7-billion), those of other key\neconomic sectors in Canada in 2013 were:\n\u2022 energy, +$69.6 billion\n\u2022 metals and minerals, +$20.2 billion\n\u2022 agriculture and fish, +$14.8 billion\n\u2022 automotive and aircraft, \u2013$14.4 billion\n\u2022 consumer goods, \u2013$45.5 billion\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 333 \u2022 industrial machinery, equipment, electronics, \u2013$52.5 billion\nOf course, to achieve the great economic benefits of forestry, large areas of mature forest must be harvested\neachyear.In2013,638-thousandhectaresofmatureforestwereharvested,whichisconsiderablylessthatthe\n1-million hectares that was the annual harvest from 1995 to 2006 (Natural Resources Canada, 2013). The large\ndecrease reflects a general downturn in global markets for forest commodities, especially for paper products.\nAbout 90% of the harvesting is by clear-cutting, and the rest by more selective methods. About 80% of the\nindustrial harvest was conifer trees (softwoods) and 20% broad-leafed trees (hardwoods). The area of forest\nharvested was equivalent to about 0.4% of the area of \u201cproductive\u201d forest of Canada (which is located in more\nsouthern regions and is relatively productive and accessible) and 0.2% of the total area of forest.\nAlmost all of the industrially harvested area in Canada is allowed to regenerate to forest. Deforestation,\nor long-term conversion to non-forest land-uses, is relatively uncommon in Canada. The recent amount of\ndeforestation has been about 46-thousand hectares per year (in 2010), of which agricultural conversions were\nresponsible for 41%, oil and gas activities for 24%, municipal conversions for 10%, forestry for 8%, industry\nfor 7%, road-building for 6%, and others the rest (Natural Resources Canada, 2013). However, it should be\nunderstood that much of the harvested forest is not regenerating well because it is poorly stocked with\ncommerciallyvaluabletreespecies.Forexample,about15%ofCrownlandharvestedsince1975isconsideredto\nbe understocked.\nIn addition, the regeneration of trees on most of the harvested area (this is known as reforestation) is\nencouraged by the planting of seedlings and other aspects of silvicultural management. In 2012, about 67% of\nthe harvested area was planted with tree seedlings. Many of the planted areas are managed quite intensively\nto develop tree plantations, a system that represents the application of an agricultural model to the growing\nof trees, also known as agroforestry. Tree farms are generally more productive of biomass than natural forest,\nbuttheylackmanyelementsofnativebiodiversityandotherecologicalandaestheticvalues(Chapter23).Other\naspects of intensive forestry management may include the thinning of overly dense tree regeneration, the use\nof herbicide to reduce the abundance of non-crop plants (or \u201cweeds\u201d), and the use of insecticide if there is an\nirruption of insects that threaten the tree cop, such as spruce budworm (Chapter 22).\nAlmost all the non-planted tracts of the harvested area (33% of the total) also regenerates back to forest.\nHowever, this occurs through a \u201cnatural regeneration\u201d of tree species. Natural regeneration may involve\nseedlings that existed on the site prior to harvesting and survived the disturbance (known as advanced\nregeneration), seedlings that established from seeds dispersed onto the site from nearby forest, or seeds\ndispersed by mature seed-trees left on the site.\nOverall, from the industrial perspective, forestry as it is practiced in Canada appears to be conserving its\nprimary economic resource \u2013 the area of forest and the productivity of tree biomass.

The\nexcessiveharvestingwascausedbyseveralfactors.Overtheyears,scientistshadestimatedthesizeand\nproductivity of cod stocks and their maximum sustainable yield (MSY).

This onslaught resulted in a rapid, and profitable,\ndepletion of whale stocks.\nWith only a few exceptions, whale populations were not over-harvested to extirpation, but rather to\ncommercial extinction \u2013 to a small population that was no longer profitable to find and kill.

More importantly, the major whaling nations were\nnot particularly co-operative, and the IWC was not aggressive in setting and enforcing quotas small enough\nto ensure that whale populations would not be depleted. These problems are to be expected whenever a for-\nprofitenterpriseisallowedtoregulateandpoliceitself.AccordingtoJ.L.McHugh,aformercommissionerand\nchairperson of the IWC, \u201cFrom the time of the first meeting of the Commission \u2026 almost all major actions\nor failures to act were governed by short-range economic considerations rather than by the requirements of\nconservation\u201d (cited in Ellis, 1991).\nBecause of its enormous size, with the largest males reaching 32 m and 136 tonnes, the blue whale\n(Balaenopteramusculus)wasinitiallythemostprofitablespeciesintheAntarcticseas.Theoriginalpopulation\nin those waters was about 180-thousand, and as many as 29-thousand were killed in a single year (Figure 14.2;\nnotethatduringtheSecondWorldWar,asfewas59animalswereharvestedinayear).Between1955and1962,\ndecliningstocksmeantanannualharvestofonly1-2-thousand.After1965,killingthisspecieswasprohibitedby\ntheIWC.Intotal,about331,000bluewhaleswerekilledinAntarcticwatersbetween1920and1965.Thepresent\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 343 Antarctic population of blue whales is fewer than 2,000, only about 1% of their initial abundance.

Some of these are wild resources that are harvested from natural ecosystems, while others are\nmanagedinagriculturalsystemstoachievehigheryields(includinginagroforestryandaquaculture).Ingeneral,\nCanada is rich in renewable natural resources, with a bountiful surplus of many of them available to export to\nothercountries.Nevertheless,Canadaalsoprovidescasesofthedepletionofpotentiallyrenewableresourcesby\nexcessive harvesting or inadequate management of the regeneration.\nQuestions for Review\n1. What is meant by a renewable natural resource? Explain the principle by referring to one of the following:\nsurface water and groundwater, agricultural site capability, timber, or a hunted animal.\n2. What are the most important renewable resources in Canada? Indicate, giving reasons, whether you think\nthose resources are being used in a sustainable manner.\n3. Use data on natural resources in Chapters 13 and 14 to develop a \u201cresource profile\u201d for the province or\nterritory where you live. Consider the relative importance of non-renewable and renewable resources in\nthe economy and the implications for longer-term sustainability.\n4. What are the criteria for ecological sustainability?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Identify a potentially renewable natural resource that has been over-harvested and depleted in your region.\nWhat are the reasons for the unsustainable use of the resource?\n2. Should relatively abundant species of whales (such as the minke) or harp seals be hunted? Your answer\nshould consider whether the species can be harvested in a sustainable manner, and should also address the\nethics of hunting wild animals.\n3. What are the political and economic problems of sharing water resources between countries or regions?\nChapter 14 ~ Renewable Resources | 349 4. Although food can be purchased in a store, it does not really come from there \u2013 it is actually harvested\nfrom wild ecosystems or is cultivated in agriculture. Consider the food that you eat and the ethical and\nenvironmental issues associated with its production. You may find this question to be particularly\ninteresting if you focus on meat, which is lethally harvested from millions of animals each year in Canada.\nExploring Issues\n1. The Minister of the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been asked to allow the resumption of\nwhale hunting in Canadian waters. The minister asks for your advice on the matter, and you decide to\ndevelop lists of benefits and damages that would occur if the hunting were allowed. Prepare these lists and\nexplain how each item relates to the ecological sustainability of a potential whale harvest.\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nAgriculture Canada. 2008.

Describe the environmental stressors, their causes, and how ecosystems respond to changes in their\nintensity.\n2. Explain the differences between contamination and pollution.\n3. Provide examples of natural stressors and explain how knowledge of them can help us understand\nanthropogenic stressors.\n4. Outline the differences among toxicology, environmental toxicology, and ecotoxicology.\n5. Explain the differences between voluntary and involuntary risks.\n6. Identify how a risk assessment is done of a predicted exposure to a toxic chemical.\nEnvironmental Stressors\nEnvironmental stressors (stressors) are factors whose influence is to constrain productivity, reproductive\nsuccess,andecosystemdevelopment(seeChapter9).Tosomedegree,stressorsaffectallorganismsaswellas\ntheir populations, communities, and ecoscapes (landscapes and seascapes). Stressors may be natural in origin,\nbeing associated with such environmental influences as:\n\u2022 competition, predation, disease, and other interactions among organisms\n\u2022 constraints related to climate or to inadequate or excessive nutrients, moisture, or space\n\u2022 disturbances such as wildfire and windstorms\nThe effects of natural stressors are not always negative. Some individuals, populations, and communities may\nbenefit from the effects of natural stress, even while others suffer a degree of damage.\nIncreasingly, however, stressors associated with human activities are the most critical influence on species\nandecosystems.Intoomanycases,anthropogenicstressorsarecausingimportantdamagetoresourcesthatare\nneeded to sustain people and their economy, and also to natural biodiversity and ecosystems.\nImage 15.1.

Freedman.\nEnvironmentalstressorsmayoccurasanintense,short-livedeventofdestruction,alsoknownasadisturbance.\nAlternatively,stressorsmayexerttheirinfluenceoveranextendedperiodoftime\u2013thatis,inachronicmanner.\nThe interaction of organisms with a stressor at a particular place and time is called exposure. Exposure can\nbe instantaneous or it may accumulate over time. If an exposure is intense enough, it will cause some sort\nof biological or ecological change, called a response, to occur. It is important to understand, however, that\nindividuals, populations, and communities are capable of tolerating a range of intensity of stressors without\nsuffering significant damage. In other words, certain thresholds of biological or ecological tolerance must be\nexceeded before damage is caused (Image 15.2).\nImage15.2.Stressorsareenvironmentalfactorsthataffectorganismsandecosystems.Theymayexistat\nvaryingintensitiesofexposure,asissuggestedbythemetaphorofawaterfaucet,whosedialifturned\nto the right will increase the flow of water, or decrease or stop it if turned the other way. For actual\nstressors, if a threshold of biological or ecological tolerance is exceeded, then a response will occur.\nSource: B. Freedman.\n356 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors Damage occurs when one or more stressors elicit responses that can be interpreted as a degradation of\nenvironmental quality. Such responses may include illness or death caused by an exposure of wild animals to\npesticides,orasareductionoftheproductivityofecosystems,ortheendangermentofvulnerableelementsof\nbiodiversity.Inthischapter,weexamineaconceptualframeworkforthestudyofdamagecausedbystressors.In\nthefollowing11chapters,wedealwithspecifickindsofstressorsandexaminecasestudiesofthekindofdamage\nthey may cause to occur.\nKinds of Stressors\nThe diverse kinds of environmental stressors are grouped into classes, although they are not entirely exclusive.\n\u2022 Physical stress is a disturbance in which there is an intense exposure to kinetic energy, which causes\ndamage to habitats and ecosystems. Examples include such disruptive events as a hurricane or tornado, a\nseismic sea wave (tsunami), the blast of a volcanic eruption, an explosion, or trampling by heavy machinery\nor hikers.\n\u2022 Wildfire is another disturbance, which involves the uncontrolled combustion of the biomass of an\necosystem. A wildfire can be ignited by people, or naturally by lightning. A severe fire consumes much of\nthe biomass of an ecosystem, but even a less-severe wildfire may kill many organisms by scorching and\npoisoning by toxic gases.\n\u2022 Chemical pollution occurs when one or more substances occur in a concentration high enough to elicit\nphysiological responses in organisms, potentially causing toxicity and ecological change. Chemical\nstressors include pesticides, gases such as ozone and sulphur dioxide, and toxic elements such as arsenic\nand mercury. Pollution may also be caused by excessive nutrients, which can distort productivity and other\necological functions. Note that the mere presence of a potentially toxic agent does not necessarily cause\npollution. (The distinction between contamination and pollution is examined later in this chapter.)\n\u2022 Thermal pollution is caused by the release of heat (thermal energy) into the environment, which results in\necological stress because species vary in their tolerance of temperature extremes. Thermal stress may\noccur at natural springs and submarine vents where geologically heated water is emitted. It is also\nassociated with discharges of hot water from power plants.\n\u2022 Radiation stress is caused by excessive exposure to ionizing energy. The radiation may be emitted by\nnuclear waste or explosions, or it can be diagnostic X-rays or solar ultraviolet energy.\n\u2022 Climatic stress is associated with insufficient or excessive regimes of temperature, moisture, solar\nradiation, wind, or combinations of these.\n\u2022 Biological stressors are associated with interactions occurring among organisms, such as competition,\nherbivory, predation, parasitism, and disease. For example, individuals of the same or different species may\ncompete for essential resources that are limited in supply. Herbivory, predation, parasitism, and disease are\ntrophic interactions, in which one species exploits another. Exploitation can be anthropogenic, as when\nhumans harvest wild animals or trees, or it can be natural, perhaps associated with defoliating insects or\ndisease-causing pathogens.\n\u2022 Biological pollution occurs when people release organisms beyond their natural range. This might involve\nthe introduction of alien species that invade and alter natural habitats, or it may be the release of\npathogens into the environment through discharges of raw sewage.\nImage15.3.Biological\u201cpollution\u201discausedwhenspeciesareintroducedintohabitatsbeyondtheirnatural\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 357 range,wheretheymaycauseecologicaldamage.Thisnon-nativelupine(Lupinuspolyphyllus)hasbeen\nintroduced to eastern Canada, where it thrives in gardens and along roadsides. Although an attractive\nwildflower, it displaces indigenous plants. Source: B. Freedman.\nEcological Responses\nAn ecosystem that has been affected by a disturbance typically suffers mortality among its species, along\nwithdamagetoitsstructuralproperties(suchasspeciescompositionandbiomassdistribution)andfunctional\nattributes(suchasproductivityandnutrientcycling).Oncethedisturbanceeventisover,aprocessofrecovery\nthrough succession begins. If the succession proceeds for a long enough time, it will restore another mature\necosystem, perhaps one similar to that existing before the disturbance.\nChronicstressorsoperateoverlongerperiodsoftime(ratherthanasevents),andtheyincludeclimaticfactors\nand many kinds of chemical and thermal pollution. Depending on the intensity of exposure, organisms may\nsufferacutetoxicityresultingintissuedamageorevendeath,oraless-obviouschronicdamagethatresultsin\ndecreased productivity.\nExposure to a higher intensity of environmental stressors can result in evolutionary changes if individual\norganisms vary in their tolerance and those differences are genetically based.

The niches of those species may then be occupied by more tolerant members of\nthe community, or by invading species that are capable of exploiting a stressful but weakly competitive habitat.\nAprolongedintensificationofstresswillcauselonger-termecologicalchangetooccur.Consider,forexample,\na case in which a new metal smelter is constructed in a forested landscape.

Source: B. Freedman.\nContamination and Pollution\nPollution is caused by an exposure to chemicals or energy at an intensity that exceeds the tolerance of\norganisms. As such, pollution is judged to have occurred when it can be shown that organisms have suffered\ntoxicity, or other kinds of ecological damage can be demonstrated. Pollution can affect humans and other\nspecies, as well as communities and ecoscapes. Pollution is often caused by an exposure to chemicals in large\nenoughconcentrationstopoisonatleastsomeorganisms.However,pollutioncanalsobecausedbynon-toxic\nexposures,suchastheexcessivefertilizationofawaterbody,areleaseofwasteheatintotheenvironment,orthe\ndischarge of raw sewage containing pathogens.\nContamination refers to those much more common situations in which potentially damaging stressors are\npresent in the environment, but at an intensity too low to cause measureable damage. For instance, a certain\nchemicalmayoccurinahigherconcentrationthanisnormallyencounteredintheenvironment.However,ifits\nconcentrationistoolowtocausemeasurabletoxicitytoatleastsomeorganisms,ortoaffectotherecological\ncomponents or processes, the chemical is a contaminant rather than a pollutant.\n360 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors Infact,metalssuchasaluminum,cadmium,lead,mercury,andzincarepresentinallpartsoftheenvironment,\nincluding all organisms, in at least a trace concentration.

People decide whether pollution\nis causing \u201cdamage\u201d at some place and time, and how important the effects might be. This anthropocentric\nbiastends,quitenaturally,tofavourhumansandthosespecies,communities,andecosystemfunctionsthatare\nrecognized as supporting the human economy, or may be appreciated for other reasons, such as aesthetics.\nInterestingly, certain species, communities, and ecological processes will actually benefit from most kinds\nof pollution. For example, particular species may take advantage of ecological opportunities made available\nwhenpollutionreducestheabundanceofapreviouslydominantspecies.Manyofthecasestudiesdescribedin\nfollowingchaptersinvolvesituationsinwhichopportunisticspeciesofplants,animals,andmicroorganismshave\nbenefited from ecological changes caused by pollution.\nPollution Can Be Natural\nPollution is not only caused by human activities \u2013 in some cases, it is a purely natural phenomenon. \u201cNatural\u201d\nsourcesofpollutionincludeemissionsofparticulatesandgasessuchassulphurdioxidefromvolcanoes,seeps\nof petroleum on the ocean floor, high concentrations of metals in certain soils and rocks, and the heat of\ngeothermal springs. Natural pollution may cause severe ecological changes (which humans may view as being\na kind of damage). The effects can be as intense as those caused by anthropogenic pollution. Nevertheless,\nalthoughthefactofnaturalpollutionisinterestingandwellrecognized,itdoesnotjustifyhumanactivitiesthat\ncause similar kinds of damage.\nStudiesoftheecologicaleffectsofnaturalpollutioncanprovideinsightintothepotentiallonger-termeffects\nof anthropogenic emissions. This is because many examples of natural pollution are ancient, and the resulting\npatterns of ecological change may be similar to those caused by more recent anthropogenic emissions.\nOneinterestingexampleoccursattheSmokingHillsintheNorthwestTerritories.Thisisaremotewilderness,\nand is little influenced by people.

The natural pollution has severely damagedterrestrial\nand aquatic habitats of the tundra at the Smoking Hills (see Chapter 16).\nAnother example of natural pollution occurs when metal-rich minerals occur close to the surface of the\nground, which results in toxic conditions for vegetation.

Freedman.\n362 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors Disturbance\nA disturbance is an episodic but intense disruption that causes severe biological and ecological damage. An\nevent of disturbance is followed by a sometimes lengthy period of ecological recovery through the process\nknown as succession. There are two broad types of disturbances: community-replacing disturbances and\nmicrodisturbances.\n\u2022 A community-replacing disturbance is extensive in scale and results in a catastrophic destruction of one or\nmore original communities. Natural examples are caused by wildfire, windstorm, avalanche, and glaciation,\nwhile anthropogenic ones include clear-cutting and ploughing. These large-scale disturbances may be\nfollowed by a successional recovery that eventually regenerates a community similar to what was\ndestroyed. Younger communities in the successional sequence (or sere) are relatively dynamic in their\nstructural and functional properties. They are typically dominated by species that are abundant only during\nthe initial stages of recovery, when competition is not so intense. Community changes in later stages are\nsomewhat less dynamic, until a late-stage community is re-established.\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 363 \u2022 A microdisturbance involves a local disruption that only affects a small area within an otherwise intact\ncommunity. Anthropogenic microdisturbances include the selective harvesting of individual large trees or\nparticular animals, while leaving the community otherwise intact. Ecological changes are relatively rapid\nwithin a habitat patch that has been affected by a recent microdisturbance, but at the stand level the\ncommunity is stable. So-called patch- or gap-phase successional dynamics occur in all natural forests but\nare particularly important during the later stages of succession. This is especially the case in older-growth\nforest, where individual trees might die from disease, insect attack, or a lightning strike, creating a gap in\nan otherwise intact canopy.\nNatural Disturbance\nDisturbance is a natural force that affects all ecosystems. For example, a wildfire may kill mature trees over\na large area, but that event of destruction is followed by regeneration through succession. Fire is common in\nthe boreal forest and in drought-prone ecosystems such as prairie and savannah. On average, about 2-million\nhectaresofforestburnseachyearinCanada,mostlyinfiresstartedbylightning.Wildfiretransformsthehabitat\nconditionsandalsocausesseverepollutionbytheemissionofparticulatesandgasessuchascarbondioxideand\nnitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.\nOthernaturalagentsofdisturbanceincludehurricanes,tornadoes,floods,andevenglaciation(overgeological\ntime). These also cause large-scale ecological damage, which is followed by successional recovery. After\nglaciation, which involves prolonged burial and abrasion of the land by an enormous mass of ice, the post-\nmelting recovery is initiated by immigrating organisms that colonize the raw landscape.\nAvolcaniceruptionorearthquakecangenerateoneormoredevastatingoceanicwaves,ortsunamis.In1883,\nthecataclysmiceruptionofthevolcanicislandofKrakatauinIndonesiacreateda30-mtsunamiwavethatkilled\nabout 36-thousand people.

About 2-5 million tonnes of SO2 (expressed as the sulphur content, or SO2-S) are emitted by\nvolcanoes in a typical year, and an individual eruption may emit more than 1-million tonnes. This natural SO2\ncontributes to the acidification of precipitation and to other environmental damage (Chapter 19).\nNatural population outbreaks (irruptions) of herbivores, predators, or pathogens can also result in intense\ndamagetonaturalhabitats.Forinstance,thesprucebudworm(Choristoneurafumiferana)periodicallydefoliates\nhuge areas of conifer forest in eastern Canada (more than 55 million hectares in 1975). This causes extensive\nmortalityoffirandsprucetreesandotherecologicaldamages(Chapter22).Arecentoutbreakofthemountain\npine-beetle(Dendroctonusponderosae)hascausedsimilarlyextensivedamagetopineforestsinwesternCanada\nand the northwestern U.S., with about 36-million ha affected.

Afterthepopulationofseaurchinscollapses, thekelpforestquickly\nre-establishes.\nMicrodisturbances are also a common feature of natural ecosystems. Examples of these smaller-scale\ndisturbances include the deaths of individual large trees within an otherwise intact forest, perhaps caused by\ndisease or an accident (such as a lightning strike). This creates a natural gap in the canopy, beneath which a\nmicrosuccessionoccursasplantscompetetotakeadvantageoftemporaryresourceopportunitiessuchasextra\nlight.Thefoliageofmaturetreeseventuallyfillsthegap.Similarly,thedeathofanindividualcoralheadwithinan\notherwise intact reef initiates a microsuccession within that marine ecosystem.\nEcologists try to understand the effects of natural disturbances and to apply that knowledge to design\nmanagement systems that allow resources to be harvested or otherwise used while controlling the resulting\necologicaldamage.Forexample,understandingthecharacteristicsofgap-phasedisturbancesinanold-growth\nforestcanaidinthedesignofaselectiveharvestingsystemthatemulatesthenaturaldisturbanceregime.The\nuseofthatkindofsystemwillleavethephysicalandecologicalintegrityoftheforestsubstantiallyintact,even\nwhile individual trees are periodically harvested for commercial use.

However,\nclear-cutting might be an appropriate practice to use when harvesting forest that is adapted to community-\nreplacing disturbances, such as wildfire or insect outbreaks (see Chapters 22 and 23).\nAnthropogenic Disturbance\nHumans also disturb ecosystems in diverse ways, many examples of which are described in the following\nchapters.Anthropogenicdisturbancesareassociatedwithmanyactivities,suchastheconversionofecosystems,\nthe harvesting of natural resources, introductions of alien species, construction of roads and buildings, and\nwarfare.\nTheharvestingofbothrenewableandnon-renewableresourcesalwayscausesdisturbancestoecosystems.So\ndoesthepost-harvestmanagementofrenewableresources.Forinstance,intensedisturbanceiscausedbystrip-\nminingthesurfaceforcoaloroil-sand.Similarly,harvestingaforestbyclear-cuttingrepresentsacommunity-\nreplacing disturbance, which is followed by regeneration through succession.

This may represent a kind of gap-phase disturbance.\nThe conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural or urbanized land-uses also represents a severe\ndisturbance. In these cases, the successional recovery is closely managed to foster the development of an\nanthropogenic ecosystem. Usually, the habitats are dominated by alien species of plants and animals, and\nsometimes by the bricks and concrete of the built environment. These conversions displace almost all of the\noriginal native species and natural communities.\nPeople have deliberately or accidentally introduced many species beyond their natural range. Often, the\nintroducedaliensbecomeinvasiveofnaturalhabitats,inthesenseofdisplacingnativespeciesandcausingother\nkinds of ecological damage. North American examples include the introduction of zebra mussels (Dreissena\npolymorpha) into the Great Lakes, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) into wetlands, and starlings (Sturnus\nvulgaris) and domestic pigeons (rock doves, Columba livia) into urban areas.\nWarfarealsoproducesawiderangeofcommunity-replacingandmicrodisturbancesthroughexplosions,the\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 365 passageofheavyvehiclesoverthelandscape,spillsoffuelandothertoxicchemicals,huntingtoprovidefoodfor\nlargenumbersofsoldiers,andeven(asoccurredduringtheVietnamWar)extensivesprayingofherbicideonto\nforest and agricultural areas.\nAnthropogenic Stressors in Context\nTo summarize, pollution and disturbance can be natural phenomena.

These\nconsiderations are examined below:\nIn Detail 15.1. What Is Toxicity? In the biological sense, a chemical can poison an organism if it\ndetrimentallyaffectssomeaspectofitsmetabolism.Thiseffectiscalledtoxicity.Atoxicchemicalmay,\nfor example, disrupt the functioning of an enzyme system or interfere with cellular division. However,\nthe legal definition of toxic substance, as stated by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, is as\nfollows: \u201cA substance is defined as toxic if it enters or may enter the environment in a quantity or\nconcentrationorunderconditionsthat:(1)haveormayhaveanimmediateorlong-termharmfuleffect\n366 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors ontheenvironment;(2)constituteormayconstituteadangertotheenvironmentonwhichhumanlife\ndepends; or (3) constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.\u201d\nThisdefinitionhaslegalstandinginCanada,anditisusedinthemanagementandregulationofawide\nvariety of chemicals.\nHowever, this definition is inadequate in some important respects, particularly because it deals only\nwithextremelytoxicchemicals,underconditionsinwhichtheyoccurinhighconcentrations.Substances\nwhoseacutetoxicityislessmaycausesubtle,long-termdamagetopeople,otherspecies,andimportant\necological values. These kinds of exposures are not dealt with by this definition.\n1.

Chronic toxicity involves a longer-term exposure to low to moderate concentrations of a chemical.\nOvertime,chronicexposuresmaycausebiochemicaloranatomicaldamage,orperhapsalethalconditionsuch\nas cancer.\nData in Table 15.1 illustrate the sensitivities of a number of species to the extremely toxic chemical, TCDD\n(2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin).TCDDhasnoindustrialormedicinaluses,butitisincidentallysynthesized\nduring high-temperature combustions in incinerators, during forest fires, in the chlorine bleach whitening\nprocess for wood pulp, and in the manufacturing of certain industrial chemicals, particularly trichlorophenol,\nwhich is used to produce the herbicide 2,4,5-T and the antibacterial agent hexachlorophene. These syntheses\ncanresultintheemissionofTCDDintotheenvironment,wherehumansandotherorganismsmaybeexposed.\nBecause of its toxicological notoriety, TCDD and its chemical relatives are relatively well-studied substances.\nThe data in Table 15.1 suggest that species differ greatly in their sensitivity to TCDD. Among the species for\nwhichdataareavailable,theguineapigisespeciallyvulnerabletoTCDD,whereashamstersandfrogsarelessso.\nSensitivity to chemicals also varies with the route of exposure and with the sex and age of animals.\nTable 15.1.

Oral exposure involves ingestion into the stomach; dermal exposure consist of\nabsorptionthroughtheskin;intraperitonealexposureinvolvesinjectionintotheabdominalcavity.LD50\n(lethal dose for 50% mortality) is the dose that kills half of a population of experimental animals.

Exposure to any potentially toxic chemical is affected by\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 369 manyfactors,includingenvironmentalinfluences.Forexample,theexposureofamouseinanagriculturalfield\nsprayedwithan insecticide could be affectedby such factors as the spray rate, kind of equipmentbeing used,\nweather, persistence of the chemical (how long it remains active), and the behaviour and choices of food and\nhabitatofthemouse.Ifatoxicologistisevaluatingtheexposureofpeopletopotentiallytoxicsubstances,there\nwouldbeaconsiderationoftheamountingestedwithsolidandliquidfood,theintakewhilebreathing,andthe\namounts present in both working and ambient (or non-occupational) environments.\n4. Indirect Effects\nAlso important in ecotoxicology are the indirect effects of toxic chemicals, or effects other than the direct\npoisoning of organisms. Indirect effects are most commonly associated with changes in habitat or in the\nconditionoftheimmunesystemofanorganism.Insomecases,indirectdamageisworsethanthedirecttoxic\neffectsofchemicals.Forinstance,theuseofaherbicideinforestrycauseschangesinvegetation,whichaffects\nanimals that live in the habitat, even if the herbicide itself is not directly toxic to them.\nAll Chemicals Are Toxic\nTheabovediscussionsuggeststhatifanexposureisintenseenough,evenroutinelyencounteredchemicalsmay\nbepoisonous.Infact,evenwatercanbetoxicifapersondrinksenoughinashortperiodoftime.Thishappens\nbecause the physiological capacity to regulate salts in the blood plasma can be overwhelmed by drinking too\nmuch water too quickly, causing a toxic syndrome called hyponatremia. Depending on body weight, the lethal\ndoseforanadultis5-10L,ingestedoveranhourorless.Similarly,ifthedoseislargeenough,carbondioxide,\ntable sugar (sucrose), table salt (sodium chloride), Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), drinking alcohol (ethanol), and\nother routinely ingested chemicals can cause poisoning (Table 15.3).\nThisfundamentalruleofbiologywasfirstemphasizedbyPhilipvonParacelsus(1493-1541),aSwissphysician\nand alchemist who is considered to be the father of \u201cmodern\u201d toxicology. One of his most famous conclusions\ncan be paraphrased as \u201cDosage determines poisoning.\u201d\nIn perhaps all cases, there are thresholds of tolerance to potentially toxic chemicals. The tolerance occurs\nbecause organisms have physiological mechanisms to excrete toxins from the body, to metabolize them into\nless-toxic substances, or to sequester (store) them in certain body tissues where they will not cause damage.\nOrganismsalsohavemechanismstorepairdamagecausedtotissuesorbiochemicalsystems,providingthatthe\nchemicalexposuresarenottoohighandexcessivelydamaging.Forachemicaltocausetoxicity,thecapacities\nof these physiological systems must be overwhelmed.\nInterpretation of Damage\nThe notion of physiological thresholds of tolerance helps to define the difference between contamination and\npollution, which we examined previously. The idea of thresholds also indicates why it is best to frame the\ndiscussion in terms of \u201cpotentially\u201d toxic exposures to chemicals. This is especially the case when the actual\nenvironmental concentrations are not known, and when the biological risks of extremely small doses are not\n370 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors sufficientlyunderstood.However,thenotionofbiologicalthresholdsoftoleranceissomewhatcontroversial,and\nnotalltoxicologistswouldagreewiththeexplanationjustgiven.Thosescientistsbelievethatexposuretoeven\noneorafewmoleculesofsomekindsofchemicalsmaybeoftoxicologicalimportance.Thisisparticularlytrueof\nchemicalsthatarethoughttobecarcinogenicatextremelysmallexposures,andalsoofradionuclidesandhighly\nenergetic forms of ionizing energy, such as X-rays and gamma radiation.\nOften, the risks to humans exposed to chemicals are interpreted differently from those of other species,\nparticularlywildanimalsandplants.Thisisbecausetheprevailingculturalattitudesplacemuchgreatervalueon\nthelifeandhealthofindividualpeoplethanonthoseofotherspecies.Assuch,thereisaspecialreluctance,both\nsocial and regulatory, to permit human exposures to many kinds of potentially toxic chemicals.\nHowever, regulations and guidelines tend to be considerably less strict for human exposures that occur\nin a workplace, as compared with non-occupational exposures. This recognizes the fact that considerable\nrisks are inherent in the activities and environmental conditions of many occupations. Particularly significant\nhazardsconfrontfirefighters,policeofficers,membersofthearmedforces,operatorsofheavymachinery,and\nworkersinchemicalindustries.Withinlimits,chemicalexposuresassociatedwithearningalivingaregenerally\ninterpreted as a \u201ccost of doing business\u201d, and may therefore be judged to be acceptable.\nSuch attitudes can, however, change markedly over time. Certain occupational hazards that were once\nconsidered routine and tolerable are now viewed as unacceptable. For instance, when synthetic organic\ninsecticides, such as DDT, were first introduced in the mid-1940s and 1950s, people were remarkably casual\naboutusingthem.Workersoftenappliedtheseinsecticideswithonlyminimalattentiontoavoidingexposureto\nthemselvesandothers.Suchpoorlycontrolledusageswouldbeunthinkabletoday,especiallyinrelativelywell-\nregulated countries such as Canada.\nInaddition,manypeoplewillinglychoosetoexposethemselvestotoxicologicallysignificantdosesofcertain\nchemicals.Thesechoicesincludetakinguphazardousoccupations,smokingcigarettes,andingestingmedicines\nandrecreationaldrugs.Theconsequencesofthesesortsof\u201cvoluntary\u201dexposuresareinterpretedusingcriteria\nthat are different from those applied to \u201cinvoluntary\u201d ones.\nIfchemicalscausetoxicitytospeciesotherthanhumans,theimportanceofthateffectisinterpretedonthe\nbasis of the following considerations:\n\u2022 Are measurable changes seen in the populations of affected species? From an ecological perspective,\npopulation-level damage is the most important consideration, even while it is acknowledged that the death\nof an individual organism is regrettable. Populations of all species have a certain degree of resilience and\ncan tolerate some mortality caused by toxic chemicals without suffering an overall decline.\n\u2022 Are affected species important in maintaining the integrity of their community? Ecological philosophies\nsuggest that all species have intrinsic value. Nevertheless, species do vary greatly in their contribution to\nthe functioning and structure of their community. So-called keystone species have a dominant influence\n(Chapter 9). Substantial changes in their abundance should be judged as relatively important compared\nwith damage inflicted on more minor species.\n\u2022 Is the damage of economic importance? This consideration involves damage to resources that are needed\nby humans and therefore have economic value. In this sense, damage is judged to be relatively important if\nit is caused to hunted animals such as deer or trout, to trees that can be harvested to manufacture pulp or\nlumber, or to vital ecological services such as the provision of clean water and air. From a purely utilitarian\nperspective, damage caused to non-economic values, both species and services, may be viewed as being\nless important.\n\u2022 Other considerations, less tangible than those just mentioned, involve appraising damage in aesthetic or\nethical terms. These considerations are also important, but they are difficult to interpret in terms of risks\nor benefits to human welfare. As a result, aesthetic or ethical considerations are rarely reflected in\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 371 regulatory criteria or in the management of potentially toxic chemicals in the environment.\nEnvironmental Risks\nBroadlyinterpreted,environmentalrisksarehazards\u2013alikelihoodofsufferingdamageormisfortuneasaresult\nof exposure to a biological or environmental circumstance.

Remarkably\nlittle is known, however, about the specific environmental and biological factors that predispose organisms to\ndeveloping various types of cancer.

A\nriskassessmentmayquantifythethreatstopeople,aswellastootherspeciesandtobroaderecologicalvalues.\nA risk assessment requires knowledge of three factors:\n1. the likelihood of encountering the hazard\n2. the likely intensity of the hazard\n3. the biological damage that is likely to result from the predicted exposure\nAmeteorologist,forexample,maypredicttheprobabilitythataparticularplacewillbestruckbylightningunder\nvariousweatherconditions.Thelikelihoodismuchgreaterduringathunderstormthanduringsunnyconditions,\nandisgreaterbeneathalargetreeinanopenfieldthanbesideashrubinaditch.Theenergycontentofatypical\nlightningstrikeisalsoknown,asisthebiologicaldamagetoapersonwhomightbestruck.Withthisinformation,\nit is relatively straightforward to model the risks of a lightning-caused injury associated with standing in the\nmiddle of an open field, or under a tree in that same field, on a sunny day or during a thunderstorm. This\nis a simple example of an environmental risk assessment. A risk assessment for potentially toxic exposures\nto chemicals can be conducted for individual organisms, for populations, or for ecological functions such as\nproductivity,decomposition,andnutrientcycling.Toassesstherisksassociatedwithexposuretochemicals,one\nrequires knowledge of two factors: the intensity of exposure (the anticipated dose) and the biological damage\nthatislikelytobecausedbythepredictedexposure.Theintegrationofthesetwotypesofinformationisknown\nas a dose-response relationship (Figure 15.1).\nFigure 15.1.

The exposure to pollution can then be related to the pattern of\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 379 ecologicaldamagethatmaybeobservedalongthegradientoftoxicstress.Patternsofpollutionandecological\ndamage around a large smelter near Sudbury are one example of such a relationship (see Chapters 16 and 18).\nAn exposure assessment investigates all of the ways by which organisms may encounter a potentially toxic\nlevelofachemical.Forexample,humansmaybeexposedtomercurythroughvariouspathways,eachofwhich\ncan be quantified (either measured or calculated using a predictive model). The principal avenues of exposure\ninclude:inhalingmercuryvapourpresentintheatmosphere,ingestingmercurydissolvedindrinkingwater,and\nconsumingthemetalinfoodstuffs,especiallyincertainkindsoffishandanimalorgans.Alsoincludedamongthe\nprincipalavenuesofexposurearemiscellaneoussourcessuchascertainpigmentsusedinceramicsandpaints,\nand mercury-amalgam dental fillings.\nThe assimilation rate of a chemical into the bloodstream and organs varies greatly among the exposure\npathways. Assimilation depends on several factors, including the metabolic characteristics of the organ into\nwhich the chemical is being absorbed, such as the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, or the skin. The physical-\nchemicalformofthesubstancealsoaffectsitsuptakedynamics.Forinstance,mercurycanoccurasanelemental\nvapourorliquid,asinorganiccompoundssuchasmercuricchloride,andasorganomercurialcomplexessuchas\nmethylmercury(anespeciallybioavailableandpoisonouscompound).Thetotalexposureforapersonisthesum\nof the chemicals assimilated through all pathways, which typically vary greatly in their effect.\nTherelativeimportanceofvarious sources ofachemicaldepends tosome extenton aperson\u2019slifestyle and\noccupation.Theseinfluencehowoftenandtowhatdegreethevarioussourcesareencountered.Dentalworkers,\nforexample,maycomeintocontactwithmercuryvapoursbecausethismetalissometimesusedtomakefillings.\nIn addition, a diet rich in certain species of large oceanic fish, such as halibut, shark, swordfish, and tuna, is\nrelativelyrichinmercury(seeChapter18).Therefore,bothdentalworkersandbig-fishconsumersmayhavea\nhigher risk of mercury exposure.\nOnce an exposure assessment has been undertaken, the biological hazards can be predicted on the basis\nof known dose-response relationships. Unfortunately, dose-response information is often incomplete, or even\nlacking. For instance, most hypotheses about potential dose-response relationships in humans are actually\ninferred from research that has been conducted in laboratories using other mammals, such as dogs, mice,\nmonkeys,pigs, andrats.These specieshavephysiological,anatomical,andbehaviouralcharacteristics thatare\nbroadlysimilartothoseofhumans,buttheyalsodifferinimportantrespects.Consequently,mostassessments\nof human exposure to trace levels of environmental chemicals are inaccurate.\nIn addition, the information about dose-response relationships is almost non-existent for wild species and\nfor ecological functions such as productivity and nutrient cycling. As with human-focused assessments, it is\ncommon to use data for surrogate (or proxy) species, which are believed to be typical in their dose responses.\nForexample,astudymaybeundertakentopredictthepotentialeffectsofinputsofparticularchemicalstoa\ncertainlake.Itishighlyunlikelythatrelevantdose-responsedatawillbeavailableforthespeciesoffishinthe\necosystem.Consequently,predictionswilltypicallybemadeusinginformationforproxyspecies,suchasrainbow\ntrout (Salvelinus gairdneri) or fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).

This is especially true if the potential effects are being\npredicted of chemical exposures in a natural environmental context. Such risk assessments are, however, the\nbest that can be done under most circumstances because there is rarely enough funding or time to do more\ncomprehensivestudies.Nevertheless,becausethesemethodsdeliberatelyoverestimatethepotentialrisks,they\nprovide conservative guidance for management purposes.\n380 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors InDetail15.2.Mutagens,Teratogens,andHormoneMimicsMutagens,teratogens,andhormonallyactive\nsubstances are trace chemicals and other agents that are present in the environment and have the\npotentialtoaffectthegeneticsormetabolismofanimalswhenpresentinminuteconcentrations.They\nmay be naturally present or associated with anthropogenic emissions. Relatively intense exposures of\nwild animals to these agents may occurin aquatic habitats thatare affectedby effluentfrom factories,\nsewage,orpesticide-treatedfields.Humanexposuresareassociatedwithsmoking(includinginvoluntary\nexposures), eating fatty meats (especially if barbequed) and some other foods, and living in an urban\nenvironment that is generally polluted with a range of substances.\nA mutagen is a substance or agent that induces a genetic mutation, meaning a change in the coding\nsequence of nucleic acids in DNA or RNA. Exposure to mutagens may result in mutations that are\n\u201charmless,\u201d meaning the genetic change is not known to result in a serious biochemical consequence.\nIn other cases, however, a mutation may result in a deformity or disease, such as many kinds of\ncancer.Acancermaybeanendpointofmutationsoccurringinbody(somatic)cells,whilemutationsof\nsperm and egg cells may result in heritable changes that can be passed to offspring. An environmental\nmutagen is one that is encountered in the environment. Incidents of genotoxicity have been observed\nin wild animals, such as occurrences of fish tumours and frogs born with excess limbs. In humans,\ngenotoxicity may be associated with some kinds of cancer and with congenital birth defects, which\nnormallyoccurinabout3%ofbirths.Genotoxocitymaybecausedbyexposuretovariouschemicalsand\notheragents.Potentmutagensthatareusedinbiomedicalresearchincludeethylmethanesulfonateand\nnitrosoguanidine. Other sources of laboratory and environmental genotoxicity include the following:\n\u2022 highly energetic (ionizing) radiation associated with ultraviolet-B, X-rays, and gamma radiation\n\u2022 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)pyrene\n\u2022 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and certain pesticides\n\u2022 methyl mercury and some other metals\n\u2022 aflatoxin present in mouldy nuts and grains\n\u2022 dimethyl nitrosamine present in nitrite-treated foods\n\u2022 diesel exhaust\n\u2022 effluent from pulp mills\n\u2022 tobacco and barbecue smoke\nA teratogen is an agent that induces abnormal development of an embryo or fetus. It may act through\nmutagenicity or by some other means, such as physical irritation of cells or tissues. A famous example\nof teratogenic damage was caused by thalidomide, a medication that was prescribed as a sedative to\npregnantwomenfrom1950-1961.Thalidomideprovedtobecapableofcrossingtheplacentaandcaused\ndevastatinglimbabnormalities(extremeshorteningorabsenceoflimbs)inthefetus,anditsmedicaluse\nresulted in an epidemic of seriously deformed children.

Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the circulatory\nsystemuntiltheyreachspecificreceptorcellsintargetorgans,wheretheyregulatephysiology.Theyare\nproducedintheendocrinesystem,whichconsistsofvariousglands,suchastheadrenalgland,ovaries,\npancreas, pituitary gland, testes, and thyroid gland. Hormones help to regulate growth, development,\nChapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors | 381 metabolism,depositionoffat,maintenanceoftheelectrolytebalanceinfluids,sexuality,andbehavioural\nresponses to external stimuli (such as excitement and fright). Examples of hormones include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which are adrenal hormones that\nstimulate the body to react to a stressful condition by increasing the blood pressure, blood sugar,\nand heart rate (this is sometimes known as a \u201cflight or fight\u201d response)\n\u2022 estrogen,afemalesexhormoneproducedbytheovaries,andandrogens,malehormonesproduced\nby the testes\n\u2022 insulin, formed by the pancreas to regulate the use and storage of carbohydrates (including blood\nsugar)\n\u2022 thyroid hormone, which influences the growth and metabolism of virtually all body cells\nBecause hormones are necessary for healthy physiology, development, and behaviour, any serious\ndisruptionoftheiractivitycanhavesevereconsequencesfororganisms.Somechemicalspresentinthe\nenvironment, including natural ones and others that are anthropogenic, can cause such interference\nand are known as hormone mimics. For example, certain plants contain so-called phytoestrogens that\ncan affect the hormone physiology of animals feeding upon them. Examples of plants with relatively\nhighlevelsofphytoestrogensincludesoybean(Glycinemax),redclover(Trifoliumpratense),flax(Linum\nvulgare),andblackcohosh(Cimicifugaracemosa).Somewomenuseherbalpreparationsoftheseplants\ntorelievesymptomsofmenopause.Othernaturalphytoestrogenshavebeenusedinbirth-controlpills\nto control human fertility.\nManyothersubstancespresentintheenvironmentarealsohormonallyactive,includingawidearray\nofchemicalsreleasedbyhumanactivities.Evenatextremelysmallexposures,theymaymimicorblock\ntheactionofcertainhormones,resultinginaphysiologicalchange.Thismayhavedetrimentaleffectson\nwildanddomesticanimalsandalsoonpeople.Thefollowinganthropogenicchemicalsarethoughttobe\nhormonally active through environmental exposures:\n\u2022 organochlorines, including dioxins (such as TCDD), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the\ninsecticides DDT, dieldrin, and lindane\n\u2022 other kinds of pesticides, including atrazine, permethrin, and trifluralin\n\u2022 tributyltin, which is used as a marine antifoulant\n\u2022 alkylphenols used as surfactants, such as nonylphenol\n\u2022 certain placticizers, such as dibutyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate\n\u2022 naturalhormonesandsyntheticsteroidsfromcontraceptivesthatarereleasedtotheenvironment\nin sewage or occur as residues in food, including estradiol, estrone, and testosterone\n\u2022 phytoestrogens in pulp-mill effluents, including coumestans, isoflavones, and lignans\nThe biological effects of environmental mutagens, teratogens, and hormonally active substances are\nnot yet well understood. Although the presence of many of these agents in the environment has been\nwidely noted, scientists do not yet know the level of contamination at which an unacceptable amount\nof biological damage may result. This has resulted in controversy about the potential effects of these\nbioactive chemicals on wild animals and humans: some people recommend a highly precautionary\napproach,whileothersbelievethatmoreevidenceofconsequentialdamageisneededbeforestringent\ncontrol practices are implemented. Although there are observations of some local populations of wild\nanimals suffering significant damage, there is not yet convincing evidence of effects on people from\n382 | Chapter 15 ~ Environmental Stressors environmental exposures to these agents. Of course, any significant level of genetic or developmental\ndamage to humans would be deemed to be unacceptable.\nReferences: Phillips and Venitt (1995), Machachlan and Guillet (2002), Servos et al.

Other stressors operate by causing toxicity, as when organisms are exposed to\nsolar ultraviolet radiation or to pesticides. Environmental risks are associated with exposure to a wide variety\nof factors in the environment. A major activity in environmental science is the study of these risks and the\nprediction of their effects on people, other species, and ecosystems.\nQuestions for Review\n1.

Outline the major sources of emission of air pollutants associated with sulphur, nitrogen, and\nhydrocarbons.\n2. Explain the difference between primary and secondary pollutants.\n3. Contrast the environmental problems associated with stratospheric and tropospheric ozone.\n4. Examine the importance of air pollutants to ecosystems and to human health.\n5. Outline the lessons to be learned from natural pollution at the Smoking Hills.\n6. Describe the patterns of pollution and ecological damage near point sources of air pollution.\nIntroduction\nGaseous air pollutants are emitted from various natural sources, such as volcanoes and forest fires. However,\nanthropogenic emissions of some gases may be greater than the natural ones, and are increasing because of\npopulation growth and industrialization.\nInancienttimes,therewasnotmuchpollution.Nevertheless,eventhenlocalproblemswouldhaveoccurred.\nForinstance,smokywoodfiresusedforcookingandwarmthwouldlikelyhavecausedpoor-qualityairtooccur\ninside of badly ventilated dwellings. Hunting cultures often used fire to drive game animals and improve local\nforage, and those burns would have resulted in large emissions of particulate carbon (soot), carbon dioxide,\nandothergasesthatwouldhavetemporarilyimpairedairquality.Overall,however,theseeffectswererelatively\nminor.\nOf course, as people became more numerous and industrialized, air pollution increasingly developed into\na much bigger problem. When the Industrial Revolution began (around 1750), coal quickly became the major\nfuel used to generate heat and energy for machines, and that resulted in increasingly worse air pollution. The\nwidespreaduseofcoalledtoseverepollutionbysulphurdioxide(SO2)andsootintheindustrialtownsandcities\nofEuropeandtheAmericas.Since1900,burgeoningindustrializationandnewtechnologiessuchaspowerplants\nand automobiles have further increased the emissions of pollutants.\nAir pollution can be especially severe in situations when the lower atmosphere is stable and calm. These\nconditionsoftenoccurbeneathanatmosphericphenomenoncalledaninversion,inwhichalayerofcoolairis\ntrappedbeneathahigherlayerofwarmerair(themoreusualpatternisfortemperaturetocoolwithincreasing\naltitude).Anatmospheric inversion isarelativelystableconditionthatpreventspollutedground-levelairfrom\nmixingwithcleanerairfromhigheraltitudes(seeInDetail16.1).Ifanatmosphericinversionisaccompaniedby\nfog,thepollutionisknownassmog(awordderivedfrom\u201csmoke\u201dand\u201cfog\u201d).Asrecentlyasthe1950s,occasional\nso-called \u201ckiller smogs\u201d rich in SO2and soot caused the deaths of thousands of urban people, and many more\nsuffered from respiratory distress (pollution rich in SO2is also called reducing smog). The most famous killer\n386 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution smogsoccurredinLondon,Glasgow,someotherindustrialcentresofEurope,andnearPittsburghintheUnited\nStates (these are described later).\nOncescientistsrecognizedtheseveredamagethatwasbeingcausedbyairpollution,governmentsbeganto\npass laws to decrease the emissions. Pollution control became particularly vigorous after medical researchers\ndiscoveredclearevidenceoflinksbetweenairqualityandhumandiseasesanddeaths.Particularattentionwas\npaidtoairpollutioninurbanenvironments,wherethekillersmogsweremostfrequent.Governmentstypically\nresponded with important control actions, such as the following:\n\u2022 switching from coal, which is a relatively \u201cdirty\u201d fossil fuel, to \u201ccleaner\u201d ones such as natural gas or oil, or to\nalternative energy technologies such as nuclear power and hydroelectricity\n\u2022 constructing tall smokestacks to spread emissions over a much wider area so that ground-level exposures\nbecome less common and less intense \u2013 this tactic is the \u201cdilution solution to pollution\u201d\n\u2022 centralizing energy production in large power plants to replace much of the relatively dirty and inefficient\nburning of coal in home fireplaces and furnaces, thereby permitting better control of emissions\n\u2022 treating waste gases to remove some of their pollutant content, thereby reducing emissions to the\natmosphere\nBecause of these helpful regulatory actions, the importance of reducing smogs became much less in many\ncountries. However, so-called oxidizing smog has become more important causes of damage in many regions.\nOxidizingsmogdevelopsintheatmospherethroughcomplexphotochemicalreactionsinwhichhydrocarbons\nand nitrogen oxides are transformed into ozone (O3) and other gases. Ozone and other oxidizing gases harm\nvegetation and irritate the respiratory system and eyes of people. Oxidizing smog develops under sunny\nconditions if hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are present from automobile and industrial emissions, and\nespecially if the presence of an atmospheric inversion reduces dispersion of the polluted air mass.\nIn this chapter, we examine the most important gaseous pollutants. Their sources of emission, chemical\ntransformations,andtoxicityaredescribed,andCanadiancasestudiesareusedtodemonstratetheecological\ndamages that may be caused.\nIn Detail 16.1. Normally, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude. Under\ncertain conditions, however, a layer of relatively cool air may become trapped under a layer of warmer\nair, a phenomenon known as an atmospheric inversion (or temperature inversion; see Figure).\nFigure 16.1. Normally, air temperature decreases with increasing altitude (red line), but during an\natmospheric inversion, a ground-level layer of cooler air is trapped beneath warmer air (blue lines).\nChapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution | 387 An atmospheric inversion may develop on a clear, cloudless night. Under such conditions, the ground\nsurface cools quickly as it radiates heat that was absorbed during the day. This can result in a layer\nof cool air occurring beneath a higher layer of warmer air. Hilly terrain is particularly vulnerable to\ndeveloping atmospheric inversions because relatively dense cool air can flow downward from hilltops\nandaccumulateinvalleys.Sometimesduringthesummer,stableatmosphericconditionsmaydevelopat\nhigher altitude, capping a still-mixing air mass at ground level.\nAnatmosphericinversioncanberatherstable.Untilitisdispersedbyvigorouswinds,itcantrapand\naccumulate air pollutants that are emitted during the inversion event. Severe episodes of air pollution\ncan occur when stable inversions develop and are maintained for several days.\nSomeplacesregularlydevelopless-persistentinversions,suchasLosAngeles,MexicoCity,andGreater\nVancouver. In these places, the inversions develop in the morning but are typically dispersed during\nthe afternoon. In the meantime, however, oxidizing air pollutants such as ozone can accumulate into a\nphotochemical smog.\nSulphur Gases\nEmissions and Transformations\nSulphurdioxide(SO2)isoneofthemostimportantofthegaseousairpollutants.SO2isacolourlessbutpungent\ngas. Humans can detect its bitter taste at a concentration of only 0.3-1 ppm (parts per million; for SO2, 1 ppm\n388 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution = 2.6 mg/m3). Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), another sulphur gas, can be detected as a foul odour, reminiscent of\nrotteneggs,atconcentrationslowerthan1ppb(partsperbillion;forH2S,1ppm=1.4mg/m3)(unlessotherwise\nindicated, specific data cited in this and other chapters in this section on environmental damages are from\nFreedman, 1995).\nAftertheyareemittedtotheatmosphere,SO2andH2Sbecomeoxidizedtoothercompounds,andultimately\nform sulphate (SO42\u2013; see In Detail 16.2). Because the sulphate ion carries negative charges, it is an anion\n(this refers to any ion, atom, or molecule with a negative charge). Because H2S is quickly oxidized to SO2, its\natmosphericresidencetimeislessthanoneday(thisisthetimetocompletedisappearanceofaninitialamount).\nSO2oxidizes more slowly, at a rate of < 1-5% per hour, depending on sunlight, humidity, strong oxidants such\nasozone,andthepresenceofmetal-containingparticulatesthatmayactascatalysts.Atypicalresidencetime\nof SO2in the atmosphere is about four days. Consequently, SO2may disperse a long distance from its point of\nemissionbeforeitbecomesoxidizedorisdepositedtoaterrestrialoraquaticsurface.Thiskindofdispersalis\nreferred to as long-range transportation of air pollution (LRTAP).\nAtmospheric sulphate, formed by the oxidation of SO2or H2S, can combine with positively charged ions\n(cations) to form various compounds. Most atmospheric sulphate occurs as tiny particulates, especially\nammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4). This is the most prominent component, along with ammonium nitrate\n(NH4NO3),ofthefineparticulatehazethatoftenimpairsvisibilityincities.Hazealsooccursinsomeruralareas\nwherepollutantshavebeenimportedbyLRTAPfromemissionsourceselsewhere.Othercationsthatcombine\nwithsulphateincludecalcium(Ca2+),magnesium(Mg2+),andsodium(Na+).Often,however,therearenotenough\nof these cations to balance all of the negative charges of the sulphate (SO42\u2013) present.

Natural emissions of SO2also occur during wildfires.\nThe global anthropogenic emissions of SO2are about 150-million tonnes per year, or 3.8-times the natural\nreleases (Table 16.1). Fossil-fuel combustion accounts for about half of the anthropogenic emissions. Coal and\npetroleumcontainmineralcompoundsofsulphur,suchaspyrite(FeS2),aswellasorganicsulphurcompounds.\nWhen these fuels are burned, the sulphur becomes oxidized to gaseous SO2, which may be vented to the\natmosphere. Hard coals mined in eastern North America contain 1-12% sulphur, softer coals from western\nregions have <0.3-1.5%, crude oil has 0.8-1.0% residual fuel oils such as bunker -C have 0.3-0.4%, and motor\nfuelssuchasdieselandgasolinehave0.04-0.05%.OtherimportantsourcesofSO2emissionsaremanufacturing\nprocesses(23%ofglobalemissions),thesmeltingofmetalores(7%),andtheburningofnaturalhabitatsduring\nagricultural conversions (most of the rest).\nTable 16.1. Global Emissions and Other Characteristics of Important Air Pollutants. Emission data are\nChapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution | 389 for 2000. Sources: Modified from Freedman (1995) and NEAA (2015).\nAnthropogenic emissions of SO2have increased enormously since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.\nEmissions in 1860 were about 5-million tonnes, compared with about 150-million tonnes in 2000. Since then,\nmost of the wealthier countries have invested heavily in clean-air technologies for power plants and other\nindustrialusersofcoalandoilinordertoreduceemissionsofdamagingSO2totheatmosphere.Theclean-air\nactions include the following:\n\u2022 the installation of technologies to capture SO2from post-combustion waste gases (this is known as flue-\ngas desulphurization or scrubbing)\n\u2022 the removal of some of the sulphur content of fuels (known as fuel desulphurization or coal washing)\n\u2022 the installation of particulate-control devices (such as electrostatic precipitators) to greatly reduce the\nemissions of particulates (although this has little effect on SO2emissions)\n\u2022 switching to low- or no-sulphur fuels such as natural gas, or to no-sulphur energy technologies such as\nhydroelectricity and nuclear power (known as fuel-switching)\n\u2022 energy conservation to reduce the overall demand for fuel and associated emissions of pollutants\n\u2022 building taller smokestacks to disperse emissions of SO2more widely, which helps to decrease the local\nground-level pollution\nHowever,futureglobalemissionsareboundtoincrease.China,India,andotherrapidlyindustrializingcountries\nsupplymuchoftheirburgeoningenergyneedsbyburningcoalandpetroleumfuels.InChina,coalisthemajor\nsource of industrial energy, accounting for 68% of the energy supply (in 2013; Table 13.9). Due to increasing\nindustrialization, emissions of SO2in China increased from 10-million tonnes in 1980 to 34-million tonnes in\n2000, a 3.4-fold increase in only 20 years.\nThe amounts of SO2emissions differ greatly among nations, depending on their population, their kind of\nindustrialization,andthefuelstheymostlyuse.Forinstance,CanadianemissionsofSO2areabout22%ofthose\noftheUnitedStates(Table16.2).However,thepopulationofCanadaisonlyabout11%thatoftheUnitedStates\n(Chapter 10). Therefore, per-capita emissions of SO2are about double in Canada than in the United States.\nTable 16.2. Comparison of Emissions of Air Pollutants in Canada in the United States. Data are in units\n390 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution of millions of tonnes per year (106t/y). Percent refers to the percentage of total emissions by country.\nSources: Modified from Environment Canada (2014) and Environmental Protection Agency (2014).\nAbout66%ofCanadianemissionsofSO2arefromlargeindustrialsources,particularlymetalsmelters,while24%\narefrom\u201cfuelcombustion,\u201dwhichismostlyfossil-fuelledpowerplants.Incomparison,84%ofU.S.emissionsare\nfrom power plants, and 10% from industrial sources. Most of this difference is due to two factors: a relatively\nlargeproportionofelectricitygenerationinCanadaisfromnuclearandhydrotechnologies,whichdonotemit\nSO2, and metal smelting is a major industry in Canada.\nBecause of human-health and environmental damages associated with SO2and other air pollutants, most\ndevelopednationshaveactedtoreducetheiremissions.InCanada,emissionsofSO2werereducedbyabout41%\nbetween1985and2012(Figure16.1),comparedwitha32%reductionintheUnitedStates.Inbothcountriesthe\nreductions were achieved by several methods:\n\u2022 switching to low- or no-sulphur fuels for some major uses, especially for electricity generation\n\u2022 removing sulphur from some fuels prior to combustion, mostly by coal washing\n\u2022 reducing energy demands through conservation\n\u2022 installing scrubbers to remove SO2from post-combustion waste gases before they are vented to the\natmosphere\nHowever,asisshowninFigure16.1,reductionsofemissionsfromindustrialsources(especiallymetalsmelters)\nandstationarysources(mostlycoal-fuelledpowerplants)havebeenespeciallyimportant.Thelargereductions\nofSO2thathavebeenachievedinNorthAmericaduringthepastseveraldecadescostmanybillionsofdollarsto\nachieve, and they should be regarded as an important \u201csuccess story\u201d of pollution control.\nFigure 16.2.

About half of the global emission is from anthropogenic sources.\nClean air typically contains less than 0.2 ppb of SO2or H2S.

However, accidental\nemissionsfromsour-gasplants(whereH2Sisremovedfromnaturalgas)maycauselocalvegetationdamage.In\ncontrast, concentrations of SO2in cities and near industrial sources are often high enough to injure wild and\ncultivated plants. Near certain metal smelters, vegetation has been severely damaged, as we examine later.\nAn exposure to 0.7 ppm SO2for one hour will result in acute injury to most plant species, as will 0.2 ppm\nover an eight-hour period. It is important to note, however, that certain species are extremely sensitive to\nSO2exposures (they are hypersensitive) and can suffer acute injuries at concentrations lower than those just\nnoted.\nInaddition,plantswilloftenexhibitareductioninyieldwhenexposedtoconcentrationsofSO2thatarelower\nthan those required to cause an acute injury.

Guidelines for allowable\nexposures of people to SO2and other potentially toxic gases accommodate the fact that, in terms of dose\nreceived, longer-term exposures to low concentrations can be as important as higher acute exposures.\nGuidelines for occupational exposures to air pollutants are frequently greater than those for ambient\nexposures. In North America, it is recommended that occupational exposures to SO2be no higher than 2 ppm\n(5.2 mg/m3) over the long term, and no higher than 5 ppm (13 mg/m3) for shorter exposures.

Ozone can be consumed by reaction with NO (an emitted gas), which regenerates NO2(reaction\n13). Atmospheric O3can, however, accumulate if other reactions (such as reaction 14) convert NO to\nNO2, because these operate in competition with reaction 13 for NO. (The species RO2includes various\nchemicals known as peroxy radicals, formed by the degradation of organic molecules by reaction with\nhydroxyl radicals, followed by the addition of molecular O2. RO is the chemically reduced form of RO2.)\nNitrogen Gases\nEmissions and Transformations\nThemostimportantofthenitrogen-containinggasesarenitricoxide(NO),nitrogendioxide(NO2),nitrousoxide\n(N2O), and ammonia (NH3). NO and NO2are often considered together as a complex, referred to as NOx.\nAmmonia(NH3),acolourlessgas,isemittedmostlyfromwetlands,whereitisproducedduringtheanaerobic\ndecomposition of dead biomass. Natural emissions of NH3are about 1.2-billion tonnes per year (Table 16.1).\n394 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution Sources of anthropogenic emissions include fossil-fuel combustion (4-million tonnes per year) and animal\nhusbandry(0.2-milliontonnesperyear).TheresidencetimeofNH3intheatmosphereisaboutsevendays(the\nNH3is eventually oxidized to nitrate).\nNitrousoxide(N2O)isacolourless,non-toxicgasthatproducesamildeuphoriawheninhaled.Thisgasisalso\nknown as \u201claughing gas\u201d and is used as a mild anaesthetic in medicine, and sometimes as a recreational drug.\nBecause N2O is a rather unreactive compound, it has a long residence time in the atmosphere of about four\nyears.MostN2Oemissionsareassociatedwithmicrobialdenitrificationinsoilandwater.Theseareequivalent\nto about 18-million tonnes per year, while industrial emissions are 12-million tonnes per year. Agricultural soil\nfertilized with nitrate can have high rates of N2O emission, and modern agricultural practices are thought to\nhave increased global emissions by about 40%.\nNitricoxide(NO)isacolourlessandodourlessgas,whilenitrogendioxideisreddish,pungent,andirritating\ntorespiratoryandeyemembranes.NaturalemissionsofNOxareabout430-milliontonnesperyear(expressed\nas NO; the same emissions expressed as NO2are 658-million tonnes per year). The most important natural\nemissionsofNOxareduetobacterialdenitrificationofnitrateinsoil,fixationofatmosphericnitrogengas(N2)\nby lightning, and oxidation of biomass nitrogen during fires (see Chapter 5).\nAnthropogenic emissions of NOx, about 83-million tonnes per year (expressed as NO), result mostly from\nthe combustion of fossil fuels, especially in automobiles and power plants (Table 16.1). These emissions are\nmostlyNO,whichissecondarilyoxidizedtoNO2byreactionsintheatmosphere.Ultimately,mostatmospheric\nNOxgases become oxidized to nitrate (NO3\u2013), an ion that is important in the acidification of precipitation and\necosystems (Chapter 19).\nToxicity of Nitrogen Gases\nIt is rare that concentrations of NH3 or NOx gases are high enough to injure vegetation. The environmental\ndamageassociatedwithNOxisfocussedonthephotochemicalreactionsbywhichozone,amuchmoretoxicgas,\nis produced (see below), and also the acidification of precipitation and ecosystems.\nAmbient concentrations of NH3and NOxare rarely high enough to bother humans. Guidelines for long-\nterm exposures in an occupational setting are 25 ppm (34 mg/m3) for NO and 5 ppm (10 mg/m3) for NO2.\nOccupationalguidelinesforshort-termexposuresare35ppm(47mg/m3)and5ppm(10mg/m3),respectively.\nIntense occupational exposures to NOxcan cause impaired pulmonary function in humans.\nOrganic Gases and Vapours\nEmissions and Transformations\nHydrocarbons are a diverse group of chemicals whose molecular structures containing various combinations\nof hydrogen and carbon atoms. The simplest hydrocarbon is methane (CH4), a gas. Larger hydrocarbons with\ngreaterweightandmorecomplexstructuremayoccurasvapours,liquids,orsolids(Chapter22).Othervolatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) may contain oxygen, nitrogen, and other light elements in addition to carbon and\nhydrogen, and include alcohols, aldehydes, and phenols.\nChapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution | 395 The background concentration of methane in the atmosphere is about 1.7 ppm (1 ppm = 0.65 mg/m3), while\nall other hydrocarbons andvolatile organics togetheramounttoless than1ppb(Table 16.1; theconversions to\nmg/m3arevariabledependingonthemolecularweight).MostemissionsofCH4arenaturalandareassociated\nwith the fermentation of organic matter by microbes in anaerobic wetlands.

The largest emissions from forests typically\noccur during hot, sunny days. Natural emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons are about 200-million tonnes\nperyear,comparedwithanthropogenicemissionsof186-milliontonnesperyear(Table16.1).Themostimportant\nanthropogenicsourcesareunburnedfuelemittedfromvehiclesandaircraft,releasesduringfossil-fuelmining\nand refining, and evaporation of solvents.\nToxicity of Organic Gases and Vapours\nOrganic gases and vapours can be toxic, but atmospheric concentrations are rarely high enough to damage\nvegetation or animals. The environmental importance of these gases and vapours lies mainly in their role in\nthe photochemical reactions that produce toxic ozone. In addition, CH4 is an important greenhouse gas that\naffectsglobalwarming(Chapter17).Insomeworkplaces,however,relativelytoxicorganicssuchasbenzeneand\nformaldehyde may be important pollutants.\nOzone\nThere are two different ozone-related environmental issues: (1) O3in the stratosphere and (2) O3in the\ntroposphere(ground-levelozone).Highconcentrationsofozonearenaturallypresentintheupper-atmospheric\nlayer known as the stratosphere, which begins at about 8-17 km above the Earth\u2019s surface, depending on\nthe latitude and season. Stratospheric O3causes no damage and is not an air pollutant. Rather, by absorbing\nsolar ultraviolet radiation, stratospheric3helps to protect organisms on the surface pf the planet from many\ndamaging effects of exposure to this harmful part of the electromagnetic spectrum. In contrast, O3 in the\nlower3atmosphere (the troposphere) is an important air pollutant that is damages vegetation, materials, and\nhuman health. Ozone is removed from the atmosphere by interactions with other gases, organic vapours, and\nterrestrial and aquatic surfaces (including vegetation).\nGround-Level Ozone\nGround-level ozone (O3) is the most damaging of the so-called photochemical air pollutants. Less important\nare peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and other oxidant gases. Oxidizing smog is rich\n396 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution in O3and the other oxidant gases. These chemicals are secondary pollutants, meaning they are not actually\nemitted to the atmosphere (as are primary pollutants such as SO2and NOx). Instead, they are synthesized\nwithintheatmospherebyphotochemicalreactions (chemicalreactions thatrequirelight,especiallyultraviolet\nwavelengths). These proceed at faster rates and result in a buildup of oxidants if NOxand hydrocarbons are\npresent in high concentrations, a condition that is typically due to anthropogenic emissions.\nSomeregionstendtodevelopaweakatmosphericinversioninthemorning.Becauseaninversionisrelatively\nstableandresiststhein-mixingofcleanerairfromaboveorbeyond,thisconditionencouragesthedevelopment\nofoxidizingsmogduringthemorningandearlyafternoon.Laterintheday,theinversionistypicallybrokenup\nby stronger winds, and the air pollution is dispersed. Such inversions and their ozone-rich smog are common\nphenomena around the Los Angeles basin, Mexico City, Vancouver, and elsewhere.\nThe concentrations of ground-level O3vary greatly among different regions of North America. Average\nconcentrations in the southwestern United States are relatively high, at about 100 ppb (1 ppb = 2 \u00b5g/m3), and\nthey generally range from 40\u201360 ppb in other regions of the United States and in southern Canada.\nCanada,theUnitedStates,andothercountrieshavedevelopedairqualitystandardsforO3.Theseareintended\ntoreflectconcentrationsthatwouldpreventseveredamagetoagriculturalandwildvegetation.Forsometime,\nthe American O3standard was 80 ppb (160 \u00b5g/m3) (for an average one-hour exposure), but in 1979 this was\nrelaxedto120ppb(240\u00b5g/m3).Theauthoritiesmadethechangebecausetheoriginalstandardof80ppbwas\nfrequentlyexceededoverlargeregionsandsowasessentiallyunenforceable.Infact,eventhe120ppbcriterion\nis commonly exceeded in some regions, particularly in the southwestern United States.\nTheLosAngelesbasinsuffersespeciallyintensephotochemicalairpollution.ConcentrationsofO3canexceed\n500 ppb (one-hour average), and they typically exceed 100 ppb for more than 15 days during the summer.\nMaximum O3concentrations are lower in other cities of North America, typically reaching up to 150-250 ppb\n(one-houraverage).TheseconcentrationsarewellwithintherangeatwhichO3cancauseacuteinjurytoplants,\nwhichiswhyO3issuchanimportantairpollutant.Theemissionsofozoneprecursors(NOxandhydrocarbons)\noccur mainly in cities, but extensive ecological damage is caused when polluted air masses are transported to\nrural areas dominated by agricultural or natural vegetation.\nInCanada,theregionsthatmostoftenexperienceozonepollutionarethelowerFraserValleyinsouthwestern\nBritishColumbia,theWindsor-QuebecCitycorridor,andthesouthernMaritimes(EnvironmentCanada,1999).\nThelowerFraserValley,acoastallowlandboundedbymountainstotheeast,oftenhasatmosphericinversions\nandreceiveslargeemissionsofozoneprecursorsfromtheGreaterVancouverareatothewest.Someplacesin\nthe lower Fraser Valley have maximum O3 concentrations of about 100 ppb.\nTheWindsor\u2013QuebecCitycorridoralsohaslocalemissionsassociatedwithpeopleandindustries(about60%\noftheCanadianpopulationlivesintheregion),butthisareaalsoreceivesozoneanditsprecursorsinairmasses\nblowingfromhighlypopulatedregionsintheUnitedStates.ManyplacesinthecorridorhaveO3concentrations\nof 110-160 ppb, and values up to 190 ppb have been measured.\nThesouthernMaritimeregionisaffectedmainlybyozone-richairmassesblowinginfromindustrialpartsof\nsouthern Ontario, Quebec, and the northeastern United States.

They involve the absorption of\nsolar UV radiation by oxygen molecules (O2), which creates highly reactive oxygen atoms (O) that join with\notherO2moleculestoformO3(seeInDetail16.2).Thesereactionsproceedrelativelyquicklyinthestratosphere\nbecausehigh-energyUVradiationisabundantthere.Asaresult,O3concentrationsaretypically200-300ppbin\nthe stratosphere, about 10 times greater than in the ambient troposphere.\nStratospheric O3provides a critical environmental service. It efficiently absorbs most of the incoming high-\nenergy UV radiation, which can be extremely damaging to organisms. In particular, DNA is a strong absorber\nof UV and can be damaged by this radiation. This can increase the risk of developing skin cancers, including\nmelanoma,anoften-fatalmalignancy.OtherhealthrisksfromUVexposureincludethedevelopmentofcataracts\nintheeyesandsuppressionoftheimmunesystem.UVradiationalsodamagesplants,inpartbecausechlorophyll\n(the key photosynthetic pigment) is degraded by UV absorption, which may lead to decreases in productivity.\nThe waxy covering of the cuticle of foliage is also damaged by UV radiation.\nStratospheric O3can be destroyed by various processes, including reactions with the trace gases NOxand\nN2O and with reactive ions of bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. Because of anthropogenic emissions, the\nconcentrationsofsomeoftheseO3-consumingchemicalshavebeenincreasinginthestratosphere,leadingto\nconcerns about the depletion of stratospheric O3. It is widely believed that emissions of chlorofluorocarbons\n(CFCs),particularlytheindustrialgasesknownasfreons,havebeenespeciallyimportantinthisregard.Because\nCFCsareextremelyunreactiveinthetroposphere,theyeventuallymigrateuptothestratosphere,wherethey\n398 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution are bombarded with UV radiation and slowly degrade (photodissociate) to release free chlorine. The chlorine\nefficiently reacts with and destroys O3.\nThe O3-destroying reactions proceed most effectively under extremely cold and stagnant conditions in the\nstratosphere,suchasthoseoccurringabovepolarlatitudesattheendoftheAntarcticandArcticwinters.These\npolar-focused O3depletions result in the development of so-called ozone holes during the early springtime.\nThese phenomena have been observed regularly since the early 1980s. The O3holes over Antarctica are\nparticularly extensive and typically involve decreases of the O3concentration of 30-50% during the spring.\nSmallerdepletionsofO3occurabovetheArctic,includingnorthernCanada.TheaffectedareasintheNorthern\nHemisphere are much smaller than their counterparts in Antarctica.\nThesizesoftheozoneholesinAntarcticavaryfromyeartoyear,buttherehasbeenatrendofstrongincreases\nsince 1980, when the first accurate data began to be collected (Figure 16.3). Although the seasonal losses of\nO3only take place over polar regions, lower latitudes are also affected when the O3-depleted air becomes\ndispersed during the breakup of the holes. This temporarily reduces the stratospheric O3concentrations\nthroughout the hemisphere, though not nearly to the same degree as occurs in the holes themselves.\nFigure 16.3.

This is true in general, but air quality is especially bad during smog events,\noften caused by poor dispersion during an atmospheric inversion. Consequently, city people living their\nnormal lives are routinely exposed to higher concentrations of air pollutants than those living in cleaner,\nrural environments.\n\u2022 The working environment: Many people are exposed to high concentrations of pollutants as a consequence\nof their occupation. Of course, the specific exposures depend on the job \u2013 workers in metal smelters may\nbe exposed to sulphur dioxide and metallic particulates, auto mechanics may be affected by exhaust fumes\ncontaining carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and laboratory workers may inhale various organic\nsolvents.\n\u2022 The indoor environment: Buildings are often contaminated by gases and fumes. For example, space heaters,\nfurnaces, and fireplaces burning wood, kerosene, or fuel oil may emit carbon monoxide into the indoor\nenvironment. All high-temperature combustions emit nitric oxide, and many synthetic materials and\nfabrics vent formaldehyde and other organic vapours. These chemicals can accumulate if indoor air is not\nexchanged frequently with cleaner, outdoor air.\n\u2022 Tobacco smoke: The smoking of tobacco is a leading source of easily avoidable air pollution. Smoking is also\nthe most important cause of preventable diseases, especially lung cancer and heart disease (see Chapter\n15). People inhale a great variety of toxic gases and fumes when they smoke tobacco (and also marijuana). In\naddition, non-smokers are indirectly exposed to lower concentrations of those chemicals because of the\nlingering residues of \u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d that may occur in indoor atmospheres.\nAlloftheseexposurestoairpollutantshaveimportantimplicationsforhumanhealth.However,thepollutionof\nthe ambient urban environment is the focus of the following paragraphs.\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe in the mid-18th century, people living\nin cities and working in certain types of factories have been exposed to high concentrations of air pollutants.\nEspecially important have been sulphur dioxide, soot, and other emissions associated with the combustion of\ncoal and other fossil fuels. The most severe exposures to pollutants in urban environments typically occurred\nduringprolongedatmosphericinversions,whichpreventthedispersionofemissionsandresultinsmogsrichin\nSO2and particulates.\nCoal has long been used in many places to heat homes and other buildings. The associated emissions have\nbeen regarded as a problem in cities and towns in Europe since at least 1500. With the beginning of the\nIndustrial Revolution, which initially usedcoal as its principal energy source, air pollution worsenedmarkedly.\nThefirstconvincinglinkbetweenairpollutionandasubstantialincreaseinthedeathrateofanexposedhuman\npopulationwasmadein1909,inrelationtoanoxioussmogduringaninversioninGlasgow,Scotland,whenabout\none-thousand deaths may have been caused.\nThemostinfamous\u201ckillersmog\u201dinNorthAmericaoccurredin1948inDonora,Pennsylvania.Aninversionand\nfog persisted in the Donora Valley for four days, but emissions from several factories continued, resulting in\na build-up of high concentrations of SO2and particulates in the atmosphere.

In many cities, only certain kinds of plants that can tolerate air pollution could\ngrow. Examples of pollution-tolerant trees that are commonly grown in urban Canada include Norway maple\n(Acer platanoides), silver maple (A. saccharinum), linden (Tilia europaea), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima),\nand ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).\nTo deal with the problems of this kind of smog, governments brought in legislation that has required large\nreductions in the emissions of air pollutants, particularly in cities. In Canada, for example, the enactment of\nvarious federal, provincial, and municipal laws related to air emissions has substantially improved urban air\nquality.AirqualityhasbeensimilarlyimprovedunderlegislationenactedintheUnitedStates,Britain,andother\nwealthier countries since the 1960s.\nOf course, the killer smogs were particularly severe events of air pollution. More typically, the urban\natmosphereiscontaminatedbymuchsmallerconcentrationsofSO2,NOx,O3,volatileorganiccompounds,and\nparticulates. Many studies have investigated the effects of chronic exposures to those lower exposures to air\ncontaminantsonhumanhealth.Theresultsofsomestudiessuggestthatmodernurbanairqualityissufficiently\ndegraded to cause chronic damage to human health, especially by increasing the incidences of lung disease,\nasthma, and eye irritation.

The first example\ndescribes \u201cnatural\u201d air pollution at the Smoking Hills, a remote locality in the Arctic. The second examines\necological effects of emissions from large smelters near Sudbury, Ontario.\nThe Smoking Hills\nThe Smoking Hills are located in the Northwest Territories on the coast of the Beaufort Sea. At various places\nalong the coast and nearby rivers, seams of bituminous shale occur as exposed strata in steep places were\nerosion is occurring. The shale contains pyritic sulphur, which becomes oxidized to sulphate when exposed\ntoatmosphericoxygenthrougherosionofthecliffs.Theoxidationproducesheat(thereactionisexothermic),\nwhichunderinsulatingconditionscanincreasethetemperatureenoughtospontaneouslyignitethebituminous\nmaterials. These smoulder and release SO2, which fumigates the nearby tundra. The first recorded sighting of\nthe Smoking Hills was in 1826 by John Richardson, an explorer. However, the burns were long known to local\nInuit and are likely thousands of years old.\nImage 16.1. Natural air pollution at the Smoking Hills is caused when seams of bituminous shale\nspontaneously ignite and release sulphurous plumes that blow inland and fumigate the nearby tundra.\nSource: B. Freedman.\nWindsattheSmokingHillsoftenblowtheSO2-ladenplumes(airmasses)inlandatgroundlevel,suchthatthey\n404 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution fumigate the tundra. The pollution is most intense at the edge of the cliff, where the plumes begin to spread\ninland. Concentrations of SO2at the cliff edge are as high as 2 ppm, and then rapidly decrease inland in a\nmore or less exponential manner (Figure 16.3). This gradient of air pollution occurs because the gases become\nprogressively diluted in the ambient atmosphere with increasing distance from the points of emission.\nFigure 16.5. Sulphur Dioxide at the Smoking Hills. The data are averages of 8- and 14-day sampling\nperiods, respectively. The averages include times when SO2concentrations were high, as well as those\nwhen the sampling sites were not fumigated because the plumes were blowing out to sea. Source:\nData from Gizyn (1980).\nThe pollution by SO2has severely acidified the soil. Acidic conditions in freshwater ponds reach pH 2 or less,\ncomparedwithpH8ormoreoutsidethefumigationarea(seeInDetail19.1foranexplanationofpHasameasure\nof acidity). The extreme acidification causes metals to become dissolved from minerals in soil and aquatic\nsediment (Table 16.4). High concentrations of solubilized metals are toxic to terrestrial and aquatic organisms.\nIn addition, sulphate occurs in high concentrations in both soil and water. This is mostly a result of the dry\ndepositionofSO2fromtheatmosphereanditssubsequentoxidationtoSO42\u2013withintheecosystem(seeChapter\n19).\nTable 16.4. Chemistry of Tundra Ponds at the Smoking Hills. The data are in ppm and are averages\nChapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution | 405 for ponds within the pH range. Source: Data from Havas and Hutchinson (1983).\nThe high concentration of SO2in the air and the acidity and soluble metals in soil and water result in the\nfumigated habitats being highly toxic to most plants, animals, and microorganisms. Close to the edge of the\nseacliff in fumigated areas, where the pollution is most intense, no vegetation grows at all \u2013 there is total\necological degradation. Farther inland, the pollution becomes less severe, and a few pollution-tolerant plants\ncan grow. The most notable of these are arctic wormwood (Artemisia tilesii), polargrass (Arctagrostis latifolia),\na lichen (Cladonia bellidiflora), and a moss (Pohlia nutans). These few tolerant plants have replaced the many\nspeciesofunpollutedtundra,whichincludesarcticwillow(Salixarctica),mountainavens(Dryasintegrifolia),and\nmore than 70 others (Freedman et al., 1990).\nPollution-tolerantspeciesalsooccurinacidicpondsattheSmokingHills.Eventhemostacidicponds,which\nhaveapHaslowas1.8,supportatleastsixspeciesofalgae.Theseareextremelytolerantofacidityanddissolved\nmetals and are not found in non-acidic waterbodies.

However, valuable quantities of iron, cobalt, gold, silver, and\nother metals are also produced from the mines, as are sulphur and selenium.\nOneoftheworld\u2019slargestindustrialcomplexeshasbeendevelopedtomineandprocesstherichorebodies\nnear Sudbury. The facilities have included underground mines, an open-pit mine, ore-processing mills with\nChapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution | 407 tailings-disposal areas, smelters, metal refineries, sulphuric-acid plants, and various other installations. The\nindustrial activities around Sudbury provide a key economic base for a regional population of more than\n160-thousand people.\nThe metals in the Sudbury ore occur as sulphide minerals, meaning they are combined with sulphur in\ncompoundssuchasnickelsulphideandironsulphide.Consequently,animportantstepinprocessingtheoreis\ntoroastthematerialatahightemperatureinthepresenceofoxygen,whichconvertsthesulphidesintogaseous\nSO2.

The pollution devastated\necosystems near the roast beds. The denuding of terrestrial habitats resulted in massive erosion of soil from\nslopes, exposing the bedrock, which became pitted and blackened by reaction with the sulphurous fumes.\nImage 16.3.

At the same time, the Coniston smelter was closed and its production\nshifted to Copper Cliff. The Falconbridge smelter, with smokestacks of 93 m and 140 m, is owned by another\ncompany. The commissioning of the superstack in 1972 allowed pollutants to be vented high enough into the\natmosphere to make ground-level fumigations infrequent events.

At that time, Sudbury was the world\u2019s largest source of\nanthropogenic SO2emissions, responsible for about 4% of global releases. Emissions of SO2from the smelters\nhave decreased greatly since that time, to about 0.14 x 106t/y during 2006-2013 (Figure 16.4; Environment\nCanada, 2014). The decreases are due mainly to expensive investments in pollution abatement technologies,\nincluding equipment for flue-gas desulphurization. Although greatly diminished, the emissions of SO2remain\nlarge.\nFigure 16.6. Reductions of Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide from the Copper Cliff Smelter.

About 3-8 km from the Copper\nCliff smelter, remnants of forest survive where the local topography provided a degree of shelter from the\npollution.However,denudedandblackenedhilltopsarestillcommoninthispatchilyvegetatedzone.Treesinthe\nremnantstandsarestunted,withmanydeadbranchesandotherinjuries.Thetreesincluderelativelypollution-\ntolerant species such as red maple (Acer rubium), white birch (Betula papyrifera), red oak (Quercus rubra),\ntrembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and large-toothed aspen (P. grandidentata). The forest cover beyond 8\nkm is almost continuous, but the biomass and biodiversity of the stands are impoverished. Beyond 20-30 km\nfrom the smelters, the forests are little affected by pollution and mixed stands of conifer and hardwood trees\noccur, as is typical of the region (Freedman and Hutchinson, 1980).\nLakes close to the Sudbury smelters were also severely degraded by atmospheric pollution.

Compare the natural and anthropogenic emissions of sulphur and nitrogen compounds. Why do the\nsources of emission vary between regions and countries?\n2. Why are high concentrations of ozone in the lower atmosphere considered an environmental problem?\nWhy does this differ from the stratosphere, where too little ozone is a problem?\n3. Explain are the differences between primary and secondary air pollutants? Give examples of each.\n4. Why has air pollution decreased so much in the Sudbury region, and what have been the ecological\nresponses to this environmental improvement?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Compare, in broad terms, the patterns of ecological damage caused by \u201cnatural\u201d pollution at the Smoking\nHills with those caused by smelters near Sudbury. Why is it useful to study the ecological effects of natural\npollution?\n2. Existing clean-air technologies could be used to greatly reduce the emissions of air pollutants everywhere.\nConsidering the damage that pollutants cause to human health, ecosystems, and other values, why are\nthese technologies not being used more extensively? Consider factors associated with economics, politics,\nscientific uncertainty about pollution damage, and the benefits of having cleaner air. Contrast the lack of\naction with the successes achieved in controlling the emissions of ozone-depleting substances through the\nMontreal Protocol.\n3. Epidemiological (statistical) research suggests that human health may be affected by ambient levels of air\npollutants in urban areas, particularly through increased incidences of respiratory diseases, such as\nasthma. However, the statistical data are rather weak, and only a relatively small proportion of the urban\npopulation appears to be affected. What are some issues that decision makers must consider when\ndeliberating about additional controls on the release of air pollutants in urban areas?\n4. Like most other smelters built during the twentieth century, the ones at Sudbury caused obvious damage\nto ecosystems and human health. Why were those large industrial facilities not shut down or better\ncontrolled by the governments of the day? Today, new smelters are being built in Canada and in other\ncountries. Are there risks of those industrial facilities repeating the mistakes of the past?\nExploring Issues\n1. You have been asked to assess the potential ecological effects of building a new metal smelter in a region\nthat is now wilderness. The smelter will emit sulphur dioxide to the atmosphere. Based on what you know\nabout pollution damage at the Smoking Hills, around Sudbury, and at other smelters, what would be the\nmost important considerations to incorporate into the environmental impact assessment? Focus on the\npotential effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\n414 | Chapter 16 ~ Gaseous Air Pollution References Cited and Further Reading\nAnderson, S.O. and K.M. Sarma. 2005.

Outline the physical basis of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect, and describe how human influences may be causing\nit to intensify.\n2. Explain the term greenhouse gas (GHG).\n3. Describe how the various GHGs vary in their effectiveness and influence on the greenhouse effect.\n4.

Discuss strategies for reducing the intensity of the human influence on the greenhouse effect.\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter we examine how Earth\u2019s naturally occurring greenhouse effect keeps the surface of the planet\nrelatively warm. We also describe how certain atmospheric constituents influence this phenomenon. These\nconstituents are known as greenhouse gases (GHGs) and they work by slowing the rate by which Earth is\nable to cool itself of absorbed solar radiation. It is well documented that the concentrations of some of the\nGHGs,particularlycarbondioxide,areincreasingbecauseofemissionsassociatedwithvarioushumanactivities.\nPotentially,theseincreasedconcentrationscouldintensifythegreenhouseeffect,whichwouldresultinglobal\nwarming. This would be an extremely important environmental change, with potentially devastating\nconsequences for the human economy and natural ecosystems.\nThe Greenhouse Effect\nEarth\u2019sgreenhouseeffectisawell-understoodphysicalphenomenon,anditiscriticalinmaintainingtheaverage\nsurfacetemperatureoftheplanetatabout15\u00b0C.Withoutthisinfluence,thesurfacetemperaturewouldaverage\nabout-18\u00b0C,or33\u00b0coolerthanitactuallyis.Thiswouldbefrostierthanorganismscouldtolerateoverthelong\nterm, because at -18\u00b0C water is in a solid state. Liquid water is crucial to the proper functioning of organisms\nand ecosystems. At Earth\u2019s actual average temperature of 15\u00b0C, water is unfrozen for much or all of the year\n(depending on location). This means that enzymes can function and physiology can proceed efficiently, as can\nthe many important ecological processes that involve liquid water.\nChapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change | 417 Image 17.1.

A molecule of CH4is about 28 times more effective than one\nof CO2at absorbing infrared radiation, while N2O is 265 times more effective (these are known as greenhouse\nwarming potentials, with CO2assigned a value of 1.0; Table 17.1).\nThere is no evidence that the concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere has increased recently.\nHowever, concentrations of CO2and other GHGs have increased markedly during the past several centuries\nbecauseofemissionsassociatedwithhumanactivities(Table17.1).Priorto1750,theatmosphericconcentration\nofCO2wasabout280ppm,whereasin2014ithadreached399ppm,whichisa43%increase.OtherGHGshave\nalso increased during this period.

The data\nrecord supporting this change is excellent and demonstrates one of the most convincing examples of long-\nterm changes of any aspect of environmental chemistry.

The rates of\nutilization of coal, petroleum, natural gas, and oil sand have increased enormously during the past century,\nmostlytosatisfysurgingenergydemandsforindustry,transportation,andspaceheating.Themanufacturingof\ncement also results in large emissions of CO2to the atmosphere.\nIn total, since about the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, about 365-billion tonnes of CO2-C\n(carbon in the form of CO2) have been released to the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and\nthe production of cement (Boden et al., 2013). Half of these fossil-fuel CO2emissions have occurred since the\nmid-1980s.\nBetween 1860 and 1869, during the middle part of the Industrial Revolution, the combustion of fossil fuels,\nmainlycoal,resultedintheglobalemissionofabout422-milliontonnesofCO2peryear(Bodenetal.,2013).By\ntheyear2012,globalemissionsfromfossil-fuelcombustionhadincreasedbyafactorof80,to35.4billiontonnes\nperyear(Figure17.3).About95%ofthecommercialemissionofCO2in2012wasduetothecombustionoffossil\nfuels,ofwhich43%wasfromliquidhydrocarbons,33%fromcoal,and18%fromnaturalgas.Theremaining5%\nis associated with cement manufacturing and gas flaring (Table 17.2).\nFigure 17.3.

The largest per-capita emissions are in\nseveral countries that flare large amounts of fossil fuels at wellheads and refiners, such as Qatar and Trinidad\n& Tobago. Other than those cases, the greatest emissions are in wealthy, energy-intensive countries, such as\nCanada, Australia, the United States, Japan, and most of Western Europe. The smallest emissions are in the\npoorest, least-developed countries, where there is relatively little use of fossil fuels because of the expense to\npurchase them.\nTable 17.3. Per-Capita Emissions of CO2by Selected Countries. Data are for commercial sources of\nemission (mostly fossil fuels), in units of tonnes of CO2-C per person\u2022year in 2010.

(2014).\n424 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change Future emissions of CO2from fossil-fuel combustion are predicted to be much larger than those occurring\ntoday,mainlybecauseoftheanticipatedindustrializationofpoorercountriesastheydevelopeconomically.One\nprediction suggests that global emissions by the middle of the twenty-first century could be up to 55 billion\ntonnes of CO2per year, about double the current releases.\nChapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change | 425 CO from Clearing Forest\n2\nMature forest stores large amounts of organic carbon in vegetation and the dead organic matter of soil.

This quantity is about 45% of\ntheemissionsduetofossilfuelcombustionduringthesameperiod(320-billiontonnesofCO2).Morerecently,\nin 2013, the combustion of fossil fuels emitted about 9.9-billion tonnes of CO2-C into the atmosphere, while\ndeforestation accounted for another 0.9-billion tonnes.\nAs was previously noted previously, forest and grassland ecosystems store large amounts of carbon in the\nbiomass of their vegetation and soil. When these \u201chigh-carbon\u201d ecosystems are converted into agricultural\nor urban ones, there is a large emission of their organic carbon to the atmosphere (mostly as CO2from\ndecomposition and fires).\nThe disturbance of forests by harvesting timber also results in a large emission of CO2, because mature\nstandssupportmuchmorebiomassthanyoungerones(old-growthforeststoresthemost).However,thecarbon\nemissionscenarioiscomplicatedbywhatisdonewiththeharvestedtimber.Forexample,ifthetreebiomassis\nburnedasafuel,thereleaseofCO2totheatmosphereoccursrapidly.Ontheotherhand,iftheharvestedwoodis\nusedtomanufacturelumber,furniture,orviolins,allofwhichare\u201cenduring\u201dproductswithanextendedlifespan,\nthereleaseofCO2totheatmosphereoccursslowly.Itmustalsoberememberedthatmuchoftheinitialrelease\nof CO2may eventually be offset by regeneration of the harvested forest (unless this is prevented, as happens\nwhen deforestation occurs to develop agricultural or urban land-use).\nTable 17.4 shows large differences between regions in their emissions of CO2from changes in land-use.

Overall, the net emission of CO2by changes in forest area has recently been close to zero\u2014that is,\nagricultural land is regenerating back to forest about as quickly as forest elsewhere in North America is being\nconverted into agricultural and urban land-uses. The European situation is similar, and forest biomass (and\ncarbon storage) there has also increased since the 1920s.\nHowever, in relatively poor, less-developed, tropical countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, forests are\nbeing cleared rapidly. This is being dome mostly to develop agricultural land to provide livelihoods and grow\nfoodforincreasingnumbersofpeople,andalsotoprovideagriculturecommoditiesforexport.Thisisaserious\nproblemnotonlybecauseofthelargeemissionsofCO2,butalsobecauseoftheconsequencesforbiodiversity\n(Chapter 26).\nFortunately, there are signs that the rate of global deforestation may be slowing down.

In contrast, most CO2emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have been\noccurring in relatively wealthy, industrialized, higher-latitude countries, of which Canada is a leading example.\nGlobal Carbon Geochemistry\nKeyanthropogenicinfluencesontheglobalcarbonbudgetaresummarizedinFigure17.5,whichshowsthemajor\ncompartmentsinwhichcarbonisstoredaswellastransfersbetweenthem.AlthoughFigure17.5simplifiesthe\ncomplex nature of the global carbon cycle, some important inferences can be made that are relevant to the\ngreenhouse effect.\nAnthropogenicemissionshavecauseda43%increasetooccurintheamountofCO2storedintheatmosphere,\nfromabout580x109tofCO2-Cinpre-industrialtimesto844x109tin2015.Theatmosphericconcentrationof\nCO2has accordingly increased during the same period, from about 280 ppm to 400 ppm.\nBeforehumansbegantomodifythecharacterofEarth\u2019secosystems,especiallybyextensivedeforestation,the\nglobalemissionandfixationofatmosphericCO2wereapproximatelyinbalance.Inotherwords,onaglobalbasis,\nthegrossprimaryproduction(GPP)wasaboutequaltoecosystemrespiration(ER),andbiologicallyfixedcarbon\nwas not changing over time. However, deforestation is now resulting in huge emissions of CO2, amounting to\nabout2.0x109t/yofCO2-C.Overall,modernterrestrialecosystemsarestoringabout38%lesscarbonintheir\nvegetation and 12% less in soil compared with pre-industrial times.\nUltimately, the oceans are the most important sink for CO2emitted through human activities. The oceans\nhave a net absorption of about 3.1 x 109t/y of CO2-C from the atmosphere. However, this is much less than\nthe anthropogenic emissions of 8.6 \u00d7 109t/y of CO2-C, and so the amount of CO2stored in the atmosphere\nis increasing. The oceans have an enormous capacity for absorbing atmospheric CO2, which is ultimately\ndeposited as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a mineral that accumulates in sediment (mostly as the shells of\nmolluscs,foraminifera,andotherinvertebrates).However,therateofformationofCaCO3isaffectedbyvarious\nfactors, including the concentration of inorganic carbon in seawater as well as acidity. This concentration\n428 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change is determined by the rate at which CO2enters the oceans from the atmosphere, minus its biological uptake\n(mostlybyphytoplankton duringphotosynthesis).Althoughanthropogenic CO2eventuallyendsupasCaCO3in\noceanicsediment,thereisasubstantialtime-lagintheresponseofoceanicsinkstoincreasingconcentrations\nofCO2intheatmosphere.ThislagallowsatmosphericCO2concentrationstoincreasebecauseofanthropogenic\nemissions.\nAcidification of the ocean is an additional issue. In actual fact, the ocean is maintained as a non-acidic\nenvironmentbycarbondynamicsandavarietyofotherinfluences,withatypicalpHbetweenabout7.5and8.4\n(ChesterandJickells,2012).Inthiscase,acidificationwouldberepresentedoceanicwaterbecominglessalkaline\nover time. The acidification is caused by atmospheric CO2dissolving into oceanic water, a process that forms\ncarbonic acid (H2CO3), a weak acid, according to this equation:\nCO2+ H2O \u21cc H2CO3\nThe carbonic acid may then dissociate to form bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) and carbonate ( CO3\u20132), as follows:\nH2CO3\u21cc HCO3\u2013 + H+\u21cc CO3\u20132 + H+\nThe rate at which CO2can dissolve into the ocean is in equilibrium with its atmospheric concentration. As\na result, the rapid increases of atmospheric CO2(to 400 ppm in 2015) has resulted in more dissolving, more\nproduction of carbonic acid, and the apparent beginning of acidification of that vast aquatic ecosystem. One\nestimate is that the average pH of the global oceans has decreased from 8.25 to about 0.1 unit less (still\nnon-acidic, but nevertheless representing a degree of acidification; Jacobson, 2005). Ocean acidification is a\npotentiallyseriousproblem,becausemanymarineorganismscanonlylivewithinanarrowrangeoftoleranceof\nthis aspect of water chemistry.\nFigure 17.5.

Moreover, the greenhouse effect helps to\nmaintainthesurfacetemperaturewithinarangethatiscomfortablefororganisms\u2013averagingabout15\u00b0C,or33\u00b0\nwarmerthanitwouldbewithanon-greenhouseatmosphere.Itisalsowelldocumentedthattheconcentrations\nof CO2and other radiatively active gases are increasing in the atmosphere. It is reasonable, therefore, to\nhypothesize that this increase will intensify the natural greenhouse effect.\nAlthough this potential intensification of the greenhouse effect remains a hypothesis, it is an extremely\nimportant one. If this environmental change does happen, it would have many climatic and ecological\nconsequences, some of which would be catastrophic for both economically important and natural ecosystems.\nClimate change refers to long-term variations of the weather that are experiences in a region. One of the\nmostimportantindicatorsofclimatechangeisthetemperatureofthesurfaceatmosphere.Airtemperatureis\nmeasuredroutinelyinmanyplacesthroughouttheworld.Thesedatacanbeusedtocalculateestimatesofthe\naverage surface temperature of Earth and to detect changes over time. However, the air-temperature records\nsuffer from some important problems:\n\u2022 Air temperature is extremely variable over time and space, and the unfavourable signal : noise ratio makes\nit difficult to detect long-term trends.\n\u2022 Most of the older data are less reliable than modern records (accurate recordings of surface air\ntemperatures began around 1880).\n\u2022 Many weather-monitoring stations are located in urbanized areas, and their data are influenced by the so-\ncalled \u201curban heat island\u201d, which is characterized by typically warmer conditions than occurs in\nsurrounding, rural places. Moreover, a large number of initially rural weather stations have become\nsurrounded by urban land-uses, resulting in a \u201ccontamination\u201d of their air-temperature records.\n\u2022 Global temperatures can respond to influences other than changes in the greenhouse effect, such as the\ncooling effects of volcanic eruptions that inject great masses of highly reflective aerosols into the upper\natmosphere, as well as variations in the intensity of solar output.\nInspiteofthevariousdifficultieswithdatausedtoestimateEarth\u2019saveragesurfacetemperature,recentanalyses\nsuggest that there has been a definite warming trend since the mid-nineteenth century. The average global\nsurfacetemperaturehasincreasedbymorethan0.8\u00b0Coverthepast150years(Figure17.6).Thewarmestyears\nsince 1850 have all occurred since about 1990.

An increase in CO2emissions from ecosystems could have been a\nresult of climatic warming, perhaps because the rate of biomass decomposition increased or because of the\nwarming of frozen soil in polar latitudes (which would release biomass in permafrost for decomposition and\nmethanerelease).Clearly,Figure17.8suggestsastrongrelationshipbetweenCO2andtemperaturechange,but\nthepossibleinterpretationsareambiguousbecauseof\u201cchickenoregg\u201dconsiderations\u2013itisunclearwhichcame\nfirst.\nFigure 17.8.

These \u201cvirtual experiments\u201d examine the potential climatic\nresponsestoincreasesinatmosphericCO2.Thecomputersimulationsareknownasthree-dimensionalgeneral\ncirculation models (GCMs).

These experiments suggest that such a doubling would result in\nan increase of 1\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C in the average temperature of the surface atmosphere. The intensity of warming is\npredictedtobegreatestinhigh-latituderegions,wherethetemperatureincreasesmightbetwotothreetimes\ngreater than in the tropics.\nWarming of the lower atmosphere will be one likely change that will be caused by an increased intensity\nof the greenhouse effect. However, there could also be important effects that occur indirectly, in response\nto changes in the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. The most important of the indirect changes would\ninclude large-scale shifts in the patterns of atmospheric circulation. Such shifts would likely result in changes\nin the amounts, spatial distribution, and seasonality of precipitation.

The 2014 IPCC\nreport (IPCC, 2014a). The reports made strong statements about the reality of global warming, its\npotential consequences, and the anthropogenic role in its causation. Some highlights include the\nfollowing statements (from IPCC, 2014b; text in italics is directly quoted):\n\u2022 Humaninterferencewiththeclimatesystemisoccurring,andclimatechangeposesrisksforhuman\nand natural systems.\n\u2022 In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all\ncontinents and across the oceans. The evidence of impacts is strongest for natural systems, but\neffects on human systems have also been attributed.\n\u2022 Inmanyregions,changingprecipitationormeltingsnowandicearealteringhydrologicalsystems.\nThis is affecting water resources, with glaciers shrinking almost worldwide, affecting runoff and\nwaterresourcesdownstream,andpermafrostwarmingandthawinginbothhigh-latitudeandhigh-\nelevation regions.\n\u2022 Many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal\nactivities,migrationpatterns,abundances,andspeciesinteractionsinresponsetoongoingclimate\nchange.\n\u2022 Based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate\nchange on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts.\n\u2022 Impactsfromrecentclimate-relatedextremes,suchasheatwaves,droughts,floods,cyclones,and\nwildfires,revealsignificantvulnerabilityandexposureofsomeecosystemsandmanyhumansystems\nto current climate variability.\n\u2022 Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods,\nespeciallyforpeoplelivinginpoverty.Poorpeopleareaffectedbyeffectsonlivelihood,reducedcrop\nyields, or destruction of homes, as well as indirectly by increased food prices and insecurity.\nThe IPCC (2014b) report also noted that society was now routinely incorporating climate-related\nadaptations into planning and social policies:\n\u2022 Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation\nof responses. Recognition is increasing of the value of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based\nmeasures,andofthelimitstoadaptation.Sofar,technologicalandengineeredoptionsarethemost\ncommonly implemented adaptive responses, often within existing programs such as disaster risk\nmanagement and water management.\nIt must be recognized that these and other IPCC projections and policy suggestions are based on\nimperfectscientificandeconomicmodels.Nevertheless,althoughtheIPCCpredictionssufferfromsome\ndegree of inaccuracy, the likelihood of errors was addressed in the many component studies (and is\n434 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change indicated by qualifiers such as \u201cvery likely\u201d and \u201chigh confidence\u201d). The field of anthropogenic climate\nchange remains highly controversial, but the IPCC (2014) reports are by far the most reliable sources\nof credible information that we have to advise our individual and societal responses to this important\nproblem.\nEcological Effects\nIn terrestrial ecosystems, the direct effects of global warming and associated climatic changes would be\nrestricted mainly to plants. Animals and microorganisms would also be affected, but only through secondary\nresponses to changes in their habitat caused by any effects on vegetation.\nThe predicted increases in air temperature might not affect plants much because those changes would\nprobably not be sufficient to increase heat-related stress. Much more important would be any substantial\nchanges in the amounts and seasonal patterns of precipitation. Soil moisture is often a key environmental\ninfluence on the distribution and productivity of vegetation. For instance, a decrease in the amounts of\nprecipitation or soil moisture in the Canadian Prairies would likely cause the natural mixed-grass prairie to\nchangeintoshort-grassprairie,oreventosemi-desert.Decreasedsoilmoisturewouldalsoaffectthekindsof\ncropsthatcouldbegrowninmanyregions,aswellastheirproductivity.Thatcouldmakepresentagricultural\nsystems more difficult or even impossible unless irrigation was practised.\nAbout14-thousandyearsago,thecontinentalglaciersstartedtomeltback,andtheywereabout80%goneby\n8-10-thousandyearsago.VegetationintheregionsofCanadachangedsubstantiallyduringthewarmingclimates\nthat followed this deglaciation.

As a result, the species composition of early post-\nglacial plant communities was different from that occurring today under similar climatic regimes.

For example, most of northern and central South America is now\ncharacterizedbyawarmandhumid,tropicalclimate.However,thisregionisthoughttohavebeenconsiderably\ndrier during the past glacial period, which ended 10-14-thouand years ago. During that time, much of the\ntropical region was covered by an open-canopied savannah, while rainforest occurred only in isolated regions\nwithrelativelyhighrainfall,knownasrefugia.Intermsofthelandscape,therefugiaoftropicalforestoccurred\n436 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change as \u201cislands\u201d within a more extensive matrix of savannah, which is an inhospitable habitat for species of moist\nforest. The restructuring of tropical ecosystems during the Pleistocene Ice Age, which was driven by climate\nchanges of the time, must have had enormous impacts on the multitudes of rare species of the rainforest. It\nis likely that many of those species became extinct as a result of the habitat changes. In modern times, an\nanthropogenic intensification of the greenhouse effect would also cause substantial changes to occur in the\ncharacter of tropical habitats over enormous areas, and similar ecological calamities would again result.\nIt is important to acknowledge that scientists do not fully understand the probable dynamics of impending\nchanges in climate. As a result, they are not able to make reliable predictions about the changes in surface\ntemperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and other climatic factors that may occur in the regions of\nCanada or elsewhere. Nevertheless, it can be reasonably suggested that any large changes in climate, and\nespecially in precipitation, would result in fundamental alterations of the structure and productivity of both\nnatural ecosystems and agroecosystems. Those changes would have important consequences for the flows of\nresources that are required by people, as well as for the habitats of other species.\nAs was just noted, changes in climate would influence the ability of landscapes to support agricultural\nproduction. In Canada, this would be particularly true of the great expanses of agricultural land in the Prairie\nProvinces. Much of this terrain is already marginal from a rainfall perspective, and is vulnerable to years of\nseveredrought.Wheat,forexample,isavitalcropthatisgrownextensivelyinareasthatwereoriginallyshort-\ngrass prairie.

It is also affecting the world\u2019s most massive glaciers, in Greenland and Antarctica.\nAn additional predicted effect of global warming is an increase in sea level. This change would be caused\nmostlybyathermalexpansionofseawater,becauseaswaterwarms,itsvolumeincreases.Therewouldalsobe\nan influence on sea level from the melting of massive glaciers, particularly those in Antarctica and Greenland,\nwhich would release some of their enormous mass to the oceans.

These extremes of weather have well known, devastating effects on economic\nandecologicalsystems.Mostoftheclimate-modellingstudiessuggestthattheintensityofwarmingwillbemuch\ngreater at higher latitudes. This means that changes in countries like Canada, where the climate ranges from\ntemperatetopolar,wouldbemuchgreaterthanintropicalregions.Therefore,relativelywealthy,well-developed\ncountries like Canada and the United States may be exposed to much of the damage associated with climate\nchange. Less-developed, equatorial countries may be less directly affected. These predictions are, however,\nhighly uncertain.\nGlobal Focus 17.2. The Kyoto Protocol\nScientists agree that the Earth has a naturally occurring greenhouse effect that helps to keep the\nplanet habitable. They also agree that this key function is due to greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the\natmosphere, whose concentrations are increasing rapidly, particularly carbon dioxide. Although there\nis some controversy as to whether the increased GHGs will intensify the greenhouse effect, scientists\nare rapidly moving toward a broad consensus that considerable warming is likely to occur. Because\nglobalwarmingwouldhavegreatconsequencesforthehumaneconomyandthenaturalworld,mitigative\nactions are being proposed, and in some cases taken, by governments.\nOn the international front, key initiatives related to research and planning are being led by the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO),\nwhichin1988establishedtheIntergovernmentalPanelonClimateChange(IPCC).TheIPCCundertakes\ncomprehensive reviews of the science of global warming, with a focus on likely scenarios of climatic,\necological, and economic consequences. The IPCC also does research on ways to slow or prevent the\nincreases in GHGs and on how economic and ecological systems might adapt to predicted climate\nchange. At the international level, the IPCC is the most credible source of information about climate\nchange. In 2014, the IPCC released its fifth round of technical and policy reports (IPCC, 2014a).\nBecause of concerns about the potentially disastrous consequences of global warming, in 1990 the\nIPCC and other groups of climate specialists recommended that the United Nations (UN) mobilize\nglobal leadership to negotiate an international agreement to reduce emissions of GHGs. The UN then\nestablished an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to draft the terms of a UN Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). After a series of difficult international negotiations, the\nUNFCCCwasdraftedandthenadoptedin1992attheUNConferenceonEnvironmentandDevelopment\n(UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nTheobjectiveoftheUNFCCCistostabilizeatmosphericGHGsatconcentrationsthatwouldpreventa\ndangerousintensificationoftheplanetarygreenhouseeffect.SignatorynationstotheUNFCCC,known\nas \u201cparties to the convention,\u201d have agreed to undertake certain actions to compile information on\nemissions of GHGs, develop policies to decrease emissions, prepare strategies to adapt to anticipated\neffectsofclimatechange,andprovidefinancialandscientificsupporttodevelopingcountries.Moreover,\nthe140countriesthatsignedtheUNFCCCinRioagreedtodiscussitsimplementationataglobalforum,\nwhich was held in Berlin in 1995. At that meeting, it was agreed that global emissions of GHGs should\nbe reduced and a further series of international negotiations was needed to reach consensus on an\n438 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change implementationstrategy.Thosenegotiationswerecompletedatanothermeeting,heldinKyoto,Japan,\nin 1997. The outcome of that key meeting was the Kyoto Protocol.\nAccording to the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, the world\u2019s nations are divided into three groups:\n\u2022 AnnexIconsistsofdevelopedandrapidlydevelopingcountries,includingtheUnitedStates,Canada,\nthose of the European Union, Japan, Russia, and Australia. It also includes rapidly developing\ncountriesthataremajoremittersofGHGs,suchasChinaandIndia,butthesewereexcludedfrom\nthe CO2-reduction obligations of the wealthier countries.\n\u2022 Annex II consists of the same developed countries as in Annex I (38 countries), but not the rapidly\ndeveloping ones (also known as economies in transition). The Annex II countries have special\nobligationstoreducetheiremissions(overallby5.2%comparedwith1990levels),andtheymustalso\nhelp developing countries by providing financial and technological resources to reduce emissions\nand adapt to any adverse effects of climate change.\n\u2022 AnnexIIIconsistsoftheworld\u2019sleast-developedcountries\u2013thesehaveratifiedtheKyotoProtocol\nbut have no immediate obligations to reduce their emissions of GHGs.\nInaddition,manyorganizationshave\u201cobserver\u201dstatus,includingabout50inter-governmentaland650\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) that represent the business, environment interests, industry,\nlabour,indigenouscultures,andresearchandacademicbodies.FortheKyotoProtocoltobecomelegally\nbinding,ithadtoberatifiedbyatleast55partiestotheUNFCCC,includingenoughAnnexIcountriesto\naccountforatleast55%oftheCO2emissionsofalldevelopedcountries(in1990).Canada,theEuropean\nUnion, and Japan ratified in 2002, and when Russia did so in 2004, the 55% criterion was reached and\ntheKyotoProtocolbecausealegaltreaty.Unfortunately,theUnitedStateshadnotratifiedtheProtocol,\nalthough it is nevertheless making progress with actions to reduce its emissions of GHGs.\nKey aspects of the Kyoto Protocol are the binding targets that it sets for the reduction of GHG\nemissions by developed countries. It is important to understand, however, that the Protocol is only a\nfirststeptowardreducingglobalemissionsofGHGs\u2013theintentistonegotiateadditionalprotocolsthat\nwill include reductions by rapidly developing countries such as China and India, and further efforts by\ndevelopedones.Forexample,in2015,theglobalcommunitymetinParistoreviewandimproveuponthe\nexisting Kyoto-related targets to reduce emissions of GHGs.\nThe commitments of Canada are typical of countries of Annex II. When Canada ratified in 2002, it\ncommitted to reduce its emissions of CO2by 6% below the levels in 1990, and to achieve that goal by\n2008-2012. To accomplish such a large reduction was, however, a formidable challenge. In fact, by the\ntargetdate,CanadianemissionsofCO2hadincreasedbyabout33%since1990.Thathadoccurredmostly\nbecauseofrapideconomicdevelopmentsinAlberta,especiallygreatincreasesintheamountofmining\nand processing of oil-sand. Moreover, even today, Canada has not developed an effective strategy for\nmeeting its legal obligations under the Protocol, largely because of the intense political and economic\ncontroversiesassociatedwiththeactionsthatwouldbenecessary.Moreover,thegovernmentsofCanada\nandsomeotherjurisdictions,notablyAlberta,arefocusingonintensity-basedtargets,whichencourage\nimprovedtechnologicalefficienciesbutdonotnecessarilyreducetheaggregateemissionsofGHGs.Such\ntactics do little to reduce the rapid increase of emissions from new fossil-fuel enterprises, such as the\naggressively growing oil-sand industry.\nIn 2012, Canada formally withdrew from its ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This was done by the\nHarperGovernmentofthedaybecauseofthecertaintythatCanadawouldbadlymissitsKyototargets,\ncoupledwithapoliticalphilosophythateconomicgrowthshouldnotbesacrificedtomeetenvironmental\ntargets of this sort.\nChapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change | 439 At about the same time, the Harper Government announced its new target to reduce emissions of\ngreenhouse gases \u2013 to have emissions in 2020 that would be 17% below those in 2005. At the time of\nthiswriting,themostrecentemissions data(for2010)showedthatournationalemissions hadactually\nincreasedby13%(Bodenetal.,2014).Themostimportantreasonforthatincreasewasarapidexpansion\nin large industrial facilities to mine and process oil-sand in northern Alberta, a development for which\nmuchfurtheraggressivegrowthisplannedforthenextdecadeormore.Asaconsequence,itisextremely\nunlikely that Canada`s presently avowed emissions reductions will be met.\nHowever, many other developed countries will have little difficulty in meeting their obligations. For\ninstance, since 1990, many countries of Western Europe have extensively replaced coal-burning\nindustrial utilities with ones that use natural gas, which results in a large reduction of CO2emissions.\nAlso, most countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, have suffered a downsizing of their\nindustrial sectors since 1990, making it easy for them to meet their Kyoto targets. These economic\nrestructurings,whichhadnodirectlinkagetotheKyotoProtocol,didnotoccurinNorthAmerica.The\nonlywaysforcountrieslikeCanadaandtheUnitedStatestoreducetheiremissionsofGHGsistorapidly\nchangethewaysthatenergyisusedbyaggressivelyenactingconservationmeasureswhilealsomoving\naway from a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. It will take a high level of political fortitude if they are to\nachieve such changes, and without such determination, countries like Canada will fail to meet their\ninternational obligations to collaborate with other countries in reducing global emissions of CO2and\nother greenhouse gases.\nEffects of CO on Plants\n2\nCarbon dioxide is an important nutrient for plants. As a result, increased concentrations of CO2can stimulate\nthe productivity of some plants, especially if moisture and nutrients are abundant.\nManylaboratoryexperimentshaveshownthatagriculturalplantscanbemoreproductivewhenfertilizedby\nCO2.Infact,somecommercialgreenhouses increasetheproductivityofcropssuchascucumber,tomato,and\nornamental plants by fertilizing the air with CO2at concentrations of 600-2000 ppm.\nUsually,however,theproductivityofcropsgrownunderfieldconditionsislimitedbyaninadequatesupplyof\nnutrientsotherthanCO2,usuallynitrogen,phosphorus,orpotassium,andoftentheavailabilityofwaterisalsoa\nconstraint.Underthesekindsofconditions,theresponsesofplantstoCO2fertilizationaresmallandshortterm,\nor non-existent.\nIncreased concentrations of CO2can also affect many plants by decreasing their rate of water loss by\ntranspiration.Mostwaterlossoccursthroughtinypores,knownasstomata,ontheleafsurfaces.Thesizeofthe\nstomatal opening is controlled by specialized guard cells.

In essence, carbon credits\ngainedfromoneactivity(suchasplantingtrees)aretradedagainstanotherthatemitsgreenhousegases\n(such as driving a car).\nCarbon credits are related to systems of emissions trading, which were first applied to releases of\nSO2.Forinstance,intheUnitedStates,governmentalregulatorsassignedcompaniesanamountofSO2\nthat they were permitted to emit. If a company exceeded its limit, it could be fined, which provided\naneconomicincentivetomeetitstarget.Alternatively,acompanycouldpurchaseunusedcreditsfrom\nanothercompanythathadnotreacheditsSO2limit.Ineffect,thissystemestablisheda\u201cmarketplace\u201dfor\nSO2-emission credits.\nAlthoughthetradingofcarboncreditsisnotyetregulatedorcertifiedinCanada,theyarestillbeing\nacquiredbymanyindividualsandcompanieswhoareseekingtoreducetheirnetemissionsofGHGsor\nto achieve a carbon-neutral lifestyle or business.

In\nthis context, carbon credits may be viewed as a modern form of the archaic Catholic tradition of\n\u201cindulgences\u201d,ortheforgivenessofsins,thepurchaseofwhichallowedpeopletosinwithoutgreat\nconsequence.\n\u2022 Fictitious carbon credits have been marketed by disreputable people or organizations, Examples\nincludetreesnotbeingplantedascontractedornotbeingtended,sotheydidnotsurvive.Because\ncarbon trading is not yet regulated or audited, there is potential for fraudulent or incompetent\nschemes.\n\u2022 Downsized economies also represent a carbon credit, in that less industrial activity results in\nreduced emissions of GHGs. Examples include the down-sized economies of post-1990 Russia and\nother countries of Eastern Europe. These post-Cold War economies became smaller because of\ninefficienciesoftheirsocialandindustrialsystems,whichhadnothingtodowithactionstoreduce\nemissions of GHGs. It is not sensible to reward a necessary economic restructuring with carbon-\ncredit monies.\n\u2022 Ecological carbon credits must be maintained against natural disturbances, timber harvesting, and\nother influences that would reduce the carbon stored in biomass. Moreover, older forests do not\nforever increase in biomass. Once the maximum is reached, management should maintain the\naccumulatedcarbonorconvertsomeofitinto\u201cenduringconsumerproducts\u201dsuchasthewoodof\nbuildings or furniture.\nClearly, there are a number of ways to generate reliable carbon offsets, and their implementation will reduce\nthenetemissionsofGHGs.However,itisimportantthattheseschemesbeproperlyauditedandregulated.Itis\nalsocrucialtounderstandthatanyeffective,societal-levelplantodealwithemissionsofGHGswillrequirelarge\nreductions in the use of fossil fuels.\nReducing Carbon Dioxide\nBecauseofthepotentialconsequencesofanthropogenicclimatechange,governmentsareconsideringactions\nto reduce the emissions of CO2and other GHGs in the atmosphere, or at least to slow their rates of increase.\nThisgoalcouldbeachievedintwoways:(1)byreducingtheemissionsofGHGs,and(2)byincreasingtheratesat\nwhichtheyareremovedfromtheatmosphere.ThelattertacticisespeciallyrelevanttoCO2,themostabundant\nof the anthropogenic GHGs.\nUltimately,largedecreasesintheemissionsofGHGs,particularlyCO2,mustbethemajortacticofanystrategy\nto deal with an intensification of the greenhouse effect.

An\nenormous area of land would have to be afforested to achieve full offsets.

Politics and Climate Change\nIt is reasonable to conclude that not much of the scientific debate about climate change is actually\naboutwhethertheclimateischanging!Infact,thereisabroadconsensusamongscientiststhatglobal\nclimateshavealwayschanged,thatthisisalsooccurringnow,andtherehasbeenasubstantialwarming\nsince about 1850 when the Little Ice Age ended. Rather, the ongoing dispute is about the role of\nhuman influences on the recent trend of global warming \u2013 whether the recent changes in climate are\nanthropogenic. Although a robust consensus of scientists has concluded that anthropogenic climate\nchangeisaclearandpresentreality,aswitnessedbytheincreasinglystrongstatementsoftheIPCCand\nrelated organizations, there is still a dissenting minority.\nIn general, the climate-change skeptics do acknowledge thatthere has been arecenttrend of global\nwarming,becauseitiswellevidencedbymeltingglaciers,alengtheningice-freeperiodinpolarwaters,\nclimate-related changes of the distribution of many species, and an increase in mean global surface\ntemperature.Nevertheless,theskepticsbelievethatnaturalcausesmayberesponsiblefortheseeffects\n\u2013 such as variations in the emission of energy by the Sun or in the absorptive capacity of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere (perhaps related to changes in reflective aerosols emitted by volcanoes).\nBecausethereisnotyetscientificunanimityaboutanthropogenicclimatewarming,thereisroomfor\npoliticalandeconomicintereststodenythattheproblemisrealorimportant.Thisallowsthemtoavoid\ntakingexpensiveactionstomitigatetheproblem, suchasreducingtheemissions ofgreenhouse gases.\nTo further build their dissenting case, vested economic interests (such as companies in the fossil-fuel\nsector)mayprovidefundingtoclimate-changeskepticsortheirorganizationstohelpmarshaldissenting\nevidenceandengageinthepublicdebate.Furthermore,climate-changeskepticsoftengiveprominence\nto environmental research that runs contrary to mainstream observations of climate warming, such as\nexpandingglaciersinaparticulararea,whichareexceptionstothemuchmorefrequentobservationsof\nmountain glaciers and polar ice that are retreating at rates unprecedented in recorded history.\nArguably, these are legitimate actions for the vested interests to take, because effective societal\nresponses to anthropogenic climate change have such large economic implications. Nevertheless, it\nis possible to view such actions with a cynical eye, because these kinds of tactics have been used\nbeforewithotherpubliccontroversiesrelatedtohealthandenvironment,suchasthalidomide,cigarette\nsmoking, acid rain, and others. In fact, some environmental advocates suggest that it is possible to\nestablishapredictableframeworkfortheresponseofvestedindustrial/economic/politicalinterests\nto public controversies, such as anthropogenic climate change:\n\u2022 Step 1.

Insist that an especially large burden of well-validated scientific evidence must be in place\nbefore agreeing that environmental change has been substantial enough for the vested interest to\naccept a measure of responsibility and so to take mitigative action.\n\u2022 Step 5. Finally, claim that despite any resulting environmental damage, the instigating economic\nactivityistooimportanttotheregional/national/globaleconomytobearsignificantregulation\u2013in\nthesensethatanyslowingofeconomicactivityisviewedasbeingcontrarytovitalnationalinterests\nand therefore unacceptable to society at large.\n444 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change However, there are also cases where people and organizations that believe in anthropogenic climate\nchange have mocked or denigrated the views of skeptics. Moreover, some climate-change proponents\n\u201coversell\u201dsomeoftheevidence.Forexample,someproponentsclaimthathurricaneKatrina(2005)and\nsimilareventsofextremeweatherweresomehowcausedbyglobalwarming.Infact,thisisjustanidea\nand there is no convincing scientific evidence to back it up (although modelling research does suggest\nthat over the medium- and longer-term, the Gulf of Mexico and other tropical waters will become\nwarmer and this might be expected to spawn more and stronger hurricanes). These non-objective\npositionsareparticularlyworrisomeifscientistsareinvolved,becausetheconductandcommunication\nof their knowledge should remain objective and apolitical and not stray into the emotional realm of\nadvocacy.\nMoreover, environmental scientists have a limited ability to provide convincing evidence of an\nanthropogenic influence.

Ideally, environmental controversies should be resolved by a continuous and\nobjective review of the emerging scientific evidence, and by a consensual development of political and\neconomic policies that would effectively mitigate the problem.\nConclusions\nEarth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect is caused by the activity of radiatively active gases in the atmosphere, and\nit helps make the planet habitable. The concentrations of key GHGs are increasing rapidly, particularly carbon\ndioxide,andthisispredictedtointensifythegreenhouseeffect.Thiscouldresultinglobalwarmingandmany\notherclimaticeffects,suchaschangesinprecipitationregimesandinthefrequencyofsevereweatherevents.\nThese changes would have severe consequences for agroecosystems and the human economy in general, and\nalsofornaturalecosystems(notwithstandingthat,insomeplaces,theremightbeimprovementsinagriculture\nand new opportunities for some species and ecological communities). At the international level, the Kyoto\nProtocol is the key first action being taken to reduce the emissions of GHGs that threaten to cause global\nwarming. Many countries have ratified this treaty and are taking steps to reduce their emissions of GHGs\n(unfortunately, Canada withdrew its ratification in 2012 because of an imminent failure to meet its targets for\nreduced emissions). However, the Kyoto-related actions are highly controversial and are not in themselves\nsufficienttoachievetheirintendedgoalofpreventingorslowingglobalwarming\u2013futureactionswillhavetobe\nmore decisive.\nChapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change | 445 Questions for Review\n1. Describe Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect and the factors that create it.\n2. How may human influences be making the greenhouse effect more intense?\n3. What is a greenhouse gas (GHG)? What are the most important GHGs in the atmosphere, and how are\nhuman actions affecting their concentrations?\n4. What are the likely climatic and ecological consequences of an intensification of the greenhouse effect?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. How might the Canadian economy and the lifestyles of typical Canadians be affected if serious actions are\ntaken to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases?\n2. Despite repeated commitments since the Conservative Party of Canada assumed control of the\nGovernment of Canada, our country has not yet announced a comprehensive strategy to reduce our\nnational emissions of greenhouse gases. Especially problematic are a lack of regulations for the fossil-fuel\nindustries, whose rising emissions are the key reason that Canada has missed its avowed Kyoto targets. Do\nyou think that these actions by the Harper Government are prudent and justified, or do you disagree with\nthem? Explain your answer.\n3. Mostly because of the potential economic effects, the Kyoto Protocol has been highly controversial in\nCanada and other countries. But even if the provisions of the treaty are fully implemented, there would\nonly be a slowing of the rate of increase of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This is\nbecause the rates of emission of CO2and other GHGs would still be larger than can be absorbed by the\nplanetary sinks. Should the reductions of emissions of GHGs be even larger than required by the Kyoto\nProtocol? How would you convince politicians, industrial interests, and other concerned parties that it\nmust be done?\nExploring Issues\n1. Your provincial government has struck a committee of politicians and citizens to recommend actions to\nreduce the net emissions of greenhouse gases. As the principal science advisor to the committee, you have\nbeen asked to develop a list of practical options that should be undertaken. What actions would you\nrecommend for implementation immediately, and which more gradually (that is, progressively during the\nnext 10 years)? Justify each of your recommendations.\n2. For one day, make a list of your activities that result in emissions of carbon dioxide or methane to the\natmosphere. These should include direct emissions (for example, by breathing or driving a vehicle) and\nindirect ones (as when trees must be harvested to provide you with paper, or when organic garbage is\ndisposed into a landfill). Estimate the percentage reduction in emissions that you think you could make\nwithout suffering an unacceptable degree of change in your lifestyle.\n446 | Chapter 17 ~ Atmospheric Gases and Climate Change References Cited and Further Reading\nArcher, D. 2011.

Describe the ubiquitous distribution of elements in the environment and explain this phenomenon in terms\nof the difference between pollution and contamination.\n2. Outline cases of natural pollution by toxic elements and explain how they provide insight into the effects of\nanthropogenic pollution.\n3. Describe cases of anthropogenic pollution by metals and outline the resulting ecological damage.\nIntroduction\nAll of the naturally occurring metals and other elements are ubiquitous (found everywhere) in at least trace\nconcentrations in soil, water, air, and organisms. As long as the detection limits of the available analytical\nchemistry are low enough, this universal contamination can always be demonstrated.\nOrganisms require some of the trace elements as essential micronutrients, including copper, iron,\nmolybdenum,zinc,andinsomecasesaluminum,nickel,andselenium.Undercertainconditions,however,these\nsameelementscanaccumulatetohighconcentrationsinorganismsandcauseecologicaldamage(seeInDetail\n18.1).Traceelementsthataremostoftenassociatedwithenvironmentaltoxicityaretheheavymetalscadmium,\nchromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, tin, and zinc, as well as the lighter elements\naluminum, arsenic, and selenium.\nSome cases of elemental pollution are natural in origin. This usually involves metal-rich minerals being\nexposedatthesurfaceandcausinglocalecologicalchanges.However,humanactivitieshavecausedadditional\nexamples of pollution by toxic elements, particularly in the vicinity of industrial sources such as smelters.\nIn addition, emissions of mercury and lead from power plants and automobiles have caused widespread\ncontamination of remote environments, although it is not yet certain that this is causing ecological damage.\nThere are cases of people having been poisoned by exposure to toxic elements in their environment. Some\nhistorians believe that the decline of the Roman Empire may have been hastened by neurotoxicity caused by\nchronicleadpoisoning.TheRomanshadsignificantexposuretoleadbecausetheystoredacidicbeverages(such\naswine)inpotterytreatedwithpigmentsandglazesthatcontainedlead.Aswell,theirwaterpipingwasmade\nof lead (the word \u201cplumbing\u201d is based on the Latin word for lead \u2013 plumbum). In nineteenth-century Britain,\nmany people who made felt top-hats developed neurological damage because of their exposure to mercury\ncompoundsusedtogiveashinyfinishtothehats\u2013henceLewisCarroll\u2019scharacterinAliceinWonderland,the\n\u201cMad Hatter,\u201d and the expression \u201cmad as a hatter.\u201d\nMore recently, thousands of people suffered mercury poisoning during the 1960s after they ate grain that\nhad been treated with mercuric fungicide. In one disastrous case in Iraq in 1971, more than 6,500 people were\npoisoned(about500died)whentheyatefoodpreparedfrommercury-treatedgrain.Thegrainhadbeendonated\nby a foreign aid program and was intended only for planting. Although the sacks of grain were labelled to\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 449 indicatethattheseedswerepoisonous,manyofthevictimswereilliterateordidnotunderstandorignoredthe\nimplicationsofthemessage.Aboutthesametime,similarpoisoningsoccurredwhenpeopleatemercury-treated\ngrain in Guatemala, Iran, and Pakistan. To avoid these problems today, fungicide-treated seed-grain is usually\ndyed red, which warns people not to use it as food.\nMercury also caused thousands of cases of poisoning at Minamata, Japan. A factory there had discharged\nelementalmercuryintoMinamataBay.Inthatformmercuryisnotverypoisonous,butmicrobesinthesediment\ntransformed the metal into methylmercury, which is extremely toxic and bio-accumulates in organisms in\npreferencetothewateroftheiraquaticenvironment.Themethylmercuryfurtherbiomagnifiedupthefoodweb\nandcausedextensivepoisoningoffish-eatingbirds,domesticcats,andpeople(seeInDetail18,1andGlobalFocus\n18.1). In this chapter, we examine natural and anthropogenic pollution with toxic elements and the resulting\necological consequences.\nIn Detail 18.1. Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification\nCertain metals or their organic compounds, such as methylmercury, tend to occur in much higher\nconcentrations in organisms than in the ambient, non-living environment. This phenomenon is known\nas bioaccumulation (also called bioconcentration). Similar tendencies are shown by chlorinated\nhydrocarbons,suchasDDT,PCBs,anddioxins(seeChapter21).Bioaccumulationoccursbecausecertain\nsubstanceshaveastrongaffinityfororganismsandthereforeconcentratewithintheminpreferenceto\ntheirnon-living environment.Manyofthesechemicalsdissolveinbiologicalfluidsandtissues, suchas\nlipid (fat), in preference to ambient water or soil.\nAnother phenomenon, known as biomagnification (or food-web magnification), is the tendency for\ntop predators to have the highest concentrations of these chemicals. Organisms are highly efficient at\nassimilating methylmercury and organochlorines from their food. Therefore, these chemicals become\nstored in organisms, rather than being excreted. This means that predators at the top of the food web\ndevelopthehighestconcentrations(residues)ofthesechemicals.Usually,bioaccumulationandfood-web\nmagnification progress with age, so the oldest individuals in any population are the most contaminated.\nFigure 18.1. Biomagnification leads to progressively higher concentrations of methylmercury and\nchlorinated hydrocarbons in organisms higher in the food web. The common loon (Gavia immer) is\na top predator in many lakes. In some regions of Canada, these birds can harbour concentrations of\nmethylmercury that are high enough to impair their reproduction. The source of the environmental\nmercuryisnotyetknownforcertain,butitmaybeassociatedwithanthropogenicemissionsfrompower\n450 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements plants, incinerators, and smelters.\nConcentration and Availability\nAll ofthenaturallyoccurring elementsarepresentinatleasttraceconcentrations inall samples ofwater,soil\nandrocks,air,andorganisms.Thetermbackgroundconcentrationreferstoapresencethatisnotsignificantly\ninfluenced by either anthropogenic emissions or unusual natural exposures. The background concentration in\nsoil and rocks is usually much higher than in water, and also generally higher than in the tissues of organisms\n(Table 18.1).\nHowever,elementsthataredissolvedinwateroftenoccurinchemicalforms(suchasions)thatarerelatively\neasily absorbed by organisms. For this reason, even a trace aqueous concentration may be toxic. In contrast,\nthe much higher concentrations that commonly occur in soil and rocks are mostly insoluble, and therefore\nare not particularly bioavailable. Scientists determine the total concentration of metals in a component of the\nenvironment(suchassoil,sediment,orrock)bydigestingasampleinahotmixtureofstrongacid.Incontrast,\nthe\u201cavailable\u201dconcentrationisdeterminedfromanaqueous(water)extractofasample.Ingeneral,theavailable\nconcentrationoftoxicelementsinsoilaremuchsmallerthanthetotalconcentrations(generallylessthan1%of\nthe total value), and it is also much more relevant to potential toxicity.\nMostelementsarefoundinonlytraceconcentrationsintheenvironment(Table18.1).Incontrast,aluminum\nand iron are prominent constituents of rocks and soil, with concentrations typically about 8% and 3-4%,\nrespectively. However, almost all of the aluminum and iron in soil and rocks occurs as insoluble minerals that\narenotreadilyavailableforuptakebyorganisms.Forexample,virtuallyallaluminuminsoiloccursasinsoluble\nsilicate and clay minerals. Although aluminum in these forms comprises about 8% of the soil mass, it is not\navailable for uptake byplants and is therefore non-toxic. However,muchsmaller concentrations ofaluminum,\ntypicallyonlyafewpartspermillion(ppm),arefoundasions,eitherboundtoorganicmatterandclaysurfaces\norfreelydissolvedinsoilwater.Theionicformsofaluminumarereadilyavailableforbiologicaluptakeandmay\ncause toxicity to species that are sensitive to this metal.\nMuch higher concentrations of soluble available aluminum occur in strongly acidic environments, especially\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 451 when the pH is less than about 5.5. (In fact, almost all metals are much more soluble under acidic conditions.)\nAluminum solubility is also greater in strongly alkaline environments, with pH higher than about 8. Moreover,\ndifferent ionic species of aluminum occur at different pH levels:\n\u2022 Al3+is dominant in strongly acidic environments with a pH less than about 5.0\n\u2022 AlOH2+and Al(OH)2+ are important under less acidic conditions of pH 4.5\u20135.5\n\u2022 Al(OH)3from pH 5.2\u20139.0\n\u2022 and AlOH4\u2013 in alkaline environments with pH greater than 8.5.\nAluminumtoxicityisacommonproblemfororganismsthatliveinhighlyacidicoralkalineenvironments.This\nisbecauseofthecombinedinfluencesofgreatersolubilityandthepresenceofrelativelytoxicionsunderthose\nconditions.\nTable18.1.BackgroundConcentrationofElementsinSelectedComponentsoftheEnvironment.Source:\nData from Bowen (1979).\nToxicity\nThe toxicity of elements and other chemicals is related to two factors: (1) the exposure (dose) and (2) the\nvulnerability of an organism to the particular substance. The dose received is influenced by the available\nconcentration in the environment and the period of exposure. Therefore, a long-term exposure to only a\nminute available concentration may cause toxicity, especially if the element is able to bioaccumulate and then\nbiomagnify in the food web until it exceeds a threshold of biological tolerance.\nOrganisms vary greatly in their tolerance of exposures to toxic elements (and to all other poisons).\n452 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements Consequently, an intense exposure to a potentially toxic chemical may result in some species being poisoned,\nwhile tolerant ones may not be damaged and may even benefit from the demise of sensitive species in their\ncommunity.Inaddition,thereisusuallygeneticallybasedvariationfortolerancewithinaspecies.Thiscanlead\ntotheevolutionofpopulations(knownasecotypes)thatarerelativelytolerantoftoxicexposures(weexamine\nthis topic in the next section).\nThe most common mechanism of poisoning by toxic elements is damage to an enzyme system. (Organisms\nhaveahugediversityofenzymes,whichareproteinsthatcatalyzespecificbiochemicalreactionsandarecritical\ntohealthymetabolism.)Thepoisoningoccursbecausemetalionsbindtospecificenzymes,whichchangestheir\nshapeandresultsinalossoftheiruniquecatalyticfunction.Toxicelementsmayalsocausepoisoningbybinding\nto DNA or RNA, thereby disrupting transcription and translation, the processes by which genetic information\nis used to produce specific proteins (including enzymes; see In Detail 6.1). Toxic metals can also disrupt DNA\nreplication and hence cell division.\nTypicalsymptomsofacutepoisoningcausedbytoxicelementsinplantsincludeabnormalpatternsofgrowth,\ndecreased productivity, impaired reproduction, the occurrence of disease, and ultimately death. Symptoms of\nchronic toxicity are harder to detect and may include a \u201chidden injury\u201d such as a decrease in productivity\nthat occurs without signs of acute damage. Animals can show a variety of symptoms associated with enzyme\ndisruption, often including neurotoxicity and impaired functioning of the kidneys, liver, and other organs.\nNatural Pollution\nLocalized natural pollution sometimes occurs when metal-rich minerals are present at the surface and are\nprominentinthechemistryofsoil,surfacewater,andvegetation.Theseconditionscanoftenbeidentifiedbya\ndistinctive,stuntedgrowthformofthevegetation,andsometimesbythepresenceofparticularindicatorplant\nspecies.Incombinationwithchemicalanalyses,thesebiologicalindicatorscanbeusedtoexploreformetal-rich\ndeposits, a technique known as biogeochemical prospecting.\nIn some cases, natural pollution by metals can be quite intense. For example, soil containing up to 3% lead\npluszincwasfoundatasiteonBaffinIsland.Inanothercase,peatfilteringaspringofmetal-richgroundwater\ninNewBrunswickaccumulatedasmuchas10%copper.Highconcentrationsofmetalsinsoilarealsoreflected\ninthechemistryofplants,especiallyincertaingeneticallyadaptedhyperaccumulatorspeciesthatmayoccurin\nmetal-richhabitats.Forexample,nickelconcentrationsashighas10%havebeenmeasuredinplantsinthegenus\nAlyssumgrowinginRussia,andupto25%intheblue-colouredlatexofSebertiaacuminatafromNewCaledonia\nin the South Pacific. These hyperaccumulator plants grow on naturally metal-polluted sites.\nSerpentine Soil and Vegetation\nSome well-studied cases of natural pollution involve soil influenced by serpentine minerals, which are rich in\nnickel, chromium, and cobalt and are associated with asbestos deposits. Soil containing serpentine minerals\nis toxic to non-adapted plants because of the high concentrations of these metals, in combination with an\nimbalanceofthenutrientscalciumandmagnesium.Serpentinesoiltypicallycontainsseveralthousandpartsper\nmillion of nickel, but can have as much as 25-thousand ppm (or 2.5%) of this metal.\nThenaturalvegetationonserpentinesitesisoftendistinctivelystunted.Extensiveserpentine\u201cbarrens\u201doccur\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 453 in eastern Quebec and western Newfoundland. Those habitats support tundra-like ecosystems in a landscape\nthat is otherwise covered by boreal forest.\nIn some places, serpentine areas support plant species that occur only in that kind of habitat, a narrow\ndistributionthatecologistsrefertoasendemic.Inothercases,widespreadspecieshaveevolvedlocallyadapted\npopulations that can cope with the toxic and nutritional stresses of serpentine soil \u2013 these are known as\necotypes. On non-serpentine sites, the specifically adapted endemics and ecotypes are quickly eliminated by\ncompetition with plants that are better competitors in less-stressful habitats.\nSerpentine sites in northern California support relatively ancient vegetation, because the area was not\nglaciated. These habitats contain at least 215 endemic species or subspecies of plants. Some of the endemics\noccuronlyonparticularserpentinesitesinCaliforniaandnowhereelseintheworld.Incontrast,theserpentine\nbarrensineasternCanadaarerelativelyyoung,beingreleasedfromglaciationonlyabout10-thousandorfewer\nyears ago. Consequently, not enough time has passed to allow many serpentine endemics or ecotypes to evolve.\nImage 18.1. An extensive area of serpentine-rich rock occurs in Gros Morne National Park in western\nNewfoundland.Soilrichinserpentinehashighconcentrationsoftoxicnickelandcobaltandispoorin\nnutrients. These conditions are stressful to plants and result in the development of stunted vegetation\nof limited species diversity, as in this scene. The typical vegetation on non-serpentine soil in this\nregion is a conifer-dominated boreal forest. Source: B. Freedman.\nSeleniferous Soil and Vegetation\nSemi-arid regions in various parts of the world often have areas with soil that contains high concentrations\nof selenium. These seleniferous habitats may support plants that hyperaccumulate selenium, such as species\n454 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements in the genus Astragalus (locoweeds). About 25 North American species of Astragalus are hyperaccumulators\nof selenium. They may contain up to 1.5% of selenium in their tissues, storing it in unique amino-acid-like\nbiochemicals, such as selenomethionine. The Astragalus species also emit dimethyl selenide and dimethyl\ndiselenide to the atmosphere, giving them a distinctive, unpleasant odour. Livestock that feed on these plants\nare poisoned by a toxic syndrome known as alkali disease or blind staggers.\nMercury in Aquatic Environments\nEveninremoteoceanichabitats,mercuryoftenaccumulatesinhighconcentrations(asmethylmercury,CH3Hg)\ninfish,birds,andseamammals.InmarinewatersoffeasternandwesternCanada,largefishmayhavemercury\nconcentrationsintheirfleshthatexceedthelimitconsideredacceptableforhumanconsumption(morethan0.5\nppm mercury on a fresh-weight basis; Figure 18.1). Analysis of old specimens of fish and seabirds in museums\nhas revealed levels of mercury contamination similar to those in modern samples, which suggests that the\nphenomenon may be natural. The contamination of marine animals represents a substantial biomagnification\nfrom ambient seawater, which has a trace concentration of mercury of less than 0.1 ppb.\nFigure 18.2. Mercury Contamination of Fish Captured Offshore of North America. The data show the\naveragemercuryconcentrationinthemuscleofspeciesofmarinefishes.Thedataareinppm,measured\non a fresh-weight basis. Source: Data from Armstrong (1979)\nThe biomagnification occur because of the progressive accumulation of mercury up the trophic web.

A study of swordfish caught off eastern Canada found that\nanimalsheavierthan45kghadanaveragemercuryconcentrationof1.1ppm,whilethoseweighing23-45kghad\n0.86ppm,andthosesmallerthan23kghad0.55ppm(Armstrong,1979).Itappearsthatmercuryresiduesbecome\nmore intense as the animals age and grow larger.\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 455 Highconcentrationsofmercuryalsooccurinfish-eatingmarinemammalsandbirds,whicharetoppredators\nintheirecosystem.Studiesofadultharpseals(Phocagroenlandica)ineasternCanadafoundanaveragemercury\nconcentrationof0.34ppminmuscleand5.1ppmintheliver(Armstrong,1979).Highmercuryresiduesalsooccur\ninNorthAtlanticseabirds,withanaverageof7ppmfoundinfeathersofnorthernskua(Catharactaskua),5ppm\ninpuffin(Fraterculaarctica),and1-2ppminfulmar(Fulmarusglacialis),kittiwake(Rissatridactyla),razorbill(Alca\ntorda), and common murre (Uria aalge) (Thompson et al., 1991).\nMercury contamination of fish has also been observed in many remote lakes. For example, about three-\nquarters of 1,700 lakes monitored in Ontario have fish with mercury exceeding 0.5 ppm fresh weight in their\nflesh.InaremotelakeinnorthernManitoba,theaveragemercuryconcentrationinmuscleof53northernpike\n(Esoxlucius)was2ppmfreshweightandoneanimalhad5ppm(McKay,1985).Ingeneral,freshwaterfishthatare\ntop predators have the highest residues of mercury, and larger or older individuals are the most contaminated.\nFederal, provincial, and territorial governments in Canada issue advisories about eating fish taken from\nparticular lakes and rivers where mercury residues are known to be a problem; the advisories may also have\ninformation about other contaminants, such as PCBs and dioxins. In Ontario, for example, more than 2,200\nwaterbodiesaremonitoredforthispurpose(MOEE,2014).Theadvisoriestellpeoplehowmanyfishofparticular\nspeciesandsizestheycaneat.Thegeneralthresholdis0.61ppm,butitisaslowas0.26ppmforpregnantwomen\nandchildren,andnofishwithmorethan1.84ppmshouldbeconsumed.Aboutone-thirdoftheadvisoriesgiven\nforsportfishtakenfromOntariolakesresultinsomelevelofconsumptionrestriction.InSweden,abouthalfof\nthelakeshavesomefishwithmercuryexceedingthehealthadvisorylimit(0.5ppm),andhundredsoflakeshave\nbeen blacklisted because their fish are considered unfit for human consumption.\nThecausesofmercurycontaminationoflakesarenotknownforcertain.Itseemslikelythatthephenomenon\nmay be natural in regions that are remote from sources of emission. However, anthropogenic mercury is\ncontributingtotheproblemclosertolargeemissionssources,suchascoal-firedgeneratingstations,municipal\nincinerators, and smelters. For example, Harp Lake in Ontario is located relatively close to municipal and\nindustrial sources of emissions. Studies found that atmospheric deposition accounted for 57% of the mercury\ninput to that lake, suggesting a significant anthropogenic influence (Mierle, 1990).\nThe above discussion of mercury in lakes refers to the many situations in which there are no direct\nanthropogenicinputsofthemetal.However,therearewellknowncasesofpollutioncauseddirectlybyindustrial\nreleases. For example, discharges from chlor-alkali and acetaldehyde factories and some older pulp mills have\ncausedlocalmercurypollution,resultinginhighresiduesofmethylmercuryinfishandotheranimals.Thecase\nofMinamataBay,Japan,involvedanacetaldehydeplant(GlobalFocus18.1).AlessseverecaseinCanada,which\naffected parts of the English and Wabigoon Rivers in northwestern Ontario, involved a pulp mill.\nSignificantbioaccumulationofmercuryalsooccurswhenhydroelectricreservoirsaredeveloped(seeChapter\n20). Flooding leaches naturally occurring soil mercury into the reservoir, where bacteria in oxygen-poor\nsediment transform it into methylmercury that is biomagnified by fish. This process occurs more rapidly in\nacidic lakes because that condition favours the production of methylmercury in the sediment, compared with\nless available dimethylmercury in non-acidic waterbodies.\nAlthough there is some controversy about the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources of\nmercurytoremotelakes,itisreassuringtoknowthattheoverallemissionshavebeengreatlyreducedinrecent\ndecades(Figure18.3).Thisoccurredbecauseofimprovedemissionscontrolsatindustrialfacilities,includingthe\nclosing of several metal smelters and coal-fired power plants.\n456 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements Figure 18.3.

Bacteria in anaerobic sediment\ntransformedthemercuryintomethylmercury,whichbecamebiomagnifiedinfishtoresidesashighas20\nppm.Thefishwereeatenbypredatorybirds,causingtoxicityandreproductivefailure.Fishandshellfish\nwere also harvested and eaten by people living around the bay, which has a long-standing, traditional\nfishing economy. This caused an episode of toxicity that became known as \u201cMinamata Disease.\u201d\nIt took several years for the complex of symptoms caused by methylmercury poisoning to be\nrecognizedasbeingultimatelyduetoemissionsfromtheacetaldehydefactory.Initially,inthemid-1950s,\ndoctors noticed that people were displaying a novel and strange neurological syndrome, characterized\nby progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Symptoms intensified from numbness in the limb\nextremities, to slurred speech, loss of peripheral vision, convulsions, unconsciousness, and ultimately\nthe death of many victims. There was also a congenital syndrome caused by toxicity to fetuses by\nmethylmercury passed across the placental barrier. Afflicted children suffered from deformity, mental\nretardation, and impaired motor control. At the same time, fish-fed cats were killed by a neurological\ndisease, as were fish-eating birds.\nIt soon became apparent that the disease was being caused by eating fish harvested from Minamata\nBay. Although industrial waste being dumped into the bay was an early suspect, not much was initially\ndone to either reduce the discharges or to prevent people from eating seafood caught in the polluted\narea.Then,in1959,scientistsfromKumamotoUniversityconcludedthatanorgano-mercurialcompound\nwasthecauseofthetoxicsyndrome.Soonafter,itwasrealizedthatitsoriginwasinorganicmercuryof\nindustrialoriginthatwasbeingnaturallymethylatedinthebay.Thecompanythatcausedthepollution\nchallenged these conclusions, although it began to pay compensation to some of the most severely\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 457 afflicted people (but only if a release was signed that absolved the company of responsibility and\neliminatedthepossibilityoffuturelawsuits;moreover,manyaffectedpeopleweredeniedcompensation).\nDespiteintensecontroversy,thecompanycontinuedtoreleasemercurytotheaquaticenvironmentuntil\n1968, when a change in technology eliminated it from the manufacturing process.\nUltimately, about 2,200 people were officially diagnosed as having Minamata Disease as a result\nof exposure to methylmercury in seafood harvested from the bay. Of these, about 100 died of their\npoisoning. In addition, at least 12-thousand people may have suffered milder forms of the disease but\nwerenotofficiallydiagnosed.In1973,acourtfoundthechemicalcompanytohavebehavedinanegligent\nmanner and to be liable for the damages. Many people suffering from mercury-caused disease were\nawardedcompensation,althoughtheamountspaidweredisputedasbeinginsufficientandmanypeople\nreceivednothing. Thebottomline, however,isthatpeoplediedofavoidable methylmercurypoisoning,\nand many survivors experienced terrible physical and mental disabilities.\nImportant lessons can be learned from this environmental catastrophe. One is that unanticipated\nconsequences may result from human activities that are thought to be environmentally safe. In the\nMinamatacase,itwasbelievedthatthedumpingofwastewatercontaininginorganicmercurywouldnot\ncauseseriousdamagetothemarineenvironment.Atthetime,itwasnotknownthatbacteriainsediment\narecapableoftransformingmercuryintobio-magnifyingandtoxicmethylmercury.Moreover,evenwhen\nit was recognized that this was happening, and that people and wildlife were being poisoned, business\ninterests and regulatory and political authorities did not act decisively to ensure that people were no\nlonger exposed to the toxic threat. This negligence greatly compounded the problem.\nIn any event, the tragic case of Minamata Bay has improved our understanding of the consequences\nof discharging mercury into an aquatic environment. However, the broader lesson about unintended\nconsequences of poorly considered economic activities is not yet firmly enshrined in our planning and\nregulatory systems.\nAnthropogenic Sources\nIndustrialprocessesusedtomine,process,andusemetalscanresultinthepollutionofair,water,andland(refer\nto Figure 13.1).\nMining Residues\nAreasnearminesitesmaybebadlydamagedbythedumpingofmetal-richexcavationwaste(rockswhosemetal\nconcentration is not high enough to be considered commercial ore).

The locally adapted ecotypes can grow\nin metal-polluted soils, where non-tolerant plants are eliminated by the toxic stress. Conversely, the tolerant\n458 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements ecotypes are poor competitors in non-polluted environments, and so are rare in habitats unaffected by metal\ntoxicity.\nResearchintometal-tolerantecotypeshasprovidedinsightsintotheprocessofevolution(Chapter6).Metal-\ntolerant individuals do occur in populations growing on non-polluted sites, but they are rare. However, the\nfrequencyoftolerantgenotypesincreasesquicklyaftermetalpollutionoccurs.Inplaceswithsharpboundaries\nbetween polluted and non-polluted soils, a tolerant population can maintain itself over a distance of only a\nfew metres.

Plant communities of polluted sites are\ndominated by metal-tolerant ecotypes of several grasses, particularly Agrostis gigantea and Deschampsia\ncaespitosa.Meadowsofthesegrassesdevelopedsoonaftertheextremelytall\u201csuperstack\u201dwascommissionedin\n1972.Becauseitdispersedemissionswidely,thesuperstackgreatlyreducedground-levelSO2pollution.However,\nsoilinthearearemainedacidicandpollutedwithmetals.Thelocalecotypesofthesegrassescantoleratetoxic\nstressfromacidityandmetals,butareintolerantofSO2,whichiswhythegrasslandsdidnotdevelopuntilafter\nthe superstack began to operate.\nThe metal tolerance of the grass Deschampsia caespitosa has been studied.

Plant-available metals were analyzed by\nextractingtailingswithaceticacid,andveryhighlevelsofavailablemetalswerefound,withnickelupto\n87 ppm, copper 81 ppm, and iron 440 ppm.\nThe reclamation procedures result in a stable grassland being established, which is then invaded by\nnative shrubs, trees, and other plants. The methods include the following:\n1. application of 900 kg/ha of limestone (CaCO3), which raises the pH of the tailings to 4.5-5.5 and\nreduces the availability of metals\n2. several applications of fertilizer during the initial stages of grassland establishment, with nitrogen\nbeing especially important\n3. application of an organic mulch to improve the water-holding and aeration characteristics of the\nsurface tailings\n4. sowing with a mixture of long-lived pasture grasses and legumes, as well as annual rye (Secale\ncereale),whichprovidesashort-livednursecropthathelpsmitigatethestressfulmicroclimatefor\ntender seedlings of the perennial grasses and legumes\nAs vegetation establishes and develops on the reclaimed tailings-disposal areas, some animals begin to\nusethehabitat.Birdsthatbreedinthegrassyhabitatanditscentralpondincludemallardandblackducks\n(AnasplatyrhynchosandA.rubripes),Americankestrel(Falcosparverius),killdeer(Charadriusvociferus),\nand savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis).

In most cases today, pollution-control\ntechnologies are used to recover much of the SO2and particulates before the flue-gases are vented to the\natmosphere. In the past, however, those wastes were emitted into the environment, causing intense pollution\nand ecological damage. As recently as several decades ago this was a common practice, and it still is for some\nolder smelters. Newer smelters operate much more cleanly.\nA smelter is a point source of toxic stress to surrounding ecosystems. Emissions may result in well-defined\nspatialgradientsofbothpollutionanditsresultingecologicaldamage,whichdiminishwithincreasingdistance.\nStudies of damage near smelters indicate the following generalizations:\n\u2022 Close to the point source, pollution by atmospheric SO2and metals in soil is most severe\n\u2022 The intensity of pollution decreases rapidly (more or less exponentially) with increasing distance from the\nsmelter.\n\u2022 Damage to vegetation varies with the intensity of toxic stress and includes decreases in biomass,\nproductivity, and species diversity, with only a few low-growing species occurring in the most polluted\nhabitats\n\u2022 Ecological processes such as nutrient cycling and decomposition are disrupted by toxic metals, gases, and\nacidity\n464 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements ThepatternofmetalpollutionaroundapointsourcecanbeillustratedbytheCopperCliffsmelternearSudbury.\nFigure 18.4 shows that metal concentrations in the environment decline rapidly with increasing distance from\nthatsmelter.Thesedataspecificallyrefertotheforestfloor,butsimilarobservationsareseeninsoil,vegetation,\nlakewater, and other components of the ecosystem.\nFigure18.5.MetalPollutionnearSudbury.DecadesofemissionsofmetalsfromtheCopperCliffsmelter\ncaused an accumulation of nickel and copper in the environment. The most intense pollution occurs\nclose to the point source. These data are for metals in the forest floor, which is the organic-rich layer\nthat overlies the mineral soil. The forest floor binds metals in organic complexes and accumulates\nhigher residues than the underlying soil. The samples were collected along a transect running south\nfrom the smelter. The spatial patterns of copper and nickel are highly correlated, with a coefficient\nof 0.98. Source: Data from Freedman and Hutchinson (1980)\nAs weexaminedin Chapter 16, SO2hasalso been animportantpollutantin the Sudburyarea.Consequently,it\nis difficult to determine the specific role of toxic metals in causing ecological damage. One way to investigate\nthe influence of metals is to grow plants in polluted soil in a greenhouse, where SO2is not present. These\nbioassayexperimentshavedemonstratedthatsoilcollectednearthesmeltersistoxic,mainlybecauseofitshigh\nconcentrationsofmetals.Toasubstantialdegree,thetoxicitypersistsevenafterthesoilacidityisneutralized\nby adding lime.\nNot all smelters emit both SO2and metals. The ecological damage that results from those that emit only\nmetallic particulates has consequently been caused by metal pollution.

In Canada, for example, about 2000 tonnes of lead shot\nwereusedbyhunterseachyearintheearly1990s.Althoughmorelocalized,skeetshootingwasalsoaproblem\nbecause of the large amount of shot deposited, up to tonnes of lead each year.\n468 | Chapter 18 ~Toxic Elements After being ingested by a seed-eating bird, lead shot may be retained in the gizzard, a muscular forepouch\nof the stomach. Hard grit is normally retained in the gizzard and used to grind tough-coated seeds, aiding in\ntheir digestion.

Typically, about 10% of the waterfowl surveyed in North America had one or more shotgun\npellets in their gizzard. Larger aquatic birds, such as swans, are known to retain lead fishing weights in their\ngizzard. Lead sinkers or shot were cited as the cause of 20-50% of the mortality of trumpeter swans (Cygnus\nbuccinator) in western North America. Lead sinkers are also known to poison tundra swans (C. columbianus)\nwintering in the eastern United States, mute swans (C. olor) in Europe, and common loons (Gavia immer) in\nCanada and the United States. In Canada, about 500 t/y of lead fishing sinkers and jigs were lost in the early\n1990s.\nA related syndrome, caused by ingesting lead shot and bullets, afflicts birds that scavenge dead carcasses.\nAlthough the numbers are not well documented, this poisoning is known to kill vultures, eagles, and other\nscavengingbirds.ThecriticallyendangeredCaliforniacondor(Gymnogypscalifornianus)hasbeenrelativelywell\nstudied \u2013 about 60% of its known deaths in the wild between 1980 and 1986 were caused by toxicity from\ningested bullets in carrion.

Consequently,\nemissions of lead from automobiles in Canada decreased from about 9,500 t in 1978 to less than 100 t/y since\n1995. However, many other countries, particularly in the less-developed world, continue to allow the use of\nleaded fuels.\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 469 Almostalloftheleadingasolineisemittedasparticulatesthroughthevehicletailpipe.Thelargerparticulates\nsettle out close to the roadway. This results in the buildup of a well-defined gradient of lead pollution, the\nintensity of which is related to traffic volume. This pattern of roadside pollution is illustrated in Figure 18.8\n(this study was made prior to the banning of leaded fuels). Finer lead particulates are more widely dispersed\nin the atmosphere and contribute to the general contamination that occurs in cities. Not surprisingly, studies\nhaveshownsomeeffectsofleadonurbanwildlife.Forexample,pigeons(Columbalivia)livingincitiescanhave\nsignificant residues of lead and may exhibit symptoms of acute poisoning.\nFigure18.9.LeadPollutionandVehicularTraffic.Soilwascollectednearroadsofdifferenttrafficdensity\nin Halifax, and was analyzed for its lead content.

How can we identify normal (or reference) levels, contamination, and pollution by metals and other\nelements given that these substances are ubiquitous in the environment?\n2. What are the important sources of metal emissions to the environment?\n3. What is the difference between the total and available concentrations of metals?\n4. Describe the spatial pattern of metal pollution around a large point source of emissions, such as a smelter.\nChapter 18 ~Toxic Elements | 471 Questions for Discussion\n1. Do you think that environmental damage similar to that near Sudbury is likely to be caused if a new smelter\nis constructed to process the ore mined at the ore deposit at Voisey\u2019s Bay, Labrador? (Note that the ores in\nboth cases are similar \u2013 they contain sulphide minerals of nickel and copper.)\n2. Important environmental benefits have been gained by banning the use of leaded gasoline in Canada. Why\nwere there long delays in taking similarly vigorous actions against the use of lead shot in hunting and skeet\nshooting and lead weights in fishing?\n3. Pick an element that was examined in this chapter and research its benefits, toxicity, effects on the\nenvironment, control, and mitigation.\n4. Explain the principles of bioaccumulation and biomagnification using the case of methylmercury in aquatic\necosystems. Why do you think these phenomena were unanticipated \u201csurprises\u201d to environmental\nscientists?\nExploring Issues\n1. Assume that Canada and the United States are negotiating a treaty to govern their emissions of mercury to\nthe environment. You are a science advisor to the Canadian team. Some members of the team want to press\nfor a \u201czero emissions\u201d policy, believing that no emissions of mercury to the environment are acceptable.\nThey ask for your advice on this issue. What kinds of information about the toxicity of mercury, to humans\nand to wild ecosystems, do you need in order to give the team objective advice about the proposed zero-\nemissions policy? Also, is it physically possible to have zero emissions?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nAllen, H.E., A.W. Garrison, and G.W. Luther III. 1998. Metals in Surface Waters.

Consequently, increasing acidification is usually\ninterpretedasadegradationofenvironmentalquality.Acidificationiscausedbymanyinfluences,bothnatural\nandanthropogenic,butthemostwidespreadproblemsareassociatedwithaphenomenon commonlyreferred\nto as acid rain.\nAcid rain has been an important problem in parts of North America since at least the 1950s, but it did not\nbecome a high-profile issue until the early 1970s. This rather sudden attention resulted from the discovery\nthat acid rain was a widespread problem in Western Europe, and the realization that the same conditions\nlikely occurred in North America. This awareness stimulated research in Canada and the United States, which\ndemonstratedthatacidrainwascausingawidespreadacidificationoflakesandstreams,andpossiblyofsoil.The\nacidificationofaquaticecosystemswasresultinginimportantecologicaldamage,includingthelossofmanyfish\npopulations. Buildings and other materials were also being damaged because acidity erodes metals, paint, and\nsome kinds of quarried stone.\nStrictly speaking, the term \u201cacid rain\u201d refers only to acidic rainfall, which along with snowfall accounts for\nwet deposition. However, acidifying chemicals are also deposited from the atmosphere when it is not raining\nor snowing, through the dry deposition of certain gases and particulates.

Note that a one-unit difference in pH implies a\n10-folddifferenceintheconcentrationofhydrogenorhydroxylions.Thescaleillustratedbelowshows\nthe pH of some commonly encountered substances.\nFigure 19.1. The pH scale and the pH of some familiar substances.\nChemistry of Precipitation\nScientists have adopted a functional definition of acidic precipitation as having a pH less than 5.65. This was\nchosen as the cut-off because at pH 5.65, an aqueous solution of carbonic acid (H2CO3) is in equilibrium with\natmospheric CO2, as follows: CO2+ H2O \u21cc H2CO3\u21cc H++ HCO3\u2013 \u21cc 2H++ CO32-\nThis definition assumes that \u201cnon-acidic\u201d precipitation is essentially distilled water, in which the acidity is\ndetermined only by the atmospheric concentration of CO2and the amount of carbonic acid that subsequently\ndevelops.Thisiswhythethresholdbelowwhichprecipitationisdeemed\u201cacidic\u201dissetattheslightlyacidicpH\nof 5.65, rather than at the strict zero-acidity pH of 7.0 (see In Detail 19.1).\nItis,however,toosimplistictoconsideratmosphericmoistureasconsistingmerelyofdistilledwaterinapH\n476 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification equilibriumwithgaseousCO2.Additionalchemicalsarealsopresentintraceconcentrationsinprecipitation.For\nexample,onwindydays,dustcontainingcalciumandmagnesiumisblownintotheatmosphere,andprecipitation\ncontainingtheseelementsmaydevelopapHhigherthan5.65.Thisisespeciallytrueofagriculturalandprairie\nlandscapes, where the ground surface is often bare of plant cover and soil particles may be easily eroded into\nthe atmosphere. In some other regions, a relatively high concentration of naturally occurring sulphate in the\natmosphere may result in precipitation having a pH less than 5.65.\nThemostabundantcations(positivelychargedions)inprecipitationarehydrogenion(H+),ammonium(NH4+),\ncalcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sodium (Na+). The most abundant anions (negatively charged ions) are\nsulphate (SO42-), chloride (Cl\u2013), and nitrate (NO3-). Other ions are also present, but only in trace amounts that\nhave little influence on the pH (see In Detail 19.2).\nIn Detail 19.2. Conservation of Electrochemical Neutrality\nTheprincipleofconservationofelectrochemicalneutralitystatesthatinanyelectricallyneutralsolution\n(one that does not carry an electrical charge), the total number of positive charges associated with\ncations must equal the total number of negative charges of anions. For the purposes of calculating\na charge balance, the concentrations of ions are measured in units known as equivalents. These are\ncalculated as the molar concentration multiplied by the number of charges on the ion. (When dealing\nwith precipitation or surface waters, microequivalents, or \u00b5eq, are generally the units reported.)\nThisprinciple isrelevanttotheacidificationofwater.TheconcentrationofH+canbedeterminedas\nthe difference in concentrations of the sum of all anion equivalents minus the sum of all cations other\nthan H+. Therefore, if the total equivalents of anions exceed the total equivalents of cations other than\nhydrogenion,thenH+mustgointosolutiontobalancethecation\u201cdeficit,\u201dasfollows:H+=(SO42-+NO3\u2013\n+ Cl\u2013) \u2013 (Na++ NH4+ + Ca2++ Mg2+)\nTheaboveequationhasproventobeusefulinstudiesofacidicprecipitation.Priortoabout1955,the\nmeasurementofpHwassomewhatinaccurate.Therewere,however,reliableanalysesofotherimportant\nionsinsurfacewatersandprecipitation.Insuchcases,theequationcanbeusedtocalculatepre-1955pH\nvalues, providing important data for studies of the historical pH in waters sensitive to acidification.\nOne of the longest-running records of precipitation chemistry is from a research site at Hubbard Brook, New\nHampshire,inaregionexposedtointenseacidifyingdeposition.During1967-1971,whenacidrainwasrelatively\nsevere, the average pH of precipitation at Hubbard Brook was 4.1. This level of acidity then relaxed somewhat\ntopH4.9in1991-1995becauseofdecreasedindustrialemissions,particularlyoftheacid-forminggasSO2,and\nthen even more so in 2009-2013 because of further decreases in SO2emissions (Table 19.1; see In Detail 19.2\nfor an explanation of equivalents). Sulphate and nitrate are the most important anions in precipitation, and\nfrom 1967-1971 they occurred accounted for 88% of the anion equivalents. During 2009-2013 these two still\ncontributed 87% of the anion equivalents, although their total amounts were considerable smaller. These data\nsuggestthatmostoftheacidityintheprecipitationoccursasdilutesolutionsofsulphuricandnitricacids.The\nprecipitation events at Hubbard Brook that are most acidic are associated with storms that have passed over\nthelargemetropolitanregionsofBoston, NewYork,andNewJersey.Theseareashaveenormous emissions of\nSO2and NOx, which are the precursor gases of much of the SO42-and NO3\u2013 in acidic precipitation.\nTable 19.1.

In eastern North America prior to the mid-1950s, precipitation with pH below 4.6 affected\nonly relatively local areas, mostly in southern Ontario, New York, Pennsylvania, and New England. Since then,\nhowever,thisareahasexpandedconsiderably.Atpresent,mostofsoutheasternCanadaandtheeasternUnited\nStatesexperiencesacidicprecipitation.ItappearsthatthespatialpatterninNorthAmericaexistedbeforethe\n1950s,butthephenomenonhassincebecomemorewidespreadanditsintensityhasincreased.Oneofthemost\nimportant aspects of acidic precipitation is the vast size of the areas it affects.\nPrecipitation chemistry varies greatly between regions (Figure 19.1). The variation reflects the patterns of\nemission of SO2and NOx, the degree of oxidation of those gases to SO42-and NO3-, the prevailing direction\ntravelledbypollutedairmasses,andtheamountofacid-neutralizingdustintheatmosphere.Atmosphericdust\nisparticularlyimportantwherevegetationcoverissparse,suchasinagriculturalregionswheretinysoilparticles\nare easily eroded into the atmosphere by strong winds blowing over bare fields. Unpaved roads are also an\nimportant source of atmospheric dust.\nFigure19.2.CharacteristicsofPrecipitationinEasternNorthAmerica.Pointsonthecurvedlines(known\n478 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification as isopleths) have equal annual average values of (a) pH in precipitation; (b) sulphate deposition in\nprecipitation (in kg/ha\u2022y; this is excess sulphate, which is corrected for sulphate of marine origin);\nand (c) nitrate deposition (in kg/ha\u2022y).

Dorset is located in a rural area south-central Ontario, but not far north of the densely populated region\nof Greater Toronto (noted as \u201cpopulated continental\u201d in the table because it is an inland site close to large\npopulation centres to the south). The terrain is underlain by hard rocks of the Precambrian Shield, such as\ngranite,gneiss,andquartzite,andthevegetationcoverismostlyforest.Theprecipitationishighlyacidicinthe\nDorset region, with an average pH of 4.1 and high concentrations of SO42-and NO3-, which suggests that the\nacidity is due mainly to dilute sulphuric and nitric acids. Much of the sulphate and nitrate in precipitation is\nderived from SO2and NOxemitted by industries and automobiles to the south, which are then transported in\nthe atmosphere before being deposited as acidifying deposition in the Dorset region.\nTable 19.2.

Fogwater collected at high\nelevations and at coastal locations is commonly more acidic than pH 4.0, and it can be as acidic as pH 2.5-3.0.\nAtforestedsiteswherefogisacommonoccurrence,largeamountsofacidityandotherchemicalsarefiltered\nout of the atmosphere by trees. This occurs because tiny suspended water droplets coalesce on the surface\nof foliage and bark as fog passes through a forest canopy, a process that removes much of the fogwater from\nthe atmosphere.

U.S. emissions are responsible for\nabout 90% of the wet deposition of acidifying nitrogen compounds in eastern Canada, along with 63% of the\nwetdepositionofsulphurcompounds,43%ofthedrydepositionofnitrogen,and24%ofthedrydepositionof\nsulphur (Shannon and Lecht, 1986). Canada also exports some of its emissions to the United States, although\nCanadian emissions account for less than 5% of the total deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds in\nthe eastern states. In total, Canada receives about 4 million tonnes of SO2per year from the United States\n(Environment Canada, 1999).\n484 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification Dry Deposition\nDry deposition occurs during intervals between precipitation events, and it includes the following:\n\u2022 the direct uptake of gaseous SO2and NOxby vegetation, soil, and water\n\u2022 gravitational settling of larger particles\n\u2022 the filtering of suspended particulates by vegetation\nDrydepositionoccurstoallkindsofhabitat,butforestisparticularlyeffectiveatabsorbinggasesandparticles\nfromtheatmosphere.Thisisbecausetreeshavesuchalargeandcomplexsurfaceareaoffoliageandbark,which\ngreatly enhances the rate of dry deposition.\nDry deposition can result in large inputs of substances from the atmosphere, including some that generate\nacidity when they are chemically transformed within the ecosystem.

The absorbed SO2becomes oxidized to the anion\nsulphite(SO32-),whichisrapidlyoxidizedtosulphate(SO42-).Becausethesulphateisbalancedelectrochemically\nmostly by hydrogen ions, acidity is generated by the transformation of SO2gas into the SO42-ion (see Figure\n19.2).\nFigure 19.3.

The gas ammonia (NH3) and the cation ammonium (NH4+) can also be dry-deposited to soil or\nwater, where they can be oxidized by bacteria to nitrate plus equivalent quantities of H+.\nThe rates of dry deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds are greatest when there are high\nconcentrationsofgaseousNOxandSO2intheatmosphere.Suchconditionstypicallyoccurinurbanareasand\nclose to large industrial sources of emissions. In those places, dry deposition accounts for much larger inputs\nof acidifying substances than does wet deposition. In more remote, less-contaminated environments, far from\nsources of emission, inputs with precipitation are typically larger than dry deposition.\nWithin40kmofthelargestsmelter atSudbury,about55%oftheatmospheric sulphurdeposition occursas\ndrydeposition(Chanetal.,1984).About91%ofthedrydepositioninvolvesgaseousSO2,whiletherestissulphate\nparticulates.However,thesuperstackatthatsmelter,beingextremelytall(380m),iseffectiveatdispersingits\nemissionsofSO2.Consequently,lessthan1%oftheSO2emittedbythatpoint-sourceisdepositednearby(inthis\ncase,within40km).Rather,almostalloftheSO2istransportedmuchfartherawaybeforeitisdepositedtothe\nlandscape.\nSoil Acidity\nSoilacidityisanimportantfactorthataffectsthegrowthofplants.Soilacidificationisanaturalprocessthathas\nbeen demonstrated by studies of succession in ecosystems.\nOnewell-knownstudywasdoneatGlacierBayinAlaska.Themeltingofaglacierinalongfiordisexposing\na mineral substrate of till that has a pH of about 8.0 and contains up to 10% carbonate minerals of calcium\nandmagnesium(CrockerandMajor,1955).Onceexposed,thismaterialbecomesmodifiedbycolonizingplants\nandclimaticfactors.Rainfallisespeciallyimportant,becausemuchofitpercolatesthroughthesoilandleaches\ndissolvedchemicalstobeyondtherootingdepthoftheplants.Theseinfluencesresultinanincreasedacidityof\nthesoil,whichreachesaboutpH4.8after70yearsofsuccession,bywhichtimeaconiferforestisestablished.\nTheacidificationisaccompaniedbylargeandprogressivedeclinesintheamountsofCa,Mg,andcarbonatesin\nthe soil during the succession.\nIn part, the acidification is caused by the uptake of the nutrients Ca, Mg, and K by trees and other plants, a\nprocess that is accompanied by the excretion of H+and a decrease in the buffering capacity of the soil (this is\nrelatedtotheabilityofthesoiltoresistfurtheracidification).Theleachingofcalciumandothercationsoutof\nthe soil by rainwater also contributes to acidification.\nVariouschemicalchangesoccurasrainwaterpercolatesthroughthesoilandinteractswithminerals,organic\nmatter, microbes, and roots:\n\u2022 Roots and microorganisms selectively absorb, release, and transform chemicals\n\u2022 Ions are exchanged at the surfaces of clay particles, minerals, and organic matter\n\u2022 Insoluble minerals are made soluble by so-called weathering processes, including reactions with acids\n\u2022 Secondary minerals are formed, such as certain clays and insoluble precipitates of iron and aluminum\noxides\nThese reactions cause important changes to occur in the soil, such as acidification, the leaching of calcium\nandmagnesium,andthesolubilizationofmetals,particularlytoxicionsofaluminum(suchasAl3+;seeChapter\n18).

Some are carried out by\norganisms,whileothersarenon-biologicalreactions.Thefollowingarethemostimportantfactorsaffectingsoil\nacidity.\n\u2022 Carbonic Acid. In many terrestrial ecosystems, such as grassland and forest, the surface litter and upper\nsoil are rich in organic matter and roots. Decomposition and respiration result in high concentrations of\nCO2(often exceeding 1%) in the atmosphere within the soil. The high CO2concentrations result in carbonic\nacid (H2CO3) forming in the soil water, which contributes to its acidification. This effect is strongest in soil\nwith a pH greater than about 6.0, and it is unimportant in acidic soil with pH less than about 5.5.\n\u2022 The Nitrogen Cycle. Soil acidity can also be affected by microbial transformations of nitrogen compounds\nand by their uptake and release by plants (Figure 19.2). Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) are especially\nimportant because plants must take up one or both of these essential nutrients, the choice depending\nlargely on soil acidity. In soil with pH less than about 5.5, almost all inorganic nitrogen occurs as NH4+. The\nNH4+ may originate from the ammonification of organic nitrogen to form ammonia (NH3), a process carried\nout by many species of microorganisms (see Chapter 5). The ammonia absorbs one H+to form ammonium.\nIf the NH4+ ion is absorbed by a plant root, one H+is excreted into the soil to maintain electrochemical\nneutrality, so there is no net change in acidity. However, if NH4+ is added directly to soil (such as by\natmospheric deposition or by the application of a fertilizer), then plant uptake of NH4+, accompanied by the\nrelease of H+, has an acidifying effect. In soils with pH greater than 5.5, most of the inorganic nitrogen\noccurs as NO3-, which is produced by the oxidation of NH4+ through the process of nitrification (Chapter\n5). Nitrification is carried out by the bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, which are intolerant of acidity.\nThe oxidation of NH4+ to NO3\u2013 generates two H+(Figure 19.2). If the NH4+ originated from ammonification\nof organic nitrogen (which consumes one H+for each NH4+ produced), the net effect is the release of one\nH+for each NO3\u2013 produced from organic nitrogen. However, if the NO3\u2013 is then absorbed by a root, one\nOH\u2013is excreted to the soil to maintain electrochemical neutrality, which is equivalent to the consumption\nof one H+. In that case, the net effect on soil acidity is zero. It is well known to farmers and agronomists\nthat the addition of ammonium to soil can have a severely acidifying influence. This happens because the\nNH4+ becomes nitrified into NO3-, which generates large amounts of acidity. There are two main types of\nammonium inputs: the treatment of agricultural fields with fertilizer containing inorganic nitrogen (such as\nurea or ammonium nitrate), and the deposition of NH3gas and NH4+ from the atmosphere.\n\u2022 TheSulphurCycle.Muchofthesulphurinsoiloccursinorganicallyboundforms.Microbialprocessescan\ntransform this organic sulphur into more highly oxidized compounds, including sulphides and elemental\nsulphur, but if oxygen is abundant, these become further oxidized to sulphate. Overall, the oxidation of\norganic sulphur to SO42-releases one equivalent of H+per equivalent of SO42-produced (this is the same\nas two H+per SO42-SO42-is absorbed by a root, an equivalent quantity of OH\u2013is excreted to conserve\nelectrochemicalneutrality,sothereisnoneteffectonacidity.However,ifatmosphericdepositioncausesa\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 487 directinputofSO42-tothesoil,followedbyuptakebyplantroots,theneteffectisareductionofacidity.In\naddition,ifthesoilisdeficientinoxygen(anaerobic),ascommonlyoccursinwetsites,thentheSO42-can\nbetransformedbymicrobesintoasulphidecompound,whichresultsintheconsumptionofanequivalent\namount of H+and a reduction in acidity.\nReactions associated with the sulphur cycle usually have a smaller effect on soil acidity than those\ninvolving the nitrogen cycle. In certain situations, however, the sulphur cycle is dominant. For instance,\nwhen a wetland is drained, its previously anaerobic sediment becomes aerobic. This allows bacteria to\noxidize reduced sulphide compounds into sulphate. Some drained wetlands develop an extremely acidic\ncondition known as acid sulphate soil. For 10 or more years after drainage occurs, usually to develop\nagriculturalland,thepHcanbelowerthan3.0.Thisseverelyimpairscropgrowth,althoughtheaciditycan\nbe neutralized by adding calcium carbonate (lime) to the soil.\nSometimes, sulphide minerals such as pyrite (iron sulphides) become exposed to atmospheric oxygen.\nThisallowsspecializedThiobacillusbacteriatooxidizethesulphides,aprocessthatproducessulphateand\noxidizedironions,accordingtothefollowingreaction:4FeS2+15O2+14H2O\u21924Fe(OH)3+16H++8SO42-\nThisphenomenon,knownasacid-minedrainage(orasacid-rockdrainage),causessevereacidificationof\nsoilandsurfacewaters.ItcancauseapHlessthan2.0todevelop,withhighconcentrationsofsulphateand\ntoxicionsofaluminumandiron.Acid-minedrainageisanimportantproblemwherecoalandmetalmining\nhave exposed mineral sulphides to the atmosphere (see In Detail 19.3).\n\u2022 Uptake of Basic Cations by Plants. Terrestrial plants obtain many of their nutrients by absorbing ions from\nthe soil in which they are growing. (A few nutrients, however, are absorbed mainly from the atmosphere,\nparticularly CO2.) Calcium, magnesium, and potassium are important nutrients that are absorbed from soil\nas cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+), whose absorption is offset by a release of H+. In natural ecosystems, the\nabsorbed Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ are eventually returned to the soil with plant litter, so there is no long-term\neffect on soil acidity. However, if biomass is removed from the site, as occurs in agriculture and forestry,\nthese cations are removed, resulting in acidification of the soil.\n\u2022 Leaching of Ions. In most soils, the anions nitrate and chloride readily leach downward into the\ngroundwater. They do this because they are highly soluble in water, and are only weakly retained at anion-\nexchange sites on organic matter and clays. The leached anions may eventually reach surface waters such\nas streams and lakes. This is also true of sulphate, especially in relatively young soils of glaciated regions,\nincluding most of Canada (older soils of more southern regions often have a greater capacity to retain\nsulphate). In areas with large inputs of acidifying substances, the amounts of NO3\u2013 and SO42-in soil may be\nhigh enough to result in substantial rates of leaching. As these anions leach from the soil, they are\naccompanied by cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, H+, and Al3+, which results in acidification, nutrient loss, and\ntoxicity (associated with the Al3+) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. For instance, one monitored\nwatershed in south-central Ontario was found to have lost 30% of its soil calcium between 1983 and 1999\n(Watmough and Dillon, 2004).\nAtmospheric Deposition and Soil\nThe potential effects of atmospheric deposition on soil acidity have been studied in experiments in which\nsimulated rainwater solutions was added to soil contained in plastic cylinders, known as lysimeters. These\nexperiments have shown that extremely acidic solutions can cause these changes in soil chemistry:\n\u2022 an increase in acidity\n488 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification \u2022 increased leaching of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, resulting in their depletion and greater\nvulnerability of the soil to acidification\n\u2022 increased solubilization of toxic metal ions, especially of aluminum, but also iron, manganese, and others\n\u2022 an overwhelming of the ability of soil to absorb sulphate, after which this ion leaches freely, at a rate similar\nto its input (because SO42-is an anion, its leaching is accompanied by base cations and toxic Al3+and H+,\nwhich may contribute to the acidification and toxicity of surface waters.)\nOneexperimentinvolvedthetreatmentofasandysoilfromjackpinestandswithsimulatedrainwater,adjusted\nwith sulphuric acid to a pH of 5.7, 4.0, 3.0, or 2.0 (Table 19.4).

Keep in mind that experiments such as these are short-term investigations, whereas\nsoil acidification in nature is a slow, long-term process.\nTable19.4.ExperimentalLeachingofSoilbyAcidicSolutions.Thedataareconcentrationsofchemicalsin\nwaterthatdrainedfromlysimeterscontainingsandysoilcollectedfromtwojackpine(Pinusbanksiana)\nstands in northern Ontario.

For instance, the\nconversionofagriculturallandintoconiferforestusuallyresultsinacidificationofthesoil.InsouthernOntario,\nthe afforestation of abandoned farmland with pine or spruce caused the soil to acidify from pH 5.7 to pH 4.7\nafter46yearsofforestdevelopment(Brandetal.,1986).Itislessunderstoodwhetheralready-forestedsiteswill\nbecome more acidic because of atmospheric inputs of acidifying substances. A study in southern Ontario re-\nsampledforestsoilsaftera16-yearinterval,inaregionwheretheaveragepHofprecipitationisabout4.1,butno\nfurther soil acidification was observed (Linzon and Temple, 1980).\nOverall, studies conducted elsewhere in Canada, and in the United States and Europe, have also come to\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 489 ambiguousconclusionsabouttheeffectsofatmosphericdepositiononsoilacidification.Exceptforcaseswhere\ntheatmosphereisseverelypollutedbySO2,suchasnearametalsmelter,thereisnoconvincingevidencethat\natmospheric deposition has acidified soil on a wide scale. It appears that soil acidification is a potential long-\nterm risk associated with this type of pollution.\nTerrestrial Vegetation\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that plants may be injured by treatment with simulated \u201cacid rain.\u201d In\nalmostallofthestudies,however,thepHthatcausedacuteinjurieswasmoreacidicthanisnormallyfoundin\nambient precipitation.\nFor example, experiments in Norway exposed young conifer stands to simulated acid rain for three years\n(Tveite, 1980). The control treatment was pH 5.6-6.1, while the acidified treatments used pH 4.0 or 3.0. On\naverage, control saplings of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) grew 15\u201320% less than plants receiving the acidic\ntreatments. Growth of Scotch pine (P. sylvestris) and birch (Betula pendula) was also stimulated by the acidic\ntreatments, while spruce (Picea abies) was unaffected. However, the moss-dominated ground vegetation was\nseverely damaged by the most acidic treatment (pH 3.0).\nLaboratory experiments are also useful for determining the effects of rainwater pH on plants, because the\nenvironmentalconditionscanbewellcontrolled.Ingeneral,suchexperimentsdonotfindreductionsofgrowth\nuntilthepHbecomesmoreacidicthanabout3.0(forcomparison,theaverageacidityofprecipitationisabout\npH4.0inregionswhereacidrainisconsideredasevereproblem).Moreover,theproductivityofsometolerant\nspeciesmaybestimulatedbyrainwaterevenmoreacidicthanpH3.0.Forexample,seedlingsofwhitepine(Pinus\nstrobus) grew more quickly when exposed to acidic mist ranging from pH 2.3 to 4.0than at pH 5.6 (Wood and\nBormann,1976).Inanotherexperiment,seedlingsof11treespeciesweretreatedwithsolutionsofvariouspHs,\nbut acute injury to foliage was caused only after a week of treatment at pH 2.6, which is an unnaturally acidic\nexposure (Percy, 1986).\nIngeneral,itappearsthattreesandothervascularplantshavelittleriskofsufferingacuteinjuryfromexposure\nto ambient acid rain.

Moreover, agricultural soil is routinely treated with liming agents to reduce its acidity.\nImage 19.2. During the 1980s, many stands of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in Ontario and Quebec\nsuffered a severe thinning of their canopy. In some places, many trees died.

This so-called acid shock phenomenon occurs partly because\nsnowmelt cannot percolateintothefrozensoil, soitsaciditydoes notbecomeneutralizedbyinteraction with\nminerals there. In addition, the initial meltwaters are considerably more acidic than the later fractions. The\nrelatively intense acidity of snowmelt is responsible for much of the toxicity of affected surface waters.\nThewaterchemistryoftwolakesinaregionofNovaScotiathatissubjecttoacidicprecipitationisdescribed\nin Table 19.5.

The sensitivity of surface waters to acidification is related to the amount of alkalinity in their water,\nwhich itself is associated with the amounts of calcium and magnesium in soil and rocks of the watershed (see\nthe following section). Surface waters on 46% of Canada\u2019s land area (about 4.0-million square kilometers) are\nconsidered highly sensitive to acidifying deposition, and another 21% (1.8-million km2) are moderately sensitive.\nThe chemical and biological changes that occur as surface waters become acidified have been examined\nin important studies in which sulphuric acid was deliberately added to lakes (Schindler, 1990). These whole-\nlake experiments were conducted in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) of northwestern Ontario. The most\nintensivelystudiedlake,namedLake223,isa279ha,oligotrophicwaterbody.Lake223wasstudiedfortwoyears\nbefore it was experimentally acidified, and then for a number of years afterward. Beginning in 1976, sulphuric\nacidwasaddedtoacidifythelake,whichreduceditspHfrom6.5initiallyto5.0-5.1during1981-1983.Itsacidity\nwas then allowed to decrease to pH 5.5-5.8 during 1984-1988.\nAs expected, the concentrations of sulphate and hydrogen ions increased in Lake 223, because these were\nadded to the lake. Sulphate averaged 35 \u00b5mol/L in 1975, compared with 115 \u00b5mol/L in 1979. Increased\nconcentrations of manganese (a 980% increase by 1980), zinc (550%), and aluminum (155%) occurred because\nthesechemicalsdissolvedoutofsedimentundertheacidifiedconditions.Acidificationalsocausedthewaterto\nbecome more transparent, which allowed increased light penetration and deeper heating during the summer.\nMany biological changes also occurred; these are described later in this chapter.\nIn Detail 19.3. Acid-rock Drainage.\nAcid-rock drainage (ARD; also known as acid-mine drainage) refers to flows of water that have been\nseverely acidified by the oxidation of pyrite and other reduced-sulphur minerals. ARD usually involves\npollution associated with coal mining, but it may also be associated with metal mining. The acidity is\nproducedbytheexposureofpyriticminerals,usuallyironsulphide,toatmosphericoxygen,whichallows\nspecializedThiobacillusbacteriatooxidizethesulphidesandproducesulphateandoxidizedironions,as\nfollows: 4 FeS2+ 15 O2+ 14 H2O \u2192 4 Fe(OH)3+ 16 H++ 8 SO42-\nNotethelargenumbersofH+thatareproduced\u2013thesecanleadtoseverelyacidicconditionsinwater\ndraining from the substrates where the reactions are occurring.

These reactions consume acidity, while also causing toxic metal ions to\nprecipitate from solution.\nVulnerability to Acidification\nSurface waters that are vulnerable to acidification have a low alkalinity, or acid-neutralizing capacity.

Source: Modified from Henriksen (1980).\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 495 The concentration of bicarbonate in natural waters is influenced by geochemical factors, especially by the\npresence of limestone (CaCO3) or dolomite (Ca, MgCO3) in soil or bedrock of the watershed or in the aquatic\nsediment. As these minerals dissolve, they create bicarbonate alkalinity and give the water a degree of acid-\nneutralizing capacity. If carbonate-rich minerals are abundant in a watershed they can generate enough\nalkalinity to neutralize acidifying inputs from the atmosphere. As a result, surface waters in these kinds of\n496 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification watersheds are not sensitive to acidification, even in a region where the atmosphere and precipitation are\npolluted (except perhaps in cases of extremely high rates of dry deposition of SO2).\nThe situation is different, however, in watersheds in which the bedrock, soil, and sediment are derived\nfrom hard, poorly soluble rocks such as granite, gneiss, and quartzite, which contain few carbonate minerals.\nWatershedsofthistypehavelittlecapacityforgeneratingalkalinityandsotheyareeasilyacidifiedbywetand\ndrydepositionsfromtheatmosphere.VulnerablewatershedsareespeciallycommonineasternCanada,where\nthin soils derived from carbonate-poor glacial till commonly overlie hard granitic bedrock.\nHeadwater lakes and streams are at particular risk of acidification. These systems receive no drainage from\nwaterbodiesathigherelevation,andtheirwatershedsareusuallysmall.Consequently,thereislittleopportunity\nfor rainwater to interact with soil and bedrock, and much of the acidity in precipitation does not become\nneutralized before the water reaches headwater lakes and streams.\nAthighelevationinmanymountainousregions,crustalgraniteisexposedbyerosionandtheterraininsuch\nregionsmayalsobevulnerabletoacidification.ThisisthecaseinpartsoftheRockyMountainsofwesternNorth\nAmerica and in the Appalachians of the eastern United States.

The depletion of calcium and magnesium represents a depletion of the acid-\nneutralizing capacity of a waterbody, and it is a physiological issue for organisms that need large amounts\nof those cations to form their shells of calcium carbonate (such as mussels) or chitin (a glucose-derived\npolysaccharidethatneedscalciumtoharden).Theoccurrenceofaquaticosteoporosishasbeendemonstrated\ninlakesineasternCanada,andadditionalresearchwilllikelyshowthatitiswidespreadproblem(Jeziorskietal.,\n2008).\nFreshwater Organisms\nManychangesoccurinthebiotaasfreshwaterecosystemsbecomeacidified.Ingeneral,freshwaterorganisms\nare considerably more sensitive to the acidification of their habitat than are terrestrial plants.\nFreshwater Algae\nMany species of microscopic, single-celled algae (phytoplankton) live in lakes. The water chemistry greatly\ninfluences the particular species that are present. Because species of diatoms (family Bacilliarophyceae) and\ngolden-brownalgae(Chrysophyceae)areparticularlysensitive,theyareusefulindicatorsofwaterchemistry.For\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 497 example,astudyof72lakesintheSudburyareafoundthatcertaindiatomspecieswereindicatorsofparticular\naspects of water chemistry (Dixit et al., 1991):\n1. indicators of acidic water: Eunotia pectinatus, Fragilaria acidobiontica, Pinnularia subcapitata, Tabellaria\nquadriseptata\n2. indicators of acidic water with high metals (Cu, Ni): Eunotia exigua, E. tenella, Frustulina rhomboides\nsaxonica, Pinnularia hilseana\n3. indicators of non-acidic water: Achnanthes lewisiana, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Fragilaria construens, F.\ncrotonensis The silica-rich cell walls of diatoms differ in shape for each species, and they persist in lake\nsediment after death of the cell. As well, the water-chemistry requirements of many diatom species are\nknown. Consequently, the abundance of diatom fossils in dated layers of lake-sediment cores can be used\nto infer historical communities and water chemistry. This technique has been used to demonstrate that\nsome presently acidic lakes in eastern Canada were not acidic as recently as several decades ago.\nThe phytoplankton community changed markedly during the acidification of Lake 223 in the Experimental\nLakes Area (Findlay and Kasian, 1986). Initially, it was dominated by species of golden-brown algae, but with\nacidificationthischangedtogreenalgae(Chlorophyceae).Althoughspeciescompositionchangedsubstantially,\ntherewaslittledifferenceinthediversityofspecies.Asmallincreaseinalgalbiomassoccurredasaresultofthe\nacidification,likelycausedbyincreasedwaterclarity,whichallowedmoreproductivitytooccur.WhenLake223\nwas allowed to become less acidic, algal species typical of the pre-acidification community quickly reappeared.\nHowever,thephytoplanktoncommunityismuchmoresensitivetofertilityofthewaterthantochangesinits\nacidity,beingespeciallyresponsivetophosphorus(seeChapter20).Infact,theproductivityofalmostallfresh\nwaters increases if they are fertilized with phosphorus.

Moreover, the invasion by Sphagnum may intensity acidification, because these mosses are\nhighly efficient at absorbing Ca2+, Mg2+, and other cations from the water, which they exchange for H+. Mats\nof Sphagnum also interfere with chemical reactions at the sediment/water interface, which hinders the\nneutralization of acidity that occurs there.\n498 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification Communities of aquatic plants differ greatly between clear-water acidic lakes and those with organically\nstained water. For example, Pebbleloggitch Lake (Table 19.5) has dark-brown, acidic (pH 4.5) water, which\nprevents light penetration into deeper habitats. Consequently, aquatic plants can grow only within a shallow\nfringe around the edge of the lake, and only 15% of the bottom is vegetated (Stewart and Freedman, 1989).\nThe most abundant macrophytes, such as the yellow water-lily (Nuphar variegatum), have floating leaves. In\ncomparison,nearbyBeaverskinLakehasextremelyclearwaterandvirtuallytheentirebottomreceivesenough\nlighttosupportaquaticplants,eventoadepthof6.5m.Manyofthemacrophytes,includingmatsofSphagnum,\nmaintain all of their foliage underwater.\nEven in acidic lakes, the productivity of macrophytes is stimulated by the addition of nutrients.

The effects of acidification on zooplankton are complex because several factors are involved:\n\u2022 the toxicity of H+and metals, such as Al3+\n\u2022 changes in the availability of phytoplankton as food\n\u2022 changes in predation, especially if zooplankton-eating fish are eliminated\nAsurveyof47lakesinOntariofoundthatcertainzooplanktonaregoodindicatorsofwaterchemistry(Sprules,\n1975). Indicator species of acidic lakes with pH < 5.0 wereDaphnia catawba,D. pulicariaandPolyphemus\npediculus. Others occurred only at pH > 5.0:Daphnia ambigua,D. galeata mendotae,D. longiremis,D.\nretrocurva,Diaptomus oregonensis,Epischuralacustris,Leptodorakindtii,andTropocyclops prasinusmexicanus.\nHowever, some zooplankters were indifferent to acidity and occurred over a wide range of pH.

Throughout\ntheacidification,DiaptomusminutusandCyclopsbicuspidatusremainedthemostabundantzooplankters,but\nsome other species were intolerant. This included the opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta), a large predator that\ndisappeared when the pH decreased below 5.6.\nBenthic Invertebrates\nBenthic invertebrates live on or in the sediment of waterbodies. The number of species tends to be lower in\nacidic waters, but they can still be abundant, especially it predatory fish have disappeared. The most common\nbenthic invertebrates in acidic lakes are species of insects and crustaceans (although other species of these\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 499 groups are intolerant of acidity). Molluscs do not occur in strongly acidic conditions because it is difficult for\nthemtomaintaintheirshellofcalciumcarbonate.AstudyofmorethanathousandlakesinNorwayfoundthat\nno species of clams could tolerate a pH below 6.0, and no snails below 5.2 (Okland and Okland, 1986).\nBecausesedimentismorestronglybufferedthanitsoverlyingwater,itismuchlessvulnerabletoacidification.\nFor instance, the acidity of sediment did not change much during the experimental acidification of Lake 223\n(Kelly et al., 1984). When the pH of water just above the sediment was 5.3, at 0.5 cm into the sediment it was\n6.0, and at 2.0 cm it was 6.7, unchanged from the pre-acidification condition. Because the habitat of benthic\ninvertebrates is well buffered, some of them are not much affected by acidification of the overlying lakewater.\nDuringtheacidificationofLake223,theabundanceofchironomidmidgesincreasedandpeakedatawaterpH\nofabout5.6(Mills, 1984).However,theinitiallyabundantmayflylarvaedisappearedatpH5.0,andthecrayfish\nOrconectes virilis became extirpated because of reproductive failure after the pH fell below 5.6.\nFish\nFish populations are the best-known victims of acidification. Many losses of trout, salmon, and other\neconomically important fish have occurred in acidified waters in Canada, the United States, and Eurasia.\nStudies in Ontario have documented the loss of fish populations from acidified lakes in the Killarney region\n(BeamishandHarvey,1972;HarveyandLee,1982).Thatareaissubjecttoseverelyacidicprecipitation(pH4.0-4.5)\nand to dry deposition of acidifying SO2because of its proximity to the smelters at Sudbury. A survey in the\n1970s found that 33 of 150 lakes in the Killarney area had a pH below 4.5. These ecologists actually monitored\nthe local extirpation of several fishes in Lumsden and George Lakes. There was also anecdotal evidence for\nlossesofotherpopulations,becauselocalpeoplehadamemoryofhistoricalsportfisheriesincurrentlyfishless\nlakes.TheKillarneyareahashad17extirpationsoflaketrout(Salvelinusnamaycush),animportantsportfishthat\ncannotbreedatpH<5.5.Therearealsoextirpationsofsmallmouthbass(Micropterusdolomieiu)from12lakes,\nof largemouth bass (M. salmoides) and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) from four lakes, and yellow perch (Perca\nflavescens) and rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) from two lakes.\nLumsdenLakeacidifiedfrompH6.8in1961to4.4in1971.Thatacidificationresultedinareproductivefailure\nandextirpationoflaketrout,lakeherring(Coregonusartedii),andwhitesucker(Catostomuscommersoni).When\nGeorge Lake reached pH 4.8-5.3, lake trout, walleye, burbot (Lota lota), and smallmouth bass disappeared.

These extirpations resulted from\npersistent failures of these fishes to reproduce in acidified lakes.\nLosses of sportfish populations have also occurred in Nova Scotia, where Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has\nbeenlostfromacidic(pHbelow4.7)rivers,butnotfromthosewithhigherpH(Figure19.4).LacroixandTownsend\n(1987)pennedjuvenilesalmoninfouracidicstreamsinNovaScotia\u2013nonesurvivedinpHbelow4.7,butalldidat\nhigher pHs.\nFigure 19.5.

Most Canadian species lay their\neggs in water, which their larvae inhabit until metamorphosis occurs, after which the adults utilize nearby\nterrestrial habitat. Research suggests that some species of amphibians are vulnerable to acidification of their\naquatic habitat, while others appear to be indifferent.\nA study of amphibian breeding sites in Nova Scotia, covering a pH range from 3.9 to 9.0, found that some\nspecies were not obviously influenced by acidity (Dale et al., 1985):\n\u2022 the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) occurred from pH 4.0 to 9.0\n\u2022 spring peeper (Hyla crucifer) and yellow-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) from pH 3.9 to 7.8\n\u2022 green frog (R. clamitans) from pH 3.9 to 7.3\n\u2022 and wood frog (R. sylvatica), from pH 4.3 to 7.8.\nYellow-spottedsalamanderandgreen,bull,wood,andpickerel(R.palustris)frogsallhadeggs,developinglarvae,\nand adults present in some habitats at pH 4.0, suggesting that reproduction was occurring at that extreme\nacidity. Studies in other regions, however, have shown that some species of amphibians are intolerant of acidity.\nLaboratory experiments with 14 species of amphibians found that exposing eggs to pH 3.7-3.9 caused more\nthan 85% embryonic mortality, while prolonged exposure to pH 4.0 caused a rate of mortality >50% (Freda\net al., 1991). It must be borne in mind, however, that an aquatic pH as acidic as 4.0 is uncommon in nature.\nMoreover, such acidic conditions are usually associated with acid-mine drainage or natural bogs, rather than\nwith acidification caused by atmospheric deposition (which has an acidification threshold of about pH 4.5 or\nhigher).Overall,itappearsthatmostspeciesofamphibiansarelessvulnerablethanfishtosufferingpopulation\ndeclines caused by acidification.\nAquatic Birds\nDirectly toxic effects of acidification on waterfowl and other aquatic birds have not been documented and\nprobably do not occur. However, acidification causes aquatic habitats to change, and this has indirect\nconsequences for bird populations. For instance, if acidification eliminates populations of smaller fishes, then\nfish-eating waterfowl such as the common loon (Gavia immer) and merganser (Mergus merganser) will suffer,\nas will piscivorous raptors such as osprey (Pandion haliaetus). At the same time, however, the extirpation of\npredatoryfishcouldresultinanincreasedabundanceofaquaticinsectsandzooplankton,whichimprovesthe\nfoodresourceforotherwaterfowl,suchasmallard(Anas platyrhynchos),blackduck(A.rubripes),ring-necked\nduck (Aythya collaris), and goldeneye (Bucephala clangula).\nThe breeding success of common loons was studied on 84 lakes in Ontario (Alvo et al., 1988). Only 9% of\nbreeding attempts were successful on low-alkalinity lakes ( < 40 \u00b5eq/L), which are either acidic or vulnerable\ntoacidification.Incontrast,57%ofbreedingattemptsweresuccessfulonlakeswithalkalinityof40-200\u00b5eq/L,\nand 59% if > 200 \u00b5eq/L. These observations likely reflect the size of the fish populations in these lakes.\n502 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification Astudyof79smalllakesandpondsinNewBrunswickfoundalargerbiomassofaquaticinvertebratesinthe\nlittoralzone(shallow,near-shore)inacidicwaterbodieswithpH4.5-4.9thaninthosewithpH>5.5(Parkeretal.,\n1992).Fivespeciesofducksthatfeedoninvertebrateshadanaverageof3.5broods/haonwaterbodieswithpH\n5.5,comparedwith0.65broods/haathigherpHs.Thegreaterbiomassofinvertebratesintheacidicwaterbodies\nwas likely due to decreased predation because of a reduced fish community.\nDrainLakeinNovaScotiawaspreviouslydescribedasahighlyacidic(pH4.0)buteutrophiclake.DrainLake\nis fishless but it has large populations of aquatic invertebrates and plants. This habitat allows black ducks and\nring-necked ducks to be more productive than is typical for lakes in the region (Kerekes et al., 1984).\nReclamation\nEven before acidification became a high-profile issue, wildlife managers in some regions were \u201cimproving\u201d\nhabitat for sportfish in brown-coloured lakes by treating the acidic water with powdered limestone (calcium\ncarbonate, CaCO3) or lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2). These treatments, known as liming, serve to reduce\nacidity, clarify the water, and improve the productivity of fish such as trout. Not surprisingly, considerable\nresearchhasalsobeendoneontheuseoflimingtreatmentstoimprovetheconditionoflakesandothersurface\nwaters that have been acidified by atmospheric deposition.\nEffects of liming on pH are illustrated in Figure 19.5 for three limed lakes and one reference (non-limed but\nacidic)lakeinOntario(Dillonetal.,1979;Yanetal.,1979).Initially,thetreatedlakeshadapHof4.0-5.0,butthis\nwas increased to pH 7.0-8.0 by the whole-lake liming treatment.

Effects of Liming Lakes. These lakes are located in the Sudbury region, and they were\nacidified by a combination of dry and wet atmospheric depositions. The times of treatment with\nneutralizing agents (CaCO3or Ca(OH)2) are indicated by arrows, and the addition of phosphate by\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 503 solid dots. Source: Modified from Dillon et al. (1979).\nInitially, the treated lakes had a large decline in the productivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton. However,\nthe phytoplankton biomass soon returned to the pre-liming condition, but with lingering changes in species\ncomposition.Thezooplanktonrecoveredmoreslowly,andevenafterthreeyearshadnotreturnedtothepre-\nliming abundance. In addition, fish kept in cages in the limed lakes suffered high rates of mortality.

Nevertheless, it must be\nunderstood that liming treats the symptoms of damage in acidified ecosystems, but not the causes of the\nacidification. Moreover, liming itself represents an environmental stress that transforms a waterbody from\none polluted condition to another that is still damaged, but less toxic. Liming causes a large change in acid-\nadapted ecosystems, which is followed by changes in species abundances as new communities develop.

Source: B. Freedman.\nReducing Emissions\nUltimately, the extensive damage caused by acidifying deposition from the atmosphere can only be resolved\nby reducing the emissions of acid-forming gases. Although this fact is intuitively clear, the issue of emissions\nreduction remains controversial for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Scientists do not know exactly how much the emissions of SO2and/or NOxmust be reduced to prevent\ndamage by acidifying deposition.\n\u2022 Various emission-reduction strategies are possible, and they vary in their economic consequences. Would\nit be more effective to target large point-sources of emissions, such as power plants and smelters, while\npaying less attention to smaller but numerous sources, such as automobiles and oil-burning home\nfurnaces? Or should both large and small sources be aggressively curtailed?\n\u2022 To be effective, emissions reductions must be coordinated among neighbouring countries. For example,\nChapter 19 ~ Acidification | 505 what would happen if the government of one country (perhaps with large emissions of SO2and NOx) does\nnot regard acidifying deposition to be a high-priority problem, but neighbouring countries do?\nNot surprisingly, industries and regions that are responsible for large emissions of acid-forming gases have\ntendedtoresisttheimpositionofsubstantiallegislatedreductionsoftheirreleases.Ingeneral,theyarguethat\nthescientificjustificationforthereductionsisnotyetconvincing,whilethecostsofcontrolsareknowntobe\nlarge and potentially disruptive of the economy.\nIn addition, how low should the rates of atmospheric deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds be, in\norder to avoid further acidification of sensitive surface waters or to allow their recovery? The critical rates of\ndeposition of acidifying compounds are influenced, in part, by the vulnerability of the receiving ecosystems \u2013\nareaswithshallow,nutrient-poorsoilcansustainmuchlowerinputsofacidifyingsubstancesthanareasrichin\ncalcium. Highly sensitive lakes in eastern Canada are considered to have critical-load thresholds of <20 meq/\nha\u2022y of sulphur and nitrogen deposition (Figure 19.6).\nFigure19.7.CriticalLoadsofSulphurandNitrogenandSensitivityofSurfaceWatersinEasternCanada.\nA critical load is the wet and dry deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds that can be tolerated\nwithoutcausingacidification.Thedataareinmeq/ha\u2022yr.Thevaluesinparenthesesareforsulphuronly\n(kg SO4/ha\u2022yr). Source: Environment Canada (2005).\nAlthough there are many uncertainties about the specific causes and magnitude of the damage caused by the\natmospheric deposition of acidifying substances, it is obvious that what goes up (emissions of acid-precursor\ngases) must eventually come down (as acidifying deposition). This common sense idea is supported by a great\n506 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification dealofscientificevidence.Thisknowledge,combinedwithpublicawarenessandconcernaboutacidificationin\nmanycountries,hasspurredpoliticianstobegintotakeeffectiveaction.Thisisresultinginreducedemissions\nof SO2and NOx, particularly in relatively wealthy countries in North America and Western Europe.\nIn 1992, the governments of Canada and the United States signed a binational treaty aimed at reducing\nacidifyingdepositioninbothcountries.Thisagreement,knownastheCanada\u2013U.S.AirQualityAgreement,calls\nfor large expenditures by industries and governments to substantially reduce the emissions of air pollutants,\nespeciallySO2.Thesecutbacksareontopofreductionsofemissionsthatbothcountrieshadalreadyachieved\nduringthe1980s.IntheUnitedStates,emissionsofSO2havedecreasedfrom23.1Mtin1980to16.9Mtin1995\nand to 6.0 Mt in 2011, while emissions of NOxincreased slightly from 20.7 Mt in 1980 to 21.8 Mt in 1995 and\nthen decreased to 13.6 Mt in 2011 (EPA, 2014; see also Table 16.2). For comparison, the Canadian emissions of\nSO2decreasedfrom4.7Mtin1980to2.5Mtin1995andto1.3Mtin2012,whileemissionsofNOxremainedabout\nthesameduring1980to1995at2.4\u20132.6Mt/y,andthendeclinedto1.9Mt/yin2012(EnvironmentCanada,2014).\nImage19.5.Thebuiltenvironmentmayalso bedamagedbyacidifying deposition fromtheatmosphere.\nFor example, structures made of limestone, marble, or sandstone become chemically destabilized and\nerodedbythedrydepositionofSO2andNOxandbyacidicprecipitation.Thesepollutantsareseriously\ndamagingmanyfamousartifactsofculturalheritage,suchasthisancientcitadelknownastheAcropolis\nin Athens, Greece.

Those costs may be paid either by purchasing emissions credits or by taking action to\nreducetheemissions,suchasinstallingSO2-removaltechnology,switchingtoalow-sulphurfuel,orinextreme\ncases, shutting down particularly dirty facilities.\nThe flexibility associated with these options is considered by many economists and politicians to have been\nanimportantbenefitofthesystemofemissionstrading.Nevertheless,theestablishmentofamarketplacethat\ncommodifies the release of SO2does liberate many companies from the expensive investments that would be\nrequired to achieve tangible reductions of their emissions. This fact has engendered controversy, as has the\npotential establishment of a global marketplace for tradable emissions of greenhouse gases under the Kyoto\nProtocol (Chapter 17).\nIn any event, are the cuts in emissions large enough to achieve their intended effect of preventing and\nrepairing the acidification of ecosystems? According to a science assessment carried out by Environment\nCanada,thereductionsofSO2emissionshaveresultedinlowerratesofacidifyingdepositioninCanada(based\nonacomparisonofdatafor1990\u20131994and1996\u20132000;EnvironmentCanada,2005).Nevertheless,anestimated\n21-75% of eastern Canada still receives amounts of acidifying deposition that exceed the critical loads (the\nsmallernumberscorrespondtoabest-casescenario,andthelargertoaworst-caseone).EnvironmentCanada\nalso suggests that, to protect ecosystems from further damage caused by acidifying deposition, a further 75%\nreductionofSO2emissionswillberequiredbyCanadaandtheUnitedStatesbeyondthoseagreedtounderthe\nexistingAirQualityAgreement.AsimilarconclusionwasreachedbytheU.S.EnvironmentalProtectionAgency\nin its own science assessment of the issue (2011).\nFurthermore, not much action has been taken to reduce the emissions of NOx, and this appears to be\nworking against the environmental benefits associated with increased control of SO2. It is crucial that future\nregulatory actions include reduced emissions of both SO2and NOxand that acid rain and its environmental\ndamage continues to be monitored.\nThe 1992 air-pollution treaty between Canada and the United States is a helpful accomplishment. Although\ntherehavebeenreductionsintheacidityofprecipitationandsurfacewatersinsomeareas,itappearsthatthe\nreductions of SO2emissions are not large enough to fully mitigate many of the damages caused by acidifying\ndeposition.Sofar,extremelylargeareasofterraincontinuetobeaffectedbyacidificationcausedbyAtmospheric\ndeposition.\nImproving trends in the chemistry of precipitation and streamwater at Hubbard Brook, NH, a monitoring\nlocation with outstanding longer-term data of this sort of data, are shown in Figure 19.7.

Explain the principle of conservation of electrochemical neutrality? How is it relevant to the chemistry of\nprecipitation and surface waters?\n2. What environmental influences cause soil to become acidic? How can this problem be mitigated?\n3. How does the acidification of freshwater habitat affect the aquatic biota, including phytoplankton,\nmacrophytes, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish, and birds?\n4. Define critical load, and explain factors that influence its value for particular kinds of terrain and surface\nwaters.\n510 | Chapter 19 ~ Acidification Questions for Discussion\n1. Compare the chemistry of rainwater and lakewater in a region that is vulnerable to acidification. What are\nthe reasons for the differences?\n2. How do wet and dry depositions of acidifying substances contribute to acidification? Why do their rates\nand relative importance differ between urban and rural areas?\n3. Are surface waters in the area where you live acidic or likely to become so? Explain your answer in terms of\nterrain factors that influence vulnerability to acidification.\n4. Explain why wealthy countries have been taking action to reduce their emissions of acid-precursor gases,\nbut rapidly growing economies such as China and India have not. What are likely consequences of these\npolicies?\nExploring Issues\n1. There are two broad options for dealing with acidifying deposition: (1) reduced emissions to prevent the\nproblem and (2) liming of water and soil to treat the symptoms. Some people have called emissions\nreductions the \u201cbillion dollar solution,\u201d and liming the \u201cmillion dollar solution.\u201d This is because of the\npotentially greater capital costs associated with technologies for reducing SO2and NOxemissions. Which\nof these options (or both) do you think is most appropriate for dealing with acidification as an\nenvironmental problem? Explain your answer.\n2. Canada and the United States have negotiated a treaty concerning the transboundary movements of air\npollutants, with a focus on acidifying deposition from the atmosphere. Major aspects of the treaty are\nreductions in the emissions of SO2, and to a lesser degree, NOxto the atmosphere. You are a scientist\nworking for Environment Canada and have been given the responsibility of monitoring whether the\nnegotiated emissions reductions have been successful in improving conditions in the province where you\nlive \u2013 is acidification becoming less of a problem? How would you design a program of environmental\nmonitoring and research to answer this important question? What ecological and human health questions\nwould you examine?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nAlvo,R.,D.J.J.Hussell, andM.Berrill.1988.Thebreedingsuccessofcommonloons(Gaviaimmer)inrelationto\nalkalinity and other lake characteristics in Ontario.

Compare the causes of eutrophication in fresh and marine waters.\n2. Explain the evidence that phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient for eutrophication of fresh waters.\n3.

Compare the effects of hydroelectric developments involving reservoirs and run-of-the-river facilities.\n6. Describe the environmental damage caused by dams and reservoirs.\nIntroduction\nAquatic ecosystems are affected by many environmental stressors, both natural and anthropogenic. All levels\nof the aquatic food web are affected, as are ecological processes such as productivity and nutrient cycling. In\nprevious chapters, we examined the use of aquatic resources (Chapter 14) and damage caused by pollution by\nmetalsandacidification(Chapters18and19).Here,welookattheeffectsofeutrophicationcausedbynutrient\nenrichment, and caused by hydroelectric developments. Effects on aquatic ecosystems of oil spills, pesticides,\nforestry, agricultural activities, and urbanization are examined in later chapters.\nEutrophication\nEutrophic waters are well supplied with nutrients, and as a result they are highly productive. In contrast,\noligotrophicwatersaremuchlessproductivebecauseofarestrictedavailabilityofnutrients.Mesotrophicwaters\nare intermediate between these two conditions.\nSome waterbodies occur in inherently fertile watersheds and are naturally eutrophic. So-called cultural\neutrophication,however,iscausedbyanthropogenicnutrientinputs,usuallybythedumpingofsewageorrunoff\nof fertilizer from agricultural land. Both inland and marine waters can become eutrophic through increases in\ntheir nutrient supply, although the problem is more common in fresh waters.\nThe most conspicuous symptom of eutrophication is a large increase in primary productivity, especially of\nphytoplankton,whichcandevelopextremelydensepopulationsknownasanalgalbloom.Shallowwaterbodies\nmay also experience a vigorous growth of aquatic plants (macrophytes). Because the increased productivity of\nalgae and macrophytes can allow higher trophic levels to be more productive, aquatic invertebrates, fish, and\nwaterfowl may also be abundant in eutrophic waterbodies.\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 515 However, extremely eutrophic (hypertrophic) waters may become severely degraded. These waterbodies\ndevelopnoxiousbloomsofcyanobacteria(blue-greenbacteria)andalgaeduringthesummer,whichmaycause\nan off-flavour in water used for drinking, and may also release toxic organic compounds. In addition,\ndecompositionofthealgalbiomassconsumesalargeamountofoxygen,whichcausesanoxicconditionsthatare\nextremely stressful and even lethal to aquatic animals.\nBecauseculturaleutrophicationdegradeswaterqualityandecologicalconditions,itisanimportantproblem\ninmanyareas.Severeeutrophicationmayimpairtheuseofawaterbodyasasourceofdrinkingwater,tosupport\na fishery, or for recreation, and it degrades the ecological qualities of natural waters.\nCauses of Eutrophication\nMostlakesinCanadaaregeologically\u201cyoung\u201dbecausetheyoccuronlandscapesthatwerereleasedfromglacial\nice only about 8-12-thousand years ago (depending on the region). Many lakes are relatively deep, having had\nlittle time to accumulate much sediment in their basins. They also tend to have low rates of nutrient input.\nOverthemillennia,however,oligotrophiclakesofthissortgraduallyincreaseinproductivityastheyaccumulate\nnutrients.Theyalsobecomeshallowerduetosedimentation,whichresultsinincreasedratesofnutrientcycling.\nThe slowly increasing productivity of many lakes over time is a natural expression of the eutrophication as a\nlonger-term process.\nSurfacewatersmayalsobenaturallyeutrophiciftheyoccurinawatershedwithfertilesoil.Thisisthecase\nofmanylakesandpondsintheprairieregion,wherethereisanabundanceofshallowwaterbodiesthatrecycle\ntheir nutrients quickly.\nAnthropogenic (cultural) eutrophication involves more rapid increases in aquatic productivity. This is most\noften caused by nutrient loading associated with sewage dumping or runoff contaminated by agricultural\nfertilizer.Whereverhumansliveindensepopulationsorengageinintensiveagriculture,therearelargeinputs\nofnutrientsintolakesandrivers.Incoastalareas,estuariesandshallownear-shoreareasmayalsobeaffected\nby anthropogenic nutrient inputs and eutrophication.\nA theory called the Principle of Limiting Factors states that certain ecological processes are controlled by\nwhichever environmental factor is present in the least supply relative to demand. According to this idea, the\nprimaryproductionofwaterbodiesislimitedbythenutrientthatispresentinleastsupplyrelativetoitsdemand\n(assuming that light, temperature, and oxygen supply are all adequate). Research has shown that, in almost all\nfresh waters, primary production is limited by the availability of phosphorus, occurring as the phosphate ion\n(PO43\u2013.Incontrast,marinewatersareusuallylimitedbytheavailabilityofinorganicnitrogen,particularlyinthe\nform of nitrate (NO3-).\nPhosphorus as the Limiting Nutrient\nDuringthe1960sandearly1970s,eutrophicationwasatopicofintenseenvironmentalcontroversy,partofwhich\nfocused on the question of which nutrients were the limiting factors to primary production in lakes. Many\nscientistsbelievedthatphosphoruswasmostimportantinthisregard.Others,however,suggestedthatdissolved\nnitrogen, in the form of nitrate or ammonium, was the critical limiting nutrient in many fresh waters. Plants\nandalgaehaverelativelylargedemandsforallofthosenutrients,whichtypicallyoccurinlowconcentrationsin\nwater.\n516 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters It was also suggested that dissolved inorganic carbon (as bicarbonate, HCO3\u2013) could be a limiting factor.\nInorganiccarbonisneededinlargeamountsbyautotrophs,butinaquaticsystemsHCO3\u2013isreplenishedmainly\nby the diffusion of atmospheric CO2into the surface water, which is a slow process.\nEventually, research convincingly demonstrated that phosphorus is the key nutrient that limits primary\nproductioninmostfreshwaters.Consequently,controllingtherateofphosphorussupplyisnowknowntobea\ncrucial action if eutrophication is to be avoided.\nThe vital role of phosphorus is suggested in Table 20.1, which shows its typical concentration in fresh water\n(anindexofsupply)anditsconcentrationinplants(anindexofdemand).Becausetheratioofdemandtosupply\nforphosphorusisconsiderablylargerthanforothernutrients,itisalikelycandidatetobetheprimarylimiting\nfactor for the productivity of algae and plants. The data also suggest that the next-most important nutrient is\ninorganic nitrogen, in the form of nitrate or ammonium.\nTable 20.1. Demand and Supply of Essential Nutrients in Water. These are indexed by the typical\nconcentrations in freshwater plants and in fresh water. Source: Data from Vallentyne (1974).\nOther studies confirm that phosphorus is the usual controlling nutrient for eutrophication. Perhaps the most\nconvincingdatacomefromafamousseriesofexperimentsconductedintheExperimentalLakesArea(ELA;see\nCanadianFocus20.1).MostoftheresearchattheELAinvolvedtheadditionofnutrientsatvariousratesandin\ndifferentcombinationstoselectedlakes,followedbymonitoringoftheecologicalresponses.Themostimportant\nwhole-lake experiments were the following (Schindler, 1978, 1990; Levine and Schindler, 1989):\n\u2022 For two years, Lake 304 was fertilized with phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon. It responded by becoming\neutrophic. After the addition of phosphorus was stopped, the lake returned to its original oligotrophic\ncondition, even though nitrogen and carbon were still being added.\n\u2022 The two basins of Lake 226, an hourglass-shaped lake, were isolated with a vinyl curtain. One basin was\nfertilized with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in a weight ratio of 10:5:1, while the other received only\ncarbon and nitrogen at 10:5. Only the basin receiving phosphorus developed algal blooms. After five years,\nthe nutrient additions were stopped, and the original oligotrophic condition returned within just one year.\nA similarly rapid recovery was observed in another experiment, involving Lake 303, after fertilization with P\nwas stopped.\n\u2022 Lake 302N was fertilized with phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon. However, the nutrients were injected\ndirectly into deep water during the summer, at a time when lakes develop a thermal stratification (see In\nDetail 20.1). Because the nutrients were injected deeply, primary production in the surface water was not\naffected and eutrophication did not occur. Research at the ELA also showed that when phosphorus was\nadded to lakes, the supply of nitrogen and carbon already present was capable of supporting phosphorus-\ninduced eutrophication. In part, this occurred because eutrophication induced an increased rate of fixation\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 517 of atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) by blue-green bacteria and a faster diffusion of atmospheric CO2into the\nlakewater.\nEutrophication also causes pronounced changes to occur in the species composition, relative abundance, and\nbiomass of phytoplankton, which are the most important primary producers in the ELA lakes. Changes in the\nphytoplanktonresultedineffectsonorganismsathigherlevelsofthefoodweb,suchaszooplanktonandfish.\nForexample,theproductivityofwhitefish(Coregonusclupeaformis)inhourglass-shapedLake226wasgreater\nintheeutrophiedbasinthanintheoligotrophicone.Thisoccurredinresponsetothegreaterabundanceoftheir\nprey of zooplankton and aquatic insects, which itself a trophic response to increased algae productivity.\nIn Detail 20.1. Lake Stratification\nDuringmostoftheyear,lakeshavearatheruniformdistributionoftemperaturethroughouttheirdepth.\nThisallowstheirbottomandsurfacewaterstomixeasilyundertheinfluenceofstrongwinds.Duringthe\nsummer,however,lakesoftendevelopapersistentstratifiedcondition.Thisischaracterizedbyasurface\nlayerofrelativelywarmwater,severalmetresthickinmostlakes(butthickerinsomelargelakes),lying\nabove deeper, cooler water. Because the density of warm water is less than that of cool water, the two\nlayers remain discrete and do not mix.\nThe relatively warm, upper water of a stratified lake is known as the epilimnion, while the cooler,\ndeeper water is the hypolimnion. These layers are separated by a narrow zone of rapid change, known\nasthethermocline.Duringtheautumn,astheepilimnioncools,thestratificationdiminishesandthetwo\nlayers become mixed by strong winds.\nDuring stratification, oxygen and other dissolved substances can enter the hypolimnion, but mainly\nbydiffusionacrossthethermocline.Becausediffusionisaslowprocess,hypolimneticoxygenbecomes\ndepleted in stratified lakes whose deeper water receives large inputs of organic material.

The Experimental Lakes Area\nSomeofthemostfamousCanadianresearchinecologyandenvironmentalsciencehasbeenconducted\nin the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA). Research at the ELA, funded mainly by the Federal Department\nof Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), began during the late 1960s.

Most of the experiments were also funded by DFO and conducted by its personnel or\nby university scientists working with them. However, during the early 1990s, DFO focused its activities\nmore so on marine issues, and for several years it looked as if cutbacks might result in the ELA facility\nclosingdown.Infact,despiteaninternationaloutcryfromaquaticscientistsandenvironmentalists,the\nELA was essentially closed for about a year.

About 84%\nof the phosphorus loading was associated with the dumping of municipal sewage, and the rest was due to\nagriculturalfertilizerandsewage(fromlivestock).Inaddition,thenitrogendischargeatthetimewasabout12.5\nkg/person\u2022year, of which 36% was from municipal and 64% from agricultural sources.\nBecause scientists have convincingly demonstrated that phosphorus is the primary limiting nutrient for\neutrophicationinfreshwater,controlstrategieshavefocusedonreducingtheinputofthatnutrienttosurface\nwaters.\nPhosphorus in Detergent\nOneofthefirsttargetswasdomesticdetergents.Duringthe1960sandearly1970s,detergentscontainedlarge\namountsofsodiumtripolyphosphate(STP),whichtypicallyaccountedfor50-65%oftheweightoftheproduct\n(12-16%asphosphorus).TheSTPwasaddedasaso-called\u201cbuilder\u201dtoreducetheactivityofcalciumandother\ncationsinthewashwater,therebyallowingthecleaningagentsinthedetergent(thesurfactants)toworkmore\nefficiently.Duringthe1960sandearly1970s,asmuchas3-millionkilogramsofhigh-phosphatedetergentswere\nusedinNorthAmericaeachyear,andvirtuallyallwaseventuallyflushedintosurfacewatersthroughthesewage\nsystem.Detergentuseaccountedforabouthalfofthephosphoruscontentofwastewaterdischargesduringthe\nearly 1970s.\nFortunately,thedomesticuseofdetergentisadiscreteactivity,andgoodsubstitutesareavailabletoreplace\nSTP in the builder function.

This practice is more common for cities and towns that are located beside an\nocean, because well-flushed marine environments have a huge capacity for diluting and biodegrading organic\npollutants.CitiesthatdumprawsewageintotheoceanincludeSaintJohnandSt.John\u2019sontheAtlanticcoast,\nand Victoria on the Pacific coast.

Even acidic lakes can become eutrophic if fertilized. Drain Lake near Halifax became\nextremely acidic (pH 4.0) after pyritic minerals in its watershed were exposed to the atmosphere by\nconstruction activity, which resulted in their oxidation and the production of sulphuric acid. However,\nthe lake also received inputs of sewage, which caused it to become eutrophic and to support a lush\nproductivity of aquatic plants, algae, zooplankton, insects, and waterfowl. The lake was too acidic,\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 521 however, to support fish (see also Chapter 19). Source: B. Freedman.\nCompared with many oceanic environments, inland waters such as lakes and rivers have a much smaller\ncapacityfordilutingandbiodegradingsewagewaste.Consequently,mostmunicipalitieslocatedbesideaninland\nwaterbody treat their sewage before discharging the effluent. Sewage treatment can, however, vary greatly in\ndegree and in the technology used, as we examine below (Freedman, 1995; Sierra Legal Defence, 2004, 2006).\n\u2022 Primary sewage treatment is relatively simple. It usually involves the screening of raw sewage to remove\nlarger materials, and then allowing the remainder to settle to reduce the amount of suspended organic\nmatter. The resulting effluent is then discharged into the environment, although it may first be treated with\na disinfectant (usually a chlorine compound) to kill pathogens, especially bacteria. Primary treatment\ntypically removes 40-60% of the suspended solids of raw sewage and 5-15% of the phosphorus, while\nreducing the biological oxygen demand (BOD) by 25-40%. (BOD is the capacity of the organic material in\nwastewater to consume oxygen during decomposition.) More advanced primary systems can reduce the\nsuspended solids by 90% and the BOD by 50%. In addition, they can reduce fecal coliforms by 45-55%.\n\u2022 Secondary sewage treatment may be applied to the effluent of primary treatment, mostly to further reduce\nthe BOD. Secondary treatment usually involves the use of a biological technology that enhances aerobic\ndecomposition of organic waste by stimulating the microbial community in an engineered environment.\nTwo such biotechnologies in common use are (1) activated sludge, which involves a vigorous aeration of\nsewage water to enhance the decomposition of its organic content, and (2) trickling filters, in which the\nwastewater passes slowly through a complex physical matrix that supports a large population of\nmicroorganisms. These biotechnologies, along with primary treatment, produce large quantities of a\nhumus-like product known as sludge, which can be composted and then spread onto agricultural land as an\norganic-rich conditioner. Sludge may also be less-usefully incinerated or dumped in a landfill (see Chapter\n18). Primary and secondary treatments together remove 30-50% of the phosphorus from sewage, and\n522 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters reduce the BOD and suspended solids by 85-90% and coliforms by 90-99%.\n\u2022 Tertiary sewage treatment includes processes to remove most of the remaining dissolved nutrients from\nthe effluent. Phosphorus removal may be achieved by adding aluminum, iron, calcium, or other chemicals\nthat develop insoluble precipitates with phosphate, which then settle out of the water, removing 90% or\nmore of the phosphorus. Other tertiary processes may be used to remove ammonium and nitrate.\n\u2022 Artificial wetlands are sometimes constructed to provide advanced treatment of sewage. The wetlands are\nengineered to develop a highly productive ecosystem, in which vigorous microbial activity decomposes\norganic waste while algae and macrophytes decrease nutrient concentrations in the water. Most sewage-\ntreatment wetlands are constructed outdoors, but some are developed inside of a greenhouse, which\nallows the system to work during the winter. The efficiency of these systems depends on climate, the rate\nof flow-through of the sewage, and the nature of the engineered wetland. Typically, artificial wetlands\nremove up to 30% of the phosphorus from raw sewage, while reducing BOD by as much as 90%.\nTertiary treatment to reduce phosphorus in municipal effluents requires expensive investments in technology\nand operating costs. Consequently, this practice is pursued only under certain conditions. Tertiary treatment\nis mostly used by communities located beside rivers and around the Great Lakes. Moreover, because the\nGreat Lakes are affected by effluents originating from sources in both Canada and the United States, bilateral\nagreementshavebeennegotiatedconcerningtheloadingofphosphorusandotherpollutants.Tomeetthetarget\nloadings, municipalities in both countries must use tertiary systems to achieve a high degree of phosphorus\nremoval from sewage.\nElsewhereinCanada,lessattentionisgenerallypaidtotheremovalofphosphorusfrommunicipaleffluents.\nAlthoughmunicipalitiesmaytreattheirsewage,onlyprimaryorsecondarysystemsaregenerallyused,mostly\nto reduce the abundance of pathogens and to lower BOD in the effluent (Chapter 25).\nAs previously noted, agricultural livestock produce enormous amounts of fecal materials.

These included aquatic worms known as\ntubificids (Limnodrilus spp.), insect larvae of the midge family (order Diptera, family Chironomidae), and small\nmolluscs (snails in the order Gastropoda and clams in the family Sphaeriidae). The worm-dominated benthos,\nhowever, is considered an indication of great degradation of ecological integrity compared with the mayfly-\ndominated community of well-oxygenated sediment.\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 525 Algal Blooms\nBecauseLakeEriehasagreatersupplyofnutrients,itsupportsamuchlargerbiomassofphytoplanktonthanthe\notherGreatLakes.Whenitseutrophicationwasmostsevere,itswesternbasinsupportedabouttwiceasmuch\nalgal biomass as Lake Ontario (per unit of surface area), and 11 times more than oligotrophic Lake Superior.\nThe communities of phytoplankton vary greatly among the sub-basins of Lake Erie and also between its\nnearshoreandoffshorewaters.Theeasternandcentralbasinsarerelativelydeepandunproductive,whilethe\nshallower western basin is more productive.

Therefore, smaller species of zooplankton were favoured and their abundance\nincreased.\n526 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters Changes in the Fishery\nLake Erie has long supported a large fishery, which typically exceeds the combined landings of all the other\nGreat Lakes. Remarkably, the total catch by the commercial fishery has been quite stable over the years.\nThis has occurred despite enormous changes in the species of fish present, fishing technology, intensity of\neutrophication,pollutionbytoxicchemicals,habitatdamagecausedbydammingriversrequiredforspawning,\nand sedimentation of shallow habitat by soil eroded from deforested parts of the watershed.\nAlthoughthecatchofthefisheryonLakeEriehasnotdeclined,thenatureofthefishcommunityhaschanged\ngreatly.Thesechangesillustrateaseveredegradationofthefisheryresourceandofthenaturalecosystem.When\nthecommercialfisheryonLakeEriebeganinthenineteenthcentury,theprimetargetswerethelargest,most\nvaluablespecies\u2013thesewerewhitefish(Coregonusclupeaformis),laketrout(Salvelinusnamaycush),andherring\n(Leucichthysartedi).Thisisacommonpatternwheneverapreviouslyunexploitedfisheryorforestresourceis\ninitially harvested \u2013 take the best and leave the rest (see Chapter 14).\nUnfortunately, populations of the most desirable species were rapidly depleted. This happened because the\nfishing pressure was excessive and could not be sustained. Also, severe habitat degradation occurred in the\nlake, caused mainly by erosion and siltation associated with extensive deforestation of its watershed. As the\nmost desirable species disappeared, the fishing industry switched to \u201csecond-choice\u201d species, such as blue\npike (Stizostedion vitreum glaucum), walleye (S. v. vitreum), sauger (S. canadense), and yellow perch (Perca\nflavescens).Becauseofover-exploitationandhabitatdegradation,thespeciesofStizostedionbecameextirpated\norrarebytheearly1970s.Thefisherywasthendominatedbysmaller,low-valuespeciessuchasyellowperch,\nandbyalienfishsuchasrainbowsmelt(Osmerusmordax),freshwaterdrum(Aplodinotusgrunniens),andcarp\n(Cyprinuscarpio).Therefore,althoughthetotalyieldoffishcaughthasremainedfairlylargeandconsistentover\ntime, the quality of the economic resource and the integrity of the fish community have been badly degraded.\nRecent Changes in Environmental Quality:For a number of reasons, ecological conditions have improved\nmarkedly in Lake Erie since the late 1970s. This has largely been achieved by the construction of sewage-\ntreatmentfacilitiesinlakesidecitiesandtownsinCanadaandtheUnitedStates(aswellasupstream,especially\nontheDetroitRiverandLakeSt.Clair).Manyofthesefacilitiesincludetechnologytoreducephosphorusinputs.\nThe annual loading of phosphorus to Lake Erie has been reduced from about 28-thousand tonnes in 1968, to\n20-thousandtin1974,and6-17-thousandtduring1981-2008(average9-thousandt;Richards,2012;Figure20.1).\nWhereasinthe1960smostofthephosphorusloadingwasfrompoint-sources(primarilydischargesofsewage\nfrom towns and cities), it is now mostly non-point discharges associated with agricultural runoff.\nThereductionofphosphorusinputhasalleviatedeutrophicationinLakeErie(MakarewiczandBertram,1991).\nThe average biomass of phytoplankton decreased from 3.4 g/m3in 1970 to 1.2 g/m3during 1983-1985. The\nlargest biomass still occurs in the western basin, where it averaged 1.9 g/m3during 1983-1987, compared with\n1.0 g/m3in the central basin and 0.6 g/m3in the deepest, eastern basin.

At the same time, diatoms indicative of mesotrophic or oligotrophic conditions\nhave become more abundant, notably Asterionella formosa and Rhizosolenia eriensis.

The zebra mussel invaded from west to east, and there was a lag in the\ndevelopment of its dense shoals along this gradient. Source: Modified from Edsall and Charlton (1997).\nThe animal communities have also changed since the 1970s. Species of zooplankton that indicate oligotrophic\nconditions have become more abundant, while indicators of eutrophication are fewer and mostly restricted\nto the western basin.

The decrease of planktivorous fishes has allowed secondary increases of larger-\nbodied zooplankton, such as the waterflea Daphnia pulicaria.\nThe zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is another cause of important ecological change. This bivalve\nmollusc, a native of Eurasia, was accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes by the discharge of ballast water\nfromtransoceanicships.Themusselcanrapidlyattainanextremelydensepopulation(upto50-thousand/m2)\non hard underwater surfaces such as rock, metal, and concrete. It is a filter-feeder, and its huge populations\nhave an enormous capability for removing algal cells from water.

However, the invasion of the Great Lakes by zebra mussels has also caused\nserious damage, including a reduction in filter-feeding zooplankton (with secondary effects on planktivorous\nfish), and the displacement of native molluscs that cannot compete with the dense shoals of this non-native\nmussel. Industries and water utilities have also suffered damage from the clogging of their water-intake pipes.\nOverview of the Lake Erie Case Study\nLakeErieisanimportantexampleofthecumulative,detrimentaleffectsofavarietyofanthropogenicstressors\n528 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters on the ecological health of a large lake.

About 64% of the large dams are primarily\nused for hydroelectricity, 11% for water supply, 9% to containing tailings from mines, 6% for municipal water\nsupply, 6% for irrigation, 2% for flood control, and 4% for other purposes, while 9% are multi-purpose\n(Environment Canada, 2010).\nThe construction of dams and impoundments always causes environmental damage and affects local people\nin various ways. For these reasons, these developments are always controversial at the local scale, and often\nat national and international levels as well. Such controversy has been sufficient to halt some proposals (often\nin concert with concerns about economic and energy-supply issues).

It has\ntransformed a significant part of the surface of the planet and is having gigantic economic and environmental\nimpacts.

As enormous as this\nprojectis,wecanexpectproposalsforothersofsimilarorlargermagnitudeiftheenergyandmaterialdemands\nof the burgeoning human economy are to be met.\nHydroelectric Developments\nHydroelectricity is produced by using the kinetic energy of flowing water to turn a turbine, which connects\nto a generator that produces electricity, which is distributed to consumers through a complex network of\ntransmission lines (see Chapter 13). The global use of hydroelectricity was 3,782 terawatt-hours of electricity\n(in 2013; this is equivalent to 856 x 106tonnes of oil equivalent; BP, 2015). About 56% of the global use of\nhydroelectricityoccursindevelopedcountries,and23%inNorthAmerica.Canadahasinvestedrelativelyheavily\ninthedevelopmentofhydroelectricresourcesandaccountsfor10%oftheglobaluseofthisenergysource(for\ncomparison, Canadaconstitutes0.5%oftheglobalpopulation).Hydroelectricityaccountsforabout6.7%ofall\ncommercial energy use, but 75% of the use of renewable sources (others include wind, solar, geothermal, and\nbiomass).\nThere are three basic ways to harness flows of surface water to generate hydroelectricity:\n1. Alargeimpoundmentcanaccumulateriverflowandfloodanextensiveareaofland.Thisstoreswaterfrom\nthespringhigh-flowperiodsothatelectricitycanbegeneratedaccordingtodemandthroughouttheyear.\nThis kind of facility has a large effect on the seasonal variation of below-dam riverflow, because it greatly\nreduces the spring peak flow while increasing the flow during the summer, fall, and winter (Figure 20.2).\nLarge impoundments are the most common type of major hydroelectric facility in Canada.\nFigure20.2.EffectsofReservoirDevelopmentonSeasonalFlowofthePeaceRiver.TheBennettDamand\nitsassociatedreservoirwerebuiltin1968,sotheuppercurves(for1915\u20131967)representpre-impoundment\nconditions.TheflowsweremeasuredatthetownofPeaceRiver,Alberta.Themostnotablechangesare(1)\nanoverallreductionintheannualvariationofriverflow;(2)alargereductioninpeakflowduringmid-April\ntomid-July;and(3)anincreaseduringthelow-flowperiodofSeptembertoMarch.Source:Modifiedfrom\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 531 Rosenberg et al.

Source: Modified from Rosenberg et al. (1997).\nEnvironmental Effects\nImportant environmental benefits are associated with the use of hydroelectricity:\n\u2022 Because the energy source (flowing water) is renewed through the hydrologic cycle, hydroelectricity is a\nrenewable source of power.\n\u2022 The emissions of greenhouse gases are much smaller than those associated with the use of fossil fuels to\ngenerate electricity.\n\u2022 Unlike fossil fuels, there are no direct emissions of SO2or NOx, which are important causes of acid rain.\n\u2022 In some regions, impoundments help control downstream flooding, which might otherwise cause\neconomic damage and risks to people living in flood plains (described later).\n\u2022 Substantial recreational or commercial fisheries may develop in reservoirs.\nHowever,toadegreetheseadvantagesarerathersimplistic,particularlybecauselargequantitiesoffossilfuels,\nmetals, and other non-renewable resources are used to construct hydroelectric facilities. Moreover, the dams\nand impoundments cause some important environmental damages (Dorcey et al., 1997; Rosenberg et al., 1997;\nInternational Rivers Network, 2005).\n\u2022 Flooding of Natural Habitat: Large reservoirs flood extensive areas of terrestrial and wetland habitat. This\ncauses ecological damage, including the displacement of plants and animals that had utilized the original\nhabitats. In some cases, uncommon or rare species may be affected, particularly if unusual habitats such as\nwaterfall spray zones or special wetlands are destroyed. Of course, even while flooding destroys terrestrial\nand wetland areas, it also develops new aquatic habitats, which provide opportunities for certain fish,\nwaterfowl, and other aquatic species. The productivity of algae, zooplankton, and fish is usually relatively\nhigh for several years after the creation of a new reservoir because of nutrients leached from flooded soil.\n\u2022 Methylmercury:Highconcentrationsofmethylmercurycommonlyoccurinfishinreservoirs.Thishappens\nbecause inorganic mercury that is naturally present in soil becomes methylated by bacteria under the\nanoxic conditions that develop in sediment after flooding. As we learned in Chapter 18, methylmercury\nis readily bioaccumulated by organisms and then magnifies up the food web to occur in particularly high\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 533 concentrationsintoppredators.Italsotendstooccurinhigherconcentrationsinolderindividualswithin\nafishpopulation.Mercuryconcentrationsinthefleshofpredatoryfishinreservoirsareoftenhigherthan\n1.0 ppm and can reach 3 ppm, which significantly exceeds the 0.5 ppm limit for fish intended for human\nconsumption.Fishwithhighconcentrationsofmethylmercuryarealsoatoxichazardtonaturalpredators\nsuchasosprey(Pandionhaliaetus),baldeagle(Haliaeetusleucocephalus),andriverotter(Lutracanadensis).\nIntheborealregionofCanada,theconcentrationofmercuryinfishincreasesaftertheinitialdevelopment\nof a reservoir and persists for 10-30 years or longer (Figure 20.5).

The reservoir was first filled in 1979. Source: Data from Schetagne et al. (2002).\n\u25e6 Altered Flows and Obstructions: Many downstream effects result from the construction of dams,\nother flow-control structures, and diversions of rivers to increase the flow into reservoirs. Changes\nin the timing and amounts of flow affect the sedimentation regime: decreased flow results in silt\ndeposition and the infilling of gravel beds used by spawning fish, while scouring by increased flow\ncauses other kinds of habitat damage. Large changes in the flow also affect the productivity of algae\nand macrophytes, in part by affecting the flux of nutrients. These effects can be particularly acute\nin riverine marshes, deltas, and estuarine habitat. The resulting changes in productivity and other\n534 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters habitat characteristics may secondarily affect aquatic invertebrates, fish, migratory birds, and aquatic\nmammals.Inonerarecasein1984,atorrentialflowontheCaniapiscauRiverinnorthernQuebec,partly\ncaused by the release of water from an overly full reservoir (due to a week of unusually heavy rain),\ndrowned about 10-thousand migrating caribou (Rangifer tarandus).\nImage20.3.TwoviewsofChurchillFalls,Labrador:(left)the75mtallfallspriortothecompletion\nofthe5429MWgeneratingstationin1974;and(right)thegreatlyreducedflowin1988duetothe\ndiversion of riverflow to generate electricity.

Freedman.\n\u2022 Emissions of Greenhouse Gases: The development of a large reservoir results in conditions suitable for\nthe emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere (see Chapter 17). The\nproductionofmethane,whichisabout28timesmorepotentasagreenhousegasthancarbondioxide,may\noccur if flooding results in anaerobic conditions through the decomposition of large amounts of biomass\n\u2013 the dead trees and litter of drowned forests and the organic matter of inundated wetlands, especially\npeatybogsandfens.Suchoxygen-poorconditionsfavourtheproductionofmethaneduringdecomposition,\nwhichout-gassesintotheatmosphere.Theemissionofgreenhousegasesisgreatestduringthefirstseveral\ndecades after flooding and then slows to arate similar to thatof natural lakes.

Undoubtedly, numerous undocumented losses of rare species and\ntheir habitat occurred during the construction of hydroelectric developments in Canada and elsewhere\n536 | Chapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters prior to the early 1970s, when biodiversity surveys became a routine component of environmental impact\nassessments for these projects.\n\u2022 EffectsonLocalPeople:Thelifestyleoflocalpeoplecanbegreatlyaffectedbyahydroelectricdevelopment.\nThis is particularly true if a large reservoir is developed in a heavily populated area, which is often the\ncase in less-developed countries. For example, in China alone, the Three Gorges Dam displaced about\n1.3-millionpeople;theDanjiangkouDam(completedin1974)displaced383-thousandpeople;theSanmenxia\n(1960),319-thousand;theXinjiang(1961),306-thousand;andinIndia,theDongpinghuDam(1958)displaced\n278-thousand people (Goodland, 1994). In such crowded countries, suitable land for relocation of these\ndisplacedpeopleisoftenunavailable.PeoplearealsodisplacedbyreservoirsinnorthernCanada,although\ntypically several hundred or fewer. Almost all of the displaced people are Aboriginal, who may have to\nbe relocated from traditionally used areas if their villages become flooded. They are also deprived of\nopportunities to hunt mammals and birds in part of their traditional foraging area, and they may not be\nable to eatfish from the reservoir or downstreamfor several decades after its creation (because ofhealth\nhazards associated with methylmercury). Of course, local economic opportunities exist for some of these\npeople,suchasjobsassociatedwiththeconstructionandmaintenanceofthehydrofacilityanditsrelated\ninfrastructure of transmission lines and roads. However, entry into wage employment can be extremely\ndisruptivetotraditionalsubsistencelifestyles,forbothindividualsandthecommunity.Therearealsomany\nsocial and economic disruptions caused by the influx of people from elsewhere in Canada and from the\nconstruction of new roads and towns. For these and other reasons, local people often bitterly resist the\ndevelopmentoflargehydroelectricfacilities(andotherlargeindustrialprojects)intheareaswheretheylive.\nCanadian Focus 20.2. Hydro Development in Labrador\nHydroelectric power is an economically attractive and renewable source of energy. In the past, areas\nwith a high potential for hydroelectricity were often developed without much consultation with local\npeople,whoalsomaynothavereceivedmanyeconomicbenefitsfromtheproject.Localpeoplegenerally\ndid,however,bearthebruntoftheenvironmentaldamage,whichtypicallyincludedextensiveflooding,\nchanges in the hydrology of rivers used for transportation or for fishing, and sometimes harmful\ninfluences on traditional lifestyles and culture.\nOneexampleofinsensitivehydrodevelopmentwastheChurchillFallsProjectinLabrador,forwhich\nconstruction began in 1967. In 1969, the government of Newfoundland entered into a contract with\nHydro-Qu\u00e9bec (a Crown Corporation of Qu\u00e9bec) to supply power for 65 years, but at a price that\n(incredibly,inretrospect)tooknoaccountofmonetaryinflationorthefuturevalueofhydroelectricity.In\n1971,floodingoftheSmallwoodReservoirbegan,anditeventuallycoveredanimmense6,700km2.In1974,\nageneratingstationwithacapacityof5429MWwascompletedandelectricitybegantoflowtomarkets\nin Qu\u00e9bec and the northeastern United States.\nItisastonishingbythestandardsoftoday,buttheChurchillFallsProjectwasdevelopedwithonlyafew\nstudies of its potential environmental impacts. For instance, there was little understanding of how the\nlocalandregionalecologymightbeaffectedbytheenormouschangesinthehydrologyoftheChurchill\nRiver,oneofthegreatwatercoursesofeasternCanada.Inevitably,thehugereservoircausedextensive\ndamage through flooding, other habitat changes, and the mobilization of bioavailable methylmercury.\nIt is also remarkable that this immense industrial development occurred without much consultation\nwith the local people, particularly those of the Innu culture, who are the original inhabitants of that\nregionofLabrador.ThelocalInnuhadlongengagedinsubsistencehuntingandcommercialtrappingin\ntheprojectregion,undertakingseasonalmovementstotraditionalareaswheretheyobtainedwildmeat\nas food and furs to sell. Most of these people were completely unaware of the proposed hydroelectric\nChapter 20 ~ Additional Problems of Surface Waters | 537 development or its likely consequences for their traditional activities. Some of them lost their canoes,\ncabins, and other possessions to flooding, for which they were not compensated. Many archaeological\nsites, such as burying grounds, were also lost.\nIn 1975, planning and construction began for a subsequent hydroelectric development, this time to\nharness the lower Churchill River by building a dam and power plant at Gull Island, about 200 km\ndownriver of Churchill Falls. Although the project was not completed at the time, the development\npotential remained attractive in terms of industrial and economic considerations. In 1990, and several\ntimes since, new proposals were brought forward to develop the hydroelectric potential of the lower\nChurchillRiver,andasof2015(whenthiscasestudywaswritten),itlookedcertainthattheprojectwould\nproceed.AlthoughtheseplanshavegenerallybeensupportedbybusinessinterestsinnearbyGooseBay,\nmanyoftheInnuhavebeenopposedtotheproposednewhydroproject.Theirgoverningorganization,\nknownasInnuNation,hasdemandedthefollowingfeaturesinanydevelopmentagreementtheywould\nconsider signing:\n\u2022 compensation for damage suffered by Innu during the initial development at Churchill Falls\n\u2022 a full assessment of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of the proposed new\ndevelopment\n\u2022 royaltiesandothercompensation,suchasspecifiedjobandcontractopportunities,forInnupersons\nand companies during the new development\n\u2022 the settlement of a comprehensive land claim, in view of the assertion of the Innu Nation of\nAboriginal title for almost all of that region of Labrador\nToreinforcetheirposition,theInnuhaveatvarioustimesheldpublicprotestsintheprojectareaandon\nNewfoundland.Theyhavealsopetitionedtheircasetoenvironmentalorganizations,powercompanies,\nand state governments in the northeastern United States, where much of the power would likely be\nsold. A particularly high-profile demonstration was held to confront a press conference staged by the\ngovernments of Qu\u00e9bec and Newfoundland in March of 1998, near the village of Churchill Falls, where\ntheirpremiersjointlyannouncedanewplanforahydrodevelopmentontheLowerChurchillRiver.This\nprotest by the Innu garnered front-page attention throughout Canada and internationally. The project\nenvisionedatthattimewouldhavecostabout$10billion.Itwouldhaveconstructedanewreservoir,dam,\nandgeneratingfacilityof2,264MWatGullIsland,whilealsoincreasingthecapacityoftheexistingUpper\nChurchill Falls station by 1000 MW.\nSincethen, thegovernmentofNewfoundland &LabradorhaseneteredintoanagreementwithNova\nScotia to develop a hydro facility on the Lower Churchill River and a transmission corridor through to\nNewEngland.However,atthetimeofwriting(2015),fullconsensushadnotyetbeenobtainedfromthe\nInnupeople,andalandsettlementhadnotbeenachieved.However,manydetailedorenvironmentaland\nsocio-economic impact assessments had been completed. Although this hydroelectric development in\nLabrador remains contentious, its construction is likely to begin in the summer of 2015.\nA Case Study: La Grande Complex\nThe La Grande Complex in Qu\u00e9bec was developed between 1973 and 1996 (Messier, 1998). The development is\ncentredontheLaGrandeRiver,buttheriver\u2019snaturalflowhasbeenaugmentedbydiversionsoftheCaniapiscau\nRiver (48% of its flow) and the linked Eastmain and Opinaca Rivers (90% of their flow).

During the\nplanning,construction,andoperatingphasesofthedevelopment,Hydro-Qu\u00e9becundertookextensivestudiesof\nhydrology, climate, ecology, socio-economics, and other issues related to potential environmental impacts.\nFor several years after the new impoundments were flooded, there was a relatively high productivity of\nphytoplankton and zooplankton. This occurred because of the high concentrations of nutrients, especially\nphosphorus, that were leached from flooded soil.

Three famous episodes of recent catastrophic flooding in Canada occurred in the Saguenay\nregion of Quebec, in southeastern Manitoba, and in southern Alberta.\nThe Saguenay disaster, in 1996, was caused by an intense July rainstorm that delivered 15.5 cm of\nprecipitationduringa50-hourperiod.Theresultingfloodingcausedthedeathsof10peopleandforced\nabout 16-thousand others from their homes.

Why do large hydroelectric proposals always engender such intense local controversy?\nExploring Issues\n1. A proposal is being made to develop a hydroelectric facility on a large river. There are two development\noptions: (a) a run-of-the-river facility, and (b) a larger dam that would develop an extensive reservoir.\nOption (b) would generate considerably more electricity. You are an environmental scientist and have been\nasked to compare the potential environmental impacts of the two proposals. What major topics would you\nexamine in your impact assessment? What do you think the likely results would be (in terms of the relative\nimpacts of the two development options)?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nBritishPetroleum(BP).2015.StatisticalReviewofWorldEnergy2014.BP,London,UK.https://web.archive.org/\nweb/20140620032118/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-\nreview-of-world-energy.htmlViewed January, 2014.\nChina Three Gorges Project. 2011.

About 42% of the\nproduction is conventional crude oil, and the other 58% is synthetic petroleum manufactured from oil-sand\nbitumen. About 76% of the Canadian production occurs in Alberta, 15% in Saskatchewan, and 7% offshore of\nNewfoundland.\nMostoftheproductionoccursinremoteareas,whilemostconsumptionisindenselypopulatedareasofthe\ncountry.

Petroleum is a fossil fuel, as are coal, oil-sand (or\nbitumen-sand),andnaturalgas.Fossilfuelsarederivedfromancientplantbiomassthatbecameburiedindeep\nsedimentary formations. Over geologically long periods of time, the biomass was subjected to high pressure,\nhightemperature,andanoxia.Theresultingchemicalreactionseventuallyproducedarichmixtureofgaseous,\nliquid,andsolidcompounds.Naturallyoccurringhydrocarbonsrangeincomplexityfromgaseousmethane,with\na weight of only 16 g/mole, to solid substances in coal with molecular weights exceeding 20,000 g/mole. (In\nchemistry,amoleisastandardquantityofasubstance,equivalenttotheamountcontainedin6.02\u00d71023atoms\nor molecules.)\nHydrocarbons can be classified into the following three groups:\n\u2022 Aliphatic hydrocarbons are compounds in which the carbon atoms are organized in a simple chain.\nSaturated aliphatics (also called paraffins or alkanes) have a single bond between adjacent carbon atoms,\nwhile unsaturated molecules have one or more double or triple bonds. This is illustrated by the two-carbon\naliphatic hydrocarbons ethane (H3C\u2500CH3), ethylene (H2C\u2550CH2), and acetylene (HC\u2261CH). Unsaturated\naliphatics are relatively unstable and do not occur naturally in petroleum. Rather, they are produced during\nindustrial refining, and photochemically in the environment after crude oil is spilled.\n\u2022 Alicyclic hydrocarbons have some or all of their carbon atoms arranged in a ring structure, which may be\nsaturated or unsaturated. Cyclopropane (C3H6) is the simplest alicyclcic hydrocarbon.\n\u2022 Aromatic hydrocarbons contain one or more five- or six-carbon rings in their molecular structure. Benzene\n(C6H6) is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbons.\nCrude petroleums vary greatly in their specific mixtures of hydrocarbons and other chemicals. They typically\nconsistofabout98%liquidhydrocarbons,1-2%sulphur(orless),and<1%nitrogen,plusvanadiumandnickelup\nto0.15%.Whenpetroleumisprocessedinanindustrialrefinery,varioushydrocarbonfractionsareseparatedby\ndistillationatdifferenttemperatures.Thisisdonetoproducesuchproductsasgasoline,kerosene,heatingoil,\njetfuel,lubricatingoils,waxes,andresidualfueloil(alsoknownasbunkerfuel).Inaddition,aprocessknownas\ncatalyticcrackingconvertssomeoftheheavierfractionsintolighter,morevaluablehydrocarbonssuchasthose\nin gasoline.\nOil Spills\nOilpollutioniscausedbyanyspillageofpetroleumoritsrefinedproducts.Thelargestspillstypicallyinvolvea\ndischarge of petroleum or bunker fuel to the ocean from a disabled tanker or a drilling platform, to an inland\nwaterway from a barge or ship, or to land or fresh water from a well blowout or broken pipeline. In addition,\nsome enormous oil spills have resulted from deliberate acts of warfare.\n548 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills Terrestrial Spills\nOil spills onto land are relatively common. Between 1989 and 1995, about 3,500 spills per year were reported\ninCanada\u2013mostallwererelativelysmall,althoughbylawtheymustbereported(EnvironmentCanada,1998).\nAbout42%ofthespillsoccurredinthevicinityofproductionwells,while29%werefrompipelines,and16%from\ntankertrucks.Duringthatperiod,upto140-thousandtofoilwasspilledperyearinpetroleum-producingareas,\nduetoaccidentallossesandwellblowouts.Inanotherstudyoftheperiod2000to2011,atotalof1,047spillswere\nreported from oil or gas pipelines in Canada (Kheraj, 2013).\nMost large terrestrial spills involve a ruptured pipeline. Canada has about 36-thousand km of pipeline for\ntransporting petroleum and refined liquids and 255-thousand km for natural gas (CAPP, 2014; for comparison,\nthere are about 1.0-million kilometers of roads, of which 416-thousand are paved; Transport Canada, 2014).\nPipelinebreaksmaybecausedbyfaultywelding,corrosion,orpumpmalfunctions,aswellasbyerosionslumps\nearthquakes,andevenarmedvandalsengagedintargetpractice.Operatornegligencemayalsobeanissue,as\nwas the case of the Lake M\u00e9gantic disaster in 2013 (Canadian Focus 21.1).\nTheextensiveCanadiannetworkofpipelinesincorporatesspillsensorsandotheradvancedtechnologiesthat\nallow damaged sections to be rapidly shut down. When this system works well, it allows individual accidents\ntobekeptrelativelysmall.Someothercountriesusefewerofthesetechnologies,andconsequentlymaysuffer\nhuge petroleum spills from overland pipelines. For example, in northern Russia, some pipelines have become\ncorroded, and insufficient countermeasures are in place to prevent or contain oil spills.\nIngeneral,oilspilledonlandaffectsrelativelylocalizedareasofterrainbecausemostsoilsabsorbpetroleum\nwell.However,muchlargerareasofaquatichabitatareaffectedifspilledoilreachesawatercourse,becausewind\nand currents cause slicks to spread and disperse widely.\nCanadianFocus21.1.OfftheRailsatLakeM\u00e9gantic.LateonenightinJune,2013,atraincarryinga72-car\nload ofpetroleum to arefineryin SaintJohn, NBderailedin the town ofLac-M\u00e9gantic, QC (Wikipedia,\n2015).Thetrainhadactuallypassedthroughthetownsomehourspreviously,buthadbeenparked11km\nfurther along for the night, but its conductor (the sole operator of the train), prior to going to a local\nhoteltosleep,didnotsetenoughmanualbrakestokeepthetraininplace.Whenthebrakesfailed,the\nunattended train rolled backward, reaching a speed as fast as 100 km/hour, and eventually derailed in\nthe downtown core of Lac-M\u00e9gantic.\nBecause the cargo of light petroleum was so inflammable, 63 of the 72 tank cars caught fire and\nexplodedasimmensefireballsthatdestroyed30buildings,someofthemhistoric,andcausedthedeaths\nof 47 people, most of whom were late-night patrons of a popular nightclub.

There\nare no good excuses for either of those reasons for tragic and dangerous outcomes when it comes to\ntransporting dangerous materials.\nChapter 21 ~ Oil Spills | 549 Marine Spills\nPetroleumspillsintotheworld\u2019soceanscurrentlyamounttoabout1.4-milliontonnes/year(Figure21.1).Thisis\nconsiderablylessthanthespillagethatoccurredinthe1970sandearly1980s,whichwas3-6milliontonnes/year\n(Koons, 1984). In addition to petroleum spills, there is a large natural emission to the oceans of hydrocarbons\nnot derived from petroleum. These chemicals are synthesized and released by phytoplankton, at an estimated\n26-million tonnes/year. These huge biological releases contribute to the background concentration of\nhydrocarbons of about 1 ppb (1 \u00b5g/L) in seawater. The biogenic emissions are a natural contamination and do\nnotresultinknownbiologicaldamage.Therearealsonaturalemissionsfromunderwaterseeps,whichamount\nto about 0.6-million tonnes/year and may sometimes cause local ecological damage.\nFigure21.1.PetroleumInputstotheOceans.Thedataarein103tonnesperyearovertheperiod1988to\n2007.

Source: B. Freedman.\nOil Spills through Warfare\nHuge amounts of petroleum and refined products have been spilled during warfare. During the Second World\nWar, German submarines sank 42 tankers off eastern North America, resulting in the spillage of about\n417-thousandtonnesofoilandfuels.DuringtheIran-IraqWar(1981-1987)therewere314attacksonoiltankers,\n70%ofthembyIraqiforces.Thatwar\u2019slargestspilloccurredin1983,whenIraqdamagedfivetankersandthree\nproduction wells at the Iranian Nowruz offshore facility, spilling more than 260-thousand t of petroleum into\ntheGulfofArabia.Theworld\u2019slargest-evermarinespilloccurredduringthebriefGulfWarof1991.Iraqiforces\ndeliberately released huge quantities of petroleum (about 0.8-million tonnes) into the Gulf of Arabia from a\nKuwaiti coastal loading facility. In part, this spill was a tactic of warfare \u2013 an attempt to make it difficult for\nAllied forces to execute an amphibious landing during the liberation of Kuwait. Mostly, however, the spill was\nan act of economic and ecological terrorism. The Iraqis also caused an enormous spillage on land during that\nwar by igniting the more than 700 production wells in Kuwait. An estimated 2-6 million tonnes of petroleum\n552 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills per day were emitted from the burning wells.

Depending on their chemical and physical characteristics, various hydrocarbon fractions will\nselectively evaporate, spread over the surface, dissolve into water, accumulate as persistent residues, or be\ndegraded by microorganisms and solar ultraviolet radiation:\nFigure 21.2. Fate of Spilled Petroleum on Water. Source: Modified from Clark and MacLeod (1977).\n\u2022 Evaporationof vapours is important in reducing the amount of spillage remaining in the aquatic or\nterrestrial environment. Evaporation typically dissipates almost 100% of gasoline spilled at sea, 30-50% of\ncrude oil, and 10% of bunker fuel. In other words, the relatively light, volatile hydrocarbon fractions are\nselectively evaporated, leaving heavier residues behind. Rates of evaporation are increased by warm\ntemperatures and vigorous winds.\n\u2022 Spreadingrefers to the movement of an oil slick over the surface of water or land. Spreading can occur\nover extremely large areas on water, but it is much more restricted on land because of the high absorptive\ncapacity of soil. The degree of spreading on water is influenced by the viscosity of the spilled material and\nby environmental factors such as windspeed, water turbulence and currents, and the presence of surface\nice. One experimental spillage of 1 m3of petroleum onto calm seawater created a slick 0.1 mm thick, with a\ndiameter of 100 m, after 100 minutes. A petroleum slick only 0.3 \u00b5m thick or less is visible as a glossy sheen\non calm water. In addition, a slick on water is moved about by currents and wind and may eventually wash\nonto a shore.\n\u2022 Dissolutioncauses pollution of the water beneath an oil slick. Lighter hydrocarbons are more soluble in\nwater than heavier ones, while aromatics are much more soluble than alkanes (Table 21.2). After a spill of\npetroleum at sea, the hydrocarbon concentration in water a few metres beneath the slick may be 4-5 ppm\n(g/m3), thousands of times greater than the 1 ppb (mg/m3) that normally occurs in ambient seawater.\nChapter 21 ~ Oil Spills | 553 Table21.2.SolubilityofAlkaneandAromaticHydrocarbons.Solubilityisreporteding/m3(ppm)infresh\nwater. Within the aromatics, aqueous solubility decreases with increasing molecular size and with the\nnumber of aromatic rings.\n\u2022 Residual materialsremain after the lighter fractions of spilled petroleum have evaporated or dissolved. At\nsea, residual materials typically form a gelatinous, water-in-oil emulsion known as \u201cmousse\u201d because of its\nvague resemblance to the whipped chocolate dessert. Oil spilled offshore usually washes onto shorelines as\nmousse, which may then weather to form a long-lasting tarry residue on rocks. Alternatively, mousse may\neventually combine with particles of sediment on the beach to form sticky, tar-like patties that\nsubsequently become buried or may be washed back to sea during a storm. Mousse that does not wash\nashore eventually weathers into semisolid, floating asphaltic residues known as \u201ctar balls\u201d.\n\u2022 Degradationrefers to the slow decomposition of spilled materials by microorganisms and by photo-\noxidation by solar ultraviolet radiation. Many species of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms can\nutilize hydrocarbons as an energy source. The rate of biodegradation varies greatly, however, depending on\nambient temperature, the concentration of oxygen, and the availability of key nutrients such as nitrogen\nand phosphorus. In general, lighter hydrocarbons are relatively easily decomposed by biological and\ninorganic oxidations, while heavier fractions resist degradation and can be quite persistent in the\nenvironment.\nToxicity\nAcute toxicity caused by petroleum, refined products, or pure hydrocarbons is typically associated with the\ningestion of the materials, followed by the destruction of cellular membranes, which results in the death of\ntissues. The toxic effects are influenced by several factors:\n\u2022 the chemical composition of the spilled material, including its component hydrocarbons\n\u2022 the intensity of exposure, or the amount or concentration of specific hydrocarbons or type of petroleum\n\u2022 the frequency of exposure events, such as whether the pollution is a single event, chronic (continuous), or\nfrequent (a series of episodes)\n554 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills \u2022 the timing of the exposure, especially whether it occurs during a critical time for a species or ecosystem\n\u2022 the condition of the spilled material, including thickness of a slick, nature of the emulsion, degree of\nweathering, and persistence of residues\n\u2022 environmental influences on exposure and toxicity, including weather conditions, oxygen status, and the\npresence of other pollutants\n\u2022 toxicity associated with chemical dispersants or detergents that are used during a cleanup\n\u2022 the sensitivity of particular species in an affected ecosystem to suffering toxic effects of hydrocarbons\nItisimportanttorecognizethatseveredamagemaybecausedbymethodsusedduringacleanup,suchasthe\nuseofdispersantsandemulsifiers,hot-waterwashing,theremovalofoiledsubstrates,burning,andthetilling\nofoiledsoiltoimproveaerationanddecomposition.Ecologicaleffectsarealsoinfluencedbydamagecausedto\nkeystone species in the food web, which has disproportionate effects on the community.\nEffects on Birds\nSeabirdsareextremelyvulnerabletooilspills.Theseincludecormorants,seaducks(eiders,mergansers,scaup,\nscoters), alcids (auklets, murres, puffins, razorbills), and penguins.

We will examine spills from wrecked supertankers and\noffshore drilling platforms, chronic emissions near petroleum refineries, and oiling of terrestrial vegetation.\nChapter 21 ~ Oil Spills | 555 Oil Spills from Wrecked Tankers\nThe Torrey Canyonwreck in 1967 was the first oil spill involving a supertanker. The ship was bound for a\nrefinery in Wales with 117-thousand tonnes of crude oil when it ran aground, spilling its entire cargo and\npolluting hundreds of kilometres of coast. Seabirds were among the most tragic victims of this spill, with at\nleast30-thousandkilled.Althoughalmost8-thousandoiledbirdswerecapturedandcleaned,therehabilitation\nmethodsofthetimewerenotverysuccessful andonlyafewofthebirdssurvivedlongenoughtobereleased\n(see In Detail 21.1).\nImmediately after the wreck occurred, an intensive cleanup of oiled beaches began. This effort used large\namountsofdetergentanddispersanttocreateoil-in-wateremulsionsonpollutedshorelines,whichwerethen\nrinsed to shore waters using pressurized water streams from hoses. Unfortunately, the chemicals used as\nemulsifiers were extremely toxic and their enthusiastic use greatly increased the damage already caused by\npetroleum to the flora and fauna of coastal habitats.\nHowever, emulsifiers were not used during the cleanup of rocky beaches.

Oiled habitat in the rocky intertidal zone was initially colonized by the opportunistic\ngreen alga Enteromorpha. As invertebrate herbivores recovered, this alga was grazed and replaced by species\nof perennial seaweeds, which are the typical algae of rocky intertidal habitats.

Cleaning Oiled Birds Birds become fouled if they swim or dive in water polluted by oil.\nBecause of the great empathy that people have for these victims of pollution, intense efforts are often\nmade to rehabilitate oiled birds by cleaning them of residues and treating their poisoning (Clark, 1984;\nHolmes, 1984; Harvey-Clark, 1990).\nThefirstsignificantefforttodothiswasaftertheTorreyCanyonspillof1967,whenabout8-thousand\noiled birds, mostly murres (Uria aalge) and razorbills (Alca torda), were captured and treated.\nUnfortunately, the methods available at that time for rehabilitating oiled birds were not particularly\neffectiveandonly6%ofthetreatedanimalssurvivedformorethanonemonth.Similarly,morethan1,600\noiled birds were cleaned after the Santa Barbara spill in 1969, mostly western grebes (Aechmophorus\noccidentalis) and loons (Gavia immer), but only 15% survived.\nThese early rehabilitation efforts were not successful because biologists did not yet understand that\nremoving oily residues from birds is not all that is needed \u2013 their physiological stress (including\npoisoning) must also be addressed. Biologists determined several reasons for the deaths of oiled birds:\n\u2022 Because oiled birds were not captured and treated soon enough, they became hypothermic\n556 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills (excessively cooled)\n\u2022 Birds were ingesting residues while trying to clean themselves, and that toxicity had to be mitigated\n\u2022 Themethodsforremovingoilyresiduesinvolvedtheuseofharshsolventsandemulsifiersthatwere\nthemselves toxic, caused damage to feather structure, or did not clean the feathers sufficiently\n\u2022 Mostoiledbirdsarehypoglycemictosomedegree,aconditioninvolvinglowbloodsugarandweight\nloss and requiring rapid treatment with an intravenous glucose solution\n\u2022 Animportanteffectofhydrocarbonpoisoninginbirds,particularlybyaromatics,isdisruptionofthe\nabilitytoregulateconcentrationsofsodiumandpotassiuminbloodplasma,aconditionthatrequires\nan oral administration of an electrolyte solution\n\u2022 Aromatic hydrocarbons are toxic to red blood cells, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that needs\nseveral weeks of treatment by appropriate nutrition\nToday, better methods are available to capture, clean, and rehabilitate oiled birds. These improved\ntechniques have been developed through trial and error while treating accidentally oiled birds, and by\nresearchonexperimentalanimals.Becauseitisnowknownthatoiledbirdsmustbetreatedassoonas\npossible,spill-responseteamstrytocapturethemquickly.Inaddition,relativelygentlecleaningagents\nknown as polysorbates are used to de-oil birds, and electrolyte solutions and glucose are routinely\nadministered to treat dehydration and hypoglycemia.\nThemethodsofpost-cleaningrehabilitationandreleasehavealsoimproved.Typically,birdsarekept\nfor7to10daysaftercleaning.Theyarereleasedassoonasthewaterproofingoftheirfeathershasbeen\nrestored,theirsalt-excretingmetabolismhasrecovered,theiranemiaiscorrected,andtheyhavestarted\nto regain weight.\nAs a result of the improved methods, up to 75% of oiled birds may be released after timely cleaning\nand rehabilitation. However, the success rate varies greatly, depending on bird species, the type of oil,\nand other factors, especially how much time has passed between the oiling event and the capture and\ntreatment.\nNevertheless, despite the relatively effective cleaning methods of today, studies have shown that the\npost-releasesurvivalofbirdscanbepoor.Itappearsthatasfewas1%oftreatedandreleasedseabirds\nsurviveforevenoneyear(Sharp,1996).Withsuchpoorsurvival,itisquestionablewhetheranysubstantial\necological benefit is gained from cleaning programs. It is expensive to treat oiled birds, and many\nvolunteers are needed, including specialists such as veterinarians. It is, of course, enormously better\nto avoid oil spills altogether than to try to deal with the terrible damage caused to wild animals and\necosystems.\nThe Amoco Cadizsupertanker accident occurred in 1978, about a decade after the Torrey Canyon and in the\nsamegeneralarea,butclosertoFrance.ThewreckoftheAmocoCadizspilled233-thousandtofpetroleumand\nfouled about 360 km of shoreline, of which 140 km were heavily oiled. The cleanup of some beaches involved\ndigging up and removing oily sand and sediment. Detergent and low-toxicity dispersants were used only to\nremove fouling residues in harbours and to disperse floating slicks of mousse in offshore waters. Because\nemulsifierswereusedjudiciously,manyoftheecologicaldamagescausedbyoilpollutionandthecleanupwere\nmuch less severe than after the Torrey Canyon spill. Recovery from the Amoco Cadiz spill was substantially\ncomplete within several years. However, some effects on benthic invertebrates lasted for a decade, and there\nwas lingering damage to local colonies of alcid seabirds.\nThe Exxon Valdezsuffered an accidental grounding in 1989 in southern Alaska, and this caused the most\ndamaging tanker accident ever to occur in North American waters.

However, subsurface residues still existed in many places.\nInitially, severe damage was caused to the seaweed-dominated intertidal zone of affected coastlines.

Several\nmonths after the Nestucca incident, the much larger Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska greatly added to the\nanxietyinbothcountriesabouttherisksoflargeoilspillsfromthefleetofhugetankersthatwasferrying\nnorthernpetroleumtomarketsinthewesternUnitedStates.Partlybecauseofthisbinationalattention,\nmore stringent regulations were enacted in both Canada and the U.S. to try to prevent these kinds of\ncatastrophes.(BoththeNestuccaandExxonValdezspillswerecausedbyoperatornegligence,andthus\nwere preventable accidents.) In addition, more effective action plans were developed to enhance the\ncapabilities for oil-spill countermeasures and cleanups. Eventually, Environment Canada sued the U.S.\ncompany that was responsible for the Nestucca spill and collected CAN$4.4 million in damages.

This was a Mexican drilling platform\nbeing used for petroleum exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. The blowout remained uncontrolled for more\nthan nine months, resulting in a spillage estimated at 476-thousand tonnes of petroleum. About 50% of the\nspill is thought to have evaporated into the atmosphere, while 25% sank to the bottom, 12% was degraded\nphotochemically or by microorganisms, 6% was burned at sea or recovered near the spill site, and 7% fouled\nabout 600 km of shoreline in Mexico and Texas.\nThisenormousblowoutcausedgreateconomicdamage.Itfouledbeachesimportanttotourism,andaffected\nthe fishing industry by oiling boats and gear, preventing fishing near slicks, and tainting valuable fish and\ninvertebrates with foul-tasting hydrocarbons. Many birds, sea mammals, turtles, and other wildlife were oiled\nand died, although these and other ecological damages were not well documented.\nThe Santa Barbaraoffshore blowout occurred in 1969 off southern California. This spill involved about\n10-thousand t of petroleum and fouled 230 km of coastline. Birds were the most obvious victims, with about\n9-thousand killed, or half of the population occurring at the time of the spill. About 60% of the dead birds\n562 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills weregrebesandloons,whichwinterinthearea.Attemptsweremadetocaptureandcleanoiledbirds,butthe\neffortswerenotverysuccessful.Coastalecosystemswerealsoseverelydamaged,especiallyinrockyintertidal\nhabitats,butrecoverywasfairlyrapid.Withinoneyear,barnaclesbegantore-colonizeintertidalhabitat,evenon\nrocksstillcoveredwithasphalticresidue.Beachesusedforrecreationwerecleanedbytheremovalofoilysand,\nblastingwithwaterorsteam,orsprayingwithsolventtowashresiduesbacktosea.AswiththeTorreyCanyon\ncleanup, these methods using highly toxic dispersants greatly worsened the ecological damage.\nSpills in the Arctic Ocean\nLarge but still poorly known reserves of oil and gas occur in Arctic regions of Canada and Alaska.

This is particularly true in much of northern Canada, where deep infiltration into\nthe soil may be prevented by impenetrable bedrock or permafrost. The relatively localized impacts of many\nterrestrial spills of petroleum are very different from the effects in aquatic environments, in which spilled oil\nspreads widely and can affect an enormous area.\nResearch has also shown that a wide range of natural, soil-dwelling microorganisms can utilize petroleum\nresidues as a metabolic substrate (as a food). These oil-degrading bacteria, fungi, and other microbes are\nwidespreadinsoilsandwaters.Aftersoilbecomespollutedbyanoilspill,theyrapidlyproliferateinresponseto\nthe presence of hydrocarbons that can be used as a source of metabolic energy.\nPetroleum is a carbon-rich substrate, but it is highly deficient in key nutrients such as nitrogen and\nphosphorus. Consequently, the vigour of the microbial response to oiling, and the rate of decomposition of\nresidues,canbegreatlyincreasedbyaddingfertilizer.Microbialdecompositionofresiduescanalsobeenhanced\nby tilling the soil to increase the availability of oxygen. In general, fertilizer addition and tilling are relatively\ninexpensivebuteffectivewaystospeedupthebiodegradationofpetroleumresidues,whileavoidingthesevere\ndamage associated with a physical cleanup. This is particularly true of agricultural areas.\nOf course, any spilled oil that reaches groundwater or surface waters will cause severe damage there. Spills\ninto high-energy streams and rivers become extensively dispersed, and some residues will flow into lakes or\ntheocean.Oilinpondsandlakescanbequitepersistent,accumulatingaroundthemargins,wherevegetation\nand wildlife habitat are damaged. However, after spilled petroleum has weathered for a year or more, the\ntoxicity of the residues may decrease so that aquatic plants can grow through surface slicks without suffering\n564 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills muchdamage.Thephytoplanktonandzooplanktoncommunitiesarealsosomewhatresistanttoweatheredoil.\nHowever,anywaterfowlthatattempttouseoiledwaterbodiesbecomefouledwithresidues,andthisisusually\nfatal to them.\nStudies have been made of the effects of petroleum on tundra and boreal forest ecosystems, including\nexperimental spills onto vegetation.

What are the causes of petroleum spills to the oceans?\n2. Why were the ecological effects of the Amoco Cadiz spill fewer and shorter-lasting than those of the\nTorrey Canyon?\n3. Explain why the addition of fertilizer can be an effective way of treating the residues of oil spills.\n4. Why does oil spilled on water affect a much larger area than a comparable volume spilled on land?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Considering the poor survival of aquatic birds after they have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d from oiling and returned\nto the ocean, do you think that it is worthwhile to treat these victims of oil spills?\n2. In view of the ecological risks, do you think that oil exploration and extraction should be allowed in the\nCanadian Arctic?\n3. Why is it not possible to prevent all spills of petroleum?\n4. Examine the data in Table 21.1 and use them to inform an analysis of the reasons for the international trade\nin petroleum. Consider both the global context and that of North America.\nExploring Issues\n1. A proposal has been made to build an oil refinery on the coast (choose whichever one you live closest to).\nThe crude oil will be brought to the refinery by tanker ships, and the refined products will be distributed by\nship, train, and truck. You are working as an environmental consultant and have been asked to recommend\nspill-prevention and countermeasure tactics to protect the marine and terrestrial environments around the\nrefinery. Provide a list of practices that would provide this function of spill prevention and\ncountermeasures.\n566 | Chapter 21 ~ Oil Spills References Cited and Further Reading\nAlexander, V. and K.

One way to gain an advantage\ninmanyofthoseecologicalinteractionsisthroughtheuseofpesticides.Thesesubstancesareusedtoprotect\ncropplants,livestock,domesticanimals,andpeoplefromdamageanddiseasescausedbymicroorganisms,fungi,\ninsects, rodents, and other \u201cpests,\u201d and to defend crops from competition with unwanted but abundant \u201cweeds.\u201d\nIt is important to understand that the use of words like \u201cpest\u201d and \u201cweed\u201d is highly contextual. In most\nsituations, for example, white-tailed deer are valued for their wild beauty, and they provide economic and\nsubsistence benefits through hunting. However, this animal may also be considered a pest when it feeds in a\ngarden, agricultural field, or forestry plantation. The same is true, to some degree, of other species that are\nconsidered to be a pest or weed.\nPeople have been using pesticides for a long time (Hayes, 1991). There are records of unspecified chemicals\nbeingusedbyEgyptianstodrivefleasfromtheirhomeaslongas3,500yearsago.Arsenichasbeenusedasan\ninsecticideinChinaforatleast2,900years.InhisepicpoemtheOdyssey,theGreekpoetHomer(writingabout\n2,800 years ago) referred to the burning of sulphur (which generates toxic SO2gas) to purge homes of vermin\nsuch as fleas.\nHowever,pesticideusehasbecomemuchmorecommoninmoderntimes,andanenormouslywidervariety\nofsubstancesisbeingused.Atleast300insecticides,290herbicides,165fungicides,andmanyotherpesticidal\nchemicalsareavailableinmorethan3,000differentformulations.Strictlyspeaking,apesticideisaproductthat\nconsists of a formulation of several chemicals \u2013 the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d attacks the pest, while various \u201cinert\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 569 ingredients\u201d enhance its effectiveness (see In Detail 22.1). Even larger numbers of \u201ccommercial products\u201d are\navailable, because many involve similar formulations manufactured by different companies.\nAlmostallpesticidesarechemicals.Theactiveingredientsofsomeofthemarebasedonnaturalbiochemicals\nthat are extracted from plants grown for that purpose, while others are inorganic chemicals based on toxic\nmetals or compounds of arsenic. Most modern pesticides, however, are organic chemicals that have been\nsynthesized by chemists.

In fact, it has been\nargued that pesticide use in North America could be decreased by half without greatly affecting crop yields\n(Pimenteletal.,1991).TheEuropeanUnion(EU)hastakensomeforcefulstepstoreducepesticideusewithinits\njurisdiction(PesticideNews,2003).In2003,EUpermitsfor320pesticideswererevoked,andasmanyasanother\n180 were scheduled for delisting in 2010; in total, half of the pesticides used in 1993 were no longer permitted\nin2010.Inlargepart,thewithdrawalsinvolveobsoletepesticidesandothersofminorcommercialimportance,\nfor which the owners do not want to invest the large amounts of money needed to assure EU regulators that\ntheir products are safe for people and the environment. Similar actions are also occurring in North America,\nbut they are less advanced than in the EU. Because of the substantial benefits that can be derived from the\nuse of pesticides, their consumption has increased enormously during the past half-century. Overall, the use\nofpesticidesincreasedten-foldinNorthAmericabetween1945and1989(Pimenteletal.,1992),althoughithas\nsincelevelledoff.Pesticideuseisnowafirmlyintegratedcomponentoftechnologicalsystemsthatarewidely\nused in modern agriculture, forestry, horticulture, and public health management in most parts of the world.\nUnfortunately, the considerable benefits of pesticides are partially offset by damage their use causes to\necosystems and sometimes to human health. Each year, about one-million people are poisoned by pesticides,\nwith as many as 20-thousand fatalities (Pimentel et al., 1992). Although developing countries account for only\nabout 20% of global pesticide use, they sustain about half of the poisonings. This is because relatively toxic\ninsecticides are used in many developing countries, by a workforce whose widespread illiteracy hinders the\nunderstandingofinstructionsforproperuse,andwhosesafetyisfurthercompromisedbypoorenforcementof\nregulations and by inadequate use of protective equipment and clothing.\nThemosttragiccaseofpesticide-relatedpoisoningoccurredin1984atBhopal,India.About2,800peoplewere\nkilledand20-thousandseriouslypoisonedwhenafactoryaccidentallyreleased40tonnesofmethylisocyanate\nvapour to the atmosphere.

Many birds, mammals, and other creatures may also be poisoned. The non-target\nmortality may include predators and competitors of the pest, an ecological change that may release it from\nsomeofitsbiologicalcontrols.Clearly,thegreatchallengeofpestcontrolistodevelopeffective,pest-specific\npesticides and to invent non-pesticidal methods.\nPesticideusehasbeenexpandingrapidly,andthisishappeninginallcountries,althoughtovaryingdegrees.\nAlthoughmuchisknownabouttheenvironmentaldamagecausedbytheuseofpesticides,notallofthepotential\neffects are well understood. In this chapter we examine the nature of pesticides and their important uses. We\nthen examine cases of ecological damage caused by their routine use to deal with pest-management problems.\nIn Detail 22.1. Pesticides, Formulations, and Inert Ingredients. A commercial pesticide product is a\nmixture of chemicals that can be used to kill or otherwise control pests. The \u201cactive ingredient\u201d is the\nchemicalthatactuallyattacksthepest,whileso-called\u201cinertingredients\u201dareaddedtotheformulation\ntoenhanceitseffectiveness.Inertingredientsmaydothisbymakingthepesticideeasiertoapply(such\nas by making it soluble in water), by helping it to spread or stick to leaf surfaces, or by stabilizing the\nformulation to increase its shelf-life.\nMany inert ingredients are, however, biologically active, so they are not really passive substances\n(Environment Canada, 2001; EPA, 2005). It is more realistic to refer to them as \u201cother ingredients.\u201d In\ngeneral, the percentage of other ingredients in a pesticide is specified on the product label, but their\nidentity and concentrations are not given because they are considered to be proprietary information\nofcommercialvalue.Sometimes,however,amanufacturerwillidentifytheseingredients,andmayeven\nspecifytheirconcentration.Someinertingredientscarryrisksofcausingtoxicitythroughnormaluseof\nthe pesticide. Examples of particular concern include chlorobenzene, dioctyl phthalate, formaldehyde,\nhexane, hydroquinone, isophorone, nonylphenol, phenol, and rhodamine.\nOneinertingredientthathasengenderedparticularcontroversyaboutitspotentialtoxicitytohumans\nis nonylphenol (NP), which is used as an emulsifier in some pesticides. NP is a degradation product\nof nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), which have been used for decades as detergents and emulsifiers.\nTheyareusedinmanufacturingprocessesforpaint,paper,pesticides,petrochemicals,resins,steel,and\ntextiles, and are ingredients in many cleaning products.\nNPEs and NP are anthropogenic chemicals that enter the environment with discharges of industrial\nand municipal wastewater. NPEs degrade by microbial reactions, and some of the metabolites are\nbioactive through toxicity and estrogenic (hormonal) effects, including NP, nonylphenol diethoxylate,\nnonylphenolethoxylate,nonylphenoxyaceticacid,andnonylphenoxyethoxyaceticacid.Thesemayhave\na moderate persistence in the environment, especially in anaerobic habitats and in groundwater, and\ntheynowhavedevelopedawidespreadbutlowlevelofcontaminationandbioaccumulation.Speciesvary\nwidely in their vulnerability to toxicity from NP and NPEs, but many studies have reported toxic and\nestrogenic effects on aquatic organisms.\nSome toxicologists believe that humans are also exposed to significant risks from these chemicals,\nthrough the use of consumer products, food, and other pathways. In a risk assessment, Environment\nCanada (2001) concluded that \u201cnonylphenol and its ethoxylates are entering the environment in a\nquantity or concentration . . . [that has] or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on\nthe environment or its biological diversity,\u201d so they should be regulated as \u201ctoxic\u201d chemicals under the\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 571 Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Although these chemicals are not \u201cconsidered a priority for\ninvestigationofoptionstoreducehumanexposurethroughcontrolofsources,\u201ditwasrecommendedthat\nfurther studies of their bioactivity and environmental risks be undertaken.\nAlthough the major releases of NP and related chemicals are via industrial and municipal effluents,\ntheyarealsopresentas\u201cotheringredients\u201dinpesticides.Thishasledtocontroversyaboutdamagethat\nmay be caused to people and wild organisms exposed to NPEs and NP through the use of pesticides.\nThecaseofNPEsandtheirmetabolitesreinforcesthefactthatproductformulations should beknown\nandcomprehensivelyevaluatedwhenconsideringtherisksofpesticideusetohumanandenvironmental\nsafety.\nThe Nature of Pesticides\nClassification by Target\nPesticides are defined by their usefulness in killing or otherwise decreasing the abundance of species that are\ndeemedtobe\u201cpests.\u201dPesticidesare,however,anextremelydiversegroupofsubstances.Tobetterunderstand\ntheir usefulness and toxicity, and the damage they cause, it is helpful to categorize them in various ways. One\nclassification is based on the intended target of the use:\n\u2022 a fungicide is used against fungi that cause diseases and other damage to crop plants and animals\n\u2022 a herbicide is used to kill weeds, which are unwanted plants that interfere with some human purpose; most\nuse in agriculture and forestry is intended to release crop plants from competition, while horticultural use\nis mostly for aesthetics\n\u2022 an insecticide is used to kill insects that are pests in agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, or that spread\ndiseases such as mosquito vectors (a path by which a disease is spread) of malaria, yellow fever, and\nencephalitis\n\u2022 an acaricide is used to kill mites that are pests in agriculture, and ticks that are vectors of ailments such as\nLyme disease and typhus\n\u2022 a molluscicide is used to kill snails and slugs in agriculture and gardens, and aquatic snails that are vectors\nof diseases such as schistosomiasis\n\u2022 a nematicide is used against nematodes, which can damage the roots of agricultural plants\n\u2022 a rodenticide is used to control mice, rats, gophers, and other rodents that are pests in agriculture or\naround the home\n\u2022 an avicide is used to kill birds, which are sometimes considered pests in agriculture\n\u2022 a piscicide is used to kill fish, which may be pests in aquaculture\n\u2022 an algicide is used to kill unwanted growths of algae, for example, in swimming pools\n\u2022 bactericides, disinfectants, and antibiotics are used to control infections and diseases caused by bacteria\n(Note that antibiotics are not actually classified as \u201cpesticides\u201d under the Pest Control Products Act)\n572 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides Chemical Classification\nBecause almost all pesticides are chemicals, they can be categorized according to similarities in chemical\nstructure.ThemostimportantgroupsaredescribedbelowandinTable22.1.Afew\u201cnon-chemical\u201dpesticidesare\nbased on microbes, and are discussed later under \u201cBiological Pesticides.\u201d\nTable 22.1. Some Important Pesticides.\nInorganicpesticidesarecompoundsthatcontaintoxicelementssuchasarsenic,copper,lead,ormercury.They\nare highly persistent in terrestrial environments, being only slowly dispersed by leaching and erosion by wind\nor water. Recently, inorganic pesticides have been widely replaced by synthetic organics. Prominent examples\nincludeBordeauxmixture,acomplexofcopper-basedcompoundsthatisusedasafungicidetoprotectfruitand\nvegetablecrops,andarsenicalssuchasarsenictrioxide,sodiumarsenite,andcalciumarsenate,whichareused\nas herbicides and soil sterilants. Paris green, lead arsenate, and calcium arsenate are used as insecticides.\nOrganicpesticidesaremostlysynthesizedchemicals,butsomearenaturaltoxinsproducedbycertainplants\nthat are extracted and used as pesticides. Important examples include the following:\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 573 \u2022 Natural organic pesticides are extracted from plants. For example, nicotine and related alkaloids are\nextracted from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and used as insecticides, usually applied as nicotine sulphate.\nNeonicotinoids are a synthetic analogue. Pyrethrum is a complex of chemicals extracted from certain\nchrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccinium) and used as an insecticide.\nRotenone is extracted from several tropical shrubs (Derris elliptica and Lonchocarpus utilis) and used as an\ninsecticide, rodenticide, or piscicide. Red squill, extracted from the sea onion (Scilla maritima), is a\nrodenticide, as is strychnine, extracted from the tropical shrub Strychnos nux-vomica.\n\u2022 Synthetic organometallic pesticides are used as fungicides and include organomercurials such as\nmethylmercury and phenylmercuric acetate.\n\u2022 Phenols include trichlorophenols, tetrachlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol, which are fungicides used\nmostly to preserve wood.\n\u2022 Chlorinated hydrocarbons (organochlorines) are a diverse group of synthetic pesticides (see In Detail 22.2).\nMost are quite persistent, having a half-life of about 10 years in soil because they are not easily degraded by\nmicroorganisms or by physical agents such as sunlight or heat. The persistence of organochlorines,\ncoupled with their strongly lipophilic nature (they are highly soluble in fats and lipids, but virtually\ninsoluble in water), means that they strongly bioconcentrate and biomagnify, with the highest\nconcentrations occurring in top predators (see In Detail 18.1 and Figure 22.1). Organochlorines include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 DDT and its insecticidal relatives, such as DDD and methoxychlor, were once widely used insecticides.\nBecause of bans in North America and Europe in the early 1970s, their use is now confined to tropical\ncountries. DDE is a persistent non-insecticidal metabolite of DDT and DDD that accumulates in organisms.\n\u2022 Lindane is the active constituent of hexachlorocyclohexane, an insecticide.\n\u2022 Cyclodienes are highly chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, such as chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, and dieldrin,\nall of which are insecticides.\n\u2022 Chlorophenoxy acids have growth-regulating influences on plants and are used as herbicides against\nbroad-leafed weeds. The most important compound is 2,4-D, but others are 2,4,5-T, MCPA, and silvex.\n\u2022 Other organochlorines include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans. These are not\npesticides but are mentioned here because their ecotoxicological properties are similar to those of the\npesticide organochlorines: they are persistent in the environment and are lipophilic, so they\nbioconcentrate and food-web magnify.\n\u2022 Organophosphorus pesticides are used mostly as insecticides, acaricides, and nematicides. They are not\npersistent in the environment, but are extremely toxic to arthropods and also to non-target fish, birds, and\nmammals. Parathion, fenitrothion, malathion, and phosphamidon are prominent examples of\norganophosphate insecticides. Glyphosate, a phosphonoalkyl compound, is an important herbicide (it is not\ntoxic to animals).\n\u2022 Carbamate pesticides have a moderate persistence in the environment but are highly toxic to arthropods,\nand in some cases, to vertebrates. Aminocarb, carbaryl, and carbofuran are important insecticides.\n\u2022 Triazine pesticides are used as herbicides and sometimes as soil sterilants. Prominent examples are\natrazine, simazine, and hexazinone.\n\u2022 Synthetic pyrethroids are analogues of natural pyrethrum and are used mostly as insecticides and\nacaricides. Pyrethroids are highly toxic to invertebrates and fish, but they are of variable toxicity to\nmammals and of low toxicity to birds. Important examples are cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin,\nsynthetic pyrethrum and pyrethrins, and tetramethrin.\n\u2022 Biological Pesticides are formulations of microbes that are pathogenic to specific pests and so have a\nnarrow spectrum of toxicity in ecosystems. The best examples are insecticides based on the bacterium\nBacillus thuringiensis (B.t.), types of which are used against moths, flies, and beetles. Insecticides based on\n574 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) and insect hormones have also been developed.\n\u2022 Genetically modified organisms (GMOs; see Environmental Issues 6.1) have been biologically \u201cengineered\u201d\nby inserting portions of DNA from another species into their genome. This high-tech procedure has been\nused to develop new varieties of commercial crops that are more resistant to certain pesticides or pests,\nwhich can make it easier to cultivate them. For example, GMO varieties of soybean and canola have been\ndeveloped to be resistant to glyphosate, meaning this herbicide can be used on those crops, providing\nreduced costs of energy and machinery to control weeds. In addition, there are GMO varieties of maize\n(corn) that contain DNA of Bacillus thuringiensis, which provides resistance to some insect pests and allows\nfarmers to use less insecticide. These and other GMO crops are widely cultivated in North America,\nalthough they are banned in many countries, including most of Europe and Brazil. The use of these GMO\ncrops is controversial because there is incomplete knowledge about the biological and ecological risks of\ntheir use, including the potential escape of their GMO factors to wild plants.\nFigure 22.1. Residues of PCBs in the Food Web of Lake Ontario. Organochlorine insecticides, such\nas DDT, DDD, and dieldrin, show a similar pattern of bioaccumulation and biomagnification as PCBs,\nbut their residue levels are different. Source: Data from Environmental Protection Agency (2003).\nInDetail22.2.ChemicalStructureofOrganochlorinesOrganochlorinesareadiversegroupofcompounds\nthat are made up of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine.

Another example is the extremely toxic dioxin\nTCDD, which is non-intentionally synthesized as a contaminant during the manufacturing of certain\norganochlorines (such as trichlorophenol) and through reactions occurring when organic waste is\nincinerated.\nThe following diagrams illustrate the specific chemical structures of a number of environmentally\nimportant organochlorines. In the diagrams, the ring-like structures are derived from benzene, which\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 575 hastheformulaC6H6.Organochlorinesareformedbythesubstitutionofoneormoreofthehydrogen\natoms by chlorine atoms. Note the following:\n\u2022 There is great similarity among DDT, DDD, and DDE, which differ by only a single chlorine atom\n\u2022 Similarly, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T differ by only one chlorine atom\n\u2022 PCBsareacomplexmixtureofmoleculeswithabasicbiphenylstructure,butvaryingintheamount\nof substitution of chlorine for hydrogen atoms; in the diagram, \u201cX\u201d can be either H or Cl\n\u2022 TCDD, strictly speaking, is not an organochlorine because it contains two oxygen atoms\nDDT or 2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (an\ninsecticide)\nDDD or 2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (an\ninsecticide)\nDDE or 2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (non-\ninsecticidal metabolite of DDT and DDD)\n2,4-D or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (a herbicide)\n2,4,5-T or 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (a herbicide)\n576 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides PCBsorpolychlorinatedbiphenyls(electricalinsulatingfluid)\nTCDDor2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin(atrace\ncontaminant)\nPesticide Use\nTheglobaluseofpesticideswasabout2.4-milliontonnesin2007,atotalthatincludesinsecticides,herbicides,\nfungicides, preservatives, and disinfectants (Grube et al., 2007). Global pesticide trade in 2007 had a value of\nabout US$39 billion. About 39% (by weight) of pesticides used were herbicides; insecticides accounted for\n18%, fungicides for 10%, and \u201cother chemicals\u201d for 33% (mostly used as soil fumigants). Data for the United\nStates were herbicides 44%, insecticides 9%, and fungicides 6%. Data for Canada are not available but would\nbe proportionately similar to those for the United States (Canada accounts for about one-ninth of the North\nAmericanmarketforpesticides).TotalexpendituresforpesticidesintheUnitedStateswereaboutUS$12billion\nin 2007.

Strictly speaking, these chemicals are not considered pesticides,\neven though they are used against certain pests. The most important uses of pesticides are in agriculture and\nforestry,aroundthehome,andinhumanhealthandsanitationprograms.Weexaminetheseusesinthefollowing\nsections.\nPesticide Use for Human Health\nVarious insects and ticks are vectors that transmit pathogens among individuals of the same species, or from\nan alternate host to people, or to domestic and wild animals. Important human diseases that are vectored by\ninvertebrates incluse the following:\n\u2022 malaria, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium and spread to people by Anopheles mosquitoes\n\u2022 yellow fever, encephalitis, and West Nile virus, caused by viruses and spread by mosquitoes\n\u2022 sleeping sickness, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma and spread by the tsetse fly Glossina\n\u2022 plague or black death, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and transmitted by the rat flea Xenopsylla\ncheops\n\u2022 typhoid, caused by the bacterium Rickettsia prowazeki and transmitted by the louse Pediculus humanus\n\u2022 schistosomiasis or bilharziasis, caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma, with freshwater snails as the\nalternate host\nTo varying degrees, the incidence of these maladies can be controlled by using pesticides against the\ninvertebrate vectors or the alternate hosts. The abundance of mosquitoes, for example, can be reduced by\nsprayinginsecticideintheiraquaticbreedinghabitatorbyapplyingapersistentinsecticidetotheinteriorwalls\nof buildings, where they rest. Similarly, people infested with body lice may receive a surface dusting with an\ninsecticide\u2013thiswasanearlyuseofDDT.Plaguecanbecontrolledbyusingrodenticidealongwithsanitation\nprograms to reduce rat populations. Over the past half-century, pesticides have decreased the abundance of\nvectors and alternate hosts and have spared hundreds of millions of humans from the debilitating or deadly\neffectsofcertaindiseases,particularlyintropicalcountries.(Thishasbeenanimportantfactorinreducingdeath\nrates and allowed rapid population growth.)\nInfact,oneofthefirstimportantusesofDDTwasinNaples,Italy,duringtheSecondWorldWar,toprevent\na deadly plague of typhus that could have decimated Allied troops and the civilian population. Because of the\nsuccessofthisuseofDDTanditscontributiontothevictoriouswareffort,theBritishprimeministeratthetime,\nWinston Churchill, referred to the insecticide as \u201cthat miraculous DDT powder.\u201d\nMalaria has long been an important disease in tropical countries. During the 1950s, about 5% of the global\npopulation was infected with malaria. The use of insecticide to reduce the abundance of mosquitoes achieved\nhuge reductions in the incidence of malaria in some countries. For instance, during 1933-1935, India recorded\nabout 100-million cases of malaria per year and 750-thousand deaths. However, the incidence was reduced\nto 150-thousand cases and 1,500 deaths in 1966 because of spraying with DDT and the draining of mosquito-\nbreedingwetlands(McEwenandStephenson,1979).Similarly,2.9-millioncasesofmalariaoccurredinSriLanka\n578 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides in 1934, and 2.8 million in 1946, but DDT use helped to reduce that incidence to only 17 cases in 1963 (Hayes,\n1991).However,malariahasrecentlybeenresurginginsometropicalcountries,partlybecausemosquitoeshave\ndevelopedageneticallybasedtoleranceofpreviouslyeffectiveinsecticides.Manypeopleareagainbeingexposed\nto the malarial parasite, although the disease can today be controlled by drugs that prevent Plasmodium from\nmultiplying in the blood. (However, there are also signs that Plasmodium is becoming resistant to those drugs.)\nPesticides and Agriculture\nModernagricultureisahighlytechnologicalactivity.Machines,energy,fertilizer,pesticides,andhigh-yieldcrop\nvarietiesareusedinintensivemanagementsystemstogrowcrops(seeChapters14and24).Theroleofpesticides\nis to help control the abundance of the following problems:\n\u2022 weeds that compete with crop plants\n\u2022 invertebrates and rodents that feed on crops or stored produce\n\u2022 microbial diseases that can kill the crop or diminish its yield\nUndeniably, these uses of pesticides are important factors in modern agriculture. Even with pesticide use, the\ndamage caused by pests and diseases around the world are equivalent to about 24% of the potential crop of\nwheat,46%ofrice,35%ofcorn(maize),55%ofsugarcane,37%ofgrapes,and28%ofvegetables(McEwenand\nStephenson,1979).InNorthAmericapestsdestroyabout37%ofthepotentialproductionoffoodandfibrecrops\n(Pimentel et al., 1992).\nOf course, management practices in agriculture have intensified greatly, particularly during the twentieth\ncenturyandsince.Thischangehasresultedinincreasesincropproductivity.Thegainsinagriculturalyieldhave\nbeen largely achieved by the combined influences of the following:\n\u2022 fossil-fuelled mechanization\n\u2022 fertilizer use\n\u2022 improved crop varieties grown in monocultural systems\n\u2022 the use of pesticides\nThe recent intensification of agrotechnology is sometimes referred to as the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d. Although\nagricultural yields have increased greatly, it must be recognized that the gains are highly subsidized by the\nfollowing (see also Chapters 14 and 24):\n\u2022 intense use (and depletion) of non-renewable fossil fuels and metals\n\u2022 depletion of potentially renewable resources, such as soil fertility and tilth, and groundwater and surface\nwater needed for irrigation\n\u2022 loss of soil mass through erosion\n\u2022 extensive salinization of soils in semi-arid regions (caused by inappropriate methods of irrigation)\n\u2022 ecological damage associated with the conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural ones\n\u2022 ecotoxicological damage caused by the use of pesticides\nIntheUnitedStates,forexample,theyieldofcornwastypicallyabout1.4t/ha-yrin1933,butitincreasedto4.2\nt/ha-yrin1963andto5.1-7.1t/ha-yrduring1978-1984.InMexico,wheatyieldsincreasedfrom0.75t/ha-yrin\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 579 1945to2.6t/ha-yrin1964.TheyieldofriceinJapanincreasedfromapre-waraverageof1.8t/ha-yrto4.0t/\nha-yrin1963,whileintheUnitedStates,riceyieldshavereached4.9\u20135.5t/ha-yr(Hayes,1991).Similargainsin\nagricultural yield have been realized in Canada (see Figure 14.1).\nAlmostallintensivelymanagedagriculturalsystemsdependtosomedegreeonpestcontrol.High-yieldcrop\nvarietiesareoftenvulnerabletoinfestationbyinsectpests,diseases,andcompetitionfromweeds.Pesticidesare\nroutinelyprescribedtomanagethoseproblems.Moreover,monoculturalsystems(inwhichonlyasinglecropis\ngrowninafield)resultinreducedpopulationsofnaturalpredatorsandparasites,whichcanexacerbateexisting\npestsandallownewonestodevelop.Someenvironmentalistshavedescribedintensivelymanagedagricultural\nsystems as being a pesticide treadmill, because they rely on pesticides, often in increasing quantities, to deal\nwith unanticipated pests that emerge as \u201csurprises.\u201d\nTheuseofpesticidesinCanadianagriculturehasincreasedgreatlyinrecentdecades.Herbicidewasapplied\nto26.7-millionhectaresoffarmlandin2011,athree-foldincreaseover1971(Table14.10).Insecticideandfungicide\nwere applied to 8.7-million hectares, an 11-fold increase. Overall, pesticide use in North American agriculture\nincreasedbyaboutten-foldbetween1945and1989(Pimenteletal.,1992).Interestingly,duringthatsameperiod,\ncroplosses(toinsectsonly)actuallyincreasedsomewhat,fromabout7%during1941-1951to13%during1951-1974\n(Hayes, 1991). These trends, which might seem to contradict each other, may be due to such factors as the\ndevelopment of tolerance by some pests to pesticides, the emergence of new pests because of accidental\nintroductions,changesinpredator-preyrelationshipscausedbypesticideuse,andtheintroductionofnewcrop\nvarieties that are vulnerable to pests.\nAgricultural damage caused by arthropod pests varies greatly. Sometimes there is direct competition with\nhumansforafoodresource,aswheninsectsdefoliatecropsinfieldsorattackstoredfood.Suchdepredations\ncan sometimes obliterate agricultural yield, as can happen during a severe infestation of locusts. More\ncommonly, however, insects reduce the yield only somewhat.\nInsomecases,however,evenminordamagebypestscanmaketheproduceunsaleable.Thiscanbethecaseof\ndamagecausedtoapplesbythecodlingmoth(Carpocapsapomonella).\u201cWormy\u201dappleswithlarvaeofthisinsect\narenotsaleabletoconsumers,andupto90%ofthefruitinunsprayedorchardsmaybeinfested(McEwenand\nStephenson,1979).Evenaminordiscolorationoffruit,suchasapplescabandrussetingoforanges(neitheraffect\ntheproductivityornutritionalqualityofthecrop)areconsideredunacceptablebymanyconsumers.Therefore,\nseeminglyunimportantcropdamagecanbeacriticaleconomicconsiderationforfarmersandthefoodindustry.\nAs with some potentially life-saving drugs, pesticides are over-prescribed for some uses.\nMuch pesticide use in agriculture is targeted against weeds, which interfere with crop plants by competing\nfor limited resources of light, water, and nutrients. (Of course, \u201cweediness\u201d is partly a matter of context \u2013 in\nothersituations,someweedspecieshavepositiveattributes.)Itiswellknownthatweeds,ifabundant,cancause\nlargedecreasesintheproductivityofagriculturalcrops,evenby50-90%.Thisisthereasonwhyfarmershave\nalwaystakenmeasurestoreducetheabundanceofweeds,initiallybyhand-pullingorhoeingthemandlaterby\nmechanicalcultivation(ploughing)todisrupttheirgrowth.Morerecently,chemicalherbicideshavebeenwidely\nusedtocontrolagriculturalweeds.IntheUnitedStates,forexample,herbicideisusedon85%oftheplantedarea\nformostcrops(GianessiandSankula,2003).Cropsreceivingthemostherbicidearecanola(on99%itscultivated\narea),drybeans(99%),carrot(98%),maize(98%),rice(98%),sugarbeet(98%),peanut(97%),greenbean(96%),\nsoybean (96%), tomato (96%), blueberry (95%), citrus (95%), cotton (95%), and potato (93%). Herbicide use in\nwheatisrelativelylow(55%)becausemechanicalcultivationduringsowingiseffectiveinreducingweedsforthis\ncrop.\nAccording to Gianessi and Sankula (2003), if herbicide use were discontinued for the 40 crops they studied,\nthen weed management would have to rely on increased mechanical cultivation and manual weeding. They\ncalculated that would have an annual cost of US$14 billion, about double that of herbicide use ($6.6 billion per\nyear).Ifherbicideusewerediscontinuedandreplacedbyalternativepractices,theyestimatedthat35ofthe40\n580 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides crops studied would suffer a decline in productivity, by an average of 21% (range of 5-67%). The productivity\nloss would have a value of about $21 billion per year (including $13 billion in lost productivity and $8 billion in\nincreasedcostsofmanagement).Note,however,thatthe\u201cdirectcosts\u201dofherbicideusecitedabove($6.6billion/\nyr) do not include the value of environmental damage that might be caused, for instance, by toxicity to non-\ntarget plants, wildlife, or agricultural workers. It must be remembered that non-herbicidal methods of weed\ncontrolalsocauseenvironmentaldamage,particularlymechanicalcultivation,whichincreasessoilerosionand\ncompaction. No-till management systems, which greatly reduce the rate of erosion, must rely on the use of\nherbicide to control weeds.\nOf course, the weeds must be vulnerable to the toxicity of the herbicide being used against them, while the\ncrop plant must be tolerant. Some herbicides are toxic to broad-leaved weeds (dicotyledonous plants) but not\ntocorn,wheat,barley,orothercropsinthegrassfamily(monocotyledonous plants).Consequently,herbicides\narewidelyusedingrainagricultureinNorthAmerica.Forinstance,about98%ofthemaizeandriceacreageis\ntreated.Someimportantdiseasesofagriculturalplantscanbemanagedwithpesticide.Sometimes,insecticide\nis sprayed to control arthropod vectors of microbial diseases.

For instance, insecticide may be used to kill bedbugs\nand cockroaches, and rodenticide to poison rats and mice. As well, large amounts of pesticide are used in\nhorticulture. Herbicides are especially widely applied, mostly to achieve the grass-lawn aesthetic that many\nhomeownersseek.Tothisend,herbicideisusedtokillbroad-leavedplantssuchasdandelionandplantain.The\n\u201cweed\u201d in common \u201cweed-and-feed\u201d lawn preparations is the herbicide 2,4-D, dicamba, or mecoprop.\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 581 Someofthemostintensivepesticideusageoccursinthemanagementofgolfcourses,particularlyonputting\ngreenswherethelawnqualitymustbeveryconsistent.Fungicideisusedinespeciallylargeamountstoprevent\nturf-grassdiseases.Onaper-unitareabasis,theuseofpesticidesonputtinggreenscanbemoreintensivethan\nalmost any in agriculture.\nEnvironmental Effects\nPesticide applications are intended to manage the impacts of pests by reducing their abundance and damage\nto below an economically or aesthetically acceptable threshold.

Non-target exposures include both direct contact with a\nsprayed pesticide as well as indirect exposure through the food web.\nThe ecotoxicological risk that is inherent in an exposure to pesticide (and to other chemicals) is influenced\nbyacomplexofvariables,aswepreviouslyexaminedinChapter15.Severalpointsshouldbeconsideredwhen\ninterpreting exposures of non-target organisms (including people) to pesticides and other chemicals:\n\u2022 All chemicals are potentially toxic\n\u2022 Not all exposures to potentially toxic chemicals result in poisoning (because organisms are to some degree\ntolerant to pesticides and other chemicals)\n\u2022 Some pesticides and some naturally occurring chemicals are extremely toxic to many organisms, including\nhumans\n\u2022 Humans are subject to both involuntary and voluntary exposures to certain toxic chemicals (the latter\nincludes prescription and recreational drugs)\nOfcourse,pesticidesvaryenormouslyintheirtoxicity.Herbicides,forexample,areextremelytoxictoatleast\nsome plants, but not necessarily to animals, which differ in important physiological respects from plants. In\ncontrast, most insecticides and rodenticides are toxic to a wide range of animals and can cause non-target\npoisoning of diverse species, including humans.\nTheacutetoxicityofachemicaltoanimalsisdefinedbyitsLD50,orthedoseneededtokillone-halfofatest\npopulation that is exposed through food, water, or air.

Source: Modified from Freedman (1995)\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 583 584 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides By poisoning organisms, pesticides may also cause habitat changes to occur, which can indirectly affect many\nspecies. For example, herbicide kills plants and thereby changes the habitat of animals, perhaps depriving\nherbivores of their preferred foods. Similarly, broad-spectrum insecticides kill large numbers of arthropods,\nwhich reduces the amount of food available for birds and other animals. These and other indirect effects of\npesticide use can result in ecological damage, in addition to the directly toxic effects.\nIntheremainderofthischapter,wewillexamineseveralcasestudiesofparticularusesofpesticides.These\nareusefulinillustratingthebroaderprinciplesandpatternsoftheecologicaldamagecausedbythesechemicals.\nDDT and Related Organochlorines\nThe first case study involves DDT and related organochlorine insecticides, such as DDD, dieldrin, and aldrin.\nThese chemicals were once widely used in Canada and most other developed countries. Although these\norganochlorines were banned here in the early 1970s, they continue to be used in some less-developed nations.\nDDT and its relatives are persistent in the environment. Consequently, even though these chemicals have\nnot been used in Canada for several decades, there are still substantial residues in the ecosystems of our\ncountry. In part, this is also a result of the continued use of these organochlorines in some tropical countries,\nbecausesmallamountsofresiduefromthoseongoingusesaretransportedtohigh-latitudecountriesbyglobal\ncyclingprocesses.Inaddition,organochlorinesaremorepersistentincoolerenvironmentsthaninwarmerones.\nAs a result, these and some non-insecticidal organochlorines (such as PCBs and dioxins) are still important\ncontaminants in Canada.\nDDT was first synthesized in 1874, but its insecticidal properties were not discovered until 1939. Its first\nimportantusewasduringWorldWarIIinprogramstocontrolbodylice,mosquitoes,andotherdiseasevectors.\nDDTwasquicklyrecognizedasbeinganextremelyeffectiveinsecticide,anditbecamewidelyusedinagriculture,\nforestry, and against malaria. The use of DDT peaked in 1970, when 175-million kilograms were manufactured\nglobally.Soonafterward,developedcountriesbegantobanmostusesofDDTbecauseitwasfoundtobecausing\necological damage, including the contamination of people and their food web. Some researchers thought this\ncontaminationcouldbecausingillnesses, suchasincreasesincancerandliverdisease.However,DDTusehas\ncontinued in some tropical countries, mostly against mosquito vectors of disease.\nHowever,eveninthosecountriestheuseofDDTandotherorganochlorineinsecticideshasbeendecreasing.\nThisispartlybecausemanypestshavedevelopedageneticallybasedtoleranceofthesechemicals(sometimes\nknown as resistance), which decreases their effectiveness as pesticides. The development of tolerance is an\nevolutionaryprocessinwhichexposuretoatoxicsubstanceselectsforresistantindividualswithinagenetically\nvariable population (see Chapters 6 and 15). Although tolerant individuals are normally rare in unsprayed\npopulations, they may become rapidly dominant in sprayed habitat. If the insecticide does not kill them, they\nsurvive to reproduce, and pass on the genes for tolerance to their offspring. More than 500 species of insects\nandmiteshavepopulationstoleranttoatleastoneinsecticide,andtherearemorethan100fungicide-resistant\nplantpathogens,55herbicide-tolerantweeds,andfiverodentsresistanttoanticoagulants(NRC,1986;Winston,\n199; Landis et al., 2002).\nSeveral physical and chemical properties of organochlorines have an important influence on their ability\nto cause ecological damage. First, they have an extended persistence, or a tendency to remain chemically\nunchanged in the environment because they are not easily degraded by microorganisms or by physical agents\nsuchassunlightorheat.Forexample,DDThasahalf-lifeinsoilof3-10years.Theprimarybreakdownproduct\nof DDT is the closely related organochlorine DDE, which has a similar persistence.\nIn addition, DDT and related organochlorines are essentially insoluble in water and so cannot be \u201cdiluted\u201d\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 585 into that abundant solvent. Instead, these chemicals are highly soluble in fats (or lipids), which occur mostly\nin organisms. Therefore, DDT and related organochlorines have a strong affinity for organisms, and they\naccumulate in living things in strong preference to the non-living environment \u2013 this process is called\nbioconcentration.\nMoreover, organisms are highly efficient at assimilating organochlorines that are present in their food. As a\nresult,predatorsatthetopofthefoodwebdevelopthehighestresiduesoforganochlorines,particularlyintheir\nfattytissues(thisisknownasbiomagnificationorfood-webmagnification).Bothbioconcentrationandfood-web\nmagnificationareprogressivewithage,sotheoldestindividualsinapopulationarethemostcontaminated(see\nIn Detail 18.1).\nThesepropertiesoforganochlorinesareillustratedinFigure22.1andTable22.3.Notethattheconcentrations\nare miniscule in air, water, and non-agricultural soil, compared with the much higher residues that occur in\norganisms.Notealsothatconcentrationsinplantsarelowerthaninherbivores,andthatresiduesarehighestat\nthe top of the food web, such as in predatory birds and humans.\nTable 22.3. Typical Residues of DDT in the 1960s and 1970s. Sources: Data from Edwards (1975) and\nFreedman (1995).\n586 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides Another characteristic of organochlorines is their ubiquity \u2013 their residues occur in all organisms throughout\nthebiosphere.Thiswidespreadcontaminationoccursbecauseorganochlorinesenteraglobalcycleandbecome\nwidelydispersedinthebodiesofmigratingorganismsandintheatmospherebyevaporationandinwind-eroded\ndust. Residues of DDT are found even in organisms in Antarctica, far remote from areas where it was ever\nused. In one study in that far-southern region, the concentration of \u201ctotal DDT\u201d (almost all of which occur as\nthe metabolic residue, DDE) in the fat of skuas (a marine bird, Catharacta maccormicki) was 5 ppm (or 5 \u00b5g/\ng). Smaller residues (< 0.44 ppm) occurred in birds feeding lower in the food web, such as fulmar (Fulmarus\nglacialoides) and macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) (Norheim et al., 1982).\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 587 Although organochlorine residues are ubiquitous in the biosphere, much higher concentrations occur in\nanimalsthatliveclosetoareaswherethesechemicalshavebeenused,suchasNorthAmerica.Becausemarine\nmammals feed at or near the top of their food web and are long-lived, they can have extremely high residues\nof organochlorines. For example, harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in Atlantic Canada have had DDT\nresidues as high as 520 ppm in their fat (Edwards, 1975). High residues of organochlorines also occur in top-\npredatorbirds,especiallyraptors(suchaseagles,falcons,hawks,andowls).PriortothebanningofDDT,residues\naveraged12ppm(withamaximumof356ppm)inasampleof69baldeagles(Haliaeetusleucocephalus),upto\n460ppmamong11westerngrebes(Aechmophorusoccidentalis),andupto131ppmamong13herringgulls(Larus\nargentatus) (Edwards, 1975).\nIntenseexposurestoorganochlorinescausedimportantecologicaldamage,includingbirdpoisonings.During\nthe1950sand1960s,birdkillsresultedwhenDDTwassprayedinurbanareastokillthebeetlevectorsofDutch\nelmdisease,causedbyafungalpathogen(Ceratocyctisulmi)thatwasaccidentallyintroducedtoNorthAmerica\nfromEurope.Thefungusistransportedbetweentreesbybarkbeetles,whichcanbecontrolledtosomedegree\nbytheuseofinsecticide.Sprayingforthispurposewasintensive,andtypicallyinvolvedanapplicationof0.7-1.4\nkgofDDTpertree.Birdsfeedingoninvertebratesintreatedareaswereexposedtolethaldoses.Onestudyin\nNewHampshirefound117deadbirdsina6hasprayarea,andestimatedthat70%ofthebreedingrobins(Turdus\nmigratorius)hadbeenkilled(Wursteretal.,1965).Somuchavianmortalityoccurredinsprayedneighbourhoods\nthatbirdsongwasmarkedlyreduced\u2013hencethetitleofRachelCarson\u2019s1962book,SilentSpring(InDetail22.3).\nIn addition to acute poisoning caused by organochlorines in sprayed areas, more insidious damage was\noccurringoverlargeregions.Manyspeciesexperiencedlong-termchronictoxicity,evenwellawayfromsprayed\nareas.

Breeding populations of\nvarious raptors suffered large declines. Severely affected species included the peregrine falcon (Falco\nperegrinus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and golden eagle (Aquila\nchrysaetos)(seeCanadianFocus22.1).Inallcases,thesespecieswereexposedtoa\u201ccocktail\u201doforganochlorines,\nincluding the insecticides DDT, DDD (both are metabolized to DDE), aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor, as well\nas PCBs, a group of non-insecticidal compounds with many industrial uses. Researchers have investigated the\nrelative importance of these various organochlorines in causing the population declines of raptors. It appears\nthat DDT may have been the more important toxin to birds in North America, while cyclodienes (particularly\ndieldrin) were more influential in Britain (Cooper, 1991; Moriarty, 1999).\nDamage to raptors was mainly associated with chronic effects on their reproduction, rather than toxicity\ncaused to adults. Reproductive damage included the production of thin eggshells that would break under the\nweight of an incubating parent, high mortality of embryos and nestlings, and abnormal adult behaviour. The\nnumbers of fledged chicks declined, and that resulted in rapid population declines.\nSince the bans of DDT and other organochlorines in North America, their residues in wildlife have been\nprogressivelydecreasing.Datashowingthisdeclinehavebeenobtainedbyanalyzingeggsofherringgulls(Larus\nargentatus)breedingontheGreatLakes(Figure22.2).Althougheggsfromvariousplacesdifferintheirresidues\n(partlydependingonlocalsources),theyallexhibitlargedecreasesinDDEandPCB.Decreasesinresidueshave\nalso occurred in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus).\nFigure22.2.ChangesinOrganochlorineResiduesinBirdEggs.Eggsofherringgullhaveshowndecreasing\nresiduessincetheuseofDDT,PCBs,andotherpersistentorganochlorineswasbannedinNorthAmerica\n588 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides in the early 1970s.

Silent Spring Rachel Carson, an American biologist, wrote many scientific articles and\nseveralbooks,themostfamousofwhich,SilentSpring,waspublishedin1962.SilentSpringwasaimedat\napopularaudience,anditwasalivelyandcontroversialindictmentofpesticideuseasitwaspractised\natthetime,particularlytheuseofDDTandotherorganochlorineinsecticides.SilentSpringwaswritten\nto warn society about the known and potential dangers that these pesticides pose to wildlife, and also\nto people throughcontamination of their food. Silent Spring achievedthat objective and, in fact, was a\nliterary bombshell that caused an eruption of public awareness about pesticide issues.\nAlthough DDT and its organochlorine relatives were clearly useful in killing pests, Carson described\nhow they were also causing extensive mortality to non-pest arthropods, and also to birds, mammals,\nand other wildlife. She also warned that people were being widely exposed to organochlorines, with\nsignificant residues being found, for example, in the milk of nursing mothers. She noted, \u201cFor the first\ntimeinthehistoryoftheworld,everyhumanbeingisnowsubjectedtodangerouschemicals,fromthe\nmoment of conception until death.\u201d Although little was known about the subject at the time, Carson\nwarned that the chronic, low-level exposure of people to organochlorines was potentially dangerous.\nA best-seller, Silent Spring stirred up an enormous controversy about the effects of anthropogenic\nchemicalsintheenvironment.Companiesthatmanufacturedpesticidesmountedtheirowninformation\nand advertising programs. They attempted to discredit Carson by labelling her as an irresponsible\nagitator and by claiming that she did not represent the views of most scientists. In fact, some of\nthe technical details of Carson\u2019s analysis were later found to be incorrect, but this is not surprising\nconsideringtheincompleteunderstandingatthetimeaboutpesticidesandtheirenvironmentalimpacts.\nNevertheless, the essential thesis of Silent Spring was that organochlorine insecticides were widely\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 589 contaminatingorganismsandtheenvironment,werepersistent,andwerecausingextensivedamage.In\nlarge part, these assertions were correct.\nUnfortunately, Rachel Carson died an early death from cancer in 1964, just as the message of Silent\nSpring was becoming widely recognized. Today, Carson is known as one of the most influential\nenvironmentalists in history, a pioneer who deserves much of the credit for the birth of the\nenvironmentalmovementduringthemid-1960s.Likeallenvironmentalists,RachelCarsonpromotedan\nethic of human responsibility for taking care of the biosphere and its species.\nThe Case of Carbofuran\nImportant replacements for DDT and related organochlorines have been organophosphate and carbamate\ninsecticides. These poison insects and other arthropods by inhibiting a specific enzyme, acetylcholinesterase\n(AChE), which is critical in the transmission of nerve impulses. Vertebrates such as amphibians, fish, birds,\nand mammals are also sensitive to poisoning of their AChE system. In all of these animals, acute poisoning by\norganophosphate and carbamate insecticides causes tremors, convulsions, and ultimately death.\nCarbofuranisacarbamateinsecticidethatcanbeusedformanypurposesinagriculture.Oneformulationis\naliquidsuspensionthatcanbedilutedinwaterandthenbroadcast-sprayedagainstpestssuchasgrasshoppers\nandleafbeetles.Itisalsoavailableinagranularformulation,inwhichtheinsecticidecoatsparticlesofgritand\nis sown along with seeds to protect tender seedlings from insect damage. The granular formulation has been\ncommonly used when sowing canola and maize.\nUnfortunately,wildlifeisexposedtotoxicdosesofcarbofuranwheneitheroftheseformulationsisused.For\nexample, if not all of the carbofuran granules are buried in the planting furrows, they remain exposed on the\nsurface (Mineau, 1993). In one method of seeding, used for corn in Ontario, 15-31% of the granules remained\nexposed on the surface, or 515-1065 exposed granules per metre of furrow. Methods used to plant canola in\nwestern Canada often left about 5% of the granules on the surface. The exposed granules may be ingested by\nseed-eating birds, which require hard particles of that size as \u201cgrit\u201d for macerating hard-coated seeds in their\nmuscular gizzard. The carbofuran is extremely toxic: consumption of only 1-5 granules can kill a small bird.\nRaptors and mammals are secondarily poisoned if they scavenge the dead bodies.\nInaddition,fieldstreatedwithcarbofuranmaybecomefloodedduringthespringandautumn,andthesurface\nwater may then contain large residues of the insecticide. This is particularly the case if the soil and water are\nacidic, which greatly reduces the rate of breakdown of carbofuran into less toxic chemicals.\nOf all the pesticides used recently in agriculture, carbofuran has probably caused the most non-target\nmortality of birds and other wild animals. Even though there is no systematic program for reporting bird kills\ncausedbypesticideuseinCanadaortheUnitedStates,alargenumberoftoxicincidentsweredocumentedfor\ncarbofuran (Mineau, 1993), a few of which were:\n\u2022 More than 2,000 Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus), a seed-eating finch, were killed after eating\ncarbofuran granules in a freshly planted canola field in Saskatchewan in May 1984\n\u2022 About 1,200 birds, mostly savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), were killed in by granular\ncarbofuran in turnip and radish fields in British Columbia in September 1986\n\u2022 More than 1,000 green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis) were killed within hours of landing in a flooded\nturnip field in British Columbia in the autumn of 1975\n\u2022 At least 50 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and pintails (A. acuta) were poisoned in a flooded field in British\nColumbia in December 1973\n590 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides \u2022 2,450 dead widgeon (Mareca americana) found one day after spraying of an alfalfa field in California in\nMarch 1974\nThese examples are only a small fraction of the known bird kills caused by the routine use of carbofuran\nin agriculture. There are also, of course, larger numbers of unreported incidents.

Organochlorines and the Peregrine Falcon The most famous avian victim of\norganochlorineswastheperegrinefalcon,whosepopulationdeclineswerefirstnoticedintheearly1950s\nin North America and Western Europe (Peakall, 1990; Freedman, 1995). By 1970, peregrines in eastern\nNorth America (the subspecies Falco peregrinus anatum) had stopped reproducing and were critically\nendangered.Atthesametime,thetundriussubspeciesoftheArcticwasrapidlydeclining.Onlythepealei\nsubspeciesthatbreedsonislandsoffBritishColumbiaandAlaskahadnormalreproductionsuccessand\na stable population.\nThe pealei falcons do not migrate. Moreover, they live in a region where pesticides are not used\nand mainly feed on non-migratory seabirds. In contrast, anatum peregrines breed in a region where\norganochlorines were widely used, and they fed on contaminated prey. The tundrius falcons breed in\na northern wilderness where pesticides are not used, but they winter in Central and South America\nwhere their food was contaminated by organochlorines, as was their prey of migratory waterfowl and\nshorebirdsintheArctic.Studiesbywildlifetoxicologistsfoundthatpopulationsofperegrinefalconswith\nhigh organochlorine residues were laying thin-shelled eggs and suffering other kinds of reproductive\nimpairment. This damage was causing their populations to collapse. By 1975, the anatum birds had\nbecomeextirpatedineasternNorthAmerica,whilethearctictundriusbirdshaddeclinedtoonlyabout\n450 pairs from historical levels of more than 5-thousand pairs.\nFortunately,manycountries(includingCanada,theUnitedStates,andmostotherdevelopednations)\nbanned further use of DDT and most other organochlorines in the 1970s. This resulted in a marked\ndecrease in residues in the food of peregrines and other raptors, which allowed their populations\nto stabilize or recover. By 1985, arctic peregrines were increasing in abundance, and small breeding\npopulations had re-established in more southern regions.\nTherecoverywasgreatlyenhancedbyaprogram(fundedinCanadabytheCanadianWildlifeService)\nthatbredperegrinesincaptivitytoprovideyoungbirdsforreleaseintotheformerrangeoftheanatum\nsubspecies. Several thousand young peregrines were released in Canada and the U.S., and many of the\nbirds survived and bred.

Because of the\nrisk of ecological damage, monocrotophos has been banned in the United States and was never registered for\nuse in Canada. In Argentina, however, the insecticide could be legally used. Swainson\u2019s hawks were exposed\n592 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides to lethal doses of monocrotophos when they fluttered behind spray tractors to feed on grasshoppers flushed\nby the machinery, and also when they later fed on insecticide-contaminated prey. Argentina has since banned\nmonocrotophos, replacing its applications with pyrethroids.\nNeonicotinoids\nPerhaps the most contentious pesticide-related issue of recent years (this was written in 2015) is the use of\nneonicotinoid insecticides agriculture (Jeschke et al., 2011; Mineau and Palmer, 2013; van der Sluijs et al, 2014).\nTheseareaclassofsyntheticAChE-inhibitinginsecticidesthatarechemicallysimilartonicotine,thekeyalkaloid\nin tobacco.

In 2013, a study by the European Food Safety Authority\nreported an unacceptably high risk to honeybees from many uses of neonics, and in 2014 a critical integrated\nstudy was published (van der Sluijs et al, 2014).

Freedman.\nInsecticide Spraying\nAfter the Second World War, an early use of DDT was against spruce budworm. In 1953 alone, 804-thousand\nhectares of forest were sprayed in Quebec and New Brunswick. By 1968, when further use of DDT for this\npurposewasbanned,atotalof15-million hahadbeensprayedatleastonce(EnnisandCaldwell,1991).InNew\nBrunswick alone, 5.75-million kilograms of DDT were sprayed onto budworm-infested forest (Armstrong, 1985).\nAfterthefurtheruseofDDTwasbannedin1968,theinsecticidesusedwerefenitrothionandphosphamidon,\nboth organophosphates, and aminocarb, a carbamate. Of these, fenitrothion was used most widely. By 1985,\nphosphamidon had been sprayed on 8.1-million hectares, aminocarb on 19-million ha, and fenitrothion on\n64-millionha(thesearesumsofannualsprayedareas,withmosttreatedstandsreceivingtwospraysperyear;\nEnnisandCaldwell,1991).NewBrunswickhadthebiggestsprayprogramto\u201cprotect\u201dtheforestresourceagainst\nbudworm \u2013 up to 1985, a cumulative total of 69-million ha was treated, compared to 37-million ha in Quebec,\n10-millionhainMaine,and1.7-millionhainNewfoundland.ThemostextensivesprayinginNewBrunswickwas\nin 1976, when 4.2-million hectares were treated. Afterward, spraying decreased to less than 1-million ha after\n1985, to less than 0.5-million ha after 1990, and to zero after 1993 due to collapse of the budworm outbreak.\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 597 During the late 1980s, a biological insecticide based on the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki\n(abbreviated B.t.) began to displace the synthetic pesticides in budworm spraying. B.t. is toxic to most\nlepidopterans(mothsandbutterflies)andtosomeotherinsects,includingblackfliesandmosquitoes.Otherwise,\nthis insecticide causes little non-target damage. Initially, budworm control using B.t. was variable in\neffectiveness,andthecostwashighcomparedwithfenitrothion.Sincethen,however,theeffectivenessandcost\nof spraying B.t. have improved. This, along with concern about ecological damage caused by fenitrothion, has\nresulted in B.t. becoming the insecticide of choice in spray programs against budworm.\nNon-Target Damage\nThesyntheticinsecticidesusedagainstbudwormcausedagreatdealofnon-targetmortality.Typicalsprayrates\nand toxicities for the insecticides are summarized in Table 22.4.

One study estimated that a typical fenitrothion spray killed as many as 7.5-million individuals of\nhundreds of species of arthropods per hectare, although more than 90% of the dead biomass was budworm\n(Varty, 1975). Overall, a typical spray with fenitrothion caused a short-term decrease in arthropod biomass of\n35%,andadecreaseintotalindividualsof50%(AgricultureCanada,1993).However,studiesfoundthatthenon-\ntargetdamagetoarthropodswastemporaryandlong-termdecreasesinabundancewerenotdetectable(Varty,\n1975; Millikin, 1990). The post-spray recovery was due to recolonization from non-sprayed forest, along with\nincreases by arthropods that survived the spraying.\nBirdpopulationsareunusuallyabundantininfestedforestbecausebudwormisaplentifulandnutritiousfood\nfor insect-eating animals. In fact, some birds are uncommon except in budworm-infestedforest.

In essence, insectivorous birds are satiated by the extremely abundant food resource\nandareincapableofcontrollingthehugepopulationoflarvae.Predationbybirdsmay,however,beimportantin\nreducing less-abundant budworm populations, and may help to lengthen the interval between outbreaks.\nBecausebirdsareabundantinabudworm-infestedforest,theyareexposedtoanyinsecticidethatmightbe\nsprayed.Eventhoughsomeoftheinsecticidesusedagainstbudwormareextremelytoxictobirds,ithasproved\ndifficulttodocumentactualdamagetoavianpopulationsbyspraying.First,itisextremelydifficulttofinddead\nordyingbirdsinforesthabitatbecausetheyoccurinasmalldensityandarequicklyscavengedbyotheranimals.\nEven with all the insecticide spraying in New Brunswick between 1965 and 1987, the Canadian Wildlife Service\nhas records of only 125 dead birds (Busby et al., 1989), which is a gross underestimate of the actual mortality.\nIn addition, it is difficult to detect population changes resulting from mortality of birds in forest. A census\nof forest birds is taken by mapping the locations from which male birds sing; this information is then used to\ndetermine the boundaries of their territories. The song censuses are conducted in the spring over a period\nof four to six weeks. During that time, bird populations are dynamic because migratory species are returning\nfrom their wintering grounds, and they arrive at different times. Moreover, if a territory-holding bird is killed\nby an insecticide spray, it may be quickly replaced from a \u201csurplus\u201d of non-breeding individuals that wander\nextensively, searching for suitable habitat that is not occupied by another of their species. Because of the\ntemporalvariationsinbirdabundanceandtherapidreplacementofkilledindividuals,itisdifficulttodocument\npopulation changes caused by insecticide spraying.\nPhosphamidon is very poisonous to birds (Table 22.4), and its use likely caused severe mortality of some\nspecies.Onestudysuggestedthatasmanyas376-thousandruby-crownedkingletswerekilledinNewBrunswick\nduringthe1975sprayseason,mostlybyphosphamidon(PearceandPeakall,1977).Becausetheyforagehighinthe\ncanopy,kingletsareparticularlyvulnerabletoinsecticideexposureduringanaerialspray.Thepresumeddamage\nto birds was the key reason why phosphamidon was banned for use against budworm after 1975.\nFenitrothion is less poisonous to birds, but it nevertheless has a small margin of toxicological safety during\noperationalsprays.Whileanormalapplicationappearstocauselittleavianmortality,exposuretoadoublespray,\nas commonly occurs with overlapping spray swaths, can be lethal. Studies of white-throated sparrows found\nmuch greater mortality and behavioural impairment after a double application of fenitrothion, compared with\nthe normal spray rate (Busby et al., 1989).\nTable22.5showstheeffectsofafenitrothionsprayonbirds.Wheninterpretingthesecensusdata,thetrends\nin the sprayed habitat should be compared with those of non-sprayed forest.

The data show the effects of forest spraying\nwithfenitrothiononbreedingbirdsintheGasp\u00e9regionofQuebec.Theoperationalsprayingprocedure\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 599 is to treat stands twice, about one week apart. In this study, birds were censused for five days before\nspraying, then for seven days after the initial spray on May 21, 1976, and again for five days after\nthe second spray on May 30. The sprayed stand (\u201cSpr\u201d) was treated with fenitrothion at 0.56 kg/\nha, while the unsprayed reference stand (\u201cRef\u201d) monitors changes that are unrelated to spraying.

Table 22.6 illustrates the effects of this habitat change on birds. Defoliation by budworm\ncaused relatively little damage to Stand A, so the decreased population of some birds (such as solitary vireo\nand many warblers) was caused by a decrease in the availability of food because the outbreak had collapsed\nandbudwormisacriticalresource.Incontrast,StandBwasintenselydamagedbybudworm,withlargehabitat\nchanges that included many dead trees and a lush growth of understorey plants. In this stand, the decreased\nabundanceofsomebirds(suchassolitaryvireo,Tennesseewarbler,black-throatedgreenwarbler,blackburnian\nwarbler, and bay-breasted warbler) resulted from changes in vegetation as well as a reduced availability of\nlarvaeasfood.Note,inaddition,thatsomebirds(suchasleastflycatcher,magnoliawarbler,andwhite-throated\nsparrow) do well in recently disturbed stands: they benefit from the habitat associated with budworm damage.\nTable 22.6. Abundance of Birds During and After a Spruce Budworm Outbreak. The data are from a\nstudy in New Brunswick. Stand A was monitored for eight years during an infestation (1952-1959), and\nthen for six post-outbreak years (to 1965). However, Stand A suffered little damage to its trees \u2013 the\naverage age of balsam fir trees was 120 years in both sampling periods. Stand B was censused for\nfive infestation years (1955-1959) and for five post-outbreak years (to 1964). Stand B suffered intense\ndamage to its trees \u2013 the fir averaged older than 80 years when the infestation began, but < 10 years\nold afterward because so many mature trees had died. The bird data are in numbers per 40 hectares.\n600 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides Only prominent species are listed. Source: Data from Gage and Miller (1978).\nOverall, it appears that the demonstrated ecological effects of post-DDT spray programs against spruce\nbudworm were relatively short in duration and moderate in intensity (with the exception of the effects of\nphosphamidon on birds). Residues of such chemicals as fenitrothion and aminocarb are not long lived, and no\nmagnification occurs in the food web. Although substantial mortality was caused to many non-target species,\nlong-term decreases in their populations have not been documented (bearing in mind that such effects are\nhard to demonstrate, particularly at larger spatial scales). For example, although many individual birds have\nundoubtedly been poisoned by insecticide toxicity, measurable damage to their populations has not been\ndemonstrated.\nSpray Policies\nSprayinginsecticideonforestinfestedbysprucebudwormhaseconomicbenefitsthatareassociatedwiththe\nprotectionofconifertrees,animportantnaturalresource.Asaresult,decisionmakersandregulatorsinsome\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 601 provinceshaveconsideredsprayprogramstobenecessary.Manyenvironmentalists,however,cometodifferent\nconclusionsaboutthebenefitsandcostsofspraying,becausetheyvaluateecologicaldamagemorehighlythan\ndoresourcemanagersandregulators.Ecologistsandenvironmentalactivistsarenot,however,thepeoplewho\nmakethedecisionsaboutundertakinginsecticidesprayprogramstomanagepopulationsofbudwormorother\npests.\nAfter 1986, fenitrothion was the only synthetic insecticide used against budworm. In 1993, a risk assessment\nof this use (Pauli et al., 1993) concluded that many of its ecotoxicological damages are significant: \u201cThe weight\nof evidence accumulated with respect to the identified and potential negative impacts caused by the forestry use\nof fenitrothion on non-target fauna and their potential ecological implications, supports the conclusion that the\nlarge-scalesprayingoffenitrothionforforestpestcontrol,ascurrentlypractisedoperationally,isenvironmentally\nunacceptable.\u201d\nPartly because of the strong conclusions of that risk assessment, the registration of fenitrothion for use in\nbudworm spray programs in Canada was withdrawn in 1995. This action left B.t., a bacterial insecticide that\ncauses little non-target damage, as the major insecticide available for spraying against this forest pest.\nAlternatives to Insecticide\nIn addition to ecotoxicity caused by any insecticide, spray programs against budworm have other drawbacks\nfrom a forest-management perspective. Within limits, treating infested stands with insecticide maintains fir-\nspruce forest \u201calive and green\u201d and therefore available as a resource for the economically important forest\nindustry. However, spraying also maintains good habitat for budworm, and so may prolong its outbreaks.\nAgencies that spray insecticide can become \u201clocked\u201d into this pest-management tactic and must continue to\nspray if the forest resource is to be maintained in an economically viable condition. In the absence of an\nalternative control practice, spraying may be perceived to be the best available short-term tactic. Clearly,\nhowever, spray programs over extensive areas are not desirable.\nAn alternative to spraying insecticides may be the use of silvicultural practices that are aimed at reducing\nthe vulnerability of stands to budworm infestation. For example, relatively tolerant species such as black\nspruce might be planted extensively. Alternatively, the landscape could be structured so that the total area of\nmature but vulnerable forest is kept small. If the landscape mosaic was dominated by less vulnerable stands\nthat could be harvested by industry at about the rate at which the trees mature, a smaller area would be\nvulnerable to budworm infestation. It must be recognized, however, that such actions would represent a huge\nintensification of forest management and would cause enormous changes in the ecological character of the\nlandscape.Littleisknownaboutthelong-termeconomicviabilityorecologicalconsequencesofsuchchanges\nin forest-management strategy.\nFurther research into alternative methods of budworm control may yield novel methods that are effective.\nSome promise has been demonstrated by the release of large numbers of tiny Trichogramma wasps that are\nparasitesofbudworm,bytheuseofsynthetichormonesthatdisruptmoultingormatingofthebudworm,and\nby several other innovative biotechnologies.

The dominance of the site by \u201cundesirable\u201d plants inhibits the growth of commercially\ndesired conifers, and provides an economic justification for a weed-management treatment.\nFigure 22.4. Dominant Plants in Disturbed Forest. The vegetation was surveyed in four clear-cuts of\nconifer forest in Nova Scotia that were 4-6 years old. The data represent the range of average plant\ncoveramongthefoursites,expressedasthepercentageofgroundthatisobscuredbyfoliage.Because\nof overlap, cover values can exceed 100%. Source: Data from Freedman (1995).\nThe effects of competing plants on conifer productivity are illustrated by a study of a site in New Brunswick\nthat had been treated with herbicides 28 years previously (MacLean and Morgan, 1983).

The study consequently found, 28 years after the herbicide treatment, that the\nbiomass of balsam fir on the sprayed plots was about three-times larger than on an adjacent unsprayed plot.\nFrom the forestry perspective, this means that the herbicide treatment allowed a conifer-dominated stand to\ndevelop more quickly, shortening the time to the next harvest.\n604 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides Toxicological and Ecological Effects\nThesilviculturalobjectiveofherbicidesprayingistomanagevegetationbychangingitscharacter.Aherbicide\ntreatment in forestry reduces the abundance of competing vegetation, but it rapidly recovers. In essence, a\nherbicidetreatmentreturnsthepost-harvestregeneration(usuallypost-clear-cutting)toanearliersuccessional\nstage, while for several years releasing small conifer plants from some effects of competition. The changes in\nvegetation are illustrated by a study in Nova Scotia, in which a substantial recovery occurred within only one\ngrowing season after a herbicide treatment (Figure 22.5). The recovery involved species whose seeds colonize\nsprayed sites, as well as plants that were not killed by the herbicide. This study found that no species were\neliminated from sprayed clear-cuts, although large differences occurred in their relative abundance between\nsprayedandreference(unsprayed)plots.Thisisbecausespeciesvaryinsusceptibilitytoherbicidesandintheir\nability to recover from a disturbance.\nFigure 22.5.

Source: Data from Freedman et al. (1993).\nCompared with many insecticides, herbicides used in forestry (such as 2,4,5-T, 2,4-D, and glyphosate) are not\nvery toxic to animals (see Table 22.2). At exposures encountered by animals during typical forestry uses, the\ndirecttoxicologicalrisksareprobablyunimportant.Thisisparticularlytrueofglyphosate,themostcommonly\nused herbicide.\nGlyphosateisextremelytoxictomostplants,actingbyblockingthesynthesisofseveralessentialaminoacids.\nAllplantsandsomemicroorganismsusethismetabolicpathway,butanimalsobtaintheseaminoacidsintheir\nfood. Consequently, glyphosate is non-toxic to animals (see Tables 15.2 and 22.2).\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 605 Nevertheless, glyphosate causes large changes to occur in habitat because it affects the productivity and\nbiomass of plants. Birds and other animals can be affected by a decreased availability of berries and other\nplant foods.

Freedman.\nA study in Nova Scotia found only small changes in the abundance of birds that were breeding on clear-cuts\ntreated with glyphosate (Table 22.7). Althoughthe avian population decreased between the pre-spray and first\npost-spray years, this also occurred on the reference plot, suggesting it was caused by a factor unrelated to\ntheherbicidetreatment,suchasbadweather.Inthesecondyearafterspraying,theabundanceofbirdsonthe\nsprayedplotswassimilartothefirstpost-sprayyear,whileontheunsprayedplotitincreasedtoaboutthepre-\nspray value.\nTable 22.7.

On the reference plot, song sparrow and Lincoln\u2019s sparrow declined during the\ncourse of the study, whereas on the sprayed plots they were most abundant in the second and fourth years\nafter spraying.

The quantity of browse, although initially reduced\nbyherbicidespraying,isoftenincreasedinthemedium-termthroughtheregenerationofshrubs.Forexample,\nstudiesinMainefoundthatseveralyearsafterspraying,theavailabilityofbrowsewasgreaterontreatedclear-\ncuts, partly because the height of the shrub canopy was lower, which gave white-tailed deer easier access to\nthisfood(Newtonetal.,1989).Thisisnotalwaysthecase,however,andsomestudieshaveshownthatherbicide\nspraying may decrease the habitat quality for deer.\nOverall, field research suggests that herbicide use in forestry has relatively small effects on birds and other\nwildlifethatutilizeclear-cutsashabitat.Otherdisturbancesassociatedwithforestrycausemuchlargereffects\non wildlife, particularly clear-cutting and the conversion of the natural forest into a plantation (see Chapter 23).\nThe hazards to people from herbicide use in forestry have also been scrutinized.

It must be remembered,\nhowever, that scientists have not achieved a full consensus on these issues. Partly for this reason, the use of\npesticides in forestry and for other purposes continues to be highly controversial.\nIntegrated Pest Management\nPesticides are commonly used in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. It is clear from this fact that most\npoliticians, bureaucrats, and resource managers \u2013 and many scientists \u2013 have decided that the environmental\n\u201ccosts\u201dassociatedwiththeuseofpesticidesare\u201cacceptable\u201dinviewofeconomicbenefitsthatareachieved.It\nisdebatable,however,whetherrelianceonpesticideuseisdesirableoverthelongterm.Thisisparticularlytrue\nforthosepesticidesthataretoxictoabroadspectrumoforganisms.Mostpeoplewouldpreferthatlessreliance\nbe placed on such non-specific methods of pest control.\nA much preferable approach is known as integrated pest management (IPM), which employs an array of\ncomplementary tactics toward achieving pest control, with the aim of there being fewer environmental and\nhealth risks. Elements of an IPM system can include the following:\n\u2022 use of natural predators, parasites, and other biological agents that can help to control a pest, while\ncausing few non-target damages\n\u2022 use of crop varieties that are resistant to pests\n\u2022 management of habitat to make it less suitable for pests\n\u2022 careful monitoring of pest abundance, so control measures are undertaken only when necessary\n\u2022 use of pesticides, but only if required as a component of an IPM strategy\nAsuccessfulIPMprogramcangreatlyreduce,butnotnecessarilyeliminate,relianceonpesticides.Forexample,\nfor many years the cultivation of cotton in the southern United States relied on the intensive application of\ninsecticidesagainstpestssuchasthebollweevil.WidespreaduseofanIPMsystemtocontrolthisinsectinTexas\ncottonfields reduced insecticide use from 8.8 million kilogram in 1964 to 1.05 million kilogram in 1976 (Bottrell\nand Smith, 1982). Nevertheless, insecticide use against this pest remained necessary.\nWhereverpossible,IPMsystemsutilizecontrolmethodsthatareasspecificaspossibletothepestsothatnon-\ntargetdamagecanbeavoidedorgreatlyreduced.Someofthebestexamplesofsuchspecificmethodsinvolve\nbiologicalcontrol(theuseofabiologicalagent).Theusefulnessofbiologicalcontrolcanbeillustratedwiththe\nfollowing successful controls of introduced agricultural pests (Freedman, 1995):\n\u2022 The cottony-cushion scale (Icyera purchasi) is a sap-sucking insect that was accidentally introduced to the\nUnited States, where it became a threat to citrus agriculture. Research in its native Australia discovered\nthat the pest was naturally controlled by certain insect predators and parasites. In 1888, two of its\npredators, a lady beetle and a parasitic fly, were introduced to California. This allowed almost total control\nover this potentially disastrous pest. Unfortunately, this biological control was disrupted when DDT and\nother broad-spectrum insecticides were used to deal with other orchard pests beginning in the late 1940s.\n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a common weed, is toxic to cattle. It became a serious pest in\npastures after it was introduced from Europe. In 1943, two leaf beetles that feed on this plant were released\nto North America, and this pest is no longer an important problem.\n\u2022 The prickly pear cactus (Opuntia stricta) was imported to Australia from North America and grown as an\n608 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides ornamental plant and a \u201cliving fence.\u201d It escaped and became a serious weed in rangelands. This pest was\ncontrolled by the introduction of one of its herbivores, a moth whose larvae feed on the cactus.\n\u2022 Ragwort (Senecio jacobea) is a Eurasian plant that has been introduced to the Americas and Australia. It\nbecame an important weed in rangeland because it crowds out native plants and is toxic to cattle. Several\nof its Eurasian herbivores are now being used to control its abundance, including the cinnabar moth,\nragwort flea beetle, and ragwort seed fly.\n\u2022 The screw-worm fly (Callitroga hominivorax) causes damage to cattle when its larvae feed on open wounds.\nThis pest has been controlled in some areas through the release of large numbers of male flies that were\nreared in laboratories and sterilized by irradiation. Because the female flies mate only once, copulation with\na sterile male results in unsuccessful reproduction. If this happens to enough females, the abundance of the\npest decreases to an acceptable level.\nUnfortunately, biological control may not be suitable for all pest problems, and in fact it has not succeeded in\nmostcasesinwhichithasbeenattempted.Thelistoffailuresincludesforestpestssuchassprucebudwormand\ngypsymoth.Researchershaveinvestigatedthepotentialforcontrollingbudwormusingpest-specificbacteria,\nviruses,andotheragentsofdiseases,waspsthatparasitizeandkilllarvae,andsexanddevelopmentalhormones\ntodisruptmatingandgrowth.Someofthebiologicalcontrolmethodshaveshownpromise,buttheydonotyet\nachieve a consistent kill of budworm and are relatively expensive. For these reasons, they are not considered\nready for routine use against this important pest.\nThe only viable alternative to the broadcast spraying of synthetic insecticides to control budworm is an\ninsecticidebasedonthebacteriumB.t.(examinedearlier).Researchintootherbiologicalcontrolscontinues,and\nsomemayyetprovesuccessfulandwouldallowmanagerstodevelopaneffectiveIPMsystemthatdoesnotrely\non broadcast spraying of insecticides, even relatively specific ones such as B.t.\nAtthepresenttime,however,itappearsthatsocietywillcontinuetorelyheavilyonpesticideuseinintensively\nmanaged systems in agriculture and forestry. This will happen even though the intensive systems cause\necological damage (partly because this damage is not fully accounted for as an economic \u201ccost\u201d).\nItisimportantthatadditionalresearchisundertakentodevelopviablemethodsofbiologicalcontrolandother\nelements of IPM systems. This is necessary if the present reliance on the pesticide treadmill is to be replaced\nwithless-damagingmethodsofpestmanagement.Suchachangewoulddeliversubstantialbenefitstosociety,\nbecause the agricultural and forestry systems that we require for sustenance could be managed on a more\necologicallysustainablebasis.Inpart,thiswillrequirethatmoreattentionbedirectedtotheecologicaldamage\ncaused by the intensive use of pesticides.\nBecause of this damage, it is highly desirable that non-pesticidal alternatives to pest control are discovered\nasquicklyaspossible.Untilthishappens,pesticideuseshouldbereducedtothelowestlevelsthatcontinueto\neffectivelycontrolthepests.SomeenvironmentalistshavearguedthatpesticideuseinNorthAmericaismuch\ngreaterthannecessaryandthatitcouldbedecreasedwithoutcausingasignificantadverseeffectoncropyields.\nInfact,theEuropeanUnion hasalreadypassedlegislationrequiringthatagriculturalpesticide usebereduced\nby half, and many pesticides have been banned. Serious consideration should also be given to such actions in\nCanada.\nCanadian Focus 22.2 Municipal Bans on Pesticide Use Most Canadian municipalities have banned the\nroutineuseofpesticidestomanagelawnsandgardens.Thiswasdoneinresponsetoconcernsaboutthe\nexposure of humans and pets to pesticide residues in the urban environment. Because most pesticide\nuseinhorticultureisessentiallyforcosmeticpurposes,andalternativepest-managementpracticesare\navailable,itisbelievedthatnosubstantialeconomicdetrimentwouldbesufferedfromthepesticidebans.\nIn 1991, the town of Hudson, Quebec, passed the first bylaw to regulate horticultural pesticide use.\nChapter 22 ~ Pesticides | 609 Opponents of that law included lawn-care companies and pesticide manufacturers, and they were\nsuccessfulinhavingitstruckdownbytheQuebecCourtofAppeal.In2000,however,theSupremeCourt\nofCanadareversedthatdecisionandmadeitlegalformunicipalitiestoregulatepesticideuseonlands\nwithintheirjurisdiction.Sincethen,manyadditionalmunicipalitieshavebannedtheuseofpesticidesfor\ncosmetic horticultural purposes.\nIn 2000, the Halifax Regional Municipality enacted a bylaw that prohibits the use of horticultural\npesticideswithin50mofanyparkorplayground,daycarecentre,senior-citizenresidence,publicschool,\nuniversity,church,orhospital.Intheremainingplaceswherepesticidescouldstillbeused,homeowners\nwantingtousethemmustapplyforapermit,andifitisgranted,theymustpostaprominentsignforone\ndaybeforeandfourdaysaftertheapplication.Inatypicalyear,severalhundredpermitapplicationsare\nreceived,mostofwhichareforuseagainstchinchbugs(Blissusleucopterus)inlawns.Almostallofthe\napplications are made by lawn-care companies on behalf of their clients, and about half are approved.\nTheHalifaxbylawiscontroversial,andithasbeenresistedbylawn-carecompanies,somegardeners,and\notherinterests.Paradoxically,aweaknessintheHalifaxbylawisthatitdoesnotbanthesaleofpesticides\n\u2013 only most of their uses. Because pesticides can be so easily obtained, compliance with the bylaw is\nsubstantiallyvoluntary,andnoonehaseverbeenchargedwithviolatingit.Inspiteofthisweakness,the\nbylaw has been widely applauded as a step forward in the broader environmental sense.\nIn 2003, the council of Toronto, the largest city in Canada, passed a pesticide bylaw and in so doing\ngreatly bolstered country-wide efforts across our country. In 2009, Ontario enacted a province-wide\nban on the sale and use of pesticides for cosmetic purposes. These and ongoing actions to restrict\nthe unnecessary use of pesticides have resulted from concerted actions of citizens and appropriate\ngovernmental responses, and they are an environmental \u201csuccess story\u201d.\nConclusions\nPesticides are a wide range of substances that are used to gain an advantage over species that cause diseases\norarepestsinagriculture,forestry,orhorticulture.However,theuseofmanypesticidescarriesrisksofcausing\ndamagetohumanhealthortheenvironment.Pesticideshavebecomeanintegratedcomponentofmostofthe\nintensive systems by which foods and other crops are grown, and there are not yet good replacements for\nall of their uses. For this reason, the use of pesticides will continue into the foreseeable future. Nevertheless,\nit is important that more research be done to find effective ways of reducing the dependence on pesticides,\nespecially on integrated pest-management systems and on means of biological control. In the meantime, it is\nimportantthatpesticideusebereducedtothelowestamountspossibleandthatthemostdamagingchemicals\nare withdrawn from legal use.\nQuestions for Review\n1. Classify pesticides according to their intended targets and also by their major chemical groups.\n2. What is a \u201cpest\u201d? Why do people consider it necessary to manage their abundance in agriculture,\nhorticulture, forestry, and public health?\n3. What characteristics of organochlorines have caused them to become global contaminants? Why do they\n610 | Chapter 22 ~ Pesticides pose special toxicological risks to top predators?\n4. In view of the fact that spruce budworm is a native insect, why is the damage it causes to conifer forest\nconsidered to be a problem?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Identify and compare the benefits and environmental risks associated with pesticide use in one of\nagriculture, horticulture, or forestry.\n2. Are there effective alternatives to the continued use of pesticides? Consider the roles of integrated pest\nmanagement, biological controls, and other options.\n3. For many common uses of pesticides, there are alternative ways of managing the targeted pest. For\nexample, weeds in a lawn can be controlled by digging them out, rather than by using a herbicide. Pest\nrodents could be trapped instead of being killed with a rodenticide. What do you think should be the key\nconsiderations when deciding whether to use pesticides or alternative means of control?\n4. Some people believe that the use of pesticides should be allowed only in extreme cases, for example, to\nsave human lives or to prevent a food catastrophe. Most pesticide use, however, is more routine than this.\nWhat do you think about this issue? Should it be made more difficult for people to use pesticides? Or\nshould farmers and other potential users have freedom to make their own choices about pesticide use?\nExploring Issues\n1. A large corporation is seeking permission from the government to market a new insecticide in Canada. You\nare a wildlife biologist and have been asked to recommend studies to identify whether unacceptable\ndamages would be caused to animals, plants, or ecosystems by the new insecticide. How would you design\nsuch a study? What specific questions would you want to answer?\n2. You are an environmental scientist and have been asked to provide expert advice about a proposed new\nmunicipal bylaw regulating the cosmetic use of pesticides in horticulture. The bylaw itself could be similar\nto the one used in Halifax, as described in Canadian Focus 22.2. From the environmental perspective, what\nwould you consider to be the benefits and problems with the proposed bylaw?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nAgriculture Canada. 1993.

Forest science guides these activities by providing an understanding of the\nenvironmentalfactorsthataffecttheproductivityoftrees.Theprimarygoalofcommercialforestryistoprovide\nsustainable harvests of tree biomass that can be used to manufacture lumber, paper, and other industrial\nproducts,orasasourceofbio-energy.Secondarygoalsarerelatedtothemanagementofhuntedanimals(such\nasdeerandfish)onforestlandscapes,andsometimesthedesignationofcertainareasasprotected(whereno\ntimber harvesting occurs).\nForestry is an important economic sector in many countries. This is the case in Canada, where a large\nindustrialenterprisedependsonacontinuoussupplyoftreebiomassfortheproductionofproductsthathavea\ngreat economic value ($34 billion in 2013; see Chapter 14 for forestry-related economics).\nOfcourse,toachievetheseeconomicbenefits,treesmustbeharvestedfromextensiveareasofmatureforest.\nInCanada,clear-cuttingisthemostcommonlyusedmethodofforestharvesting\u2013thismethodremovesallof\nthe economically useful trees on a site at the same time. Clear-cutting accounts for about 90% of the annual\ntimber harvest.\nHowever,clear-cuttingisnotthesameasdeforestation.Deforestationinvolvesthepermanentconversionof\naforestintosomeotherkindofecosystem,suchasanagriculturalorurbanizedland-use.InCanadaandmost\notherdevelopedcountries, industrial clear-cuttingisgenerallyfollowedbytheregenerationofanother forest.\nIn fact, it is common practice to manage the post-harvest succession to speed up the rate of regeneration of\ntrees. This allows the next harvest to be made after a relatively short time, so more profit can be made. (This\nperiod of time is known as a harvest rotation.) In this sense, forestry as it is usually practised does not result\ninanetdeforestation,andifappropriatelymanagedtheforestresourceisnotdepleted.Eventhoughhundreds\nofthousandsofhectaresareharvestedeachyearinCanada(638-thousandhain2013),thenetdeforestationis\nessentially zero (Table 14.11).\nTimber harvesting can be viewed as a disturbance of the forest ecosystem, followed by regeneration.\nAdditional disturbances are associated with silvicultural activities, such as preparing the site for planting,\n616 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry thinningdensestands,andapplyingherbicideorinsecticidetodealwithpestproblems.Silviculture,thebranch\nofforestrythatinvolvestendingandgrowingforests,ispractisedoveranextensiveareainCanada.Forinstance,\nabout67%oftheareaharvested(in2012)isplantedtotreeseedlings(theother33%regeneratesnaturally.)Some\nplanted areas are managed intensively to develop a plantation, which is an anthropogenic forest, but one that\nlacks many of the ecological and aesthetic values of natural forest.\nInthischapterweexaminesomeoftheecologicaleffectsoftimberharvesting andsilviculture,withafocus\non site quality, hunted animals, and biodiversity. Additional effects of forestry are examined in other chapters:\npesticide spraying in Chapter 22, implications for carbon storage in Chapter 17, and tropical deforestation and\nglobal biodiversity in Chapter 26.\nForest Harvesting and Site Capability\nIn Chapter 14, we defined site capability (or site quality) as the potential of land to sustain the productivity of\nagriculturalcrops. This is also relevanttoforestry,in terms oftheabilityofland tosustain theproductivityof\ntrees. Site capability is a complex attribute that involves the amounts of nutrients and organic matter in soil,\ntheavailabilityofmoisture,andotherfactorsaffectingplantgrowth.Thesefactorsareinfluencedbysoiltype,\nclimate, drainage, rate of nutrient cycling, and the kinds of plant and microbial communities that are present.\nThe ability of soil to supply plants with nutrients is a critical aspect of site capability. In large part, this\necological function depends on the nutrient capital of a site, which is the amount of nutrients present in the\nsoil,livingvegetation,anddeadorganicmatter.Whentreesareharvested,thenutrientsintheirbiomassarealso\nremoved, which can deplete the nutrient capital of the site.\nA stand of forest may be harvested using a variety of methods, which vary in the amount of biomass and\nnutrients that are removed from the site. A selection harvest is a relatively \u201csoft\u201d method because it involves\nthe harvesting of only some of the trees from a stand, leaving others behind and the structure of the forest\nsubstantiallyintact.Themostintensiveharvestisaclear-cut,inwhichalleconomicallyusefultreesareremoved.\nThe smallest clear-cuts, typically involving a hectare or less, are known as a group-selection harvest. More\ntypically, clear-cuts entail the harvesting of trees from larger areas, on the order of 20-100 ha. The largest\nclear-cutsmayextendoverhundreds,andeventhousands,ofhectares.However,suchextensiveoperationsare\nunusual,andareusuallyassociatedwiththesalvagingoftreesthathavebeendamagedbyawildfire,windstorm,\nor insect infestation.\nThere are also some less intensive methods of clear-cutting. A shelterwood harvest is a staged clear-cut, in\nwhichsomelargertreesofeconomicallydesirablespeciesareleftstandingduringtheinitialcut.Theseprovide\naseedsourceandapartiallyshadedenvironmentthatencouragesnaturalregeneration.Oncetheregeneration\nis well underway, the large \u201cleave\u201d trees are harvested. A strip-cut is another kind of staged harvest, in which\nlongandnarrowclear-cutsaremadeatintervals,withuncutforestleftinbetweentoprovideasourceofseedto\nregeneratetreesinthecutstrips.Oncetheregenerationisestablished,anotherstrip-cutismade,againleaving\nintact forest on one of the sides. This system of progressive strip-cutting continues until all the forest in the\nmanagementblock(thespecificareabeingmanagedthisway)hasbeenharvested.Typically,anareaisharvested\nin three to four strips. To regenerate trees on the final strips, foresters may rely on advanced regeneration \u2013\nthat is, on small individuals of tree species that existed in the stand prior to harvesting and that survived the\ndisturbance of clear-cutting. Alternatively, they may plant the last strip with seedlings.\nImage 23.1. This photo shows a three-year-old shelterwood cut of hardwood forest in Nova Scotia.\nAbout 60% of the trees were removed during the harvest, but many of the \u201cbest\u201d trees were left to\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 617 grow into high-quality sawlogs and to shed seeds to promote regeneration. This treatment produces\na complex habitat that supports a mixture of birds and other wildlife typical of both clear-cuts and\nmature forest. Source: B.

The problem would be\nespecially severe if the harvests are conducted over a short rotation. This might not allow enough time for\nthenutrientcapitaltorecoverbynaturalinputs,suchasbyprecipitation,nitrogenfixation,andweatheringof\nminerals (Figure 23.1).\nFigure23.1.EffectsofHarvestIntensityandLengthofRotationonNutrientCapital.Diagram(a)suggests\nthatarelativelylongrotationcanallowharvestednutrientstobereplenishedbynaturalinputsthrough\nrainfall,weatheringofminerals,nitrogenfixation,andothermeans.Anadequatepost-harvestrecovery\n618 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry means that harvesting is sustainable with respect to the nutrient capital of the site.

However,usuallythisproblem\ncan be managed, to a degree, by applying fertilizer or composted organic matter to the land. Sometimes,\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 619 however, the degradation of site capability, especially of tilth, is too severe, and this simple mitigation is not\nsuccessful. Of course, the harvest rotation in agriculture is usually annual, whereas in forestry it ranges from\nabout20to100years.However,eachtimberharvestinvolvestheremovalofahugequantityofbiomass,andthus\nof nutrients.\nCompare,forexample,theamountsofbiomassandnutrientsremovedbyclear-cutsofaconiferforestinNova\nScotia (Table 23.1). In this case, a whole-tree clear-cut yielded 30% more biomass than a stem-only harvest.\nThe increased yield may be an advantage, particularly if the harvest is to be used for energy production. The\nincreasedharvestofbiomassis,however,duetotheremovalofnutrient-richtissuessuchasfoliageandsmall\nbranches. Consequently, the whole-tree harvest removed up to twice as many nutrients as did the stem-only\nclear-cut.Ineffect,a30%increaseinbiomassyieldbythewhole-treemethodwas\u201cpurchased\u201dattheecological\n\u201cexpense\u201d of 54-99% increases in the removal of nutrients.\nTable 23.1.

Nutrient concentrations were determined in subsamples of the biomass and were\nused to calculate the amounts of nutrients removed. \u201cPercentage increase\u201d refers to the whole-tree\nremovals, compared with stem-only removals. Source: Data from Freedman et al. (1981).\nUnfortunately, there are few studies that allow foresters to compare the productivity of subsequent harvest\nrotations on the same site. Such studies would take more than 50-100 years, requiring several generations of\nforesters! Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the implications of nutrient removal by clear-cutting. Overall,\nhowever,itappearsthatadegradationofsitenutrientcapitalisalesssevereprobleminforestharvestingthan\ninagriculture.Consequently,nutrientremovalsbytimberharvestingshouldbeviewedasapotentiallong-term\nproblem.Becauseforestryisaneconomicallyimportantactivity,andthemaintenanceofsitecapabilityiscritical\ntothesustainabilityoftheenterprise,scientistsshouldcontinuetostudytheeffectsofharvestingonnutrient\ncapital. In the short term, however, forestry causes more immediate kinds of damage to site capability and\nbiodiversity that deserve our attention.\nLeaching of Nutrients\nThedisturbanceofforestedlandcanincreasetherateatwhichdissolvednutrientsaretransporteddownward\n620 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry intothesoilwithpercolatingrainwater(aprocessknownasleaching).Ifthenutrientsleachdeeperintothesoil\nthantreerootscanpenetrate,theyareeffectivelylostfromthe\u201cworking\u201dnutrientcapitalofthesite.Eventually,\nleached nutrients can find their way into groundwater and surface waters.\nThenutrientswiththegreatesttendencytoleacharenitrateandpotassium,bothofwhicharehighlysoluble\ninwater.However,calcium,magnesium,andsulphatemayalsoleachinsignificantamounts.Ofcourse,following\na clear-cut, any nutrient losses by leaching are in addition to that removed with tree biomass.\nA well-known study of nutrient leaching caused by forest disturbance was done at Hubbard Brook, New\nHampshire. This large-scale experiment involved felling all of the trees on a 16-ha watershed, but without\nremovinganybiomass\u2013thecuttreeswereleftontheground.Thewatershedwasthentreatedwithherbicide\nfor three years to suppress regeneration. This experiment was designed to examine the effects of intense\ndisturbance, by de-vegetation, on biological control of watershed functions such as nutrient cycling and\nhydrology. The research was not intended to examine the effects of a typical forestry practice.\nOverall, during a 10-year period following the cutting, the de-vegetated watershed lost 50 kg/ha-year of\nNO3-N(i.e.,nitrogenintheformofnitrate),45kg/ha-yofCa,and17kg/ha-yofKinstreamflow(Bormannand\nLikens, 1994; Figure 23.2 shows data for the first three years, which were the most dramatic). The losses were\nmuch larger than from an undisturbed reference watershed: 4.3 kg/ha-y of NO3-N, 13 kg/ha-y of Ca, and 2.2\nkg/ha-y of K.\nInpart,theincreasedlossesofnutrientswereduetoa31%increaseintheyieldofwaterfromthede-vegetated\nwatershed (during the first three years after cutting).

For example,\nin the first three years after clear-cutting a 391 ha watershed in New Brunswick, there was an increased loss\nof nitrate in streamwater of 7 kg NO3-N/ha-yr (Krause, 1982). A study of nine clear-cut watersheds in New\nHampshirefoundanaveragenitratelossof18kgNO3-N/ha-yduringthefirstfouryears,comparedwith3.5kg/\nha-yforfiveuncutwatersheds(Martinetal.,1986).Inaddition,calciumlossesfromtheclear-cutsaveraged28\nkg/ha-y,comparedwith13kg/ha-yforreferencewatersheds,whilepotassiumlosseswere6kg/ha-ycompared\nwith 2 kg/ha-y. However, other studies have found smaller effects of clear-cutting on nutrient losses with\nstreamflow, especially if only a portion of the watershed was cut.\nNitrate and other highly soluble ions are leached from watersheds after clear-cutting (and after other\ndisturbances,suchaswildfire)forseveralreasons.First,disturbancestimulatestheactivityofmicrobesinvolved\ninthedecompositionoforganicmatter.Thisoccursbecauseremovalofthetreecanopyresultsinwarmingofthe\nforestfloorandsurfacesoil,anddecreaseduptakebyplantsleadstoanincreaseofsoilnutrientsandmoisture.\nSecond,disturbanceoftenstimulatesthemicrobialprocessesofammonificationandnitrification(seeChapter\n5), resulting in increased rates of production of nitrate, which is extremely soluble and readily lost from soil.\n622 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry Forestry and Erosion\nForestry activities can cause severe losses of soil, or erosion, particularly in terrain with steep slopes.

In general, however, road building is the most important cause of erosion on forestry\nlands, especially where culverts (channelled stream crossings) are not sufficiently large or numerous, or are\npoorly installed.\nSevere erosion causes many environmental damages. In extreme cases, the loss of soil may expose bedrock,\nmakingforestregenerationimpossible.Soillossalsorepresentsadepletionofsitenutrientcapital.Erosionalso\ncausessecondarydamagetoaquatichabitats,includingthedepositionofsilt(orsiltation),whichcoversgravel\nsubstrates that are important to spawning fish. Also, the shallower water increases the risk of flooding.\nHowever, in many cases erosion is a largely avoidable environmental effect of forestry. The irresponsible\npractices that can cause erosion are restricted by provincial regulations and occur much less frequently now\nthan in the past. Practices that help to reduce erosion include the following:\n\u2022 planning the route of forest roads to avoid stream crossings as much as possible\n\u2022 installing a sufficient number of properly sized culverts\n\u2022 avoiding the disturbance of stream channels by heavy equipment\n\u2022 leaving buffer strips of uncut forest beside watercourses\n\u2022 using log-removal practices that avoid disturbance of the forest floor (such as cable yarding, in which a tall\nspar anchors cables radiating into the clear-cut, which allows logs to be dragged to a central place without\nthe use of a wheeled skidder)\n\u2022 allowing vegetation to regenerate quickly, which speeds the re-establishment of biological moderation of\nerosion\n\u2022 deciding to selectively harvest, or to not harvest, steep sites that are highly vulnerable to erosion\nIthasbecomeacommonpracticetoleavestripsofuncutforestbesidestreams,rivers,andlakes.Thesebuffer\nzonesgreatlyreducetheerosionofstreambanks,eliminatetemperatureincreasesinthewater,maintainriparian\n(lake- and stream-side) habitat for wildlife, and mitigate some of the aesthetic damage from forest harvesting.\nWhileitiswidelyacceptedthatriparianbuffersprovideimportantbenefits,thereisnoconsensusabouthow\nwidetheuncutstripsshouldbe.Thisisaneconomicallyimportantconsideration,becauselargeareasofvaluable\ntimberarewithdrawnfromthepotentialharvestwhenbufferstripsareleft.TherequirementsinNewBrunswick,\nfor example, are for a 30-m buffer on each side of a watercourse, with wider buffers recommended in some\ncircumstances(suchas60miftheslopeexceeds24\u00b0,andupto100mbesidewatersthatareusedforrecreation\nor as a source of drinking water).\nIn some cases, selective harvesting of trees may be allowed within riparian buffers, as long as this does not\ncompromise the ecological services provided by these special management zones.\nForestry and Hydrology\nThe cover of forest on a watershed has a strong influence on its hydrology. Large amounts of water are\nevaporated into the atmosphere by vegetation, especially by trees because they have so much foliage (this is\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 623 transpiration;evapotranspirationincludesevaporationfromnon-livingsurfaces).Intheabsenceoftranspiration,\nan equivalent quantity of water would leave the watershed as streamflow or as seepage to deeper groundwater.\nFor example, studies of four well-forested watersheds in Nova Scotia found that evapotranspiration was\nequivalent to 15-29% of the annual input of water by precipitation (rain plus snow), with runoff in streams\naccountingfortheother71-85%(thesewatershedshavenosubstantialdrainagetodeepgroundwater;Freedman\net al., 1985).\nThehydrologicbudgetofwatershedsisextremelyseasonal,particularlyinthetemperateandborealclimates\nthat are typical of forested regions of Canada. This can be illustrated by the watershed of the Mersey River in\nNovaScotia(Figure23.3).Theannualinputofwaterfromprecipitationwas146cm/y,with82%arrivingasrain\nand 18% as snow. About 62% of the annual input was dispersed by riverflow and 38% by evapotranspiration.\nEvapotranspiration is highest during the growing season, which results in relatively sparse riverflow. Runoff is\ngreater during late autumn and early winter, when there is little transpiration because deciduous trees have\ndroppedtheirfoliage,andevenconifersareinaquiescentstate.However,muchoftheprecipitationduringthat\nperiodrechargesgroundwaterstorage,whichhadbeendepletedbytheuptakeofwaterbyvegetationduringthe\nsummer.Runoffisgreatestduringthespring,whentheaccumulatedsnowpackmelts,andthatresultsinaspate\nof riverflow.\nFigure 23.3.

The increase is proportionately less after partial cuts.\nClear-cuts usually regenerate quickly, and in some cases the vigorous regrowth of shrubs and herbs can\n624 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry restore most of the original foliage area in as few as four to six years. Consequently, the biggest increases in\nstreamflowoccurinthefirstyearaftercutting,followedbyrapidrecoverytothepre-harvestcondition.Inthe\ntemperate and boreal climates prevalent in much of Canada, the largest increases in streamflow occur during\nthe late spring, summer, and early autumn, these being the seasons when transpiration is most important.\nHydrologycanalsobeaffectedbyachangeinthetypeofforestthatisdominantonawatershed.Forexample,\nif an area of hardwood forest is converted into conifer plantations, the annual streamflow may decrease.

Because\ntheyhavesuchagreatinfluenceonlocalenvironmentalconditions,treesarethedominantorganismsinforests.\nAfter clear-cutting, many smaller plants take advantage of the relatively uncompetitive conditions that occur,\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 625 and they dominate the initial stages of the post-harvest succession. They are then reduced in abundance, or\neveneliminatedfromthecommunity,onceseveraldecadesofregenerationhavegonebyandtree-sizedplants\nre-establish their dominance.\nMany plants of early post-cutting succession can only be successful in open habitats \u2013they are intolerant of\nthe shade and other stressful conditions beneath a forest canopy. These relatively short-lived ruderal plants\ncan typically disperse widely, a propagation strategy made necessary because of their ephemeral habitat (see\nChapter9).Ruderalplantsthatcanproliferateinrecentlydisturbedforestsincludeasters,goldenrods,grasses,\nandsedges.Aspecificexampleisthefireweed(Chamerionangustifolium),apurple-floweredherbthatisoften\nabundant after wildfire (hence its name) and also after clear-cutting. Some woody plants are also ruderals,\nbecausetheyaremostabundantduringtherecoveryafterdisturbance.Examplesaretheredraspberry(Rubus\nstrigosus), pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), and elderberry (Sambucus racemosa). Because of their need for\nopen, recently disrupted habitat, ruderal plants benefit from clear-cutting and other disturbances that are\nassociated with forestry.\nUnlike ruderal plants, some other species are tolerant of the environmental stress that occurs beneath a\nclosedforestcanopy.Examplesarethewhitetrillium(Trilliumgrandiflorum),shieldfern(Dryopterismarginalis),\nfeathermosses(suchasPleuroziumschreberiandHylocomiumsplendens),andcertainlichens,suchaslungwort\n(Lobaria pulmonaria). These species are not tolerant of open conditions, and they decline after clear-cutting.\nOnce suitable conditions re-develop, these plants may again increase in abundance.\nIn general, once a clear-cut has had two to four years to regenerate, the plant community is actually richer\nin species than the mature forest that was harvested (this is particularly true of vascular plants). The increase\nin species diversity occurs because recently disturbed habitats are relatively flush in such resources as light,\nnutrients, and water. This allows many species of low-growing plants to be supported, including a diversity of\nruderalones.Incomparison,stressfulhabitats,suchastheunderstoreybeneathamatureforestcanopy,support\nfewer species of plants.\nA study of a hardwood forest in Nova Scotia illustrates the species-rich nature of vegetation after a clear-\ncut(CrowellandFreedman,1994).Thatstudyexaminedstandsofmatureforest,plusclear-cutsofvariousage.\nThe number of plant species in the ground vegetation (shorter than 2 m) averaged 11/m2on two one-year-\nold clear-cuts, and increased to 14/m2on six-year-old clear-cuts.

A study in eastern Canada found that white-tailed deer fed about seven times more intensively in the\ncentre of clear-cuts less than 80 ha in area than in the middle of larger clear-cuts up to 410 hectares in size\n(Drolet, 1978). In fact, optimal clear-cuts for white-tailed deer are rather small in area, although this varies\nregionally. For example, clear-cuts smaller than 4 hectares in New Brunswick and smaller than 2 hectares in\nsouthern Ontario have been recommended to improve habitat for white-tailed deer.\nTo some degree, the amount of useful habitat on larger clear-cuts is greater if they have an irregular shape.\nErraticshapeshaveahigherratioofedgetoareathandocircular,square,orrectangularshapes.Consequently,\nan irregular shaped clear-cut provides more edge habitat, while also making the central part of the harvested\narea more accessible to deer.\nClear-cutsmayalsohavephysicalobstructionstodeermovements,suchastanglesofloggingslash.Theymay\nalso have deep snow during the winter because snowfall is not intercepted by an overhead canopy of conifer\ntrees.

In some ecological contexts, the term \u201cold-growth\u201d is also used to refer to senescent\npopulations of shorter-lived trees, such as older stands of poplar, birch, or cherry. This is not, however, the\nmeaning of \u201cold-growth forest\u201d that is considered here.\nOld-growth forest is a natural ecosystem with special values that are not replicated in plantations or even\nin natural regenerated secondary forests. For this reason, old-growth forest has great intrinsic value and is\nan important component of natural heritage. It also supports certain plants and animals that do not occur in\notherCanadianhabitats.(However,thisisarelativelyminorattributeoftemperateandborealold-growthforest\n\u2013tropical old-growth sustains enormously larger numbers of dependent species; see Chapters 7 and 26.) In\n636 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry addition, old-growth forest delivers important ecological services, such as storing carbon and providing clean\nwater and air, and it has economic value for outdoor recreation and ecotourism.\nOld-growth forest was once much more extensive in Canada (and elsewhere in the world) than it is today.\nIn eastern Canada, for example, early \u201cdevelopment\u201d of the land by European settlers involved the extensive\nclearingofold-growthforestintoagriculturalland-uses,aswellasitsconversionintoyoungersecond-growth\nforestbytimberharvesting.Asaresult,thereislittleofthisecosystemtypeleftintheeasternprovinces,where\nonly a few percent of the total forest is now in an old-growth condition.\nOld-growth forest is more abundant in parts of western Canada, particularly on the Pacific coast, where\nthewetclimatefavoursthedevelopmentofthisnaturalecosystem(becausewildfiresareuncommon).Evenin\nBritishColumbia,however,extensivetractsofold-growthhavebeenloggedorconvertedtourbanizedland-uses,\nespeciallynearVancouverandVictoria.Andbecauseold-growthtimberissuchavaluableresource,muchofthe\nremainingolderforestisthreatenedbyharvesting.Itislikelythatvirtuallyalloftheremainingold-growthforest\nwillbeloggedduringthenextseveraldecadesandconvertedintosecond-growthforest,exceptwheretractsare\nprotected in ecological reserves and parks.\nMany of the characteristics of old-growth forest, including elements of biodiversity, can be accommodated\nbyso-called\u201cnewforestry\u201dharvestingsystemsthatarerelatively\u201csoft\u201dintheintensityofdisturbancethatthey\ncause.Thebestexampleofanewforestrysystemisselectioncuttingwithretentionofsnagsandcavity-trees.\nBecause only some of the valuable timber is removed during a selection harvest, the physical and ecological\nintegrity of the forest are left substantially intact, which conserves many of the old-growth values.\nHowever, there are limits to what can be achieved through the new-forestry practices. If a goal of society\nis to preserve old-growth forest as a special kind of natural ecosystem, this is best done by establishing large,\nlandscape-scale protected areas. The size of the protected areas is a critical factor because they must be\nbig enough to sustain the long-term ecological dynamics that permit old-growth forest to develop, especially\nthe natural disturbance regime. This landscape perspective is important because particular stands of old-\ngrowthforestcannotbepreservedforever\u2013theywillinevitablybecomedegradedbynaturaldisturbanceand/\nor environmental change. Consequently, old-growth forest can be sustained only if large protected areas are\ndesignated to preserve the necessary ecological dynamics.\nOld-growth forest is an extremely valuable natural resource, more so than any other kind of forest. This\nis because it contains large individuals of economically desirable tree species. This timber can be used to\nmanufacturevaluableproducts,suchasfine-grained,large-dimensionlumberandplywood.However,standsof\nold-growth forest are rarely managed by foresters to maintain their defining characteristics. Rather, they are\n\u201cmined\u201dbyharvesting,followedbysilviculturalmanagementtoconvertthesiteintoayounger,second-growth\nforest. The second-growth forest will only be allowed to develop into a middle-aged forest before it is again\nharvested.\nThere is an economic rationale for this kind of management strategy.

This is especially true of tropical old-growth forest.

Ongoing studies will discover additional examples, especially of insects, lichens,\nmosses, and other less conspicuous elements of forest biodiversity. These indigenous biodiversity values are\nendangered by the continued logging of old-growth forest in Canada.\nCanadian Focus 23.1. Controversy in Clayoquot Sound Clayoquot Sound is a Pacific embayment that\nreaches inland in central Vancouver Island to encompass a watershed of about 2,630 km2. The\nmountainous terrain supports a great variety of habitats, including extensive forest on the interior\nmountains and the flatter coastal plain. The climate is mild temperate, with abundant rainfall. The wet\nclimate encourages the natural development of old-growth rainforest. This is a relatively uncommon\necosystem because few places have the conditions necessary for its development. Before commercial\ntimberharvestingbegan,mostoftheClayoquotforestwasold-growth,withmanytreesbeinglargeand\nancient \u2013 some >3 m in diameter and more than 1,000 years old. These old-growth trees have fine-\ngrained wood because of their slow growth rate, which makes them extremely valuable as lumber.\nBecause of the extensive logging of old-growth forest in Clayoquot Sound (and elsewhere), this\necosystem is much less extensive today than it used to be.

However, economic and political priorities may again shift, and thereby delay or prevent the\nimplementation of changes.\n4. Therefore, citizens and environmentalists should always be skeptical about promises made by\ngovernment and industry to protect environmental quality. Moreover, there is never a guarantee\nthat a future government will not change agreed-upon rules (including legislated ones) in ways\nthat provide less protection for the environment. It is even possible that the priorities of future\ngenerations of Canadians may support such an action.\nThe best hope of preventing future damage is to ensure that the social contract of forestry always\nincludesanobligationto:(1)conductindustrialactivitiesinamannerthatdoesnotdegradethetimber\nresource,(2)maintainnon-timbereconomicvaluessuchashuntedspeciesandtourism,and(3)sustain\nthe carbon-storage, hydrologic, and biodiversity values of old-growth forest and other elements of\nnatural heritage.

Forestry plantations are deficient in tree cavities, which are needed by many birds for\nnesting and roosting. In this study, artificial cavities were placed in conifer plantations and in natural\nforest, to see whether this feature was limiting the use of the habitat by species of cavity-dependent\nbirds. It turned out that they only nested in the artificial cavities that were erected in plantations,\nwhich indicates that this habitat feature was limiting their abundance. Source: B.

In fact, a 15-year-old plantation supported a larger bird population than did nearby natural\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 641 forest, while species richness was similar. In this study, many birds of the natural, conifer-dominated forest\nbegan to invade the plantations once the trees were older than about 10 years.\nTable 23.3.

Freedman.\nChapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry | 643 Landscape Considerations\nBiodiversity at the level of landscape is related to the distribution and richness of ecological communities,\nincluding their dynamics over time (see Chapter 7). If a landscape is covered with only one or a few types of\ncommunities, it has little biodiversity at this level. In contrast, an area with a complex and dynamic mosaic\nof communities has much greater landscape-level biodiversity. Landscape ecology involves the study of the\npatterns and dynamics of communities on landscapes (and seascapes).\nLandscape-level biodiversity is influenced by disturbances that result in some stands (or patches) of older\ncommunities being replaced with younger ones. Natural causes of these stand-replacing disturbances include\nwildfire,windstorms,volcaniceruptions,andinsectirruptions.Anthropogeniccausesincludethoseassociated\nwith forestry.\nSometimes,timberharvestingisdesignedtomimicthenaturalpatch-disturbanceregime.Forexample,many\npineforestsarenaturallydisturbedbyperiodicwildfires,duringwhichmostofthematuretreesmaybekilled.\nSoonafterward,anewcohortoftreeseedlingsestablishes,andwithtimetheygrowintoanothermatureforest.\n644 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry Tosomedegree,foresterscanemulatethisnaturaldisturbanceregimewhentheydevelopplanstoharvestand\nmanage pine forest.\nForestry, by its nature, imposes an anthropogenic patch dynamic onto the landscape.

For example, if the remaining patches of natural forest are too small or isolated from\neach other, they will not sustain all of their native species and communities over the long term. These losses\nwould have negative implications for the ecological sustainability of the forestry system (see Chapter 12).\nForestry creates fragmented landscapes that contain successionally dynamic patches of silvicultural and\nnatural-forest habitats. Many species of native wildlife find the silvicultural habitats to be adequate for their\npurposes. However, such habitats and their dynamics are incapable of supporting other native elements of\nbiodiversity,whosesurvivalmaythereforebeatrisk.Ifthesenativevaluesaretobeconserved,largepatchesof\nnatural forest must be set aside as protected areas.\nToachieveabalancebetweentheneedsofforestryandtheresponsibilitytoconserveindigenousbiodiversity,\nconsiderationmustbegiventothesize,shape,andspatialarrangementofthepatchesonmanagedlandscapes,\nincluding the protected areas. For example, if the protected areas are too few, small, isolated, or young to\naccommodate all of their biodiversity objectives, then it will be necessary to design a landscape that is more\necologically appropriate.

At the same time, other economic values must be sustained, such\nas viable populations of hunted animals and opportunities for outdoor recreation. Finally, it is critical that\nno indigenous elements of biodiversity are made endangered by forestry. Although the forest industry has\nbeen making headway toward improving its environmental practices in Canada, not all of the requirements of\necologically sustainable forestry are being satisfied. Therefore, considerably more progress is required in this\ndirection.\nConclusions\nForestry is a key economic sector in Canada, each year affecting millions of hectares of landscape. Timber\nharvesting and management of the subsequent regeneration cause many environmental changes, including\ndecreases of carbon storage, alterations of hydrology, erosion, and effects on the habitat of wildlife.

How do forestry practices threaten the nutrient capital and site quality of harvested stands?\n2. How does timber harvesting affect the hydrology of streams and rivers?\n3. What elements should an integrated management plan include for a typical forested watershed in your\nregion? Consider the needs to ensure a constant supply of timber, deer, sportfish, clean water, and habitat\nfor non-game species.\n4. What are the characteristics of a typical old-growth forest in the region where you live? Do you think that\nthe special values of the old-growth forest can be accommodated by forestry, or can old-growth forest be\npreserved only by creating large protected areas where trees are not harvested? What are the economic\nimplications of setting aside such large tracts of potentially valuable timber? What are the ecological\nimplications?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Consider a typical forest in the region where you live. What are the dominant species of trees, other plants,\nand animals that live in that forest? What are some important interactions among those species? Consider,\nfor example, the habitat needs of certain animals, including their foods.\n2. Are forest products important in your life and in the functioning of your community? Compile a list that\nshows how trees are used for bio-energy, lumber, paper, and other products. Also consider non-timber\nuses of forests, such as hunted animals, recreation, carbon storage, and the provision of clean air and\nwater.\n3. How might forest resources make a larger contribution to the Canadian economy, or to that of your region?\nWould it be possible, for example, to harvest more wood without degrading the timber resource? Could\nmore people be employed in woodland operations if harvesting and management activities were less\nmechanized? Consider also the prospects for reducing the export of raw materials, such as logs, through\nincreased local processing into manufactured products.\n4. Why is it essential that a large and connected system of protected areas be a key part of any landscape-\nscale plan for ecologically sustainable forestry?\nExploring Issues\n1. A proposal is being made to build a lumber mill in an area that is now wilderness. About 40% of the forest in\n648 | Chapter 23 ~ Environmental Effects of Forestry the area is in an old-growth condition. You are an ecologist, working as part of a team of scientists to\nassess the potential environmental impacts of the forest management plan to supply timber to the\nproposed sawmill. Your responsibility is to consider the sustainability of the supply of timber and other\nforest resources, as well as effects on rare species and natural ecosystems. What would you examine to\nensure that the forest management is ecologically sustainable?\nReferences Cited and Further Reading\nBarnes, B.V., S. Spurr, D. Zak, and S. Denton. 1998.

Explain how organic agriculture uses a more ecological approach to the cultivation of crops, resulting in\nless environmental damage.\nIntroduction\nAgriculturecanbedefinedasthescience,andart,ofcultivatingthesoil,producingcrops,andraisinglivestock.\nEven relatively simple agricultural practices can greatly increase the production of food, compared with the\nhuntingandgatheringofwildanimalsandplants.Priortothedevelopmentofagriculture,whichfirstappeared\naround 10,500 years ago, perhaps 5-10 million people were able to subsist through a hunting and gathering\nlifestyle.Today,theworldsupportsanenormouspopulation(morethan7.3billionin2015),andalmostalldepend\nontheagriculturalproductionoffood(fishingandhuntingalsoprovidesomefood).Clearly,thedevelopmentof\nagricultural practices and technologies, and their improvements over time, are among the most crucial of the\n\u201crevolutions\u201d that have marked the socio-cultural evolution of Homo sapiens.\nAgriculture was probably first practised in the Fertile Crescent, a region of southwestern Asia that includes\npartsofwhatarenowIran,Iraq,Israel,Jordan,Lebanon,Syria,andTurkey.Similardevelopmentslikelyoccurred\nat about the same time in China, although the archaeological evidence is less clear. Other cultures discovered\nthe benefits of agriculture somewhat later, in part through the domestication of local species of plants and\nanimals (for instance, in parts of Central America, western South America, and New Guinea). In other regions,\nhowever, domesticated species were mostly imported from elsewhere, as occurred in Australia, Europe, and\nNorth America.\nIn any event, beginning with the cultivation and then domestication of a few useful plants and animals,\nagricultural technology has advanced to the point where it is now able to support enormous populations of\nhumans and our mutualist species (see Chapter 10).\nModern agriculture involves a number of distinct management practices. In the case of crop plants, they\ninclude:selectivebreeding,tillage,theuseoffertilizerandpesticides,irrigation,andreaping.Eachpracticehelps\nto increase the yield of biomass that can be harvested for food or other uses. The practices are typically used\ninvariouscombinations,whichareundertakenasanintegratedsystemofecosystemandspeciesmanagement\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 651 toachievealargeproductionofcrops.However,themanagementpracticesalsocauseimportantenvironmental\ndamages.\nWepreviouslyexaminedagriculturalproductionandeconomicsinChapter14.Inthischapterweinvestigate\nenvironmental damages that are associated with agriculture, with particular attention to effects that occur in\nCanada. We will examine the intensive cultivation of crop plants and livestock, as well as softer management\npractices that are used in organic agriculture.\nCrop Plants\nAlmostalloftheimportantagriculturalcropshavebeendomesticated.Domesticationreferstotheprogressive\nmodificationofcropsthroughtheselectivebreedingofcultivatedraces(orcultivars),whicharenowgenetically,\nanatomically,andphysiologicallydifferentfromtheirwildancestors.Cropplantshavebeenselectivelybredto\nincrease their yield and response to management practices and to enhance their palatability. In some cases,\nthousands of years of domestication have resulted in crop plants that bear so little resemblance to their wild\nancestorsthattheyarenowincapableofmaintainingthemselvesintheabsenceofmanagementbypeople.For\nexample, several millennia of selective breeding of maize (corn; Zea mays) have resulted in its cob becoming\ntightly wrapped within leafy bracts. As a consequence, its seeds are no longer able to scatter from the cob, so\nthey cannot germinate and develop new plants unless assisted to do so by humans.\nA few crop plants have not yet been domesticated. One example is the lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium\nangustifolium),whichhasbeencultivatedforonlyafewdecades.Inthiscase,thehabitatofwildplants(inthe\ngeneticsense)isbeingmanagedtoincreasetheirabundanceandfruitproductionasaperennialcrop.Because\nnotmuchselectivebreedinghasbeenconducted,theblueberryisnotyetadomesticatedplant.Mostcropplants\nare grown as food, while others are sources of fibre, fuel, or medicine. Important domesticated food plants\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 Small grains: barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (corn, Zea mays), millet (Panicum miliaceum), oats (Avena\nsativa), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum and T. durum)\n\u2022 Legumes (pulses): broad bean (Vicia faba), garden bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), garden pea (Pisum sativum),\nlentil (Lens culinaris), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), soybean (Glycine max)\n\u2022 Sweet fruits: apple (Malus domestica), banana (Musa sapientum), grape (Vitis vinifera), grapefruit (Citrus\nmaxima), mango (Mangifera indica), orange (Citrus sinensis), peach (Prunus persica), pear (Pyrus\ncommunis), plum (Prunus domestica), raspberry (Rubus idaeus), strawberry (Fragaria virginiana and F.\nchiloensis), sweet cherry (Prunus avium), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus)\n\u2022 Vegetable fruits: cucumber (Cucumis sativus), pumpkin (squash, Cucurbita pepo), red pepper (Capsicum\nannuum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)\n\u2022 Roots and tubers: beet (Beta vulgaris), carrot (Daucus carota), garlic (Allium sativum), onion (Allium cepa),\nparsnip (Pastinaca sativa), potato (Solanum tuberosum), radish (Raphanus sativus), sweet potato (Ipomoea\nbatatas), turnip (Brassica rapa)\n\u2022 Vegetables: asparagus (Asparagus officinalis); broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower (all varieties of Brassica\noleracea); celery (Apium graveolens); lettuce (Lactuca sativa); spinach (Spinacia oleracea)\n\u2022 Edible oils: canola (or rape, Brassica napus), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), olive (Olea europaea), peanut,\nsoybean\n\u2022 Sugar crops: sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum)\n652 | Chapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment \u2022 Herbs and spices: chili pepper (Capsicum annuum), mint (Mentha spp.), pepper (Piper nigrum)\n\u2022 Beverages: cocoa (Theobroma cacao), coffee (Coffea arabica), cola (Cola acuminata), hops (Humulus\nlupulus), tea (Camellia sinensis)\n\u2022 Recreational drugs: cannabis (marijuana, Cannabis sativa), coca (Erythroxylum coca), opium poppy (Papaver\nsomniferum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)\nOther domesticated plants are cultivated as sources of fibre, which is used to manufacture thread, woven\ntextiles, cordage (such as rope), and paper. Important fibre plants include cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), flax\n(Linumusitatissimum),andhemp(Cannabissativa).Somespeciesoftrees,suchaspines(Pinusspecies),poplars\n(Populus spp.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and spruces (Picea spp.), are grown in plantations (called\nagroforestry)assourcesoffibre.However,thesespecieshavenotbeenselectivelbredtothedegreethatthey\nwould be considered domesticated.\nAfewplantsaregrownfortheproductionofbio-energy,suchasmaize,sugarcane,andothercarbohydrate-\nrichcropsthatarefermentedtomanufactureindustrialethanolusedtopowermotorvehicles(asamixturewith\ngasoline known as gasohol).\nOthercropsaregrownassourcesofrubber(especiallypararubber,Heveabrasiliensis),formedicinalpurposes\n(such as digitalis, Digitalis purpurea), as chewing gum (chicle, Achras zapota), as dyes (indigo, Indigofera\ntinctoria), or for other relatively minor uses.\nImage 24.1.

Freedman.\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 653 The parts of plants that are used for food include seeds (beans, wheat, and other grains and pulses), flowers\n(broccoli),fruits(melons,grapes,tomato),leaves(lettuce,cabbage),stems(asparagus,celery),androots,tubers,\nand other underground tissues (onion, potato, radish). In many cases, the edible parts are tissues that evolved\ntostoreenergyfortheplant,suchasswollenleavesandstems,andtubers.Inothercases,theediblepartsare\nenergy-rich tissues that are involved in sexual reproduction, such as fruits and seeds. An important aspect of\nthedomestication process istheselectivebreedingofcropstoexaggeratetheirdesirabletraits,whichusually\nresults in cultivars that are very different from their wild ancestors.\nProduction of Crops\nThe above lists suggest a rich diversity of crop species. We must remember, however, that the inventory of\ncultivatedplantsisonlyatinyfractionofthenumberofspeciesthatarepotentiallyusefulasfoodsorforother\npurposes, but have not yet been investigated for their usefulness (there are about 250-thousand species of\nvascular plants, but only tiny faction of them most have been investigated for their usefulness; Table 7.1).\nOverall,peopleeatseveralthousandspeciesofplants,ofwhichabout200havebeendomesticated.Ofthese,\nonly 12 species account for about 80% of global food production (Diamond, 1999). They are:\n\u2022 five cereals: wheat, maize, rice, barley, and sorghum\n\u2022 one pulse: soybean\n\u2022 three root or tuber crops: potato, manioc, and sweet potato\n\u2022 two sweeteners: sugar cane and sugar beet\n\u2022 the soft fruit banana Of these top-12 crops, the cereals account for about half of the calories that are\nconsumed.\nAsweexaminedinChapter14,thecultivationofagriculturalcropsisanextremelyimportanteconomicactivity.\nThe Canadian production of cereal crops was 66.4-million tonnes in 2013 (a 31% decrease from a decade\nearlier),while thatofrootandtubercropswas4.6-million tonnes (14%decrease),andmeat4.5-million tonnes\n(7% increase) (FAO, 2015). The most important plant crops grown in Canada are listed in Table 24.1. Note the\ngeneralincreaseincropproductivity(yield)duringthe20-yearperiod,duetoanintensificationofmanagement\npractices. Note also the large increases in the production of certain crops, in particular canola, lentils, peas,\nand soybean. The production of wheat, barley, and maize also increased, partly in response to improved\nopportunities to export these commodities.\nTable 24.1.

Growing Potatoes in the Maritimes One of the most intensive management\nsystems used in Canada involves the cultivation of potatoes in the Maritimes, particularly in Prince\nEdwardIslandandNewBrunswick.Thepracticesdescribedbelowaretypicallyusedonrelativelylarge,\nmechanized farms (Atlantic Potato Committee, 1993).\n\u2022 Tillage: The first tilling is done before planting to break up the soil and facilitate drainage and\naeration. This may be done in late autumn or early spring. Tilling in the spring avoids some of the\nerosionoccursifslopedfieldsareploughedintheautumnandleftwithoutacoverofcropresidueor\nwinterrye.However,springtillingrequiresthatthefieldsbedryenoughtosupportheavymachinery,\nsoitoftenresultsinalaterseedingandlessgrowingtimeforthecrop.Alighter,secondarytillage\nprepares the seedbed and is followed by periodic between-row tillage to reduce the abundance of\nweeds as the crop grows.\n\u2022 Choosing the Variety: Specific varieties are grown, with the choice depending on site conditions\nand whether the crop is to be used as table potatoes, to process into frozen fries or potato chips,\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 657 ortobeusedas\u201cseed\u201d(seebelow).About20-25varieties arecultivatedintheMaritimes (ofwhich\nsix-eight comprise about 80% of the crop). However, this is only a fraction of the diversity of the\npotato \u2013 hundreds of local cultivars are grown in the Andean highlands, where this crop was first\ndomesticated.\n\u2022 Preparing the \u201cSeed\u201d: Potatoes are grown from slices of a tuber that contains several \u201ceyes\u201d (a bud\nfromwhichashootcansprout).The\u201cseed\u201dissurface-sterilizedanddustedwithfungicidetoprevent\nsoftrotandotherdiseases.Thisisavegetative(orclonal)meansofpropagationthatresultsinplants\nbeing genetically identical.\n\u2022 Planting:Oncethesoiltemperatureexceeds7\u00b0C,seedpotatoesareplanted15-40cmapartand8-13\ncm deep, in rows 90 cm apart, and overall equivalent to a density of 28-74/m2. A wider spacing\nis used for food crops and a closer one for seed potatoes. A tractor-drawn planter is used in the\nplanting.\n\u2022 Fertilizer: Potatoes are a \u201csoil-depleting\u201d crop, so fields must be treated with fertilizer, typically at\n800-1000kg/ha-yearwitha15-15-15NPKfertilizer(thismeansthatthefertilizercontains15%each\nof nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium).

These are controlled with fungicide and by using cultivation practices that\ndevelop conditions that are less favourable to the pathogens. A range of 5-15 fungicide treatments\nare required per year, depending on the severity of the problem.\n\u2022 OtherPathogens:Bacterialandviraldiseasesarecontrolledbygrowingdisease-freeseedstockand\nby using cultivation practices that are less favourable to the pathogens.\n\u2022 Pest Control: The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is the most important pest,\nbut other beetles, aphids, and additional insects may also cause damage. Typically 2-5 sprays of\nan insecticide are needed per year. The root-lesion nematode (Pratylenchus neglectus) and other\nnematodes are controlled by crop rotation or by fumigation with a nematicide.\n\u2022 Top-Killing: This aid to harvesting involves one or two late-season sprays with a non-systemic\nherbicidetokillthepotatovinesandtoinducethetuberstoformafirmerskin,whichgivesthema\ndegreeofprotectionduringharvestingandstorage.Althoughthevineswilldiebacknaturally,top-\nkilling with herbicide allows for a controlled timing of the harvest.\n\u2022 Harvesting:Specializedtractor-drawnmachineryisusedtoharvestpotatoes,typicallyfourrowsat\na time.\n\u2022 OtherConsiderations:Continuouscultivationofpotatoesresultsinadepletionoftilthandorganic\nmatter, compaction by machinery, erosion from slopes, and a buildup of pathogens and pests.\nConsequently, potatoes are best grown in a three-year rotation with a cereal and forage crop.\nMeasures to enhance soil organic matter are recommended, such as adding manure, leaving crop\nresidues, andusingagreen-manurecropintherotation.Althoughpotatoescanbegrownwithout\npesticide, this is considered impractical in industrial agriculture.\nImage 24.3.

Ranching of non-domesticated livestock, such as bison (Bison bison) and elk\n(Cervus elaphus), is also increasing.\nLivestock in developed countries are mostly grown under intensive management systems. In large part this\ninvolves rearing animals on \u201cfactory farms,\u201d although beef cattle may spend much of their lives foraging on\nrangeland, as do sheep. Key practices for growing livestock under intensive management include the following:\n\u2022 selective breeding of varieties for higher yield and greater response to management practices\n\u2022 developing \u201ctame\u201d or converted (seeded) pastures to supply fresh fodder, and hayfields for hay feeding,\nsilage production, or bedding\n\u2022 feeding livestock with concentrated foods that are manufactured from fish, slaughterhouse offal (meat\n\u201cwastes\u201d), pulses, and other products, together with mineral supplements\n\u2022 using antibiotics and other medicines to prevent or treat diseases\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 659 \u2022 using growth hormones to increase production in certain animals (particularly cows)\n\u2022 killing natural predators of free-ranging livestock, such as bear, cougar, coyote, and wolf\n\u2022 confining livestock in dense feedlots or factory farms, with feeding to satiation and other intensive\nhusbandry practices\n\u2022 developing organic systems that maintain high yields of livestock, while reducing or eliminating such\nintensive practices as close confinement and the routine use of medicines and growth hormones\nAgain, it is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe intensive management systems for livestock in detail.\nWe can, however, examine a case study to get an idea of what the systems may involve (Canadian Focus 24.3).\nCanadian Focus 24.3. Raising Livestock on Factory Farms Enormous numbers of animals are raised\nin Canada to provide meat, milk, eggs, and other products. In 2013, about 167-million chickens were\nslaughtered, as were 5.7-million turkeys. The most important livestock are cows (16 million including\n2-million milk cows) and pigs (26 million) (Chapter 14).\nTo increase productivity, most poultry, cows, and pigs are reared on \u201cfactory farms\u201d in extremely\ncrowdedquarters,withfeedingtosatiation,plusotherintensivepractices.(However,manycowsspend\nmuchoftheirlifeonrangelandorpasture,beingkeptundercloseconfinementonlyduringa\u201cfinishing\u201d\nphase of rapid growth in a feedlot before slaughter.)\nBecauseoftheobviouspotentialfortreatinganimalscruellyundersuchconditions,livestockrearing\nonfactoryfarmsisacontroversialpractice.Animal-rightsgroupsprotestagainsttheconditionsimposed\non livestock during rearing, transportation, and slaughter. In addition, many people choose to not\npurchasefoodsfromfactoryfarms,ortheyhaveadoptedavegetarianlifestyleinordertonotparticipate\nin what they consider an inhumane economic activity. Partly because of these protests, factory farms\nhave become well-guarded facilities with tightly controlled access.\nAgriculture Canada, the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, and food-industry associations\nhave developed guidelines for the acceptable treatment of livestock in our country. The following is a\nlist of recommended practices for rearing livestock; all are routinely used on industrial farms and are\nconsidered \u201cacceptable\u201d by regulators (Agriculture Canada, 1989, 2009, 2013).\nPoultry\n\u2022 Thedistalthirdofthebeakandtipsofthetoesmaybeamputatedtopreventinjuriesfromfighting\nunder close confinement.\n\u2022 Non-saleable chicks may be euthanized by maceration (grinding), lethal exposure to CO2or CO,\nelectrocution, or decapitation.\n\u2022 Day-oldchicksmaybetransportedfromahatcherytoarearingfacilityinboxescontainingnomore\nthan100chicksandprovidingeachwithafloorspaceofatleast21cm2(aboutfourtimestheareaof\na $1 coin).

Smaller animals may be provided with less width.\nThere are also recommended practices for transporting livestock from rearing facilities to\nslaughterhouses,whichisusuallybytruckortrain.Forexample,cowsandotherruminantanimalscan\nbe transported for as long as 52 hours without receiving any water, food, or rest. For pigs, horses, and\npoultry this period is 36 hours.\nGuidelinesforthehumanekillingofanimalsalsoexist.Thisisusuallydonebyelectrocution,shooting,\nor bleeding, and sometimes by lethal injection. All of these practices are controversial because many\npeopleregardthemasinhumane.Moreover,facilitiesforrearing,transporting,andslaughteringanimals\nare inspected irregularly, and sometimes infrequently. This means that, in many respects, compliance\nwith the guidelines is voluntary.\nEnvironmental Impacts of Agriculture\nDeclining Site Capability\nAgricultural site capability (or site quality) refers to the ability of an ecosystem to sustain the productivity of\ncrops(Chapter14).Soilfertilityisanimportantaspectofthis\u2013itisrelatedtotheamountofnutrientspresent\nandtofactorsaffectingtheiravailability,suchasdrainage,tilth,andorganicmatterinthesoil.Sitequalitycan\nbe degraded by agricultural practices, which may result in the erosion of topsoil, loss of organic matter and\nnutrients, and a buildup of weed populations. These result in decreased crop yields, which may then require\nintensive management practices (such as fertilizer and herbicide application) to try to compensate for the\ndamage. Allowing site quality to degrade is a non-sustainable use of agricultural land.\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 661 Nutrient Loss\nAs plants grow, they take up nutrients from the soil (Table 24.2). When a crop is harvested, the nutrients\ncontained in their biomass are removed from the site. The ability of the soil to supply nutrients may then\ndiminishiftheremovalsexceedtherateatwhichnutrientsareregeneratedbyatmosphericdeposition,nitrogen\nfixation, and the weathering of soil minerals.\nIn fact, nutrient depletion is a common problem with agricultural systems, and it is most often treated by\napplying inorganic fertilizer to the land.

They include adding\ncropresidues,livestockmanure,orotherorganic-richmaterials,suchascompostedmunicipalwasteorsewage\nsludge. The use of no-tillage or low-tillage systems is also helpful, because ploughing encourages the\ndecomposition of organic matter (no-tillage involves sowing seeds by drilling them directly into the ground\nwithout prior cultivation). The use of no-tillage in combination with fertilizer application is also effective at\nincreasing organic matter in prairie soil (Figure 24.1). The regular addition of manure is also useful.

Soil compaction is a serious problem that results in\nwaterlogging, oxygen-poor conditions, impaired nutrient cycling, poor root growth, and decreased crop\nproductivity.Compactioncanbelargelyavoidedbyavoidinganyunnecessarypassagesofheavymachineryover\nfields, using large tires to spread the load, and reducing the density of livestock kept in outdoor stockades.\nSalinization\nThebuildupofsolublemineralsinthesurfacesoil,orsalinization,isamajorproblemindrierregions.Themost\nimportant salts are usually sulphates and chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium, which in severe cases\narevisibleasawhitishcrustonthesurface.Salinizationoccurswhentherearehighconcentrationsofsaltsinthe\nsoil,andtherateofevaporationexceedsthewaterinputfromprecipitation.Theseconditionsbringsaltstothe\nsurface,wheretheyaredepositedasthewaterevaporates.Irrigationpracticescanalsobeacauseofsalinization\nifinsufficientwaterisaddedtoallowdissolvedsaltstodraintobelowtherootingdepthofthecrop.Salinesoil\nis toxic to most crops, largely because of interference with the uptake of water, along with ion imbalance and\ntoxicity.\nInCanada,thisproblemismostlyrestrictedtolow-rainfallregionsofthePrairieProvincesandtoasmallarea\ninsoutheasternBritishColumbia.About2%ofthecultivatedlandinthePrairieshasmorethan15%ofitsarea\naffectedbysalinization,while36%has1-15%oftheareaaffected,andtheremaining62%has<1%affected(Acton\nand Gregorich, 1995).\nThecontrolofsalinizationrequirespracticesthatkeeptheheightofthewatertableloworpreventdissolved\nsalts from rising.

Salt-tolerant crops may be grown on moderately salinized soil, such as\nbarley(Hordeumvulgare)orforageplantssuchasalfalfa(Medicagosativa)andslenderwheatgrass(Agropyron\ntrachycaulum).\nDesertification\nTheincreasingaridityofdrylands,ordesertification,canmakeagriculturedifficultorimpossible.Desertification\nmay be affecting as much as 30% of the land surface of the planet, directly affecting 250 million people and\nputting another billion at risk in more than 100 countries (FAO, 2007). Desertification is a complex problem,\ncausedbybothclimatechange andother anthropogenic influences. Thelatterinclude unsustainable land-use\npracticesindrylands, suchasover-grazing, intensivecultivation, deforestation(oftentoobtain fuelwood), and\nimproper irrigation. These practices can cause the loss of topsoil and vegetation cover and a degradation of\nagricultural capability. These effects are greatly intensified by drought.\nDesertification is largely a problem of regions that are already marginal in terms of the amounts of\nprecipitation and soil moisture that are available to support agriculture. The best-known cases occur in less\ndevelopedcountries,suchasdrylandregionsinAfrica,southandcentralAsia,andLatinAmerica.However,itis\nalsoanimportantproblemintheinteriorregionsofNorthAmericaandAustralia.InCanada,about300-thousand\nkm2insouthernAlbertaandSaskatchewanareatriskofdesertification.Thisregionexperiencedwidespreadloss\noftopsoilbywinderosionduringthedroughtofthe1930s,anditisstillvulnerabletothisdegradation.Thebest\n666 | Chapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment agriculturalland-useinthissemi-aridregionislivestockgrazingonunbrokenperennialrange.Thedevelopment\nof \u201ctame\u201d pastures and the cultivation of annual crops are more likely to cause desertification.\nPollution Caused by Agriculture\nGroundwater and surface waters can become polluted by runoff containing fertilizer, pesticides, and livestock\nsewage.Inputsofnutrientsandorganicmatterfromfertilizerandsewagecancausesevereecologicaldamage\nto surface waters through eutrophication and oxygen depletion. These changes, coupled with the presence of\npathogenic and parasitic organisms, can result in waters becoming unsuitable for drinking by people, perhaps\neven by livestock, or for use in irrigation (see Environmental Issues 14.1).\nTheworstproblemsinvolvethedisposaloftheenormousquantitiesofmanurethatareproducedbylivestock\nkept in feedlots and factory farms. These animals produce about 181-million tonnes of manure per year,\nconsiderablymorethantheamountofhumanfecesproducedinCanada(2.2milliontonnesperyear)(Statistics\nCanada,2009).Moreover,humanfecalwasteismostlytreatedinsewage-treatmentplants(Chapters20and25)\nrather than dumped onto agricultural land or into surface waters, as is commonly done with livestock manure.\nThe most important agricultural pollutant of groundwater is nitrate, which originates with manure\napplications to farmland and the use of fertilizer. This problem occurs because the nitrate ion (NO3\u2013) leaches\nreadilywithwaterthatpercolatesthroughthesoiltogroundwater(nitrateishighlysolubleinwaterandisnot\nretainedbyion-exchangereactionsinthesoil).Nitratepollutionisahazardforpeoplewhousegroundwateras\nasourceofdrinkingwater.Althoughnitrateitselfisnotverytoxic,itisconvertedbymicrobesinthehumangut\ntonitrite,whichwhenabsorbedintothebloodstronglybindswithhemoglobin(formingacompoundknownas\nmethemoglobin),therebyreducingthecapacitytocarryoxygen.Childrenareespeciallyvulnerabletothiseffect;\ntheso-called\u201cblue-babysyndrome\u201dreferstooxygen-starvedinfantswhohavebeenpoisonedbynitrateintheir\ndrinking water or food.\nNitrate pollution of groundwater is a widespread problem.

In fact, nitrate exceeding hundreds of ppm (as NO3-N) has been found in groundwater\nin agricultural regions as a result of the application of manure and/or fertilizer. This important and extensive\nproblem can only be resolved through more prudent fertilizer application and by prohibiting the disposal of\nuntreated manure onto agricultural land. Manure should undergo sewage treatment, just like most human\nsewage does (Chapters 20 and 25).\nThedumpingofrawmanurecanalsopollutegroundwaterandsurfacewaterswithfecalcoliformsandother\nintestinalpathogensandparasites.Thesearehealthhazardstoanyoneusingapollutedwaterbodyoraquiferasa\nsourceofdrinkingwaterorevenforswimming.HealthCanadahassetasafelimitof50coliforms/Lfordrinking\nwater,butthisiscommonlyexceededinwellwatersinareaswhereuntreatedmanureisspreadontoagricultural\nland.AstudyinOntariofoundthat32%of900ruralwellshadcoliformcountsthatexceededthesafelimit,and\nanotherinIled\u2019Orl\u00e9ansinQuebecfoundthat83%of35sampledwellsexceededthelimit(ActonandGregorich,\n1995).\nGroundwaterandsurfacewaterscanalsobecontaminatedbyagriculturalpesticides,whoseusehasincreased\nenormously(Figure24.3).Moreover,somecommonlyusedpesticidesarehighlyleachableinsoil,withimportant\nexamplesbeingatrazine,dinoseb,metolachlor,metribuzin,andsimazine.Onceapesticidereachesgroundwater,\nit may persist for a long time.

In southern Canada (especially in southern Quebec and Ontario), almost all of the\ninitially forested land with good capability for agriculture has been converted into crop production (or into\nurbanizedland-use).ThedeforestationhasimperilledtheCarolinianecosystemanditsmanyendangeredspecies\ninsouthwesternOntario(seeChapters8and26).Similarly,thetall-grassprairieofsoutheasternManitobaand\nsouthwestern Ontario (the Windsor area) has become endangered through agricultural conversion, as have\nthe semi-desert and desert of extreme southern Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.

Private\norganizations such as the Nature Conservancy of Canada and other land trusts are attempting to purchase\nthe best surviving tracts of natural habitat in order to protect them from being destroyed. To some degree,\ngovernmental conservation agencies are also working to do this. However, limited funds are available for this\npurpose, and the losses of natural habitat are proceeding rapidly (see Chapter 26).\nImage 24.4.

Overall, the release of\ninorganic nutrients is typically slow enough that they can be effectively taken up by crop plants, so relatively\nlittle is lost to groundwater or surface water.\nIn conventional agriculture, most inorganic nutrients are added directly as synthetic fertilizer. In contrast,\norganicmethodsofmaintainingfertilityrelyonthemanagementandenhancementofsoilorganicmatter,from\nwhich decomposition makes inorganic nutrients available to crops.\nOrganic matter is also critical to maintaining tilth, a vital soil property that helps to:\n\u2022 bind nutrients and release them slowly for efficient uptake\n\u2022 hold water so that it can be used more effectively by plants\n\u2022 and give the soil an aggregated structure with good aeration and easy penetration by roots\nIn contrast, tilth becomes degraded in conventional agriculture because frequent ploughing increases the\ndecomposition of soil organic matter, even while there are relatively small inputs of new organic matter from\ncrop debris, and heavy machines compact the soil.\nOrganic farmers enhance the organic content and fertility of cultivated soil in three major ways.\n1. They add livestock manure and urine (often these are first composted) to the soil because these materials\ncontain useful organic matter and nutrients. However, as mentioned earlier, this practice must be\ncontrolled because excess applications can pollute groundwater and surface water with nutrients and\npathogens and cause local air pollution with ammonia and odours.\n2. They add green manure, which is living plant biomass that is incorporated into the soil by ploughing. The\nmost fertile green manure is legume biomass, such as that of alfalfa and clover, because these fix\natmospheric nitrogen gas, making them a good organic source of nitrogenous fertilizer. Organic farmers\noften grow legumes in a crop rotation to maintain soil nitrogen.\n3. They add compost, or partially decomposed and humified organic material, to the soil. Composting is a\npartly aerobic process by which microbes and soil animals fragment and decompose organic material,\neventually forming complex, high-molecular-weight humic substances. These are resistant to further decay\nand are extremely useful as a soil conditioner and organic fertilizer.\nItisimportanttounderstandthatgrowingplantstakeupthesameinorganicformsofnutrients(suchasnitrate,\nammonium, and phosphate) from soil, regardless of whether they are supplied by organic practices or with\nmanufacturedfertilizer.Theimportantdifferenceisintheroleofecologicalprocessesversusmanufacturing\u2013\norganicmethodsrelyonrenewablesourcesofenergyandmaterials,ratherthannon-renewableones.Overall,\nthe longer-term effects on soil fertility and tilth using organic practices are much less damaging than those\nassociated with conventional agriculture.\nPest Management\nAll agroecosystems have problems with pests. In conventional agriculture, they are usually managed using\npesticides (but often within the context of integrated pest management; see Chapter 22). Although pesticides\ncan reduce the effects of pests on the yield of a crop, their use may cause environmental damage. Instead of\nsynthetic pesticides, organic farmers rely on other methods of pest management, such as the following:\n672 | Chapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment \u2022 using crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases\n\u2022 using biological pest management by introducing or enhancing populations of natural predators, parasites,\nor diseases\n\u2022 changing habitat conditions to make them less suitable for pests, for example, by growing crops in mixed\nculture rather than monoculture, by rotating crops or using a fallow period to avoid a buildup of pest\npopulations, and by using mechanical methods of weed control such as hand-pulling and shallow inter-row\nploughing\n\u2022 undertaking careful monitoring of pest abundance, so control tactics are used only when necessary\n\u2022 using pesticides that are based on natural products, such as an insecticide based on the bacterium Bacillus\nthuringiensis (B.t.) that may be considered acceptable in organic agriculture, or one based on pyrethrum\nextracted from a daisy-like plant, but not their synthetic analogues, such as genetically engineered B.t. or\nsynthesized pyrethroids\nOrganicfarmers,aswellastheconsumersoftheirproduce,mustberelativelytolerantofsomeofthedamage\nandloweryieldsthatpestsmaycause.Forexample,mostconsumersoforganicproducearesatisfiedwithapples\nthathavesomeblemishescausedbythescabfungus(Venturiainaequalis),andaestheticthatdoesnotaffectthe\nnutritional quality or safety of the apples. In conventional agriculture, this cosmetic damage is managed using\nfungicide,toprovideconsumerswithappleshavingablemish-freeappearancethattheyhavebeenconditioned\nto expect in their food.\nAntibiotics, Growth-Regulating Compounds, and Transgenic Crops\nIntensivelivestockrearingmayinvolvekeepinganimalstogetherundercrowdedconditionsinpoorlyventilated\nenvironments, often continuously exposed to their own manure and urine. Animals kept in such unsanitary\nconditionsarevulnerabletoinfection,whichmayretardtheirgrowthorkillthem.Inconventionalagriculture,\nthis problem is managed partly through the use of antibiotics, which may be given to sick animals or as a\nprophylactic treatment by adding them continuously to the feed of an entire herd.\nUltimately,humansareexposedtosmallresiduesofantibioticswhentheyeattheproductsoftheseanimals.\nAlthough this low-level exposure has not been conclusively demonstrated to pose an unacceptable health risk\ntopeople,theissueisneverthelesscontroversial.Onepotentialproblemliesinthedevelopmentofantibiotic-\nresistant pathogens, which can result in antibiotics becoming less effective for medical purposes.\nOrganic farmers might use antibiotics to treat an infection in a particular sick animal, but they do not\ncontinuously add them to livestock feed. In addition, many raise their animals under more open and sanitary\nconditions than those used in conventional agriculture. Animals that are relatively free of the stresses of\ncrowding and constant exposure to manure are more resistant to diseases and have less need for antibiotic\ntreatment.\nIn addition, some industrial systems for raising livestock use synthetic hormones, such as bovine growth\nhormone, to increase the growth rate of animals or the production of milk. Inevitably, these hormones persist\nas trace contaminants in animal products that are consumed by humans. Although no risk to humans has\nbeenconclusivelydemonstratedfromtheseexposures,thereiscontroversyaboutthepotentialeffects.Organic\nfarmers do not use synthetic growth hormones to enhance the productivity of their livestock.\nAnotherrecentinnovationinagricultureistheuseofso-calledtransgeniccrops,whichhavebeengenetically\nmodifiedbytheintroductionofgeneticmaterial(DNAorRNA)fromanotherspecies(seeEnvironmentalIssues\n6.1).Theintentofthisbioengineeringistoconfersomeadvantagetothecropthatcannotbedevelopedthrough\nChapter 24 ~ Agriculture and the Environment | 673 selectivebreeding,whichreliesonlyontheintrinsicgeneticinformation(thegenome)thatisnaturallypresent\nin the species.\nVarieties of several important crops are transgenic and have been patented by the private companies that\ndevelopedandmarketthem.Forexample,atransgenicvarietyofcanolaisresistanttoglyphosate,whichallows\nthatherbicidetobeusedaspartofthemanagementsystem.Transgenicvarietiesofpotatoandmaizeproduce\ntheinsecticidethatisnaturallysynthesizedbyB.t.andsoareresistanttosomeinsectpests.Transgeniccrops\nare increasingly being grown in conventional agriculture in Canada and elsewhere, but they are not generally\nused in organic agriculture.\nOrganic versus Conventional\nMany people believe that organically grown food is safer or more nutritious than food grown by conventional\nagriculture. This belief is mainly influenced by the knowledge that non-organic foods may have trace\ncontamination with antibiotics, growth hormones, and pesticides, and the idea that this poses a health risk.\nThistopicishighlycontroversial,butitisimportanttounderstandthatscientificresearchhasnotconclusively\ndemonstratedthatorganicallygrownfoodsaregenerallysaferormorenutritiousthanthosefromconventional\nagriculture.\nFromtheenvironmentalperspective,themostimportantbenefitsoforganicagriculturearethereduceduseof\nnon-renewablesourcesofenergyandmaterials,betterhealthoftheagroecosystem,andenhancedsustainability\nof food production.\nHowever, it appears that organic agricultural systems will not become more widely adopted until a number\nof socio-economic conditions change.

Second, vested\nagriculturalinterestsinbusiness,government,anduniversitiesmustbecomemoresympathetictothegoalsand\nsofterenvironmentalimpactoforganicagriculture.Theseinstitutionsmustsupportmoreresearchtoadvance\norganic agriculture and promote its use. Finally, the practitioners of conventional agricultural systems must\ndeal more directly with the environmental damage that is associated with their activities, especially the use\nof manufactured pesticides and fertilizers. If this were done, it would probably eliminate or even reverse the\nexisting price differential between food produced by organic and by conventional agricultural systems.\nConclusions\nAgricultureisahugeandnecessaryenterprisebecauseitprovidesfoodforbillionsofpeople.Avarietyofcrops\naregrowninvariouspartsoftheworld,manyofthemdomesticated,butonlyafewkeyonesaccountformostof\nthefoodproduction.Thesearebarley,maize,manioc,potato,rice,sorghum,soybean,sweetpotato,andwheat.\nMuch environmental damage is associated with agriculture, including pollution, degraded land capability, and\nthedestructionofnaturalhabitats.Inaddition,livestockarenottreatedwellintheindustrialagro-foodsystem,\noften being subjected to unnecessarily inhumane conditions while being reared, transported, or slaughtered.\nMuch of the damage associated with agriculture can be avoided by using more organic means of production\nandprocessing.

Agricultural activities cause serious and widespread environmental damage in terms of pollution and losses\nof natural habitat. Why do these damages seem to attract less attention than those associated with\nforestry, oil and gas extraction, and other industrial activities? Are agriculture-related damages being\ntreated seriously enough?\n3. Consider the practices that are used in raising livestock on factory farms and in transporting and\nprocessing them in slaughterhouses. Do you think that these animals are being treated in an ethically\nacceptable manner?\n4. Canadian agriculture is highly mechanized and depends on the use of large amounts of fossil fuels and non-\nrenewable materials such as steel and plastics. Do these circumstances pose risks for the longer-term\nsustainability of agriculture in Canada?\nExploring Issues\n1. Select a crop plant or animal that is cultivated in the province where you live. Use the website of your\nprovincial agricultural department to find out the practices that are recommended for growing the crop\nand what its production costs and economic value are.\n2. Make a list of key agricultural practices (such as tillage, planting, fertilizer application, and pest control),\nand compare how they are done in conventional and organic agriculture. Based on your comparison, to\nwhat degree do you think organic agriculture causes fewer environmental damages than conventional\npractices?\n3. A committee of the House of Commons is examining organic agriculture in Canada. The committee has\nasked you to compare the environmental effects of conventional and organic agricultural practices.

In contrast, resource-based economic activities, such as cultivating food and\nharvesting minerals, fossil fuels, timber, or wildlife, occur primarily in rural areas.\nUrban areas import energy, food, and materials from the local countryside, as well as from more distant\nregionsoftheircountry,inadditiontoothernationsaroundtheworldinanincreasinglyglobalcommerce.The\nresource-relatedconnectionsbetweencitiesandruralareasexistatallspatialscales(local,regional,andglobal)\nand are an integral but often insufficiently appreciated aspect of urban ecology.\nThe development of dense habitations (initially small villages) during human cultural evolution began about\n10-thousand years ago, when early agricultural practices allowed the production of local surpluses of food\n(harvests that exceeded the subsistence needs of the farmers themselves). The excess food encouraged the\ndevelopmentofspecializedoccupationsthatweremostefficientlyperformedinacentralplacesuchasavillage\nortown.Newsocietalactivitiesincludedorganizedreligionandpoliticalsystems,artisanalmanufacturing,and\nthemeansofadministeringtheseoverwideareasthroughhierarchicaleconomic,political,religious,andmilitary\nstructures.\nThe first villages were probably supported by both settled agriculture and local hunting-and-gathering\nactivities. By about 9,000 years ago, small farming villages were relatively widespread in some regions,\n678 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology particularlyintheFertileCrescentoftheMiddleEast(seeChapter24).By8,500yearsago,thatregionboasted\nsizeable walled towns. Similar developments also occurred in China and probably elsewhere in southern Asia.\nFrom these humble beginnings, urbanization of the human population has proceeded apace, and especially\nrapidlyduringthepastcentury.Onlyabout2.5%ofthehumanpopulationlivedintownsandcitiesin1800,and\n5-10%in1900.Today,abouthalfofthehumanpopulationlivesinurbanplaces,andthisispredictedtoriseto\ntwo-thirdsby2025(orabout5billionpeople).About90%ofthisincreaseinurbanpopulationswilloccurinless-\ndevelopedcountries(seeChapter10).Globally,theurbanpopulationisnowgrowingaboutfourtimesasquickly\nasthatofruralareas,largelybecauseofthemigrationofhugenumbersofpeoplefromthecountrysidetobuilt-\nup areas.\nInCanada,about20%ofthepopulationlivedintownsandcitiesin1871,increasingto38%in1900,63%in1950,\nand 81% in 2011 (of which 45% live in cities larger than 750-thousand people; Chapter 11).\nIn 1750, few cities supported more than 50-thousand people \u2013 London was the only one in England, and\nthere were none in North America. In 1830, New York and Philadelphia were the only American cities with\na population greater than 100-thousand. By 1910, however, 52 cities in North America supported more than\n100-thousand people (New York was the largest, with more than 1 million). In 1950, New York and Tokyo were\ntheonlytwomegacitiesintheworld(thatis,havingapopulationgreaterthan10million).In2014,therewere537\ncitiessupportingmorethan1millionpeople,including35megacities,ofwhich29wereinthedevelopingworld\n(Brinkhoff, 2015).

If the largest cities are considered overpopulated, how can continued population\ngrowth be discouraged? Can people be encouraged to move to smaller centres? These and other questions\nrelated to urban population policies are extremely controversial, but all will have to be addressed.\nImage 25.1. Urban environments are highly artificial.

Freedman.\nUrban Ecosystems\nAny urbanized area can be viewed as being an ecosystem, because it has the following ecological attributes:\n1. a need for enormous inputs of energy and materials to sustain its human population and its diverse\neconomic activities, and to maintain its structure and grow\n2. a complex metabolism, including well-developed webs of transfer, processing, and storage of materials,\nenergy, and information among interacting organisms and economic sectors\n3. and immense outputs of heat and other waste materials, which are disposed of in surrounding ecosystems,\ncausing pollution and other environmental problems\nOf course, the habitats of cities and towns are very strongly influenced by human activities. Collectively they\ncomprise an urban\u2013industrial techno-ecosystem (Chapter 8). The structure of this anthropogenic ecosystem\nis dominated by the businesses, dwellings, factories, roads, and other infrastructure of the human economy,\n680 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology while also supporting manicured green space as well as remnants of natural habitats in parks and other less-\ndevelopedspaces.Althoughhumansarethedominantspeciesintheurbanecosystem,manyotherspeciesare\nalsosupported,mostofwhicharenotnativetotheregion.Importantecologicalfunctionsalsooccurwithinthe\nurbanecosystem,suchasbiologicalproductivityandwaterandnutrientcycling,buttheseprocessesaregreatly\ninfluenced by humans.\nAll urban areas are intrinsically dependent on surrounding ecosystems to provide them with necessary\nresources and to assimilate wastes that are generated.

To some degree, their development has occurred in an orderly fashion, with certain areas being\ndesignatedforparticularkindsofstructuresandactivities.Urbanplanningistheactiveprocessofdesigningand\norganizingthestructureandfunctionofcities.Assuch,urbanplanningcontributestotheinformationneeded\nby legislators and other decision makers as they develop sensible and efficient siting of the following:\n\u2022 buildings, including homes, commercial properties, institutions (such as hospitals and schools), and\nindustrial facilities\n\u2022 infrastructure for transportation, utilities, and waste management, such as roads, railways, public-transit\nroutes, electrical transmission and pipeline corridors, sewers and sewage-treatment facilities, and solid-\nwaste disposal areas\n\u2022 greenspaces, including playing fields and horticultural and natural-area parks\nWell-planned urban areas have relatively pleasant neighbourhoods where people live and work. In contrast,\npoorlyplannedcitiesarechaotic,dirty,andunpleasant.Ingeneral,urbanplanningismosteffectiveinwealthy\ndevelopedcountriessuchasCanada,butmuchlesssoinpoorerdevelopingcountrieswherethepopulationis\ngrowing and urbanization is proceeding most rapidly.\nThe dominant planning paradigm of the past 60 years has involved the segregation of major land-uses and\neconomicactivitiesintodifferentareas.Thiskindofstrategyhasgreatlyinfluencedthedesignofmoderncities,\nincludingallthoseinCanada.Ithasresultedinmanyurbanpeoplelivingindiscreteinner-cityneighbourhoods\nor more distant suburbs, while shopping in large malls, working in factory or office complexes and industrial\nparks, and commuting long distances among these land-use types. However, this type of planning has\ncontributed to some important urban problems, including the following:\n\u2022 the rapid growth of huge, multi-city, urbanized regions (sometimes known as conurbations)\n\u2022 the inefficient segregation of residences from places of work and commerce\n\u2022 long commuting times for workers\n\u2022 congested transportation systems\n\u2022 a decay of neighbourhood life\n\u2022 environmental problems such as air and water pollution, wasteful use of energy and materials, paving of\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 683 valuable farmland (many urban areas are located on excellent agricultural land), and losses of natural\nhabitat\nSome of these issues are examined in more detail later in this chapter.\nThe paradigm of widely segregated land-use is now being challenged by the concept of a more integrated\n\u201cneighbourhood\u201ddesign. Thisinvolvesthedevelopmentofrelativelycompact,self-sufficientcommunitiesthat\ncontain a mixture of residential and commercial land-uses.

When the agricultural land is lost, there is a depletion of the ability of the landscape\ntoprovidefood.ThisisanimportantprobleminpartsofsouthernCanada,wheremuchofthehighest-\ncapability land in the country is being converted into residential and commercial uses of cities.\nUrbansprawlisalsoathreattonaturalhabitats,particularlyinareasthatsustainrareecosystems.For\nexample,theareaaroundVictoriaistheonlyplaceinCanadawheredryforestdominatedbyGarryoak\n(Quercusgarryana)occurs.Thisishabitattomanyrarespeciesandisoneofourmostendangerednatural\necosystems.Theexpansionofresidentialareasisthegreatestrisktothiscoastaloakforest.Conservation\nagenciesingovernmentandtheprivatesector,includingtheNatureConservancyofCanada,aretrying\nto protect the surviving patches of this rare forest.\nUrbansprawlcanalsobeathreattotheabilityoflandscapestoprovidekeyenvironmental\u201cservices,\u201d\nsuch as clean water. One such case involves an area known as the Oak Ridges Moraine, which has\nbecomearallyingpointforhabitatprotectionagainstfurtherurbanizationintheGreaterTorontoArea.\nThe moraine is a 160-km-long, 1950-km2ridge located north of the city, and it is composed of hilly\nterrain underlain by glacial sand and gravel. Because of its rough topography and poor fertility, much\nof its area has remained forested or is used for pasture or other low-intensity agricultural purposes.\nGroundwater originating in the moraine is a source of well-water recharge for about 250-thousand\npeopleandisasourceof65riversandstreamsandmanywetlands.However,withtherapidgrowthof\nthegreaterTorontoregion,themorainehasbeensubjectedtoincreasingpressurefromresidentialand\ncommercialdevelopment.Extensiveclearingofitsforestedandpastureareaswoulddegradetheability\nof the moraine to provide clean groundwater for use by people and to support streams and wetlands.\nLoss of the remaining forest would also destroy habitat for native species that are rare in the region.\nIn response to intense lobbying from groups seeking to limit new developments on the moraine, the\nGovernmentofOntarioformedanadvisorypaneltoprovideadviceabouttheregulationofland-use.The\npanelprovidedmanyrecommendations,includingtheneedtoprotect92%ofthemorainefromintensive\ndevelopment,andthesewerekeyinthepreparationofTheOakRidgesMoraineConservationAct,2001.\nThe Act was used to prepare a land-use plan, including provisions for core natural areas and linkages\namong them, comprising about 62% of the moraine.

Moreover, bicycle manufacturing requires far less material and energy\nresources, and less infrastructure is needed to support these vehicles in terms of space for roads and\nparking. Therefore, bicycles represent an environmentally soft (or \u201cgreen\u201d) alternative to motorized\nvehicles for personal transportation. There are more than 1-billion million bicycles in the world, about\nhalf of them in China. Canadians own about 13 million bicycles, or 0.42 per person. In spite of this\nnumber, only 1% of all trips are made using a bicycle, which suggests that many bicycles are not well\nused. Great environmental benefits would result if more Canadians used bicycles instead of motor\nvehiclesasameansofpersonaltransportation.Thesebenefitsincludelessairpollution,smallercostsof\n690 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology transportation infrastructure, and less use of energy and material resources.

Safer bicycle use requires separate lanes along busy roadways, improved awareness\nby automobile and truck drivers of the need to share the road with bicycle riders (and vice versa), and\nincreased use of safety equipment by bicyclists, especially helmets and lights and reflective devices at\nnight. The use of bicycles in cities can be encouraged in the following ways:\n\u2022 bydevelopinganetworkofcycleways(separatepathsforbicycles),bikelanes,andpavedshoulders\non major roads\n\u2022 byprovidingsecureparkingfacilitiesatworkplacesandpublic-transitstations(thelatterisknown\nas \u201cbike and ride\u201d)\n\u2022 by having a fleet of bicycles for free use or inexpensive rental from a network of pick-up centres\n(thissystem,firstusedinseveralEuropeancities,isbeingtriedonasmallerscaleinNorthAmerica,\nincluding Montreal)\n\u2022 by educating people about the advantages of bicycle transport and safety issues.\nOther ways to increase bicycle use would be much more difficult to implement. For example, urban-\nplanning options could encourage people to live closer to their workplaces, giving them shorter\ncommutes.Inaddition,legislationcouldensurethatpeopleusingmotorizedtransportpaythefullcosts\noftheirchoiceoftransportationbywithdrawingsubsidiesfortheconstructionofroads,bridges,parking\nlots, and other infrastructure and by applying realistic taxes (such as user fees) to offset the costs of\nassociated air pollution and resource depletion.\nUrban Pollution\nUrban pollution includes elevated concentrations of chemicals and particulates, increased noise and heat, and\nimpaired aesthetics. We briefly examine each of these topics in the following sections.\nChemical Pollution\nUrban environments commonly have higher concentrations of various chemicals than typically occur in rural\nplaces.Aswell,awiderrangeofchemicalsispresent,includingmanysyntheticones.Often,chemicalpollution\nof the urban environment is intense enough to damage the health of people, animals, and vegetation.\nSoil in urban areas may become polluted by a wide range of substances, including petroleum products,\nhalogenated hydrocarbons (such as PCBs), and metals. This is illustrated by the following examples.\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 691 \u2022 Hydrocarbon spills: Liquid hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, fuel oil, paints, and solvents (such as those used\nin dry-cleaning) are stored in many places. This includes underground tanks at gasoline stations and fuel-\noil tanks in homes and at commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. Smaller amounts of fuels are\ncontained in all cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Spills of some kinds of liquid fuels, such as gasoline, can be\nextremely hazardous because of the risk of fire or explosion. In addition, if liquid hydrocarbons are spilled\nonto soil, they quickly penetrate and cause local pollution of the groundwater, which may then spread\nwidely as a plume of tainted water. This can ruin the usefulness of an aquifer as drinking water: as little as 1\nppm of hydrocarbons can result in discernible tainting and even smaller concentrations of some chemicals\nare considered a health risk. It is difficult or impossible to contain a hydrocarbon spill once it reaches\ngroundwater or to fully rehabilitate a polluted aquifer. It is much easier to avoid hydrocarbon spills than to\ndeal with the environmental damage they cause.\n\u2022 Metals: Urban soil can become polluted by metals in many ways. For example, people who live near metal-\nrecycling factories may be exposed to pollution through dustfall from the atmosphere. In one case, severe\npollution was found in a downtown Toronto residential neighbourhood near a car-battery recycling\nfactory. Lead in surface soil near the factory exceeded several thousand ppm (one sample had >5% lead),\nand some residents had elevated lead in their blood and hair. This astonishing land-use conflict occurred\nbecause of earlier, inappropriate land-use zoning, when less attention was placed on environmental\nconcerns. However, the battery-recycling factory still remains in the residential neighbourhood, although it\noperates much more cleanly than in the past. Lead pollution of urban soil has also been caused by residues\nof old paint, which often had very high concentrations of lead-containing pigments (commonly reaching\n38% in the dried residue), especially in white and red colours. (Lead is now mostly replaced in household\npaints by titanium and other less-toxic metals). Soil close to busy highways is also affected by leaded\ngasoline (this problem has dissipated since the 1990 ban on leaded gasoline; see Figure 25.6 and Chapter 18).\nEutrophication is another kind of urban pollution. Lakes and rivers in urban areas often have an enriched\nnutrient supply, which results in increased productivity and eutrophication. The nutrient inputs originate\nfrom fertilizer use in horticulture, leaching from septic fields, and sometimes the dumping of sewage. Urban\nwaterbodies are also commonly polluted with coliform bacteria and other intestinal pathogens and parasites\nthat originate with sewage and surface runoff contaminated by pet and bird feces. Lakes and rivers may also\nbe affected by spilled fuel, metals, garbage dumping, and sedimentation by soil eroded during construction\nactivities. Any of these influences on urban lakes may render them less suitable or even unfit as a source of\ndrinkingwaterorforrecreationalpurposes.Eutrophicationandsedimentationalsocausesignificantecological\ndamage in many urban waterbodies.\nUrbanairpollutioncanalsobesevere,causinglife-threateninghealthproblemsformanypeople,particularly\ntheoldorveryyoungandthosewithrespiratorydiseases.Severepollutionbysulphurdioxideandparticulates\nwasoncecommoninNorthAmericanandEuropeancities,whencoalwasburnedasanindustrialandresidential\nfuel. This problem has, however, been greatly alleviated since the early 1960s because of clean-air regulations\n(Chapter16).However,thiskindofreducingsmogisstillsevereandevenworseninginmanyrapidlydeveloping\ncountries, where a lower priority is given to enforcing clean-air laws.\nInspiteofgreatimprovementssincethe1960s,citiesinCanadaandotherdevelopedcountriescontinuetobe\naffected by significant levels of air pollution (Chapter 16; Figure 25.6). The following are particularly important.\n\u2022 SO2and NOx gases: Although so-called reducing smog is much less of a problem than before, urban\natmospheres still have higher concentrations of SO2and NOx than rural areas. The dry deposition of these\ngases damages marble, limestone, sandstone, and other acid-sensitive building materials and statues, and it\ncontributes to the acidification of aquatic habitats (Chapter 19). In addition, these gases may be directly\n692 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology toxic to sensitive urban plants and lichens.\n\u2022 Suspended particulates: Largely originating from emissions from vehicles, furnaces, and other combustion\nsources, suspended particulates are mostly fine aerosols of ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, and\nsooty organics. At high concentrations they form a haze that interferes with visibility and is a hazard to\npeople with respiratory problems. In general, air pollution by particulates has decreased markedly during\nthe past several decades, mainly because of better emission controls on power plants, other industrial\nsources, and vehicles, and because of widespread switching to natural gas as a fuel.\n\u2022 Oxidants: Cities with a sunny climate and a large number of motor vehicles often develop a photochemical\nsmog during the day, characterized by high concentrations of ozone, peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN), NOx, and\nvolatile organic compounds (Chapter 16). The ozone component is responsible for most of the oxidant\ndamage because it is toxic to many plants, irritates people\u2019s eyes and respiratory tracts, and degrades many\nmaterials and pigments. The worst photochemical smog occurs in southern Ontario and Quebec, extending\nfrom Windsor to Quebec City, and to a lesser degree in the greater Vancouver area and around Saint John.\nThe air-quality objective for ozone (63 ppb) is exceeded on many summer days in the Quebec-Windsor\ncorridor, where maximum hourly concentrations can exceed 160 ppb. Niagara Falls, Sarnia, Windsor, and\nGuelph are among the smoggiest cities in Canada, exceeding ozone guidelines for more than 50 days per\nyear. The photochemical smog in this region occurs because of local emissions of NOx and volatile organics\n(these are precursors in the photochemical production of ozone; see Chapter 16), as well as those blowing\nin from urban areas in the nearby United States. In contrast, local emissions are the major cause of ozone\nsmog in the Vancouver area.\nFigure 25.6. Air Quality Trends in Canada. These data are from sampling stations located throughout\nCanada, but mostly in urban areas. Source: Data from Environment Canada (2014).\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 693 694 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology Urban Climate\nThe climate of urban regions is different from that of nearby rural areas. Compared with rural areas, cities\ntypically exhibit the following characteristics:\n\u2022 they are warmer by 3-6\u00b0C\n\u2022 have 5-10% more cloud cover\n\u2022 receive about 20% less solar radiation\n\u2022 have 20-30% lower wind speeds (although wind-tunnelling may increase windspeeds near large buildings)\n\u2022 have 5-15% lower relative humidity\n\u2022 receive 5-15% more precipitation The best known of the climatic differences, called the \u201cheat-island\u201d effect,\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 695 refers to the warmer temperature of cities, which occurs because of the following influences on the urban\nenergy budget:\n\u2022 an emission of large amounts of heat (thermal energy) from buildings and machines (including motor\nvehicles)\n\u2022 interference by buildings with the dispersal of warmed air by wind\n\u2022 the absorption of solar radiation by dark surfaces (especially asphaltic roads and parking lots ), followed by\nthe re-radiation of long-wave infrared\n\u2022 a relative lack of plant foliage in urban areas (the atmosphere is cooled by the evaporation of water from\nfoliage, also known as transpiration)\nThermal Pollution\nThermal pollution occurs when an increase in environmental temperature is sufficient to result in ecological\ndamage. This may be due to the direct discharge of heat into the environment, often from a point source\ninto an aquatic ecosystem. As the water becomes warmer, the respiration of poikilothermic (cold-blooded)\norganisms increases, about doubling in rate for every 10\u00b0C increase in temperature. At the same time, the\namount of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases (because the solubility of gases is less in warm water).\nThe increased metabolism and decreased oxygen cause physiological stress to aquatic organisms. Associated\necologicalproblemsincludechangesinthecommunitiesoffish,invertebrates,aquaticplants,andalgae.Extreme\nthermal pollution can result in anoxic water, accelerated eutrophication, and fish kills. Thermal pollution can\nreduce the potential for recreational, industrial, and drinking-water uses of a waterbody.\nThermalpollutionisassociatedwithdischargesofwarmedwaterfromfossil-fuelledornuclear-powerplants\nor other large industrial facilities. These places often use a local waterbody as a source of cooling water.

Under prolonged exposure, the hearing loss may\nprogress through much of the auditory range. Hearing loss is caused by both the duration and intensity of\nexposure.Forexample,anoccupationalexposureto115dBmaybepermittedfornolongerthan15minutes,while\nexposure to 100 dB may be allowed for two hours and 90 dB for up to eight hours. Noise becomes painful at\nabout140dB,althoughprolongedexposuretolevelsabove80-90dBcanresultinlong-termhearingloss.The\nnoise levels typically associated with various sources are shown in Figure 25.7.\nPeople may be exposed to excessive noise in various ways. Non-voluntary exposures occur in the ambient\nenvironment, such as near a road with heavy traffic. Occupational exposures occur in noisy factories or in\nhangars where jet engines are serviced. Voluntary exposures to excessive noise are also common, such as\nwhenpeopleattendthunderousrockconcertsoruseheadphonestolistentoloudmusic.Itiswellknownthat\npermanenthearinglossiscommonamongrockmusiciansaswellaspeoplewhoregularlylistentoloudmusic\nat concerts, clubs, or using headphones. Frequent target-shooting with firearms can also result in long-term\nhearing loss unless effective ear protection is used.\nVarious levels of government in Canada have set criteria for permissible exposures to noise. For example,\nHealth Canada sets standards and guidelines for occupational exposures, while provincial and municipal\ngovernments deal with particular sources (such as the amount of noise a vehicle can make) as well as noise\nlevels in the ambient environment. Various actions can reduce the noise intensity in occupational and urban\nenvironments. Vehicles and other machines are required to have noise-absorbing devices (mufflers) that must\nperformaccordingtoregulatedstandards.Machinesintheworkenvironmentmayalsobemuffled,andworkers\nmay be advised or required to wear hearing protection.\nFigure25.7.SoundPressureLevelsAssociatedwithVariousSourcesofNoise.Source:DatafromTimerson\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 697 (1999).\nAesthetic Pollution\nAesthetic pollution is substantially a matter of cultural values. It commonly involves visual images that are\ndispleasing to many (but not necessarily all) people. As such, the criteria for aesthetic pollution cannot be\nprecisely defined. For example, many people might find the following to be objectionable:\n\u2022 a neighbourhood of dirty run-down buildings\n\u2022 an area cluttered with garbage\n\u2022 a street with a viewscape blocked with gaudy billboards, neon advertising, and other promotions\n\u2022 overhead utility wires\n\u2022 spaghetti-like networks of roads, overpasses, and underpasses crowded with grid-locked vehicles\n\u2022 paved open spaces without trees, shrubs, or flowers.\nHowever,thereis,however,nobroadconsensusaboutwhatconstitutesaestheticpollution\u2013somepeoplemight\nfind that these scenes have aesthetic merit and may even seek them out. Aesthetic pollution is not generally\nconsideredtobeasimportantaproblemaschemical,noise,orthermalpollution.Nevertheless,urbanplanners,\nneighbourhood activists, and other concerned people do try to reduce the aesthetic pollution of cities and\ntowns. For example, many urban areas have bylaws that require property owners to keep their property clean\n698 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology andingoodrepair.Someplacesrequirethatutilitycablesbeburied,ortheybancertainkindsofadvertising.(For\nexample, in order to conserve pastoral viewscapes, unrestricted highway billboards are not allowed on Prince\nEdward Island.) Reducing aesthetic pollution in urban areas makes them nicer places in which to live and work.\nWaste Management\nAny discarded materials can be viewed as waste, but there are a number of categoris:\n\u2022 Solid wastes are extremely variable in composition and include discarded food, leaves and lawn clippings,\nnewspapers and other papers, glass and plastic bottles, cans, disposable diapers, construction debris,\nindustrial chemicals, old cars, and disused furniture\n\u2022 Liquid wastes include sewage and discarded industrial and household fluids\n\u2022 Gaseous wastes include products of combustion or industrial reactions\n\u2022 Hazardous wastes are flammable, corrosive, explosive, toxic (also called toxic waste), or otherwise\ndangerous, and they should either be treated before disposal or discarded into a specially designed, secure\nlandfill to environmental damage\nPeoplehavealwaysproducedwastesofmanykinds.However,theamountandcomplexityofdiscardedmaterials\nhaveincreasedenormouslyasaresultofindustrialandtechnologicaldevelopment,coupledwiththegrowthof\npopulation andconsumerism. Activities in urbanareasproducehugeamountsofwaste. Waste managementis\nthe handling of discarded materials, using various methods:\n\u2022 Dumping is the long-term disposal of disused material. The disposal of solid wastes by dumping usually\noccurs into a sanitary landfill (see below). Liquid wastes are most commonly discarded into a nearby lake or\nriver, with or without treatment to reduce the amounts of organic matter, toxins such as metals and\nhydrocarbons, and pathogens. Gaseous wastes are usually dumped into the atmosphere, although the\namounts of damaging gases (such as SO2) and particulates may be reduced by pollution-control\ntechnologies.\n\u2022 Incineration is the combustion of solid wastes to reduce the amount of organic material. Small-scale\nincineration may involve open burning. However, incineration in urban areas and industrial plants is\nconducted in specially engineered facilities designed to burn efficiently, while controlling the emissions of\npollutants to the atmosphere. The residual material, consisting of ash, metals, glass, and other non-\ncombustibles, is usually disposed of in a secure landfill. Overall, incinerators reduce the volume of waste by\n70-90%, depending on the initial organic content. If the heat produced is used to generate electricity or\nindustrial steam, the incinerator is known as a waste-to-energy facility.\n\u2022 Recycling involves the processing of discarded materials into useful products. For example, aluminum pop\ncans can be collected and re-manufactured into new containers or other products. Recycling is an\nextremely attractive waste-management option for three major reasons: (1) it reduces the total amount of\nwaste, (2) it recovers valuable commodities from discarded materials, and (3) it helps to conserve non-\nrenewable resources (such as metals and fossil fuels) and some renewable ones (such as trees used to\nmanufacture paper). Easily recyclable materials include glass, all metals, most plastics, and almost all kinds\nof paper. In fact, these discarded materials should be regarded as \u201cresources\u201d rather than \u201cwastes.\u201d\n\u2022 Composting is a type of recycling in which discarded organic materials are allowed to partially decay under\nwarm, moist, oxygen-rich conditions. Backyard composting is done in simple bins or piles. To enhance the\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 699 availability of oxygen, advanced commercial systems turn the material occasionally or force air through\nmatter contained in a vessel. All food wastes, lawn clippings, leaves, paper, sawdust, sewage sludge, and\nother organic discards can be composted. The material produced, known as compost, is rich in humified\norganic matter and is extremely useful in enhancing the tilth and fertility of garden and agricultural soil\n(see Chapters 14 and 24).\n\u2022 Re-use involves finding another use for discarded materials, usually with relatively little modification. Re-\nuse is an attractive waste-management option for the same reasons noted for recycling, but it is even more\neffective at conserving resources because little effort is put into re-manufacturing (other than repairs, if\nnecessary). Re-use is a common practice with discarded furniture, appliances, books, tools, clothes, and\nother consumer products. Increasingly, institutions and industries are finding ways to re-use paper,\ncardboard boxes, other containers, wooden pallets, and other disused materials. Often, re-using networks\nare organized among industries, universities, hospitals, and other institutions, because \u201cwaste\u201d materials\nproduced by one partner may be a \u201cresource\u201d for another.\n\u2022 Waste reduction and prevention are not, strictly speaking, waste-management methods. Rather, they are\nintended to reduce the amounts of waste that must be handled by the above methods. Waste reduction and\nprevention include choices by consumers to buy products that are not excessively packaged or that are\nsold in reusable, returnable containers. People can also choose to buy less \u2013to have fewer shoes and items\nof clothing, to own fewer (or no) automobiles, and to adopt other elements of a less consumerist lifestyle.\nIndustries also have many options to reduce or prevent their production of wastes. For example, wood-\nprocessing industries once routinely incinerated or land-filled waste tree bark and sawdust, but today they\nroutinely use them to manufacture pulp or as a source of energy. In fact, some pulp mills now satisfy most\nof their needs for raw fibre by using sawdust and trimmings from nearby sawmills.\nThe various ways of managing waste materials differ greatly in their environmental impacts. In general,\nenvironmental problems associated with the generation and disposal of wastes are lessened by adopting any\nof the following \u201cR\u2019s\u201d into our individual and corporate lifestyles: refuse (waste prevention), reduce, reuse, and\nrecycle.\nImage 25.3. Solid-waste management is an important function carried out by municipal governments.\nThis image shows a pile of discarded material placed at the curbside for collection. Much of this\n700 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology material could have been recycled, but instead it will be land-filled. Source: B. Freedman.\nMunicipal Solid Waste\nMunicipal solid waste (MSW) is generated by households, businesses, and institutions such as schools and\nhospitals. The components of MSW are extremely diverse, but they do not include sewage sludge (discussed\nin the following section) or waste generated by heavy industry. Until fairly recently, all MSW was disposed in\n\u201copendumps,\u201dapracticethatmaystilloccurinsmallercommunitiesinCanadaandinpoorerpartsoftheworld.\nUsually,anopendumpislocatedinarelativelyout-of-the-waynaturalbasin,suchasalake,wetland,orother\nlowarea,whichisgraduallyin-filledwithwaste.Manyenvironmentaldamagesareassociatedwithopendumps,\nincludingthepollutionofgroundwaterandsurfacewaterbytoxicleachate,foulsmells,smokefromopenburns\nused to decrease the volume of garbage, populations of pest animals, and terrible aesthetics.\nIn the 1920s, engineers began to design sanitary landfills, where MSW is dumped, compacted by heavy\nmachines (such as bulldozers), and covered with about 10 cm of clean dirt at the end of each day. This\nreduces odours and populations of rodents, gulls, insects, and other pests. Sanitary landfills became common\nin developed countries during the 1940s, and advanced variations are now used by Canadian municipalities\n(althoughnotbyallsmallertownsandvillages).Modernsanitarylandfillsincludethefollowingelementsintheir\nconstruction:\n\u2022 one or several impervious linings of clay, plastic, or concrete that prevent the downward leaching of water\nwith high concentrations of ammonium, metals, and other toxic chemicals\n\u2022 a cutoff wall of concrete or another impervious material around the edge of the landfill to prevent the\nsideways migration of polluted water\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 701 \u2022 a system of pipes and gravel drains to collect leachate for treatment before the water is released into the\nenvironment\n\u2022 a system of piping to collect methane, a greenhouse gas produced by anaerobic decomposition of organic\nmatter in the landfill, which can be burned to produce electricity or heat In spite of these advanced design\nelements, residual problems of groundwater and surface water contamination and methane emissions to\nthe atmosphere may still occur.\nAnotherwayofdisposingofMSWistoincinerateit.Duringthenineteenthcentury,somecitiesburnedmuchof\ntheirorganicgarbageusingcrudefacilitiesknownascrematorsorcone-shapedteepee-burners.However,these\ncausedintenselocalpollutionandwerereplacedbytheland-fillingofMSW.Beginninginthe1930s,somecities\nbuiltmore-efficientburningfacilitiescalledincinerators,butthesewerealsodirtyandmostwereshutdownby\nthelate1960s.However,beginninginthe1970s,muchcleanerincineratorswerebuilt,knownaswaste-to-energy\nor resource recovery facilities.

Source: Data from Statistics Canada\n(2007).\n702 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology Almost all Canadian municipalities are taking steps to reduce the amount of discarded material that must be\nland-filled or incinerated. The typical content of residential waste in Canada is:\n\u2022 40% organics, such as compostable food wastes\n\u2022 40% recyclable materials, such as metal and plastic containers\n\u2022 10% bulky goods, such as disused furniture, which can often be re-used or re-purposed\n\u2022 10% other goods, much of which is also potentially recyclable or otherwise diverted from the disposal\nstream\nMost towns and cities are developing systems to divert material away from the waste stream and they are\nachievingincreasingsuccessindoingthat.Forexample,thefollowingcitieshaveachievedsignificantdiversions\nof residential MSW from landfills, mostly by instituting various kinds of recycling programs (FCM, 2009; plus\ndirect reports from municipal governments):\n\u2022 Vancouver, BC, 58%\n\u2022 Nanaimo, BC, 64%\n\u2022 Edmonton, AB, 60%\n\u2022 Saskatoon, SK, 40%\n\u2022 Hamilton, ON, 44%\n\u2022 Owen Sound, ON, 51%\n\u2022 Toronto, ON, 53%\n\u2022 Victoriaville, QC, 64%\n\u2022 Sherbrooke, QC, 54%\n\u2022 Halifax, NS, 59%\n\u2022 Charlottetown, PE, 60%\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 703 Toronto diversion rate of 53% factors in by both single-family homes and multi-unit residential buildings (>9\nunits). In 2013, residents of single-family homes had a diversion rate of 68%, but those in multi-unit buildings\nonly 26%. Clearly, in this and all cases of MSW diversion in Canada, there is a lot that can yet be accomplished.\nMunicipal Wastewater Treatment\nIssuesassociatedwithmunicipalwastewaterincludeitsamountandcomposition,waysoftreatingthematerial,\nand ecological effects of its disposal. First, we should distinguish among major kinds of wastewater.\n\u2022 Sewage is wastewater that contains the fecal matter of humans and other animals, plus food waste from\nkitchens and commercial food processing. In urban areas, sewage is collected using a complex system of\nunderground pipes called sanitary sewers, and transported to a central place for treatment and/or\ndisposal.\n\u2022 Industrial wastewater may contain many kinds of liquids, including toxic and hazardous wastes. As was\npreviously noted, toxic waste is poisonous, while hazardous waste may be explosive, flammable, or\ndangerous for other reasons. Many urban areas have separate systems to collect and treat toxic and\nhazardous industrial wastewater.\n\u2022 Stormwater is the runoff of rainfall and snowmelt. In municipal areas, it is typically collected using surface\ndrains that feed into a combined sewage-stormflow system, or using a more advanced drainage system\nthat keeps these wastewaters separate. Stormwater is not as grossly polluted as sewage or industrial\nwastewater, but it does contain significant amounts of fecal material (from pets and wild animals), metals,\nwaste motor oil, road salt, and other substances.\nSewage Treatment\nIn most places, the principal objective of sewage treatment is to reduce the amounts of pathogenic microbes\nandoxygen-consumingorganicmatterthataredisposedofintoreceivingwaterbodies.Inplaceswheresurface\nwaters are vulnerable to eutrophication, sewage may also be treated to reduce the amounts of nutrients,\nespecially phosphorus and nitrogen (see Chapter 20).\nAll towns and cities have networks of underground pipes to collect the sewage effluent from homes,\nbusinesses,institutions,andfactories.(However,low-densityresidentialareasmayhavesepticsystemsinstalled\nat individual homes.) Some municipalities have separate collection systems for sewage and stormwater.\nEventually, all of the wastewater is discharged to the environment, usually into a nearby lake, river, or ocean.\nTo avoid environmental damage, the wastewater should be treated to reduce its pollutant load before it is\ndischarged. However, some towns and cities still dump raw sewage.

(See\nChapter 20 for a description of various sewage-treatment systems.)\nAbout 78% of Canadians were serviced by municipal wastewater treatment systems in 2006 (the rest used\nseptic tanks, other private systems, or lived in municipalities that dump non-treated sewage; Environment\nCanada,2007).Ofthemunicipal populations, 40%wereservicedbytertiarytreatment,38%bysecondary,and\n704 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology 19%byprimary(thesetermsareexplainedinChapter20).Theremaining3%hadtheirsewagedumpeduntreated\ninto the environment. Relatively advanced tertiary systems are used mostly in Ontario and the Prairies.

As a result, the quality of local waterbodies has greatly improved. In\ncontrast, coastal cities, such as St. John\u2019s and Victoria, continue to discharge poorly treated sewage into the\ncoastalocean,relyingon\u201cfreeenvironmentalservices\u201dtodiluteandbiodegradetheireffluents.Environmental\ndamages associated with the discharge of untreated or poorly treated sewage include the following:\n\u2022 the pollution of receiving waters with human fecal pathogens, such as coliform bacteria and viruses, which\nrenders the area unfit for swimming and for use as drinking water\n\u2022 ecological damage caused by the deoxygenation of water and sediment by the decomposition of organic\nwastes, resulting in the deaths of many organisms and the development of foul odours\n\u2022 stimulation of algal blooms through excessive nutrients from sewage effluent\n\u2022 contamination of the environment with persistent, potentially toxic chemicals, such as metals and\norganochlorines\n\u2022 aesthetic damage associated with the presence of sewage waste\nThese environmental damages, which can be severe, are largely avoided if municipalities invest in facilities to\ntreattheirsewage.Becauseofthiswidelyrecognizedfact,allCanadiancitiesandtowns,includingcoastalones,\nwill further upgrade their facilities to treat their wastewater during the next several decades.\nImage 25.4.

Freedman.\nMoretypically,however,urbanhabitatsaredominatedbyalienspecies,whichwereintroducedinvariousways.\nMost non-native plants were introduced in these ways:\n\u2022 as seeds contained in soil carried by ships as ballast, which was dumped in a port when the cargo was\ndischarged (this was particularly important before the twentieth century)\n\u2022 as seeds that contaminated the seedstock of crop plants (this is now less of a problem because weed seeds\nare \u201ccleaned\u201d from commercial seedstock)\n\u2022 or as plants used in agriculture, forestry, or horticulture. Some alien plants have found good habitat in\nurban areas, where they thrive and out-compete native species. These invasive aliens are an important\necological problem and can be regarded as a kind of \u201cbiological pollution\u201d (see Chapters 1 and 26).\nNon-nativeanimalsarealsocommoninurbanareas.Some,suchasthehousemouse(Musmusculus)andNorway\nrat(Rattusnorvegicus),wereintroducedaccidentallywhentheyescapedfrominfestedshipsandcargoes.Others\nwere deliberately introduced. For example, the rock dove (pigeon; Columba livea), starling (Sturnus vulgaris),\nand house sparrow (Passer domesticus) were introduced by a nineteenth-century society of gentlemen who\nwerededicatedtobringingallofthebirdsmentionedintheplaysofWilliamShakespearetoNorthAmerica.Of\nthevariousspeciesthatthesemisguidednaturalistsattemptedtointroduce,onlythesethreehaveestablished\nwidespread populations.\nMany alien species now have wild, self-maintaining populations in urban areas. Examples of these invasive\nplants and animals and the ecological problems that are associated with them include the following:\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 707 \u2022 The dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is a perennial, herbaceous plant that was originally native to alpine\nhabitat in Europe, but now occurs in temperate regions throughout the world, probably having been\nintroduced in marine ballast. The dandelion is considered an important weed of lawns and pastures.\n\u2022 Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum) is a perennial, herbaceous plant that grows up to 2-m tall and\nis native to Japan. It has attractive foliage and was widely introduced for horticultural use. It can be invasive\nin disturbed areas.\n\u2022 The sticky touch-me-not (Impatiens glandulifera) is an annual wildflower native to the Himalayas. It was\nintroduced through horticulture and can be invasive in gardens and wetlands.\n\u2022 Goutweed (Aegopodium variegatum) is a perennial, herbaceous plant native to Eurasia that was widely\nintroduced through horticulture and is invasive in gardens and other disturbed habitats.\n\u2022 Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is a perennial, herbaceous plant of Eurasia that was introduced\nthrough ships\u2019 ballast and horticulture and is a serious invader of wetlands.\n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a perennial, herbaceous plant of Europe that was introduced\nprobably through marine ballast and is now a serious weed of pastures that causes a photosensitivity\ndisease in cattle.\n\u2022 Norway maple (Acer platanoides) is a native tree of Europe that was introduced for horticultural use. It\ninvades natural hardwood forest.\n\u2022 The oriental cockroach (Blatta orientalis) is an insect native to eastern Asia. It was probably introduced\naccidentally with ship cargo and is a serious pest in homes and other places where food is stored.\n\u2022 The garden snail (Cepaea hortensis) is a terrestrial mollusk native to Europe. It was probably accidentally\nintroduced with marine ballast and is a garden pest in some regions.\n\u2022 The house mouse and Norway rat are rodents native to Eurasia that were accidentally introduced from\nships and are now serious pests in homes and other places where food is stored.\n\u2022 The starling, rock dove, and house sparrow are songbirds native to Eurasia that were introduced by\nEuropean settlers in the Americas who were anxious to have familiar species from their homeland. They\ndisplace native birds from nesting sites and are invasive pests.\nThese and other free-living, alien species are the most abundant plants and animals in Canadian urban areas.\nOf course, the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), domestic cat (Felis catus), and other pets are also common\nnon-natives in our cities and towns. (Even though Aboriginal peoples have lived in the Americas for at least\n12-thousand years, the human species might also be considered non-indigenous to these continents.)\nThecharacteristicsofvariousurbanecosystemshavebeenstudiedinCanada.Manyurbanhabitatsarehighly\ndisturbedandaremanagedtokeeptheminanearlystageofsuccession.Urbanlawns,forexample,aremown\nfrequently to prevent their vegetation from developing beyond a stage that is dominated by low-growing,\nherbaceous plants.

Characteristics of the Urban Forest in Halifax. Tree density and biomass are shown for\nstands of urban forest in different kinds of neighbourhoods. The data for natural forest are for rural\nmature hardwood stands. Source: Freedman et al. (1996).\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 709 The majority of trees in urban forests are alien species (Table 25.2). In the oldest residential area sampled in\nHalifax, 72% of the trees were non-native, the most common being Norway maple (Acer platanoides), linden\n(Tilia europaea), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Scotch elm (Ulmus glabra), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia).\nAn eight-year-old residential neighbourhood hadamuchlarger percentage of native trees (about 92%), which\nhad survived the clearing of the natural forest when the suburb was developed. However, most of the local\n710 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology homeowners were choosing alien species for their horticultural plantings, so their prominence will increase\nrapidly as the neighbourhood ages.\nTable25.2.ProminentStreetTreesinSelectedCanadianCities.Thedatashowthefrequencyoftheseven\nmostabundantspeciesgrowinginurbanforestsoffourcities.Frequencyisgivenasthepercentageofthe\ntotalnumberoftrees,andOriginis:(N)nativetoNorthAmericaor(I)introduced.Source:Datacompiled\nfrom municipal governments.\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 711 Thedisplacementofnativeplantsbyalienonesresultsinimportantecologicaldamage,especiallyiftheforeign\nonesbecomeinvasive.Someecologistsbelievethathorticulturistsshouldplacemuchgreateremphasisonthe\nuse of native plants, rather than risk the serious problems associated with biological \u201cpollution\u201d by aliens.\nThe urban forest provides many useful ecological services. For example, large amounts of carbon are stored\ninurbantrees,whichhelpsoffsetsomeemissionsofCO2fromthecombustionoffossilfuels.Urbanparksand\nwell-treed residential areas can store as much carbon in tree biomass as can a natural forest (Table 25.8).

A well-\ndeveloped urban forest also provides habitat for lower-growing plants and for animals in built-up areas.\nAnother study in Halifax also examined the non-tree vegetation (Turner et al., 2005). In an older residential\nneighbourhood, 87% of the low-growing species were aliens as were 84% of the shrubs and trees. Even in a\nrecentsuburbandevelopment,whichstillhadremnantsofnativehabitat,77%ofthelowvegetationand69%of\nthewoodyplantswerealiens.Theseobservationsarenotparticularlysurprisinginlightoftheresultsofsurveys\nof commercial horticultural businesses in the study area, which offered few or no native plants for sale.\nImage25.7.Urbanbiodiversitycanbepleasant,butitisoftenmanagedinahighlycontrivedmannerand\nis dominated by alien plants and animals.

Some waterfowl may remain during the winter if open water is present. Urban\nbirders from Victoria to St. John\u2019s often spend time viewing the numerous native ducks, geese, swans, gulls,\nshorebirds, and other migrating and wintering birds in local aquatic habitats.

The key to sustaining\npopulations of native animals in urban areas is to maintain as much relatively natural habitat as possible,\ndominatedby indigenous plants. If this is done, even inner-city backyards can provide habitatfor some native\nanimals.Thisfunctionisenhancedbythedeliberatenaturalizationofurbanhabitatsbygrowingnativeplantsin\nhorticulture (see In Detail 25.2).\nIn Detail 25.2. Urban Naturalization. Urban naturalization is a \u201cnew\u201d horticultural practice that favours\nthe use of native plants to achieve pleasing aesthetics in gardening. It is a more natural alternative to\nconventional horticulture, in which there is a very strong preference for the cultivation of alien plants.\nNaturalizationavoidsmanyoftheecologicalproblemsthatareassociatedwithgrowingaliens,whichcan\nbecomeinvasiveanddamagenaturalhabitatsandmaybevectorsofdeadlydiseasesofnativespecies(see\nChapter 26).\nBut what is meant by terms such as \u201cnative\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d? In the sense intended here, and in the\ncontext of the Americas, a native (indigenous) species is one that was present in an ecoregion before\nabout1500(thatis,inpre-Columbiantimes).Ifaspecieswasintroducedafterward,eitherdeliberatelyor\naccidentally,andthendevelopedself-maintainingpopulations,itwouldbeconsidered\u201cnaturalized\u201dbut\nnotindigenous(theymayalsobe\u201cinvasivealiens\u201diftheycauseecologicaldamage).\u201cNaturalcommunities\u201d\nareconsideredtobeself-organizing,co-evolvedassemblagesofnativespeciesthatoccurinhabitatsthat\nare appropriate for their survival.\nBecause many native plants are beautiful and can grow well in habitats provided by gardens, they\ncanbeeasilyusedinhorticulture.Infact,theymaydoverywellbecausetheyarepre-adaptedtolocal\nclimate,soil,andotheraspectsofthehabitat.Theymaybegrownincontrivedbutpleasingarrangements\noffloweringplants,shrubs,andtrees,asiscommonlydoneinhorticulture,ortheymaybemanagedto\ncreate a facsimile of a natural community.\nIfnaturalizationisusedtoreplaceconventionalhorticulturalhabitats,suchaslawnsandgardensthat\naredominatedbyalienspecies,itwillresultinareasbeingbettersuitedtosupportnativebirdsandother\nanimals.Thiskindofgardeningcancreatebeautifulspaces,butithasamuchsofterecologicalfootprint.\nAlthough naturalized gardens are still uncommon, they are attracting increasing attention from people\nseeking to express a more natural view of their world.\nConclusions\nUrbanecosystemssustainhumans,associatednon-nativeorganisms,andsomenativespeciesandremnantsof\nnatural habitats. However, urban ecosystems are ecological \u201cislands\u201d that draw upon the surrounding region\ntocontinuouslysupplyimmensequantitiesofnaturalresourcesandtoassimilatewastes.Agreatchallengefor\nurban ecologists is to develop a better understanding of the structure and function of the urban\u2013industrial\ntechno-ecosystem,includingtheexchangesofmaterialsandenergyandthefactorsthataffectbiodiversity.This\nknowledge can help to identify ecologically pathological relationships, which can then be mitigated to reduce\ntheurban\u2013industrialfootprint.Ifthisisdone,thenmoderncitiescanbecomemoreecologicallysustainablethan\nis now the case.\n714 | Chapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology Questions for Review\n1. What changes were important in the development of urban places during the socio-cultural evolution of\nour species?\n2. What is an ecological footprint? What are its key components?\n3. Characterize the urban ecosystem of your community in terms of its structural (such as species and\nhabitats) and functional (resource use, waste generation) attributes.\n4. What are major differences between urban and rural biodiversity?\nQuestions for Discussion\n1. Make a list of factors that are important in the ecological footprint of your community. How might these be\nchanged in order to decrease the size of the footprint?\n2. Why do so few people use a bicycle as their routine means of transportation, in spite of its mechanical\nefficiency and low cost?\n3. How does your lifestyle contribute to pollution of your environment?\n4. Define the following terms: dumping (disposal), incineration, recycling, composting, reuse, and waste\nproduction and prevention. What role does each of these play in waste management in your community?\n5. What are the major practices used to treat urban sewage? Why have some cities chosen to treat their\nsewage in an environmentally responsible way, while others have not?\n6. Characterize the principal elements of urban biodiversity in your neighbourhood. How could habitats be\nnaturalized in order to support more indigenous species?\n7. Use the footprint calculator provided by the Global Footprint Network (an environmental organization) to\ncalculate your ecological footprint. (Go tohttp://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/\npersonal_footprint/) Try doing a \u201cvirtual experiment\u201d by varying aspects of your lifestyle in the calculator\nto see what effect it has on your personal footprint. For example, see what happens if you ride a bike, use\npublic transit, or fly in an airplane.\nExploring Issues\n1. Your municipal government has hired you to provide advice as it seeks ways to make the community\nfunction in a less damaging, more sustainable manner. What studies would you undertake to determine\nways by which urban functions (such as transportation, sewage treatment, and management of solid\nmaterials and wastes), land-use patterns, and biodiversity can be improved to contribute to the goal of\nsustainability? What do you think your recommendations would be?\nChapter 25 ~ Urban Ecology | 715 References Cited and Further Reading\nAmerican Public Transportation Association (APTA). 2014.

War is waged to achieve political objectives, or as stated by the German military\ntheorist,CarlvonClausewitz(1780-1831)inhisfamousbookOnWar(1832):\u201cWaristhecontinuationofnational\npolicy by other means.\u201d In modern times, the adversaries in warfare are typically well-armed with lethal\nweaponry.Theresultsofaconflictoftenincludethewidespreaddestructionoftheinfrastructureofthewarring\nparties, much loss of human life, a great disruption of society, and severe environmental damage. Militarism\nrefers to a belief of people or governments in the need to maintain a strong military capability to defend\nor promote national interests. The implementation of war-oriented policies results in enormous amounts of\nresourcesbeingdivertedtobuildingandmaintainingamartialcapabilityintheformofarmedforcesandtheir\nequipment and other infrastructure. The absence of war is referred to as peace, during which time society\ntypically has a focus on improving socioeconomic and environmental conditions, rather than on preparing for\nconflict. In reality, however, the conditions of peace and war may each vary enormously and even overlap to\nsome degree (Figure 26.1).\nFigure 26.1. The spectrum of peace and combat.

Biologists studying the behaviour of these animals in the wild have observed\ninstancesofgroupsofrelatedmaleindividualsdeliberatelyengaginginviolentandsometimeslethalraidsagainst\na neighbouring troop, particularly against other males. This activity could be likened to non-human warfare,\nalbeit at a small scale.

Animals may also compete in violent ways to secure access to scarce food or other resources.\nHowever,iftheseaggressivebehavioursareoccurringascontestsbetweenparticularindividualstheywould\nnot be considered to represent warfare, a term that should be limited to acts engaged in by organized groups\nhavingacommonpurpose.VonClausewitz(1832)definedwarinthisway:\u201cWaristhusanactofforcetocompel\nour enemy to do our will.\u201d\nIn our own species, it is likely that the earliest pre-historic conflicts were between extended family groups\n(or clans) that were engaged in a subsistence economy of hunting and gathering, who may have fought over\naccesstofoodorotherresources.However,becauseoflowpopulationdensitiesthoseconflictsmayhavebeen\nratherinfrequent.Interestingly,thereisnoactualevidenceinancientarchaeologicalrecordsofsuchaggression\noccurring amongst hunting-and-gathering people, such as the in the cave paintings of Lascaux, France and\nelsewhere,whichinsteadfocusondepictionsofanimalsbeinghuntedasfood.Nevertheless,itishardtoimagine\nthat conflicts between neighbouring bands of people did not sometimes occur.\nAshumanculturalevolutionprogressed,theclashesbetweensmallgroupsofpeoplewouldhaveprogressed\nto bigger conflicts involving neighbouring communities and cultures. By 10-12-thousand years ago, many\narchaeologicalsitesincluderemainsofrelativelyadvancedweaponssuchasbowandarrow,mace,andsling,all\nof which could have been used in human conflicts as well as for hunting.\nOf course, the scale and intensity of warfare have increased enormously since those early days. Wars\nprogressed into conflicts between city-states, and then between nation-states and often their coalitions.\nCumulative improvements of technology have resulted in the development of increasingly destructive and\nsophisticated weapons, and the rapid growth of both populations and economies during the past several\ncenturies have resulted in a gigantic scale of military capability.\nToday, modern warfare potentially involves a contest with the potential to achieve an equivalent of\nArmageddon, a Biblical metaphor for a conflict so destructive that it represents the end of civilization. In the\nAbrahamicreligions,ArmageddonwasaplacementionedinRevelation16:16wheretherewasanenormousbattle\nthatresultedintheendoftheworld.Indeed,anyenthusiasticuseofthearsenalsofadvancedweaponryoftoday,\nand particularly the nuclear arsenals of several countries, could result in an end-of-times outcome.\nOf all the possible damages that humans might cause to their own civilization and to the biosphere, an all-\nout nuclear war would certainly result in the worst possible destruction. To paraphrase the poet T.S. Eliot\n(1888-1965): this is the way the world could end, not with a whimper but a bang.\nCauses of War and Other Hot Conflicts\nWarsoccurbecauseonepartydecidesthatitsgoalsarebest(oronly)securedthroughtheuseofforcerather\nthan through other means (such as diplomacy), and because the other party is prepared to employ force to\nresist.Thosegoalsmayinvolvevitalnationalinterests,ortheymaybeinspiredbysomecombinationofpolitics,\nsocioeconomiccircumstances,orbeliefsfoundedincultureorreligion.Thecausesofwararealwayscomplex,\nbut they may be understood by briefly looking at some examples, which are presented below in chronological\norder.\nDisputes between nation-states (countries) or their coalitionshave been the most common reason for the\n\u201cconventional wars\u201d that are fought by regular armies. These wars are typically fought over national interests,\nsuch as conflicts over territorial boundaries, the imperial ownership of colonies, or rights of access to certain\n720 | Chapter 26 ~ War regionsfortradingortransportation.Theexamplesbelowwereselectedasbeingrelevanttoconflictsinwhich\nCanada or its colonial progenitors were engaged.\n\u2022 The Seven Years\u2019 War was an international conflict that occurred between 1756 and 1763 and involved\nEuropean powers organized into coalitions led by Britain-Prussia or France-Spain. The war was mostly\nabout the control of foreign colonies, but the personal aggrandisement of heads of state was also an\nimportant factor. The conflict occurred in Europe and in various international theatres. In North America it\nresulted in the British securing colonial ownership of New France, a region now consisting of the Maritime\nProvinces and southern Qu\u00e9bec, as well as Spanish Florida and some Caribbean islands.\n\u2022 The War of 1812, which actually took place during 1812 to 1815, was fought between Britain and its proto-\nCanadian colonies and the United States aided by France. It was an offshoot of the Napoleonic Wars of\n1796-1815, a series of conflicts that occurred mostly in Europe and were fought between France and its\nallies and Britain and its own confederates. The War of 1812 was declared by the U.S. for a number of\npolitical and economic reasons \u2013 to lift trade restrictions imposed by the Royal Navy, to stop the forced\nimpressing of American sailors into British naval service, to end British support of Amerindian tribes that\nwere resisting American westward expansion, and to expand its national territory into what is now the\nsouthern regions of the Prairie Provinces.\n\u2022 The First World War (or Great War) of 1914-1918 was a conflict between two large coalitions: the Allies\n(western European countries led by France and Britain, plus Canada and other countries of the British\nCommonwealth, Russia, and later in the conflict Italy and the United States) and the Central Powers (a\nGerman-led group that included Austria-Hungary and Turkey). This war was triggered by the assassination\nof the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, but the ultimate causes are remarkably complex. They are\nlinked to tensions arising from the aspirations of Germany for hegemony (a kind of imperial leadership) in\nEurope, for the Austro-Hungarian empire to eliminate threats to its survival, for national security of all of\nthe participating nations, and for the permanence of colonial empires.\n\u2022 The Second World War of 1939-1945 was an even more widespread conflict between two enormous\ncoalitions. On one side was the Allies, consisting of western European countries ultimately led by Britain,\nplus France, Belgium, Canada and other Commonwealth countries, and beginning in 1941, the Soviet Union\nand the United States. On the other side was the Axis Powers led by Germany and Japan, but also including\nItaly, Romania, and some other countries of eastern Europe. The conflict in Europe was precipitated mostly\nby aggressive German aspirations to politically dominate Europe and beyond, a goal that was partly\ninstigated by lingering frustration with the humiliation and crushing reparations imposed on that country\nas a consequence of its defeat in the First World War. The German intent was to politically dominate\nwestern Europe, and to colonize eastern Europe with large numbers of Germanic settlers. The fever for war\nwas also fuelled by profound differences in socio-political systems between democracies and dictatorships,\nand between capitalism and socialism-communism. A more minor cause was disgust felt by many people in\nthe Allied countries about political and social policies imposed by the Nazi dictatorship in pre-war\nGermany and Austria. Those policies were resulting in severe losses of civil liberties by ethnic groups, other\nsocial minorities, and the political opposition, including their seclusion in concentration camps, where\nmany were forced to work as slaves under starvation conditions, or were mass-murdered.\n\u2022 The First Gulf War of 1990-1991 was instigated when Iraq unexpectedly invaded and took over Kuwait in\nAugust, 1990. The invasion was ostensibly rationalized on the basis of Kuwait once being controlled by Iraq.\nHowever, the real reason for the invasion was Iraq seeking relief from huge debts associated with its recent\nwar with Iran of 1980-1988. Those debts were mostly owed to nearby Arab countries, and a substantial part\ncould be relieved by taking over the government and rich oil fields of Kuwait. Almost immediately, however,\nthe invasion of Kuwait was opposed by a coalition of nations led by the United States and sanctioned by the\nChapter 26 ~ War | 721 United Nations. The public justification for the subsequent war of liberation was based on preserving the\nsanctity of sovereign states \u2013 in particular, that of Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion. However, the key\nunderlying reason was a compelling desire to safeguard the reliability of supply of Middle Eastern\npetroleum to Europe, North America, and Japan. At the time, about 63% of the known recoverable reserves\nof petroleum in the world were in the Middle East (WRI, 1995). Iraq held 11% of the global reserve and when\nit added the Kuwaiti stocks it would have controlled 21%, while also threatening an additional 29% in Saudi\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates. The oil-dependent industrial nations considered it an unacceptable\neconomic threat to have so much of the world\u2019s petroleum controlled by a capricious Iraqi dictatorship led\nby Saddam Hussein. In addition, the governments of various Middle Eastern countries felt threatened by\ntheir own potential invasions by Iraq.\nWarsbetweendifferingculturesarefoughtbecauseofdeepanimositiesassociatedwithdifferentreligionsor\npoliticalideologies.Thesekindsofwarsmayinvolvethearmiesofnation-statesortheymayoccurasrebellions\nor insurrections within a country. Examples include the following:\n\u2022 The American War of Independence (1775-1783), also known as the American Revolution, was fought\nbetween the Imperial forces of Great Britain and an insurgency of many people who were living in what is\nnow the eastern United States. The main cause of the war was an intense difference in political ideology \u2013\nmany of the colonial Americans were dissatisfied at being governed and taxed by a foreign parliamentary\ngovernment without having an effective representation in that administration. In essence, the\nrevolutionaries were seeking the freedom to govern themselves, and they fought to win that right, in the\nprocess founding the United States of America. However, many other Americans of the time did not seek\nliberation from direct rule by Britain, and after the war most of them left the nascent United States, many\nof them immigrating as United Empire Loyalists to what is now eastern Canada.\n\u2022 The French (1789-1799) and Russian (1917) Revolutions were broadly comparable in the sense that both\nstarted as rebellions undertaken with the intent of replacing an absolute monarchy with a system of\ngovernance that was more broadly based on the will of the populace. The monarchs that were replaced\nwere King Louis XVI of France and Tzar Nicholas II of Russia. However, both of these revolutions ushered in\nperiods of profound social and political upheaval that resulted in unstable governments of various kinds,\nranging from temporary re-institution of a monarchy, to dictatorship, to the liberal democratic systems\nthat exist in those countries today. Essentially, these revolutions were socio-political in their nature.\n\u2022 The Korean War of 1950-1953 and the Second Indochina War of 1960-1975 were separate conflicts fought\nfor similar reasons \u2013 irreconcilable differences in the socio-political systems of capitalism and communism,\nand the desire to replace one with the other. The Korean conflict began when communist North Korea,\nlater aided by China and Russia, invaded capitalist South Korea, later aided by the U.S., Canada, and other\nwestern countries. The war in Indochina began as an insurgency in South Vietnam by a communist Viet\nKong guerrilla force, later joined by regular troops of North Vietnam supported logistically by China and\nRussia. These communist forces were resisted by the capitalist government of South Vietnam as well as the\nUnited States and several other western countries (Canada did not fight in this war).\n\u2022 \u201cThe Troubles\u201d was a period of ethnic and political conflict in Northern Ireland that also spilled over into\nviolence in England and the Republic of Ireland. This conflict began in the late 1960s and ended in 1998,\nalthough sporadic violence still occurs. This was a low-grade war between radical factions that differed in\ntwo main attributes: (a) in religion and associated cultural traits (Roman Catholic versus Protestant) and (b)\nin politics, with the nationalist (or republican) Catholics striving to have Northern Ireland join with the\nRepublic of Ireland, and the unionist (or loyalist) Protestants wanting to remain one of the four countries\nthat make up the United Kingdom (along with England, Scotland, and Wales). The fighting consisted mostly\n722 | Chapter 26 ~ War of urban terrorism such as bombings and assassinations by paramilitary organizations of both sides, while\nthe police and armed forces of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland tried to contain the violence\nand maintain social order.\n\u2022 The violence between Hutu and Tutsi peoples in Rwanda, Burundi, and neighbouring countries of central\nAfrica was essentially a result of intense ethnic conflict between these tribal groups. The distinction\nbetween Hutu and Tutsi is mostly one of self-identified cultural affiliation \u2013 people view themselves as\nbeing one or the other, based mostly on their family lineage. Other than that, the groups speak the same\nlanguage and are physically similar (the Tutsi tend to be taller and leaner, but this is not a consistent\ndifference). Regardless of the real or presumed differences, many people in each cultural group had\ndeveloped an intense prejudice against the other, a situation that was made worse by asymmetric power\nstructures in government and other forms of tribal competition. In 1994 this state of affairs culminated in a\nmass murder in Rwanda of more than 500-thousand Tutsis by Hutus over a 3-4-month period. Tutsi forces\nfrom Burundi then invaded Rwanda, and although there are ongoing conflicts in that region of Africa, the\ngenocidal mass killings were ended.\n\u2022 The Kurds are a distinct people of the Middle East, but they do not have a home country. Instead, they live\nin adjoining regions of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey, where the national governments have tended to\nsuppress the Kurdish culture in an attempt to assimilate them into that of the mainstream. However, many\nKurds have nationalist aspirations and these people have engaged in long-running insurgencies with the\nintent of secession to form their own homeland. The Kurds have achieved a substantial degree of self-\ndetermination in northern Iraq, but not elsewhere.\n\u2022 The state of Israel was founded in 1948 as a result of a decision by the United Nations to partition the land\nof Palestine, at the time a British protectorate, into Jewish and Arabic states. Essentially, this was done to\nprovide a country for Jews in their ancestral homeland following a genocide during the Second World War\nduring which about six million were killed (a genocide is the mass killing of an identifiable group as an\nattempted extermination). However, the division was resisted by many of the indigenous Palestinians as\nwell as surrounding Arabic countries. This resulted in a series of wars between Israel and surrounding\ncountries, as well as hot conflicts with Palestinian guerrillas associated with several political factions. The\ncauses of this long-running conflict are complex, but they include reciprocal prejudice and hate between\nadversarial groups based on religion and other cultural differences.\n\u2022 The final example of extreme conflict between cultural groups is an on-going one between radical Islamic\nfundamentalists (Islamists) and \u201cWestern\u201d sociocultural influences. The Islamists are organized into a\nnumber of trans-national paramilitary organizations, such as Al-Qaeda, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\n(ISIS), and the Taliban, who are fighting to oppose western influence in countries where the dominant\nreligion is Islam, while also seeking an ascendancy of the Sunni version of Islam over the Shia and other\nones. The opposing forces include the national governments of all countries where the Islamists are active,\nheavily supported by the \u201cWest,\u201d which consists of relatively developed countries governed by liberal\ndemocracies and epitomized by the United States, and including Canada. The conflict mostly involves\nterrorist actions such as assassinations and bombings of public places, including the catastrophic attacks\nusing hijacked jetliners on September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Towers in New York and the Pentagon in\nWashington. In addition, however, the conflict involves organized Islamist armies fighting against\ngovernmental forces, the latter often aided by international expeditionary forces.\nThese various examples ofwars,chosen fromamultitudeofpossible cases, showthatalethalconflictmaybe\ncausedbyavarietyoftriggers,someoperatingoverlongerperiodsoftimeandothersonashorter-termbasis.In\nallcases,however,thedecisiontoengageinextremeviolenceagainstotherpeopleandtheircultureoreconomy\nisbasedonalogicalinterpretationoftheexistingcircumstances,astheyareunderstoodbyoneorbothofthe\nChapter 26 ~ War | 723 opposingsides.Thelogicitselfmayseemtwistedandirrationaltoanindependentobserver,perhapsonewho\nislesssympathetictojudgementsbasedonracism,xenophobia,andotherintolerances.Nevertheless,allactsof\nextreme violence make a kind of sense to their perpetrators, and that is the fundamental reason why they are\nundertaken.Aswewilllearnintherestofthechapter,theresultsofwarfarecanincludemayhemandmurderat\nextraordinary scales, causing misery to many people and also to the broader environment.\nImage26.1.TheWorldTradeTowersburningonSeptember11,2001.ThetwoWorldTradeTowerswere\nthe tallest buildings in New York and a global symbol of both international commerce and western-\ninfluenced capitalism.

The greatest battlefields were in\nthelowlandsofBelgiumandFrancewheretherewererelativelystaticandlong-lastingconfrontationsbetween\nenormous armies that were well dug-in with extensive trenchworks. Additional large conflicts occurred in\neasternEurope,theMiddleEast,andtheNorthAtlanticOcean.Thetotalnumberofmilitarydeathswasabout\n8.5 million (8.5M), of which the Central Powers lost 5M and the Allies the rest (including 67-thousand (67k)\nCanadians) (White, 2010).

Most of these resulted\nfrom starvation or disease, which were a consequence of severe disruption of the economy and of the\nfunctioningandinfrastructureofcivilizationinaffectedregions.Asinotherwars,theestimatesofciviliandeaths\nare not based on direct counts but rather on calculations of so-called \u201cexcess mortality\u201d, or differences in the\ndeathratebeforeandduringthewar.TheworstlossesofcivilianswereinTurkeyatabout2.2M,Russiaat1.5M,\nItaly1.0M,Austria-Hungary700k,Germany692k,France500k,Serbia450k,Romania430k,andBritain230k.The\ndataforTurkeyincludethevictimsofagenocide directedagainstArmenians inthatcountry,whichitselfmay\nhave killed 1M people.\nBecause of the unprecedented mortality, the First World War was labelled as \u201cthe War to end all wars\u201d, in\nthe expectation that people would never again allow such an avoidable catastrophe to take place. To prevent\nsuch a re-occurrence, the leading countries of the world created an international security organization called\nthe League of Nations whose mission was to maintain world peace, essentially by providing a forum in which\ncountries could work out their differences. Unfortunately, that body was not successful and only two decades\nafter the end of WWI there was an even more extensive conflict, with a loss of life more than twice as large.\nThiswastheSecondWorldWar(1939-1945),whosetwomainbattletheatreswerethroughoutmostofEurope\nand in eastern Asia, with additional areas including the western Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean,\nnorthern Africa, and the Middle East.

The USSR economy collapsed at that time and that Soviet entity devolved into the Russian Federation, and\nthen into separate countries such as Russia, Ukraine, and others. Between 1988 and 1990 its annual military\nspending averaged $299 billion, but in 1992 that deflated to $62B and then further to $21B in 1998 (all in\nconstant 2011 $US; SIPRI, 2015). Spending has increased considerably since then, to $85B in 2013.\n2. There was greatly reduced military spending by the U.S. and its allies as a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d associated with\nthe end of the Cold War. Between 1988 and 1990 the annual U.S. military spending averaged $546 billion,\nbut this was reduced to an average of $386B during 1996-2000 (constant 2011 $US). However, since 2001 the\nU.S. spending has almost doubled as it ramped up expenditures for its \u201cWar on Terror\u201d (to $720B in 2010,\nalthough it since decreased somewhat to $619B in 2013).\nFigure 26.2.

Globally, about 92.6 million people have\nmilitary employment, including 20.6M in the active armed forces, 42.9M in reserve forces, and 29.1M in\nparamilitaryorganizations(Wikipedia,2015).Thelargestforces(activeforces+reserves+paramilitary;2012data)\nareheldbyNorthKorea(7.7M),India(4.8M),China(3.9M),SouthKorea(3.7M),Russia(3.4M),andtheUnitedStates\n(2.2M).

The Armed Forces of Canada Prior to Confederation in 1867, military forces in\nCanada consisted of regular troops of Britain that were assigned to the colony (or prior to 1758, those\nof France), supported by local militias of armed civilians, and sometimes by allied Aboriginal nations\n(Granatstein, 2002;Wikipedia 2015r).Those forces were intendedfor use in defense against aggression\nby other European powers, Aboriginal groups, or American forces (the latter particularly during the\nAmericanRevolutionaryWarof1775to1783,theWarof1812of1812-1814,andtheFenianRaidsof1866to\n1871).Evenforsometimeafter1867theresponsibilityformilitarycommandinCanadawasvestedinthe\nBritishCrownanditscommander-in-chiefforNorthAmerica.Thiswasthecaseuntilthefinalremoval\nof British army and navy units from Canada in 1906.That withdrawal led to the formation of the Royal\nCanadianNavy,CanadianArmy,andRoyalCanadianAirForce.However,eventoday,thenominalheadof\ncommand is still the reigning monarch of Canada, Queen Elizabeth II, as represented by the Governor\nGeneral.\nThe first overseas deployment of Canadian military forces was to support Britain during the Second\nBoer War (1899-1902) in southern Africa. A much larger international commitment occurred in Europe\nduringtheFirstWorldWar(1914-1918),andthenagainduringtheSecondWorldWar(1939-1945).There\nwerealsosignificantparticipationsintheKoreanWar(1950toanarmisticein1953)andinAfghanistan\n(2001-2014). Other foreign engagements have included the First Gulf War (1991), the Kosovo War\n(1998-1999), and various UN-sanctioned peace-keeping missions such as those in Suez (1956-1967) and\nCyprus(1954-present).Intotal,theCanadianforceshaveparticipatedin75internationaloperationssince\n1947.\nChapter 26 ~ War | 731 Canadian defence policy is established by elected political leaders of the Government of Canada, led\nbythePrimeMinisterandtheMinsterofNationalDefence.SincetheendoftheSecondWorldWar,that\npolicy has had three broad objectives: (1) the defence of Canada; (2) the defence of North America in\ncooperationwiththeU.S.;and(3)contributingtointernationalsecurity.DuringtheeraoftheColdWar\nof1946to1991,muchofthedefencepolicywasintendedtocontributetoacollectivesecurityofWestern\nEurope and North America in the face of military threats from the Soviet bloc of communist nations.\nDuringthatperiodsubstantialgroundandairforceswerebasedinWesternEuropeandoperatedwithin\nthecommandstructureoftheNorthAtlanticTreatyOrganization(NATO).FollowingtheendoftheCold\nWar,however,thefocusofNATOhasbeenextendedtointernationalsecurityoperationsinotherparts\nof the world, especially in Afghanistan, the Balkan region, and Libya.\nThepresentdefencepolicyofCanadawasestablishedin2006byanewConservativeGovernment.The\nCanadian military is now being oriented and equipped to fulfill six core missions:\n\u2022 to conduct routine national operations, including in the Arctic regions of Canada, as well as\ncontinental ones through the auspices of the North American Aerospace Defence Command\n(NORAD)\n\u2022 to respond to a major terrorist attack\n\u2022 to support civilian authorities during a crisis caused by a natural disaster in Canada\n\u2022 to conduct a major international operation for an extended period\n\u2022 to deploy forces for a shorter period in response to military or natural crises elsewhere in the world\n\u2022 to provide support to major international events in Canada\nThe Canadian forces are funded at an annual level of about $22.6 billion (in 2013), which ranked 14th\nin the world (Wikipedia. 2015r,s). However, in some years the base funding is augmented to support\nnon-baselineexpensesofnewmissions,suchasthoserecentlyoccurringinAfghanistanandLibya.The\nnumber of regular personnel is about 68-thousand, and there are an additional 51-thousand in reserve\nforces, with the total number ranking 74th in the world.\nThe Government of Canada has embarked on initiatives to build the stocks of military equipment\nand further to improve them with advanced technologies. This program included the acquisition of\nequipment needed for the mission in Afghanistan, such as battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers,\nartillery, and unmanned air drones. There are also initiatives to replace or build the air fleet, including\ntheacquisitionofC-130HerculesandC-17GlobemasterIIItransportaircraft,CH-47Chinookheavy-lift\nhelicopters,andF-35LightningIIJointStrikeFighterjets.Aprocessisalsobeingimplementedtorenew\nthe naval fleet, including the construction of 15 new warships to replace the existing 15 frigates and\ndestroyers, plus 2-3 new support vessels and 6-8 smaller vessels to patrol coastal and arctic waters.\nEnvironmental Damage\nAll wars result in some amount of carnage (deaths) and mayhem (destruction). Of course, this varies\ntremendously depending on the scale of the conflict and the ways that the fighting is conducted. Obviously,\nrelatively small clashes may not cause a lot of environmental damage. At the other end of the spectrum, the\nlargest possible wars, which could involve the use of existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons, would potentially\nobliteratethebiosphere.Thiswouldhappenasaconsequenceoftheimmenseexplosionsaswellastheresulting\n732 | Chapter 26 ~ War catastrophic fires and climatic consequences of the release of enormous amounts of particulates and gases to\nthe atmosphere.\nTheenvironmentaleffectsofwarfarecanbeorganizedintoanumberoftopicareas,including thefollowing\nmajor ones:\n\u2022 the depletion of non-renewable resources such as metals and fossil fuels, and renewable ones such as\nagricultural soil capability and forest cover\n\u2022 environmental and ecological damage by air, soil, and water pollution\n\u2022 the destruction of biodiversity by habitat damage and uncontrolled hunting\n\u2022 damage caused to the infrastructure of society and its economy However, the environmental consequences\nof warfare are exceedingly complex and so they cannot be generalized. Moreover, there have been\nremarkably few studies of environmental damages caused by warfare, even though they can be devastating.\nIn this section we will examine the subject area by looking at information and examples from selected\nconflicts, including potential scenarios for a nuclear war.\nIn fact, a deliberate strategy of war may be to cause intense environmental damage in order to destroy the\neconomiccapacityofanenemy.Thismightbereferredtoasecocide\u2013anattempttocausesevereenvironmental\ndestructionasatacticofwarfare.AnearlysuchactionwasundertakenbyScipioAfricanustheYounger(185-129\nBCE), a Roman consul who defeated the Carthaginians in the Third (and final) Punic War of 146 BCE.

Although enormous quantities of munitions were exploded\nduring these conflicts, there have been remarkably few studies of the non-human environmental damages.\nRather, the focus of research has been on the misery caused to people through deaths and injuries, and the\ndestruction of buildings and other infrastructure. Nevertheless, severe environmental damage was caused in\nmany affected regions, and it is useful to look at some of the obvious indicators of those effects.\nThe World Wars\nTheFirstandSecondWorldWarsarethemostprominentconflictseverwaged,particularlyintermsoftheloss\nof human lives. Both conflicts occurred over widespread areas and caused terrible mortality, destroyed cities,\nand disrupted civilization in many other ways.

They also have not been commonly thought of as important\nimpactsofthesewars,incomparisonwiththehumantragediesthatwerecaused.Despitethatperception,awful\nenvironmental damage was associated with those wars.\nTo some degree the ecological effects of these conflicts can be gained from literary images of the time, a\nnumber of which describe the devastation caused to forests and other ecosystems.

An estimated 120-thousand tonnes of explosives were expended during the conflict,\nalmost all by coalition forces (Barnaby, 1991).

However, the\nevidence for both of those allegations was weak and no proof was ever provided for either of them.

These were deadly gases and vapours\nthat caused devastating injuries to the lungs, such as chlorine, chloropicrin, phosgene, and trichloromethyl\nchloroformate, as well as the skin-blistering agent called mustard gas.

Most of the spraying involved wild habitats such as tropical forest, but\nabout 14% was directed against cropland. The herbicide spraying began in 1961, reached a peak in 1967, and\nwas terminated in 1971. The herbicide used most frequently was a half-and-half mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T\nthatwasknownasAgentOrange,withmorethan46-millionkgbeingused.Becausetheintentionwastocause\nsevere damage to ecosystems, the spray rates were quite high \u2013 about 25 kg/ha or 10-times that with the\nsame herbicides to promote the growth of conifer trees in forestry by reducing the abundance of competing\nvegetation.\nThe ecological damage caused by the defoliation program was so severe that opponents of the spraying\nlabelled it as ecocide, which in this case was the intentional use of anti-environmental actions over a large\nareaasatacticalcomponentofamilitarystrategy(Westing,1976).Becauseherbicidesarepoisonoustoplants,\nextensivetractsofvegetationweredirectlypoisonedbythesprays.However,animalswereindirectlyaffectedby\nthe extensive destruction of habitats, although that damage was never documented in any detail.\nThe most intensive ecological damage was caused to coastal mangrove forest, of which 110-thousand ha\nwere sprayed, or 36% of its area in South Vietnam. Because the dominant tree species of mangrove forest are\nextremely sensitive to herbicides, the spraying devastated the ecosystem and created large areas of muddy\nbarrens.Bytheearlytomid-1980s,thesprayedareasofmangroveshadsubstantiallyrevegetated.However,the\nhabitats were degraded in species composition, with the more valuable red mangrove (Rhizophora apiculata)\nbeing less abundant than originally. To some degree this problem was alleviated by planting seedlings of red\nmangrove over extensive areas.\nSeveredamagewasalsocausedtovariouskindsofuplandtropicalforest,whichwereextensivelydevastated\nbytheherbicidespraying.Thesprayingofcroplandscausedgreatdamagetofoodproductioninareascontrolled\nby enemy forces, and there were reports of illness or death of domestic livestock.\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the herbicide spraying was the contamination of the 2,4,5-T by\na dioxin known as TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). (Dioxins are is a range of compounds that are\ncharacterized by the presence of a heterocyclic 6-membered ring, in which two carbon atoms are substituted\nby oxygen atoms. TCDD is considered the most toxic compound in the dioxin series. It is most famous as a\ncontaminantinAgentOrangeandinthecontextofalargeindustrialreleasein1976atSeveso,Italy.)TheTCDD\nin the 2,4,5-T was an inadvertent by-product of the process by which the herbicide was manufactured, and it\noccurredinaconcentrationashighas45ppmbutaveraging2.0ppm(Westing,1982;Freedman,1995).Asmuch\nas 170 kg of TCDD was sprayed with herbicide onto Vietnam.\nTCDDisknowntobeextremelytoxictomanykindsofanimals,andevenatsmalldosesitcausesbirthdefects\nandmiscarriagesinlaboratorymammals.However,thetoxicityofTCDDtopeopleislesswellunderstood.The\nmostcommonlyreportedsymptomofanintenseexposureisaskinconditionknownaschloracne,whichappears\nsimilar to severe adolescent acne but is more severe and persistent.

Nuclear fusion also fuels the extraordinary energy\nproduction in stars, but no technology exists to control the reaction for commercial energy production. In a\n742 | Chapter 26 ~ War hydrogen bomb, a fission explosion is used to create such enormous heat and density that the conditions are\nsufficient to cause hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium, a slightly heavier element, and in the process release\nimmenseenergyasagiganticexplosion.Fusionbombshaveanextremelyhighyield,rangingupto50MtofTNT\nequivalent.\nThe largest nuclear bombs are referred to as strategic weapons; they have an explosive yield of 0.60 Mt or\nmoreandaredesignedtobedeliveredbyamissileorairplaneoveradistanceofthousandsofkilometres.So-\ncalledtacticalweaponsaremuchsmallerandmorenumerous;theyareintendedtobeusedinalocalbattlefield,\nhave a yield of less than 0.20 Mt, and are delivered by smaller missiles, artillery, aircraft, or torpedoes.

This has occurred partly because of a series of international treaties that were brokered by the United\nNations, beginning with the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, then the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in\n1968, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 (note, however, that not all countries with\nnuclearweaponshavesignedonto,ratified,orrespectedthesevarioustreaties)(Wikipedia,2015m).Evenmore\nimportant,however,beginningin1972therehavebeenaseriesofbilateralnuclear-reductionagreementssigned\nbetween the U.S. and Russia (representing the former Soviet Union), most recently the New Strategic Arms\nReduction Treaty of 2010, that have resulted in large and verified reductions in the weapons held in their\narsenals. The changes in nuclear arsenals are shown in Figure 26.6. Between 1985 and 2013 the global nuclear\narsenal decreased by about 72%, almost entirely because of large reductions by the U.S. and Russia.\nFigure 26.6. Changes in global nuclear arsenals.

The island was\nobliterated by the blast and transformed into a water-filled crater. Although the vegetation on Belle Island\nsuffered radiation damage after the detonation, an apparently complete recovery was made within only six\nmonths. This observation suggests that at least some biota that survives a nearby above-ground nuclear\nexplosion may have considerable resilience and an ability to recuperate from the disturbance.\nConsequences of a Nuclear War\nTosomedegreethedestructionthatwouldbecausedbynuclearbombscanbepredictedbasedonobservations\nmadeduringtestexplosionsofvariousmagnitude,andalsoontheresultsofcomputer-basedmodelsofphysical\nprocesses.Whenanuclearbombisexploded,about40-54%oftheenormousreleaseofenergytypicallyoccurs\nasablastwave,30-50%asthermalradiation,and5-7%asionizingradiation(Westing,1977;Wikipedia,2015o).To\nmaximizethedamagecaused,strategicweaponswouldlikelybeexplodedintheloweratmosphere,ataheight\nless than 1,000 m, which results in less of the energy being absorbed by the ground.\nInalarge-scaleexchangeofstrategicnuclearweaponsnotallofthearsenalofthewarringpartieswouldbe\nsuccessfully delivered.

It was predicted that the\nexplosionsandfireswouldresultintheinjectionof330-825milliontonnesoffineparticulatesand180-300Mt\nof sooty smoke into the atmosphere, much of which would enter the stratosphere and so would be extremely\npersistent ((NRC, 1985; Stephens and Birks, 1985).

Moreover, it is\nembedded in the teachings of major religions. This is exemplified by the following quotation from the Old\nTestament of the Bible (Isaiah 2, 4; New American Standard Bible):\nAndHewilljudgebetweenthenations,Andwillrenderdecisionsformanypeoples;Andtheywillhammer\ntheir swordsintoplowshares and their spearsintopruning hooks.

This has been especially true of wars of the\npast century, which have been characterized by increasingly sophisticated and destructive weapons that are\ncommonly directed against civilians in addition to enemy combatants. Because of an increasingly widespread\nrecognitionofthedreadfulconsequencesofwars,powerfulsocialforceshavebecomeengagedindoingwhatis\npossible to prevent conflicts from occurring.\nTheseanti-warforcesoperatewithinallcountries,butareespeciallypowerfulinliberaldemocraciesbecause\npeople and organizations under that political system are allowed to freely express their views, so long as they\ndosoinwaysthatarenon-violentandotherwiselegal.Inthissense, liberaldemocracymayitselfberegarded\nasaforceforpeace,becauseitfostersanopendiscourseaboutthehealthandillsofsociety,includingwhether\nitisnecessarytoengageinviolentconflictstoresolveissuesthatcouldpotentiallyberesolvedbyanegotiated\nsettlement.\nIn fact, because of wide recognition of the appalling consequences of warfare, governments have worked\ntogethertoinstitutevariousinternationalmechanismsforresolvingconflictsamongnations.Someoftheseare\nbinational or multinational treaties and other agreements among particular countries, while others are global\nin scope and have been implemented under the auspices of the United Nations. Key international agreements\nrelativetothepreventionormitigatedconductofwarincludethefollowing(Wikipedia,2015p):1919\u2013Covenant\nof the League of Nations (this was the founding of the League of Nations, which in 1945 was replaced by\nthe United Nations) 1929 \u2013 Third Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (updated\nin 1949) 1945 \u2013 Charter of the United Nations (the founding of the United Nations) 1949 \u2013 Fourth Geneva\nConventionrelativetotheProtectionofCivilianPersonsinTimeofWar(aUNtreaty)1951\u2013Conventiononthe\nPreventionandPunishmentoftheCrimeofGenocide(UN)1963\u2013LimitedTestBanTreaty(UN)1968\u2013Nuclear\nNon-proliferation Treaty (UN) 1972 \u2013 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (UN) 1972 \u2013 Biological and Toxin Weapons\nConvention(UN)1991\u2013TreatyonConventionalArmedForcesinEurope(nationsoftheNorthAmericanTreaty\nOrganization and the Warsaw Pact) 1991 \u2013 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (U.S. and Russia) 1993 \u2013 Chemical\nWeapons Convention (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) 1996 \u2013 Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty(UN)1996\u2013Anti-Personnel Mine BanConvention(UN)2002\u2013StrategicOffensiveReductions\nTreaty (U.S. and Russia) 2010 \u2013 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (U.S. and Russia)\nInadditiontothesesortsofinternationalagreements,theUnitedNationsandotherorganizationssometimes\nundertake actions to prevent or end local or regional conflicts. Within that context, peace-making refers to\nthe enforced resolution of an active or potential conflict, often by establishing a balanced power relationship\namongthepartieswhilealsoimposingaprocesstoachieveanegotiatedsettlement.Peace-makingmayproceed\nthroughnegotiationsinvolvingthepartiesinconflict,butifthatdoesnotworkitmayrequiremilitaryactionto\ncreate a more symmetrical power structure so that neither side has a strong advantage.\nExamples of peace-making actions include several imposed settlements of conflicts that arose after the\nbreak-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia beginning in 1991, which eventually resulted in the\nformationofanumberofcountries:BosniaandHerzegovina,Croatia,Kosovo,Macedonia,Montenegro,Serbia,\nand Slovenia. The wars of secession associated with the break-up resulted in several peace-making actions to\nstoptheviolence.Forexample,whentherelativelypowerfularmedforcesandmilitiasofSerbiaengagedinwar\nmeasures to prevent the secession of the province of Kosovo, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nengagedinaselectivebombingcampaignthatforcedakind-ofpeace(Canadawasaparticipantinthatmission).\n750 | Chapter 26 ~ War Kosovo is now a self-proclaimed republic, although its governance is controlled by the United Nations and its\nindependence is not recognized by Serbia.\nPeace-keeping is anaction thatoccursafterahotconflicthasstoppedthroughacease-fireagreement,but\nthe conditions for a lasting peace are not yet in place so various means must be used to keep the antagonists\napart. Peace-keepers may do their work by monitoring the movement and actions of armed forces in post-\nconflict areas and by otherwise assisting in the implementation of peace agreements, sometimes by enforcing\nprovisionsofacease-fire.TheUNhasapeace-keepingprogramthathasbeenactiveinvariousconflictzones\nin Africa, eastern Europe, and the Middle East (Canada participated in several of these missions, which are\ncharacterized by personnel wearing helmets or berets of a light-blue colour). Some peace-keeping actions\nhavebeenremarkablylong-lasting, suchastheonethathasbeeninplaceinCyprussince1964.Thesevarious\ninternationalmechanismshaveallbeenextremelyhelpfulinpreventingwars,orinmakingthemlesswidespread\nor destructive.\nThere are also powerful social movements against war. These involve non-governmental organizations that\nprotest against militarism or the engagement of their own or other countries in specific conflicts. There are\nalso less-organized movements that conduct protest marches, hold sometimes large public assemblies, and\nundertakeotherkindsofanti-waradvocacy.Forexample,theGreenpeaceorganizationwasformedinVancouver\nin 1971to protest against a U.S. nuclear-weapon test on the Aleutian island of Amchitka. Soon afterward,\nGreenpeace developed a broader interest in environmental issues and its programs and actions became\ninternational in scope. Today, many anti-war NGOs operate internationally and in most countries (Wikipedia.\n2015q), including the Canadian Peace Alliance and Ceasefire Canada.\nTherearealsomorebroadlybasedforcesforpeace,whichoperateatagrandersocietalleveltomakedeadly\nconflicts less likely:\n\u2022 Democracy is a political system with numerous faults, but if properly implemented it assures the basic\nfreedoms of people and so helps to avoid many of the kinds of discrimination that can result in the extreme\ndiscontent that may lead to insurrection or revolution. Democracy also allows for an open discussion about\nthe size, capabilities, role, and purposes of the military sector of society.\n\u2022 Equitable opportunities of people living within a society, and also among countries, help to diffuse tensions\nassociated with gross and unfair inequalities of wealth, lifestyle, and access to health services, education,\nand cultural and recreational amenities. All people, including those living in poor countries, have a right to\nexpect a decent standard of living and quality of life. It is difficult to build a prosperous and peaceful world\nif there are gross inequalities among people.\n\u2022 Open and respectful communications are essential to helping parties understand opposing views and to\nfind ways of accommodating differences of opinion or aspiration that may exist between nation-states,\ncultures, and other groups. Helpful exchanges of information include liaisons among cultural and national\ngroups of people, politicians, and even the leadership of military forces.\n\u2022 Reduced militarism is related to modifying the attitude of the political leaders of nations about the degree\nto which their society must be prepared for potential conflicts, and the amount of spending that is\nnecessary for such purposes. If governmental priorities resulted in fewer resources being expended to\nmaintain armed forces, arsenals, and other military infrastructure, then more would be available to support\nsocial programs related to health, education, culture, and other needs of society. However, such\napproached must be balanced against the degree of militarism exhibited by other countries within the\ncommunity of nations.\n\u2022 Anti-war cultural attributes also help to foster a widespread antipathy against violent conflicts. This is\naccomplished by documentaries, movies, novels, paintings, poems, sculptures, songs, websites, and\neducational curricula that take anti-war stances and help people to understand that peace is a desirable\nChapter 26 ~ War | 751 alternative to violent conflict.\n\u2022 Empowerment of a comprehensive United Nations potential for peace-making and peace-keeping would\nmean that only the most determined antagonists would be able to escalate tensions to outbreaks of war.\nThe UN is limited to authorizing those functions, which must then be carried out by willing member-\nnation. However, with improved funding and a stronger mandate the UN could be empowered to prevent\nmore conflicts than it is now possible for it to do.\n\u2022 Cooperative security is an idea that is not yet sufficiently recognized by the nation-states and cultures of\nthe world, all of whom have a large stake in avoiding warfare and should collaborate more effectively to\navoid it.\n\u2022 Ecological sustainability is another force for peace. If it is attained then economic and environmental\ndifficulties associated with non-sustainability would place fewer strains on the internal and international\nrelations of countries, which are often a prelude to conflict. In essence, the global economy must be\nbalanced against the capability of the world to provide flows of resources, while also maintaining the ability\nof the biosphere to sustain other species and natural ecosystems. We usually think of warfare as an activity\nthat only occurs among people, but in a sense the human economy is presently at war with the biosphere. If\nthat conflict with the natural world can be resolved, then wars among human cultures and nation-states\nwill be easier to avoid.\nImage 26.5.

It involved a coordinated attack against Egypt by armed forces of\nBritain, France, and Israel (Wikipedia, 2015u). The main intent was to seize the Suez Canal, which had\nbeen constructed during 1859-1869 by the French-owned Suez Canal Company, and which provides a\nvitalshippinglinkbetweentheMediterraneanSeaandtheIndianOcean.Thecanalhadbeennationalized\nby Egypt several months previously under the direction of its president, Gamal Nasser. That unilateral\nact had been undertaken to patriate ownership of the strategic shipping channel and its considerable\neconomic benefits. The situation was, however, more complicated than a nationalistic seizing of a vital\ncommercial asset. A larger context was the refusal of western powers to fund the construction of\nChapter 26 ~ War | 753 the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River, a project that Egypt considered to be vital to its economic\ndevelopment. That refusal had been precipitated by the increasing growth of economic and political\ntiesbetweenEgyptandcommunistnations,especiallytheSovietUnionandChina,ofwhichtheformer\neventually provided most of the funding for the dam project.\nInanyevent,thejointoffensivetoseizethecanalfromEgyptiancontrolturnedouttobeenormously\nmore controversial than its protagonists had anticipated. The attack was widely condemned by many\nnations,includingtheUnitedStatesandtheSovietUnion,aswellasbytheUnitedNations.Theconflict\nwas stopped when the UN General Assembly adopted a U.S.-sponsored resolution that called for an\nimmediate ceasefire, a withdrawal of forces to behind armistice lines, an arms embargo on the\nadversaries, and reopening of the Suez Canal, which had been blocked by scuttled vessels. This was\nfollowed by additional UN resolutions, which established the first United Nations Emergency Force\n(UNEF),amulti-nationalmilitarycorpsthatwouldpolicetheborderlandsofIsraelandEgyptinorderto\nprevent hostilities from again breaking out.\nTheproposalforthecease-fireandtheemergencyUNEFforcewasprimarilydevelopedthroughthe\nefforts of Lester Pearson, then serving as the Secretary of External Affairs of Canada and a front-line\nplayer at the UN. However, behind the scenes Pearson was being urged to lead this initiative by U.S.\ndiplomats,becauseanAmerican-ledeffortthroughtheUNwouldhavebeenresistedbyalargeblocof\ncountries, particularly the communist states. The proposal from Pearson received immediate support\nfromDagHammarskj\u00f6ld,theSecretary-GeneraloftheUN,andfromotherkeyworldleaders,anditwas\nquickly implemented.\nIn1957,LesterPearsonwasawardedtheNobelPeacePrizeinrecognitionofhiseffortstoresolvethe\nSuezCrisisandforthecreationofamandatefortheUNEmergencyForce.Pearsonisnowconsidered\nthe \u201cfather\u201d of the concept of peace-keeping.

Outline how humans are causing the modern crisis of extinction and endangerment.\n2. Give examples of species that have been made extinct through human activities, including cases from\nCanada.\n3. Explain how a system of protected areas is essential to the preservation of biodiversity.\n4. Outline the roles of governments, non-governmental organizations, scientists, and citizens in conserving\nspecies and other elements of biodiversity.\nIntroduction\nEarlier, we defined biodiversity as the total richness of biological variation and examined reasons why it is\nimportant(seeChapter7).Inthischapter,weexaminethemanythreatstobiodiversitythatareassociatedwith\nthe human economy. The emphasis is on severe damage that is being caused, especially that associated with\nlosses of species and of natural ecosystems.\nExtinction refers to the loss of a species or another named biological entity (referred to as a taxon) over all\nofitsrangeonEarth.Extirpationisamorelocaldisappearance,withthetaxonsurvivingelsewhere.Extinction\nrepresentsanirretrievablelossofauniqueportionofthebiologicalrichnessofEarth,whereasitmaybepossible\nto re-establish an extirpated taxon from a surviving population.\nExtinctionshavealwaysoccurredasaresultofnaturalinfluences.Theseincluderandomcatastrophesaswell\nas the longer-term effects of environmental change, such as in climate or in biological factors such as disease\nor predation (Chapter 7). In modern times, however, and even for the past 10-thousand years or so, almost all\nextinctionshavebeencausedbyanthropogenicinfluences,particularlybyover-harvestingandthedestruction\nofnaturalhabitats.Infact,anenormousincreaseintherateofextinctionshasbeenoneofthemostimportant\nconsequencesofhumansbecomingthedominantspeciesonEarth.Speciesarenowdisappearingsoquicklythat\nwe refer to the phenomenon as an extinction crisis (or a biodiversity crisis).\nEveryspeciesisunique, afactthatgivesthemgreatintrinsic value\u2013thisisacentraltenetofthebiocentric\nworld view (see Chapter 1). Therefore, from an ethical perspective, any irretrievable loss of biodiversity is a\nshameful consequenceofthewaysthatpeopleareusingtheirpowertoexploitotherspeciesandecosystems.\nThis is also a foolish way for humans to administer their global empowerment, because unique species are\ndisappearing before they have been investigated for their potential usefulness in medicine or agriculture, and\nbeforeweunderstandtheirimportanceascomponentsofecosystems.Humanactionsthatresultinextinctions\ncan only be regarded as ecologically dangerous behaviour.\nInthischapter,weexaminethemodernbiodiversitycrisis\u2013thereasonswhyitishappening,waysofrepairing\nat least some of the damage already caused, and how to prevent further losses.\n760 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis Natural Extinctions\nLifehasexistedonEarthforabout3.5billionyears.Almostallofthespeciesthathavelivedduringthatperiod\noftimearenowextinct,havingdisappeared\u201cnaturally\u201dforsomereasonorother.(Thesurvivorsarereferredto\nas extant, or still living today.) In many cases, the extinct species could not adapt to changes that occurred in\ntheirenvironment,suchasshiftsinclimateorincreasesindisease,predation,orcompetitionwithotherspecies.\nManyspecies,however,disappearedduringbriefepisodesofmassextinction,whichmayhavebeencausedby\nunpredictable catastrophes, such as a meteorite hitting Earth.\nThe geological record clearly shows that many species and groups of organisms (such as genera, families,\nand phyla) have appeared and disappeared over time (see Chapter 6). For example, many phyla of invertebrate\nanimalsevolvedrelativelyquicklyduringanevolutionaryproliferationthatoccurredaroundthebeginningofthe\nCambrian era, about 570 million years ago. Subsequently, most of those phyla and their many species became\nextinct. About 20 extinct phyla from that period were discovered in a renowned fossil deposit known as the\nBurgess Shale, located in Yoho National Park in southeastern British Columbia. In an evolutionary sense, each\nof those extinct phyla represented a novel \u201cexperiment\u201d in the form and function of invertebrate animals. We\nonly know that these ancient creatures existed because their fragile body structures became fossilized under\nextraordinary geological circumstances (Gould, 1989).\nThefossilrecordisrepletewithmanyotherexamplesofancientextinctions.However,therateofextinction,\nand of the subsequent evolutionary radiation of new species, has not been uniform over time. The geological\nrecord clearly shows that relatively low and uniform rates of extinction have typically persisted for extremely\nlong periods of time, but those tranquil eras were punctuated by about nine catastrophic events of mass\nextinction.\nThe most intense event occurred at the end of the Permian era, about 245 million years ago. This natural\ncatastrophe resulted in the loss of about 54% of the existing families of marine animals, including 84% of the\ngenera and 96% of the species (Erwin, 1990). Another mass extinction occurred at the end of the Cretaceous\nperiod, about 65 million years ago. This famous event involved the last of the dinosaurs and pterosaurs (flying\nreptiles), along with many other taxa, totaling perhaps three-quarters of the species living at the time. Many\nscientists believe that this crisis of paleobiodiversity was caused by a meteorite hitting the Earth, likely in the\nvicinityoftheYucatanpeninsulaofMexico.Suchacatastrophewouldhavecausedadeadlytsunami,whilealso\nejectingenormousquantitiesofdustintotheatmosphere,likelyresultinginacoolingoftheclimatethatmost\nspecies were unable to tolerate.\nDuring the past several centuries, Earth\u2019s existing heritage of biodiversity has been buffeted by another\nmassextinction. Thisisanongoing catastrophe, anditwill certainlyintensifyintotheforeseeablefuture.This\necological calamity is not a natural phenomenon. Rather, it is being caused by the influences and economic\nactivities of modern humans.\nExtinctions Caused by Humans\nManykindsofhumanactivitiesarecausingspeciestobecomeendangeredorextinct.(Aspeciesisconsidered\nendangered if, because of a small population or loss of habitat, it has a high risk of becoming extirpated or\nextinct.)Themostimportantcauseisthedestructionofnaturalecosystemsandtheirconversionintohabitats\nthat are unsuitable for the original species, a problem that is especially acute in tropical countries. Excessive\nChapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis | 761 harvesting of some species is also significant, as is damage caused by introduced predators, diseases, and\ncompetitors. Any of these stressors can cause populations to become increasingly small and fragmented, a\ncircumstance that results in much greater risks of extirpation or extinction (Figure 27.1).\nFigure 27.1. The Extinction Vortex. Extinction can be caused by various influences and activities of\nhumans,suchashabitatloss,excessiveharvesting,andtheintroductionofaliendiseases,predators,and\ncompetitors.Asaresultofthesestressors,largeandcontinuouslydistributedpopulationsmayfragment\ninto small isolated units that are highly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of inbreeding, population\ninstability, and random catastrophes. These can cause endangered populations to decline further and\nmayultimatelyresultinextirpationorextinction.Conservationbiologistsrefertothisacceleratingspiral\n762 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis of endangerment as the extinction vortex.\nBecause of these anthropogenic influences, the past several centuries have witnessed huge increases in the\nglobalrateofextinctionandinthenumberofspeciesthatarethreatenedwiththiscatastrophe.Notsurprisingly,\nour knowledge of recently extinct and endangered species is relatively complete for large and conspicuous\nspeciessuchasvertebrateanimals,especiallythosethatliveintemperateandhigher-latitudecountries,where\nmost biologists also live.\nInfact,therehavebeenatleast842knownextinctions,including746animalsand96plants(manyoftheseare\ndistinct subspecies and varieties; IUCN, 2014). The losses include 71 species of mammals, 135 birds, 22 reptiles,\nChapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis | 763 34amphibians,and80fishes.Alloftheseextinctionswerecausedbyhumaninfluences.Muchlargernumbers\nof species are at grave risk of suffering extinction (1,199 species of mammals are at risk, as are 1,373 birds, 927\nreptiles, 1,957 amphibians, and 2,222 fishes).\nUnfortunately, we know much less about extinctions among less conspicuous groups of organisms. This\nis particularly true of the enormous diversity of relatively small, poorly known species that live in tropical\necosystems, especially in old-growth rainforest. Undoubtedly, huge numbers of tropical species, particularly\nplants and invertebrates, have become extinct during the past several centuries as their natural forest habitat\nwasconvertedintoagriculturalandotherland-uses.Wecanrefertotheselossesas\u201chiddenextinctions\u201dbecause\nsofewofthelostspecieshadbeendiscoveredandnamedbytaxonomists.Moreover,thesehiddenextinctions\ncontinuetooccurrapidly,infactatanacceleratingrate,becausetheirpoorlyexploredtropicalhabitatsarebeing\ndestroyed so quickly.\nInthefollowingsectionswewillexamineselectedcasestudiesofspeciesthathavebeenrenderedextinctby\nhumans and their activities.\nPrehistoric Extinctions\nManyspeciesareusefulas\u201cresources\u201dthathumanscanharvestanduseasasourceoffood,medicine,timber,\nfuel,orsomeotherpurpose.Inmanycases,theexploitationofthesepotentiallyrenewableresourceshasbeen\nsoinsatiablethattheir\u201cmining\u201dhasculminatedinextinction.Theseonce-valuablespeciesnowoccurnowhere\non Earth (Freedman, 1995).\nWepreviouslyexaminedextinctionsthatwerecausedbyprehistorichuntersastheyover-huntedpopulations\nof large, naive animals in newly discovered lands (see Global Focus 12.2). In North America, it appears that\npaleohunters exterminated many species of large mammals soon after people discovered the continent by\nmigrating across a Beringean land bridge more than 12 millennia ago, at the end of the most recent ice age.\nKnownextinctionsoccurringaroundthattimeinclude77speciesofmammals,suchas10speciesofhorse,agiant\nground sloth, four kinds of camels, two bison, the mastodon, several mammoths, and the sabre-toothed tiger.\nOther large animals became extinct when South America was colonized somewhat later.\nThe colonization of \u201cnew\u201d land masses by humans also caused prehistoric mass extinctions in other places.\nAustraliaandNewGuineawerediscoveredabout50-thousandyearsago.Soonafter,manyspeciesofmarsupials,\nlarge flightless birds, and tortoises became extinct, likely because of over-hunting.\nNew Zealand was colonized less than one-thousand years ago. Within two centuries, 30 large birds were\nextinct, among them a goose, a swan, and 26 species of large flightless birds known as moas. The extinctions\nproceeded as an anthropogenic wave that began in northern North Island, which was the initial point of\ncolonization, to southern South Island. Many of the moas were herded by the hunters and their dogs to\nconvenient butchering sites, where the great piles of bones were later used by early European farmers as a\nsource of phosphate fertilizer.\nInasimilarfashion,thehumancolonizationofMadagascar,about1,500yearsago,resultedintheextinction\nof 14 species of lemurs, 6-12 flightless elephant birds, and various other big and edible animals. Other well-\nknown prehistoric mass extinctions occurred on Hawaii, New Caledonia, Fiji, and the West Indies. In fact, this\nphenomenon likely occurred whenever a previously inhabited island was discovered and colonized.\nTheendemic(local)speciesthatexistedonlyonsmallislandsareparticularlyvulnerabletoextinction.Thekey\nreasons for this were:\n\u2022 island species occur in small, isolated populations, which are especially vulnerable to extinction\n764 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis \u2022 many birds of remote islands had not experienced intense predation during their recent history, and as a\nresult they had evolved to be flightless, relatively large, and unafraid of predators, so they were extremely\nvulnerable to hunting by people once their islands were colonized\n\u2022 most island species did not co-occur with closely competing organisms, so they were easily displaced when\nmore capable species were introduced\n\u2022 islands also became ecologically degraded by introduced plants, animals, and diseases\n\u2022 finally, the human colonization of remote islands, particularly by Europeans, resulted in extensive\ndestruction of natural habitats as the islands were cleared for agricultural, urban, and tourism\ndevelopments.\nForthesereasons,thespeciesofremoteislandshavesufferedparticularlyhighratesofextinction.Forexample,\natonetime,eachoftheapproximately800islandsofthesouthernPacificOceanmayhavehadseveralendemic\nspecies of flightless rails (a family of marsh birds known as Rallidae), plus other unique birds and reptiles. As\nthese islands were discovered and colonized by prehistoric Polynesians, perhaps thousands of these endemic\nspeciesbecameextinctthroughover-huntingandhabitatdamage.Forinstance,astudyofbirdbonesrecovered\nat an archaeological site on the island of Ua Huka found that 14 of the 16 original birds no longer occur\nthere,including10endemicspeciesthathadbeenrenderedextinct.TheextinctionsworsenedwhenEuropeans\nsecondarily colonized these and other oceanic islands, because of the extensive habitat losses that occurred\nduring\u201cdevelopment.\u201dInfact,ofthe135taxaofbirds(including95species)aroundtheworldthatareknownto\nhave become extinct since 1600, all but nine lived on islands.\nTheproblemofextinction-proneislandbiotascanbefurtherillustratedbythecaseoftheHawaiianIslands,\nanancient,remotearchipelagoofvolcanicoutcroppingsinthecentralPacificOcean.Whentheseislandswere\nfirst discovered by Polynesian seafarers, there were at least 86 species of birds, including 68 that occurred\nnowhereelse.Ofthose68endemics,24arenowextinctand29areendangered.Similarly,thenativefloraatthe\ntimeconsistedofasmanyastwothousandspeciesofflowering(angiosperm)plants,ofwhichasmanyas98%\nwereendemic.Duringthepastseveralhundredyears,morethan100oftheendemicplantsbecameextinct,and\nmorethan500arethreatenedorendangered.TheextinctionandendangermentofHawaiianspecieshasbeen\ncausedbythewidespreadconversionofnaturalhabitatsintoagriculturalandurbanizedland-uses,coupledwith\nintroductions of alien predators, competitors, virulent diseases, and destructive herbivores such as goats.\nHistoric Losses by Over-Harvesting\nUnsustainable harvesting during historic times has caused some of the most famous cases of extinction and\nendangerment,insomeinstancesinvolvingspeciesthatwereinitiallyextremelyabundant.Wewillillustratethis\nphenomenonbyreferringtothedodo,greatauk,passengerpigeon,andothernotablecases.Theseareexamples\nof the devastating effects that insatiable killing can have on vulnerable populations of wild creatures.\nThedodo(Raphuscucullatus)wasaturkey-sized,flightless birdthatdisappearedin1681,makingitthefirst\ndocumentedextinctionofthehistoricalera.Thelossofthisspeciesisimmortalizedineverydaylanguagebythe\nphrase\u201cdeadasadodo,\u201dwhichisusedasametaphorforanirrevocableloss.Theword\u201cdodo\u201disalsosometimes\nusedtoindicateanold-fashionedorstupidperson.Thisetymologyderivesfromthedodo\u2019sapparentinabilityto\nadapttothreatsposedbythehumancolonistsofMauritius,theonlyplacewherethisbirdlived.Mauritiusisa\nsmallislandintheIndianOcean,discoveredbyPortuguesesailorsin1507.In1598itwascolonizedbytheDutch,\nwhohuntedthedodoformeat,gathereditseggs,andcleareditshabitatforagriculture.Theyalsoreleasedcats,\nChapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis | 765 pigs, and monkeys that preyed on dodos and destroyed their ground-level nests.

Moreover, this\npoorlyexploredbiomeisthoughttocontainmillionsofas-yet-unnamedspecies,particularlyofinsects(Chapter\n7). Because so many tropical-forest species have a local distribution, the destruction of this ecosystem causes\na disproportionate number of extinctions (in comparison with those by the clearing of other kinds of natural\necosystems).\nItiswellknownthattherateofdeforestationinmosttropicalcountrieshasincreasedalarminglyduringthe\npastcentury,particularlyinthepastseveraldecades.Thisisinmarkedcontrasttothesituationinmosthigher-\nlatitudecountries,whereforestcoverhasbeenrelativelystable(seeChapter14).InNorthAmerica,forexample,\ntherehasbeenlittlenetchangeinforestcoverinrecentyears(Table27.1).Incontrast,mostcountriesofCentral\nand South America had substantial losses of forest cover during that period, as did most tropical countries of\nAfrica and Asia. Overall, the developing world lost 138 million hectare of forest between 1990 and 2005 (5.8%\noverall), and most of that was tropical forest (WRI, 2008). Globally, the rate of clearing of tropical rainforest\nduring the 1980s and 1990s was equivalent to more than 1% of that biome per year\u2014a rate that, if maintained,\nwould imply a half-life for that biome of less than 70 years.\nMosttropicaldeforestationiscausedbytheconversionofforestintosubsistenceagriculturebypoorfamilies.\nThisagriculturalconversionisgreatlyincreasedwheneveraccesstotheforestinteriorisimproved.Whenroads\nare constructed for timber extraction or mineral exploration, deforestation often follows rapidly.The complex\nsocial causes of deforestation include population growth, inequality of land ownership, and the displacement\nof poor families by mechanization and the global commercialization of agriculture. Because of these factors,\nenormous numbers of poor families are seeking arable land in most of the less-developed countries. These\npeople need land on which they can grow food for subsistence and for some cash income.\nTheforestconversionofteninvolvesasystemofshiftingcultivation,inwhichthetreesarefelled,thewoody\ndebrisburned,andthelandusedtogrowmixedcropsforseveralyears.Bythattime,fertilityhasdeclinedand\nweedshavebecomeabundant.Thelandisthenabandonedforafallowperiodofseveraldecades.Thisallowsa\nsecondary forest to regenerate, while nearby patches of forest are cleared to provide new land for cultivation.\nA more intensive system of subsistence agriculture, known as slash-and-burn, results in a permanent\nconversionofthelandintocropproduction.Slash-and-burnalsoinvolvescuttingandburningtheforest.After\n770 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis the forest is gone, however, the land is used continuously, without a fallow period during which a secondary\nforest may regrow and site fertility regenerate.\nMuchtropicalforestisalsoaffectedbycommerciallogging,orisbeingclearedtoprovidelandforindustrial\nagriculture, such as oil-palm plantations, sugar-cane fields, and cattle pasture.

Thousands\nof sites, comprising hundreds of millions of hectares, have now received some sort of \u201cprotection\u201d in tropical\ncountries.\nHowever, the effectiveness of the protected status varies greatly. It depends on factors that influence\ngovernmental commitments to conserving forest and other natural ecosystems and to protecting biodiversity\nmore generally. Social stability and related political priorities are important considerations \u2013 these are critical\nto addressing the economic causes of the destruction of tropical ecosystems. Societal factors include poverty,\npopulationgrowth,inequitiesinthedistributionofwealthandland,industrialtimberharvestingtoearnforeign\nexchange, and corruption. More directly, political stability and priorities determine whether enough money is\navailabletosupportasystemofprotectedareasandtofindeffectivemeanstocontrolthepoachingofanimals\nand timber and to prevent other encroachments.\nPoaching(illegalharvesting)ofendangeredwildlifeisaterribleproblemforspeciesthathaveeconomicvalue\non the international black market (see Global Focus 27.1). This can be illustrated by the black rhino (Diceros\nbicornis) and the elephant (Loxodonta africana) in a game reserve in Zambia, Africa. In the early 1970s, the\nLuangwa Valley contained about 100-thousand elephants and as many as 12-thousand black rhinos (Leader-\nWilliams et al., 1990). Unfortunately, these relatively large populations quickly collapsed because of poaching,\nwhichresultedfromtheextremelyhighpricespaidforrhinohornsandelephanttusksontheblackmarket.Even\nthoughZambianparkwardensmadecourageouseffortsunderdifficultcircumstances,itprovedimpossible to\ncontrol the poaching.

We will examine the problem of species declines using\nthe example of North American songbirds.\nWithin the past two decades or so, ecologists and birders have been reporting alarming declines in the\npopulations of many species of so-called neotropical migrants (these are birds that spend most of the year in\ntropicalhabitatsbutmigratetohigher-latituderegionstobreed).Mostofthedecliningspeciesbreedinmature\ntemperateandborealforest.Althoughthereasonsforthesongbirddeclinesarenottotallyunderstood,themost\nimportant factors are probably the following:\n\u2022 extensive deforestation in their tropical wintering range\n\u2022 disturbance of mature-forest habitat in the northern breeding range\n\u2022 fragmentation of the breeding habitat into \u201cislands\u201d that are too small to sustain populations over the long\nterm, and that are easily penetrated by forest-edge predators and nest parasites (such as cowbirds \u2013 to be\ndiscussed later)\n\u2022 loss of critical habitats for staging and migration\n\u2022 effects of pesticides and other toxic chemicals\n\u2022 possibly also new introduced diseases, such as the West Nile virus\nBachman\u2019s warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) appears to have become extinct because of the loss of its tropical\nwintering habitat. This songbird used to breed in mature hardwood forest in the southeastern United States.\nAlthough suitable habitat remains in that region, this warbler has not been seen since the mid-1950s and is\nundoubtedlyextinct.This loss wasprobablycausedbytheclearing ofitscriticalwintering habitat,believedto\nhave been humid tropical forest in Cuba that was converted into sugar-cane plantations.\nMuch of the evidence suggesting that populations of many other neotropical migrants are declining is\nanecdotal\u2013skilledbirdersarenotseeingasmanyindividualsofmanyspeciesastheyoncedid,eveninplaces\nwhere the local habitat has not changed much.

There are also some uplifting successes of conservation. These involve species that were taken\nperilouslyclosetothebrinkofextinction,buthavesincerecoveredbecausetheyweregiveneffectiveprotection.\nIn some cases, the recoveries have been vigorous enough that the species are no longer in imminent danger.\nAlthough these success stories are a distinct minority (the number of endangered species is increasing much\nmorerapidly),theyareneverthelessinstructive.Theyillustratethatpositiveactionscanyieldgreatbenefits,both\nforthespeciesinquestionandforthepeoplethatmaynowbeabletoexploitthemasapotentiallyrenewable\nresource. (Historical data in this section are from Freedman, 1995.)\nThe Northern Fur Seal\nThe northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) lives in the northern Pacific Ocean. It was relentlessly exploited\nfor its fur, and by 1920 had been reduced from a population of several million to only about 130-thousand.\nBecause this fur seal was believed to be in danger of extinction, an international treaty was signed to strictly\nregulateitsharvest.Itspopulationrespondedvigorouslytotheconservationmeasuresandreboundedtoalmost\n1-millionindividuals,abundantenoughtoagainsupportacommercialhuntforitsfur,leather,andoil.However,\nits numbers have declined again and now there is only a subsistence hunt, equivalent to about one-thousand\nanimalsperyearsince2000(NMFS;2007).Thenorthernfursealhasbeensufferingconsiderablenon-hunting\nmortality from entanglement in fishing gear, over-fishing of its food, poaching, and oil spills.\nSomeothersealswerealsohuntedexcessively,butthenreboundedinabundanceaftertheexploitationwas\nstopped, or at least sensibly regulated.

Following protection, some populations have substantially recovered. The best example of this is\nthegreywhale(Eschrichtiusrobustus)ofthePacificcoastofNorthAmerica,whichwasprotectedinthe1930s\nwhen its population numbered as few as one-thousand animals.

The sperm whale (Physeter catodon),\nfor example, had a global pre-whaling abundance of about 2-million, but now numbers fewer than 1 million\n778 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis (IWC, 2015).

There is intense pressure, however, for the moratorium to end for the most abundant species,\nparticularly the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which numbers about 600-thousand.\nImage27.3.Populationsofhumpbackwhales(Megapteranovaeangliae)wereheavilyexploitedworldwide\nby commercial whaling.

The most important causes of mortality of Atlantic\nright whales appear to be collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing nets.\nChapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis | 779 The American Bison\nBeforetheAmericanbison(orbuffalo;Bisonbison)wassubjectedtoanintensivecommercialhunt,itspopulation\nwasabout60million.Atthattime,bisonwasthemostabundantlargewildanimalinNorthAmerica,rangingover\nmost of the continent.\nThe eastern subspecies (B. b. pennsylvanicus) was an animal of forests and glades that ranged over much of\nthe eastern United States. It was hunted to extinction by the mid-1800s. The plains bison (B. b. bison) ranged\nthroughouttheprairiesandwasbyfarthemostpopuloussubspecies.Theymigratedinenormousherds\u2013one\nwas described as being 80 km long and 40 km wide, another as 320 km long, and another as moving over a\n160 km front! The plains bison were subjected to an intensive market hunt during the nineteenth century and\nwere nearly exterminated. Apart from the money that was made by selling meat and hides, the eradication of\nthesebisonwasencouragedbygovernments,especiallyintheU.S.,likelyfortworeasons.First,thedevelopment\nofprairieagriculturewasbeingdisruptedbythebisonherds,especiallyduringtheirmassmigrations.Second,\nbecause the bison were critical to the subsistence economy of the Plains Indians, extermination of these\nabundant animals made it easier to displace the Aboriginal tribes in favour of European colonists.\nThemostfamousbuffalohunterwasWilliamF.Cody,or\u201cBuffaloBill,\u201dwhowascontractedin1869toprovide\nmeat for workers constructing the Union Pacific Railroad through the U.S. prairie. Cody reportedly killed 250\nbison in a single day and more than four-thousand during an 18-month period.

By\n1889there were fewer than one-thousand bison leftin the UnitedStates, and only small herds survivedin the\nCanadianprairies.Almosttoolate,afewcloselyguardedpreserveswereestablished,andsomewildanimalswere\ncapturedforbreedingprograms.Theseandlateractionshaveallowedthenumbersofplainsbisontoincrease\ntotheirpresentabundanceofmorethan50-thousandanimals.Ofcourse,almostalloftheiroriginalhabitatis\ngone,havingbeenconvertedintoagriculture,sothisanimalwillneverrecoveritsformerabundance.However,\nthe plains bison is no longer endangered.\nThe wood bison (B. b. athabascae) of the southwestern boreal forest is a third subspecies. When this animal\nbecame endangered by over-hunting, its only remaining wild population was protected in and around Wood\nBuffalo National Park in northern Alberta and the adjacent Northwest Territories. Unfortunately, the genetic\nintegrity and health of this population has been degraded by interbreeding with plains bison, which were\nintroduced to the area by misguided wildlife managers in the late 1920s.

That slaughter would be intended to prevent the spread of\nbrucellosis and tuberculosis from bison to cattle herds that are spreading northward in Alberta. A secondary\nreason for the proposed slaughter is to protect the genetic integrity of the wood bison subspecies, because\nhybrid wood/plains animals would be targeted for extermination. This would leave the more isolated, non-\ndiseased, pure wood bison to repopulate the cleared habitat. This proposal is highly controversial and, even\nif permitted, would probably not be successful. An enormous effort would be required to find each and every\nhybrid bison in the target area, which is an immense wilderness of boreal forest and muskeg.\nSome Other Recoveries\nTheseaotter(Enhydralutris)livesonthewestcoastofNorthAmerica.Thismarinemammalwassubjectedtoa\ndevastating18th-and19th-centuryhuntforitsdenseandlustrousfur.Infact,ithadbeenthoughttobeextinct,\nuntil small residual populations were discovered in the 1930s.

An unrelated program of providing terrestrial nest-\nboxes has helped to increase the abundance of eastern and western bluebirds (Sialia sialis and S. mexicana),\nwhich had been declining because of habitat loss.\nThe American beaver (Castor canadensis)was one of the most sought-after species in the fur trade, a\ncommercial activity that stimulated much of the early exploration of Canada and the United States. Beavers\nwere over-harvested almost everywhere, which caused the species to be extirpated from most of its natural\nrange.

Canadian examples of extinct species are the great auk (Pinguinus impennis),\npassenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorium), sea mink\n(Mustela macrodon), deepwater cisco (Coregonus johannae), longjaw cisco (Coregonus alpenae), and\neelgrass limpet (Lottia alveus). Extinct subspecies are the Queen Charlotte caribou (Rangifer tarandus\ndawsoni), blue pike (Stizostedion vitreum glaucum), and Banff longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae\nsmithi). As of 2014, 15 Canadian taxa (species, subspecies, or distinct populations were extinct.\n\u2022 Extirpated refers to any species or subspecies that was formerly indigenous to Canada but now only\nsurvives in the wild or elsewhere, usually in the neighbouring United States. Examples include the black-\nfooted ferret (Mustela nigripes), Atlantic grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus), Northwest Atlantic walrus\n(Odobenus rosmarus), greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), pygmy short-horned lizard\n(Phrynosoma douglassi), paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), and blue-eyed mary (Collinsia verna). As of 2014, 23\ntaxa were extirpated in Canada.\n\u2022 Endangered refers to indigenous species that are faced with imminent extinction or extirpation throughout\nall or a significant portion of their Canadian range. As of 2014, 312 taxa were considered to be endangered.\nExamples include the Vancouver Island marmot (Marmota vancouverensis), bowhead whale (Balaena\nmysticetus), right whale (Balaena glacialis), whooping crane (Grus americana), Eskimo curlew (Numenius\nborealis), burrowing owl (Speotyto cunicularia), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), Blanchard\u2019s cricket frog\n(Acris crepitans blanchardi), blue racer snake (Coluber constrictor foxii), eastern prickly pear cactus\n(Opuntia humifusa), small white ladyslipper (Cypripedium candidum), thread-leaved sundew (Drosera\nfiliformis), and seaside centipede lichen (Heterodermia sitchensis)\n\u2022 Threatened refers to any indigenous taxon that is likely to become endangered unless factors affecting its\nvulnerability are reversed. As of 2014, 167 taxa were considered threatened in Canada. Examples include the\nwood bison (Bison bison athabascae), sea otter (Enhydra lutris), Pacific humpback whale (Megaptera\nnovaeangliae), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus\ncatenatus), and American chestnut (Castanea dentata).\n\u2022 Special concern refers to any indigenous species that is not currently threatened but is at risk of becoming\nso because of small or declining numbers, occurrence at the fringe of its range or in restricted areas,\nhabitat fragmentation, or some other reason. As of 2014, 204 taxa or populations were considered to be of\nspecial concern.

Most importantly, the Act does not fully address\nthe protection of habitat of endangered species off federal land. To some degree, this deficiency is covered\nby legislation that has been enacted by provinces and territories.

It is imperative that the remaining areas of these endangered ecosystems become preserved in parks\nand other kinds of protected areas.\nProtected Areas\nProtected areas are parks, ecological reserves, and other tracts of land or water that have been set aside\nfrom intensive development to conserve their natural values. The intent is usually to protect representative\nexamples of widespread communities or ecoscapes, threatened ecosystems, or the habitat of endangered\nspecies. However, many protected areas also support human activities that do not severely threaten the\n784 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis ecological values that are being conserved.

Because of these and other problems, it is doubtful whether\nmanyofthesmallerprotectedareaswillbeabletosustaintheirpresentecologicalvaluesoverthelongerterm.\nThis will be especially true if a major environmental change occurs, such as global warming or a catastrophic\ndisturbance (such as a devastating wildfire or disease epidemic).\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes six categories of protected areas\n(see Global Focus 27.2). In 2011, there were about 161-thousand terrestrial protected areas in the world,\nrepresenting as much as 15% of the global land area (Protected Planet, 2015). There are many fewer marine\nprotectedareas,about7-thousandandcoveringonly1%oftheoceanicsurface.Eachyear,however,additional\nprotected areas are added to the tally, including in the marine realm, for which such initiatives are recent\ncompared with the terrestrial realm.\nProtected Areas in Canada\nNationalparks,provincialparks,andsimilarplacesarethelargestandmostimportantprotectedareasinCanada.\nAsummaryofareasprotectedinCanadaisprovidedinFigures27.3and27.4.Notethatthenationallyprotected\nareaofabout10%issmallerthanrecommendedbymanyconservationscientists,whoseestimatesrangefrom\n15-40% of the landmass.\nFigure 27.3.

Source: Environment Canada (2015b).\n786 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis In addition to their primary goal of conserving biodiversity, most parks serve additional purposes, including\nthe support of economically important outdoor recreation and tourism. To some degree, the use of parks for\nthesepurposesisachallengetotheirabilitytofunctionasecologicalreserves.Forexample,strictlyinterpreted,\nthe ecological values of national parks are not compatible with consumptive uses of their natural resources\n(such as sport fishing) or with the development of infrastructure to support recreation and tourism (such as\ncampgrounds, golf courses, hotels, roads, ski facilities, and even interpretation facilities).\nThe ecological-reserve function of many protected areas is also threatened by land-use and management\nactivitiesthatareoccurringintheirsurroundingarea.Usually,themostimportantofthe\u201cexternal\u201dstressorsare\nassociatedwithagriculture,forestry,mining, tourism, orhydroelectricdevelopment.Infact,allofthenational\nparksinmoresouthernregionsofCanadaaresignificantlythreatenedinthisway.Wecanillustratethisproblem\nwith several well-known examples.\n\u2022 Point Pelee National Park is a small, 15.5 km2park in southwestern Ontario. It contains some of the most\nimportant remnants of natural habitat left in the Carolinian zone (Chapter 8), most of which has been\nconverted into agriculture or urbanized land-uses. Consequently, Point Pelee supports populations of many\nendangered species and ecological communities. However, this small park is used intensively for outdoor\nrecreation, including birding, boating, hiking, and picnicking on its beaches. To support these culturally and\neconomically important activities, much of the limited area of the park is maintained as paved roads,\npathways, parking lots, campgrounds, information centres, lawns, and other land-uses that do not enhance\nthe protection of ecological values. Moreover, the area next to the national park is almost entirely\nconverted into agricultural lands, such as onion fields established on drained marshes, or into cottage and\nmotel developments that support tourism. These land-uses have isolated the relatively natural ecosystems\nof Point Pelee, to the degree that it is an ecological \u201cisland\u201d that is surrounded by incompatible uses of the\nlandscape. For these and other reasons, the park is losing some of the natural features it is trying to\nprotect. For example, it has lost 10 of its original 21 species of reptiles, and 6 of 11 amphibians. Some of its\nChapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis | 787 habitats are being badly degraded by invasions of alien plants (such as garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata),\nwhich crowd out native species. In fact, 37% of the vascular plants in the park are non-native.\n\u2022 Fundy National Park in New Brunswick is a similar case, although its ecological values are not as severely\nthreatened as those of Point Pelee. Fundy has an area of 206 km2, but park ecologists believe that this is not\nlarge enough to sustain viable populations of certain wide-ranging species, such as black bear, pine marten,\nand pileated woodpecker, or certain natural ecosystems such as old-growth forest. To some degree, these\nand other natural values are being compromised by the development of tourism facilities within the park,\nincluding campgrounds, a golf course, a swimming pool, interpretive facilities, and extensive lawns and\nroads. Also important are industrial activities in the area surrounding the park, where forestry interests are\nextensively converting the natural forest into faster-growing conifer plantations\n\u2022 Banff National Park in southwestern Alberta was the first national park to be established in Canada, in 1885.\nThe original intent was to protect extremely scenic viewscapes and hot springs and to develop the area in\nsupport of the economic benefits of tourism. It was not until several decades later that the philosophical\nunderpinning of national parks shifted toward the protection of natural values. In any event, the early\ndevelopment of Banff featured the enthusiastic construction of large hotels, golf courses, skiing facilities,\nmajor highways, a transcontinental railroad, several villages, and other structures. This pattern continues\ntoday with much ongoing construction, coupled with rapid development of the area east of the park for\ntourism, residential neighbourhoods, forestry, and other uses. These facilities severely threaten the long-\nterm viability of the natural values of Banff. This economic development is engendering intense controversy\nand has been the subject of a commission of enquiry (see Environmental Issues 27.1).\nProvincial and territorial governments also have a responsibility to protect natural values within their\njurisdiction.Thesegovernmentshavedesignatedmanyecologicalreservesandwildernessareas,supplemented\nby natural areas that are protected in provincial parks and conservation areas, which are also well-used for\nrecreation. Some municipalities also have natural-area parks that provide habitat for native species.

There are four reasons for making this statement:\n1. the full breadth of Canada\u2019s natural heritage is not yet represented in protected areas\n2. there are many species at risk in Canada, many of which will have to be protected in ecological reserves\n788 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis that do not yet exist\n3. most of the existing protected areas are too small to protect their ecological values over the long term\n4. where species- and communities-at-risk occur in \u201cworking\u201d landscapes outside of protected areas, their\nspecial needs for critical habitats are often not being met\nThethirdisimportantbecausesmallareascannotusuallysustainviablepopulationsofsomespeciesofwildlife\noverthelongterm,eveniftheyareprotected.Smallreservesalsocannotsustaintheecologicalconditionsthat\nare required for certain communities to persist, especially old-growth forest.

These various facilities are developed especially intensely in the so-called Banff-Bow\nValleycorridor,aregionthatencompassesthemajortransportationroutesthroughtheparkaswellas\nthe main tourist areas.\nThe tourism- and transportation-related infrastructure in the Banff-Bow Valley corridor provides\nsupport for big-business tourism and the national system of ground transportation.

A Task Force of five independent experts, appointed by Parks Canada,\nstudied these challenges (Page et al., 1996). The Task Force was given three objectives:\n1. to develop a vision for the region that would integrate ecological, social, and economic values\n2. to undertake an analysis of existing information, and to provide direction for monitoring programs\n3. to recommend changes that would allow the Banff-Bow Valley region to be used for sustainable\ntourism and recreation industries, while also protecting its heritage of ecological values\nTheTaskForcereviewedawealthofexistinginformation,commissionedoriginalresearch,andengaged\ninpublicconsultations.ItsfinalreportconcludedthatintensiveeconomicdevelopmentintheBanff\u2013Bow\nValley region was quickly approaching an unsustainable level, and this was threatening the ecological\nintegrityofthenationalpark.TheTaskForcemadenumerousrecommendationsforspecificactionsand\npoliciesthatwouldhelptodealwiththeintensifyingcrisis.Itstronglyadvisedthatthepaceandintensity\nofdevelopmentbestrictlycontrolled,andinsomecasesreversed.Inessence,theTaskForcereasonably\nconcluded that Banff National Park can be an effective protected area only if its use by people is kept\nwithin sustainable bounds.\nTheTaskForcereportwasfavourablyreceivedbythethen-ministerresponsibleforParksCanada,who\ndeclaredthatallofitsmajorrecommendationswouldbefollowed.Ifthiswastohappen,however,Parks\nCanada had to take firm action against powerful economic interests that are determined to increase\ntheamountofrecreationandtransportationinfrastructureintheBanff-BowValleycorridor.Sincethen,\nhowever, subsequent ministers and senior administrators in Parks Canada have not had the fortitude\nto resist many of the compelling calls for additional \u201cdevelopment\u201d, and so Banff National Park is not\nyet being managed in ways that make its ecological integrity the bottom line, rather than additional\neconomic development.\nDesign and Stewardship\nThedesignofprotectedareasisanimportantfieldofresearchinconservationbiology.Theessentialquestions\ninvolvewaysofdetermining thebestsize,shape, andpositioning ofprotectedareasinordertooptimizetheir\nability to protect biodiversity, while using limited funding as efficiently as possible. The least controversial\nrecommendationsofconservationbiologistsarethatecologicalreservesshouldbeaslargeandasnumerousas\npossible.Otheraspectsofthedesignofprotectedareasarebeingactivelydebated,andthediscussionwillnot\nbe resolved until more research is undertaken. These aspects of reserve design include the following:\n\u2022 The choice between size and number of protected areas: Is it preferable to have one large reserve or\nseveral smaller ones with the same total area (Figure 27.5a)? Conservation biologists identify this question\nwith the acronym SLOSS, for single large or several small. According to ecological theory, a population in a\nlarger reserve is expected to have a lower risk of local extinction compared with one in a smaller area.\nHowever, if separate populations occur in different reserves (even if they are relatively small), the\nredundancy might protect against catastrophic loss of an endangered species in a larger reserve (even if it\nis relatively large).\n\u2022 Larger reserves have more interior habitat: So-called \u201cinterior\u201d habitat is not influenced by environmental\nconditions that occur at an ecotone (or a transition between habitat types, such as a forest edge). Ecotonal\nhabitats may be penetrated by invasive species, predators, and parasites (such as cowbirds), which can be\n790 | Chapter 27 ~ The Biodiversity Crisis an important problem in protected areas. In addition, many species require interior habitat for successful\nbreeding. Larger reserves have proportionately more interior habitat, a factor that contributes to the\nconservation of interior species (Figure 27.5a).\n\u2022 Reserves should be clumped: Similar reasoning suggests that it is better to aggregate reserves than to\narrange them in a linear fashion. This would reduce the average distance between protected areas, which\nmay enhance their ecological connections (Figure 27.5d).\n\u2022 The role of corridors: A system of reserves connected by corridors of suitable habitat may provide better\nopportunities for gene flow and re-colonization after extirpation (Figure 27.5e). Admittedly, however,\ncorridors might also make it easier for diseases and invasive species to spread among reserves.\n\u2022 Circular reserves are better: A circle has a smaller ratio of edge to area than any other two-dimensional\nshape. To avoid extensive edge habitat in the design of a protected area, a roughly circular shape may be\npreferable (Figure 27.5b).\n\u2022 Reserves should be close together: If a population is extirpated in a protected area, the chances of natural\nre-colonization may be improved if the species survives in a nearby reserve. Consequently, it may be better\nto have unconnected reserves arranged relatively close to each other, rather than far apart (Figure 27.5c).\nFigure 27.5. Design of Protected Areas. This figure summarizes basic principles of conservation biology\nfor the design of protected areas. In each comparison, the design on the left is better than the one on\nthe right (the total areas are assumed to be the same). See the text for additional explanation.

This is particularly the case of southern regions of Canada, where most\nspecies-at-risk and endangered ecosystems occur. Because of a lack of money and other priorities,\ngovernmental agencies are often reluctantto secure ecologically importanthabitaton privately owned\nlands.Forthisreason,conservationcharitiesknownaslandtrustshaveformedforthepurposeofraising\nfunds to acquire private property in order to establish protected areas.\nAtthenationallevel,thelargestoftheseorganizationsistheNatureConservancyofCanada(NCC).The\nfocus of NCC is on acquiring private property of high conservation value, which it does by purchasing\nor accepting donations of real estate, as well as rights of land-use. The latter involves a kind of private\nproperty called a conservation easement (or in Quebec, a servitude). If owned by NCC, a conservation\neasement can prevent current and future owners of the real estate from converting its natural habitat\nintoresidentiallotsorcultivatedagriculture,orfromengaginginotherproscribedactivitiesthatmight\nthreaten the natural values of the property. There are many other land trusts that operate at local and\nprovincialscalesthatalsoacquireprivateconservationlandsandeasements.However,NCCistheonly\nnational organization, and it is by far the biggest.\nSinceitsoriginin1962,NCChascontributedtotheprotectionof1.1-millionhectaresofnaturalhabitat\nthroughout Canada (Freedman, 2013; NCC, 2015). In 2013-14, NCC raised (and spent) more than $87\nmillion to advance its conservation mission. In 2012, it met the goals of its five-year \u201cForce for Nature\u201d\nfund-raising campaign, which raised more than $546 million, from the private sector and all levels of\ngovernment. More than 62-thousand Canadians contribute annually to support the work of NCC.\nTheconservationactionsofNCCarebeingguidedby\u201cecoregionalplans\u201d,alsoknownas\u201cconservation\nblueprints\u201d,whichhelptoidentifythemostimportantplaceswhereprivateactioncanmakethegreatest\ndifference in protecting native species and natural ecosystems. These plans are developed in close\npartnership with governments, the U.S. Nature Conservancy, Ducks Unlimited Canada, provincial and\nlocal land trusts, industrial interests, and academic scientists.

These kinds of stewardship activities must be advised by leading-edge\nscientificknowledge,whichNCCdevelopsbyhiringecologistsandbyworkinginpartnershipwithother\norganizations.\nThe Nature Conservancy of Canada is only one example of the many highly motivated and effective\nnon-governmental conservation organizations in Canada. Their work is crucial to sustaining the\nbiodiversity-at-risk of our country. Of course, being charities, private organizations like NCC can only\nspend money that they can manage to raise, which is a good reason for all sectors of our society to\nsupport their important work of protecting natural habitats.\nInternational Conservation\nTheconservationofwildspeciesofplantsandanimalsisnowregardedbyalmostallsocietiesasaworthwhile\nand important objective.

Nevertheless, this respect has not\nnecessarilybeentranslatedintoareal-worldconservationethicamongthepeoplesofthoseoranyothernations.\nAs a result, wildlife and natural habitats have suffered badly, mostly as a result of the extensive conversion of\nnatural ecosystems into agricultural ones, but also from timber harvesting and other ways as well.\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to describe the many international agencies and organizations that\nare active in the protection of global biodiversity.

Outline the process of an environmental impact assessment, and describe several Canadian examples.\n2. Discuss how monitoring and research are necessary to understanding the causes and consequences of\nenvironmental damage.\n3. Explain how environmental reporting and literacy are crucial to dealing with the environmental crisis.\n4. Outline the roles of governments, non-governmental organizations, scientists, and citizens in designing\nand implementing an ecologically sustainable economy.\nIntroduction\nThe previous parts of this book allowed us to learn the subject matter of environmental science by examining\nkeyideasandbyanalyzingabodyofsupportinginformation.Inthisfinalchapter,webringmanyofthesetopics\ntogether in an interdisciplinary fashion.\nIn the first sections of the chapter, we will examine topics related to environmental management and\nprotectionatthebroadersocietallevel.Thesetopicsincludeenvironmentalimpactassessment,monitoringand\nresearch, environmental literacy, and sustainability. All of these are necessary for maintaining an acceptable\nlevel of environmental quality and healthy ecosystems\u2014two necessary objectives for a truly sustainable socio-\neconomic system. We will also examine a range of actions that each of us can undertake to help resolve\nenvironmental problems.\nIntheconcludingsectionofthischapter,wewillbrieflydiscussthefutureprospectsforadvancedeconomies,\nsuch as that of Canada, and for spaceship Earth.\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a planning process that is used to help prevent environmental\nproblems.Environmentalimpactassessmentsdothisbyidentifyingandevaluatingthepotentialconsequences\nthataproposeddevelopmentmayhaveforenvironmentalquality.Becauseitcanconsiderecological,physical-\nchemical, and other environmental effects, as well as socio-economic consequences, an EIA is a highly\nmultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary activity.\nAn EIA may be conducted to examine various kinds of activities, or planned developments, that could affect\nenvironmental quality, such as the following:\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 803 1. an individual project, such as a proposal to construct an airport, dam, highway, incinerator, mine, or power\nplant\n2. an integrated scheme, such as a proposal to develop an industrial park, a pulp or lumber mill with its\nattendant wood-supply and forest-management plans, or other complex developments that involve\nnumerous projects\n3. a governmental policy that carries a risk of substantially affecting the environment\nThescaleofanenvironmentalassessmentcanvarygreatly,fromtheexaminationofarelativelysmallproposal\nto construct a building near a wetland, to a megaproject associated with natural-resource development.\nIn Canada, environmental impact assessments for proposals that involve federal funding or jurisdiction are\nregulated under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), which was enacted in 1992. The Act is\na law that requires federal decision makers, referred to as \u201cresponsible authorities,\u201d to consider the predicted\nenvironmental effects of a proposed project before it is allowed to go ahead. If significant adverse effects are\npredicted,theprojectisnotallowedtoproceeduntilthedamageshavebeenaddressedbyachangeindesignor\nthrough some other mitigation.\nInitially, the CEAA required that EIA studies be done on a wide range of projects involving jurisdiction of\nthefederalgovernment.However,in2012theActwasgreatlyweakenedbyrequiringthatonlybigprojectsare\nconsidered (CEAA, 2013). Provinces and territories also have legislated requirements for EIA, as do some local\nlevels of government, such as municipalities and First Nations.\nEIAisbasedonthereasonablepremisethatallproposedprojects,programs,andpoliciescarryrisksforhuman\nwelfareandforotherspeciesandecosystems.Forexample,aproposedprojectmayemittoxicchemicalsintothe\nenvironment.Insuchacase,itisnecessarytodetermineiftheanticipatedemissionsmightexceedtheregulated\nlevels. The most stringent standards and guidelines are related to the maximum exposures that humans can\ntolerate without suffering risks to their risks, while criteria to protect other species and ecosystems are less\nexacting.Forexample,theguidelineforuraniumindrinkingwateris0.02mg/L(HealthCanada,2008),butthat\nfortheprotectionofaquaticlifeis40mg/Lforashort-termexposure(<1-4days)and5.5mg/Lforalong-term\nexposure (CCME, 2009).\nIn addition, a project might cause disturbances to natural habitats during its construction or operation,\nwhich could result in ecological damage. These effects should be identified and quantified, and the potential\nenvironmental damages evaluated, before permission is granted to start the project.\nThe process of environmental impact assessment is intended to predict these potential damages and to\nsuggestwaysofavoidingormitigatingthemasmuchaspossible.However,thisdoesnotnecessarilymeanthat\nno damage will be caused by a proposed development. In almost all cases, some damage is inevitable.\nBecause most developments potentially affect a great variety of species and ecosystems, EIAs are limited to\npredictingtheeffectsononlyaselectionofso-calledvaluedecosystemcomponents(VECs).Thesecomponents\nare valued because society perceives them to be important for one or more of the following reasons:\n1. They are an economically important resource, such as an agricultural crop, a commercial forest, or a stock\nof fish, mammals, or birds\n2. They are a rare or endangered species or ecological community\n3. They are of cultural or aesthetic importance\nThe initial phase of the process of environmental impact assessment is known as a screening. The screening\ndeterminesthelevelofassessmentthataproposedactivitywillundergo,suchaswhetheraminorreviewora\nfullassessmentisappropriate.Infact,thegreatmajorityofenvironmentalassessmentsinCanadaarerestricted\ntothescreeninglevel\u2013ingeneralonlylargerprojectsrequireamoreextensive,comprehensiveassessment.The\n804 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development decisionaboutwhethertoproceedtoamorecomprehensiveassessmentismadebyaresponsibleauthorityof\ntherelevantlevelofgovernment(suchcanbefederal,provincial,territorial).Usually,theresponsibleauthorityis\nadepartmentoragencywithamandateorexperiencethatisrelevanttotheproposedproject.Thedecisionis\nbasedonthelikelihoodthattheproposeddevelopmentwillcausesignificantadverseenvironmentaleffects,but\nexpressions of public concern are also an important consideration.\nA full EIA requires the proponent to prepare an environmental assessment report, which is a series of\ndocuments that describe the proposed undertaking, as well as studies of its likely environmental and socio-\neconomic effects. The proponent must also inform the public of its detailed plans, which is usually done by\nholding meetings in local communities and making planning documents available for review by individuals\nand concerned organizations. For the largest projects, a review panel of experts may be appointed by the\nfederal Minister of the Environment to hear submissions from the proponents, as well as from individuals and\norganizations that have been given permission to intervene in the process. Once the panel has considered all\nwrittenandverbalsubmissions,itdeliversasummaryreportandalistofrecommendationstotheresponsible\nauthorityandtheMinisteroftheEnvironment,whomakethereportpublic.Thefederalgovernmentmustthen\ndecidewhethertoallowthedevelopmenttoproceedasproposed,orwithrequiredmitigationsthatwouldavoid\norlessenenvironmentaleffectsthataredeemedunacceptable.Afollow-upprogrammayalsoberequired,such\nas environmental monitoring and the mitigation of unanticipated damages.\nOncethelevelofassessmentisdecided,ascopingexerciseisundertaken.Thisidentifiespotentiallyimportant\ninteractions between project-related activities on the one hand and human welfare or VECs on the other. In\nessence, the scoping compares the predicted spatial (space) and temporal (time) boundaries of stressors that\nare associated with the proposed development with the areas where people and VECs are found. If potential\ninteractions are identified, the assessors must determine whether significant damage is likely to be caused.\nSometimes an impact assessment is not well funded or it has to be completed relatively quickly. In such\ncases,ecologists,sociologists,toxicologists,andotherprofessionalsmayhavetoprovideexpertopinionsabout\nthe likely importance of interactions between project-related stressors and human welfare or VECs. These\nprofessional opinions should be based on the best-available scientific information and understanding, while\nrecognizingthatsuchknowledgeisincompleteanddifferencesofopinionmayariseamongqualifiedspecialists.\nWhen sufficient time and funding are available, it is possible to conduct field, laboratory, and/or computer-\nbased (simulation) research to investigate the potential interactions identified during the screening process. It\nmustbeunderstood,however,thatevenwell-funded,properlydesigned,andwell-executedresearchmayyield\nuncertainresults,particularlyaboutdamagethatmightoccuratlowintensitiesofexposuretoproject-related\nstressors.\nPlanning Options\nIf potentially important risks to human welfare or VECs are identified, a number of planning options must be\nconsidered. There are three broad choices.\n\u2022 Prevent or Avoid: One option is to avoid the predicted damage by ensuring that there are no significant\nexposures of people or VECs to damaging stressors related to the project. This can be done by modifying\nthe characteristics of the project, or in cases of severe conflicts with human welfare or ecological values, by\nchoosing to cancel it entirely. Because prevention and avoidance may involve substantial costs, they are\nsometimes considered to be less desirable options by the proponents of a development. Politicians and\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 805 regulators may also dislike this option since it may involve intense controversy and substantial economic\nopportunities may be cancelled. Nevertheless, there is always public and regulatory pressure to take as\nmany precautions as possible before undertaking a proposed development.\n\u2022 Mitigation: Another option is the mitigation of any predicted damages, or to repair or offset them as much\nas possible. Because any direct damage to people is considered unacceptable (and therefore to be\nrigorously avoided), mitigation is mainly relevant to damage inflicted on VECs or to indirect, low-level risks\nto people. For instance, if the habitat of a valued species is threatened, it may be possible to move the\npopulation at risk to a suitable habitat elsewhere, or to create or enhance a habitat at another place so that\nno net damage is caused. For example, a wetland may be unavoidably destroyed by a proposed\ndevelopment, but the damage may be offset through the creation of a comparable wetland elsewhere.\nMitigations are a common way of dealing with potential conflicts between project-related stressors and\nVECs. However, it is important to understand that mitigations are never complete, and there is often\nresidual damage.\n\u2022 Accept the Damages: The third option is for decision makers to choose to allow a project to cause some or\nall of the predicted damages to human welfare or VECs. This choice is often considered tolerable by the\nproponents of a project and by politicians (although such a preference would rarely be explicitly stated).\nTheir rationale is due to their perception that the socio-economic benefits gained by proceeding with a\nthreatening project are likely to be much greater than the costs of environmental damage. From an\nenvironmental perspective, however, this choice might not be viewed as being acceptable, usually because\nthe environmental \u201ccosts\u201d are being grossly undervalued.\nEnvironmental impact assessments generally find that a proposed development carries risks of causing some\ndegree of environmental damage. Usually, the development is allowed to proceed in some form, with the\npredicteddamagebeingavoidedormitigatedtothedegreethatisconsideredtechnologicallyandeconomically\nfeasible.Asnotedpreviously,however,therearealwaysresidualrisksthatcannotbeavoidedormitigated.Any\ndamagethatdoesoccurrepresentssomeoftheenvironmentalcostsofdevelopment,whicharerealevenifthere\nis financial compensation or other kinds of offsets.\nOnce a project has begun, compliance monitoring is usually necessary to ensure that regulatory criteria for\npollutionorhealthhazardsarenotbeingexceeded.Itisextremelyuseful,althoughnotalwaysrequired,toalso\nmonitor the ecological effects of a project. This tests the predictions of the impact assessment and identifies\nunanticipatedeffectsor\u201csurprises.\u201dIdeally,amonitoringprogramforecologicaleffectsisbegunbeforeaproject\nactuallystarts,inordertoestablishthebaselineconditions.Themonitoringshouldthencontinueforsomeyears\naftertheprojectiscompleted,untilitisdeterminedthatimportantdamageisnotbeingcaused.Ifunanticipated\ndamageisshownbythemonitoring,itmaybeprevented,avoidedbyanadaptivechangeintheprojectdesign,\nmitigated in some way, or accepted as an ecological \u201ccost\u201d of development.\nExamples of Impact Assessments\nEIAs have been conducted in all regions of Canada, examining projects that varied widely in both scale and\npotential effects. Each of these unique cases is instructive, in the sense of illustrating the environmental\nimplications of development projects and the role played by impact assessment. In the following sections, we\nbriefly examine selected elements of some environmental impact assessments in Canada.\n806 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development Diamond Mines in the Northwest Territories\nThisproposalinvolvedthedevelopmentofminestoextractdiamondsfromfivedepositsdiscoveredabout300\nkmnortheastofYellowknife.Avarietyofpotentialenvironmentaldamageswereidentifiedwiththisproject.First,\nsome of the diamond-bearing rock lies beneath lakes that would have to be drained to develop a mine.

A ban was imposed on local hunting by project\npersonnel. As well, a monitoring program was to be undertaken to ensure that unanticipated damage is not\ncausedtoairorwaterqualityortowildlife.Theminemustalsomeetsocio-economiccriteria,includingseveral\nthat deal with employment opportunities and other ways of engaging local people (including Aboriginals) in\nthe development.

Ultimately, however, the\nproposed development did not proceed, not so much because of environmental concerns, but as a result of\ninsufficientcommitmentstopurchasetheelectricityinthenortheasternUnitedStates.Withoutaccesstothat\nforeign market, the estimated $13 billion cost of the project\u2019s construction was not considered economically\nfeasible.

According to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, this includes the need\nto evaluate cumulative environmental impacts, or those resulting from the effects of a proposed\n810 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development undertaking within some defined area, in addition to those caused by any past, existing, and imminent\ndevelopmentsandactivities.Theconceptofcumulativeeffectsrecognizesthattheenvironmentaleffects\nofseparateanthropogenicinfluenceswillcombineandinteracttocausechangesthatmaybedifferent\nfrom those occurring separately.

In addition, Canada has signed a number of international treaties and protocols\nthat deal with important environmental issues.\nEnvironmental law in Canada is made extremely complex by jurisdictional overlaps and other factors. One\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 811 problemisthatofharmonizationofrelatedpiecesoflegislationamongtheprovinces/territoriesandthefederal\ngovernment.

This conviction\nwas overturned on the basis of treaty rights, negotiated in 1760-1761, that guaranteed Mi\u2019kmac and Maliseet\nIndianstherighttocommerciallyharvestnaturalresourcesatanytimeofyearwithinanextensivetreatyarea\nin the Maritime Provinces.

There are, however, a much larger number of cases that can be\nresolved with softer regulatory actions, such as writing a warning letter to a non-compliant party.\nSeveral non-governmental organizations have taken on the mandate of advocating improvements to\nenvironmental law and policy in Canada, while ensuring that the existing laws are rigorously applied.

In response, many nations are implementing programs to monitor changes in environmental\nquality over time. Most of these programs are intended to document changes that are occurring over large\nregionsorentirecountriesandtohelppredictfuturevariations.Theseeffortsaremuchlargerinscaleandscope\nthanprogramsthatmonitorwhetheraparticularindustrialfacilityiscomplyingwithregulationsandguidelines.\nMost large-scale monitoring is conducted by governmental agencies, or in some cases, by non-governmental\norganizations.Theresultingdataandknowledgeareusedtoguidedecisionmakingingovernment,toenhance\nthe work of NGOs, and to provide material for environmental research and education.\nIn the sense meant here, environmental monitoring involves repeated measurements of factors that are\nrelatedtoeithertheinorganicenvironment,thestructureandfunctioningofecosystems,andanyintersections\nwith human welfare. Because not everything can be monitored, successful monitoring programs depend on\nthe careful choice of a limited number of representative indicators and on the collection of reliable data. If a\nmonitoring program detects important changes, the possible causes and consequences of those changes are\nusually researched.\nAn environmental indicator is a relatively simple measurement that is used to represent a complex aspect\nof environmental quality. Indicators are usually sensitive to changes in the intensity of stressors. For example,\nthe level of chemical residues in species high in the food web is often used as an indicator of contamination\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 813 ofitslargerecosystem.Thisiswhyresiduesofchlorinatedhydrocarbons(suchasDDTandPCBs)areroutinely\nmonitoredinherringgullsandcormorantsontheGreatLakes,andinmarinemammalsincoastalwatersofthe\nPacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans (Chapter 22). Similarly, many lichens are known to be sensitive to gaseous\npollutants and so are monitored as indicators of air quality over large regions, including cities.\nOtherindicatorsincludespeciesthatareconsideredtorepresentthegeneralhealthoftheecosystemofwhich\nthey are a component. For instance, the population status of grizzly bears is considered a good indicator of\nthequalityoftheirextensiveecosystem,asarepopulationsofspottedowlsforwesternold-growthrainforest,\npileated woodpecker and pine marten in some other forests, salmon and trout in certain aquatic ecosystems,\nand orca and other cetaceans in the marine realm.\nSometimes, composite indicators are monitored to track changes in environmental quality. These are\nenvironmental analogues of the composite indexes that are used to monitor complex trends in finance and\neconomics, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) index. Because\nthey allow complex changes to be presented in a simple manner, composite indictors are especially useful for\nreporting to the general public.\nCompositeindicatorsofairandwaterqualityhavebeendevelopedusingdataforvariouskindsofimportant\npollutants, such as major gases, vapours, and particulates in the atmosphere. However, composite indicators\nof environmental quality (or of ecosystem health or ecological integrity; see In Detail 28.1) are not yet well\ndeveloped. This is mostly because scientists have not yet agreed on what the component variables should be.\nWhenachangeinindicatorsismeasuredinanenvironmentalmonitoringprogram,orwhenoneispredicted,\nit is necessary to understand its causes and consequences. This is generally done by using the accumulated\nknowledgeofeffectsofenvironmentalstressorsonecosystems,alongwithresearchthatisdesignedtoaddress\nimportant questions that are not yet understood. We can examine the linkages between environmental\nmonitoring and research by considering several examples.\nSuppose that environmental monitoring has detected that precipitation has become acidified in some large\nregion(Chapter19).Thecause(s)oftheacidificationmightbeunderstoodbydeterminingtheconcentrationsof\nchemicalsintheprecipitationandbyinvestigatinglocalemissionsofgasesandparticulatestotheatmosphere.\nResearchers must also understand the consequences of an increased deposition of acidifying substances to\nfreshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as the implications for buildings and other urban features. At\nfirst,theresearchwouldexaminetheexistingknowledgeofthecausesandecologicaleffectsofacidificationin\nvarious kinds of habitats. However, that knowledge is always incomplete and therefore it must be augmented\nwith new research examining risks of acidification that are not yet understood. The accumulated information\nhelps society to understand whether the causes of acidification can be controlled, and if so, to assess the\npotential environmental and economic benefits.\nInanotherexample,monitoringmightindicatethattheecologicalcharacterofaregionischangingbecause\nthe natural forest is being extensively converted into plantations through industrial forestry. The ecological\nconsequences would initially be interpreted in the light of existing knowledge of the effects of forestry,\nsupplemented by additional research that investigates poorly understood issues. Specific research questions\nmight address effects of the ecological conversions on biodiversity, forest productivity, watershed hydrology\nand chemistry, and global environmental change through effects on carbon storage (Chapters 17 and 23). This\ninformation is needed to help decision makers evaluate whether they should permit further conversions of\nnatural forest into plantations.\nEnvironmentalmonitoringandresearchinCanadaarecarriedoutbyvariousagencies.EnvironmentCanada\nis the most active agency at the federal level. In addition, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans deals\nwith fisheries and oceanic environments, Natural Resources Canada provides data about non-renewable and\nsome renewable resources, the Canadian Forest Service provides information relevant to commercial forests,\nParks Canada examines changes in national parks, and Health and Welfare Canada deals with influences of\n814 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development environmentalqualityonhumanhealth.StatisticsCanadaplaysakeyroleincompilinginformationandmakingit\navailabletogovernments,companies,andthepublic.AlloftheprovincialandterritorialgovernmentsofCanada\nalso have comparable agencies that deal with environmental issues within their jurisdiction.\nA few non-governmental organizations also undertake a considerable amount of environmental monitoring\nand research. For instance, the WWF-Canada has programs that fund work on endangered species and\necosystems. The Nature Conservancy of Canada is active in work associated with conservation planning and\nstewardship. Universities also have considerable technical expertise in environmental issues. University\npersonnel are not necessarily involved in long-term monitoring programs, but many professors and graduate\nstudents undertake research into the causes and consequences of environmental changes.\nEnvironmental monitoring programs provide society with crucial information and knowledge. Both are\nnecessaryfortheimplementationofeffectiveprogramstopreventfurtherdegradationofenvironmentalquality\nandthehealthofecosystems,andtorepairexistingdamage.Theseactionsarenecessaryifsocietyistoconduct\nits economy in a truly sustainable manner.\nInDetail28.1NotionsofEnvironmentalQualityEnvironmentalquality,ecosystemhealth,andecological\nintegrity are important notions that help us understand the importance of changes in environmental\nconditions.However,likeothernotions,theseonescannotbepreciselydefined,althoughitispossibleto\ndevelop a general understanding of what they mean.\nBecausetheyintegratechangesinmanycomponentsofecosystemsandenvironments,theseconcepts\ninvolve complex phenomena. Environmental quality, for example, is related to the concentrations of\npotentially toxic chemicals and other stressors in the environment, to the frequency and intensity\nof disturbances, and to the effects of these on humans, other species, ecosystems, and economies.\nOf particular concern are stressors associated with human activities, because these have become so\nimportant in the modern world.\nEcosystem health and ecological integrity are similar to each other and, in many respects, to\nenvironmental quality. However, these indicators focus on changes that may be occurring in natural\npopulations and ecosystems, rather than on effects on people and their economy. All of these notions\ninvolve many variables that are related to stressors and socio-economic or ecological responses. As a\nresult,theyaresometimesmeasuredusingcompositeindicators,whichintegratemanypossiblechanges\nthat are thought to be important. Composite indicators are not exact measurements of environmental\nquality, ecosystem health, or ecological integrity, but they do allow society to determine whether\nconditions are getting worse or better.\nThese ideas can be explained by using ecological integrity as an example. Obviously, most stressors\nassociatedwithhumanactivitieswillenhancesomespecies,ecosystems,andecologicalprocesses,while\natthesametimedamagingothers.However,ecologicaltheorysuggeststhatsystemswithhighervalues\nfor any or all of the following characteristics will have a greater degree of ecological integrity:\n\u2022 Theecosystemisresilientandresistant(seeChapter9)tochangesintheintensityofenvironmental\nstressors\n\u2022 The system is rich in indigenous biodiversity values\n\u2022 The ecosystem is complex in its structure and function\n\u2022 Large species are present\n\u2022 Top predators are present\n\u2022 The ecosystem has controlled nutrient cycling, meaning it is not \u201cleaking\u201d its nutrient capital\n\u2022 The ecosystem has a \u201cnatural\u201d character and is self-maintaining, as opposed to being strongly\naffected by human influences and management\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 815 Thesesortsofcriteriaforecologicalintegrityareoffparticularrelevancetomanagingprotectedareas.\nIF ecological integrity is being maintained or enhanced, then a protected areas is doing its job of\nmaintaining biodiversity and ecological functions.\nSome Challenges and Successes\nAs we noted earlier, programs of monitoring and research should be capable of detecting changes in\nenvironmental quality, while also helping to predict future effects. Well-designed programs should deal with\nthe most important known stressors or potential threats to the environment. They should measure or predict\nthe effects on people and on sensitive ecosystems and species, particularly those that are economically or\necologically important.\nThese are the simple requirements of a sensible program for monitoring and investigating environmental\nproblems. Unfortunately, these criteria are not well met by many existing programs, and as a result some\nimportant environmental problems are not yet well understood. Consequently, they are not being addressed\neffectively, and they could become worse in the future. The following are some examples selected from\npreceding chapters.\n\u2022 What constitutes an acceptable exposure of humans to potentially toxic chemicals? Some toxins, such as\nmetals and many biochemicals, occur naturally. How much can anthropogenic emissions be allowed to\nincrease exposures beyond the natural background? Is any increase in exposure acceptable for non-natural\ntoxins, such as dioxins, furans, PCBs, synthetic pesticides, and radionuclides? Or are there acceptable\nthresholds of exposure to those substances?\n\u2022 Is a widespread decline of migratory birds occurring? If so, what are the causes, and how can we manage\nthe responsible stressors to repair the damage and prevent further losses of these native birds?\n\u2022 Anthropogenic emissions of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) may be causing a depletion of stratospheric ozone,\nresulting in increased ground-level exposures to ultraviolet radiation. What risks does this change have for\nhuman health and for wild species and ecosystems? How can the damage be prevented and repaired?\n\u2022 What are the dimensions of the global extinction crisis? How is biodiversity important to the health of the\nbiosphere and to human welfare? Which Canadian species and ecosystems are most at risk, and why?\nShould Canada expend more effort to help conserve tropical biodiversity, or should we focus on problems\nwithin our own boundaries? How are Canadians linked to biodiversity-depleting stressors in tropical\ncountries?\n\u2022 Extensive declines and diebacks of forests have been reported in various parts of the world, including\nCanada. Is that damage being caused by natural environmental changes or by stressors associated with\nhuman activities? If anthropogenic stressors are important, how can they be managed to prevent and\nrepair the forest damage?\n\u2022 What are the environmental consequences and costs of conventional and nuclear warfare? The effects of\nwar are devastating to people, their economy, and ecosystems. If these effects were better known, this\ninherently destructive behaviour might be avoided.\n\u2022 Is it possible to valuate the worth of species, communities, and ecological services (that is, to measure their\nworth in dollars) so that these can be integrated into economic cost-benefit models?\n\u2022 How intensively can renewable resources be harvested and managed without causing unacceptable risk to\ntheir long-term sustainability and without inflicting damage to other species and ecosystems?\n816 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development To deal properly with these and many other important issues, we must improve our understanding through\nbettermonitoringandresearch.Wecanillustratetheachievablebenefitsbyexaminingafew\u201csuccessstories\u201din\nwhich monitoring, research, and effective actions helped to resolve important environmental problems.\n\u2022 Eutrophication of fresh water was identified as an important environmental problem during the 1960s and\nearly 1970s. Research discovered that phosphate was the primary cause and that the damage could largely\nbe avoided by constructing sewage-treatment facilities and by using low-phosphorus detergent.\n\u2022 Contamination with persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as DDT, dieldrin, and PCBs, was found to be\nwidespread in the 1960s and 1970s. Research showed that some species, such as predatory birds, were\nbeing seriously harmed and that there were possible effects on humans. The toxicological evidence\nconvinced decision makers to ban these chemicals in most countries, to the great benefit of the\nenvironment.\n\u2022 Acidification was recognized during the late 1970s and the 1980s as an extensive phenomenon causing\nmany ecological damages. Research showed that the problem was largely due to the atmospheric\ndeposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds. This convinced decision makers to require reductions of\nindustrial emissions, and that action led to some improvements.\nEnvironmental Literacy and Reporting\nEnvironmentalliteracyreferstoawell-informedunderstandingofenvironmentalissues,anditisanimportant\nsocietal goal. Knowledge about the causes and consequences of environmental damage can influence the\ndecisionsandchoicesmadebypoliticians,regulators,corporations,andindividualcitizens.Ifappropriate,those\ndecisions and choices can influence environmental quality in a positive way (Figure 28.1). People acquire this\nknowledge in various ways, the most important of which are environmental reporting and other forms of\neducation.\nFigure 28.1. Influences on Environmental Quality. This is a conceptual model of the many influences\non environmental quality, including the roles of monitoring, research, regulation, and literacy.\nEnvironmental monitoring and research provide an understanding of the causes and consequences of\nchangesinconditions.Ideally,thisunderstandingisbasedonobjectiveinformationfrommonitoringand\nresearchprograms,interpretedbyenvironmentalscientistsandotherqualifiedspecialists(althoughtheir\nexplanationsmaybeconditionedbysocialandculturalinfluences).Thisknowledgeiscommunicatedto\ndecision makersingovernment,whomayimplementregulationsandundertakemanagementactivities\nthat affect environmental quality.\nKnowledge about environmental and ecological changes is also communicated to the general public,\nthrough state-of-the-environment reporting, the educational system, activities of non-governmental\norganizations, and the mass media. Social attitudes regarding the environment are affected by\nenvironmentalliteracy,andtheymayresultinmoreappropriatechoicesoflifestyleandapublicinfluence\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 817 on the policies and actions of governments and corporations. Source: Modified from Freedman (1995).\nEnvironmental literacy has a pervasive influence on the attitudes that people develop. Individuals who are\nknowledgeableaboutenvironmentalissuesaremorelikelytomakeappropriatelifestylechoicesandtoinfluence\ndecision makers to ensure that sensible policies are implemented. In contrast, poorly informed public opinion\nencouragesless-appropriateenvironmentalchoices,suchasrampantconsumerismandawastefuluseofnatural\nresources. Environmental illiteracy also fosters the development of controversial \u201cred herrings\u201d, or illogical\nbeliefs that mislead or distracts from important issues.\nAnexampleofanenvironmentalredherringisthecommonmisunderstandingthatmanypeoplehaveofthe\ndifferencesbetweencontaminationandpollution.RelatedunhelpfulsyndromesareknownasNIMBY(notinmy\nbackyard),LULU(locallyunacceptablelanduse),BANANA(buildabsolutelynothinganywherenearanybody),and\nNIMTO(notinmytermofoffice).NIMBY,LULU,andBANANAarecommonviewsthatmanypeoplehaveabout\nproposeddevelopmentsthatmayaffecttheirlocalenvironment,whileNIMTOisafrequentpoliticalresponse.\nThese attitudes can result, in part, from a lack of credible information about the risks that may be associated\nwithdevelopmentsintheneighbourhood.Alternatively,NIMBY,LULU,andBANANAmayresultwhenplanners\nand developers are insensitive to the legitimate concerns of local people.\n818 | Chapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development Inadditiontoaffectingthesitingofcommercialandindustrialfacilities,NIMBY,LULU,BANANA,andNIMTO\ncause huge problems for planners who are attempting to build certain kinds of environmental management\nfacilitiesthatsocietywantsandneeds.Forexample,eventhoughallvotersrecognizethattheircommunityneeds\nfacilitiesforthedisposalofsolidwastesandthetreatmentofsewage,notmanypeoplewishtohavesuchworks\nlocated in their own neighbourhood.\nDecision makers in government and industry need objective cost-benefit analyses when dealing with\nenvironmentalproblems.Thesepeoplehavetheresponsibilityofmakingsocietal-levelchoicestoavoid,mitigate,\noracceptenvironmentaldamage.Theirchoicesareoftenbasedontheirperceptionsofthecostsassociatedwith\nenvironmental damage, offset by economic benefits promised by the activity that is causing the degradation.\nUnfortunately, the perspective of many decision makers is that of conventional, short-term economics rather\nthan ecological economics (see Chapters 1 and 12). Because many social controversies have resulted from\nseemingly non-balanced choices, the role of decision makers is changing in many countries. In addition to, or\neveninsteadof,actuallymakingchoices,thesepeopleareincreasinglybeingexpectedtocreateanappropriate\nclimate for multilateral consultation and consensus-driven decision making.\nEnvironmental reporting is one process that is used to communicate information about environmental\nchanges to various interest groups. Such reporting should involve clear and objective presentations of\ninformationaboutchangesinenvironmentalquality,andshouldalsoofferunbiasedinterpretationsofthecauses\nand consequences of those changes.\nEnvironmental reporting is delivered to the broader public by various agencies, including government\ndepartments, educational institutions, non-governmental organizations, and the mass media. A governmental\ninstrumentthathasbeenprominentsincethemid-1980sisknownasstate-of-the-environmentreporting.For\na time, the federal government released well-regarded, comprehensive reports on the state of the Canadian\nenvironment (in 1986, 1991, and 1997). Most of the provinces have also released periodic state-of-the-\nenvironmentreports.Unfortunately,EnvironmentCanadahasnowlargelyabandonedthisfunction,andin1996\nitcloseddownitsdivisionresponsibleforthepreparationofcomprehensivestate-of-the-environmentreports.\nNevertheless,variousfederalagenciescontinuetomakeusefulinformationabouttheenvironmentavailableto\nthepublic.OneexcellentexampleisStatisticsCanada,whichmakesavailableawiderangeofusefulinformation.\nOf course, most people become informed about environmental issues through the mass media, such as the\ninternet, newspapers, and television. These can be effective means of environmental education, but there are\ndrawbacks. Often, media presentations of issues are biased, and sometimes they are inaccurate. The focus\nis often on controversy, especially when there are unresolved issues that are characterized by scientific\nuncertainty. This can result in high-profile disputes dominating the environmental agenda, which can detract\nfrom efforts to deal with some other important problems whose causation and resolution are better known.\nTosomedegree,thisapproachcanbecounterbalancedbyprovidingthebroaderpublicwithmoreobjective\ninformation and by fostering a better understanding of the issues. One means of accomplishing this is to\nensure that environmental issues are dealt with, adequately and objectively, in the education system. Ideally,\nthis exposure would occur throughout the system \u2013 from primary and high schools, through colleges and\nuniversities, to continuing education for the working public.\nWithinallofthesecontexts(butparticularlyinschools,colleges,anduniversities),therearetwobroadways\nof delivering environmental education:\n1. The first involves discrete, interdisciplinary classes in environmental studies and environmental science.\nArguably, environmental issues are important enough to social literacy to justify their treatment as a\nprimary subject area, comparable to biology, languages, literature, mathematics, music, physics, and other\ndisciplinary subjects.\n2. The second way of delivering environmental education is to integrate appropriate case material across the\nChapter 28 ~ Ecologically Sustainable Development | 819 curriculum. Environment-related elements can be used to assist the teaching of all disciplinary subjects,\nranging from the physical sciences, through the other natural sciences and medicine, to the social sciences.\nMeasurestoensurethatcitizensareenvironmentallyliterateareanecessarypartofanystrategythatisdesigned\ntoresolveenvironmentalproblems.Ifpeopleunderstandthesecriticalissues,theywillbemorewillingtomake\npersonal choices in support of the protection of environmental quality, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems.\nSustainability\nWepreviouslydefinedsustainabledevelopmentasprogressmadetowardaneconomicsystemthatisultimately\nbasedonthewiseuseofrenewableresources(Chapters1and12).Therefore,asustainableeconomywouldnot\ndeplete its capital of natural resources, and so would not compromise the availability of those necessities for\nusebyfuturegenerationsofhumans.Wealsonotedthatecologicallysustainabledevelopmentwouldallowthe\nhumanenterprisetocontinue,butwithoutcausingunacceptabledamagetootherspeciesornaturalecosystems.\nBy these criteria, the so-called \u201cadvanced\u201d economies of modern times (such as that of Canada, the United\nStates, countries of Western Europe, Japan, and Australia) are clearly non-sustainable. There are two major\nreasons for this alarming conclusion:\n1. The first is the obsession that politicians, economists, and other managers of national and international\neconomies have for rapid economic growth, both to keep up with an expanding population and to increase\nthe standard of living.\n2. The second reason involves the likelihood that the present size of advanced economies is already too large\nto be sustained for long. The rationale for these two statements is briefly explained in the following\nparagraphs (and is further supported by more detailed examination in earlier chapters).\nEconomic growth is typically achieved by forcing both non-renewable and potentially renewable resources\nthroughaneconomy,therebymakingtheeconomylarger.Sinceabout1990,nationswithadvancedeconomies\nhavebeenachievingeconomicgrowthratesofabout1-3%peryear,which,ifmaintained,woulddoublethesize\nof their economies in only 26 to 70 years. Rapidly developing economies, such as those of Brazil, China, Chile,\nIndia,Mexico,andThailand,havebeengrowingevenfaster(butfromamuchsmallerper-capitabase),atupto\n5-10% in some years, which is sufficient to double their economies in only 7 to 15 years.\nAswelearnedearlier,thissortofrapideconomicgrowthcanbeachievedonlyaslongasresourcescontinueto\nbereadilyavailable.InChapters13and14,weexaminedmanyexamplesofrapidlydepletingstocksofbothnon-\nrenewable and potentially renewable resources.
