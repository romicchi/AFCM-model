Equatorial Africa was cooler and increasingly drier than in earlier times. The\nIndian subcontinent continued to move north, resulting in the uplifting of the Himalayan\nmountain chain that produced a rain shadow, i.e. moisture-laden clouds that would have\npreviously drifteddown into Africa now lost their moisture on the mountains. Drying winds\nand cooler temperatures resulted in forest reduction and fragmentation in Africa, splitting\nand isolating resident faunal populations.\n\u2022 The majority of African ape species went extinct due to loss of habitat.\n\u2022 Bipedalism is an efficient means of locomotion for covering distance on fairly level ground.\n\u2022 A more vertical posture reduces the surface area exposed to solar radiation in a more open\nenvironment. It also raises a large percentage of the body away from the hot ground, where\nit is exposed to cooling breezes.\n\u2022 The ancestors of the hominins adapted to the changing environment by becoming bipedal on\nthe ground. Over time they developed a more efficient heat exchange system for their bodies\n(sweating) and brains (large venous sinuses for rapid blood movement) and lost much of their\nbody hair.\n\u2022 Based upon early hominin teeth, they were generalists like chimps, likely getting the majority\nof their carbohydrates and fats from fruit, protein from young leaves, and possibly fat and\nprotein from animal matter, e.g. social insects (chimps and gorillas eat a lot of ants and ter-\nmites) and animals caught opportunistically. No early hominins exhibit the same degree of\ncanine size or sharpness as chimp and gorilla males. Their canines stay sharp via a honing\n(sharpening) action with the first lower premolar, termed asectorialpremolardue to its uni-\ncuspid morphology. The combination of the action and morphology of the two teeth is\ntermed a \u201choning complex\u201d. Males\u2019 canines are exceptionally large and, in combination with\n44 | The History of Our Tribe: Hominini their high degree of sexual dimorphism, are used to compete with other males for access to\nfemales. Of course, they are also useful for predator defense. Thus, if the common ancestor\nof chimps, gorillas, and hominins possessed a premolar honing complex, as seems likely, the\nearly hominin fossil evidence suggests that they were losing their fighting teeth. In addition,\nfossil hominins do not exhibit the same degree of sexual dimorphism as seen in chimps and\nespecially gorillas. Later chapters contain more information on hominin socioecology.\nMost apes went extinct as their habitats dwindled and they competed for limited resources. However,\nwithanefficientmeansoflocomotiontomovebetweenforestpatcheswhenresourcesbecamedepleted,\nhominins could continue to exploit those resources to which they were adapted.

While his claim to have dis-\ncovered a human ancestor was not initially accepted by the scientific community, he was vindi-\ncated when Robert Broom began finding similar material at other South African sites. The work\nof Dart and Broom played a pivotal role in directing attention to Africa as the birthplace of\nhumanity, as Charles Darwin had earlier predicted.\nRaymond Dart was a renowned Australian anatomist who was teaching at the University of Wit-\nwatersrand in South Africa at the time of the discovery. I have read several accounts over the\nyears of the fateful day when the fossil material landed in Dart\u2019s hands. The Taung material was\nbrought to him by either quarry workers or a colleague while he was dressing for the wedding\nof his daughter or friend, depending on the source you read. He is said to have attempted to\nuse his wife\u2019s knitting needles to extract the fossils from the surrounding matrix. I am not sure\n15. Australopithecus africanus | 103 why we need to know what he was doing when he got his hands on the goods. We certainly do\nnot know what most paleoanthropologists were doing when they were presented with fossil\nfinds. However, it conjures up amusing possibilities in my mind!\nThe fossilized remains came from theTaung Quarryin the process of blasting for lime. When\npresented with the material, Dart established that it was the face, mandible, andendocast(fos-\nsilized interior of the cranial vault) of a juvenile hominin. He based this on the anterior position\nof the foramen magnum and aspects of brain morphology reflected on the interior of the skull\nvault. Dart named his findAustralopithecus africanus, meaning \u201csouthern ape of Africa,\u201d and the\nspecimen became known as the \u201cTaung Child.\u201d\nFigure 15.2Raymond Dart.\n\u201cSmithsonian Institution Archives \u2013\nSIA-SIA2008-0845\u201d from the\nSmithsonian Institution Archives is\nin the public domain.\nThe Taung child was two to three years old when it died. We now know that the caves of South\nAfrica were formed by underground water activity and hominins that dropped or were dragged\ninto those subterranean caves became fossilized during the process of speleothem formation.\nOver millennia, the caves filled with mineral deposits, and via erosion, the mineralized contents\nand underground cavities surfaced. Many fossils were likely destroyed during quarrying activi-\nties, but we are lucky that many were preserved.\nRaymond Dart is also renowned for his \u201cKiller Ape\u201d theory and theosteodontokeratic(bone-\ntooth-antler) culture. Dart believed that animal long bones and carnivore mandibles that were\nfound with australopith remains had been used as weapons to fight and kill one another. We\nnow know that was not the case. They were most likely opportunistically hunting small prey\nand scavenging larger kills, and they were prey for larger animals.\nRaymond Dart is credited with the 1924 discovery and naming of Au. africanus.

He\ntaught geology and zoology at a South African college until he was let go for his controversial\nbeliefs in evolution that were contrary to the religious teachings at the college. Subsequent to\nhis termination, his finances went downhill until Raymond Dart\u2019s influence secured him a posi-\ntion at the Transvaal Museum. While his specialty was mammalian-like reptiles, he became\nincreasingly involved with fossil hominins. Together, Dart and Broom made paleoanthropologi-\n15. Australopithecus africanus | 105 cal history, discovering the first and second species of African hominins, respectively. Broom\nworked at theAu. africanussites of Sterkfontein and theP. robustussites of Swartkrans and\nKromdraai. All of those sites are now contained within theCradle of Humankind World Her-\nitage Site. He was the first to discover and nameParanthropus robustus, and his work withAu.\nafricanushelped to support Dart\u2019s claims to have discovered a bipedal ape and human ancestor.\nBroom\u2019s most famousAu. africanusfind was \u201cMrs. Ples\u201d (possibly a male), which he originally\nnamedPlesianthropus transvaalensisor \u201cprimitive human\u201d of the Transvaal.\nIf accounts of Robert Broom are to be believed, he was a colorful character. He is said to have\nworn semi-formal attire while excavating and when media were present, he conveniently hap-\npened upon important discoveries. Supposedly, one of his team buried an artifact that was\nalready labeled with a catalog number. Oh, to have been on the scene and witnessed what must\nhave been an embarrassing situation! Not to mention that, according to numerous online\nsources, he thought nothing of stripping naked when it became \u201cAfrica Hot\u201d! (I picked up that\nterm from a couple of comedy movies but it is now in the Urban Dictionary.)\nIt is interesting that Broom did not believe in Darwinian evolution but rather, what we would\nnow call Intelligent Design (Wikipedia contributors 2015h).\nFigure 15.4Sterkfontein Cave. \u201cSterkfontein Caves\n16,\u201d photograph by Mike Peel (www.mikepeel.net), is\nlicensed underCC BY-SA 4.0.\n106 | The History of Our Tribe: Hominini PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nAu.africanuswasmorederivedthanAu.afarensis.Thisisnotsurprisingconsideringthattheylivedatleast\nonemillionyearslater,aswellasthetrendwithinthehomininlineagetobecomemoreencephalizedand\nmanuallydexterousovertime.Au.africanuswerehabitualbipedswithallofthecorrespondinglowerlimb\nadaptations.

While other species apparently preceded H.\nhabilis in the manufacture of tools, it was thought for many years that they were the first to do so. The\nOldowan or Olduwan tradition (industry and technology are also used synonymously with \u201ctradition\u201d),\nnamed after Olduvai Gorge, consisted of simple core tools and flakes. The technique involved the selec-\ntionofacobble(aworkable-sizedrock),followedbytheuseofahammerstonetoremovetheouterrough\nsurface (see Figure 23.3) or \u201ccortex\u201d and then to shape it into a core tool, by the removal of flakes.

He and his\nwife Mary made names for themselves with their pioneering work, searching for and discover-\ning fossil hominins in East Africa. Louis is credited with the discovery of three hominin species,\nthe first of which is considered to be a possiblebasalorstemape,Proconsul africanus(\u201cbefore\nConsul\u201d [a famous chimp at the London Zoo]/\u201cfrom Africa\u201d). Louis was an early believer in an\nAfrican human origin (Cartmill and Smith 2009). He became interested in the search for ancient\nhominins after his discovery of stone tools that he attributed to human ancestors. The Leakeys\nworked at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania for many years. When Mary discovered the robust aus-\ntralopith that she namedZinjanthropusboisei(later to be changed toAustralopithecus boisei\nand later toParanthropus boisei), Louis proclaimed to the world that they had found his pre-\ndicted \u201cman the toolmaker.\u201d According to legend, he was ridiculed by some because they felt\nthat \u201cZinj\u201d (also known as \u201cDear Boy\u201d or \u201cNutcracker Man\u201d), as the specimen came to be known,\nwas an herbivorous ape that would not have had the mental capabilities to manufacture the\ntools that became known as theOldowan technology. Louis was later rewarded with the dis-\ncovery of fossils of a more derived hominin with a larger cranial capacity. He named the species\nHomo habilis(\u201cHandy man\u201d) as the first tool makers. There was and still is some controversy\nsurrounding the classification of the species. He and his colleagues were accused of using cul-\ntural versus physical attributes to justify their inclusion of the fossil material in our genus\nHomo. Some still believe the species should be assigned to genus:Australopithecus. Regardless\nof the controversies, Louis made a name for himself and added to our knowledge of human\n23. Homo habilis | 151 ancestry. At Olduvai, he also discovered the cranium (missing its face) of a 1.2 myaH. ergaster\nindividual. Another great accomplishment was sending the three \u201cgrand dames\u201d of ape prima-\ntology into the field. He correctly believed that we can learn about ourselves from our closest\nrelatives. He thus funded Jane Goodall to study the chimps of Gombe, Tanzania; Dian Fossey for\nher work with mountain gorillas in the Virunga Volcano region of Rwanda; and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas\nto study the orangutans of Borneo.\nMary Leakey (n\u00e9e Mary Douglas Nikol, 1913\u20131996) is described on the Leakey website\n(www.leakey.com) as \u201cone of the world\u2019s most distinguished fossil hunters.\u201d She is credited with\nthe discovery of two species of early hominins,Au. afarensisat Laetoli andP. boiseiat Olduvai,\nas well as the Laetoli footprints. (Laetoli is also in Tanzania.) Mary had an early interest in\narchaeology and, like Louis, excavated stone tools; in her case in France as a mere child. By age\n17, she was auditing university courses in archaeology and geology. She met Louis in 1933 and\naccompanied him to Kenya to illustrate stone tools for a book he was writing. They married\nseveral years later and had three sons, Jonathan, Richard, and Philip. Jonathan hunted fossils\nalong with his parents and discovered the firstH. habilisspecimen, a mandible known as\n\u201cJonny\u2019s Child.\u201d Richard moved into Kenya to work at sites around Lake Turkana, and his team\ndiscovered the oldestH. ergasterspecimen (1.75 mya) in the West Lake Turkana region. In addi-\ntion to his paleoanthropological work, he is a champion of wildlife conservation. His wife Meave\nis a renowned paleoanthropologist with several hominin species discoveries to her credit, and\ntheir daughter, Louise, is well on her way to making a name for herself (www.leakey.com).\n152 | The History of Our Tribe: Hominini 24.

However, most eastern neandertals\nwere gone by the time AMH passed through their former eastern geographic range, en route to West-\nern Europe.
