{"text":"1\nReading Like a Professional\nMany college students who graduate at the top of their high school\nclasses experience a rude awakening when, after reading an assignment\nfor a college course, they fail a quiz over the assignment the next day in\nclass. What happened? You know you read every page of the assignment,\nbut when the professor asked you about a specific point in the reading, you\nblanked. Or even worse, even as you read, you were never quite sure just\nwhat the author\u2019s central argument, or thesis, was.\nThe reading assigned in college courses can be quite challenging.\nAuthors often pursue their goals in complex and sophisticated ways,\nemploying vocabulary, metaphors, and allusions that are unfamiliar to\nmany readers. Authors of literature are no exception to these practices.\nYet, avid fans of poetry, fiction, and drama often claim that the world\nis broadened incredibly by literature, if only one can determine how to\nnavigate it.\nYou probably enjoy reading certain kinds of texts, such as internet\narticles on your pet interests or biographies of people you admire. You\nmay even have literary favorites. You may have spent many happy hours\nimmersed in the world of Middle Earth, in Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings,\nor in Forks, Washington, trying to guess what will happen to Stephenie\nMeyer\u2019s Bella in the Twilight series. Still, you may feel a bit uncertain\nsurmising the meaning of Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s allegorical short story\n\u201cYoung Goodman Brown\u201d or interpreting Robert Frost\u2019s sonnet \u201cDesign.\u201d\nTake heart! The more you learn about literature and the more you\npractice unraveling its meanings, the more adept you will become at\nunderstanding it. In fact, this is the case for all kinds of texts. Many students\njust beginning to study law, for instance, find the specialized language\n4 Reading Like a Professional\nand style of the field almost impossible to understand, but after a year\nor two of reading case documents, they undoubtedly find the task much\nless daunting. Similarly, students new to academic research articles and\nbooks often have difficulty plowing through them and then summarizing\nthe authors\u2019 points. Yet, after some practice, this task becomes much less\nchallenging and even\u2014dare I say it?\u2014intellectually stimulating!\nSo how does one improve comprehension of such texts? The following\n\u201cactive\u201d reading process is recommended to boost you beyond common\nfrustrations with challenging reading assignments. It may seem tedious at\nfirst, but if you practice it often enough, it will become second nature to\nyou as you tackle tough readings.\n1. Skim the text first. Get an idea of what sort of text you are\ndealing with. Is it an article based on primary research, such\nas experiments or participant interviews? Is it a critique of a\npreviously published study? Is it a personal essay based on the\nauthor\u2019s life? Is it a sonnet or a one-act play? How is the piece\nstructured? Can you find a statement or passage that seems to\ncapture the text\u2019s central message?\n2. Next, read the whole piece slowly and carefully. We cannot\nexpect to understand dense, sophisticated texts through the same\nreading process by which we might read a newspaper article or\na Facebook post. We must be willing to slow down to absorb\nsubtleties and complexities.\n3. Engage with the text. Annotate as you go. In other words, write\non the page! If you cannot write directly on the page, use sticky\nnotes or electronic note-taking strategies. Look up unfamiliar\nterms and jot down the definitions, highlight or underline key\nideas, and write down questions and ideas that come to you as you\nread. Note patterns in the text that might be considered later to\nhelp unravel the meaning.\n4. Reread the text as necessary. Seek to fill in gaps in your\nunderstanding that may remain after your first reading.\n5. Gather outside information about the piece\u2019s context if it is\nhelpful, though you should be careful not to \u201cread into\u201d the text\u2019s\nmeaning too much. Any historical or biographical interpretation\nof a literary work must still be supported by the text itself.\n5 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n6.

After skimming,\nrereading, annotating, and reacting to the text, compare your notes on\nthe speech\u2019s meaning with those of your classmates. Does this process\nof active reading give you a deeper understanding than a simple, passive\nreading would?\nThe Gettysburg Address\nFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought\nforth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty,\nand dedicated to the proposition that all men are created\nequal.\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing\nwhether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so\ndedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-\nfield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of\nthat field, as a final resting place for those who here gave\ntheir lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting\nand proper that we should do this.\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate\u2014we can\nnot consecrate\u2014we can not hallow\u2014this ground. The\nbrave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have\nconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say\nhere, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for\nus the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished\nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly\nadvanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the\ngreat task remaining before us\u2014that from these honored\ndead we take increased devotion to that cause for which\nthey gave the last full measure of devotion\u2014that we\nhere highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in\nvain\u2014that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth\nof freedom\u2014and that government of the people, by the\npeople, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\nAbraham Lincoln\nNovember 19, 1863\n8 Reading Like a Professional\nRegardless of the type of text you are confronted with, this engaged\nreading process should serve to deepen your understanding of it. An\nimportant assumption of this book is that as your reading skills become\nmore sophisticated, so will your writing. As you practice these methods\nof active reading, you will likely begin to regard your own writing in the\nsame way that you do the other texts you read. You will learn that the\nstrategies used by well-regarded authors are available to you as a writer,\nand you will begin to imagine your audience\u2019s reaction to your writing\nmore effectively than you have done in the past. You will start to recognize\nthat reading and writing are inextricably related to one another.\n9 2\nForming a Perspective\non the Subject\n2.1 Discovering and Honoring Your Passions and Values\nAfter reading a work carefully, annotating it, and reacting to it, the\nnext step is to determine how it fits into your perspective on the world. For\nexample, how do you feel about Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address?\nDo you appreciate Lincoln\u2019s assertion that in order to honor what these\ndead sacrificed, we should work hard to keep our democratic nation\ntogether? Or does it irritate you that in reminding his audience that in this\nnation, \u201call men were created equal,\u201d Lincoln neglects to acknowledge the\nterrible wrongs done to Native Americans as the nation was formed? Did\nyou tend to focus less on the theme of the speech and more on Lincoln\u2019s\nrhetorical strategy and poetic language? Forming your own conclusions\nabout a literary work, or a topic of any kind, is the first step to shaping an\nargument and, ultimately, making a case for your perspective through a\npersuasive essay.\nTo practice the process of forming a perspective on a topic,\nconsider Theodore Roethke\u2019s poem \u201cMy Papa\u2019s Waltz,\u201d at\nhttp:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poem\/172103. In an initial reading\nof the poem, you may have already noticed that some elements of \u201cMy\nPapa\u2019s Waltz\u201d seem to suggest that the father is abusive toward his son,\nwhile to the contrary, other lines imply that the son wants to continue this\nwaltz. Seeking the \u201ctruth\u201d of this poem, readers often debate over which\ninterpretation is being developed by Roethke. After careful analysis of\nthis text, first-year composition student Marion Velis decided that in spite\nof the poem\u2019s seemingly violent undertones, it is the son\u2019s love for his\nfather that leaves the strongest impression. What follows is the essay she\nproduced to develop this argument.\n10 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nMarion Velis\nEnglish 1102\nClinging to Love: Theodore Roethke\u2019s \u201cMy Papa\u2019s Waltz\u201d\nAt first glance, Theodore Roethke\u2019s poem \u201cMy Papa\u2019s\nWaltz\u201d may seem like a poem about a boy\u2019s fear of his\ncontrolling, abusive, alcoholic father. But the poem goes\nmuch deeper than that. Roethke uses specific rhythm,\nword choice, and a controlling metaphor to give the poem\na reminiscent tone that looks back on the father in love.\nOne of the most noticeable elements of the poem is its\nwaltz rhythm. Each line in the poem is made up of three\niambs, which create the six-count beat of a waltz. When\nRoethke combines this rhythm with specific words, the\nreader gets a spinning sensation. This is clearly shown in\nthe first stanza of the poem, when Roethke writes, \u201cThe\nwhiskey on your breath \/ Could make a small boy dizzy;\n\/ But I hung on like death: \/ Such waltzing was not easy\u201d\n(1-4). Roethke uses this waltzing rhythm in conjunction\nwith his description of a drinking father to convey the\nspinning, drunk feeling generated by this dance. When\nthe poet says, \u201cWe romped until the pans \/ Slid from the\nkitchen shelf\u201d (5-6), the reader can imagine the father\nspinning in his drunkenness and making a mess of the\nhouse. The speaker\u2019s mother seems ashamed in lines 7-8,\nwhere the poet writes, \u201cMy mother\u2019s countenance \/ Could\nnot unfrown itself.\u201d The boy, on the other hand, says,\n\u201cBut I hung on like death\u201d (3), as if he wanted to continue\nto love his father, despite his obvious flaws.\nThis is why the speaker\u2019s point of view is important.\nWhether the speaker is supposed to be Roethke or not is\nnot relevant. What is important is that Roethke chose to\nspeak here as a man looking back on his childhood. This\nperspective suggests an innocence about the \u201csmall boy\u201d\n(2) as if he couldn\u2019t fully understand what was going on,\nbut now that he is a man, he can look back objectively. Yet,\nstill, Roethke portrays the same love towards the father.\nThis lovingness towards the speaker\u2019s father is\nconveyed through the controlling metaphor in the poem,\n11 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nalong with specific diction. The poet compares the\nyoung boy\u2019s life with his father to a waltz and uses that\ncomparison to lighten the image of his father. When\nRoethke writes that the boy\u2019s father \u201cwaltzed [him] off\nto bed \/ Still clinging to [his] shirt\u201d (15-6), the reader\nsees the playfulness between father and son, like that\nimplied by the playful rhythm of the poem. The reader\nalso sees that in spite of \u201csteps\u201d the father \u201cmissed\u201d (11)\nthat caused the father\u2019s belt buckle to \u201cscrape\u201d the boy\u2019s\near (12), the boy \u201chung on like death\u201d (3), \u201cclinging\u201d (16)\nto his father with an unconditional love. The diction used\nhere is both disconcerting and urgent. One doesn\u2019t usually\nget \u201cscraped\u201d when dancing\u2014even the sound of this\nword creates a disturbing tone. But words like \u201cmissed,\u201d\n\u201cscraped,\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d are offset by words like \u201chung on\u201d\nand \u201cclinging.\u201d In the portrayal of this dance, the speaker\nreveals a yearning toward his father, rough though he\nwas, and the time they spent together.\nThe message of unconditional, eternal love is a\nrepeated theme throughout the poem. Roethke uses each\nelement of the poem to deliver that message, and when\nthe poem is looked at as a whole, it forwards that theme\nin a marvelous way.\nInstructions for effective writing usually emphasize clarity of purpose,\nsound logic, convincing evidence, effective structure, and impressive style,\nall crucial elements certainly. Yet, it is difficult to compose a truly persuasive\nargument if you, yourself, do not care about the subject. As you can see from\nMarion\u2019s essay, powerful writing can arise from a writer\u2019s desire to share\nher passion about the topic. So, what if you are given an assignment you\nare not initially interested in? You may not feel that poetry is your \u201cthing.\u201d\nOr maybe you feel like a \u201cfish out of water\u201d when required to write about\nhistory or business. However, for the best results, I strongly encourage you\nto find an angle of the topic that connects with what you care about.\nFor example, when art major Wesley Hardesty was assigned to write\na paper about an aspect of World War I, he found himself struggling to get\ninterested in the topic. For the first essay of the course, his professor had\nrequired a literary analysis paper over Ernest Hemingway\u2019s novel, The Sun\nAlso Rises. With some difficulty, Wesley had completed that assignment,\nsupporting his interpretation of the novel with key passages of the text as\n12 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nevidence. For Essay 2, however, which required students to research an\naspect of the novel\u2019s World War I context and formulate an argument on\nthat topic, Wesley was having trouble choosing a specific area of focus. He\nprocrastinated on the research, because each time he sat down at his computer\nto search for books and articles, his thoughts would wander and he would\nbecome bored. He could not seem to pinpoint any aspect of World War I on\nwhich he would be motivated to take a position and build an argument.\nFinally, he met with his professor and told her about his difficulty\ndeciding on a topic for his paper. During their conversation, she asked\nabout his major, his future career plans, and what he liked to do in his\nspare time. In response to her last question, he answered that he enjoyed\nplaying video games with his friends. She asked if he ever played Call\nof Duty. Soon, they were discussing whether the Call of Duty games\nauthentically recreate the experience of fighting as a soldier, the trauma of\nwhich Hemingway explores in The Sun Also Rises. They agreed that even\nthough the Call of Duty games focus on World War II rather than World\nWar I, this topic might be a fruitful one for Wesley\u2019s research essay.\nWhen Wesley got back to his dorm room and tried, once again,\nresearching for the paper, he found that this time, he was much more\nengaged in the task. Later, when he reviewed his notes on the games\nthemselves, as well as the psychology and history articles he had gathered\non the subject, he concluded that although the games do simulate actual\nwarfare in a number of ways, they cannot reproduce the same fear,\nuncertainty, and trauma that many soldiers experience during real wars.\nBelow is the product of Wesley\u2019s research and writing:\nWesley Hardesty\nComposition II\nCall of Duty: Short of Reality\nVideo games are often made to represent historical\nwar time events in a stronger sense than any other form\nof media. They immerse you as a participant in past\nhistorical events, but how well and in depth do they\nrecreate the actual historical event to make it your reality?\nA generation of military gamers who spend hours and\nhours playing Call of Duty think they understand and know\nmodern warfare, but do they really? Soldiers who have\nactually served in a time of war might beg to differ. Just as\n13 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nthere is evidence that shows there are some similarities in\ngaming and the real life combat that took place in World\nWar II, there is also evidence to show that what takes place\nin a video game such as Call of Duty can be quite different\nfrom what takes place in an actual combat mission during\na time of war. There are many bases for comparison and\ncontrast between actual war and Call of Duty, such as\nthe attitudes and feelings of a real soldier versus that of a\ngamer during times of combat, the skill level and training\nof an actual soldier versus that of a gamer, and the actual\nreal time combat events taking place during battle and that\nof a mission\u2019s story line in the game Call of Duty.\nJust as the attitude of a real soldier can be quite\ndifferent from the attitude of a gamer during a combat\nmission, it can also be quite similar. Most \u201cvideo games\ncombine the moral and narrative associations of the war\nwith the physical activity of shooting, creating a sense of\nmastery and control\u201d (Allison 183), all of which strongly\naffects the attitude of the player. After viewing many\ncombat videos captured on helmet mounted cameras of\nactual soldiers during a time of war\u2014showing things\nlike bombings, firefights, and airstrikes\u2014Luke Plunkett\nargues that a soldier\u2019s attitudes and emotional reactions\nto these things are \u201cnot too different to what you might\nhear over a headset on Xbox Live\u201d during a Call of Duty\nonline match. The reactions and emotional outbursts to\nsuch events are quite similar. In my own experience and\nobservations as a gamer, the outbursts consist of a mix\nof excitement, fear, and adrenaline. They also involve\na great deal of screaming and yelling in addition to\ndesperate calls for help. The soldier is calling to his fellow\nsquad members for help or back up, where a gamer is\nusually calling for another gamer for back up. The level\nof excitement is much the same, as most gamers become\nfully immersed in the game.\nHowever, in many of these videos the soldiers are\nalso wounded and in distress. This is where the attitudes\nare quite different. In a game of Call of Duty, if the\ngamer is injured there is always another life and the game\nmoves on. There are never the calls of desperation and\n14 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nabsolute panic that are seen and heard in helmet-cam\nvideos of actual soldiers. The Call of Duty video game\ntends to glorify war and the gamer cannot possibly relate\nto or comprehend the consequences of real violence or\ndeath in the way that the soldier experiences it in real life\ncombat. No game or video can possibly be as realistic\nas actual life events. Rejack says that \u201cclicks of a mouse\nor movements of a joystick do not provide a pathway to\nhistorical identification through the body in the way that\nrunning across the battlefield might\u201d (413). In addition,\nsoldiers who are deployed overseas during a time of war\nare fully engrossed in a lifestyle of combat and fear. They\nlive every day not knowing whether or not they will make\nit home to their family or loved ones. Call of Duty is just\na form of entertainment. Although many spend hours and\nhours engrossed in the game and fully immersed in the\nvirtual combat, they can never actually comprehend what\nit is like to live in the situations that a soldier is living in\ndaily. The gamer can choose to simply turn the game off.\nFurther, the skills needed to participate in actual\ncombat compared to the skills needed to participate in\nan online match of Call of Duty strongly differ, though\nthere are similarities. A \u201ccombination of tactical elements\nand intense battle scenes is one reason why the game has\nproved to be so popular\u201d (Rejack 414). During World War\nI and World War II, men were drafted into war and were\nsent into combat with hardly any training or experience,\nso many entered war with the skill level of a player new to\nCall of Duty. In the video game world \u201cusers are invited\nto take part in history from their living rooms, replicating\nthe museum from a video game console\u201d (Hess 341).\nThus, today\u2019s gamers might be under the illusion that they\ncould easily take on the same warfare challenges in real\nlife with the same success that they enjoy playing Call\nof Duty. However, in contrast, soldiers now have to go\nthrough intense physical, mental, weapon, and strategy\ntraining just to survive out in the field. The military\nprovides cutting-edge training throughout a soldier\u2019s\nmilitary career\u2014they do not just stop at boot camp.\nCurrently the military requires advanced training for their\n15 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nassigned occupational fields. The military uses advanced\nmodeling and simulations to provide very realistic\ntraining situations. Today\u2019s soldiers participate in realistic\ncombat role-playing exercises that include real weapons,\nspecial effects and explosions to recreate physical combat\nsettings before they are deployed. Our military is highly\nskilled before they are allowed to be deployed for combat.\nA gamer simply learns to press a few buttons on a handset\nor controller and he is prepared for virtual battle.\nWhile the storylines and the combat scenarios that\nCall of Duty uses follow many actual events that took\nplace in World War II, there are major gaps in these\nnarratives, as well. The Call of Duty game series includes\nnumerous games that specifically deal with the events\nof this particular war. In each game, the \u201cintersection\nbetween the gameplay narrative and the historical\nnarrative is underscored through mission objectives\u201d\n(Hess 345). There are four games in the Call of Duty series\nthat deal with World War II. These games include Call of\nDuty, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty:\nWorld at War. In each of these games, the player plays\nout numerous missions through an avatar-soldier of each\nUnited States alliance. Call of Duty, Call of Duty 2 and\nCall of Duty 3 all focus on the European conflict in which\nthe gamer goes to combat with the Germans. Call of Duty\n2 focuses only on the North African Campaign, including\nItaly and Sicily. Call of Duty: World at War focuses on\nthe United States Marine Corp fighting the Japanese\nin the Pacific, as well as the Red Army in the Eastern\nRegion. In most cases \u201cthe digital interface of a video\ngame mirrors the interface on dozens of computerized\ninstruments and weapons currently being used by the\nAmerican military\u201d (Allison 191), which makes the\ngames seem very realistic. However, although all of the\ngames in this series are modeled after actual World War\nII conflicts or missions and follow history quite closely,\ngames must allow for the individual experience of the\ngamer, while offering a likely chance of success for\nthe player. As a result, Call of Duty does not attempt to\nplay out the experiences of soldiers who actually fought\n16 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nin the war. In the games there are numerous objects to\ntake cover behind to avoid being shot\u2014in an actual war,\nthese shielding objects are not always available. Also,\nin actual war, most of the time you do not see who you\nare shooting at or who is shooting at you. You rarely\nget close enough to shoot accurately. Real war is not\nlike a video game where the enemy just pops up into\nyour view. In comparison, the terrain may be the same\nand the mission may be the same, but the video game\nlacks the sensory perception of actually being there. In\nthe game you do not experience the same smells, sights\nor feelings of actually being there. You can never feel\nyour heart rate getting above 120 beats per minute while\nyou lose control over your motor skills and cannot even\nreload your weapon. You cannot possibly understand or\nfeel what it would be like to carry over 100 pounds of\ngear up a mountain during firefight with an enemy in\ntemperatures above 100 degrees. As a gamer you get a\nglimpse into what war might be like, but your experience\ncannot substantially compare to actually being there in a\nreal life battle as a soldier.\nThe Call of Duty video game series continues to\nmake billions of dollars a year and keeps the developers\nat the top of their industry. Although gamers all over the\nworld wait on pins and needles for the next game release,\ngamers should be fully aware that it is just a form of\nentertainment. Even though these video games are often\nmade to represent historical events in a stronger sense\nthan any other form of media, the gaming experience still\nlacks much compared to actual historical events. While\nsomewhat accurate and realistic in comparison to modern\nwar and the actual events of the World Wars, there is\nstill an extreme contrast between playing the game and\nactually taking part as a real soldier at war.\nWorks Cited\nAllison, Tanine. \u201cThe World War II Video Game,\nAdaptation, and Postmodern History.\u201d Literature\nFilm Quarterly, vol. 38, no. 3, 2010, pp. 183-193.\n17 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nHess, Aaron. \u201c\u2018You Don\u2019t Play, You Volunteer\u2019:\nNarrative Public Memory Construction in Medal\nof Honor: Rising Sun.\u201d Critical Studies in Media\nCommunication, vol. 24, no. 4, 2007, pp. 339-356.\nPlunkett, Luke. \u201cForget Call of Duty, This is What Real\nWar Looks Like.\u201d Kotaku, 12 Sept. 2012, https:\/\/\nkotaku.com\/5947161\/forget-call-of-duty-this-is-\nwhat-real-war-looks-like\/.

Rather than attempting to base his thesis about soldiers\u2019\nexperience only on objective data, he interpreted the findings of his research\nat least partially by considering his own passion for and experience with\nvideo games. Why is his thesis important and valuable to his audience?\nHe implies that it is important because although in contemporary\nAmerican culture, gamers want the most authentic experience possible,\nthe authenticity of games like Call of Duty worries some people. Could it\ncause psychological damage as war can? Could it persuade young gamers\ntoward joining the military by providing an experience that seems both\nauthentic and pleasurable? Because Wesley considered his passions as well\nas his values in approaching this essay, the essay connected with concerns\nhis readers might share with him and was thus more effective than it might\nhave been if he had just \u201cjumped through the hoops\u201d of the assignment.\nYour composition professor might have important reasons for not\nallowing the same flexibility for paper topics that Wesley\u2019s professor did.\nPerhaps, as his instructor did in her Essay 1 assignment, your professor\nwill insist that you engage in literary textual analysis in order to meet\ncertain course outcomes, like understanding how literary strategy can be\nused for rhetorical purposes and demonstrating the ability to use text as\nevidence to support an argument. Regardless of the boundaries of your\nassignment, you are encouraged to find an angle that inspires you to real\npassion about your subject.\n18 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nTo recap this section\u2019s key ideas:\n1. When forming a perspective on a text or other topic, do not ignore\nyour own passions or values. Both Marion and Wesley drew on\nthese aspects of themselves to produce provocative essays.\n2. Be sure that your perspective (which will determine your argument)\nis supported by the evidence. If not, consider how your position\nneeds to be adjusted in light of the evidence. What if Wesley\u2019s\nresearch had revealed that video games can indeed reproduce the\nfull effect of war? How would his argument need to be revised?\nHow might he respond personally to the knowledge that the video\ngame experience is authentic after all? How might that knowledge\nbe useful or significant to his audience?\n2.2 Critical Perspectives\nForming your perspective on a poem, story, or play might be easier\nif you understand some of the approaches commonly taken toward\ninterpreting literature\u2019s meaning. Literary studies have been around long\nenough that likeminded readers and scholars have gravitated toward basic\ncommon positions as they engage in dialogue with each other. As a result,\nthere are a number of widely-recognized critical approaches to literature,\nfrom formalists (who focus on how an author employs strategies and\ndevices for a particular effect) to psychoanalytical critics (who explore\ntexts to better understand humans\u2019 psychological structure and their typical\nresponses to particular experiences). As you consider a poem or story, you\nmight choose one of these approaches as the general lens through which\nto examine that work. What follows is a list of some of the most common\ncritical perspectives. Consider them and make a note of any that strikes\nyou as particularly interesting. You may find that one or several of these\nreflect your own way of looking at the world.\nBiographical Criticism:\nThis approach examines the life and attitudes of an author as the key\nto understanding the writer\u2019s work. You should probably avoid heavy\ndependence on this approach, however, as you write essays for this class.\nCommonly used in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it has now\nbeen largely discounted as a reliable way to understand the meaning of a text.\n19 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nFormalism (also referred to as \u201cNew Criticism\u201d):\nRising to prominence in the 1920s, this approach considers a literary\nwork as an entity separate from its author and its historical context. The\nformalist explores a poem as a mechanic would explore an engine. The\nmechanic would assume that the engine\u2019s parts and function can be studied\nwithout any understanding of the maker\u2019s life and\/or the history of the\nperiod in which the engine exists. Similarly, to assess a poem\u2019s impact\nand understand its meaning, a scholar might \u201ctake it apart,\u201d considering\nits separate elements\u2014the form, line length, rhythm, rhyme scheme,\nfigurative language, and diction\u2014and how those pieces make up the effect\nof and shape the meaning of the whole.\nPsychoanalytical Criticism:\nBased on the theories of Freud and others, this approach examines\na text for signs and symbols of the subconscious processes, both of the\ncharacters and of humans in general. Revelatory symbols in a work might\ninclude water (the womb or the subconscious), a phallus (patriarchal\npower or sexual desire), a vessel such as a vase or pitcher (the vagina or\nsexual desire), and dark passageways (the feared subconscious where we\nstore our unacceptable impulses and desires, and in which we are afraid\nwe might get lost from the ordered, visible world).\nArchetypal Criticism:\nSpringing from psychoanalytical criticism, this approach focuses on\ncommon figures and story-lines that reveal patterns in human behavior\nand psychology. Well-known archetypal characters are the hero, the\nscapegoat, the Earth mother, the temptress, the mentor, and the devil\nfigure. Some common archetypal storylines are the journey, the quest, the\nfall, and death and rebirth. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, key figures\nin the development of this approach, found that in the many stories they\ncollected from cultures all over the world, these figures and storylines\nemerged over and over again. Their conclusion was that these figures and\nstorylines are etched into the human psyche (or subconscious), and as we\nrecreate them in our stories, our audiences recognize them as symbolic of\ntheir own experience.\nFeminist Criticism:\nUsing this approach, one examines a literary work for insight into why\nand how women are subjected to oppression and, sometimes, how they\nsubvert the forces that oppress them.\n20 Forming a Perspective on the Subject\nGender Theory:\nExpanding on feminist criticism, gender studies explore literature for\nincreased understanding of socially defined gender identity and behavior\nand its impact on the individual and on society. It includes study of sexual\norientation and how non-heterosexual identities are treated by mainstream\nideology, a dynamic sometimes reflected in, sometimes critiqued by,\nliterary works.\nMarxist Criticism:\nThis approach to literature examines how class and economic forces\nshape human dynamics. It is important to note that Marxist criticism\nis not a promotion of socialist government, but rather a close study of\nhow invisible economic forces underpin, and often undermine, authentic\nhuman relationships.\nHistorical Criticism:\nThis approach seeks to illuminate a text\u2019s original meaning by\nuncovering details of the text\u2019s historical context.\nNew Historicism:\nModifying the historical approach described above, the new historicist\nassumes that material factors interact with each other, thus while this\napproach seeks to understand a text through its cultural context, it also\nattempts to discover through the literary work insight into intellectual\nhistory. For example, a new historicist might consider Frederick Douglass\u2019s\nNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass as a product shaped not only\nby Douglass\u2019s experience as a U.S. slave, but also by Douglass\u2019s challenge\nof finding a publisher (most of whom were white), and by his primarily\nChristian readership. These factors, according to the new historicist, would\ninteract to shape the text and its meanings.\nIn finding a perspective that interests you, consider these common\nways of approaching literary study and interpretation and how those\napproaches might intersect with your own passions and values. Scholarly\nstudy should be objective, in that academic arguments should be supported\nby credible and substantial evidence, but scholarly argument is valuable\nwhen it aids us in better understanding our world and realizing our goals\nas humans, communities, and societies. Connecting to these objectives as\na writer will help you find your reason for writing and the most effective\nrhetorical methods for reaching your goals.\n21 3\nEffective Argument\n3.1 Logos, Ethos, and Pathos\nIn order to persuade a particular audience of a particular point, a\nwriter makes decisions about how best to convince the reader. Aristotle\nrecognized three basic appeals that a writer (or orator) should consider\nwhen presenting an argument: logos, ethos, and pathos.\n3.1.1 Logos\nConsider this hypothetical plea from Zach to his father: \u201cDad, could\nyou loan me money for gas until I get my paycheck at the end of the week?\nIf you do, I\u2019ll be able to haul your junk pile to the dump as well as drive\nmyself back and forth to work. I\u2019ll pay you back as soon as I get my check!\u201d\nLogos, a Latin term referring to logic, appeals to the reader\u2019s intellect.\nAs readers, we test arguments for their soundness. Does the writer make\nfalse assumptions? Are there gaps in the argument? Does the writer\nleap to conclusions without sufficient evidence to back up his claims?\nAs writers, it is our job to build a solid, well-explained, sufficiently\nsupported argument. In academic texts, logos is usually considered\nthe most important appeal since scholarly research is supposed to be\nobjective and thus more dependent on logic than on emotion (pathos)\nor on the reputation of the scholar (ethos). What about Zach\u2019s argument\nabove? Essentially, he asserts that a loan from his father would benefit\nboth Zach and his dad. Does the argument seem sound? We do not\nknow why Zach is short on cash this week\u2014his father may be aware\nthat Zach spent most of last week\u2019s check on the newest iPhone, so\nhe does not have enough to cover his gas this week. Thus, there may\nbe factors that undermine Zach\u2019s implication that his request is motivated\n22 Effective Argument\nby responsibility. However, he does offer evidence that the loan will\nallow him to fulfill his obligations.\nLogic is based on either inductive or deductive reasoning. Understanding\nthese types of logic can help us test the soundness of arguments, both our\nown and those of others.\nInductive Reasoning\nYou likely use inductive reasoning every day. By this kind of logic,\nwe form conclusions based on samples. Lab experiments, for example,\nmust be repeatable in order for scientists to gather a convincing amount\nof data to prove a hypothesis. If a scientist hypothesizes that addiction to\na particular drug causes a certain, predictable behavior, the experiment\nmust be carefully controlled, and must be repeated hundreds of times\nin order to prove that the behavior is consistently associated with the\naddiction and that other possible causes of that behavior have been ruled\nout. If we observe enough examples of an event occurring under similar\ncircumstances, we can employ inductive reasoning to draw a conclusion\nabout the pattern. For example, if we pay less each time we buy apples at\nSupermart than when we purchase apples at Pete\u2019s Grocery, we will likely\nconclude, inductively, that apples are less expensive at Supermart.\nLiterary argument is often based on inductive reasoning. Here are two\nillustrations of such reasoning:\n1. In Robert Frost\u2019s sonnet \u201cDesign,\u201d the color white is used ironically\nto suggest that only a devious designer would clothe the universe\u2019s\nevil in so much beauty. The \u201cdimpled spider, fat and white\u201d; the\n\u201cwhite heal-all\u201d flower that \u201chold[s] up\u201d the moth for the spider\u2019s\nfeast; and the rhyming of \u201cblight\u201d with \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cright\u201d work\ntogether to generate the poem\u2019s disturbing sense that the innocence\nimplied in the whiteness of the natural scene is deceptive.\n2. As powerful evidence of the irreversible destruction of war,\nHemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises presents Jake Barnes\u2019s struggles\nto overcome the damage incurred during his service as a soldier in\nWorld War I. Jake\u2019s difficulty coping with his injury, his tendency\nto self-medicate with alcohol, his inability to pray, and his\nfailure to sustain an intimate relationship with another person all\nexemplify the terrible destruction inflicted on him by the war.\n23 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nWhen writing a literary analysis essay, such as the paper that might\ndevelop from the second argument above, you will need to provide enough\nexamples to support your assertion that the pattern you observed in the text\ndoes, indeed, exist.\nDeductive Reasoning\nDeductive reasoning, on the other hand, is drawing a conclusion\nbased on a logical equation. It can be argued that we see deduction in\nits purest form in the context of scientific or mathematical reasoning. A\nlogical equation of this sort is based on a proven assumption and\/or clearly\nand inflexibly-defined terms. Commonly manifesting these conditions,\ncomputer programs accomplish tasks through deductive logic. For\nexample, Mary, an art major who has completed 24 credit hours, cannot\nregister for English 4500. This statement is true because the university\ncourse enrollment system is governed by the following logic: Only\nEnglish majors with 30 or more credit hours may register for English\n4500. Students who have not officially declared as English majors and\/or\nwhose records do not exhibit completion of credit hours equal to or greater\nthan 30 will be automatically prevented from registering for English 4500.\nSimilarly, the following statement is based on deductive logic: Glyptol\npaint cannot be cleaned up with water only. This conclusion is based on the\nfact that Glyptol contains alkyds, which are not water soluble. Therefore,\nclean-up of any paint containing alkyds will require turpentine or another\npetroleum-based solvent.\nHaving examined deductive reasoning in its pure form, however,\nwe can see that argument will rarely be required in such a context.\nInvestigation may be required in order to determine the characteristic and\/\nor definition of a material, but once the facts are ascertained, scientists will\nnot need to debate whether or not alkyds are water-soluble. Persuasion\nbecomes relevant when the issue moves beyond proven facts. As we\nexplore issues of ethics and values, logical reasoning can seem a bit\nmushy, yet rather than throw up their hands in abandonment of deductive\nreasoning, humanities scholars generally work hard to establish valid\nassumptions, or generally agreed-upon notions, that can be used to help\nhumans move closer to reasonable, or logical, social and political beliefs\nand behaviors.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes\nis famous for employing deductive reasoning to solve mysteries. In \u201cFive\nOrange Pips,\u201d Holmes uses deductive reasoning to work as far as possible\ntoward solving John Openshaw\u2019s case, based on the facts Holmes and\nWatson have been given:\n24 Effective Argument\nNow let us consider the situation and see what\nmay be deduced from it. In the first place, we may\nstart with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw\nhad some very strong reason for leaving America. Men\nat his time of life do not change all their habits and\nexchange willingly the charming climate of Florida\nfor the lonely life of an English provincial town. His\nextreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea\nthat he was in fear of someone or something, so we\nmay assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\nsomeone or something which drove him from America.\nAs to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that\nby considering the formidable letters which were received\nby himself and his successors. Did you remark the\npostmarks of those letters?\nEquations such as the ones being forwarded by Holmes, when seen in their\ncomplete form, comprise a three part logical statement called a syllogism.\nThe statement includes\n1. A general statement, or major premise: Middle-aged men do\nnot readily embrace change.\n2. A minor premise: Colonel Openshaw is a middle-aged man.\n3. And a conclusion: Colonel Openshaw would not have changed\nhis circumstances without a strong impetus.\nAlthough some might argue that Holmes came to the major premise\nthrough inductive reasoning (observing the behavior of many, many\nmiddle-aged men), in the above passage, he asserts the major premise as\nthe basis for his deductive logical equation proving that Colonel Openshaw\nmust have had a strong impetus for leaving America. If we agree with\nHolmes\u2019s premise, we are likely to trust his conclusion.\nHere is a more questionable logical equation, considered by the\ncharacters of Stephen Crane\u2019s short story \u201cThe Open Boat\u201d:\nIf I am going to be drowned\u2014if I am going to be\ndrowned\u2014if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name\nof the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed\nto come thus far and contemplate sand and trees? Was\n25 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nI brought here merely to have my nose dragged away\nas I was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life? It is\npreposterous. If this old ninny-woman, Fate, cannot do\nbetter than this, she should be deprived of the management\nof men\u2019s fortunes. She is an old hen who knows not her\nintention. If she has decided to drown me, why did she\nnot do it in the beginning and save me all this trouble.\nThe whole affair is absurd.... But, no, she cannot mean to\ndrown me. She dare not drown me. She cannot drown me.\nNot after all this work.\nThe following syllogism reflects the men\u2019s attitude:\n1. Major premise: The world is just and reasonable.\n2. Minor premise: All of the men in the life-boat are good men and\nare working hard to survive.\n3. Conclusion: All of the men should survive.\nYou can see in the latter example that sometimes syllogisms are flawed,\nor illogical. Most of us doubt, at least some of the time, that the universe\nis indeed just and reasonable, at least by human standards. If it is not just,\nthen the men\u2019s conclusion that they ought to survive may be incorrect.\nThe occurrence of flawed logic is most problematic when we find an\nequation in its incomplete form: an enthymeme. If we consider the major\npremise as the underlying assumption, and recognize that this premise\noften goes unstated, we see that the enthymeme is a type of elliptical\nstatement that sometimes \u201cleaps\u201d to its conclusion unreasonably. Consider\nthe following examples:\nSample 1\n\u2022 Enthymeme: Sarah, don\u2019t eat that beef; it came from Bob\u2019s Caf\u00e9.\n\u2022 Major premise: All food from Bob\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is bad.\n\u2022 Minor premise: That beef came from Bob\u2019s Caf\u00e9.\n\u2022 Conclusion: That beef is bad.\nSample 2\n\u2022 Enthymeme: Lisa Harmon would be a good hire for our company;\nshe has a degree from Harvard University.\n26 Effective Argument\n\u2022 Major premise: Anyone with a degree from Harvard University\nwould be a good employee for our company.\n\u2022 Minor premise: Lisa has a degree from Harvard University.\n\u2022 Conclusion: Lisa would be a good employee for our company.\nSample 3\n\u2022 Enthymeme: Kill Bill is a chick flick.\n\u2022 Major premise: Any movie that features a female protagonist is a\nchick flick.\n\u2022 Minor premise: Kill Bill features a female protagonist.\n\u2022 Conclusion: Kill Bill is a chick flick.\nAs you test the major premises above, how do they fare? Are they true?\nIf a writer asserted the above enthymemes, would you, as the reader, agree\nwith the major premise of each? Why or why not? What is the danger of\nreading (or hearing) only the enthymeme and not testing the underlying\n(unspoken) assumption which would complete the syllogism?\nLogical Fallacies:\nWhether an assertion is based on inductive or deductive reasoning,\nwhen we test a claim, it helps to know about the following logical fallacies\ncommonly found in weak arguments:\nBandwagon Argument:\nThis claim encourages us to agree with a particular opinion because\n\u201ceveryone else agrees with it.\u201d Frost\u2019s \u201cDesign\u201d implies an evil creator;\nseveral important critics agree that this is Frost\u2019s message. Does the text\nitself support this theory?\nSingle Cause:\nThis kind of argument suggests that a problem results from one\nparticular cause when the causes may actually be complex and multiple:\nIn The Great Gatsby, it is Gatsby\u2019s decision to pursue a decadent woman\nlike Daisy that leads to his downfall. Are there any other factors that might\nlay the groundwork for the tragic events of the novel?\n27 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nEither\/Or:\nThis type of statement implies that there are only two options: Roethke\u2019s\npoem \u201cMy Papa\u2019s Waltz\u201d either points to abuse, or it emphasizes the love\nbetween father and son. Is it possible for both to be true?\nSlippery Slope:\nIn this kind of argument, the writer warns that one step in the \u201cwrong\u201d\ndirection will result in complete destruction: If the instructor curves the\ngrade for this assignment, students will expect a curve on all assignments,\nand they will lose their motivation to work hard toward their own learning.\nIs the compromised course grade inevitable as the result of one curved\nassignment grade? A similar argument is the following: If the government\ngives welfare to poor citizens, those citizens will become permanently\ndependent on \u201chandouts\u201d and will lose their motivation to work for a living.\nStraw Man:\nIn this approach, the writer holds up an extreme and usually easy-\nto-defeat example of the opposition as the general representative of\nthat opposition instead of considering the opposition\u2019s most reasonable\narguments. Senator Jill Campbell was convicted of bribery, confirming\nthat politicians can\u2019t be trusted. Are there any ethical politicians? If so,\nthis conclusion is logically flawed.\nFalse Cause:\nHere, the writer offers a cause that seems linked to the problem but\ndoes not actually establish the causal relationship. The university cut\nthree class days due to snow, and now I\u2019m failing history; therefore, the\nuniversity should have added three extra days to the semester.\nAs you listen to and read arguments forwarded by others, test the\nclaims carefully to ensure that you are not accepting an illogical line of\nthinking. Also, carefully review your own arguments to avoid forwarding\nfaulty logic yourself!\n3.1.2 Ethos\nEthos, an appeal based on the credibility of the author, can affect a\nreader\u2019s willingness to trust the writer. This credibility is often generated\nby the author\u2019s apparent ethics. If the reader perceives that she shares\nimportant values with the writer, the door of communication opens wider\nthan if the writer and reader seem to lack common values. Reflecting back\n28 Effective Argument\nto Zach\u2019s request for a loan from his father, Zach does remind his father\nsubtly that the loan will allow him to work, both at his job and at home.\nThis respect for work is likely a value held by Zach\u2019s father, so it becomes\nimportant common ground for the argument.\nConsider again the previously presented thesis about Hemingway\u2019s\nThe Sun Also Rises:\nAs powerful evidence of the irreversible destruction\nof war, Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises presents Jake\nBarnes\u2019s struggles to overcome the damage incurred during\nhis service as a soldier in World War I. Jake\u2019s difficulty\ncoping with his injury, his tendency to self-medicate with\nalcohol, his inability to pray, and his failure to sustain an\nintimate relationship with another person all exemplify the\nterrible destruction inflicted on him by the war.\nHopefully, the writer, let\u2019s call him Bill, will go on to support, with\nevidence from the text, the claim that the portrayal of Jake\u2019s struggles\npromotes anti-war sentiment. Beyond the logical soundness of the\nargument, however, the reader will inevitably react on a personal level to\nthe values underlying the statement. Bill, in his decision to focus on this\naspect of the text, seems to appreciate the anti-war stance he observes in\nthe novel. If the reader is sympathetic to this position, she may be more\nopen to Bill\u2019s argument as a whole.\nAside from the writer\u2019s ethics, ethos can also be generated by the\nauthor\u2019s credibility, which is usually based on (1) the ability to forward a\nlogical argument (hence, ethos can be affected by logos!), (2) thoroughness\nof significant research, and (3) credentials proving the writer\u2019s expertise.\nIf Bill is not an expert in the field of literary studies yet, but is a sophomore\nEnglish Major, he may have no recognizable credentials to persuade\nthe reader in his favor. But if he has been careful and thorough in his\npresentation of evidence (passages and examples from the text itself) and\nhas considered (and possibly integrated) material from scholarly articles\nand books to help define and support his argument, his ethos is likely to\nbe strong.\n3.1.3 Pathos\nWhat about pathos, or the appeal to the reader\u2019s emotions? Certainly,\nZach\u2019s father will be affected by his feelings for his son Zach as he\nconsiders whether to loan Zach the money for gas, but what about in a more\n29 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nacademic or professional context? Even though the goal of an academic\nwriter is to approach a research topic as objectively as possible, even\nscholars are people, and people are emotional creatures. Bill\u2019s awareness\nof this fact leads him to choose some particularly poignant passages from\nHemingway\u2019s novel to support his point:\nThe damage caused by Jake\u2019s war experience is not\nonly physical but also psychological. For example, after\nlooking in the mirror at the scar from his wound, he lies in\nbed unable to sleep:\nI lay awake thinking and my mind\njumping around. Then I couldn\u2019t keep\naway from it, and I started to think about\nBrett and all the rest of it went away. I\nwas thinking about Brett and my mind\nstopped jumping around and started to\ngo in sort of smooth waves. Then all of\na sudden I started to cry. Then after a\nwhile it was better and I lay in bed and\nlistened to the heavy trams go by and\nway down the street, and then I went to\nsleep. (Hemingway 31)\nAlthough Jake makes a convincing show in public of\ndealing with his trauma, this passage reveals the challenge\nhe faces in trying to cope.\nAlthough Bill\u2019s readers will critically consider whether this passage\nlogically supports Bill\u2019s claim, it is likely that they will also react\nemotionally to Jake\u2019s anguish, thus reinforcing the persuasive\neffectiveness of Bill\u2019s argument.\n3.2 Audience Awareness\nFor success in any project, a writer must be aware of and carefully\nconsider his audience. Zach seems to know his audience pretty well\u2014the\nevidence he presents that a loan would benefit both Zach and his father\nshows that Zach understands his father\u2019s values, and chances are good that\nZach considers his filial status as an advantage with this audience. After\nall, he did ask his father, rather than a stranger, for the loan.\n30 Effective Argument\nOn the other hand, an academic audience can be a tough one since\nscholars are trained to consider claims critically, rigorously questioning\nand testing their validity. Your professors are in this camp, and you and your\npeers are quickly joining these ranks as well. While this audience is not a\nhighly sympathetic one, its critical rigor is not intended for intimidation but\nfor establishing and maintaining high standards of thought and research.\nAcademia\u2019s purpose is to maintain and improve the quality of our world,\nso you are encouraged to consider this audience as a factor as you work to\nproduce increasingly significant and well-written texts.\n3.3 Evidence\n3.3.1 Primary Sources\nPrimary Evidence is the thing we study. In academic writing, this\nkind of evidence differs according to discipline. In biology and chemistry,\nprimary evidence can be an experiment\u2019s results. In the field of history,\nit might be a letter written by a World War I soldier, a memo issued by a\nU.S. president, a Civil War bullet, or cave drawings. In sociology, it can\nbe the data gathered from participant surveys (quantitative) or information\narising from a case study (qualitative).\nIn the field of English literature, primary evidence comes from the\npoem, novel, short story, play, or memoir you are studying. Bill, for example,\npresents direct quotes from the novel The Sun Also Rises supporting specific\nclaims he forwards in his argument, as well as summarized and paraphrased\npassages in which he describes, in his own words, key occurrences in the\nnovel. Below, he summarizes a conversation between Jake and Robert Cohn,\ncondensing a lengthy passage of dialogue into one sentence:\nIn an early conversation between Jake and Robert Cohn,\nJake warns his friend that Cohn desires to go to South\nAmerica only because he has been reading sentimental\nliterature.\nLater, paraphrasing the novel\u2019s description of Jake\u2019s and his friends\u2019\nresponse to a bullfight, Bill translates Hemingway\u2019s words into his own in\nabout the same number of words as the original passage:\nJake observes Brett for any signs of serious disturbance\nas she watches the matador kill the bull, but Brett is not\nupset by the scene. Instead she expresses her appreciation\nfor the matador\u2019s extraordinary grace.\n31 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nThese examples from the primary text support Bill\u2019s argument, but\nhow does Bill decide when to quote, summarize, or paraphrase?\nThese decisions are important ones for effectively incorporating\nprimary evidence into an essay. Here are a few guidelines as you consider\nthese options in your own writing:\nQuotes:\nUse the shortest quote possible to generate (a) the evidence needed\nand (b) the effect you seek. Be careful to avoid long quotes unless they\nserve a significant purpose in forwarding your argument. Do use quotes to\n\u201cliven up\u201d your argument, to bring the voice of the literary text into your\nacademic prose.\nSummary:\nUse summary to provide a broad-scoped piece of evidence (a long\npassage from the novel, for example) to the reader. That \u201cJake and Brett have\nmultiple tension-filled encounters\u201d (Bill\u2019s summary) is evidence that they\nstill care for each other even though they cannot overcome Jake\u2019s impotence\nto settle into a committed relationship. There may be no need in this section\nof Bill\u2019s essay to focus more closely on particular tension-filled exchanges.\nParaphrase:\nEmploy paraphrase when the content of a scene or passage is pertinent\nbut does not require the original language itself. Bill\u2019s description of Jake\u2019s\nand Brett\u2019s behavior during the bullfight is a helpful example of effective\nparaphrase use.\n3.3.2 Secondary Sources\nAlthough the proof that Jake\u2019s struggles reveal the destructive potential\nof war must come from the novel itself, the primary source, Bill can use\nsecondary sources to (a) help explain his perspective on the novel, and (b)\nindicate how his argument fits into the ongoing scholarly dialogue about\nthe novel. Plenty of people have contributed to the conversation on the\nmeaning of The Sun Also Rises. Bill\u2019s goal is to say something new, to bring\nthe reader fresh insight about the novel, to contribute something original\nto the conversation. To clarify the significance of his argument, he can\nintegrate material from carefully selected scholarly articles and books.\nHow does one find and use secondary sources? Chapter 8 elaborates on\nthese processes. But to get started, we can discuss some of the basics here.\nFirst, let\u2019s distinguish between popular and scholarly, or peer-reviewed,\n32 Effective Argument\nsources. There is a vast amount of information available on a vast number of\ntopics, both in print and on the internet. Most digital and print publications\nthese days are written for a popular, or mass, audience. Since the average\nreader is not writing a research project on the topic he is interested in, most\ntexts are written for the non-expert. Such a reader, having just finished The\nSun Also Rises, might seek some basic general information on Hemingway\nor on World War I, which could easily be found on sites such as Wikipedia\nor the Poetry Foundation website (poetryfoundation.org).\nHowever, the scholar who is working on her own research project needs\nmore in-depth analysis than is provided in these popular sources. Thus,\nshe must gather academic or scholarly resources. These are written for an\nexpert audience, assuming that this reader already has a more sophisticated\nknowledge and understanding of the subject and is researching a specific\naspect of the topic rather than looking for general information. These\nsources are often more difficult to find and obtain. They are rarely free and\nmust usually be accessed through a university library system.\nThe differences between the purposes and production processes of\npopular and scholarly sources result in their having distinct characteristics.\nHere is a chart to help you visualize the differences:\nPopular sources Scholarly sources\nExample Time Magazine, Spark Notes, An article from The\nor Shmoop article Hemingway Review\nLocation Newsstand or internet Subscribed to by universities\n(accessible through a Google and libraries. Usually\nsearch) accessible only to members of\nthose institutions\nTarget Non-expert, lay reader Experts\/professionals in a\nreader particular area of study\nAppearance Glossy visuals, eye-catching Plain text; generally not\nlayout, strategies to attract marketed at all since experts\nbuyers\/readers are professionally motivated to\nseek out this kind of resource\n33 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nProduction \u2022 Written not by experts in \u2022 Written by experts in the\nprocess the field but by journalists field\nand other professional \u2022 Reviewed by the expert\u2019s\nwriters peers and accepted\n\u2022 Fact-checked and edited or rejected by their\nby publishing and recommendation\nediting professionals (or \u2022 Edited by journal or press\nsometimes not at all) editor\n\u2022 Published every month, \u2022 As a result of the research\nevery week, or sometimes and peer-review process,\neven daily these journals are usually\npublished only 1-4 times\nannually\nFeatures Short articles, meant to Long articles, sometimes\nbe read in one sitting; no based on a year or more of\nbibliography; short, clear research\/ analysis; include\nparagraphs and sentences; substantial bibliography of\nvocabulary meant for middle other peer-reviewed sources\nto high school reading level; used in research; vocabulary\nusually published for profit often specialized, reasoning\noften complex, targeting\nreaders familiar with the field;\npublished by academic journals\nor not-for-profit university\npresses\n3.4 Articulating an Effective Thesis\nThe understanding of pathos, logos and ethos is crucial to formulating\na significant and arguable thesis, which should capture the essence of your\nperspective on a text. The argument itself will require much more than a\nsentence or two, but the thesis, or the statement of the central argument, is\nan important tool in presenting a persuasive case. It should relay to your\nreader the specific point around which the rest of the argument revolves\nand why that point is so important.\nYou are encouraged to compose, early in your writing process, a\nworking thesis. At this point, the thesis is not yet set in stone, but it will\nhelp guide your research and your logic as you formulate your case. Once\nyou have analyzed the text, read the research on your topic, and determined\nyour perspective and purpose, you will need to revise and refine your thesis\nto ensure that it sets up and controls your argument with real impact.\n34 4\nExperiencing the\nPower of Poetry\n4.1 Analyzing Poetry\nOur exploration of literary genres brings us first to poetry, with good\nreason: Because many people are intimidated by poetry, especially \u201cold\u201d\npoetry, facing our fears is the first step toward prowess and confidence as\nscholars and writers. Furthermore, this brave plunge into poetry comes\nwith a bonus: Once we manage to \u201copen up\u201d a poem, we can experience\nits power and beauty, as well as its insights into human life. We begin with\nJohn Keats\u2019s 1819 \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn.\u201d\nThou still unravish\u2019d bride of quietness,\nThou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,\nSylvan historian, who canst thus express\nA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\nWhat leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape 5\nOf deities or mortals, or of both,\nIn Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\nWhat men or gods are these? what maidens loth?\nWhat mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\nWhat pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? 10\nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\nNot to the sensual ear, but, more endear\u2019d,\nPipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:\nFair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave 15\nThy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;\nBold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,\n35 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nThough winning near the goal\u2014yet, do not grieve;\nShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,\nFor ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! 20\nAh, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed\nYour leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;\nAnd, happy melodist, unwearied,\nFor ever piping songs for ever new;\nMore happy love! more happy, happy love! 25\nFor ever warm and still to be enjoy\u2019d,\nFor ever panting, and for ever young;\nAll breathing human passion far above,\nThat leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy\u2019d,\nA burning forehead, and a parching tongue. 30\nWho are these coming to the sacrifice?\nTo what green altar, O mysterious priest,\nLead\u2019st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\nAnd all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\nWhat little town by river or sea shore, 35\nOr mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\nIs emptied of this folk, this pious morn?\nAnd, little town, thy streets for evermore\nWill silent be; and not a soul to tell\nWhy thou art desolate, can e\u2019er return. 40\nO Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede\nOf marble men and maidens overwrought,\nWith forest branches and the trodden weed;\nThou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought\nAs doth eternity: Cold pastoral! 45\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\nThou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say\u2019st,\n\u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty\u2019\u2014that is all\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know. 50\n(1819)\nUpon a first reading of this British Romantic poem, not only does the\nlanguage elude us, but even much of the imagery may be unfamiliar. If\n36 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\nwe have ever seen an urn, it probably contained the ashes of a relative and\nwas likely not decorated with scenes like those described in the poem. So\nhow do we conquer our fears and dive in to unravel the poem\u2019s meaning?\nHere are some pointers for getting started:\n1. Read full sentences (if they exist in the poem) without stopping at\nthe end of the line.\n2. Look up words you do not know and write their definitions on\nthe page.\n3. Note recurring ideas or images\u2014color code these with highlighters\nfor visual recognition as you look at the poem on the page.\n4. Determine formal patterns. Is there a regular rhythm? How\nwould you describe it? Can it be characterized by the number of\nsyllables in each line? If not, do you note a certain number of beats\n(moments where your voice emphasizes the sound) in the line?\nAre there rhyming sounds? Where do they occur?\n5. What is the overarching effect of all these elements taken together?\nWhat do you think is the message conveyed by the poem?\nHere is a copy of the poem after first year composition student Judy\nSmith reviewed it carefully and annotated it with notes and highlights:\nOde: a poem Ode on a Grecian Urn Urn: a decorative\npaying tribute vase\nto someone or Thou still unravish\u2019d bride of quietness,\nsomething Unravish\u2019d:\nThou foster-child of Silence and slow Time,\nuninitiated,\nSylvan historian, who canst thus express\nSylvan: sexually?\nA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\nassociated with\nthe woods What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape Arcadia:\nOf deities or mortals, or of both, Beautiful and\nTempe: a valley In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? wild region of\nin Greece where What men or gods are these?

Google search\u2014\nrefers to Attica,\nO Attic shape! fair attitude! with brede region where\nBeauty and truth Of marble men and maidens overwrought, Athens, Greece\nare the same With forest branches and the trodden weed; is located\nthings; how so?\nThou, silent form! dost tease us out of thought\nThis is the urn\u2019s\nAs doth eternity; Cold Pastoral!\nfinal message to Brede:\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\nhumanity. embroidery\nThou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\nThe urn will Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say\u2019st\noutlast the poet. \u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\u2014that is all\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.\u2019\n38 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\nConsidering the poem\u2019s meaning in light of her annotations, Judy\nmakes a few additional observations in her notes:\n1. The rhythm of each line includes ten syllables, with the accent on\nthe second syllable of each pair.\n2. The rhymes are almost regular: The first stanza end-sounds follow\nthe pattern of A, B, A, B, C, D, E, C, E, D. The next stanza is close,\nbut varies a bit: A, B, A, B, C, D, E, C, D, E. Stanzas three and\nfour follow the same pattern as two, but the final stanza reflects\nthe switched sounds of the final two lines that we saw in stanza\none. So the poem is very formal, generally, but it does feature this\none odd shift. Why?\n3. The positive and negative words and phrases seem to pull against\neach other. In some ways it might be terrible to be \u201cstuck\u201d in\ntime\u2014the youth wants to kiss his lover, but he\u2019ll never be able to.\nThe figures on the urn can\u2019t leave to go on with their lives. But the\nurn\u2019s creator has captured a moment where everything is ripe\u2014\nthe tree is full and green and will never lose its leaves. Maybe the\nfeeling of desire the youth feels for the girl is even better than the\nactual kiss will be.\n4. In the second stanza, \u201cHeard melodies are sweet, but those\nunheard\u201d seems to mean that we can\u2019t hear the \u201cheard melodies.\u201d\nI can\u2019t make sense of that. But if I read the whole sentence,\nincluding a bit of the stanza\u2019s second line, it starts to make sense:\n\u201cHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard \/ are sweeter.\u201d So\nthe melody played by the urn\u2019s pipers is sweeter than if we could\nactually hear it! Not sure why yet, but it\u2019s an interesting claim.\n5. The urn won\u2019t change like the real world will\u2014is this a good thing\nor not? The speaker says the urn helps us see beyond our ordinary\n\u201cthought,\u201d maybe to see real beauty, which is rare? And beauty is\ntruth, so the beauty in the urn reveals a kind of truth? What is that\ntruth? It sounds like Keats does have a high regard for art\u2019s place\nin the world, though I\u2019m not sure being \u201cstuck\u201d in the perfect\nmoment is what we really want.\nThe process in which Judy has engaged fulfills the process of\nannotating a text to better understand it, discussed in Chapter 1, refining\nthat process to fit the conventions of poetry. To go a step further, Judy\n39 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nmight use these notes to form a perspective on the poem and compose an\nessay arguing for that perspective.\nKeats is an example of a poet who employs traditional elements\nof poetry to great effect. But what about a poem that seems to resist\nsome of the conventions traditionally associated with poetry? Consider\nLangston Hughes\u2019s 1926 poem, \u201cThe Weary Blues,\u201d located at\nhttp:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poem\/176785. Try using the process\noutlined above for unpacking the poem and then spend a few minutes\nmaking observations about the poem\u2019s meaning and effects. What do you\nthink the poem might be saying to us?\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. You may have noticed that instead of the traditional iambic\npentameter used by Keats in \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d Hughes\u2019s\nform here sounds more contemporary. Reading it aloud reveals\nits blues rhythms\u2014its own syncopation, for example, like that\nthe speaker describes in the old blues singer\u2019s song. Why might\nHughes have chosen this form instead of the iambic pentameter\nrhythm in \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d?\n2. The speaker seems to enjoy the performance of the blues singer,\nbut he notes that the singer finishes, goes to bed, and sleeps \u201clike\na rock or a man that\u2019s dead\u201d (line 35). What emotions are usually\nassociated with the blues? Why do people sing the blues? Why do\npeople go to clubs to hear someone else sing the blues and maybe\neven dance to the songs? With these issues in mind, what do you\nthink the poem\u2019s last line means?\n3. How does Hughes convey the dialect of the singer? Are these dialect\nfeatures important to the overall effect of the poem? How so?\n4.2 Considering the Writer\u2019s Life\nReaders are often tempted to look for insight into a poem by reading\nabout the poet. Many professors will discourage students from integrating\nthe poet\u2019s biographical background into a paper as evidence of the\nstudents\u2019 interpretation of the poem. After all, look how much we gained\nfrom analyzing the poem itself. As mentioned earlier, formalism, an\napproach to literary criticism that came about in the 1920s and remains\nwell-regarded by many today, holds that artwork (including literature)\nshould be considered as an object separate from the author. Formalists\nfeel that a text means on its own. The practice of analyzing a poem\u2019s\n40 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\neffects apart from the poet\u2019s biography is an important one. If we interpret\nthe poem with preformed ideas about the message a poet would probably\nwant to convey, we might miss elements in the poem that are staring us\nright in the face. We know from our own observations of Hughes\u2019s poem\nthat \u201cThe Weary Blues\u201d challenges traditional poetic forms, so we are\nalready curious about why he might have chosen this form. However, after\nperforming our own analysis, it can be intriguing and sometimes helpful\nto consider the author\u2019s life. An African American, Hughes wrote during\nthe Harlem Renaissance, the first large-scale African American artistic\nmovement. Although he had read the poetry of many well-regarded\nBritish and American poets, he determined to raise the status of African\nAmerican folk forms, challenging the idea that great art must follow the\ntraditions of European forms. Adding this biographical and historical\ncomponent to our study increases our understanding of the importance of\nHughes\u2019s contribution to the improvement of African American lives and\nhis celebration of African Americans\u2019 part in shaping U.S. culture.\n4.3 Literary Terminology\nWhen you enter the dialogue of an unfamiliar discipline, you are\noften confronted with unfamiliar vocabulary. If you have ever read a legal\ndocument, you understand this challenge of venturing into the territory\nof an unfamiliar professional dialogue. You may hesitate to sign this\ndocument until you have had a chance to look up the meanings of key\nwords in order to ensure that you really agree with the terms you\u2019re signing\noff on. Similarly, in the fields of biology, political science, and education,\nwe may run into specialized vocabulary that we must master in order to\nenter the dialogue of the field. Your academic essays in various disciplines\nrepresent your forays into these dialogues.\nLiterary studies can be frustrating for students because many already\nenjoy reading literature and talking about their favorite books with their\nfriends. So, when a professor insists that students use specific literary\nterms to express their views on a work, students are sometimes forced to\nreview their understanding of the terms themselves before they can write\nan English paper. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just explain in my own way why the novel\nis so powerful?\u201d a student might ask.\nTo find the answer to this seemingly reasonable question, consider\na parallel situation. If your car was running badly, you could go to the\nmechanic and tell her your impression of the problem: \u201cIt\u2019s been making\na weird sound. Instead of the usual hum of the engine, it sounds more like\n\u2018mm-pachuk, mm-pachuk.\u2019 I\u2019ve also noticed my gas mileage is lower than\n41 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nnormal.\u201d The mechanic might be able to look under the hood, drive the car,\nand figure out the issue, but some car-owners worry that if they present\nthe problem to the mechanic this way, not only will it take longer for the\nmechanic to diagnose the problem and fix it, but she might even take\nadvantage of their ignorance and complete expensive additional \u201crepairs\u201d\nthat are not immediately necessary.\nYour ethos, or credibility, is weak in such an exchange, and that\nweakness may cost you extra time and money. However, if you were to\ntell the mechanic that you believe the car needs a new spark plug, your\nethos would be stronger. The mechanic would recognize your relative\nexpertise and might be more likely to call and ask for your approval before\naddressing other issues. In this case, simply using common professional\nterminology would have improved your position. Similarly, scientists\nusing the accepted terms of their disciplines will be listened to with more\nrespect than those using unconventional vocabulary (\u201cthe blobby-looking\norganism\u201d). Your expertise is evidenced, in some part, by your ability to\nemploy accepted terminology.\nWhat terms are important to our study of literature? Some terms\noverlap among genres, but we will begin with the terms useful to the\nstudy of poetry. The term genre distinguishes one type of literature\nfrom another. The major genres are poetry, fiction, drama, and creative\nnonfiction. However, genre can also be used to refer to subcategories\nof each; for example, fiction can be broken down into novel and short\nstory, and the novel can itself be broken into genres such as the mystery\nnovel, the romance novel and the science fiction novel. Sometimes the\nword form is used almost interchangeably with genre. This overlap is\nnot entirely surprising since we often consider the form of a work as a\nclue to its genre. To illustrate, consider the difference between the visual\nappearance of a poem on the page as compared with that of a short story.\nIn this case, we can see the differences in form. However, though their\nmeanings overlap, form does have a meaning distinct from that of genre.\nThe term form can be used to indicate very specific features of a work. A\nsonnet is a poetic form that traditionally employs fourteen lines in iambic\npentameter (see iambic pentameter below). A villanelle, on the other hand,\nis a poetic form requiring nineteen lines, distributed into five tercets and\na quatrain, and also requiring that the first and third line of the first stanza\nbe repeated alternately in the last lines of the stanzas that follow it. In the\nfinal quatrain, the two repeated lines conclude the poem. Thus, we could\ndescribe Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 130 as being a different form than Dylan\nThomas\u2019s \u201cDo Not Go Gentle into That Good Night.\u201d\n42 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\nTheme is another term common to discussion of literature. Though\ntheme is similar to message or argument, it is not necessarily an assertion\nlike the other two terms are. In connecting to a work\u2019s meaning, a theme\ncan refer to key topics of a work. Thus, while we might say \u201cOde on a\nGrecian Urn\u201d argues that the state of desire should be appreciated beyond\nthe moment of satisfaction, we might state that the themes of the poem are\nbecoming versus being, the role of timeless art in a time-dependent world,\nand the relationship between beauty and truth.\nThe tone of a work is crucial to its meaning and effect. The tone of a\npoem, often generated by diction, rhythm, and rhyme, can be, for example,\nsad, angry, celebratory, ironic, respectful, and\/or yearning. Most effective\npoems exhibit tension. The tone can help to generate that tension. Tension\nitself can be generated in a variety of ways, but one common method is\nthe juxtaposition of two seemingly opposing forces against one another.\nIn \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d the two forces that seem to pull against each\nother are time and timelessness. To develop that tension, Keats employs\ncarefully crafted diction, or word choice. To generate an awareness of\ntime, he uses words like \u201chistorian,\u201d \u201clegend,\u201d and \u201cold age.\u201d This\nawareness, however, is challenged by words associated with the vase\u2019s\n\u201cfrozen\u201d timeless scene: \u201cfor ever new,\u201d \u201cfor ever young,\u201d and \u201ceternity.\u201d\nDiction can be used to generate tension and to set a poem\u2019s tone, as well\nas to establish significant themes in a work. Consider Hughes\u2019s use in\n\u201cThe Weary Blues\u201d of \u201cdrowsy,\u201d \u201cmellow,\u201d \u201cdull pallor,\u201d \u201clazy,\u201d and\n\u201cmelancholy.\u201d These words not only reflect the \u201cdrowsy\u201d sound of blues,\nbut they also suggest the melancholy mood of that music.\nIt is important, in understanding a poem\u2019s meaning, to consider its\npoint of view. Remember, we must not assume that the poem\u2019s speaker is\nthe poet. The speaker is constructed by the poet to provide point of view for\nthe poem. In \u201cThe Weary Blues,\u201d the speaker is actually on Lenox Avenue\nlistening to the blues singer and imagining, later, the singer\u2019s life when he\nleaves the club. We might ask ourselves why the speaker\u2019s thoughts follow\nthe blues singer home in this way. What does the speaker\u2019s point of view\ntell us about him or her? Why does Hughes describe the event from this\nperspective? In some poems, the point of view is not first person (in other\nwords, we don\u2019t hear of the main character as I). Instead, the persona (or\nmain character) is referred to in third person (he or she).\nIrony is an idea turned back upon itself; in an ironic passage,\nthe words mean something different than their literal definitions\nwould suggest. Consider Marianne Moore\u2019s \u201cPoetry\u201d located at\nhttp:\/\/www.poets.org\/poetsorg\/poem\/poetry.\n43 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nFollowing the title, the first line seems to state that the speaker does\nnot like poetry (\u201cit\u201d). In the next line, she even seems to cast aspersion on\npoetry by calling it \u201cfiddle.\u201d One irony, then, is that the speaker seems to\nbe insulting poetry in a\u2026well, in a poem. So, from this moment, the reader\nunderstands that Moore is presenting the reader with a puzzle. As the poem\ndevelops, however, it becomes clear that it is a certain kind of poem that\nthe speaker doesn\u2019t like\u2014a poem that spurs \u201chigh-sounding interpretation\u201d\n(9) but contains no \u201cuseful\u201d substance (12), nothing \u201cgenuine\u201d (40). After\nbuilding a gradual argument that \u201cit\u201d is actually not poetry at all, Moore\nbrings us logically to the concluding line, that if what we dislike is \u201cpoetry\u201d\nthat we can\u2019t understand\u2014\u201cpoetry\u201d that presents complicated emptiness, if\nwe demand the genuine\u2014it is likely that we \u201care interested in poetry\u201d after\nall (40). Moore\u2019s use of irony here yields a wonderful twist, driving home\nher point, and giving her own poem great impact.\nWhile we may think of setting as an element more relevant to fiction,\nit is often an important feature of poetry, as well. The setting of Lenox\nAvenue for \u201cThe Weary Blues,\u201d for example, provides historical context\nand authenticity to the blues song. Lenox Avenue is a famous street in\nHarlem in which African American culture (particularly jazz, blues, and\nsoul food) thrived during the Harlem Renaissance.\nFinally, let\u2019s examine a few literary elements associated more\nspecifically with poetry. Rhyme is produced when two words ending in\nthe same vowel sound are juxtaposed with one another. In \u201cThe Weary\nBlues,\u201d \u201ctune\u201d and \u201ccroon\u201d produce a rhyme, along with \u201cnight\u201d and\n\u201clight,\u201d \u201csway\u201d and \u201cplay,\u201d and \u201ckey\u201d and \u201cmelody.\u201d These rhymes give\nthe poem a lyrical, or musical, quality. Although the term lyric poem\nrefers to classical poetry following specific rhythms and rhyme schemes,\nthese poems were often accompanied by music, and \u201cThe Weary Blues\u201d\ndoes conjure the sounds of blues music. Hughes\u2019s purposeful use of blues\nrhythm in this poem is a departure from traditional European rhythms, the\nmost common of which are iambic pentameter and ballad meter. An iamb\nis a two syllable foot (we measure poetic rhythmic units in feet), with the\naccent on the second syllable. \u201cThou still unravish\u2019d bride of quietness,\u201d\nthe first line of \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn,\u201d is written in iambic pentameter.\n\u201cThou still\u201d reflects the two syllable foot with the accent on the second\nsyllable. In this line, there are five feet, a line-length which we describe as\npentameter (penta meaning five). Many poems have been composed in this\nmeter over the centuries, often with each pair of lines rhyming. Pairs like\nthis are called couplets. Consider the rhyme and rhythm of Shakespeare\u2019s\n\u201cMy Mistress\u2019 Eyes\u201d (Sonnet 130):\n44 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\nMy mistress\u2019 eyes are nothing like the sun;\nCoral is far more red than her lips\u2019 red;\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white, 5\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks;\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound; 10\nI grant I never saw a goddess go;\nMy mistress when she walks treads on the ground.\nAnd yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare\nAs any she belied with false compare.\n(1623)\nWith its conventional fourteen lines, this sonnet exhibits all the rules of the\nform we now call the Shakespearean sonnet. Each line is written in iambic\npentameter, and the rhyme scheme of the poem follows this pattern: ABAB\nCDCD EFEF GG. Concluding with a couplet, the Shakespearean sonnet\nresolves the conflict or problem in the final two lines, and the GG rhyme\nenhances this feeling of completion.\nThe ballad stanza (the poetic version of a paragraph) is a quatrain\n(a four-line stanza), and the rhythm alternates iambic tetrameter lines\n(featuring four iambs) with iambic trimeter lines (with three iambs each).\nWhile there is no rhyme with line one or line three of the stanza, line two\nrhymes with line four. The \u201csing-song\u201d quality produced by the ballad\u2019s\nrhythm and rhyme has generally been more popular among common folks\nthan has iambic pentameter, which is usually associated with \u201chigh art.\u201d\nThere are many examples of ballad meter, even in our culture today. Many\nChristian hymns follow this form, such as \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and \u201cIt Came\nUpon a Midnight Clear.\u201d In addition, the oeuvre of Emily Dickinson\u2019s\npoems is written in ballad form. See if you can trace the ballad rhythm and\nrhyme scheme in this one:\nI heard a Fly buzz - when I died -\nThe Stillness in the Room\nWas like the Stillness in the Air -\nBetween the Heaves of Storm -\n45 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nThe Eyes around - had wrung them dry - 5\nAnd Breaths were gathering firm\nFor that last Onset - when the King\nBe witnessed - in the Room -\nI willed my Keepsakes - Signed away\nWhat portion of me be 10\nAssignable - and then it was\nThere interposed a Fly -\nWith Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -\nBetween the light - and me -\nAnd then the Windows failed - and then....................................15\nI could not see to see -\n(1890)\nCan you see Dickinson\u2019s structure at work? Why would she use this \u201csing-\nsong\u201d form to explore the serious subject of death? Perhaps her focus on\nthe fly offers a clue.\nThere are many forms that restrict the poet to a particular rhythm and\nrhyme. One of strictest poetic forms is the traditional villanelle. It might\nnot be so difficult to write a poem that meets the formal requirements of the\nvillanelle, but to write one that makes sense and conveys an important idea\nis quite a challenge. Read Dylan Thomas\u2019s 1952 \u201cDo Not Go Gentle into\nThat Good Night,\u201d one of the most famous villanelles in English literature,\nat http:\/\/www.poets.org\/poetsorg\/poem\/do-not-go-gentle-good-night.\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. Why would Thomas choose such a restrictive form in which to\nexpress the son\u2019s urgent response to his father\u2019s impending death?\n2. What is the effect of the repeated lines?\n3. Besides the repeated lines, what other elements help to create the\nemotional tone?\nMany poems reject the strict forms that dictate rhyme and rhythm.\nBlank verse, itself relatively traditional, uses an iambic pentameter line\nbut without rhyme. Much of Shakespeare\u2019s drama is written in such\nverse. Slant rhyme also veers away from our expectations, presenting\nan \u201calmost rhyme\u201d that causes us to pause, either with words that look\n46 Experiencing the Power of Poetry\nlike they should rhyme but don\u2019t (like \u201cbe\u201d and \u201cFly\u201d in lines 10 and\n12 of Dickinson\u2019s poem above) or with words whose sounds are similar\nbut not exactly the same (such as \u201cRoom\u201d and \u201cStorm\u201d in lines 2 and\n4 of Dickinson\u2019s poem). Further, many contemporary poets take their\nfreedom a step further to produce free verse, which is not governed by\nany common rules. This is not to say that contemporary poetry does not\ngenerate the musical effect we expect of the genre\u2014it simply finds new\nways to do so. Consider Galway Kinnell\u2019s 1980 \u201cBlackberry Eating\u201d at\nhttps:\/\/www.poetrysociety.org\/psa\/poetry\/poetry_in_motion\/atlas\/\nchicago\/blackberry_eating\/.\nOf course, a central element of poetry is its use of figurative language,\nwhich, as opposed to literal language, suggests meaning beyond a word\u2019s\ndenotation. We expect poetry to compress language in ways that other genres\ndo not. In a fourteen-line sonnet, there is a limited amount of space (even a\nlimited number of syllables) in which to express an idea. Thus, poetry often\nemploys metaphors and similes which pack much meaning into only a word\nor phrase. A metaphor is a comparison of two generally unlike things in\norder to emphasize a particular quality that they do share. Marianne Moore\ncompares powerful poetry to \u201c[h]ands that can grasp\u201d (6), for instance,\nemphasizing its ability to move beyond the abstract and affect the reader\u2019s\nreal and concrete experience. Shakespeare\u2019s speaker, in describing his\nmistress, asserts that \u201cblack wires grow on her head\u201d (4). Hair and wire are\ntwo distinct materials, but in this comparison, he emphasizes the hair\u2019s lack\nof often-desired softness and suppleness, conveying his point about this\nwoman\u2019s failure to meet conventional standards of beauty. Kinnell\u2019s poem\ncompares words to blackberries in an extended or controlling metaphor,\nwhich carries the central metaphor all the way through the poem. A simile\nis a similar type of comparison, but uses the words like or as to link the\ntwo items. In \u201cI Heard a Fly Buzz - When I Died,\u201d Dickinson writes that\n\u201cThe Stillness in the Room \/ Was like the Stillness in the Air - \/ Between\nthe Heaves of Storm\u201d (2-4). What effect does this comparison generate?\nHow is the stillness of a dead body in an (almost) empty room like the still\npause between \u201cHeaves of a storm\u201d? If death is a still moment, what are the\n\u201cheaves\u201d on either side of it?\nStudents sometimes find it difficult to distinguish between a symbol\nand a metaphor. While a metaphor is a comparison between two unlike\nthings to emphasize their similarity, such as a blackberry and a word,\nblackberries don\u2019t usually refer to words. That\u2019s what makes Kinnell\u2019s\npoem so surprising. A symbol, on the other hand, is a link\u2014one\nthing\u2019s representation of another\u2014which many readers recognize. The\n47 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nrepresentational \u201cthing\u201d has become a symbol by long-term association\nwith what it represents. For example, the United States flag is a recognized\nsymbol of American patriotism. For many, the flag represents the freedoms\nguaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. Similarly, in Western culture, the red\nrose historically symbolizes love and beauty. Shakespeare\u2019s use of this\nsymbol in \u201cMy Mistress\u2019 Eyes\u201d effectively reminds us of traditional\nnotions of female beauty.\nTwo other poetic elements often used to great effect are alliteration\nand enjambment. Alliteration is the placement of same or similar sounds\nnear each other to draw our attention, sometimes to the sound, sometimes\nto meanings of the words being linked to each other by the sounds, and\nsometimes both. In \u201cBlackberry Eating,\u201d Kinnell conveys the message\nof the near physical quality of words through the \u201cs\u201d alliteration in the\nwords \u201cstrengths,\u201d \u201csquinched,\u201d \u201csyllabled,\u201d \u201csqueeze,\u201d \u201csquinch,\u201d and\n\u201csplurge,\u201d words that capture surprisingly well the experience of the\ntongue when we bite into a blackberry!\nEnjambment carries one poetic line into the following one, yielding\ntwo meanings\u2014one generated by the first line alone, and the other produced\nby taking the finished phrase or clause as it is completed in the next line.\nAs discussed previously, in the first stanza of Keats\u2019s \u201cOde on a Grecian\nUrn,\u201d he creates one impression with line 11 on its own: \u201cHeard melodies\nare sweet, but those unheard.\u201d But when we read on to finish the clause, we\nread instead, \u201cHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard \/ Are sweeter\u201d\n(11-12). Line 11 might create a sad tone, suggesting that we cannot hear\nthe urn-piper\u2019s melody, but taken together, lines 11 and 12 convey that the\nurn-piper\u2019s unheard song is even sweeter than a heard melody. Our momen-\ntary misconception boosts the effect of the real message.\nAs you read poems like those we have discussed in this chapter, as\nwell as those that follow, consider how the above elements function to\ngenerate effect and power. You may choose one of these to write about,\nand as you develop your perspective on the meaning and relevance of the\npoem, these terms will no doubt help express your point to your audience.\n4.4 Additional Poems\nDover Beach\nBy Matthew Arnold\nThe sea is calm tonight.\nThe tide is full, the moon lies fair\nUpon the straits;

Think of your\nfavorite short story or novel\u2014what does it reveal to you about yourself?\nHow does it illuminate the human condition? While stories can convey\na variety of \u201ctruths,\u201d which to some extent depend on each reader\u2019s\nidentity and experience, we still seek in these narratives connections with\ncharacters and other readers. Up through the first part of the twentieth\ncentury, scholars often referred to these connections as \u201cuniversal truths.\u201d\nThis term refers to experiences, feelings, and insights that are common\nto all people. Yet, events of the 1950s and 1960s raised questions about\nwhether any experience was truly universal. With the Civil Rights\nMovement came the understanding that people\u2019s experiences can vary\nwildly due to factors such as gender, class, ethnicity, and culture. Much to\nthe surprise of many scholars (the vast majority of whom were, at the time,\nwhite, middle class, and male), not everyone could completely identify\nwith Mark Twain\u2019s young protagonist Huckleberry Finn. For example,\nbecause of rigid social codes and physical risks unique to U.S. women, a\nyoung American female reader might not have the option of experiencing\na physical journey like Huck\u2019s. In fact, it might be difficult for her even to\nimagine taking such a trip down the Mississippi River, since there is little\nto no evidence in history of a woman ever having done so. Even Huck\u2019s\nfriend Jim, an escaped slave, is vulnerable in ways that Huck is not, as\nthe two travel together. Readers of color might identify less with Huck\u2019s\ncircumstances and more with Jim\u2019s. Even so, most readers can connect\n55 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nwith Huck\u2019s inner conflict as he struggles between his obligation to follow\nthe social rules taught to him as absolute morals and his own conscience,\nwhich tells him that Jim should not be subjected to slavery.\nAs you form your perspective on a story and then develop that\nperspective in an essay, your own readers will still seek an insight that\nis relevant to them. Thus, while we must be sensitive to the differences\namong individuals\u2019 experiences as we form an argument about a short story\nor novel, it is still important to forward a case based on common ground\nbetween our readers and ourselves. Consider the difference between these\ntwo assertions:\n1. To mature as a moral creature, Huck must separate himself from\nsociety for a time and explore the world beyond his own narrow-\nminded hamlet.\n2. Huck\u2019s journey away from his own narrow-minded hamlet and its\nteachings enables his moral maturation.\nNote the first assertion\u2019s implication that if one cannot leave one\u2019s hamlet\nand separate him or herself from his or her restrictive environment, one\ncannot mature morally. A reader who cannot take such a journey because\nof economic or social factors (such as having to stay at home and care for a\nchild or work to support a family) might respond to such a pronouncement\nby (a) feeling condemned to stunted personal growth and inferiority, as a\nperson excluded from this experience, or (b) becoming defensive at such a\nclaim. On the other hand, the second assertion will likely ring true both for\nthose who can take the journey and those who cannot. It does not suggest\nthat the only way of achieving moral growth is to take a physical journey\nlike Huck\u2019s. Thus, even considering the sometimes stark differences\namong readers\u2019 lives, if interpretation of literature is handled well, it can\nreveal our common experiences.\nAs a place where we can connect with one another as well as learn\nabout ourselves, fiction indeed offers us a special brand of truth. Although\nhistory and philosophy pursue these goals as well, fiction is a narrative\nthat is not bound to either historical events or scientific facts. The writer\ntakes liberties with a fictional story, using his imagination to craft a plot\nthat achieves the desired effect and meaning. The term narrative refers\nto the sequence of events in a story, often suggesting a cause and effect\nrelationship among these events. A term that captures this concept more\nspecifically, plot is defined as the sequence of events that develops the\nconflict and shapes the story. Rather than tell everything that might possibly\n56 The Truths of Fiction\nhappen to a character in certain circumstances, the writer carefully selects\nthe details that will develop the plot, the characters, and the story\u2019s themes\nand messages. The writer engages in character development in order to\ndevelop the plot and the meaning of the story, paying special attention to\nthe protagonist, or main character. In a conventional story, the protagonist\ngrows and\/or changes as a result of having to negotiate the story\u2019s central\nconflict. A character might be developed through exposition, in which the\nnarrator simply tells us about this person. But more often, the character\nis developed through dialogue, point of view, and description of this\nperson\u2019s expressions and actions.\nThe traditional shape of a story is based on common conventions of\nGreek drama:\nThe plot reaches a climax; the\nconflict is brought to a head.\nConflict is developed through\naction, dialogue, and\/or\nexposition.\nIntroduction of characters, Denouement: Loose ends are\nsetting, situation, and conflict. tied up, and often the conflict is\nresolved.\n5.2 Writing about Short Stories\nTo examine how plot, character development, dialogue, setting,\nexposition, and action can be brought together to produce a specific effect\nand particular themes, let\u2019s consider an exceptionally brief 1894 short\nstory by Kate Chopin.\nThe Story of an Hour\nKnowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart\ntrouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as\npossible the news of her husband\u2019s death.\nIt was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken\nsentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing.\n57 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nHer husband\u2019s friend Richards was there, too, near her.\nIt was he who had been in the newspaper office when\nintelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with\nBrently Mallard\u2019s name leading the list of \u201ckilled.\u201d He\nhad only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by\na second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less\ncareful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.\nShe did not hear the story as many women have\nheard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept\nits significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild\nabandonment, in her sister\u2019s arms. When the storm of\ngrief had spent itself she went away to her room alone.\nShe would have no one follow her.\nThere stood, facing the open window, a comfortable,\nroomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a\nphysical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to\nreach into her soul.\nShe could see in the open square before her house the\ntops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life.\nThe delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street\nbelow a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant\nsong which some one was singing reached her faintly, and\ncountless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.\nThere were patches of blue sky showing here and\nthere through the clouds that had met and piled one above\nthe other in the west facing her window.\nShe sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion\nof the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came\nup into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried\nitself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.\nShe was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines\nbespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now\nthere was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed\naway off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky.\nIt was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a\nsuspension of intelligent thought.\nThere was something coming to her and she was\nwaiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it\nwas too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping\nout of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the\nscents, the color that filled the air.\n58 The Truths of Fiction\nNow her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was\nbeginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to\npossess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her\nwill\u2014as powerless as her two white slender hands would\nhave been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered\nword escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and\nover under her breath: \u201cfree, free, free!\u201d The vacant stare and\nthe look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes.\nThey stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the\ncoursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.\nShe did not stop to ask if it were or were not a\nmonstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception\nenabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew\nthat she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender\nhands folded in death; the face that had never looked save\nwith love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw\nbeyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to\ncome that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened\nand spread her arms out to them in welcome.\nThere would be no one to live for during those\ncoming years; she would live for herself. There would be\nno powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence\nwith which men and women believe they have a right\nto impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind\nintention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less\na crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of\nillumination.\nAnd yet she had loved him\u2014sometimes. Often she\nhad not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved\nmystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-\nassertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest\nimpulse of her being!\n\u201cFree! Body and soul free!\u201d she kept whispering.\nJosephine was kneeling before the closed door with\nher lips to the keyhold, imploring for admission. \u201cLouise,\nopen the door! I beg; open the door\u2014you will make\nyourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven\u2019s\nsake open the door.\u201d\n\u201cGo away. I am not making myself ill.\u201d No; she was\ndrinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.\n59 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nHer fancy was running riot along those days ahead of\nher. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days\nthat would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that\nlife might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought\nwith a shudder that life might be long.\nShe arose at length and opened the door to her sister\u2019s\nimportunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and\nshe carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory.\nShe clasped her sister\u2019s waist, and together they descended\nthe stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.\nSome one was opening the front door with a latchkey.\nIt was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-\nstained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella.\nHe had been far from the scene of the accident, and did\nnot even know there had been one. He stood amazed at\nJosephine\u2019s piercing cry; at Richards\u2019 quick motion to\nscreen him from the view of his wife.\nWhen the doctors came they said she had died of\nheart disease\u2014of the joy that kills.\n(1894)\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. How is Mrs. Mallard\u2019s character developed? Do you see examples of\nexposition, where the narrator simply tells us information about the\nprotagonist? In addition, does Chopin portray particular emotional\nresponses, thoughts, and actions to reveal Mrs. Mallard\u2019s character?\nIf so, how so? How does she employ point of view in this story?\n2. What is your impression of Brently Mallard? What elements of\nthe story generate this impression?\n3. How is setting (both the historical period and the physical\natmosphere of the story) used to contribute to the story\u2019s meaning?\n4. What is Mrs. Mallard\u2019s social class? What clues lead you to\nthis conclusion?\n5. What is the story\u2019s central conflict? Does Mrs. Mallard change, as\nwe might expect a protagonist to do?\n6. What are the important themes of this story?\n60 The Truths of Fiction\nAs in poetry, fiction often utilizes diction and figurative language\nto convey important ideas. In this story, the words \u201caquiver,\u201d \u201cspring,\u201d\n\u201cdelicious breath,\u201d and \u201ctwittering\u201d suggest a kind of rebirth occurring for\nMrs. Mallard. In further development of this notion, how does Chopin use\nthe \u201cpatches of blue sky showing through the clouds\u201d as a metaphor of\nMrs. Mallard\u2019s potential transformation?\nOf course, even in this brief work, Chopin reveals the story to be a\ncomplicated one. Why does Mrs. Mallard try to \u201cbeat\u2026back with her\nwill\u201d this \u201cthing\u201d that is overtaking her? What is it? The plot of this story\nprovides an unexpected twist at the conclusion. What is the effect of this\nsurprise ending? Is there a denouement\u2014in other words, are the \u201cloose\nends tied up\u201d? Is the conflict resolved?\nConsider the two following short stories to determine key elements\nthat generate each work\u2019s impact and how they do so.\nThe Open Boat\nBy Stephen Crane\nA Tale intended to be after the fact.\nBeing the experience of four men sunk from the\nsteamer Commodore.\nI\nNone of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes\nglanced level, and were fastened upon the waves that\nswept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate,\nsave for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of\nthe men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed\nand widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its\nedge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in\npoints like rocks.\nMany a man ought to have a bath-tub larger than the\nboat which here rode upon the sea. These waves were\nmost wrongfully and barbarously abrupt and tall, and each\nfroth-top was a problem in small boat navigation.\nThe cook squatted in the bottom and looked with\nboth eyes at the six inches of gunwale which separated\nhim from the ocean. His sleeves were rolled over his fat\nforearms, and the two flaps of his unbuttoned vest dangled\nas he bent to bail out the boat. Often he said: \u201cGawd! That\n61 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nwas a narrow clip.\u201d As he remarked it he invariably gazed\neastward over the broken sea.\nThe oiler, steering with one of the two oars in the\nboat, sometimes raised himself suddenly to keep clear of\nwater that swirled in over the stern. It was a thin little oar\nand it seemed often ready to snap.\nThe correspondent, pulling at the other oar, watched\nthe waves and wondered why he was there.\nThe injured captain, lying in the bow, was at this time\nburied in that profound dejection and indifference which\ncomes, temporarily at least, to even the bravest and most\nenduring when, willy nilly, the firm fails, the army loses,\nthe ship goes down. The mind of the master of a vessel is\nrooted deep in the timbers of her, though he command for\na day or a decade, and this captain had on him the stern\nimpression of a scene in the grays of dawn of seven turned\nfaces, and later a stump of a top-mast with a white ball on\nit that slashed to and fro at the waves, went low and lower,\nand down. Thereafter there was something strange in his\nvoice. Although steady, it was deep with mourning, and of\na quality beyond oration or tears.\n\u201cKeep\u2019er a little more south, Billie,\u201d said he.\n\u201c\u2019A little more south,\u2019 sir,\u201d said the oiler in the stern.\nA seat in this boat was not unlike a seat upon a\nbucking broncho, and, by the same token, a broncho is not\nmuch smaller. The craft pranced and reared, and plunged\nlike an animal. As each wave came, and she rose for it,\nshe seemed like a horse making at a fence outrageously\nhigh. The manner of her scramble over these walls of\nwater is a mystic thing, and, moreover, at the top of them\nwere ordinarily these problems in white water, the foam\nracing down from the summit of each wave, requiring a\nnew leap, and a leap from the air. Then, after scornfully\nbumping a crest, she would slide, and race, and splash\ndown a long incline and arrive bobbing and nodding in\nfront of the next menace.\nA singular disadvantage of the sea lies in the fact that\nafter successfully surmounting one wave you discover\nthat there is another behind it just as important and just as\nnervously anxious to do something effective in the way of\n62 The Truths of Fiction\nswamping boats. In a ten-foot dingey one can get an idea\nof the resources of the sea in the line of waves that is not\nprobable to the average experience, which is never at sea\nin a dingey. As each slaty wall of water approached, it shut\nall else from the view of the men in the boat, and it was\nnot difficult to imagine that this particular wave was the\nfinal outburst of the ocean, the last effort of the grim water.\nThere was a terrible grace in the move of the waves, and\nthey came in silence, save for the snarling of the crests.\nIn the wan light, the faces of the men must have been\ngray. Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they\ngazed steadily astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole\nthing would doubtlessly have been weirdly picturesque.\nBut the men in the boat had no time to see it, and if they\nhad had leisure there were other things to occupy their\nminds. The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they knew\nit was broad day because the color of the sea changed from\nslate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the\nfoam was like tumbling snow. The process of the breaking\nday was unknown to them. They were aware only of this\neffect upon the color of the waves that rolled toward them.\nIn disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent\nargued as to the difference between a life-saving station and\na house of refuge. The cook had said: \u201cThere\u2019s a house of\nrefuge just north of the Mosquito Inlet Light, and as soon as\nthey see us, they\u2019ll come off in their boat and pick us up.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as who see us?\u201d said the correspondent.\n\u201cThe crew,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cHouses of refuge don\u2019t have crews,\u201d said the\ncorrespondent. \u201cAs I understand them, they are only\nplaces where clothes and grub are stored for the benefit of\nshipwrecked people. They don\u2019t carry crews.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, they do,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d said the correspondent.\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re not there yet, anyhow,\u201d said the oiler, in\nthe stern.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the cook, \u201cperhaps it\u2019s not a house of\nrefuge that I\u2019m thinking of as being near Mosquito Inlet\nLight. Perhaps it\u2019s a life-saving station.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d said the oiler, in the stern.\n63 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nII\nAs the boat bounced from the top of each wave, the\nwind tore through the hair of the hatless men, and as the craft\nplopped her stern down again the spray slashed past them.\nThe crest of each of these waves was a hill, from the top of\nwhich the men surveyed, for a moment, a broad tumultuous\nexpanse; shining and wind-riven. It was probably splendid.\nIt was probably glorious, this play of the free sea, wild with\nlights of emerald and white and amber.\n\u201cBully good thing it\u2019s an on-shore wind,\u201d said the\ncook. \u201cIf not, where would we be? Wouldn\u2019t have a show.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the correspondent.\nThe busy oiler nodded his assent.\nThen the captain, in the bow, chuckled in a way that\nexpressed humor, contempt, tragedy, all in one. \u201cDo you\nthink we\u2019ve got much of a show, now, boys?\u201d said he.\nWhereupon the three were silent, save for a trifle of\nhemming and hawing. To express any particular optimism\nat this time they felt to be childish and stupid, but they all\ndoubtless possessed this sense of the situation in their mind.\nA young man thinks doggedly at such times. On the other\nhand, the ethics of their condition was decidedly against\nany open suggestion of hopelessness. So they were silent.\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d said the captain, soothing his children,\n\u201cwe\u2019ll get ashore all right.\u201d\nBut there was that in his tone which made them think,\nso the oiler quoth: \u201cYes! If this wind holds!\u201d\nThe cook was bailing: \u201cYes! If we don\u2019t catch hell in\nthe surf.\u201d\nCanton flannel gulls flew near and far. Sometimes\nthey sat down on the sea, near patches of brown sea-weed\nthat rolled over the waves with a movement like carpets\non line in a gale. The birds sat comfortably in groups, and\nthey were envied by some in the dingey, for the wrath\nof the sea was no more to them than it was to a covey\nof prairie chickens a thousand miles inland. Often they\ncame very close and stared at the men with black bead-\nlike eyes. At these times they were uncanny and sinister\nin their unblinking scrutiny, and the men hooted angrily\nat them, telling them to be gone. One came, and evidently\n64 The Truths of Fiction\ndecided to alight on the top of the captain\u2019s head. The bird\nflew parallel to the boat and did not circle, but made short\nsidelong jumps in the air in chicken-fashion. His black\neyes were wistfully fixed upon the captain\u2019s head. \u201cUgly\nbrute,\u201d said the oiler to the bird. \u201cYou look as if you were\nmade with a jack-knife.\u201d The cook and the correspondent\nswore darkly at the creature. The captain naturally wished\nto knock it away with the end of the heavy painter, but he\ndid not dare do it, because anything resembling an emphatic\ngesture would have capsized this freighted boat, and so with\nhis open hand, the captain gently and carefully waved the\ngull away. After it had been discouraged from the pursuit\nthe captain breathed easier on account of his hair, and others\nbreathed easier because the bird struck their minds at this\ntime as being somehow grewsome and ominous.\nIn the meantime the oiler and the correspondent\nrowed. And also they rowed.\nThey sat together in the same seat, and each rowed an\noar. Then the oiler took both oars; then the correspondent\ntook both oars; then the oiler; then the correspondent.\nThey rowed and they rowed. The very ticklish part of the\nbusiness was when the time came for the reclining one in\nthe stern to take his turn at the oars. By the very last star of\ntruth, it is easier to steal eggs from under a hen than it was\nto change seats in the dingey. First the man in the stern\nslid his hand along the thwart and moved with care, as if\nhe were of Sevres. Then the man in the rowing seat slid\nhis hand along the other thwart. It was all done with the\nmost extraordinary care. As the two sidled past each other,\nthe whole party kept watchful eyes on the coming wave,\nand the captain cried: \u201cLook out now! Steady there!\u201d\nThe brown mats of sea-weed that appeared from time\nto time were like islands, bits of earth. They were travelling,\napparently, neither one way nor the other. They were, to all\nintents stationary. They informed the men in the boat that it\nwas making progress slowly toward the land.\nThe captain, rearing cautiously in the bow, after the\ndingey soared on a great swell, said that he had seen the\nlighthouse at Mosquito Inlet. Presently the cook remarked\nthat he had seen it. The correspondent was at the oars,\n65 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nthen, and for some reason he too wished to look at the\nlighthouse, but his back was toward the far shore and the\nwaves were important, and for some time he could not\nseize an opportunity to turn his head. But at last there\ncame a wave more gentle than the others, and when at the\ncrest of it he swiftly scoured the western horizon.\n\u201cSee it?\u201d said the captain.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the correspondent, slowly, \u201cI didn\u2019t see\nanything.\u201d\n\u201cLook again,\u201d said the captain. He pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s\nexactly in that direction.\u201d\nAt the top of another wave, the correspondent did as\nhe was bid, and this time his eyes chanced on a small still\nthing on the edge of the swaying horizon. It was precisely\nlike the point of a pin. It took an anxious eye to find a\nlighthouse so tiny.\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll make it, captain?\u201d\n\u201cIf this wind holds and the boat don\u2019t swamp, we\ncan\u2019t do much else,\u201d said the captain.\nThe little boat, lifted by each towering sea, and\nsplashed viciously by the crests, made progress that in the\nabsence of sea-weed was not apparent to those in her. She\nseemed just a wee thing wallowing, miraculously, top-up,\nat the mercy of five oceans. Occasionally, a great spread\nof water, like white flames, swarmed into her.\n\u201cBail her, cook,\u201d said the captain, serenely.\n\u201cAll right, captain,\u201d said the cheerful cook.\nIII\nIt would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood\nof men that was here established on the seas. No one said\nthat it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the\nboat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain,\nan oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were\nfriends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree\nthan may be common. The hurt captain, lying against the\nwater-jar in the bow, spoke always in a low voice and\ncalmly, but he could never command a more ready and\nswiftly obedient crew than the motley three of the dingey.\nIt was more than a mere recognition of what was best for\n66 The Truths of Fiction\nthe common safety. There was surely in it a quality that\nwas personal and heartfelt. And after this devotion to the\ncommander of the boat there was this comradeship that\nthe correspondent, for instance, who had been taught to\nbe cynical of men, knew even at the time was the best\nexperience of his life. But no one said that it was so. No\none mentioned it.\n\u201cI wish we had a sail,\u201d remarked the captain. \u201cWe might\ntry my overcoat on the end of an oar and give you two boys a\nchance to rest.\u201d So the cook and the correspondent held the\nmast and spread wide the overcoat. The oiler steered, and\nthe little boat made good way with her new rig. Sometimes\nthe oiler had to scull sharply to keep a sea from breaking\ninto the boat, but otherwise sailing was a success.\nMeanwhile the light-house had been growing slowly\nlarger. It had now almost assumed color, and appeared\nlike a little gray shadow on the sky. The man at the oars\ncould not be prevented from turning his head rather often\nto try for a glimpse of this little gray shadow.\nAt last, from the top of each wave the men in the\ntossing boat could see land. Even as the light-house was\nan upright shadow on the sky, this land seemed but a long\nblack shadow on the sea. It certainly was thinner than\npaper. \u201cWe must be about opposite New Smyrna,\u201d said\nthe cook, who had coasted this shore often in schooners.\n\u201cCaptain, by the way, I believe they abandoned that life-\nsaving station there about a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cDid they?\u201d said the captain.\nThe wind slowly died away. The cook and the\ncorrespondent were not now obliged to slave in order\nto hold high the oar. But the waves continued their old\nimpetuous swooping at the dingey, and the little craft, no\nlonger under way, struggled woundily over them. The\noiler or the correspondent took the oars again.\nShipwrecks are apropos of nothing. If men could only\ntrain for them and have them occur when the men had\nreached pink condition, there would be less drowning at\nsea. Of the four in the dingey none had slept any time\nworth mentioning for two days and two nights previous\nto embarking in the dingey, and in the excitement of\n67 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nclambering about the deck of a foundering ship they had\nalso forgotten to eat heartily.\nFor these reasons, and for others, neither the oiler nor\nthe correspondent was fond of rowing at this time. The\ncorrespondent wondered ingenuously how in the name of all\nthat was sane could there be people who thought it amusing\nto row a boat. It was not an amusement; it was a diabolical\npunishment, and even a genius of mental aberrations could\nnever conclude that it was anything but a horror to the muscles\nand a crime against the back. He mentioned to the boat in\ngeneral how the amusement of rowing struck him, and the\nweary-faced oiler smiled in full sympathy. Previously to the\nfoundering, by the way, the oiler had worked double-watch\nin the engine-room of the ship.\n\u201cTake her easy, now, boys,\u201d said the captain. \u201cDon\u2019t\nspend yourselves. If we have to run a surf you\u2019ll need all\nyour strength, because we\u2019ll sure have to swim for it. Take\nyour time.\u201d\nSlowly the land arose from the sea. From a black line it\nbecame a line of black and a line of white, trees, and sand.\nFinally, the captain said that he could make out a house on\nthe shore. \u201cThat\u2019s the house of refuge, sure,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll see us before long, and come out after us.\u201d\nThe distant light-house reared high. \u201cThe keeper\nought to be able to make us out now, if he\u2019s looking\nthrough a glass,\u201d said the captain. \u201cHe\u2019ll notify the life-\nsaving people.\u201d\n\u201cNone of those other boats could have got ashore to\ngive word of the wreck,\u201d said the oiler, in a low voice.\n\u201cElse the life-boat would be out hunting us.\u201d\nSlowly and beautifully the land loomed out of the sea.\nThe wind came again. It had veered from the northeast to\nthe southeast. Finally, a new sound struck the ears of the\nmen in the boat. It was the low thunder of the surf on the\nshore. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make the light-house now,\u201d\nsaid the captain. \u201cSwing her head a little more north,\nBillie,\u201d said the captain.\n\u201c\u2018A little more north,\u2019 sir,\u201d said the oiler.\nWhereupon the little boat turned her nose once more\ndown the wind, and all but the oarsman watched the shore\n68 The Truths of Fiction\ngrow. Under the influence of this expansion doubt and\ndireful apprehension was leaving the minds of the men.\nThe management of the boat was still most absorbing,\nbut it could not prevent a quiet cheerfulness. In an hour,\nperhaps, they would be ashore.\nTheir back-bones had become thoroughly used to\nbalancing in the boat and they now rode this wild colt of a\ndingey like circus men. The correspondent thought that he\nhad been drenched to the skin, but happening to feel in the\ntop pocket of his coat, he found therein eight cigars. Four\nof them were soaked with sea-water; four were perfectly\nscatheless. After a search, somebody produced three\ndry matches, and thereupon the four waifs rode in their\nlittle boat, and with an assurance of an impending rescue\nshining in their eyes, puffed at the big cigars and judged\nwell and ill of all men. Everybody took a drink of water.\nIV\n\u201cCook,\u201d remarked the captain, \u201cthere don\u2019t seem to\nbe any signs of life about your house of refuge.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the cook. \u201cFunny they don\u2019t see us!\u201d\nA broad stretch of lowly coast lay before the eyes of\nthe men. It was of low dunes topped with dark vegetation.\nThe roar of the surf was plain, and sometimes they could\nsee the white lip of a wave as it spun up the beach. A tiny\nhouse was blocked out black upon the sky. Southward, the\nslim light-house lifted its little gray length.\nTide, wind, and waves were swinging the dingey\nnorthward. \u201cFunny they don\u2019t see us,\u201d said the men.\nThe surf\u2019s roar was here dulled, but its tone was,\nnevertheless, thunderous and mighty. As the boat swam\nover the great rollers, the men sat listening to this roar.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll swamp sure,\u201d said everybody.\nIt is fair to say here that there was not a life-saving\nstation within twenty miles in either direction, but the\nmen did not know this fact and in consequence they made\ndark and opprobrious remarks concerning the eyesight\nof the nation\u2019s life-savers. Four scowling men sat in the\ndingey and surpassed records in the invention of epithets.\n\u201cFunny they don\u2019t see us.\u201d\n69 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nThe light-heartedness of a former time had completely\nfaded. To their sharpened minds it was easy to conjure\npictures of all kinds of incompetency and blindness and\nindeed, cowardice. There was the shore of the populous\nland, and it was bitter and bitter to them that from it came\nno sign.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the captain, ultimately, \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll\nhave to make a try for ourselves. If we stay out here too long,\nwe\u2019ll none of us have strength left to swim after the boat\nswamps.\u201d\nAnd so the oiler, who was at the oars, turned the boat\nstraight for the shore. There was a sudden tightening of\nmuscles. There was some thinking.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t all get ashore\u2014\u201d said the captain. \u201cIf we\ndon\u2019t all get ashore, I suppose you fellows know where to\nsend news of my finish?\u201d\nThey then briefly exchanged some addresses and\nadmonitions. As for the reflections of the men, there\nwas a great deal of rage in them. Perchance they might\nbe formulated thus: \u201cIf I am going to be drowned\u2014if I\nam going to be drowned\u2014if I am going to be drowned,\nwhy, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the\nsea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand\nand trees? Was I brought here merely to have my nose\ndragged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese\nof life? It is preposterous. If this old ninny-woman, Fate,\ncannot do better than this, she should be deprived of the\nmanagement of men\u2019s fortunes. She is an old hen who\nknows not her intention. If she has decided to drown me,\nwhy did she not do it in the beginning and save me all this\ntrouble. The whole affair is absurd...But, no, she cannot\nmean to drown me. She dare not drown me. She cannot\ndrown me. Not after all this work.\u201d Afterward the man\nmight have had an impulse to shake his fist at the clouds:\n\u201cJust you drown me, now, and then hear what I call you!\u201d\nThe billows that came at this time were more\nformidable. They seemed always just about to break and\nroll over the little boat in a turmoil of foam. There was\na preparatory and long growl in the speech of them. No\nmind unused to the sea would have concluded that the\n70 The Truths of Fiction\ndingey could ascend these sheer heights in time. The shore\nwas still afar. The oiler was a wily surfman. \u201cBoys,\u201d he\nsaid, swiftly, \u201cshe won\u2019t live three minutes more and we\u2019re\ntoo far out to swim. Shall I take her to sea again, captain?\u201d\n\u201cYes! Go ahead!\u201d said the captain.\nThis oiler, by a series of quick miracles, and fast and\nsteady oarsmanship, turned the boat in the middle of the\nsurf and took her safely to sea again.\nThere was a considerable silence as the boat bumped\nover the furrowed sea to deeper water. Then somebody\nin gloom spoke. \u201cWell, anyhow, they must have seen us\nfrom the shore by now.\u201d\nThe gulls went in slanting flight up the wind toward\nthe gray desolate east. A squall, marked by dingy clouds,\nand clouds brick-red, like smoke from a burning building,\nappeared from the southeast.\n\u201cWhat do you think of those life-saving people? Ain\u2019t\nthey peaches?\u201d\n\u201cFunny they haven\u2019t seen us.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they think we\u2019re out here for sport! Maybe they\nthink we\u2019re fishin\u2019. Maybe they think we\u2019re damned fools.\u201d\nIt was a long afternoon. A changed tide tried to force\nthem southward, but wind and wave said northward. Far\nahead, where coast-line, sea, and sky formed their mighty\nangle, there were little dots which seemed to indicate a\ncity on the shore.\n\u201cSt. Augustine?\u201d\nThe captain shook his head. \u201cToo near Mosquito Inlet.\u201d\nAnd the oiler rowed, and then the correspondent\nrowed. Then the oiler rowed. It was a weary business. The\nhuman back can become the seat of more aches and pains\nthan are registered in books for the composite anatomy\nof a regiment. It is a limited area, but it can become\nthe theatre of innumerable muscular conflicts, tangles,\nwrenches, knots, and other comforts.\n\u201cDid you ever like to row, Billie?\u201d asked the\ncorrespondent.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the oiler. \u201cHang it.\u201d\nWhen one exchanged the rowing-seat for a place in\nthe bottom of the boat, he suffered a bodily depression that\n71 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\ncaused him to be careless of everything save an obligation\nto wiggle one finger. There was cold sea-water swashing\nto and fro in the boat, and he lay in it. His head, pillowed\non a thwart, was within an inch of the swirl of a wave\ncrest, and sometimes a particularly obstreperous sea came\nin-board and drenched him once more. But these matters\ndid not annoy him. It is almost certain that if the boat had\ncapsized he would have tumbled comfortably out upon the\nocean as if he felt sure it was a great soft mattress.\n\u201cLook! There\u2019s a man on the shore!\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cThere! See \u2018im? See \u2018im?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sure! He\u2019s walking along.\u201d\n\u201cNow he\u2019s stopped. Look! He\u2019s facing us!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s waving at us!\u201d\n\u201cSo he is! By thunder!\u201d\n\u201cAh, now, we\u2019re all right! Now we\u2019re all right!\nThere\u2019ll be a boat out here for us in half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going on. He\u2019s running. He\u2019s going up to that\nhouse there.\u201d\nThe remote beach seemed lower than the sea, and it\nrequired a searching glance to discern the little black figure.\nThe captain saw a floating stick and they rowed to it. A bath-\ntowel was by some weird chance in the boat, and, tying this\non the stick, the captain waved it. The oarsman did not dare\nturn his head, so he was obliged to ask questions.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing now?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s standing still again. He\u2019s looking, I think...There\nhe goes again. Toward the house...Now he\u2019s stopped again.\u201d\n\u201cIs he waving at us?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not now! he was, though.\u201d\n\u201cLook! There comes another man!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s running.\u201d\n\u201cLook at him go, would you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, he\u2019s on a bicycle. Now he\u2019s met the other man.\nThey\u2019re both waving at us. Look!\u201d\n\u201cThere comes something up the beach.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the devil is that thing?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, it looks like a boat.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, certainly it\u2019s a boat.\u201d\n72 The Truths of Fiction\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s on wheels.\u201d\n\u201cYes, so it is. Well, that must be the life-boat. They\ndrag them along shore on a wagon.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the life-boat, sure.\u201d\n\u201cNo, by\u2014\u2014, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s an omnibus.\u201d\n\u201cI tell you it\u2019s a life-boat.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not! It\u2019s an omnibus. I can see it plain. See? One\nof these big hotel omnibuses.\u201d\n\u201cBy thunder, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s an omnibus, sure as fate.\nWhat do you suppose they are doing with an omnibus?\nMaybe they are going around collecting the life-crew, hey?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, likely. Look! There\u2019s a fellow waving a\nlittle black flag. He\u2019s standing on the steps of the omnibus.\nThere come those other two fellows. Now they\u2019re all\ntalking together. Look at the fellow with the flag. Maybe\nhe ain\u2019t waving it.\u201d\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t a flag, is it? That\u2019s his coat. Why, certainly,\nthat\u2019s his coat.\u201d\n\u201cSo it is. It\u2019s his coat. He\u2019s taken it off and is waving\nit around his head. But would you look at him swing it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, say, there isn\u2019t any life-saving station there.\nThat\u2019s just a winter resort hotel omnibus that has brought\nover some of the boarders to see us drown.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that idiot with the coat mean? What\u2019s he\nsignaling, anyhow?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks as if he were trying to tell us to go north.\nThere must be a life-saving station up there.\u201d\n\u201cNo! He thinks we\u2019re fishing. Just giving us a merry\nhand. See? Ah, there, Willie.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wish I could make something out of those\nsignals. What do you suppose he means?\u201d\n\u201cHe don\u2019t mean anything. He\u2019s just playing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if he\u2019d just signal us to try the surf again, or\nto go to sea and wait, or go north, or go south, or go to\nhell\u2014there would be some reason in it. But look at him.\nHe just stands there and keeps his coat revolving like a\nwheel. The ass!\u201d\n\u201cThere come more people.\u201d\n\u201cNow there\u2019s quite a mob. Look! Isn\u2019t that a boat?\u201d\n\u201cWhere? Oh, I see where you mean. No, that\u2019s no boat.\u201d\n73 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n\u201cThat fellow is still waving his coat.\u201d\n\u201cHe must think we like to see him do that. Why don\u2019t\nhe quit it. It don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he is trying to make us go north. It\nmust be that there\u2019s a life-saving station there somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cSay, he ain\u2019t tired yet. Look at \u2018im wave.\u201d\n\u201cWonder how long he can keep that up. He\u2019s been\nrevolving his coat ever since he caught sight of us. He\u2019s\nan idiot. Why aren\u2019t they getting men to bring a boat out.\nA fishing boat\u2014one of those big yawls\u2014could come out\nhere all right. Why don\u2019t he do something?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right, now.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have a boat out here for us in less than no\ntime, now that they\u2019ve seen us.\u201d\nA faint yellow tone came into the sky over the low\nland. The shadows on the sea slowly deepened. The wind\nbore coldness with it, and the men began to shiver.\n\u201cHoly smoke!\u201d said one, allowing his voice to express\nhis impious mood, \u201cif we keep on monkeying out here! If\nwe\u2019ve got to flounder out here all night!\u201d\n\u201cOh, we\u2019ll never have to stay here all night! Don\u2019t\nyou worry. They\u2019ve seen us now, and it won\u2019t be long\nbefore they\u2019ll come chasing out after us.\u201d\nThe shore grew dusky. The man waving a coat\nblended gradually into this gloom, and it swallowed in the\nsame manner the omnibus and the group of people. The\nspray, when it dashed uproariously over the side, made\nthe voyagers shrink and swear like men who were being\nbranded.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to catch the chump who waved the coat. I\nfeel like soaking him one, just for luck.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What did he do?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing, but then he seemed so damned cheerful.\u201d\nIn the meantime the oiler rowed, and then the\ncorrespondent rowed, and then the oiler rowed. Gray-\nfaced and bowed forward, they mechanically, turn by turn,\nplied the leaden oars. The form of the light-house had\nvanished from the southern horizon, but finally a pale star\nappeared, just lifting from the sea. The streaked saffron in\nthe west passed before the all-merging darkness, and the\n74 The Truths of Fiction\nsea to the east was black. The land had vanished, and was\nexpressed only by the low and drear thunder of the surf.\n\u201cIf I am going to be drowned\u2014if I am going to be\ndrowned\u2014if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name\nof the seven mad gods, who rule the sea, was I allowed\nto come thus far and contemplate sand and trees? Was I\nbrought here merely to have my nose dragged away as I\nwas about to nibble the sacred cheese of life?\u201d\nThe patient captain, drooped over the water-jar, was\nsometimes obliged to speak to the oarsman.\n\u201cKeep her head up! Keep her head up!\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Keep her head up,\u2019 sir.\u201d The voices were weary\nand low.\nThis was surely a quiet evening. All save the oarsman\nlay heavily and listlessly in the boat\u2019s bottom. As for him,\nhis eyes were just capable of noting the tall black waves\nthat swept forward in a most sinister silence, save for an\noccasional subdued growl of a crest.\nThe cook\u2019s head was on a thwart, and he looked\nwithout interest at the water under his nose. He was deep\nin other scenes. Finally he spoke. \u201cBillie,\u201d he murmured,\ndreamfully, \u201cwhat kind of pie do you like best?\u201d\nV\n\u201cPie,\u201d said the oiler and the correspondent, agitatedly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about those things, blast you!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the cook, \u201cI was just thinking about ham\nsandwiches, and\u2014\u201d\nA night on the sea in an open boat is a long night. As\ndarkness settled finally, the shine of the light, lifting from\nthe sea in the south, changed to full gold. On the northern\nhorizon a new light appeared, a small bluish gleam on the\nedge of the waters. These two lights were the furniture of\nthe world. Otherwise there was nothing but waves.\nTwo men huddled in the stern, and distances were\nso magnificent in the dingey that the rower was enabled\nto keep his feet partly warmed by thrusting them under\nhis companions. Their legs indeed extended far under\nthe rowing-seat until they touched the feet of the captain\nforward. Sometimes, despite the efforts of the tired\n75 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\noarsman, a wave came piling into the boat, an icy wave\nof the night, and the chilling water soaked them anew.\nThey would twist their bodies for a moment and groan,\nand sleep the dead sleep once more, while the water in the\nboat gurgled about them as the craft rocked.\nThe plan of the oiler and the correspondent was for\none to row until he lost the ability, and then arouse the\nother from his sea-water couch in the bottom of the boat.\nThe oiler plied the oars until his head drooped\nforward, and the overpowering sleep blinded him. And\nhe rowed yet afterward. Then he touched a man in the\nbottom of the boat, and called his name. \u201cWill you spell\nme for a little while?\u201d he said, meekly.\n\u201cSure, Billie,\u201d said the correspondent, awakening and\ndragging himself to a sitting position. They exchanged\nplaces carefully, and the oiler, cuddling down to the sea-\nwater at the cook\u2019s side, seemed to go to sleep instantly.\nThe particular violence of the sea had ceased. The\nwaves came without snarling. The obligation of the man\nat the oars was to keep the boat headed so that the tilt of\nthe rollers would not capsize her, and to preserve her from\nfilling when the crests rushed past. The black waves were\nsilent and hard to be seen in the darkness. Often one was\nalmost upon the boat before the oarsman was aware.\nIn a low voice the correspondent addressed the captain.\nHe was not sure that the captain was awake, although this\niron man seemed to be always awake. \u201cCaptain, shall I\nkeep her making for that light north, sir?\u201d\nThe same steady voice answered him. \u201cYes. Keep it\nabout two points off the port bow.\u201d\nThe cook had tied a life-belt around himself in order to\nget even the warmth which this clumsy cork contrivance\ncould donate, and he seemed almost stove-like when a\nrower, whose teeth invariably chattered wildly as soon as\nhe ceased his labor, dropped down to sleep.\nThe correspondent, as he rowed, looked down at the\ntwo men sleeping under foot. The cook\u2019s arm was around\nthe oiler\u2019s shoulders, and, with their fragmentary clothing\nand haggard faces, they were the babes of the sea, a\ngrotesque rendering of the old babes in the wood.\n76 The Truths of Fiction\nLater he must have grown stupid at his work, for\nsuddenly there was a growling of water, and a crest came\nwith a roar and a swash into the boat, and it was a wonder\nthat it did not set the cook afloat in his life-belt. The cook\ncontinued to sleep, but the oiler sat up, blinking his eyes\nand shaking with the new cold.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m awful sorry, Billie,\u201d said the correspondent,\ncontritely.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, old boy,\u201d said the oiler, and lay down\nagain and was asleep.\nPresently it seemed that even the captain dozed, and\nthe correspondent thought that he was the one man afloat\non all the oceans. The wind had a voice as it came over the\nwaves, and it was sadder than the end.\nThere was a long, loud swishing astern of the boat,\nand a gleaming trail of phosphorescence, like blue flame,\nwas furrowed on the black waters. It might have been\nmade by a monstrous knife.\nThen there came a stillness, while the correspondent\nbreathed with the open mouth and looked at the sea.\nSuddenly there was another swish and another long\nflash of bluish light, and this time it was alongside the\nboat, and might almost have been reached with an oar.\nThe correspondent saw an enormous fin speed like a\nshadow through the water, hurling the crystalline spray\nand leaving the long glowing trail.\nThe correspondent looked over his shoulder at the\ncaptain. His face was hidden, and he seemed to be asleep.\nHe looked at the babes of the sea. They certainly were\nasleep. So, being bereft of sympathy, he leaned a little\nway to one side and swore softly into the sea.\nBut the thing did not then leave the vicinity of the\nboat. Ahead or astern, on one side or the other, at intervals\nlong or short, fled the long sparkling streak, and there was\nto be heard the whirroo of the dark fin. The speed and\npower of the thing was greatly to be admired. It cut the\nwater like a gigantic and keen projectile.\nThe presence of this biding thing did not affect the man\nwith the same horror that it would if he had been a picnicker.\nHe simply looked at the sea dully and swore in an undertone.\n77 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nNevertheless, it is true that he did not wish to be alone\nwith the thing. He wished one of his companions to awaken\nby chance and keep him company with it. But the captain\nhung motionless over the water-jar and the oiler and the\ncook in the bottom of the boat were plunged in slumber.\nVI\n\u201cIf I am going to be drowned\u2014if I am going to be\ndrowned\u2014if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name\nof the seven mad gods, who rule the sea, was I allowed to\ncome thus far and contemplate sand and trees?\u201d\nDuring this dismal night, it may be remarked that a\nman would conclude that it was really the intention of the\nseven mad gods to drown him, despite the abominable\ninjustice of it. For it was certainly an abominable injustice\nto drown a man who had worked so hard, so hard. The\nman felt it would be a crime most unnatural. Other people\nhad drowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted\nsails, but still \u2014\nWhen it occurs to a man that nature does not regard\nhim as important, and that she feels she would not maim\nthe universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw\nbricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there\nare no bricks and no temples. Any visible expression of\nnature would surely be pelleted with his jeers.\nThen, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels,\nperhaps, the desire to confront a personification and\nindulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and with hands\nsupplicant, saying: \u201cYes, but I love myself.\u201d\nA high cold star on a winter\u2019s night is the word he feels\nthat she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his\nsituation.\nThe men in the dingey had not discussed these matters,\nbut each had, no doubt, reflected upon them in silence and\naccording to his mind. There was seldom any expression\nupon their faces save the general one of complete weariness.\nSpeech was devoted to the business of the boat.\nTo chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously\nentered the correspondent\u2019s head. He had even forgotten that\nhe had forgotten this verse, but it suddenly was in his mind.\n78 The Truths of Fiction\nA soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers; There\nwas lack of woman\u2019s nursing, there was dearth of woman\u2019s\ntears; But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that\ncomrade\u2019s hand And he said: \u201cI shall never see my own,\nmy native land.\u201d\nIn his childhood, the correspondent had been made\nacquainted with the fact that a soldier of the Legion lay\ndying in Algiers, but he had never regarded the fact as\nimportant. Myriads of his school-fellows had informed\nhim of the soldier\u2019s plight, but the dinning had naturally\nended by making him perfectly indifferent. He had never\nconsidered it his affair that a soldier of the Legion lay\ndying in Algiers, nor had it appeared to him as a matter for\nsorrow. It was less to him than breaking of a pencil\u2019s point.\nNow, however, it quaintly came to him as a human,\nliving thing. It was no longer merely a picture of a few\nthroes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and\nwarming his feet at the grate; it was an actuality\u2014stern,\nmournful, and fine.\nThe correspondent plainly saw the soldier. He lay on\nthe sand with his feet out straight and still. While his pale\nleft hand was upon his chest in an attempt to thwart the\ngoing of his life, the blood came between his fingers. In\nthe far Algerian distance, a city of low square forms was\nset against a sky that was faint with the last sunset hues.\nThe correspondent, plying the oars and dreaming of the\nslow and slower movements of the lips of the soldier,\nwas moved by a profound and perfectly impersonal\ncomprehension. He was sorry for the soldier of the Legion\nwho lay dying in Algiers.\nThe thing which had followed the boat and waited\nhad evidently grown bored at the delay. There was no\nlonger to be heard the slash of the cut-water, and there\nwas no longer the flame of the long trail. The light in the\nnorth still glimmered, but it was apparently no nearer\nto the boat. Sometimes the boom of the surf rang in the\ncorrespondent\u2019s ears, and he turned the craft seaward then\nand rowed harder. Southward, someone had evidently\nbuilt a watch-fire on the beach. It was too low and too far\nto be seen, but it made a shimmering, roseate reflection\n79 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nupon the bluff back of it, and this could be discerned from\nthe boat. The wind came stronger, and sometimes a wave\nsuddenly raged out like a mountain-cat and there was to\nbe seen the sheen and sparkle of a broken crest.\nThe captain, in the bow, moved on his water-jar\nand sat erect. \u201cPretty long night,\u201d he observed to the\ncorrespondent. He looked at the shore. \u201cThose life-saving\npeople take their time.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see that shark playing around?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I saw him. He was a big fellow, all right.\u201d\n\u201cWish I had known you were awake.\u201d\nLater the correspondent spoke into the bottom of the\nboat.\n\u201cBillie!\u201d There was a slow and gradual disentanglement.\n\u201cBillie, will you spell me?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d said the oiler.\nAs soon as the correspondent touched the cold\ncomfortable sea-water in the bottom of the boat, and\nhad huddled close to the cook\u2019s life-belt he was deep in\nsleep, despite the fact that his teeth played all the popular\nairs. This sleep was so good to him that it was but a\nmoment before he heard a voice call his name in a tone\nthat demonstrated the last stages of exhaustion. \u201cWill you\nspell me?\u201d\n\u201cSure, Billie.\u201d\nThe light in the north had mysteriously vanished, but\nthe correspondent took his course from the wide-awake\ncaptain.\nLater in the night they took the boat farther out to\nsea, and the captain directed the cook to take one oar at\nthe stern and keep the boat facing the seas. He was to\ncall out if he should hear the thunder of the surf. This\nplan enabled the oiler and the correspondent to get respite\ntogether. \u201cWe\u2019ll give those boys a chance to get into shape\nagain,\u201d said the captain. They curled down and, after a few\npreliminary chatterings and trembles, slept once more the\ndead sleep. Neither knew they had bequeathed to the cook\nthe company of another shark, or perhaps the same shark.\nAs the boat caroused on the waves, spray occasionally\nbumped over the side and gave them a fresh soaking, but\n80 The Truths of Fiction\nthis had no power to break their repose. The ominous\nslash of the wind and the water affected them as it would\nhave affected mummies.\n\u201cBoys,\u201d said the cook, with the notes of every reluctance\nin his voice, \u201cshe\u2019s drifted in pretty close. I guess one of\nyou had better take her to sea again.\u201d The correspondent,\naroused, heard the crash of the toppled crests.\nAs he was rowing, the captain gave him some whiskey\nand water, and this steadied the chills out of him. \u201cIf I ever\nget ashore and anybody shows me even a photograph of\nan oar\u2014\u201d\nAt last there was a short conversation.\n\u201cBillie...Billie, will you spell me?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d said the oiler.\nVII\nWhen the correspondent again opened his eyes, the\nsea and the sky were each of the gray hue of the dawning.\nLater, carmine and gold was painted upon the waters. The\nmorning appeared finally, in its splendor with a sky of pure\nblue, and the sunlight flamed on the tips of the waves.\nOn the distant dunes were set many little black\ncottages, and a tall white wind-mill reared above them.\nNo man, nor dog, nor bicycle appeared on the beach. The\ncottages might have formed a deserted village.\nThe voyagers scanned the shore. A conference was\nheld in the boat. \u201cWell,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif no help is\ncoming, we might better try a run through the surf right\naway. If we stay out here much longer we will be too\nweak to do anything for ourselves at all.\u201d The others\nsilently acquiesced in this reasoning. The boat was\nheaded for the beach. The correspondent wondered if\nnone ever ascended the tall wind-tower, and if then they\nnever looked seaward. This tower was a giant, standing\nwith its back to the plight of the ants. It represented in a\ndegree, to the correspondent, the serenity of nature amid\nthe struggles of the individual\u2014nature in the wind, and\nnature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to\nhim, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she\nwas indifferent, flatly indifferent. It is, perhaps, plausible\n81 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nthat a man in this situation, impressed with the unconcern\nof the universe, should see the innumerable flaws of his\nlife and have them taste wickedly in his mind and wish\nfor another chance. A distinction between right and wrong\nseems absurdly clear to him, then, in this new ignorance of\nthe grave-edge, and he understands that if he were given\nanother opportunity he would mend his conduct and his\nwords, and be better and brighter during an introduction,\nor at a tea.\n\u201cNow, boys,\u201d said the captain, \u201cshe is going to\nswamp sure. All we can do is to work her in as far as\npossible, and then when she swamps, pile out and\nscramble for the beach. Keep cool now and don\u2019t jump\nuntil she swamps sure.\u201d\nThe oiler took the oars. Over his shoulders he scanned\nthe surf. \u201cCaptain,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019d better bring her\nabout, and keep her head-on to the seas and back her in.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Billie,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBack her in.\u201d\nThe oiler swung the boat then and, seated in the stern,\nthe cook and the correspondent were obliged to look over\ntheir shoulders to contemplate the lonely and indifferent\nshore.\nThe monstrous inshore rollers heaved the boat high until\nthe men were again enabled to see the white sheets of water\nscudding up the slanted beach. \u201cWe won\u2019t get in very close,\u201d\nsaid the captain. Each time a man could wrest his attention\nfrom the rollers, he turned his glance toward the shore, and\nin the expression of the eyes during this contemplation there\nwas a singular quality. The correspondent, observing the\nothers, knew that they were not afraid, but the full meaning\nof their glances was shrouded.\nAs for himself, he was too tired to grapple fundamentally\nwith the fact. He tried to coerce his mind into thinking of\nit, but the mind was dominated at this time by the muscles,\nand the muscles said they did not care. It merely occurred\nto him that if he should drown it would be a shame.\nThere were no hurried words, no pallor, no plain\nagitation. The men simply looked at the shore. \u201cNow,\nremember to get well clear of the boat when you jump,\u201d\nsaid the captain.\n82 The Truths of Fiction\nSeaward the crest of a roller suddenly fell with a\nthunderous crash, and the long white comber came roaring\ndown upon the boat.\n\u201cSteady now,\u201d said the captain. The men were silent.\nThey turned their eyes from the shore to the comber and\nwaited. The boat slid up the incline, leaped at the furious\ntop, bounced over it, and swung down the long back of\nthe waves. Some water had been shipped and the cook\nbailed it out.\nBut the next crest crashed also. The tumbling boiling\nflood of white water caught the boat and whirled it\nalmost perpendicular. Water swarmed in from all sides.\nThe correspondent had his hands on the gunwale at\nthis time, and when the water entered at that place he swiftly\nwithdrew his fingers, as if he objected to wetting them.\nThe little boat, drunken with this weight of water,\nreeled and snuggled deeper into the sea.\n\u201cBail her out, cook! Bail her out,\u201d said the captain.\n\u201cAll right, captain,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cNow, boys, the next one will do for us, sure,\u201d said\nthe oiler. \u201cMind to jump clear of the boat.\u201d\nThe third wave moved forward, huge, furious,\nimplacable. It fairly swallowed the dingey, and almost\nsimultaneously the men tumbled into the sea. A piece\nof life-belt had lain in the bottom of the boat, and as the\ncorrespondent went overboard he held this to his chest\nwith his left hand.\nThe January water was icy, and he reflected\nimmediately that it was colder than he had expected to\nfind it off the coast of Florida. This appeared to his dazed\nmind as a fact important enough to be noted at the time.\nThe coldness of the water was sad; it was tragic. This fact\nwas somehow mixed and confused with his opinion of his\nown situation that it seemed almost a proper reason for\ntears. The water was cold.\nWhen he came to the surface he was conscious of little\nbut the noisy water. Afterward he saw his companions in\nthe sea. The oiler was ahead in the race. He was swimming\nstrongly and rapidly. Off to the correspondent\u2019s left, the\ncook\u2019s great white and corked back bulged out of the\n83 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nwater, and in the rear the captain was hanging with his\none good hand to the keel of the overturned dingey.\nThere is a certain immovable quality to a shore, and the\ncorrespondent wondered at it amid the confusion of the sea.\nIt seemed also very attractive, but the correspondent\nknew that it was a long journey, and he paddled leisurely.\nThe piece of life-preserver lay under him, and sometimes\nhe whirled down the incline of a wave as if he were on a\nhand-sled.\nBut finally he arrived at a place in the sea where travel\nwas beset with difficulty. He did not pause swimming\nto inquire what manner of current had caught him, but\nthere his progress ceased. The shore was set before him\nlike a bit of scenery on a stage, and he looked at it and\nunderstood with his eyes each detail of it.\nAs the cook passed, much farther to the left, the\ncaptain was calling to him, \u201cTurn over on your back,\ncook! Turn over on your back and use the oar.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, sir!\u201d The cook turned on his back, and,\npaddling with an oar, went ahead as if he were a canoe.\nPresently the boat also passed to the left of the\ncorrespondent with the captain clinging with one hand\nto the keel. He would have appeared like a man raising\nhimself to look over a board fence, if it were not for the\nextraordinary gymnastics of the boat. The correspondent\nmarvelled that the captain could still hold to it.\nThey passed on, nearer to shore\u2014the oiler, the cook,\nthe captain\u2014and following them went the water-jar,\nbouncing gayly over the seas.\nThe correspondent remained in the grip of this strange\nnew enemy\u2014a current. The shore, with its white slope of\nsand and its green bluff, topped with little silent cottages,\nwas spread like a picture before him. It was very near to\nhim then, but he was impressed as one who in a gallery\nlooks at a scene from Brittany or Algiers.\nHe thought: \u201cI am going to drown? Can it be\npossible? Can it be possible? Can it be possible?\u201d Perhaps\nan individual must consider his own death to be the final\nphenomenon of nature.\nBut later a wave perhaps whirled him out of this small\n84 The Truths of Fiction\ndeadly current, for he found suddenly that he could again\nmake progress toward the shore. Later still, he was aware\nthat the captain, clinging with one hand to the keel of\nthe dingey, had his face turned away from the shore and\ntoward him, and was calling his name. \u201cCome to the boat!\nCome to the boat!\u201d\nIn his struggle to reach the captain and the boat, he\nreflected that when one gets properly wearied, drowning\nmust really be a comfortable arrangement, a cessation of\nhostilities accompanied by a large degree of relief, and\nhe was glad of it, for the main thing in his mind for some\nmoments had been horror of the temporary agony. He did\nnot wish to be hurt.\nPresently he saw a man running along the shore.\nHe was undressing with most remarkable speed. Coat,\ntrousers, shirt, everything flew magically off him.\n\u201cCome to the boat,\u201d called the captain.\n\u201cAll right, captain.\u201d As the correspondent paddled,\nhe saw the captain let himself down to bottom and leave\nthe boat. Then the correspondent performed his one little\nmarvel of the voyage. A large wave caught him and flung\nhim with ease and supreme speed completely over the boat\nand far beyond it. It struck him even then as an event in\ngymnastics, and a true miracle of the sea. An overturned\nboat in the surf is not a plaything to a swimming man.\nThe correspondent arrived in water that reached only\nto his waist, but his condition did not enable him to stand\nfor more than a moment. Each wave knocked him into a\nheap, and the under-tow pulled at him.\nThen he saw the man who had been running and\nundressing, and undressing and running, come bounding\ninto the water. He dragged ashore the cook, and then waded\ntoward the captain, but the captain waved him away, and\nsent him to the correspondent. He was naked, naked as a\ntree in winter, but a halo was about his head, and he shone\nlike a saint. He gave a strong pull, and a long drag, and a\nbully heave at the correspondent\u2019s hand. The correspondent,\nschooled in the minor formulae, said: \u201cThanks, old man.\u201d\nBut suddenly the man cried: \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He pointed a\nswift finger. The correspondent said: \u201cGo.\u201d\n85 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nIn the shallows, face downward, lay the oiler. His\nforehead touched sand that was periodically, between\neach wave, clear of the sea.\nThe correspondent did not know all that transpired\nafterward. When he achieved safe ground he fell, striking\nthe sand with each particular part of his body. It was as if he\nhad dropped from a roof, but the thud was grateful to him.\nIt seems that instantly the beach was populated with\nmen with blankets, clothes, and flasks, and women with\ncoffee-pots and all the remedies sacred to their minds. The\nwelcome of the land to the men from the sea was warm\nand generous, but a still and dripping shape was carried\nslowly up the beach, and the land\u2019s welcome for it could\nonly be the different and sinister hospitality of the grave.\nWhen it came night, the white waves paced to and fro\nin the moonlight, and the wind brought the sound of the\ngreat sea\u2019s voice to the men on shore, and they felt that\nthey could then be interpreters.\n(1897)\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1.

Chesnutt\nI\nWhen it is said that it was done to please a woman,\nthere ought perhaps to be enough said to explain anything;\nfor what a man will not do to please a woman is yet to be\ndiscovered. Nevertheless, it might be well to state a few\npreliminary facts to make it clear why young Dick Owens\ntried to run one of his father\u2019s negro men off to Canada.\nIn the early fifties, when the growth of anti-slavery\nsentiment and the constant drain of fugitive slaves into\nthe North had so alarmed the slaveholders of the border\nStates as to lead to the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law,\na young white man from Ohio, moved by compassion for\nthe sufferings of a certain bondman who happened to have\na \u201chard master,\u201d essayed to help the slave to freedom. The\nattempt was discovered and frustrated; the abductor was\ntried and convicted for slave-stealing, and sentenced to\na term of imprisonment in the penitentiary. His death,\nafter the expiration of only a small part of the sentence,\nfrom cholera contracted while nursing stricken fellow\nprisoners, lent to the case a melancholy interest that made\nit famous in anti-slavery annals.\nDick Owens had attended the trial. He was a youth of\nabout twenty-two, intelligent, handsome, and amiable, but\nextremely indolent, in a graceful and gentlemanly way;\nor, as old Judge Fenderson put it more than once, he was\nlazy as the Devil,\u2014a mere figure of speech, of course, and\nnot one that did justice to the Enemy of Mankind. When\nasked why he never did anything serious, Dick would\ngood-naturedly reply, with a well-modulated drawl, that he\ndidn\u2019t have to. His father was rich; there was but one other\nchild, an unmarried daughter, who because of poor health\nwould probably never marry, and Dick was therefore heir\npresumptive to a large estate. Wealth or social position he\ndid not need to seek, for he was born to both. Charity Lomax\nhad shamed him into studying law, but notwithstanding an\nhour or so a day spent at old Judge Fenderson\u2019s office, he\ndid not make remarkable headway in his legal studies.\n87 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n\u201cWhat Dick needs,\u201d said the judge, who was fond of\ntropes, as became a scholar, and of horses, as was befitting\na Kentuckian, \u201cis the whip of necessity, or the spur of\nambition. If he had either, he would soon need the snaffle\nto hold him back.\u201d\nBut all Dick required, in fact, to prompt him to the\nmost remarkable thing he accomplished before he was\ntwenty-five, was a mere suggestion from Charity Lomax.\nThe story was never really known to but two persons until\nafter the war, when it came out because it was a good story\nand there was no particular reason for its concealment.\nYoung Owens had attended the trial of this slave-\nstealer, or martyr,\u2014either or both,\u2014and, when it was\nover, had gone to call on Charity Lomax, and, while they\nsat on the veranda after sundown, had told her all about\nthe trial. He was a good talker, as his career in later years\ndisclosed, and described the proceedings very graphically.\n\u201cI confess,\u201d he admitted, \u201cthat while my principles\nwere against the prisoner, my sympathies were on his side.\nIt appeared that he was of good family, and that he had\nan old father and mother, respectable people, dependent\nupon him for support and comfort in their declining years.\nHe had been led into the matter by pity for a negro whose\nmaster ought to have been run out of the county long ago\nfor abusing his slaves. If it had been merely a question\nof old Sam Briggs\u2019s negro, nobody would have cared\nanything about it. But father and the rest of them stood\non the principle of the thing, and told the judge so, and the\nfellow was sentenced to three years in the penitentiary.\u201d\nMiss Lomax had listened with lively interest.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always hated old Sam Briggs,\u201d she said\nemphatically, \u201cever since the time he broke a negro\u2019s leg\nwith a piece of cordwood. When I hear of a cruel deed it\nmakes the Quaker blood that came from my grandmother\nassert itself. Personally I wish that all Sam Briggs\u2019s negroes\nwould run away. As for the young man, I regard him as a\nhero. He dared something for humanity. I could love a man\nwho would take such chances for the sake of others.\u201d\n\u201cCould you love me, Charity, if I did something heroic?\u201d\n\u201cYou never will, Dick. You\u2019re too lazy for any use.\n88 The Truths of Fiction\nYou\u2019ll never do anything harder than playing cards or\nfox-hunting.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come now, sweetheart! I\u2019ve been courting you\nfor a year, and it\u2019s the hardest work imaginable. Are you\nnever going to love me?\u201d he pleaded.\nHis hand sought hers, but she drew it back beyond\nhis reach.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never love you, Dick Owens, until you have done\nsomething. When that time comes, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\n\u201cBut it takes so long to do anything worth mentioning,\nand I don\u2019t want to wait. One must read two years to\nbecome a lawyer, and work five more to make a reputation.\nWe shall both be gray by then.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she rejoined. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require\na lifetime for a man to prove that he is a man. This one\ndid something, or at least tried to.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m willing to attempt as much as any other man.\nWhat do you want me to do, sweetheart? Give me a test.\u201d\n\u201cOh, dear me!\u201d said Charity, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you\ndo, so you do something. Really, come to think of it, why\nshould I care whether you do anything or not?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know why you should, Charity,\u201d\nrejoined Dick humbly, \u201cfor I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m not worthy\nof it.\u201d\n\u201cExcept that I do hate,\u201d she added, relenting slightly, \u201cto\nsee a really clever man so utterly lazy and good for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my dear; a word of praise from you has\nsharpened my wits already. I have an idea! Will you love\nme if I run a negro off to Canada?\u201d\n\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d said Charity scornfully. \u201cYou must\nbe losing your wits. Steal another man\u2019s slave, indeed,\nwhile your father owns a hundred!\u201d\n\u201cOh, there\u2019ll be no trouble about that,\u201d responded\nDick lightly; \u201cI\u2019ll run off one of the old man\u2019s; we\u2019ve got\ntoo many anyway. It may not be quite as difficult as the\nother man found it, but it will be just as unlawful, and will\ndemonstrate what I am capable of.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing\u2019s believing,\u201d replied Charity. \u201cOf course,\nwhat you are talking about now is merely absurd. I\u2019m\ngoing away for three weeks, to visit my aunt in Tennessee.\n89 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nIf you\u2019re able to tell me, when I return, that you\u2019ve done\nsomething to prove your quality, I\u2019ll\u2014well, you may\ncome and tell me about it.\u201d\nII\nYoung Owens got up about nine o\u2019clock next\nmorning, and while making his toilet put some questions\nto his personal attendant, a rather bright looking young\nmulatto of about his own age.\n\u201cTom,\u201d said Dick.\n\u201cYas, Mars Dick,\u201d responded the servant.\n\u201cI\u2019m going on a trip North. Would you like to go\nwith me?\u201d\nNow, if there was anything that Tom would have liked\nto make, it was a trip North. It was something he had long\ncontemplated in the abstract, but had never been able to\nmuster up sufficient courage to attempt in the concrete. He\nwas prudent enough, however, to dissemble his feelings.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t min\u2019 it, Mars Dick, ez long ez you\u2019d take\nkeer er me an\u2019 fetch me home all right.\u201d\nTom\u2019s eyes belied his words, however, and his young\nmaster felt well assured that Tom needed only a good\nopportunity to make him run away. Having a comfortable\nhome, and a dismal prospect in case of failure, Tom was\nnot likely to take any desperate chances; but young Owens\nwas satisfied that in a free State but little persuasion\nwould be required to lead Tom astray. With a very logical\nand characteristic desire to gain his end with the least\nnecessary expenditure of effort, he decided to take Tom\nwith him, if his father did not object.\nColonel Owens had left the house when Dick went\nto breakfast, so Dick did not see his father till luncheon.\n\u201cFather,\u201d he remarked casually to the colonel, over\nthe fried chicken, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a trifle run down. I imagine\nmy health would be improved somewhat by a little travel\nand change of scene.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a trip North?\u201d suggested\nhis father. The colonel added to paternal affection a\nconsiderable respect for his son as the heir of a large estate.\nHe himself had been \u201craised\u201d in comparative poverty, and\n90 The Truths of Fiction\nhad laid the foundations of his fortune by hard work; and\nwhile he despised the ladder by which he had climbed, he\ncould not entirely forget it, and unconsciously manifested,\nin his intercourse with his son, some of the poor man\u2019s\ndeference toward the wealthy and well-born.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll adopt your suggestion, sir,\u201d replied the\nson, \u201cand run up to New York; and after I\u2019ve been there\nawhile I may go on to Boston for a week or so. I\u2019ve never\nbeen there, you know.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some matters you can talk over with my\nfactor in New York,\u201d rejoined the colonel, \u201cand while\nyou are up there among the Yankees, I hope you\u2019ll keep\nyour eyes and ears open to find out what the rascally\nabolitionists are saying and doing. They\u2019re becoming\naltogether too active for our comfort, and entirely too\nmany ungrateful niggers are running away. I hope the\nconviction of that fellow yesterday may discourage the\nrest of the breed. I\u2019d just like to catch any one trying to\nrun off one of my darkeys. He\u2019d get short shrift; I don\u2019t\nthink any Court would have a chance to try him.\u201d\n\u201cThey are a pestiferous lot,\u201d assented Dick, \u201cand\ndangerous to our institutions. But say, father, if I go North\nI shall want to take Tom with me.\u201d\nNow, the colonel, while a very indulgent father, had\npronounced views on the subject of negroes, having\nstudied them, as he often said, for a great many years, and,\nas he asserted oftener still, understanding them perfectly.\nIt is scarcely worth while to say, either, that he valued\nmore highly than if he had inherited them the slaves he\nhad toiled and schemed for.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it safe to take Tom up North,\u201d he\ndeclared, with promptness and decision. \u201cHe\u2019s a good\nenough boy, but too smart to trust among those low-down\nabolitionists. I strongly suspect him of having learned\nto read, though I can\u2019t imagine how. I saw him with a\nnewspaper the other day, and while he pretended to be\nlooking at a woodcut, I\u2019m almost sure he was reading the\npaper. I think it by no means safe to take him.\u201d\nDick did not insist, because he knew it was useless.\nThe colonel would have obliged his son in any other\n91 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nmatter, but his negroes were the outward and visible sign\nof his wealth and station, and therefore sacred to him.\n\u201cWhom do you think it safe to take?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cI\nsuppose I\u2019ll have to have a body-servant.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Grandison?\u201d suggested\nthe colonel. \u201cHe\u2019s handy enough, and I reckon we can\ntrust him. He\u2019s too fond of good eating, to risk losing his\nregular meals; besides, he\u2019s sweet on your mother\u2019s maid,\nBetty, and I\u2019ve promised to let \u2018em get married before\nlong. I\u2019ll have Grandison up, and we\u2019ll talk to him. Here,\nyou boy Jack,\u201d called the colonel to a yellow youth in\nthe next room who was catching flies and pulling their\nwings off to pass the time, \u201cgo down to the barn and tell\nGrandison to come here.\u201d\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d said the colonel, when the negro stood\nbefore him, hat in hand.\n\u201cYas, marster.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I always treated you right?\u201d\n\u201cYas, marster.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you always got all you wanted to eat?\u201d\n\u201cYas, marster.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as much whiskey and tobacco as was good for\nyou, Grandison?\u201d\n\u201cY-a-s, marster.\u201d\n\u201cI should just like to know, Grandison, whether you\ndon\u2019t think yourself a great deal better off than those poor\nfree negroes down by the plank road, with no kind master\nto look after them and no mistress to give them medicine\nwhen they\u2019re sick and\u2014and\u201d\u2014\u2014\n\u201cWell, I sh\u2019d jes\u2019 reckon I is better off, suh, dan dem\nlow-down free niggers, suh! Ef anybody ax \u2018em who dey\nb\u2019long ter, dey has ter say nobody, er e\u2019se lie erbout it.\nAnybody ax me who I b\u2019longs ter, I ain\u2019 got no \u2018casion ter\nbe shame\u2019 ter tell \u2018em, no, suh, \u2018deed I ain\u2019, suh!\u201d\nThe colonel was beaming. This was true gratitude, and\nhis feudal heart thrilled at such appreciative homage. What\ncold-blooded, heartless monsters they were who would\nbreak up this blissful relationship of kindly protection on\nthe one hand, of wise subordination and loyal dependence\non the other! The colonel always became indignant at the\nmere thought of such wickedness.\n92 The Truths of Fiction\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d the colonel continued, \u201cyour young\nmaster Dick is going North for a few weeks, and I am\nthinking of letting him take you along. I shall send you on\nthis trip, Grandison, in order that you may take care of your\nyoung master. He will need some one to wait on him, and\nno one can ever do it so well as one of the boys brought up\nwith him on the old plantation. I am going to trust him in\nyour hands, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do your duty faithfully, and\nbring him back home safe and sound\u2014to old Kentucky.\u201d\nGrandison grinned. \u201cOh yas, marster, I\u2019ll take keer er\nyoung Mars Dick.\u201d\n\u201cI want to warn you, though, Grandison,\u201d continued the\ncolonel impressively, \u201cagainst these cussed abolitionists,\nwho try to entice servants from their comfortable homes and\ntheir indulgent masters, from the blue skies, the green fields,\nand the warm sunlight of their southern home, and send\nthem away off yonder to Canada, a dreary country, where\nthe woods are full of wildcats and wolves and bears, where\nthe snow lies up to the eaves of the houses for six months\nof the year, and the cold is so severe that it freezes your\nbreath and curdles your blood; and where, when runaway\nniggers get sick and can\u2019t work, they are turned out to starve\nand die, unloved and uncared for. I reckon, Grandison,\nthat you have too much sense to permit yourself to be led\nastray by any such foolish and wicked people.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Deed, suh, I would n\u2019 low none er dem cussed,\nlow-down abolitioners ter come nigh me, suh. I\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d\u2014\nwould I be \u2018lowed ter hit \u2018em, suh?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, Grandison,\u201d replied the colonel, chuckling,\n\u201chit \u2018em as hard as you can. I reckon they\u2019d rather like it.\nBegad, I believe they would! It would serve \u2018em right to\nbe hit by a nigger!\u201d\n\u201cEr ef I did n\u2019t hit \u2018em, suh,\u201d continued Grandison\nreflectively, \u201cI\u2019d tell Mars Dick, en he\u2019d fix \u2018em. He\u2019d\nsmash de face off\u2019n \u2018em, suh, I jes\u2019 knows he would.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, Grandison, your young master will protect\nyou. You need fear no harm while he is near.\u201d\n\u201cDey won\u2019t try ter steal me, will dey, marster?\u201d asked\nthe negro, with sudden alarm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Grandison,\u201d replied the colonel,\nlighting a fresh cigar. \u201cThey\u2019re a desperate set of lunatics,\n93 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nand there\u2019s no telling what they may resort to. But if you\nstick close to your young master, and remember always\nthat he is your best friend, and understands your real\nneeds, and has your true interests at heart, and if you will\nbe careful to avoid strangers who try to talk to you, you\u2019ll\nstand a fair chance of getting back to your home and your\nfriends. And if you please your master Dick, he\u2019ll buy you\na present, and a string of beads for Betty to wear when\nyou and she get married in the fall.\u201d\n\u201cThanky, marster, thanky, suh,\u201d replied Grandison,\noozing gratitude at every pore; \u201cyou is a good marster,\nto be sho\u2019, suh; yas, \u2018deed you is. You kin jes\u2019 bet me and\nMars Dick gwine git \u2018long jes\u2019 lack I wuz own boy ter\nMars Dick. En it won\u2019t be my fault ef he don\u2019 want me\nfer his boy all de time, w\u2019en we come back home ag\u2019in.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Grandison, you may go now. You need n\u2019t\nwork any more to-day, and here\u2019s a piece of tobacco for\nyou off my own plug.\u201d\n\u201cThanky, marster, thanky, marster! You is de bes\u2019\nmarster any nigger ever had in dis worl\u2019.\u201d And Grandison\nbowed and scraped and disappeared round the corner, his\njaws closing around a large section of the colonel\u2019s best\ntobacco.\n\u201cYou may take Grandison,\u201d said the colonel to his\nson. \u201cI allow he\u2019s abolitionist-proof.\u201d\nIII\nRichard Owens, Esq., and servant, from Kentucky,\nregistered at the fashionable New York hostelry for\nSoutherners in those days, a hotel where an atmosphere\ncongenial to Southern institutions was sedulously maintained.\nBut there were negro waiters in the dining-room, and mulatto\nbell-boys, and Dick had no doubt that Grandison, with the\nnative gregariousness and garrulousness of his race, would\nforegather and palaver with them sooner or later, and Dick\nhoped that they would speedily inoculate him with the virus\nof freedom. For it was not Dick\u2019s intention to say anything\nto his servant about his plan to free him, for obvious reasons.\nTo mention one of them, if Grandison should go away, and\nby legal process be recaptured, his young master\u2019s part in\n94 The Truths of Fiction\nthe matter would doubtless become known, which would\nbe embarrassing to Dick, to say the least. If, on the other\nhand, he should merely give Grandison sufficient latitude,\nhe had no doubt he would eventually lose him. For while\nnot exactly skeptical about Grandison\u2019s perfervid loyalty,\nDick had been a somewhat keen observer of human nature,\nin his own indolent way, and based his expectations upon\nthe force of the example and argument that his servant\ncould scarcely fail to encounter. Grandison should have a\nfair chance to become free by his own initiative; if it should\nbecome necessary to adopt other measures to get rid of him,\nit would be time enough to act when the necessity arose;\nand Dick Owens was not the youth to take needless trouble.\nThe young master renewed some acquaintances and\nmade others, and spent a week or two very pleasantly\nin the best society of the metropolis, easily accessible\nto a wealthy, well-bred young Southerner, with proper\nintroductions. Young women smiled on him, and young\nmen of convivial habits pressed their hospitalities; but\nthe memory of Charity\u2019s sweet, strong face and clear blue\neyes made him proof against the blandishments of the\none sex and the persuasions of the other. Meanwhile he\nkept Grandison supplied with pocket-money, and left him\nmainly to his own devices. Every night when Dick came\nin he hoped he might have to wait upon himself, and every\nmorning he looked forward with pleasure to the prospect\nof making his toilet unaided. His hopes, however, were\ndoomed to disappointment, for every night when he came\nin Grandison was on hand with a bootjack, and a nightcap\nmixed for his young master as the colonel had taught him\nto mix it, and every morning Grandison appeared with his\nmaster\u2019s boots blacked and his clothes brushed, and laid\nhis linen out for the day.\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d said Dick one morning, after finishing\nhis toilet, \u201cthis is the chance of your life to go around\namong your own people and see how they live. Have you\nmet any of them?\u201d\n\u201cYas, suh, I\u2019s seen some of \u2018em. But I don\u2019 keer nuffin\nfer \u2018em, suh. Dey\u2019re diffe\u2019nt f\u2019m de niggers down ou\u2019\nway. Dey \u2018lows dey\u2019re free, but dey ain\u2019 got sense \u2018nuff\n95 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nter know dey ain\u2019 half as well off as dey would be down\nSouf, whar dey\u2019d be \u2018predated.\u201d\nWhen two weeks had passed without any apparent\neffect of evil example upon Grandison, Dick resolved to\ngo on to Boston, where he thought the atmosphere might\nprove more favorable to his ends. After he had been at the\nRevere House for a day or two without losing Grandison,\nhe decided upon slightly different tactics.\nHaving ascertained from a city directory the addresses\nof several well-known abolitionists, he wrote them each a\nletter something like this:\u2014\u2014\nDear Friend and Brother:\u2014\u2014\nA wicked slaveholder from Kentucky, stopping at\nthe Revere House, has dared to insult the liberty-loving\npeople of Boston by bringing his slave into their midst.\nShall this be tolerated? Or shall steps be taken in the\nname of liberty to rescue a fellow-man from bondage?\nFor obvious reasons I can only sign myself,\nA Friend of Humanity.\nThat his letter might have an opportunity to prove\neffective, Dick made it a point to send Grandison away\nfrom the hotel on various errands. On one of these\noccasions Dick watched him for quite a distance down\nthe street. Grandison had scarcely left the hotel when a\nlong-haired, sharp-featured man came out behind him,\nfollowed him, soon overtook him, and kept along beside\nhim until they turned the next corner. Dick\u2019s hopes were\nroused by this spectacle, but sank correspondingly when\nGrandison returned to the hotel. As Grandison said nothing\nabout the encounter, Dick hoped there might be some\nself-consciousness behind this unexpected reticence, the\nresults of which might develop later on.\nBut Grandison was on hand again when his master\ncame back to the hotel at night, and was in attendance\nagain in the morning, with hot water, to assist at his\nmaster\u2019s toilet. Dick sent him on further errands from day\n96 The Truths of Fiction\nto day, and upon one occasion came squarely up to him\u2014\ninadvertently of course\u2014while Grandison was engaged\nin conversation with a young white man in clerical garb.\nWhen Grandison saw Dick approaching, he edged away\nfrom the preacher and hastened toward his master, with a\nvery evident expression of relief upon his countenance.\n\u201cMars Dick,\u201d he said, \u201cdese yer abolitioners is jes\u2019\npesterin\u2019 de life out er me tryin\u2019 ter git me ter run away. I\ndon\u2019 pay no \u2018tention ter \u2018em, but dey riles me so sometimes\ndat I\u2019m feared I\u2019ll hit some of \u2018em some er dese days, an\u2019\ndat mought git me inter trouble. I ain\u2019 said nuffin\u2019 ter you\n\u2018bout it, Mars Dick, fer I didn\u2019 wanter \u2018sturb yo\u2019 min\u2019; but\nI don\u2019 like it, suh; no, suh, I don\u2019! Is we gwine back home\n\u2018fo\u2019 long, Mars Dick?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going back soon enough,\u201d replied Dick\nsomewhat shortly, while he inwardly cursed the stupidity\nof a slave who could be free and would not, and registered\na secret vow that if he were unable to get rid of Grandison\nwithout assassinating him, and were therefore compelled\nto take him back to Kentucky, he would see that Grandison\ngot a taste of an article of slavery that would make him\nregret his wasted opportunities. Meanwhile he determined\nto tempt his servant yet more strongly.\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d he said next morning, \u201cI\u2019m going away\nfor a day or two, but I shall leave you here. I shall lock\nup a hundred dollars in this drawer and give you the key.\nIf you need any of it, use it and enjoy yourself,\u2014spend it\nall if you like,\u2014for this is probably the last chance you\u2019ll\nhave for some time to be in a free State, and you\u2019d better\nenjoy your liberty while you may.\u201d\nWhen he came back a couple of days later and found\nthe faithful Grandison at his post, and the hundred dollars\nintact, Dick felt seriously annoyed. His vexation was\nincreased by the fact that he could not express his feelings\nadequately. He did not even scold Grandison; how could\nhe, indeed, find fault with one who so sensibly recognized\nhis true place in the economy of civilization, and kept it\nwith such touching fidelity?\n\u201cI can\u2019t say a thing to him,\u201d groaned Dick. \u201cHe\ndeserves a leather medal, made out of his own hide\n97 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\ntanned. I reckon I\u2019ll write to father and let him know what\na model servant he has given me.\u201d\nHe wrote his father a letter which made the colonel\nswell with pride and pleasure. \u201cI really think,\u201d the colonel\nobserved to one of his friends, \u201cthat Dick ought to have\nthe nigger interviewed by the Boston papers, so that they\nmay see how contented and happy our darkeys really are.\u201d\nDick also wrote a long letter to Charity Lomax, in\nwhich he said, among many other things, that if she knew\nhow hard he was working, and under what difficulties,\nto accomplish something serious for her sake, she would\nno longer keep him in suspense, but overwhelm him with\nlove and admiration.\nHaving thus exhausted without result the more obvious\nmethods of getting rid of Grandison, and diplomacy having\nalso proved a failure, Dick was forced to consider more\nradical measures. Of course he might run away himself,\nand abandon Grandison, but this would be merely to leave\nhim in the United States, where he was still a slave, and\nwhere, with his notions of loyalty, he would speedily\nbe reclaimed. It was necessary, in order to accomplish\nthe purpose of his trip to the North, to leave Grandison\npermanently in Canada, where he would be legally free.\n\u201cI might extend my trip to Canada,\u201d he reflected, \u201cbut\nthat would be too palpable. I have it! I\u2019ll visit Niagara\nFalls on the way home, and lose him on the Canada side.\nWhen he once realizes that he is actually free, I\u2019ll warrant\nthat he\u2019ll stay.\u201d\nSo the next day saw them westward bound, and in\ndue course of time, by the somewhat slow conveyances\nof the period, they found themselves at Niagara. Dick\nwalked and drove about the Falls for several days, taking\nGrandison along with him on most occasions. One\nmorning they stood on the Canadian side, watching the\nwild whirl of the waters below them.\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d said Dick, raising his voice above the\nroar of the cataract, \u201cdo you know where you are now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019s wid you, Mars Dick; dat\u2019s all I keers.\u201d\n\u201cYou are now in Canada, Grandison, where your\npeople go when they run away from their masters. If you\n98 The Truths of Fiction\nwished, Grandison, you might walk away from me this\nvery minute, and I could not lay my hand upon you to\ntake you back.\u201d\nGrandison looked around uneasily.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back ober de ribber, Mars Dick. I\u2019s feared\nI\u2019ll lose you ovuh heah, an\u2019 den I won\u2019 hab no marster, an\u2019\nwon\u2019t nebber be able to git back home no mo\u2019.\u201d\nDiscouraged, but not yet hopeless, Dick said, a few\nminutes later,\u2014\u2014\n\u201cGrandison, I\u2019m going up the road a bit, to the inn\nover yonder. You stay here until I return. I\u2019ll not be gone\na great while.\u201d\nGrandison\u2019s eyes opened wide and he looked\nsomewhat fearful.\n\u201cIs dey any er dem dadblasted abolitioners roun\u2019\nheah, Mars Dick?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine that there are,\u201d replied his master,\nhoping there might be. \u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of your\nrunning away, Grandison. I only wish I were,\u201d he added\nto himself.\nDick walked leisurely down the road to where the\nwhitewashed inn, built of stone, with true British solidity,\nloomed up through the trees by the roadside. Arrived there\nhe ordered a glass of ale and a sandwich, and took a seat at\na table by a window, from which he could see Grandison in\nthe distance. For a while he hoped that the seed he had sown\nmight have fallen on fertile ground, and that Grandison,\nrelieved from the restraining power of a master\u2019s eye, and\nfinding himself in a free country, might get up and walk\naway; but the hope was vain, for Grandison remained\nfaithfully at his post, awaiting his master\u2019s return. He had\nseated himself on a broad flat stone, and, turning his eyes\naway from the grand and awe-inspiring spectacle that lay\nclose at hand, was looking anxiously toward the inn where\nhis master sat cursing his ill-timed fidelity.\nBy and by a girl came into the room to serve his order,\nand Dick very naturally glanced at her; and as she was\nyoung and pretty and remained in attendance, it was some\nminutes before he looked for Grandison. When he did so\nhis faithful servant had disappeared.\n99 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nTo pay his reckoning and go away without the change\nwas a matter quickly accomplished. Retracing his footsteps\ntoward the Falls, he saw, to his great disgust, as he approached\nthe spot where he had left Grandison, the familiar form of\nhis servant stretched out on the ground, his face to the sun,\nhis mouth open, sleeping the time away, oblivious alike\nto the grandeur of the scenery, the thunderous roar of the\ncataract, or the insidious voice of sentiment.\n\u201cGrandison,\u201d soliloquized his master, as he stood\ngazing down at his ebony encumbrance, \u201cI do not\ndeserve to be an American citizen; I ought not to have\nthe advantages I possess over you; and I certainly am not\nworthy of Charity Lomax, if I am not smart enough to get\nrid of you. I have an idea! You shall yet be free, and I will\nbe the instrument of your deliverance. Sleep on, faithful\nand affectionate servitor, and dream of the blue grass and\nthe bright skies of old Kentucky, for it is only in your\ndreams that you will ever see them again!\u201d\nDick retraced his footsteps towards the inn. The\nyoung woman chanced to look out of the window and saw\nthe handsome young gentleman she had waited on a few\nminutes before, standing in the road a short distance away,\napparently engaged in earnest conversation with a colored\nman employed as hostler for the inn. She thought she saw\nsomething pass from the white man to the other, but at\nthat moment her duties called her away from the window,\nand when she looked out again the young gentleman had\ndisappeared, and the hostler, with two other young men\nof the neighborhood, one white and one colored, were\nwalking rapidly towards the Falls.\nIV\nDick made the journey homeward alone, and as\nrapidly as the conveyances of the day would permit. As\nhe drew near home his conduct in going back without\nGrandison took on a more serious aspect than it had borne\nat any previous time, and although he had prepared the\ncolonel by a letter sent several days ahead, there was still\nthe prospect of a bad quarter of an hour with him; not,\nindeed, that his father would upbraid him, but he was\n100 The Truths of Fiction\nlikely to make searching inquiries. And notwithstanding\nthe vein of quiet recklessness that had carried Dick\nthrough his preposterous scheme, he was a very poor liar,\nhaving rarely had occasion or inclination to tell anything\nbut the truth. Any reluctance to meet his father was more\nthan offset, however, by a stronger force drawing him\nhomeward, for Charity Lomax must long since have\nreturned from her visit to her aunt in Tennessee.\nDick got off easier than he had expected. He told a\nstraight story, and a truthful one, so far as it went.\nThe colonel raged at first, but rage soon subsided\ninto anger, and anger moderated into annoyance, and\nannoyance into a sort of garrulous sense of injury. The\ncolonel thought he had been hardly used; he had trusted\nthis negro, and he had broken faith. Yet, after all, he did\nnot blame Grandison so much as he did the abolitionists,\nwho were undoubtedly at the bottom of it.\nAs for Charity Lomax, Dick told her, privately of\ncourse, that he had run his father\u2019s man, Grandison, off to\nCanada, and left him there.\n\u201cOh, Dick,\u201d she had said with shuddering alarm,\n\u201cwhat have you done? If they knew it they\u2019d send you to\nthe penitentiary, like they did that Yankee.\u201d\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t know it,\u201d he had replied seriously;\nadding, with an injured tone, \u201cyou don\u2019t seem to appreciate\nmy heroism like you did that of the Yankee; perhaps it\u2019s\nbecause I wasn\u2019t caught and sent to the penitentiary. I\nthought you wanted me to do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Dick Owens!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou know I\nnever dreamed of any such outrageous proceeding.\n\u201cBut I presume I\u2019ll have to marry you,\u201d she concluded,\nafter some insistence on Dick\u2019s part, \u201cif only to take care\nof you. You are too reckless for anything; and a man who\ngoes chasing all over the North, being entertained by New\nYork and Boston society and having negroes to throw\naway, needs some one to look after him.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a most remarkable thing,\u201d replied Dick fervently,\n\u201cthat your views correspond exactly with my profoundest\nconvictions. It proves beyond question that we were made\nfor one another.\u201d\n101 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n* * * * *\nThey were married three weeks later. As each of\nthem had just returned from a journey, they spent their\nhoneymoon at home.\nA week after the wedding they were seated, one\nafternoon, on the piazza of the colonel\u2019s house, where\nDick had taken his bride, when a negro from the yard ran\ndown the lane and threw open the big gate for the colonel\u2019s\nbuggy to enter. The colonel was not alone. Beside him,\nragged and travel-stained, bowed with weariness, and\nupon his face a haggard look that told of hardship and\nprivation, sat the lost Grandison.\nThe colonel alighted at the steps.\n\u201cTake the lines, Tom,\u201d he said to the man who had\nopened the gate, \u201cand drive round to the barn. Help\nGrandison down,\u2014poor devil, he\u2019s so stiff he can hardly\nmove!\u2014and get a tub of water and wash him and rub him\ndown, and feed him, and give him a big drink of whiskey,\nand then let him come round and see his young master\nand his new mistress.\u201d\nThe colonel\u2019s face wore an expression compounded of\njoy and indignation,\u2014joy at the restoration of a valuable\npiece of property; indignation for reasons he proceeded\nto state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astounding, the depths of depravity the human\nheart is capable of! I was coming along the road three miles\naway, when I heard some one call me from the roadside.\nI pulled up the mare, and who should come out of the\nwoods but Grandison. The poor nigger could hardly crawl\nalong, with the help of a broken limb. I was never more\nastonished in my life. You could have knocked me down\nwith a feather. He seemed pretty far gone,\u2014he could hardly\ntalk above a whisper,\u2014and I had to give him a mouthful\nof whiskey to brace him up so he could tell his story. It\u2019s\njust as I thought from the beginning, Dick; Grandison had\nno notion of running away; he knew when he was well\noff, and where his friends were. All the persuasions of\nabolition liars and runaway niggers did not move him. But\nthe desperation of those fanatics knew no bounds; their\nguilty consciences gave them no rest. They got the notion\n102 The Truths of Fiction\nsomehow that Grandison belonged to a nigger-catcher, and\nhad been brought North as a spy to help capture ungrateful\nrunaway servants. They actually kidnaped him\u2014just\nthink of it!\u2014and gagged him and bound him and threw\nhim rudely into a wagon, and carried him into the gloomy\ndepths of a Canadian forest, and locked him in a lonely\nhut, and fed him on bread and water for three weeks. One\nof the scoundrels wanted to kill him, and persuaded the\nothers that it ought to be done; but they got to quarreling\nabout how they should do it, and before they had their\nminds made up Grandison escaped, and, keeping his back\nsteadily to the North Star, made his way, after suffering\nincredible hardships, back to the old plantation, back to\nhis master, his friends, and his home. Why, it\u2019s as good as\none of Scott\u2019s novels! Mr. Simms or some other one of our\nSouthern authors ought to write it up.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think, sir,\u201d suggested Dick, who had calmly\nsmoked his cigar throughout the colonel\u2019s animated recital,\n\u201cthat that kidnaping yarn sounds a little improbable? Isn\u2019t\nthere some more likely explanation?\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, Dick; it\u2019s the gospel truth! Those infernal\nabolitionists are capable of anything\u2014everything! Just\nthink of their locking the poor, faithful nigger up, beating\nhim, kicking him, depriving him of his liberty, keeping\nhim on bread and water for three long, lonesome weeks,\nand he all the time pining for the old plantation!\u201d\nThere were almost tears in the colonel\u2019s eyes at the\npicture of Grandison\u2019s sufferings that he conjured up. Dick\nstill professed to be slightly skeptical, and met Charity\u2019s\nseverely questioning eye with bland unconsciousness.\nThe colonel killed the fatted calf for Grandison, and\nfor two or three weeks the returned wanderer\u2019s life was\na slave\u2019s dream of pleasure. His fame spread throughout\nthe county, and the colonel gave him a permanent place\namong the house servants, where he could always have\nhim conveniently at hand to relate his adventures to\nadmiring visitors.\n* * * * *\nAbout three weeks after Grandison\u2019s return the\ncolonel\u2019s faith in sable humanity was rudely shaken, and\n103 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nits foundations almost broken up. He came near losing his\nbelief in the fidelity of the negro to his master,\u2014the servile\nvirtue most highly prized and most sedulously cultivated by\nthe colonel and his kind. One Monday morning Grandison\nwas missing. And not only Grandison, but his wife, Betty\nthe maid; his mother, aunt Eunice; his father, uncle Ike;\nhis brothers, Tom and John, and his little sister Elsie, were\nlikewise absent from the plantation; and a hurried search\nand inquiry in the neighborhood resulted in no information\nas to their whereabouts. So much valuable property could\nnot be lost without an effort to recover it, and the wholesale\nnature of the transaction carried consternation to the\nhearts of those whose ledgers were chiefly bound in black.\nExtremely energetic measures were taken by the colonel\nand his friends. The fugitives were traced, and followed\nfrom point to point, on their northward run through Ohio.\nSeveral times the hunters were close upon their heels,\nbut the magnitude of the escaping party begot unusual\nvigilance on the part of those who sympathized with the\nfugitives, and strangely enough, the underground railroad\nseemed to have had its tracks cleared and signals set for\nthis particular train. Once, twice, the colonel thought he\nhad them, but they slipped through his fingers.\nOne last glimpse he caught of his vanishing property,\nas he stood, accompanied by a United States marshal,\non a wharf at a port on the south shore of Lake Erie.\nOn the stern of a small steamboat which was receding\nrapidly from the wharf, with her nose pointing toward\nCanada, there stood a group of familiar dark faces, and\nthe look they cast backward was not one of longing for\nthe fleshpots of Egypt. The colonel saw Grandison point\nhim out to one of the crew of the vessel, who waved his\nhand derisively toward the colonel. The latter shook his\nfist impotently\u2014and the incident was closed.\n(1899)\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. How does Chestnutt select and arrange plot details in this story so\nthat the escape of Grandison and his family catches Colonel Owens,\nas well as the reader, by surprise? What assumptions does the colonel\n104 The Truths of Fiction\nhold that make it possible for him to be duped? Can you go back and\nfind the moment when Grandison began planning his escape?\n2. What is the import of Grandison\u2019s name? In what way does Colonel\nOwens\u2019s identity as a father depend on Grandison and the other\nslaves? In what way does it depend on Dick? Which \u201cson\u201d proves\nto be more worthy, according to Charity Lomax\u2019s standards?\n3. What is the effect of the allusion to the Israelites when the narrator\ntells us that the expression of Grandison and his family as they\nlooked back at the colonel \u201cwas not one of longing for the fleshpots\nof Egypt\u201d?\n4. How can this story\u2019s third-person narrator be characterized? Is he\nor she a character in the story? Does he or she view the events\nwith omniscient knowledge (seeing and knowing all, including\nthe characters\u2019 thoughts and feelings)? Is the perspective one of\nlimited omniscience (seeing and knowing just one character\u2019s\nthoughts and feelings)? Or is the narrator omniscient at all? Does\nhe or she relate only what an observer would know?\n5.3 Writing about Novels\nShort stories and novels often follow the hill-curve narrative shape\nillustrated earlier in this chapter. As you may observe in the above examples,\nshort stories must develop their effect and\/or meaning in a much more limited\nspace than novels. As a result, the plot elements of short stories must be\nchosen and crafted for efficiency, thus producing a narrow effect. A novel, on\nthe other hand, provides room for more fully developed characters, setting\ndetails, and plot, which can include multiple threads following multiple\ncharacters. Whether about a short story or a novel, a literary analysis essay\nthat argues for a particular perspective demands textual evidence, specific\nexamples from the primary text itself employed to illustrate\/prove an\nassertion. Bill\u2019s argument on The Sun Also Rises, mentioned in Chapter 3,\nuses quotes from the novel, as well as summarized and paraphrased passages\nin order to illustrate particular points and, ultimately, to support Bill\u2019s\nargument that \u201cIn The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway presents Jake Barnes\u2019s\nstruggles to overcome the damage incurred during his service as a soldier\nin World War I as powerful evidence of the irreversible destruction of war.\u201d\nTo develop this argument, Bill could have explored Hemingway\u2019s use of\neffective diction, the work\u2019s unique dialogue, the metaphor of Jake\u2019s wound,\nand\/or point of view (Jake\u2019s, first-person) to build the novel\u2019s impression of\nwar\u2019s damage. He chose to examine the novel\u2019s use of metaphor.\n105 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nBill Day\nEnglish 1102\nDoes the Sun Rise? A Study of Metaphors in Ernest\nHemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises\nAlthough Hemingway\u2019s novel The Sun Also Rises\nbegins with an epigraph from the biblical book of\nEcclesiastes that suggests the constantly renewing cycles\nof the earth and of human generations, the author\u2019s use of\nmetaphors in this story raises the question of whether we\nwill always be able to recover from our own destructive\nbehavior. If it is true that humans and the earth are\nresilient and that no force can disrupt the cycle of rebirth\nand regeneration, the novel should leave readers feeling\noptimistic. However, it does not end on a positive note.\nInstead, it ends with confirmation that even though Brett\nAshley likes to imagine a happy life with protagonist Jake\nBarnes, they are too damaged to have one. Jake\u2019s cynical\nresponse to Brett\u2019s fantasy reminds us of this point: \u201cIsn\u2019t it\npretty to think so?\u201d Jake\u2019s difficulty coping with his injury,\nhis tendency to self-medicate with alcohol, his inability to\npray, and his failure to sustain an intimate relationship with\nanother person all exemplify the irreversible destruction\ninflicted by World War I. Specifically through the metaphors\nof Jake\u2019s wound and the tainted Pamplona fiesta, the novel\nconveys the possibility that if we are not careful, we can\ndangerously disrupt the cycle of renewal.\nJake\u2019s service as an American soldier in World War I\nhas left him with an unusual wound: he took a hit to the groin\nand his sexual organs were damaged. Not only does this\nwound affect him physically, preventing him from being\nable to have sex and to reproduce, but it also affects him\npsychologically, robbing him of masculine confidence and\nof the chance for an intimate relationship with the woman\nhe loves, Brett Ashley. Jake\u2019s response to the injury as he\nlooks in the mirror reveals how powerfully the scar affects\nhim: \u201cI looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire\nbeside the bed\u2026.Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it\nwas funny\u201d (38). Although Jake tries to laugh off the injury,\n106 The Truths of Fiction\nhe suffers from the constant effort to cope with it and the\ngeneral effects of his war experience: \u201cI lay awake thinking\nand my mind jumping around. Then I couldn\u2019t keep away\nfrom it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest\nof it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind\nstopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth\nwaves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry\u201d (39). The wound\nis a constant reminder to Jake that his life is different now.\nYet it also serves as a general metaphor for the\npsychological wounds he and all his friends are coping\nwith. Like Jake\u2019s genital scar, his friends\u2019 pain is kept\nwell-covered. They almost never speak of the war. When\nRobert Cohn asks Mike Campbell if he was in the war,\nMike answers, \u201cWas I not?\u201d And then the subject shifts\nto a funny story about Mike\u2019s stealing medals earned by\nsomeone else so Mike could wear them to a formal dinner.\nAlthough he seems fun-loving, ready to laugh and party\nwith his companions, Mike drinks and spends money\nindiscriminately in order to cope with his pain. We see the\ncharacters\u2019 dysfunctional behavior throughout the novel\nas the group constantly drinks and engages in distractions\nto cope with their own psychological wounds. The worst\neffects of these injuries are their inability to find hope\nin anything, even God, and to enjoy close and healthy\nrelationships with each other.\nAnother metaphor employed effectively in the novel to\nsuggest irreversible destruction is the ruined bull fights. Jake\nhas been an aficionado of the bull fights for many years. He\nconsiders them almost sacred. He shares this feeling with\nhis friend Montoya, at whose hotel he stays when he comes\nto Pamplona for the fiesta. \u201cI had stopped at the Montoya\nfor several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It\nwas simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt.\u201d\n(137). Even though Jake\u2019s mind wanders when he goes\nto church now, he has been able to maintain this special\nexperience of the bull fights. The way he describes this\n\u201cart\u201d reveals that he sees something pure in it\u2014a chance\nto confront one\u2019s fears with dignity, courage, and grace and\nthen destroy those fears: \u201cRomero\u2019s bull-fighting gave real\nemotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his\n107 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nmovements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass\nhim close each time\u201d (171). Since the events recur each year\nduring fiesta, there is a sense of renewal associated with it.\nHowever, when Brett initiates Romero into manhood\nthrough a brief sexual affair, it not only compromises\nRomero\u2019s innocence and purity as an artist, but it spoils\nthe experience of fiesta for Jake. Montoya, his fellow\naficionado blames Jake and his friends for not respecting\nRomero and the bull fight, and the loss of this friendship\nhurts Jake. Just before the group leaves town, Jake says,\n\u201cWe had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come\nnear us\u201d (232). Montoya\u2019s previous regard for Jake will\nnot likely be regained, since the aficion, or passion, they\nshared was very rare, and the affair has spoiled their bond.\nLike Jake and his friends\u2019 faith in anything transcending\nordinary mundane life, Jake\u2019s experience of the bull fight\nhas been tainted now by the dysfunctional actions of him\nand the rest of the group. This metaphor suggests that some\nkinds of destruction are permanent.\nAs the novel concludes, the reader wants to believe\nthat Jake will survive and find some kind of happiness. Yet,\nthe metaphors of Jake\u2019s wound and the tainted bull fights\nsuggest that some kinds of damage cannot be undone. The\nnovel implies that, as a result of one of the most destructive\nwars in human history, these characters will simply have\nto learn to live with their injuries and cope with their lost\nhopes. Their hardship serves as a warning that humans\nshould think carefully before waging war against each other.\nWork Cited\nHemingway, Ernest. The Sun Also Rises. Scribner, 1926.\nIn focusing on how a formal element\u2014metaphor\u2014develops the novel\u2019s\nmessage, Bill\u2019s essay employs a formalist perspective. Approaching this\nHemingway novel from a feminist perspective, on the other hand, Katherine\nJones produced the following researched essay. While she depends less\non discussion of the novel\u2019s formal aspects, such as metaphor and point\nof view, she does gather examples directly from the text to support her\nassertions about one fruitful way to interpret Brett Ashley\u2019s character.\n108 The Truths of Fiction\nKatherine Jones\nEnglish 2140\n\u201cThis Novel is About a Lady\u201d: Brett Ashley in The Sun\nAlso Rises\nWhile Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises is told\nfrom the viewpoint of one Jake Barnes, another prominent\nfigure within the novel is Lady Brett Ashley. In fact, in\nHemingway\u2019s original opening for the novel, he had written,\n\u201cThis novel is about a lady. Her name is Lady Ashley\u201d (Qtd.\nin Martin 70). Brett, as she is developed in the novel, has\nbeen painted in different lights, depending on the interpreter,\nranging from a sympathetic view to one of condemnation.\nThe portrait of her that I will attempt to show is one of a\nhuman being, caught between the ideologies of two eras.\nBrett Ashley is a woman living during an age of a\nnew femininity and sexual freedom, during the end of the\nrepressive Victorian era. Reflecting changing behaviors,\nshe wears pants and has her hair cropped, and she is\nsexually uninhibited. Her experience may be analogous to\nthe stereotypical college freshman who grew up in a strict\nhousehold, one where the idea of drinking before twenty-\none is demonized, so the freshman was not educated in\nsafe practice. The newfound freedom is exhilarating, and\nthe freshman is known to binge-drink, not thinking of his\nor her tolerance level and the consequences, such as an\nincapacitating hangover. The sexual promiscuity of Brett,\nand other women of her time period, may be viewed in the\nsame light: after a repressive era, sex is, in a way, \u201cnew\u201d\nand exciting. However, because of the prior taboo of\ndiscussing sex, a sense of responsibility, self-respect, and\nself-care was likely not passed down to Brett. Because\nof this, she, as a \u201cnew woman,\u201d binges on sex. This is not\nnecessarily because she is an emasculating man-eater.\nRather, this is a reflection on her being almost child-like in\nher behavior, being given power without being made aware\nof the responsibility of it. As Martin expresses, for Brett,\nthe need to rebel against the traditional idea of the feminine\noutweighs the practice of responsible sex (67-8, 71).\n109 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nHowever, her existence during such a cultural\ntransition takes a toll on Brett\u2019s psychological well-being.\nIn trying to cope with Robert Cohn\u2019s infatuation with her,\nfor example, she turns to alcohol: As Jake returns a bottle\nof Fundador to the bartender, she stops him. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s have\none more drink of that,\u2019 Brett said. \u2018My nerves are rotten\u2019\u201d\n(Hemingway 186). As stated by Martin, \u201cIn spite of the\nfact that Brett tries to break free of patriarchal control, she\noften vacillates between the extremes of self-abnegation\nand self-indulgence, and her relationships... are filled with\nambivalence, anxiety, and frequently alienation\u201d (69).\nAmong one of her many discussions with Jake where she\nadmits her dissatisfaction and misery, Brett confides in\nhim that \u201cWhen I think of all the hell I put chaps through.\nI\u2019m paying for it all now\u201d (34). Thus, Brett is not without\na sense of guilt. Despite this, she continues with one affair\nafter another, knowing how it has affected the men she has\nbeen and will be with. There must then be other driving\nfactors in her behavior beyond a desire for sexual pleasure.\nLike many people of her generation, in testing out a\nlife free of restrictive and seemingly worn-out Victorian\nideologies, Brett feels disillusionment and a loss of\nagency after World War I, leaving her with a \u201cmoral and\nemotional vacuum\u201d (Spilka 36). She cannot even take\nsolace in religion. When she attempts to pray for her\nyoung lover Romero before his bull fight, she becomes\nuncomfortable in the atmosphere of the chapel: \u201c\u2018Come\non,\u2019 she whispered throatily. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of here. Makes\nme damned nervous\u2019\u201d (Hemingway 212). She attempts to\nfill this void using intimate encounters with men, seeking\na momentary feeling of human connection, but remains\nunwilling to submit herself to anyone long term. This\nis particularly seen in her relationship with Jake, as she\nconstantly uses him as a financial source and emotional\nsupport, all the while knowing that he is tormented by all\nher lovers (Spilka 42-3). Onderdonk points out that, at\ntimes, Brett appears to want a true relationship, such as\nwith Romero, before he attempts to \u201ctame\u201d her (81). Yet,\nas Djos notes, she generally manipulates men, asserts her\ndominance over them, and avoids commitment to them\n110 The Truths of Fiction\n(143, 148). This behavior might be interpreted as a sign\nthat the sexual freedom Brett is trying out inevitably leads\nto an ethical dead end.\nUnlike an imperialistic government, however, Brett\nis a human being with a conscience, giving rise to the\naforementioned guilt. This guilt, coupled with the internal\nvoid common to the Lost Generation, is what drives her\nand her colleagues to seek comfort in a bottle. Often taken\nfor a sign of immorality, alcoholism here signifies quite\nthe opposite. It is Brett\u2019s conscience and her discomfort\nwith the lack of moral direction that drive her to drink.\nDjos presents the following theory, based on real-life\nalcoholics: \u201cThere is a great deal of fear here, fear of self-\nunderstanding, fear of emotional and physical inadequacy,\nand ... fear of each other\u201d (141-2). Because Brett and her\nfriends are travelling an unmapped road, with no signs\npointing to ethical landmarks or spiritual meaning, they\nmust deal with the uncertainty of their situation. The\ncharacters throughout the novel do seem to have shallow\ninteractions and relationships with each other, yet the fact\nthat so much is left unsaid between them is evidence of\nHemingway\u2019s \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d style. For them alcohol\nis a social lubricant, and even a means to survive day by\nday, minute by minute, suggesting that these characters\nare navigating great psychological challenges (Djos 141)\nand must suffer in isolation as they do so. Brett is no\nexception to this experience. Early on in the novel, Brett\nalludes to this despair when she bemoans to Jake, \u201cOh,\ndarling, I\u2019ve been so miserable\u201d (Hemingway 32).\nBrett is far from being a role model or the picture of\nperfection. Yet, she is not a cold-hearted succubus, either.\nShe is a woman attempting to find her place in the wake\nof a war and a gender revolution, surrounded by changing\nideas, gender roles, and cultural standards. Hiding behind\na wall of alcohol abuse, she struggles, as did many women\nof her time, between her libido and desire for freedom\nfrom patriarchy and male ownership, and her sense of\nguilt and discomfort with herself and others. Brett is\nnothing more, or less, than a human being experiencing\nthe tumultuous waves produced by life.\n111 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nWorks Cited\nDjos, Matts. \u201cAlcoholism in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun\nAlso Rises: A Wine and Roses Perspective on the Lost\nGeneration.\u201d 1995.

In fact,\nsome plays have been based on novels, and novels on plays. Yet, whereas\nthe narrator of a novel can spend pages painting a picture of the story\u2019s\ncircumstances for the reader, a play is restricted to the space of the stage\nand the time frame of a couple of hours. What strategies are available to\nthe playwright to ensure that the play successfully conveys its intended\neffects and themes?\nTo provide the story\u2019s setting, a play requires sets. If you\u2019ve ever been\ninvolved with a play, you know that the set can be made up of detailed\nbackdrops, specifically designed props, strategic lighting, and sometimes\neven background noise. A set, along with the characters\u2019 subtle indications\nof the scene, can generate a full setting in the audience\u2019s imagination.\nAnother difference between fiction and drama is that usually a play\u2019s\nplot is primarily forwarded through dialogue and action. Although a novel\u2019s\nnarrator can describe in detail the thoughts and impressions of its characters,\na play\u2019s effects depend much more heavily on what the characters say and\ndo. A play is a performance, a spectacle, rather than words on paper. Some\nplays do include a narrator or a chorus, to introduce the scene or set the tone\nof the play, but the bulk of the production\u2019s effect is generated through the\ndialogue and its visual devices, and since the play\u2019s script dictates what\nthe characters will say and often, through stage direction, its production\nstrategies as well, the script is crucial to a successful performance.\n6.2 A One-Act Play\nAlthough the following script is only that, a script, it does give us a\nplace to start as we investigate drama as a genre. Trifles is a one-act play,\n113 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nwhich is a drama that can usually be performed in an hour or less and in which\nthe entire story is performed in one act as opposed to several. Although a one-\nact play can contain scene changes, this one only employs one scene.\nTrifles\nBy Susan Glaspell\nFirst performed by the Provincetown Players at the\nWharf Theatre, Provincetown, Mass., August 8, 1916.\nGEORGE HENDERSON (County Attorney)\nHENRY PETERS (Sheriff)\nLEWIS HALE, A neighboring farmer\nMRS.

It\nlooked...\n(stops, his face twitches)\n... but Harry, he went up to him, and he said, \u2018No, he\u2019s\ndead all right, and we\u2019d better not touch anything.\u2019 So\nwe went back down stairs. She was still sitting that same\nway. \u2018Has anybody been notified?\u2019 I asked. \u2018No\u2019, says\n117 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nshe unconcerned. \u2018Who did this, Mrs. Wright?\u2019 said\nHarry. He said it business-like\u2014and she stopped pleatin\u2019\nof her apron. \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, she says. \u2018You don\u2019t know?\u2019\nsays Harry. \u2018No\u2019, says she. \u2018Weren\u2019t you sleepin\u2019 in the\nbed with him?\u2019 says Harry. \u2018Yes\u2019, says she, \u2018but I was\non the inside\u2019. \u2018Somebody slipped a rope round his neck\nand strangled him and you didn\u2019t wake up?\u2019 says Harry.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t wake up\u2019, she said after him. We must \u2018a looked\nas if we didn\u2019t see how that could be, for after a minute\nshe said, \u2018I sleep sound\u2019. Harry was going to ask her more\nquestions but I said maybe we ought to let her tell her\nstory first to the coroner, or the sheriff, so Harry went fast\nas he could to Rivers\u2019 place, where there\u2019s a telephone.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nAnd what did Mrs. Wright do when she knew that you\nhad gone for the coroner?\nHALE\nShe moved from that chair to this one over here\n(pointing to a small chair in the corner)\nand just sat there with her hands held together and\nlooking down. I got a feeling that I ought to make some\nconversation, so I said I had come in to see if John\nwanted to put in a telephone, and at that she started to\nlaugh, and then she stopped and looked at me\u2014scared,\n(the COUNTY ATTORNEY, who has had his notebook\nout, makes a note.)\nI dunno, maybe it wasn\u2019t scared. I wouldn\u2019t like to say it\nwas. Soon Harry got back, and then Dr. Lloyd came, and\nyou, Mr. Peters, and so I guess that\u2019s all I know that you\ndon\u2019t.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(looking around.)\nI guess we\u2019ll go upstairs first\u2014and then out to the barn\nand around there,\n(to the SHERIFF.)\nYou\u2019re convinced that there was nothing important\nhere\u2014nothing that would point to any motive.\n118 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nSHERIFF\nNothing here but kitchen things.\n(The COUNTY ATTORNEY, after again looking around\nthe kitchen, opens the door of a cupboard closet. He gets\nup on a chair and looks on a shelf. Pulls his hand away,\nsticky.)\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nHere\u2019s a nice mess.\n(The women draw nearer.)\nMRS. PETERS\n(to the other woman)\nOh, her fruit; it did freeze,\n(to the LAWYER)\nShe worried about that when it turned so cold. She said\nthe fire\u2019d go out and her jars would break.\nSHERIFF\nWell, can you beat the women! Held for murder and\nworryin\u2019 about her preserves.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nI guess before we\u2019re through she may have something\nmore serious than preserves to worry about.\nHALE\nWell, women are used to worrying over trifles.\n(The two women move a little closer together.)\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(with the gallantry of a young politician)\nAnd yet, for all their worries, what would we do without\nthe ladies?\n(the women do not unbend. He goes to the sink, takes\na dipperful of water from the pail and pouring it into\na basin, washes his hands. Starts to wipe them on the\nroller-towel, turns it for a cleaner place)\nDirty towels!\n(kicks his foot against the pans under the sink)\nNot much of a housekeeper, would you say, ladies?\n119 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nMRS. HALE\n(stiffly)\nThere\u2019s a great deal of work to be done on a farm.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nTo be sure. And yet\n(with a little bow to her)\nI know there are some Dickson county farmhouses\nwhich do not have such roller towels.\n(He gives it a pull to expose its length again.)\nMRS. HALE\nThose towels get dirty awful quick. Men\u2019s hands aren\u2019t\nalways as clean as they might be.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nAh, loyal to your sex, I see. But you and Mrs. Wright\nwere neighbors. I suppose you were friends, too.\nMRS. HALE\n(shaking her head)\nI\u2019ve not seen much of her of late years. I\u2019ve not been in\nthis house\u2014it\u2019s more than a year.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nAnd why was that? You didn\u2019t like her?\nMRS. HALE\nI liked her all well enough. Farmers\u2019 wives have their\nhands full, Mr. Henderson. And then\u2014\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nYes\u2014?\nMRS. HALE\n(looking about.)\nIt never seemed a very cheerful place.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nNo\u2014it\u2019s not cheerful. I shouldn\u2019t say she had the home-\nmaking instinct.\n120 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nMRS. HALE\nWell, I don\u2019t know as Wright had, either.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nYou mean that they didn\u2019t get on very well?\nMRS. HALE\nNo, I don\u2019t mean anything. But I don\u2019t think a place\u2019d be\nany cheerfuller for John Wright\u2019s being in it.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nI\u2019d like to talk more of that a little later. I want to get the\nlay of things upstairs now.\n(He goes to the left, where three steps lead to a stair door.)\nSHERIFF\nI suppose anything Mrs. Peters does\u2019ll be all right. She\nwas to take in some clothes for her, you know, and a\nfew little things. We left in such a hurry yesterday.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nYes, but I would like to see what you take, Mrs. Peters, and\nkeep an eye out for anything that might be of use to us.\nMRS. PETERS\nYes, Mr. Henderson.\n(The women listen to the men\u2019s steps on the stairs, then\nlook about the kitchen.)\nMRS. HALE\nI\u2019d hate to have men coming into my kitchen, snooping\naround and criticizing.\n(She arranges the pans under sink which the LAWYER\nhad shoved out of place.)\nMRS. PETERS\nOf course it\u2019s no more than their duty.\nMRS. HALE\nDuty\u2019s all right, but I guess that deputy sheriff that came\nout to make the fire might have got a little of this on.\n(gives the roller towel a pull.)\n121 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nWish I\u2019d thought of that sooner. Seems mean to talk\nabout her for not having things slicked up when she had\nto come away in such a hurry.\nMRS. PETERS\n(who has gone to a small table in the left rear corner of\nthe room, and lifted one end of a towel that covers a pan)\nShe had bread set.\n(Stands still.)\nMRS. HALE\n(eyes fixed on a loaf of bread beside the bread-box,\nwhich is on a low shelf at the other side of the room.\nMoves slowly toward it.)\nShe was going to put this in there,\n(picks up loaf, then abruptly drops it. In a manner of\nreturning to familiar things.)\nIt\u2019s a shame about her fruit. I wonder if it\u2019s all gone.\n(gets up on the chair and looks.)\nI think there\u2019s some here that\u2019s all right, Mrs. Peters.\nYes\u2014here;\n(holding it toward the window.)\nthis is cherries, too.\n(looking again.)\nI declare I believe that\u2019s the only one.\n(gets down, bottle in her hand. Goes to the sink and\nwipes it off on the outside.)\nShe\u2019ll feel awful bad after all her hard work in the hot\nweather. I remember the afternoon I put up my cherries\nlast summer.\n(She puts the bottle on the big kitchen table, center of the\nroom. With a sigh, is about to sit down in the rocking-\nchair. Before she is seated realizes what chair it is; with\na slow look at it, steps back. The chair which she has\ntouched rocks back and forth.)\nMRS. PETERS\nWell, I must get those things from the front room closet,\n(she goes to the door at the right, but after looking into\nthe other room, steps back.)\n122 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nYou coming with me, Mrs. Hale? You could help me\ncarry them.\n(They go in the other room; reappear, MRS. PETERS\ncarrying a dress and skirt, MRS. HALE following with a\npair of shoes.)\nMRS. PETERS\nMy, it\u2019s cold in there.\n(She puts the clothes on the big table, and hurries to the\nstove.)\nMRS. HALE\n(examining the skirt.)\nWright was close. I think maybe that\u2019s why she kept so\nmuch to herself. She didn\u2019t even belong to the Ladies Aid.\nI suppose she felt she couldn\u2019t do her part, and then you\ndon\u2019t enjoy things when you feel shabby. She used to wear\npretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster,\none of the town girls singing in the choir. But that\u2014oh,\nthat was thirty years ago. This all you was to take in?\nMRS. PETERS\nShe said she wanted an apron. Funny thing to want, for\nthere isn\u2019t much to get you dirty in jail, goodness knows.\nBut I suppose just to make her feel more natural. She\nsaid they was in the top drawer in this cupboard. Yes,\nhere. And then her little shawl that always hung behind\nthe door.\n(opens stair door and looks.)\nYes, here it is.\n(Quickly shuts door leading upstairs.)\nMRS. HALE\n(abruptly moving toward her)\nMrs. Peters?\nMRS. PETERS\nYes, Mrs. Hale?\nMRS. HALE\nDo you think she did it?\n123 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nMRS. PETERS\n(in a frightened voice)\nOh, I don\u2019t know.\nMRS. HALE\nWell, I don\u2019t think she did. Asking for an apron and her\nlittle shawl. Worrying about her fruit.\nMRS. PETERS\n(starts to speak, glances up, where footsteps are heard in\nthe room above. In a low voice)\nMr. Peters says it looks bad for her. Mr. Henderson is\nawful sarcastic in a speech and he\u2019ll make fun of her\nsayin\u2019 she didn\u2019t wake up.\nMRS. HALE\nWell, I guess John Wright didn\u2019t wake when they was\nslipping that rope under his neck.\nMRS. PETERS\nNo, it\u2019s strange. It must have been done awful crafty and\nstill. They say it was such a\u2014funny way to kill a man,\nrigging it all up like that.\nMRS. HALE\nThat\u2019s just what Mr. Hale said. There was a gun in the\nhouse. He says that\u2019s what he can\u2019t understand.\nMRS. PETERS\nMr. Henderson said coming out that what was needed for\nthe case was a motive; something to show anger, or\u2014\nsudden feeling.\nMRS. HALE\n(who is standing by the table.)\nWell, I don\u2019t see any signs of anger around here,\n(she puts her hand on the dish towel which lies on the\ntable, stands looking down at table, one half of which is\nclean, the other half messy.)\nIt\u2019s wiped to here,\n(makes a move as if to finish work, then turns and looks\nat loaf of bread outside the breadbox. Drops towel. In\nthat voice of coming back to familiar things.)\n124 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nWonder how they are finding things upstairs. I hope she had\nit a little more red-up up there. You know, it seems kind of\nsneaking. Locking her up in town and then coming out here\nand trying to get her own house to turn against her!\nMRS. PETERS\nBut Mrs. Hale, the law is the law.\nMRS. HALE\nI s\u2019pose \u2018tis,\n(unbuttoning her coat.)\nBetter loosen up your things, Mrs. Peters. You won\u2019t feel\nthem when you go out.\n(MRS. PETERS takes off her fur tippet, goes to hang\nit on hook at back of room, stands looking at the under\npart of the small corner table.)\nMRS. PETERS\nShe was piecing a quilt.\n(She brings the large sewing basket and they look at the\nbright pieces.)\nMRS. HALE\nIt\u2019s log cabin pattern. Pretty, isn\u2019t it? I wonder if she was\ngoin\u2019 to quilt it or just knot it?\n(Footsteps have been heard coming down the stairs. The\nSHERIFF enters followed by HALE and the COUNTY\nATTORNEY.)\nSHERIFF\nThey wonder if she was going to quilt it or just knot it!\n(The men laugh, the women look abashed.)\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(rubbing his hands over the stove)\nFrank\u2019s fire didn\u2019t do much up there, did it? Well, let\u2019s\ngo out to the barn and get that cleared up.\n(The men go outside.)\nMRS. HALE\n(resentfully)\nI don\u2019t know as there\u2019s anything so strange, our takin\u2019 up\n125 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nour time with little things while we\u2019re waiting for them\nto get the evidence.\n(she sits down at the big table smoothing out a block\nwith decision)\nI don\u2019t see as it\u2019s anything to laugh about.\nMRS. PETERS\n(apologetically)\nOf course they\u2019ve got awful important things on their\nminds.\n(Pulls up a chair and joins MRS HALE at the table.)\nMRS. HALE\n(examining another block)\nMrs. Peters, look at this one. Here, this is the one she\nwas working on, and look at the sewing! All the rest of it\nhas been so nice and even. And look at this! It\u2019s all over\nthe place! Why, it looks as if she didn\u2019t know what she\nwas about!\n(After she has said this they look at each other, then start\nto glance back at the door. After an instant MRS. HALE\nhas pulled at a knot and ripped the sewing.)\nMRS. PETERS\nOh, what are you doing, Mrs. Hale?\nMRS. HALE\n(mildly)\nJust pulling out a stitch or two that\u2019s not sewed very good.\n(threading a needle)\nBad sewing always made me fidgety.\nMRS. PETERS\n(nervously)\nI don\u2019t think we ought to touch things.\nMRS. HALE\nI\u2019ll just finish up this end.\n(suddenly stopping and leaning forward)\nMrs. Peters?\n126 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nMRS. PETERS\nYes, Mrs. Hale?\nMRS. HALE\nWhat do you suppose she was so nervous about?\nMRS. PETERS\nOh\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know as she was nervous. I\nsometimes sew awful queer when I\u2019m just tired.\n(MRS. HALE starts to say something, looks at MRS.\nPETERS, then goes on sewing)\nWell I must get these things wrapped up. They may be\nthrough sooner than we think,\n(putting apron and other things together)\nI wonder where I can find a piece of paper, and string.\nMRS. HALE\nIn that cupboard, maybe.\nMRS. PETERS\n(looking in cupboard)\nWhy, here\u2019s a bird-cage,\n(holds it up.)\nDid she have a bird, Mrs. Hale?\nMRS. HALE\nWhy, I don\u2019t know whether she did or not\u2014I\u2019ve not\nbeen here for so long. There was a man around last year\nselling canaries cheap, but I don\u2019t know as she took one;\nmaybe she did. She used to sing real pretty herself.\nMRS. PETERS\n(glancing around.)\nSeems funny to think of a bird here. But she must have\nhad one, or why would she have a cage? I wonder what\nhappened to it.\nMRS. HALE\nI s\u2019pose maybe the cat got it.\nMRS. PETERS\nNo, she didn\u2019t have a cat. She\u2019s got that feeling some\n127 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\npeople have about cats\u2014being afraid of them. My cat\ngot in her room and she was real upset and asked me to\ntake it out.\nMRS. HALE\nMy sister Bessie was like that. Queer, ain\u2019t it?\nMRS. PETERS\n(examining the cage.)\nWhy, look at this door. It\u2019s broke. One hinge is pulled apart.\nMRS. HALE\n(looking too.)\nLooks as if someone must have been rough with it.\nMRS. PETERS\nWhy, yes.\n(She brings the cage forward and puts it on the table.)\nMRS. HALE\nI wish if they\u2019re going to find any evidence they\u2019d be\nabout it. I don\u2019t like this place.\nMRS. PETERS\nBut I\u2019m awful glad you came with me, Mrs. Hale. It\nwould be lonesome for me sitting here alone.\nMRS. HALE\nIt would, wouldn\u2019t it?\n(dropping her sewing)\nBut I tell you what I do wish, Mrs. Peters. I wish I had\ncome over sometimes when she was here. I\u2014\n(looking around the room)\n\u2014wish I had.\nMRS. PETERS\nBut of course you were awful busy, Mrs. Hale\u2014your\nhouse and your children.\nMRS. HALE\nI could\u2019ve come. I stayed away because it weren\u2019t\ncheerful\u2014and that\u2019s why I ought to have come. I\u2014I\u2019ve\n128 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nnever liked this place. Maybe because it\u2019s down in a\nhollow and you don\u2019t see the road. I dunno what it is, but\nit\u2019s a lonesome place and always was. I wish I had come\nover to see Minnie Foster sometimes. I can see now\u2014\n(shakes her head)\nMRS. PETERS\nWell, you mustn\u2019t reproach yourself, Mrs. Hale. Some-\nhow we just don\u2019t see how it is with other folks until\u2014\nsomething comes up.\nMRS. HALE\nNot having children makes less work\u2014but it makes\na quiet house, and Wright out to work all day, and no\ncompany when he did come in. Did you know John\nWright, Mrs. Peters?\nMRS. PETERS\nNot to know him; I\u2019ve seen him in town. They say he\nwas a good man.\nMRS. HALE\nYes\u2014good; he didn\u2019t drink, and kept his word as well as\nmost, I guess, and paid his debts. But he was a hard man,\nMrs. Peters. Just to pass the time of day with him\u2014\n(shivers.)\nLike a raw wind that gets to the bone,\n(pauses, her eye falling on the cage.)\nI should think she would \u2018a wanted a bird. But what do\nyou suppose went with it?\nMRS. PETERS\nI don\u2019t know, unless it got sick and died.\n(She reaches over and swings the broken door, swings it\nagain, both women watch it.)\nMRS. HALE\nYou weren\u2019t raised round here, were you?\n(MRS. PETERS shakes her head.)\nYou didn\u2019t know\u2014her?\n129 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nMRS. PETERS\nNot till they brought her yesterday.\nMRS. HALE\nShe\u2014come to think of it, she was kind of like a bird\nherself\u2014real sweet and pretty, but kind of timid and\u2014\nfluttery. How\u2014she\u2014did\u2014change.\n(silence; then as if struck by a happy thought and\nrelieved to get back to everyday things.)\nTell you what, Mrs. Peters, why don\u2019t you take the quilt\nin with you? It might take up her mind.\nMRS. PETERS\nWhy, I think that\u2019s a real nice idea, Mrs. Hale. There\ncouldn\u2019t possibly be any objection to it, could there?\nNow, just what would I take? I wonder if her patches are\nin here\u2014and her things.\n(They look in the sewing basket.)\nMRS. HALE\nHere\u2019s some red. I expect this has got sewing things in it.\n(brings out a fancy box)\nWhat a pretty box. Looks like something somebody\nwould give you. Maybe her scissors are in here.\n(Opens box. Suddenly puts her hand to her nose)\nWhy\u2014\n(MRS. PETERS bends nearer, then turns her face away)\nThere\u2019s something wrapped up in this piece of silk.\nMRS. PETERS\nWhy, this isn\u2019t her scissors.\nMRS. HALE\n(lifting the silk)\nOh, Mrs. Peters\u2014it\u2019s\u2014\n(MRS. PETERS bends closer.)\nMRS. PETERS\nIt\u2019s the bird.\n130 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nMRS. HALE\n(jumping up)\nBut, Mrs. Peters\u2014look at it! It\u2019s neck! Look at its neck!\nIt\u2019s all\u2014other side to.\nMRS. PETERS\nSomebody\u2014wrung\u2014its\u2014neck.\n(Their eyes meet. A look of growing comprehension,\nof horror. Steps are heard outside. MRS. HALE slips\nbox under quilt pieces, and sinks into her chair. Enter\nSHERIFF and COUNTY ATTORNEY. MRS. PETERS\nrises.)\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(as one turning from serious things to little pleasantries)\nWell ladies, have you decided whether she was going to\nquilt it or knot it?\nMRS. PETERS\nWe think she was going to\u2014knot it.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\nWell, that\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m sure.\n(seeing the birdcage)\nHas the bird flown?\nMRS. HALE\n(putting more quilt pieces over the box)\nWe think the\u2014cat got it.\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(preoccupied)\nIs there a cat?\n(MRS. HALE glances in a quick covert way at MRS.\nPETERS.)\nMRS. PETERS\nWell, not now. They\u2019re superstitious, you know. They\nleave.\n131 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nCOUNTY ATTORNEY\n(to SHERIFF PETERS, continuing an interrupted con-\nversation)\nNo sign at all of anyone having come from the outside.\nTheir own rope. Now let\u2019s go up again and go over it\npiece by piece.\n(they start upstairs)\nIt would have to have been someone who knew just the\u2014\n(MRS. PETERS sits down. The two women sit there not\nlooking at one another, but as if peering into something\nand at the same time holding back. When they talk now\nit is in the manner of feeling their way over strange\nground, as if afraid of what they are saying, but as if they\ncan not help saying it.)\nMRS. HALE\nShe liked the bird. She was going to bury it in that pretty\nbox.\nMRS. PETERS\n(in a whisper)\nWhen I was a girl\u2014my kitten\u2014there was a boy took\na hatchet, and before my eyes\u2014and before I could get\nthere\u2014\n(covers her face an instant)\nIf they hadn\u2019t held me back I would have\u2014\n(catches herself, looks upstairs where steps are heard,\nfalters weakly)\n\u2014hurt him.\nMRS. HALE\n(with a slow look around her)\nI wonder how it would seem never to have had any\nchildren around,\n(pause)\nNo, Wright wouldn\u2019t like the bird\u2014a thing that sang.\nShe used to sing. He killed that, too.\nMRS. PETERS\n(moving uneasily)\nWe don\u2019t know who killed the bird.\n132 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nMRS. HALE\nI knew John Wright.\nMRS. PETERS\nIt was an awful thing was done in this house that night,\nMrs. Hale. Killing a man while he slept, slipping a rope\naround his neck that choked the life out of him.\nMRS. HALE\nHis neck. Choked the life out of him.\n(Her hand goes out and rests on the bird-cage.)\nMRS. PETERS\n(with rising voice)\nWe don\u2019t know who killed him. We don\u2019t know.\nMRS. HALE\n(her own feeling not interrupted)\nIf there\u2019d been years and years of nothing, then a bird to\nsing to you, it would be awful\u2014still, after the bird was still.\nMRS. PETERS\n(something within her speaking.)\nI know what stillness is. When we homesteaded in\nDakota, and my first baby died\u2014after he was two years\nold, and me with no other then\u2014\nMRS. HALE\n(moving.)\nHow soon do you suppose they\u2019ll be through, looking\nfor the evidence?\nMRS. PETERS\nI know what stillness is.\n(pulling herself back.)\nThe law has got to punish crime, Mrs. Hale.\nMRS. HALE\n(not as if answering that.)\nI wish you\u2019d seen Minnie Foster when she wore a white\ndress with blue ribbons and stood up there in the choir\nand sang.\n133 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n(a look around the room.)\nOh, I wish I\u2019d come over here once in a while! That was\na crime! That was a crime! Who\u2019s going to punish that?\nMRS. PETERS\n(looking upstairs.)\nWe mustn\u2019t\u2014take on.\nMRS. HALE\nI might have known she needed help! I know how things\ncan be\u2014for women. I tell you, it\u2019s queer, Mrs. Peters.\nWe live close together and we live far apart. We all go\nthrough the same things\u2014it\u2019s all just a different kind of\nthe same thing,\n(brushes her eyes, noticing the bottle of fruit, reaches out\nfor it.)\nIf I was you, I wouldn\u2019t tell her her fruit was gone. Tell her\nit ain\u2019t. Tell her it\u2019s all right. Take this in to prove it to her.\nShe\u2014she may never know whether it was broke or not.\nMRS. PETERS\n(takes the bottle, looks about for something to wrap it in;\ntakes petticoat from the clothes brought from the other\nroom, very nervously begins winding this around the\nbottle. In a false voice.)\nMy, it\u2019s a good thing the men couldn\u2019t hear us. Wouldn\u2019t\nthey just laugh! Getting all stirred up over a little thing\nlike a\u2014dead canary. As if that could have anything to do\nwith\u2014with\u2014wouldn\u2019t they laugh!\n(The men are heard coming down stairs.)\nMRS.

Discuss what sort of backdrop, props, and costumes would be\nrequired to perform this play. How much of this detail is dictated\nby the stage directions and how much of it is left for the director\nto create?\n2. How are the characters revealed? Which lines of dialogue are\nespecially tell-tale regarding certain characters\u2019 values and\npersonalities?\n3. How does the play develop the audience\u2019s impression of Mrs.\nWright, though she never appears in the play?\n136 All the World\u2019s a Stage\n4. In light of the play\u2019s themes, what does the bird cage symbolize?\nHow does that symbol develop our impression of Mr. and Mrs.\nWright?\n5. How does the metaphor of the quilt serve to develop the theme of\nwomen\u2019s undervalued work?\n6. Consider the order and pace whereby clues are revealed to the\naudience. How does the plot unfold to generate suspense and\ninterest for the audience?\nIn Trifles, Glaspell employs some round characters and some flat, or\nstock, characters. Round, complex characters, like Mrs. Wright, Mrs. Hale,\nand Mrs. Peters, reflect the complicated personalities and experiences\nthat most of us can identify with. When Mrs. Peters seems torn between\nfollowing the wishes of her husband, who represents the law, and showing\nsympathy with Mrs. Wright, we understand her conflict. Most of us have\nencountered similar conflicts in our daily lives. However, we tend to\ndislike Mr. Henderson, partly because he insults Mrs. Wright, but also,\nnotably, because he is a flat character. He does not reveal the capacity or\nthe habit of complex thought, but rather reacts to his surroundings based\non his stereotype-based assumptions. Since the male characters represent\ndominant male society, including familiar patriarchs (Mr. Wright is the\nauthority in his house), a society in which women have not yet been\ngranted the right to vote, and a legal system that does not recognize women\nas full citizens, they are sustained as flat. While it may seem that the use\nof flat characters would yield a weak play, it is important to consider why\nwriters use flat characters at all. Since these characters carry with them\na ready-made impression, less dialogue has to be devoted to developing\nthem, thereby creating more dialogue-space for other important characters\nor ideas. In this short play, most of the script focuses on the dialogue and\nactions of Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, allowing Glaspell to develop the\ntheme successfully.\n6.3 Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest\nIn a longer play, of several acts, a playwright has more room for\ndevelopment. Like the novel relative to the short story, a longer play can\nelaborate on the central theme and can even develop several plot and theme\nthreads. Consider William Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest and the various\nstorylines he develops in this play.\n137 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nCHARACTERS:\nPROSPERO, former Duke of Milan; father of Miranda\nMIRANDA: Prospero\u2019s young daughter\nIRIS, JUNO, CERES, Nymphs, Reapers: Spirits\nTRINCULO, a jester\nSEBASTIAN, Alonso\u2019s brother\nSTEPHANO, a drunken butler\nGONZALO, an old and honest lord\nANTONIO, Prospero\u2019s brother\nARIEL, an airy spirit, servant to Prospero\nADRIAN and FRANCISCO, noblemen; companions of\nAlonzo\nALONSO, king of Naples; father of Ferdinand\nFERDINAND, son and heir of Alonso\nCALIBAN, Prospero\u2019s servant, savage and deformed;\nson of Sycorax\nMaster of a Ship, Boatswains, Mariners\nSETTING: A ship at sea during a terrible storm; later,\na Mediterranean island to which Prospero has been\nbanished with Miranda since she was a young child and\nwhere the ship\u2019s travelers come ashore\nACT I\nSCENE I.

Before PROSPERO\u2019S cell.\nEnter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL\nPROSPERO\nNow does my project gather to a head: 1900\nMy charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time\nGoes upright with his carriage. How\u2019s the day?\nARIEL\nOn the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\nYou said our work should cease.\nPROSPERO\nI did say so,\nWhen first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\nHow fares the king and\u2019s followers?\nARIEL\nConfined together\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir, 1910\nIn the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;\nThey cannot budge till your release. The king,\nHis brother and yours, abide all three distracted\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\nHim that you term\u2019d, sir, \u2018The good old lord Gonzalo;\u2019\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter\u2019s drops\nFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works \u2018em\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\nWould become tender. 1920\n215 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nPROSPERO\nDost thou think so, spirit?\nARIEL\nMine would, sir, were I human.\nPROSPERO\nAnd mine shall.\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply,\nPassion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,\nYet with my nobler reason \u2018gaitist my fury\nDo I take part: the rarer action is 1930\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:\nMy charms I\u2019ll break, their senses I\u2019ll restore,\nAnd they shall be themselves.\nARIEL\nI\u2019ll fetch them, sir.\nExit\nPROSPERO\nYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that 1940\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\nWeak masters though ye be, I have bedimm\u2019d\nThe noontide sun, call\u2019d forth the mutinous winds,\nAnd \u2018twixt the green sea and the azured vault\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\nHave I given fire and rifted Jove\u2019s stout oak\nWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontory 1950\n216 All the World\u2019s a Stage\nHave I made shake and by the spurs pluck\u2019d up\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\nHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let \u2018em forth\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic\nI here abjure, and, when I have required\nSome heavenly music, which even now I do,\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\nThis airy charm is for, I\u2019ll break my staff,\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound 1960\nI\u2019ll drown my book.\nSolemn music\nRe-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic\ngesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and\nANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and\nFRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO\nhad made,and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO\nobserving, speaks:\nA solemn air and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,\nNow useless, boil\u2019d within thy skull! There stand,\nFor you are spell-stopp\u2019d.\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\nMine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night, 1970\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\nTo him you follow\u2019st! I will pay thy graces\nHome both in word and deed. Most cruelly\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\nThou art pinch\u2019d fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\nYou, brother mine, that entertain\u2019d ambition, 1980\nExpell\u2019d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\nWould here have kill\u2019d your king; I do forgive thee,\nUnnatural though thou art.

Unlike Trifles, this play is written in verse. Most lines tend to\ncontain 10-11 syllables and some can be read as blank verse,\nunrhymed iambic pentameter. Why would Shakespeare have\nwritten it this way in his day? What is the effect of this use of\nverse in the characters\u2019 lines?\n2. Gonzalo comments that he believes the boatswain\u2019s fate is to\nbe hanged rather than drowned. What point is he making? What\nlarger notion of fate in the play is introduced in this passage? How\ndoes Prospero\u2019s magic affect our notion of fate?\n3. What do we learn of Miranda\u2019s character in her first speech?\n4. What does Prospero reveal to Miranda in their first exchange?\n5. In The Tempest, how does Shakespeare develop the theme of\nambition and its power to corrupt?\n6. What evidence does the play present of Prospero\u2019s magical powers?\n7. Why is Ariel loyal to Prospero?\n8. How does Prospero describe Caliban, son of Sycorax?\n9. How does Miranda feel about Caliban? Why?\n10. How does Caliban feel about Prospero? Why?\n11. Is Prospero good?\n12. How does Shakespeare use \u201casides\u201d to convey to the audience\ncharacter attitudes and information that some characters are not\nprivy to?\n13. Why does Prospero treat Ferdinand so roughly in the beginning?\n14. What is the effect of metaphors and similes in the play?\n15. How does Gonzalo describe the perfect commonwealth?\n16. Find a passage in the dialogue of Act I, Scene 2 that reveals\nAntonio\u2019s character.\n17. What is the effect of the play-within-a-play, the masque put on by\nJuno, Ceres, and Iris for Miranda and Ferdinand?\n229 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n18. How does Prospero\u2019s epilogue further develop the audience\u2019s\nacknowledgement of the play\u2019s being a play? In what way has the\naudience\u2019s power kept Prospero \u201cconfined\u201d to the island?\n19. How is the script a kind of fate for the characters?\n20. As traditional to Greek drama, tragedies end in death, comedies\nin marriage. As a comedy, how does this play resolve its conflicts\nin the final events, including the impending marriage of Miranda\nand Ferdinand?\nShakespeare\u2019s influence on Western culture is undeniable. Not only is\nhis work a touchstone for Western literature in general, but many of his\ncharacters have both drawn from and shaped important literary archetypes\n(figures that appear over and over again in literature for their familiar roles\nin general human dynamics). The Tempest has certainly made its mark in\nthis regard, establishing Prospero and Caliban as two important widely-\nrecognized archetypes. Prospero is the magician: a powerful figure able\nto orchestrate events and control outcomes, but held accountable on some\nlevel for his decisions in doing so. Caliban is the savage: tragic, malformed,\nand yet sensitive to the injustice of his circumstances. Further, this play\u2019s\narchetypal influence is evidenced by the many versions of it that have\nbeen produced\u2014in theatre, film, and fiction\u2014since Shakespeare\u2019s time.\nFor example, Paul Mazursky\u2019s 1982 film Tempest, set in the twentieth\ncentury yet based on Shakespeare\u2019s play, stars John Cassavetes as the self-\nexiled architect Philip Dimitrius (Prospero) and Molly Ringwald as his\nteenaged daughter Miranda. In two other interesting retellings of the story,\nJulie Taymor\u2019s 2010 film The Tempest stars Helen Mirren as Prospera, and\nGloria Naylor\u2019s 1988 novel Mama Day employs the storm as plot-vehicle\nas well as featuring Mama Day herself as a black female Prospero-type\nfigure.\nThe themes of The Tempest, then, are considered by many to be\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in their connection to common human experiences such\nas feeling relegated to an unjustly-restricted and inferior status (as\nCaliban is) and deciding whether use of one\u2019s power to alter others\u2019\nlives is justified or not (like Prospero). Dramatic productions have great\npotential to move an audience, and both Trifles and The Tempest offer\nexamples of how a play might do so. Through effective use of dramatic\nstrategies and powerfully written lines, a play can tap into the most basic\nand profound aspects of human experience.\n230 7\nCreative Nonfiction,\nthe Fourth Genre\n7.1 Creative Nonfiction as a Genre\nCreative nonfiction seems to have existed for as long as poetry,\nfiction, and drama have, but only in the last forty years or so has the term\nbecome common as a label for creative, factual prose. The length is not\na factor in characterizing this genre: Such prose can take the form of an\nessay or a book. For this chapter\u2019s discussion, we will focus on the essay,\nsince not only will this shorter version of the form allow us to examine\nmultiple examples for a better understanding of the genre, but also, you\nmay have written creative nonfiction essays yourself. Looking carefully at\nthe strategies exhibited by some successful essay writers will give us new\nideas for achieving goals in our own writing.\nFirst, let\u2019s do what we can to more clearly define the creative nonfiction\nessay. What is the difference between this kind of essay and a\u2026well, what\nshall we call essays outside this category? Non-creative nonfiction essays?\nThis title does not work very well for our purposes; the distinction is a\nmuddy one, since even a researched academic essay can exhibit creativity.\nHowever, we can make some general observations about the differences\nbetween creative nonfiction and works that do not fit neatly into this genre:\nAlthough written in prose form (prose is writing not visually broken into\ndistinct lines as poetry is), the creative nonfiction essay often strives for a\npoetic effect, employing a kind of compressed, distilled language so that\nmost words carry more meaning than their simple denotation (or literal\nmeaning). Generally, this kind of essay is not heavy with researched\ninformation or formal argument; its priority, instead, is to generate a\npowerful emotional and aesthetic effect (aesthetic referring to artistic\nand\/or beautiful qualities).\n231 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s 1942 \u201cThe Death of the Moth\u201d is an illuminating\nexample of such a work. While the essay does not present a stated argument\nand proceed to offer evidence in the same way conventional academic\nargument would, it does strive to persuade. Consider this piece carefully\nat http:\/\/gutenberg.net.au\/ebooks12\/1203811h.html#ch-02 and see if you\ncan detect the theme that Woolf is developing.\nThe title of Woolf\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Death of the Moth,\u201d offers us, from\nthe start, the knowledge of the work\u2019s theme of death. Woolf\u2019s choice of\ntone for an essay on this topic is, perhaps, what distinguishes it from the\nmany other literary works on the subject. The attitude is not one of tragedy,\nhorror, or indignation, as we might expect. Rather, through imagery and\ndiction, Woolf generates a tone of wistfulness. By carefully crafting the\nreader\u2019s experience of the moth\u2019s death, through the author\u2019s own first\nperson point of view, she reminds us of our own human struggle against\ndeath, which is both heroic and inevitable.\nWhile this piece is not a poem, what aspects of it are poetic? Consider\nthe imagery employed to suggest the season of death, for all of nature.\nThe writer describes her experience sitting at her desk next to the window,\nobserving the signs of autumn: the plow \u201cscoring the field\u201d where the\ncrop (or \u201cshare\u201d) has already been harvested. Although the scene begins\nin morning\u2014characterized by energetic exertions of nature, including the\nrooks, rising and settling into the trees again and again with a great deal\nof noise, \u201cas though to be thrown into the air and settle slowly down upon\nthe tree tops were a tremendously exciting experience\u201d\u2014the day shifts,\nas the essay progresses, to afternoon, the birds having left the trees of this\nfield for some other place. Like the moth, the day and the year are waning.\nThe energy that each began with is now diminishing, as is the case for all\nliving things.\nThe writer is impressed with the moth\u2019s valiant struggle against its\nimpending death because she is also aware of its inevitable doom: \u201c[T]\nhere was something marvellous as well as pathetic about him.\u201d As is\ncommon in poetry, Woolf\u2019s diction not only suggests her attitude toward\nthe subject, but also exhibits a lyrical quality that enhances the work\u2019s\neffect: She introduces words whose meanings are associated with youth\nand energy, as well as sounding strong with the \u201cvigorous\u201d consonants of\n\u201cg,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d \u201cz,\u201d and \u201ct\u201d\u2014words such as \u201cvigour,\u201d \u201cclamour,\u201d and \u201czest.\u201d Yet,\nthe author counters this positive tone with other words that suggest, both\nin meaning and in their softer sounds, the vulnerability of living things:\n\u201cthin,\u201d \u201cfrail,\u201d \u201cdiminutive,\u201d and \u201cfutile.\u201d In a third category of diction,\nwith words of compliment\u2014\u201dextraordinary\u201d and \u201cuncomplainingly\u201d\u2014\n232 Creative Nonfiction, the Fourth Genre\nWoolf acknowledges the moth\u2019s admirable fight. In addition to indicating\nthe moth\u2019s heroism, the very length of these words seems to model the\nmoth\u2019s attempts to drag out its last moments of life.\nWhat impression does the essay, as a whole, convey? The writer\nacknowledges that watching even such a small creature as the moth struggle\nagainst death, she sympathizes with the moth and not with the \u201cpower of\nsuch magnitude\u201d that carries on outside the window\u2014that of time and\ninevitable change, for this power is ultimately her own \u201cenemy\u201d as well. In\nher last line, \u201cO yes, he seemed to say, death is stronger than I am,\u201d what\nlesson has she internalized regarding herself, a human being who at first\nobserved the autumn day with no immediate sense of her own mortality?\n7.2 Models of Creative Nonfiction\nNow that we have analyzed a creative nonfiction essay together, try\nyour own hand at this process. With each of the following essays, I have\nincluded Questions for Consideration to help guide you to some of the key\nelements that generate particular effects and meanings. Once you have\nobserved how these works make meaning, you might choose one on which\nto formulate a perspective and then compose a written argument making a\ncase for that perspective.\nLet\u2019s begin with \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d by Joan Didion, 1967, at\nhttp:\/\/juliaallison.com\/goodbye-to-all-that-by-joan-didion\/.\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. How does Didion employ sensory detail to draw us into her\nexperience of New York City?\n2. Of her images of New York, which are the most striking to you?\nWhat gives these images their impact?\n3. What general impression of New York is created by the essay?\n4. How does Didion use catalogs (or lists) to help generate a\npanoramic impression of the city in her early years there?\n5. How does the writer experience her memories of New York City\nnow? How does she use the notion of \u201cfilm dissolve\u201d to convey\nthis perspective?\n6. Why did her experience of the city change when she was twenty-\neight?\n7. What do you think is the general message of this essay?\n233 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nWhile Didion\u2019s \u201cGoodbye to All That\u201d is a personal essay, offering\na glimpse into Didion\u2019s own life as a vehicle for more general insight\ninto human experience, Richard P. Feynman\u2019s work \u201cThe Value of\nScience\u201d focuses on the subject of science in a context more social than\npersonal. In fact, it was originally offered as a lecture in 1955 for the\nNational Academy of Sciences. As you read the work in its written form at\nhttp:\/\/calteches.library.caltech.edu\/40\/2\/Science.htm, consider how it\nmight have been shaped by its original intent for lecture delivery to an\naudience composed primarily of scientists.\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. In the beginning of the lecture, Feynman says that in talking not\nabout scientific subjects but rather about values, he is \u201cas dumb\nas the next guy.\u201d How does this notion fit into his later argument\nthat one important value of science is that it teaches us to live\nwith uncertainty?\n2. How does Feynman differentiate between scientific knowledge\nand moral choice? How does he make his case for the value of\nthe key to heaven and hell?\n3. The second value of science, according to Feynman, is that it\nstimulates a unique imaginative process, one that causes those\nwho get turned onto the scientific perspective to \u201cturn over each\nnew stone.\u201d How does his poem exemplify this unique kind of\nimagining? What is the meaning of line 17, \u201cA mite makes the\nsea roar\u201d?\n4. How does Feynman use the metaphor of playing music to explain\nwhy perhaps more people are not \u201cinspired by our present picture\nof the universe\u201d?\n5. What is your personal response to his reminder that our brain,\nwhich we equate with our mind (on which we base our notion\nof our individuality) is not made of the same atoms it was made\nof two weeks ago? Does this point affect you the way Feynman\ndesired it to? Why or why not?\n6. What, according to Feynman, is the importance of our learning to\nlive in a state of uncertainty? How does science help foster this\nworld view?\n234 Creative Nonfiction, the Fourth Genre\nGeorge Orwell, author of the novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-\nFour, among many other works, brings us back to the personal essay in\nhis 1946 \u201cWhy I Write.\u201d This essay not only offers a useful example of\neffective creative nonfiction, but it also gives us a glimpse into the subject\nof writing itself, raising questions about our own reasons for writing. You\ncan read it at http:\/\/gutenberg.net.au\/ebooks03\/0300011h.html#part47.\nQuestions for Consideration:\n1. What does Orwell mean when he says that in his early resistance\nto becoming a writer, he was \u201coutraging my true nature\u201d? Can you\nidentify with this sentiment in light of your own \u201cnatural\u201d tendencies?\n2. What kind of \u201cliterary activities\u201d did Orwell engage in even when\nhe was not purposefully developing his aspirations of becoming a\nwriter? How then does his attitude contrast his perspective on that\nperiod as he looks back now, writing this essay?\n3. What is the \u201cjoy of mere words\u201d he describes? Can you give\nexamples of words that affect you this way?\n4. Consider the \u201cfour great motives for writing\u201d listed by Orwell.\nAccording to him, how might these motives work against one\nanother?\n5. How does Orwell use his poem to explain why he eventually\nbecame political even though it was not in his \u201cnature\u201d to do so?\n6. What is the role of aestheticism for Orwell even in writing a book\nwith a political theme?\n7. What does he mean when he says that \u201cevery book is a failure\u201d?\n8. If you were to write a similar essay tracing your development into\na _____ major, what details of your life would you focus on? If\nthis major, and the profession it leads to, does not always fit well\nwith your character and habits, where do the discrepancies lie?\n9. If you were to write an essay about your development as a writer, how\nwould your story be similar to Orwell\u2019s? How would it be different?\nThe essays presented in this chapter reveal the potential power of\ncreative nonfiction. Exhibiting strong differences from one another, these\npieces illuminate the ways that various literary strategies can be used to\ngenerate particular effects. You may end up writing your own essay that\nprovides a literary analysis of one of these works, giving you a chance\n235 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nto practice composing argument based on textual evidence. Whether you\nwrite about these essays or not, these works model strategies available to\nyou as a writer.\nSince the length of this chapter is limited by the constraints of space,\nI have included a brief list, below, of additional essays that might be of\ninterest to you. These should be accessible, free of charge, on the internet.\nLike the other essays whose links are included in this chapter, these works\nprovide both fascinating subjects for analysis and useful models for your\nown writing.\nAnzaldua, Gloria. \u201cHow to Tame a Wild Tongue.\u201d Borderlands \/ La\nFrontera, 2nd ed., Aunt Lute Books, 1987. https:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/iirp\/\ndocuments\/Anzaldua%201999.pdf.

It is important to note that the process of\nwriting discussed in this chapter can be used in writing for any discipline.\nAs stated in this book\u2019s Introduction, literature provides a fruitful context\nfor development of writing skills, but the skills themselves are transferable\ninto a multitude of communication situations.\n8.1 Literary Analysis Arguments\nAnalysis means to break something down in order to better understand\nhow it works. To analyze a literary work is to pull it apart and look at\nits discrete components to see how those components contribute to the\nmeaning and\/or effect of the whole. Thus, a literary analysis argument\nconsiders what has been learned in analyzing a work (What do the parts\nlook like and how do they function?) and forwards a particular perspective\non their contribution to the whole (In light of the author\u2019s use of diction,\nfor example, what meaning does the novel, as a whole, yield?).\nConsider, once again, the literary analysis arguments presented in this\nbook so far:\nMarion Velis (Chapter 2): \u201cAt first glance, Theodore\nRoethke\u2019s poem \u2018My Papa\u2019s Waltz\u2019 may seem like a\npoem about a boy\u2019s fear of his controlling, abusive,\nalcoholic father. But the poem goes much deeper than\nthat. Roethke uses specific rhythm, word choice, and\n237 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\na controlling metaphor to give the poem a reminiscent\ntone that looks back on the father in love.\u201d\nBill Day (Chapter 5): \u201cThrough the metaphors of Jake\u2019s\nwound and the tainted Pamplona fiesta, the novel [The\nSun Also Rises] conveys the possibility that we can\ndangerously disrupt the cycle of renewal.\u201d\nKatherine Jones (Chapter 5): \u201cBrett, as she is developed\nin the novel [The Sun Also Rises], has been painted in\ndifferent lights, depending on the interpreter, ranging from\na sympathetic view to one of condemnation. The portrait\nof her that I will attempt to show is one of a human being,\ncaught between the ideologies of two eras.\u201d\nEach of these essays engages in analysis of the text in question,\npointing to and considering plot events, images, character traits, dialogue,\nand other components of the work to understand the meaning of the text as\na whole. Although in her thesis, Katherine does not list the \u201cparts\u201d that her\npaper investigates, she goes on to focus on Brett\u2019s specific behaviors and\nexpressions that support the essay\u2019s interpretation of The Sun Also Rises.\n8.2 Writing as a Process: Breaking It Down\nFor many students, approaching a writing assignment can be\noverwhelming. They know that there are many tasks that must be completed,\nsuch as gathering information about the topic, forming a perspective on it,\nbrainstorming ideas to be included in the paper, organizing those ideas,\nintegrating the evidence, and articulating the argument with clarity and\neloquence, not to mention accommodating the assigned format guidelines.\nThis job is not unlike building a house. You look at the empty lot and\nimagine the beautiful house you want to build, but you know that the tasks\nnecessary to get from nothing to the final product are many and varied.\nThe prospect can certainly be overwhelming. Yet, any builder understands\nthat the best approach to a big job like this one is breaking it down into a\nmethodical and carefully scheduled process. In response to a challenging\nwriting assignment, you are encouraged to do the same.\nLet\u2019s consider the writing assignment Bill originally received from his\nEnglish 1102 instructor:\nFor this essay, write a literary analysis of Ernest\nHemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises using a formalist\n238 The Literary Analysis Essay\napproach. The essay should forward a specific perspective\non the novel (articulated in your thesis), and the evidence\nfor your argument should come from the novel itself. The\nessay should be three-four pages in length.\nDue date: February 3.\nBill remembers that in his high school senior English class, he once\nprocrastinated on a major paper assignment and ended up writing the\nwhole essay in one night. The result was a \u201cD\u201d on the paper and a tendency\nto experience writer\u2019s block, which still plagued him all during his first\nsemester of college. But he has one tool this second semester that he has not\nhad before: his instructor\u2019s handout on \u201cWriting as a Process.\u201d The literary\nanalysis essay for this class is not due for three weeks, but he decides to\nreview the handout now as a first step to avoiding writer\u2019s block and another\nlow grade. Here is the advice recommended in his instructor\u2019s handout:\n1. Investigate the general topic; in this case, read the novel and make\nnotes and annotations as you go.\n2. Brainstorm points of interest regarding what you\u2019ve learned so\nfar. As you brainstorm, do not try to write in full sentences or to\norganize your thoughts. Instead, simply write down everything that\ncomes to mind.\n3. Read back over your notes and decide on a focus. Considering\nthis focus, decide what you think about this topic, based on your\nobservations so far. Form a perspective on the topic.\n4. Again considering your brainstorming notes, determine a very\ngeneral organization for the major points on this topic. Once\nyou have completed this basic outline, categorize all the leftover\n\u201csmaller\u201d items under the most relevant major points. If some\nitems on your brainstorming page don\u2019t seem relevant, mark\nthrough them. Keep only the items that fit your paper\u2019s focus.\n5. With the paper topic and its major supporting points in mind,\nwrite a working thesis. This thesis is not set in stone yet, but it\nwill help you stay on track as you move forward.\n6. Go back to your materials on the general topic now\u2014in this\ncase, comb through your notes on the novel, annotations, and\nhighlighted passages. Would any of these words, ideas, and\/\nor passages make effective evidence to develop one or more\nof your major points? As you find fruitful items, jot down a\nquote, summary, or paraphrase of each item, along with the page\nnumber of the novel where you found it. Make a note to yourself\nindicating which major point each item supports.\n239 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n7. Revise your paper outline now to include not only the working\nthesis and the major points, but also the pieces of evidence that will\ngo under each major point.\n8. Begin drafting the paper. If the introduction does not come quickly,\nskip it. Keep your working thesis in mind and write out the major\nsections of your paper which support that thesis.\n9. Now go back to the introduction. Consider your audience. How\nare you trying to alter your audience\u2019s perspective on the novel\nwith this paper? How can you use the introduction to (a) draw your\nreader\u2019s interest to your new way of looking at the novel and (b)\nlay the groundwork for your argument? The introduction should\naccomplish these goals. Write your conclusion with similar goals\nin mind. This is your last chance to persuade your reader that your\nperspective is convincing and important. How can you leave your\nreader with a strong and lasting impression?\n10. Once you have drafted the entire essay, start at the beginning\nand revise. Pay particular attention to coherence during this\nphase. In a coherent paper, everything in the essay promotes its\ncentral purpose. During this phase, you may want to clarify and\nstrengthen the relationships among ideas with transition words\nand explanations. A coherent paper exhibits a certain tightness\nthat produces the desired impact on the reader. Imagine that\nyou are reading the paper aloud to an actual audience of fellow\nstudents who have their own values and opinions. How can\nyou shape the prose to (1) keep their attention, (2) clearly and\npersuasively convey your case, and (3) convince these readers\nthat your perspective is a valuable one?\n11. Final revision phase: Read through the essay as many times as you\nneed to, checking grammar and spelling and giving the language\nits final polish. Read it aloud again, this time slowly, to be sure that\nthe essay sounds as eloquent as you intended for it to.\n12. Be sure that the essay follows the format guidelines and is ready\nfor submission.\nIn class, after handing out this sheet, Bill\u2019s instructor told the students\nto take out their datebooks. She told the students to consult their schedules\nand assign \u201cdummy\u201d dates for each item on the task list. Here is how Bill\ndivided up his time for addressing the tasks necessary for completing the\npaper:\n240 The Literary Analysis Essay\n241\n81\n71\n61\n51\n41\n31\n21\nyraunaJ\nytinretarF\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\nyadkrow\ndna\n,hsilgnE\nbal\ndna\ndna\n,hsilgnE\ndna\n,hsilgnE\ndna\ndaeR\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\ndna\ndaeR\nlevon\netatonna\nrof\nmrotsniarB\nlevon\netatonna\ndna\ndaeR\n).srh\n2(\ndna\ndaeR\n;).rh\n1(\n1\nyasse\n).srh\n2(\nlevon\netatonna\nlevon\netatonna\nygoloib\ndaeR\ndna\nno\nediceD\n).srh\n2(\n).srh\n2(\nygoloib\nweiveR\nretpahc\nnwod\netirw\nseton\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\nsucof\ns\u2019repap\nytinretarF\n).nim\n03(\ngniteem\nni\nretpahc\ndaeR\nyrotsih\n52\n42\n32\n22\n12\n02\n91\ns\u2019ynnarG\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\na\nekaM\nytrap\nyadhtrib\ndna\n,hsilgnE\nbal\ndna\ndna\n,hsilgnE\ndna\n,hsilgnE\nevitatnet\nseton\nweiveR\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nfo\neniltuo\nyasse\nesiveR\nlevon\ndna\ndna\nrojam\nemoh\noG\not\neniltuo\n1\neunitnoC\ntseb\nrof\nflesti\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\ngnitroppus\ns\u2019ynnarG\nrof\ncfiiceps\nedulcni\ngnidnfi\n\/ecnedive\na\nesopmoC\nyasse\nrof\nstniop\nyadhtrib\nsmeti\necnedive\nrof\necnedive\n2(\nselpmaxe\nsiseht\ngnikrow\n).rh\n1(\n1\n).rh\n1(\n).srh\n2(\n1\nyasse\n).srh\n03(\n1\nyasse\nrof\nyrotsih\nweiveR\nygoloib\nweiveR\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\nygoloib\ndaeR\n).nim\nseton\nseton\nretpahc\nytinretarF\ngniteem Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\n242\n1\nyraurbeF\n13\n03\n92\n82\n72\n62\nhtam\nno\nkroW\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\n3(\n1\nyasse\ntfarD\ntcejorp\npuorg\ndna\n,hsilgnE\nbal\ndna\ndna\n,hsilgnE\ndna\n,hsilgnE\n).srh\nrof\nydutS\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nbal\ntimbuS\nmaxe\nyrotsih\nyrotsih\nweiveR\nmaxe\nhtaM\ntroper\nmaxe\nyrotsiH\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\nseton\nygoloib\netirW\nesiveR\nhtam\nrof\nydutS\netirW\ntroper\nbal\nytinummoC\nhtam\nrof\nydutS\ntset\nnoitcudortni\necivres\ntset\n).srh\n2(\n1\nyasse\nytinretarF\nnoisulcnoc\ndna\nygoloib\nweiveR\ngniteem\n1(\n1\nyasse\nrof\nseton\n).rh\n1\nyasse\nesiveR\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\n).srh\n2(\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\nhtam\nno\nkroW\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\nygoloib\ndnettA\n,htam\ndnettA\n,tamroF\ntcejorp\npuorg\ndna\n,hsilgnE\nbal\ndna\ndna\n,hsilgnE\ndna\n,hsilgnE\n,daerfoorp\ngnikrow\nnigeB\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\nssalc\nyrotsih\ndna\nhsilop\ndna\nygoloib\nweiveR\n2\nyassE\nno\n2(\n1\nyasse\ntnirp\nseton\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\n1\nyasse\ntimbuS\nygoloib\ndaeR\n).srh\nretpahc\nkrowemoh\nhtaM\nyrotsih\nweiveR\nytinretarF\nseton\ngniteem The Literary Analysis Essay\nTo some students, the idea of working for an entire three weeks on a\nthree to four page essay might seem extreme. Yet, anyone who writes for\na living will attest that all of these tasks are necessary for a high quality\nproduct. Professional writers may allocate their time a bit differently,\nperhaps working for eight or nine hours in one day on a single project,\nand undoubtedly they gain speed over time at completing each stage of\nthe process. Even so, they understand that for a product with the desired\nimpact, one must spend time planning and crafting the piece. Since\nstudents are usually taking other classes in addition to English, and must\noften hold down jobs and fulfill personal obligations, Bill\u2019s Essay 1 plan\nis much more likely to work out than a twenty-hour writing marathon\nbeginning two days before the paper\u2019s due-date. Notice that Bill did not\nschedule any Essay 1 tasks for January 18, 24-25, 27-28, and February 1.\nLooking ahead in his date book, he realized that he has fraternity events\non January 18 and 27, and he wants to save time on the other dates to join\nhis family for his grandmother\u2019s birthday celebration, as well as to study\nintensively for a history test and work with a group on a math project.\nAs Bill discovers in carrying out his plans, he experiences\nmuch less stress than before as he tackles the \u201csmall\u201d daily writing\ntasks he has assigned himself. On the day he does his brainstorming\nfor Essay 1, he does not feel pressured by the fact that he still\nneeds to write and revise the essay\u2014he knows the time-slots for\nthose tasks are already carved out in his calendar and he will be able to\naddress those items on the designated dates.

Like loss of faith in everything else\n244 The Literary Analysis Essay\nIn Chapter 5, we saw Bill\u2019s final draft of the essay. He did much work\nbetween composing the tentative outline, above, and completing the full,\nrevised essay. With his task-list broken down and carefully scheduled, he\nwas able to give each phase the attention and time necessary to produce a\nwell-argued final essay.\n8.3 Determining an Effective Essay Structure\nOne common misconception students entertain when they approach\nliterary analysis essays is the idea that the structure of the essay should\nfollow the structure of the literary work. The events of short stories,\nnovels, and plays are often related chronologically, in linear order from\nthe moment when the first event occurs to the moment of the last. Yet, it\ncan be awkward to write a literary analysis using the story\u2019s chronology\nas a basic structure for your own essay. Often, this approach leads to an\nessay that simply summarizes the literary work. Since a literary analysis\npaper should avoid summary for summary\u2019s sake, the writer should avoid\nan essay structure that results in that pattern: And then Brett goes to San\nSebastian with Robert Cohn, and then she returns in time to meet her\nfianc\u00e9 Mike Campbell, and then\u2026.\nNote that in Bill\u2019s essay on The Sun Also Rises, he decided to focus on\ntwo significant metaphors and to dedicate a major section of his paper to\neach. He does not mention Brett\u2019s trip to San Sebastian at all since it does\nnot pertain directly to the paper\u2019s discussion of the metaphors. How does\nhe determine the paper\u2019s arrangement? Why does he discuss the metaphor\nof Jake\u2019s wound before that of the tainted bull fights? In the novel, we\ndo learn of Jake\u2019s wound first, and according to Bill, this metaphor helps\nestablish the theme of psychological wounds caused by the war. So,\nchronology does influence the arrangement of the paper to some extent, but\nit is not the primary factor in the paper\u2019s structure. Rather than beginning\nhis paper with a description of Jake\u2019s wound and then moving on to relate\nBrett\u2019s trip to San Sebastian with Robert, the ensuing antics of the group\nin Paris, their journey to Spain, etc., on through the list of the novel\u2019s\nplot events, Bill only includes the plot details supportive to his point, first\nillustrating the irreversible wounds of the group, represented by Jake\u2019s\nwar-wound, and second examining the spoiled bull fights representing the\ngroup\u2019s irreparable loss of faith and hope. The arrangement of the paper\ndoes not reject chronological order simply for the sake of doing so\u2014Bill\nrelates the events in the sequence of their occurrence when it is reasonable.\nHowever, it is his focus on the two metaphors that provides the basic\nstructure for his paper.\n245 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nSimilarly, in Katherine Jones\u2019s essay arguing that Brett Ashley is not\na monster but a woman caught between two ideologies, she structures the\npaper this way:\nI. Brett Ashley as sympathetic character in spite of some readers\u2019\ndisapproval of her behavior\na. Description of Brett\u2019s unconventional ways\nb. Signs that her rebellion takes its toll on her\ni. Alcohol\nii. Promiscuity\niii. Alienation and despair\nII. Conclusion: Her behavior is understandable given her\nchallenging circumstances\nLike Bill, Katherine structures her paper by arranging the major points\nlogically: The description of Brett\u2019s nontraditional behavior comes first\nin the essay\u2019s body because it helps set up the points that follow, points\nsupporting Katherine\u2019s argument that Brett\u2019s struggles illuminate her very\nhuman, and thus understandable, reactions to her challenges.\nIf chronology is not the primary structural factor in setting up a\nliterary analysis paper, what is? You might consider the following hints in\narranging the points of your own essay:\n1. What are your major points? In Bill\u2019s essay, he explores two\nimportant metaphors; in Katherine\u2019s she examines (a) Brett\u2019s\nunconventionality and then (b) evidence that her nontraditional\nbehavior is more than simple pleasure-seeking, seen in (i) her\nalcoholism, (ii) her promiscuity, and (iii) her expressions of\ndespair. In Marion Velis\u2019s essay \u201cClinging to Love: Theodore\nRoethke\u2019s \u2018My Papa\u2019s Waltz\u2019,\u201d printed in Chapter 2, her major\npoints focus on Roethke\u2019s use of rhythm, the poem\u2019s point of view,\nand its controlling metaphor. These major points should form the\nmain organizing components of the essay.\n2. What order will most effectively lead the reader to your perspective\non this subject? In each of the essays mentioned above, the first\npoint of discussion helps to set up the paper. These writers work\nto draw in and orient the reader, first with the introduction and\nthen, further, in the second body paragraph. Conversely, the final\n246 The Literary Analysis Essay\npoint of the paper\u2019s body should be one that helps to \u201cclinch\u201d the\npaper\u2019s argument or end it \u201cwith a bang\u201d just before the conclusion\nreiterates the overarching argument in the essay\u2019s final lines.\n3. Paragraph breaks should (a) cue the reader regarding shifts in focus\n(hence Bill begins a new paragraph when he finishes discussion\nof Jake\u2019s wound and starts his exploration of the spoiled bull\nfights) and (b) break down ideas into small enough chunks that\nthe reader does not lose sight of the currently emphasized point\n(thus Katherine breaks her discussion of Brett\u2019s need to cope\ninto separate paragraphs on alcohol abuse, promiscuity, and\nexpressions of Brett\u2019s despair). On the other hand, in an academic\nessay, the paragraphs should not seem \u201cchoppy.\u201d Rather each\nshould be long enough to develop its point thoroughly before\nshifting to the next.\nThe literary analysis paper can be written with examination of only\nthe primary source, or, as we will discuss in the next chapter, you may\nintegrate into your argument the perspectives of other scholars (secondary\nsources). Regardless, your own findings from your analysis of the primary\ntext should be a priority in your interpretation of the work. Analytical\nskills are invaluable as you explore any subject, investigating the subject\nby breaking it down and looking closely at how it functions. Finding\npatterns in your observations, then, helps you to interpret your analysis\nand communicate to others how you came to your conclusions about the\nsubject\u2019s meaning and\/or effect. As you make your case to the readers, it\nis crucial that you make it clear how your perspective is relevant to them.\nIdeally, they will come away from your argument intrigued by the new\ninsights you have revealed about the subject.\n247 9\nThe Research Paper\nAlthough analysis is a crucial phase in writing about any subject,\nthe next step of contributing to society\u2019s knowledge and understanding\nis to participate in the scholarly dialogue on the subject. This point can\nbe clarified by comparing a biology lab report with a scholarly scientific\narticle. During the lab experiment, the scientist might examine a cancer\ncell, for example, after it has been treated with a particular substance. This\nfirst-hand (or primary) research is necessary to discovering whether the\nsubstance will have the desired effect on the cell. However, what if other\nscientists have tested this same substance on cancer cells previously? The\nresults of your experiment do not exist in a vacuum. Chances are that\nyou chose this substance for testing because, in your reading of existing\nscholarship, you learned which other substances have already been tried\nand what the outcomes of those experiments were. In testing this substance,\nyou and your team may have altered the conditions of the experiment a\nbit to see if, under slightly different circumstances, the substance will act\ndifferently than it has in previous experiments. As the research is refined,\nand scientists continue to communicate their discoveries to each other and\nto the world, the body of knowledge on the subject grows and deepens. As\na result of this \u201cteam\u201d effort, human understanding expands. The dialogue\namong scholars, conveyed through academic articles and books, is a\ncrucial resource for any researcher.\nWhile it might be a bit intimidating to enter this dialogue as a college\nfreshman, one must start somewhere! Certainly, you may feel strange\ndisagreeing with something an expert in the field has said about your\nsubject, but participating in this dialogue becomes easier with practice.\nOne can disagree with a scholar while maintaining a tone respectful\n248 The Research Paper\nof that scholar\u2019s credentials and experience. After all, we are grateful\nfor the groundwork our predecessors have laid for our own studies.\nHowever, things change, and with the benefit of hindsight, as well as of\nnew technologies and new discoveries, your generation will undoubtedly\nfurther human understanding. You are encouraged to take up the mantle\nwith curiosity and determination.\n9.1 Getting a Handle on Academic Research\nLikely born in the Information Age, you are probably quite adept at\nresearching on the internet for information you use in your daily life. From\nfinding a replacement screen for your broken cell phone to determining\nwho wrote the terrific song you heard yesterday on the radio, you probably\nfind it fairly easy to track down certain kinds of information. However,\nmost students find it challenging to navigate university library search tools\nto find an academic article for a class project. Why the difference?\nFirst, because academic search engines do not turn a profit as Google\nand Yahoo do, refinement of these systems happens at a much slower pace.\nIf you type \u201ctamixifen\u201d into the Google search bar, you will be asked if\nyou meant to search for \u201ctamoxifen,\u201d and you\u2019ll be presented with a list of\nsources on that correctly spelled topic. Conversely, if you type \u201ctamixifen\u201d\ninto your college library\u2019s science index search bar, you\u2019ll get a message\nthat there are \u201cno matches\u201d for your search\u2014a dead end. This is an example\nof the sophistication of commercial search engines as compared with\nacademic ones. It may seem odd that scholars of today use substandard tools,\nbut this is an effect of the differing economic models used by the for-profit\nand not-for-profit realms. In doing your research, you might be tempted\njust to revert to the Google search instead of struggling with Academic\nSearch Complete. However, if you do so, you will find that publications\non the most cutting edge research in your field cannot be accessed through\nGoogle. Academic journals usually require a paid subscription for anyone\nseeking to read their articles. Scholarly books recently published will not\nbe distributed free of charge on the internet. The authors and publishers of\nthese works function with a production model that requires funding but,\nfor important ideological reasons, does not depend on advertising for that\nsupport, and thus access to these academic sources is limited. The chart in\nChapter 3 will help you distinguish between popular sources, like those\nmost often found on Google, and scholarly sources like those found in\nyour college library.\nPerhaps the most distinctive factor of the scholarly article or book\nis the peer-review process it must undergo before being accepted for\n249 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\npublication. Through this process, the professionals of each discipline\nuphold its standards to ensure that the body of research in that field is truly\nexpanding and is maintained at a high quality.\nWith these points in mind, let\u2019s consider the best ways for finding up-\nto-date scholarly resources for your academic research paper. As a student\nenrolled in a college or university, you have likely paid fees that give you\naccess to your library\u2019s holdings. These include the many books (both\nphysical and digital) that your library has purchased as well as subscriptions\nto academic journals in a multitude of fields. Consider the example of\nRebekah Fish\u2019s poetry research paper assignment. She has chosen for her\ntopic the poem \u201cThe Hunting of the Hare\u201d by Margaret Cavendish.\nOn the advice of her instructor, Rebekah goes to her college library\u2019s\nweb page and clicks on MLA International Bibliography. In looking at\nthe other indexes available, she can see that there are indexes dedicated to\nresearch in biology, art, education, business, the medical fields, and many\nother disciplines. She makes a mental note in case she needs to use one of\nthese for an assignment in another class.\nIn MLA, she types \u201cThe Hunting of the Hare\u201d into the search bar, and\nunder \u201cSelect a Field\u201d she clicks on \u201csubjects.\u201d She clicks on \u201cSearch,\u201d\nand soon the tool yields a list of article and book titles. Not all of these\ntitles indicate a focus specifically on the poem she has chosen to write\nabout\u2014it appears that some articles simply include a paragraph or two on\nthe poem. But Rebekah does not rule out these sources. Her professor has\nadvised the class to start narrow and then broaden their search as necessary.\nSince Rebekah has found only a few sources written specifically on this\npoem, she does a new search on the poet, and again selects \u201csubjects\u201d as\nthe field since she is not currently interested in finding works written by\nthis poet. After printing the resulting list of articles, to go just a bit broader,\nRebekah finds the web page listing the library\u2019s book holdings. Rebekah\ntypes \u201cseventeenth century women poets\u201d into the search bar, and finds two\nhelpful book titles: Margaret Cavendish: Gender, Genre, Exile, by Emma\nL.E. Rees, and Reading Early Modern Women\u2019s Writing, by Paul Salzman.\nNow that Rebekah has a good list of possible resources, she begins\ntracking them down and reading them. She makes notes about the focus\nof each work in case she needs to consider any of them again later. As she\nreviews her list, she puts a star next to the most promising articles and\nbooks. She needs five secondary sources for this project, and there is no\nuse trying to force into her essay sources that do not match her focus. She\npicks those that will be most helpful to her as she defines and develops\nher argument.\n250 The Research Paper\n9.2 Thesis Revisited\nAlthough Rebekah has had in mind a working thesis shaping the\nargument for this paper, she now revisits this thesis. Having read several\nintriguing interpretations of the poem during her research, she works to\nrefine her own thesis to reflect its unique angle on the subject. Now that\nshe has a better sense of what her own argument will contribute to the\ngeneral dialogue on \u201cThe Hunting of the Hare,\u201d she works on her paper\noutline, considering where her discussion of each selected secondary\nsource will fit best.\n9.3 Integrating Research into Your Own Arguments\nStriving to establish her own perspective on the poem, to say something\noriginal rather than simply reporting what other scholars have said, Rebekah\nworks to keep her own voice dominant in the essay. While she incorporates\nparaphrase, summary, and quotes from her secondary sources, she is careful\nthat the majority of the essay\u2019s words are her own and that she does not\nallow the critics to speak for her. To clarify whose ideas are whose, she\nemploys tag words and phrases, such as \u201caccording to,\u201d \u201cSmith argues,\u201d\n\u201cSmith claims,\u201d and \u201ccontrary to Smith\u2019s position on this point, Jones\nargues\u2026.\u201d These tag words guide Rebekah\u2019s readers through the variety of\nperspectives to a clear view of Rebekah\u2019s argument. Further, she is careful to\ncite all references within the paper and to include a bibliography at the end\nof the essay listing every source she has mentioned in the paper.\nIt is important to note that because Rebekah\u2019s subject is the poem, she\nmust draw from the poem itself for her primary evidence. Thus, quoting from\nthe primary text is not only helpful, but necessary. While she works to control\nthe discussion with her own voice, she enriches the texture of the essay by\npulling in important lines of the poem at key moments in her argument. Not\nonly do they serve to support her major points, but they also generate a poetic\nquality in the essay itself, bringing the poem to life for readers.\n9.4 Documentation\nSeveral major documentation styles can be employed for academic\nprojects, each style common to certain disciplines. In the past, you may\nhave employed MLA style in your own English papers. MLA, maintained\nby the Modern Language Association, is generally used for writing in the\nhumanities, particularly on language and literature topics. However, it is\nimportant to be aware of the other major styles for use in projects in other\nareas. APA (established and maintained by the American Psychological\nAssociation) is usually used for writing in the social sciences. Chicago\n251 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nManual Style (or CMS) is often used in the field of history, though it is\nemployed by various publications across the humanities. CSE, established\nand maintained by the Council of Science Editors, is employed in biology\nand other sciences. As a student moving among the disciplines, keep in\nmind that conventions vary among fields. You can find guidelines for each\nof these documentation styles online at the Purdue Online Writing Lab\n(OWL) website: https:\/\/owl.english.purdue.edu\/owl\/. Below is a list of the\nbasic rules for MLA documentation style to guide you as you compose\nyour literary research paper.\n9.4.1 In-Text Citations\nA common way to cite your in-text sources is parenthetically, as in the\nfollowing example:\nJake participates in \u201cgossip\u201d about his peers\u2019 activities\n(Adair 114) perhaps as a means to get revenge for their\nengagement in intimacy, which he cannot enjoy.\nHere, the writer includes the last name of the article\u2019s author and the\npage number from which the information or concept comes. The writer\nmight alternatively mention the author and then in parenthesis include\nonly the page number:\nJake participates in \u201cgossip\u201d about his peers\u2019 activities,\nas Adair notes, perhaps as a means to get revenge for\ntheir engagement in intimacy which he cannot enjoy\n(114).\nMLA emphasizes the avoidance of footnotes and endnotes unless\nabsolutely necessary. Consequently, we have omitted footnote and endnote\nformating information. Please refer to the latest MLA guide for futher\ninformation regarding proper formatting: https:\/\/style.mla.org\/2016\/02\/29\/\nusing-notes-in-mla-style\/.\nSubsequent References:\nAfter you provide a full \u201cnote\u201d on a source in your paper, if you refer\nto that source again, you do not need to provide the full \u201cnote\u201d again.\nInstead, include just the author\u2019s name (or the work\u2019s title, if there is no\nauthor) and the page number(s) being referenced, as demonstrated below:\nAdair 116.\n252 The Research Paper\n9.4.2 Work Cited Page\nYou will likely need to provide a Bibliography, or Works Cited page,\nin addition to footnotes or endnotes; such a list will certainly be required if\nyou have employed parenthetical notes. These entries require a somewhat\ndifferent format than the footnotes\/endnotes, so pay close attention to the\ndifferences. For the Works Cited Page, arrange the entries for your sources\nin alphabetical order according to the authors\u2019 last names, or if there is no\nauthor listed, by the article title\u2019s first word. List authors by last name first.\nAlso, note that unlike in a paragraph or a footnote, which indents the first\nline and brings the rest of the text back to the margin, a bibliography entry\ndoes exactly the opposite!\nPrint Journal Article:\nAuthor\u2019s last name, first name. \u201cArticle Title.\u201d Journal Title, vol. number,\nissue number, Date of Publication, page numbers of entire article.\nWilliam, Adair. \u201cErnest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises: The Novel as\nGossip.\u201d The Hemingway Review, vol. 3, no.1, Spring 2012, pp. 114-118.\nJournal Article from an Electronic Database:\nAuthor\u2019s last name, first name. \u201cArticle Title.\u201d Journal Title, vol. number,\nissue number, Date of Publication, page numbers if available.

A study of this poem\nsuggests that Cavendish can be viewed as one of the first\nsupporters for animal rights as she criticizes the cruelty of\nmen who kill animals for sport. On a more personal level,\nCavendish could have closely identified with the hare,\nwhich is ostensibly humanlike, and also with its fear. She\nmight have even intended to parallel her critics to the\ndogs and the hunters within the poem. On a grander scale,\nCavendish might be making the critical judgment that\nhumankind seeks enjoyment through violent competition\nwith others. Through a study of the many different\nthematic levels of the poem, Margaret Cavendish\u2019s \u201cThe\nHunting of the Hare\u201d seems to have an overarching theme\nof humanity\u2019s destructive attraction to violence in order to\nachieve supremacy.\nIt is evident through the poet\u2019s portrayal of the hare that\nit is meant to be seen as a significant and even a symbolic\nfigure, beginning in the first line of the poem where the\nhare is granted the name \u201cWat.\u201d He is humanlike, \u201cglaring\u201d\nacross the landscape as his \u201cHaires blew up behind\u201d him\nin the wind instead of his fur (4 and 6). The hare is also\ndescribed as \u201cwise\u201d instead of merely being a sentient\ncreature, and Cavendish makes its humanlike features\neven more evident as the hare \u201cwalks about\u201d rather than\nhopping or crawling (Cavendish 7 and 11). Another way\nthe rabbit is seemingly anthropomorphized is through the\ncontinual use of the personal pronoun \u201chim\u201d in the poem,\nwhich is used instead of \u201cit.\u201d To indicate her disapproval\nof the unethical treatment of all animals, near the very\nend of the poem Cavendish grants all creatures the same\nhumanlike quality as the hare by saying that creatures\nare being \u201cmurdered\u201d (100) by men instead of \u201ckilled.\u201d\n255 Writing and Literature: Composition as Inquiry, Learning, Thinking, and Communication\nThe word \u201cmurder\u201d connotes unlawfulness and makes\na connection between that illicitness and the killing of\nanimals, indicating that all sentient life, that of humans\nand animals, is important and worthy of being preserved.\nSome may even argue that Cavendish was trying to make\na point that humankind should not express dominant\nauthority over other creatures through use of violence,\nbecause within the last lines of the poem, man is portrayed\nnot only as murderous, but also as an oppressive tyrant\nthat rules over all other living creatures.\nCavendish\u2019s humanlike portrayal of the hare\nmight raise concerns for some readers. Bruce Thomas\nBoehrer discusses some critics\u2019 objection to an\nauthor\u2019s anthropomorphizing nonhuman characters. To\nanthropomorphize is to project one\u2019s own tendencies and\ntraits onto another species. Some critics argue that this\nact ignores a nonhuman species\u2019 real behaviors and traits\nand illustrates humans\u2019 feeling of dominance over nature.\nHowever, as Boehrer explains, many animal characters in\nliterature \u201cchallenge the human-animal divide\u201d (5) and\nforce people to examine their values, especially those\nrelated to nature. Donna Landry supports the view that \u201cThe\nHunting of the Hare\u201d raises these issues. She argues that\nin Cavendish\u2019s work, she promotes the \u201cdemocratizing of\nrelations between humans and other species\u201d (471). Rather\nthan emphasizing the superiority of human emotions by\nanthropomorphizing the hare, Cavendish humanizes him\nin order to bridge the gap between the reader and the hare.\nPaul Salzman states that Cavendish\u2019s main goal as a writer\nwas \u201cto enter into an empathetic relationship with the\nworld around her\u201d (142). In \u201cThe Hunting of the Hare,\u201d\nCavendish portrays the hare with empathy in order to\npersuade the reader that committing unnecessary violence\non animals is cruel and terrible.\nIn addition, the description of the hare is used to form\nand emphasize the strong connection between the hare\nand Cavendish, who was similarly being pursued by her\ncritics as a female writer. This criticism is clearly shown\nthrough the description of Cavendish by Mary Evelyn,\nwho portrayed her as extravagant and vain and said\n256 The Research Paper\nthat her discourse was \u201cas airy, empty, whimsical, and\nrambling as her books\u201d (Qtd. in Damrosch and Dettmar\n2058-9). Many people of Cavendish\u2019s time viewed\nher as outrageous, partly because publicly recognized\nwomen writers were rare during the seventeenth century.\nAlthough scholars seriously study Cavendish\u2019s work now,\nEmma L.E. Rees says that because of the harsh critics of\nher time, \u201cThe impression which lasted for many years\nwas of an eccentric, disturbed and arrogant woman\u201d\n(11). \u201cThe Hunting of the Hare\u201d could be interpreted as a\nresponse to this criticism. Her critics, paralleled by both\nthe \u201ccruel dogs\u201d (16) and the men in the poem, are often\nreferred to as merciless. The critics are described as nosy\nthrough common references to the dogs and how they\nalways \u201cthrust [their] snuffling nose[s]\u201d into things (64).\nThey are also described as loudmouths through the image\nof the dogs who cry out with their \u201cwide mouths\u201d (19).\nWhile at times Cavendish seems to be uncaring as to what\nthe critics say about her, at other times she seems terrified\nof the public\u2019s opinion of her life and writing, much like\nthe hare\u2019s terror of being pursued. She suggests that in\npublic, she hides her fear of the critics, similarly to the\nhare when, \u201cLicking his feet, he wiped his ears so clean\n\/ That none could tell that Wat had hunted been\u201d (41-2).\nAlthough the critics continued to pursue her, Cavendish\nemphasizes through the poem that she will continue to\nmaintain her composure until the very end, like the hare\ndoes until his death. Yet, this continual pursuing and\nkilling of hares, which parallels Cavendish\u2019s experience,\ncritiques human nature\u2019s desire for supremacy over all\nliving things\u2014even each other.\nNot only can Cavendish\u2019s poem be seen as a response\nto the cruelty to animals and the cruelty of the critics, but\nit can also be seen as an assessment of how humankind\ntreats its brethren. In the poem, the men are portrayed as\nbloodthirsty monsters that thrive off cruelty to others. The\nmen in Cavendish\u2019s poem, who \u201cdestroy those lives that\nGod did make\u201d (98) solely for \u201csport or recreation\u2019s sake\u201d\n(97), seek to kill the rabbit, the symbol, through heavy\npersonification, of a fellow human (Cavendish 2062).\n257 "}
