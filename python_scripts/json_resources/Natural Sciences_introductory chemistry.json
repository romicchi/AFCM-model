Key\nSeptember 2014\nThe decision to write a new textbook from scratch is not one to be taken lightly. The author becomes a saint to\nsome and a sinner to others\u2014and the feedback from the \u201cothers\u201d is felt more acutely than the feedback from the\n\u201csome\u201d!Ultimately,thedecisiontowriteanewbookcomesfromthedeepfeelingthatanauthorcanmakeapos-\nitive contribution to the field, and that it is ultimately time well invested.\nIt also helps that there are people supporting the author both personally and professionally. The first person to\nthank must be Jennifer Welchans of Flat World Knowledge. I have known Jen for years; indeed, she was instru-\nmental in getting me to write my first academic book, a math review book that is still available through another\npublisher. We reconnected recently, and I learned that she was working for a new publisher with some interest-\ning publishing ideas. With her urging, the editorial director and I got together, first by phone and then in person,\nto discuss this project. With all the enthusiasm and ideas that Flat World Knowledge brought to the table, it was\ndifficult not to sign on and write this book. So thanks, Jen\u2014again. Hopefully this won\u2019t be the last book we do\ntogether.\nThanksalsotoMichaelBoezi,editorialdirectoratFlatWorldKnowledge,forhisenthusiasticsupport.JennYee,\nproject manager at Flat World Knowledge, did a great job of managing the project and all of its pieces\u2014man-\nuscript, answers to exercises, art, reviews, revisions, and all the other things required to put a project like this\ntogether.

Simply put, chemistryis the study of the interactions of matter with other matter and with\nenergy.Thisseemsstraightforwardenough.However,thedefinitionofchemistryincludesawiderangeoftopics\nthat must be understood to gain a mastery of the topic or even take additional courses in chemistry. In this book,\nwewilllaythefoundationsofchemistryinatopic-by-topicfashiontoprovideyouwiththebackgroundyouneed\nto successfully understand chemistry.\n3 Some Basic Definitions\nLearning Objectives\n1.Learn the basic terms used to describe matter.\nThe definition of chemistry\u2014the study of the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy\u2014uses\nsome terms that should also be defined. We start the study of chemistry by defining some basic terms.\nMatter.Abookismatter,acomputerismatter,foodismatter,anddirtinthegroundismatter.Sometimesmatter\nmay be difficult to identify. For example, air is matter, but because it is so thin compared to other matter (e.g., a\nbook, a computer, food, and dirt), we sometimes forget that air has mass and takes up space. Things that are not\nmatter include thoughts, ideas, emotions, and hopes.\nEExxaammppllee 11\nWhich of the following is matter and not matter?\n1.a hot dog\n2.love\n3.a tree\nSolution\n1.A hot dog has mass and takes up space, so it is matter.\n2.Love is an emotion, and emotions are not matter.\n3.A tree has mass and takes up space, so it is matter.\nTest Yourself\nWhich of the following is matter and not matter?\n4 5 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\n1.the moon\n2.an idea for a new invention\nAnswer\n1.The moon is matter.\n2.The invention itself may be matter, but the idea for it is not.\nFigure 1.1The Phases of Matter\nChemistry recognizes three fundamental phases of matter: solid (left), liquid (middle),\nand gas (right).\n\u201cIce cubes\u201d by Darren Hester is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic; \u201cGlass of Water\u201d by Greg Riegler is licensed\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic; Tea Time by V\u00e9locia is licensed\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- NoDerivs 2.0 Generic.\nTo understand matter and how it changes, we need to be able to describe matter. There are two basic ways to\ndescribe matter: physical properties and chemical properties. Physical propertiesare characteristics that describe\nmatter as it exists. Some of many physical characteristics of matter are shape, color, size, and temperature. An\nimportant physical property is the phase (or state) of matter. The three fundamental phases of matter are solid,\nliquid, and gas (seeFigure 1.1 \u201cThe Phases of Matter\u201d).\nFigure 1.2Chemical Properties\nThe fact that this match burns is a chemical property of the match. SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS \u2022 6\nThe fact that this match burns is a chemical property of the match.\n\u201clit a match\u201d (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Match_stick,_lit_a_match,_match_box,_fire.JPG) by Jith JR is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported.\nChemical propertiesare characteristics of matter that describe how matter changes form in the presence of other\nmatter.Doesasampleofmatterburn?Burningisachemicalproperty.Doesitbehaveviolentlywhenputinwater?\nThisreactionisachemicalpropertyaswell(Figure1.2\u201cChemicalProperties\u201d).Inthefollowingchapters,wewill\nsee how descriptions of physical and chemical properties are important aspects of chemistry.\nFigure 1.3Physical Changes\nThe solid ice melts into liquid water\u2014a physical change.\nThe solid ice melts into liquid water\u2014a physical change.\n\u201cMelting Ice Cubes\u201d (https://www.flickr.com/photos/jariceiii/5012344135/) by Jar is\nlicensed under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic.\nIf matter always stayed the same, chemistry would be rather boring. Fortunately, a major part of chemistry\ninvolves change. A physical changeoccurs when a sample of matter changes one or more of its physical prop- 7 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nerties. For example, a solid may melt (Figure 1.3 \u201cPhysical Changes\u201d), or alcohol in a thermometer may change\nvolume as the temperature changes. A physical change does not affect the chemical composition of matter.\nA chemical changeis the process of demonstrating a chemical property, such as the burning match in Figure 1.2\n\u201cChemical Properties\u201d. As the matter in the match burns, its chemical composition changes, and new forms of\nmatterwithnewphysicalpropertiesarecreated.Notethatchemicalchangesarefrequentlyaccompaniedbyphys-\nical changes, as the new matter will likely have different physical properties from the original matter.\nEExxaammppllee 22\nDescribe each process as a physical change or a chemical change.\n1.Water in the air turns into snow.\n2.A person\u2019s hair is cut.\n3.Bread dough becomes fresh bread in an oven.\nSolution\n1.Because the water is going from a gas phase to a solid phase, this is a physical change.\n2.Your long hair is being shortened. This is a physical change.\n3.Because of the oven\u2019s temperature, chemical changes are occurring in the bread dough to make\nfresh bread. These are chemical changes. (In fact, a lot of cooking involves chemical changes.)\nTest Yourself\nIdentify each process as a physical change or a chemical change.\n1.A fire is raging in a fireplace.\n2.Water is warmed to make a cup of coffee.\nAnswers\n1.chemical change\n2.physical change\nA sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout is called a substance.

Physical combinations of more than one\nsubstance are called mixtures. There are two types of mixtures. A heterogeneous mixtureis a mixture composed\noftwoormoresubstances.Itiseasytotell,sometimesbythenakedeye,thatmorethanonesubstanceispresent.\nA homogeneous mixtureis a combination of two or more substances that is so intimately mixed that the mixture\nbehaves as a single substance.

A nonmetalis an element that is brittle when solid, does not conduct electricity or\nheat very well, and cannot be made into thin sheets or wires (Figure 1.5 \u201cSemimetals\u201d).

These items contain\nchemicals that interact with the oil and dirt on your body and hair to remove them and wash them away.\nMany of these products also contain chemicals that make you smell good; they are called fragrances.\n\u2022 When you brush your teeth in the morning, you usually use toothpaste, a form of soap, to clean your teeth.\nToothpastes typically contain tiny, hard particles calledabrasivesthat physically scrub your teeth. Many\ntoothpastes also contain fluoride, a substance that chemically interacts with the surface of the teeth to help\nprevent cavities.\n\u2022 Perhaps you take vitamins, supplements, or medicines every morning. Vitamins and other supplements con-\ntain chemicals your body needs in small amounts to function properly. Medicines are chemicals that help SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS \u2022 12\ncombat diseases and promote health.\n\u2022 Perhaps you make some fried eggs for breakfast. Frying eggs involves heating them enough so that a chem-\nical reaction occurs to cook the eggs.\n\u2022 After you eat, the food in your stomach is chemically reacted so that the body (mostly the intestines) can\nabsorb food, water, and other nutrients.\n\u2022 If you drive or take the bus to school or work, you are using a vehicle that probably burns gasoline, a mater-\nial that burns fairly easily and provides energy to power the vehicle.

Chemistry as a Science\nLearning Objectives\n1.Learn what science is and how it works.\nChemistry is a branch of science. Although science itself is difficult to define exactly, the following definition\ncanserveasstartingpoint.Scienceistheprocessofknowingaboutthenaturaluniversethroughobservationand\nexperiment. Science is not the only process of knowing (e.g., the ancient Greeks simply sat and thought), but it\nhas evolved over more than 350 years into the best process that humanity has devised to date to learn about the\nuniverse around us.\nTheprocessofscienceisusuallystatedasthescientificmethod,whichisratherna\u00efvelydescribedasfollows:(1)\nstateahypothesis,(2)testthehypothesis,and(3)refinethehypothesis.Actually,however,theprocessisnotthat\nsimple.

For example, it is fairly obvious that if you drop an object from a height, it\nwillfall.Severalhundredyearsago(coincidentally,neartheinceptionofmodernscience),theconceptofgravity\nexplained that test.

Science is concerned with that\u2014andonlythat.\nOf course, there are other things that concern us. For example, is the English language part of science? Most of\nus can easily answer no; English is not science. English is certainly worth knowing (at least for people in pre-\ndominantly English-speaking countries), but why isn\u2019t it science? English, or any human language, isn\u2019t science\nbecause ultimately it is contrived; it is made up.

Carbon dioxide is an important compound in the cycle of\nlife on earth.\nEven though it is a gas, carbon dioxide can dissolve in water, just like sugar or salt can dissolve in water. When\nthat occurs, we have a homogeneous mixture, or a solution, of carbon dioxide in water. However, very little car-\nbondioxide can dissolve in water.Ifthe atmosphere were pure carbon dioxide, the solution would be only about\n0.07% carbon dioxide. In reality, the air is only about 0.03% carbon dioxide, so the amount of carbon dioxide in\nwater is reduced proportionally.\nHowever, when soda and beer are made, manufacturers do two important things: they use pure carbon dioxide\ngas,andtheyuseitatveryhighpressures.Withhigherpressures,morecarbondioxidecandissolveinthewater.\nWhen the soda or beer container is sealed, the high pressure of carbon dioxide gas remains inside the package.\n(Of course, there are more ingredients in soda and beer besides carbon dioxide and water.)\nWhen you open a container of soda or beer, you hear a distinctive hiss as the excess carbon dioxide gas escapes.\nBut something else happens as well.

Then, when the champagne bottle is opened, the increased pressure of carbon\ndioxide is released, and the drink bubbles just like an expensive glass of soda.\nSoda, beer, and sparkling wine take advantage of the properties of a solution of carbon\ndioxide in water.\n\u201ccola with ice\u201d by Simon Cousins is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution\n2.0 Generic license. \u201cBeer\u201d by Will Vanlue is licensed under Cre- ative Commons the\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic. \u201cSparkling Water\u201d by T.

These incidents occurred because people weren\u2019t paying attention to quantities.\nChemistry, like all sciences, is quantitative. It deals with quantities, things that have amounts and units. Dealing\n25 INTRODUCTION TO MEASUREMENTS \u2022 26\nwithquantitiesisveryimportantinchemistry,asisrelatingquantitiestoeachother.Inthischapter,wewilldiscuss\nhow we deal with numbers and units, including how they are combined and manipulated. Expressing Numbers\nLearning Objective\n1. Learn to express numbers properly.\nQuantities have two parts: the number and the unit. The number tells \u201chow many.\u201d It is important to be able to\nexpress numbers properly so that the quantities can be communicated properly.\nStandard notationis the straightforward expression of a number. Numbers such as 17, 101.5, and 0.00446 are\nexpressed in standard notation. For relatively small numbers, standard notation is fine. However, for very large\nnumbers, such as 306,000,000, or for very small numbers, such as 0.000000419, standard notation can be cum-\nbersome because of the number of zeros needed to place nonzero numbers in the proper position.\nScientific notationis an expression of a number using powers of 10. Powers of 10 are used to express numbers\nthat have many zeros:\n100 = 1\n101 = 10\n102 = 100 = 10 \u00d7 10\n103 = 1,000 = 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10\n104 = 10,000 = 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10\nandsoforth.Theraisednumbertotherightofthe10indicatingthenumberoffactorsof10intheoriginalnumber\nis the exponent. (Scientific notation is sometimes called exponential notation.) The exponent\u2019s value is equal to\nthe number of zeros in the number expressed in standard notation.\nSmall numbers can also be expressed in scientific notation but with negative exponents:\n27 EXPRESSING NUMBERS \u2022 28\n10\u22121 = 0.1 = 1/10\n10\u22122 = 0.01 = 1/100\n10\u22123 = 0.001 = 1/1,000\n10\u22124 = 0.0001 = 1/10,000\nandsoforth.Again,thevalueoftheexponentisequaltothenumberofzerosinthedenominatoroftheassociated\nfraction. A negative exponent implies a decimal number less than one.\nAnumber is expressed in scientific notation bywriting the first nonzero digit, then a decimal point, and then the\nrestofthedigits.Thepartofanumberinscientificnotationthatismultipliedbyapowerof10iscalledthecoef-\nficient. Then determine the power of 10 needed to make that number into the original number and multiply the\nwritten number by the proper power of 10. For example, to write 79,345 in scientific notation,\n4\n79,345 = 7.9345 \u00d7 10,000 = 7.9345 \u00d7 10\n4\nThus, the number in scientific notation is 7.9345 \u00d7 10 . For small numbers, the same process is used, but the\nexponent for the power of 10 is negative:\n\u22124\n0.000411 = 4.11 \u00d7 1/10,000 = 4.11 \u00d7 10\nTypically, the extra zero digits at the end or the beginning of a number are not included.\nEExxaammppllee 11\nExpress these numbers in scientific notation.\n1.306,000\n2.0.00884\n3.2,760,000\n4.0.000000559\nSolution\n5\n1.The number 306,000 is 3.06 times 100,000, or 3.06 times 10 .

In scientific notation, the\n\u22123\nnumber is 8.84 \u00d7 10 .\n6\n3.The number 2,760,000 is 2.76 times 1,000,000, which is the same as 2.76 times 10 . In scientific\n6\nnotation, the number is written as 2.76 \u00d7 10 . Note that we omit the zeros at the end of the original\nnumber.\n\u22127\n4.The number 0.000000559 is 5.59 times 1/10,000,000, which is 5.59 times 10 .

We see by counting\nthetickmarksontherulerthattheobjectisatleastthreeticksafterthe1.Ifeachtickrepresents0.1cm,thenwe\nknow the object is at least 1.3 cm wide. But our ruler does not have any more ticks between the 0.3 and the 0.4\nmarks, so we can\u2019t know exactly how much the next decimal place is. But with a practiced eye we can estimate\nit. Let us estimate it as about six-tenths of the way between the third and fourth tick marks, which estimates our\nhundredths place as 6, so we identify a measurement of 1.36 cm for the width of the object.\nFigure 2.6Expressing Width\n35 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES \u2022 36\nWhat is the proper way to express the width of this object?\nDoesitmakeanysensetotrytoreportathousandthsplaceforthemeasurement?No,itdoesn\u2019t;wearenotexactly\nsure ofthe hundredths place (after all, it was an estimate only), soit would be fruitless to estimate a thousandths\nplace.

The arrow is between the\nthird and fourth small tick marks, so it\u2019s at least 0.3. We will have to estimate the last place. It looks\nlike about one-third of the way across the space, so let us estimate the hundredths place as 3. Com-\nbining the digits, we have a measurement of 4.33 psi (psi stands for \u201cpounds per square inch\u201d and is\na unit of pressure, like air in a tire). We say that the measurement is reported to three significant fig-\nures.\n2.The rectangle is at least 1.0 cm wide but certainly not 2.0 cm wide, so the first significant digit is\n1. The rectangle\u2019s width is past the second tick mark but not the third; if each tick mark represents\n0.1, then the rectangle is at least 0.2 in the next significant digit. We have to estimate the next place\nbecause there are no markings to guide us. It appears to be about halfway between 0.2 and 0.3, so we\nwill estimate the next place to be a 5. Thus, the measured width of the rectangle is 1.25 cm. Again,\nthe measurement is reported to three significant figures.\nTest Yourself\nWhat would be the reported width of this rectangle?\nAnswer\n0.63 cm\nInmanycases,youwillbegivenameasurement.Howcanyoutellbylookingwhatdigitsaresignificant?\nForexample,thereportedpopulationoftheUnitedStatesis306,000,000.Doesthatmeanthatitisexactly\nthree hundred six million or is some estimation occurring?\nThefollowingconventionsdictatewhichnumbersinareportedmeasurementaresignificantandwhichare\nnot significant:\n1.Any nonzero digit is significant.\n2.Any zeros between nonzero digits (i.e., embedded zeros) are significant.\n3.Zeros at the end of a number without a decimal point (i.e., trailing zeros) are not significant; they\nserve only to put the significant digits in the correct positions.

Going back to the original equality, suppose we divide both sides of the equation by\n1 yard (numberandunit):\n46 47 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe expression is still an equality, by the rules of algebra. The left fraction equals 1. It has the same quantity in\nthe numerator and the denominator, so it must equal 1. The quantities in the numerator and denominator cancel,\nboth the numberandthe unit:\nWhen everything cancels in a fraction, the fraction reduces to 1:\nWe have an expression, 3ft1yd, that equals 1. This is a strange way to write 1, but it makes sense: 3 ft equal 1\nyd, so the quantities in the numerator and denominator are the same quantity, just expressed with different units.\nThe expression 3ft1yd is called a conversion factor, and it is used to formally change the unit of a quantity into\nanother unit. (The process of converting units in such a formal fashion is sometimes called dimensional analysis\nor thefactor label method.)\nTo see how this happens, let us start with the original quantity:\n4 yd\nNowletusmultiplythisquantityby1.Whenyoumultiplyanythingby1,youdon\u2019tchangethevalueofthequan-\ntity.

Temperatureis a measure of the average amount of\nenergy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains.

In the United States, the commonly used temper-\nature scale is the Fahrenheit scale (symbolized by \u00b0F and spoken as \u201cdegrees Fahrenheit\u201d). On this scale, the\nfreezing point of liquid water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to solid ice) is 32 \u00b0F, and the boiling\npoint of water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to steam) is 212 \u00b0F.\nScience also uses other scales to express temperature.

Expressing Units\nLearning Objectives\n1.Learn the units that go with various quantities.\n2.Express units using their abbreviations.\n3.Make new units by combining numerical prefixes with units.\nA number indicates \u201chow much,\u201d but the unit indicates \u201cof what.\u201d The \u201cof what\u201d is important when communi-\ncating a quantity. For example, if you were to ask a friend how close you are to Lake Erie and your friend says\n\u201csix,\u201d then your friend isn\u2019t giving you complete information. Six what? Six miles? Six inches? Six city blocks?\nThe actual distance to the lake depends on what units you use.\nChemistry, like most sciences, uses the International System of Units, or SI for short. (The letters SI stand for\ntheFrench\u201cleSyst\u00e8meInternationald\u2019unit\u00e9s.\u201d)SIspecifiescertainunitsforvarioustypesofquantities,basedon\nseven fundamental unitsfor various quantities. We will use most of the fundamental units in chemistry. Initially,\nwe will deal with three fundamental units. The meter (m) is the SI unit of length. It is a little longer than a yard\n(see Figure 2.3 \u201cThe Meter\u201d). The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), which is about 2.2 pounds (lb). The SI\nunit of time is the second (s).\nFigure 2.3The Meter\nThe SI standard unit of length, the meter, is a little longer than a yard.\nTo express a quantity, you need to combine a number with a unit. If you have a length that is 2.4 m, then you\n4\nexpress that length as simply 2.4 m. A time of 15,000 s can be expressed as 1.5 \u00d7 10 s in scientific notation.\n71 EXPRESSING UNITS \u2022 72\nSometimes,agivenunitisnotanappropriatesizetoeasilyexpressaquantity.Forexample,thewidthofahuman\nhair is very small, and it doesn\u2019t make much sense to express it in meters. SI also defines a series of numerical\nprefixesthat refer to multiples or fractions of a fundamental unit to make a unit more conveniently sized for a\nspecific quantity. Table 2.1 \u201cMultiplicative Prefixes for SI Units\u201d lists the prefixes, their abbreviations, and their\nmultiplicativefactors.Someoftheprefixes,suchaskilo-,mega-,andgiga-,representmorethanoneofthefunda-\nmental unit, while other prefixes, such as centi-, milli-, and micro-, represent fractions of the original unit. Note,\ntoo, that once again we are using powers of 10. Each prefix is a multiple of or fraction of a power of 10.\nTable 2.1Multiplicative Prefixes for SI Units\nPrefix Abbreviation Multiplicative Amount\ngiga- G 1,000,000,000 \u00d7\nmega- M 1,000,000 \u00d7\nkilo- k 1,000 \u00d7\ndeci- d 1/10 \u00d7\ncenti- c 1/100 \u00d7\nmilli- m 1/1,000 \u00d7\nmicro- \u03bc* 1/1,000,000 \u00d7\nnano- n 1/1,000,000,000 \u00d7\npico- p 1/1,000,000,000,000 \u00d7\n* The letter\u03bcis the Greek letter lowercase equivalent to an m and is called \u201cmu\u201d (pronounced \u201cmyoo\u201d).\nTousethefractionstogeneratenewunits,simplycombinetheprefixwiththeunititself;theabbreviationforthe\nnew unit is the combination of the abbreviation for the prefix and the abbreviation of the unit. For example, the\nkilometer(km)is1,000\u00d7meter,or1,000m.Thus,5kilometers(5km)isequalto5,000m.Similarly,amillisec-\nond(ms)is1/1,000\u00d7second,orone-thousandthofasecond.Thus,25msis25thousandthsofasecond.Youwill\nneedtobecomeproficientincombiningprefixesandunits.(Youmayrecognizethatoneofourfundamentalunits,\nthe kilogram, automatically has a prefix-unit combination, the kilogram. The word kilogrammeans 1,000 g.)\nIn addition to the fundamental units, SI also allows for derived unitsbased on a fundamental unit or units. There\nare many derived units used in science. For example, the derived unit for area comes from the idea that area is\ndefinedaswidthtimesheight.Becausebothwidthandheightarelengths,theybothhavethefundamentalunitof\n2 2\nmeter, so the unit of area is meter \u00d7 meter, or meter (m ). This is sometimes spoken as \u201csquare meters.\u201d A unit\n2 2 2\nwithaprefixcanalsobeusedtoderiveaunitforarea,sowecanalsohavecm ,mm ,orkm asacceptableunits\nfor area.\n3 3\nVolume is defined as length times width times height, so it has units of meter \u00d7 meter \u00d7 meter or meter (m ),\nsometimes spoken as \u201ccubic meters.\u201d The cubic meter is a rather large unit, however, so another unit is defined\nthat is somewhat more manageable: the liter (L). A liter is 1/1,000th of a cubic meter and is a little more than\n1 quart in volume (see Figure 2.4 \u201cThe Liter\u201d). Prefixes can also be used with the liter unit, so we can speak of\nmilliliters (1/1,000th of a liter; mL) and kiloliters (1,000 L; kL). 73 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nFigure 2.4The Liter\nThe SI unit of volume, the liter, is slightly larger than 1 quart.\nAnother definition of a liter is one-tenth of a meter cubed. Because one-tenth of a meter is 10 cm, then a liter\n3\nis equal to 1,000 cm (Figure 2.5 \u201cThe Size of 1 Liter\u201d). Because 1 L equals 1,000 mL, we conclude that 1 mL\n3\nequals 1 cm ; thus, these units are interchangeable.\nFigure 2.5The Size of 1 Liter\n3 3\nOne liter equals 1,000 cm , so 1 cm is the same as 1 mL.\nUnits not only are multiplied together but also can be divided. For example, if you are traveling at one meter for\nevery second of time elapsed, your velocity is 1 meter per second, or 1 m/s. The word per implies division, so\nvelocityisdeterminedbydividingadistancequantitybyatimequantity.Otherunitsforvelocityincludekilome-\ntersperhour(km/h)orevenmicrometerspernanosecond(\u03bcm/ns).Later,wewillseeotherderivedunitsthatcan\nbe expressed as fractions.

The number 6.0 \u00d7 10 can be written as 60 \u00d7 10 , and a microme-\n\u22126\nter is 10 m, so the diameter of a human hair is about 60 \u03bcm.\n2.If velocity is defined as a distance quantity divided by a time quantity, then velocity is 25 meters/\n5.0 seconds.

The ultimate particles that compose all matter are about 10 m in size, or about 1 \u00c5.\nThis makes the angstrom a natural\u2014though not approved\u2014unit for describing these particles.\nThe angstrom unit is named after Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, a nineteenth-century Swedish physicist. \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m\u2019s\nresearch dealt with light being emitted by glowing objects, including the sun. \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m studied the brightness\nof the different colors of light that the sun emitted and was able to deduce that the sun is composed of the same\nkinds of matter that are present on the earth. By extension, we now know that all matter throughout the universe\nis similar to the matter that exists on our own planet.\nAndersJonas\u00c5ngstrom,aSwedishphysicist,studiedthelightcomingfromthesun.Hiscontributionstoscience\nwere sufficient to have a tiny unit of length named after him, the angstrom, which is one ten-billionth of a meter.\nSource: Photo of the sun courtesy of NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory, http://commons.wikimedia.org/\nwiki/File:The_Sun_by_the_Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_of_NASA%27s_Solar_Dynamics_Observatory_-\n_20100801.jpg.\nThe basic building block of all matter is the atom. Curiously, the idea of atoms was first proposed in the fifth\ncenturyBCE,whentheGreekphilosophersLeucippusandDemocritusproposedtheirexistenceinasurprisingly\nmodern fashion. However, their ideas never took hold among their contemporaries, and it wasn\u2019t until the early\n1800s that evidence amassed to make scientists reconsider the idea. Today, the concept of the atom is central to\nthe study of matter.\n84 Acids\nLearning Objectives\n1.Defineacid.\n2.Name a simple acid.\nThere is one other group of compounds that is important to us\u2014acids\u2014and these compounds have interesting\n+\nchemical properties. Initially, we will define an acidas an ionic compound of the H cation dissolved in water.\n(We will expand on this definition in Chapter 12 \u201cAcids and Bases\u201d.) To indicate that something is dissolved in\nwater, we will use the phase label (aq) next to a chemical formula (where aq stands for \u201caqueous,\u201d a word that\ndescribes something dissolved in water). If the formula does not have this label, then the compound is treated as\na molecular compound rather than an acid.\nAcids have their own nomenclature system. If an acid is composed of only hydrogen and one other element, the\nname is hydro- +the stem of the other element +-ic acid. For example, the compound HCl(aq) is hydrochloric\nacid, while H2S(aq) is hydrosulfuric acid. (If these acids were not dissolved in water, the compounds would be\ncalledhydrogenchlorideandhydrogensulfide,respectively.Bothofthesesubstancesarewellknownasmolecu-\nlar compounds; when dissolved in water, however, they are treated as acids.)\nIf a compound is composed of hydrogen ions and a polyatomic anion, then the name of the acid is derived from\nthestemofthepolyatomic ion\u2019sname.Typically,iftheanionnameendsin-ate,thenameoftheacidisthestem\noftheanionnameplus-icacid;iftherelatedanion\u2019snameendsin-ite,thenameofthecorrespondingacidisthe\nstemoftheanionnameplus-ousacid.Table3.9\u201cNamesandFormulasofAcids\u201dliststheformulasandnamesof\navarietyofacidsthatyoushouldbefamiliarwith.Youshouldrecognizemostoftheanionsintheformulasofthe\nacids.\nTable 3.9Names and Formulas of Acids\n85 ACIDS \u2022 86\nFormula Name\nHC2H3O2 acetic acid\nHClO3 chloric acid\nHCl hydrochloric acid\nHBr hydrobromic acid\nHI hydriodic acid\nHF hydrofluoric acid\nHNO3 nitric acid\nH2C2O4 oxalic acid\nHClO4 perchloric acid\nH3PO4 phosphoric acid\nH2SO4 sulfuric acid\nH2SO3 sulfurous acid\nNote: The \u201caq\u201d label is omitted for clarity.\nEExxaammppllee 1100\nName each acid without consultingTable 3.9 \u201cNames and Formulas of Acids\u201d.\n1.HBr\n2.H2SO4\nSolution\n1.As a binary acid, the acid\u2019s name ishydro-+stem name +-ic acid.

They have the same number of\nelectrons as protons, so the negative charges of the electrons is balanced by the positive charges of the protons.\nHowever, this is not always the case.

A proper ionic formula has a cation and an\nanion in it; an ionic compound is never formed between two cations only or two anions only.

Boronexists asabout20%boron-10(fiveprotonsandfiveneutronsin\nthe nuclei) and about 80% boron-11 (five protons and six neutrons in the nuclei).

Sulfur hexafluoride is also very easy to accurately detect, even at low\nlevels, and it is not a normal part of the atmosphere, so there is little potential for contamination from natural\nsources. Consequently, SF6 is also used as an aerial tracer for ventilation systems in buildings. It is nontoxic and\nvery chemically inert, so workers do not have to take special precautions other than watching for asphyxiation.\nSulfur hexafluoride also has another interesting use: a spark suppressant in high-voltage electrical equipment.\nHigh-pressure SF6 gas is used in place of older oils that may have contaminants that are environmentally\nunfriendly (part (c) in the accompanying figure).\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The atomic mass unit (u) is a unit that describes the masses of individual atoms and molecules.\n\u2022 The atomic mass is the weighted average of the masses of all isotopes of an element.\n\u2022 The molecular mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule. 111 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nExercises\nDefineatomic mass unit.

It consists of three parts:\n1.All matter is composed of atoms.\n2.Atoms of the same element are the same; atoms of different elements are different.\n3.Atoms combine in whole-number ratios to form compounds.\nThese concepts form the basis of chemistry.\nAlthoughthewordatomcomesfromaGreekwordthatmeans\u201cindivisible,\u201dweunderstandnowthatatomsthem-\nselves are composed ofsmaller parts called subatomic particles.The first part tobediscovered was the electron,\n\u2212\na tiny subatomic particle with a negative charge.

They are not arranged at random. Experiments by Ernest Rutherford\nin England in the 1910s pointed to a nuclear modelof the atom. The relatively massive protons and neutrons are\ncollected in the center of an atom, in a region called the nucleusof the atom (plural nuclei). The electrons are\noutsidethenucleusandspendtheirtimeorbitinginspaceaboutthenucleus.(SeeFigure3.1\u201cTheStructureofthe\nAtom\u201d.)\nFigure 3.1The Structure of the Atom\nAtoms have protons and neutrons in the center, making the nucleus, while the electrons orbit the nucleus.\nThe modern atomic theory states that atoms of one element are the same, while atoms of different elements are\ndifferent.Whatmakesatomsofdifferentelements different?

Thus, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, while iron has an\natomic number of 26. Each element has its own characteristic atomic number.\nAtoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons, however. Atoms of the same element (i.e.,\natoms with the same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most naturally\noccurring elements exist as isotopes. For example, most hydrogen atoms have a single proton in their nucleus.\nHowever,asmallnumber(aboutoneinamillion)ofhydrogenatomshaveaprotonandaneutronintheirnuclei.\nThis particular isotope of hydrogen is called deuterium.

If it also has six neutrons in\nthe nucleus, then the mass number is 6 +6, or 12.\n2.If the atomic number of uranium is 92, then that is the number of protons in the nucleus. Because\nthe mass number is 235, then the number of neutrons in the nucleus is 235 \u2212 92, or 143.\nTest Yourself\nThe number of protons in the nucleus of a tin atom is 50, while the number of neutrons in the nucleus is\n68. What are the atomic number and the mass number of this isotope?\nAnswer\nAtomic number = 50, mass number = 118\nWhen referring to an atom, we simply use the element\u2019s name: the term sodium refers to the element as well as\nan atom of sodium. But it can be unwieldy to use the name of elements all the time. Instead, chemistry defines\na symbol for each element. The atomic symbolis a one- or two-letter abbreviation of the name of the element.\nBy convention, the first letter of an element\u2019s symbol is always capitalized, while the second letter (if present)\nis lowercase. Thus, the symbol for hydrogen is H, the symbol for sodium is Na, and the symbol for nickel is Ni.\nMostsymbolscomefromtheEnglishnameoftheelement,althoughsomesymbolscomefromanelement\u2019sLatin\nname.(Thesymbolforsodium,Na,comesfromitsLatinname,natrium.)Table3.2\u201cNamesandSymbolsofCom-\nmon Elements\u201d lists some common elements and their symbols.

Predicting the products in some of\nthem may be difficult, but the reactions are still easy to recognize.\nA composition reaction(sometimes also called a combination reaction or a synthesis reaction) produces a single\nsubstance from multiple reactants. A single substance as a product is the key characteristic of the composition\nreaction. There may be a coefficient other than one for the substance, but if the reaction has only a single sub-\nstance as a product, it can be called a composition reaction. In the reaction\n2 H2(g) +O2(g) \u21922 H2O(\u2113)\nwater is produced from hydrogen and oxygen. Although there are two molecules of water being produced, there\nis only one substance\u2014water\u2014as a product.

Stoichiometry and the Mole\n193 Introduction to Stoichiometry and the Mole\n194 At Contrived State University in Anytown, Ohio, a new building was dedicated in March 2010 to house the Col-\nlege of Education. The 100,000-square-foot building has enough office space to accommodate 86 full-time fac-\nulty members and 167 full-time staff.\nInafitofmonetaryexcess,theuniversityadministrationofferedtobuynewfurniture(desksandchairs)andcom-\nputerworkstationsforallfacultyandstaffmembersmovingintothenewbuilding.However,tosaveonlong-term\nenergy and materials costs, the university offered to buy only 1 laser printer per 10 employees, with the plan to\nnetwork the printers together.\nHow many laser printers did the administration have to buy? It is rather simple to show that 26 laser printers\nare needed for all the employees. However, what if a chemist was calculating quantities for a chemical reaction?\nInterestingly enough, similar calculations can be performed for chemicals as well as laser printers.\nInfillinganewofficebuildingwithfurnitureandequipment,managersdocalculationssimilartothoseperformed\nby scientists doing chemical reactions.\nWe have already established that quantities are important in science, especially in chemistry. It is important to\nmake accurate measurements of a variety of quantities when performing experiments. However, it is also impor-\ntant to be able to relate one measured quantity to another, unmeasured quantity. In this chapter, we will consider\nhow we manipulate quantities to relate them to each other.\n195 Stoichiometry\nLearning Objectives\n1.Definestoichiometry.\n2.Relate quantities in a balanced chemical reaction on a molecular basis.\nConsider a classic recipe for pound cake: 1 pound of eggs, 1 pound of butter, 1 pound of flour, and 1pound of\nsugar. (That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \u201cpound cake.\u201d) If you have 4 pounds of butter, how many pounds of sugar, flour,\nand eggs do you need? You would need 4 pounds each of sugar, flour, and eggs.\nNow suppose you have 1.00 g H2. If the chemical reaction follows the balanced chemical equation\n2 H2(g) +O2(g) \u21922 H2O(\u2113)\nthen what mass of oxygen do you need to make water?\nCuriously,thischemicalreactionquestionisverysimilartothepoundcakequestion.Bothoftheminvolverelat-\ning a quantity of one substance to a quantity of another substance or substances. The relating of one chemical\nsubstance to another using a balanced chemical reaction is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometry is a funda-\nmental skill in chemistry; it greatly broadens your ability to predict what will occur and, more importantly, how\nmuch is produced.\nLet us consider a more complicated example. A recipe for pancakes calls for 2 cups (c) of pancake mix, 1 egg,\nand 1/2 c of milk. We can write this in the form of a chemical equation:\n2 c mix +1 egg +1/2 c milk \u21921 batch of pancakes\nIf you have 9 c of pancake mix, how many eggs and how much milk do you need? It might take a little bit of\nwork, but eventually you will find you need 4\u00bd eggs and 2\u00bc c milk.\nHow can we formalize this? We can make a conversion factor using our original recipe and use that conversion\nfactor to convert from a quantity of one substance to a quantity of another substance, similar to the way we con-\nstructed a conversion factor between feet and yards in Chapter 2 \u201cMeasurements\u201d. Because one recipe\u2019s worth\n196 197 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nof pancakes requires 2 c of pancake mix, 1 egg, and 1/2 c of milk, we actually have the following mathematical\nrelationships that relate these quantities:\n2 c pancake mix ? 1 egg ? 1/2 c milk\nwhere ? is the mathematical symbol for \u201cis equivalent to.\u201d This does not mean that 2 c of pancake mix equal 1\negg. However,asfar asthis recipe is concerned,these are the equivalent quantities needed fora single recipe of\npancakes.So,anypossiblequantitiesoftwoormoreingredientsmusthavethesamenumericalratioastheratios\nin the equivalence.\nWe can deal with these equivalences in the same way we deal with equalities in unit conversions: we can make\nconversionfactorsthatessentiallyequal1.Forexample,todeterminehowmanyeggsweneedfor9cofpancake\nmix, we construct the conversion factor:\nThis conversion factor is, in a strange way, equivalent to 1 because the recipe relates the two quantities. Starting\nwith our initial quantity and multiplying by our conversion factor,\nNote how the units cups pancake mix canceled, leaving us with units of eggs.

These conversions can be used to relate quantities of one substance to quantities of another. For\nexample,supposeweneedtoknowhowmanymoleculesofoxygenareneededtoreactwith16moleculesofH2.\nAs we did with converting units, we start with our given quantity and use the appropriate conversion factor:\nNotehowtheunitmoleculesH2cancelsalgebraically,justasanyunitdoesinaconversionlikethis.Theconver-\nsion factor came directly from the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.

As such, chemical equations also give us equiv-\nalences\u2014equivalences between the reactants and the products. However, now we understand that these equiva-\nlences are expressed in terms of moles. Consider the chemical equation\n2 H2+O2\u21922 H2O\nThis chemical reaction gives us the following equivalences:\n2 mol H2? 1 mol O2? 2 mol H2O\nAny two of these quantities can be used to construct a conversion factor that lets us relate the number of moles\nof one substance to an equivalent number of moles of another substance. If, for example, we want to know how\nmany moles of oxygen will react with 17.6 mol of hydrogen, we construct a conversion factor between 2 mol of\nH2and 1 mol of O2and use it to convert from moles of one substance to moles of another:\nNote how the mol H2 unit cancels, and mol O2 is the new unit introduced.

Tactics for working with mathematical formulas are different from tactics for working with\nconversion factors. First, most of the questions you will have to answer using formulas are word-type questions,\nso the first step is to identify what quantities are known and assign them to variables. Second, in most formulas,\nsome mathematical rearrangements (i.e., algebra) must be performed to solve for an unknown variable. The rule\nisthat tofindthevalue oftheunknownvariable, youmustmathematically isolate theunknownvariable byitself\nand in the numerator of one side of the equation. Finally, units must be consistent. For example, in Boyle\u2019s law\ntherearetwopressurevariables,andtheymusthavethesameunit.Therearealsotwovolumevariables;theyalso\nmust have the same unit. In most cases, it won\u2019t matter what the unit is, but the unit must be the same on both\nsides of the equation.\nEExxaammppllee 33\nAsampleofgashasaninitialpressureof2.44atmandaninitialvolumeof4.01L.Itspressurechangesto\n1.93atm.

One of them is temperature (T). One couldvary the temper-\nature of a gas sample and note what effect it has on the other properties of the gas. Early scientists did just this,\ndiscovering that iftheamount ofagasanditspressurearekeptconstant, thenchanging thetemperature changes\nthevolume(V).Astemperatureincreases,volumeincreases;astemperaturedecreases,volumedecreases.Wesay\nthat these two characteristics aredirectly related.\nAmathematicalrelationshipbetweenVandTshouldbepossibleexceptforonequestion:Whattemperaturescale\nshould we use? We know from Chapter 2 \u201cMeasurements\u201d that science uses several possible temperature scales.\nExperiments show that the volume of a gas is related to its absolute temperature in Kelvin, not its temperature\nin degrees Celsius. If the temperature of a gas is expressed in kelvins, then experiments show that the ratio of\nvolume to temperature is a constant: GAS LAWS \u2022 248\nWe can modify this equation as we modified Boyle\u2019s law: the initial conditions V1 and T1 have a certain value,\nandthevaluemustbethesamewhentheconditionsofthegasarechangedtosomenewconditionsV2andT2,as\nlong as pressure and the amount of the gas remain constant.

What is the new\nvolume if the temperature is increased to 559 K? Assume constant pressure and amount for the gas.\nSolution\nFirst, we assign the given values to their variables. The initial volume is V1, so V1 = 34.8 mL, and the\ninitial temperature is T1, so T1 = 315 K. The temperature is increased to 559 K, so the final temperature\nT2 = 559 K. We note that the temperatures are already given in kelvins, so we do not need to convert the\ntemperatures. Substituting into the expression for Charles\u2019s law yields\nWesolveforV2byalgebraically isolating theV2variable ononesideoftheequation.Wedothisbymul-\ntiplying both sides of the equation by 559 K (number and unit).

We know that as temperature increases, volume increases. Here, the tem-\nperature is increasing from 315 K to 559 K, so the volume should also increase, which it does.\nTest Yourself\nIfV1= 3.77 L andT1= 255 K, what isV2ifT2= 123 K?\nAnswer\n1.82 L\nIt is more mathematically complicated if a final temperature must be calculated because the T variable is in the\ndenominatorofCharles\u2019slaw.Thereareseveralmathematicalwaystoworkthis,butperhapsthesimplestwayis\nto take the reciprocal of Charles\u2019s law.

We must convert the initial temperature to\nkelvins:\n\u221267\u00b0C +273 = 206 K\nIn using the gas law, we must use T1 = 206 K as the temperature. Substituting into the reciprocal form of\nCharles\u2019s law, we get\nBringing the 25.0 L quantity over to the other side of the equation, we get\nThe L units cancel, so our final answer is\nT2= 148 K\nThis is also equal to \u2212125\u00b0C.

It is based on the following concepts:\n1.Gases consist of particles (molecules or atoms) that are in constant random motion.\n2.Gas particles are constantly colliding with each other and the walls of their container. These collisions are\nelastic; that is, there is no net loss of energy from the collisions.\n3.Gas particles are small and the total volume occupied by gas molecules is negligible relative to the total\nvolume of their container.\n4.There are no interactive forces (i.e., attraction or repulsion) between the particles of a gas.\n5.The average kinetic energy of gas particles is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas, and all\ngases at the same temperature have the same average kinetic energy.\nFigure 6.6 \u201cThe Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases\u201d shows a representation of how we mentally picture the gas\nphase.\n279 KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES \u2022 280\nThe kinetic molecular theory of gases describes this state of matter as composed of tiny particles in constant\nmotionwithalotofdistancebetweentheparticles.Becausemostofthevolumeoccupiedbyagasisemptyspace,\nagashasalowdensityandcanexpandorcontractundertheappropriateinfluence.Thefactthatgasparticlesare\ninconstantmotionmeansthattwoormoregaseswillalwaysmixastheparticlesfromtheindividualgasesmove\nandcollidewitheachother.Thenumberofcollisionsthegasparticlesmakewiththewallsoftheircontainerand\nthe force withwhich they collide determine the magnitude of the gas pressure.\nKKiinneettiicc EEnneerrggyy aanndd MMoolleeccuullaarr SSppeeeedd\nGasparticlesareinconstantmotion,andanyobjectinmotionhaskineticenergy(Ek).Kineticenergy,foranindi-\nvidual atom, can be calculated by the following equation where mis the mass, anduis the speed.\n2\nEk= 1/2mu\nOverallthemoleculesinasampleofagasshareanaveragekineticenergy;however,individualmoleculesexhibit\nadistributionofkineticenergiesbecauseofhavingadistributionofspeeds(Figure6.7\u201cStylizedmolecularspeed\ndistribution\u201d). This distribution of speeds arises from the collisions that occur between molecules in the gas\nphase.

The average speed (uav) is the mean speed of all gas molecules in the sample.\nThe root-mean-square (rms) speed (urms) corresponds to the speed of molecules having exactly the same kinetic\nenergy as the average kinetic energy of the sample. KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES \u2022 282\n1\nFigure 6.8 Distribution of molecular speeds, oxygen gas at -100, 20, and 600\u00b0C\nAccording to the kinetic molecular theory, the average kinetic energy of gas particles is proportional to the\nabsolutetemperature ofthegas.ThiscanbeexpressedwiththefollowingequationwherekrepresentstheBoltz-\nmann constant. The Boltzmann constant is simply the gas constant R divided by the Avogadro\u2019s constant (NA).\nThe bar above certain terms indicates they are average values.\nSinceaveragekineticenergyisrelatedbothtotheabsolutetemperatureandthemolecularspeed,wecancombine\nthe equation above with the previous one to determine the rms speed.\nThis demonstrates that the rms speed is related to the temperature. We can further manipulate this equation by\nmultiplyingthenumeratoranddenominatorbyAvogadro\u2019sconstant (NA)togiveusaformusingthegasconstant\n(R)and molar mass (M).\nThis form of the equation demonstrates that the rms speed of gas molecules is also related to the molar mass of\nthe substance. Comparing two gases of different molar mass at the same temperature, we see that despite having\nthe same average kinetic energy, the gas with the smaller molar mass will have a higher rms speed.\n2\nFigure 6.9 Molecular Speed Distribution of Noble Gases\n1.Adapted from Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution 1.png by Superborsuk/CC-BY-SA-3.0.\n2.Adapted from MaxwellBoltzmann-en.svg by Pdbailey/Public Domain 283 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nExample 19\nCalculate the rms speed of nitrogen molecules at 25\u00baC.Solution Knowing\n2 -2\nthat 1 J = 1 kg m s we can convert to metres per second:\nAAppppllyyiinngg tthhee KKiinneettiicc MMoolleeccuullaarr TThheeoorryy ttoo tthhee GGaass LLaawwss\nThekineticmoleculartheorycanbeusedtoexplainorpredicttheexperimentaltrendsthatwereusedtogenerate\nthe gas laws.

This means that the gas molecules will hit the container walls more frequently and\nwith greater force because they are all moving faster. This should increase the pressure. KINETIC MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES \u2022 284\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 The physical behaviour of gases is explained by the kinetic molecular theory of gases.\n\u2022 The number of collisions that gas particles make with the walls of their container and the force at\nwhich they collidedetermine the magnitude of the gas pressure.\n\u2022 Temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy.\nExercises\n1.State the ideas ofthe kinetic molecular theory of gases.\n2.Calculate the rms speed of CO2at 40\u00b0C.\n3.Using the kinetic molecular theory, explain how an increase in the number of moles of gas at con-\nstant volume and temperature affects the pressure.\nAAnnsswweerrss\n1.Gases consist of tiny particles of matter that are in constant motion. Gas particles are constantly\ncolliding with each other and the walls of a container. These collisions are elastic; that is, there is no\nnet loss of energy from the collisions. Gas particles are separated by large distances. The size of gas\nparticles is tiny compared to the distances that separate them and the volume of the container. There\nare no interactive forces (i.e., attraction or repulsion) between the particles of a gas. The average\nkinetic energy of gas particles is dependent on the temperature of the gas.\n2.421 m/s\n3.Temperature remains the same, so the average kinetic energy and the rms speed should remain the\nsame. Increasing the number of moles of gas means there are more molecules of gas available to col-\nlide with the walls of the container at any given time. Therefore pressure should increase.

In mathematical terms, FORMATION REACTIONS \u2022 306\nwhere np and nr are the number of moles of products and reactants, respectively (even if they are just 1 mol),\nand \u0394Hf,p and \u0394Hf,r are the enthalpies of formation of the product and reactant species, respectively. This prod-\nucts-minus-reactants scheme is very useful in determining the enthalpy change of any chemical reaction, if the\nenthalpy of formation data are available.

A fundamental concept is that every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in\nenergy. Now we need to learn how to properly express these energy changes.\nOurstudyofgasesinChapter6\u201cGases\u201dandourdefinitionofworkinSection7.2\u201cWorkandHeat\u201dindicatethat\nconditions like pressure, volume, and temperature affect the energy content of a system. What we need is a def-\ninition of energy that holds when some of these conditions are specified (somewhat similar to our definition of\nstandard temperature and pressure in our study of gases). We define the enthalpy change(\u0394H) as the heat of a\nprocess when pressure is held constant:\n\u0394H \u2261 q atconstantpressure\nTheletterHstandsfor\u201centhalpy,\u201dakindofenergy,whilethe\u0394impliesachangeinthequantity.Wewillalways\nbe interested in the change inH, rather than the absolute value ofHitself.\nWhenachemicalreactionoccurs,thereisacharacteristicchangeinenthalpy.Theenthalpychangeforareaction\nis typically written after a balanced chemical equation and on the same line. For example, when two moles of\nhydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to make two moles of water, the characteristic enthalpy change is 570\nkJ. We write the equation as\n2 H2(g) +O2(g) \u21922 H2O(\u2113) \u0394H=\u2212570 kJ\nA chemical equation that includes an enthalpy change is called a thermochemical equation.

It turns out that there are other equivalent\ndefinitions of work that are also important in chemistry.\nWhen a certain volume of a gas expands, it works against an external pressure to expand (Figure 7.2 \u201cVolume\nversus Pressure\u201d). That is, the gas must perform work. Assuming that the external pressure Pext is constant, the\namount of work done by the gas is given by the equation\nw= \u2212Pext\u00d7 \u0394V\nwhere \u0394Vis the change in volume of the gas. This term is always the final volume minus the initial volume,\n\u0394V=Vfinal\u2212Vinitial\nand can be positive or negative, depending on whether Vfinal is larger (is expanding) or smaller (is contracting)\nthan Vinitial. The negative sign in the equation for work is important and implies that as volume expands (\u0394V is\npositive),thegasinthesystemislosingenergyaswork.Ontheotherhand,ifthegasiscontracting,\u0394Visnega-\ntive, and the two negative signs make the work positive, so energy is being added to the system.\nFigure 7.2Volume versus Pressure\n330 331 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nWhen a gas expands against an external pressure, the gas does work.\nFinally, let us consider units. Volume changes are usually expressed in units like liters, while pressures are\nusually expressed in atmospheres. When we use the equation to determine work, the unit for work comes out\nas liter\u00b7atmospheres, or L\u00b7atm. This is not a very common unit for work. However, there is a conversion factor\nbetween L\u00b7atm and the common unit of work, joules:\n1 L\u00b7atm = 101.32 J\nUsingthisconversionfactorandthepreviousequationforwork,wecancalculatetheworkperformedwhenagas\nexpands or contracts.

For example, consider these two reactions:\n2 C(s) +2 O2(g) \u21922 CO2(g)\n2 CO2(g) \u21922 CO(g) +O2(g)\nIf we added these two equations by combining all the reactants together and all the products together, we would\nget\n2 C(s) +2 O2(g) +2 CO2(g) \u21922 CO2(g) +2 CO(g) +O2(g)\nWe note that 2 CO2(g) appears on both sides of the arrow, so they cancel:\n337 HESS\u2019S LAW \u2022 338\nWealsonotethatthereare2molofO2onthereactantside,and1molofO2ontheproductside.Wecancancel1\nmol of O2from both sides:\nWhat do we have left?\n2 C(s) +O2(g) \u21922 CO(g)\nThis is the reaction we are looking for! So by algebraically combining chemical equations, we can generate new\nchemical equations that may not be feasible to perform.\nWhat about the enthalpy changes? Hess\u2019s lawstates that when chemical equations are combined algebraically,\ntheir enthalpies can be combined in exactly the same way. Two corollaries immediately present themselves:\n1.If a chemical reaction is reversed, the sign on \u0394His changed.\n2.If a multiple of a chemical reaction is taken, the same multiple of the \u0394His taken as well.\nWhat are the equations being combined? The first chemical equation is the combustion of C, which produces\nCO2:\n2 C(s) +2 O2(g) \u21922 CO2(g)\nThis reaction is two times the reaction to make CO2from C(s) and O2(g), whose enthalpy change is known:\nC(s) +O2(g) \u2192CO2(g) \u0394H=\u2212393.5 kJ\nAccording to the first corollary, the first reaction has an energy change of two times \u2212393.5 kJ, or \u2212787.0 kJ:\n2 C(s) +2 O2(g) \u21922 CO2(g) \u0394H=\u2212787.0 kJ\nThe second reaction in the combination is related to the combustion of CO(g):\n2 CO(g) +O2(g) \u21922 CO2(g) \u0394H=\u2212566.0 kJ\nThe second reaction in our combination is the reverse of the combustion of CO. When we reverse the reaction,\nwe change the sign on the \u0394H:\n2 CO2(g) \u21922 CO(g) +O2(g) \u0394H=+566.0 kJ\nNowthatwehaveidentifiedtheenthalpychangesofthetwocomponentchemicalequations,wecancombinethe\n\u0394Hvalues and add them: 339 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nHess\u2019slawisverypowerful.Itallowsustocombineequationstogeneratenewchemicalreactionswhoseenthalpy\nchanges can be calculated, rather than directly measured.\nEExxaammppllee 1100\nDetermine the enthalpy change of\nC2H4+3 O2\u21922 CO2+2 H2O \u0394H=?\nfrom these reactions:\nC2H2+H2\u2192C2H4\u0394H=\u2212174.5 kJ\n2 C2H2+5 O2\u21924 CO2+2 H2O \u0394H=\u22121,692.2 kJ\n2 CO2+H2\u21922 O2+C2H2\u0394H=\u2212167.5 kJ\nSolution\nWewillstartbywritingchemicalreactionsthatputthecorrectnumberofmolesofthecorrectsubstanceon\nthe proper side.

This allows electron microscopes to magnify 600\u2013700\ntimes more than light microscopes. This allows us to see even smaller features in a world that is invisible to the\nnaked eye.\nAtomsactthewaytheydobecauseoftheirstructure.Wealreadyknowthatatomsarecomposedofprotons,neu-\ntrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, and electrons orbit around the nucleus. But\nwe need to know the structural details to understand why atoms react the way they do.\nVirtually everything we know about atoms ultimately comes from light. Before we can understand the composi-\ntion of atoms (especially electrons), we need to understand the properties of light.\n348 Organization of Electrons in Atoms\nDAVID W. BALL AND JESSIE A. KEY\nLearning Objectives\n1.Learn how electrons are organized in atoms.\n2.Represent the organization of electrons by an electron configuration.\nNow that you know that electrons have quantum numbers, how are they arranged in atoms? The key to under-\nstanding electronic arrangement is summarized in the Pauli exclusion principle: no two electrons in an atom can\nhave the same set of four quantum numbers. This dramatically limits the number of electrons that can exist in a\nshell or a subshell.\nElectronsaretypicallyorganizedaroundanatombystartingatthelowestpossiblequantumnumbersfirst,which\naretheshells-subshellswithlowerenergies.ConsiderH,anatomwithasingleelectrononly.Undernormalcondi-\ntions,thesingleelectronwouldgointothen=1shell,whichhasonlyasinglessubshellwithoneorbital(because\nm\u2113 can equal only 0). The convention is to label the shell-subshell combination with the number of the shell and\ntheletterthatrepresentsthesubshell.Thus,theelectrongoesinthe1sshell-subshellcombination.Itisusuallynot\nnecessarytospecifythem\u2113ormsquantumnumbers,butfortheHatom,theelectronhasm\u2113=0(theonlypossible\nvalue) and anmsof either +1/2 or \u22121/2.\nThe He atom has two electrons. The second electron can also go into the 1s shell-subshell combination but only\nif its spin quantum number is different from the first electron\u2019s spin quantum number. Thus, the sets of quantum\nnumbersforthetwoelectronsare{1,0,0,+1/2}and{1,0,0,\u22121/2}.Noticethattheoverallsetisdifferentforthe\ntwo electrons, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle.\nThenextatomisLi,withthreeelectrons.However,nowthePauliexclusionprincipleimpliesthatwecannotput\nthat electron in the 1s shell-subshell because no matter how we try, this third electron would have the same set\nof four quantum numbers as one of the first two electrons. So this third electron must be assigned to a different\nshell-subshell combination. However, the n = 1 shell doesn\u2019t have another subshell; it is restricted to having just\n349 ORGANIZATION OF ELECTRONS IN ATOMS \u2022 350\n\u2113 = 0, or an s subshell. Therefore, this third electron has to be assigned to the n = 2 shell, which has an s (\u2113 = 0)\nsubshell and a p (\u2113 = 1) subshell. Again, we usually start with the lowest quantum number, so this third electron\nis assigned to the 2sshell-subshell combination of quantum numbers.\nThe Pauli exclusion principle has the net effect of limiting the number of electrons that can be assigned a shell-\nsubshellcombinationofquantumnumbers.Forexample,inanyssubshell,nomatterwhattheshellnumber,there\ncan be a maximum of only two electrons. Once the s subshell is filled up, any additional electrons must go to\nanother subshell in the shell (if it exists) or to higher-numbered shell. A similar analysis shows that a p subshell\ncan hold a maximum of six electrons. A d subshell can hold a maximum of 10 electrons, while an f subshell can\nhaveamaximumof14electrons.Bylimitingsubshellstothesemaxima,wecandistributetheavailableelectrons\nto their shells and subshells.\nEExxaammppllee 44\nHow would the six electrons for C be assigned to thenand \u2113 quantum numbers?\nSolution\nThefirsttwoelectronsgointothe1sshell-subshellcombination.Twoadditionalelectronscangointothe\n2s shell-subshell, but now this subshell is filled with the maximum number of electrons. The n = 2 shell\nalso has a p subshell, so the remaining two electrons can go into the 2p subshell. The 2p subshell is not\ncompletely filled because it can hold a maximum of six electrons.\nTest Yourself\nHow would the 11 electrons for Na be assigned to thenand \u2113 quantum numbers?\nAnswer\ntwo 1selectrons, two 2selectrons, six 2pelectrons, and one 3selectron\nNow that we see how electrons are partitioned among the shells and subshells, we need a more concise way of\ncommunicating this partitioning.

There are three principles which should be followed to properly fill electron orbital energy diagrams:\n1.TheAufbau principle\n2.ThePauli exclusion principle\n3.Hund\u2019s rule\nThe overall pattern of the electron shell filling order emerges from the Aufbau principle (German for \u201cbuilding\nup\u201d): electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first. Increasing the principle quantum number, n, increases orbital\nenergy levels, as the electron density becomes more spread out away from the nucleus. In many-electron atoms\n(all atoms except hydrogen), the energy levels of subshells varies due to electron-electron repulsions.

A periodic table is shown in Figure 8.11 \u201cThe Periodic Table\u201d. The elements are listed by\natomicnumber(thenumberofprotonsinthenucleus),andelementswithsimilarchemicalpropertiesaregrouped\ntogether in columns.\nFigure 8.11The Periodic Table\n362 363 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nWhy does the periodic table have the structure it does? The answer is rather simple, if you understand electron\nconfigurations:the shape of the periodic table mimics the filling of the subshells with electrons.\n1 2\nLetusstartwithHandHe.Theirelectronconfigurationsare1s and1s ,respectively;withHe,then=1shellis\nfilled. These two elements make up the first row of the periodic table (see Figure 8.12 \u201cThe 1\u201d).\nFigure 8.12The 1sSubshell\nH and He represent the filling of the 1ssubshell.\nThe next two electrons, for Li and Be, would go into the 2s subshell. Figure 8.13 \u201cThe 2\u201d shows that these two\nelements are adjacent on the periodic table.\nFigure 8.13The 2sSubshell ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND THE PERIODIC TABLE \u2022 364\nIn Li and Be, the 2ssubshell is being filled.\nForthenextsixelements,the2psubshellisbeingoccupiedwithelectrons.Ontherightsideoftheperiodictable,\nthese six elements (B through Ne) are grouped together (Figure 8.14 \u201cThe 2\u201d).\nFigure 8.14The 2pSubshell 365 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nFor B through Ne, the 2psubshell is being occupied.\nThe next subshell to be filled is the 3s subshell. The elements when this subshell is being filled, Na and Mg, are\nback on the left side of the periodic table (Figure 8.15 \u201cThe 3\u201d).\nFigure 8.15The 3sSubshell\nNow the 3ssubshell is being occupied.\nNext, the 3psubshell is filled with the next six elements (Figure 8.16 \u201cThe 3\u201d).\nFigure 8.16The 3pSubshell ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND THE PERIODIC TABLE \u2022 366\nNext, the 3psubshell is filled with electrons.\nInstead of filling the 3dsubshell next, electrons go into the 4ssubshell (Figure 8.17 \u201cThe 4\u201d).\nFigure 8.17The 4sSubshell 367 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe 4ssubshell is filled before the 3dsubshell. This is reflected in the structure of the periodic table.\nAfter the 4s subshell is filled, the 3d subshell is filled with up to 10 electrons. This explains the section of 10\nelements in the middle of the periodic table (Figure 8.18 \u201cThe 3\u201d).\nFigure 8.18The 3dSubshell\nThe 3dsubshell is filled in the middle section of the periodic table.\nAndsoforth.Aswegoacrosstherowsoftheperiodictable,theoverallshapeofthetableoutlineshowtheelec-\ntrons are occupying the shells and subshells.\nThefirsttwocolumnsontheleftsideoftheperiodictablearewherethessubshellsarebeingoccupied.Because\nof this, the first two rows of the periodic table are labelled the s block. Similarly, the p blockare the right-most\nsix columns of the periodic table, the d blockis the middle 10 columns of the periodic table, while the fblockis\nthe14-columnsectionthatisnormallydepictedasdetachedfromthemainbodyoftheperiodictable.Itcouldbe\npart ofthe main body,butthen the periodic table wouldberather longandcumbersome. Figure 8.19\u201cBlocks on\nthe Periodic Table\u201dshows the blocks of the periodic table.\nFigure 8.19Blocks on the Periodic Table ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND THE PERIODIC TABLE \u2022 368\nThe periodic table is separated into blocks depending on which subshell is being filled for the atoms that belong\nin that section.\nThe electrons in the highest-numbered shell, plus any electrons in the last unfilled subshell, are called valence\nelectrons; the highest-numbered shell is called the valence shell. (The inner electrons are called core electrons.)\nThevalenceelectronslargelycontrolthechemistryofanatom.Ifwelookatjustthevalenceshell\u2019selectroncon-\nfiguration, we find that in each column, the valence shell\u2019s electron configuration is the same. For example, take\nthe elements in the first column of the periodic table: H, Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. Their electron configurations\n(abbreviated for the larger atoms) are as follows, with the valence shell electron configuration highlighted:\nH: 1s1\nLi: 1s22s1\nNa: [Ne]3s1\nK: [Ar]4s1\nRb: [Kr]5s1\nCs: [Xe]6s1\nThey all have a similar electron configuration in their valence shells: a single s electron. Because much of the\nchemistryofanelementisinfluencedbyvalenceelectrons,wewouldexpectthattheseelementswouldhavesim-\nilar chemistry\u2014and they do. The organization of electrons in atoms explains not only the shape of the periodic\ntable but also the fact that elements in the same column of the periodic table have similar chemistry. 369 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe same concept applies to the other columns of the periodic table. Elements in each column have the same\nvalenceshellelectronconfigurations,andtheelementshavesomesimilarchemicalproperties.Thisisstrictlytrue\nfor all elements in the s and p blocks. In the d and f blocks, because there are exceptions to the order of filling\nofsubshellswithelectrons,similarvalenceshellsarenotabsoluteintheseblocks.However,manysimilaritiesdo\nexist in these blocks, so a similarity in chemical properties is expected.\nSimilarity of valence shell electron configuration implies that we can determine the electron configuration of an\natomsolelybyitspositionontheperiodictable.ConsiderSe,asshowninFigure8.20\u201cSeleniumonthePeriodic\n4\nTable\u201d.

Incandescent lights and fluorescent lights generate light via\nthese two methods, respectively.\nA hot object gives off a continuum of light. We notice this when the visible portion of the electromagnetic spec-\ntrumispassedthroughaprism:theprismseparateslightintoitsconstituentcolors,andallcolorsarepresentina\ncontinuous rainbow (part (a) in Figure 8.3 \u201cPrisms and Light\u201d).

It turns out that every element has its own unique, characteristic line spectrum.\nFigure 8.3Prisms and Light\n(a) A glowing object gives off a full rainbow of colors, which are noticed only when light is passed through a\n375 QUANTUM NUMBERS FOR ELECTRONS \u2022 376\nprism to make a continuous spectrum. (b) However, when electricity is passed through a gas, only certain colors\nof light are emitted. Here are the colors of light in the line spectrum of Hg.\nWhy does the light emitted from an electrically excited gas have onlycertain colors, while light given offbyhot\nobjects has a continuous spectrum? For a long time, it was not well explained. Particularly simple was the spec-\ntrumofhydrogengas,whichcouldbedescribedeasilybyanequation;nootherelementhasaspectrumthatisso\npredictable (Figure 8.4 \u201cHydrogen Spectrum\u201d). Late-nineteenth-century scientists found that the positions of the\nlines obeyed a pattern given by the equation\nwheren= 3, 4, 5, 6,\u2026, but they could not explain why this was so.\nFigure 8.4Hydrogen Spectrum\nThe spectrum of hydrogen was particularly simple and could be predicted by a simple mathematical expression.\nIn 1913, the Danish scientist Niels Bohr suggested a reason why the hydrogen atom spectrum looked this way.\nHe suggested that the electron in a hydrogen atom could not have any random energy, having only certain fixed\nvaluesofenergythatwereindexedbythenumbern(thesamenintheequationaboveandnowcalledaquantum\nnumber). Quantities that have certain specific values are called quantized. Bohr suggested that the energy of the\nelectron in hydrogen was quantized because it was in a specific orbit. Because the energies of the electron can\nhave only certain values, the changes in energies can have only certain values (somewhat similar to a staircase:\nnot only are the stair steps set at specific heights but the height between steps is fixed).

However, later researchers generalized\nBohr\u2019s ideas into a new theory called quantum mechanics, which explains the behaviour of electrons as if they\nwere acting as a wave, not as particles. Quantum mechanics predicts two major things: quantized energies for\nelectrons of all atoms (not just hydrogen) and an organization of electrons within atoms. Electrons are no longer\nthoughtofasbeingrandomlydistributedaroundanucleusorrestrictedtocertainorbits(inthatregard,Bohrwas\nwrong). Instead, electrons are collected into groups and subgroups that explain much about the chemical behav-\niour of the atom.\nInthequantum-mechanicalmodelofanatom,thestateofanelectronisdescribedbyfourquantumnumbers,not\njust the one predicted by Bohr.

We know from experiments that light\nacts as a wave. As such, it can be described as having a frequency and a wavelength. The wavelengthof light is\nthe distance between corresponding points in two adjacent light cycles, and the frequencyof light is the number\nof cycles of light that pass a given point in one second. Wavelength is typically represented by \u03bb, the lowercase\nGreek letter lambda, while frequency is represented by \u03bd, the lowercase Greek letter nu (although it looks like a\nRoman\u201cvee,\u201ditisactually theGreekequivalent oftheletter \u201cen\u201d).Wavelength hasunitsoflength(meters,cen-\n\u22121\ntimeters, etc.), while frequency has units of per second, written as s and sometimes called a hertz (Hz). Figure\n8.1 \u201cCharacteristics of Light Waves\u201dshows how these two characteristics are defined.\nFigure 8.1Characteristics of Light Waves\n384 385 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nLight acts as a wave and can be described by a wavelength \u03bb and a frequency \u03bd.\nOne property of waves is that their speed is equal to their wavelength times their frequency. That means we have\nspeed = \u03bb\u03bd\nFor light, however, speed is actually a universal constant when light is traveling through a vacuum (or, to a very\n8 8\ngood approximation, air). The measured speed of light (c) in a vacuum is 2.9979 \u00d7 10 m/s, or about 3.00 \u00d7 10\nm/s.

It turns out that for light, the energy of the \u201cpackage\u201d of energy\nis proportional to its frequency. (For most waves, energy is proportional to wave amplitude, or the height of the\nwave.) The mathematical equation that relates the energy (E) of light to its frequency is\nE = h\u03bd\n\u221234\nwhere \u03bd is the frequency of the light, and h is a constant called Planck\u2019s constant.

The effective nuclear charge is always less than the actual\nnuclear charge, and can be roughly estimated using the following equation:\nZeff= Z \u2013 S\nWhere Z is the nuclear charge (equal to the number of protons), and S is the screening constant which can be\napproximated to the number of non-valence, \u201ccore\u201d electrons.\n390 391 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nExample:\nApproximate the effective nuclear charge of magnesium.\nSolution:\nFirst we must determine the electron configuration of magnesium to determine the number of core electrons.\n2 2 6 2 2 2 2 6\nMg =1s 2s 2p 3s = [Ne]3s , therefore magnesium has 10 core electrons from its 1s , 2s , 2p orbitals.\nMagnesium is element 12, so it has 12 protons and a nuclear charge of 12.\nZeff= 12 \u2013 10\nZeff= 2+\nMoving left to right across a period on the periodic table, each subsequent element has an additional proton and\nvalenceelectron,butthecoreelectronswhichareresponsibleforthemajorityofscreeningremainthesame.This\nresults in a trend that in general the effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across any period of the\nperiodic table.\nMovingfromtoptobottomdownacolumnoftheperiodictable,wemightexpecttheelements tohaveasimilar\neffectivenuclearchargeastheyallhavethesamenumberofvalenceelectrons.However,weactuallyseeaslight\nincrease inZeffmovingdownacolumnoftheperiodic table.

Chemical Bonds\n406 Introduction to Chemical Bonds\n407 Diamond is the hardest natural material known on Earth. Yet diamond is just pure carbon. What is special about\nthis element that makes diamond so hard?\nBonds. Chemical bonds.\nIn a perfect diamond crystal, each C atom makes four connections\u2014bonds\u2014to four other C atoms in a three-\ndimensionalmatrix.Fouristhegreatestnumberofbondsthatiscommonlymadebyatoms,soCatomsmaximize\ntheir interactions with other atoms.

Silicon dioxide and\nboron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond.\nDiamond is the hardest known natural substance and is composed solely of the\nelement carbon.\nSource: \u201cRough Diamond\u201d by United States Geological Survey is in the\npublic domain\nHowdoatomsmakecompounds?Typicallytheyjointogetherinsuchawaythattheylosetheiridentities asele-\nments and adopt a new identity as a compound. These joins are called chemical bonds. But how do atoms join\ntogether? Ultimately, it all comes down to electrons. Before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to intro-\nduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom.\n408 Lewis Electron Dot Diagrams\nLearning Objective\n1. Draw a Lewis electron dot diagram for an atom or a monatomic ion.\nIn almost all cases, chemical bonds are formed by interactions of valence electrons in atoms. To facilitate our\nunderstanding of how valence electrons interact, a simple way of representing those valence electrons would be\nuseful.\nALewiselectrondotdiagram(orelectrondotdiagramoraLewisdiagramoraLewisstructure)isarepresentation\nof the valence electrons of an atom that uses dots around the symbol of the element.

Its valence electron shell is 2s 2p , so it has three valence electrons. The third electron\nwill go on another side of the symbol:\nAgain, it does not matter on which sides of the symbol the electron dots are positioned.\nFor carbon, there are four valence electrons, two in the 2s subshell and two in the 2p subshell. As usual, we will\ndraw two dots together on one side, to represent the 2s electrons. However, conventionally, we draw the dots for\nthe twopelectrons on different sides. As such, the electron dot diagram for carbon is as follows:\nWith nitrogen, which has threepelectrons, we put a single dot on each of the three remaining sides:\nFor oxygen, which has four p electrons, we now have to start doubling up on the dots on one other side of the\nsymbol.

The astute reader may have noticed something: Many of the ions that\nform have eight electrons in their valence shell. Either atoms gain enough electrons to have eight electrons in\nthe valence shell and become the appropriately charged anion, or they lose the electrons in their original valence\nshell. The lower shell, now the valence shell, has eight electrons in it, so the atom becomes positively charged.\nFor whatever reason, having eight electrons in a valence shell is a particularly energetically stable arrangement\nofelectrons.Thetrendthatatomsliketohaveeightelectronsintheirvalenceshelliscalledtheoctetrule.When\natomsformcompounds,theoctetruleisnotalwayssatisfiedforallatomsatalltimes,butitisaverygoodruleof\nthumb for understanding the kinds of bonding arrangements that atoms can make.\nIt is not impossible to violate the octet rule. Consider sodium: in its elemental form, it has one valence electron\nand is stable. It is rather reactive, however, and does not require a lot of energy to remove that electron to make\n+ 2+\nthe Na ion. We could remove another electron by adding even more energy to the ion, to make the Na ion.\nHowever, that requires much more energy than is normally available in chemical reactions, so sodium stops at\n+\na 1+charge after losing a single electron. It turns out that the Na ion has a complete octet in its new valence\nshell, the n= 2shell, which satisfies the octet rule. The octet rule is a result oftrends in energies and is useful in\nexplaining why atoms form the ions that they do.\nNow consider an Na atom in the presence of a Cl atom. The two atoms have these Lewis electron dot diagrams\nand electron configurations:\n417 ELECTRON TRANSFER: IONIC BONDS \u2022 418\nFortheNaatomtoobtainanoctet,itmustloseanelectron;fortheClatomtogainanoctet,itmustgainanelec-\ntron. An electron transfers from the Na atom to the Cl atom:\n+ \u2212\nresulting in two ions\u2014the Na ion and the Cl ion:\nBoth species now have complete octets, and the electron shells are energetically stable. From basic physics, we\n+ \u2212\nknow that opposite charges attract. This is what happens to the Na and Cl ions:\nwhere we have written the final formula (the formula for sodium chloride) as per the convention for ionic com-\npounds, without listing the charges explicitly. The attraction between oppositely charged ions is called an ionic\nbond, and it is one of the main types of chemical bonds in chemistry. Ionic bonds are caused by electrons trans-\nferringfrom one atom to another.\nIn electron transfer, the number of electrons lost must equal the number of electrons gained. We saw this in the\nformation of NaCl. A similar process occurs between Mg atoms and O atoms, except in this case two electrons\nare transferred:\nThe two ions each have octets as their valence shell, and the two oppositely charged particles attract, making an\nionic bond:\nRemember, in the final formula for the ionic compound, we do not write the charges on the ions.\nWhataboutwhenanNaatominteractswithanOatom?TheOatomneedstwoelectronstocompleteitsvalence\noctet, but the Na atom supplies only one electron: 419 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe O atom still does not have an octet of electrons.

This creates an area of electron pair density between the two atoms. Since these\nelectrons are simultaneously attracted to both nuclei, the electron pair holds the two atoms together.\nLet\u2019s examine the simplest case of atomic overlap resulting in a covalent bond, the formation of H2 from two\nhydrogen atoms (Figure 9.6 \u201cA diagram showing the overlap of s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms to form H2\u201c).\nThe 1s orbitals of the twohydrogens approach each other and overlap to form a bond thathas cylindrical sym-\nmetry known as a sigma bond (\u03c3 bond). Repulsion forces between the two nuclei and between the two electrons\nare also present. The optimal distance between atoms, which maximizes the attractive forces and minimizes the\nrepulsive forces, gives the H-H sigma bond a length of 74 pm.\nFigure 9.6.

The phase diagram is a combination of\nthree curves: the vapour pressure curve, the melting curve and the sublimation curve.

Sometimes the attraction can be very strong. Adhesionis the tendency of a\nsubstance to interact with other substances because of intermolecular forces, while cohesionis the tendency of\na substance to interact with itself. If cohesive forces within a liquid are stronger than adhesive forces between a\nliquid and another substance, then the liquid tends to keep to itself; it will bead up. However, if adhesive forces\nbetweenaliquidandanothersubstancearestrongerthancohesiveforces,thentheliquidwillspreadoutoverthe\nothersubstance,tryingtomaximize theinterfacebetweentheothersubstanceandtheliquid.Wesaythattheliq-\nuidwetsthe other substance.\nAdhesion and cohesion are important for other phenomena as well. In particular, if adhesive forces are strong,\nthenwhenaliquidisintroducedtoasmall-diametertubeofanothersubstance,theliquidmovesupordowninthe\ntube, as if ignoring gravity. Because tiny tubes are called capillaries, this phenomenon is called capillary action.\nFor example, one type of capillary action\u2014capillary rise\u2014is seen when water or water-based liquids rise up in\nthin glass tubes (like the capillaries sometimes used in blood tests), forming an upwardly curved surface called\na meniscus.

Solids\nLearning Objectives\n1.Describe the general properties of a solid.\n2.Describe the six different types of solids.\nA solid is like a liquid in that particles are in contact with each other. Solids are unlike liquids in that the inter-\nmolecular forcesarestrongenoughtoholdtheparticles inplace.Atlowenoughtemperatures, allsubstancesare\nsolids(heliumistheloneexception),butthetemperatureatwhichthesolidstatebecomesthestablephasevaries\nwidely among substances, from 20 K (\u2212253\u00b0C) for hydrogen to over 3,900 K (3,600\u00b0C) for carbon.\nThe solid phase has several characteristics. First, solids maintain their shape. They do not fill their entire con-\ntainers like gases do, and they do not adopt the shape of their containers like liquids do. They cannot be easily\ncompressed like gases can, and they have relatively high densities.\nSolids may also demonstrate a variety of properties. For example, many metals can be beaten into thin sheets or\ndrawnintowires,whilecompoundssuchasNaClwillshatteriftheyarestruck.Somemetals,suchassodiumand\npotassium, are rather soft, while others, such as diamond, are very hard and can easily scratch other substances.\nAppearances differ as well: most metals are shiny and silvery, but sulfur (a nonmetal) is yellow, and ionic com-\npoundscantakeonarainbowofcolors.Solidmetalsconductelectricityandheat,whileionicsolidsdonot.Many\nsolidsareopaque,butsomearetransparent.Somedissolveinwater,butsomedonot.Figure10.15\u201cPropertiesof\nSolids\u201dshows two solids that exemplify the similar and dissimilar properties of solids.\nFigure 10.15Properties of Solids\n499 SOLIDS \u2022 500\na) Sodium metal is silvery, soft, and opaque and conducts electricity and heat well. (b) NaCl is transparent, hard, and colorless\nand does not conduct electricity or heat well in the solid state. These two substances illustrate the range of properties that solids\ncan have.\nSource: \u201cSodium\u201d by Mrs Pugliano is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic; \u201cHalite(Salt)\u201d\nis in the public domain;\nSolids can have a wide variety of physical properties because there are different types of solids. Here we will\nreview the different types of solids and the bonding that gives them their properties.\nFirst, we must distinguish between two general types of solids. An amorphous solidis a solid with no long-term\nstructure or repetition. Examples include glass and many plastics, both of which are composed of long chains of\nmolecules with no order from one molecule to the next. A crystalline solidis a solid that has a regular, repeating\nthree-dimensional structure. A crystal of NaCl (see Figure 10.13 \u201cProperties of Solids\u201d) is one example: at the\n+ \u2212\natomic level, NaCl is composed of a regular three-dimensional array of Na ions and Cl ions.\nThereisonlyonetypeofamorphoussolid.However,thereareseveraldifferenttypesofcrystallinesolids,depend-\ning on the identity of the units that compose the crystal.\nAnionicsolidisacrystallinesolidcomposedofions(eveniftheionsarepolyatomic).NaClisanexampleofan\n+ \u2212\nionic solid (Figure 10.16 \u201cAn Ionic Solid\u201d). The Na ions and Cl ions alternate in three dimensions, repeating\na pattern that goes on throughout the sample. The ions are held together by the attraction of opposite charges\u2014a\nvery strong force. Hence most ionic solids have relatively high melting points; for example, the melting point of\nNaCl is 801\u00b0C. Ionic solids are typically very brittle. To break them, the very strong ionic attractions need to be\n\u221210\nbroken; a displacement of only about 1 \u00d7 10 m will move ions next to ions of the same charge, which results\ninrepulsion. Ionic solids donotconduct electricity intheir solid state; however,inthe liquid state andwhendis-\nsolved in some solvent, they do conduct electricity. This fact originally promoted the idea that some substances\nexist as ionic particles.\nFigure 10.16An Ionic Solid 501 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\n+ \u2212\nNaClisasolidcomposedofathree-dimensional arrayofalternating Na ions(green)andCl ions(purple)held\ntogether by the attraction of opposite charges.\nAmolecularsolidisacrystallinesolidwhosecomponentsarecovalentlybondedmolecules.Manymolecularsub-\nstances,especiallywhencarefullysolidifiedfromtheliquidstate,formsolidswherethemoleculeslineupwitha\nregularfashionsimilartoanioniccrystal,buttheyarecomposedofmoleculesinsteadofions.Becausetheinter-\nmolecular forces between molecules are typically less strong than in ionic solids, molecular solids typically melt\nat lower temperatures and are softer than ionic solids. Ice is an example of a molecular solid. In the solid state,\nthemoleculeslineupinaregularpattern(Figure10.17\u201cMolecularSolids\u201d).Someverylargemolecules,suchas\nbiological molecules, will form crystals only if they are very carefully solidified from the liquid state or, more\nusually, from a dissolved state; otherwise, they will form amorphous solids.\nFigure 10.17Molecular Solids SOLIDS \u2022 502\nWater molecules line up in a regular pattern to form molecular solids. The dotted lines show how the polar O\u2013H\ncovalentbondsinonemoleculeengageinhydrogenbondingwithothermolecules.TheOatomsarered,andthe\nH atoms are white.\nSome solids are composed of atoms of one or more elements that are covalently bonded together in a seemingly\nnever-ending fashion. Such solids are called covalent network solids. Each piece of the substance is essentially\none huge molecule, as the covalent bonding in the crystal extends throughout the entire crystal. The two most\ncommonlyknowncovalentnetworksolidsarecarboninitsdiamondformandsilicondioxide(SiO2).Figure10.18\n\u201cCovalent Network Solids\u201d shows the bonding in a covalent network solid. Generally, covalent network solids\nare poor conductors of electricity, although their ability to conduct heat is variable: diamond is one of the most\nthermallyconductivesubstancesknown,whileSiO2isabout100timeslessthermallyconductive.Mostcovalent\nnetwork solids are very hard, as exemplified by diamond, which is the hardest known substance. Covalent net-\nworksolidshavehighmeltingpointsbyvirtueoftheirnetworkofcovalentbonds,allofwhichwouldhavetobe\nbroken for them to transform into a liquid. Indeed, covalent network solids are among the highest-melting sub-\nstancesknown:themeltingpointofdiamondisover3,500\u00b0C,whilethemeltingpointofSiO2isaround1,650\u00b0C.\nThese characteristics are explained by the network of covalent bonds throughout the sample. 503 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nFigure 10.18Covalent Network Solids\nDiamond is a covalent network solid, with each C atom making four covalent bonds to four other C atoms.

There is some concern today that there is too much salt in\nthediet; itisestimated thattheaverage personconsumes atleast threetimes asmuchsaltdailythanisnecessary\nfor proper bodily function.\nTheothertworocksweeatarerelated:sodiumbicarbonate(NaHCO3)andsodiumcarbonate(Na2CO3).However,\nwe do not mine these substances directly from the ground; we mine trona, whose chemical formula is\nNa3H(CO3)2.ThissubstanceisdissolvedinwaterandtreatedwithCO2gastomakeeitherNa2CO3orNaHCO3.\nAnother process, called the Solvay process, is also used to make Na2CO3. In the Solvay process, NH3 and CO2\nare added to solutions of NaCl to make NaHCO3 and NH4Cl; the NaHCO3 precipitates and is heated to produce\nNa2CO3. Either way, we get these two products from the ground (i.e., rocks).\nNaHCO3isalsoknownasbakingsoda,whichisusedinmanybakedgoods.Na2CO3isusedinfoodstoregulate\nthe acid balance. It is also used in laundry (where it is called washing soda) to interact with other ions in water\nthat tend to reduce detergent efficiency. 505 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Solids can be divided into amorphous solids and crystalline solids.\n\u2022 Crystalline solids can be ionic, molecular, covalent network, or metallic.\nExercises\n1.\nWhat is the difference between a crystalline solid and an amorphous solid?\n2.\nWhat two properties do solids have in common?

Then we can use\n\u0394Hfus as a conversion factor. Because the substance is melting, the process is endothermic, so the energy\nchange will have a positive sign.\n45.7gH2O \u00d7 (1molH2O/18.0g H2O) \u00d7 (6.01kJ/ 1mol H2O) = 15.3kJ\nWithout a sign, the number is assumed to be positive.\nTest Yourself\nWhat is the energy change when 108 g of C6H6freeze at 5.5\u00b0C?\nAnswer\n\u221213.8 kJ\nDuring melting, energy goes exclusively to changing the phase of a substance; it does not go into changing the\ntemperatureofasubstance.Hencemeltingisanisothermalprocessbecauseasubstancestaysatthesametemper-\nature. Only when all of a substance is melted does any additional energy go to changing its temperature.\nWhathappenswhenasolidbecomesaliquid?Inasolid,individualparticlesarestuckinplacebecausetheinter-\nmolecular forces cannot be overcome by the energy of the particles. When more energy is supplied (e.g., by\nraising the temperature), there comes a point at which the particles have enough energy to move around but not\nenoughenergytoseparate.Thisistheliquidphase:particlesarestillincontactbutareabletomovearoundeach\nother. This explains why liquids can assume the shape of their containers: the particles move around and, under\nthe influence of gravity, fill the lowest volume possible (unless the liquid is in a zero-gravity environment\u2014see\nFigure 10.3 \u201cLiquids and Gravity\u201d).\nFigure 10.3Liquids and Gravity PHASE TRANSITIONS: MELTING, BOILING, AND SUBLIMING \u2022 510\n(a) A liquid fills the bottom of its container as it is drawn downward by gravity and the\nparticles slide over each other. (b) A liquid floats in a zero- gravity environment. The\nparticles still slide over each other because they are in the liquid phase, but now there\nis no gravity to pull them down. Source: \u201cGlass of Water\u201d by Derek Jensen is in the\npublic domain; \u201cClayton Anderson zero g\u201d s in the public domain because it was\nsolely created by NASA.\nThe phase change between a liquid and a gas has some similarities to the phase change between a solid and a\nliquid. At a certain temperature, the particles in a liquid have enough energy to become a gas. The process of a\nliquid becoming a gas is called boiling (or vapourization), while the process of a gas becoming a liquid is called\ncondensation.However,unlikethesolid/liquidconversionprocess,theliquid/gasconversionprocessisnoticeably\naffected by the surrounding pressure on the liquid because gases are strongly affected by pressure. This means\nthat the temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas, the boiling point, can change with surrounding pressure.\nTherefore,wedefinethenormalboilingpointasthetemperatureatwhichaliquidchangestoagaswhenthesur-\nroundingpressureisexactly1atm,or760torr.Unlessotherwisespecified,itisassumedthataboilingpointisfor\n1 atm of pressure.\nLikethesolid/liquidphasechange,theliquid/gasphasechangeinvolvesenergy.Theamountofenergyrequiredto\nconvert a liquid to a gas is called the enthalpy of vapourization(or heat of vapourization), represented as \u0394Hvap.\nSome \u0394Hvap values are listed in Table 10.3 \u201cEnthalpies of Vaporization for Various Substances\u201d; it is assumed\nthat these values are for the normal boiling point temperature of the substance, which is also given in the table.\nThe unit for \u0394Hvap is also kilojoules per mole, so we need to know the quantity of material to know how much\nenergy is involved. The \u0394Hvap is also always tabulated as a positive number. It can be used for both the boiling\nand the condensation processes as long as you keep in mind that boiling is always endothermic (so \u0394H will be\npositive), while condensation is always exothermic (so \u0394Hwill be negative).\nTable 10.3Enthalpies of Vaporization for Various Substances 511 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nSubstance (Normal Boiling Point) \u0394Hvap(kJ/mol)\nWater (100\u00b0C) 40.68\nBromine (59.5\u00b0C) 15.4\nBenzene (80.1\u00b0C) 30.8\nEthanol (78.3\u00b0C) 38.6\nMercury (357\u00b0C) 59.23\nEExxaammppllee 33\nWhat is the energy change when 66.7 g of Br2(g) condense to a liquid at 59.5\u00b0C?\nSolution\nThe\u0394HvapofBr2is15.4kJ/mol.Eventhoughthisisacondensationprocess,wecanstillusethenumerical\nvalue of \u0394Hvap as long as we realize that we must take energy out, so the \u0394H value will be negative.

So boiling is also an isothermal process. Only when all of a substance\nhas boiled does any additional energy go to changing its temperature.\nWhathappenswhenaliquidbecomesagas?Wehavealreadyestablishedthataliquidiscomposedofparticlesin\ncontact with each other. When a liquid becomes a gas, the particles separate from each other, with each particle\ngoing its own way in space. This is how gases tend to fill their containers. Indeed, in the gas phase most of the\nvolume is empty space; only about 1/1,000th of the volume is actually taken up by matter (Figure 10.4 \u201cLiquids\nand Gases\u201d). It is this property of gases that explains why they can be compressed, a fact that is considered in\nChapter 6 \u201cGases\u201d.\nFigure 10.4Liquids and Gases PHASE TRANSITIONS: MELTING, BOILING, AND SUBLIMING \u2022 512\nIn(a),theparticlesarealiquid;theparticlesareincontactbutarealsoabletomovearoundeachother.In(b),the\nparticles are a gas, and most of the volume is actually empty space. The particles are not to scale; in reality, the\ndots representing the particles would be about 1/100th the size as depicted.\nUndersomecircumstances,thesolidphasecantransitiondirectlytothegasphasewithoutgoingthroughaliquid\nphase, and a gas can directly become a solid. The solid-to-gas change is called sublimation, while the reverse\nprocessiscalleddeposition.Sublimationisisothermal,liketheotherphasechanges.Thereisameasurableenergy\nchange during sublimation; this energy change is called the enthalpy of sublimation, represented as \u0394Hsub. The\nrelationship between the \u0394Hsuband the other enthalpy changes is as follows:\n\u0394Hsub= \u0394Hfus+\u0394Hvap\nAs such, \u0394Hsubis not always tabulated because it can be simply calculated from \u0394Hfusand \u0394Hvap.\nThereareseveralcommonexamplesofsublimation.Awell-knownproduct\u2014dryice\u2014isactuallysolidCO2.Dry\nice is dry because it sublimes, with the solid bypassing the liquid phase and going straight to the gas phase.

(Mass is a factor as well.)\nMolecules with a permanent dipole moment experience dipole-dipole interactions, which are generally stronger\nthan dispersion forces if all other things are equal.

Solutions, however, have\na lower vapour pressure than the pure solvent has, and the amount of lowering is dependent on the fraction of\nsolute particles, as long as the solute itself does not have a significant vapour pressure (the term nonvolatile is\nused to describe such solutes). This colligative property is called vapour pressure depression(or lowering).

As a review, recall the\ndefinition of molality:\nBecausethevapourpressureofasolutionwithanonvolatilesoluteisdepressedcomparedtothatofthepuresol-\nvent, it requires a higher temperature for the solution\u2019s vapour pressure to reach 1.00 atm (760 torr).

The freezing point of a solution is lower than the freezing point of the pure solvent. Think of\nthisbyassumingthatsoluteparticlesinterferewithsolventparticlescomingtogethertomakeasolid,soittakesa\nlower temperature to get the solvent particles to solidify. This is calledfreezing point depression.\nThe equation to calculate the change in the freezing point for a solution is similar to the equation for the boiling\npoint elevation:\n\u0394Tf=mKf\nwhere m is the molality of the solution and Kf is called the freezing point depression constant, which is also a\ncharacteristic of the solvent.

A semipermeable mem-\nbraneis a thin membrane that will pass certain small molecules but not others. A thin sheet of cellophane, for\nexample, acts as a semipermeable membrane.\nConsider the system in Figure 11.3 \u201cOsmosis\u201da. A semipermeable membrane separates two solutions having the\ndifferentconcentrations marked.Curiously,thissituation isnotstable; thereisatendency forwatermolecules to\nmovefromthediluteside(ontheleft)totheconcentratedside(ontheright)untiltheconcentrationsareequalized,\nasinFigure11.3\u201cOsmosis\u201db.Thistendency iscalled osmosis.Inosmosis, thesolute remains initsoriginal side\nof the system; only solvent molecules move through the semipermeable membrane.

The pressure exerted by the different height\nof the solution on the right is called the osmotic pressure.\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is easy to calculate:\n\u03a0 =MRT\nwhere \u03a0 is the osmotic pressure of a solution, M is the molarity of the solution, R is the ideal gas law constant, COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES OF SOLUTIONS \u2022 536\nand T is the absolute temperature.

M. Guldberg and P. Waage noted a peculiar relationship between the\namounts of reactants and products in an equilibrium. No matter how many reactants they started with, a certain\nratioofreactantsandproductswasachievedatequilibrium.Today,wecallthisobservationthelawofmassaction.\nIt relates the amounts of reactants and products at equilibrium for a chemical reaction. For a general chemical\nreaction occurring in solution,\naA+bB ? cC+dD\ntheequilibrium constant, also known asKeq, is defined by the following expression:\nwhere [A] is the molar concentration of species A at equilibrium, and so forth. The coefficients a, b, c, and d in\nthechemicalequationbecomeexponentsintheexpressionforKeq.TheKeqisacharacteristicnumericalvaluefor\nagivenreactionatagiventemperature;thatis,eachchemicalreactionhasitsowncharacteristicKeq.Theconcen-\ntrationofeachreactantandproductinachemical reactionatequilibriumisrelated;theconcentrations cannotbe\nrandomvalues,buttheydependoneachother.ThenumeratoroftheexpressionforKeqhastheconcentrationsof\nevery product (however many products there are), while the denominator of the expression for Keq has the con-\ncentrations of every reactant, leading to the commonproducts over reactantsdefinition for theKeq.\nLet us consider a simple example.

Suppose the numerical value of Keq for this chemical\nreaction is 2.0. If [B] = 4.0 M, then [A] must equal 2.0 M so that the value of the fraction equals 2.0:\nBy convention, the units are understood to be M and are omitted from the Keq expression. Suppose [B] were 6.0\nM. For the Keq value to remain constant (it is, after all, called the equilibrium constant), then [A] would have to\nbe 3.0 M at equilibrium:\nIf [A] were not equal to 3.0 M, the reaction would not be at equilibrium, and a net reaction would occur until\nthat ratio was indeed 2.0. At that point, the reaction is at equilibrium, and any net change would cease.

This expression may\nlook formidable, but first we can simplify the denominator and write it as a perfect square as well:\nThe fraction is a perfect square, as is the 4.0 on the right. So we can take the square root of both sides:\nNow we rearrange and solve (be sure you can follow each step):\nNow we have to remind ourselves what x is\u2014the amount of H2 and Cl2 that reacted\u2014and 2x is the equilibrium\n[HCl].Todeterminetheequilibriumconcentrations,weneedtogobackandevaluatetheexpressions1\u2212xand2x\nto get the equilibrium concentrations of our species:\n1.0 \u2212x= 1.0 \u2212 0.50 = 0.50 M = [H2] = [Cl2]\n2x= 2(0.50) = 1.0 M = [HCl]\nThe units are assumed to be molarity.

Oxidation and Reduction\n669 Introduction to Oxidation and Reduction\n670 Most of us are familiar with rusty iron: metal that has a dark red-brown scale that falls off an object, ultimately\nweakening it. Although we usually attribute rusting exclusively to iron, this process occurs with many materials.\nThe more formal term for rusting iscorrosion.\nThese support beams on a bridge are obviously rusted. If the rusting becomes too bad, it will compromise the integrity of the\nbridge, requiring replace- ment.\nSource: \u201crusty bridge bearing\u201d by Fabian is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0\nGeneric\nCorrosion is defined as the disintegration of a material due to chemical reactions with other substances in the\nenvironment. In many cases, oxygen in the air causes the disintegration. Corrosion is not uniformly destructive.\nAlthoughthecorrosionofironisgenerallyconsideredbad,thecorrosionofaluminumandcopperformsaprotec-\ntive barrier on the surface of the metal, protecting it from further reaction with the environment.\nHaving said that, it has been estimated that as much as 5% of expenditures in the United States apply to fixing\nproblems caused bycorrosion. Thereplacement ofstructures built withiron,steel, aluminum, andconcrete must\nbe performed regularly to keep these structures safe. As an example of what might happen, consider the story of\nthe Silver Bridge on US Interstate 35, connecting West Virginia and Ohio. On December 15, 1967, the 39-year-\nold bridge collapsed, killing 46 people. The ultimate cause of the collapse was determined to be corrosion of a\nsuspension chain on the Ohio side of the bridge.\n671 INTRODUCTION TO OXIDATION AND REDUCTION \u2022 672\nCorrosion is an example of the type of chemical reaction discussed in this chapter. Although we usually think of\ncorrosion as bad, the reaction it typifies can actually be put to good use.\nOne important type of chemical reaction is the oxidation-reduction reaction, also known as the redox reaction.\nAlthough we introduced redox reactions in Chapter 4 \u201cChemical Reactions and Equations\u201d, Section 4.6 \u201cOxida-\ntion-Reduction Reactions\u201d, it is worth reviewing some basic concepts. Balancing Redox Reactions\nLearning Objectives\n1.Learn to balanced simple redox reactions by inspection.\n2.Learn to balance complex redox reactions by the half reaction method.\n3.Use the solvent, or parts of it, as a reactant or a product in balancing a redox reaction.\nBalancing simple redox reactions can be a straightforward matter of going back and forth between products and\nreactants. For example, in the redox reaction of Na and Cl2:\nNa +Cl2\u2192NaCl\nit should be immediately clear that the Cl atoms are not balanced. We can fix this by putting the coefficient 2 in\nfront of the product:\nNa +Cl2\u21922 NaCl\nHowever,nowthesodiumisunbalanced.Thiscanbefixedbyincludingthecoefficient2infrontoftheNareac-\ntant:\n2 Na +Cl2\u21922 NaCl\nThisreactionisnowbalanced.Thatwasfairlystraightforward;wesaythatweareabletobalancethereactionby\ninspection. Many simple redox reactions can be balanced by inspection.\nEExxaammppllee 33\nBalance this redox reaction by inspection.\nSO2+O2\u2192SO3\nSolution\n673 BALANCING REDOX REACTIONS \u2022 674\nThereisoneSatomonbothsidesoftheequation,sothesulfurisbalanced.However,thereactantsidehas\nfour O atoms while the product side has three. Clearly we need more O atoms on the product side, so let\nus start by including the coefficient 2 on the SO3:\nSO2+O2\u21922 SO3\nThis now gives us six O atoms on the product side, and it also imbalances the S atoms. We can balance\nboth the elements by adding coefficient 2 on the SO2on the reactant side:\n2 SO2+O2\u21922 SO3\nThisgivesustwoSatomsonbothsidesandatotalofsixOatomsonbothsidesofthechemicalequation.\nThis redox reaction is now balanced.\nTest Yourself\nBalance this redox reaction by inspection.\nAl +O2\u2192Al2O3\nAnswer\n4 Al +3 O2\u21922 Al2O3\nThefirstthingyoushoulddowhenencounteringanunbalancedredoxreactionistotrytobalanceitbyinspection.\nSome redox reactions are not easily balanced by inspection. Consider this redox reaction:\n+ 3+\nAl +Ag \u2192Al +Ag\nAtfirstglance, thisequation seems balanced: thereisoneAgatomonbothsidesandoneAlatomonbothsides.\nHowever, if you look at the total charge on each side, there is a charge imbalance: the reactant side has a total\ncharge of 1+, while the product side has a total charge of 3+. Something is amiss with this chemical equation;\ndespite the equal number of atoms on each side, it is not balanced.\nA fundamental point about redox reactions that has not arisen previously is that the total number of electrons\nbeing lost must equal the total number of electrons being gained for a redox reaction to be balanced. This is not\n3+\nthecaseforthealuminumandsilverreaction:theAlatomlosesthreeelectronstobecometheAl ion,whilethe\n+\nAg ion gains only one electron to become elemental silver.\nTo balance this, we will write each oxidation and reduction reaction separately, listing the number of electrons\nexplicitly in each. Individually, the oxidation and reduction reactions are called half reactions. We will then take\nmultiples of each reaction until the number of electrons on each side cancels completely and combine the half\nreactions into an overall reaction, which should then be balanced. This method of balancing redox reactions is\ncalled the half reaction method. (There are other ways of balancing redox reactions, but this is the only one that\nwill be used in this text. The reason for this will be seen in Chapter 14 \u201cOxidation and Reduction\u201d, Section 14.3\n\u201cApplications of Redox Reactions: Voltaic Cells\u201d.)\nThe oxidation half reaction involves aluminum, which is being oxidized:\n3+\nAl \u2192Al 675 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThishalfreactionisnotcompletelybalancedbecausetheoverallchargesoneachsidearenotequal.WhenanAl\n3+\natom is oxidized to Al , it loses three electrons. We can write these electrons explicitly as products:\n3+ \u2212\nAl \u2192Al +3e\nNow this half reaction is balanced\u2014in terms of both atoms and charges.\nThe reduction half reaction involves silver:\n+\nAg \u2192Ag\nThe overall charge is not balanced on both sides. But we can fix this by adding one electron to the reactant side\n+\nbecause the Ag ion must accept one electron to become the neutral Ag atom:\n+ \u2212\nAg +e \u2192Ag\nThis half reaction is now also balanced.\nWhencombiningthetwohalfreactionsintoabalancedchemicalequation,thekeyisthatthetotalnumberofelec-\ntrons must cancel, so the number of electrons lost by atoms are equal to the number of electrons gained by other\natoms. This may require we multiply one or both half reaction(s) by an integer to make the number of electrons\non each side equal. With three electrons as products and one as reactant, the least common multiple of these two\nnumbers is three: we can use a single aluminum reaction but must take three times the silver reaction:\n3+ \u2212\nAl \u2192Al +3e\n+ \u2212\n3 \u00d7 [Ag +e \u2192Ag]\nThe 3 on the second reaction is distributed to all species in the reaction:\n3+ \u2212\nAl \u2192Al +3e\n+ \u2212\n3Ag +3e \u21923Ag\nNowthetwohalfreactionscanbecombinedjustliketwoalgebraicequations,withthearrowservingastheequals\nsign. The same species on opposite sides of the arrow can be canceled:\n+ 3+\nAl+3Ag +3e\u2212\u2192Al +3Ag+3e\u2212\nThe net balanced redox reaction is as follows:\n+ 3+\nAl +3Ag \u2192Al +3Ag\nThere is still only one Al atom on each side of the chemical equation, but there are now three Ag atoms, and\nthe total charge on each side of the equation is the same (3+for both sides). This redox reaction is balanced. It\ntook more effort to use the half reaction method than by inspection, but the correct balanced redox reaction was\nobtained.

Chromium is being oxidized, and iron is being reduced:\n3+\nCr \u2192Cr oxidation\n2+\nFe \u2192Fe reduction\nThen we include the appropriate number of electrons on the proper side to balance the charges for each\nreaction:\n3+ \u2212\nCr \u2192Cr +3e\n2+ \u2212\nFe +2e \u2192Fe\nThefirstreactioninvolvesthreeelectrons,whilethesecondreactioninvolvestwoelectrons.Theleastcom-\nmon multiple of these two numbers is six, so to get six electrons in each reaction we need to double the\nfirst reaction and triple the second one:\n3+ \u2212 3+ \u2212\n2 \u00d7 [Cr \u2192Cr +3e ] = 2 Cr \u21922 Cr +6e\n2+ \u2212 2+ \u2212\n3 \u00d7 [Fe +2e \u2192Fe] = 3 Fe +6e \u21923 Fe\nWe can combine the two final reactions, noting that the electrons cancel:\n2+ 3+\n2 Cr+3 Fe +6e\u2212\u21922 Cr +3 Fe+6e\u2212\nThe overall, balanced redox reaction is\n2+ 3+\n2 Cr +3 Fe \u21922 Cr +3 Fe\nTest Yourself\nBalance this redox reaction by using the half reaction method.\n2\u2212 \u2212\nO +F2\u2192O2+F\nAnswer\n2\u2212 \u2212\n2 O +2 F2\u2192O2+4 F\nManyredoxreactions occur inaqueous solution\u2014in water.Because ofthis, inmany cases H2Oorafragment of\n+ \u2212\nanH2Omolecule(H orOH ,inparticular)canparticipate intheredoxreaction.Assuch,weneedtolearnhow\nto incorporate the solvent into a balanced redox equation.\nConsider the following oxidation half reaction in aqueous solution, which has one Cr atom on each side:\n3+ \u2212\nCr \u2192CrO4\nHere,theCratomisgoingfromthe+3tothe+7oxidationstate.Todothis,theCratommustlosefourelectrons.\nLet us start by listing the four electrons as products:\n3+ \u2212 \u2212\nCr \u2192CrO4 +4e 677 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nButwheredotheOatomscomefrom?Theycomefromwatermoleculesoracommonfragmentofawatermol-\n\u2212\necule that contains an O atom: the OH ion.

We can balance the H atoms by adding\n+ +\nan H ion, which is another fragment of the water molecule. We need to add eight H ions to the product side:\n3+ \u2212 \u2212 +\n4 H2O +Cr \u2192CrO4 +4e +8 H\nTheCratomsarebalanced,theOatomsarebalanced,andtheHatomsarebalanced;ifwecheckthetotalcharge\non both sides of the chemical equation, they are the same (3+, in this case). This half reaction is now balanced,\nusing water molecules and parts of water molecules as reactants and products.\nReduction reactions can be balanced in a similar fashion. When oxidation and reduction half reactions are indi-\nvidually balanced, they can be combined in the same fashion as before: by taking multiples of each half reaction\n+ \u2212\nas necessary to cancel all electrons. Other species, such as H , OH , and H2O, may also have to be canceled in\nthe final balanced reaction.\n\u2212\nUnless otherwise noted, it does not matter if you add H2O or OH as a source of O atoms, although a reaction\n\u2212\nmay specify acidic solution or basic solution as a hint of what species to use or what species to avoid. OH ions\nare not very common in acidic solutions, so they should be avoided in those circumstances.\nEExxaammppllee 55\nBalance this redox reaction. Assume a basic solution.\n\u2212 \u2212\nMnO2+CrO3 \u2192Mn +CrO4\nSolution\nWe start by separating the oxidation and reduction processes so we can balance each half reaction sepa-\nrately.

Because the solution is basic, we should use OH rather than H2O:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nOH +CrO3 \u2192CrO4 +2e\n+\nWe have introduced H atoms as part of the reactants; we can balance them by adding H as products:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 +\nOH +CrO3 \u2192CrO4 +2e +H\nIfwechecktheatomsandtheoverallchargeonbothsides,weseethatthisreactionisbalanced.However, BALANCING REDOX REACTIONS \u2022 678\n+\nif the reaction is occurring in a basic solution, it is unlikely that H ions will be present in quantity. The\n\u2212\nway to address this is to add an additional OH ion to each side of the equation:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212\nOH +CrO3 +OH \u2192CrO4 +2e +H +OH\n\u2212 \u2212 + \u2212\nThe two OH ions on the left side can be grouped together as 2OH . On the right side, the H and OH\nions can be grouped into an H2O molecule:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n2 OH +CrO3 \u2192CrO4 +2e +H2O\nThis is a more appropriate form for a basic solution.\nNow we balance the reduction reaction:\nMnO2\u2192Mn\nThe Mn atom is going from +4 to 0 in oxidation number, which requires a gain of four electrons:\n\u2212\n4e +MnO2\u2192Mn\nThen we balance the O atoms and then the H atoms:\n\u2212 \u2212\n4e +MnO2\u2192Mn +2 OH\n+ \u2212 \u2212\n2 H +4e +MnO2\u2192Mn +2 OH\n\u2212 +\nWeaddtwoOH ionstoeachsidetoeliminatetheH ioninthereactants;thereactantspeciescombineto\n\u2212\nmake two water molecules, and the number of OH ions in the product increases to four:\n\u2212 \u2212\n2 H2O +4e +MnO2\u2192Mn +4 OH\nThis reaction is balanced for a basic solution.\nNow we combine the two balanced half reactions. The oxidation reaction has two electrons, while the\nreduction reaction has four. The least common multiple of these two numbers is four, so we multiply the\noxidation reaction by 2 so that the electrons are balanced:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n2 \u00d7 [2 OH +CrO3 \u2192CrO4 +2e +H2O]\n\u2212 \u2212\n2 H2O +4e +MnO2\u2192Mn +4 OH\nCombining these two equations results in the following equation:\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n4 OH +2 CrO3 +2 H2O +4e +MnO2\u21922 CrO4 +4e +2 H2O +Mn +4 OH\n\u2212\nThe four electrons cancel. So do the two H2O molecules and the four OH ions.

Here, the\nredox reaction 2 H2O \u21922 H2 +O2 is being caused by the introduction of electricity, which is supplied by the\nbattery.\nElectrolysis has many applications. For example, if NaCl is melted at about 800\u00b0C in an electrolytic cell and\nan electric current is passed through it, elemental sodium will appear at the cathode and elemental chlorine will\nappear at the anode as the following two reactions occur:\n+ \u2212\nNa +e \u2192Na\n\u2212 \u2212\n2 Cl \u2192Cl2+2e ELECTROLYSIS \u2022 688\nNormally we expect elemental sodium and chlorine to react spontaneously to make NaCl. However, by using an\ninput of electricity, we can force the opposite reaction to occur and generate the elements. Lithium, potassium,\nand magnesium can also be isolated from compounds by electrolysis.\nAnother element that is isolated by electrolysis is aluminum. Aluminum formerly was a difficult metal to isolate\nin its elemental form; in fact, the top of the Washington Monument has a 2.8 kg cap of aluminum metal, which\nat the time\u20141884\u2014was the largest piece of elemental aluminum ever isolated. However, in 1886 the American\nCharlesHallandtheFrenchmanPaulH\u00e9roultalmostsimultaneouslyworkedoutanelectrolyticprocessforisolat-\ningaluminum frombauxite, anoreofaluminum whosechemical formula isAlOx(OH)3\u22122x.Thebasic reactions\nare as follows:\n3+ \u2212\nAl +3e \u2192Al\n2\u2212 \u2212\n2 O \u2192O2+4e\nWith the development of the Hall-H\u00e9roult process, the price of aluminum dropped by a factor of over 200, and\naluminummetalbecamecommon.SomuchelementalaluminumisproducedintheUnitedStateseachyearthatit\nhasbeenestimated thattheelectrolysis ofaluminumuses5%ofalltheelectricity inthecountry.(Recycling alu-\nminum requires about 1/70th the energy of refining aluminum from ore, which illustrates the tremendous energy\nsavings that recycling provides.)\nAnother application of electrolysis is electroplating, which is the deposition of a thin layer of metal on an object\nfor protective or decorative purposes (Figure 14.6). Essentially, a metal object is connected to the cathode of an\nelectrolytic cell and immersed in a solution of a particular metal cation. When the electrolytic cell is operated, a\nthincoatingofthemetalcationisreducedtotheelementalmetalonthesurfaceoftheobject;thethicknessofthe\n\u22126\ncoating can be as little as a few micrometers (10 m). Jewelry, eating utensils, electrical contacts, and car parts\nlike bumpers are common items that are electroplated. Gold, silver, nickel, copper, and chromium are common\nmetals used in electroplating.\nFigure 14.6 689 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nSource: Photo courtesy of Fstep,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hullcell.jpg.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Electrolysis is the forcing of a nonspontaneous redox reaction to occur by the introduction of elec-\ntricity into a cell from an outside source.\n\u2022 Electrolysis is used to isolate elements and electroplate objects.\nExercises\n1.\nDefineelectrolytic cell.\n2.\nHow does the operation of an electrolytic cell differ from a voltaic cell?

The two parts are connected with a wire.\nFigure 14.1A Redox Reaction in Which the Two Half Reactions Are Physically Separated\n691 APPLICATIONS OF REDOX REACTIONS: VOLTAIC CELLS \u2022 692\nOne application of redox reactions requires that they be physically separated.\nEven though the two half reactions are physically separated, a spontaneous redox reaction still occurs. However,\nin this case, the electrons transfer through the wire connecting the two half reactions; that is, this setup becomes\na source of electricity. Useful work can be extracted from the electrons as they transfer from one side to the\nother\u2014for example, a light bulb can be lit, or a motor can be operated. The apparatus as a whole, which allows\nuseful electrical work to be extracted from a redox reaction, is called a voltaic (galvanic) cell.\nEach individual system that contains a half reaction is called a half cell. The half cell that contains the oxidation\nreactioniscalledtheanode,whilethehalfcellthatcontainsthereductionreactioniscalledthecathode.Thecath-\node and anode collectively are the electrodesof the voltaic cell. Because electrons are coming from the anode,\nthe anode is considered the negative electrode of the cell, while the cathode is considered the positive electrode\nof the cell. Finally, because electrons are moving from one half cell to the other, a charge imbalance builds up\nas the reaction proceeds. To counter that, a salt bridgeis used; the salt bridge contains a solution of some ionic\ncompound whose ions migrate to either side of the voltaic cell to maintain the charge balance. 693 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe tendency for electrons to go from one half cell to another is called the voltageThe tendency for electrons to\ngo from one half cell to another. of the voltaic cell, represented by E. Sometimes the term potential is used to\nrepresent the voltage of a cell. Voltage is expressed in volts (V). The voltage of a voltaic cell is determined by\nthe difference in the tendencies of the individual half cells and is characteristic of a given redox reaction when\nconcentrations are specific (1.0 M for dissolved species and 1.0 atm for gases). Because the voltage of a redox\nreaction is determined by the difference of the tendencies of the individual half reactions, absolute voltages are\nunnecessary; onlyrelative voltages ofeach halfreaction areneeded. Therelative voltage ofeach halfcell isrep-\nresented asE1/2and is based on the standard that theE1/2for the reaction\n+ \u2212\nH +e \u21921/2 H2\nis assigned to be exactly 0.000 V under standard conditions of pressure and concentration.

In modern society, however, only certain\nredox reactions are put to practical use. A portable voltaic cell that generates electricity to power devices for our\nconvenience is called abattery. All batteries are based on redox reactions.\nThefirstbattery(calleda\u201cvoltaicpile\u201d)wasconstructedbytheItalianscientistAlessandroVoltain1800andwas\nbased on the copper/zinc reaction depicted in Figure 14.1 \u201cA Redox Reaction in Which the Two Half Reactions\nAre Physically Separated\u201d. Unfortunately, it was messy, requiring quantities of copper and zinc salts dissolved\nin water. In 1866, the French scientist Georges Leclanch\u00e9 invented the dry cell, a precursor to today\u2019s modern\nbattery. A schematic of a dry cell is shown in Figure 14.2 \u201cDry Cells\u201d.

While common and useful, dry cells have relatively short lifetimes and\ncontain acidic components. They also cannot be recharged, so they are one-use only. Batteries that can be used\nonly once are calledprimary batteries.\nFigure 14.2Dry Cells 697 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThe Leclanch\u00e9 dry cell is a common type of battery.\nIn the late 1950s, Lewis Urry of the Eveready Battery Company in Ohio invented the alkaline battery(still mar-\nketedtodayunderthetradenameEnergizer).Alkalinebatteriesaresimilartodrycells,buttheyuseabasicmoist\npasteratherthananacidicone.Moreover,thenetamountofbasedoesnotchangeduringthecourseoftheredox\nreaction.

APPLICATIONS OF REDOX REACTIONS: VOLTAIC CELLS \u2022 698\nA common type of battery, especially with the increased popularity of personal electronic devices, is the button\nbattery (Figure 14.3 \u201cButton Batteries\u201d). A button battery is a small battery that can power small electronic\ndevices; the batteries can be as small as 5 mm across. Two popular redox reactions used for button batteries are\nthe alkaline dry-cell reaction and a silver oxide-based reaction:\nZn +Ag2O \u2192ZnO +2 Ag\nSome button batteries use a lithium-based redox reaction, typified by this anode reaction:\n+ \u2212\nLi \u2192Li +e E1/2= 3.045 V\nThe actual redox reaction depends on the composition of the cathode and is variable depending on voltage.\nLithiumbatteriescanalsobeusedforapplicationsthatrequiremoreenergy,suchasportablecomputersandelec-\ntric vehicles.

However, mentally we can separate the two\nprocesses. Oxidationis defined as the loss of one or more electrons by an atom. Reductionis defined as the gain\nof one or more electrons by an atom. So oxidation and reduction always occur together; it is only mentally that\nwecanseparatethem.Chemicalreactionsthatinvolvethetransferofelectronsarecalledoxidation-reduction(or\nredox) reactions.\nRedox reactions require that we keep track of the electrons assigned to each atom in a chemical reaction. How\ndo we do that? We use oxidation numbersto keep track of electrons in atoms. Oxidation numbers are assigned\nto atoms based on four rules. Oxidation numbers are not necessarily equal to the charge on the atom (although\nsometimes they can be); we must keep the concepts of charge and oxidation numbers separate.\nThe rules for assigning oxidation numbers to atoms are as follows:\n1.Atoms in their elemental state are assigned an oxidation number of 0.\n2.Atoms in monatomic (i.e., one-atom) ions are assigned an oxidation number equal to their charge. Oxida-\ntion numbers are usually written with the sign first, then the magnitude, to differentiate them from charges.\n705 OXIDATION-REDUCTION REACTIONS \u2022 706\n3.In compounds, fluorine is assigned a \u22121 oxidation number; oxygen is usually assigned a \u22122 oxidation\nnumber [except in peroxide compounds (where it is \u22121) and in binary compounds with fluorine (where it is\npositive)]; and hydrogen is usually assigned a +1 oxidation number [except when it exists as the hydride ion\n\u2212\n(H ), in which case rule 2 prevails].\n4.In compounds, all other atoms are assigned an oxidation number so that the sum of the oxidation num-\nbers on all the atoms in the species equals the charge on the species (which is zero if the species is neutral).\nHere are some examples for practice. In H2, both H atoms have an oxidation number of 0 by rule 1. In MgCl2,\nmagnesium has an oxidation number of +2, while chlorine has an oxidation number of \u22121 by rule 2. In H2O, the\nH atoms each have an oxidation number of +1, while the O atom has an oxidation number of \u22122, even though\nhydrogenandoxygendonotexistasionsinthiscompound(rule3).Bycontrast,byrule3,eachHatominhydro-\ngen peroxide (H2O2) has an oxidation number of +1, while each O atom has an oxidation number of \u22121.

Does this mean that the sulfur atom has a 4+charge on it? No, it means only that the S\natom is assigned a +4 oxidation number by our rules of apportioning electrons among the atoms in a compound.\nEExxaammppllee 11\nAssign oxidation numbers to the atoms in each substance.\n1.Cl2\n2.GeO2\n3.Ca(NO3)2\nSolution\n1.Cl2is the elemental form of chlorine.

Nuclear Chemistry\n714 Introduction to Nuclear Chemistry\n715 Mostofushaveatleastonedeviceinourhomesthatguardsoursafetyand,atthesametime,dependsonradioac-\ntivity to operate properly. This device is a smoke detector.\nA typical smoke detector contains an electric circuit that includes two metal plates about 1 cm apart. A battery\nin the circuit creates a voltage between the plates. Next to the plates is a small disk containing a tiny amount\n(~0.0002 g) of the radioactive element americium. The radioactivity of americium ionizes the air between the\nplates, causing a tiny current to constantly flow between them. (This constant drain on the battery explains why\nthe batteries in smoke detectors should be replaced regularly, whether the alarm has been triggered or not.)\nWhen particles of smoke from a fire enter the smoke detector, they interfere with the ions between the metal\nplates,interruptingtheflowofcurrent.Whenthecurrentdropsbeneathasetvalue,anothercircuittriggersaloud\nalarm, warning of the possible presence of fire.\nAlthough radioactive, the americium in a smoke detector is embedded in plastic and is not harmful unless the\nplastic package is taken apart, which is unlikely. Although many people have an unfounded fear of radioactivity,\nsmoke detectors save thousands of lives every year.\n716 717 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nMany people think of nuclear chemistry in connection with the nuclear power industry and atomic bombs but do not realize\nthat most smoke detectors rely on nuclear chemistry and save countless lives every year. The applications of nuclear chemistry\nmay be more widespread than you think.

Units of Radioactivity\nLearning Objective\n1.

One decay per\nsecond is called one becquerel (Bq). Even in a small mass of radioactive material, however, there are thousands\n10\nupon thousands of decays or disintegrations per second. The unit curie (Ci), now defined as 3.7 \u00d7 10 decays/\ns, was originally defined as the number of decays per second in 1 g of radium.

The\nnatural logarithm of 5.6/16.0 is \u22121.050. So\n\u22121.050 = \u22120.692t/(1,600 y)\nThe negative sign cancels, and we solve fort. Thus\nt = 2,420 y\nIt makes sense that the time is greater than one half-life (1,600 y) because we have less than one-half of\nthe original activity left.\nTest Yourself UNITS OF RADIOACTIVITY \u2022 720\nAsampleofradonhasanactivityof60,000Bq.Ifthehalf-lifeofradonis15h,howlongbeforethesam-\nple\u2019s activity is 10,000 Bq?\nAnswer\n38.8 h\nOther measures of radioactivity are based on the effects it has on living tissue.

This may not seem like a lot, but it is enough energy to break about 1 \u00d7 10 molecular\nC\u2013C bonds in a person\u2019s body. That amount of damage would not be desirable.\nPredictingtheeffectsofradiationiscomplicatedbythefactthatdifferenttypesofemissionsaffectvarioustissues\ndifferently. To quantify these effects, the unitrem(an acronym for r\u00f6ntgen equivalent man) is defined as\nrem = rad \u00d7 factor\nwhere factor is a number greater than or equal to 1 that takes into account the type of radioactive emission and\nsometimes the type of tissue being exposed.

Uses of Radioactive Isotopes\nLearning Objective\n1. Learn some applications of radioactivity.\nRadioactive isotopes have a variety of applications. Generally, however, they are useful because either we can\ndetect their radioactivity or we can use the energy they release.\nRadioactive isotopesareeffectivetracersbecausetheirradioactivityiseasytodetect.Atracerisasubstancethat\ncan be used to follow the pathway of that substance through some structure.

The half-life of radioactive isotopes\nis unaffected by any environmental factors, so the isotope acts like an internal clock. For example, if a rock is\nanalyzed and is found to contain a certain amount of uranium-235 and a certain amount of its daughter isotope,\nwe can conclude that a certain fraction of the original uranium-235 has radioactively decayed. If half of the ura-\n9\nniumhasdecayed,thentherockhasanageofonehalf-lifeofuranium-235,orabout4.5\u00d710 y.Manyanalyses\n9\nlike this, using a wide variety of isotopes, have indicated that age of the earth itself is over 4 \u00d7 10 y. In another\ninteresting example of radioactive dating, hydrogen-3 dating has been used to verify the stated vintages of some\nold fine wines.\nOne isotope, carbon-14, is particularly useful in determining the age of once-living artifacts. A tiny amount of\ncarbon-14 is produced naturally in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, and living things incorporate some of it\n725 USES OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES \u2022 726\ninto their tissues, building up to a constant, albeit very low, level. Once a living thing dies, it no longer acquires\ncarbon-14; as time passes the carbon-14 that was in the tissues decays. (The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,370 y.) If\na once-living artifact is discovered and analyzed many years after its death and the remaining carbon-14 is com-\npared to the known constant level, an approximate age of the artifact can be determined. Using such methods,\nscientistsdeterminedthattheageoftheShroudofTurin(Figure15.3\u201cShroudofTurin\u201d;purportedbysometobe\nthe burial cloth of Jesus Christ and composed of flax fibres, a type of plant) is about 600\u2013700 y, not 2,000 y as\nclaimed by some. Scientists were also able to use radiocarbon dating to show that the age of a mummified body\nfound in the ice of the Alps was 5,300 y.\nFigure 15.3Shroud of Turin 727 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nIn 1989, several groups of scientists used carbon-14 dating to demonstrate that the Shroud of Turin was only\n600\u2013700 y. Many people still cling to a different notion, despite the scientific evidence.

The\n2 3\ntwo isotopes of hydrogen\u2014 H and H\u2014are given their own names and symbols: deuterium (D) and tritium (T),\nrespectively.\nAtomic theory in the nineteenth century presumed that nuclei had fixed compositions. But in 1896, the French\nscientist Henri Becquerel found that a uranium compound placed near a photographic plate made an image on\nthe plate, even if the compound was wrapped in black cloth.

The net effect of beta particle emission on a nucleus is that\na neutron is converted to a proton. The overall mass number stays the same, but because the number of protons\nincreases by one, the atomic number goes up by one.

Nuclear Energy\nLearning Objectives\n1.Explain where nuclear energy comes from.\n2.Describe the difference between fission and fusion.\nNuclear changes occur with a simultaneous release of energy. Where does this energy come from? If we could\npreciselymeasurethemassesofthereactantsandproductsofanuclearreaction,wewouldnoticethattheamount\nof mass drops slightly in the conversion from reactants to products. Consider the following nuclear equation, in\nwhich the molar mass of each species is indicated to four decimal places:\nIf we compare the mass of the reactant (235.0439) to the masses of the products (sum = 234.8605), we notice a\nmass difference of \u22120.1834 g, or \u22120.0001834 kg.

That is, 16.5 billion kJ of energy is\ngiven off every time 1 mol of uranium-235 undergoes this nuclear reaction.

Then we determine the\ndifference in mass as the reaction proceeds and convert this to an equivalent amount of energy. The total\nmass of the reactants is as follows:\n1.0087 +239.0522 = 240.0609 g\nThe total mass of the products is as follows:\n203.9777 +30.9738 +(5 \u00d7 1.0087) = 239.9950 g\nThe change is mass is determined by subtracting the mass of the reactants from the mass of the products:\nchange in mass = 239.9950 \u2212 240.0609 = \u22120.0659 g\nThis mass change must be converted into kilogram units:\n\u22120.0659g\u00d71kg1,000g=\u22120.0000659kg\nNow we can use Einstein\u2019s equation to determine the energy change of the nuclear reaction:\n8 2 12\nE= (\u22120.0000659 kg)(3.00 \u00d7 10 m/s) = \u22125.93 \u00d7 10 J\nThis is almost 6trillionjoules given off.\nTest Yourself\nThe nuclear equation for the fission of uranium-238 is as follows:\nThe molar mass in grams of each species is given for each particle.

To be useful in an\natomicbomb,uraniummustbeenrichedto70%ormore.Atlesserconcentrations,thechainreactioncannotsus-\ntain itself, so no explosion is produced.\nFusionA nuclear process in which small nuclei are combined into larger nuclei, releasing energy. is another\nnuclear process that can be used to produce energy. In this process, smaller nuclei are combined to make larger\nnuclei, with an accompanying release of energy. One example is hydrogen fusion, which makes helium:\n1 4 12\n4 H \u2192 He +2.58 \u00d7 10 J\nNotice that the amount of energy given off per mole of reactant is only one-tenth of the amount given off by the\nfission of 1 mol of uranium-235. On a mass (per gram) basis, however, hydrogen fusion gives off 10 times more\nenergy than fission does. In addition, the product of fission is helium gas, not a wide range of isotopes (some of\nwhich are also radioactive) produced by fission.\nFusion occurs in nature: The sun and other stars use fusion as their ultimate energy source. Fusion is also the\nbasisofverydestructiveweaponsthathavebeendevelopedbyseveralcountriesaroundtheworld.However,one\ncurrent goal is to develop a source of controlled fusion for use as an energy source. The practical problem is\nthat to perform fusion, extremely high pressures and temperatures are necessary. Currently, the only known sta-\nblesystemsundergoingfusionaretheinteriorsofstars.Theconditionsnecessaryforfusioncanbecreatedusing\nan atomic bomb, but the resulting fusion is uncontrollable (and the basis for another type of bomb, a hydrogen\nbomb). Currently, researchers are looking for safe, controlled ways for producing useful energy using fusion.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Nuclear energy comes from tiny mass changes in nuclei as radioactive processes occur.\n\u2022 In fission, large nuclei break apart and release energy; in fusion, small nuclei merge together and\nrelease energy.

The net photosynthesis chemical reaction is as follows:\nOxygen is also a product of photosynthesis. Most forms of animal life (including people) depend on oxygen to\nbreathe, which makes plants indispensible. Virtually all food sources come from plants, eaten either directly (as\nfruits,vegetables,orgrains)orindirectly(asmeatfromanimalsthateatplantssuchascattle,poultry,pigs,sheep,\nand goats).

KEY\nLearning Objectives\n1.Identify alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds.\n2.List some properties of hydrocarbons.\nThe simplest organic compounds are those composed of only two elements: carbon and hydrogen. These com-\npounds are called hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons themselves are separated into two types: aliphatic hydrocarbons\nandaromatichydrocarbons.AliphatichydrocarbonsarehydrocarbonsbasedonchainsofCatoms.Therearethree\ntypesofaliphatichydrocarbons.Alkanesarealiphatichydrocarbonswithonlysinglecovalentbonds.Alkenesare\naliphatichydrocarbons that contain at least one C\u2013C double bond, and alkynesare aliphatichydrocarbons that\ncontain a C\u2013C triple bond. Occasionally, we find an aliphatic hydrocarbon with a ring of C atoms; these hydro-\ncarbons are calledcycloalkanes(or cycloalkenes or cycloalkynes).\nAromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene,are flat-ring systemsthatcontain continuously overlapping p\norbitals.Electrons in the benzene ring have special energetic properties that give benzene physical and chemical\nproperties that are markedly different from alkanes. Originally, the term aromatic was used to describe this class\nofcompoundsbecause theywereparticularly fragrant.However,inmodernchemistry thetermaromatic denotes\nthe presence of a very stable ring that imparts different and unique properties to a molecule.\nThe simplest alkanes have their C atoms bonded in a straight chain; these are called normal alkanes. They are\nnamed according to the number of C atoms in the chain. The smallest alkane is methane:\n761 HYDROCARBONS \u2022 762\nFigure 16.1 Three-Dimensional Representation of Methane\nThe methane molecule is three-dimensional, with the H atoms in the positions of the four corners of a\ntetrahedron.

Because they have less than the maximum number of H atoms possible, they\nare called unsaturated hydrocarbons. The smallest alkene\u2014ethene\u2014has two C atoms and is also known by its\ncommon name, ethylene:\nThenextlargestalkene\u2014propene\u2014hasthreeCatomswithaC\u2013CdoublebondbetweentwooftheCatoms.Itis\nalso known as propylene:\nWhat do you notice about the names of alkanes and alkenes? The names of alkenes are the same as their cor-\nresponding alkanes except that the suffix (ending) is \u2013ene, rather than \u2013ane. Using a stem known as the parent\nchain to indicate the number of C atoms in a molecule and an ending to represent the type of organic compound\nis common in organic chemistry, as we shall see.\nWith the introduction of the next alkene, butene, we begin to see a major issue with organic molecules: choices.\nWithfourCatoms,theC\u2013CdoublebondcangobetweenthefirstandsecondCatomsorbetweenthesecondand\nthird C atoms:\n(A double bond between the third and fourth C atoms is the same as having it between the first and second C\natoms, only flipped over.)

Different molecules with the same molecular formula are called isomers.\nIsomers are common in organic chemistry and contribute to its complexity.\nEExxaammppllee 11\nBased on the names for the butene molecules, propose a name for this molecule.\nSolution\nWith five C atoms, we will use the pent\u2013 parent name, and with a C\u2013C double bond, this is an alkene, so\nthismoleculeisapentene.InnumberingtheCatoms,weusethenumber2becauseitisthelowerpossible\nlabel.

One example is\nThe reaction conditions are usually mild; in many cases, the halogen reacts spontaneously with an alkene\nor an alkyne.\nHydrogen can also be added across a multiple bond; this reaction is called a hydrogenation reaction.

However, they are different compounds with different physical and chemical properties. As\nsuch, they need different names. How do we namebranched hydrocarbons?\nThereareaseriesofrulesfornamingbranchedalkanes(and,ultimately,forallorganiccompounds).Theserules\nmake up the system of nomenclaturefor naming organic molecules. Worldwide, the International Union of Pure\nandAppliedChemistry(IUPAC)hasdevelopedthesystemofnomenclaturefororganiccompounds,sotheserules\nare sometimes called the IUPAC rules of nomenclature. By learning and applying these rules, you can name any\norganic compound when given its structure or determine the unique structure of a molecule from its name. You\nhave already learned the basics of nomenclature\u2014the names of the first 10 normal hydrocarbons. Here, we will\nadd some steps to the procedure so you can name branched hydrocarbons.\nFirst, given the structure of an alkane, identify the longest continuous chain of C atoms; this is known as the\nparent chain. Note that the longest chain may not be drawn in a straight line. The longest chain determines the\nparentnameofthehydrocarbon.Forexample,inthemoleculeshownbelow,thelongestchainofcarbonshassix\nC atoms. Therefore, it will be named as a hexane.\n776 777 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nHowever,inthismolecule,thelongestchainofCatomsisnotsix,butseven,asshown.Sothismoleculewillbe\nnamed as a heptane.\nThenextstepistoidentifythebranches,orsubstituents,onthemainchain.Thenamesofthesubstituents,oralkyl\ngroups,arederivedfromthenamesoftheparenthydrocarbons;however,ratherthanhavingtheending\u2013ane,the\nsubstituent name has the ending \u2013yl(Table 16.2 \u201cSubstituent Names for the Five Smallest Substituents.\u201d).\nTable 16.2Substituent Names for the Five Smallest Substituents\nSubstituent Formula Number of C Atoms Name of Substituent\nCH3 1 methyl\u2013\nCH3CH2 2 ethyl\u2013\nCH3CH2CH2 3 propyl\u2013\nCH3CH2CH2CH2 4 butyl\u2013\nCH3CH2CH2CH2CH2 5 pentyl\u2013\nand so forth and so forth and so forth\nTo name a branched hydrocarbon, the name of the substituent is combined with the parent name of the hydro-\ncarbon without spaces. However, there is likely one more step. The longest chain of the hydrocarbon must be\nnumbered,andthelocant(numericalpositionofthesubstituent)mustbeincludedtoaccountforpossibleisomers.\nAs with double and triple bonds, the main chain is numbered to give the substituent the lowest possible number.\nFor example, in thealkane shown here,the longest chain is five C atoms long, so it is a pentane. BRANCHED HYDROCARBONS \u2022 778\nThere is a one-carbon substituent on the third C atom, so there is a methyl group at position 3. We indicate the\nposition using the number, which is followed by a hyphen, the substituent name, and the parent hydrocarbon\nname\u2014inthiscase,3-methylpentane.Thatnameisspecifictothatparticularhydrocarbonandnoothermolecule.\nOrganic chemistry nomenclature is very specific following the general format shown inFigure 16.3 \u201cIUPAC\nNomenclature Guide.\u201d\nFigure 16.3 IUPAC Nomenclature Guide\nIUPAC nomenclature guide.\nIt is common to represent organic molecules using bond-line structures, where hydrogens are omitted for clarity,\nand carbons are represented by a corner or \u201ckink\u201d in the line. For example, 3-methylpentane can be written as:\nItisunderstoodthatanyunwrittencovalentbondsarebondswithHatoms.Withthisunderstanding,werecognize\nthat the structural formula for 3-methylpentane refers to a molecule with the formula C6H14.\nEExxaammppllee 22\nName this molecule. 779 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nSolution\nThe longest continuous carbon chain has seven C atoms, so this molecule isnamed as a heptane. There\nis a two-carbon substituent on the main chain, which is an ethyl group. To give the substituent the lowest\nnumbering,wenumberthechainfromtherightsideandseethatthesubstituentisonthethirdCatom.So\nthis hydrocarbon is 3-ethylheptane.\nTest Yourself\nName this molecule.\nAnswer\n2-methylpentane\nBranchedhydrocarbonsmayhavemorethanonesubstituent.Ifthesubstituentsaredifferent,giveeachsubstituent\na number (using the smallest possible numbers) and list the substituents in alphabetical order, with the numbers\nseparated by hyphens and no spaces in the name. So the molecule shown here is 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane.\nIf the substituents are the same, use the name of the substituent only once, but use more than one number, sep-\narated by a comma. Also, put a numerical prefix before the substituent name that indicates the number of sub-\nstituents of that type. The numerical prefixes are listed in Table 16.3 \u201cNumerical Prefixes to Use for Multiple\nSubstituents.\u201dThe number of the position values must agree with the numerical prefix before the substituent.\nTable 16.3Numerical Prefixes to Use for Multiple Substituents BRANCHED HYDROCARBONS \u2022 780\nNumber of Same Substituent Numerical Prefix\n2 di\u2013\n3 tri-\n4 tetra\u2013\n5 penta\u2013\nand so forth and so forth\nConsider this molecule:\nThelongestchainhasfourCatoms,soitisabutane.Therearetwosubstituents,eachofwhichconsistsofasingle\nC atom; they are methyl groups.

Other molecules\u2014even with larger numbers of substituents\u2014can be named similarly.\nEExxaammppllee 33\nName this molecule.\nSolution\nThe longest chain has seven C atoms, so we name this molecule as a heptane. We find two one-carbon\nsubstituents on the second C atom and a two-carbon substituent on the third C atom. So this molecule is\nnamed 3-ethyl-2,2-dimethylheptane.\nTest Yourself\nName this molecule. 781 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nAnswer\n4,4,5-tripropyloctane\nAlkenes and alkynes are named in a similar fashion. The biggest difference is that when identifying the longest\ncarbon chain, it must contain the C\u2013C double or triple bond. Furthermore, when numbering the main chain, the\ndouble or triple bond gets the lowest possible number. This means that there may be longer or higher-numbered\nsubstituents than wouldbe allowed if the molecule were an alkane. For example, this moleculeis 2,4-dimethyl-\nhept-3-ene (note the number and the hyphens that indicate the position of the double bond).\nEExxaammppllee 44\nName this molecule.\nSolution\nThe longest chain that contains the C\u2013C triple bond has six C atoms, so this is a hexyne molecule. The\ntriple bond starts at the third C atom, so this is a hex-3-yne. Finally, there are two methyl groups on the\nchain;togivethemthelowestpossiblenumber,wenumberthechainfromtheleftside,givingthemethyl\ngroups the second position. So the name of this molecule is 2,2-dimethylhex-3-yne.\nTest Yourself\nName this molecule.

So CH3Cl has the common\nname of methyl chloride, while CH3CH2Br is ethyl bromide and CH3CH2CH2I is propyl iodide. However, this\nsystem is not ideal for more complicated alkyl halides.\nThe systematic way of naming alkyl halides is to name the halogen as a substituent, just like an alkyl group,\nand use numbers to indicate the position of the halogen atom on the main chain. The name of the halogen as a\nsubstituent comes from the stem of the element\u2019s name plus the ending \u2013o, so the substituent names are fluoro-,\nchloro-, bromo-, and iodo-. If there is more than one of a certain halogen, we use numerical prefixes to indicate\nthe number of each kind, just as with alkyl groups. For example, this molecule is 2-bromobutane.\n790 791 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nAndthis moleculeis 2,3-dichloropentane.\nIf alkyl groups are present, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Numerical prefixes are ignored when deter-\nmining the alphabetical ordering of substituent groups.\nEExxaammppllee 66\nName this molecule.\nSolution\nThe longest carbon chain has five C atoms, so the molecule is a pentane. There are two chlorine sub-\nstituents located onthe second and third C atoms, with a one-carbon methyl grouponthe third C atom as\nwell. The correct name for this molecule is 2,3-dichloro-3-methylpentane.\nTest Yourself\nName this molecule.\nAnswer ALKYL HALIDES AND ALCOHOLS \u2022 792\n1,1,2-tribromopropane\nAnother simple functional group is the covalently bonded OH group. This is the alcoholfunctional group. It is\nnotthehydroxideion;inorganicchemistry,ratherthanbeingpresentasanegativelychargedspecies,itisacova-\nlently bonded functional group.\nLike alkyl halides, alcohols have a common naming system and a more formal system. The common system\nis similar to that of alkyl halides: name the alkyl group attached to the OH group, ending with the suffix \u2013yl,\nand add the word alcohol as a second word. So CH3OH is methyl alcohol, CH3CH2OH is ethyl alcohol, and\nCH3CH2CH2OH is propyl alcohol.\nAswithalkylhalides,though,thissystemislimited(althoughforsmalleralcohols,itisverycommonineveryday\nusage). The formal system of naming uses the name of the hydrocarbon containing the OH group and having\nthe correct number of C atoms, dropping the final \u2013e of the name and appending the suffix \u2013ol. Thus CH3OH\nis methanol and CH3CH2OH is ethanol. For larger alcohol molecules, we use a number to indicate the position\nof the OH group on the longest carbon chain, similar to the number needed for alkenes and alkynes. Again, the\ncarbonchainisnumberedtogivetheOHgroupthelowestnumber,nomatterhowlargetheothernumbersare.So\nCH3CH2CH2OHispropan-1-ol,whileCH3CHOHCH3ispropan-2-ol.(Acommoncomponentinmanymedicine\ncabinets, propan-2-ol is also known as isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol [Figure 16.4 \u201cIsopropyl Alcohol\u201d]).\nFigure 16.4Isopropyl Alcohol 793 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION ALKYL HALIDES AND ALCOHOLS \u2022 794\nWhat you find labelledisopropyl alcoholin a medicine cabinet is more formally called propan-2-ol.\nSource: Photo courtesy of Craig Spurrier,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rubbing_alcohol.JPG.\nAnother acceptable way of naming an alcohol\u2014especially a more complicated molecule\u2014is to name the OH\ngroup as the hydroxy substituent and give it a numerical position like an alkyl group or a halogen atom. Thus\npropan-2-ol would be called 2-hydroxypropane by this convention.\nEExxaammppllee 77\nName this molecule as an alcohol and as a substituted alkane.\nSolution\nThelongestcarbonchaincontainingtheOHgrouphasfourCatoms,sotheparenthydrocarbonisbutane.\nBecause the OH group is on the first C atom, it is butan-1-ol. There is a methyl group on the second C\natom, as well as aCl atom, sothe formal name forthis alcohol is 2-chloro-2-methylbutan-1-ol. Ifnaming\nthe alcohol group as a substituent, it would be 2-chloro-1-hydroxy-2-methylbutane.\nTest Yourself\nName this molecule as an alcohol and as a substituted alkane.\nAnswer\n2,2,2-trichloroethanol\nMost alkyl halides are insoluble in H2O.

While methanol is soluble in H2O in all proportions,\nonlyabout2.6gofpentanolwilldissolvein100gofH2O.LargeralcoholshaveanevenlowersolubilityinH2O.\nOne reaction common toalcohols andalkyl halides is theelimination reaction,which is the removal ofthe func-\ntional group (either X or OH) and an H atom from an adjacent carbon.

Polymers\nDAVID W. BALL AND JESSIE A. KEY\nLearning Objectives\n1.Define the termsmonomerandpolymer.\n2.Draw the structure of a polymer from its monomer.\nAmong other applications, organic chemistry has had a huge impact on the development of modern materials\ncalledpolymers.Manyobjectsindailylifearecomposedofpolymers;curiously,soareseveralimportantbiolog-\nical materials.\nConsider a molecule with a double bond, such as ethylene:\nThe pi electrons of thedouble bond can beused to form a new sigma bond to join to other ethylene molecules.\nThe end result is a long, virtually endless molecule:\n820 821 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nThis long, almost nonstop molecule is called a polymer(from the Greek meaning \u201cmany parts\u201d). The original\npart\u2014ethylene\u2014is called the monomer(meaning \u201cone part\u201d). The process of making a polymer is called poly-\nmerization. A polymer is an example of amacromolecule, the name given to a large molecule.\nSimple polymers are named after their monomers; the ethylene polymer is formally called poly(ethylene),\nalthoughincommonuse,thenamesareusedwithoutparentheses:polyethylene.Becauseaddingonemonomerto\nanotherformsthispolymer,polyethyleneisanexampleofatypeofpolymercalledadditionpolymers.Table16.4\n\u201cSome Monomers and Their Addition Polymers\u201dlists some monomers and their addition polymers.\nTable16.4Some Monomers and Their Addition Polymers(Courtesy UC Davis ChemWiki\\CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0)\nEExxaammppllee 1133\nDraw the polymer that results from the polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene.\nSolution\nInthecaseofthismonomer,thedoublebondopensupandjoinstoothermonomers,justaswithethylene.\nThe polymer has this structure: POLYMERS \u2022 822\nTest Yourself\nDraw the polymer that results from the polymerization of vinyl chloride.\nAnswer\nAnother type of polymer is the condensation polymer, which is a polymer made when two different\nmonomers react together and release some other small molecule as a product. We have already seen an\nexample of this in the formation of an amide bond:\nHere, H2O is released when the ends of the molecules react to form a polymer.\nRelated to condensation polymers are the copolymers, polymers made from more than one type of\nmonomer. For example, ethylene and propylene can be combined into a polymer that is a mixture of the\ntwo monomers. A common form of synthetic rubber called styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) is made from\ntwo monomers: styrene and butadiene:\nThe physical and chemical properties of polymers vary widely, based on their monomers, structures, and\nadditives.AmongtheotherpropertiesthatcanbemodifiedbasedonthesefactorsincludesolubilityinH2O\nand other solvents, melting point, flammability, color, hardness, transparency, film thickness, wetability,\nsurface friction, moldability, and particle size\u2014the list goes on.\nThe uses of polymers are almost too numerous to consider.

KEY\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 To gain an understanding of collision theory.\n\u2022 To gain an understanding of the four main factors that affect reaction rate.\nReaction kinetics is the study of the rate of chemical reactions, and reaction rates can vary greatly over a large\nrangeoftimescales.Somereactionscanproceedatexplosivelyfastrateslikethedetonationoffireworks(Figure\n17.1\u201cFireworksatNightOverRiver\u201d),whileotherscanoccuratasluggishrateovermanyyearsliketherusting\nof barbed wire exposed to the elements (Figure 17.2 \u201cRusted Barbed Wire\u201d).\nFigure 17.1.

Collision Visualizations\nThis visualization showsan ineffective and effective collision based on molecular orientation.\n2.Barbed wire (after years of hard work) by Waugsberg/CC-BY-SA 3.0 FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RATE OF REACTIONS \u2022 840\nDuring a molecular collision, molecules must also possess a minimum amount of kinetic energy for an effective\ncollision to occur. This energy varies for each reaction, and is known as the activation energy (Ea) (Figure 17.4\n\u201cPotential Energy andActivation Energy\u201c). The rate of reaction therefore depends on the activation energy; a\nhigheractivationenergymeansthatfewermoleculeswillhavesufficientenergytoundergoaneffectivecollision.\nFigure 17.4. PotentialEnergy andActivationEnergy\nThis potential energy diagram shows the activation energy of a hypothetical\nreaction.\nFFaaccttoorrss TThhaatt AAffffeecctt RRaattee\nThere are four main factors that can affect the reaction rate of a chemical reaction:\n1. Reactant concentration. Increasing the concentration of one or more reactants will often increase the rate of\nreaction.Thisoccursbecauseahigherconcentrationofareactantwillleadtomorecollisionsofthatreactantina\nspecific time period.\n2. Physical state of the reactants and surface area. If reactant molecules exist in different phases, as in a het-\nerogeneous mixture, the rate of reaction will be limited by the surface area of the phases thatare in contact. For\nexample, if a solid metal reactant and gas reactant are mixed, only the molecules present on the surface of the\nmetal are able to collide with the gas molecules. Therefore, increasing the surface area of the metal by pounding\nit flat or cutting it into many pieces will increase its reaction rate.\n3. Temperature. An increase in temperature typically increases the rate of reaction. An increase in temperature\nwill raise the average kinetic energy of the reactant molecules. Therefore, a greater proportion of molecules will\nhave the minimum energy necessary for an effective collision (Figure. 17.5 \u201cTemperature andReaction Rate\u201d).\nFigure. 17.5 Temperature andReaction Rate 841 \u2022 INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY- 1ST CANADIAN EDITION\nEffect of temperature on the kinetic energy distribution of molecules in a\nsample\n4.Presenceofacatalyst.Acatalystisasubstancethatacceleratesareactionbyparticipatinginitwithoutbeing\nconsumed.Catalystsprovideanalternatereactionpathwaytoobtainproducts.Theyarecriticaltomanybiochem-\nical reactions.

In 1889, a Swedish scientist named Svante Arrhenius proposed an equation thatrelates these concepts with\nthe rate constant:\nwhere k represents the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.3145 J/K mol), and T is\n-1 -1\nthe temperature expressed in Kelvin. A is known as the frequency factor, having units of L mol s , and takes\ninto account the frequency of reactions and likelihood of correct molecular orientation.\nThe Arrhenius equation allows us to calculate activation energies if the rate constant is known, or vice versa. As\nwell, it mathematically expresses the relationships we established earlier: as activation energy term Ea increases,\nthe rate constantkdecreases and therefore the rate of reaction decreases.\nDDeetteerrmmiinniinngg tthhee AAccttiivvaattiioonn EEnneerrggyy\nGGrraapphhiiccaallllyy\nWecangraphicallydeterminetheactivationenergybymanipulatingtheArrheniusequationtoputitintotheform\nof a straight line.

PART 18\nChapter 18. Chemical Thermodynamics\n878 Introduction to Chemical Thermodynamics\nJESSIE A.

Enthalpy is only part of the answer, sowe must\ndelve furtherinto chemical thermodynamics.\nIn this chapter, we will examine the concept of spontaneity: whether a process will occur without external influ-\nences.Aswell,wewillfocusonthethermodynamicstatefunctionknownasentropy,ameasureof\u201crandomness\u201d\northeamountofenergydispersalinmolecules.Finally,wewilldiscussGibbsfreeenergy,athermodynamicquan-\ntity used to predict spontaneity, which incorporates both enthalpy and entropy.\n879 Spontaneous Change\nJESSIE A. KEY\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Gain an understanding of what is meant by the termspontaneous.\nGenerallyspeaking,aspontaneousprocessisonethatoccurswithouttheinfluenceofexternalforces.Acommon\nexample that is used to portray the difference between a spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes is the drop-\nping of a breakable object like a beaker. The beaker will fall and break unless outside forces are used to stop it.\nHowever,theopposite process,abrokenbeaker beingreformed intoitsoriginal condition anddefyinggravity to\nlift into the air, is nonspontaneous. The beaker cannot simply reform and lift into the air on its own, it requires a\nskilled glassworker to fix a broken beaker and someone to lift it in the air.\nChemically,whenweusethetermspontaneous,wearereferringtoanychangethatmovesasystemtowardequi-\nlibrium. The term spontaneous does not imply anything about the speed or rate; this is the domain of kinetics.\nSpontaneity simply provides information on thedirectionof a reaction.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Aspontaneous reaction or process is one that moves a system toward equilibrium.\n880 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics\nJESSIE A.

Entropy is typically defined as either the level of randomness (or disorder) of a system or a\nmeasureoftheenergydispersalofthemoleculesinthesystem.Thesedefinitionscanseemabitvagueorunclear\nwhen you are first learning thermodynamics, but we will try to clear this up in the following subsections.\nTThhee MMoolleeccuullaarr IInntteerrpprreettaattiioonn ooff EEnnttrrooppyy\nConsider the following system, where two flasks are sealed together and connected by a stopcock (Figure 18.1\n\u201cTwo-Atom,Double-FlaskDiagram\u201d).Inthissystem,wehaveplacedtwoatomsofgas,onegreenandoneblue.\nAt first, both atoms are contained in only the left flask.

This can be seen in\nFigure 18.3 \u201cEntropy vs.Temperature of aSingleSubstance.\u201d Large jumps in entropy occur at the phase\nchanges: solid to liquid and liquid to gas.

Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements\nDAVID W. BALL\nChapter 17 Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements\nIn this chapter, we present some data on the chemical elements. The periodic table, introduced in Chapter 3\n\u201cAtoms, Molecules, and Ions\u201d, lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number (that is, the\nnumber of protons in the nucleus). The periodic table is arguably the best tool in all of science; no other branch\nof science can summarize its fundamental constituents in such a concise and useful way. Many of the physical\nand chemical properties of the elements are either known or understood based on their positions on the periodic\ntable.Periodictablesareavailablewithavarietyofchemicalandphysicalpropertieslistedineachelement\u2019sbox.\nWhatfollowshereisamorecomplexversionoftheperiodictablethanwhatwaspresentedinChapter3\u201cAtoms,\nMolecules, and Ions\u201d. The Internet is a great place to find periodic tables that contain additional information.\nOne item on most periodic tables is the atomic mass of each element. For many applications, only one or two\ndecimalplacesarenecessaryfortheatomicmass.However,someapplications(especiallynuclearchemistry;see\nChapter 15 \u201cNuclear Chemistry\u201d) require more decimal places. The atomic masses in Table 17.1 \u201cThe Basics of\ntheElementsofthePeriodicTable\u201drepresentthenumberofdecimalplacesrecognizedbytheInternationalUnion\nof Pure and Applied Chemistry, the worldwide body that develops standards for chemistry. The atomic masses\nof some elements are known very precisely, to a large number of decimal places. The atomic masses of other\nelements, especially radioactive elements, are not known as precisely. Some elements, such as lithium, can have\nvarying atomic masses depending on how their isotopes are isolated.\nThe web offers many interactive periodic table resources.

However, three such elements (Th, Pa, and U) have a characteristic terrestrial iso-\ntopic composition, and for these an atomic mass is tabulated.\n\u2020Commercially available Li materials have atomic weights that range between 6.939 and 6.996; if a more accurate\nvalue is required, it must be determined for the specific material.\ng Geological specimens are known in which the element has an isotopic composition outside the limits for normal\nmaterial. The difference between the atomic mass of the element in such specimens and that given in the table may\nexceed the stated uncertainty.\nm Modified isotopic compositions may be found in commercially available material because it has been subjected to\nan undisclosed or inadvertent isotopic fractionation. Substantial deviations in the atomic mass of the element from\nthat given in the table can occur.\nr Range in isotopic composition of normal terrestrial material prevents a more preciseAr(E) being given; the tabu-\nlatedAr(E) value and uncertainty should be applicable to normal material.\nSource: Adapted from Pure and Applied Chemistry 78, no. 11 (2005): 2051\u201366. \u00a9 IUPAC (International Union\nof Pure and Applied Chemistry).
