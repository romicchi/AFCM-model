Yet,\ndespite their diversity of appearance, habitat, and genetic\ncomposition, cells are not as different from each other as\nyou might expect. At the biochemical level, it turns out that\nall cells are more alike than they are different. A great\nsimplifying feature of biochemistry is that many of the\nreactions are universal, occurring in all cells. For example,\nmost bacteria process glucose in the same 10-step\npathway that plant, animal, and fungal cells do. The\ngenetic code that specifies the amino acids encoded by a\nnucleic acid sequence is interpreted almost identically by\nall living cells, as well. Thus, the biochemical spectrum of\nlife is (mercifully) not nearly as broad or as complicated as\nfrom Wikipedia\n14 Buffers Keep the Cellular Environment\nStable\nWater can ionize to a slight extent (10-7 M - about 6 molecules per\n100 million of pure water) to form H+ (proton) and OH- (hydroxide).\nWe measure the proton concentration of a solution with pH,\nwhich we define as the negative log of the proton concentration.\npH = -Log[H+]\nIf the proton concentration, [H+]= 10-7 M, then the pH is 7.

Consequently, cells do not get as much energy out\nof catabolic processes as they put into anabolic processes. A\ngood example is the synthesis and breakdown of glucose,\nsomething liver cells are frequently doing. The complete\nconversion of glucose to pyruvate in glycolysis (catabolism)\nyields two pyruvates plus 2 NADH plus 2 ATPs. Conversely,\nthe complete conversion of two pyruvates into glucose by\ngluconeogenesis (anabolism) requires 4 ATPs, 2 NADH, and 2\nGTPs. Since the energy of GTP is essentially equal to that of\nATP, gluconeogenesis requires a net of 4 ATPs more than\nglycolysis yields. This difference must be made up in order for\nthe organism to balance everything. It is for this reason that\nwe eat.

The synthesis of creatine phosphate is a\nprime example of the effects of concentration on the synthesis of\nhigh energy molecules. For example, creatine phosphate has an\nenergy of hydrolysis of -43.1 kJ/mol whereas ATP has an energy\nof hydrolysis of -30.5 kJ/mol Creatine phosphate, however, is\nmade from creatine and ATP in the reaction shown below. How is\nthis possible?\nCreatine + ATP <=> Creatine phosphate + ADP Jump to Chapter\nThe \u2206G\u00b0\u2019 of this reaction is +12.6 kJ/mol, reflecting the energies\n1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12\nnoted above. In a resting muscle cell, ATP is abundant and ADP\nis low, driving the reaction to the right, creating creatine\nphosphate. When muscular contraction commences, ATP levels\nfall and ADP levels climb. The above reaction then reverses and\nproceeds to synthesize ATP immediately. Thus creatine\nphosphate acts like a battery, storing energy when ATP levels are\nhigh and releasing it almost instantaneously to create ATP when\nits levels fall.\nSummary\nIn summary, energy is needed for cells to perform the functions\nthat they must carry out in order to stay alive.

Cells have several ways to\nremove the sorts of damage described above, with excision\nrepair being a common strategy. Excision repair is a general\nterm for the cutting out and re-synthesis of the damaged\nregion of the DNA. There are a couple of varieties of excision\nrepair:\nNucleotide Excision Repair (NER)\nThis system fixes damage by chemicals as well as UV damage.\nAs shown in the figure on the previous page, in nucleotide\nexcision repair, the damage is recognized and a cut is made on\nThymine Dimer Removal\neither side of the damaged region by an enzyme called an\nChemicals like benzopyrene can attach themselves to bases, excinuclease (shown in green).

As noted earlier, cytosines in DNA sometimes undergo\ndeamination to form the base uracil.\nBecause cytosines pair with guanines and uracils pair with\nadenine, the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the DNA would\nlead to the insertion of an A in the newly replicated strand instead\nof the G that should have gone in across from a C. To prevent\nthis from happening, uracils are removed from DNA by base\nexcision repair.\nIn base excision repair, a single base is first removed from the\nDNA, followed by removal of a region of the DNA surrounding the\nmissing base. The gap is then repaired.\nThe removal of uracil from DNA is accomplished by the enzyme\nuracil DNA glycosylase, which breaks the bond between the uracil\nand the sugar in the nucleotide.\nThe removal of the uracil base creates a gap called an\nBase Excision Repair\napyrimidinic site (AP site). The presence of the AP site triggers\nthe activity of an AP endonuclease that cuts the DNA backbone.\nA short region of the DNA surrounding the site of the original\nuracil is then removed and replaced.\n116 Transcription\nIn the preceding sections, we have discussed the replication of\nthe cell's DNA and the mechanisms by which the integrity of the\ngenetic information is carefully maintained.

Covalent bonds are VERY strong bonds that hold atoms/molecules together.\nof our lectures. Hyperlinks to all of the topics\nCovalent bonds are the 'glue' that holds together biomolecules.\nin this section are provided in Appendix 1.\n2. Hydrogen bonds are much weaker bonds that are also important in biological\nmolecules. Hydrogen bonds arise from uneven sharing of electrons between, for\nexample a nitrogen and a hydrogen or an oxygen and a hydrogen. In each case,\nthe hydrogen ends up with a partial positive charge and the other atom has a\npartial negative charge. The partial positive charge of the hydrogen may be\nattracted to a partial negative charge on another oxygen or hydrogen. These\nbonds are weaker than covalent bonds, but are VERY important in stabilizing\nprotein and DNA structures.\n3. Water has its relatively high boiling point due to its numerous hydrogen bonds.\nThe double helix of DNA is held together by hydrogen bonds between the\nindividual bases.\n4. Hydrogen bonds are additive, so they provide great stability in numbers (as in\nacross a chromosome), but\nless stability locally (one can The mouse in my house makes me shriek\neasily pull them apart when Every time I espy its physique\nThe thing that inflames\nDNA needs to replicate).\nMe most is his games\n5. Hydrogen bonds are some\nHe likes to play hide and go squeak\nof the stabilizing forces of\nproteins. Since protein\n242 function depends on protein structure, forces that disrupt\nhydrogen bonds (such as heat) tend to disrupt protein structure\nand function. It is because of this that cooking food kills bacteria,\nbecause it denatures their proteins. Since proteins are the\n\"workhorses\" of cells, loss of protein function means loss of cell\nfunction, which means death.\n6. pH is a measure of the proton concentration in a solution. The\npH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration. The\nlower the pH, the higher the hydrogen ion concentration and the\nstronger the acid. pH + pOH = 14. The pOH is the negative log of\nthe hydroxide ion concentration. The pK is, therefore, the\na\nnegative log of the K . The lower the pK for an acid system (such\na a\nas the acetic acid system discussed in class), the stronger the\nacid is.\n7. Acetic acid (HAc above) is a weak acid, meaning that it doesn't\ncompletely dissolve in water. HCl, by contrast is called a strong\nacid because it completely dissociates in water.\nHAc <=> H+ + Ac-\nWe can write the general equation for the dissociation of ANY\nweak acid as\nHA <=> H+ + A-\nJump to Chapter\n1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12\n243 Key Points - Buffers 4. pK a is a measure of the\nstrength of an acid.

A second state of hemoglobin is the \"relaxed\" or R state,\nwhich exhibits increased oxygen binding affinity. Binding of\noxygen by hemoglobin helps it to \"flip\" from the T to the R\nstate and release of oxygen by hemoglobin helps it to flip from\nR to T.\n11. A molecule called 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3 BPG) is\nproduced by actively respiring tissues. It can bind in the gap in\nthe center of the hemoglobin molecule and in doing so,\nstabilize the T state and favor the release of oxygen. Thus,\ntissues that are actively respiring get more oxygen. 2,3 BPG is\nnoteworthy because the blood of smokers has a higher\nconcentration of the molecule than the blood of non-smokers.\n12. Fetal hemoglobin differs from adult hemoglobin in having two\ngamma subunits in place of the two beta subunits that adults\nhave. This changes the hemoglobin molecule such at 2,3BPG\ncan't bind, so fetal hemoglobin exists more in the R state and\nhas a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. Thus,\nthe fetus can take oxygen from the mother's hemoglobin, due\nto this property. The fetus won't release oxygen as readily as\nthe adult, but it doesn't have a high oxygen need, due to not\nexercising heavily.\n13. The Bohr effect describes physiological and molecular\nresponses to changes in pH with respect to oxygen and carbon\ndioxide in the body.

This\nlast step occurs relatively slowly.\n7. In the active site of chymotrypsin (and other serine\nproteases) is a so-called catalytic triad of amino acids\nthat includes a serine hydrogen bonded to a histidine.\nThe histidine is, in turn, hydrogen bonded to an\naspartic acid residue in the active site. Each of the\nhydrogen bonds of the catalytic triad is important in\nthe catalytic mechanism. The nucleophilic alkoxide ion\non serine is made possible ultimately by interactions in\nthe catalytic triad and these hydrogen bonds.\n8. The catalytic triad is not unique to chymotrypsin. The\nserine protease known as subtilisin also has the same\ncatalytic triad and employs a similar mechanism.\n9. Besides the catalytic triad, the enzyme has two other\nimportant sites to consider. The first is the oxyanion\nhole that stabilizes a tetrahedral intermediate that\narises during the catalysis. The second, called as S1\npocket, is where the substrate binds.

Membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer and other\nmolecules, such as cholesterol. The lipid bilayer contains two\nmain categories of molecules - glycerophospholipids and\nsphingolipids.\n2. Glycerophosphlipids contain glycerol, phosphate and one or\nmore fatty acids. The fatty acids in the molecules of the lipid\nbilayer are either saturated (no double bonds) or unsaturated\n(contain one or more double bonds). Double bonds in biological\nfatty acids are almost exclusively in the cis configuration,\nresulting in a bent shape for unsaturated fatty acids.\n3. Glycerophospholipids (also called phosphoglycerides) are\nrelated to fats in having a glycerol backbone and two fatty\nacids, but they differ from fat in having a phosphate located in\nposition #3 of the glycerol. Naming of glycerophospholipids is\ngenerally as \"phosphatidyl-X\" where X is the name of the\nmolecule attached to the phosphate. Examples include\nphosphatidylserine, etc.\n4. If there is no other molecule attached to the phosphate on the\nglycerophospholipids described above in #3, you have\nphosphatidic acid.\nAt the bookstore I asked timidly\nPhosphatidic acid is an For some help to get phobia-free\nThe clerk pointed to 5.

Channels (gates) are made by protein molecules in\nthe membranes of cells. Channels are generally very\nspecific for what they will allow to pass through them.\nGlucose channels, for example are fairly specific for\nglucose. Sodium and potassium channels are very\nspecific for each respective ion.\n18. Ion specificity is accomplished by two mechanisms.\nThe first is physical. If an ion is too big to fit in a channel,\nit is excluded. This is the case of the sodium channel,\nwhich excludes potassium ions because they are too big.\n19. The second mechanism of specificity is energy. An\nexample is the potassium channel, which excludes\nsodium ions. In this case, the channel allows larger ions\n(potassium) to pass through, but blocks smaller ions, like\nsodium ions.\n20.

Translation (protein synthesis) is performed by\nribosomes on mRNA and occurs in the 5' to 3'\ndirection along the mRNA.\n2. The rate of translation in bacteria is about the same as\nthe rate of transcription (45-50 bases or 15-17 amino\nacids per second). The 5' end of the coding region\ncorresponds to the amino end of the protein. The 3'\nterminus of the coding region corresponds to the\ncarboxyl end of the protein.\n3. Translation is performed by ribosomes on mRNA and\noccurs in the 5' to 3' direction. The rate of translation\nin bacteria is about the same as the rate of\ntranscription (45-60 bases or 15-20 amino acids per\nsecond).\n4. The 5' end of the coding region corresponds to the\namino end of the protein. The 3' terminus of the\nentire complex is, as a result, attached to the 'new' tRNA.\ncoding region corresponds to the carboxyl end of the protein.\nThus, polypeptides are synthesized in the amino to carboxyl\n5.

When iron is high, the IRE-BP\nleaves the mRNA's 3' end, leaving it susceptible to\ndegradation. Gene expression of the transferrin receptor is\ntherefore a function of stability of the gene's mRNA.\n36. When iron inside the cell is high, ferritin is made to hold onto it\nand when iron is low inside the cell, transferrin receptor is\nmade to bring more iron in.\nJump to Chapter\n1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12\n366 Section 3\nAppendix - Exams\nSECTION III Exam 1 (BB 450/550)\nExams we have given our students are\nSection I \u2013 Short answer - The questions below can generally be answered in 15\nincluded in this section.
