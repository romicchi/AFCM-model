Over time, art evolved beyond practical and religious functions and became an autonomous expression of the artist\u2019s creative\nprocess and of the surrounding culture.\nAesthetics is concerned with how we perceptually engage in the changing and complex concepts of beauty and the sublime (Ocvirk, 6).\nExploring the de\u0000nition of art is an act of critical thinking. Critical thinking is creative thinking, and the critical-thinking process often requires a\nbelief in the question, rather than an expectation of hard truths or answers. Through active questioning, exploration, and trial and error, we\nuncover multiple valid perspectives.\nConsider the example of the nkisi \u0000gures introduced at the beginning of this module. Recall how that misunderstanding of visual culture was\nrepresentative of the larger confrontation and oppression of African societies by Europeans. Consider also, in the \u0000nal example of video games,\nhow the introduction of new media keeps alive the ongoing debate about what art is.\nWorks Cited\nOcvirk, Stinson, Wigg, Bone, Cayton.
