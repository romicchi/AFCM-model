I would especially like\nto thank Mario Pati\u00f1o, the very talented photographer, for use of the\nstunning photographs. An earlier version of the second research profile\nfor chapter 2, \u201cQueering Pan-Africanism,\u201d was published on Africa Is a\nCountry, \u201c*Not the Continent with 55 Countries\u201d (https://africasacountry.\ncom/about).\nvii  Introduction\nAn Open Invitation to LGBTQ+ Studies\nAt the 1984 Hacker\u2019s Convention, Stewart Brand reportedly uttered\nthe classic phrase \u201cInformation wants to be free.\u201d1 Among this state-\nment\u2019s several interpretations is the one reflecting a belief that all people\nshould be able to freely access information and that scientific information\nshould be openly circulated. And I would like to suggest that if infor-\nmation wants to be free, queer information, especially, should always be\nfree.\nThis textbook is dedicated to the bold idea that information and\neducation should be free and widely accessible across age, race, class,\ngender, and other categories\u2014such as the nation-state\u2014that are all too\noften invoked to divide peoples. In the last few years we have experi-\nenced a global pandemic, the rise of a radical form of domestic political\nextremism, a racial reckoning sparked by the murders of George Floyd\nand Breonna Taylor, and the revival of 1990s-style culture wars that are\nnot struggles over culture but really about politics and power. In this\nvolatile context, this textbook is more important than ever, especially as\nnearly one in five young adults globally who are members of Generation\nZ (born after 1997) identify as not being straight and almost 4 percent\nas not being cisgender.2 Free and empowering information is the only\nanswer to the politics of hatred and divisiveness.\nThe information in this textbook can empower readers because it\nprovides an introduction to and an overview of LGBTQ+ studies for col-\nlege students and the curious public. It is an Open Educational Resource\n(OER), which means that it carries an open license so that all its content\ncan be retained, reused, revised, remixed, and redistributed for free, as\nlong as authorship is clearly attributed. The State University of New York\n(SUNY) Geneseo\u2019s Milne Library is publishing and maintaining this free,\nonline resource. Additionally, SUNY Press is publishing paperback and\nhardcover copies of the textbook for those who would like to hold the\ntext in their hands.\nProducing an open-license textbook for LGBTQ+ studies embodies\nthe spirit of the political struggle for the rights of gender and sexual\nminorities that also animates the field itself. This textbook is free for\neveryone to use; it is community oriented and a cultural production\n1 2 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ngrounded in the struggle to challenge stereotypes, silences, and untruths\nthat have long been circulated about lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans folk,\nqueer and nonbinary people, our histories, and our cultures. It\u2019s a kind\nof DIY LGBTQ+ project for the twenty-first century. It also helps combat\nthe high cost of a college education in the United States, and around the\nworld. Students all too often simply cannot afford to purchase textbooks\nfor their classes because the books cost too much.\nThis political struggle for the human rights of gender and sexual\nminorities continues today. Research and writing on LGBTQ+ issues\nremains vitally important. Equality has advanced in the United States\u2014\nthere is federal recognition of marriage equality, for example, and\nenhanced visibility for transgender issues on many college campuses\u2014but\nsimultaneously, backlash and hostility toward LGBTQ+ people is wide-\nspread. LGBTQ+ people continue to experience hate crimes at unacceptable\nlevels, and state legislators continue to try to pass anti-LGBTQ+ laws\nand ordinances.3 Similarly, there are advances in terms of global LGBTQ+\nrights\u2014India and Jamaica, two former British colonies, have struck down\ncolonial-era laws against homosexual activity\u2014but violations of LGBTQ+\nhuman rights still occur worldwide. This textbook speaks directly to a\nbroad range of audiences by engaging these critically important social\nissues.\nThis textbook fills a number of needs for both academic readers\nand the general public. First, it is the only free, openly licensed textbook\non LGBTQ+ issues in the world. It offers accessible, academically sound\ninformation on a wide range of LGBTQ+ topics\u2014history, relationships,\nfamilies, parenting, health, and culture\u2014and a chapter on how to conduct\nresearch in LGBTQ+ studies. Second, it employs an intersectional analysis,\nhighlighting how sexuality and gender are simultaneously experienced\nand constructed through other structures of inequality and privilege, such\nas race and class. This intersectional analysis is grounded in social theory\nand a commitment to racial equality. Third, it expands the temporal and\nspatial perspectives on LGBTQ+ issues, from the ancient world to more\ncontemporary regions. Finally, it aims to support multiple learning styles\nby integrating visual elements and multimedia resources throughout the\ntextbook.\nThis textbook has evolved over several years of research, writing,\nand\u2014most importantly\u2014collaboration with a host of colleagues across\nthe United States and indeed the world. It was originally borne out of\nmy experience teaching the Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies course in\nthe online environment at SUNY Empire State college. SUNY Empire stu-\ndents are typically older (average age thirty-six), working full or part Introduction 3\ntime, and taking care of their families, including parents, children, or\nboth. They are struggling to secure a college degree and to learn more\nabout the world they live in. What is most striking about the students\nin the class\u2014whether they identify as LGBTQ+ or straight\u2014is both their\ngenuine curiosity and their deep desire to learn more so that they can\nadvocate for LGBTQ+ family members or serve as allies to friends and\ncolleagues in the workplace. Many work in human services, health care,\nor in educational settings, and they want to know more about how to\nbetter support LGBTQ+ youth and fight the discrimination they witness.\nThe textbook for this class cost $93, and I found myself buying textbooks\nfor students when they could not afford them. Out of these experiences\ncame this textbook, an answer to the need for access to critically import-\nant information on LGBTQ+ lives, for free.\nIn January 2019 a call for participants to create this textbook, placed\nthrough the Rebus Community platform, received dozens of answers from\npeople within forty-eight hours. I and Sean Massey, who agreed to serve\nas coeditor, sifted through dozens of impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to find the right\nmix of proposed topics, relevant expertise, and comprehensive coverage.\nThanks to a grant from SUNY OER Services, we were able to hold a work-\nshop in Saratoga Springs in spring of 2019, where most of the authors\nmet, shared their work, brainstormed learning outcomes and textbook\ndesign, and generally enjoyed each other\u2019s company. During 2019, each\nchapter was peer reviewed at least once and reviewed by the coeditors,\nand the entire textbook was also peer reviewed. The beta version of the\ntextbook launched in spring 2020 through SUNY OER Services.\nOn the basis of feedback about that version, we recruited Jennifer\nMiller to organize a chapter on LGBTQ+ literature, which strengthened\npart VI, on LGBTQ+ culture. Along the way, she became a coeditor. Sub-\nsequently, SUNY Press joined the project, and the entire textbook was\nsubstantially revised to include pedagogical supports and create a uniform\nstructure. Allison Brown served as project manager and digital publishing\nexpert for the entire project. She also served as an editor and developed\nkey content for the pedagogical supports. Her expertise in digital pub-\nlishing, deft project management skills, and cool, calm influence have\nkept the project on track and moving in the right direction for four long\nyears. We hope you enjoy the results of our efforts.4\nThe next section defines LGBTQ+ studies and situates the textbook\nwithin the field. The last section provides an overview of the organization\nof the textbook so that readers will have a sense of the range of topics\nand ideas that they will encounter. 4 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure I.1.

Introduction 5\nWHAT IS LGBTQ+ STUDIES?\nLGBTQ+ studies examines issues relating to sexual orientation and gen-\nder identity, usually focusing on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer\npeople\u2014hence the initialism LGBTQ\u2014and their histories and cultures.\nIn the twenty-first century, that collection of identities has expanded to\ninclude asexual, questioning, intersex, and two-spirit peoples and myriad\nother genders and sexualities\u2014hence the plus sign in LGBTQ+. The field\nrelies on and benefits from interdisciplinary methods to arrive at new\nideas and theories, and it has always been closely aligned with different\nforms of political activism. This means that scholars in LGBTQ+ studies\nmight combine historical analysis with ideas from literary analysis to\nmake sense of their own experience or the experiences of others with\nwhom they have conducted fieldwork. Finally, the field is hard to cate-\ngorize simply because it is always evolving and always questioning the\npolitics and poetics of its own practitioners. In fact, different names have\nmarked different periods in the field; it was gay and lesbian studies in\nthe beginning, then came the birth of queer theory in the 1990s, and we\ncall it LGBTQ+ studies now. However it is described, LGBTQ+ studies is\ndedicated to the simple notion that discrimination against human sexual\nand gender diversity is wrong. Rather, gender and sexual diversity are\nto be valued and celebrated but also critically analyzed and theorized,\nfor everyone\u2019s benefit.\nLGBTQ+ studies as a field of inquiry has grown out of various\nliberation movements in the latter half of the twentieth century in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Indeed, interdisciplinary\nacademic fields have a long history of emerging in response to activist\nmovements and the accompanying demands to understand and legitimate\nthe histories, literatures, and cultures of oppressed peoples. For example,\nin the United States the civil rights and Black power movements of the\n1950s, 1960s, and 1970s gave rise to Black studies, and feminist move-\nments of the 1960s and 1970s gave rise to women\u2019s studies, or gender\nstudies as it is now often known. As Alisa Solomon and Paisley Currah\nargue, \u201cLGTBQ studies has its origins in the gay activism that marks its\nsymbolic birth with the Stonewall uprising of 1969.\u201d5 Leaders in what was\ninitially called gay and lesbian studies were also active in lesbian, femi-\nnist, gay, and trans liberation movements in the United States and United\nKingdom, including Esther Newton, Jeffrey Weeks, Larry Kramer, Jonathan\nNed Katz (founder of Gay Academic Union), and Leslie Feinberg.6\nAt a very basic level, what was originally called the gay liberation\nmovement gave birth to a new field\u2014gay and lesbian studies. In this\nfield, scholars developed new analyses and research methodologies to 6 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nchallenge the silences and erasure of lesbian and gay lives from history,\nart, politics, and public policy. Activists and scholars sought to build new\ninstitutions and transform old ones. Gay interest groups within academic\nprofessional organizations were organized, and archives such as the Les-\nbian Herstory Archives (in 1974) were set up to safeguard histories,\nmemorabilia, and literature that document lesbian experience. Community\ncenters were founded to provide social, psychological, and material sup-\nport for community members, and cultural institutions were established\nto ensure the creation and production of literature, music, and art. Olivia\nRecords was founded in 1973 by radical lesbian feminist members of the\nWashington, D.C., collective the Furies and the Radicalesbians, and the\nMichigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival was founded in 1976.\nAnother key component of our definition of LGBTQ+ studies is a\nform of analysis called intersectional feminism that emerged in the 1980s\nas Black lesbians critiqued racism within the white women\u2019s movement\n(and women\u2019s studies) and sexism and homophobia among Black activ-\nists (and in Black studies). Radical women of color set about creating\ntheir own institutions and articulating their own theories, including the\nCombahee River Collective in Boston and Kitchen Table Press (founded\nin 1980). The Combahee River Collective Statement is an important, early\nstatement of intersectional feminism.7 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw coined the term\nintersectionality in 1989 as part of her work in critical race theory. The\nimportance of this analysis has not diminished, as evidenced by Cren-\nshaw\u2019s 2016 Ted Talk, \u201cThe Urgency of Intersectionality.\u201d8\nBy the 1990s, the HIV/AIDS pandemic had started to decimate gay\ncommunities, creating a sense of fury and desperation among gays and\nlesbians and a growing mainstream backlash as well. Lesbian and gay\nactivism took increasingly radical approaches, perhaps best exemplified by\nACT UP\u2014the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power\u2014and Queer Nation. These\ngroups articulated a radical critique of straight culture and developed rev-\nolutionary tactics to disrupt business as usual and push the U.S. medical\nestablishment to attend to the ravages of the disease. Within academic\ncontexts, queer theory was born, and perhaps most closely identified with\nthe work of theorists like Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Eve Sedg-\nwick (see chapter 1, \u201cThirty Years of Queer Theory\u201d). At the same time,\nin a synergistic relationship among activist movements, the academy, and\nhuman services, new names for a broader array of sexual and gender\nidentities emerged, including trans and queer. And somewhere along the\nway, the meanings of gender and sexuality became much more complicated.\nThe story of LGBTQ+ studies is complicated, ongoing, and hard to\nunderstand, but one important element is that it emerged in relationship\nto historical and political forces hard at work in the late twentieth century.\nMoreover, we emphasize that our definition of LGBTQ+ studies is a broad Introduction 7\nand inclusive one. We rely on an intersectional feminist analysis to remind\nus that discrimination and oppression are not simple, unilinear forces.\nRather, multiple interlocking systems of discrimination\u2014including racism,\nsexism, and homophobia\u2014affect all our lives in different and complex\nways. An additional goal of this textbook is to embrace the original impulse\nof queer theory to challenge and disrupt the conventions of straight, white,\nmiddle-class America. And we heed the call of trans theory to think against\nthe grain and across traditional definitions of sexuality and gender. Finally,\nin the new millennium of the twenty-first century, we embrace and seek to\ncelebrate and empower nonbinary gender and sexual identities and think-\ning. To get a sense of the breadth and depth of this gender and sexual\nrevolution, review PFLAG\u2019s \u201cNational Glossary of Terms.\u201d9\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nChapter 1: Thirty Years of Queer

TEXTBOOK\nThis textbook is organized into seven parts, each with one or more chap-\nters that provide a broad overview on a particular topic in a disciplinary\napproach. Each chapter starts by stating the relevant learning objectives\nand ends with a \u201cKey Questions\u201d section for class discussion that points\nback to those objectives. Pedagogical supports include resources listed at\nkey places in the chapter and at the chapter\u2019s end, with discussion ques-\ntions or suggestions for learning activities, such as presentation topics,\ncreative responses, and debate questions. Many chapters also include\none or more \u201cProfile\u201d sections, which provide in-depth looks at particular\nissues relevant to the broader topic of the chapter. Glossaries are at the\nend of each chapter.\nPart I, \u201cTheoretical Foundations,\u201d consists of chapter 1, \u201cThirty Years\nof Queer Theory,\u201d by Jennifer Miller. It examines the emergence of queer\ntheory and queer theoretical interventions into understandings of gender\nand sexual identities. It identifies key concepts and theorists in queer\ntheory, and it explores queer theory at the intersection of gender, race,\nand ability.\nPart II, \u201cGlobal Histories,\u201d explores different understandings and\nmanifestations of gender and sexuality throughout history and from a\nglobal perspective. It provides readers with a historically based under-\nstanding of LGBTQ+ identities, lives, and rights in the United States and\nthe complex ways these phenomena have changed and been contested\nover time. Its two chapters explain how gender and sexual diversity is\nthe rule, rather than the exception, across all human cultures. In chapter\n2, \u201cGlobal Sexualities: LGBTQ+ Anthropology, Past, Present, and Future,\u201d\nJoseph Russo delineates the many functions, meanings, practices, and\nmethods of conceptualization for sexuality. Across different cultures and\nsocieties, as well as throughout history, sexuality has come to define an\nentire spectrum of phenomena. Two profiles accompany this chapter. Rita\nPalacios introduces the work of the muxe artist and anthropologist Lukas\nAvenda\u00f1o in Mexico. Adriaan van Klinken\u2019s profile positions LGBTQ+\nidentities within the pan-African decolonization movement and specifi-\ncally in relation to religion and LGBTQ+ activism.\nChapter 3, \u201cQueer New World: Challenging Heteronormativity in\nArchaeology,\u201d by James Aimers, explores how new theories of sex and\nsexuality that have emerged from feminist studies, gender studies, and\nqueer theory have changed the way we see the lives of ancient people.\nIn particular, the assumption that heterosexuality and heteronormativity\nis and always has been the norm in human culture is challenged. In\nparticular, Aimers describes nonheteronormative behaviors and identities Introduction 13\nin ancient Mesoamerica. Both chapters help us rethink some of our basic\nassumptions about gender and sexuality and what is \u201cnormal.\u201d\nMoving from a global perspective, part III focuses on U.S. histories\nin relation to LGBTQ+ lives. In chapter 4, \u201cU.S. LGBTQ+ History,\u201d Clark\nPomerleau traces the development of LGBTQ+ concepts, identities, and\nmovements in the United States from white settler colonialism through the\nnineteenth century. The broadening from thinking of sexuality as behav-\nior to sexuality as identity is highlighted, as is the subsequent develop-\nment of homosexual communities in the twentieth century. Toward this\nend, the profile by Jennifer Miller and Clark Pomerleau documents how\nthe science of sexology introduced the idea that same-sex attraction was\na pathological identity born of mental illness that correlated with gender\ntransgression. Pomerleau\u2019s chapter also evaluates the political strategies\nthat influenced LGBTQ+ organizing, including the civil rights movement,\nradical Left tactics, and cross-pollination from 1960s and 1970s student\norganizing and feminism. Pomerleau sketches how, in response to the\nAIDS epidemic, LGBTQ+ Americans developed institutions and new forms\nof political activism that included the rise of queer politics.\nIn chapter 5, \u201cLGBTQ+ Legal History,\u201d Dara Silberstein explores the\nhistory of constitutional law in the United States and how it has served\nas the context for critical LGBTQ+ legal battles. She considers the tenets\nthat paved the way for recognition of sexual rights and the process that\neventually led the Supreme Court to extend these rights to include lesbian\nand gay people. The chapter addresses the question of marriage equal-\nity. This overview of LGBTQ+ legal history is supplemented by Ariella\nRotramel\u2019s profile on anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes in the United States. The\nprofile defines hate crimes and summarizes the history of hate-crime laws,\nat both the federal and the state levels. A map in the profile depicts the\nvery uneven development of hate crime laws across the United States,\nnotwithstanding ongoing violence against LGBTQ+ people.\nPart IV, \u201cPrejudice and Health,\u201d begins by drawing on social psy-\nchology research to understand how discrimination and prejudice affect\nLGBTQ+ people. In chapter 6, \u201cPrejudice and Discrimination against\nLGBTQ+ People,\u201d Sean Massey, Sarah Young, and Ann Merriwether\nemphasize that even though there have been great strides in recent\nyears in terms of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the United States and elsewhere,\nongoing forms of prejudice, discrimination, and violence remain. Their\nchapter reviews the prevalence and trends of anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice in\nthe United States; sets out what is known about its nature, origins, and\nconsequences; provides a historical overview of attempts to define and\nmeasure it; and reviews the variables that increase or reduce its impact\non the lives of LGBTQ+ people. Finally, they also discuss the resistance 14 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nand resilience shown by the LGBTQ+ community in response to prejudice\nand discrimination.\nIn the accompanying profile, \u201cMinority Stress and Same-Sex Cou-\nples,\u201d David Frost analyzes discrimination and structural violence on\nsame-sex couples that results in minority stress. He and his colleagues\nhave conducted several studies to understand how sexual minority indi-\nviduals and members of same-sex relationships experience stigma related\nto their intimate relationships. He demonstrates that stigma harms their\nmental health and the quality of their relationships.\nChapter 7, \u201cLGBTQ+ Health and Wellness,\u201d explores the history and\nculture of medicine in relation to LGBTQ+ people. The authors\u2014Thomas\nLong, Christine Rodriguez, Marianne Snyder, and Ryan Watson\u2014consider\nvulnerabilities across the lifespan and across intersectional identities and\ndisease prevention and health promotion. These experts identify both\nthe negative outcomes for LGBTQ+ peoples\u2019 health and the resistance\nby LGBTQ+ people to the pathologizing of queer sexuality. Queer com-\nmunities have sought to take health into their own hands, particularly\nin relation to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The authors also discuss mental\nhealth and transgender people\u2019s health, and they conclude with advice\non how to be a smart patient and health care consumer.\nPart V, \u201cRelationships, Families, and Youth,\u201d continues to draw on\npsychology research to explore LGBTQ+ relationships and families and\nthe experiences of youth in educational settings. In chapter 8, \u201cLGBTQ+\nRelationships and Families,\u201d Sarah Young and Sean Massey explore the\ncomplex worlds of LGBTQ+ intimate relationships and the varied ways\nthat LGBTQ+ people form families. In her profile, \u201cLGBTQ+ Family Build-\ning: Challenges and Opportunity,\u201d Christa Craven shares insights from\nher research on the reproductive challenges and experiences of loss that\nmany lesbian and gay couples in the United States face. She argues that\nsupport resources should be more inclusive, to help LGBTQ+ families who\nexperience reproductive loss.\nIn chapter 9, \u201cEducation and LGBTQ+ Youth,\u201d Kim Fuller identifies\nthe social and educational barriers to healthy LGBTQ+ youth develop-\nment, such as inequities and injustice. She also shows the resiliency of\nLGBTQ+ youths and the role supportive adults can assume in facilitating\npositive youth development. She describes the coming out process for\nyoung people and how educational institutions and settings can sabotage\nor support that process. In the profile complementing this chapter, Sabia\nPrescott reviews the current state of LGBTQ+ inclusion in prekindergar-\nten through twelfth-grade educational settings and its consequences for\nlearning outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth. Introduction 15\nPart VI, \u201cCulture\u201d encompasses two important realms of LGBTQ+\nlife: film and literature. In chapter 10, \u201cScreening LGBTQ+,\u201d Lynne Stahl\nreviews various forms of LGBTQ+ film and media from the beginnings\nof the cinematic form to the contemporary milieu of producing DIY web\nseries and viewing on smartphones. The chapter addresses milestone\nfilms and other visual media along with significant laws, political contexts,\ntechnological developments, genres, movements, and controversies, pri-\nmarily in the United States. Stahl\u2019s analysis reveals that other structures\nof oppression\u2014in particular, race and class\u2014have interacted in complex\nways with gender and sexuality in the history and contemporary chal-\nlenges of LGBTQ+ representations on-screen, both large and small.\nTwo profiles take an in-depth look at this theme. In \u201cGiving Voice\nto Black Gay Men through Marlon Riggs\u2019s Tongues Untied,\u201d Marquis\nBey thoughtfully analyzes a canonical film in the archive of Black queer\ncinema. The 1989 Tongues Untied explicitly addresses, interrogates, and\ncelebrates Black gay identity and culture. Bey also meditates on Riggs\u2019s\nbiography and his relationship to the marginalized voices, Black gay\ncultural practices, and politics of sexuality within Black communities.\nIn the second profile, \u201cHow One Day at a Time Avoids Negative Queer\nTropes,\u201d Shyla Saltzman argues that the queer characters of this series\nare presented in a way that offers nuanced and positive depictions to its\nqueer viewers and allies.\nChapter 11, \u201cLGBTQ+ Literature,\u201d doesn\u2019t try to capture the varied\nLGBTQ+ literature within a single narrative arc. Instead, Jennifer Miller,\nthe chapter editor, gathered several discussions that explore fields of\nLGBTQ+ literature: children\u2019s literature, young adult literature, comics,\npulp fiction, and memoir. The discussion authors think of literature as\nboth a product and a producer of history. It plays an essential role in\nthe creation of LGBTQ+ culture and the formation of LGBTQ+ commu-\nnities and identities. Each discussion focuses on tropes, or themes, that\nemerge in that field. Jennifer Miller\u2019s discussion offers an engaging look at\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books as an important source of empowerment\nfor LGBTQ+ youth and families. She traces the history of the LGBTQ+\npicture book in the United States and reviews some of the controversies\nthat surround positive imagery of LGBTQ+ life designed for children. The\nnext two discussions explore young adult literature: Maddison Lauren\nSimmons examines tropes in lesbian young adult literature, and Robert\nBittner explores trans and gender nonconforming characters. The last\nthree discussions explore LGBTQ+ comics, by Mycroft Roske and Cathy\nCorder; lesbian and gay pulp fiction, by Cathy Corder; and LGBTQ+ mem-\noir and life writing by Olivia Wood. 16 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nPart VII, \u201cResearch,\u201d comprises chapter 12, \u201cA Practical Guide\nfor LGBTQ+ Studies.\u201d The chapter offers practical steps for conducting\nLGBTQ+ research. In a world where infinite amounts of information\nappear online, the search for reliable information can be challenging.\nRachel Wexelbaum and Gesina Phillips wrote this chapter to help people\nsearch for LGBTQ+ information and resources in an effective, mindful\nmanner. They provide tips on what to ask and where to look. This chap-\nter is intended to complement the \u201cResearch Resources\u201d sections in the\nchapters and can support student research assignments in class.\nIntroduction to LGBTQ+ Studies: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach will\nacquaint readers with many of the compelling topics found under the\nbroad umbrella of LGBTQ+ studies. Although our intention was to pro-\nvide global coverage of LGBTQ+ issues, this first edition centers on North\nAmerica, and particularly the United States. We hope to create a truly\nglobal version of this textbook in the future. Nonetheless, we do believe\nthat the textbook you are now viewing on a screen (or holding in your\nhands) represents a significant contribution to the ever-expanding archive\nof LGBTQ+ knowledge and literature.\nLast but not least, enjoy!\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project spanned four years, involved several organizations, and\ncalled on dozens of contributors.

Part I\nTheoretical Foundations 1\nThirty Years of Queer Theory\nJennifer Miller\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nUpon completion of this chapter, students will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Identify key approaches and debates within the field of queer\ntheory.\n\u2022 Explain the social construction of sex, gender, and sexuality.\n\u2022 Describe the relationship among LGBTQ+ history, political\nactivism, and LGBTQ+ studies.\n\u2022 Summarize the personal, theoretical, and political differences\nof the homophile, gay liberation, radical feminism, LGBTQ+\nrights, and queer movements.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is a challenge to create an origin story about a field of study, in this\ninstance queer theory, because ideas are not birthed in a moment, a\nday, or even a year. They build on what has come before, reflect on\nit, challenge it, seek to bend or break it, and only eventually, and only\nsometimes, become an identifiable entity with a name given to them. The\nstory of queer theory\u2019s emergence is entwined with queer activism. Queer\ntheory and queer activism are products of their historical moment as well\nas transformative forces changing how gender and sexuality are under-\nstood in multiple academic disciplines and, increasingly, outside academia.\nAdditionally, both queer theory and activism introduced ways of thinking\n20 Thirty Years of Queer Theory 21\nand acting through politics that went beyond normalizing demands for\nthe inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in existing social institutions.\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a rapid increase in lesbian and gay activ-\nism and scholarship. A police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City\nin 1969 ignited demonstrations. Following the Stonewall rebellion, lesbian\nand gay liberation groups started to fight for equal rights, and some\nscholars started to study the history and culture of lesbians, gays, and\nbisexuals. Then, in 1987, Larry Kramer, Vito Russo, and others founded\nthe direct-action group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) to\ndemand that politicians, the medical community, drug manufacturers,\nand the public acknowledge the AIDS epidemic. The group\u2019s motto was,\nand remains, \u201cSilence = Death.\u201d1 An offshoot of ACT UP, Queer Nation,\nwas founded in 1990 to fight the escalating violence and discrimination\nagainst LGBTQ+ people.\nAt roughly the same time, the term queer theory began to circu-\nlate and quickly gained momentum within academic circles. The film\ntheorist Teresa de Lauretis (figure 1.1) coined the term at a University\nFigure 1.1. Teresa de\nLauretis.

The conference proceedings were later collected in a\n1991 special issue of Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies.\nIn her introduction to the special issue, de Lauretis outlines the central\nfeatures of queer theory, sketching the field in broad strokes that have\nheld up remarkably well.2\nDe Lauretis suggested gay and lesbian sexualities should be stud-\nied, not as deviations of heterosexuality, but on their own terms. She\nwent on to claim gay and lesbian sexualities should be \u201cunderstood and\nimagined as forms of resistance to cultural homogenization, counteracting\ndominant discourses.\u201d3 According to de Lauretis, and queer theorists more\ngenerally, lesbian and gay sexualities enact nonnormative intimate and\nsocial modes of relating; they put new things in the world, and those\nnew things have transformative potential.\nFrom its earliest iterations, queer theory challenged norms that repro-\nduced inequalities and, at its best, sought to understand how sexuality\nintersected with gender, race, class, and other social identities to main-\ntain social hierarchies. In fact, de Lauretis used the term queer to create\ncritical distance from lesbian and gay studies. Lesbian and gay studies\ncourses began to appear in the 1970s, and programs slowly emerged in\nthe 1980s. De Lauretis claimed that differences were collapsed within\nlesbian and gay studies and the experience of white middle-class gay men\nwas privileged. She notes that although it became standard to refer to\nlesbians and gays in the 1980s, the \u201cand\u201d obscured differences instead of\nrevealing them.4 In addition to sexuality, de Lauretis hoped queer theory\nWatch\nIn a video in the InQueery series by them, Tyler Ford explains the history\nbehind the word queer (https://youtu.be/UpE0u9Dx_24).\n\u2022 What are the key events that Ford identifies as defining the\nbroad outlines of the history of the word queer in the English\nlanguage?\n\u2022 What is your own history with the word queer? Where did\nyou first hear it, and how was it used? Do you consider it\nan insult, a fierce statement of resistance, or something else?\nDo you self-identify as queer?\n\u2022 How does your history with the word relate to the broader\nhistory described by Ford in the video? What connections\nbetween the two do you find? Thirty Years of Queer Theory 23\nwould identify and trouble other \u201cconstructed silences\u201d\u2014for instance,\nthose of race, ethnicity, class, and gender.5 She wanted to break with the\npast and transform the future by developing new ways of conceptualizing\nsexual identities in the present of the 1990s.\nGay and lesbian activism has a complex history in the United States\nand even more so globally. Activist demands that have been most pal-\natable to cisgender heterosexuals are those that foreground the right\nto privacy, individual autonomy, and equal access to social institutions\nlike marriage and the military. However, queer activism and scholarship\nreject mainstream liberal ideals of privacy, the goal of formal equality\nunder the law, and the desirability of assimilation into existing social\ninstitutions. Instead, queer theory and activism demand publicness, reject\ncivility, and challenge the legitimacy, naturalness, and intrinsic value of\ninstitutions\u2014whether marriage or the military\u2014that regulate gender and\nsexuality.6 Of course, this very critical, very radical relationship to the\nnormative appears in times before the late 1980s and in places other\nthan the United States, but it is then and there that queer activism and\nqueer theory are named and begin to be, however hesitantly, defined.\nThis chapter explores the development of queer theory from the\n1990s to the present. It begins by elaborating on distinctions between\ngay and lesbian studies and queer studies before identifying important\ntrends in queer theory.\nTHE CONSTRUCTIONIST TURN IN SEXUALITY\nAND GENDER STUDIES\nLesbian and gay studies assumed clear subjects of analysis\u2014lesbians\nand gays\u2014who were studied as historical, cultural, or literary figures of\nsignificance to reclaim a forgotten past and create a sense of collective\nidentity and continuity in the present.

As a result, meanings and values change across space and that changes.\ntime. 24 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nIn the mid-1970s, the French historian and philosopher Michel Fou-\ncault published The History of Sexuality, which describes the origin of\nmodern homosexual identity. In this sweeping history of sexuality, Fou-\ncault creates an influential theory of sexual-identity formation. For Fou-\ncault, \u201cSexuality must not be thought of as a kind of natural given which\npower tries to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge\ntries gradually to uncover. It is the name that can be given to a historical\nconstruct.\u201d8 By rejecting the idea that something called sexuality exists\nin all of us, waiting to be liberated, Foucault\u2019s work challenged not only\ndiscourses\nhow sexuality was understood in popular and scholarly discourses but\nAn institutionalized way\nalso how power was understood. For Foucault, power does not repress a\nof thinking and speaking,\npreexisting sexual identity; it provides the conditions needed for sexual\nwhich creates a social\nidentities to multiply.

David Halperin, a a concerted effort to\nhistorian of classical Greek culture, provided volumes\u2019 worth of historical demand equal rights for\nevidence to support Foucault\u2019s more theoretical claims.9 Halperin argues homosexuals.\nthat using modern identity frameworks to understand culturally and his-\ntorically specific expressions of desire is poor scholarship. He interprets\nsexual histories through a queer lens that does not assume that identities\nand experiences are universal. John D\u2019Emilio, another queer historian,\nconnects the development of modern gay identity to nineteenth-century\nurbanization and industrialization.10 Jonathan Ned Katz, also a historian,\nfocuses a critically queer lens on heterosexuality, arguing that it is also\na social construct.11 By demonstrating that heterosexuality, like homo-\nsexuality, is a modern invention, Katz seeks to strip the category of its\nnormalizing power.\nFoucault, Halperin, D\u2019Emilio, and Katz contribute to a critical under-\nstanding of the social construction of homosexuality and heterosexuality.\nThis does important political and intellectual work in troubling the idea\nof heterosexuality as normal and natural, a claim that has been used to\nmarginalize homosexuals.\nEve Sedgwick, a literary theorist, continues the project of troubling\nminoritizing\nboth homosexuality and heterosexuality in her 1990 publication Episte-\nA term introduced by Eve\nmology of the Closet, which is widely recognized as a foundational queer\nSedgwick to describe the\ntheory text (figure 1.2).

The universalizing view, in contrast, sees homosexuals as a distinct\nsexuality and sexual definition as important to everyone. This is the group. 26 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 1.2.

For\ninstance, the cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin\u2019s essay \u201cThe Traffic\nin Women: Notes on the \u2018Political Economy\u2019 of Sex\u201d sought to identify\nthe origin of women\u2019s oppression across cultures.13 It is a constructivist\naccount of gender identity that connects the binary construction of gender\n(man or woman) to heterosexual kinship and by extension to women\u2019s\noppression within heterosexual patriarchal cultures (figure 1.3).\nRubin uses the phrase sex-gender system to describe the process\nsex-gender system\nby which social relations produce women as oppressed beings.

For instance, the social psychologist Suzanne\nKessler was critical of Fausto-Sterling\u2019s attachment to reading genitals\nfor the truth of sex, insisting that the performance of gender on the body\nrather than on genitalia was more often used to gender bodies.17 Faus- Thirty Years of Queer Theory 29\nto-Sterling has since conceded Kessler\u2019s point.18 Most queer theoretical\nengagements with gender deprivilege the body, particularly genitals, as\na site of truth by suggesting that the appearance of binary sexed bodies\nis actually an effect of binary gender discourse and, as discussed in the\nnext section, binary performances of gender. In other words, a binary\nsex-gender system that assumes a correlation between sex and gender\nis an effect of power, not nature.\nGENDER PERFORMATIVITY\nThe cultural anthropologist Esther Newton published Mother Camp: drag\nFemale Impersonators in America, a groundbreaking ethnography of drag Refers to the performance\nculture in 1972.

Clearly a social constructionist,\nButler emphasizes that she considers gender an important site of freedom and pleasure.\n\u2022 Butler states that there is a difference between saying that gender is performed as opposed\nto saying gender is performative. Describe that difference in your own words. What exam-\nples of different kinds of behavior help you understand that difference? And if you disagree\nwith this idea, explain why you do not see an important difference between the two.\n\u2022 Butler names institutional powers, like psychologists and psychiatrists, and informal prac-\ntices, like bullying, that try to keep us in our place.

In other words, much as New-\nton observes about drag performances of femininity, anybody can put on\na gender expression.\nQueer theories of gender have influenced scholars across disciplines,\nradically transforming how we think about gender.

Additionally, these ideas, and the value hierarchies that\nadhere to them, are maintained only by their reproduction.\nThe work discussed in this chapter dissipates some of the power\nthat coheres around the idea of natural gender and sexuality, an idea that\nhas often been used to mark queer genders and sexualities as unnatural\nand by extension inferior to heterosexuality.\nTRANSGENDER STUDIES\nTransgender studies is an interdisciplinary field of knowledge production\nthat, like queer theory, challenges discursive and institutional regimes of\nnormativity. However, whereas queer theory is sometimes guilty of the\n\u201cprivileging of homosexual ways of differing from heterosexual norms,\u201d\ntransgender studies challenges naturalized links between the material\nbody, psychic structures, and gendered social roles.26 Transgender studies\nemerged in activist and academic circles around the same time as queer\nactivism and theory. The anthropologist David Valentine attributes the\nterm\u2019s early emergence to activist communities in the United States and\nthe United Kingdom, noting that \u201cit was seen as a way of organizing a\npolitics of gender variance that differentiated it from homosexuality.\u201d27\nSusan Stryker provides an even more specific periodization, find-\nSusan Stryker\ning that the term transgender emerged in the 1980s but didn\u2019t take on\nAn American professor,\nits current meaning until 1992 when Leslie Feinberg published Trans-\nauthor, filmmaker, and\ngender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come.28 At this point\ntheorist whose work\ntransgender began to be used broadly to refer to \u201cdiscomfort with role\nfocuses on gender and\nexpectations, being queer, occasional or more frequent cross-dressing,\nhuman sexuality, and a\npermanent cross-dressing and cross-gender living, through to access-\nfounder of Transgender\ning major health interventions such as hormonal therapy and surgical\nStudies.\nreassignment procedures.\u201d29 Before the 1990s, transgender referred spe-\ncifically to persons who socially transitioned to a gender other than the\none they were assigned at birth without using hormones or surgery to\nmedically transition.\nBy refusing to accept that there is a right way to be transgender\nand encouraging coalition building under the newly flexible term trans-\ngender, Feinberg hoped transgender persons could build a transformative\nactivism-oriented community.30 Feinberg\u2019s 1993 publication, Stone Butch\nBlues, is a fictionalized personal account of negotiating New York City\nas a butch lesbian in the 1970s.31 Feinberg experienced harassment and\nbrutality at the hands of police, and the vivid descriptions of violence in\nthe book illustrate the consequences of not embodying a socially sanc- Thirty Years of Queer Theory 33\nWatch\nThe Advocate interviews Kate Bornstein, and she explains the gender\nrevolution (https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/11/20/iconic-\nkate-bornstein-explains-gender-revolution).\n\u2022 Restate, in your own words, what Kate Bornstein means when\nshe talks about gender in four dimensions.\n\u2022 What are some examples of what Bornstein calls the \u201cmulti-\nplicity of gender truths\u201d discussed in this chapter so far?\n\u2022 Bornstein describes how she sees the future of gender.

Charlene A.\nCarruthers. (Photo by Lucy\nHewitt. Courtesy of Charlene\nA. Carruthers.) 38 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nLike Mu\u00f1oz, Carruthers emphasizes the importance of the Black\nimagination, specifically the ability to imagine \u201calternative economics,\nalternative family structures, or something else entirely.\u201d42 This work\ncannot be accomplished if groups like the HRC, which has a clear pro-\ncapitalist agenda, shape public discourse about LGBTQ+ issues.\nIn After the Party: A Manifesto for Queer of Color Life, Joshua\nChambers-Letson explores the affect music and art can have on audiences\nin an attempt to theorize the conditions necessary to envision collective\nchange. He suggests that creative work can expand imaginative possibil-\nities and prompt new modes of being together in the world. His project\nexplores \u201cthe ways minoritarian subjects mobilize performance to survive\nthe present, improvise new worlds, and sustain new ways of being in\nthe world.\u201d43\nSimilar to Mu\u00f1oz and Carruthers, he argues that radical transfor-\nmation is the only way forward for queers of color. Instead of asking,\nHow can we include queers in the existing social world, he asks, How\ncan we queer the existing social world to make it habitable by queers?\nAdditionally, like Carruthers, Chambers-Letson decenters the queer\nsexual subject and queer theory to explore intersectional possibilities for\nspeculative world making and practical activism. For him, experiencing\nperformance allows audiences to rehearse new ways of seeing and being\nin the world together, which is why he emphasizes the importance of\nart and music. Importantly, Chambers-Letson does not see art and per-\nformance as able to fulfill the promise of revolutionary transformative\nchange; instead, it is a site where possible worlds are imagined, but they\nmust still be materially enacted.44\nCONCLUSION\nThis chapter maps the emergence of queer theory, over time and across\ndisciplines, out of the lived experiences of diverse LGBTQ+ people. Both\nactivism and theory are historically and geographically contingent, teth-\nered to time, space, and the material body in its specificity. Queer theory\nis flexible enough to account for differences of race, class, gender, and\nnation, although it does not always do so. It does, however, have at its\nfounding, and through the twists and turns of its development, an invest-\nment in radical social change tethered to a belief that, because gender,\nsexual, and other forms of social hierarchy are reproduced and regulated\nthrough discourse and social institutions, those institutions can and must\nbe changed for the better.

Questioning the status of heter-\nonormativity, however, does not mean that heterosexual kinship and the\nreproductive unit are not prominent features of nearly all cultures.

Embracing the terms queer and two spirit, these scholars\nargue for the decolonization of Indigenous sexualities, and they critique\nheteronormativity, finding it a product of colonialism.

The story of Osh-Tisch suggests two major points about agency in\nCrow two-spirit social roles: (1) the role was a cultural institution and\nchosen by individuals who exhibited exemplary traits, such as excelling\nat women\u2019s work, and (2) two-spirit individuals could also perform the\nroles of traditionally gendered males or females, as Osh-Tisch\u2019s part in\nthe Battle of the Rosebud suggests. Similarly, the idea that demographic\nnecessity dictated who would be a two-spirit person is not sufficient to\nexplain female two spirits. Many Crow women took on the traditionally\nmale warrior role, making it difficult to classify two spirits as a response\nFigure 2.3.

Nonetheless, after decades of struggle\nagainst apartheid in South Africa, the new South African constitution in\n1996 enshrined protections against discrimination on the basis of sex-\nual orientation. The increase in studies on postcolonial LGBTQ+ rights\nand gender nonconformity and sexual minorities in Africa constitutes a\nrelatively recent pan-African political movement. In postcolonial African\ncities, sexual violence against lesbians in South Africa and gender- or\nsexuality-based oppression and violence have occurred.28 Scholars have\nfocused on a variety of topics, including sexual violence against lesbians\nin South Africa and knowing women, a term for working-class women\nin southern Ghana who share friendship and intimacy.29 The twenty-first\ncentury has witnessed a surge of activism by gender and sexual minori-\nties across Africa. This activism promotes both Indigenous terms and\nhistories of sexuality and gender. It also draws on international LGBTQ+\nculture and activism in creating identities that resist and critique colonial\nand neocolonial heteronormativity (figure 2.8).\nEurope\nBinary formations of sexuality and gender are widely characterized as\nWestern, European, Euro-American, or American.

In many societies these practices were accepted and\neven celebrated. Christianity and colonialism were two key forces that\nbrought homophobia to many societies and influenced local social con-\nstructions of gender and sexuality.

This chapter describes the range of gender and\nsexual practices that have existed in different places and times and that\ncontinue to evolve. In the twenty-first century, globalization continues\nto spread Western notions of LGBTQ+ liberation, and in turn, local and\nregional cultural practices affect contemporary Western expressions and\nstruggles over gender and sexuality. 70 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nRead\nThe article \u201cIn Han Dynasty China, Bisexuality Was the Norm,\u201d by Sarah\nPrager, explores studies that document China\u2019s \u201clong history of dynastic\nhomosexuality.\u201d See https://go.geneseo.edu/HanDynasty.\n\u2022 What are some catchphrases that refer to love between men\nin ancient China?

Though it would be easy to make an equivalency\nbetween gay and muxe or between transgender and muxe, it can best\nbe described as a third gender specific to Be\u2019ena\u2019 Za\u2019a (Zapotec) culture.\nMuxes are a community of Indigenous people who are assigned male at\nbirth and take on traditional women\u2019s roles, presenting not as women\nbut as muxes. Avenda\u00f1o\u2019s work is a reflection on muxeidad, sexuality,\neroticism, and the tensions that exist around it. Though muxeidad is\nunderstood and generally accepted as part of Be\u2019ena\u2019 Za\u2019a society, it\nexists within a structure that privileges fixed roles for men and women,\nrespectively. It is important to note that his work provides a reflection on\nmuxeidad from within rather than without\u2014that is, he critically explores\nwhat it means to be muxe as muxe himself, providing an alternative to\nacademic analyses that can exoticize.

For the wedding ceremony, the artist prepares the stage by dec-\norating for the occasion and then, blindfolded, selects a member of the\naudience who presents as male to marry him. Such a union would not be\nwell regarded in traditional Be\u2019ena\u2019 Za\u2019a society, even though same-sex\nmarriage was recently legalized in Oaxaca, an initiative spearheaded by\na muxe scholar and activist, Amaranta G\u00f3mez Regalado, in August 2019.\nOn May 10, 2018, in Tehuantepec, Avenda\u00f1o\u2019s younger brother,\nBruno Avenda\u00f1o, disappeared during a brief vacation from his duties\nin the navy.

It uses sexuality as a key site\nto defend and preserve African values and identities vis-\u00e0-vis perceived\nforeign imperialism. LGBT sexualities are framed here as \u201cun-African,\u201d\nand violence against sexual minorities is legitimized in the name of \u201cAfri-\ncan pride.\u201d The Ugandan human rights lawyer Adrian Jjuuko summarizes 74 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nthis as the \u201crise of a conservative streak of pan-Africanism.\u201d34 Second,\nand of greater interest here, LGBT activists and allies across the conti-\nnent resist this popular narrative through a discursive counterstrategy in\nwhich they deploy progressive Black and pan-Africanist figures, ideas,\nand symbols.\nOne key example of this emerging discourse is the African LGBTI\nManifesto, drafted at a meeting in Nairobi in April 2010 by activists from\nacross the continent.35 It opens with a strong, explicitly pan-Africanist\nvision: \u201cAs Africans, we all have infinite potential. We stand for an\nAfrican revolution which encompasses the demand for a re-imagination\nof our lives outside neo-colonial categories of identity and power.\u201d The\nmanifesto then explicitly states its specific concern with sexuality but\nlinks it to the project of \u201ctotal liberation\u201d of the African continent and\nits peoples: \u201cWe are specifically committed to the transformation of the\npolitics of sexuality in our contexts. As long as African LGBTI people are\noppressed, the whole of Africa is oppressed.\u201d\nA similar emphasis on mainstreaming sexuality in a broader project\nof decolonization is found in the emerging body of literature in African\nqueer studies. For instance, Sokari Ekine and Hakima Abbas state that\n\u201cat the root of queer resistance in Africa, is a carrying forward of the\nstruggle for African liberation and self-determination.\u201d36 African queer\npolitics is a project concerned not just with LGBT identities and rights\nbut with the struggle against patriarchy, heteronormativity, homophobia,\nand neoliberal capitalism. It aims at a comprehensive liberation of Afri-\ncan peoples and societies from the multiple structures of domination and\noppression.\nAs much as the queer African project is about the future of the\ncontinent, there is a critical sense of retrieving something that has been\nlost in the course of history and that can be recovered for contempo-\nrary political purposes. In the talk titled \u201cConversations with Baba,\u201d the\nlate Kenyan literary writer Binyavanga Wainaina uses an inclusive \u201cwe\u201d\nto reclaim Africa as a continent that has always been characterized by\ndiversity, and he thus sets an example to the rest of the world: \u201cWe,\nthe oldest and the most diverse continent there has been. We, where\nhumanity came from. We, the moral reservoir of human diversity, human\naid, human dignity.\u201d37\nIn Wainaina\u2019s commentary, this rich and strong tradition of diversity\ncharacterizing African societies was only interrupted by \u201cthose people\nwho came from that time of colonization to split us apart, until our\nsplitting apart came from our own hearts.\u201d Thus, he suggests that the\ninterruption came from outside\u2014from the forces of colonialism and mis-\nsionary Christianity; he further suggests that moral conservatism and Global Sexualities 75\nrigidity have been adopted and internalized by certain sections of society\nin postcolonial Africa, in particular conservative religious actors such as\nPentecostal Christian pastors.\nVis-\u00e0-vis such forces, Wainaina calls for a reclaiming of indigenous\nAfrican moral traditions that recognize human diversity. In part two of\nhis six-part video \u201cWe Must Free Our Imaginations,\u201d Wainaina describes\nsociopolitical and religious homophobia in Africa as \u201cthe bankruptcy of\na certain kind of imagination.\u201d He urges fellow Africans to engage in\ncreative, liberating, and imaginary thinking, reclaiming the past in order\nto reimagine the future\u2014a future free from oppressive modes of thought.\nIn a more popularized form, the same narrative is found in the \u201cSame\nLove\u201d music video.38 Released in 2016 by the Kenyan band Art Attack\nunder the leadership of the openly gay musician and activist George\nBarasa, the video was presented as \u201ca Kenyan song about same-sex\nrights, LGBT struggles, and civil liberties for all sexual orientations.\u201d The\nlyrics and imagery present a progressive pan-Africanist vision, which\nunfolds in two steps. First, the video draws critical attention to the recent\npolitics against homosexuality across the continent, showing newspapers\nwith strong and sensationalist antigay messages and images of Kenyan\nantigay political protests. This part of the song concludes by stating,\nHomophobia is the new African culture / Everyone\u2019s the police,\nEveryone\u2019s a court judge, mob law, street justice / Kill \u2019em when\nyou see \u2019em / Blame it on the west, never blame it on love, it\u2019s\nun-African to try and show a brother some love.\nIn the next part, the lyrics specifically refer to Uganda and Nigeria, the\ntwo countries that in 2015 became internationally known for passing\nnew anti-homosexuality legislation. Then the song calls upon Africa as\na whole, saying,\nUganda stand strong, Nigeria, Africa, it\u2019s time for new laws,\nnot time for new wars / We come from the same God, cut from\nthe same cord, share the same pain and share the same skin.\nA positive pan-Africanist vision is presented here, emphasizing the unity\nand common history of African peoples. The basis for this vision is a\nreligious one: the idea of African peoples as created by God. This echoes\nan important tradition of religiously inspired pan-Africanist thought, cen-\ntering on the belief \u201cthat Africa\u2019s destiny is God given.\u201d39 In the words\nof Marcus Garvey, \u201cGod Almighty created us all to be free.\u201d40 Originally,\nthis religious notion allowed for resisting racial discrimination and over- 76 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ncoming the inferiority of people of African descent vis-\u00e0-vis white supe-\nriority. \u201cSame Love\u201d appropriates it to resist sexual discrimination and to\novercome divisions that exist today about who counts as truly African.\nIn its opening statement\u2014\u201cThis song goes out to the new slaves,\nthe new blacks\u201d\u2014\u201cSame Love\u201d situates the experience of same-sex-lov-\ning people in Africa in a longer history of racial and ethnic oppression.\nThe lyrics suggest continuity between the civil rights movement in the\nUnited States and the contemporary LGBT rights movement in Africa.\nThis is acknowledged later in the video when images of some prominent\nAfrican queer individuals appear on the screen, while the vocals in the\nsong state that \u201cLuther\u2019s spirit lives on.\u201d The suggestion is that the spirit\nof Martin Luther King Jr. lives on in those Africans campaigning for the\nhuman rights of sexual minorities today. This allows the producers of\nthe video to claim a moral high ground, implicitly appropriating King\u2019s\nprophetic dream of racial liberation in the United States and applying it\nto the struggle for queer freedom in Africa.\nFigure 2.14. Wainaina\u2019s\ntweets about James Baldwin\nin 2014. Global Sexualities 77\nFigure 2.15. Wainaina\u2019s\n2015 Facebook post\ninvoking the tradition of\nprogressive Black religious\nthought.\nWainaina has also invoked the name of King, and of the African\nAmerican literary writer James Baldwin, as part of his queer pan-Afri-\ncanist imagination. He referred to Baldwin as a source of inspiration,\nrecognizing him as \u201cblack, African, ours,\u201d as a \u201cgay icon of freedom,\u201d\nand canonizing him as a writer of \u201cnew scriptures\u201d (figure 2.14). While\ncommenting on the anti-homosexuality bill in Uganda, he further stated\nthat the pastor of the former U.S. president George W. Bush \u201chas had\nmore influence on the imagination of Africans than Martin Luther King\nand James Baldwin.\u201d Elaborating on this, Wainaina invoked the tradition\nof progressive Black religious thought, explicitly referring to \u201cthe Jesus of\nJames Baldwin and Martin Luther King,\u201d which, he critically observes, is\n\u201ca dead man in Africa\u201d (figure 2.15).41 Describing Jesus as a liberating\nfigure, who is in solidarity with the marginalized, Wainaina criticized the\nchurch in Africa for maintaining structures of oppression and exclusion.\nThe invocation of progressive traditions of Black religious thought is\nparticularly significant in light of popular discourses that denounce homo- 78 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nsexuality as both un-African and un-Christian. The question of whether\nreligion, in particular Christianity, can make a constructive contribution\nto queer pan-Africanist discourse is a debatable one. Many African queer\nscholars and activists tend to see Christianity as a colonial and con-\nservative religion from which Africa and Africans need to be liberated.\nThis is understandable, but one could ask whether it not also reflects\nthe influence of Western queer scholarship and politics with its secular\ninclination and anti-religious tendencies. Both Wainaina and the \u201cSame\nLove\u201d video agree with the postcolonial critique of Christianity. Yet they\nalso suggest that progressive traditions of Christian thought can inspire\nthe Black African queer imagination. Hence, they invite us to engage\ncreatively and constructively with the resources within religious traditions\ntoward Black pan-African queer liberation.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 What is anthropology and how has it contributed to our un-\nderstanding of sex, gender, and sexuality?\n\u2022 What are some examples of same-sex desire and LGBTQ+\nidentities from different parts of the world?\n\u2022 What do we mean by third gender, and what are some ex-\namples of third-gender identities?\n\u2022 How are the new identities you learned about in this chapter\nboth the same as and different from your understanding of\ngay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer identities in\nyour own culture?\n\u2022 How has anthropology played a role in the struggle for\nLGBTQ+ rights in the United States and around the world?\nRESEARCH RESOURCES\nCompiled by Rachel Wexelbaum\n\u2022 Discuss: Choose one or two resources listed in this chapter,\nand discuss them in relation to what you have learned about\nqueer anthropology.\n\u2022 Present: Choose a key topic or event found in this chapter.\nThen locate one or two resources from the \u201cQuick Dip\u201d and\n\u201cDeep Dive\u201d sections and develop a presentation for the class.

A \u201ctruly queer archaeology\u201d will question \u201creceived categories of\npresent-day sexual politics and seek to develop archaeological methodol-\nogies that do not depend on these problematic sexual taxonomies.\u201d9 My\nwork with the classification of ancient Maya pottery reminds me that all\nclassifications are created to answer particular questions and that not\nevery question can be addressed with a single classification. So the idea\nthat there is one, transhistorical, all-purpose classification of bodies or\ngender or sexuality is no more reasonable than the belief that one really\ngreat way of classifying pottery could answer all our questions.\nTHE CONSTRUCTEDNESS OF SEX\nOne classification that most people probably consider unchallengeable is\nthat of the two sexes, male and female. But about 2 percent of humans\nare born intersexed, and Anne Fausto-Sterling and others have drawn\nattention to the range of variability in the sexual characteristics of human\nbodies.10 Biological sex is multifaceted, potentially designated in reference\nto chromosomes or DNA, hormones, breasts, genitals, reproductive abili-\nties, or in archaeology, skeletal characteristics. As Fausto-Sterling notes,\n\u201cLabeling someone a man or a woman is a social decision.\u201d11\nThese complexities have been acknowledged by bioarchaeologists,\nbioarchaeologists\nwho study human remains. In a discussion of ancient Maya human\nThose who study human\nremains, Pamela Geller remarks that \u201cfemaleness and maleness reside\nremains in archaeological\nat opposite ends of a continuum with ambiguity situated in the middle.\nsites.

Even contemporary ideas\nabout sex turn out to be, from the perspective of archaeology, relatively taxonomy\nnew. In his book Making Sex, Thomas Laqueur shows that perceptions The practice and science\nof classification of things\nof the sexed body changed radically from antiquity until the twentieth\nor concepts, including the\ncentury.18 Up until the eighteenth century,\nprinciples that underlie\nsuch classification.\nanatomical and physiological representations of male and female\nbodies in Western and Eastern medicine relied on a common,\nandrogynous body with differently positioned but homologous\nreproductive organs in each sex, the vagina being an inverted\nand internalized penis and so forth. Physiological differences\nwere explained by relative humoral balances, heat, or measures\nof yin or yang.19\nEven when the physical differences between the sexes were recognized,\nthey were not important until the end of the 1700s, when they became\nuseful in arguments for or against the role of women in education and\npublic life.20 It bears repeating that classifications are not neutral\u2014they\nare created in specific cultural contexts in relation to specific questions.\nQUEERING SEX AND GENDER BINARIES\nThe distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as\nsocially learned was popularized by John Money and Anke Ehrhardt and\nis now a standard view in academia and beyond.21 But even the sex-\ngender binary has been problematized by queer theory. Judith Butler\ninfluentially argued that our biology is not a neutral base on which gender\nis culturally constructed.22 As shown by Laqueur and others, even our\nbodies are culturally constructed in that they are understood in culturally\nspecific ways.23 According to Butler, \u201cPerhaps this construct called \u2018sex\u2019\nis as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always\nalready gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex\nand gender turns out to be no distinction at all.\u201d24\nAlthough some bioarchaeologists remind us that \u201csex has a material\nreality\u201d and that the conceptual separation of sex from gender has been\ngenerally productive, others have followed Butler in arguing that our 96 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nnow-standard sex-gender model often reduces gender to sex and tends\nto create normative and nonnormative gender categories that risk being\nas simplistic as racial categories.25\nFor example, in studies of women buried with weapons, like the\nfamous Moche Se\u00f1ora de Cao burial in Peru, normative approaches to\nsex and gender may lead to the creation of \u201can exotic \u2018gender type\u2019 . .\n. instead of simply a woman, probably taking part in war-like activities\nduring her life.\u201d26 A replica of Se\u00f1ora de Cao can be seen in figure 3.2.\nWe don\u2019t expect to find women warriors, so we are surprised when we\ndo, and this prompts us to treat them as anomalies in need of expla-\nnation. Taken at face value, however, imagery from the past often does\nnot present what we might consider nonnormative gender expression as\nnonnormative at all. One of the roles of the Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal,\nalso known as Itzpapalotl, was as a \u201cprimordial warrior,\u201d and she is\ndepicted with warrior imagery.27 In Maya art, women warriors are depicted\nsimilarly to their male counterparts.

Many questions remain about the Lord\nCornbury story, but it reminds us that trans behavior in other times and\nplaces may have symbolic resonance beyond simply deviance. Further\ncomplicating interpretation is a warning about projecting our notions\nof fixed, public identities\u2014including trans identities\u2014on ancient Meso-\namerica: \u201cMaya imaginations presented transsexuality as a strategy for\nunderstanding cosmic power. For other elements of transsexuality to fall\ncompletely outside of that context would have been unimaginable.\u201d42\nABJECTION AND NORMATIVITY\nHow does the reevaluation of gender and sex relate to sexuality? The\nhistorian Michel Foucault influentially argues that sex and sexuality are\nembedded in discourses shaped by power.43 More recently, the historian\nDavid Halperin\u2019s book How to Do the History of Homosexuality describes\nthe problems inherent in applying our contemporary concept of sexuality\nto other places and times.44 This attention to categorizations and binaries Queer New World 101\nis a hallmark of queer theory because categorizations of people and their\nactions depend on ideas about what is normal and what is deviant.45 In\nother words, culturally varied meanings of abjection and who is abject help abjection\ndefine and maintain the normative.

Fuglestvedt suggests that we consider a\nthe world.\nscale of intensity for societal interest in sex, gender, and sexuality.58 In\nthese terms, many contemporary people live in societies with unusually\nhigh-intensity attitudes to gender, sex, and sexuality.\nFor the Maya, \u201cthe data suggest not only that Maya gender ideolo-\ngies may not have been founded on a belief that binary biological sexes\ntranslate into binary gendered identities, but also that other aspects of\nsocial identity such as age or class may have played a more prominent\npart in determining gender roles.\u201d59 Ethnographic and colonial sources\nsuggest that the aging moon may have changed gender over the course of\nperformative the month\u2014did a similar model apply to aging people?

Some have called for more contex-\ntual, intersectional, from-the-ground-up studies in some cases focused\non individuals, not groups, thus \u201ceffectively deconstructing gender as an\nontological category.\u201d65 In this view,\nprehistoric identities do not rely on the notion of a core, sta-\nble self that remains unchanged throughout the life-course.\n. . . Instead, identity is context-dependent and enacted or\n\u201cembodied\u201d in ways that capture the \u201clived experiences\u201d of\npast peoples.66\nBecause \u201cwe enact exclusionary practices on our data through the analyt-\nical categories we deploy to make the past known to us,\u201d many scholars\nnow advocate intersectional approaches that allow variation along more\nthan one or two axes.67 The following are some New World examples.\nGender, Sexuality, Age, and Occupation\nA study of the early historical Chumash of California argues that undertak-\ners were either men who engaged in homosexual acts or postmenopausal\nwomen. They were categorized together because their sexual activity did\n\u201cnot result in conception and birth.\u201d68 In this case, occupation, age, and\nreproductive potential intersected with gender and sexual behavior in a\nclassification system that differs greatly from familiar contemporary ones.\nSexuality, Ethnicity, and Status\nLike gender, \u201csexuality may be thought about, experienced and acted\non differently according to age, class, ethnicity, physical ability, sexual\norientation and preference, religion, and region.\u201d69 Recognition of this\nis apparent in the concept of \u201cethnosexual conflict\u201d used in a study of\nSpanish colonialism \u201cto refer to the clash between incompatible cultural\nbeliefs and practices related to sexuality.\u201d70 Pete Sigal cites evidence for\nan institutionalized availability of \u201cpassives\u201d (the xochihuas mentioned\nlater) for elite men in precontact Aztec society.

For\nthe Maya, sexual desire and fantasy went beyond the field delineated by\nFreud and the sexologists. Sexual behavior did not exist as a discernible\ncategory of sexuality but rather as an element of ritual.\u201d78\nGender, Sexuality, and Colonialism\nGender and status were intimately linked in both Indigenous and colo-\nnial Latin America. Some Indigenous cultures (e.g., the Maya and Aztec)\nshared with the Spanish the idea that people conquered in war were\ngendered feminine, and sodomy was a metaphor for conquest: \u201cElites\namong the Maya considered passivity in males feminine and viewed the\nvanquished warrior as symbolically if not actually passive.\u201d79 Neverthe-\nless, many authors have argued that the intersection of gender, sexual-\nity, and status intensified during the Spanish invasion and subsequent\ncolonial period, leading to the increased oppression of women and Others\nof all sorts. 106 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 3.10. Indians being\nattacked by dogs; illustration\nfrom Les Grandes Voyages\n(1596) by Theodor de Bry\n(1528\u20131598). (CC-BY-SA\nTheodor de Bry.)\nEuropeans in the New World sought to eliminate\u2014often brutally\u2014\nexpressions of gender and sexuality that did not correspond with their\nInquisition-era ideas. An infamous print (figure 3.10) depicts Vasco\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, a Spanish explorer, conquistador, and governor, as he\n\u201cthrows some Indians, who had committed the terrible sin of sodomy,\nto the dogs to be torn apart.\u201d80 Indeed, one of the insidious legacies of\ncolonialism is the widespread idea that Indigenous cultures have always\nbeen conservative and restrictive around issues of gender, sex, and sexu-\nality when in many cases that conservatism was imposed on them during\ncolonization. Archaeologists and our colleagues in cultural anthropology\nand history are showing instead that the many pre-Columbian cultures\nof the New World held diverse ideas about these issues and that this\nevidence must be understood on its own terms, not on ours.\nCONCLUSION\nAcademics in many fields now challenge normative classifications of peo-\nple and behavior. Just as anthropologists long ago abandoned terms like\nsavage and the application of racial classifications, so in archaeology we\nare gradually abandoning the uncritical use of terms like heterosexual Queer New World 107\nand homosexual and ethnocentric assumptions about gender, sexuality,\nethnocentric\nand their centrality to identity. Foucault wrote about the role of experts in\nA term used in social\nmedicine and science in the creation of normative categories.81 Archaeol-\nsciences and anthropology\nogists are some of those experts, and we have become more self-critical\nto describe the act of\nabout our interpretations of issues around sex, gender, and sexuality.\njudging another culture\nThe heteronormativity of museum dioramas that present a timeless view by the values and\nof the nuclear family has been criticized.82 Even as recently as 2013 standards of one\u2019s own\na study of seventy years of reconstructions of ancient life in National culture in the belief that\nGeographic concluded that \u201cwomen and women\u2019s work are significantly one\u2019s culture is superior,\nunderrepresented and undervalued\u201d and that a \u201cvigorous archaeology of especially with respect\ngender has had little impact on the magazine\u2019s imagined past.\u201d83 Clearly, to language, behavior,\ncustoms, and religion.\nwe have more to do. Archaeologists who engage with these issues are\nnot just trying to dig up LGBTQ+ people; we are trying to challenge\nnormativity in all its forms.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 Why is an understanding of queer theory important in study-\ning ancient gender and sexuality through archaeology?\n\u2022 What are three examples of the social construction of sex,\ngender, and sexuality in either the present or the ancient\npast?\n\u2022 How do heteronormativity, gender performativity, and binary\noppositions influence interpretations of the past?\n\u2022 How would you define intersectionality, and why is it im-\nportant to queer archaeology?\n\u2022 How has the study of sex and gender changed over the years\nin archaeology?\nRESEARCH RESOURCES\nCompiled by Rosalinda Linares\n\u2022 Discuss: Choose one or two resources listed in this chapter,\nand discuss them in relation to what you have learned about\nqueer archaeology.\n\u2022 Present: Choose a key topic or event found in this chapter.\nThen locate one or two resources from the \u201cQuick Dip\u201d and\n\u201cDeep Dive\u201d sections and develop a presentation for the class. 108 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nExplain the significance of the topic, and provide additional\ndetails that support your explanation.\n\u2022 Create: What idea, person, or event from this chapter really\nmoved you?

She discusses the evolution of research in the archaeology\nof gender and sex as a subdiscipline beginning in the 1980s, when archae-\nologists began to more directly explore and interrogate gender roles, labor,\nand societal structures of the past. In the latter half of the interview, Joyce\ndescribes the emergence of feminist and queer archaeology in the 1990s\nas a rejection of archaeological practices that naturalized gender and sex\nas heteronormative and binaristic. Joyce discusses many detailed examples\nfrom the Paleolithic, Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, medieval, and\nMesoamerican time periods and up to modern ethnographies to illustrate\nthe varied methods and interpretations used in the study of gender, sex,\nand sexuality in the archaeological record.\n\u201cQueer Archaeology,\u201d from Chelsea Blackmore and\nMegan Springate\nChelsea Blackmore is assistant professor of anthropology at the University\nof California, Santa Cruz, and Megan Springate is a historical archaeol- Queer New World 109\nogist who edited and contributed to LGBTQ America: A Theme Study of\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer History for the National\nPark Foundation and the National Park Service. In this interview, on\nthe podcast Go Dig a Hole, hosted by Christopher Sims (https://player.\nfm/series/go-dig-a-hole/queer-archaeology-episode-16), they provide a\nbroader view of queer archaeology, including not only theory and site-\nbased scholarship but also how queering the field is present in other\ntypes of professional work. Blackmore discusses definitions of queer\narchaeology in relation to queer theory and feminist theory, underscor-\ning contributions by eminent figures in the field. Springate introduces the\nLGBTQ Heritage project within the National Park Service, which preserves\nimportant LGBTQ+ sites on the National Register of Historic Places of\nthe National Historic Landmarks program.

The group focuses on queer experience in the field, and\nits interests lie in supporting professional archaeologists who identify as\nLGBTQ+. They advocate for establishing a network of scholars interested\nin sexuality studies and other forms of queer research; work to develop a\nsupport and mentorship program for LGBTQ+ archaeologists as a means\nto connect senior, junior, and student archaeologists; and facilitate the\ninvolvement of LGBTQ+ archaeologists in all aspects of the SAA.

Joyce\nIn this book, Rosemary Joyce explores the variety of ways in which social\nlife has been organized by sex. She considers how ancient Greeks thought\nof men and women as different expressions of a single sexual potential\nand how Native American societies understood sexual identity. The book\nexplains how archaeologists use the material remains of ancient cultures\nto learn about gender and sexuality. Joyce asks us to think about how\nthese understandings might challenge us to think differently about our\nlives now (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2008).\nGender and Archaeology: Contesting the Past,\nby Roberta Gilchrist\nIn this book, Roberta Gilchrist provides a thorough overview of the defi-\nnitions, interests, and methods of gender archaeology and evaluates the\never-expanding role of gender studies in archaeology. Gilchrist draws from\nthe previous decade of research, and thus this work represents the midpoint\nin the twenty-year span of interest in gender and queer archaeology in the\ntwenty-first century. Gilchrist begins in the first chapter by situating growth\nin gender archaeology within the progression of feminism and continues in\nthe next chapter to interrogate how archaeological knowledge is gendered.\nThe following chapters consider the relationship between, on one hand,\nproduction and social processes of gender in the archaeology of labor and\ntechnology and, on the other, representations of gender identity, sexuality,\nand the body in art, space, and grave goods. The book concludes with\na case study of a medieval English castle, putting into practice concepts\ndiscussed in the previous chapters (New York: Routledge, 2012).\nGender and Power in Prehispanic Mesoamerica,\nby Rosemary A. Joyce\nRosemary Joyce, who has made significant contributions to the materiality\nand archaeology of gender, sex, and sexuality, invokes Judith Butler\u2019s Queer New World 111\ntheoretical work on gender performance to situate this volume on gender\nin Mesoamerica. Joyce analyzes material evidence and gender depictions\nand roles dating from the formative Mesoamerica, Classic and Postclassic\nMaya, and then the Aztec periods. In this important work on gender and\narchaeology, Joyce reexamines the material record to reveal the contrasts\nbetween European and Mesoamerican gender ideologies in order to find\nalternative ways of understanding our material past (Austin: University\nof Texas Press, 2000).\nHow to Do the History of Male Homosexuality,\nby David M. Halperin\nHalperin takes a social constructionist or historicist approach to human\nsexuality, stressing the contextual variation of sexuality across time and\nspace. The book challenges the use of current, taken-for-granted ideas\nabout sexuality in historical interpretation (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress, 2002).\n\u201cQueer Archaeologies,\u201d edited by Thomas A. Dowson\nIn this 2000 issue of World Archaeology (volume 32, number 2), issue\neditor Thomas A. Dowson introduces queer archaeology as a challenge to\nthe normative ideas and practices entrenched in current archaeology. This\npeer-reviewed journal was the first in the field of archaeology to devote\nan entire issue to defining and discussing queer archaeologies, and this\nissue is frequently cited as representative of the origins of queer studies in\narchaeology. Dowson is a pioneer in the subfield of queer archaeologies.\nThe articles include an anonymous autobiographical statement on the\ninfluence of sex and sexuality on a practicing archaeologist, homophobia\nand women in archaeology, queer theory and its relation to the study of\nthe material past, an exploration of autoarchaeology and neo-shamanism,\nand biotechnology as a site of queer archaeology. Notably, several articles\nfocus on the interpretation, or in some cases reinterpretation, of the mate-\nrial record as inclusive of same-sex relationships and the nonnormative.\nThe issue as a whole gives the reader a rounded perspective of the shape\nof queer archaeology in the field at the end of the twentieth century.\n\u201cSexuality Studies in Archaeology,\u201d by Barbara L. Voss\nIn this article, Voss offers a comprehensive review of the state of sex-\nuality studies as of 2008. A well-known scholar who focuses on sex-\nuality studies in archaeology, Voss examines five areas: reproduction\nmanagement, sexual representations, sexual identities, prostitution, and\nthe sexual politics of institutions. Of note is a section at the end of the 112 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\narticle on queer archaeologies, where Voss draws a distinction between\nsexuality research in archaeology and applying queer theory to archae-\nology, because Voss affirms the increasing influence and possibilities of\nqueer theory in archaeological methods regarding sexuality and its wider\napplications to social identity. The article appears in Annual Review of\nAnthropology (volume 37, number 1; https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/\nabs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085238).\n\u201cTowards an Inclusive Queer Archaeology,\u201d\nby Dawn M. Rutecki and Chelsea Blackmore\nThe authors explore the challenges and opportunities faced by LGBTQ+\narchaeologists in this short introduction to a 2016 special issue of SAA\nArchaeological Record (volume 16, number 1; http://onlinedigeditions.\ncom/publication/?i=287180) from the Society for American Archaeology.\nGLOSSARY\nabjection. The state of being cast off. Poststructural explorations find the\nterm\u2019s use inherently disturbing to conventional identity and cultural\nconcepts. One who is abject has been rejected.\nAndes.

A scientific discipline concerned with the biological and\nbehavioral aspects of human beings, their extinct hominin ancestors,\nand related nonhuman primates, particularly from an evolutionary\nperspective.\nbioarchaeologists. Those who study human remains in archaeological\nsites. First coined by British archaeologist Grahame Clark in 1972\nas a reference to zooarchaeology, the study of animal bones from\narchaeological sites.\ncounterhegemonic. A confrontation or opposition to a status quo or\nhegemonic power and its legitimacy in politics, but also appears in\nother spheres of life, such as history, media, and music.\ncritical theory. The reflective assessment and critique of society and\nculture by applying knowledge from the social sciences and the\nhumanities to reveal and challenge power structures. Critical theory\nhas origins in sociology and also in literary criticism. Queer New World 113\nethnocentric. A term used in social sciences and anthropology to describe\nthe act of judging another culture by the values and standards of\none\u2019s own culture in the belief that one\u2019s culture is superior, espe-\ncially with respect to language, behavior, customs, and religion.\nfeminism. A range of social movements, political movements, and ide-\nologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve\nthe political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\ngender complementarity. Men and women (and other genders, if they\nare recognized) play similarly important roles but in different areas\nof social life. Gender complementarity more accurately describes gen-\nder relations than gender hierarchy in some times and places.\ngender fluidity. Cultural ideas about gender frequently imply that one\u2019s\ngender identity is fixed and unchanging. Gender fluidity describes\nsituations in which a person\u2019s gender identity may change through-\nout the life cycle or in different contexts.\ngender hierarchy. How genders are ranked. Men are typically ranked\nhigher than women, having more power, prestige, and so on.\ngender parallelism. Men and women (and other genders, if culturally\nrecognized) have similar levels of power and prestige but in different\nareas of social life.

An artifact that has been removed from its original\narchaeological context, usually illegally, by nonarchaeologists who\ndo not record contextual information. Looted artifacts are often sold\non the art market away from their place of origin. Archaeologists\ndespise looting because an artifact without context is much less\ninformative about the culture that produced it than an artifact with\ncontextual information.\nMesoamerica. An archaeological region defined by precontact cultural\ntraits such as a distinctive calendar system, maize agriculture, and\nstate-level political organization. It extended from northern Mex-\nico through Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,\nand northern Costa Rica. Within this region pre-Columbian societies\nflourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nnormativity. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of desig-\nnating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible\nand others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. 114 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nperformative.

For stages two\nand three, scholars have debated how best to tell LGBTQ+ history\u2014what\ncounts as a first, who and what historians should emphasize, what places\nto highlight. Stage-four scholars stopped declaring that anyone who wrote\nintimately about someone of the same gender was \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian\u201d\n(why not bisexual?) and instead questioned how time-bound those terms\nare and debated how to identify people from time periods before society\nwidely considered sexual orientation an identity.\nThis chapter takes the approach that LGBTQ+ history hinges on\nhow concepts of sexuality and gender have changed to produce today\u2019s\nidentities, how queer Americans have formed community, and how these\nminority groups have forged movements using different tactics to gain\nrights and freedoms amid resistance and backlash. The chapter synthe-\nsizes formative, respected scholarship and includes some primary sources\nand recent research. It discusses the social construction of sex, gender,\nand sexuality; how LGBTQ+ intersects with other structures of inequal-\nity that social institutions have enforced; and how LGBTQ+ people have\nstruggled for social justice despite resistance and setbacks.\nIdeas about sexuality and gender have changed historically. This\nbasic premise is one of the ways that we know that sex, gender, and\nsexuality are social constructs\u2014that is, they are ideas that emerge from\nsociety and are changed through social action. Queer Americans have\nformed different types of communities in different historical eras, and\nLGBTQ+ people have struggled for social justice. The political struggles of\nLGBTQ+ people intersect with and have been influenced by other struggles\nfor social justice, like civil rights and women\u2019s rights.\nnorms\nNORMS IN COLONIAL AMERICA THROUGH\nCollective representations\nTHE LATE 1800S\nof acceptable group\nconduct as well as\nWhite Settler Colonial Norms individual perceptions of\nparticular group conduct.\nColonial Europeans established norms of marital reproduction and a sex-\nessentialist\nual double standard within gender roles, which rendered what fell outside\nThe view that every entity\nthese two ideals unacceptable.3 The Europeans\u2019 encounters with nearly six\nhas a set of attributes\nhundred indigenous nations and all the ways these societies constructed\nthat are necessary to its\ngender and allowed varied sexual practices challenged European essen-\nidentity and function.\ntialist beliefs.

Legal statutes deemed\nsodomy (oral or anal sex) unnatural, a sin and a crime.9\nAn English servant\u2019s case illustrates how class also intersected with\ngender and sexuality in colonial America. Thomasine Hall lived as a girl,\nwoman, and man before migrating to Virginia in 1627 as a male inden-\ntured servant, Thomas. There Hall\u2019s sewing skills and sporadic dress in\nwomen\u2019s clothes led neighbor women to question Hall\u2019s gender. A group\nof women physically examined Hall three times. Amid rumors that Hall\nfornicated with a serving woman, the General Court assessed Hall\u2019s gen-\nder. Examiners declared Hall had male genitalia. Hall\u2019s response according\nto the court records was \u201chee had not the use of the mans parte\u201d and \u201cI\nhave a peece of an hole [vulva].\u201d10 After townswomen refused the official\nruling that Hall was female, the court decreed Hall must wear a combi-\nnation of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing. We will never know whether Hall\nwas intersex or what to call Hall\u2019s sexual desire. Evidence suggests that,\nlike other colonists, Hall enjoyed sex for pleasure outside of marriage. U.S. LGBTQ+ History 125\nAnglo society was more bothered by fluidity than hybridity in wanting\nto fix Hall in place as both woman and man.11\nGender, racial, and class hierarchies established by the eighteenth\ncentury all helped shape twentieth-century LGBTQ+ organizing, but\nfirst people had to start forming communities based on their same-sex\nrelationships.\nPASSIONLESS WOMEN, ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIPS,\nAND VANGUARD COMMUNITIES\nFrom the American Revolution through the Civil War, defining sex as acts\nrather than as the basis for social identity continued. New gender norms,\nhowever, affected attitudes toward same-gender attraction. Americans\nsame-gender attraction\nin the early republic rejected previous colonial-era views of women as\nAttraction between\nsexual beings.

Contemporaries were more likely to attribute a sexual\ncloseness beyond what is\ncomponent to romantic friendships between men, like the poet Walt\ncommon in contemporary\nWhitman\u2019s with Peter Doyle, than to women\u2019s relationships because of\nWestern societies.\nsociety\u2019s continued belief that a penis was necessary for sex.14\nIndustrialization through the 1800s also played a role in forming\ncommunities based on sexual orientation. As industries spread, more peo-\nple migrated to larger urban centers for factory and related jobs and into\nplaces for raw production that had extreme gender imbalances. Despite\nthe prevalent view that same-sex affection was behavior anyone might\nshow, rather than an identity, communities based on same-sex attraction\nformed. By the late 1800s, New York City had developed a subculture with\nidentity terms like fairy for effeminate working-class men and queer for\nfairy\ngender normative men who loved men.15 New Orleans was another hub.\nA term from 1800s New\nAn array of woman-woman relationships also existed, usually divided\nYork applied to effeminate\nby class and race.

With the emergence of sexology, gender nonnormativity and same-\nsex attraction were now mental illness, in addition to being violations of\nreligious ideas about sin and criminal laws. Although queer communities\ncontinued to spread, society\u2019s validation of romantic friendships declined,\nand antivice campaigns arose by the 1920s and punished queer public\nexpression. After Prohibition ended, federal and state officials enacted\nlaws to control alcoholic beverages, to police respectability in bars. State\nagents held authority to revoke alcohol licenses if bar owners allowed\nthe presence of undesirables like prostitutes, gamblers, gays, or lesbians\n(terms in the popular culture by the 1920s), who according to these laws,\nmade establishments disorderly.22 From the 1930s through the 1960s\npolice freely busted bar patrons on suspicion of homosexuality.23\nDuring World War II the military spread the normalization of het-\nerosexuality and negative perceptions of \u201cthe homosexual.\u201d Psychologists\nconvinced military officials that homosexuality was a mental disorder that\nthreatened morale and discipline. As eighteen million men moved through U.S. LGBTQ+ History 127\ndraft boards and induction stations, staffers asked questions designed\nto exclude gay men from service. Such questions heightened recognition\nthat homosexuality existed even while pathologizing it. Officials feared\nthat straight men would claim to be gay to avoid the draft; to deter this,\nthey labeled anyone rejected for homosexuality as a \u201csexual psychopath\u201d\nand gave employers the right to review draft records. Women\u2019s auxiliary\nunits started in World War II, but because criminal law usually ignored\nlesbian sex acts, the military did not similarly screen women recruits. Gay\nservice members caught having sex or suspected of it faced humiliating\nexpulsion after systematic inquisitions, which left several thousand men\nand dozens of women with undesirable discharges on their records.24\nGay and lesbian communities proliferated during and after the war,\nespecially in cities with a military presence.25 During the Cold War, fed-\neral, state, and local authorities redoubled efforts to achieve a straight\nstate, including congressional laws and a presidential executive order\nagainst employing homosexuals in federal jobs.26 Recent scholars have\nargued that the 1950s McCarthy Red Scare most victimized gay men and\nlesbians.27 George Harris was among thousands fired.

The founders stepped down in favor of\nleaders who argued that the mostly white, middle-class, gay members\nwere the same as heterosexual citizens, aside from the private sphere of\nlove. They focused on gaining allies among heterosexual psychologists,\nclergymen, and public officials. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Del Martin,\nPhillis Lyons, and their group, Daughters of Bilitis, also \u201cwere fighting\nthe church, the couch, and the courts\u201d for equality. Like the more male-\nrun Mattachine Review and One magazine, Daughters of Bilitis\u2019s journal,\nThe Ladder (figure 4.2), consistently assured lesbians of their worth\nas respectable middle-class people deserving treatment equal to hetero-\nsexuals.31 Chapters of both organizations spread to the East Coast and\nMidwest, forming a web of advocates for homosexual civil rights by the\nmid-1960s who published, lobbied, and picketed the White House and\ncity governments for equality.\nBy the 1960s, various social movements were developing tactics to\nfight discrimination and inequality. Black civil rights legal work and direct\naction produced court-ordered desegregation, antidiscrimination law, and\nvoting rights, although centuries of housing segregation, education, and\njob discrimination continued to racialize poverty. Frustrations rose in poor\ncommunities of color over police brutality and the dearth of economic\nopportunities. In 1965, gay and lesbian street youth organized in San\nFrancisco. They and trans women often gathered at Compton\u2019s Cafeteria,\none of few places where they could meet. When Compton\u2019s management U.S. LGBTQ+ History 129\nFigure 4.2.

The next night, trans hustlers and street people picketed\nCompton\u2019s and protested police brutality. Although the protest did not\nend abuse, a new collective militant queer resistance pushed the city to\naddress queer and trans people\u2019s rights as citizens.32\nThree years later the Stonewall rebellion broke out after a New York\nCity police raid. Stonewall Inn was a Mafia-run dive that blackmailed gay\nWall Street patrons and used those funds to pay off police. In return, police\ngave the Stonewall advance warning of raids. Raids targeted those in full\ndrag and trans sex workers like Sylvia Rivera. But raids could also ruin\nthe lives of white, Black, and Latinx gay and lesbian customers; newspaper\nexposure often led to their being fired from jobs or evicted from housing.\nOn June 28, 1969, there was no tip-off for the police raid. Trans and lesbian\npatrons resisted\u2014refusing to produce identification or to follow a female\nofficer to the bathroom to verify their sex for arrest. They also objected to\nofficers groping them.33 A growing crowd outside spontaneously responded\nto police violence by hurling coins and cans at officers, who retreated into\nthe bar. Rioting resumed a second and third night. The gay poet Allen\nGinsberg heard slogans being chanted and crowed, \u201cGay power! Isn\u2019t that\ngreat! We\u2019re one of the largest minorities in the country\u201410 percent, you\nknow. It\u2019s about time we did something to assert ourselves.\u201d34\nThe Stonewall rebellion also did not stop police raids, but mainstream\nand gay coverage and leafleting spurred the creation of gay organizing\nthat was more militant than previous homophile groups. The Gay Liber-\nation Front sought to combine freedom from homophobia with a broader\npolitical platform that denounced racism and opposed capitalism. From the\nGay Liberation Front arose the Gay Activists Alliance and its \u201czaps,\u201d or\nsurprise public confrontations with politicians to force them to acknowl-\nedge gay and lesbian rights.35 Gay liberationists like Carl Wittman drew\non past New Left antiwar student activism and the women\u2019s liberation\nmovement. Wittman\u2019s \u201cRefugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\u201d (1970)\nrails against homophobia, imploring gays to free themselves by coming\nout while also acknowledging it will be too dangerous for some. Witt-\nman was attuned to the rise of lesbian feminism, which linked sexism\nand homophobia. Lesbian feminists emphasized women\u2019s autonomy and\nwell-being rather than identification as mothers, wives, and daughters\nwho indirectly gained from what benefited men. Wittman deemed male\nchauvinism antigay and urged gay men to stop being sexist. Rather than\nmimic straight society, gay liberation should reject gender roles and mar-\nriage and should embrace queens as having gutsily stood out.36\nGay liberationists continued the fight to overturn homophobia in\nreligion, psychology, and law. Gay Catholics formed Dignity in 1969.37 U.S. LGBTQ+ History 131\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association urged an end to legal and social\nexpressions of antigay discrimination in 1970, and the United Church of\nChrist ordained the first openly gay person in 1972. Episcopalians started\nIntegrity in 1974. Mainstream Protestant denominations like the Presby-\nterian Church (USA), United Methodist Church, and Lutheran Church in\nAmerica endorsed decriminalization but still disapproved of homosexual-\nity. Fundamentalist evangelicals became increasingly vocal among denom-\ninations opposed to same-sex relationships and gender nonconformity.\nThey began conservative religious organizing in response to progressive\nchanges, propelling to celebrity status some ministers on the right such as\nJerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and Jim and Tammy Bakker. Some LGBTQ+\nChristians flocked to the Pentecostal minister Rev. Troy Perry. He founded\nthe Metropolitan Community Church denomination from a house-based\nservice in 1968. Meanwhile, gay Jews in Los Angeles created the first\ngay synagogue in 1972.38 Gay-friendly or gay-run houses of worship\nproliferated over the decade, but the majority of LGBTQ+ Americans faced\ndiscrimination in unwelcoming religious congregations.\nIn addition to trying to integrate religious spaces, gay liberationists\ndemonstrated for the removal of homosexuality from the American Psy-\nchiatric Association list of mental disorders. Activists and gay counsel-\nors knew people were not sick for being queer. They used the research\nfindings of their ally, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker; she had demon-\nstrated, on the basis of personality tests she had conducted since 1957,\nthat gay men were equally stable as heterosexual men and sometimes\nshowed more resilience.39 In 1973 the association voted unanimously to\ndefine homosexuality in its diagnostic manual as \u201cone form of sexual\nFigure 4.3. A\nGay Liberation\nFront logo.\n(CC-0.) 132 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nbehavior, like other forms of sexual behavior which are not by them-\nselves psychiatric disorders.\u201d40 This was a major win on the long road\nto discrediting claims that homosexuality was a mental illness and the\nconversion therapies designed to \u201ccure\u201d homosexuals. However, in 1980\nthe American Psychiatric Association\u2019s third manual introduced \u201cgen-\nder identity disorder of childhood\u201d and \u201ctranssexualism\u201d as disorders,\nindicating it preserved a concern about variety in gendered behavior,\nwhich sustained forced conversion programs for children and adolescents\nwithout increasing access to medical services that some trans adults\nwanted.41\nPolitically, in the 1970s efforts to gain equal rights ordinances and to\nelect lesbian and gay politicians became fruitful. Elaine Noble joined the\nMassachusetts House of Representatives in 1974, and Harvey Milk won\na seat in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors election in 1977.42 The\nconservative campaign of Anita Bryant that overturned Florida\u2019s Miami-\nDade County gay rights ordinance in 1977 galvanized conservatives on\nthe Christian right and gay activists nationwide against or for, respec-\ntively, extending equal rights regardless of sexual orientation. The next\nyear activists managed to prevent California from passing an initiative\nthat would have barred gay teachers from working in public schools. But\ncities with antigay campaigns experienced increased violence against gay\nand lesbian people and their businesses, centers, and churches, culmi-\nnating in the murder of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone by a\nformer board of supervisors member and ex-policeman, Dan White, in\n1978. White was convicted of manslaughter and served five years.43\nAmid the volatile cultural battles of the 1970s, there were some vic-\ntories. By the end of the decade, activists had decriminalized themselves\nin just under half the nation by overturning twenty-two state sodomy\nstatutes, had countered antigay city initiatives, and had convinced the\nDemocratic Party to include a plank against sexual orientation\u2013based dis-\ncrimination in its 1980 platform.44 They would have to wait until 2003\nfor the Supreme Court decision on Lawrence v. Texas to strike down\nsodomy laws nationwide.45\nThe 1970s also saw a cultural renaissance of LGBTQ+ institution\nbuilding and cultural productions through publishing and music. More\nAmericans came out despite the real hazards of family rejection, violence,\nand legal discrimination. Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson survived\nsuch dangers to start Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR)\nin 1970.

The mortality\nrate of the original patients was 100 percent. Panic spread as media,\nmany government officials, and the gay community asked what linked the\naffected gay men. Connecting a deadly disease, ultimately called acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to gay male sexuality provided a new\nrationale for discriminatory laws and harassment as the political power\nof the Christian Right continued to ascend.49\nIn response to AIDS, LGBTQ+ Americans organized new institutions\nand created new methods to get needed resources, which furthered lively\ndebates over political tactics. Because the health care system failed to 134 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\naddress the epidemic\u2019s causes and consequences, New York City gay men\nfounded Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis in 1982. It became a model for AIDS\nservice organizations that offered information and support to prevent or\ntreat the disease.50 Lesbians contributed experience from the women\u2019s\nhealth movement, where they had countered male-dominated medicine\nwith their own research and support networks. Black Panther\u2013sponsored\nfree breakfasts and community health clinics became a model for AIDS\nservice organizations.51 By 1983 the group People With AIDS had mobi-\nlized nationally to demand control over decisions about their care and\nto draw attention to scapegoating that resulted in job loss and refusal of\nhospital treatment. They released \u201cThe Denver Principles,\u201d which asserted\ntheir responsibility to use \u201clow-risk sexual behaviors\u201d without denying\ntheir right to \u201csatisfying sexual and emotional lives.\u201d52 The gay com-\nmunity split on whether to blame casual sex with multiple partners for\nthe crisis and how to contain the spread of the disease. As city public\nhealth officials sought to shut down bathhouses and bars that had spaces\nfor sex, some gay activists agreed with the precaution, but others saw\nthe campaign as more antigay harassment. Those opposed to closures\nargued that instead of driving gay sex further underground, public sites\nlike bathhouses should become education centers for safer sex practices.\nMeeting spaces were places where the community organized efficiently\nto respond to AIDS.53\nA major contributor to the AIDS epidemic was willful neglect by the\nfederal government. For the first five years of the epidemic, President\nRonald Reagan remained silent about it. In 1986 he and governors from\nboth parties proposed cutting government spending on AIDS. That year\nthe Supreme Court ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick that gay adults did not\nhave constitutional privacy rights that would protect them from prose-\ncution for private, consensual sex.54 The Justice Department announced\nthat federal law allowed employment discrimination based on HIV/AIDS\nstatus. When Reagan spoke briefly at the Third International Confer-\nence on AIDS in 1987 in favor of testing, over twenty thousand of the\nthirty-six thousand Americans diagnosed with AIDS had died. Congress\nprohibited using federal funds for AIDS education that condoned same-\nsex behavior but mandated testing of federal prisoners and immigrants\nto bar entry to those with HIV.55\nThis spurred high-impact radical organizing. Larry Kramer and\ncofounders formed the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in\n1987. It further publicized the New York City slogan \u201cSilence = Death\u201d in\ndemonstrations. ACT UP dramatically disrupted Wall Street, the Food and\nDrug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and Saint Patrick\u2019s\nCathedral to protest the high cost of AZT (the first drug treatment) and\nthe appointment of a loudly homophobic Catholic cardinal to the Presiden- U.S. LGBTQ+ History 135\ntial HIV Commission. ACT UP chapters spread to other cities; the groups\nbecame known for their insistence on action and their reclaiming of the\nterm queer.56 Keith Haring\u2019s graffiti art spread the message.

During the second March on Washington in October 1987,\nvolunteers laid out 1,920 panels on the National Mall.57\nIn tandem with responses to AIDS, often-overlooked portions of\nLGBTQ+ Americans organized. Trans people were disproportionately\npoor owing to job discrimination and devastating budget cuts to AIDS\nprograms, welfare, and health programs. For-profit centers sold medical\nprocedures for gender transition at high costs. Bisexuals started forming\nsocial and then political rights groups, including the National Bisexual\nLiberation Group in 1972 based in New York City, San Francisco\u2019s Bisex-\nual Center in 1976, and the national BiPOL in San Francisco in 1983.\nWhen the 1987 March on Washington organizers would not include \u201cbi\u201d\nor \u201ctrans\u201d in the march\u2019s title or list of demands, both constituencies\nargued that the category \u201cgay and lesbian\u201d was not inclusive.58 New\ntrans groups arose with transnational scope, including FTM International\n(advocating for the female-to-male trans community) and International\nFoundation for Gender Education, along with periodicals like Metamor-\nphosis and Tapestry.59\nFigure 4.4.

Although radi-\ncal, multicommunity AIDS activism continued, work for mainstream legal\nprotections and rights dominated LGBTQ+ activism. LGBTQ+ Americans\nand supporters sought inclusion in the military, the passage of antidis-\ncrimination laws, and marriage equality. After a campaign promise to\nend military exclusion, President Bill Clinton responded to pushback from\nmilitary leaders with a compromise. He supported a congressional law\nthat instructed LGBTQ+ service members to remain closeted and military\nofficials not to pursue people for discharge (figure 4.5).

(CC-BY-SA Ted\nEytan.) 140 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nCONCLUSION\nLGBTQ+ history in the United States has witnessed profound transforma-\ntions in meanings, the social construction of identities, and how LGBTQ+\npeople have used collective action to fight for rights and equality. For\ncenturies laws touted marriage as the place for reproductive sex but\nallowed some men sex for pleasure across race and class. When sex was\nconsidered simply a form of behavior and society believed women and\nmen were fundamentally different, same-gender intimacy that was not\nobviously sodomy was deemed unremarkable. But as sexologists cate-\ngorized sexuality into normal or pathological identities, psychology and\nmedical science joined the church and state as key social institutions\nthat demonized LGBTQ+ people. Communities of gay and bisexual men,\nlesbian and bisexual women, and trans people multiplied in the 1950s\ndespite heightened repression, and a portion of these minorities organized\nfor equal rights. Even the HIV/AIDS epidemic, blamed on and falsely\nidentified with gays, could not stop LGBTQ+ organizing. Activists further\ndeveloped radical tactics from the 1970s to call for liberation from het-\neronormativity. Legal gains have been arduously won, but foundational\npower imbalances based on race, class, gender, ability, and citizenship\npersist. Nonetheless, both legal and cultural changes continue to trans-\nform society.\nPROFILE: INSTITUTIONALIZING SEXUALITY:\nSEXOLOGY, PSYCHOANALYSIS, AND THE LAW\nJennifer Miller and Clark A. Pomerleau\nSEXOLOGY, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND CRIMINALIZATION\nEuropean scientists and social scientists developed the social science\nknown as sexology to understand human sexuality. They used biology,\nmedicine, psychology, and anthropology to support beliefs that privileged\nbinary gender identities (man or woman) and reproductive sex while\ntrying to account for gender and sexual diversity. What was at stake for\nthe men who created sexology varied: some felt same-sex attraction, some\nwere sympathetic to those who did, others opposed same-sex behaviors.\nTheir findings became arguments for and against criminalizing same-sex\nbehavior. This profile\u2019s history of sexology prioritizes primary sources to\nconsider how sexologists explained diversity in gender and sexuality and\nhow the field\u2019s spokespersons shifted from an initial focus on social jus-\ntice to creating oppressive, pathologizing diagnoses. Knowing this history U.S. LGBTQ+ History 141\nhelps us understand sexology\u2019s long-reaching implications as a method by\nwhich people worldwide have been taught about queer and trans people.\nThe earliest form of sexology combatted legal discrimination.

Silberstein\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nUpon completion of this chapter, students will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Describe how people struggle for social justice within histor-\nical contexts of inequality.\n\u2022 Recognize that progress faces resistance and does not follow\na linear path.\n\u2022 Identify key approaches within LGBTQ+ studies, and discuss\nat least the legal history approach in detail.\nINTRODUCTION\nHistorians often face the difficult task of determining how and when to tell\nthe story of certain events, ideas, or people. This is no less true in telling\nthe history of LGBTQ+ law in the United States. It may be surprising to\nmany, but LGBTQ+ laws have a long, storied past and have existed as\nlong as the United States itself. Laws enacted at local and state levels\nhave long been used to regulate acceptable sex and gender norms. For\nexample, in Arresting Dress, Clare Sears writes about the nineteenth-cen-\ntury San Francisco laws that outlawed cross-dressing.1 These laws and\nresistance to them tell important stories about how LGBTQ+ practices\nwere regulated. This chapter focuses on some of the key legal doctrines\nthat have been crucial in determining the overall landscape of LGBTQ+\nrights in the United States and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the\nU.S. Constitution and its application to protecting members of LGBTQ+\ncommunities.\n164 LGBTQ+ Legal History 165\nThroughout this chapter it is important to remember that our system\nof constitutional law is premised on the rights enumerated in the federal\nconstitution being natural rights\u2014that is, rights that are inalienable and\npreexist our government. What this means is that the Bill of Rights, Bill of Rights\nthe first ten amendments to the Constitution, does not grant any rights. The first ten amendments\nRather, each amendment represents a mandate for the government to not to the U.S. Constitution\ninterfere with individual rights or to not prevent others from doing so. containing specific\nFor example, the First Amendment right to free speech does not mean guarantees of personal\nthat the government has to give you the means to speak, but it cannot freedoms and rights,\ninterfere with your inalienable right to do so.2 Crucial to any claim to clear limitations on\nthe government\u2019s\nprotected rights is that one must be recognized as human.

Finally, we briefly consider recent issues before the\ncourt that go beyond sexual rights but strike at core understandings of\nLGBTQ+ equality.\nSEXUAL RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION\nThe U.S. Constitution approved by the delegates to the 1787 Constitutional\nConvention did not include the protection of rights that were enumerated\nin the ten constitutional amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, that\nwere eventually ratified in 1791. These amendments included guarantees\nsuch as the right to free speech, the right to due process, and the right\nto a speedy trial.3 What was not enumerated or made explicit was a right\nto sexual liberty. How, then, would \u201cwe the people\u201d come to expect the\nNinth Amendment\nConstitution to protect such rights, particularly with respect to same-sex\nA part of the Bill of\nsexualities? An answer to this question begins with the Ninth Amend-\nRights, this amendment\nment\u2019s statement that \u201cthe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain\naddresses rights,\nrights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by\nretained by the people,\nthe people.\u201d The inclusion of this amendment makes clear that the rights\nthat are not specifically\nexplicitly stated were not exclusive of those that were unenumerated and\nenumerated in the\nthose that could not be anticipated. As the authors of Sexual Rights in\nConstitution.\nAmerica write, \u201cAs the guardian of fundamental rights unanticipated or\nunderappreciated two centuries past, the Ninth Amendment transforms\nthe Constitution from a static record of our forebears\u2019 political and moral\nunderstandings into a dynamic and evolving expression of our basic\nrights.\u201d4 To be clear, the Ninth Amendment was not intended to protect\nthe rights of all. As noted earlier, rights were explicitly denied to the\nenslaved Africans and African Americans who were considered to be not\nhuman but chattel, \u201cthe name given to things which in law are deemed\npersonal property.\u201d5 Nor was the full range of rights available to women,\nparticularly married women, who essentially merged their individuality\ninto that of their husbands under the law of coverture. This meant that\ncoverture\nwomen were not only denied the vote but, when married, could not sign\nA legal doctrine whereby,\ncontracts or conduct other business independent from their husbands.6\nupon marriage, a\nNevertheless, the inclusion of the Ninth Amendment in the Bill of\nwoman\u2019s legal rights and\nobligations are subsumed Rights provides a basis for protecting those rights considered to be nat-\nby those of her husband. ural and thus fundamental to liberty. As some have argued, this includes\nbasic sexual rights, although the range and extent of these rights remains\na source of great division among legal scholars and advocates.7 This\nwas precisely the point made by Justice Arthur Goldberg (figure 5.1) in\nhis concurring opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), in which the LGBTQ+ Legal History 167\nFigure 5.1. Arthur J. Goldberg.\n(CC-0 Bert Verhoeff.)\nSupreme Court found that a married couple had the fundamental right to\nprivacy within marriage.8 Arguing that the Ninth Amendment provided\na constitutional basis for recognizing this fundamental right, Goldberg\nstated,\nTo hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-\nrooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be\ninfringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words\nby the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore\nthe Ninth Amendment, and to give it no effect whatsoever.9\nFourteenth Amendment\nAdopted on July\nDespite what might appear to be an easy way to expand on the\n9, 1868, as one of\nrights protected by the Ninth Amendment, the court has rarely addressed\nthe Reconstruction\nits meaning or expanded the list of unenumerated rights it might imply.\nAmendments, this\nThe amendment that would provide the basis for sexual rights was\namendment to the U.S.\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, one of the three amendments ratified in\nConstitution addresses\nthe post\u2013Civil War period, which states in part,\ncitizenship rights and\nequal protection of the\nNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the laws and is one of the\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor most litigated parts of the\nshall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, Constitution. 168 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nwithout due process of law; nor deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.10\nOne interesting point to consider is that this amendment was ratified in\nresponse to the scourge of slavery\u2019s system of racism. Under the Four-\nteenth Amendment, states could no longer deny some of its residents,\nparticularly formerly enslaved people, their rights protected by the federal\nconstitution. The least influential clause, the privileges and immunities\nclause, was significantly limited in scope by the Supreme Court in the\nSlaughter-House Cases (1873).11 However, the equal protection and due\nprocess clauses have played significant roles in the development of sex-\nual rights.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause does not specify\nwhat liberties it is meant to protect. The Court answered this question\nin Palko v. Connecticut (1937).12 Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice\nBenjamin Cardozo found that this clause protected only those liberties\nthat were \u201cof the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty.\u201d13 As a\nresult of this decision, the liberties protected by the Bill of Rights were\ngradually applied to the states as well.\nThe Griswold case, in which the Supreme Court was asked to rule\non whether a married couple had a right to birth control, took the Palko\ndecision further and looked at whether such a right emanated from those\nenumerated within the Bill of Rights. In his Griswold majority opinion,\nJustice William Douglas wrote that \u201cspecific guarantees in the Bill of\nRights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees\nthat help give them life and substance.\u201d He noted that a number of these\nguarantees create \u201czones of privacy\u201d that suggest the framers certainly\nunderstood the existence of a fundamental right to privacy. Once this\nfundamental right was recognized, Douglas aptly applied it to intimate\ndecisions between married couples.14 As is well known, this fundamental\nright to privacy became the basis for Justice Harry Blackmun\u2019s (figure 5.2)\nmajority opinion in Roe v. Wade (1973), which found that Texas did not\nhave enough of an interest in interfering with a woman\u2019s fundamental\nright to privacy in choosing whether to have an abortion during the first\ntrimester.15 The trimester-based right to privacy was altered by the court\u2019s\nsubsequent decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), so that\nthe question of the state\u2019s interest in preventing women from exercising\ntheir fundamental right to privacy came to be measured against fetal\nviability: the more viable, the more the state had an interest in protect-\ning the fetus.16 Some have suggested that the Casey decision limited the\nfundamental quality of women\u2019s right to privacy and is indicative of the\nCourt\u2019s willingness to limit the liberties protected under this Fourteenth LGBTQ+ Legal History 169\nFigure 5.2.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the\nreproductive rights cases created the legal doctrine of the fundamental\nright to privacy that would eventually become useful in expanding the\nsexual rights extended to lesbian, gays, and bisexuals.\nThe Supreme Court first considered whether the right to privacy\napplied to same-sex sexuality in Bowers v. Hardwick.17 In this decision,\nmade in 1986 as the AIDS epidemic was ravaging members of LGBTQ+\ncommunities, the Supreme Court demonstrated that it was unwilling to\nextend the fundamental right to privacy protections to gay men. The\nBowers case arose from a challenge to Georgia\u2019s laws criminalizing sod-\nomy. A remarkable fact in Bowers was that the acts in question occurred\nin the privacy of Michael Hardwick\u2019s bedroom. An Atlanta police officer\nwent to serve what turned out to be an invalid arrest warrant on Hard-\nwick for his failure to appear in court on a citation for alleged public\ndrinking. Hardwick\u2019s roommate allowed the officer to enter, whereupon he\nopened the bedroom door to find Hardwick and another man having sex.\nThe officer arrested both men, charging them with homosexual sodomy,\na felony under Georgia law.18 From a legal advocacy perspective, this 170 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nmade the fact pattern in Bowers ideal to challenge Georgia\u2019s sodomy law\nunder the fundamental right to privacy. However, writing for the Court,\nJustice Byron White did not find constitutional protection for homosexual\nsodomy. White noted the court\u2019s previous review of fundamental rights\nsurrounding heterosexual reproductive rights and found that homosexual\nsodomy was not \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d such that\n\u201cneither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\u201d He also\ndismissed the idea that the right to engage in homosexual sodomy was\nnot so \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d19 This idea,\nthat somehow homosexuality was not a part of U.S. history, inspired\nhistorians to produce a range of scholarship that would become instru-\nmental in the court\u2019s decision to overturn Bowers.\nIt took the Court seventeen years to overturn its Bowers decision,\nduring which several states continued to criminalize same-sex sexuality. It\nis notable, however, that in terms of the history of overturned precedents\nthis period was brief. For instance, the court\u2019s seminal Brown v. Board\nof Education decision, ending race-based segregation in education, was\nissued nearly sixty years after the separate-but-equal doctrine was set\nforth in Plessy v. Ferguson, allowing states to impose legally sanctioned\nracial segregation.20 The Bowers decision, however, held sway in the midst\nof the AIDS crisis and fostered an environment in which untold numbers\nof gay men would forgo early medical intervention in addressing the virus\nfor fear of facing criminal charges.21\nBy 2003 the cultural landscape had shifted enough for the court to\nreconsider the question of the fundamental right to privacy protections\nafforded to homosexual sex in the case of Lawrence v. Texas (2003).22\nWriting for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy (figure 5.3) noted that\nthe facts in Lawrence were similar to Bowers in that Lawrence and Garner\nwere arrested for committing sodomy in the privacy of John Lawrence\u2019s\nhome when a police officer entered in response to a call about a weapons\ndisturbance.23 The law in Texas criminalized homosexual but not hetero-\nsexual sodomy. While advocates offered equal protection arguments in\naddition to the Fourteenth\u2019s due process protection of the fundamental\nright to privacy, Justice Kennedy wrote that the case \u201cshould be resolved\nby determining whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in\nthe private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d24 Kennedy\nwrote that the sodomy laws sought to control behavior that was within\nthe liberty of persons to choose without being punished as\ncriminals. . . . It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults\nmay choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of LGBTQ+ Legal History 171\nFigure 5.3. Anthony Kennedy.\n(Public domain.)\ntheir homes and their own private lives and still retain their\ndignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression\nin intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be\nbut one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The\nliberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons\nthe right to make this choice.25\nKennedy\u2019s opinion specifically challenged the historical framework\npreviously set forth in Bowers and, in so doing, established the rooted-\nness of homosexual intimacy as a liberty protected by the fundamental\nright to privacy. It is noteworthy that Kennedy did not embrace the equal\nprotection clause in his decision, noting that \u201cwere we to hold the statute\ninvalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a\nprohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the con-\nduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.\u201d26 Kennedy\ndid acknowledge that decriminalizing homosexual sodomy would lead to\ndestigmatizing homosexuality itself, removing an unequal burden previ-\nously placed on homosexuals for their sexual intimacies.\nOne cannot overstate the impact of the Lawrence decision on the\nlives of LGB people whose intimate practices finally had protection as\na fundamental liberty. That being said, some question the dependency 172 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nVisit\nOyez (pronounced \u201cOh-yay\u201d) is a multimedia archive devoted to making\nSupreme Court decisions available to all.

This was due, in part, to the increase in anti-LGBTQ+\nsentiment that resulted from the notion that the Lawrence decision had\ngone too far in normalizing homosexuality. Justice Antonin Scalia iter-\nated this concern when he noted that after the court\u2019s ruling, limiting\nmarriage to heterosexuals was on \u201cpretty shaky grounds.\u201d29 The focus\non marriage equality was also due to LGB couples being denied basic\nprotections during the AIDS epidemic, ranging from partners being denied\ninput into medical decision-making to the eviction of surviving partners\nfrom their apartments.30\nAs advocates conducted a state-by-state effort to gain marriage\nequality, Hawaii became the first state in which its court ruled on the\nissue. In the 1996 case of Baehr v. Miike (originally known as Baehr\nv. Lewin when it was brought to court in 1993), the Hawaii Supreme LGBTQ+ Legal History 173\nCourt ruled that same-sex marriage was legal given the state constitu-\nDefense of Marriage Act\ntion\u2019s equal rights amendment.31 However, the impact of this decision was\nof 1996\ncurtailed by the state legislature in 1998 when, after a statewide referen-\nA U.S. federal law passed\ndum, it amended the state constitution to define marriage to be legal only by the 104th Congress\nfor opposite-sex couples. This constitutional change reflected the federal and signed into law by\nDefense of Marriage Act of 1996 (DOMA), which defined marriage as President Bill Clinton,\na \u201clegal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, defining marriage for\nand the word \u2018spouse\u2019 refers only to a person of the opposite sex who federal purposes as the\nis a husband or a wife.\u201d32 During the ensuing period, several states took union of one man and\none woman.

Windsor\naway from more important efforts, including the kind of legal reform that (2013) and Obergefell v.\nwould overturn laws targeting LGBTQ+ people.35 Despite these objections, Hodges (2015).\nthe main LGBTQ+ advocacy groups focused the bulk of their efforts on\nachieving marriage equality for same-sex couples.\nFigure 5.4. Marriage equality\nrally in front of the U.S.\nSupreme Court. (CC-BY-SA\nElvert Barnes.) 174 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nThe widespread disagreement between state laws and DOMA finally\nled the Supreme Court to address same-sex marriage in Windsor in 2013.\nThat case involved the surviving partner of a same-sex marriage, Edith\nWindsor, who sought a refund from the Internal Revenue Service for\ntaxes she was forced to pay on the estate of her spouse, Thea Spyer. Nor-\nmally, spouses were exempt from paying taxes on their partner\u2019s estate,\nbut the IRS determined that irrespective of whether Windsor\u2019s marriage\nwas legal under New York state law, DOMA meant that it was not legal\nunder federal law. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy concluded\nthat DOMA\u2019s \u201cprincipal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned\nmarriages and make them unequal.\u201d He therefore declared DOMA as a\nviolation of equal protection.36\nWindsor was a significant victory for same-sex marriage proponents\nbecause it declared DOMA unconstitutional. However, the question of\nwhether states were allowed to prohibit same-sex marriages within their\njurisdictions would not be resolved until 2015, two years after the Wind-\nsor decision, in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges (figure 5.5). Again writing\nfor the majority, Justice Kennedy found that there was no justification for\nmaking a distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex marriages: \u201cThe\nlimitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed\nnatural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the\nfundamental right to marry is now manifest.\u201d37 Kennedy looked at the\nfundamental nature of marriage itself and determined that four guiding\nFigure 5.5. James Obergefell\n(center) and attorney Al\nGerhardstein (left) react to\nSupreme Court\u2019s Obergefell\nv. Hodges ruling. (CC-BY-SA\nElvert Barnes.) LGBTQ+ Legal History 175\nprinciples warranted constitutional protection for same-sex couples. First,\nhe noted that the Court consistently found that the personal decision to\nmarry was inherent to the idea of individual liberty. Second, Kennedy\nacknowledged that the Court had previously determined marriage to be a\nunion unlike any other and that went to the heart of individual liberty.\nThird, he found that \u201cby giving recognition and legal structure to their\nparents\u2019 relationship, marriage allows children \u2018to understand the integrity\nand closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in\ntheir community and in their daily lives.\u2019 \u201d Fourth, Kennedy stated that\n\u201cthis Court\u2019s cases and the Nation\u2019s traditions make clear that marriage\nis a keystone of our social order.\u201d38\nThrough this analysis Kennedy found that the fundamental right for\nsame-sex couples to marry was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\ndue process clause. He went further to note that there was a synergy\nbetween this clause and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection\nclause. He wrote, \u201cThe Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection\nClause are connected in a profound way, though they set forth indepen-\ndent principles. . . . In any particular case one Clause may be thought to\ncapture the essence of the right in a more accurate and comprehensive\nway, even as the two Clauses may converge in the identification and\ndefinition of the right.\u201d39 The legal scholar Lawrence Tribe has argued\nthat, by linking equal protection to due process, Kennedy gives centrality\nand meaning to the legal doctrine of \u201cequal dignity.\u201d40 Tribe suggests that\nExplore\nLambda Legal is the oldest and largest national legal organization devoted\nto fighting for the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgen-\nder people, and people living with HIV.

However, Kennedy\u2019s focus\non the tradition and sanctity of marriage in our social order enveloped\nthe issue of LGBTQ+ rights under the cover of conservative notions of\nfamily values.41 Certainly, intimacy plays a significant role in the way\nmany LGBTQ+ people live their lives, but as others have suggested, this\nalone is not the sole basis for what it means to be queer.\nLGBTQ+ AND EQUALITY\nBefore its Obergefell decision, the Supreme Court confronted the question\nof whether the equal protection clause protected against discrimination\ntoward LGBTQ+ people. In 1996 the Court heard the case of Romer v.\nEvans, in which it was faced with the decision of whether Colorado\u2019s\nAmendment 2 violated the equal protection clause. Amendment 2 was\nadopted in response to several municipal laws that banned discrimination\nin housing, employment, education, and public accommodation against\nLGBTQ+ people. The amendment prohibited any law designed to protect\nthe status of people on the basis of their \u201chomosexual, lesbian or bisexual\norientation, conduct, practices or relationships.\u201d42 The state essentially\nargued that Amendment 2 did nothing more than put LGBTQ+ people on\nthe same footing as all other Colorado residents who weren\u2019t afforded the\nspecific protections of the various laws within the state. However, in a\ndecision authored by Justice Kennedy, the Court found that Amendment\n2 violated the equal protection clause and was unconstitutional. Kennedy\nexplained,\nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise that no person shall be\ndenied the equal protection of the laws must co exist [sic]\nwith the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for\none purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various\ngroups or persons. . . . We have attempted to reconcile the prin-\nciple with the reality by stating that, if a law neither burdens\na fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold\nthe legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation\nto some legitimate end. . . . Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies,\neven this conventional inquiry.43\nKennedy found that Amendment 2\u2019s exclusion of LGBTQ+ people from\nreceiving legal protections already afforded to others failed to have a\nrational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, and as a result, LGBTQ+ Legal History 177\nit violated the minimal standard of review for equal protection cases.44\nThis outcome was significant, especially coming after the Bowers decision,\nbut it did not offer the kind of more rigid review given to laws that dis-\ncriminate on the basis of race or gender. Some suggest that Kennedy\u2019s\nuse of the rational basis test meant that laws targeting LGBTQ+ people\nfor unequal treatment might survive because legislation that could be\nrationalized would not violate the equal protection clause.45 For instance,\nin the case of Boy Scouts of America v. Dale (2000) the court found\nthat the Boy Scouts of America could revoke the adult membership of\nJames Dale, who was a former Eagle Scout and assistant scoutmaster\nat the time of his ouster. The Boy Scouts claimed that their freedom of\nexpressive association rights would be violated if forced to include Dale,\nwho was a known homosexual and gay rights activist. Writing for the\nmajority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist found,\nWe are not, as we must not be, guided by our views of whether\nthe Boy Scouts\u2019 teachings with respect to homosexual conduct\nare right or wrong; public or judicial disapproval of a tenet of\nan organization\u2019s expression does not justify the State\u2019s effort\nto compel the organization to accept members where such\nacceptance would derogate from the organization\u2019s expressive\nmessage.46\nRehnquist\u2019s opinion read much more into the \u201cexpressive\u201d association\nthan was evidenced by the Boy Scouts\u2019 mission, oath, and handbook.\nIndeed, none of the written records Rehnquist relied on explicitly men-\ntioned how the values the organization purportedly espoused were directly\nchallenged by the inclusion of Dale. This case has not been overturned,\nalthough the Boy Scouts themselves have, in recent years, opened their\ndoors to gay men and lesbians.\nIf a heightened review of LGBTQ+ equal protection had been imple-\nmented in the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights\nCommission (2018), that might have influenced its outcome. In that case\nthe Court was faced with the question of whether a Colorado baker\u2019s reli-\ngious freedom protected his right to not make a wedding cake for a same-\nsex wedding (figure 5.6). The couple in this case brought a complaint to\nColorado\u2019s Civil Rights Commission, which found in their favor, citing the\nstate\u2019s antidiscrimination law. Justice Kennedy wrote for the court, \u201cWhile\nit is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring\nproducts and services on the same terms and conditions as are offered to\nother members of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that\nis neutral toward religion.\u201d47 However, this case was narrowly decided 178 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nin that the Court\u2019s ruling was not so much about religious freedom as\nit was about the obvious hostility toward the baker\u2019s religious beliefs as\nexpressed by the state\u2019s civil rights commission. In this way the Court\nleft open the door of whether religious freedom protections outweigh the\nright for LGBTQ+ people to live free from discrimination. As the NAACP\nLegal Defense and Educational Fund amicus brief argued, allowing reli-\ngious beliefs to serve as a basis for discrimination puts in jeopardy groups\nlike African Americans who historically endured discrimination because\nof the religious beliefs held by some that whites were naturally superior\nto nonwhites.48 Applying heightened scrutiny to laws and acts that dis-\ncriminate against LGBTQ+ people might tip the balance of such cases in\nfavor of equal protection over religious freedom in the future.\nThe previous cases look at issues related to the Constitution\u2019s protec-\ntion against sexuality discrimination. The Court decided in 2020 that legal\nprotections extend to those who are gender nonconforming. In Bostock\nv. Clayton County, Georgia, the Court held that gay and gender-noncon-\nforming people are protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which\nbars employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of\nsex, race, national origin, and religion.49\nIndeed, the United States has a long history of discriminating against\ngender-nonconforming people. Several cities, including San Francisco\nand New York, had laws that criminalized those who wore clothing not\ndeemed appropriate to their sex.50 Today, discrimination against gender-\nnonconforming people is fairly common. New York allows individuals\nto change their gender on their driver\u2019s licenses and other official doc-\numents, but few other states do. As is often discussed, the grouping\nFigure 5.6. Masterpiece\nCakeshop, Lakewood,\nColorado, is one of the\nparties in the Masterpiece\nCakeshop v. Colorado Civil\nRights Commission Supreme\nCourt case. (CC-BY Jeffrey\nBeall, Wikimedia Commons,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.\norg/wiki/File:Masterpiece_\nCakeshop_(Lakewood,_\nColorado).JPG.) LGBTQ+ Legal History 179\nof gender-nonconforming people under the LGBTQ+ umbrella has often\nmeant specific gender-based issues are overshadowed by those that are\nsexuality based. Nevertheless, in the case of Price Waterhouse v. Hop-\nkins (1989), the Court determined that sex stereotyping was a form of\nprohibited sex discrimination, which might open the door for greater\nprotections for those who are gender nonconforming. In that case, Ann\nHopkins was denied partnership in an accounting firm because several of\nthe review partners found that she was not feminine enough. The Court\nfound that this was a form of sex stereotyping, which it defined as \u201ca\nperson\u2019s nonconformity to social or other expectations of that person\u2019s\ngender.\u201d51 In its conclusion the Court found that the sex-based actions\nwould be permissible if the employer could prove that Hopkins would\nnot have been promoted in any event, but it was unable to do so in the\nsubsequent court hearings. Though this precedent provides some hope\nto those advocating on behalf of LGBTQ+ people, it remains to be seen\nwhether the court will go so far as to afford protections against workplace\ndiscrimination in a way that expands the current scope of its previous\ndecisions and current federal laws.\nPROFILE: ANTI-LGBTQ+ HATE CRIMES IN THE\nUNITED STATES: HISTORIES AND DEBATES\nAriella Rotramel\nOn June 12, 2016, forty-nine people were killed and fifty-three wounded\nin the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. It was the deadliest\nsingle-person mass shooting and the largest documented anti-LGBTQ+\nattack in U.S. history. Attacking a gay nightclub on Latin night resulted\nin over 90 percent of the victims being Latinx and the majority being\nLGBTQ+ identified. This act focused on an iconic public space that pro-\nvided LGBTQ+ adults an opportunity to explore and claim their sexual\nand gender identities. The violence at Pulse echoed the 1973 UpStairs\nLounge arson attack in New Orleans that killed thirty-two people. These\nmass killings are part of a broader picture of violence that LGBTQ+ peo-\nple experience, from the disproportionate killings of transgender women\nof color to domestic violence and bullying in schools. There are dif-\nferent perspectives within the LGBTQ+ community about responses to\nhate- motivated violence. These debates concern whether the use of puni-\ntive measures through the criminal legal system supports or harms the\nLGBTQ+ community and whether more radical approaches are needed to\naddress the root causes of anti-LGBTQ+ violence. This profile explores\nhate crimes as both a legal category and a broader social phenomenon. 180 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nWHAT ARE HATE CRIMES?\nAnti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes have had a simultaneously spectacular and\ninvisible role in U.S. society. Today, hate crimes are defined as criminal\nacts motivated by bias toward victims\u2019 real or perceived identity groups.52\nHate crimes are informal social control mechanisms used in stratified\nsocieties as part of what Barbara Perry calls a \u201ccontemporary arsenal of\noppression\u201d for policing identity boundaries.53 Hate crimes occur within\nsocial dynamics of oppression, in which othered groups are vulnerable to\nsystemic violence, pushing marginalized groups further into the political\nand social edges of society. It is theorized that hate crimes are driven by\nconflicts over cultural, political, and economic resources; bias and hostil-\nity toward relatively powerless groups; and the failure of authorities to\naddress hate in society.54\nSince the colonial period, violence against members of the LGBTQ+\nCompton\u2019s Cafeteria riot community has been documented in the Western Hemisphere. Colonists\nThe Compton\u2019s Cafeteria drew on an interpretation of Judeo-Christian theology that viewed nonpro-\nriot occurred in August creative sex and gender nonconformity as sinful.

The hate-crime framework has focused largely\non the acts of private individuals rather than addressing larger institu-\ntionalized forms of hate-motivated violence such as forced conversion\ntherapy or abuse within the criminal and military systems. One estimate\nattributes almost one-quarter of hate crimes to police officers.64 Anti-\nLGBTQ+ violence committed by police officers undermines LGBTQ+ vic-\ntims\u2019 willingness to report crimes, particularly after experiencing police\nviolence firsthand or having communal knowledge that police officers may 182 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nnot view LGBTQ+ victims as deserving of appropriate services.

For example, New\nYork\u2019s Anti-Violence Project (AVP) was founded in 1980 to respond to\nAnti-Violence Project\nviolent attacks against gay men in the Chelsea neighborhood. A major\n(AVP)\nconcern for these groups was the lack of documentation of such crimes;\nA national organization\nwithout evidence that these incidents were part of a broader picture of\ndedicated to reducing\nviolence and its impacts on violence, it was difficult to push efforts to address hate crimes. As a\nLGBTQ+ individuals in the\nUnited States. LGBTQ+ Legal History 183\nlead member of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, AVP\nhas coordinated many hate-violence reports since the late 1990s.69 Such\ngroups also have pushed for governmental efforts to collect data and\ncriminalize hate crimes.\nIn 1985, U.S. Representative John Conyers proposed the Hate Crime\nStatistics Act to ensure the federal collection and publishing annually of\nstatistics on crimes motivated by racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice.70 It\ntook five years for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act to become law, in 1990,\nand it did so only after sexual orientation was explicitly excluded from\nthe legislation. The text of the law emphasizes that nothing in the act\n(1) \u201ccreates a cause of action or a right to bring an action, including an\naction based on discrimination due to sexual orientation\u201d and (2) \u201cshall\nbe construed, nor shall any funds appropriated to carry out the purpose\nof the Act be used, to promote or encourage homosexuality.\u201d71\nCongress took great pains to emphasize that the legislation did not\nprevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people nor did it support that\ncommunity. The law reinforces that Congress was not treating sexual\norientation as it did other social identities that were already protected\nunder civil rights laws. The law resulted in the Federal Bureau of Inves-\ntigation collecting data from local and state authorities about hate crimes,\nbut there are major challenges to collecting accurate data. Police are not\nconsistently trained at the local and state levels to address anti-LGBTQ+\nhate crimes, and there continues to be stigma and risk associated with\nidentifying as LGBTQ+ to such authorities. Reporting practices thus vary\ndramatically across contexts, but the law has assisted antiviolence groups\nin gaining official data to document violence.\nThe 1998 beating and torture death of college student Matthew\nShepard in Laramie, Wyoming, became a rallying point to address hate\ncrimes more fully in the late 1990s. His murder received substantial\nmedia coverage and inspired political action as well as artistic works.\nAs an affluent, white, gay young man, Shepard became a symbol of\nantigay violence. His attackers were accused of attacking him because of\nantigay bias but were not charged with committing a hate crime because\nWyoming had no laws that covered anti-LGBTQ+ crimes. The attention to\nhis death contrasted with the lesser attention given to Brandon Teena\u2019s\nsexual assault and murder, which was immortalized in the film Boys\nDon\u2019t Cry (1999), and to the untold number of murders of trans women,\nparticularly women of color.72\nAlthough the particularities of the case have been debated, Shep-\nard\u2019s murder became iconic and served as a means of challenging U.S.\nlawmakers and society at large to address hate-motivated violence. The\nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act was 184 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\npassed by the U.S. House of Representatives on October 8, 2009, and\nthe U.S. Senate on October 22, 2009.73 James Byrd Jr., a Black man, was\nattacked, chained to a truck, and dragged to his death for over two miles\nin Jasper, Texas. Both crimes received national attention, and there was\npublic outrage that neither Texas nor Wyoming could enhance the pun-\nishment for these bias-motivated murders.74 The act expanded protections\nto victims of bias crimes that were \u201cmotivated by the actual or perceived\ngender, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity of any person,\u201d\nbecoming the first federal criminal prosecution statute addressing sexual\norientation and gender-identity-based hate crimes.75 It also increased the\npunishment for hate-crime perpetrators and allows the Department of\nJustice to assist in investigations and prosecutions of these crimes. On\nOctober 28, 2009, in advance of signing the act into law, President Barack\nObama stated, \u201cWe must stand against crimes that are meant not only to\nbreak bones, but to break spirits, not only to inflict harm, but to inflict\nfear.\u201d His words emphasized the broader social context of hate crimes,\nexperienced as attacks on marginalized communities.76\nFederal laws address constitutional rights violations, but states\nhave\u2014or don\u2019t have\u2014their own specific hate-crime laws.77 Today, there\nare a wide range of laws regarding hate-crime protections across states,\nand they vary regarding protected groups, criminal or civil approaches,\ncrimes covered, complete or limited data collection, and law enforcement\ntraining.78 As of 2019, nineteen states did not have any LGBT hate-crime\nlaws, and twelve states had laws that covered sexual orientation but\ndid not address gender identity and expression. Twenty states included\nboth sexual orientation and gender identity in their hate-crime laws.79\nThe majority of these laws were created in the first years of the 2000s,\ngender identity and expression were included in following years.\nDEBATING HATE-CRIME LAWS\nThe arguments supporting hate-crime laws note that offenders\u2019 acts pro-\nmote the unequal treatment of not only individuals but also the broader\ncommunities that victims belong to, cause long-term psychological con-\nsequences for victims, and violate victims\u2019 ability to freely express them-\nselves.80 The creation of laws serves to \u201cform a consensus about the rights\nof stigmatized groups to be protected from hateful speech and physical\nviolence.\u201d81 This approach, however, centers on the perpetrator perspec-\ntive and avoids a structural approach to oppression that acknowledges\nthe numerous forms of bias and the overarching perpetuation of bias in\nsociety. Many scholars have criticized the term hate crime for its erasure\nof the broader structures that support hate violence and instead placing\nthe blame for such acts solely on individuals assumed to be pathological LGBTQ+ Legal History 185\nand acting out of emotion.82 Moreover, hate-crime laws primarily function\nat the symbolic level; crimes are reported at low rates, and statutes are not\napplied to such crimes by authorities.83 Such laws focus not on prevention\nof crimes but rather on punitive measures to punish particular crimes.\nWith the existing high incarceration rates of LGBTQ+ people as well\nas people of color, hate-crime laws support rather than challenge mass\nincarceration.84 Some activists argue for efforts to \u201cbuild community rela-\ntionships and infrastructure to support the healing and transformation of\npeople who have been impacted by interpersonal and intergenerational\nviolence; [and efforts to] join with movements addressing root causes of\nqueer and trans premature death, including police violence, imprisonment,\npoverty, immigration policies, and lack of healthcare and housing.\u201d85\nNo universal consensus about the role of hate-crime laws in further-\ning the acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in American society\ncurrently exists (figure 5.8). For many people such laws carry with them\nan emphasis on the value of their lives and help further their sense of\nbelonging. Others, particularly LGBTQ+ activists engaged in broader social\njustice struggles, argue that such laws shore up a broken criminal justice\nsystem that is predicated on a violent logic that cannot truly benefit the\nLGBTQ+ community.\nFigure 5.8.

Why and how were married women,\nenslaved Africans, and sexual minorities deprived of rights\nthat others enjoyed? How did LGBTQ+ people struggle to gain\nthose rights?\n\u2022 What is an example of a legal victory in the struggle for\nLGBTQ+ equality that was later challenged? What historical\nand cultural events led to overcoming that challenge?\n\u2022 What was the basis for the expectation that the U.S. Con-\nstitution protected a right to sexual liberty, particularly with\nrespect to same-sex sexualities? What role did the Ninth\nAmendment play in that process and in the idea of a fun-\ndamental right to privacy?\n\u2022 How was the Supreme Court decision in Bowers v.

What was the\nresponse of LGBTQ+ activists and academics to the decision?\nWhat Supreme Court decision overturned Bowers?\n\u2022 How does legal history contribute to our understanding of\nthe struggle for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States?

It may be felt or expressed. It may be directed toward a\nor behaviors toward\ngroup or an individual of that group.\u201d2 Put simply, prejudice is felt when\nan individual, based\nsomeone holds a negative view of a person without having any reason\non the person\u2019s group\nmembership and not or experience that justifies that negative view. Discrimination occurs\nbased on prior knowledge when someone acts on prejudice by harming or disadvantaging a person\nor experience with that or group or when someone favors their own group at the expense of the\nindividual. other group.3 Prejudice toward LGBTQ+ people has been found to result\nin discrimination, including anti-LGBTQ+ violence, bullying and harass-\ndiscrimination\nment in schools, employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, and\nThe unjust or prejudicial\nlimited access to health care and other social goods.\ntreatment of an individual\nor group based on their\nactual or perceived\nVIOLENCE AGAINST LGBTQ+ PEOPLE\nmembership in a\nparticular group or class\nIn 1998, Gwendolyn Ann Smith (figure 6.1) established November 20 as\nof people (e.g., race,\ngender identity, or sexual Trans Day of Remembrance as a time to speak the names of all the trans-\norientation). gender individuals who were killed in antitrans violence over the previ-\nous year. In 2016, according to the National Coalition of Anti-V iolence\nPrograms, 1,036 incidents of LGBTQ+ hate violence were reported by Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 201\nFigure 6.1. Gwendolyn\nAnn Smith. (CC-BY-SA\nLevesc12.)\nsurvivors. Of those targeted by this violence, 47 percent identified as\ngay, 17 percent as lesbian, 14 percent as heterosexual, 8 percent as\nqueer, and 8 percent as bisexual. Over half those targeted in these inci-\ndents identified as transgender, and 61 percent identified as a person of\ncolor. That same year, 77 hate-violence-related homicides against LGBTQ+\nand HIV-affected people were reported. Of these homicides, 49 occurred\nduring the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. Even without\nconsidering the Pulse shootings, 2016 saw a 17 percent increase in anti-\nLGBTQ+ homicides from 2015. Of these homicides, 79 percent of the\nvictims were people of color, and 68 percent were transgender or gender\nnonconforming.4\nThis violence isn\u2019t isolated to a particular part of the county.

In addition, it leads to feeling less connected to\nschool and having lower achievement goals, and it correlates with higher\nlevels of depression, more suicidal thoughts and attempts, increased sub-\nstance use, and more sexual risk-taking.7\nSome states have passed laws to protect LGBTQ+ students from this\nharassment, bullying, and violence in their schools. One example is New\nDignity for All Students York State\u2019s Dignity for All Students Act of 2012. The goal was to pro-\nAct vide students with school environments that are free from discrimination\nA law in New York and harassment based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or\nState passed in 2010 gender identity.8 The legislation provides guidelines for students, teachers,\nthat seeks to eliminate and schools, and it institutes a zero-tolerance policy regarding bullying\ndiscrimination and in schools (see chapter 9). Unfortunately, many schools have failed to\nbullying (based on race,\nimplement key components of the act, lack staff with adequate knowledge\nphysical size, national\nabout its requirements, or have failed to adequately track and report\norigin, ethnicity, religion,\nincidents of harassment and bullying that fall within the guidelines.9\nability, sexual orientation,\nAnother resource for LGBTQ+ youth is the It Gets Better Project,\ngender identity, and\nfounded in 2010 by Dan Savage (figure 6.2) and his partner, Terry Miller.\nsex) in schools through\neducation, modification of\ndistrict codes of conduct,\nand the mandated\ncollection and reporting of\nincident data.\nFigure 6.2. Dan Savage.\n(CC-BY Weebot.) Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 203\nThis nonprofit organization attempts to \u201cuplift, empower, and connect les-\nbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer . . . youth around the globe\u201d\nby educating about the negative effects of bullying and harassment and\nworking to build self-esteem for LGBTQ+ youth.10\nEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION\nAnti-LGBTQ+ prejudice can also lead to employment discrimination. Accord-\ning to the \u201cDiscrimination in America\u201d survey of LGBTQ+ Americans, 20\npercent of respondents reported experiencing employment discrimination\nwhen applying for a job and in terms of compensation and promotions.11\nThese results are even worse for LGBTQ+ people of color. Starting in the\n1980s and continuing into the twenty-first century, some states passed\nemployment nondiscrimination laws that offered some protections for\nLGBTQ+ people, although many of these laws applied only to sexual ori-\nentation, leaving out protections for gender expression and identity.\nLegislative efforts at the federal level to provide protections against\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and\nexpression were largely unsuccessful. The Employment Non-discrimina-\ntion Act, a bill that would protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-\nder people from employment discrimination, was introduced in Congress\nevery year from 1994 to 2013. The bill came close to passing on at least\none occasion, but the inclusion of transgender rights created divisions\namong both supporters and opponents. Moreover, as support for the bill\nincreased, so too did the claims that these protections would violate the\nreligious freedom of those who see homosexuality as a sin, resulting in\nthe addition of religious-exemption language in versions of the bill. These\nexemptions concern many longtime advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, who\nargue that they effectively allow religious organizations to discriminate\nagainst LGBTQ+ individuals. Some groups, like Lambda Legal, have even\npulled their support for the legislation for this reason.\nFrom 2015 on, LGBTQ+ rights advocates moved to support the\nEquality Act, a bill with a range of broader protections than the pro-\nposed Employment Non-discrimination Act, including protections related\nto gender identity. The Equality Act would prohibit discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation and gender identity not only in employment\nbut also in housing, public accommodations, public education, federal\nfunding, credit, and jury service. However, this bill was referred to com-\nmittee and never passed.\nIn the absence of federal legislation, LGBTQ+ activists continued to\npress for justice through the courts. In June of 2020, the U.S. Supreme 204 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nCourt issued the Bostock v. Clayton County ruling, which determined\nthat discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity was a\nform of sex discrimination and was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964.12 The Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in employment based\non sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. According to the legal\nadvocacy group Lambda Legal, this ruling \u201cswept away all the contrary\nprecedent and protected all LGBT workers nationwide.\u201d13 It remains to\nbe seen whether this decision will survive scrutiny of future, possibly\nmore conservative, courts.\nACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\nPrejudice can also have a negative impact on the quality of and access\nto health care for LGBTQ+ people. This can happen in several ways. The\nfirst way relates to access to employment, because a frequent benefit of\nemployment is access to health insurance. Some states have passed laws\nthat protect LGBTQ+ people from health insurance discrimination, which\ncan result in denial of certain services or coverage altogether. According\nto the Movement Advancement Project, as of 2021 sixteen states offer\nprotections for both sexual orientation and gender identity; twenty-four\nstates prohibit transgender exclusions in health insurance coverage; six\nstates offer health insurance protections for only gender identity, and\ntwenty-eight states offer no protections for LGBTQ+ health insurance.14\nExplore\nThe Movement Advancement Project has a map of laws and policies related\nto LGBTQ+ equality (https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/healthcare_\nlaws_and_policies). Choose a state or territory, yours or another you are\nfamiliar with or interested in. Review first the state\u2019s equality profile,\nincluding the quick facts about the state\u2019s LGBTQ+ population, and then\nthe range of issues identified on the website and the corresponding laws.\n\u2022 What key issues lack supportive policies and laws or have\nnegative laws?\n\u2022 What key issues are covered by supportive policies and laws\nin this state?\n\u2022 Are any local laws relevant to these issues?\n\u2022 How does this state compare with the country as a whole or\nto other states?\n\u2022 Have you had a personal experience in relation to one of\nthese issues or laws? Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 205\nBeyond access to health care, prejudice can also affect the quality of\nhealth care a person receives. For example, in a 2017 survey conducted\nby the Center for American Progress, 8 percent of gay, lesbian, and bisex-\nual respondents reported being denied service by a doctor or health care\nprovider; 7 percent reported that doctors had refused to recognize their\nfamily, such as a child or same-sex partner; 9 percent reported that pro-\nviders had used abusive language; and 7 percent experienced unwanted\nphysical contact by a doctor or health care provider. A significantly larger\npercentage of transgender respondents reported being denied service (29\npercent), had doctors refuse to provide care related to gender transition\n(12 percent), were intentionally misgendered by a doctor (23 percent),\nexperienced abusive language (21 percent), or had unwanted physical\ncontact (29 percent).15\nEfforts to reform the views and practices of the psychological and\nmedical communities have a long history and are an ongoing project (see\nchapters 4 and 7). For example, the American Psychiatric Association\nremoved homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses documented in\nits Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973, and the American Psy-\nchological Association has taken a affirmative stance toward LGBTQ+\npeople since 1975. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatricians\npublished a statement in 2013 saying that LGB adolescents need health\ncare that is \u201cteen-friendly and welcoming to sexual minority youth.\u201d16\nNevertheless some mental and physical health practitioners still believe\nthat homosexuality is a disorder, as do some members of the general\npublic.17\npublic opinion polls\nSurveys to measure\nPUBLIC OPINION POLLS\nthe views, attitudes, or\nopinions of the general\nAccording to U.S. public opinion polls from the last few decades, attitudes\npublic on topics, issues,\ntoward gay men and lesbians have become progressively more favorable. or social problems.\nAlthough attitudes toward transgender individuals have not been surveyed\nfor the same amount of time, results from the 2017 Global Attitudes toward attitudes\nTransgender People survey suggest that a majority of Americans hold posi- The positive and negative\nemotions, beliefs, and\ntive opinions toward transgender people.

For example, in 1976, when\nGallup asked respondents how they felt about protecting \u201chomosexuals\u201d\negalitarianism\nagainst employment discrimination in general, only a small majority (56 The political philosophy\npercent) supported protections, but when they asked again in 2008, the of believing in the\npercentage supporting protections increased to 89 percent. Similarly, when equality of all and in the\nGallup asked respondents in 1979 if they thought homosexual relations elimination of inequality. 206 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nbetween consenting adults should or should not be legal, only 43 percent\nsaid they should be legal. When a similar question was asked in 2018,\n75 percent said yes, these relations should be legal, and only 23 percent\nsaid no. And when asked in 1973 if \u201cit was wrong for same-sex adults to\nhave sexual relationships,\u201d 70 percent said it was always wrong. However,\nin 2018 that number dropped to 31 percent.18\nAlthough the overall pro-LGBTQ+ direction of these public opinion\npolls since the 1970s is undeniable, they should still be viewed with\nsome caution. Public opinion is not entirely stable from year to year,\nshifting in an affirming direction for one or two years, then falling back,\nreflecting shifts in the cultural and political landscapes. In addition, the\nvariety of factors that shape public opinion can result in inconsistent\nor ambivalent viewpoints. Although egalitarianism continues to have\na favorable influence on heterosexuals\u2019 overall evaluations of LGBTQ+\npeople, many anti-LGBTQ+ values, negative stereotypes, and ego-\nego-defensive reaction\ndefensive reactions continue to exert a negative influence.

Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 207\nMEASURING ANTI-LGBTQ+ PREJUDICE\nHomophobia\nThe clinical psychologist George Weinberg is credited with coining the\nhomophobia\nterm homophobia.20 He defined homophobia as the \u201cdread of being in\nNegative or hostile\nclose quarters with homosexuals\u201d and suggested that it was a conse-\nattitudes toward people\nquence of several factors, including religion, fear of being homosexual,\nwho identify as, or are\nrepressed envy of the freedom from tradition that gay people seem to\nperceived to be, lesbian,\nhave, a threat to values, and fear of death.21 According to Weinberg, some\ngay, bisexual, transgender,\nheterosexuals seek symbolic immortality through their children. Their\nor queer. Biphobia and\nbelief that gay people don\u2019t want or can\u2019t have children, and are thereby transphobia are also used\nrejecting this route to immortality, leads to existential anxiety or fear of to describe negative or\ndeath. In his highly influential book Society and the Healthy Homosexual hostile attitudes toward\n(published in 1972), as well as in later interviews, he acknowledged the people who identify,\ninfluence of the gay liberation movement on his thinking.22 Essays that or are perceived to be,\neventually became chapters of Society and the Healthy Homosexual were bisexual or transgender.\npublished in Gay, a gay liberationist magazine edited by the gay liber-\nation pioneers Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke. Positioning himself solidly\nwithin gay liberationist philosophy, Weinberg suggested that he \u201cwould\nnever consider a patient healthy unless he had overcome his prejudice of\nhomosexuality.\u201d23 The psychoanalyst Wainwright Churchill was also influ-\nential to scholarly thinking about sexual prejudice at the time. In his book\nHomosexual Behavior among Males (1967), he describes \u201chomoerotopho-\nbia,\u201d a concept similar to homophobia, as the psychological consequence\nof living in an \u201cerotophobic\u201d society, or one that is afraid of the erotic.24\nAfter Weinberg introduced a word for homophobia, research into\nthe study of attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people expanded considerably.\nKenneth Smith conducted the first-ever study attempting to measure het-\nerosexuals\u2019 attitudes toward gay men. His work questioned the nature of\nthe homophobic individual. Smith\u2019s homophobia scale, or H scale, was\nan attempt to measure heterosexuals\u2019 \u201cnegative or fearful responding to\nhomosexuality.\u201d Smith found that homophobic people were more \u201cstatus\nconscious, authoritarian, and sexually rigid\u201d than nonhomophobic peo-\nple and concluded that homophobic people may not see homosexuals as\nbelonging to a legitimate minority group that is deserving of rights.25\nMost of the items in the H scale were ego-defensive in nature, assessing\nparticipants\u2019 levels of discomfort with being near a homosexual. Items\nlike \u201cIt would be upsetting for me to find out I was alone with a homo-\nsexual,\u201d \u201cI find the thought of homosexual acts disgusting,\u201d and \u201cIf a\nhomosexual sat next to me on a bus I would get nervous\u201d all imply an\naversive and affective response possibly due to repressed fear.26 208 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nHeterosexism and Heteronormativity\ncompulsory\nheterosexuality\nAccording to the lesbian feminist writer and theorist Adrienne Rich (fig-\nAn idea, proposed by\nthe feminist writer and ure 6.3), compulsory heterosexuality\u2014the assumption that everyone is\nscholar Adrienne Rich in heterosexual and that heterosexuality is natural for men and women\u2014is\n1980, that patriarchy and maintained and reinforced by the patriarchy.27 This social and political\nheteronormativity cause\nsystem of male dominance is reinforced by heterosexism, which Gregory\nsociety to assume and\nHerek describes as \u201can ideological system that denies and stigmatizes\nmandate heterosexuality in\nany non-heterosexual form of behavior, identity, relationship, or com-\neveryone.\nmunity.\u201d28 What results is heteronormativity, an attitude and practice\npatriarchy that centers the world around heterosexuality, privileging only that which\nA society, or belief system, conforms to the norms, practices, and institutions of heterosexuality.29\nthat favors or privileges\nQueer theory expands on the implications of heteronormativity.

Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 209\nand comportment, as well as developmental milestones such as dating,\nmarriage, career, and parenthood. All these norms and events are influ-\nenced by heterosexism and a corresponding set of heteronormative sexual\nscripts. These scripts are mental constructions, shaped by culture, that\nguide individual understanding of relationships and sexual situations.30\nAs LGBTQ+ people attempt to navigate these standards and expectations,\nthey frequently encounter challenges to their well-being. It is also import-\nant to point out that, although the challenges are intense, many are able\nto meet these challenges successfully.\nHeterosexism and heteronormativity have cast LGBTQ+ individu-\nals as morally vacuous, criminal threats, and mentally ill. Social sanc-\ntions existed in most institutions, denying LGBTQ+ people access to faith\ncommunities, education institutions, and even families. Discrimination\nin employment was the norm, resulting in the need for LGBTQ+ people\nto deny or dissemble in places of employment, when seeking housing,\nor in public. And although the U.S. Supreme Court has determined that\nLGBTQ+ people cannot be discriminated against in employment, efforts\nare underway to limit the scope of this ruling through the pursuit of\nreligious exemptions. Same-sex marriages were not recognized in the\nUnited States until 2015, and that change occurred through the courts\nand not through legislation. In addition, marriage equality continues to be\nchallenged, with legislative and judicial efforts to limit the extent to which\nsame-sex unions must be recognized as valid. The rights of LGBTQ+\npeople to become or remain parents to children has also seen progress\nbut remains under siege. For example, in 2018, Oklahoma governor Mary\nFallin signed a bill that allows private adoption agencies to discriminate\nagainst LGBTQ+ couples, allowing them to refuse to place children in\nLGBTQ+ families if it \u201cwould violate the agency\u2019s written religious or\nmoral convictions or policies.\u201d31\nMicroaggressions\nmicroaggressions\nCommon verbal,\nNot all acts of discrimination are overt and easily identified, either by\nbehavioral, or\nthe person who is targeted or by witnesses.

There are different kinds of microaggressions.\nMicroassaults occur when someone makes a joke or makes a stereotypical\ngeneralization about a person based on their group membership. Micro-\ninsults refer to rude and insensitive words and behavior that devalue\nor demean someone\u2019s group. Finally, microinvalidations take place when\nsomeone is excluded because of their group or because their experience\nas the member of a group is invalidated.33\nLGBTQ+ Minority Stress\nAlthough most people deal effectively with the stress of everyday life,\nsometimes negative life events can be so severe (what psychologists call\nmajor life stressors) or continue for so long (chronic stressors) that they\ncan negatively affect mental and physical health. Members of racial, sexual,\nand other minority groups who experience stressors as a result of prejudice\nand discrimination experience what psychologists call minority stress.34\nminority stress\nLGBTQ+ minority stress extends beyond the regular stress of every-\nSocial stress resulting\nday life or the stress that comes from unexpected life events.

Cologne,\nGermany, Pride Parade,\n2014. (CC-BY-SA Cephoto.) Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 213\nTHE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF COMING OUT\nThe gay liberation movement of the 1970s advocated for coming out as\nan LGB person as an important strategy of political change and personal\nfulfillment. This concept is illustrated in this now famous 1978 quote by\nthe late San Francisco supervisor, and hero of the LGBTQ+ rights move-\nment, Harvey Milk (figure 6.5):\nEvery gay person must come out. As difficult as it is, you must\ntell your immediate family. You must tell your relatives. You\nmust tell your friends if indeed they are your friends. You must\ntell your neighbors. You must tell the people you work with. You\nmust tell the people in the stores you shop in. Once they realize\nthat we are indeed their children, that we are indeed every-\nwhere, every myth, every lie, every innuendo will be destroyed\nonce and all. And once you do, you will feel so much better.43\nThe benefit and buffering effects of coming out have been well\nestablished in the literature. Ilan Meyer\u2019s LGBTQ+ minority stress model\nconnects minority identification with positive outcomes in terms of coping\nand having access to the social support resources necessary to address\nFigure 6.5. Harvey Milk at\nGay Pride San Jose, 1978.\n(CC-BY-SA Ted Sahl, Kat\nFitzgerald, Patrick Phonsakwa,\nLawrence McCrorey, Darryl\nPelletier.) 214 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nminority stress. The model also highlights how minority identification is\nrelated to minority stressors within the individual such as expectations of\nrejection, concealment, and internalized homophobia. In addition, identi-\nfication and community connectedness can increase visibility, which may\nincrease vulnerability to things like employment discrimination, harass-\nment, and violence.44\nHistorians and other social scientists have also suggested that the\nincreased visibility of LGBTQ+ people was a critical element in the for-\nmation of LGBTQ+ communities and the progress of the LGBTQ+ rights\nmovements. The contact hypothesis, Harvey Milk\u2019s rallying cry of \u201cCome\non out!\u201d and research that highlights the importance of role models and\npositive representatives in various forms of media all suggest that coming\nout and increasing the visibility of LGBTQ+ people is an important and\noften positive strategy for improving social attitudes. As we stated earlier\nin this chapter, increased visibility does come with risks. However, pos-\nitive contact between heterosexuals and LGBTQ+ people has been found\nto result not only in positive attitude change but also in the possibility of\nincreasing the dominant group\u2019s identification with the marginalized group,\nallyship\ncreating the possibility of allyship\u2014the mobilization of heterosexuals to\nBuilding a supportive\nwork toward change benefiting the LGBTQ+ community.

Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 215\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough progress in LGBTQ+ rights has been made and attitudes toward\nLGBTQ+ people have changed in the last few decades, the implications of\nanti-LGBTQ+ prejudice and discrimination remain serious. It is critical that\nefforts to change these attitudes continue and that LGBTQ+ affirmative\nsocial scientists, educators, and practitioners continue to develop a robust\nknowledge base to guide these efforts. In addition, a related literature\nhighlights the strength and resilience found in the LGBTQ+ community,\neven in the face of this adversity.\nLGBTQ+ historians and anthropologists like George Chauncey, John\nD\u2019Emilio, Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline Davis, and Susan\nStryker have helped make visible the courage and perseverance of LGBTQ+\nindividuals and communities who faced legal risks, social stigma, overt\ndiscrimination, and violence across the twentieth century.46 These are the\nvoices and struggles of a resilient community: the Mattachine Society\nand Daughters of Bilitis, which organized and built networks of LGBTQ+\npeople in the shadow of McCarthyism and anti-homosexual witch hunts;\nthe transwomen and transmen, drag queens, queer youth of color, street\nhustlers, butch dykes, and gay men who took a stand at the Stonewall\nInn; the LGBTQ+ people who, amid unimaginable death and sadness\nbrought about by the AIDS epidemic, built organizations, took care of\neach other, acted up, and fought back against government disdain and\nneglect; and the people with AIDS, many in the midst of the ravages\nof the disease, who still found meaning in helping others. These sto-\nries of resilience aren\u2019t meant to minimize the dangers or potential for\nharm. In the words of Harvey Milk, they are simply stories of hope:\n\u201cHope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better\nplace to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all\nwill be alright . . . and you and you and you, you have to give people\nhope.\u201d47\nPROFILE: MINORITY STRESS AND\nSAME-SEX COUPLES\nsexual minority\nDavid Frost\nindividuals\nPeople who have sexual\nSexual minority individuals continue to experience prejudice and dis-\nidentities that are not\ncrimination as a result of the social stigma that most societies place on\nstraight, including but\nsexual behavior and sexual identities outside heteronormative ideals.

In this profile, I provide an overview of\nseveral studies my colleagues and I have conducted aimed at understand-\ning how sexual minority individuals and members of same-sex relation-\nships experience stigma in the context of their intimate relationships.

This research illustrates how theories\ntwo partners who share\nof minority stress can be used to understand how social stigma can be\nthe sex assigned at birth\ndetrimental to the health and relationships of sexual minority individuals\nand gender identity.\nand same-sex couples.\nTHE MINORITY STRESS MODEL\nThe minority stress model, as proposed by Ilan Meyer, attempts to explain\nwhy sexual minority individuals, on average, experience higher rates\nof mental health problems relative to their straight peers. Noting that\nthese inequalities in mental health are not likely to be caused by sexual\norientation itself, the minority stress model contends that the reason for\npoorer mental health outcomes among sexual minority populations lies\nin sexual minority individuals having a disadvantaged status in society\nrelative to their straight peers. This disadvantaged social status is cre-\nated by the stigma that societies place on same-sex sexual behavior and\nsexual minority identities, which does not apply to straight individuals\ngiven the privileging of heterosexuality as normative.48\ndisadvantaged social\nAs a result of this disadvantaged social status, sexual minority\nstatus\nA lower place within individuals are exposed to social stress that straight individuals are not.\nthe social hierarchy of a Social stressors include being fired from your job because you are les-\nsociety, often defined by bian (i.e., prejudice), being called names because you are bisexual (i.e.,\na lower level of power, harassment), being socially avoided because you are gay (i.e., everyday\nlower social value, and discrimination), having to worry about when it is safe to disclose your\nexclusion from full and sexual orientation (i.e., stigma concealment), and thinking you are not\nequal access to material\nvalued as a person as much as others are because of your sexual orien-\nand symbolic forms of\ntation (i.e., internalized stigma).

Even in countries with equal\nmarriage laws, many same-sex couples experience stigma and discrimi-\nnation from coworkers, peers, and family. Thus, the domain of intimacy\nand romantic relationships remains a significant part of sexual minority\nindividuals\u2019 lives in which they continue to experience social stigma.\nMINORITY STRESS AS A BARRIER TO ACHIEVING\nRELATIONSHIP GOALS\nTo understand how experiences of minority stress in the relational domain\nmight explain inequalities in mental health between sexual minority\nindividuals and their straight peers, my colleagues and I conducted a\nsurvey of 431 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (55 percent) individuals and\nstraight-identified (45 percent) individuals living in the United States and\nCanada. We specifically wanted to examine the extent to which partici-\npants felt stress related to experiencing barriers to achieving their goals\nin romantic relationships (e.g., getting married, buying a house, planning\nto have children, moving in together) compared with other areas such\nas the workplace and education. Participants were asked to complete the\nPersonal Project Inventory on the goals they were pursuing across these\nlife domains and the intensity of perceived barriers to the achievement\nof these goals, which served as our measure of stress. We also asked\nparticipants to complete previously validated measures of depression and\npsychological well-being.51\nWe found that sexual minority individuals reported significantly\nmore depressive symptoms and lower levels of psychological well-being\nthan their straight peers. Sexual minorities also reported more barriers to\ngoal pursuit than straight participants. People who reported more stress in\nthe form of frustrated goal pursuit scored significantly poorer on mental\nhealth and well-being outcomes, and their inclusion in models attenu-\nated sexual orientation differences in mental health. Importantly, when\nwe held constant the differences in the stress related to frustrated goal\npursuit, differences between sexual minorities and straight individuals 218 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nin mental health and well-being were much less pronounced. Thus, our\nresearch demonstrates that this frustrated goal pursuit is the critical factor\nexplaining sexual minority differences in mental health and well-being.\nThese barriers to relationship projects came from interpersonal sources,\nlike family, friends, and neighbors.\nThese findings suggest that stigma in intimacy and relationships\nmay prevent sexual minorities from achieving their goals for intimacy\nand relationships and in doing so contributes to mental health inequal-\nities observed between sexual minority and straight individuals. These\nfindings have relevance to the changing social context regarding mar-\nriage equality. Interpersonal attitudes may affect the everyday relationship\nactivities of sexual minority individuals in ways that are detrimental to\ntheir health and well-being.\nTHE PERSISTENCE OF MINORITY STRESS IN A POST\u2013MARRIAGE\nEQUALITY CONTEXT\nTo examine whether minority stress continues to affect the mental health\nof same-sex couples in the United States after access to equal marriage\nbecame available, my colleagues and I examined the degree to which\nthe perception of unequal recognition\u2014as a minority stressor\u2014explained\nvariation in mental health above and beyond legal relationship recogni-\ntion. We predicted that members of same-sex couples with legal marital\nstatus would report more positive mental health outcomes compared with\nmembers of same-sex couples who were not legally married. We also pre-\ndicted that perceiving the social climate as not affording equal recognition\nto same-sex couples would be related to worse mental health for mem-\nbers of same-sex couples, regardless of legal marital status. Dyadic data\nfrom both members of 106 same-sex couples\u2014diverse in terms of couple\ngender, length of relationship, location in the United States, and race/\nethnicity\u2014were collected and analyzed. The survey contained measures\nof legal marital status, perceived unequal social recognition, and mental\nhealth outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, nonspecific psychological\ndistress, and problematic drinking behavior).52\nThe results demonstrated that perceived unequal relationship rec-\nognition predicted poorer mental health, whether or not members of\nsame-sex couples were in a legally recognized relationship. Focusing on\npotential differences in mental health by levels of legal relationship rec-\nognition, the study found that members of same-sex couples recognized\nas registered domestic partners or civil unions, but not as legal marriages,\ndemonstrated significantly lower levels of mental health compared with\nthose with legal marriages and those with no legal relationship status.\nThose who were legally married reported the most positive mental health Prejudice and Discrimination against LGBTQ+ People 219\noutcomes but were not statistically distinguishable from those with no\nlegal recognition for their relationship.\nThese findings illustrate a consistent and robust pattern of associa-\ntions with multiple indicators of mental health, suggesting that the degree\nto which members of same-sex couples perceive their relationship to have\nunequal recognition is a meaningful factor underlying mental health out-\ncomes. In other words, although institutionalized forms of discrimination,\nsuch as unequal access to legal marriage, have documented associations\nwith mental health in sexual minority populations, the lived experience\nof perceived inequality likely represents a more proximal form of minority\nstress. This form of minority stress is one that potentially exists as shared\nlived experience at the couple level \u201cand may even persist in contexts\nwhere structural stigma has been reduced or eliminated.\u201d53 These findings\nalso highlight how equal access to legal marriage is an important social\nchange but is not sufficient to eliminate long-standing social stigma as\na risk for mental health problems faced by sexual minority individuals\nand members of same-sex couples. The constantly shifting social and\npolicy climate facing sexual minorities and same-sex couples continues to\nwarrant attention from social scientists, public health scholars, and policy\nmakers in light of its potential impact on mental health.\nRESILIENCE AND RESISTANCE TO MINORITY STRESS IN\nSAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS\nIt is important to qualify that the research findings discussed up to this\npoint pertain to groups of sexual minority individuals and same-sex cou-\nples and reflect the average experience of the participants. Not all sex-\nual minority individuals and members of same-sex couples experience\nminority stress and not all who do are affected by it in the same way. In\nfact, many sexual minority individuals and members of same-sex couples\nlive healthy lives in rewarding relationships. Recognizing this variability\nin individual experience highlights how sexual minority individuals and\nmembers of same-sex relationships are resilient in the face of minority\nstress.\nAn example of this resilience can be seen in a study of the mean-\ning-making processes same-sex couples use in negotiating minority stress\nin their relationships.54 To explore how members of same-sex couples\npotentially exercise resilience in the face of minority stress, I asked nine-\nty-nine people in same-sex relationships to write about their relational\nhigh points, low points, decisions, and goals, as well as their experiences\nof stigma directly related to their relationships. Narrative analysis of these\nstories revealed that participants had several psychological strategies for\nmaking meaning of their experiences of stigma. Some strategies empha- 220 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nsized a negative, delimiting, and contaminating effect of stigma on rela-\ntionships, as is commonly found in existing research. However, other\nstrategies emphasized how stigma can be made sense of in ways that\nallow individuals to overcome its negative effects.\nFor example, some same-sex couples who participated in this research\nconstructed meanings of stigma-related stressors as challenges that reaf-\nfirmed their commitment to and bond with their partners. Others saw\nstigma as providing an opportunity to redefine notions of commitment\nand relational legitimacy. These narrative strategies for making meaning\nof stigma-related stressors represent more than simply coping strategies\nfor minority stress. They represent attempts to reclaim experiences of\nbeing stigmatized in ways that allow individuals to resist and even thrive\nin the face of social stigma. Thus, through individual and group-level\nmeaning-making processes of minority stressors, social stigma can, indi-\nrectly, result in positive outcomes for sexual minorities\u2019 well-being and\nsame-sex relationships.\nSUMMARY\nMy colleagues and I have conducted studies that collectively demon-\nstrate how social stigma can affect the health and relationships of sexual\nminority individuals and same-sex couples. These are by no means the\nonly studies on this topic.55 It is my hope that the details of these studies\nillustrate the potential utility of minority stress theory to highlight that\nthe continued stigmatization of same-sex couples, even in areas that\nhave progressive laws and policies, puts sexual minority individuals and\nsame-sex couples at risk for negative health and relationship outcomes.\nThis research has been useful for efforts to change laws and policies to\nbe more inclusive of same-sex couples\u2019 rights and to eliminate discrimi-\nnation against same-sex couples, efforts that are by no means complete\nand will continue for years to come. However, research on minority stress\ncan also be useful in informing the work of community health workers,\ncounselors, and clinicians working with sexual minority communities to\nhelp them cope with, overcome, and resist the potential negative impact\nof social stigma.56\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 What prejudices do LGBTQ+ people face, and how does prej-\nudice affect their lives and experiences?\n\u2022 What other structures of inequality, such as race, shape the\nexperience of violence and prejudice toward LGBTQ+ people?

Watson\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nUpon completion of this chapter, students will be able to do the following:\n\u2022 Summarize the history of nonnormative genders and sexu-\nalities, including homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgender\nidentity, as well as queer identity and activism.\n\u2022 Describe the connections between identities and embodied\nexperiences.\n\u2022 Describe intersectionality from an LGBTQ+ perspective.\n\u2022 Analyze how key social institutions shape, define, and en-\nforce structures of inequality.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe health and wellness of LGBTQ+ and other sexual minority people in\nthe United States is influenced by many factors: access to health care and\nhealth insurance; ability for open self-disclosure with a queer-affirming\nhealth professional; knowledge about the unique health challenges of\nLGBTQ+ people, including disease prevention and health promotion; and\na sense of self-efficacy about their health, or the confidence that they\nknow how to live a healthy life, along with the intention, necessary\nknowledge, and resources to do so. According to the Institute of Med-\nicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, LGBTQ+ health can be\nunderstood through four lenses:\n233 234 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 Minority stress model\u2014chronic stress that sexual and gender\nminorities routinely experience can contribute to physical and\nmental health problems.\n\u2022 Life-course perspective\u2014events at each stage of life influence\nsubsequent stages, with LGBTQ+ people being particularly\nvulnerable in adolescence and young adulthood.\n\u2022 Intersectionality perspective\u2014an individual\u2019s multiple identi-\nties and the ways they interact may compromise health so\nthat gender and sexual identity may be complicated, for ex-\nample, by racial or ethnic identity or economic status. Health\ndisparities are already amplified among racial and ethnic mi-\nnority populations, which queer sexual orientation is likely\nto intensify further.\n\u2022 Social ecology\u2014individuals are surrounded by spheres of in-\nfluence and support, including families, friends, communities,\nand society, that shape self-efficacy and health.1\nIn this chapter we keep in mind these four overlapping dimensions while\nexploring the following topics:\n\u2022 LGBTQ+ people and the history and culture of medicine.\n\u2022 Vulnerabilities of LGBTQ+ people across the lifespan and\nacross intersectional identities (including race and ethnicity).\n\u2022 Transgender people\u2019s health.\n\u2022 Guidelines for being a smart patient and health care consumer.\nHISTORY AND CULTURE OF MEDICINE AND\nLGBTQ+ PEOPLE\nLGBTQ+ people often have complicated relationships with medicine, and\nthese relationships have histories that extend back to the 1800s. The phi-\nlosopher Michel Foucault famously (and controversially) suggested that\nqueer sexualities in the ancient and medieval worlds were judged in an\nexclusively legal or religious category but that in the 1800s sexualities\nbecame medicalized.2 From this perspective, in historical terms, LGBTQ+\npeople in Western society went from being criminal or immoral to being\nmentally ill. LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 235\nViewed as a pathology rather than just a moral failing or legal vio-\nlation, queer sexuality became the object of medicine\u2019s study: What is its\ncause, and if it is a pathology or disease, how might it be cured? This\nmoment occurred in the second half of the 1800s when medical research\nand practice had absorbed enormous cultural power and authority through\nits first modern groundbreaking discoveries, including the development\nof germ theory, surgical antisepsis, and anesthesia. All things seemed\npossible to medicine.\nDEVELOPING TERMINOLOGY\nThe term homosexual appears to have been coined by the Austro- homosexual\nHungarian journalist Karl-Maria Kertbeny (1824\u20131882) (figure 7.1) in A person with a romantic\nan 1869 pamphlet criticizing a German anti-sodomy law.3 The term was attraction to, sexual\ntaken up by the psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840\u20131902) in attraction to, or sexual\nhis Psychopathia Sexualis [Mental illnesses related to sex] (1886).4 The behavior with others of\nthe same sex or gender.\nterm entered English through a translation of Krafft-Ebing\u2019s work and\nthrough the advocacy writing of John Addington Symonds and Havelock\nbisexual\nEllis in England. The term bisexual, in contrast, had been used in botany\nRomantic attraction, sexual\nsince the 1700s to denote plants with both male and female anatomy\nattraction, or sexual\n(also referred to as hermaphrodite), but was adapted in the late 1800s\nbehavior toward both\nmales and females or\ntoward more than one sex\nor gender.\nhermaphrodite\nBiologically, an organism\nthat has complete or\npartial reproductive organs\nand produces gametes\nnormally associated with\nboth male and female\nsexes.\nFigure 7.1.

Greenberg identifies five explanatory categories that emerged\nwoman.\nover time: homosexuality as innate, degeneracy theory, Darwinian theory,\ndegeneracy psychoanalytic theory, and behaviorism.5\nAlso known as Nineteenth-century advances in embryology and genetics may have\ndegeneration theory; influenced what had often been an assumption since Greco-Roman antiq-\nnineteenth-century theory uity that sexuality was innate, leading to a theory of the third sex, which\nthat homosexuality and was also encouraged by movements for social tolerance and legal reform.\nbisexuality were akin to In contrast, proponents of degeneracy theory viewed homosexuality and\ncriminality, alcoholism,\nbisexuality as akin to criminality, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Degen-\nand drug addiction.\neracy suggests that the gene pool had become exhausted as a result\nof modern life or personal vice and indulgence inherited from a previ-\nous generation. Similarly, the application of Darwinian theory evaluated\npeople and behavior, characterizing homosexual and bisexual people as\nevolutionary throwbacks, akin to \u201cprimitive\u201d peoples whom Europeans\nhad colonized throughout the world and whose sexual mores were at\nodds with Western notions of morality.\nPerhaps no theories of sexual identity have been more influential\nthan psychoanalytic theory and behaviorism. Although various psychody-\nnamic theories were espoused in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Sigmund\nFreud, often called the father of modern psychoanalysis, postulated that\ninfants are \u201cpolymorphous perverse,\u201d deriving pleasure from many parts\nof their body and regardless of gender. The function of society, for Freud,\nwas to channel pleasure into an acceptable, productive heterosexuality.\nHowever, traumas or inner conflicts could arrest a child\u2019s psychosexual\ndevelopment or cause a young adult to regress into homosexuality (for\nexample, an overly attentive mother and distant father for boys). The role\nof psychotherapy was to expose the trauma or conflict and allow growth\ntoward heterosexuality to resume. Nonetheless, Freud was less inclined\nto view homosexuality as a sickness than as a form of psychosexual\nimmaturity. Behaviorism, in contrast, has been inclined to view sexual LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 237\norientation generally as a learned behavior, which means that homo-\nsexuality can be unlearned.6 Whereas psychoanalytic theory prefers talk\ntherapy, behaviorism has tended to employ rewards and punishments to\n\u201creprogram\u201d sexual behavior, including electroshocks and hormone injec-\ntions. So-called gay conversion therapy, the subject of increasing legal\nrejection by states today, has a decades-old history.\nEMERGING SELF-CARE\nThroughout the twentieth century the medical establishment in the United\nStates generally considered queer sexualities as mental illnesses. How-\never, early descriptive research by Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues dis-\nclosed both a surprising number of self-identified LGB persons and a fluid\nspectrum of human sexual response. What they called a \u201cheterosexual-\nhomosexual rating scale\u201d identified a range from exclusively heterosexual\n(0) to equally heterosexual and homosexual (3), otherwise known as\nbisexual, to exclusively homosexual (6). This scale was applied to each\nindividual according to the participants\u2019 sexual behavior and psychic reac-\ntions\u2014that is, thoughts, feelings, and fantasies.7\nIt is no wonder, then, that by the 1960s and the emergence of the\ngay rights movement, many LGBTQ+ people had come to distrust the med-\nical establishment. Health care providers often either exhibited hostility\nor acknowledged ignorance about the unique health concerns of LGBTQ+\npeople.8 Many gay men and lesbians in particular had come to reject the\nnotion of their sexual orientation as a pathology and had begun to seek\nthe rare health care providers who were affirming of their sexualities.\nFeminists and the women\u2019s movement had shown how this might be done\nwith health collectives, like the one in Boston that produced the book Our\nBodies, Ourselves, part of a movement in the United States in the late\n1960s and early 1970s for homegrown self-published self-help books.9\nOne groundbreaking book for queer people included chapters on alcohol\nsafety, venereal diseases (now called sexually transmitted infections),\nsexually transmitted\nand other health topics, many of which had been previously published\ninfections\nin local queer newspapers and magazines.10 In major urban areas, health Pathogens that are\nclinics for LGBTQ+ people formed to serve this vulnerable population.11 commonly spread by\nWhen the first published reports of an infectious epidemic that would sexual activity, especially\ncome to be called acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) appeared vaginal intercourse, anal\nin 1981, queer communities were wary of uncertain medical explanations sex, and oral sex.\nand advice, aware of the stigmatization of their sexualities that was now\nexacerbated by AIDS, but also more prepared for community organizing\naround health concerns.

We explore these considerations next.\nVULNERABILITIES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND\nACROSS INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES\nDecades of research have indicated that LGBTQ+ populations face a dis-\nproportionate burden of health problems and stigma, including higher lev-\nels of depression, lower self-esteem, compromised academic achievement,\nand more substance use.16 These disparities are documented across the\nlifespan, from childhood to young adulthood and even into late adult-\nhood.17 Researchers have identified minority stress, or sexuality- and\ngender-related stressors, as the mechanism through which these health\nproblems can be explained.18 240 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nMinority Stress Model\nBeing a marginalized or minority person in a society produces personal\nand group stress, sometimes invisible but always with both psycholog-\nical and physiological effects.

In particular, the report highlights\nexplaining why sexual how minority stress has been found to affect the day-to-day lives and\nminority individuals, on health of LGBTQ+ individuals across the lifespan.19 This minority stress\naverage, experience higher can be distal (e.g., victimization from others because of a sexual minority\nrates of mental health identity) or proximal (e.g., concealment of sexual identity, internalized\nproblems relative to their\nhomophobia). Therefore, strategies to promote health and well-being\nstraight peers.\nshould consider multiple types of stressors.\nIntersecting Identities\nIn addition to minority stress, the Institute of Medicine recommended a\nfocus on intersectionality as an imperative consideration for researchers,\nclinicians, and other stakeholders invested in LGBTQ+ health.20 Inter-\nintersectionality\nOverlapping or sectionality at its broadest meaning proposes that race, ethnicity, ability\nintersecting social status, and other oppressed identities can amplify LGBTQ+ health issues.21\nidentities, such as race, In addition to being aware how oppressed and intersecting identities\nclass, and gender, and can compound health outcomes, researchers are increasingly measuring\nrelated systems of and considering all demographic characteristics among LGBTQ+ youth\noppression, domination, to better understand how multiple identities (e.g., being Black, gay, and\nor discrimination.\nresiding in the U.S. South) might be related to the holistic LGBTQ+ expe-\nrience. For example, a study collected data from 17,112 LGBTQ+ youth\npansexual\nacross the United States and documented twenty-six distinct sexual and\nThe sexual, romantic,\ngender identities.22 Additionally, youth who were transgender and nonbi-\nor emotional attraction\nnary were more likely than cisgender youth to identify with an \u201cemerging\ntoward people regardless\nsexual identity label,\u201d such as pansexual (figure 7.3). These patterns\nof their sex or gender\nidentity. also differed by ethnoracial identity, suggesting that youth of color are\nusing different terms, compared with their white counterparts, to describe\ntheir sexual attractions and gender identities. The next step is to better\nunderstand how intersecting identities may be uniquely associated with\nhealth outcomes, given that a large focus of research has focused on\ndisease prevention and health promotion among LGBTQ+ populations.\nThe Institute of Medicine also points out that LGBTQ+ couples and their\nchildren are less likely to have adequate health insurance, which is usu-\nally provided through employers, especially when they are unemployed\nor underemployed.23 LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 241\nFigure 7.3.\nThe pansexual\npride flag.\n(Public domain,\nkiwineko14.)\nDISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION\nRecent research on health disparities finds that the gap in disparities\nbetween some LGBTQ+ and heterosexual youth continues to grow across\na number of outcomes.24 Emerging research has moved beyond document-\ning these disparities to examining the risk and protective factors that may\nhelp prevent disease and promote health among LGBTQ+ people.\nWith respect to LGBTQ+ youth, research has consistently docu-\nmented family and parent support to be the strongest buffer against\nnegative health experiences, above and beyond other support systems.\nIn addition to families, a number of other support systems are known to\nprotect against negative health (and thus disease later in life), such as\nschool-based clubs, supportive peers, and supportive policies and laws.25\nThe protective role of these support systems extends into young adulthood\nand across a lifespan, but the magnitude by which certain supports (e.g.,\nschool peers) affect LGBTQ+ health may change.\nAmong older LGBTQ+ adults, there has been a strong focus on sexu-\nally transmitted disease and HIV prevention. Given HIV\u2019s disproportionate\nburdens on the LGBTQ+ community, and in particular the disproportion-\nate impact on African American men who have sex with men, research\nfunding and attention have focused on reducing this stark disparity (fig-\nure 7.4). Medical advancements in preventing HIV have proliferated in\nthe recent past, and one method in particular, pre-exposure prophylaxis\n(PrEP), has been the focus of many studies. However, a vexing dilemma\nexists: although there is a drug that can prevent HIV infection, why aren\u2019t\nmore men who have sex with men (and LGBTQ+ individuals) taking the\ndrug? After all, Tony Kirby and Michelle Thornber-Dunwell find that the\nrates of HIV acquisition in the United States are still high and similar to 242 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 7.4. Diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States and dependent areas, 2015. Subpopulations representing\n2 percent or less of HIV diagnoses are not reflected in this chart. MSM = men who have sex with men. (Public\ndomain, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\nthe rates in other countries. Researchers continue to consider how stigma,\na history of medical mistrust, and other factors might thwart the uptake\nof lifesaving drugs that prevent HIV among LGBTQ+ populations.26\nSee table 7.1 for a summary of the critical health concerns over the\nlife course.\nTable 7.1.

LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 243\nA long history of health professionals\u2019 insensitivity or even hostility\nto LGBTQ+ people, as described in the beginning of this chapter, continues\nto have real-life consequences. Disparities are particularly evident among\ntransgender people, who are a uniquely vulnerable population and whose\nhealth and wellness concerns we discuss next.\nTRANSGENDER AND GENDER-NONCONFORMING\nHEALTH CARE\nThe transgender and gender-nonconforming community has suffered,\noften in silence. Numerous studies have depicted the barriers these\npatients face with respect to health care, which include mistreatment by\nhealth care providers and providers\u2019 discomfort or inexperience regarding\npatient\u2019s health care needs, as well as patients\u2019 lack of adequate insurance\ncoverage for health care services.27 Owing to these barriers, transgender\nand gender-nonconforming patients are often left to navigate health care\non their own.\nFor example, the National Center for Transgender Equality reported\nthat 33 percent of respondents who had seen a health care provider in the\npreceding year suffered at least one negative experience related to being\ntransgender, and 23 percent of respondents did not even seek a medical\nprovider when they needed one for fear of being mistreated. Addition-\nally, a staggering 39 percent of respondents experienced psychological\ndistress, and 40 percent have attempted suicide in their lifetimes, which\nis nearly nine times the 4.6 percent rate of the general population.28\nSeeking routine or preventive physical and mental health care, let alone\ntransition-related services for those who seek to transition, is difficult.\nincidence\nINCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE A measure of the\nprobability of occurrence\nSeveral attempts have been made to determine how many Americans of a given medical\ncondition in a population\nidentify as transgender.29 A 2016 estimate postulates that 0.6 percent of\nwithin a specified period\nthe population, or 1.4 million Americans, are transgender.30 However, the\nof time.\ngender construct is complex, and more rigorous epidemiological studies\nare needed on a global scale to delineate the incidence (percentage of\nprevalence\nthe population) and prevalence (total number of people) of this expe-\nThe proportion of a\nrience.

There has been great controversy within the trans-\nThe distress a person\ngender and gender-nonconforming community regarding this diagnosis\ncan feel because of a\nbecause in earlier years the phenomenon was deemed psychopathological.33\nmismatch between their\nOn the one hand, gender nonconformity refers to \u201cthe extent to which\ngender identity and their\na person\u2019s gender identity, expression, or role differs from the cultural\nsex assigned at birth.\nnorms that designate for people of a particular sex.\u201d34 On the other hand,\ngender nonconformity gender dysphoria, first described by N.

Transition, LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 245\nfor those who seek it, does not follow a linear model but is, rather, an\nindividualized process based on the patient\u2019s specific needs. Interventions\nand their sequence differ from person to person. A collaborative approach\nbetween the health care professional and patient is of the utmost impor-\ntance. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach, one that encompasses\nprimary care providers, mental health clinicians, surgeons, and speech\npathologists, results in the best outcomes. The following lists therapeu-\ntic options that a transgender and gender-nonconforming patient may\nundertake:\n\u2022 Changing gender expression or role, whether living full-time\ngender expression\nor part-time in the gender expression that aligns with the\nA person\u2019s behavior,\ncurrent gender identity. This may involve chest binding to mannerisms, interests,\ncreate a flat chest contour, padding of the hips and buttocks, and appearance that are\ngenital tucking, wearing gaff underwear, or wearing a pros- associated with gender\nthesis. in a particular cultural\ncontext, specifically\n\u2022 Changing a name and gender marker on identity documents.\nwith the categories of\nfemininity or masculinity.\n\u2022 Seeking psychotherapy to understand and investigate the\nconstructs of gender, such as gender identity, gender role,\ngender attribution, and gender expression. Psychotherapy\nmay also address the positive or negative impacts of such\nfeelings as stigma and address internalized transphobia, if\npresent.\n\u2022 Undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy to either fem-\ninize or masculinize the patient\u2019s body.\n\u2022 Choosing gender-affirming surgeries to alter primary or sec-\nondary sex characteristics.\n\u2022 Finding peer-support groups and community organizations\nthat provide social support, as well as advocacy.\n\u2022 Attending speech or voice and communication therapy that\nfacilitates comfort with gender identity or expression and\nameliorates the stress associated with developing verbal and\nnonverbal behaviors or cues when interacting with others.\n\u2022 Removing hair through laser treatments, electrolysis, waxing,\nepilating, or shaving.\nThe options may seem overwhelming to review, but it is the goal of the\nhealth care professional to assist the patient through the journey, regard-\nless of what therapeutic options the patient ultimately chooses. Access to\nthose services requires that the transgender person live in an area where 246 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nthey are available and have adequate health insurance, which is usually\nprovided by employers. Transgender people, particularly trans people of\ncolor, however, are less likely to be employed than cisgender LGB people,\nthus are often deprived of the health insurance that they need.\nCRITERIA FOR GENDER-AFFIRMING\nHORMONE THERAPY\ngender-affirming Gender-affirming hormone therapy consists of the administration of\nhormone therapy exogenous endocrine agents to elicit feminizing or masculinizing changes.\nHormone therapy in While some transgender and gender-nonconforming patients may seek\nwhich sex hormones maximum changes, others may be content with a more androgynous pre-\nand other hormonal sentation.

The criteria for gender-affirming hor-\nmone therapy are as follows:\n1. Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria;\n2. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent\nfor treatment;\n3. Age of majority in a given country . . . ;\n4. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present,\nthey must be reasonably well-controlled.37\nCommon agents used for feminization regimens are estrogen and antian-\ndrogens, and the common agent used for masculinization regimens is\ntestosterone. Progestins are controversial in feminizing regimens, and\nclinicians can cite only anecdotal evidence for the hormone\u2019s use in full\nbreast development. A clinical comparison of feminizing regimens with\nand without the use of progestins found that these agents did not enhance\nbreast growth or reduce serum levels of free testosterone.38 Additionally,\nprogestins\u2019 adverse effects outweigh their benefits because depression,\nweight gain, and lipid changes have been seen with these agents.39 How-\never, progestins do play a role in masculinizing regimens and when used\nin early stages of hormonal therapy assist in the cessation of menses. LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 247\nPHYSICAL EFFECTS OF GENDER-AFFIRMING\nHORMONE THERAPY\nA thorough discussion regarding the physical effects of gender-affirming\nhormone therapy between the health care professional and the patient is\nwarranted. Using endocrine agents to achieve congruency with a patient\u2019s\ngender identity will induce physical changes, which may be reversible or\nirreversible. Most physical changes occur within two years, with several\nstudies estimating the process to span five years. The length of time\nattributed to such changes is unique to each individual. Tables 7.2 and\n7.3 outline the estimated effects and the course of such changes.\nTable 7.2.

LGB\nindividuals may keep their sexual orientation concealed, but the effects\nof hormonal agents on the transgender person are noticeable to others.\nTransgender and gender-nonconforming individuals may have to come\nout during social interactions, unless they wish to relocate to a new area,\nwhere they may choose not to disclose their transgender identity, often\nreferred to in the community as \u201cliving stealth.\u201d\nThe coming out process may seem daunting to endure and may\nencompass numerous challenges. Those lacking support or who have been\n\u201cmistreated, harassed, marginalized, defined by surgical status, or repeat-\nedly asked probing personal questions may . . . [experience] significant\ndistress.\u201d40 Additionally, the persistent and chronic nature of these micro-\naggressions have led some researchers to apply the minority stress model\nto transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals.41 Such experiences\ncreate a potential for increase in the rate of certain health care condi-\ntions, such as clinical depression and anxiety and their somatization, or\nconversion to physical symptoms.42\nTransgender people, like all other LGBTQ+ people, need to learn\nhow to become informed consumers of health care services and make\ninformed choices about their physical and mental well-being. The next\nsection explains how to become such a knowledgeable patient.\nWatch\nA video from the Montgomery College, Maryland, nursing program (https://\ngo.geneseo.edu/transcare) provides a case study that focuses on culturally\ncompetent health care for trans and gender-nonconforming people. It cap-\ntures many of the challenges that a trans patient might face during initial\ninteractions with staff and providers at a health care clinic.\n\u2022 What challenges does Joe face in terms of accessing health\ncare?\n\u2022 What are some of the mistakes made by staff at the health\ncare clinic?\n\u2022 How does Nurse Rachel address those mistakes, both in that\ninitial visit to the clinic and afterward? LGBTQ+ Health and Wellness 249\nBEING A SMART PATIENT AND HEALTH CARE\nCONSUMER\nAs noted throughout this chapter, LGBTQ+ individuals encounter more\ndiscrimination in health care compared with the heterosexual population.\nWhile some evidence shows that negative experiences for some LGBTQ+\npersons are decreasing, discrimination continues. Lack of health care\nprovider education in culturally inclusive LGBTQ+ communication and\ncare is frequently noted as a contributing factor for health professionals\u2019\ndiscrimination. The shortage of educated practitioners and amount of\npractitioner bias have caused many LGBTQ+ persons to either delay or\navoid seeking health care services. A primary reason attributed for this\ndelay or avoidance is that LGBTQ+ individuals often feel invisible to their\nproviders and have experienced discrimination in previous encounters.43\nOther factors also contribute to the negative health care experiences\nof LGBTQ+ individuals. A provider whose value system, religious beliefs,\nand political party affiliation are hostile to LGBTQ+ people may have dif-\nficulty providing the respectful and affirming care that LGBTQ+ persons\nare entitled to. For LGBTQ+ people to receive respectful and culturally\ninclusive, patient-centered care from their providers, they must take it on\nthemselves to be informed health care consumers, practice self-advocacy,\nand shop wisely for providers who are LGBTQ+ affirming. Self-advocacy\nis essential to optimizing access to quality health services.\nHEALTH CARE PROVIDERS\nThe teaching of medical and nursing students about health issues unique\nto the LGBTQ+ population is inconsistent among education programs for\nhealth care providers. An emerging body of research finds a need for\nmore education to better meet the requirements of LGBTQ+ patients. In\none study, for example, U.S. medical schools were found to provide only\nan average of five hours of LGBTQ+ education throughout the curriculum.\nBaccalaureate nursing programs in another study spent only an average of\na little over two hours teaching content about LGBTQ+ health topics. Less\nis known about the extent to which other health provider education pro-\ngrams cover this content. During a health care clinical experience, LGBTQ+\nindividuals often encounter health care providers who lack a basic under-\nstanding of LGBTQ+ cultures, terminology, and culturally inclusive care.44\nLocating a health care facility that affirms LGBTQ+ people can be dif-\nficult but is not impossible. Some national organizations provide resources\nfor LGBTQ+ persons and health care providers. For example, the Human\nRights Campaign, the largest national LGBTQ+ civil rights organization 250 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nwith over three million members, has a benchmarking tool, the Healthcare\nEquality Index, to recognize the health care facilities with policies and\nprocedures for equity and inclusion of LGBTQ+ patients, visitors, and\nemployees. Health care facilities evaluated by the index are available in\nits directory. An agency must reapply every year to demonstrate that it\nmeets the current standards outlined by the Human Rights Campaign.45\nAnother organization, GLMA (Gay and Lesbian Medical Association),\nadvances health care equality for LGBTQ+ people and has an extensive\ndirectory of health care providers across the United States that are LGBTQ+\naffirming. The GLMA published guidelines that offer recommendations for\npractitioners to consider when caring for LGBTQ+ clients. The National\nLGBT Health Education Center, a program of the Fenway Institute, also\nhas excellent resources to help educate providers.46 Both organizations\nprovide valuable resources and are worth mentioning to a provider who\nlacks sufficient knowledge to provide culturally inclusive care for LGBTQ+\npersons. Organizations and coalitions that support LGBTQ+ health are\nlisted in table 7.4. All provide free publications and resources for the\nLGBTQ+ person and health care providers.\nTable 7.4.

Although it\nis important to be true to yourself and disclose your sexual identity to\nyour provider so you can receive the most holistic care possible, not all\nLGBTQ+ persons feel comfortable disclosing this information, particularly\nto a new health care provider with whom they have not yet established a\ntrusting relationship. The Institute of Medicine has recommended includ-\ning sexual orientation and gender identity data in electronic health records\nso that more health care facilities will ask patients for this information.47\nUltimately, however, LGBTQ+ persons must decide for themselves when\nand to whom to disclose their LGBTQ+ identity.\nBefore visiting a provider, consider calling the office to ask if they\nprovide inclusive care for LGBTQ+ patients. Bring a friend or partner to\nthe visit for support if you are uncomfortable meeting with the health\ncare provider. Health care providers must adhere to laws, policies, and\nethical codes to keep your information private. Although a health care\nprovider may ask about sexual orientation and gender identity, LGBTQ+\npersons also have the right to request that the provider not enter their\nsexual orientation and gender identity into the medical record.\nPAYING ATTENTION TO SPECIAL HEALTH ISSUES\nProviders must understand health care issues common in the LGBTQ+\npopulation and explore whether their patients have any of these risk\nfactors. GLMA has created ten resource sheets for LGBTQ+ persons, each\none addressing one of the top health concerns to discuss with a health\ncare provider. Although not all these health issues apply to every person,\nit is essential to be aware that these health topics are more common\namong LGBTQ+ people. Several health topics are relevant to all LGBTQ+\ngroups, and others pertain more to one group. For example, research has\nidentified that depression, tobacco and alcohol use, sexually transmitted\ndiseases (including human papillomavirus and HIV/AIDS), and certain\ncancers are greater health risks in the LGBTQ+ population. Moreover, the\nrisk of illicit use of injectable silicone is a more significant concern among\ntransgender women. Other health issues are more common within certain\ngroups, such as breast and gynecological cancers among lesbians and\nmale-to-female transgender persons. In addition to the risk of HIV/AIDS\namong men who have sex with men, they also have a higher incidence\nof and mortality from prostate, anal, and colon cancer.48 252 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nMinimizing risk factors for these acute and chronic illnesses is essen-\ntial to maintaining health. The LGBT Health Link is a network for health\nequity and offers very practical advice for things that LGBTQ+ people can\ndo to improve their wellness. Recommendations include how to search for\ninsurance options, practice preventive care, seek mental health support,\nadopt a healthier lifestyle, and practice safer sex.49\nThe resources provided in this section support LGBTQ+ individuals\nto advocate for themselves when seeking health care services, particularly\nfrom providers who are not well educated about LGBTQ+ health issues\nor who do not demonstrate culturally inclusive and affirming behaviors.\nAlthough health care providers are responsible for establishing a trusting\nrelationship with their patients, this does not consistently occur in every\nhealth care setting. When a health care provider demonstrates genuine\nconcern and respect for an LGBTQ+ individual in a practice not restricted\nto a fifteen-minute office visit, then there is greater opportunity for indi-\nvidualized, holistic, patient-centered care.\nBecoming a smarter LGBTQ+ health consumer requires being aware\nof the community\u2019s complex history with medicine, understanding the\nunique health issues involved, and recognizing health risks and changes\nthat occur over the course of life.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 How has Western medicine shaped the history of nonnorma-\ntive genders and sexualities in Europe and the United States?\n\u2022 How has LGBTQ+ activism influenced health care systems\nand medical practice?\n\u2022 What connections do you see between people\u2019s sexual or\ngender identities and their experiences in Western health care\nsettings?\n\u2022 Why would it be important for a health care professional to\nunderstand a patient\u2019s identity from an intersectional per-\nspective?\n\u2022 Why would some argue that Western medicine is a key social\ninstitution that has helped to define and enforce structures\nof inequality for LGBTQ+ people?

It describes the definitions\nLGBTQ+ people have for family and the relationships LGBTQ+ individuals\nhave with their families of origin. It investigates how minority stress,\nfamily acceptance, and rejection affect these relationships. The chapter\ndiscusses how LGBTQ+ people form intimate relationships, how people in\nthese relationships navigate established (often discriminatory) social and\nlegal systems, and how recent social and legal changes (e.g., marriage\nequality) affect these relationships. It talks about the nature and preva-\nlence of families headed by LGBTQ+ people that include children and the\nways that LGBTQ+ people become parents. It reviews the changing legal\nlandscape as it relates to same-sex parenting and family building and\ndelineates some of the challenges these families face when interacting\nwith legal systems, health care and human services providers, and edu-\ncators. The final section considers what it means to come out as LGBTQ+\nto one\u2019s children. Each section also critically explores the relevant sci-\nentific literatures, challenges existing anti-LGBTQ+ myths, and identifies\nresources and organizations that support LGBTQ+ families.\nIt is difficult to quantify how many people in the United States are in\nLGBTQ+ relationships. U.S. census data give us some idea, although the\nnumbers are likely underreported. The U.S. census counted approximately\n10.7 million adults (4.3 percent of the U.S. adult population) who identify\nas LGBTQ+ and 1.4 million adults (0.6 percent of the U.S. adult population)\nwho identify as transgender.1 Of those, approximately 1.1 million are in\nsame-sex marriages (totaling 547,000 couples),2 and 1.2 million are part\nof an unmarried same-sex relationship (totaling 600,000 couples).3\nWHAT IS A RELATIONSHIP?\nThe word relationship can refer to many types of social interactions. Rela-\ntionship research typically focuses on interpersonal relationships, which\nare deep, close relationships between two or more people. These relation-\nships are sometimes described in other ways, as a friendship, a couple, LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 269\nor a marriage. Research exploring LGBTQ+ interpersonal relationships is\noften centered on intimate or sexual relationships that are described as\na partnership, a couple, a marriage, or just a relationship.\nHOW DO LGBTQ+ RELATIONSHIPS FORM?\nRelationships vary in the internal and external resources that strengthen\nthe relationship, contributing to the well-being of the members in the\nrelationship, and that help them cope with the stressors they have to\nconfront both as individuals and as a couple. The availability of external\nresources is a changing landscape for same-sex couples.4\nFor example, research has demonstrated that gay men, lesbians,\nand middle-aged heterosexuals\u2014those looking for mates in what they\nterm \u201ca thin market\u201d\u2014are more likely to rely on the internet to find a\npartner.5 A nationally representative longitudinal survey, \u201cHow Couples\nMeet and Stay Together (HCMST),\u201d of over four thousand adults found\nthat, on average, although heterosexual and same-sex couples reported\nmeeting primarily through friends, trends since 2009 suggest that the\nnumber of couples meeting online from both groups is increasing, but\nsame-sex couples are significantly more likely to meet online than het-\nheteronormative\nerosexual couples.6\nA societal belief that\nmakes heterosexuality\nthe default and assumes\nQUEER RESISTANCE\nthat everyone is\nheterosexual until proved\nSome same-sex relationships, with or without children, follow the expected otherwise; normalizing\nnorms regarding monogamy and exclusivity.

In a study of gay two sexual or romantic\nmale couples in the San Francisco Bay Area, agreements guiding open partners and their\nrelationships varied considerably among gay male couples, with most dependent children. 270 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 8.1.

A related study\nfound that about equal numbers reported having agreements to allow\nsex with people outside the relationship (47 percent) and agreements to\nbe monogamous (45 percent), with some (8 percent) reporting disagree-\nments. Other studies have found slightly higher levels of monogamy (52.8\npercent) and fewer couples reporting open relationships (13.0 percent),\nand some find \u201cmonogamish\u201d relationships (14.9 percent) or discrepant\nrelationships (in which partners do not agree on whether they are in an\nopen or monogamous relationship; 19.3 percent).

Before 2015 this field was not uniformly open to\nthe study of same-sex couples, but it now is an important site of inquiry\nabout LGBTQ+ relationship quality, longevity, and impact. Much of the\nliterature on same-sex relationship quality focuses on comparing LGBTQ+\npeople\u2019s dating, cohabitation, and marriage pathways and experiences\nwith heterosexual people. This work has repeatedly found that LGBTQ+\nrelationships experience the same level of satisfaction compared with\nnon-LGBTQ+ relationships and that similar variables predict stability and\noverall satisfaction in these relationships.11 The outcome of this research\nhas shown repeatedly that LGBTQ+ relationships are just as well adjusted\nas their heterosexual counterparts and experience similar stressors. 272 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nHowever, LGBTQ+ people, as stigmatized minorities, experience\nminority stress\nhigher rates of mental and physical health challenges, such as mood\nHealth disparities often\nand anxiety disorders, compared with heterosexual and cisgender peo-\nfound in minority groups\nple.12 This unique stress, called minority stress, affects those in LGBTQ+\ncan be explained in part\nrelationships both internally (internalized heterosexism) and externally\nby the discrimination\nthey endure, and this (experiences of discrimination) and has a negative effect on relationship\ndiscrimination causes quality and satisfaction (figure 8.3).

Minority stress process in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations. (Public domain, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.) LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 273\nThis stress provides unique challenges for LGBTQ+ couples and fam-\nilies, compared with their straight and cisgender counterparts. LGBTQ+\ncouples often have to navigate judgment and rejection from their families\nof origin and in systems, including employment and faith communities.\nAs mentioned earlier, nonheteronormative couples (e.g., polyamorous\nLGBTQ+ couples) may face even more relationship scrutiny from oth-\ners, although the impact of such scrutiny remains underexplored in the\nresearch.\nAdditional factors that affect heterosexual and cisgender relation-\nships also affect LGBTQ+ relationships, including dating violence and\ndivorce. Prevalence of dating violence among LGBTQ+ adolescents,\nalthough not as robust a line of inquiry as for heterosexual youth and\nadults, is higher than national averages for all adolescents. In addition,\ndating violence in adolescence appears to predict its perpetuation into\ncollege years, as well as other behaviors (such as not using condoms)\nthat put these youth at risk as they enter adulthood. Thus the recog-\nnition and prevention of relationship and dating violence with LGBTQ+\ncommunities is important. Some researchers and practitioners theorize\nthat the lack of consistent and positive role models and inclusion of\nhealthy LGBTQ+ relationships in sex education curricula and from par-\nents and mentors creates a vacuum of information on negotiating healthy\nrelationships, particularly for adolescents.15 Thus, one way to improve\nrelationship quality for LGBTQ+ couples and families is to ensure an\ninclusive curriculum and access to information that includes queer cou-\nples and families across the lifespan.\nThose who enter the normative relationship of legal marriage may\nlater opt to seek a legal divorce.

In several studies\nin the United Kingdom, lesbians were twice as likely to seek a divorce\ncompared with gay men. In reporting on these statistics, one sociologist\ntheorized that higher rates of divorce among queer and lesbian women\ncan be explained by women entering commitment sooner and having\nhigher standards for the relationship overall.16\nWHAT IS A FAMILY?\nFor some, family refers specifically to a social unit of two people, most\noften a man and a woman, who live together, share resources, and are\nraising children (or plan to reproduce and raise children) (figure 8.4).\nHowever, family actually describes many types of social organizations.\nIt can refer to groups of people organized by kinship and biology\u2014with\ndesignations like parents, siblings, cousins, and aunts or uncles\u2014as well\nFigure 8.4.

They describe an inclusionary model, defining\nA couple with\nfamily quite broadly as \u201csame-sex and hetero-sexual couples with or\nchildren from previous\nwithout children, regardless of marital status.\u201d A moderate model defines\nrelationships. 276 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 8.5.

[who] perform a surrogate role, often filling in\nfor family members who are missing due to distance, abandonment or\ndeath.\u201d23 It has been suggested that chosen families are more common\namong marginalized groups.24 However, use of the term chosen family\nmay vary by class and race. White middle-class LGBTQ+ people are more\nlikely to use the term, and lower-income LGBTQ+ people of color are\nless likely to use it but also less likely to use exclusionary definitions of\nfamily in general.25\nFAMILY SUPPORT AND REJECTION\nFamily support and acceptance is an important psychological resource that\ncan influence an individual\u2019s well-being in a number of ways (figure 8.6). LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 277\nFigure 8.6. Sign at a Pride\nevent.

For others, heterosexism and anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice are too\npernicious and may manifest as hostility, rejection, and even violence.\nFAMILY STRESSORS\nRejection by family members of one\u2019s sexual orientation, gender identity,\nor gender expression can affect the health and wellness of people who\nidentify as LGBTQ+.

Promising research is showing the importance of siblings\nand grandparents in the lives of LGBTQ+ people.31\nSome families experience feelings of loss, grief, and shame, among\nothers, when they find they have LGBTQ+ family members. Loss and\ngrief may result from feeling that they have to give up more heteronor-\nmative ideals of marriage or grandchildren for their child. Shame may\nbe related to either latent or blatant anti-LGBTQ+ bias and the fear of\nbeing judged by others for having an LGBTQ+ family member. Outside\nresources may allow families to process their feelings separate from their\nfamily members. An important organization supporting the experiences\nof families with LGBTQ+ family members is PFLAG (formerly known as\nParents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). PFLAG was started\nin the United States in 1973 by \u201ca mother publicly supporting her gay\nson\u201d and has expanded to over two hundred thousand members in four\nhundred locations.32 Using a three-pronged approach of advocacy, edu-\ncation, and support, PFLAG\u2019s chapters across the United States function\nlargely as support groups for families and friends to process their feelings\nand to shift to becoming advocates for their loved ones (figure 8.7).

Because LGBTQ+ people continue to face discrimination from\ntheir birth families, places of employment, and communities and ongoing\nthreats from social and legal institutions, some may be hesitant to reveal\ntheir identities or relationships. Because same-sex marriage has been\nlegal in the United States only since 2015 and the means of relationship\nformation have been actively shifting, records available to researchers are\nlimited or incomplete.33\nAlso, a great deal of research that is affirming to LGBTQ+ people\nrelies on exclusionary heteronormative definitions of family that limit\nLGBTQ+ families to those conforming to a traditional heterosexual model\nor that suggest ideal LGBTQ+ families are those that attempt to conform to\nthose exclusionary models. These definitions may result in the additional\nmarginalization of families that fail to conform to these definitions (e.g.,\nnonmonogamous\nchosen families, families without children, nonmonogamous families, or\nfamilies\npolyamorous families). In addition, such research often focuses on white\nCouples who have\nfamilies, neglecting queer families of color, working-class queer families,\nchildren and who engage\nand other families situated at the intersection of multiple systems of\nconsensually in sexual\noppression.34\nactivities with other adults\noutside each couple.\nLGBTQ+ FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN\nAlthough not all families include children, becoming parents can be an\nimportant goal for many. Research has suggested that a wide range of\nmotivations push people to become parents, including emotional bonding,\npersonal fulfillment, giving and receiving love, continuing the family line,\nand not being alone later in life. Other reasons include one\u2019s partner\nwanting to become a parent or a need to feel complete. Lesbian mothers\nand gay fathers have reported many of the same motivations for becoming\nparents, but these motivations may be shaped by the unique context of\nLGBTQ+ parenthood. For example, a study of the parenting motivations\nof gay fathers found that some were motivated by the desire to instill\ntolerance in their children, thereby creating a more tolerant world.35\nApproximately 48 percent of LGBTQ+ women and 20 percent of\nLGBTQ+ men under age fifty are raising children.36 Some are doing so as\npart of a couple and some as single parents. In addition, approximately\n3.7 million children in the United States have a parent who is LGBTQ+,\nand approximately 200,000 have parents who are part of a same-sex\nrelationship (as either couples or single parents) (figure 8.8).37 LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 281\nFigure 8.8. A same-sex\ncouple with their children\nat San Francisco Gay Pride\n2008. (CC-BY-SA Caitlin\nChilds.)\nHOW ARE LGBTQ+ FAMILIES WITH\nCHILDREN FORMED?\nLGBTQ+ families with children are created several ways. Some may\nbecome parents while in a heterosexual relationship, and they come out\nlater in life. Some may be in a relationship with a member of the other\nsex, but identify as bisexual or nonheterosexual. Others may identify as\nLGBTQ+, be in a same-sex relationship, and become parents through the\nuse of assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy, adoption, or foster\ncare.38\nPARENTS COMING OUT AS LGBTQ+\nBecause of societal pressure and expectations, LGB people of older gen-\nerations may have entered relationships with a different sex partner to\navoid admitting their sexual orientation, to avoid stigma and be accepted,\nor to have children at a time when family-building options for LGB peo-\nple were unimaginable for most. Children\u2019s reactions to parents\u2019 coming\nout as LGB range from disbelief and shock to blaming the other parent\nfor the LGB person\u2019s \u201cchanged\u201d identity, to feelings of acceptance and 282 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nlove.39 Some adult children report feeling closer to their parent now that\nthey know.40 Many of these reactions are mediated by the child\u2019s age\nand developmental stage at the time of disclosure. In fact, some experts\non family communication now suggest that coming out to one\u2019s children\nis about strengthening and \u201cdeepening\u201d the relationship, not divulging\na dark secret.41\nParents who come out as transgender face experiences similar to\nthose of their cisgender LGB counterparts (e.g., challenges disclosing their\nsexuality and gaining acceptance from children, ex- and current partners,\nand extended family members) but also different. First, the child\u2019s age\nmay influence reaction to the disclosure. The younger the children are, the\nmore flexible their thinking and the easier they adapt to the news. Second,\nfinding those who have a similar experience coming out as transgender\nto their children may be difficult. A transgender parent often needs to\nconnect with other transgender parents in similar circumstances to find\nsupport. Third, many transgender parents report that their relationships\nwith their children were \u201cthe same or better\u201d after disclosing their identity\nthan they were before disclosure.42\nGay and lesbian stepfamilies may also have needs and challenges\ndistinct from either straight families or gay and lesbian families with\nchildren.43 In addition to the challenges of forming a stepfamily, gay and\nlesbian individuals often have to negotiate whether, how, and whom to\ncome out to and assess the impact of coming out on both the individual\nand the family. Coparenting with a different-sex ex-spouse or partner can\nrange from supportive to antagonistic and can acknowledge or ignore the\nperson\u2019s new same-sex partner or spouse.\nMYTHS ABOUT SAME-SEX PARENTING AND\nCHILDREN IN LGBTQ+ FAMILIES\nMyths associated with same-sex parenting and the experiences of children\nraised by same-sex parents have negatively influenced the decisions of\nLGBTQ+ parents and interactions with legal and social services profes-\nsionals.44 These myths include concerns that children raised by same-sex\nparents or in LGBTQ+ households will experience disruptions in their gen-\nder identity development or in their gender role behaviors or that they will\nbecome gay or lesbian themselves. Other myths suggest these children\nwill have more mental health and behavioral problems; will experience\nproblems in their social relationships and experience more stigmatization,\nteasing, and bullying; and are more likely to be sexually abused by their\nparents or parent\u2019s friends. Research has soundly refuted all these myths. LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 283\nThe psychologist Charlotte Patterson conducted some of most cited\nresearch debunking the negative myths about same-sex parenting. Her\nresearch has explored the behavioral adjustment, self-concepts, and sex\nrole behaviors of children raised in same-sex households, concluding\nthat \u201cmore than two decades of research has failed to reveal important\ndifferences in the adjustment or development of children or adolescents\nreared by same-sex couples compared to those reared by other-sex cou-\nples.\u201d45 She points out that the quality of family relationships is the most\nimportant predictor of healthy child development. A review exploring the\nimplications and fitness of same-sex parenting for children found that,\nacross twenty-three studies, the most common myths about impaired\nemotional functioning, greater likelihood of a homosexual sexual orienta-\ntion, greater stigmatization by peers, nonconforming-gender role behavior\nand identity, poor behavioral adjustment, and impaired cognitive func-\ntioning were simply not true. Children raised by lesbian moms and gay\ndads were no more likely to experience negative outcomes than children\nraised by heterosexual parents (figure 8.9).46\nFigure 8.9. Gay couple\nand child at San\nFrancisco Gay Pride\n2008. (CC-BY-SA Caitlin\nChilds.) 284 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nBoth the myths about LGBTQ+ parents and their children and the\nstereotypes\nresearch refuting the myths have found their way into the family courts.\nNegative, positive, or\nPrejudicial attitudes and stereotypes describing unfit lesbian moms and\nneutral beliefs about the\nirresponsible gay dads have historically been used in custody cases to\nmembers of a group that\njustify punitive court decisions. Research that establishes the fitness of\nare often unsubstantiated.\nLGBTQ+ parents has been influential in custody cases, and Patterson\nattitudes herself has served as an expert witness in numerous custody and other\nPositive or negative court cases.47 LGBTQ+ families\u2019 lives are shaped by the powerful social\naffective evaluations of forces of heterosexism and cissexism. These forces can influence policy\nsomeone or something.\nand law, including family court cases, so there is a continuing need for\nunbiased and scientifically rigorous studies on LGBTQ+ family formation\nand the developmental and social outcomes for children in these families.\nNAVIGATING AND CHANGING SYSTEMS\nAND INSTITUTIONS\nSome LGBTQ+ people and their allies have seized the moment of societal\nchange by trying to change systems from within, finding private sector\ncorporations to be much more open and agile in response to their needs\nthan public institutions. To not lose customers or employees because\nof anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, many corporations are opting to strengthen\nLGBTQ+ workplace policies and affinity groups.48 Such policies include\nequal spousal and partner health care benefits, affirmative transgender\nhealth care benefits, gender-neutral bathrooms, and nondiscrimination\npolicies that provide protections for sexual orientation, gender identity,\nand gender expression (figure 8.10). To capture the progress being made\nin the private sector, the Human Rights Campaign rates corporations in\ntheir annual Corporate Equality Index. Described as a \u201cbenchmarking\ntool on corporate policies and practices pertinent to lesbian, gay, bisex-\nual, transgender, and queer employees,\u201d these ratings are often used by\ncorporations to demonstrate openness and inclusion.49\nThese corporate workplace gains haven\u2019t come without criticism,\nhowever. Some have voiced concerns that private sector openness to\nLGBTQ+ communities is really just a way of manipulating workers into\ncomplacency by \u201ckeeping employees happy\u201d and exploiting their need to\n\u201cseek meaning through their job.\u201d These policies can mask labor viola-\ntions and exploitative practices, thereby creating the perfect marriage of\nassimilationist\ncapitalism and personal identity.50 These corporate policies and practices\nFixing the system from\nwithin, trying to fit are often described as assimilationist\u2014that is, a strategy \u201cthat strives\ninto the status quo; for access to those in power [and] is rooted in an interest-group and\nintegrating. legislative-lobbying approach to political change.\u201d51 LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 285\nFigure 8.10. A 2018 rally\nin support of protecting\naccess to health care for the\ntransgender community.\n(CC-BY-SA Ted Eytan)\nOther institutional change from within has occurred in health care\nand human services agencies. The National Association of Social Workers\nexpressed its support in 2002 for allowing same-sex couples to foster\nand adopt and has repeatedly issued professional support for same-sex\nmarriage\u2014for example, in 2013 and 2015 in relation to Supreme Court\nrulings.52 In 2004, the American Medical Association issued a similar\nstatement supporting adoption, and in 2012, issued support for same-sex\ncivil marriage. In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatricians expressed\nits support for allowing same-sex couples to marry and to become foster\nand adoptive parents. Other professional groups (for example, the Amer-\nican Psychiatric Association and the American Counseling Association)\nhave followed suit. Collectively, these statements recognize that combating\ndiscrimination against LGBTQ+ families is important, discrimination is\nitself a public health issue, and families should receive professional and\nunbiased care and services.\nPARENTING AND FAMILY BUILDING\nFamily and adoption rights are one way that LGBTQ+ parents are dis-\ncriminated against if they have biological children, want to adopt, or want 286 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nWatch\nWatch \u201c5 Positive Things to Say to a Queer Family [Trying to Conceive]\u201d\n(https://youtu.be/7nXTz1eN0Ko).

What advice about\nallyship did you find helpful?\naccess to infertility treatment. Only five states actively ban discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity for foster and adoptive\nparents, an additional three states ban discrimination based on sexual\norientation, and ten states have laws that allow discrimination against\nLGBTQ+ prospective foster parents. Most states are largely silent on the\ntopic, opening up a range of treatment toward same-sex adopting fam-\nilies, from active discrimination that is based in law to indifference.53\nLittle change has been made to recognize same-sex parents despite the\noverwhelming evidence that being raised in an LGBTQ+ family is not\ninherently harmful or destructive to the children.54\nNumerous studies have, however, documented the health and stress\nimpacts of unequal laws on families that are headed by same-sex couples.\nFor instance, should a child fall ill, a parent who is not legally recognized\nmay be excluded from making medical decisions or may be separated\nfrom their child during an emergency because they are not recognized\nby medical staff as a parent or guardian. Unnecessary legal hurdles and\nsimultaneous societal discrimination against same-sex households appear\nto be the root of stress, not the LGBTQ+ parents themselves.55\nLEGAL SYSTEMS\nSame-sex couples report navigating many legal challenges that vary\ndepending on how the couple structures their family. Interviews with\nfifty-one LGB parents in California found that the law affected their lives\nand decisions in three dominant arenas: (1) how to have children, (2) LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 287\nwhere to live, and (3) how their family was (or wasn\u2019t) recognized.56\nAlthough some legal protections exist nationally, legal protections for\nLGBTQ+ families vary widely by state, highlighting the need to carefully\nconsider the three arenas when determining how to best protect one\u2019s\nfamily.\nLGBTQ+ polyamorous couples who wish to have their entire family\nrecognized and legally protected face numerous challenges, the biggest\nbeing that in almost all states and countries you may designate only one\nspouse in a legal marriage. These designations often mean that poly-\namorous couples cannot obtain health insurance for all their spouses or\npartners.57\nHEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES PROVIDERS\nSame-sex couples, with or without children, report unequal treatment in\nhealth care and human services care compared with their heterosexual\nand cisgender peers. For same-sex couples seeking health care for their\nchildren, invisibility, or not being recognized by health care providers as\na family unit, is one barrier to quality health care. A survey of nursing\nand medical students found that 69 percent did not directly ask about\nthe relationship among family members or were unsure if they should\ndirectly ask if the two same-sex adults were a couple responsible for the\nchild receiving care.58 Not being seen and legitimized as a family unit\nis stressful to the couple and can also complicate care if one parent is\nnot recognized as a guardian or is left out of decision-making processes.\nSupportive and affirming policies, practices, and professionals are\nparticularly needed to serve the aging LGBTQ+ community. The aging\nLGBTQ+ population is underserved and experiences higher risk of medi-\ncal issues compared with their heterosexual peers.59 Having higher need,\ncombined with stigma from health care providers, leads to unsatisfactory\nand unequal treatment in out-of-home care. Couples who are aging and\nrequire out-of-home care often report anxiety about how they will be\ntreated by staff and whether they will be seen, treated, and respected as\na couple.60 One study found that over half of elder LGBTQ+ adults were\nopposed to assisted living, and 80 percent were opposed to out-of-home\ncare because of fear of discrimination, including how their partner would\nbe treated and whether their advance directives for health care would be\nrecognized and respected.61\nDiscrimination from human services providers in care and deci-\nsion-making has long been of concern. For example, LGBTQ+ people in\ngeneral and same-sex couples in particular face bias and outright dis- 288 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ncrimination when trying to adopt a child from foster care or through a\nsocial services agency. A survey of 169 diverse gay and lesbian parents\nfound that over one-third were not emotionally supported when they\nwere seeking to adopt (their adoption worker did not express support\nfor them), in contrast to the experience of straight adopting couples, and\nnearly 15 percent felt very stressed when coming out as lesbian or gay to\ntheir adoption worker, fearing that it would limit their chances of having\na child placed in their home.62\nSCHOOLS AND EDUCATORS\nLGBTQ+ families with children interact with education systems with vary-\ning degrees of support for their families and identities. Challenges may\ninclude being treated differently from straight and cisgender parents, not\nhaving their family structures represented in the curriculum, and not\nhaving both same-sex parents respected as equal parents when decisions\nneed to be made about their child. In addition, some LGBTQ+ parents\nhave described trying to help their children explain their family structure\n(e.g., \u201cI have two dads\u201d) to other children at school, which is especially\ndifficult when the classroom lacks LGBTQ+ cultural competency. These\nchallenges can have a negative effect on the well-being of LGBTQ+ fam-\nilies and their children. College teaching and education programs need\nto place greater emphasis on training future educators, before they enter\nthe classroom, in how to demonstrate cultural competence when working\nwith LGBTQ+ families.63\nTRENDS AND CHANGES IN THE LEGAL\nLANDSCAPE\nmarriage equality\nAs Patterson and colleagues have pointed out, today\u2019s quickly shifting\nThe recognition of same-\nlegal landscapes regarding LGBTQ+ relationships, marriage equality,\nsex marriage as a human\nreproductive technologies, and foster parenting and adoption by LGBTQ+\nand civil right, as well\nindividuals have brought challenges but also promise for improving the\nas recognition by law\nlives of LGBTQ+ families. However, these advances remain vulnerable to\nand support of societal\nchanging attitudes and political majorities. After marriage equality became\ninstitutions.\nlaw through the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) ruling by the U.S.\nSupreme Court, state legislatures began considering legislation to limit\nits influence, and court cases based on the right to religious freedom try\nto reverse gains. The future legal landscape for LGBTQ+ people appears\nuncertain.64 LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 289\nSTRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: QUEER CAUTIONS\nAND RESISTANCE\nLGBTQ+ communities, and the families that form within the community,\nare not monolithic. Therefore, any discussion of family within such a\ndiverse and intersectional community will be a complicated one. For some\nLGBTQ+ people, the LGBTQ+ movement\u2019s recent emphasis on assimila-\ntionist approaches to social change, such as fighting for access to heter-\nonormative institutions like marriage, is misguided and actually privilege\nheterosexuality over queer lives. Some highlight the diverse and creative\nways that LGBTQ+ people create families, emphasizing the importance of\nchoosing families and raising concerns about laws and legally sanctioned\ninstitutions that often place limitations on what counts as family.\nSome LGBTQ+ people are concerned that vital and limited resources\nin the fight for things like a national nondiscrimination law have been\nreallocated to the fight for marriage equality. Thus, ironically, a lesbian\nliving in a state like Texas can now marry her wife but be unable to order\na wedding cake if the local baker opposes LGBTQ+ families or marriage.\nOthers look beyond the argument that marriage provides a way to gain\naccess to important resources and benefits (e.g., health insurance, inheri-\ntance and property rights, visitation rights in hospitals and jails, adoption\nrights), instead asking why these benefits must be tied to marriage in the\nfirst place. Some scholars suggest that queer communities should reject\nall notions of family building altogether. They point out that rather than\nmaking these benefits available to all, marriage equality has created a\nnew set of boundaries that define who has access to certain privileges\nthat remain inaccessible for others in the broader LGBTQ+ community.65\nPROFILE: LGBTQ+ FAMILY BUILDING:\nCHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITY\nChrista Craven\nQueer people have a long history of creating family in many different\nways, including creating chosen families among adults (and sometimes\nchildren) who may not be biologically related. Yet with the enhancement\nof legal rights in recent years, such as same-sex marriage, many LGBTQ+\npeople are feeling more pressure than ever to form families that include\nbiological or adopted children or both. People have said to me, \u201cAfter\nwe got married, the next logical question from our families and friends\nwas, \u2018When will you have kids?\u2019 \u201d With greater access to reproductive\ntechnologies and adoption for same-sex parents over the last few decades, 290 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nLGBTQ+ people have significant opportunities to build families. However,\nexperts estimate that a quarter of all pregnancies end in loss, and a\nsimilar number of adoptions fall through; 12 percent of U.S. women are\ndiagnosed with infertility; and transgender people are often faced with\ndifficult reproductive decisions relating to transition. With the rise in\nLGBTQ+ family making\u2014the \u201cgayby boom\u201d\u2014the numbers of reproduc-\ntive losses through miscarriage, stillbirth, failed adoptions, infertility, and\nsterility have also increased.\nIn addition to heteronormative assumptions about who should have\nchildren, LGBTQ+ intended parents face another layer of invisibility and\nisolation as they combat the well-documented cultural silence surrounding\nreproductive loss. Even among those who support LGBTQ+ families, there\nis often political silencing of queer family-making narratives when they\ndo not produce a happy ending. Moreover, the reproductive challenges\nLGBTQ+ families continue to face have received little attention and have\nbeen exacerbated by increasingly restrictive laws regarding LGBTQ+ adop-\ntion and family recognition following the 2016 U.S. elections. LGBTQ+\nfamily making is politicized even within queer communities by progres-\nsive efforts to create a seamless narrative of progress toward enhanced\nmarital and familial rights. These contentious political battles often eclipse\nthe challenges and barriers LGBTQ+ parents face in establishing and\ngaining recognition as families.\nPhysicians and public health experts estimate that 10\u201320 percent of\nall recognized pregnancies in the United States and 30\u201340 percent of all\nconceptions end in pregnancy loss. Estimates for other countries vary\nsubstantially. The knowledge that a pregnancy has ended is likely higher\nfor LGBTQ+ people, who are often more intentional in planning their\nfamilies than their straight peers and thus more likely to be doing early\nhome pregnancy tests. Public perception regarding pregnancy loss differs\nsubstantially from public health estimates. A 2015 survey of over a thou-\nsand U.S. adults showed that 55 percent thought miscarriage was rare\n(occurring in 5 percent or less of pregnancies).66 In addition, 12 percent\nof U.S. women are diagnosed with infertility, and fertility preservation\noptions are not always made available to transgender people considering\nhormones or surgery. Likewise, a review of U.S. studies among different\npopulations estimates adoption failure rates, or what adoption agencies\neuphemistically refer to as \u201cdisruptions,\u201d of 10\u201325 percent.67 Statistics on\nadoption are not kept in most countries.\nI interviewed over fifty LGBTQ+ people to understand how they expe-\nrience loss, grief, and mourning. They included those who carried preg-\nnancies, nongestational and adoptive parents, and families from a broad\nrange of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds. I found LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 291\nthat stories of loss, death, and reproductive challenges that accompany\nqueer family making are often ignored or silenced both inside and outside\nLGBTQ+ communities, resulting in personal and political isolation. Three\nexamples drawn from my study highlight the need for more inclusive\nsupport resources.68\nALEX AND NORA\u2019S STORY\nWhen I spoke with Alex and Nora, they had experienced a second-trimes-\nter loss less than a year before. Nora, a cisgender lesbian, had physically\ncarried their first daughter, but she had developed health complications\nthat made another pregnancy dangerous for her health. The couple agreed\nthat Alex, who had previously identified as a female-to-male transman,\nwould carry their next child. Alex had adopted a genderqueer lesbian\nidentity after becoming pregnant and was pregnant at the time of our\ninterview. Nora explained how her experience of their loss was not only\na physical and emotional one but also personally and legally complex.\nIn losing our daughter . . . , I lost not only a biological and\na physical connection. . . . I also lost the ability to have legal\nrights [to our future children], to have my name on this child\u2019s\nbirth certificate. . . . I\u2019m not even going to be able to petition\nfor that [where we live].\nIn 2011, Nora would have had no legal rights to their child borne by Alex\nbecause the couple lived in a state where nongestational queer parents\nwere denied access to second-parent adoption of their children. But to\nNora, having to formally adopt in any jurisdiction and be evaluated on\nher fitness as a parent was devastating.\nNonetheless, the couple continued to consider pursuing legal adop-\ntion in another state or country and then returning to their home state\nto request a reissued birth certificate that would recognize them both as\nlegal parents. Unlike same-sex marriages or civil unions, which were not\nrecognized in much of the United States before 2015 and not recognized\nin countries where laws do not permit same-sex unions, adoptions are\nrecognized across jurisdictions. However, financial instability\u2014Nora was\na full-time graduate student and Alex an administrative assistant\u2014put\nthis option for giving both of them legal parental status out of the cou-\nple\u2019s reach.\nAlthough the couple lived in a liberal midwestern town, the homopho-\nbic state and federal laws that governed Nora\u2019s relationship\u2014or lack of\nlegal relationship\u2014with the child borne by her partner heightened her 292 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nexperience of loss. They encountered silencing within queer communi-\nties following their loss, which resulted in feelings of isolation. As Alex\nexplained, LGBTQ+ reproductive loss \u201ccomplicates the political rhetoric.\nIt\u2019s the same reason you don\u2019t hear about gay divorce, because it com-\nplicates the political rhetoric of trying to get marriage equality.\u201d\nSignificant changes in the legal landscape for LGBTQ+ couples and\nfamilies have occurred in the 2010s, in the United States and through-\nout the world. After the national recognition of same-sex marriage in\n2015 following the Obergefell v. Hodges U.S. Supreme Court case, many\nLGBTQ+ parents assumed that the presumption of parenthood (that both\nindividuals in a marital union are legal parents to any child born within\nthat union) would be extended to lesbian and gay married couples, as it\nis for heterosexual couples. However, legal precedent on this issue has\nbeen inconsistent, which can leave LGBTQ+ families\u2014even those formed\nwithin legal marriages\u2014vulnerable in ways that heterosexual married\ncouples are not. Additionally, any children born to same-sex parents\noutside a legal marriage must still be formally adopted by the same-sex\nsecond parent. In the case that the couple legally marries (or the mar-\nriage becomes legally recognized) after the child is born, a stepparent\nadoption is required.\nAs of April 2019, only fifteen states allow unmarried parents to peti-\ntion for second-parent adoption. Laws also exist in some states that allow\ndiscrimination against LGBTQ+ parents by adoption agencies that cite\nreligious beliefs against same-sex parenting. In 2019, U.S. legal experts\nin the American Bar Association acknowledged that, despite the federal\nrecognition of same-sex marriage in 2015, \u201cstate-sanctioned discrimina-\ntion against LGBT individuals who wish to raise children has dramatically\nincreased in recent years.\u201d69 Many adoptive parents also expressed the\nfear that homophobia and heterosexism within adoption agencies and\namong birth families meant they had a higher likelihood of adoption\ndisruption than heterosexual couples.\nMIKE\u2019S STORY\nMike\u2019s particularly heartbreaking story concerned suffering the loss of\ntwins in an adoption. He and his partner, Arnold, had traveled to Vermont\nto get a civil union during the 1990s and began the adoption process\nshortly afterward in their home state, which didn\u2019t legally recognize their\nrelationship. With their stable jobs and multiracial family\u2014Mike is a white\npediatrician and Arnold an African American high school teacher\u2014the\nadoption agency they worked with thought they were an ideal family to\nplace biracial twins, whose eighteen-year-old mother had two children\nalready and was living in a battered women\u2019s shelter. They moved for- LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 293\nward with an open adoption, meeting with the birth mother on multiple\noccasions and attending all doctor appointments. When the twins were\nborn, the names that Mike and Arnold gave them appeared on their birth\ncertificates. They spent ten days at home with the twins, but on the tenth\nday\u2014the last day that birth mothers in their state could legally reclaim\ntheir children\u2014at thirty minutes to midnight, the call came.\nMike and Arnold later spoke with staff from their adoption agency,\nwho explained that the birth mother had contacted the biological father\nof the twins, whom she had been estranged from for months, to tell him\nthat she had put them up for adoption to a gay male couple. He did\nnot approve of having a gay couple raise the twins and convinced her\nto reclaim them. Despite the birth mother desperately trying to reverse\nthat decision to reclaim the twins and making several calls to Mike and\nArnold pleading with them to take the children, the adoption was never\nformalized. Arnold had struggled with depression previously, and after\nlosing the twins, he began to abuse drugs and alcohol and was unable\nto return to work. Ultimately, after two years, his addiction led to the\nend of their relationship.\nWhen we spoke, Mike had recently begun the adoption process again\nas a single man. This time, however, he was pursuing the adoption of\nan older child. He said,\n[This adoption is] in the foster system, with parents whose\nparental rights had already been terminated. . . . I don\u2019t want\nthe chance of a birth parent reclaiming again. There\u2019s no way\nI could do that again. . . . It was like they [the twins] had\nsuddenly died. One minute they were here and the next hour\nthey weren\u2019t here. It was horrible.\nYet as many adoptive parents told me, what was sometimes most difficult\nabout their losses was that the child had not died and that their heartache\ncouldn\u2019t be \u201ca pure sense of grief or loss\u201d that one might experience\nmourning the death of a loved one. Rather, the child they had come to\nknow and love was \u201cout there somewhere,\u201d and that knowledge created\nongoing questions and multilayered grief.\nMike\u2019s story is one of multiple interlocking losses and demonstrates\nhow reproductive losses do not always involve the death of a child, nor\nare they centered solely around the absence of that child (or children) in\none\u2019s life. LGBTQ+ adoptive parents, as well as those who experienced\npregnancy loss, infertility, and sterility frequently spoke about the \u201closs\nof innocence\u201d that shattered their initial expectations of linear progress\nsurrounding reproduction. Reproductive losses can also result in the loss\nof dreams for particular kinds of family, as Vero\u2019s story highlights. 294 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nVERO\u2019S STORY\nWhen Vero came out in the late 1970s, she initially thought she didn\u2019t\nwant to have kids. She explained when we connected over Skype, \u201cI\nwaited longer than I should have . . . being gay, being raised in a His-\npanic Catholic family, I didn\u2019t even see it as a reality.\u201d Coming out before\nthe 1990s gayby boom and then leaving home as a teen to serve in the\nU.S. Army for ten years, like many other LGBTQ+ people who grew up\nduring this time, she felt that forming a family would not be an option\nfor her. But as she found a more supportive community, and many of\nher LGBTQ+ friends began having kids, \u201cit started to feel like a reality.\u201d\nAlthough she didn\u2019t initially wish to carry a child, when she desired\nchildren with a long-term partner who was unable to carry, she decided\nto begin monitoring her ovulation. A year and a half later, that relation-\nship had ended.\nBut I kept thinking about it and . . . thinking about it and\ndecided that that was something I really wanted with or with-\nout that relationship. So, I went on with the process. I had a\ndonor. Everything was good to go. . . . And so, I went to get\na physical and during that physical was when they found my\ncancer. And so, it quickly became\u2014I was staged pretty high\nand so that quickly became the focus. Even though it [having\na baby] was sitting in the back of my head, it was more about\ngetting it [the cancer] staged, having biopsies, and starting\ntreatment, blah blah blah. So, all of that kind of consumed\nme. . . . I didn\u2019t have to think about it [losing my ability to\nconceive] right away. But then that came. [Fighting back tears.]\nI still get emotional about it.\nAt the time, Vero\u2019s doctors estimated that the advanced stage of her\ncancer gave her between three months and ten years to live. Although\nwell-meaning friends suggested she consider adoption after initial che-\nmotherapy treatment seemed successful, Vero felt that would not be fair\nto the child because of the uncertainty about her future health. When I\nasked Vero how she did cope once she was able to focus on her expe-\nrience beyond the immediacy of her cancer treatment, she spoke about\nstruggling because, she said, \u201csome people don\u2019t even see my experience\nas a loss, because I never conceived.\u201d She also had complex feelings that\nothers seemed not to understand:\nOnce all of the dust settled [after three years of chemotherapy\nand experimental treatment], I felt very grateful. I mean, if it LGBTQ+ Relationships and Families 295\nhadn\u2019t been for this child that I had already named but that I\nnever had, I wouldn\u2019t even be here. [Through tears.] I think\nwhat helped me find peace in it all was the gratitude that I was\nstill here and in the last sixteen years that my life would have\nbeen completely different. It took a really different turn . . . not\na 180, but at least a 45-degree angle [laughing]. It gave me\nmore time to be with all of my friends\u2019 kids. . . . If I\u2019d waited\nany longer than I did to get my physical, I probably wouldn\u2019t\nhave made it, period. It kind of gave me a different gift. It\nhit me in a bunch of different ways, and it still hits me every\nonce in a while. I was thinking about it just yesterday: that\nkid would probably have been fourteen or fifteen by now, and\nhow different my life would be . . . just completely different.\nVero\u2019s experience underscores not only the depth and complexities of\nlosing one\u2019s dream of family but also how grief can shift and evolve over\ntime. As others have frequently said, \u201cIt never leaves you.\u201d\nTogether, Alex and Nora\u2019s, Mike\u2019s, and Vero\u2019s stories paint a vivid\npicture of the multiple interlocking losses that frequently accompany the\nloss of a child or dreams of a child. LGBTQ+ parents face general social\ntaboos about discussing reproductive loss, but these expectations are fre-\nquently magnified by the legal and political barriers they face in gaining\nrecognition as families. Additionally, they face pressures within LGBTQ+\ncommunities where stories of loss are often silenced in efforts to present\na political vision for LGBTQ+ progress.\nMore inclusive support resources that embrace the diverse realities\nand challenges of forming LGBTQ+ families are necessary for bereaved\nLGBTQ+ individuals and families. A notable finding of my study was\nthat over half the participants faced financial struggles in their efforts\nto expand their families. For most, the urgency to become pregnant or\nadopt again after a loss drove them to invest more (both financially and\nemotionally) in those efforts. Yet many discussed this financial investment\nwith a great deal of ambivalence, for fear that it would detract from the\nemotional loss they experienced. Their stories challenge the assumed\naffluence of LGBTQ+ individuals who seek to expand their families, even\namong those who do so via expensive assisted reproductive technology\nand adoption.\nAs a queer parent who found few resources after my own second-\ntrimester loss and who bore witness to the ways that my partner was fur-\nther isolated as a nongestational parent, I have always given this project a\npublic focus. When I published Reproductive Losses: Challenges to LGBTQ\nFamily-Making, I launched a companion website\u2014http://www.lgbtqrepro-\nductiveloss.org\u2014an interactive and expanding resource for LGBTQ+ indi- 296 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nviduals and families. Readers can access an archive of commemorative\nphotos and stories, as well as advice to LGBTQ+ parents experiencing loss\nand those who support them. But there is far more work to be done to\novercome the silencing and isolation surrounding reproductive loss; create\nopportunities for sustained dialogue among LGBTQ+ intended parents,\nmedical and adoption professionals, and other support professionals; and\nacknowledge that grappling with grief and mourning\u2014particularly in a\nmoment of legal and political uncertainty\u2014is inescapable for many queer\npeople.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 What are some of the negative consequences of homopho-\nbia, heterosexism, and minority stress for LGBTQ+ people in\nterms of relationship building, and creating families?\n\u2022 What myths have you heard regarding the quality of LGBTQ+\nrelationships?

LGBTQ+ teens\nsupporting one another.\n(Unsplash license, Shingi Rice.)\nLGBTQ+ DEMOGRAPHICS\nYouth and adolescents acknowledge their sexual orientation and disclose\nit to others earlier than ever before. Youth initially recognize they are\nattracted to another person of the same gender at about age 10. Esti-\nmates show some understanding their identities as young as 7, with the\naverage age at around 13.4. With increased visibility of LGBTQ+ persons\nin mainstream culture, it is likely these ages are becoming younger.2\nApproximately 2 percent of youth identify as gay or lesbian, 6 per-\ncent as bisexual, 3 percent as not sure of their sexual identity, and 2\u20133\npercent as transgender or gender nonconforming. These labels stay con-\nsistent into early adulthood. Approximately 3 percent of young adults\nages eighteen to twenty-six describe themselves as exclusively or mostly\nhomosexual or bisexual, with more females (3.4 percent) than males\n(2.6 percent) identifying as LGBTQ+. Conservative estimates report 3.5\npercent of adults, or approximately nine million people, in the United\nStates identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.3 314 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nTwo studies have been conducted on the rates of identity disclosure\nto parents of LGBTQ+ youth in the United States. Both studies reported\nmore than half (56 percent and 59 percent) of the LGBTQ+ youth studied\nwere out to their families. Coming out can be challenging for LGBTQ+\nyouth. Many sexual minority youth who have not come out (30 percent)\nreport that the most frequent obstacle to coming out is fear that their\nfamily may not be accepting of them or even that their family has been\nopenly discriminatory. A small proportion (19 percent) state that they are\nnot sure how their families would react, and 10 percent state that they\nare not ready to come out. Some youth, however, resist identity-based\nlabels and perceive disclosing their sexuality as unimportant.4\nTRANSGENDER OR NONBINARY IDENTITY\nDISCLOSURE AND DEMOGRAPHICS\nAs of 2022, an estimated 300,00, or 1.4 percent, of U.S. youth ages\nthirteen to seventeen identify as transgender. Youth in this age group\nwere significantly more likely to identify as transgender than adults age\n65 or older, and constitute 18% of the national transgender-identified\npopulation. The study found that young people identify as transgender\nat different rates in different states; estimates ranged from 3.0% in New\nYork to 0.6% in Wyoming. The study also found that White people were\nless likely to identify as transgender than Latinx people, American Indian\nor Alaska Native, and biracial/multiracial groups.5\nA 2018 report by the Human Rights Campaign found only 21 percent\nof transgender and gender-expansive youth to be out to their parents,\nand 33 percent of youth were considering whom to disclose to in their\nfamily and how to manage these relationships after disclosure (figure\n9.2). In 2018, nearly half (41 percent) of all transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth had at least one parent to whom they have come out.\nResearch suggests concern over family response is a barrier to coming\nout. Although both mothers and fathers were anticipated by their child\nto act negatively to a disclosure at least half the time, fathers are more\nlikely to respond negatively than mothers (63 percent vs. 54 percent).6\nResearch has found that youth begin to understand the concept of\ngender identity as early as ages one and two. In these earlier stages,\nyouth start to internalize the physical differences (penis, vulva, breasts)\nbetween genders. At these ages, children do not necessarily have a full\ngrasp of their own identity or what it means to identify as a certain\ngender, but they begin to understand what those parts of a body symbol-\nize. By age three, children can label their own gender, and by four they Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 315\nFigure 9.2. A sign carried\nat the eighth Pride Parade\nin Belgrade, Serbia, on\nSeptember 15, 2019.\n(CC-BY-SA Bojan\nCvetanovic\u00b4.)\nfeel quite certain about their gender identity. All children during these\nyears before puberty explore their gender presentation and expression\nand experiment with toys typical to their gender or of the \u201copposite\u201d\ngender. By the time youth reach five to six years of age, they adopt rules\nabout what it means to be a certain gender and what will be accepted by\nothers. By age seven, youth feel a sense of gender constancy and may\nbegin fantasizing about being another gender or having different physical\ncharacteristics to align with their identity.7\nGender-nonconforming youth may then try to reconcile the differ-\nences between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity by\nmaking subtle changes to their dress and social appearance. They may\nalter styles, wearing more masculine or feminine clothing, and use differ-\nent names or pronouns. Allowing youth to socially transition, or begin to\nlive according to their true gender identity, can have very positive effects.\nIt can reduce their distress and dysphoria, and it can reduce the likelihood\nof developing depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation\nand attempts, self-harm, isolation, homelessness, and incarceration.8\nRead\nIn 2013, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 1,197 LGBTQ+\nadults about their perceptions of society\u2019s acceptance of LGBTQ+ issues\nand about their experiences of prejudice and discrimination. The study\nfocuses on lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, but it also contains\nimportant information on transgender Americans and LGBTQ+ people\nof color.

Family support is also a\nprotective factor against negative health outcomes in early adulthood,\nsuch as depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.

Trans youth have\nalso reported long-lasting positive effects from family support; 72 percent\nof trans youth with parental support reported being more satisfied with\ntheir lives than those without (33 percent). These same youth reported\nmore consistent (70 percent) positive mental health outcomes than those\nwhose parents were not supportive (15 percent).9\nFamily Rejection\nA majority of research on LGBTQ+ youth and their families, however,\nhas emphasized the negative outcomes of family rejection. Rejection is\nassociated with higher levels of emotional distress, suicidal ideation, and\nsuicide attempts. In fact, LGBTQ+ youth whose parents were frequently\nrejecting during adolescence reported a rate of suicide attempts that was\nmore than eight times that of those with accepting parents. Research\nalso suggests the adolescent and young adult LGBTQ+ community expe-\nriences increased homelessness as a result of family rejection, particularly\nfor youth of color. Upon disclosure of sexual orientation, some parents\ndecide to eject their children from the house, forcing them to live with\nother family members, in friends\u2019 homes, in foster care, in homeless\nshelters, or on the streets. Of the two million homeless youth in 2014 in\nthe United States, 20\u201340 percent identify as LGBTQ+. Homeless LGBTQ+\nyouth may suffer even more negative health outcomes than those not\ndisplaced from home.10\nPFLAG\nPFLAG is a national organization begun in 1973 by Jeanne Manford to\nPFLAG\nsupport parents and loved ones of LGBTQ+ people.

Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 319\nHISTORY OF LGBTQ+ INCLUSIVITY\nIN EDUCATION\nIn 1984, Project 10, the first support group for LGBTQ+ students in a\nformal educational system, was started in a Los Angeles high school\nby Virginia Uribe, a teacher and counselor. Uribe experienced significant\nbacklash from community members. Project 10\u2019s mission was to create\nsupportive, welcoming, and safe campuses for sexual minority youth. It\nhelped establish the first safe zones and developed training for schools\non implementing policy changes to protect youth. Similar efforts began on\nthe East Coast several years later. GLSEN, formerly the Gay, Lesbian, and\nStraight Education Network, was founded in 1990 by a group of teachers\nin Massachusetts with a passion for improving the quality of education\nfor LGBTQ+ youth. GLSEN has become a leading national organization\nfor ensuring safe and affirming educational systems for LGBTQ+ youth.\nAlso during the 1990s, the first gay-straight alliance (GSA) was estab-\nlished in Salt Lake City, Utah. Despite resistance that continues today\nfrom the community, administration, and parents, the Salt Lake City GSA\npersevered, and schools all across the nation slowly began implementing\nsimilar support efforts. As of 2015, nearly 60 percent of students reported\nhaving GSAs at their school.12\nGLSEN has been conducting the National School Climate Survey\nevery year since 2001, and LGBTQ+ content and resources in schools\nhave been gradually increasing every year. Out of almost eighteen thou-\nsand LGBTQ+ students sampled by GLSEN\u2019s 2019 National School Climate\nSurvey, about 20 percent reported positive inclusion of LGBTQ+ issues in\ncurricula, most (61.6%) reported that their school had a Gay-Straight Alli-\nance, Gender-Sexuality Alliance (GSA), or Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA)\nor similar club, and 48.9% percent reported access to library materials\nwith information on LGBTQ+ issues (figure 9.5).13\nState legislation shapes the experience of students in schools.\nAccording to a comprehensive survey published in the Columbia Law\nReview, twenty states maintain statutes that \u201cprohibit or restrict the dis-\ncussion of homosexuality in public schools.\u201d Some laws prohibit teachers\nfrom \u201cpromoting\u201d homosexuality or suggesting that there are safe ways\nto practice homosexual sex. Others demand that teachers disseminate\nmisinformation, such as \u201chomosexual conduct is a criminal offense\u201d\nand \u201chomosexual activity [is] primarily responsible for contact with the\nAIDS virus.\u201d This argument has been present in sex education since the\n1980s. Policies such as these promote peer discrimination, harassment,\nand assault of LGBTQ+ youth.14 320 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 9.5. LGBTQ+\nresources in a school\nlibrary. (CC-BY\nCollege Library.)\nSEX EDUCATION\nSince the 1980s, sexual health education has focused on an absti-\nnence-based, or abstinence-only until marriage, approach. This approach\nto sex education promotes sex as an act that occurs between two het-\nerosexual cisgender persons after getting married. Further, same-sex\nattraction is feared and gender stereotypes are reinforced. Public health\norganizations and most parents agree that sex education should include\ndiscussions of LGBTQ+ identities. Eight-five percent of parents of high\nschoolers reported wanting sexual orientation discussed in sex education,\nand 78 percent of middle school parents wanted sexual orientation dis-\ncussed in sex education.15\nIn reality, less than 4 percent of LGBTQ+ youth reported any men-\ntion of sexual or gender orientation in their health classes, and only 12\npercent were told about same-gender relationships. The routine omission Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 321\nof LGBTQ+ issues from sex education curricula constitutes a violation of\nadolescent human rights.16 It is a violation because it \u201crobs youth of sex-\nual agency by withholding information that is critical to health and well-\nbeing.\u201d17 Whether habitual or deliberate, the omission of LGBTQ+ topics\nfrom health curricula implies that sexual and gender fluidity are not part\nof the natural biological order and are by default unnatural or perverse.18\nWhen discussions of LGBTQ+ issues do appear in health text-\nbooks, the language clearly shifts toward LGBTQ+ persons as the Other\nand makes it seem as though the sexual experiences of LGBTQ+ youth\nare vastly different from those of heterosexual and cisgender youth.19\nAlthough LGBTQ+ youth do have some differences in sexual experiences,\nincluding information tailored to their needs can help reduce the risk of\nsexually transmitted infections. Sex education that affirms LGBTQ+ youth\ndelays the age of first sexual intercourse and reduces\n\u2022 unintended teen pregnancy;\n\u2022 rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections;\n\u2022 overall number of sexual partners; and\n\u2022 unprotected sex while increasing condom and contraception\nuse.20\nNEUTRAL AND NEGATIVE SCHOOLS\nAs of 2020, only seventeen states and the District of Columbia had laws\nspecifically addressing the discrimination, harassment, and bullying of\nstudents based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Lack of leg-\nislation means interpretation of policies is variable and leaves policy\ndevelopment up to individual districts and schools. Students in schools\nwithout policies are at a greater likelihood of experiencing discriminatory\npractices and are more likely to fear discrimination and bullying in the\nfuture. Even more troubling for LGBTQ+ students, five states (Alabama,\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) prohibit presenting any\ncontent on LGBTQ+ issues.21\nHeteronormative socialization becomes more intense as youth age,\nand earlier exposure to discrimination has been shown to increase the\nlikelihood of victimization for LGBTQ+ youth.22 A 2015 analysis of the\nYouth Behavior Risk Surveillance Survey found high rates of peer bul-\nlying behavior toward LGBTQ+ youth. Of LGBTQ+ students experiencing\ndiscriminatory behaviors, 322 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 10 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon on\nschool property;\n\u2022 34 percent were bullied on school property;\n\u2022 28 percent were bullied electronically through social media\nor other sites;\n\u2022 23 percent experienced sexual dating violence in the prior\nyear;\n\u2022 18 percent experienced physical dating violence; and\n\u2022 18 percent were raped at some point in their lives.23\nA study of transgender youth found even higher rates of discrimi-\nnation and violence in several areas:\n\u2022 25 percent experienced physical bullying;\n\u2022 52 percent experienced dating bullying;\n\u2022 35 percent experienced bullying specifically due to gender;\nand\n\u2022 47 percent experienced bullying specifically due to gender\nexpression.24\nSchool bullying has long-term effects on the mental health and quality of\nlife of LGBTQ+ students. Bullying has been shown to be associated with\nincreased depression, anxiety, and suicidality and decreased self-esteem.\nBullying can also affect school outcomes by increasing negative attitudes\ntoward school, truancy, and disciplinary problems while lowering GPAs\nand decreasing interest in pursuing further education (figure 9.6).25\nEducators confirm witnessing discriminatory and violent behav-\nior toward LGBTQ+ students in schools, even as early as elementary\nschool. An alarming 70 percent of LGBTQ+ youth heard antigay speech\nat school (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s so gay, gay; you\u2019re so gay\u201d), 60 percent heard\nanother type of homophobic remark (e.g., \u201cfag\u201d or \u201cdyke\u201d), and 56 per-\ncent heard homophobic remarks from their teachers. Additionally, youth\nheard comments about gender expression from peers at least 60 percent\nof the time and from teachers and school staff 71 percent of the time.\nMany of these behaviors go unnoticed and undocumented. In fact, some\neducators (between 31 and 42 percent) fail to recognize harassment by\nother students, such as the use of the word \u201cfag\u201d or the phrase \u201cthat\u2019s\nso gay,\u201d and do not intervene appropriately when it arises. Forty-seven Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 323\nFigure 9.6.

Bullying isn\u2019t exclusive\nto fellow students in schools. Forty-four percent of educators reported\nhearing other school staff make derogatory comments about or toward\nLGBTQ+ students, with the highest prevalence of educator bullying and\nharassment occurring in middle school.26\nExplore\nGLSEN\u2019s policy maps (https://maps.glsen.org) provide a comprehensive\noverview of state laws that affirm nondiscrimination or protect transgender,\nnonbinary, and gender-nonconforming students.\n\u2022 Find the state where you live or where you grew up on each\nof the maps; what kinds of protections does this state offer\nfor kindergarten through grade twelve students?\n\u2022 What are the differences between how states treat sexual\norientation and gender identity?

This\nEDUCATION\nincludes harassment\nand discrimination for\nLaws in some states enforce inclusivity of LGBTQ+ issues across the\nfailing to conform to\ngender expectations and curriculum. California, for instance, has implemented new legislation sup-\nis interpreted to often porting inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes in the classroom. The Fair, Accurate,\ninclude LGBTQ+ persons. Inclusive, and Respectful (FAIR) Education Act was enacted in early 2012.\nIt mandates an inclusive and nondiscriminatory curriculum, including\nLGBTQ+ historical events (such as the Stonewall rebellion). The act was\npassed to curb LGBTQ+ suicides and alleviate bullying.28\nOther states shortly followed suit. New York and Washington adopted\nmore inclusive laws for their school districts that took effect July 2012.29\nThe Dignity for All Students Act requires public school boards in both\nstates to include language regarding sexual orientation and gender\nexpression in their curricula and school policies. A similar law passed in\nearly 2019 requires all New Jersey schools to teach LGBTQ+ history and\nachievements across the curriculum.\nAn additional level of protection exists for transgender students that\nis based on federal law. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\nprohibits schools from disclosing a student\u2019s transgender status. Addi-\ntionally, the law allows youth to amend school records if information is Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 325\n\u201cinaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student\u2019s rights of privacy,\u201d\nwhich enables students to change their name and gender marker on their\ntranscripts.30 The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and\nHuman Services can investigate complaints made by students and par-\nents. In cases of discrimination, the Department of Education can sue the\nschool district and deny federal funding.31\nSUPPORTIVE SCHOOLS\nOver the last several decades, with sociocultural changes across the\nUnited States toward greater LGBTQ+ acceptance, schools have increas-\ningly become more positive spaces for youth, some more than others.\nPositive schools typically have several key assets, including an envi-\nronment where youth interact with caring and accepting educators and\nstaff. Other assets include supportive school groups, inclusive curricula,\nand comprehensive policies to reduce school harassment and bullying.\nSupportive schools make it a standard policy for all youth to be more\naccepting and inclusive of LGBTQ+ students and are less likely to tolerate\ndiscriminatory and violent behavior between students. LBGTQ+ students\nin more supportive environments are less likely to have depression and\nsuicidal ideation, use drugs, and be truant.32\nTHE ROLE OF EDUCATORS AND OTHER\nSUPPORT STAFF\nEducators play an integral role in healthy youth development and increase\nfeelings of safety for LGBTQ+ students. When cisgender and heterosex-\nual teachers become allies of LGBTQ+ students and advocate for and\nsupport them, these students increase their academic achievement and\ntheir quality of life. Some educators even advance their allyship fur-\nther and mentor students, sponsor LGBTQ+ student organizations, con-\nnect LGBTQ+ students to community resources, and openly advocate for\ninclusion despite consequences imposed by employers (e.g., probation\nor loss of employment). Studies on transgender youth have found that\nwhen school staff are more supportive, trans youth feel safer because the\nteachers are more likely to stop harassment when they see it. Including\nmaterial on LGBTQ+ lives in course content, such as sex education, can\nhave a large impact on the mental and emotional well-being of LGBTQ+\nyouth.33 326 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nWatch\nVirginia Uribe, a retired teacher and counselor in the Los Angeles Unified\nSchool District, started Project 10, the first LGBTQ+ support program for\nstudents. On a 2015 episode of the MSNBC web series Fearless (https://\nyoutu.be/-QFEL5rh4UQ), she describes the obstacles she faced when she\nfounded the program in 1984 and some of the lessons she learned. Uribe\nhas earned numerous awards for her work on behalf of LGBTQ+ youth.\n\u2022 Why was Project 10 such an important organization?\n\u2022 Who were her early allies and advocates, and who was unable\nto support the project\u2014or even attacked it? Why?\n\u2022 What can we learn from comparing the environment that\nUribe worked in during the late 1980s and early 1990s with\nthe environment for LGBTQ+ youth now?\nLGBTQ+ CLUBS\nLGBTQ+ clubs, originally known as gay-straight alliances, are school-\ngay-straight alliances\nbased organizations that enhance the school community for LGBTQ+\nSchool-based\nyouth and their allies and are often advised by an allied or self-iden-\norganizations of LGBTQ+\ntifying teacher at the school. LGBTQ+ clubs promote advocacy, encour-\nyouth and allies who\nage youth leadership, and allow youths to socialize in a supportive and\nmeet to support LGBTQ+\nnondiscriminatory environment. Developed in Massachusetts during the\nstudents. This can involve\n1980s, LGBTQ+ clubs originally focused on the needs of sexual minority\nadvocacy and activism,\nas well as a social youth. National organizations, such as the GSA Network and GLSEN, and\ncomponent. several state-focused organizations were influential in spreading LGBTQ+\nclubs to more schools across the United States (figure 9.8). More recently,\nwith the increasing emphasis on the needs of transgender youth, groups\nhave been adjusting their focus to include the needs and rights of gen-\nder minority students in their missions. Some groups, for example, have\naltered their names to Gender-Sexuality Alliance or even Queer Student\nAlliance to encompass a broad spectrum of identities.34\nHaving LGBTQ+ clubs in school is one of the largest protective fac-\ntors for LGBTQ+ youth. Research on victimization, drug use, and men-\ntal health found reduced instances of victimization and harassment and\nincreased feelings of support and connectivity, leading to reductions in\nanxiety and depression. Students felt more connected, empowered, and\nsupported by their schools and other adults, and they were less inclined\nto feel marginalized and victimized by peers and school-based adults.35 Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 327\nFigure 9.8. Gay-straight\nalliances save lives. Rally in\nsupport of Bill 24 in Calgary,\nCanada, on November 12,\n2017. (CC-BY JmacPherson.)\nWhereas most LGBTQ+ clubs are embraced and supported in schools,\nsome receive pushback from the administration, community, school\nboards, and parents fearing the club may encourage homosexuality. In\nthe most extreme cases, some opponents have gone as far as banning all\nschool clubs. Unfortunately, resistance occurs most often in school dis-\ntricts where LGBTQ+ students need these services the most. For example,\nin 2003, in an effort to eliminate controversy after approving a LGBTQ+\nstudent group at a high school in Boyd County, Kentucky, a principal\nbanned all noncurricular clubs at the school for the remainder of the\nyear.36\nBATHROOMS AND LOCKER ROOMS\nBeginning in the 2010s, controversy about the use of bathrooms and\nlocker rooms for gender minority youth increased. As of 2016, over half\nthe states in the United States were suing over the rights of transgender\nstudents to use the bathroom aligned with their gender. LGBTQ+ youth\nperceive bathrooms as the most unsafe spaces within their school build-\ning. Although not all schools can undergo a full renovation to include a\nnew gender-neutral restroom, schools can take a current restroom and\nrelabel it as gender neutral for all students to use (see an example in\nfigure 9.9). Gender-neutral or single-stall bathrooms increase the sense 328 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 9.9. A\nbathroom for all\ngenders\nand abilities.\n(CC-BY-SA\nJeffrey Beall.)\nof security of LGBTQ+ youth. They provide a safe space for youth to\nuse the restroom without having to choose between which bathroom to\nuse or anticipate the negative backlash if someone who is unaccepting is\ninside. Unfortunately, gender minority youth are often the main advocates\nfor bathrooms accommodating the needs of transgender persons. Having\nother supportive systems in place, such as educators who are accepting\nor LGBTQ+ clubs, often encourages gender minority youth to speak up\nand advocate for their needs.37\nPhysical education courses are particularly difficult aspects of school\nfor LGBTQ+ students. A study found that more than half of LGBTQ+\nyouth had been assaulted or harassed in physical education classes at\nleast once because of their sexual orientation (52.8 percent) or gender\nexpression (50.9 percent). Often this mistreatment is due to gender social-\nization about how masculine or feminine one should be and can often\nlead to difficulties for gender minority youth when using locker rooms\nand other facilities aligned with their gender identity.38\nContrary to media presentations about the danger from transgender\npeople using bathrooms aligned with their gender, it is gender minority\nyouth who are at significantly greater risk for experiencing trauma and Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 329\nviolence in these public spaces. Eleven percent of LGBTQ+ youth never\nfeel safe in a locker room, with discomfort steeply increasing for trans-\ngender and nonbinary youth in these spaces. Forty-one percent of trans-\ngender boys, 34 percent of transgender girls, and 31 percent of nonbinary\nyouth never feel safe in locker rooms. Slightly more than half (51 percent)\nof transgender youth have never used the locker room aligned with their\ngender identity, instead either using the locker room aligned with their\nsex assigned at birth or not participating in physical education activi-\nties. A national study conducted by the Human Rights Campaign found\nthat one-third of all LGBTQ+ students do not attend physical education\ncourses, 39 percent avoid locker rooms, and 23 percent avoid all school\nathletic facilities and fields, all of which can lead to further isolation and\nostracization.39\nCHALLENGES OF EDUCATORS\nEducators face several challenges when addressing the needs of LGBTQ+\nstudents. A study found that diversity courses for preservice teachers,\nschool counselors, and school psychologists covered race, class, and (dis)\nability but failed to mention the needs of LGBTQ+ students. Ultimately,\nthis leads to educators feeling unprepared to work with LGBTQ+ students,\nbeing unable to adjust their interactions, and wondering how to advocate\nfor students on these issues. Even after getting licensed, many education\nprofessionals are not able to access comprehensive professional develop-\nment opportunities and training, despite their interest. Many professionals\nhave to find the appropriate resources for themselves.40\nCommunity opposition can also significantly influence educators\u2019\nwillingness to support youth. Despite personal acceptance of LGBTQ+\nyouth, some educators are reluctant to indicate their support of LGBTQ+\nstudents out of fear of negative parental response, administrative back-\nlash, and possible loss of employment. In particularly conservative areas,\nand in religiously affiliated schools, teachers may not have permission\nfrom the administration to demonstrate their support. Evaluations of\nteacher-candidate training found that, despite research stating the impor-\ntance of inclusion and school safety for LGBTQ+ students, many teachers\nwould be unwilling to advocate for the needs of LGBTQ+ students or\nwere unwilling to discuss sexual and gender minority identities publicly\nin the classroom. Although the culture of schools has been improving,\nschools still remain politically and religiously charged institutions and a\nbattleground for the rights of LGBTQ+ students.41 330 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nCONCLUSION\nLGBTQ+ youth have several means of support and affirmation that can\nlead to positive health outcomes into their adulthood. Childhood through\nadolescence is a critical stage of development for all youth, but for LGBTQ+\nyouth the failure of any one support system (family, school, peers, sports,\netc.) can have lifelong consequences. With national trends across all youth\nsystems moving toward greater levels of acceptance and with the power\nof resilience, LGBTQ+ youth are equipped now more than ever to have\npositive and productive lives. All adults can be advocates for the rights\nand needs of LGBTQ+ youth.\nPROFILE: LGBTQ+ INCLUSION IN\nPREK-12 TEACHING AND LEARNING\nSabia Prescott\nHistorically, prekindergarten\u2013twelfth-grade schools in the United States\nhave not been designed to serve students of gender or sexual minori-\nties. From laws regulating bathrooms and sports to severe restrictions on\ninstruction, policies in many states do not support LGBTQ+ students or\nteachers. According to a 2019 national survey of LGBTQ+ students from\nGLSEN, these barriers often translate to lower educational outcomes and\ngraduation rates and to higher rates of anxiety and depression among\nLGBTQ+ youth.42\nWhen polled in the GLSEN survey, only one in five LGBTQ+ students\nreported that they were taught positive representations of LGBTQ+ people,\nhistory, or events in their classes. Well more than half (67 percent) of\nstudents reported that they did not have access to information about top-\nics related to LGBTQ+ issues in their school library, through the internet\non school computers, or in their textbooks or other assigned readings.\nAt the same time, less than half of students (42 percent) said their\nadministration was supportive of LGBTQ+ students, and 48 percent said\nthey would be somewhat or very uncomfortable talking with a teacher.\nBecause the National Center for Education Statistics does not report on\ngender and sexuality in schools, self-reported data from the GLSEN sur-\nvey is the most robust information available.\nCompounding general trends, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened\nmental health of LGBTQ+ students and seen a drastic rise in politicization\nof inclusive education efforts. A record amount of legislation has been\nintroduced in states across the country that would prohibit or severely\nlimit representation and discussions of LGBTQ+ identities in kindergar- Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 331\nten\u2013twelfth-grade curricula and classrooms. In a majority of U.S. states,\nbills have been proposed that aim to restrict discussions of LGBTQ+\npeople and their history or create privacy policies that would jeopardize\nqueer students\u2019 well-being, such as in Florida, Georgia, and Texas.43\nAt the same time, a handful of states maintain affirmative laws,\nrequiring kindergarten\u2013twelfth-grade curricula to include accurate LGBTQ+\nhistory. By the end of 2019, four states\u2014California, New Jersey, Colorado,\nand Illinois\u2014had mandates requiring LGBTQ+ inclusion in prekindergar-\nten\u2013twelfth-grade curricula. The state legislature in New York has recently\nmoved in the same direction. On the opposite end of the spectrum, five\nstates\u2014Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Louisiana\u2014\nmaintain education laws forbidding teachers from portraying LGBTQ+\npeople or identities in a positive light, if at all. These laws, known as\n\u201cno promo homo\u201d laws, act in stark contrast with the states working\ntoward statutorily mandated inclusion. Teachers in states with \u201cno promo\nhomo\u201d laws may still work toward engaging and supporting their queer\nand trans students, but their work necessarily looks different from that\nin states with supportive legislation.44\nStories of this harmful legislation have recently dominated head-\nlines, but LGBTQ+ inclusion is happening and not only at the state level.\nJust a few years ago, a majority of education leaders were not thinking\nor talking about queer and trans students. Today, in part because of the\nsteep politicization, school leaders, parents, librarians, media specialists,\nand more, have taken up the public fight for LGBTQ+ inclusion. Districts\nin states with restrictive laws are fighting these laws at the local level,\nthrough school board elections, local advocacy groups, and even may-\noral races. If resistance toward LGBTQ+ inclusion is becoming louder, so\ntoo is support from allies, educators, and students. Though these laws\naffect what educators can and can\u2019t teach, teachers can do many things\nto facilitate inclusive learning in a variety of political and social set-\ntings. The remainder of this profile explores how inclusive teaching and\nlearning look in practice and what barriers exist for teachers doing this\nwork.\nINCLUSIVE STUDENT LEARNING\nInclusion as an approach, although crucial, presents a unique challenge\nfor queer students. To create an inclusive classroom that meets the needs\nof all students, schools must be able to identify and quantify those stu-\ndents\u2019 needs. To do that, those students must be visible. If schools can\u2019t\nidentify the students they\u2019re trying to serve, they likely can\u2019t identify the\nsupports they need. But queer students are often not public about the 332 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nprocess of coming to terms with their identities, especially at a young age.\nWhat\u2019s more, they exist across all other human demographics and there-\nfore can\u2019t be lumped together under one group that looks or sounds the\nsame. Because of difficulties in data collection of LGBTQ+ folks\u2014including\nsafety concerns when self-reporting, changing identities, and institutional\nbias\u2014many queer students are unaccounted for in student data.\nFor these reasons, much of the existing data on LGBTQ+ students,\nsuch as GLSEN\u2019s, are self-reported. Its survey of twenty-three thousand\nstudents ages thirteen to twenty-one found that 95 percent of students\nreported hearing discriminatory remarks frequently at school, 63 percent\nreported hearing those remarks from teachers or staff, and 17 percent of\nstudents were prohibited from discussing or writing about LGBTQ+ topics\nin school assignments.45 Students are not only, then, told the challenges\nqueer people face are invalid but hear this message from the school pol-\nicies that govern them, the teachers who educate them, and the material\nthey\u2019re taught.\nRecognizing the power of inclusive learning materials to address\nthis problem, some states are exploring solutions through gender-inclu-\nsive history and social science curricula. Gender inclusive, in this sense,\nbroadly describes curricula and other learning materials that teach about\nthe lived experiences of a wide range of LGBTQ+ people and identities.\nThis can be content focused specifically on LGBTQ+ people and identities\nor content not focused on them, such as biology and English language\narts. For example, an inclusive biology class might use nongendered\nlanguage or examine the assumptions that we make when classifying\ngenetic phenomena into categories such as natural and unnatural. A\nbiology course that goes beyond simple inclusion to affirming and validat-\ning might explore the bias behind what are often regarded as objective,\nscientific discoveries, a bias that shapes the ways we conceptualize DNA\nand genetic makeup. A common misconception about queer and trans\ninclusion is that it is reserved for only certain academic areas and not\nothers. In reality, every subject, topic, and conversation can be made\ninclusive and affirming. Indeed, all subject matter is shaped by gender\nand sexuality biases, regardless of whether we are aware of it.\nWhen California passed its inclusive history\u2013social science frame-\nwork in 2016, it was the first state to make an attempt to guide creation\nof textbooks that cover LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities. The\nvote came five years after the state\u2019s passage of the FAIR Education Act,\nin 2011, and textbooks using the framework were implemented for the\nfirst time during the 2019\u20132020 school year. Not only was the publishing\nprocess arduous, but the content creation itself required multiple com-\nmittees of history experts, educators, and advocates to debate the exact Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 333\ncontent and wording that ultimately went to a vote. The resulting content\nis groundbreakingly comprehensive and now published in textbooks used\nthroughout the state. Unfortunately, the materials in California are pro-\nprietary and therefore not available to other states looking to implement\na similar curriculum.\nTo be inclusive of gender and sexual minorities, student-facing mate-\nrials must incorporate LGBTQ+ characters, identities, and histories. They\nshould present accurate and impartial information to students about not\nonly what queer and transgender identities are but how they determine\nprivilege and oppression, in addition to describing the implicit biases that\nhelp sustain this oppression. Inclusive content can be specifically about\nLGBTQ+ people or not, but it always includes queer and gender-diverse\nexamples, names, stories, and images.\nTeachers and school administrators can take specific steps to inten-\ntionally create more inclusive learning environments. As more states move\ntoward inclusive curricula, the need for comparable educator support is\ngrowing rapidly. Three of the biggest challenges to inclusion in schools is\npreparing teachers to teach inclusive content and create inclusive learning\nenvironments, providing them the resources to do so, and supporting\nthem in these efforts.\nINCLUSIVE TEACHING PRACTICES\nIn recent years there has been a growing push among prekindergarten\u2013\ntwelfth-grade educators toward culturally responsive teaching, or teach-\ning that recognizes students\u2019 particular strengths in the classroom and\nleverages them to make learning experiences more relevant and effective.\nCountering the notion that teachers should cover only what is in the\nassigned texts regardless of students or context, culturally responsive\nteaching explores narratives beyond those that have historically been\ntold in textbooks. Not to be confused with the current battle over what\nhas been dubbed critical race theory, cultural responsiveness aims to\noffer a variety of perspectives, experiences, and lenses to students for\nunderstanding content.\nWith the push toward culturally responsive teaching has come a\nwider understanding of the value of representation among educators, in\nthe classroom and in the curriculum, as well as a growing popularity\nof the concept of windows and mirrors. Rudine Sims Bishop, professor\nemerita of education at the Ohio State University, first developed this\nidea in 1990.46 She suggested that curricula should offer students both\na window to lives and experiences different from theirs and a mirror so\nthey can see themselves reflected in the material. The latter is particularly 334 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nimportant for students who belong to one or more minority groups: by\nno coincidence, students of color, those with disabilities, and LGBTQ+\nstudents seldom see themselves reflected or represented in prekindergar-\nten\u2013twelfth-grade curricula.\nThe growing support for cultural competence and representation is\nsituated between this single-narrative paradigm\u2014in which existing curric-\nula teach through the lens of only one identity\u2014and current knowledge of\nwhat it takes for students to succeed. We know that students must feel\na sense of safety, respect, and belonging in schools in order to learn. We\nknow validation from teachers and space for students to develop inquiry\ninto their own identities are critical to their social-emotional development.\nAnd yet many schools are falling short of meeting these needs, either by\nfailing to address them or by addressing basic safety instead of pedagogy,\nrather than both.\nThe Northwestern University professor Sally Nuamah argues in her\nbook How Girls Achieve that educating young girls takes more than\nsimply forging paths in schools that are not designed for them. Rather,\nit takes active and intentional unteaching of harmful lessons ingrained\nin them long before they ever arrived in the classroom. It takes teach-\ning specific skills\u2014such as strategy and transgression\u2014to prepare them\nto navigate a world that relies on their lack of these skills. This idea\nshould also be applied to teaching and learning for LGBTQ+ students.\nQueer students as a group face similar challenges in regard to the lack of\nrepresentation they see in curricula and the unconscious bias with which\nthey are often taught. Teaching and engaging them requires teachers and\nschool leaders alike to actively unlearn tired stereotypes and interrogate\ntheir own understanding of what is normal and given.47\nThe term inclusive learning environments has grown more popular\nin recent years alongside the push for LGBTQ+ acceptance in schools\nand the movement toward culturally responsive teaching. Inclusive, in\nthis sense, refers to classrooms or other learning environments in which\neducators, librarians, and school staff recognize their own privilege as\nstarting points for difficult conversations. It also requires that educators\nbe willing and prepared to use affirming language and that they support\na variety of narratives that challenge students to open lines of inquiry\ninto cultural assumptions.\nWhen it comes to queer and trans students specifically, an inclusive\nlearning environment is one in which educators take steps to understand\nstraight and cisgender privilege, how it overlaps with other types of priv-\nilege, and what dynamic it creates in a classroom. It is one in which\neducators are open to learning about different identities, so they have\ncontext and language to talk about them. It is also one in which educators Education and LGBTQ+ Youth 335\nhave the time, space, and school support to understand LGBTQ+ history,\nat least at a basic level, and how it informs current understandings of\nqueer identities.\nAlthough this all might sound like a heavy load to put on teachers\nwho are already notoriously short on time and resources, the barrier of\nentry to inclusion work is low. For example, educators can start by making\nsmall but intentional changes to the way they address groups of students,\nby using gender-neutral phrases such as \u201cfolks,\u201d \u201ceveryone,\u201d or \u201cy\u2019all\u201d\ninstead of \u201cboys and girls,\u201d \u201cladies and gentlemen,\u201d or \u201cyou guys.\u201d This\ntype of change is minimal but meaningful, and it signals to students who\ndo not identify as male or female or are questioning their gender identity\nthat they belong. It also models and normalizes inclusive language for all\nstudents, regardless of identity. For smaller content changes such as this,\nhaving editable materials, rather than textbooks, can be especially useful.\nInclusive professional learning materials are those that prepare edu-\ncators to create learning environments in which inclusion is normal and\nexpected. Such resources could be texts on relevant and contextual queer\nhistory, an explanation of some of the challenges that queer and trans\npeople face more broadly, or simply information on language, pronouns,\nand why they matter. Ideally, these resources recognize nuance and diver-\nsity within queer communities and engage teachers around intentionally\nanti-racist queer inclusion. For early and elementary educators, this might\nbe resources that explain the importance of including Black and brown\nsame-sex families in a lesson on family trees. For secondary teachers, it\nmight be adding to the class library foundational writings by Black and\nbrown authors, such as Audre Lorde or Gloria Anzald\u00faa. Exposure to a\ndiversity of queer ideas and narratives is critical for students, those who\nmay see themselves represented in these stories and those who do not,\nto disrupt the single-story narrative.\nSUMMARY\nThe disproportionate educational outcomes that LGBTQ+ students face are\nthe result of many compounding factors, such as a lack of representation\nand support in school, politicization of their existence, and systemic bias.\nInclusive materials remain a critical part of the effort to address these\nchallenges and are the focus of an increasing number of efforts. Although\nteaching and learning are intrinsically tied, it is important to recognize\nthe different needs between student- and teacher-facing materials. Insti-\ntuting inclusive curriculum laws and policies calls for inclusive profes-\nsional learning, because if teachers are not adequately prepared, inclusive\ncontent will do very little to create more inclusive learning environments. 336 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 What does research tell us about the process of coming out\nin terms of both gender and sexual identity?\n\u2022 What is the range of responses to LGBTQ+ youth if they\nchoose to disclose their gender or sexuality identities to fami-\nly members?

(1988), Penny\nMarshall\u2019s A League of Their Own, and David Fincher\u2019s Fight Club (1999)\nhave in common? According to film news website IndieWire, they\u2019re all\nqueer among \u201cthe best queer films you didn\u2019t know were queer.\u201d1 The IndieWire\nPertaining to a person or reviewer reads homoerotic valences in Fight Club\u2019s plot, which revolves\ngroup that does not fall around illicit male-male contact shrouded in secrecy. But if homosexuality\nwithin the gender binary never crosses the viewer\u2019s mind, is the film still queer? The question of\nof heterosexuality. what counts as LGBTQ+ film and media is anything but straightforward.\n350 Screening LGBTQ+ 351\nMany have debated what makes a gay film gay, a queer film queer, and\nso on. Must the plot revolve around someone\u2019s emergent sexuality, as\nin Todd Haynes\u2019s Carol (2015) or Donna Deitch\u2019s Desert Hearts (1985)?\nDoes an LGBTQ+ character suffice? How do we know a character\u2019s sex-\nuality unless it is explicitly stated? Must we assume all film characters\nare straight until proved queer? What about Charles Herman-Wurmfeld\u2019s\nKissing Jessica Stein (2001), in which the title character dates a woman\nand comes out before finally finding the right man? Are films made by\nqueer-identified directors intrinsically queer?\nA range of scholars have explored these questions. In a book on the\nearly lesbian filmmaker Dorothy Arzner, for example, Judith Mayne writes\nthat, though Arzner\u2019s films contain no overtly lesbian characters or plots,\nthey devote \u201cconstant and deliberate attention to how women dress and\nact and perform, as much for each other as for the male figures.\u201d2 Alex-\nander Doty, meanwhile, suggests that in many popular texts, queerness\nis \u201cless an essential, waiting-to-be-discovered property than the result\nof acts of production or reception. This does not mean the queerness\none attributes to mass culture texts is any less real than the straight-\nness others would claim for these same texts. As with the constructing\nof sexual identities, constructing the sexualities of texts results in some\n\u2018real thing.\u2019 \u201d3 In other words, queerness may emanate from the viewer\nas much as from a same-sex kiss onscreen. As Richard Dyer notes, \u201cIn\nthe process of investigation, the by, for, and about category frays at the\nedges.\u201d4 With these concerns in mind, this chapter outlines the history\nof queer representations in screen media and considers the ways both\ntexts and audiences produce queerness in the face of legal and cultural\nrestrictions on overtly queer content.\nRepresentation is important for marginalized groups, but applying\nrepresentation\nlabels to individuals and content raises ethical issues.

Rather, recognizing their flaws as symptoms of the sociopo-\nlitical systems in which they are produced and consumed is essential to 352 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nthe viewing process. Helping readers learn to identify and analyze these\nsystems is, I believe, a textbook\u2019s core responsibility.\nFORM AND CONTENT\nAlthough the thoughts and feelings they generate are real things, remem-\nber that media texts never present objective realities. From Madeleine\nOlnek\u2019s outrageously campy Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same\n(2011) to hard-hitting documentaries such as David France\u2019s The Death\nand Life of Marsha P. Johnson (2017), films are representations (fig-\nure 10.1). They\u2019re created through subjective human processes such as\nwriting, casting, acting, costuming, editing, and more. However realistic\nand emotionally affecting, characters are works of art and artifice whose\nlives stop where the film does.

These tragic plotlines are so\nubiquitous that B.

Historically, moreover, these tropes\nhave been cultural or legal requisites for representation to exist at all. To\nunderstand the reasons why the definition, production, and consumption\nof LGBTQ+ film and media remain so complicated today, this chapter\ndevotes significant attention to sociohistorical contexts. Because such\ncontext is essential to understanding the contemporary conditions and\nmanifestations of LGBTQ+ film and media, the chapter focuses almost\nexclusively on the United States.\nWatch\nFor LGBTQ+ Pride Month in 2018, them. collaborated with Joey Soloway\non a short film series called Queeroes, in which filmmakers created films\nthat deliberately queered the Hollywood narrative.

Do\nyou find them effective? 354 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nHISTORICAL AND LEGAL CONTEXTS\nAs this chapter\u2019s title suggests, the history of LGBTQ+ film and media\nis bound up with social and political constraints that have consistently\nlimited the expression and representation of nonnormative genders and\nsexualities. Restrictions notwithstanding, all sorts of gender and sexual\ndiversity have found ways to make themselves visible and identifiable\nsince cinema\u2019s early days.\nFilm\u2019s Beginnings through the Hays Code\nIn the 1930s, the Motion Picture Production Code, often called the Hays\nCode, established moral guidelines that films produced for public con-\nsumption had to follow. These guidelines prohibited or restricted the\ndepiction of subject matter such as profanity, drug trafficking, religious\neffrontery, and childbirth scenes; a motion picture was not to \u201clower the\nmoral standards of those who see it.\u201d7 But before the Code was imposed,\nfilms featured more homosexual content than one might expect. See, for\nexample, Harry Beaumont\u2019s The Broadway Melody (1929) and Cecil B.\nDeMille\u2019s The Sign of the Cross (1932).\nPre-Code depictions of gay and lesbian characters were often carica-\ntured and insulting: mincing, dissolute men and unflatteringly mannish\nwomen. These stereotyped conceptions of homosexuality reflect the era\u2019s\nprevailing notions of inversion\u2014the idea that queerness equated to fem-\nininity in a male body or vice versa. In sexologist Richard von Krafft-\nEbing\u2019s words, an invert possessed \u201cthe masculine soul, heaving in the\nfemale bosom.\u201d8 Though these stereotypes persist today and have been\nexplored in such venues as David Thorpe\u2019s Do I Sound Gay? (2014),\nqueer and feminist theory have helped dispel the assumption that bio-\nlogical sex (male or female) is inherently connected to gender (masculine\nor feminine), or indeed that there are only two sexes or two genders.\nPoverty stopped many from attending movies when the Great Depres-\nsion hit, so filmmakers tried shock-value tactics to lure audiences. These\ntactics encompassed controversial material ranging from unprecedented\nviolence to sexual \u201cperversion,\u201d including homosexual characters.9 Par-\ntially in response to this trend, Will Hays, then president of the Motion\nPicture Producers and Distributors of America (now Motion Picture Asso-\nciation of America) banned all gay male characters in film in 1933.10\nRepresentations of homosexuality were barred under this ban on the\nbasis of representing \u201csex perversion or any inference of it\u201d; depictions\nof interracial relationships were also forbidden.11 Screening LGBTQ+ 355\nJust because the Hays Code forbade queer content doesn\u2019t mean\nnone existed, however. Think of the pink elephant game, in which the\nobjective is not to think about pink elephants. Knowing something is\nnot supposed to be present often seems to make the possibility of its\npresence more acute. For this reason, censorship is notoriously ineffective\nfor enforcing silence on a topic. Further, censorship often begets inter-\npretive tendencies that seek out subtexts whose direct expression has\nbeen foreclosed\u2014tendencies Chon Noriega has called \u201creading against the\ngrain.\u201d12\nMcCarthyism and Onward\nThe Hays Code\u2019s later years dovetailed with the Red Scare of the 1950s\nand Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s anti-Communist smear campaigns. Josh\nHoward\u2019s documentary The Lavender Scare (2017) explores the wave of\nhomophobia that arose in conjunction with the Red Scare. The 1950s\nhomophobia\nwere a time of extreme scrutiny for gay men and lesbians, leading to\nFear or hatred for\nfirings and other forms of discrimination against individuals suspected of\nqueerness and queer\nsame-sex inclinations. Homosexuality was viewed as dangerously sub-\npeople.\nversive and associated with communist activity\u2014a huge stigma during\nthe Cold War years.\nStill, film depictions of queer men and occasionally women prolif-\nerated during this time. Partly because of the Hays Code\u2019s proscription\non positive portrayals of \u201cperversion,\u201d these characters were often vil-\nlainous or mentally ill. Indeed, the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual listed homosexuality as a mental illness\nuntil 1973 and renamed \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d as gender dysphoria\nonly in 2013. It\u2019s unsurprising that depictions of queer characters have\nfrequently conformed to prevailing popular and medical opinion. Queer-\nness and psychological disturbance remain linked in productions such as\nDarren Aronofsky\u2019s Black Swan (2010), Sonny Mallhi\u2019s The Roommate\n(2011), and Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Killing Eve (2018\u2013).\nPost\u2013Hays Code Film and Television\nThe 1960s saw pushes for civil rights and freedom of expression in many\nwalks of life. Uncoincidentally, the Hays Code was finally laid to rest in\n1968. Having proved unpopular and largely unenforceable, it was replaced\nby the precursor to the current rating system, again from the Motion\nPicture Association of America: G (general audiences), M (mature), R\n(restricted), and X (under 16 not admitted). The ratings of PG (parental 356 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 10.2. Vito Russo,\nauthor and cofounder of\nGLAAD. (CC-BY-SA Massimo\nConsoli.)\nguidance suggested), PG-13 (parental-guidance suggested for those under\n13), and NC-17 (under 17 not admitted, replacing X) were added later.\nAs Vito Russo\u2019s book The Celluloid Closet (adapted into a 1995 doc-\numentary by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman) points out, same-sex rep-\nresentations historically have a much lower threshold for obscenity than\ndo those of heterosexual relations (figure 10.2). That is, a scene where a\nman kisses another man has been treated as much more obscene\u2014likelier\nto incur an R rating\u2014than a man kissing a woman.13\nFree Expression: Then and Now\nThe first U.S. Supreme Court case to address homosexuality in terms of\nfree speech was One, Inc. v. Olesen in 1958. In it, the court ruled that\nneutral or positive homosexual content was not inherently obscene. The\ncase had major implications for the media industry, because productions\nwith LGBTQ+ content or themes could not be instantly labeled as pornog-\nraphy even if they flouted the constrictions of the Comstock laws, which\nblocked content considered obscene from being distributed by mail, or Screening LGBTQ+ 357\nother moral strictures that had historically mandated content considered\nobscene.\nProgressive changes in the portrayal of LGBTQ+ individuals, commu-\nnities, and issues across media owe much to the continued activism of\nmany groups, from local to international, and changes in public opinion.\nIn 1985, Vito Russo and Jewelle Gomez, among others, founded the Gay\nand Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (now simply called GLAAD so\nas not to erase those who identify in ways other than gay or lesbian) in\nresponse to negative media coverage of the AIDS crisis. GLAAD promotes\ninclusive language that does not pathologize. For example, it successfully\npathologize\nlobbied the New York Times, the Associated Press, and other outlets to\nRepresenting a trait,\ndrop \u201chomosexual\u201d in favor of \u201cgay\u201d in 1987. GLAAD also hosts a media\nbehavior, or identity as\nawards ceremony each year, compiles indexes related to LGBTQ+ repre-\na sickness or inevitable\nsentation in mainstream film, and publishes an annual report addressing\ntragedy.\nthe inclusion of LGBTQ+ elements in television.14\nUnderground and Experimental Film\nIn spite of these legal and cultural restrictions, a gay underground cinema\narose with iconoclastic independent filmmakers such as Andy Warhol\nand Kenneth Anger. Warhol\u2019s Blow Job (1964) consists of a single long\ntake\u2014implicitly of the face of a man on whom another man is per-\nforming oral sex. Anger, who worked with the sexologist Alfred Kinsey,\nmade experimental films with homoerotic undertones (and sometimes\novertones). Fireworks (1947), which features a group of muscular male\nsailors and sexually suggestive imagery, led to obscenity charges against\na distributor who screened it. A theater manager who screened Anger\u2019s\nScorpio Rising in 1963 faced similar charges. In both cases, the charges\nwere dismissed.\nThough born in Hollywood, the lesbian filmmaker Barbara Hammer\nspurned the mainstream (figure 10.3). She directed the groundbreaking\nDyketactics in 1973\u2014a four-minute short that consists primarily of frag-\nmented, nonlinear images of naked women walking around outdoors. The\nlater Nitrate Kisses (1992), funded partially by the National Endowment\nfor the Arts, features intimate footage of \u201cdeviant\u201d couples, a thread\nrelated to the author Willa Cather and her rumored lesbianism, and the\nvictimization of lesbians in Nazi Germany. Unprecedented and avant-\ngarde as Hammer\u2019s style was, she has met criticism from within the\nfeminist community for her association of female bodies with fruit, trees,\nand other natural images that some view as complicit with the heteropa-\ntriarchal construction of women as passive, flowery, and fertile. 358 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 10.3.

This\nimage and its performative American-ness became the target of parody\nand critique by dissidents, filmmakers prime among them.

(CC-BY Regan Vercruysse.)\nSince the 1960s, the camp cinema of John Waters has delighted\nsome audiences while repulsing others. Pink Flamingos (1972), Polyester\n(1981), and Hairspray (1988) lampoon the strictures and hypocrisies of\nthe suburban United States, featuring the drag queen Divine and innu-\nmerable acts of subversion. Divine\u2019s influence went far beyond Waters\u2019s\nfilms, too. Legend holds Divine to be the inspiration for the villainous sea\nwitch Ursula in Disney\u2019s The Little Mermaid (1992). More recently, Liz\nFlahive and Carly Mensch\u2019s comedy series GLOW (2017\u2013) has embraced\nthe campy 1980s phenomenon of the same name, giving fictional life to\nthe erstwhile women\u2019s wrestling venture full of caricatured personae and\nself-consciously over-the-top storylines.\nNew Queer Cinema\nThe rise of independent film festivals such as Sundance and Telluride in the\n1970s and 1980s spotlighted smaller productions that lacked the financial\nbacking of major studios, from avant-garde work to indie narrative cin-\nema. Following the liberation-oriented activism of the 1970s\u20131980s and\nthen the HIV/AIDS crisis, a movement of u nconventional, experimental, 360 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nand unapologetic films emerged in the early 1990s.

It reinterpreted the link between the personal and\nthe political envisioned by feminism [and] restaged the defiant activism\npioneered at Stonewall.\u201d16\nNew queer cinema films such as Gus van Sant\u2019s My Own Private\nIdaho (1991) and Derek Jarman\u2019s Edward II (1991) featured overtly queer\ncontent, often focalized through outsider characters. Many also engaged\nwith or alluded to the AIDS crisis, including Richard Fung\u2019s 1991 Chinese\nCharacters, Marlon Riggs\u2019s 1989 Tongues Untied, Todd Haynes\u2019s 1991\nPoison and 1995 Safe, and Gregg Araki\u2019s 1992 The Living End.\nCheryl Dunye\u2019s (figure 10.5) mockumentary The Watermelon Woman\n(1996) calls out the erasure of Black lesbians in Hollywood and the\npersistence of racist film tropes over the years. The film follows Dunye\u2019s\ncharacter as she stages interviews with both fictitious and real-life lesbian\nactivists, including Sarah Schulman and Camille Paglia. Jennie Living-\nston\u2019s Paris Is Burning (1990) documents New York City ball culture,\nforegrounding Black and Latinx lives and communities involved in the\ndance vogue scene.

DeGeneres came out publicly as a lesbian on her sitcom,\nEllen (1994\u20131998), in 1997. The show returned for one more season but\nwas subsequently canceled. Many speculate that the final season\u2019s poor\nratings owed to network ABC\u2019s refusal to risk alienating conservative\naudiences by promoting it.\nThanks largely to Ellen\u2019s milestone pronouncement, late-1990s and\nearly-2000s television saw a spate of LGBTQ+ characters, personalities,\nand plotlines.

Even though it was predominantly white, middle-class, and\ncismale, Queer as Folk was pioneering in terms of promoting safe sex\nand portraying healthful, happy characters living with HIV. The show\nalso thematized prominent issues often associated with gay male com-\nmunities, for better or for worse, such as polyamory, body dysmorphia,\ndrug and alcohol use, and homophobic discrimination in the workplace\nand beyond. The L Word (2004\u20132009), considered by many the female\nversion of Queer as Folk, premiered on Showtime in 2004.

This section highlights\nsome points of particular contention within the field.\nComing Out\nOne of the predominant tropes in LGBTQ+ film and media is the Coming\nOut Story, exemplified in John Sayles\u2019s Lianna (1983), Alice Wu\u2019s Saving\nFace (2004), Dee Rees\u2019s Pariah (2011), and Greg Berlanti\u2019s Love, Simon\n(2018). These films focus primarily on the protagonist\u2019s realization or dis-\nclosure of their queerness. Sexuality is framed as a confession or disclo-\nsure, something that a closeted character hides or denies until a dramatic\nouting scene, often the plot\u2019s climax. Coming out stories are important, homonormativity\nA political and sometimes\nbut it is also important to challenge the status of heterosexuality as the\nnarrative approach\nassumed default until a different orientation is declared.\nthat works to establish\nLGBTQ+ lives as no\nHomonormativity\ndifferent from straight\nlives beyond the genders\nHomonormativity (see chapter 1) establishes the bounds of acceptable\none is attracted to. It is\nqueerness and that which deviates from it, often replicating other domi-\nan assimilation-based\nnant social norms with regard to race, sex, class, and ability. For exam-\napproach that invokes\nple, ABC\u2019s popular Modern Family presents gay men (a married couple the rhetoric of sameness\nplayed by Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet) positively, but they in appeals for civil rights\nare rendered respectable through other aspects of their identity: white, and social acceptance. 370 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nwealthy, monogamous, and constituents of a more or less traditionally\nstructured nuclear family. The show\u2019s message about queerness may\ntherefore be read as \u201cLook, we\u2019re just like heterosexuals,\u201d overriding\nrather than embracing difference.\nDebates over homonormativity in film and television abound. For\nexample, Glee provides numerous queer characters and storylines. Yet as\nFrederik Dhaenens notes, they ultimately \u201cconsolidate the heterosexual\nmatrix\u201d by portraying queer characters who are routinely victimized yet\nnonetheless overarchingly happy and conformist, as though simply roll-\ning with the punches eventually yields contentment.21 Moreover, LGBTQ+\npeople of color are still dramatically underrepresented. Gloria Calderon\nKellett and Mike Royce\u2019s web series One Day at a Time (2017\u20132019,\n2020) follows a Latinx family and presents much-needed diversity in\nterms of both characters and tropes.\nBisexual Erasure\nMaria San Filippo and others have critiqued bisexual erasure or invisibility\nwithin LGBTQ+ cinema. Even when bisexual themes, characters, and sto-\nrylines are present in film, San Filippo observes, they are typically referred\nto as gay, queer, or lesbian, terms that fail to acknowledge bisexuality as\nits own entity.22 Kevin Smith\u2019s Chasing Amy (1997), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Y\ntu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n (2001), David Lynch\u2019s Mulholland Dr. (2001), Charles\nHerman-Wurmfeld\u2019s Kissing Jessica Stein (2001), Ang Lee\u2019s Brokeback\nMountain (2005), and Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Call Me by Your Name (2017)\nall unambiguously depict both same-sex and different-sex relationships,\nyet they are seldom framed in terms of bisexual identity or desire.\nCiswashing\nTrans people are often excluded from mainstream (and independent)\nmedia, even from narratives specifically about trans lives. Among the\nfilms focused on trans individuals that have found commercial and crit-\nical success, many feature cisgender actors exclusively: Hilary Swank in\nKimberley Peirce\u2019s Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999), Felicity Huffman in Duncan\nTucker\u2019s Transamerica (2005), Jared Leto in Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s Dallas\nBuyers Club (2013), and Eddie Redmayne in Tom Hooper\u2019s The Danish\nGirl (2015).\nLaura Horak observes, too, that much writing on trans media focuses\non representations of trans individuals rather than on trans authorship.23\nBecause being out in Hollywood has always posed professional and per-\nsonal risks\u2014from pigeonholing and blacklisting to physical violence\u2014it\u2019s Screening LGBTQ+ 371\nimpossible to know the full extent of sexual and gender diversity that\nhas existed among filmmakers, performers, writers, and others.\nARTIST AND ACTIVIST SPOTLIGHT:\nTHE WACHOWSKIS\nThe Wachowski siblings (figure 10.12) made history in announcing their\nrespective transitions\u2014Lana in 2012 and Lilly in 2016. Lana is widely\nconsidered the first major trans film director. Though most famous for their\nfuturistic action franchise that began with The Matrix, the Wachowskis\nhave made significant contributions in terms of queer content. Crime\nthriller Bound (1996) features two women who conspire in a romance-\ncum-heist. Wishing to avoid the clich\u00e9, pornographized, or insultingly\ndiluted depictions of lesbian sex in film, the Wachowskis hired the sex\neducator and activist Susie Bright as a consultant for the sex scenes.\nBeyond critical success and Emmy nominations, the Wachowskis\u2019 Netflix\nsci-fi series Sense8 (2015\u20132018) was a milestone in trans media. Created\nprimarily by trans filmmakers and featuring a trans character played by\nthe actress Jamie Clayton, who is trans, Sense8 offers a nuanced repre-\nsentation of trans lives and issues.\nFigure 10.12.

The campaign entailed the launch of a YouTube channel and\nviral video ad featuring Savage and his family along with the message\nthat, however tough things are at present, they will improve with time.\nAlthough the campaign brought much-needed attention to homophobia\nand its consequences, it also drew criticism from within the LGBTQ+\ncommunity. Many queer activists and scholars, particularly individuals\nof color including Jasbir Puar (2010) and Tavia Nyong\u2019o (2010), have\npointed out that Savage\u2019s promise is predicated on a narrative of upward\nmobility and affluence that is unavailable to many of the most vulnerable\nqueer populations.24 It has also been critiqued for its failure to recog-\nnize the extent to which its makers\u2019 racial, economic, gender-based, and\nphysical privilege has helped clear their path. Activism and action are\nessential\u2014and careful thought and reflection equally so.\nCONCLUSION\nThis chapter is only a brief introduction to the wonders, shortcomings,\nand manifold complexities of LGBTQ+ film and media.

Riggs notes that it is a film \u201cspecifically for\nblack gay men,\u201d though its reception and praise has far exceeded this\ndemographic.25 Tongues Untied is a canonical film in the archive of Black\nqueer cinema, along with Riggs\u2019s other work\u2014Ethnic Notions (1986),\nColor Adjustment (1991), and Black Is . . . Black Ain\u2019t (1994). Ethnic\nNotions looks at racist stereotypes and caricatures of Black people in the\nUnited States; Color Adjustments surveys forty years of Black people in Screening LGBTQ+ 373\ntelevision; and Black Is . . . Black Ain\u2019t explores how multifaceted Black\nidentity is. Tongues Untied was a vanguard film because it was one of\nthe first to explore the specificity of Black gay identity. This profile ana-\nlyzes Tongues Untied as a film explicitly about Black gay identity and\nculture. It also meditates on Riggs\u2019s biography and relationship to the\ncontent, marginalized voices, Black gay cultural practices, and the politics\nof sexuality within Black communities.\nRiggs himself was in many ways the subject of his films. He was\nborn in 1957 in Texas and grew up during the civil rights movement in\nthe mid-twentieth century. Part of a loving family in a tight-knit Black\ncommunity, Riggs was a smart, athletic, articulate child. When he graduated\nfrom high school and began college at Harvard University, he dated women\nwhile constantly trying to deny his attraction to men. For a while he tried\nto convince himself that men were ugly and disgusting and that loving\nmen was vile. But eventually he conceded his sexual attractions and began\nliving life as a Black gay man.26 After entering into a long-term partnership\nwith another man, he was compelled to bring his filmic talents to bear\non his and others\u2019 lives. Ultimately, Riggs felt the imperative to no longer\nremain silent about the plights and lives of Black gay male identity, so he\ntook to the reel. Unlike many documentary directors at the time, he put\nhimself in front of the camera. His films center the lives of Black people,\nand it was Tongues Untied that brought gay Black people to the forefront.\nHe brings all this to his films, and Tongues Untied can be understood\nas in part a representation of many things Riggs himself experienced\nthroughout his life. Riggs was quite hesitant to make the film, remarking\nin an interview that\neverything within me was saying, \u201cNo, no don\u2019t do it. Find some-\nbody else who will talk about being HIV positive. Find somebody\nelse who will talk about being an Uncle Tom. Find somebody\nelse who will talk about being called nigger and punk and faggot\nand so forth.\u201d27\nAmid the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, when many\npeople were dying from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses (and were dispropor-\ntionately Black gay men), Black queer film at the time sought to answer\nthe questions of how to speak in the face of death and how to give voice\nto the dying. Even when not afflicted with deadly diseases, Black gay\nmen lived in social conditions that were not hospitable to their flourish-\ning. They were marked as pariahs who, even if they were HIV negative,\nwere seen as always capable of infecting \u201cinnocent\u201d (read: non-Black\nand nongay) people with their \u201cdeviant\u201d lifestyles. The act of calling\nsomeone a faggot or nigger is an attempt to silence that person, which 374 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\noften worked. Many Black gay men remained fearful of expressing their\nsexualities because of the verbal and physical violence they could be met\nwith. This has been occurring for too long; for too long has a racist and\nhomophobic society disallowed Black gay men from simply living as Black\ngay men. So Riggs thought it absolutely necessary to break this silence.\nAs a film, Tongues Untied was one of the first to speak explicitly\nabout Black gay life in ways that were not denigrating. The film features\na wide range of other cultural producers of Black art, featuring the music\nof Billie Holiday and Nina Simone and poetry by Essex Hemphill (who\nalso appears in the film) and Joseph Beam. It also defied categorization\nin its time\u2014melding documentary, experimental filmography, poetry, and\ninterview. Tongues Untied represented Black gay men in unconventional\nways in both content and form. It depicted more than a one-dimensional\nimage of Black gay life and conveyed not only the Black man refused\nentry into the gay bar because of his Blackness or the violent attack\nthat left the gay man bleeding on the sidewalk; it also demonstrated the\nresilience of Black gay men, from their public protest marches in solidar-\nity with other struggles to their intimate community, to their humorous\nmusicology and vogue dancing (figure 10.13). All this is groundbreaking,\nrarely depicted filmography.\nFigure 10.13. Voguing\ndancer. (CC-BY S Pakhrin.) Screening LGBTQ+ 375\nThe vast majority of the film is dark. Its background is pitch black\nas it faces Black men speaking about their experiences. Many of the\nimages shown are in black and white, muting colors that might have\nexisted. The darkness of the film is symbolic of not only the Blackness\nof the Black men discussed but also the profound void that the imposed\nsilence on Black gay men creates. It symbolizes isolation, loneliness, the\nlack of voice.\nSo often it is remarked that giving voice to the marginalized is\nimportant. But what does this mean? For Riggs and Tongues Untied it\nmeans \u201cloosening the tongue,\u201d as noted in the film. The tongue is a part\nof the body integral to speech, and its loosening marks a shift from voice-\nlessness to being able to speak one\u2019s truths. Racism and homophobia,\nor homophobic racism and racist homophobia, have shackled the voices\nof Black gay men. And their silence is and has been killing them, dis-\nallowing them to ask for things they need or to express their desires or\nto convey the aspects of their lives. As the Black lesbian feminist poet\nAudre Lorde famously said, \u201cYour silence will not protect you.\u201d28 It is\na silence imposed on them, so to actualize liberation it is necessary for\nBlack gay men to reclaim their voices.\nMoreover, the tongue is an instrument of pleasure and sexuality. It\nis used to lick, it is a key component in sucking, and it is integral to\nvocalizing lust and yearning. Nonheterosexual sex has been pathologized,\nand thus, to loosen the tongues of Black gay men gives them a voice\nand also allows them to express their sexual desires more freely. Riggs,\nin the title of his film, breaks the silence of Black gay men around sex-\nuality and actual sexual acts.\nAnother prominent theme throughout is the complex culture of Black\ngay men. This rich complexity is showcased primarily through three prac-\ntices: voguing, snapping, and responses to homophobia. Voguing is a styl-\nized dance originating in the late 1980s and finding roots in underground\nballroom scenes in the 1960s that were almost entirely queer people of\ncolor. It is inspired by the style of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and\nmodel poses in Vogue magazine. Voguers strike model-like poses in quick\nsuccession, integrating angular movement and holds with the arms and\nlegs. The dance acts as a cultural site of expression in a world that rou-\ntinely denies the unapologetic expression of Black and queer livelihood,\nthus serving as a site of catharsis among these marginalized people.\nIn turn, snapping is, of course, snapping one\u2019s fingers. But this prac-\ntice takes on a larger meaning in Black gay communities. Snapping is a\nsly yet profound retort to a number of things. The snap communicates\nin diverse languages and with varying connotations. It must, because\nBlack gay men have so long been silenced. Snapping acts as a way to\nspeak beyond conventional means; snapping is a vital communication 376 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ntool for Black gay men who have been disallowed from speaking. There\nare a variety of different snaps, named in ways that describe their move-\nment and purpose (e.g., classic snap, point snap). For a demographic so\nviolently silenced, it is imperative that new forms of voice be created.\nDeprived of verbal voice, Black gay men can snap and say just as many\nthings.\nEncompassing these practices and the many others of Black gay\ncommunities is how the broader world treats people who are Black and\ngay. Riggs encapsulates this at one point in the film: a medley of dif-\nferent voices spew various epithets used to foreshadow and do harm to\nBlack gay men\u2014\u201dpunk,\u201d \u201chomo,\u201d \u201cfaggot,\u201d \u201cmotherfucking coon,\u201d and\n\u201cfreak.\u201d These are terms solely for denigrating Black and gay identity.\nRacist and homophobic terms such as these do more than speak badly\nof Black and gay people; they are themselves forms of violence. As such,\nthese terms negatively influence how Black gay men in particular feel and\nbehave in the world. For instance, especially in the 1980s\u2014and still in\nthe twenty-first century\u2014gay men had to often hide their sexualities for\nfear of homophobic violence (yet still were subject to racist violence). If\nouted as gay, they would often be met with physical and verbal forms\nof harm. These violent practices led many Black gay men, and sexual\nminorities on the whole, to face a constant fear for their lives, unable to\nlive publicly in affirmation of their gay identities.\nTo live in such constant fear necessitated an outlet. Quite often the\nonly solace Black gay men could find during the 1980s was other Black\ngay men. Often, communing with other Black gay men was the only time\neach could be his full self. Viewers see an example of this in Tongues\nUntied when a group of Black gay men are sharing a meal together,\nsharing anecdotes about their lives. They converse about encountering\nhomophobic vitriol, about confronting that vitriol, and about strategies\nused to survive in its aftermath. Such moments are life sustaining, and\nsuch moments allow for the tiny accumulation of boldness, acceptance,\nand love that constitute revolutionary acts.\nWhat also weighed on Black gay men, especially during the 1980s,\nwas how other people in the Black community forced an impossible\nchoice, a choice described in the film as \u201cCome the final throw-down,\nwhat is he first: Black or gay?\u201d This is an impossible choice for Black\ngay men because it is impossible to separate the two identities\u2014they are\nalways, at the same time, Black and gay. Recognition of this is perhaps\nthe primary lesson learned by intersectionality: that the various aspects\nof our identities and oppressions converge and make up one another\nrather than being separable into discrete categories. For example, one is\nBlack and woman and faces bias on both of those grounds together, not Screening LGBTQ+ 377\none at a time. So when the revolution comes, they will be Black and gay\nfirst, because it could be no other way.\nBlack gay life is circumscribed by these violences, indeed, but it\nis not determined by them. In other words, Black gay men have a rich\nsocial life despite these violences and in the face of these violences. Riggs\nfinds the perfect consolidation of this tension in Black gay men\u2019s lives.\nTongues Untied is, then, a film showcasing one possible way of holding\non to the pain and the joy and how holding on to these two things is\nrevolutionary. Consider what Riggs says in an interview titled \u201cTongues\nUntied Lets Loose Angry, Loving Words\u201d:\nI really spoke of black men loving black men being not just a\nrevolutionary act, but within the context of black male dynam-\nics, the revolutionary act. It\u2019s not the overthrow of whitey. It\u2019s\nlearning to love within all the conditioning of learning to hate\nourselves. To me that\u2019s truly a radical break from our past.29\nRevolution happens when we radically depart from the current state of\nthings, a state of things that rests on the foundation of white supremacist\nand homophobic violence. In this context, Riggs is arguing that Black men\nloving one another is not just one revolutionary act among many others\nof equal weight; it is the revolutionary act. Because so much of Riggs\u2019s\nworld was structured by racism and homophobia, to love Black men\nmarked a way of inhabiting the world in a profoundly revolutionary way.\nIt cannot be overstated how profound Black men loving Black men is,\nespecially amid the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s when there was an\nunderground culture of cruising\u2014men looking for illicit, often unprotected\nsex with other men\u2014during a sexual crisis. This practice affirms deni-\ngrated life. To clarify: for two Black gay men to choose one another for\nunprotected sex, for pure pleasure and sexual autonomy, amid the HIV/\nAIDS crisis is not to be reduced simply to sexual irresponsibility or, even\nworse, ignorance. No, it is, rather, a commitment to living one\u2019s sexual\nlife as fully as possible despite how much one\u2019s very identity has been\npathologized. For two Black gay men to have sex during this epidemic is\nan affirmation of closeness, of touch; of disregard for the various ways\nthey have been told that their bodies and desires are disgusting and\nliterally illegal. \u201cI will not do what they have done to us,\u201d the act says.\n\u201cI will love every inch of you, every crevice.\u201d And this is an unwavering\nlove for those who have been said to be unlovable. Riggs, in giving voice\nto Black gay men, is voicing precisely this sentiment.\nTongues Untied remains relevant today because there is still a lack\nof Black gay male representation in film and media. Love between Black 378 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ngay men is still a taboo topic for films, only starting to change with the\nacclaim a film like Moonlight (2016) received. That Tongues Untied is\nstill one of only a few films that explicitly take up Black gay male life\nshows that there is still a lack of representation, which signals a larger\nsilencing of Black gay male experience in social life. Returning to this\nfilm could reassert the importance of Black gay identity, could usher in\na shift in the cultural imaginary.\nAll in all, the radical, revolutionary act is love, loving those who have\nbeen said to be unlovable. Tongues Untied is an ode to how breaking the\nsilence and giving voice to the oppressed is revolutionary. So often in the\n1970s Black identity and liberation was understood as one thing, by the\nmasculinist revolutionary calls of Black Power and Black Nationalism. But\nRiggs\u2019s revolution is one focused on more than just \u201cthe overthrow of\nwhitey\u201d; it is focused on how Black men can learn to love one another.\nReal transformation, at least for Riggs, is in the ending of the silence\nBlack gay men have been forced to keep. When the silence\u2014what is\ncalled in Tongues Untied \u201cthe deadliest weapon\u201d\u2014ends, perhaps Black\ngay men can come together and love unapologetically and openly. And\nas said in the opening minutes of the film, through coming together\u2014the\ncoming together of \u201cBGAs: Black gay activists\u201d\u2014\u201dwe can make a serious\nrevolution together.\u201d\nPROFILE: HOW ONE DAY AT A TIME AVOIDS\nNEGATIVE QUEER TROPES\nShyla Saltzman\nPopular media, for better or worse, helps teach audiences what is valued\nand what is possible. Inclusive representation, or portrayals of people\nwith diverse bodies and identities in the media, can influence how we see\nourselves and feel and behave toward other people. In a Washington Post\narticle, Amber Leventry explains that \u201ccoverage of topics and people that\nhave historically been considered taboo can take the emotional burden\noff LGBTQ+ people by educating people about gender, pronouns, gen-\nder expression and sexual orientation.\u201d30 Studies have shown that when\nwe see sympathetic depictions of marginalized groups, our opinions of\nmarginalized\nthose groups improve.31 One study found that people are more accepting\nTo be rendered less\nof transgender individuals after seeing them depicted onscreen, which\nimportant, less powerful,\ncould have positive implications for persuading the public to support\nand less visible than what\npolicies that combat transgender discrimination.32 Representation aids in\nis considered the norm or\neducating, familiarizing, and also developing empathy for people we may\nmainstream.\notherwise be biased toward. Screening LGBTQ+ 379\nRepresentation is important in itself, but it needs to be handled\nresponsibly. Reliance on reductive stereotypes or tropes can reinforce\nharmful messages despite the best intentions. There is more queer rep-\nresentation on television and in media today than ever before, which\nis an incredible achievement. GLAAD\u2019s annual \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d\nreport found a larger than ever percentage of not only queer characters\non network, cable, and streaming television but also queer characters\nof color: for the 2018\u20132019 TV season, 8.8 percent of regular series\ncharacters were LGBTQ+ (up from 6.4 percent), and queer characters of\ncolor outnumbered white queer characters for the first time.33 But some-\ntimes we celebrate too soon. LGBTQ+ visibility is important, but it is not\nalways an advancement in and of itself. There are more queer television\ncharacters, but they are often limited to a few categories: \u201csafe\u201d and\ncelibate, deeply pathologized, or otherwise preoccupied with homophobia\nto the detriment of their mental health and development. To consider\ncontemporary examples of LGBTQ+ representation in media, this profile\nexplores how the Netflix series One Day at a Time showcases nuanced\nnuanced\nqueer characters in a way that offers drama, empowers queer youth, and\nContaining layers of\nprovides learning opportunities and positive depictions for queer viewers,\nmeaning, having subtle\nallies, and allies to be.\ndifferences.\nOne Day at a Time focuses on a Latinx family that faces multifac-\neted issues and challenges. The grandmother is a devout Catholic from\nCuba, and part of her narrative arc is becoming\na U.S. citizen at a time when Latin American\nimmigration is a painfully charged topic in the\nUnited States. Her daughter, Penelope Alvarez,\nis a single mother, as well as a war veteran\nwho suffers from depression and post-traumatic\nstress disorder. Penelope struggles to become\na nurse practitioner and often deals with rac-\nism and sexism in the doctor\u2019s office where\nshe works. Most importantly for this chapter,\nPenelope\u2019s daughter, Elena, is a lesbian teenager\n(figure 10.14). To explain why Elena is a note-\nworthy lesbian character on television, we need\nFigure 10.14. Isabella Gomez plays Elena, a lesbian\nLatina teenager, on One Day at a Time. (CC-BY Jeff\nHitchcock.) 380 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nto discuss a trope that is regularly featured in queer narratives: plot arcs\ncalling out\nthat center homophobia and the calling out of bigotry.\nApproaching problematic\nMost shows that explore homophobia or transphobia resort to call-\nbehavior or language\ning out for dealing with discrimination. To call someone out is to expose\ncombatively; striving\ntheir problematic behavior, often in a stern way that allows onlookers\nto shame a group or\nindividual for their to also judge them. In \u201cSpeaking Up Without Tearing Down,\u201d Loretta J.\nbehavior to serve as a Ross writes, \u201cCalling out happens when we point out a mistake, not to\nwarning to others. address or rectify the damage, but instead to publicly shame the offender.\nIn calling out, a person or group uses tactics like humiliation, shunning,\nscapegoating, or gossip to dominate others.\u201d34 The TV network Freeform\nhas perfected the call-out scene. In their hit show Pretty Little Liars, the\nteenager Emily Fields has a relatively conservative mother who is horrified\nto learn that her daughter is lesbian. Pam Fields\u2019s journey to acceptance\nbegins when her husband, who fights in the U.S. military, gently chides\nher for judging their daughter so harshly: \u201cI don\u2019t like this, but [Emily] is\nstruggling with this; I can see it. . . . She is alive and healthy, and after\neverything I\u2019ve seen, alive and healthy counts for a lot, believe me.\u201d35 The\nturning point for Pam comes at an even more severe calling-out session,\nwhen multiple members of Emily\u2019s high school English faculty confront a\nbelligerent father who insists that Emily only won her spot on the swim\nteam because of the school\u2019s \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Pam\u2019s moment of redemption\nis not, as we might hope, an embracing of Emily on her own terms or\na realization that nothing has changed or broken about her daughter or\ntheir relationship; instead we get a moment of protective instinct that pits\nPam against this other parent\u2019s even more egregious form of homophobia:\n\u201cMy daughter never got anything she didn\u2019t earn. That\u2019s how we raised\nher. That is who she is. So you drop this . . . or I\u2019ll show you what a\nreal agenda is.\u201d36 The audience does not get to witness a substantial\ntransformation by Pam\u2014instead, at best, we see her realize that her\ndaughter is subjected to a lot of pain and anger in the outside world,\nand she does not want to add anymore: \u201cEmily\u2014I still don\u2019t understand,\nbut I love you. You are my child, and nobody hurts my child.\u201d37 Before\nshe can apologize specifically for her prejudice, Emily stops her with a\nhug. The gesture suggests that Pam has done enough hard work for the\nday and that Emily should acknowledge her for that alone.\nPam and Emily have a very moving relationship throughout the\nseries, but Pretty Little Liars erases the discord in the family about Emi-\nly\u2019s lesbian identity by contrasting Pam\u2019s tortured religious homophobia\nwith the privileged white man\u2019s supposedly much worse homophobia.\nprivileged\nReceiving advantages Pam saying, essentially, \u201cMy love for you and desire to protect you mat-\nthat are not available to ters more to me than my misgivings about your sexuality,\u201d is not the\neveryone. same as saying, \u201cI am sorry that I had an unhealthy reaction that made Screening LGBTQ+ 381\nyou feel unsafe and less loved. I am your mother, and I love you the\nsame now as I did when you were born.\u201d\nWhen the message is always and only \u201cI love you more than I hate\nqueerness,\u201d the bar for compassion and acceptance remains very low. It\nmagically lets family members and friends off the hook for problematic\ncore beliefs, and it reinforces the idea that an LGBTQ+ teen\u2019s happiness\nrests entirely on the benevolent epiphanies of the prejudiced people in\nher life. It necessitates that bigots come around before the character can\nhave a happy ending. It also often makes the LGBTQ+ teen character\ntake responsibility for or accept the homophobia of adults.\nOne Day at a Time moves away from the calling-out narrative in\ncalling in\nfavor of calling in. Calling in usually involves a more sympathetic way of\nApproaching problematic\naddressing problematic behavior: \u201cCall-ins are agreements between people\nbehavior or language with\nwho work together to consciously help each other expand their perspec-\nsympathy; asking why\ntives. They encourage us to recognize our requirements for growth, to\nthe behavior occurred,\nadmit our mistakes and to commit to doing better.\u201d38 The emphasis is on\nexplaining why it is\neducating and changing an individual, rather than shaming them. Elena\u2019s\noppressive, and devising\nmother, Penelope, is not on board when she first comes out as a lesbian a new course of action\n(figure 10.15). The first refreshing and positive aspect is that the call- collaboratively.\nFigure 10.15.

In season 1, episode 11, \u201cPride and\nPrejudice,\u201d Penelope makes every effort to support her daughter\u2019s coming\nout. The audience realizes that Penelope is battling her own homophobia,\nbut at no point does she make that Elena\u2019s problem. Penelope notices\nthat out of everyone in their life\u2014her other child, a close family friend,\nher own mother\u2014she is the only one struggling with Elena\u2019s news: \u201cI\nfeel really weird about this Elena stuff. . . . I hate that I feel weird about\nit but I do.\u201d\nWhile Penelope is figuring out her hang-ups about her daughter\u2019s\nsexuality, she knows to put on a supportive face because her \u201creaction\ncould affect Elena for the rest of her life.\u201d She turns to trustworthy adults\nfor help. She meets with a friend, Ramona, who is an out lesbian, to talk\nabout her reservations: \u201cI\u2019m a monster. My daughter came out to me and\nI am not totally okay with it. And I hate myself for it.\u201d Often this sort\nof conversation could turn into Ramona making Penelope feel ashamed\nof herself or guilting her into magically getting over her homophobia\nbecause she wants to prove she is a good person. Instead, Ramona fields\nheteronormativity Penelope\u2019s questions\u2014\u201cHow do I know if a girl coming over is a friend\nPolicies, beliefs, and or more?

According to Marybel Gonzalez, \u201cThe quincea\u00f1era\nmarks an important milestone in a girl\u2019s life. Part birthday party, part rite\nof passage, it symbolizes a girl\u2019s entrance into womanhood when turning\n15, traditionally showcasing her purity and readiness for marriage.\u201d40 It\nis similar to debutante balls, a tradition of upper-class Southern white\nsociety in the United States, which signify that a teen girl has reached\nthe age thought suitable to be married to a man. Elena\u2019s resistance to Screening LGBTQ+ 383\nthe event\u2019s heteronormativity manifests as concern about her dress and\nabout the role of her relatively absent father, who is supposed to close\nthe event with a father-daughter dance.\nElena\u2019s grandmother happens to be a skilled seamstress and insists\non making Elena\u2019s dress; however, the grandmother\u2019s best design does\nnot appeal to Elena.

Note\nthat during this episode, the father\u2019s homophobia is not centered. Beyond\nPenelope entreating him to show up at the quinces, no undue amount\nof energy is spent trying to guilt-trip the father into accepting Elena or\nchanging his mind about LGBTQ+ identities. No one realizes he is gone\nuntil the moment the dance is supposed to start. Elena is sad to see he\nis gone, but that sadness could have as much to do with the familiar\ndisappointment of being let down by her father as his homophobia. She\nis immediately joined on the dance floor by her mother\u2014who is a more\nfitting choice in any case, since she has been the sole provider for the\nfamily.

It provides an overview of LGBTQ+ depictions from\nthe silent era to films of the early 1990s. Including footage from over 120\nfilms, as well as interviews with directors and actors, this documentary Screening LGBTQ+ 389\nwas the first of its kind in examining LGBTQ+ representations in popular,\nmainstream film with such scope. Like the book on which it is based,\nit uncovers sometimes surprising early depictions of homosexuality in\nfilm and analyzes the historical development of queer representations\nin relation to motion picture industry censorship known as the Hays\nCode and the Production Code (United States: Sony Pictures Classics,\n1995).\nThe Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies,\nby Vito Russo\nThis classic work in LGBTQ+ film studies was first published in 1981.\nRusso, a prominent LGBTQ+ activist and film historian, covers the visibil-\nity of LGBTQ+ characters and themes in Hollywood cinema from the silent\nera to the 1980s. In 1995, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman directed a\nnow-classic documentary film of the same title based on his work. This\ndocumentary picks up where Russo left off and includes early-1990s films\nsuch as Thelma and Louise (rev. ed.; New York: Harper and Row, 1987).\nFabulous! The Story of Queer Cinema, directed by Lisa Ades\nand Lesli Klainberg\nCovering mainstream and indie cinema\u2019s LGBTQ+ landmarks, such as\nTodd Haynes\u2019s Poison (1991) and Ang Lee\u2019s Brokeback Mountain (2005),\nthis 2006 documentary provides analysis and interviews of the depic-\ntions and representations of LGBTQ+ experiences and communities in\nthe United States. Fabulous! is often described as the descendant of the\nclassic documentary The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies\nbut with a focus on queer cinema rather than on LGBTQ+ representations\nin mainstream, mostly heteronormative cinema. Though not unanimously\nwell reviewed, it provides a look that is hard to find elsewhere at late\ntwentieth- and early twenty-first-century popular queer cinema (United\nStates: Orchard Films and Independent Film Company, 2006).\nNew Queer Cinema: The Director\u2019s Cut, by B. Ruby Rich\nRich, a professor in the Film and Digital Media Department and direc-\ntor of the Social Documentation Program at the University of California,\nSanta Cruz, is a key scholar in the field of LGBTQ+ media criticism.\nShe created the genre term new queer cinema in 1992 to describe the\ndirections LGBTQ+ cinema was moving and how it differed from the past\naesthetically and politically. This work provides access to many of her 390 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nseminal past publications and to newer material. She covers LGBTQ+ film\nfestivals, the landscape of queer cinema, and important contributors to\nthe genre, including Todd Haynes, Derek Jarman, Julia\u0301n Herna\u0301ndez, and\nAng Lee (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2013).\nQueer Cinema and Visual Culture, by K. J. Surkan\nThis MIT OpenCourseWare offering from 2017 includes readings, films,\nand assignments and analyzes post\u2013World War II cinema through the lens\nof queer theory (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/womens-and-gender-studies/\nwgs-181-queer-cinema-and-visual-culture-fall-2017/).\nThe Queer Fantasies of the American Family Sitcom,\nby Tison Pugh\nPugh, professor of English at the University of Central Florida, inves-\ntigates heteronormative sitcoms, such as Leave It to Beaver, and con-\ntemporary sitcoms featuring LGBTQ+ characters, such as Modern\nFamily. He analyzes homophobia, the sexualization of girls, and gay\nstereotypes. This is an open-access text (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers\nUniversity Press, 2017, https://directory.doabooks.org/handle/20.500.12854/\n33010).\nTransgender Cinema, by Rebecca Bell-Metereau\nBell-Metereau provides a history of depictions of transgender people from\nthe silent era through the present in documentaries, classic and cult fea-\nture films, television, and world cinema. She examines these represen-\ntations and their effects on both popular understandings of transgender\npeople and transgender people\u2019s self-image. There are few recent, book-\nlength, scholarly treatments of transgender cinema with this scope. This\nwork fills a gap in LGBTQ+ media criticism, which often focuses on sexual\norientation more than on gender identity (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers\nUniversity Press, 2019).\nGLOSSARY\nace relationships.

In fact, the social development of LGBTQ+ identities\nruns through LGBTQ+ literature, as demonstrated by many of the sections\nin this chapter.\n395 396 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFor instance, the American writer Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry collection\nLeaves of Grass, a lifelong project first published in 1855 and contin-\nuously revised until his death, brims with erotic descriptions of men\nwithout ever characterizing same-sex desire as an identity. More blatantly\nqueer is the British author Radclyffe Hall\u2019s The Well of Loneliness (1928),\nwhich tells the story of \u201cinvert\u201d Stephen Gordon\u2019s lesbian romance and\nher life negotiating social isolation and stigma as a result of her mas-\nculine gender presentation and desire for women. Similarly, the African\nAmerican author James Baldwin\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room (1956) deals directly\nwith issues of masculinity, homosexuality, and bisexuality through its\nthoughtful protagonist.2\nAttempting to describe a canon of LGBTQ+ literature or to create a\ngenealogy of texts spanning continents and centuries is an impossible\ntask. Instead, this chapter explores specific fields of LGBTQ+ literature.\nAbiding by this limitation acknowledges that any survey of a field as\nvast and diverse as LGBTQ+ literature cannot be meaningfully cataloged\nin a single chapter. Students may wish to select one section and pair it\nwith primary sources for an in-depth look at a field. The chapter focuses\nprimarily, although not exclusively, on post-1950 work published in the\nUnited States to explore multiple fields of LGBTQ+ literature: children\u2019s\npicture books, young adult novels, comics, pulp fiction, and memoir.\nEach section provides readers with a historical overview of the field and\nintroduces readers to key terms, debates, and primary texts in the field.\nEach section also contextualizes the creation, publication, distribution,\nand reception of LGBTQ+ literature within a shifting sociocultural land-\nscape. Readers will gain an understanding of social, political, and eco-\nnomic constraints and opportunities that have influenced the creation,\ndistribution, and consumption of LGBTQ+ literature, which has always\nmet with unique pressures from cultural gatekeepers.\nContributors to this chapter consider literature both a product and\nproducer of history, and they suggest that literature plays an essential\nrole in queer culture, community, and identity formation. The genealogical\nstructure most sections adhere to allows readers to consider how literary\ncontent changes at different historical junctures. Even more, by reading\ntwo or more sections, similarities in content can be compared across fields.\ntropes Additionally, each section identifies and describes key tropes that emerge\nCommonly used themes in the field discussed. These tropes reflect shifts in societal attitudes\nand literary devices. about LGBTQ+ identities. For example, in pulp fiction and young adult\nliterature, representations of gay and lesbian love have historically been\ntragic; happy endings have only recently begun appearing.3 The quantity\nand quality of LGBTQ+ literature for young adults reflect shifts in social\nacceptance, which influences the publishing industry\u2019s willingness to pub- LGBTQ+ Literature 397\nlish these books and the ability of teens to access them in bookstores,\nlibraries, and even schools. It\u2019s fair to say that LGBTQ+ literary and\ncultural texts are slowly making their way into dominant culture, which\nmeans more diverse representations and more positive representations\nare increasingly available to all readers.\nJennifer Miller\u2019s section, \u201cLGBTQ+ Children\u2019s Picture Books,\u201d maps\nthe development of LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books in the United States\nfrom the 1970s to the present. Maddison Simmons undertakes a similar\nproject in \u201cTropes in Lesbian Young Adult Literature\u201d as does Robert\nBittner in \u201cTrans and Gender-Nonconforming Characters in Young Adult\nLiterature.\u201d Both trace content shifts in representations of lesbian and\ntransgender or gender-nonconforming youth in middle grade and young\nadult literature. All three sections demonstrate that representations of\nLGBTQ+ youth in books written for young people have contributed to\nparallel shifts in sociocultural understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+\npeople. However, there is no linear path to progress; representations\nremain dominated by cisgender white middle-class gay men in young\nadult fiction, and middle-class white representations still dominate chil-\ndren\u2019s literature, although transgender and gender-nonconforming char-\nacters are increasingly prevalent in the latter.\n\u201cLGBTQ+ Comics,\u201d by Mycroft Roske and Cathy Corder, focuses on\npopular and underground U.S.-based comics. They consider how the 1954\nComics Code influenced queer representations in comics by forcing them\nunderground. The Comics Code was prompted by the psychiatrist Fredric\nWertham\u2019s book Seduction of the Innocent: The Influence of Comic Books\non Today\u2019s Youth, which argues that comics turned vulnerable youth\ninto delinquents.4 Similar claims about the seductive power of culture\nhave been used to justify censoring other forms of culture with a young\naudience, including film and picture books. Whereas cultural gatekeepers\nworked to censor comics, lesbian and gay pulp remained relatively free\nfrom the censor\u2019s wrath. Cathy Corder\u2019s \u201cLesbian and Gay Pulp Fiction\u201d\nexplores the melodramatic world of pulp, which often depicted young\nwomen and men in sex-segregated spaces falling in love. There are rarely\nhappy endings in the realm of pulp, which tended to reproduce the trope\nof the tragic queer found across LGBTQ+ fields of literature. However,\nthese books were formative in the lives of many gay men and lesbians\nat a time when few other representations existed.\nThe chapter\u2019s last section, Olivia Wood\u2019s \u201cLGBTQ+ Memoir and Life\nWriting,\u201d is unique in focusing on nonfiction books. Wood notes that\nbecause of homophobia and transphobia, LGBTQ+ life writing has only\nrecently become available. She explains that life writing before the twen-\ntieth century was often in diary form and not meant to reach a public 398 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\naudience. In fact, according to Wood, LGBTQ+ memoirs produced for\npublic consumption are a relatively new phenomenon that didn\u2019t take off\nuntil the 1990s. Like the other sections in this chapter, Wood\u2019s demon-\nstrates that increased social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has prompted\nincreased representations.\nThis chapter does not represent LGBTQ+ literature in its entirety.\nEach section shares a snapshot of a particular aspect of LGBTQ+ writing\nas it has developed in the United States over the last several decades. This\ndeliberate choice introduces important and engaging content to readers in\na way that encourages meaningful exposure and exploration.\nLGBTQ+ CHILDREN\u2019S PICTURE BOOKS\nJennifer Miller\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books use images and text to explicitly repre-\nsent LGBTQ+ identities and experiences. They counter dominant sociocul-\ntural constructions of gender, sexuality, children, childhood, and family.5\nThese texts contribute to a queer world-making project by rendering queer\ngenders and sexualities visible, viable, and accessible to young audiences\nranging from babies to twelve-year-olds. According to Jan M. Ochman,\nchildren\u2019s picture books are a powerful socializing agent because they help\nchildren form a self-image, develop a sense of cultural expectations, and\nimagine inhabiting social roles.6 In addition to doing important socializing\nwork, LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature is a rich historical archive that reflects\nstruggles occurring within culture to define the meaning and value of\ngenders and sexualities that fall outside narrow and oppressive norms.\nThe best way to tell the story of LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books\nis through the books themselves. This section examines English-lan-\nguage texts published in the United States and Canada between 1970\nand 2018. It describes key texts and identifies key themes, as well as\nshifts in thematic content. It concludes with a brief discussion of how\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books became an identifiable subfield within\nthe category of children\u2019s literature.\nA Genealogy of LGBTQ+ Children\u2019s Books\nPublished between 1970 and 2018\nOvert representations of LGBTQ+ identities and experiences are a fairly\nnew occurrence in children\u2019s picture books, which is why most queer\nscholarship about children\u2019s literature seeks to uncover the queer potential\nin more readily available classic texts.7 LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books LGBTQ+ Literature 399\nslowly began to appear in the 1970s, a trend that accelerated greatly\nafter 2010.\n1970s: Sissy Boys\nA few books about boys who challenged gender stereotypes, a theme\nthat remains popular, were published in the 1970s. The trend began\nwith Charlotte Zolotow\u2019s William\u2019s Doll (1972), which is the story of a\nlittle boy who wants a doll. No one supports William\u2019s desire for a doll,\nalthough his grandmother eventually buys him one. She appeases his\nangry father by explaining a doll will help William be a good father. The\ngay author Tomie dePaola\u2019s Oliver Button Is a Sissy (1979) also tells the\nstory of a boy who doesn\u2019t enjoy typical boy things. Oliver is bullied at\nschool because of his effeminate behavior. When his parents enroll him\nin dance he gains confidence and even acceptance from peers as a result\nof his talent. This book has a positive message, although it demands that\npro-gay youth demonstrate exceptional behavior to be accepted by peers\nand family. The queerest of the 1970s trifecta of \u201csissy boy\u201d books is\nBruce Mack\u2019s Jesse\u2019s Dream Skirt (1979), which explores a boy\u2019s desire\nfor a skirt. Jesse\u2019s mother accepts him as do his peers, who end up\nemulating his style.8\n1980s: Lesbian Moms\nVery few children\u2019s books containing overt LGBTQ+ themes were avail-\nable between 1979 and 1989. Jane Severance published two books with\nLollipop Power Press, a small feminist press located in Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina, that published twenty-two books in its decade-plus of operation.\nWhen Megan Went Away (1979) is told from the point of view of a girl\nprocessing the separation of her mother and her mother\u2019s partner. Her\nmother is emotionally unavailable during this period as she deals with\nher own pain. Lots of Mommies (1983) is about a girl raised communally\nby several women. Severance creates a robust cast of lesbian characters\nwho provide the protagonist with a happy, albeit unconventional, home.\nAnnie Jo is a carpenter, Vicki is a school bus driver, and Shadowoman is\na healer. These texts are important historical artifacts of lesbian culture\nand lesbian cultural production in the late 1970s and early 1980s.9\nIn an email exchange on August 16, 2018, Jane Severance told me\nthat she was only a few years out of high school when she wrote her\nfirst children\u2019s book. She describes herself as \u201cheavily involved in the\nwomen\u2019s/lesbian movement, mostly concentrated on working at Woman\nto Woman Bookstore in Denver.\u201d Severance observes that \u201cparents were\nlooking for books showing children with different families, children 400 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nmaking nontraditional choices and being supported for making those\nchoices.\u201d It was in this context that Severance, with no training but a lot\nof passion, began writing. Severance received \u201ca lot of flack\u201d for showing\na lesbian couple in an unflattering light in her first book, but Severance\nnotes that lesbian mothers \u201cwere generally not supported, which meant\nthat they couldn\u2019t always make good parenting choices.\u201d Her work is a\nproduct of the moment it records and in many ways is far more antinor-\nmative than many of the LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books that followed\nhers and that remain in circulation.\nLesl\u00e9a Newman\u2019s Heather Has Two Mommies (1989) (figure 11.1)\ninaugurated a new trend in LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature by representing\nFigure 11.1. Lesl\u00e9a Newman\u2019s\nHeather Has Two Mommies\n(1989). (Deborah Amory.) LGBTQ+ Literature 401\nlesbian families as patterned after heteronormative conventions. Impor-\ntantly, Newman published Heather Has Two Mommies without the help\nof a traditional publisher. In an email exchange from January 28, 2019,\nNewman told me, \u201cThough Heather Has Two Mommies isn\u2019t self-pub-\nlished, I did actively participate in its publications. My business partner\nat the time, Tzivia Gover, and I came up with the term co-publishing. She\nhad a desktop publishing business, and when no traditional publisher\nwas willing to publish Heather, we decided to do it ourselves. We raised\n$4,000 via a letter-writing campaign, found an illustrator and a printer,\nand brought the book out in December of 1989.\u201d10 Micro presses and\nmission-driven (as opposed to profit-driven publishers) self-publishing\ncontinue to be a mainstay of LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature publishing. In\nfact, crowdfunding though platforms like Kickstarter are the latest tech\nversion of the letter-writing campaign Newman used to fund her project.\n1990s: Gay Uncles\nThroughout the 1990s, small presses with a mission, such as Alyson\nPublications, which was founded in 1980 and created a children\u2019s book\nimprint, Alyson Wonderland, in 1990, were at the forefront of creating\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature.\nBooks helping children understand and process loving and losing\nadults with HIV/AIDS began to appear in this period. A Name on the\nQuilt (1999), written by Jeannine Atkins and illustrated by Tad Hills, is\nthe story of a family memorializing a beloved family member after his\nAIDS-related death. In the book, which is told from the point of view of\nthe man\u2019s niece, the family creates a patch for the AIDS Memorial Quilt.\nThis is one of the few books that gesture toward gay community and\nactivism while representing HIV/AIDS; most depict gay men in isolation,\nas outsiders within the heterosexual family unit. This is the case with\nLesl\u00e9a Newman\u2019s Too Far Away to Touch (1995) (figure 11.2), in which\na young girl\u2019s uncle, who is ill from AIDS-related complications, helps\nher begin to process his eventual death by explaining that he will always\nbe with her.11\nMy Dad Has HIV (1996) takes a different approach. It is an acces-\nsible text about HIV told from the point of view of a seven-year-old child\nwhose father has the virus. The book was cowritten by Earl Alexander,\nan HIV/AIDS instructor, and two elementary school teachers, Sheila Rudin\nand Pam Sejkora. The father\u2019s sexuality is never discussed, instead the\nbook focuses on normalizing HIV/AIDS.12\nThat it took until the 1990s to see representations of HIV/AIDS make\ntheir way into children\u2019s literature evidences the cultural lag that can be 402 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 11.2. Lesl\u00e9a\nNewman\u2019s Too Far Away\nto Touch (1995). (Deborah\nAmory.)\nseen until around 2010, when LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature really became\na site of advocacy and activism for LGBTQ+ youth.\n2000s: Gay and Lesbian Parents\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, well-budgeted LGBTQ+ children\u2019s liter-\nature that explored a variety of themes became the norm instead of the\nexception. Most of these books continued to focus on lesbian and gay\nadults through stories that focalized the experience of children related to\nthem. Increased publishing opportunities eventually led to more diverse\nrepresentations after 2010.\nLesl\u00e9a Newman, the prolific author of Heather Has Two Mommies\n(1989) and Too Far Away to Touch (1995), continues to publish in the\nfield. Her experiences negotiating the publishing industry reflect publish-\ning shifts. She went from raising funds to publish her first book through\na letter-writing campaign in 1989 to being solicited to create board books\nwith LGBTQ+ themes in 2009. In our email correspondence Newman\nwrote, \u201cI was asked by Tricycle Press to write a set of board books: one\nabout a child with two moms and one about a child with two dads. Which\nI did. Tricycle was subsequently bought out by Random House, and the\ntwo books, Mommy, Mama, and Me and Daddy, Papa, and Me are still\nin print (10 years later!) and doing very well\u201d (figure 11.3).13\nDozens of books about lesbian- and gay-parented families have\nbeen published since the 1990s, with most being writing after 2000. LGBTQ+ Literature 403\nFigure 11.3. The board\nbook Daddy, Papa, and Me\n(2008). (Deborah Amory.)\nThis increased social acceptance and public visibility of lesbian and\ngay families parallels political discussions about marriage equality and\nLGBTQ+ adoption. If traditional publishing companies with marketing\nand production budgets are now publishing LGBTQ+ content, that attests\nto the marketability of these books, not just to LGBTQ+ families but to\nall families who wish to provide their children with realistic windows\ninto the world.\n2010s\nThis is not to say that all queer content has found a home in tradi-\ntional publishing or that traditional publishing is even desirable for all\nauthors producing LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture books. For instance, Myles\nE. Johnson\u2019s Large Fears (2015) (figure 11.4), a series of vignettes about\nJeremiah, a queer Black boy who loves pink and wants to go to Mars,\nwas crowdsourced.14 In a 2019 Twitter exchange with me, Johnson said,\n\u201cCrowdsourcing has limits, but it is perfect if you see a demand and just\nlet the audience fund it instead of waiting on gatekeepers.\u201d Johnson\u2019s\nunique narrative style and focus on the subjectivity of a Black queer boy\nmake pursuing traditional publishing, which primarily considers market-\nability and profitability, challenging.\nSmall, mission-oriented presses and self-publishing are still more\nlikely than traditional publishers to publish content that intersectionally\nengages marginalized social identities. For instance, Inhabit Media, an Inu- 404 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 11.4. Myles E.\nJohnson\u2019s Large Fears\n(2015). (Deborah Amory.)\nit-owned publishing company founded in 2006, published Jesse Unaapik\nMike and Kerry McCluskey\u2019s Families (figure 11.5), a picture book that\naffirms various family forms, including lesbian and gay families.15\nAlthough a handful of books on transgender experience have been\npublished traditionally, most continue to be published by nontraditional\nmeans. The very queer Flamingo Rampant, a Canadian micro press funded\nFigure 11.5. Jesse\nUnaapik Mike and\nKerry McCluskey\u2019s\nFamilies (2017).\n(Deborah Amory.) LGBTQ+ Literature 405\nby crowdsourcing, explores queer gender and sexual identities as they\nintersect with other identity categories, including race and ability.16 In one\nof their first publications, A Princess of Great Daring (2015), written by\nTobi Hill-Meyer and illustrated by Elenore Toczynski, a transgender girl\nhas not seen her friends all summer and prepares to share her gender\nidentity with them for the first time. Jamie\u2019s two moms drop her off at\nher friend\u2019s house, and her friends are playing a game in which they\nsave a princess from a dragon. Jamie offers to be the princess, and the\nboys are excited to have someone to rescue. Jamie interrupts the tradi-\ntional narrative by declaring that she will be \u201ca princess of great daring.\u201d\nConcerned that they will have no one to rescue, one of the boys, Liam,\nvolunteers to be captured by a dragon, but even the dragon defies gen-\nder expectations. She grabbed Liam only because she was lonely. When\nthe game ends, Jamie\u2019s friends tell her that she makes a great princess.\nShe takes the opportunity to explain that she is a girl. They immediately\naccept her, and ask how they can best offer their support.17\nNot surprisingly, in more traditional presses, marriage became an\nincreasingly popular theme throughout the first and second decades of\nthe 2000s, mirroring the increased visibility of sociopolitical debates about\nmarriage equality. Sarah S. Brannen\u2019s Uncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding (2008) tells\nabout Chloe, a little girl worried that her favorite uncle will have less time\nfor her once he marries his partner. Extended family are accepting of the\nsame-gender relationship, and Chloe comes around once she realizes the\njoy of having two uncles. Lesl\u00e9a Newman\u2019s Donovan\u2019s Big Day (2011)\n(figure 11.6) also takes up the theme of same-gender marriage, this time\nthrough the point of view of a young boy whose mothers are marrying.18\nFigure 11.6. Lesl\u00e9a\nNewman\u2019s Donovan\u2019s\nBig Day (2011).\n(Deborah Amory.) 406 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nAdditionally, over the last several years, books have introduced very\nyoung readers to transgender and gender-nonconforming children, and to\na lesser extent, adults have begun to appear. For instance, Worm Loves\nWorm (2016), written by J. J. Austrian and illustrated by Mike Curato,\nis a candid story about two worms who fall in love and wish to marry.\nTheir insect and arachnid friends demand they jump through all the tradi-\ntional hoops, including getting rings even though they don\u2019t have fingers\nand buying a cake even though they eat only dirt. They go along with\neverything until it comes to choosing who will wear the white wedding\ndress and who will wear the tuxedo. At that point, the worms queer\ngender expectations when one wears the dress with a top hat and the\nother wears the tuxedo with a veil. Another example, Square Zair Pair\n(2015), written by Jase Peeples and illustrated by Christine Knopp, takes\nplace in a fantasy world inhabited by Zairs. Zairs hatch from eggs that\ngrow from vines. Some are tall and square; others are short and round.\nRound and square Zairs always form a pair by attaching tails. One day\ntwo square Zairs pair. The community is outraged and demands they\nleave the group, using rhetoric like that of the real-world Right. After\nthe exiled Zairs save the other Zairs from starving during an unexpected\nwinter storm, they are accepted back into the community, which echoes\nthe demand for queers to be exceptional to be accepted.19\nStories about same-gender-desiring children are also (slowly) begin-\nning to appear. In Thomas Scotto\u2019s Jerome by Heart (2018) two boys share\nan affectionate friendship that makes the adults in their lives uncomfort-\nable. This is one of only two representations of same-gender love between\nchildren available in children\u2019s picture books.20 Ernesto Javier Martinez\u2019s\nWhen We Love Someone We Sing to Them: Cuando Amamos Cantamos\n(2018) is the other (figure 11.7). It is a joyful celebration of father-son\nrelationships and young love. Martinez\u2019s depiction of the Mexican sere-\nnata tradition subtly queers custom.\nIt was not until 2009, with the publication of Cheryl Kilodavis\u2019s\nMy Princess Boy, that transgender and gender-creative children began\nappearing in children\u2019s picture books. The gender-creative protagonist,\nwho is never named but instead referred to by the narrator-mother as \u201cmy\nPrincess Boy,\u201d seems to be effortlessly accepted by family and friends.\nThis book and others like it break out of the sissy-boy mold present in\nearlier books by representing gender-nonconforming boys who enjoy toys\nand activities associated with girls as accepted by family and peers.21\nTwo years later, the gay author Marcus Ewert published one of the\nfirst children\u2019s picture books, 10,000 Dresses (2011), illustrating the\nexperiences of a transgender girl. The child, Bailey, is bullied by family\nmembers who insist she is a boy even though she knows she\u2019s a girl. LGBTQ+ Literature 407\nFigure 11.7. Javier Martinez\u2019s\nWhen We Love Someone We\nSing to Them: Cuando Amamos\nCantamos (2018). (Deborah\nAmory.)\nRex Ray illustrates the text, providing the reader access to Bailey\u2019s inner\nlife by depicting her dreams and thoughts. Every morning when Bailey\nwakes up, she tells a family member about the dress-wearing dream she\nhad the previous night. Every morning a new family member dismisses\nher dream, ignores her attempt at self-definition, and tries to silence\nher. After her brother threatens her with physical violence, Bailey runs\naway from him. She meets an older girl named Laurel who is the only\ncharacter besides Bailey who is given a name and face. The two girls\ncreate beautiful dresses together. The final image is of the girls wearing\nthe dresses they worked together to make. The book alludes to chosen\nfamilies through Bailey\u2019s experience of rejection by her heterosexual fam-\nily and the support she finds with Laurel.22\nI Am Jazz (2014) is an autobiographical children\u2019s picture book\ncoauthored by Jessica Herthel and the title character, Jazz Jennings. Jen-\nnings, now a young transgender woman with her own TLC show, first\nentered the spotlight in 2007 when she was featured on a 20/20 doc-\numentary about transgender children. This book is a significant contri-\nbution to LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature because it is coauthored by and\nnarrated from the perspective of the transgender child protagonist.23\nLGBTQ+ books published in the last few years demonstrate how\nsocial and cultural visibility of LGBTQ+ youth has increased. Representa-\ntions that affirm LGBTQ+ youth especially reflect medical models of care\nfor young queer people that better meet their needs. 408 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nThe Making of LGBTQ+ Children\u2019s Literature\nThe conversations that surround LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature, specifically,\nchallenges and celebrations of its existence, are an important part of the\nfield\u2019s story.\nThe internet has played a critical role in increasing the visibility of\nLGBTQ+ identities and aiding postmillennial queer community building.\nBlogs by book reviewers, parents, teachers, social workers, and librarians\nhave provided a virtual grassroots campaign to spread the word about\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s books. For instance, Mombian: Sustenance for Lesbian\nMoms is a parenting blog that was founded in 2005 when the creator\nnoted \u201ca lack of sites with current, practical news and information for\nLGBTQ parents, or sites that looked at other aspects of LGBTQ culture\nwith a parent\u2019s eye.\u201d24 The blog contains a wealth of information about\nLGBTQ+ children\u2019s culture and smart reviews of dozens of books.\nThe recent emergence of literary awards provide LGBTQ+ children\u2019s\nliterature a degree of respectability and authority. For instance, the\nStonewall Book Award, which is administered by the American Library\nAssociation\u2019s Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table, was\nestablished in 1971, but a Children\u2019s and Young Adult Literature Award\nwas not created until 2010. The Lambda Literary Awards began acknowl-\nedging and awarding LGBTQ+ authors and writers of LGBTQ+ content in\n1989 and created a category for Children\u2019s and Young Adult Literature in\n1992. Awards lend legitimacy to the subfield. Both of these relatively new\nawards help LGBTQ+ children\u2019s books get the accolades they deserve.25\nLess affirming discourses predate blogs and awards. Children\u2019s litera-\nture has many gatekeepers: parents, educators, librarians, even publishers\nthemselves. Representations of lesbian, gay, and transgender experiences,\nexpressions, and identities remain some of the most contested within the\nworld of children\u2019s literature. According to the American Library Associ-\nation, two of the top ten most contested books of the 1990s represented\nqueer parenting: Daddy\u2019s Roommate, by Michael Willhoite, and Lesl\u00e9a\nNewman\u2019s Heather Has Two Mommies.26\nControversies over LGBTQ+ children\u2019s literature are hardly a thing\nof the past. In the 2010s, myriad attempts to keep books with LGBTQ+\ncontent out of libraries and classrooms have sprung up across the United\nStates as well as globally. In Kansas there were attempts to remove I Am\nJazz and other books with transgender characters from libraries. Attempts\nhave been made to ban the books of LGBTQ+ children\u2019s picture-book\nauthor Gayle Pitman in Colorado, Texas, and Illinois.27\nThe political, cultural, and personal significance of LGBTQ+ children\u2019s\npicture books can be best understood by cataloging responses to it.

Eight popular and accessible U.S. novels written\nsince the 1970s are the basis of this examination, with one or two books\nselected from each decade. All include a woman attracted to other women,\nwith most of them being clear that the character is a lesbian (or in one\ncase, bisexual). In the discussion, queer refers to cisgender women who\nidentify as lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or queer.\nThe first lesbian-specific young adult novel was not published until\n1976, Rosa Guy\u2019s Ruby.28 According to Christine A. Jenkins and Michael\nCart, the general types of stories with queer characters published between\n1969 and 2016 had one of three themes: \u201chomosexual visibility,\u201d \u201cgay\nassimilation,\u201d or \u201cqueer consciousness/community.\u201d Homosexual visibil-\nity refers to a character coming out and the tension that \u201cmight happen 410 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nwhen the invisible is made visible.\u201d Gay assimilation involves a \u201cmelting\npot of sexual and gender identity,\u201d and these stories involve characters\nwho \u201cjust happen to be gay\u201d but it\u2019s not their main characteristic. Finally,\nstories that involve queer consciousness \u201cshow LGBTQ+ characters in the\ncontext of a community.\u201d29 Although the homosexual visibility category is\nseen in nearly every novel, gay assimilation novels were more common\nin the 1990s to early 2000s, and stories with queer communities were\nmore common after 2000. This could be due to changing attitudes with\nrespect to the queer community over the decades. Novels closer to the\n2020s have more positive and diverse queer representation.\nLike LGBTQ+ literature more generally, lesbian young adult fiction\ntends to fall into one of the three categories Jenkins and Cart introduce.\nIn addition, the narrow field of lesbian young adult fiction includes these\ntropes: (1) the Miserable Lesbian, which refers to lesbians depicted as\nunhappy and lonely, (2) the Lesbian Victim, who has experienced acts\nof homophobia and violence as punishment for her sexuality, (3) the\nConfused Parents, who think that they did something wrong while rais-\ning their daughter and that\u2019s why she\u2019s gay, or they think that someone\nturned their daughter gay, (4) Lesbian Self-Discovery, in which she feels\nright with her sexuality and queer love interest, and (5) Found Family,\nfocusing on the importance of friends and on those in the queer com-\nmunity triumphing over hardship and coming together as a family when\nthe biological family of a queer person is lacking.\nThe earliest lesbian young adult novels are littered with unhappy and\nlonely queer characters, secret relationships, and violence against the les-\nbian characters. Of the eight books examined for this project, the stories\npublished in the 1970s and 1980s (and even some into the early 2000s)\nexhibited these tropes of the miserable lesbian and the lesbian victim,\nbut they accomplish the homosexual visibility and gay assimilation that\nJenkins and Cart defined. Although they may have been unhappy, queer\ncharacters were at least there, allowing some sort of visibility, even if the\nqueer character didn\u2019t get a happy ending. This is important because it\nshowed lesbian characters during a time when the LGBTQ+ community\nwas not accepted in general society. Between the 1970s and early 2000s,\nnovels that enfolded the beliefs of society at the time encountered less\npushback than those featuring an out and proud lesbian who had no\nproblems with her sexuality. People expected lesbian and queer charac-\nters to face setbacks because of their sexuality, but as they became more\nrepresented and accepted, over time the stories about queer characters\nwere able to evolve from miserable lesbians to lesbians who are out and\nproud and facing little to no pushback for their sexuality.\nRosa Guy\u2019s Ruby (1976) is often heralded as the first lesbian young\nadult novel. In the book, eighteen-year-old Ruby Cathy and her family LGBTQ+ Literature 411\nmove from the West Indies to Harlem, New York. The story describes\nthe family\u2019s adjustment to Harlem and Ruby\u2019s budding relationship with\nDaphne Duprey, a self-confident and charming girl in Ruby\u2019s classroom.\nRuby is described as a terribly lonely girl plagued by sadness, but she\nsees Daphne as a way to escape her loneliness. Although the story doesn\u2019t\ntouch on lesbianism much and never explicitly defines Ruby as a lesbian,\nthis was the first young adult novel that involved a relationship between\ntwo women. This book is a great example of Jenkins and Cart\u2019s homo-\nsexual visibility because, although Ruby is not happy, at least her story\nwas published and people could read about a young queer woman and\nher relationship with another woman.\nJulie Anne Peters\u2019s novel Keeping You a Secret (2003) is about Hol-\nland, the protagonist, realizing she has feelings for a girl named Cece and\ntheir eventual relationship. This novel harks back to the miserable lesbian\ntrope of earlier years because Holland gets kicked out of her house once\nher mother learns about her and Cece. But it also anticipates the presence\nof queer community, because Holland uses local queer resources to move\ninto a queer-run apartment complex. This novel includes the confused\nparent, lesbian victim, and self-discovery tropes and falls in line with all\nthree themes of Jenkins and Cart. Although her life seems bleak after she\nis kicked out, Holland believes that one day things will be okay and she\nwill have a home, pride, and acceptance within the queer community.30\nBy the early 2010s, the queer community theme and found family\ntrope are widely used. Published in 2012 but set in 1990, The Miseduca-\ntion of Cameron Post, written by Emily M. Danforth (figure 11.8), is set\nFigure 11.8. The\nMiseducation of Cameron\nPost by Emily M.\nDanforth. (Deborah\nAmory.) 412 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nin a conversion therapy camp. This story involves the miserable lesbian,\nlesbian victim, and found family tropes and falls into Jenkins and Cart\u2019s\nqueer community category. Although the camp itself is extremely toxic and\nis meant to break down the very essence of who each camper is in order\nto convert them to heterosexuality, the friendships formed between the\nmore rebellious campers are a saving grace in a place where they would\notherwise lose sight of who they are. As the first semester at the camp\ncomes to an end, all the campers go home to their families during win-\nter break. After spending months with new people and having practically\nzero contact from her life before, Cameron notes how strange it feels to\nbe leaving camp. She realizes that the camp has become home, but more\nspecifically, she realizes just how important the friendships she made have\nbeen. Despite the circumstances that brought them together, Cameron feels\ncloser to the other campers than she does to her aunt, who sent her to\nthe camp. This shows that, even though this type of camp was meant to\nstrip away the essence of who a queer person was, it didn\u2019t always work\nand sometimes created stronger friendships and a strong found family.31\nThese Witches Don\u2019t Burn (2019), written by Isabel Sterling, is about\na teen witch named Hannah who has to deal with her ex-girlfriend and\nan attack on her coven while managing life as a teenager. This novel\nis filled with positive representations of queer characters, and Jenkins\nand Cart\u2019s theme of queer community is very present in this novel. The\ntrope of self-discovery is also prevalent, but because Hannah is an out\nlesbian from the first page, the trope focuses more on her feeling right\nwith her new love interest than on wrestling with her sexuality. A lot\nof queer characters throughout These Witches Don\u2019t Burn show queer\nconsciousness and the importance of positive queer representation. There\nare lesbian neighbors who are married and expecting a child, there\u2019s a\ntrans coworker at Hannah\u2019s job, and various other queer students. When\nHannah first meets her new coworker Cal, she slips up and mentions\nher ex and then has to say that her ex is another woman. She immedi-\nately is nervous, her internal monologue saying, \u201cComing out is always\nnerve-wracking, no matter how many times I do it.\u201d Cal then comes out\nto her, mentioning an ex-boyfriend of his and that he\u2019s trans, and Han-\nnah recalls \u201cinstantly feeling a tighter kinship with my new coworker,\nlike seeing a familiar face in a crowd of strangers\u201d32 There\u2019s a powerful\ndynamic when queer people meet in a public space and recognize that the\nother is queer. When two queer characters meet in a story and recognize\nthat the other is queer, it lets readers know that nothing bad is going to\nhappen to them (at least with the other person) because of their sexuality. LGBTQ+ Literature 413\nWhen LGBTQ+ people are not accepted by their birth families, stories\nof found families and queer communities resonate deeply. These tropes\nand themes are important not just as story elements but for queer readers\nto see themselves in fiction. Even with the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges\nin 2015, which legalized gay marriage in all fifty states, there are still\nhomophobic people who don\u2019t support queer people. Although society is\ngenerally becoming more inclusive and welcoming of different people, not\neveryone is lucky enough to be loved and supported by their biological\nfamily when they come out. Queer friendships are usually stronger than\nother types because most queer people live with the fear that they will\neventually come in contact with someone who hates them just because\nthey\u2019re queer. Finding another queer person and creating a found family\nthat provides safety, love, and support is an incredibly important event\nin real life and in literature.\nThe trope of self-discovery and feeling right with a queer partner\nis in nearly every novel of this project. The character deals with their\nsexuality or, if they were already out, with their feelings for another\nwoman. In Annie on My Mind (1982) and Keeping You a Secret (2003),\nespecially, in a moment of gay panic, the main character slowly realizes\nshe is queer and freaks out, but her worries melt away once she kisses\nher love interest and feels that nothing had ever been more right or\nmade as much sense. In the novels published after 2010, there is less\nof this gay panic and more nonchalance about sexuality, because the\nmain character was usually already aware of her sexuality and okay\nwith it.33\nEven if the story has many pitfalls and trials for the queer charac-\nters, at least each novel mentions that being with the right person, no\nmatter their gender or sexuality, feels right and good and brings peace.\nIt\u2019s something that most people can relate to, and it\u2019s a powerful senti-\nment that normalizes queer relationships by implying that queer people\nand queer relationships are not inherently disgusting or wrong. Allowing\nqueer characters the same ability to find Mr. or Ms. Right, but of the\nsame gender, normalizes queerness in a heteronormative society.\nSince the 1970s, lesbian young adult novels have moved away from\nthe miserable lesbian trope and toward happier lesbian characters who\nfind a strong queer community and feel love and acceptance. The trend\nof the tropes and themes discussed here suggest that, one day, queer\nexperiences will be filled with less tragedy, but until then, literature will\ncontinue to have a strong queer community and an influx of queer-af-\nfirming stories. 414 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nRead\nMalinda Lo writes about her journey toward embracing literature and mov-\nies that feature lesbian characters in her blog post \u201cThe Invisible Lesbian\nin Young Adult Fiction,\u201d February 10, 2020 (https://www.malindalo.com/\nblog/2020/2/4/the-invisible-lesbian-in-young-adult-fiction).\n\u2022 What is your experience of viewing or reading about lesbian\ncharacters? Does the discussion of tropes in lesbian young\nadult literature help you understand your own response?\n\u2022 Lo states, \u201cCis queer women have always been marginal-\nized because we exist at an intersection of misogyny and\nhomophobia, at minimum. Add in race, disability, class, etc.,\nand things become even more complicated.\u201d Discuss any con-\nnections you see between this statement and the tropes in\nlesbian young adult fiction discussed here.\n\u2022 Lo talks about the relative lack of recognition for lesbian\nyoung adult fiction in the last ten years, using literature\nawards as an example. She asks specifically why cis queer\ngirls have not been recognized and introduces the idea of mi-\nsogyny not as a personal attitude but a system that enforces\nattitudes. Expand on her ideas using what you have learned\nabout how tropes in lesbian young adult fiction have evolved\nover time.\nTRANS AND GENDER-NONCONFORMING\nCHARACTERS IN YOUNG ADULT LITERATURE\nRobert Bittner\nLiterature for young readers fluctuates constantly to reflect and speak to\nthe experiences of children and teens in different geographic and com-\nmunity-oriented contexts, changing\u2014sometimes rapidly, as in the case of\ngender and sexuality\u2014over time as the sociopolitical landscape shifts.34\nLiterature reflecting the realities of LGBTQ+ youth is indeed very reactive\nto the sociopolitical landscapes in which it is written and published. As\nqueer and trans acceptability grows in mainstream media and the political\nlandscape, so too does representation increase in the literature published\nfor young people.\nThis section focuses primarily on literature produced between 2000\nand 2020 for middle grade readers, between the ages of eight and twelve,\nand young adult readers, between the ages of twelve and eighteen.

As windows, literature for\nyoung readers allows a glimpse into the lives and worlds of others. This\nis the lens through which the remainder of this section is constructed,\nthereby emphasizing the necessity and impact of diverse representations\nof gender in young adult literature.\nA Time Line of Firsts\nBuilding on the momentum from the publication of Luna (2004), Ellen\nWittlinger wrote Parrotfish (2007)\u2014the first instance of a trans man in\nyoung adult literature\u2014which follows Grady in his physical and mental\ntransition while dealing with an unaccepting family (figure 11.9). Two\nyears later, Brian Katcher\u2019s novel, Almost Perfect (2009) arrived on the\nscene and won a Stonewall Book Award from the American Library Asso-\nciation, the oldest and largest U.S.-based professional organization for\nlibrarians. Katcher\u2019s novel began to gather more negative reviews from\ntrans teens over the years following its publication, however, because\nof the many stereotypes the narrative relies on. In the same year, the\nnovel Punkzilla (2009) by Adam Rapp was published and two more\nshort stories came out in Michael Cart\u2019s edited collection How Beautiful\nthe Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity (2009).40\nFigure 11.9.\nEllen Wittlinger\u2019s\nParrotfish (2007).\n(Deborah Amory.) LGBTQ+ Literature 417\nAnother first occurred with the publication of I Am J by Cris Beam\nin 2010 (figure 11.10). J is assigned female at birth and is looking for\nmedical intervention to transition, but because he is not eighteen and his\nparents don\u2019t know that he is trans, he cannot legally access hormone\ntreatment. But what makes this novel a first is that J is both Jewish and\nPuerto Rican, making this the first instance of a nonwhite transgender\nteen in young adult literature.41\nA banner year for literature for trans and gender-nonconforming\nyoung adults, 2012 saw the publication of three novels with transgen-\nder characters and the first instance of a two-spirit secondary character.\nHappy Families by Tanita S. Davis explores the lives of a Black family\nas their father comes out as transgender, and Rachel Gold\u2019s Being Emily\n(2012) follows Emily as she is forced into reparative therapy to \u201ccure\u201d her\ntransness.42 Emily Danforth\u2019s The Miseducation of Cameron Post (2012)\nalso focuses on conversion therapy, and although it focuses on a lesbian\nprotagonist, Danforth includes a two-spirit character named Adam.43 Last,\nKirstin Cronn-Mills published the Stonewall Book Award\u2013winning Beau-\ntiful Music for Ugly Children (2012).44\nIn 2013, Kristin Elizabeth Clark published Freakboy, a novel in verse\nfrom the perspectives of three different characters, two of whom are\ntransgender. Another book, Two Boys Kissing by David Levithan, features\nFigure 11.10. I Am J by Cris\nBeam. (Deborah Amory.) 418 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nalternating chapters from the perspectives of different characters, one of\nwhom is transgender, which revolve around an attempt by two boys to\nbreak the world record for longest kiss.45\nMiddle grade literature saw its first transgender protagonist in 2014\nwith Ami Polonsky\u2019s Gracefully Grayson. Additionally, For Today I Am a\nBoy, by Kim Fu, includes the first Asian trans protagonist (figure 11.11).\nBut what makes 2014 stand out, in addition to these texts, is that the\nfirst instance of an intersex character appeared in Bridget Birdsall\u2019s Double\nExposure, in which Alyx struggles to understand and accept her body and\nher gender in a world of binaries. This year also saw the publication of a\npair of trans young adult memoirs by Katie Rain Hill and Arin Andrews.\nHill\u2019s Rethinking Normal and Andrews\u2019s Some Assembly Required explore\nthe lives of these teens both individually and during the time that they\nwere dating each other. These books started a small wave of trans young\nadult memoir over the next five years. A further nonfiction title, Beyond\nMagenta, by Susan Kuklin, features the stories of trans youth and the\nchallenges they face every day living in the United States.46\nAnother transgender middle grade novel, George, came out in 2015\n(figure 11.12). The book was written by Alex Gino, a genderqueer author,\nand garnered a number of awards. In 2021, the book was retitled Melissa\nto show respect for the protagonist\u2019s gender identity. Robin Talley pub-\nFigure 11.11. For Today\nI Am a Boy by Kim Fu.\n(Deborah Amory.) LGBTQ+ Literature 419\nFigure 11.12. The original\npublication and cover of\nMelissa by Alex Gino.\n(Deborah Amory.)\nlished What We Left Behind (2015), about Toni, a character questioning\ntheir gender.47 According to Jenkins and Cart, within this novel \u201cevery\nconceivable word in the transgender vocabulary is bandied about, dis-\nsected, and analyzed,\u201d making this novel not only enjoyable but also\ninformative.48 Two more intersex protagonists also showed up on the\nscene: Alex as Well (Alyssa Brugman, 2015) and None of the Above (I.\nW. Gregorio, 2015). And to make 2015 even more exciting, Pat Schmatz\npublished Lizard Radio, featuring a nonbinary protagonist.49\nIf I Was Your Girl (2016) was the first young adult novel written\nby a transgender author, Meredith Russo. That same year, Jeff Garvin\npublished Symptoms of Being Human (2016), a novel focusing on a\ngender-fluid teen who explores expectations of a binary world both in\nhigh school life and online through a series of blog posts. Anna-Marie\nMcLemore published a highly decorated novel called When the Moon Was\nOurs (2016), which features dual protagonists, one of whom is trans.\nGirl Mans Up (2016), a novel about a gender-nonconforming teen by\nCanadian author M-E Girard, was also published the same year.50\nBooks like Lizard Radio and When the Moon Was Ours showed\nthe possibilities of combining trans narratives with genre fiction, a trend\nthat continued into 2017 with Dreadnought by April Daniels and Mask\nof Shadows by Linsey Miller. An acclaimed nonfiction book by Dashka 420 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nSlater, The 57 Bus (2017), chronicles the true story of a young trans girl\nwhose skirt was set on fire in a prank and the young Black man who\nwas painted as a monster in the wake of the crime. Jaya and Rasa, by\nSonia Patel, a novel set in Hawaii, explores not only gender but also the\nplight of young sex workers. Another middle grade novel, Felix Yz, by\nLisa Bunker, features a gender-fluid grandparent who goes by Grandy.51\nIn 2018, Adam Garnet Jones adapted his feature-length film into a\nyoung adult novel called Fire Song, which features Canadian Indigenous\nqueer youth and looks at gender roles and gender expectations within\nthat context (figure 11.13). Mason Deaver brought out another nonbi-\nnary character in I Wish You All the Best in 2019, and what makes it\neven better is that Deaver is a nonbinary author. Kings, Queens, and\nIn-Betweens, by Tanya Boteju, features drag, gender questioning, and\nexplorations of gender nonconformity with a diverse cast of primary and\nsecondary characters.52\nTwo 2020 novels bringing new gender identities into mainstream\nyoung adult fiction are Kacen Callender, who writes about a demiboy in\nFelix Ever After, and in Somebody Told Me, Mia Siegert examines what\nit means to be bigender.53\nMany more new and emerging identities no doubt will be featured in\nthe coming years, and considering how long it took from the emergence\nof queer literature for teens in 1969 to the first trans young adult novel\nFigure 11.13. Adam\nGarnet Jones\u2019s Fire\nSong. (Deborah\nAmory.) LGBTQ+ Literature 421\nin 2004, there has been a huge change in what is included under the\numbrella of gender and sexual diversity in literature for teens. However,\nbecause there are still so few representations in the larger landscape, it\nis necessary to understand at least a few of the common and problematic\ntropes that exist in the body of transgender and gender-nonconforming\nliterature for young adults. And along with those tropes, the overwhelm-\ning majority of existing young adult and middle grade fiction revolves\naround white middle-class suburban families under the umbrella of con-\ntemporary realistic fiction, making it difficult to even find racial and class\ndiversity among trans and gender-nonconforming representation.\nTropes and Troubles\nMany trans young adult novels until very recently have been written by\ncisgender authors, and therefore a large majority of earlier young adult\nnovels feature tropes such as the wrong-body narrative in which being\ntransgender is described almost entirely as being born into the wrong\nbody. Although some trans people may feel this way, many do not, and\nfor nontransgender audiences to see this trope time and again can rein-\nforce the idea of a universal trans experience. Other tropes discussed here\ninclude the acceptance narrative, the hero\u2019s journey, and the focus on\nphysical transitioning in middle grade and young adult novels featuring\ntrans and gender-nonconforming young people.\nClarence Harlan Orsi notes in the Los Angeles Review of Books,\n\u201cA lot has changed for trans people in the last 15 years, yet the novels\nreflect a relatively unified perspective. . . . After reading only a handful\nof these books . . . , I could usually predict what would happen next.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cIn the end, though, . . . they teach the kids (and parents)\nwho read them what it means to be trans.\u201d54 When young adult novels\nand other forms of mainstream media continue to push the same tropes\nover and over again, audiences construct a false understanding of trans\nlived experiences, including the idea that trans existence is defined by\nphysical and psychological trauma. Brian Katcher\u2019s novel makes for an\nalmost perfect (pardon the pun) jumping-off point to better understand\nother common tropes.\nAlmost Perfect is an award-winning novel, but its narrative arc and\ncharacter descriptions follow what steadily became a well-worn trope\nthanks to Luna and Parrotfish. These early novels, and many since,\nfollow a trope that Vee Signorelli calls the acceptance narrative, in which\nthe focus is on cisgender characters and their ways of coping with trans-\ngender people in their lives. Even when the novels have trans narrators,\nthey are still often focused on the reactions of cisgender peers or family 422 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nmembers. Signorelli claims that in the acceptance narrative trope, cisgen-\nder characters often realize they have been horrible to trans people and\nshould be nicer, but not until after many years of torment and trauma.55\nIn 2016, Signorelli expanded on the acceptance narrative, explaining\na slightly more nuanced, but still problematic, trope in young adult litera-\nture: the hero\u2019s journey. This trope seems more hopeful at first; the trans\ncharacter tends to be the hero of their own story, and they often end up\nin a more hopeful place at the end. But within the main narrative arc, the\ntrans character still endures hardship in the form of physical or psycho-\nlogical trauma. With both of these typical narrative trajectories involving\nviolence toward trans characters, the ultimate message for young readers\nis that it is impossible to exist as a transgender or gender-nonconforming\nperson without inevitable trauma. As Signorelli notes, \u201cOver and over\nagain, our pain is used, and misrepresented. To make the very people\nwho make this world so terrifying for us feel good about themselves.\u201d56\nEven in memoir and other nonfiction, texts tend to focus on physical\ntransition, medical intervention, and navigating trauma, which in turn\nraises the question: Who are these books for? With fictional trans char-\nacters and trans teen memoir focusing mostly on the transgender body,\nreaders are left with the idea that being trans is entirely about the physical\nself, not about other aspects of life and enjoyment. It seems that much\nof the existing literature is still written to educate nontransgender readers\nrather than tell individual stories where trans characters can experience\njoy, purpose, and fulfillment.\nWatch\nCallender and Gino talk about how they write stories for young people\nin The Gender Question: Kacen Callender and Alex Gino on Nonbinary\nand Transgender Stories (https://centerforfiction.org/videos/the-gender-\nquestion-kacen-callender-and-alex-gino-on-nonbinary-and-transgender-\nstories/).\n\u2022 How does Callender, after reading an excerpt, account for\nintersectionality in Felix Ever After? What does Gino add to\nthis discussion?\n\u2022 The excerpt Callender reads from Felix Ever After is about\nthe importance of names for trans characters and people in\ngeneral. What happens to Felix in the scene, and how do\nCallender and Gino respond to it? What other young adult\nnovels address this issue?\n\u2022 How do Callender and Gino describe gatekeepers? What forms\ndoes gatekeeping take? What makes queer content particularly\nvulnerable to censors according to these authors? LGBTQ+ Literature 423\nBecause so many novels follow this path, the idea of a universal\ntrans experience means that existing literature may seem diversified on\nthe surface, but underneath, the core of many trans young adult narratives\nis the same. Novels such as those by Deaver, Callender, Gino, and even\nthose by trans youth themselves, like Katie Rain Hill and Arin Andrews,\nattempt to break free from the universality of so much existing represen-\ntation. By using personal experiences\u2014as trans and gender-nonconform-\ning individuals\u2014these authors can mirror their experiences within the\nliterature that they create, thus allowing for more accurate and nuanced\nrepresentation of trans and gender-nonconforming lives.\nThings are certainly improving, but there is still a long way to go.\nLGBTQ+ COMICS\nMycroft M. Roske and Cathy Corder\nGraphic narratives\u2014stories told through sequential images with words\u2014\ncome in many forms: comic strips, superhero comics, graphic novels,\nmanga, and more. Whereas the format of a picture story goes back cen-\nturies, our notion of comics is primarily a twentieth-century development.\nU.S. comics have an antecedent that is distinct from European com-\nics: the earliest comic strips were found on the sports pages in daily news-\npapers, between reports on baseball, boxing, and horse racing. Indeed,\nthe first comic strip, Mutt and Jeff (two men with a close relationship)\ndebuted in 1907 as a strip that focused solely on Mutt, a racetrack\ngambler. This sports orientation set the tone for many later comics as a\nheterosexual male-dominated genre, both in the characters and situations\ndepicted and in the industry behind the comics.\nIn the 1930s, however, comics could be quite playful about gender\nand sexual orientation. For example, the two main characters in George\nHerriman\u2019s comic Krazy Kat, which ran from 1913 to 1944, are Krazy Kat\nand Ignatz Mouse. Krazy loves Ignatz, and what makes this relationship\nspecial is that other characters in the strip refer to Krazy by both male\nand female pronouns. Krazy at times wonders whether they should marry\na man or a woman.\nComics could also be quite explicit, as seen in the Tijuana bibles,\nwhich were typically very cheap, eight-page brochure-type publications\nthat satirized Hollywood stars and other popular figures, such as Archie\nfrom the comics, with situations that include hetero- and homosexual\ncouples and threesomes and sometimes animals. The eight-pagers were\nextremely popular during the 1930s and paralleled the overt sexuality\nthen common in films (e.g., the not-so-subtle innuendo of Mae West), 424 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nwhich in turn led to the imposition of the Hays Code (1934\u20131968), an\neffort to censor movies.\nFans and scholars alike recognize the Golden Age of comics as com-\nprising the years 1930 to 1956, a period that saw the introduction of\npopular superheroes. World War II, in particular, inspired the rise of\nSuperman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and many other superheroes. Also\nappearing in the 1940s and early 1950s were two other popular genres:\ncrime comics, such as True Crime Stories, first published in 1947, and\nhorror comics, such as Tales from the Crypt, which began in 1950. These\ntwo genres were rife with extreme violence and sexuality\u2014a development\nthat did not sit well with the conservative social backlash of the 1950s.\nCensorship of American Comics\nInto this cultural atmosphere came Fredric Wertham, a psychiatrist who\nhad expressed disapproval of comics for years, including in a 1948 inter-\nview, \u201cHorror in the Nursery,\u201d and a symposium speech, \u201cThe Psychop-\nathy of Comic Books.\u201d In 1954, Wertham published his infamous book,\nSeduction of the Innocent: The Influence of Comic Books on Today\u2019s\nYouth, which argued that comics, by depicting morally questionable acts\nand images, were a significant cause of juvenile delinquency. Wertham\nexpressed concern regarding graphic violence, drug use, sexual imagery,\nand other topics. One of his major concerns, however, was what he\nconsidered to be implied homosexual content. He argued, among many\nother points on the subject, that Wonder Woman, an independent and\nphysically and emotionally forceful woman, was implied to be lesbian;\nand that Batman and Robin, two bachelor males living together and\nemotionally close to each other, were implied to be gay.57\nWertham\u2019s book led to hearings before the newly formed U.S. Senate\nSubcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency in 1954. By the summer after the\nSenate hearings, fifteen comics publishers had gone out of business, and\nmultiple city councils had passed ordinances banning crime and horror\ncomics. The surviving publishers, in desperation, formed an organization\nknown as the Comics Code Authority to police their own publications.\nThe Comics Code Authority wrote and enforced the Comics Code,\nComics Code\nwhich was based on the earlier Hays Code but had many far stricter\nRegulations imposed by\nregulations that prohibited anything considered remotely morally objec-\nthe Comics Code Authority\ntionable. The Comics Code covered graphic violence and sexual content\nthat prohibited morally\nbut also had extensive mandates regarding acceptable story lines:\nobjectionable material,\nsuch as graphic violence\n\u2022 It required, for instance, that \u201cin every instance good shall\nand sexual content, and\nrestricted story lines. triumph over evil.\u201d LGBTQ+ Literature 425\n\u2022 It effectively banned entire genres.\n\u2022 It disallowed \u201creferences to physical afflictions and deformi-\nties\u201d (disabilities).\n\u2022 It forbade the portrayal of racial prejudice, which was used\nto disallow the inclusion of any nonwhite central characters\nin what had previously been an unusually racially diverse\nmedium.58\nA primary focus of the Comics Code was sexual activity. Though the Hays\nCode had made generic statements about \u201csex perversion,\u201d the Comics\nCode was more specific and verbose. It prohibited \u201csexual abnormali-\nties,\u201d \u201csadism,\u201d \u201cillicit sex relations,\u201d and on and on. It required that\nany romantic stories emphasize the \u201csanctity of marriage\u201d\u2014a phrasing\nthat may sound familiar today. And among the most forceful prohibitions\nwas a mirror of the Hays Code: \u201cSex perversion or any inference [sic] to\nsame is strictly forbidden.\u201d59\nSuperhero comics were nearly the only genre able to adapt to the\ndozens of comprehensive rules, and other genres fell to the wayside. A\nlarge portion of publishers had already gone out of business and many\nmore were unable to sustain readership while following the Comics Code.\nThis left most comics, especially superhero comics, to only two pub-\nlishers\u2014National Comics, now known as DC Comics, and Atlas Comics,\nnow known as Marvel Comics. The Comics Code led to and cemented\nthe lasting image of superheroes as morally unassailable and superhero\nnarratives as morally simplistic. And it removed nearly all diversity.\nUnderground Comix\nThe Comics Code devastated the comics industry\u2014but not entirely. The\n1960s and 1970s witnessed the rise of underground comics, many of\nwhich started in college newspapers and reflected the collegial culture\nof rebellion. One early example of underground comix, as they were\ncalled, is Zap, a series that Robert Crumb and other authors and artists\nintroduced in 1968. The comics scholar Hillary Chute has identified this\nunderground industry as very much a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d that produced raun-\nchy narratives with a strong white, male heteronormative focus on taboo\nsubjects and gender and racial stereotypes.60 Zap, for example, had the\nbisexual characters Captain Pissgums and his Pervert Pirates, who were\nkinky drug addicts.\nFollowing are some highlights of underground comix that include\nLGBTQ+ characters: 426 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 Matt Groening\u2019s series Life in Hell, which began in the late\n1970s and ran until 2012, featured Akbar and Jeff, who are\ngay anthropomorphized rabbits.\n\u2022 In 1976, Garry Trudeau introduced the gay character Andy\nLippincott to Doonesbury, which started in 1970 and is still\nrunning today; Andy died of AIDS in 1990.\n\u2022 In response to the male-dominated comics of this period, a\ngroup of women organized to publish Wimmen\u2019s Comix, a\ncomics anthology that ran from 1972 to 1992. The first issue\nincluded a story with a lesbian main character, \u201cSandy Comes\nOut.\u201d\n\u2022 Howard Cruse was the editor of a similar comics anthology,\nGay Comix, which ran from 1980 to 1998. Cruse also au-\nthored Wendel in 1986, which is the first queer comic strip\nwith a gay author. His graphic memoir, Stuck Rubber Baby,\nrelates his coming of age as a gay boy growing up in the\nSouth and his participation in the civil rights movement.61\n\u2022 The comic book series Strangers in Paradise, by Terry Moore,\nran successfully from 1993 to 2007. At the heart of this se-\nries, which often took a turn toward mystery and intrigue,\nwas a romantic triangle between two women, one of whom\nidentifies as lesbian, and the man who meets them.\n\u2022 The comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For by Alison Bechdel\nran from 1983 to 2008 (figure 11.14). The strip follows a\ngroup of lesbians in real time through personal and political\nstruggles, starting with the Ronald Reagan years and young\nlove and continuing through graduate school, parenting, fall-\ning in and out of love, and finally the election of Donald\nTrump.\n\u2022 My personal favorite, Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian\nTerrorist, was initially self-published in 1991 by Diane Di-\nMassa (figure 11.15). Hothead rages against a sexist society\nby castrating men. The comic series ran until 1998.\n\u2022 Roberta Gregory\u2019s comic book series Naughty Bits ran from\n1991 to 2004, and her comics starred Midge McCracken, or\nBitchy Bitch, and Bitchy Butch, the \u201cangriest dyke in the\nworld.\u201d LGBTQ+ Literature 427\nFigure 11.14.

(Deborah\nAmory.) 428 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nOne important landmark publication almost single-handedly changed\nthe comics industry. Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus, which was published serially\nin Raw magazine from 1980 to 1991, demonstrated that the genre could\nmaintain a high artistic quality and deal with substantive issues.\nThe alternative and independent comics that emerged from the\nunderground comix in the 1990s and early 2000s built on this newly\nfound status, and notable publications that depicted lesbian characters\nare Alison Bechdel\u2019s graphic memoir Fun Home (2006) and Shannon\nWatters\u2019s comic book series Lumberjanes. The latter series started in\n2014 and relates the adventures of five girls at Miss Qiunzella Thiskwin\nPenniquiqul Thistle Crumpet\u2019s Camp for Hardcore Lady Types, an all-girls\u2019\ncamp with activities that encourage transgressive gender roles.\nReintroducing LGBTQ+ Characters in Mainstream Comics\nOver decades, authors, artists, and publishers had gradually chipped away\nat the code, but LGBTQ+ characters were among the last major frontiers.\nAsexual characters can be counted on one hand; transgender characters\non two. Most LGBTQ+ characters have been introduced using various\ntactics to soften their impact, to make them less shocking and more pal-\natable. Acceptance of LGBTQ+ people and issues in society, as a whole,\nhas been a major factor enabling progress. Inclusion has filtered in toward\nthe center from the outside\u2014into first creator-owned comics, then smaller\npublishers, then the adult-oriented publications of large publishers, and\nfinally the center of the mainstream.\nHere follows a short time line of the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters\nin superhero comics, showing those shifts.\n\u2022 1988: The first gay character, Extra\u00f1o, appeared in Millen-\nnium no. 2; he was not technically out but was an intensely\nqueer-coded caricature.\n\u2022 1991: The reformed villain Pied Piper came out as gay in\nThe Flash no. 53.\n\u2022 1992: The first explicitly gay hero, Northstar, came out in\nAlpha Flight no. 106. The creator, John Byrne, had suppos-\nedly intended for him to be gay since his debut in 1979 but\nhad been repeatedly overridden by editors.\n\u2022 1992: One of the first multisexual heroes, Element Lad, en-\ntered a similar-gender relationship in Legion of Superheroes\nno. 31, a soap opera\u2013esque comic. This character was later\nretroactively written out as having never happened. LGBTQ+ Literature 429\n\u2022 1993: A bisexual transgender woman, Coagula, briefly ap-\npeared starting in Doom Patrol no. 70 under an adult-oriented\nDC Comics imprint. She was created by Rachel Pollack, a\ntransgender writer.\n\u2022 1994: A transgender man, Masquerade, was outed in Blood\nSyndicate no. 10 under another adult-oriented DC Comics im-\nprint. He was a shapeshifter who used his ability to present\nas male but had dialogue that made clear his identity as a\ntransitioned man.\n\u2022 1999: Apollo and Midnighter, written as parallels to Super-\nman and Batman, became a couple in The Authority no. 8,\nunder yet another adult-oriented DC Comics imprint.\n\u2022 2002: Apollo and Midnighter became the first married gay\ncouple in superhero comics in The Authority no. 29.\n\u2022 2005: Billy Kaplan and Teddy Altman, a gay teenage couple,\nwere introduced as main characters in Young Avengers no.\n1, though this was not initially explicit, and they would not\nexplicitly kiss until 2012.\n\u2022 2006: The first major lesbian hero, Batwoman, debuted in\nNew 52, volume 1, no. 7.\n\u2022 2011: DC Comics and Archie Comics officially abandoned the\nComics Code, the last major publishers to do so.\n\u2022 2012: A nonbinary character, Sir Ystin, came out in Demon\nKnights no. 14 after a year of their gender ambiguity being\nused as a running gag.\n\u2022 2012: Shortly after New York legalized same-sex marriage,\nNorthstar had the first same-sex wedding in mainstream\ncomics in Astonishing X-Men no. 51.\n\u2022 2014: Loki said he identifies as both a man and a woman\nin Loki: Agent of Asgard no. 2. This makes him arguably\nthe highest-profile transgender character not only in comics\nbut also in all of U.S. popular culture, but very few people\nare aware that he is transgender.\n\u2022 2016: Apollo and Midnighter became the first gay couple to\nheadline a comic with the six-issue miniseries Apollo and\nMidnighter.\n\u2022 2016: Jughead, a character in Archie Comics, came out as\nasexual in Jughead no. 4. 430 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 2016: Wonder Woman was stated to be bisexual by a writer,\nalthough the references to this in the comics themselves are\nsubtle and easily missed or denied.\n\u2022 2017: Loki used the word genderfluid to describe himself for\nthe first time in Unbeatable Squirrel Girl no. 27.\nTropes and Themes\nLGBTQ+ characters in comics show many of the same tropes as in other\nmedia\u2014some negative, some neutral, some maybe even positive. How-\never, some tropes appear with particular frequency in comics, as opposed\nto other media. These are often employed to make the characters less\nvisibly gay, thus less likely to be forbidden by the Comics Code Author-\nity (in earlier years) and easier on the slow-changing, image-concerned\nindustry both earlier and later. A very abbreviated list of a few of them\nfollows.\n\u2022 Explicit Naming: Several characters are stated to be LGBTQ+\nby writers or editors, but the actual text contains only am-\nbiguous hints toward their identity. This allows the characters\nto technically be LGBTQ+ without the average reader being\naware of it. This is particularly common with high-profile\ncharacters such as Deadpool and Wonder Woman.\n\u2022 Nonbinary Shapeshifters: Nearly all transgender characters in\nfiction are inhuman, and comics are no exception. Comics,\nthough, are unusually fond of the nonbinary shapeshifter,\nwho shifts between genders and simultaneously physically\nbetween sexes. Thus at any given point, the reader is able\nto think of the character as cisgender and doesn\u2019t have to\ndeal with a character\u2019s identity not \u201cmatching\u201d their body.\n(And neither do the people in charge.) Examples include Loki,\nMystique, and Xavin.\n\u2022 It\u2019s Not Gay If It\u2019s an Alternate Universe: This trope, nearly\nunique to comics, depends on comics\u2019 use of the multiverse.\nCharacters are often portrayed as LGBTQ+ in alternate uni-\nverses, allowing both companies and audiences to deny that\nany queerness exists in the primary versions of those charac-\nters. The trope is ridiculously common, applying to dozens of\ncharacters. DC Bombshells is particularly notable. Bombshells LGBTQ+ Literature 431\nis an alternate universe with its own yearslong series in\nwhich nearly the entire cast (composed of alternate versions\nof preexisting characters) is lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or\nsome combination. A variant of the trope makes a character a\ndifferent gender so that a pair can be together without being\nLGBTQ+ at all. Dark Reign: Fantastic Four no. 2 shows an\nalternate universe in which Captain America and Iron Man\nare married\u2014and Iron Man is a woman. In other narratives,\ncharacters in alternate universes with the same roles and\ntitles but different names are LGBTQ+.\n\u2022 But Not Too Gay: This occurs across media, but because the\nComics Code emphasizes visuals, it is particularly significant\nin comics. LGBTQ+ characters are desexualized compared\nwith their straight counterparts. Queer couples are often to-\ngether for years without so much as an on-page kiss, where-\nas straight couples in the same series are shown in blatantly\nexplicit situations. Queer couples may even be restricted from\nhaving any physical contact at all.\nExplore\nDykes to Watch Out For (DTWOF) is Alison Bechdel\u2019s famous comic strip\nthat ran from 1983 to 2008. The online archive (https://dykestowatch\noutfor.com/strip-archive-by-number/) includes select comic strips, posted\nby Bechdel, and responses and commentary by readers and fans. The\nEssential Dykes to Watch Out For includes over twenty-five years of\nDTWOF strips in one book (Boston, MA: Mariner Books, 2008).\n\u2022 DTWOF was famous for depicting lesbians responding to and\nengaging in current political events. The characters in the strip\naged in real time, and their relationships evolved as well.\nWhat political and social issues does Bechdel explore in her\ncomic strip? Are these still relevant to our lives today?\n\u2022 How does Bechdel represent lesbian identity, culture, and\ncommunity? Does her comic strip challenge some of the tropes\ndiscussed earlier for LGBTQ+ comics?\n\u2022 Describe how DTWOF violates elements of the Comics Code,\nparticularly in relation to racial prejudice and sexual activity. 432 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nLESBIAN AND GAY PULP FICTION\nCathy Corder\nMany people dismiss pulp fiction as cheap, trashy paperbacks that low-\ner-class people read in lieu of literary classics. Yet because they could\nbe produced and distributed so quickly and inexpensively, these stories\nwere able to respond with immediacy to the great changes in society that\nfollowed World War II. Sandwiched between the Kinsey reports on male\nand female sexual behavior (1948 and 1953) and landmark censorship\ntrials and the 1969 Stonewall rebellion, the characters and narratives of\nlesbian and gay pulp fiction reflected a more open attitude toward sexual\nidentities and relationships but also the harsh reality during the McCarthy\nera of the lavender scare and the moral panics about homosexuality that\nwere used to justify firing homosexuals from government positions. Pulp\nfiction that features LGBTQ+ characters as the primary protagonists was\na genre roughly from 1945 to 1970. These books were usually printed\nunder a pseudonym, and scholars and archivists have been uncovering\nthe real authors, many of whom identify as gay or lesbian. Further,\nprinting houses with LGBTQ+ owners or sponsors enabled the widespread\ndissemination of these popular stories. Much pulp fiction from the 1950s\nand 1960s was reprinted starting in the 1980s by, for example, Naiad\nPress, Cleis Press, and Argo Press.\nHistorical Context for Pulp Fiction\nThe antecedents for pulp fiction go back to the nineteenth century, when\nthe rise of industrialization led to both more economical printing pro-\ncesses and more spare time for reading among the middle and working\nclasses. The penny press was tabloid-style newspapers that included fic-\ntion along with news, and because these were so cheaply printed, readers\nthought nothing of discarding them with the trash.\nThis early popular literature was quite melodramatic and highly mor-\nalistic, but that quality evolved into the more sensational fiction that fea-\ntured sex, sexual crime including rape and incest, crime more generally,\nfamily secrets, squalor, and clear-cut differences between good and evil.\nOne early type of this popular fiction, the city mystery, brought together\ncharacters from all classes, races, and genders through convoluted plots\nthat focused on the decadence of the upper class and the vile nature of\nthe lower.\nOther genres included westerns (such as the Deadwood Dick series;\nfigure 11.16), horror (derived from the earlier Gothic genre), and crime LGBTQ+ Literature 433\nFigure 11.16. An issue from\nthe Deadwood Dick series.\n(Public domain, Edward T.\nLeBlanc Collection, Rare\nBooks and Special Collections,\nNorthern Illinois University.)\nand police stories. Although none of this literature can be identified as\nLGBTQ+, it had important features that shaped the queer pulp of the\ntwentieth century. One such feature was the garish covers that quickly\nidentified the type of story they contained. 434 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nAnother important characteristic, found particularly in the city mys-\ntery, was the manner in which these narratives identified specific urban\nspaces where certain communities of people might congregate. Almost\nevery city mystery features secret passages, hidden doors, and shadowed\nalleys\u2014all suggesting the dark underworld where social mores could be\ntransgressed. (It is no wonder that twilight becomes such a catchword\nin queer pulp.) One of the best contributions of lesbian and gay pulp\nfiction was to help LGBTQ+ people see that they could be a part of their\ncity and that there were spaces that would welcome them.\nAgain, although there were no LGBTQ+ characters in early pulp,\nthere were gay subtexts that highlight effete men who wear suffocating\nperfumes and too much hair oil and voracious women who threaten\nyoung virgins. Much popular fiction of the nineteenth century provided\nthe vocabulary and stereotypical characters for later reading audiences\nconcerning individuals who fail to conform to proper social and sexual\nguidelines.\nPulp Fiction in the Twentieth Century\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw the continuing publication of popular stories\nin magazine format, and these mass-marketed magazines began to spe-\ncialize in specific sorts of stories: crime, passion, adventure, romance,\nand science fiction. These stories continued to feature garish covers and\nsensational language (figure 11.17).\nThen, in 1939, Simon and Schuster Publishers established a new\ndivision, Pocket Books, which was modeled after Penguin Books in\nEngland. With the introduction of a much cheaper form of paper pro-\nduction based on wood pulp (hence the genre\u2019s name), Pocket Books was\nable to sell these new paperbacks for twenty-five cents. At first, Pocket\nBooks reprinted literary classics in this new format, which shared char-\nacteristics of the earlier magazines. Every author from Shakespeare to\nWilliam Faulkner could be pulped into a cheaper edition, and lurid cover\nart and text were part of the process.\nBy the advent of World War II, pulp fiction magazines were popu-\nlar and profitable\u2014but they were also considered second-rate literature.\nWith wartime paper shortages, magazines soon died out, but publishers\nmade good use of digest and magazine presses to produce Armed Ser-\nvices Editions from 1943 to 1947. These small fiction and nonfiction\npaperbacks were issued to members of the military and introduced new\ngenerations of readers to entertaining and distracting stories printed in\na portable format.\nPostwar publishing houses responded to these new readers with an\nexplosion of cheap paperbacks. Fawcett\u2019s Gold Medal Books, established LGBTQ+ Literature 435\nFigure 11.17. An example of an early\ntwentieth-century mass-marketed\nmagazine. (CC-BY Will Hart.)\nin 1950, was the first to publish original writing in this format, typically\nfive by seven inches, with a glued spine, garish cover art, and cheap,\nrough paper that quickly turned yellow and disintegrated.\nLesbian Pulp Fiction\nIn 1950, Gold Medal Books printed the first lesbian pulp novel: Wom-\nen\u2019s Barracks by Tereska Torr\u00e8s. This novel is a largely autobiographical\naccount of the time that the author spent in London at a military barracks\nfor women serving in the Free French Forces. Torr\u00e8s herself narrates, 436 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nrelating the day-to-day life for a group of five French women, who differ\nin age and in experience and who couple and partner in various ways.\nOne of the first scenes of the story occurs when the women have stripped\nnaked for their medical evaluation; much focus is put on the individual\nfemale bodies, both naked and clothed. And one of the characters, of\ncourse, commits suicide.62\nAppearing soon after Women\u2019s Barracks were Vin Packer\u2019s Spring\nFire (1952), considered the first lesbian pulp fiction by a lesbian author,\nand Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Price of Salt (1952), written under the\nname Claire Morgan. The Price of Salt was unusual for its time, in that\nthe two protagonists remain together at the end of the story; at the end\nof Spring Fire, one woman is confined to a mental hospital because of\nher unfortunate alliances.63\nLesbian pulps were not the first appearance of lesbian women in\nliterature. Earlier in the century, Radclyffe Hall wrote The Well of Loneli-\nness (1928) with the \u201cinverted\u201d character Stephen Gordon. Djuna Barnes\npublished Night Watch in 1936 with the help of a literary agent, and\nGale Wilhelm published We Too Are Drifting in 1935 with Random House.\nAlthough these early works are now considered classics of lesbian lit-\nerature, even Radclyffe Hall could be pulped and reissued in the 1950s\n(figure 11.18).64\nAlthough the earlier lesbian pulp fiction, such as Women\u2019s Barracks\nand Spring Fire, ended tragically in suicide or insanity, a handful of\nlesbian authors contributed a great deal to the increasing level of self-\nacceptance among their readers, due to their complex characterizations\nand positive plot resolutions. Across the nation, lesbians read pulp fiction\nand learned that they were not alone, and lesbian pulps did much to\nhelp these readers establish their own communities. Ann Bannon, whom\nmany consider the queen of lesbian pulps, wrote five books in the Beebo\nBrinker series (1957\u20131962) (figure 11.19). Her characters range from\nthe mannish Beebo to more femme characters, demonstrating how far\npulps could move from the stereotypical people who transgressed social\nand sexual norms.65\nOther productive writers included Valerie Taylor, author of The Girls\nin 3-B (1959) and Stranger on Lesbos (1960); Marijane Meaker, who\nwrote, as Vin Packer, Spring Fire and, as Anne Aldrich, We, Too, Must\nLove (1958); and March Hastings, who wrote Three Women (1958). These\nauthors elevated lesbian pulp with well-crafted stories and multifaceted\ncharacters. And there were hundreds more authors, many of whom\nremain anonymous, who are just now being identified and reprinted by\nsuch publishers as Naiad Press and Cleis Press, which have focused on\nlost lesbian literature.66 LGBTQ+ Literature 437\nFigure 11.18. Radclyffe\nHall\u2019s The Well of Loneliness.\n(Deborah Amory.)\nFigure 11.19. A Beebo\nBrinker book by Ann\nBannon. (Deborah Amory.) 438 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nLesbian pulps, much like dime novels and city mysteries in the\nprevious century, were easy to spot by their covers. And, like the earlier\nsensational fiction, these pulps were disseminated through drug stores,\ntrain stations, and other public spaces. This accessibility dovetailed with\nthe increase in same-sex communities, whether in women\u2019s military orga-\nnizations or women working together in industry in greater numbers,\nand with the postwar relocation of many young women to large urban\ncenters with gathering spots, such as gay bars. Pulps gave these women\na language, a map, and a conduct code and contributed to the formation\nof some of the earliest lesbian civil rights groups, such as the Daughters\nof Bilitis, organized in 1955.\nGay Pulp Fiction\nJust as with lesbian fiction, there were gay literary works in the first\nhalf of the twentieth century. Books such as Other Voices, Other Rooms\nby Truman Capote (1948) and The City and the Pillar by Gore Vidal\n(1948) were notable in that they avoided the tragic plot in which the gay\nprotagonist dies or kills himself or goes insane. However, an early gay\npulp, written by Charles Jackson, The Fall of Valor (1946), is a tragic\nstory that mirrors the unhappy life of the author (also the author of The\nLost Weekend).67\nGay pulp fiction in the 1950s frequently partnered a boy\u2019s coming-\nof-age story with a narrative of coming out. Two good examples of this\nstory line are Gerald Tesch\u2019s Never the Same Again (1956) and Russell\nThacher\u2019s The Tender Age (1952), both of which have protagonists who\nare dealing with the unsettled society of postwar America.68\nThe gay pulps that emerged in the 1960s often took two different\napproaches. In one, the gay protagonist finds self-awareness and accep-\ntance within his new community; the second approach takes a much more\ncampy tone. Typical of the first type are the novels of Richard Amory,\nwhich include Song of the Loon (1966), a gay pastoral with gay Native\nAmericans, and its two sequels, Song of Aaron (1967) and Listen, the\nLoon Sings (1968)\u2014all issued by Greenleaf Publishers, a gay printing\nhouse based in Chicago and then San Diego.69\nThe more campy pulps were responding to the glut of spy movies\nand television shows of the 1960s. One of the most popular titles was\nThe Man from C.A.M.P. (1966) by Don Holliday, a pseudonym for Victor\nJ. Banis. Holliday\u2019s ten C.A.M.P. pulps starred Jackie Holmes, a highly\naccomplished agent for C.A.M.P., an organization dedicated to the pro-\ntection of gays (figure 11.20). Other campy pulps took similar liberties\nwith other popular genre fiction. Again, Greenleaf Publishers issued many\nof these books.70 LGBTQ+ Literature 439\nFigure 11.20. The second and eighth\nof Don Holliday\u2019s ten C.A.M.P. pulps.\n(Deborah Amory.)\nTropes and Themes\n\u2022 Lesbian and gay pulp fiction stories tend to use the same\nsettings: all-boys or all-girls schools, college fraternities or\nsororities, military organizations, department stores, art stu-\ndios, and the like.\n\u2022 Publishers demanded formulaic plots that could be turned\nout quickly: in lesbian pulp, the formula tended to be that\nthe female protagonist was either saved from homosexuality\nby the love of a good man or died. Marion Zimmer Bradley,\nauthor of several lesbian pulps, completely quit writing in\nthe genre, because publishers would not let her tell the story\nshe wanted to.71 In gay pulp, standard story lines often in-\nvolved a boy\u2019s first sexual experience as either enlightening\nor devastating. Again, a common story line was boy meets\nboy; boy dies. 440 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 Although the majority of LGBTQ+ pulp fiction presented this\npunitive aspect to unconventional sexual relationships, a\ngood portion actually have happy endings, in which main\ncharacters emerge with a positive attitude about their sexual\nidentity.\n\u2022 LGBTQ+ pulp fiction offered a window into the gay and les-\nbian world. Readers might learn where gays lived (typically\nGreenwich Village or perhaps New Orleans), how they con-\ngregated at gay bars and bathhouses, and other details. These\nstories were essentially a map to gay life, providing directions\nto positive urban spaces.\n\u2022 In many LGBTQ+ pulps, the narrative shows the protagonist\nbeing introduced to codes of dress and language (lesbians\nhave short hair and wear white shirts with black stovepipe\npants). They gave their readers a vocabulary, or code, with\nwhich to redefine and identify themselves, much like an et-\niquette manual or foreign phrase book.\n\u2022 How much sex is actually in these stories? Not that much.\nAnd the sex might be consensual and pleasurable, but it\ncould also be nonconsensual, violent, and exploitative. Black-\nmail often entered the plot.\nWatch\n\u201cIntroduction to the Lesbian Pulp Fiction Collection at the Mount Saint Vin-\ncent University Library\u201d describes the library\u2019s collection (https://msvulpf.\nomeka.net/exhibits/show/lpf/lpf).\n\u2022 Did any of the facts about pulp fiction discussed in this section\nor the video surprise or intrigue you? Discuss what surprised\nor intrigued you and why.\n\u2022 Explore the books listed under one of the collection\u2019s identi-\nfied themes. What evidence do you find that the books belong\nwith this theme? How does this theme compare to the tropes\nand themes discussed in this section?\n\u2022 This section and the introduction to the collection both note\nthat gay and lesbian pulp fiction in the 1950s both enforced\nheteronormative and homophobic societal norms and provid-\ned an opportunity for lesbians and gays to see themselves\nin fiction and learn about lesbian and gay culture. Read one\nof the books mentioned in this chapter, and describe how it\nmight have been able to do both of these things. LGBTQ+ Literature 441\nPulp Fiction after Stonewall\nThe 1960s saw landmark trials that revoked censorship codes and the\nrise of the gay rights movement after the Stonewall rebellion. By the\n1970s, LGBTQ+ pulp fiction began to evolve in several directions\u2014erot-\nica, romance, and mainstream gay and lesbian literature by such authors\nas Sarah Waters, Dorothy Allison, Jeannette Winterson, Alison Bechdel,\nAlan Hollinghurst, Armistead Maupin, and Michael Cunningham. There\ncontinues to be much new research into these books, authors, publish-\ners, and cover artists, and major library collections can now be found at\nBrown University (perhaps the largest collection of LGBTQ+ pulp fiction\nanywhere) and at Duke University.\nLGBTQ+ MEMOIR AND LIFE WRITING\nOlivia Wood\nMemoir, autobiography, and diary are three closely related genres that\nfall under the umbrella of life writing. All of them are nonfiction texts\n(or as close to nonfiction as possible) written by the author about the\nauthor\u2019s own life. Because of widespread homo- and transphobia, stories\nof LGBTQ+ lives were not numerous or widely available in the main-\nstream until fairly recently. Furthermore, many LGBTQ+ people grow up\nwithout any LGBTQ+ role models in their lives, and LGBTQ+ history is\nrarely taught in schools. These circumstances make life writing especially\nimportant, because these stories serve as windows into parts of people\u2019s\nlives\u2014and the history of the broader community\u2014that were previously\nsecret or unknown, and they provide valuable representation for young\npeople trying to figure out what their identity or identities mean to them.\nThis section focuses on life writing by LGBTQ+ authors written in\nEnglish in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Exceptions to this\ncategorization are noted. For the purposes of this section, memoir refers\nto a text about a particular period or aspect of the author\u2019s life written\nin retrospect, autobiography refers to a text intended to provide an over-\nview of the author\u2019s entire life, and a diary is a text or texts originally\nwritten not for publication but for the author\u2019s private purposes, written\ncontemporaneously with the events it describes.\nA Brief History of LGBTQ+ Life Writing\nMost LGBTQ+ life writing from the beginning of the twentieth century\nor earlier are diaries and letters, intended only for private reading. These 442 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\ntexts were later found and published after the authors\u2019 deaths by family\nmembers or by scholars if the author was an important historical figure.\nExamples in this category include the diaries and letters of Virginia Woolf\n(written 1915\u20131941, published after her death by her husband and her\nnephew) and letters from King James I (written in the 1620s). These\ntexts are significant because they demonstrate the diverse presence of\nsame-gender desire throughout history\u2014a presence that is often denied\nor erased.72\nIn the mid-twentieth century, although some fiction and nonfiction\ncontaining LGBTQ+ characters and themes was accepted by mainstream\npublishers, publishers typically refused to publish any work in which the\nLGBTQ+ characters had a happy ending or that seemed to promote homo-\nsexuality. Fiction was more common than nonfiction, because even if the\nfiction drew on the author\u2019s own experiences, writers could credibly avoid\npublic scandal. Self-censorship also played a role. For example, when\nThe Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank)\nwas first published in 1947, her father did not include the passages\nin which Anne wrote about her feelings toward women. This omission\nreflects Frank\u2019s desire to protect his daughter\u2019s privacy and reputation\nand to not distract from the main focus of Nazi oppression by including\ncontroversial material.73\nMost memoirs written by LGBTQ+ people who lived in the 1950s,\n1960s, or 1970s were published much later in their lives, after the 1969\nStonewall rebellion and further decades of gay activism made these topics\nless risky and controversial in the mainstream and after the authors had\nmore well-established careers. Examples in this category include Esther\nNewton\u2019s essays written in the 1970s and 1980s collected in Margaret\nMead Made Me Gay (2000) and her memoir My Butch Career (2018),\nAudre Lorde\u2019s The Cancer Journals (1980) and Zami: A New Spelling of\nMy Name (1982), Douglas Crimp\u2019s Before Pictures (2016), and Samuel R.\nDelany\u2019s Times Square Red, Times Square Blue (1999). In addition to pub-\nlishing life writing, these authors were also outspoken activists, academ-\nics, and artists, but their books were mostly published by small feminist\npublishers or university presses willing to publish LGBTQ+ scholarship.74\nThe 1980s brought the AIDS crisis, and the mass suffering of the\nLGBTQ+ community inspired many more memoirs and diaries, as people\nstruggled to cope with their own illness and the illnesses of their friends\nand loved ones. For example, the playwright Larry Kramer is now most\nfamous for The Normal Heart, a play about a man caring for his dying\nlover based on Kramer\u2019s own experiences. Kramer also published a col-\nlection of nonfiction called Reports from the Holocaust: The Story of an\nAIDS Activist.75 LGBTQ+ Literature 443\nAdditionally, even though more LGBTQ+ writers were able to get\ntheir life writing openly published during this period, some of the works\ndescribing mid-twentieth-century LGBTQ+ life still take the form of diaries\npublished posthumously. For example, Susan Sontag, who wrote about\nLGBTQ+ issues, including AIDS, across her career, wasn\u2019t publicly out\nas bisexual until 2000 and rarely spoke about it. Sontag\u2019s son published\nher diaries in two volumes in 2008 and 2012, in which she discusses\nher sexuality much more openly.76\nAlongside the legal and social gains made by the LGBTQ+ com-\nmunity from the 1990s onward, LGBTQ+ memoirs have also become\nincreasingly common, developing into a subgenre of their own complete\nwith common structures and tropes, discussed later. However, represen-\ntation is still an issue within this broader umbrella. Gay memoirs are\nthe most common and visible, with bisexual and trans memoirs being\nmuch harder to find. Within the already-small category of trans memoir,\nmost of the books are by trans women and trans men; as of early 2020,\nthere appear to be fewer than fifteen memoirs published in English that\nrepresent nonbinary or genderqueer lives. As with most forms of media,\nthe range of experiences reflected in LGBTQ+ memoir also reproduces\nother social inequities, including racism, sexism, and classism.\nThe modern age offers many more avenues for sharing life writing\nbeyond traditional publishing, including blogs, YouTube videos, and social\nmedia. Because anyone with internet access and a little bit of privacy\ncan use these platforms, the field of LGBTQ+ life writing is much more\ndiverse online.\nTropes and Themes in LGBTQ+ Memoir\nBecause most memoirs take a narrative form, they typically follow the\nsame structural patterns of fiction. Whether they follow the traditional\npattern of rising action, climax, and falling action or use another narrative\nstructure, almost all narrative requires some sort of conflict to engage\nthe reader. Some types of conflict and narrative arcs common in LGBTQ+\nmemoirs are the following:\n\u2022 gender or sexual self-discovery\n\u2022 coming out\n\u2022 living with AIDS\n\u2022 gaining sexual experience\n\u2022 physical and social transitioning 444 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\n\u2022 loneliness\n\u2022 struggling with intersecting social identities\nAdditionally, some memoirs written by LGBTQ+ authors may center on\nanother aspect of the author\u2019s life, so the conflict may not center around\nsexuality or gender identity at all.\nAside from the common conflicts and story arcs, many LGBTQ+\nmemoirs also share themes or grapple with common questions:\n\u2022 How to approach writing, knowing the stories will be seen\nas emblematic of the entire community?\n\u2022 How to write honestly while not perpetuating stereotypes?\n\u2022 How to write about loved ones who might not want to be\nwritten about?\n\u2022 What\u2019s the right balance between showing that the author\nis \u201cnormal\u201d versus embracing all the things that make the\nauthor different?\n\u2022 Should LGBTQ+ memoirs also always be activism?\n\u2022 Where is the line between an empowering self-representation\nand a dehumanizing self-commodification?\nAnother common theme that may surprise readers is that many LGBTQ+\nmemoirs spend a lot of time discussing the pieces of media that played\nvital roles in constructing the author\u2019s identity or identities. This is\nbecause, much of the time, LGBTQ+ people grow up not knowing any (or\nnot many) people like them or at least not people who are out. So they\nturn to books, movies, and other media to find role models and figure\nout who and what they want to be. One popular example of this is Fun\nHome: A Family Tragicomic, which is a memoir written as a comic book\n(a subgenre known as graphic memoir) by Alison Bechdel.77\nIn the book, Bechdel describes how, when she started college, she\ndidn\u2019t know any lesbians in real life, so she read as many books by and\nabout lesbians as she could find. She discusses only one or two of these\nbooks directly, but the illustrations show more than a dozen lesbian books\nscattered throughout the panels.\nHowever, important identity-forming stories aren\u2019t always viewed\npositively by LGBTQ+ memoirists. In Trans: A Memoir (2016), Juliet\nJacques explains that she didn\u2019t know she was a trans woman for a long\ntime, in part because all the representations of trans women she found\nin movies and books seemed very unlike her and all their stories focused LGBTQ+ Literature 445\non hormones and surgery. At that stage, she didn\u2019t think she wanted\nthose things; she just knew she liked wearing dresses and makeup. In\nthe book, Jacques spends a lot of time discussing her changing relation-\nships with words like gay, trans, transgender, transsexual, transvestite,\nhermaphrodite, and drag queen. If she had seen more positive and more\ndiverse stories by and about trans women to read during her teens and\ntwenties, she might have been saved a lot of confusion and pain.78\nThe role of LGBTQ+ narratives in giving LGBTQ+ youth a sense\nof comfort, identity, and community makes LGBTQ+ memoir especially\nimportant, since memoirs are real stories of real people. Therefore, how\nthese memoirs represent the queer experience is especially relevant.\nCriticisms of the Genre\nThe integral role LGBTQ+ narratives play for LGBTQ+ youth is also the\nsource of one of the major criticisms of the genre. What kinds of stories\nare being told or not told? What is romanticized? What experiences are\nbeing portrayed as integral to being LGBTQ+? The answers shape how\nqueer youth come to understand themselves and their place in the world.\nThe criticism of memoirs specifically is that if memoirs are narratives\nand narratives must have conflict, then most LGBTQ+ memoirs tell stories\nof queer conflict, pain, trauma, or suffering\u2014even if they end happily.\nJuliet Jacques, Maggie Nelson (The Argonauts, 2015) (figure 11.21), and\nFigure 11.21.\nMaggie Nelson\u2019s The\nArgonauts. (Deborah\nAmory.) 446 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nJacob Tobia (Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story, 2019) all consciously dis-\ncuss their concern over this issue in their memoirs, but none of them\nfind a conclusive answer. An overabundance of messaging that queerness\nequals suffering is harmful not only to LGBTQ+ youth, but also because\nit reinforces the fears of well-meaning parents who dread having an\nLGBTQ+ child because they believe that means their child will never be\nhappy.79 As Tobia puts it, \u201cThe classical trans narrative . . . glamorizes\ntrauma,\u201d and \u201cthose of us who don\u2019t fit the classical narrative end up\neither having our stories edited and reedited until they fit, or end up\nhaving our voices silenced. And that\u2019s fucked.\u201d80\nAnother issue in the field of LGBTQ+ memoir is the tension between\nself-representation and self-commodification and the need to please dif-\nferent audiences. Juliet Jacques openly states in her memoir that she\nwould have preferred to write a history of trans people in Britain or an\noverview of societal issues that trans people face, but publishers were\nonly interested in her narratives of her own experiences.\nJacob Tobia ponders their intended audience and purpose at length in\ntheir memoir, Sissy. On the one hand, they want to provide some of the\nnonbinary representation that they never had growing up. On the other\nhand, they hope parents of nonbinary kids will read the book to under-\nstand their own kids better. They\u2019re not \u201chere to teach you Transgender\n101,\u201d but they do also want to educate the public about the diversity and\ncomplexities of gender and identity, with their book as one lesson in a\nwide pool of experiences.81 In short, it\u2019s impossible to write for any one\nintended audience or literary purpose without leaving important things out.\nRepresentation and commodification become even more complicated\nwhen we consider people other than the author of a memoir. Tobia admits\ntheir parents are not always portrayed in a positive light in the book\nand talks openly about their discussions with each of them as they were\nwriting. Is it ethical to portray someone in a way they\u2019re not comfortable\nwith, even if they give you permission? In Fun Home, Alison Bechdel tells\nthe story not only of her relationship with her own lesbianism but also\nof her late father\u2019s relationship with his own sexuality. She reveals that\nher father repeatedly pursued teenage boys and had emotional problems\nthat Bechdel attributes to his sexual repression. Is she exploiting her\nfather\u2019s troubled life to write a compelling book?\nAn even more difficult example of this issue in LGBTQ+ memoir is\nin The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson. In the book, Nelson writes exten-\nsively about her relationship with her genderqueer partner, Harry, and\nher portrayal of their relationship and what it can reveal about gen-\nder, sexuality, and parenthood is one of the main reasons for its critical\nacclaim. However, in the book she says Harry is \u201ca very private person,\u201d\na self-described \u201cepileptic with a pacemaker . . . married to a strobe\nlight artist.\u201d When he read the first draft of the book, he said he felt LGBTQ+ Literature 447\nRead\nChoose and read a review from the Lambda Literary review collection\n(https://lambdaliterary.org/category/reviews/memoir/).\n\u2022 Where and how does the book you chose fit into the history\nand common themes of LGBTQ+ life writing as discussed in\nthis section?\n\u2022 Which of the common questions shared by LGBTQ+ life writ-\ning listed in the \u201cTropes and Themes in LGBTQ+ Memoir\u201d\nsection do you see represented in the book being reviewed?\n\u2022 This section brings up some tensions and complications in-\nherent in representing one\u2019s life and loved ones in a story to\nbe sold\u2014how building conflict into a narrative can feed into\na \u201cqueerness equals suffering\u201d message; how the publisher\u2019s\nview of the market or audience could influence how a story\nis told or if it is told at all; how the depiction of loved ones\ncan often be out of their control. How would you approach\nsome of these complications if you were going to write about\nyour life?\n\u201cunbeheld\u2014unheld, even,\u201d and he asked her, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just write\nsomething that will bear adequate witness to me, to us, to our happi-\nness?\u201d82 Nelson says that after that conversation, they went through\nthe draft together and discussed revisions that would make him feel\nmore accurately represented, and he even wrote some passages for her\nto include in the book later on. However, the situation of one partner\u2019s\ncareer depending on writing about her life, and the other partner feeling\ndeeply hurt, creates a complex web of emotions, pressures, and respon-\nsibilities that can\u2019t help but shape both the relationship and the book.\nDespite the ethical dilemmas inherent in the genre, LGBTQ+ mem-\noirs play an important role in queer activism, identity formation, and\nhistorical study. They provide an opportunity for LGBTQ+ people to share\ntheir stories with each other and with the world, for personal satisfaction\nand political action. The professional market for this genre continues to\nexpand, although it still lacks in much needed diversity, and the internet\nprovides billions more opportunities for people to read and share writing\nabout their own queer lives.\nKEY QUESTIONS\n\u2022 Are you familiar with any of the fields of LGBTQ+ literature\nexplored in this section?

Phillips\nINTRODUCTION\nWith a simple search, people can now access a wealth of online informa-\ntion about LGBTQ+ topics, especially if they are English speakers. And yet\nsearching for information online, figuring out what to ask, and choosing\nhow to word questions can still be frustrating. When conducting research\non an LGBTQ+ topic, people will have to use different search strategies\nand critical thinking skills to locate resources appropriate for academic\npurposes. We wrote this chapter to help people search for LGBTQ+ infor-\nmation and resources in an effective, mindful manner.\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR LGBTQ+\nRESEARCH\nWhen preparing to do research, it is important to learn about the com-\nmunity (or communities) that you have chosen to study. Awareness of\nLGBTQ+ terminology, identity development, and the living conditions of\nLGBTQ+ people will provide necessary context. Before you locate and\nevaluate LGBTQ+ information sources, consider the following points:\n\u2022 Many communities, one initialism: Remember that the\ninitialism\nLGBTQ+ initialism encompasses many diverse individuals Using the first letters\nand experiences. In fact, there are multiple formulations of of words to create an\nit (e.g., LGBTQIA, QUILTBAG), and letters sometimes serve abbreviation, for instance,\nmore than one function (e.g., \u201cQ\u201d for queer or questioning). LGBTQ+.\n461 462 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nIn this chapter, we use \u201cLGBTQ+\u201d to refer to a large spectrum\nof identities. When speaking about a particular population,\nhowever, more specific terms (e.g., gay, lesbian) may be more\nappropriate to use than an inclusive initialism because of the\ndifferences in experience among groups. Remember also that\nan individual might identify in multiple ways (e.g., a bisexual\ntransgender person).\n\u2022 Intersectional identities: The concept of intersectionality (a\ntheory of Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw) focuses on how interlocking\nsystems of oppression affect marginalized individuals.1 Re-\nmember to consider how other aspects of an individual\u2019s\nidentity (race, ethnicity, class, country of origin, religion, dis-\nability status, etc.) interact with their LGBTQ+ identity. Avoid\ntreating the different aspects of a person\u2019s identity separately,\nand instead engage in a holistic examination of the systems\nof privilege and marginalization that act on them.\n\u2022 Pronouns and binaries: Be careful not to make assumptions\nabout the individuals that you study. Use caution when ap-\nplying modern labels to a historical subject. If an individual\nrefers to themselves using particular pronouns, use those pro-\nnouns\u2014if they use zir, do not substitute their, for example.\nBe wary of binaries. Do not erase bisexuality or pansexuality\nby insisting on a gay-straight binary. Do not erase intersex or\nnonbinary individuals by insisting on a male-female binary.\nBe mindful of emergent terminology, the explicit identification\nof LGBTQ+ individuals, and the various experiences within\nthe LGBTQ+ community.\nCareful consideration of these topics will help you in later stages of your\nresearch as you begin to develop your question, form a search strategy,\nand synthesize the information that you find into a paper, presentation,\nor other form of scholarship.\nGETTING READY FOR RESEARCH\nConstructing Research Questions and Generating Keywords\nTo begin, write down the research questions that you have about your\ntopic. Writing research questions also helps you generate keywords for\nsearching. When constructing research questions, pay attention to the\nfollowing: A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 463\nFigure 12.1. Start your\nresearch with a well-formed\nresearch question. (Photo by\nEmily Morter on Unsplash.)\nYES OR NO QUESTIONS\nOften, the first attempt to write down a research question results in a\nyes or no question, like this:\nCan lesbians become parents?\nThe keywords in this question are \u201clesbians\u201d and \u201cparents,\u201d which could\npotentially retrieve a broad range of information resources about lesbian\nparents, or lesbians and how they raise children, or parents of lesbian\nchildren. The fact that resources exist about lesbian parents implies a\npositive response to this question, so the question answers itself. Here\nare some questions that you would need to answer with evidence from\nresearch, however:\nHow do lesbians become parents?\nHow do lesbians parent their children?\nWhat laws affect the ability of lesbians to have children or\nbecome parents?\nAPPROPRIATE USE OF LGBTQ+ TERMINOLOGY\nIn LGBTQ+ research, language is everything. Whether searching for infor-\nmation about a historical or current topic, familiarize yourself with the\nterminology used for (or by) LGBTQ+ people in that time, culture, and 464 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nplace, in addition to current LGBTQ+ terminology. This will help you locate\nresources and artifacts from that time period, perhaps produced by that\nculture, as well as resources written by modern researchers. There is also\nLGBTQ+ terminology that is out of date or that is now considered clinical\nlanguage used by medical researchers or biologists to describe nonhuman\nanimals and their behavior. Review the chapters and their \u201cResearch\nResources\u201d sections in this book for the most up-to-date LGBTQ+ termi-\nnology used in different disciplines.\nVALUE-LADEN OR COMPARATIVE LANGUAGE\nIt may seem intuitive to include terms like good, bad, positive, negative,\nproblem, challenge, and so on in research questions. Here is an example:\nAre there negative impacts of lesbian parenting on children?\nIncluding \u201cnegative\u201d in our keyword search will lead to biased results\nthat keep us from retrieving information that will allow us to interpret\nthe range of complexities on a topic for ourselves. To remove this bias,\nyou can revise the question to read more neutrally:\nWhat is the impact of lesbian parenting on children?\nQUESTIONS THAT ARE TOO SPECIFIC OR TOO BROAD\nScale your topic to the size of the project that you are undertaking. A\nresearch paper of ten pages or fewer, for example, should cover a narrow,\nfocused topic. It sounds tricky to scope your question so that it\u2019s broad\nenough to be included in multiple resources but narrow enough not to\nbe overwhelming, but you will be able to do it with some planning and\ninitial research.\ntruncation\nLet\u2019s start with a broad topic and try to narrow it appropriately:\nA word-search method\nusing the root of a word\nWhat support systems exist for LGBT* people?\nwithin a title or keyword\nsearch regardless of the\n\u201cLGBT*\u201d (the asterisk is used for truncation searches2) is an abbreviation\nword ending. An asterisk\n(*) in many databases applying to many diverse individuals, each with their own experience.\nsignifies that the search The phrase \u201csupport systems\u201d is also vague. It might refer to personal\nshould include multiple support systems, governmental programs, nonprofit or community orga-\nword endings. nizations, or online resources and communities. Entire handbooks and A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 465\nencyclopedias are needed to answer such a broad question. For a smaller\nproject, narrow the question to focus on a particular population, location,\nor type of service.\nIt is also possible to narrow down the topic too much:\nWhat community organizations exist to support lesbian Somali\nrefugee youth in Minnesota?\nAlthough this is an excellent question, there may not be enough infor-\nmation about this specific population in this specific location. It is worth\na try, but may retrieve too few search results (or none at all). You might\nhave to broaden the search terms to retrieve results that may answer the\nquestion or remove some search terms, like so:\nWhat organizations exist to support lesbian Somali refugee\nyouth?\nRemoving the location-specific aspect may help the researcher locate more\ngeneral information that would still apply to the population of interest in\nMinnesota. Removing \u201ccommunity\u201d but including \u201corganizations\u201d might\nalso generalize your search and reduce the number of results about spe-\ncific community organizations outside your area of interest. If this search\nstill retrieved too few results, you might alter it to be slightly broader:\nWhat organizations exist to support lesbian Somali youth?\nRemoving \u201crefugee\u201d as a keyword in this search increases the possibility\nof locating information about Somali youth and their coming out process\nin general, which has the potential to include the coming out process for\nSomali refugee youth, immigrant youth, or Somali youth who were born\nin the country where they currently reside.\nAfter doing some research, you may need to revisit the scope of primary sources\nyour topic because it is still too broad or too narrow. Don\u2019t be discour- Firsthand records and\ndocuments or original\naged\u2014this is part of the research process!\nartifacts that are\nanalyzed, studied, and\nInformation Availability\ninterpreted. They include\npoems, legal documents,\nWhen you have your keywords test them out by deciding where you want\nrecordings, and any\nto search. Researching a historical event will likely involve sources such\nother direct evidence of a\nas books, journal articles, or primary sources from online or physical\nhistorical person, event,\narchives. Writing about a current event, however, may require locating\nor topic. 466 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nrecent developments in the news or social media in addition to materials\nthat inform the historical context. Thinking about the types of sources that\nyou expect to find and consult will help you decide whether you need to\nsearch in a database, a library catalog, a search engine, or all these sources.\nIt is also important to consider what sources might not be available.\nYou might not be able to find explicitly LGBTQ+ sources created in a\nrepressive context. LGBTQ+ people in seventeenth-century English colo-\nnies with strict sodomy law enforcement and witch trials probably did not\nwrite openly about themselves, if they could write at all. People would\nnot have used the terminology that we might use today to describe their\nsexual orientation or gender identity. Secondary sources such as books\nand articles present information about the lives of LGBTQ+ people in\nsuch contexts based on the authors\u2019 research using primary documents.\nSometimes these sources can guide you to the primary documents, which\nyou might be able to consult for yourself. See the later section \u201cFrom the\nArchives: Historical LGBTQ+ Primary Source Material\u201d for more informa-\ntion about archival sources.\nOnce you\u2019ve thought about what kind of information you expect to\nfind, start using the keywords that you generated when creating your\nresearch question. For tips on translating research questions into lan-\nguage that databases can understand, consult Walden University Library\u2019s\nguide on keyword searching and connecting keywords.3\nTip\nSAFETY FIRST: ONLINE PRIVACY\nNot all people enjoy the same level of freedom or privacy in online\nsearching. Public computer terminals may have internet filters on\nthem to prevent people from searching for LGBTQ+ content. Corpo-\nrations may collect personal data from researchers in the attempt to\nsell products or promote content. If someone lives in a country where\nLGBTQ+ identities are criminalized, online research on LGBTQ+ top-\nics may put them at risk, even if they use their own mobile device.\nActive U.S. military may also have their online activities monitored.\nIn cases such as these, where concerns about surveillance and pri-\nvacy exist, it is important to take precautions before searching for\nLGBTQ+ information or connecting with LGBTQ+ communities online.\nReview \u201cOnline Privacy: Using the Internet Safely,\u201d a guide from the\nPrivacy Rights Clearinghouse, before doing online research to preserve\nyour privacy and security (https://privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/\nonline-privacy-using-internet-safely). A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 467\nSEARCHING FOR LGBTQ+ INFORMATION\nLibrary Resources\nColleges and universities offer a wealth of information through their print\nbook collections, databases, and other research materials. Your public\nlibrary may have access to some databases and research materials as well.\nIn the United States, libraries have pledged to uphold the secrecy\nof patron borrowing records. The American Library Association has a\n\u201cLibrary Bill of Rights\u201d and associated interpretation.4 If you are inter-\nested in a history of LGBTQ+ information in libraries, the Wikipedia page\n\u201cLibraries and the LGBTQ Community\u201d has more information.5\nLGBTQ+ studies is highly interdisciplinary. This means that you\nmay find relevant resources from several academic disciplines that adopt\nLGBTQ+ theories and research methods or that study LGBTQ+ popula-\ntions, cultures, histories, and issues. Your library catalog is a good place\nto search for a wide range of information sources in various disciplines.\nThe online library catalog allows people to look for books, e-books, media,\nonline resources, and other content that the library owns or to which it\nhas access. Visit your library website or consult with your librarian to\nlearn about your particular library catalog\u2019s features and interface.\nPhysical items are organized by call number. LGBTQ+ specific call\nnumbers exist in the two major systems. Kristine Nowak and Amy Jo\nMitchell identify and challenge the Library of Congress\u2019s LGBTQ+ call\nnumbers, and Doreen Sullivan identifies and problematizes the Dewey\ndecimal classification\u2019s LGBTQ+ call numbers.6 Because LGBTQ+ studies\ncrosses disciplines, you will likely find books on your topic in different\ncall number sections.\nLibraries such as Ohio Wesleyan University Libraries often use\nLibrary of Congress subject headings to classify their materials. Searching\nsimultaneously for LGBTQ+ materials in the library catalog according to\nthe subject headings with keyword searching may retrieve more relevant\nresults than keyword searching alone. The librarians at Indiana Univer-\nsity Bloomington have generated a helpful list of the LGBTQ+ Library of\nCongress subject headings that currently exist; this list will continue to\nevolve over time (figure 12.2).7\nStudents and faculty at academic institutions have access to aca-\ndemic databases. Databases include e-book collections, journal articles or\ntheir abstracts, streaming media (videos or audio files), and data sets.\nThese resources are curated, organized, and described so that they can\nbe searched with precision. These databases are often not accessible to\nanyone without an official user ID and password issued by the academic 468 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 12.2. Some of Indiana\nUniversity Bloomington\u2019s\nLGBTQ Library of Congress\nsubject headings.\ninstitution. Public libraries may provide access to some databases, and\nsome (but not all) academic institutions offer access to online resources\nfor those who visit in person. Not all libraries have research databases\nexclusively on LGBTQ+ subjects, but almost all academic libraries have\ngeneral databases that index materials that support LGBTQ+ studies. We\nrecommend the databases available for LGBTQ+ studies research listed\nin table 12.1.\nTable 12.1. Databases\nGeneral academic LGBTQ+ studies\nAcademic Search Premier (EBSCO) Archives of Sexuality and Gender\nAlternative Press Archive LGBT Life Full Text (EBSCO)\nAlternative Press Index LGBT Thought and Culture\nGenderWatch\nJSTOR\nProQuest\nPsycINFO\nSAGE Full Text\nSociological Abstracts\nSocial Sciences Full Text\nWomen\u2019s Studies International A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 469\nLike library catalogs, databases often also use subject headings.\nSome databases have their own preferred subject headings for LGBTQ+\ntopics, so it is best to use those preferred search terms and subject\nheadings even if they may not be familiar or the most acceptable ter-\nminology. Some databases still prefer the search term and subject head-\ning \u201chomosexual\u201d to \u201cgay,\u201d for example, so you will need to include\nthose problematic terms when searching those databases. The Directory\nof Open Access Journals, which makes scholarly journal articles in mul-\ntiple languages freely available, is particularly problematic in its index-\ning, because it has no subject headings or preferred keywords specific\nto LGBTQ+ topics.8 Using this directory will involve multiple searches\nusing different keywords. You can often find a link to the list of subject\nheadings used by a particular database on the search page by looking\nfor a \u201cThesaurus\u201d link. A librarian can help you with this if you get\nstuck.\nMost college and university libraries make available respected,\npeer-reviewed LGBTQ+ journals, although library access to these journals\nvaries. Notable examples of journals appropriate for academic research\ninclude the Journal of Homosexuality, the Journal of LGBTQ Youth, and\nGLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies.\nThe Journal of Homosexuality, established in 1976, features articles\nthat explore gender and sexual identities and communities from a vari-\nety of disciplinary perspectives (https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/\nwjhm20). The Journal of LGBTQ Youth, established in 2008, is a forum\nfor improving the lives of LGBTQ+ youth. It contains first-person narra-\ntives by young people, practitioner reports, and research-based scholar-\nship (https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/wjly20). GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian\nand Gay Studies, established in 1991, publishes interdisciplinary articles\nfocused on sex and sexuality (https://read.dukeupress.edu/glq).\nDatabases usually provide an abstract, or summary, of an individ-\nual journal article, but not all provide the full text of the articles. Many\nlibraries have systems that either link to the full text or direct you to\nrequest it through interlibrary loan, but every library does this a little bit\ndifferently. If you are having trouble accessing the full text of an article,\ncontact your librarian for help.\nAlthough the authors of books and journal articles analyze and\nwrite about the impact of laws, culture, religion, or other elements of\ncivilization on LGBTQ+ people\u2014or how LGBTQ+ people themselves affect\nthose things\u2014it is important to read and interpret those laws, policies,\nand original documents yourself. For this reason, let\u2019s move ahead to\ntalk about government documents and primary sources. 470 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 12.3. An article from\nan issue of the academic\njournal Sexualities. (CC-BY\nRalf Lottmann, Andrew King,\nSexualities, Sage Journals.)\nLaws, Reports, and Government-Provided\nHealth Information\nGovernments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations\n(UN), and advocacy groups all publish information related to LGBTQ+\npopulations. This information includes laws from different countries; NGO,\nUN, and advocacy-group reports about conditions for LGBTQ+ people or A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 471\nhow particular laws affect these populations; and information related to\nLGBTQ+ health issues, including HIV/AIDS, women\u2019s health issues, and\ntransgender health issues.\nWe often learn about laws or policies that affect LGBTQ+ populations\nthrough popular media. Journalists and bloggers often give a law or policy\na short, catchy name, but the actual name of the law may be much longer.\nFor example, the Russian \u201cgay propaganda law\u201d that people refer to in the\nmedia is actually a section of Russian Federation Federal Law no. 436-\nFZ of 2010-12-23, on Protection of Children from Information Harmful\nto Their Health and Development, titled \u201cFor the Purpose of Protecting\nChildren from Information Advocating for a Denial of Traditional Family\nValues.\u201d You can find this out by conducting a search in Google or other\nsearch engines, asking, \u201cWhat is the real name of the gay propaganda\nlaw?\u201d If you use the official name of the law in your search, the results\nwill be more likely to come from official government or NGO reports.\nBecause of unique methods of organizing information in governmen-\ntal and legal fields, finding sources such as governmental publications,\nbills, or court cases may require the assistance of a librarian. For more\ninformation about different types of government documents, consult the\n\u201cGovernment Publications\u201d subject guide from St. Cloud State University\ndeveloped by the research librarian Michael Gorman.9 You might also see\nif your library has its own guide on this topic.\nGovernments often provide health information to the public, includ-\ning health information for or about LGBTQ+ people. In the United States,\nthe federal government is the country\u2019s largest publisher. To search for\ncongressional recordings, Supreme Court opinions, congressional bills,\nand other documents on how the federal government refers to LGBTQ+\npopulations and topics, visit https://www.govinfo.gov. To search across\ndifferent government websites, go to https://www.usa.gov. The easiest\nway to locate laws and government information from other countries is to\nuse a search engine. A Northwestern University government information\nlibrarian, Anne Zald, also created an excellent list of foreign government\nwebsites.10 If you are interested in government health information for or\nabout LGBTQ+ people in other countries, you can try adding the name of\nthe country to the search string. If you are unable to locate anything that\nway, search within the government\u2019s official website for more information.\nThe UN provides statistics and reports about LGBT demographics,\nhealth, laws, and human rights abuses. The search string \u201cunited nations\nLGBT*\u201d retrieves information from the UN about resolutions and reports\non LGBT issues worldwide. Other NGOs and advocacy groups may also\nprovide similar reports.\nSometimes LGBTQ+ people seek out legal or medical advice for per-\nsonal matters from library resources. Although the library can assist 472 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\npeople in locating information on laws, policies, and health, only lawyers\nor doctors can provide counsel for legal or medical decisions. Consult\nwith a lawyer, medical professional, NGO, or advocacy group friendly to\nLGBTQ+ people for help with personal legal or medical issues.\nFrom the Archives: Historical LGBTQ+ Primary Source Material\nSometimes you need to find primary sources for your topic.11 LGBTQ+\nstudies research depends on primary sources to see firsthand how LGBTQ+\npeople existed in the past and exist in the present. Primary sources can\nbe in physical and digital formats. Archives are curated collections of\nprimary sources that are preserved for their historic or cultural signifi-\ncance. Archives are organized, curated, and described by archivists and\nother archival workers.\nArchival LGBTQ+ content is important for several reasons: It often\nprovides historical perspective on the topic you are studying and informs\nyour research to prevent ahistorical claims from sneaking into your\nargument. Archival material provides firsthand accounts, photographs,\naudiovisual material, contemporary reactions to people and ideas, and\nephemera (e.g., buttons, flyers, posters, and other objects). Archives are\nimportant for research also because they collect materials that are based\non some shared characteristic (e.g., they all belonged to one person, or\nthey document a particular event, time period, movement, or organiza-\ntion). This allows the researcher to encounter multiple archival objects\nalongside related objects and thereby gain some historical or thematic\nperspective. Objects from archives specific to LGBTQ+ issues may also\nexpose you to content in individuals\u2019 own voices, which can add another\ndimension to your knowledge about a topic.\nWatch\nOne of the oldest archives of LGBTQ+ material in the United States is\nheld in Los Angeles. Watch this video about the ONE National Gay and\nLesbian Archives to get an idea of what LGBTQ+ archives do and what\nthey collect: (https://youtu.be/Pe6ko6XejHc).\n\u2022 Do you think it is important to collect and curate historical\nartifacts? Explain.\n\u2022 What is the most interesting thing you learned about LGBTQ+\nhistory from watching this video?\n\u2022 If you had unlimited time and resources, what LGBTQ+ ar-\nchive would you work to create? Why? A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 473\nArchives dedicated to LGBTQ+ material exist around the world.\nTo find such archives, IHLIA LGBT Heritage of Amsterdam maintains\nan extensive list of links to worldwide LGBTQ+ archives.12 Sometimes\narchives without an LGBTQ+ focus will create special exhibits related to\nLGBTQ+ individuals and content in their collections as well.\nArchives are often collections of physical materials, digital content,\nor both. Often, a researcher will visit a physical archive in person to\nreview materials. Many archives make information about their materials\navailable online so that you can decide whether the content is likely to\nbe relevant to your project. If you are a student at a college or university,\ncheck with your library; your institution may have archival collections\nof its own. Digital archives offer more access, but keep in mind that the\ndigital collection might not include everything from the physical collection.\nThe following resources are good places to begin searching for digital\nprimary source materials:\n\u2022 Library of Congress Digital Collections. \u201cLGBTQ+ Studies: A\nResource Guide.\u201d13\n\u2022 IHLIA LGBT Heritage. The primary source materials from Eu-\nropean LGBTQ+ organizations on this website have a focus\non Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.14\n\u2022 OutHistory.org. Created by pioneering LGBTQ+ historian Jon-\nathan Ned Katz, this website is an online digital archive of\nprimary source LGBTQ+ materials.15\nA Note on Search Engines\nDatabases and library catalogs collect and organize a specific set of\nresources for research purposes that can be accessed through browsing\nor searching. Search engines do not curate or organize information at\nall. Instead, a search engine such as Google uses the keywords that you\nenter to search publicly accessible internet content. This is why a search\nin Google will result in hundreds of thousands of results on a topic,\nincluding shopping sites, blogs, and news sites, of inconsistent quality,\nwhereas your database search will generally return a smaller set of more\nspecific results.\nWhen discussing search, it is impossible to ignore the role of Google\nand Google Scholar. See the later section \u201cBiases and LGBTQ+ Information\nAvailability\u201d for more information about algorithmic bias at work when\nyou search for information. Remember also that data is collected about\nyou when you interact with most online platforms and that your data\nis valuable; Google isn\u2019t the only offender, but as a company it has an 474 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nenormous reach. You have a choice of search engines, and some have\nbetter privacy practices and take user privacy and safety into account.16\nWith those caveats in mind, know that Google remains the most\nfrequently used search engine in the world. To keep up to date on Google\nsearch strategies, tools, and features, refer to the Google Support Center,\nas well as the Google Advanced Search page. Helpful articles from online\nmagazines LifeHack and PC Mag also provide great Google tricks.17 Google\nScholar is a popular and accessible search engine for retrieving abstracts,\nfull-text scholarly journal articles, e-books, and government and NGO\nreports. For a complete rundown on Google Scholar features and how to\nuse the tool, visit the Google Scholar Search Tips page.18\nSocial Media for LGBTQ+ Studies Research\nFor LGBTQ+ topics, social media may be a good source of information.\nYou might be surprised to learn that researchers, scholars, activists, and\nothers that you might encounter during your research may also be active\non social media. Blogs, Twitter, or YouTube can help you find emerging\nresearch in the field. Researchers and scholars may post presentation\nmaterials from academic conferences, scholarly journal articles, book rec-\nommendations, or critiques of other people\u2019s research. Social media can\nhelp students and people new to an academic or professional field get to\nknow other researchers and relevant organizations in their field. These\nresearcher and organization accounts might also point you toward job\npostings, graduate programs, or conferences. Social media can also have\nits dark side; harassment and algorithmic bias are problems that you\nshould be aware of if you decide to work with social media for research\npurposes.19\nResearchers can conduct basic keyword searches or tag and hashtag\nsearches on most social media platforms. Twitter in particular has sophis-\nticated advanced search features.20 Because of the many LGBTQ+ terms\nand abbreviations that are used, it may be necessary to repeat the hashtag\nsearch for the most comprehensive results.\nConducting academic research using social media brings a unique\nset of challenges. Although these conversations are happening in pub-\nlic, they are not necessarily public statements. Think about any random\nconversation you have had that occurred in a public place. Would you\nwant a researcher to quote you without your knowledge? Consider the\nfollowing when using social media for research.\n\u2022 What is the source of the content? The researcher should\nbe mindful of whether they\u2019re quoting an individual, a non- A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 475\nprofit organization, a for-profit organization, a news agency,\na government source, or some other source. As with any\nsource, the researcher must evaluate the source in terms of\nits authority on the issue at hand, potential bias, and other\nquestions such as those found in the later \u201cEvaluating In-\nformation Sources\u201d section and associated resources (such as\nthe guide from Pennsylvania State University21).\n\u2022 How can I use this content? Researchers should remember\nthat not all social media networks are public. A post that ap-\npears in one researcher\u2019s social media feeds may be viewable\nby only certain accounts. Even users with public social media\npresence may have some expectation that their posts will not\nbe republished without their consent.22 If your research proj-\nect will be published in a public forum where others could\nsee this content, it is good practice to contact the creator,\ninform them of your research project, and ask permission to\nuse their content. User-created content may also be protected\nby copyright. The University of Michigan Library provides\ninformation on what types of videos are appropriate to use\nfor openly published research projects, as well as where to\nfind those videos.23\nIn addition to these more socially focused platforms, another platform\nwith a highly social infrastructure is designed for information creation\nand research: Wikipedia.\nWikipedia for LGBTQ+ Studies Research\nWikipedia can serve as a starting point for research on LGBTQ+ top-\nics. It is also a major source of information for many people, including\nresearchers who do not have access to databases or research libraries.\nLet\u2019s examine how to use Wikipedia to research LGBTQ+ topics.\nAn efficient way to search for LGBTQ+ content on Wikipedia is to\nvisit the LGBT Portal. The portal compiles news related to LGBTQ+ issues\nand has a section for daily featured LGBTQ+ content (figure 12.4).24\nTo evaluate the content of a Wikipedia article, you must first under-\nstand how knowledge production works on Wikipedia. Wikipedia does\nnot publish original content. Instead, creators summarize and synthesize\ncontent already published in another venue. Wikipedia editors strive to\nmeet certain expectations for an article.25 Reviewers identify articles that\nneed editing or that they believe should be deleted, and creators can then\ndefend the article or help improve it so that it can remain in Wikipedia. 476 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nFigure 12.4. The LGBT Portal on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:LGBT. (CC-BY-SA Wikipedia.\norg.)\nThis process has its shortcomings, however. For example, articles about\nimportant yet underdocumented individuals or topics (including articles\nabout LGBTQ+ people of color and LGBTQ+ people from non-English\nspeaking countries) may be marked for deletion because of the lack\nof published information about them, despite their importance to the\nLGBTQ+ community or the world. For more on bias in Wikipedia (and\nthe world), see Wikipedia\u2019s page on systemic bias.26\nWhen a relevant article exists and is identified, you must review\nseveral parts of the article to determine whether the content is appropriate\nfor academic research. One of us, Rachel Wexelbaum, developed a subject\nguide on how to evaluate Wikipedia articles for research.27\nWhen you find instances of bias or underrepresentation on Wiki-\npedia, remember that you can participate in the process! Wikipedia is a\nliving resource that depends on global community participation and col-\nlaboration, and thus students and professors can put their LGBTQ+ stud-\nies research skills to good use by adding information to existing articles,\ncreating articles, and improving articles that are partial starts, or stubs.\nEVALUATING INFORMATION SOURCES\nCarefully consider each source that you find while researching to deter-\nmine whether it adds useful, accurate information to your research. See\nthe Penn State University Libraries guide on evaluating information and A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 477\nthe associated rubric for more good questions to ask to determine the\nquality of a source.28\nSome specific questions may shape your evaluation of sources\nfocused on LGBTQ+ topics:\n\u2022 Is the source authoritative? Authority can derive from the\nauthor having studied the topic, but it can also come from\nhaving experience with the topic. Academic authors, even\nthose who identify as LGBTQ+, may offer insights that are\ndifferent from LGBTQ+ individuals writing in other venues. A\nconsideration of authority will also help weed out bad-faith\nactors and insufficiently informed perspectives.\n\u2022 Is the source biased? Although all authors are influenced by\ntheir perspectives, sometimes the strength of that viewpoint\ncan lead to an incomplete, misleading, or untrue presentation\nof information. For example, information presented by the\nanti-LGBTQ+ group Focus on the Family or the pro-LGBTQ+\ngroup the Human Rights Campaign may have a political agen-\nda. When evaluating information related to LGBTQ+ issues,\nbe sure to pay extra attention to questions related to point\nof view or bias.29\n\u2022 Is the LGBTQ+ terminology used in the source appropriate\nfor your research? Sometimes a source will use terminology\nand information that is not current. Consider the scope of\nyour topic. If you are conducting historical research, different\nterminology may have been in use. There is also a history\nof reclamation of derogatory terms by marginalized commu-\nnities. Then consider whether the source was one that was\nlikely to have been written in good faith. Is it by members\nof the LGBTQ+ community writing about themselves or by\nwell-informed LGBTQ+ allies? Or is it by a group or individual\nthat is hostile toward LGBTQ+ individuals? Historical sources\nrequire an evaluation process similar to more current sourc-\nes, but you may need to conduct a little research about the\nparticular time period before you are able to fully evaluate a\nhistorical or archival source.\nAll these questions will give you some idea of the relative trustworthiness\nof a source, although further scrutiny may of course be necessary. You\nmay also need to go back and reevaluate your determination of accuracy\nas you learn more about your topic. 478 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies\nBIASES AND LGBTQ+ INFORMATION\nAVAILABILITY\nDepending on your research topic, you may retrieve multiple results that\nseem good enough. At the same time, you may not be able to construct a\ncomplete picture from your findings because of the overrepresentation of\ncertain types of information and the underrepresentation of others. This\nwill affect the LGBTQ+ information available to you, and it may result in\nrendering particular people, histories, cultures, or events invisible.\nA wealth of LGBTQ+ studies scholarship is published in English-\nspeaking countries, composed by people (predominantly white, cisgender,\nand able bodied) from those countries. These scholars have more often\nhad the freedom, institutional support, and access to publishing plat-\nforms necessary to disseminate their research than have scholars in some\nother countries. Although LGBTQ+ studies is emerging as a discipline\nin other countries, research conducted in languages other than English\noften remains local. This means that the experiences of LGBTQ+ people\nin non-English-speaking countries often do not get heard, and informa-\ntion about non-English-speaking LGBTQ+ cultures may be more difficult\nto find. This bias is reflected in other places as well or perpetuated by\nWikipedia\u2019s practices.\nTip\nCOMPILING AND ORGANIZING CONTENT RETRIEVED FROM\nLIBRARY CATALOGS AND DATABASES\nAfter locating helpful resources for your research, you need to store\nthe content somewhere. You also need to organize the content so that\nyou can transform it into a bibliography or works-cited page for your\nresearch assignment. Using a citation manager is the safest, most effi-\ncient way to save and manage research resources. Mel Johnson of the\nUniversity of Maine Raymond H. Fogler Library has produced a clear\nsubject guide on how to select and use a citation manager (https://\nlibguides.library.umaine.edu/CitationManagers).\nSearch engines such as Google can be powerful tools in your search\nprocess, but the processes underlying searching online require some cri-\ntique. How Google\u2019s search algorithm works is a closely guarded secret,\nbecause Google is a company designed to create profit through services\nsuch as search. Remember that algorithms are created by people and can-\nnot therefore be neutral; instead, they re-create human biases, which can A Practical Guide for LGBTQ+ Studies 479\ncreep into your information retrieval process. Because you do not know\nhow the algorithm works, why an item appears higher on the results\npage than another is hidden from you. This is why simply looking at\nthe first result returned by Google or by a database is not a reliable way\nof finding the most appropriate sources for your research. This chapter\ncan\u2019t fully delve into the politics of search; to learn more, read Farhad\nManjoo\u2019s article about bias in Google searches or consult Safiya Umoja\nNoble\u2019s Algorithms of Oppression.30\nTo reduce some of this bias in search results, make sure to do enough\nbackground research so that you can use several appropriate search terms\nand can identify results that you retrieve that are not relevant or are\nproblematic. Use the technique of iterative searching by trying multiple\nsearches on different platforms and perhaps even in different disciplinary\ndatabases. Finally, make sure to periodically check the assumptions that\nyou are making about your subject matter to try to ascertain some of\nyour own preconceptions and biases as a researcher.\nCONCLUSION\nThe overview in this chapter will help you begin your research project.\nThrough refining your topic, gathering research materials from various\nsources, and evaluating different pieces of information, you can begin\nanswering the questions you developed at the beginning of your search.\nResearching subjects related to LGBTQ+ issues presents some unique\nchallenges because of the fraught nature of certain topics and requires\ncertain ethical and privacy considerations. The other chapters in this\nbook should give you an idea of different ways that you might approach\nLGBTQ+ research, in addition to providing you with deeper knowledge\nabout the topics covered.\nGLOSSARY\ninitialism.
