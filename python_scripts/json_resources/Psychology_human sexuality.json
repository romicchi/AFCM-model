Their cultural settings influence\ntheir patterns of sexual behavior and the pleasure they gain\u2014or fail to\ngain\u2014from sex. Sex may be a natural function, but few natural functions have\nbeen influenced so strongly by religious and moral beliefs, cultural tradition,\nfolklore, and superstition.\nWe are about to embark on the study of human sexuality. But why study human\nsexuality? Isn\u2019t sex something to do rather than to talk about? Isn\u2019t sex a natural\nfunction? Don\u2019t we learn what we need to know from personal experience or from\nour parents or our friends?\nYes. And no. We can learn how our bodies respond to sexual stimulation\nthrough personal experience, but experience teaches us little about the biology of\nsexual response and orgasm. Nor does experience inform us about the variations\nin sexual behavior that exist around the world. Experience does not prepare us to\nrecognize the signs of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or to evaluate the risks\nof pregnancy. What many of us learned about sex from our parents can probably be\nsummarized in a single word: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The information we received from our friends\nwas probably riddled with exaggeration, even lies. Many young people today receive\naccurate information through sex education courses in the schools, but they are usu-\nally taught about STIs and contraception, not about sexual techniques.\nYou may know more about human sexuality than your parents or grandparents\ndid at your age, or do today. But how much do you really know? What causes an\nerection or vaginal lubrication? What factors determine sexual orientation? What\nare sexual dysfunctions and what causes them? How do our sexual responsiveness\nand interests change as we age? Can you contract a sexually transmitted infection\nand not know it? If you have no symptoms, can you infect others?\nThese are just a few of the issues we will explore in this book .

This is not a trick question. Consider the meaning, or\nrather meanings, of the word sex . One use of the term sex refers to our anatomic\nsex, male or female. The words s ex or sexual are also used to refer to anatomic\nstructures, called sex organs or sexual organs, that play a role in reproduction or\nsexual pleasure. We may also speak of sex when referring to physical activities\ninvolving our sex organs for purposes of reproduction or pleasure, as in h aving sex .\nSex also relates to erotic feelings, experiences, or desires, such as sexual fantasies\nand thoughts, sexual urges, or feelings of sexual attraction.\nMany researchers reserve the word s ex for reference to anatomic or biological\ncategories, but prefer the word g ender when they are referring to social or cul-\ntural categories. For example, one might say that \u201creproductive anatomy appears\nto depend on the s ex (not the g ender ) of the individual, but in so-called traditional\nsocieties, g ender roles (not sex roles ) are often seen as polar opposites.\u201d\nThe term human sexuality refers to the ways in which we experience and express\nourselves as sexual beings. Our awareness of ourselves as females or males is part of\nour sexuality, as is the capacity we have for erotic experiences and responses. Our\nWatch the Video knowledge of the gender roles in our culture also has a profound influence on us.\nThe Big Picture: The Power of Sex\non MyDevelopmentLab\nTHE STUDY OF HUMAN SEXUALITY\nThe study of human sexuality draws on the scientific expertise of anthropologists,\nbiologists, medical researchers, sociologists, and psychologists, to name some of the\nprofessional groups involved in the field. These disciplines all make contributions,\nbecause human sexuality reflects biological capabilities, psychological characteris-\ntics, and social and cultural influences. Biologists inform us about the physiological\nmechanisms of sexual arousal and response. Medical science teaches us about STIs\nand the biological bases of sexual dysfunctions. Psychologists examine how our\nsexual behavior and attitudes are shaped by perception, learning, thought, moti-\nvation and emotion, and personality. Sociocultural theorists examine relationships\nbetween sexual behavior and religion, race, and social class. Anthropologists focus\non cross-cultural similarities and differences in sexual behavior.\n1 T TRUTH OR FICTION REVISITED: Although science provides us with informa-\nF\ntion, it cannot make sexual decisions for us.

Watch the Video\nSpecial Topics: Cultural Norms\nVALUE SYSTEMS FOR MAKING SEXUAL DECISIONS and Sexual Behavior\non MyDevelopmentLab\nAlthough sex is a natural function, most of us choose how, where, and with whom\nto become sexually involved.

Should I be tested for HIV (the virus that\ncauses AIDS)? Should I insist that my partner be tested for HIV before we have sex?\nValue systems provide a framework for judging the moral acceptability of sexual\noptions. We often approach sexual decisions by determining whether the choices we\nface are compatible with our moral values. Our value systems\u2014our sexual standards\u2014\nhave many sources: parents, peers, religious training, ethnic subcultures, the larger\nculture, and our appraisal of all these influences. Value systems include legalism, situ-\national ethics, ethical relativism, hedonism, asceticism, utilitarianism, and rationalism.\nLegalism The legalistic approach formulates ethical behavior on the basis of a\ncode of moral laws derived from an external source, such as a religion. The Hebrew\nand Christian Bibles contain many examples of the moral code of the Jewish and\nChristian religions. In the Book of Leviticus (20:10\u201317) in the Hebrew Bible we\nfind many of the prohibitions against adultery, incest, sexual activity with people of\none\u2019s own gender, and bestiality:\n10: And the man that committeth adultery with another man\u2019s wife, even he\nthat committeth adultery with his neighbour\u2019s wife, the adulterer and the adul-\nteress shall surely be put to death.\n11: And the man that lieth with his father\u2019s wife hath uncovered his father\u2019s naked-\nness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\n12: And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put\nto death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.\n13: If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them\nhave committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood\nshall be upon them.\n14: And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be\nburnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.\n15: And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall\nslay the beast.\n16: And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt\nkill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood\nshall be upon them.\n17: And if a man shall take his sister, his father\u2019s daughter, or his mother\u2019s\ndaughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing;\nand they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his\nsister\u2019s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.\n18: And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, 1 and shall uncover\nher nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the\nfountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.\n1 That is, menstruation.\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 55 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM 6 CHAPTER 1 What Is Human Sexuality?\nMany religious followers accept the moral codes of their religions as a matter\nof faith and commitment. Some people find it reassuring to be informed by religious\nauthorities or scripture that a certain course of action is right or wrong. Others,\nhowever, take a more liberal view. They say that the Bible reflects the social setting\nof the time in which it was written, not just divine inspiration. Now that population\ngrowth is exploding in many parts of the world, biblical injunctions to be fruitful\nand multiply may no longer be socially and environmentally sound. Prohibitions,\nsuch as that against sexual relations during menstruation, may have been based on\nprescientific perceptions of danger. Some people thus view religious teachings as a\ngeneral framework for decision making rather than as a set of absolute rules.\nS ituational Ethics Episcopal theologian Joseph Fletcher (1966, 1967) argued\nthat ethical decision making should be guided by love for others rather than by rigid\nmoral rules, and that sexual decision making should be based on the context of the\nsituation that the person faces. For this reason, his view is termed s ituational ethics.\nAccording to Fletcher, a Roman Catholic woman will have been taught that abor-\ntion is the taking of a human life. Her situation, however\u2014her love for her exist-\ning family and her recognition of her limited resources for providing for another\nchild\u2014might influence her to decide in favor of an abortion.\nFletcher argues that rules for conduct should be flexible. \u201cThe situationist is\nprepared in any concrete case to suspend, ignore, or violate any principle if by doing\nso he can effect more good than by following it\u201d (1966, p. 34).\nEthical Relativism E thical relativism assumes that diverse values are basic to\nhuman existence. Ethical relativists reject the idea that there is a single correct moral\nview about subjects as diverse as wearing revealing clothing, masturbation, pre-\nmarital sex, oral sex, anal sex, contraception, and abortion. One person may believe\nthat premarital sex is unacceptable under any circumstances, whereas another may\nhold that \u201cbeing in love\u201d makes it acceptable. Still another person may believe that\nsex is morally permissible without an emotional commitment. The ethical relativist\nHow do you make sexual decisions? What value system or systems do you employ?\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 66 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM Sexuality and Values 7\nbelieves that there is no objective way of justifying one set of moral values over\nanother. In this view, the essence of human morality is to derive one\u2019s own principles\nand apply them according to one\u2019s own conscience. Opponents of ethical relativism\nargue that allowing people free rein to determine what is right or wrong may bring\nabout social chaos and decay.\nOne form of ethical relativism is cultural relativism . From this perspective,\nwhat is right or wrong must be understood in terms of the cultural beliefs that\naffect sexual decision making. In some cultures, premarital sex is tolerated or even\nencouraged, whereas in others, it is considered immoral.\nHedonism T he hedonist is guided by the pursuit of pleasure, not by whether\na particular behavior is morally or situationally justified. \u201cIf it feels good, do it\u201d\nexpresses the hedonistic ethic. The hedonist believes that sexual desires, like hunger\nor thirst, do not invoke moral considerations.\nAsceticism Religious celibates, such as Roman Catholic priests and Buddhist\nmonks, choose a sceticism (self-denial of material and sexual desires) in order to\ndevote themselves to spiritual pursuits. Many ascetics in Eastern and Western reli-\ngions seek to transcend physical and worldly desires.\nUtilitarianism Ethical guidelines can be based on principles other than religious\nones. The English philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) proposed an ethical\nsystem based on u tilitarianism \u2014the view that moral conduct is based on that which\nwill bring about \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d (M ill, 1863) . The utili-\ntarian characterizes behavior as ethical when it does the greatest good and causes\nthe least harm. This is not the same thing as freedom of action. Utilitarians may\ncome down hard in opposition to premarital sex and bearing children out of wed-\nlock, for example, if they believe that these behavior patterns jeopardize a nation\u2019s\nhealth and social fabric. Mill\u2019s ethics require that we treat one another justly and\nhonestly, because it serves the greater good for people to be true to their word and\njust in their dealings with others.\nRationalism R ationalism is the use of reason to determine a course of action.\nThe rationalist believes that decisions should be based on intellect and reason rather\nthan emotions or faith. The rationalist assesses the facts in a sexual situation and\nthen weighs the consequences of various courses of action to make a decision. The\nrationalist shares with the utilitarian the belief that reasoning can lead to ethical\nReal Students, Real Questions\nQ Is a person who takes a vow of chastity, such as a nun,\nno longer considered a sexual being?\nA A person who takes a vow of chastity only promises\nnot to be a sexually active being. The reason usually\ninvolves dedication to values in which self-denial of\nsexual desires plays a key role, as in a religious t radition.\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that the person is no longer\na sexual being. The person remains female or male,\nand continues to be subject to the sexual drives, sexual\nhealth issues, and cultural expectations that affect\nfemales and males.\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 77 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM 8 CHAPTER 1 What Is Human Sexuality?\nT Taabbllee 11..11\nV VVaalluuee SSyysstteemmss ffoorr MMaakkiinngg SSeexxuuaall DDeecciissiioonnss\nSSyysstteemm C C oorree BBeelliieeff EE xxaammppllee\nLLeeggaalliissmm E Etthhiiccaall bbeehhaavviioorr iiss ddeerriivveedd ffrroomm aann eexxtteerrnnaall ssoouurrccee,, TThhee OOlldd TTeessttaammeenntt ccoonnttaaiinnss pprroohhiibbiittiioonnss aaggaaiinnsstt\nssuucchh aass aa rreelliiggiioonn.. aadduulltteerryy,, iinncceesstt,, sseexxuuaall aaccttiivviittyy wwiitthh ppeeooppllee ooff oonnee\u2019\u2019ss\noowwnn ggeennddeerr,, aanndd bbeessttiiaalliittyy..\nSSiittuuaattiioonnaall EEtthhiiccss E Etthhiiccaall ddeecciissiioonn mmaakkiinngg sshhoouulldd bbee gguuiiddeedd bbyy tthhee AA wwoommaann wwhhoo hhaass bbeeeenn ttaauugghhtt tthhaatt aabboorrttiioonn iiss tthhee\nssiittuuaattiioonn aanndd bbyy ggeennuuiinnee lloovvee ffoorr ootthheerrss.. ttaakkiinngg ooff aa hhuummaann lliiffee mmaayy ffiinndd hheerrsseellff wwiitthh lliimmiitteedd\nrreessoouurrcceess aanndd ddeecciiddee iinn ffaavvoorr ooff aann aabboorrttiioonn..\nRReellaattiivviissmm T Thheerree iiss nnoo oobbjjeeccttiivvee wwaayy ooff jjuussttiiffyyiinngg oonnee sseett ooff CCoohhaabbiittaattiioonn iiss ttoolleerraatteedd iinn ssoommee ccuullttuurreess bbuutt\nmmoorraall vvaalluueess oovveerr aannootthheerr.. ccoonnssiiddeerreedd iimmmmoorraall iinn ootthheerrss..\nHHeeddoonniissmm P Puurrssuuiitt ooff pplleeaassuurree iiss tthhee gguuiiddee..

The utilitarian may decide, for example,\nto prolong an unhappy marriage because of the belief that the greater good of the\nfamily and the community is better served by maintaining an unhappy marriage\nthan by dissolving it. The rationalist might decide that the personal consequences\nof continuing an unhappy marriage outweigh the consequences to the family or the\ncommunity at large.\nThese ethical systems represent general frameworks of moral reasoning or\npathways for judging the moral acceptability of sexual and nonsexual behavior.\nWhereas some of us may adopt one or another of these systems in their purest\nforms, others adopt a system of moral reasoning that involves some combination\nor variation of these ethical systems. Table 1.1 summarizes some of the value sys-\ntems in use.\nMany students will think critically about which values to apply to a given\nsituation. They may also apply critical thinking to the claims and arguments about\nhuman sexuality they come across from authority figures, colleagues, friends, and\nadvertisements. In the following section, we explore the nature of critical thinking.\nThinking Critically about\nHuman Sexuality\nWe are flooded with so much information about sex that it is difficult to separate\ntruth from fiction. Newspapers, TV shows, popular books and magazines, and the\nInternet contain one feature after another about sex.

But when two doctors disagree on the need for breast\nsurgery, or two officials disagree as to whether condoms should be distributed in\npublic schools, how can both be correct?

Be skeptical. Politicians, religious leaders, and other authority figures attempt\nto convince you of their points of view. Even researchers and authors may hold\ncertain biases. Accept no opinion as fact until you have personally weighed the\nevidence.\n2. Examine definitions of terms. Some statements are true when a term is defined\nin one way but not in another. Consider the maxim, \u201cLove is blind.\u201d If love is\ndefined as head-over-heels infatuation, there may be substance to the statement.\nInfatuated people tend to idealize loved ones. But if love is defined as deep\ncaring and commitment based on a more realistic (if still somewhat slanted)\nappraisal of the loved one, then love is not blind\u2014just a bit nearsighted.\n3. Examine the assumptions or premises of arguments. Consider the statement,\n\u201cAbortion is murder.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary defines murder as \u201cthe\nunlawful and malicious or premeditated killing of one human being by another.\u201d\nThe statement is true, according to this dictionary, only if (a) the victim is a\nhuman being and (b) the act is unlawful and malicious or premeditated. Many\npro-life advocates argue that embryos and fetuses are human beings from the\nmoment of conception. Many pro-choice advocates argue that embryos and\nfetuses do not become human beings until various stages of development. Thus,\nthe judgment that abortion is murder will rest in part on one\u2019s beliefs as to\nwhether\u2014and when\u2014an embryo or fetus is a human being.\n4. B e cautious in drawing conclusions from evidence. Research finds that teenagers\nwho listen to rap, hip-hop, pop, and rock music with sexually explicit lyrics\u2014or\nwith lyrics that refer to women as sex objects\u2014are more likely to initiate sexual\nactivity at early ages (M artino et al., 2006) . The popular media seem obsessed\nwith the idea that \u201cdirty\u201d songs instigate sex, and lots of it. However, teens\nwho choose to listen to these songs may differ from those who do not in their\nvalues, so that they not only spend hours with their iPods blasting sexual lyr-\nics into their ears but also choose to have sex at early ages. The evidence of an\nassociation between listening to this music and having sex is open to various\ninterpretations\u2014which brings us to our next principle of critical thinking.\n5. Consider alternative interpretations of research evidence. For example, teens\nwho dwell on sexual song lyrics may also be more open to sexual activity\nbecause they are generally less traditional than teens who (literally) turn these\nsongs off. Correlations or associations between events do not necessarily reveal\ncause and effect.\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 99 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM 10 CHAPTER 1 What Is Human Sexuality?\nA Closer Look\nThe National Survey of Sexual Health and B ehavior:\nWho Does What with Whom?\nYou see surveys on sex all the reasonably accurate picture of what people \u25a0 Many older people continue to have\ntime.

Consider the kinds of evidence on which conclusions are based. Some conclu-\nsions, even seemingly \u201cscientific\u201d conclusions, are based on anecdotes and per-\nsonal endorsements. They are not founded on sound research.\n7. Do not oversimplify. Consider the statement, \u201cHomosexuality is inborn.\u201d\nThere is some evidence that sexual orientation may involve inborn predispo-\nsitions, such as genetic influences. However, biology is not destiny in human\nsexuality. Gay male, lesbian, and heterosexual sexual orientations appear to\ndevelop as the result of a complex interaction of biological and environmental\nfactors.\n8. Do not overgeneralize. Consider the belief that gay males are effeminate and\nlesbians are masculine. Yes, some gay males and lesbians fit these stereotypes.\nHowever, many do not. Overgeneralizing makes us vulnerable to accepting\nstereotypes.\nPerspectives on Human Sexuality\nHuman sexuality is a complex topic. No single theory or perspective can capture\nall its nuances. In this book we explore human sexuality from many perspectives.\nIn this section we introduce a number of them\u2014historical, biological, evolution-\nThe \u201cVenus of Willendorf.\u201d\nary, cross-species, cross-cultural, psychological, and sociocultural. W e draw on these\nThis ancient figurine is\nperspectives in subsequent chapters. believed to be a fertility\nsymbol.\nTHE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\nHistory places sexual attitudes and behavior in context. It informs us as to whether\nsexual behavior reflects trends that have been with us through the millennia or the\ncustoms of a particular culture and era. History shows little evidence of universal\nsexual trends. Attitudes and behaviors vary extensively from one time and place\nto another. Contemporary American society may be permissive when compared\nto the Victorian and post\u2013World War II eras. Yet it looks staid when compared\nto the sexual excesses of some ancient societies, such as the ruling class of\nancient Rome. History also shows how religion has been a major influ-\nence on sexual values and behavior. Let us trace some historical changes\nin attitudes toward sexuality. We begin by turning the clock back 20,000\nto 30,000 years, to the days before written records were kept\u2014that is, to\nprehistory.\nPrehistoric Sexuality: From Female Idols to Phallic\nWorship I nformation about life among our Stone Age ancestors is\ndrawn largely from cave drawings, stone artifacts, and the customs of\nmodern-day preliterate peoples whose existence has changed little over\nthe millennia. From such sources, historians and anthropologists infer\na prehistoric division of labor. By and large, men hunted for game, and\nwomen tended to remain close to home. Women nurtured children and\ngathered edible plants and nuts, crabs, and other marine life that wandered\nalong the shore or swam in shallow waters.\nArt produced in the Stone Age suggests the worship of women\u2019s ability\nto bear children and perpetuate the species ( Fichner-Rathus, 2013) . Primitive\nstatues and cave drawings portray women with large, pendulous breasts, rounded\nhips, and prominent sex organs. Most theorists regard the figurines as fertility\nsymbols. Stone Age people may have been unaware of the male\u2019s contribution to\nreproduction.\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 1111 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM 12 CHAPTER 1 What Is Human Sexuality?\nAs the glacial sheets of the last Ice Age retreated (about 11,000 BCE) and the\nclimate warmed, human societies turned agrarian. Hunters and gatherers became\nfarmers and herders. Villages sprang up around fields. Men tended livestock. Women\nfarmed. As people grew aware of the male role in reproduction, p hallic worship\n(worship of the penis) sprang into being. Knowledge of paternity is believed to have\ndeveloped around 9000 BCE, resulting from observation of livestock. When people\nbegan to observe animals throughout the years, they also began to understand that\na predictable period of time elapsed between copulation and the birth of offspring.\nThe penis became glorified in art as a plough, ax, or sword. Phallic symbols\nplayed roles in religious ceremonies in ancient Egypt. The ancient Greeks sometimes\nrendered phalluses as rings, sometimes as necklaces. In ancient Rome, a large phal-\nlus was carried like a float in a parade honoring Venus, the goddess of love.\nThe incest taboo may have been the first human taboo. All human societies\napparently have some form of incest taboo, but societies have varied in terms of its\nstrictness. Brother\u2013sister marriages were permitted among the presumably divine\nrulers of ancient Egypt and among the royal families of the Incas and of Hawaii,\neven though they were generally prohibited among commoners. Father\u2013daughter\nmarriages were permitted among the aristocracy and royalty of ancient Egypt.\nIncestuous relationships in these royal blood lines may have kept wealth and power,\nas well as \u201cdivinity,\u201d in the family.\nThe Ancient Hebrews The ancient Hebrews viewed sex, at least in marriage,\nas a satisfying experience intended to fulfill the divine command to \u201cbe fruitful and\nmultiply.\u201d The emphasis on the procreative function of sex led to some interest-\ning social customs. For example, childlessness and the development of a repulsive\nabnormality, such as a boil, were grounds for divorce. Male\u2013male and female\u2013female\nsexual behavior were strongly condemned, as they threatened the perpetuation of\nthe family.\nThe ancient Hebrews believed that sex helped strengthen marital bonds and\nsolidify the family. But it would be inaccurate to ignore the fact that according to\nthe Hebrew Bible, the prophet Abraham had several wives and concubines, and\nKing Solomon had several hundred. In any event, Jewish law legislated the mini-\nmum frequency of marital relations, which varied according to the man\u2019s profession\nand the amount of time spent at home:\nEvery day for those who have no occupation, twice a week for laborers, once\na week for ass-drivers; once every thirty days for camel drivers; and once every\nsix months for sailors.\n\u2014Mishnah Ketubot 5:6; Ketubot 62b\u201362b\nAccording to the Book of Proverbs, a good wife rises before dawn to tend to\nher family\u2019s needs, brings home food, instructs the servants, tends the vineyards,\nmakes the clothes, keeps the ledger, helps the needy, and works well into the night.\nEven so, a wife was considered the property of her husband and could be divorced\non a whim.

The woman had been\nironing at the time. She explained the scars on Obert\u2019s face and head: \u201cI clobbered\nhim on the head with the iron.\u201d Because Obert was the woman\u2019s supervisor, the\njudge also convicted him of sexual harassment.\nThe Ancient Greeks T he classical or golden age of Greece lasted from about\n500 to 300 BCE. Within this relatively short span lived the philosophers Socrates,\nPlato, and Aristotle; the playwrights Aristophanes, Aeschylus, and Sophocles; the natu-\nral scientist Archimedes; and the lawgiver Solon. Like the Hebrews, the Greeks valued\nfamily life, but Greek men also admired the well-developed male body and enjoyed\nnude wrestling in the arena. Erotic encounters and off-color jokes characterized the\nplays of Aristophanes and other playwrights. The Greeks held that the healthy mind\nmust dwell in a healthy body. They cultivated muscle and movement along with mind.\nThe Greeks viewed their gods\u2014Zeus, god of gods; Apollo, who inspired art and\nmusic; Aphrodite, the goddess of carnal love whose name is the basis of the word\naphrodisiac; and others\u2014as voracious seekers of sexual variety. Not only were they\nbelieved to have sexual adventures among themselves but they were also thought to\nhave seduced mortals.\nThree aspects of Greek sexuality are of particular interest to our study of\nsexual practices in the ancient world: male\u2013male sexual behavior, pederasty, and\nMany Ancient Greek\nCeramics Depict Male\u2013Male\nSexual Activity.

The Greeks viewed people as b isexual . Male\u2013male sex was deemed\nnormal and tolerated so long as it did not threaten the institution of the family.\nPederasty means love of boys. Sex between men and prepubescent boys was illegal,\nbut families were generally pleased if their adolescent sons attracted socially prominent\n2 T mentors. TRUTH OR FICTION REVISITED: Men in ancient Greece might take on an\nF\nadolescent male as a lover and pupil. Pederasty did not impede the boy\u2019s future male\u2013\nfemale functioning, because the pederast himself was usually married, and Greeks\nbelieved people to be equally capable of male\u2013female and male\u2013male sexual activity.\nProstitution flourished at every level of society. Prostitutes ranged from refined\ncourtesans to c oncubines , who were usually slaves. Courtesans could play musical\ninstruments, dance, engage in witty repartee, and discuss politics. They were also\nskilled in the arts of love. No social stigma was attached to visiting a courtesan. At\nthe lower rungs of society were streetwalkers and brothel prostitutes. The latter\nwere not hard to find: A wooden or painted penis invariably stood by the door.\nThe women of Athens had no more rights than slaves. They were subject to\nthe authority of their male next-of-kin before marriage and to their husbands after-\nwards. They received no formal education and were consigned mostly to women\u2019s\nquarters in their homes. They were chaperoned when they ventured out of doors.\nA husband could divorce his wife without cause and was obligated to do so if she\n3 T committed adultery.

Masturbation,\nmale\u2013male sexual behavior, female\u2013female sexual behavior, oral\u2013genital contact,\nanal intercourse\u2014all were viewed as abominations in the eyes of God, as in Leviticus.\nSaint Augustine (353\u2013430 CE) associated sexual lust with the original sin of Adam\nand Eve in the Garden of Eden. Lust and shame were passed down through the genera-\ntions. Lust made any sexual expression, even in marriage, inherently evil. Only through\ncelibacy, according to Augustine, could men and women attain a state of grace.\nIslam\nThe Seraglio of the sultan of the Ottoman Empire housed about 1,600 vir-\ngins, each hoping to be chosen for one night of honor. The sultan makes [the\nMormon] Brigham Young, who had only a few dozen wives, look like a piker.\n( Bentley, 2009 )\nIslam, the dominant religion in the Middle East, across North Africa and into\nparts of Southern Asia, was founded by the Prophet Muhammad. Muhammad was\nborn in what is now Saudi Arabia, in about 570 CE. The Islamic\ntradition treasures marriage and sexual fulfillment in marriage.\nPremarital sex and adultery invite shame and social condemna-\ntion\u2014and, in some fundamentalist Islamic states, the death penalty,\nby stoning.\nMuhammad decreed that marriage represents the road to vir-\ntue. Islamic tradition permits a sexual double standard, however.\nMen under most circumstances may take up to four wives (we saw\nthat the sultan of the Ottoman Empire had a few more), but women\nare permitted only one husband. Public social interactions between\nmen and women are severely restricted in more conservative Islamic\nsocieties. Women are expected to keep their heads and faces veiled in\npublic and to avoid all contact with men other than their husbands.\nIndia P erhaps no culture has cultivated sexual pleasure as a spiri-\ntual ideal to the extent of the ancient Hindus of India. From the\nfifth century CE onward, temples show sculptures of gods, nymphs,\nand ordinary people in erotic poses. Hindu sexual practices were\ncodified in a sex manual, the K ama Sutra, which illustrates sexual\npositions, some of which would challenge a contortionist. It also\nholds recipes for alleged aphrodisiacs. This manual is believed to\nhave been written by the Hindu sage Vatsyayana sometime between\nthe third and fifth centuries CE, at about the time that Christianity\nwas ascending in the West.\nIn its graphic representations of sexual positions and practices,\nthe Kama Sutra reflected the Hindu belief that sex was a religious\nduty, not a source of shame or guilt.

To the Taoist\nmasters of China, who influenced Chinese culture for millennia, sex was a sacred\nduty\u2014a form of worship that led toward harmony with nature and immortality.\n4 T TRUTH OR FICTION REVISITED: It is not true that the production of sex manuals\nF\noriginated in modern times. The Chinese culture was the first to produce a detailed\nsex manual, which came into use about 200 years before the birth of Jesus. The man\nwas expected to extend intercourse as long as possible to absorb more of his wife\u2019s\nnatural essence, or yin. Yin would enhance his own masculine essence, or yang.\nMoreover, he was to help bring his partner to orgasm so as to increase the flow of\nenergy that he might absorb.\nTaoists believed that it was wasteful for a man to \u201cspill his seed.\u201d Masturbation,\nacceptable for women, was ruled out for men. Sexual practices such as anal intercourse\nand oral\u2013genital contact (fellatio and cunnilingus) were permissible, so long as the man\ndid not squander yang through wasteful ejaculation. Same-sex activity was not pro-\nhibited by Taoist holy writings, but some Taoists frowned on exclusive homosexuality.\nA parallel to Western cultures was the role accorded women in traditional Chinese\nsociety. The \u201cgood wife,\u201d like her Western counterparts, was limited to domestic roles.\nChristianity in the Middle Ages T he Middle Ages span the millennium of\nWestern history from about 476 to 1450 CE. The attitudes of the Roman Catholic\nChurch toward sexuality, largely unchanged since the time of Augustine, dominated\nmedieval thought (C rawford et al., 2011) . Yet some currents of change crept across\nmedieval Europe in the social standing of women. The Church had long regarded all\nwomen as being tainted by the sin of Eve. But in the Eastern Empire of Byzantium,\nbased in Constantinople, the cult of the Virgin Mary flourished. The ideal of wom-\nanhood was in the image of Mary: good, gracious, loving, and saintly. Imported by\nthe Crusaders and others who returned from the East, the cult of the Virgin Mary\nswept European Christendom and helped elevate the status of women.\nThere were two conflicting concepts of woman: One was the woman as Eve,\nthe temptress; the other was the woman as Mary, virtuous and pure. Contemporary\nWestern images of women still show the schism between the good girl and the bad\ngirl\u2014the Madonna and the whore.\nThe Protestant Reformation D uring the Reformation, Martin Luther (1483\u2013\n1546) and other Christian reformers such as John Calvin (1509\u20131564) split off from\nthe Roman Catholic Church and formed their own sects, which led to the devel-\nopment of the modern Protestant denominations. Luther disputed many Roman\nCatholic doctrines on sexuality. He believed that priests should be allowed to marry\nand rear children. To Luther, marriage was as much a part of human nature as eating\nor drinking. Calvin rejected the Roman church\u2019s position that sex in marriage was\npermissible only for procreation. He believed that sexual expression in marriage also\nstrengthened the marriage bond and helped relieve the stresses of everyday life.\nComing to America E arly settlers brought to North America the religious\nteachings that had dominated Western thought and culture for centuries. Whatever\ntheir differences, each religion stressed the ideal of family life and viewed sex outside\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 1166 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM Perspectives on Human Sexuality 17\nof marriage as immoral or sinful. A woman\u2019s place, by and large, was\nin the home and in the fields. Not until 1833, when Oberlin College\nopened its doors to women, were women permitted to attend college in\nthe United States. (Not until 1920 did women gain the right to vote.)\nThe Victorian Period T he middle and later parts of the nineteenth\ncentury are generally called the Victorian period, after Queen Victoria\nof England. Victoria assumed the throne in 1837 and ruled until her\ndeath in 1901. Her name has become virtually synonymous with sex-\nual repression. Victorian society in Europe and the United States, on\nthe surface at least, was prim and proper. Sex was not discussed in\npolite society. Even the legs of pianos were draped with cloth for the\nsake of modesty. Many women viewed sex as a marital duty to be per-\nformed for procreation or to satisfy their husbands\u2019 cravings. Consider\nthe following quotation:\nI am happy now that Charles calls on my bed chamber less frequently\nthan of old. As it is, I now endure but two calls a week and when I hear\nhis steps outside my door I lie down on my bed, close my eyes, open\nmy legs and think of England.\n\u2014Attributed to Alice, Lady Hillingdon\nWomen were assumed not to experience sexual desires or p leasures.\n\u201cI would say,\u201d observed William Acton (1814\u20131875), an influential\nQueen Victoria of England.

Physicians thus\nrecommended that intercourse be practiced infrequently. The Reverend Sylvester\nGraham (1794\u20131851) preached that ejaculation depleted men of \u201cvital fluids\u201d they\nneeded to maintain health and vitality. Graham preached against \u201cwasting the seed\u201d\nby masturbation or frequent marital intercourse (H aynes, 2012 ). (How frequent\nwas \u201cfrequent\u201d? In Graham\u2019s view, intercourse more than once a month could\ndangerously sap vital energies.) T RUTH OR FICTION REVISITED: Graham recom- 5\nmended that young men control their sexual appetites by a diet of simple foods\nbased on whole-grain flours, and invented what we now call the Graham cracker\nto serve this purpose.\nBut the behavior of Victorians was not as repressed as advertised. Despite\nActon\u2019s beliefs, Victorian women did experience sexual pleasure and orgasm.\nConsider some findings from an early sex survey conducted in 1892 by a female\nphysician, Clelia Duel Mosher. Although her sample was small and nonrandom, 35\nof the 44 women who responded admitted to desiring sexual intercourse. And 34\nof them reported experiencing orgasm. Women\u2019s diaries of the time also contained\naccounts of passionate love affairs.\nProstitution flourished during the Victorian era. Men apparently thought that\nthey were doing their wives a favor by looking elsewhere. Accurate statistics are\nhard to come by, but there may have been as many as 1 prostitute for every 12 men\nin London during the nineteenth century; in Vienna, perhaps 1 for every 7 men.\nSame-sex sexual behavior was considered indecent in Victorian society. The\ncelebrated, gay Anglo-Irish novelist and playwright Oscar Wilde\u2014author of T he\nPicture of Dorian Gray, An Ideal Husband, and T he Importance of Being Earnest \u2014\nwas imprisoned after being convicted of \u201cgross indecency.\u201d\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 1177 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM 18 CHAPTER 1 What Is Human Sexuality?\nFoundations of the Scientific Study of Sexuality A gainst this backdrop\nof repression, scientists and scholars began to approach sexuality as an area of\nlegitimate scientific study. The English physician Havelock Ellis (1859\u20131939) pub-\nlished a veritable encyclopedia of sexuality between 1897 and 1910, S tudies in the\nPsychology of Sex. Ellis drew information from case histories, anthropological find-\nings, and medical knowledge. He argued that sexual desires in women were natural\nand healthy. He wrote that many sexual problems had psychological rather than\nphysical causes. Gay male or lesbian sexual orientation was a natural variation, Ellis\nargued, and not an aberration. He treated gay male and lesbian sexual orientations\nas inborn dispositions, not as vices or character flaws.\nThe influential German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840\u20131902)\ndescribed case histories of people with sexual deviations in his book, Psychopathia\nSexualis (1886). Cases included sadomasochism (sexual gratification through\ninflicting or receiving pain), bestiality, and necrophilia (intercourse with dead peo-\nple). Krafft-Ebing viewed deviations as mental diseases that could be studied and\nperhaps treated by medical science.\nAt about the same time, a Viennese physician, Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939), was\ndeveloping a theory of personality that has had an enormous influence on modern cul-\nture and science. Freud believed that the sex drive was our principal motivating force.\nAlfred Kinsey (1894\u20131956), an Indiana University zoologist, conducted the first\nlarge-scale studies of sexual behavior in the 1930s and 1940s. Kinsey conducted\ndetailed interviews with nearly 12,000 people across the United States. The results\nof his surveys were published in two volumes, S exual Behavior in the Human Male\n(Kinsey et al., 1948) and S exual Behavior in the Human Female (Kinsey et al., 1953).\nThese books represent the first scientific attempts to provide a comprehensive picture\nof sexual behavior in the United States.\nThe books made for dry reading. They were filled with statistical tables rather\nthan racy pictures or vignettes. Nevertheless, they became best-sellers, exploding on\na public that had not yet learned to discuss sex openly. Their publication unleashed\nthe dogs of criticism. Kinsey\u2019s work had some methodological flaws\u2014especially\nin its selection of participants\u2014but much of the criticism branded it immoral and\nobscene. Many newspapers refused to report the results of his survey on female sex-\nuality. A congressional committee in the 1950s claimed that Kinsey\u2019s work under-\nmined the moral fiber of the nation, rendering it more vulnerable to a Communist\ntakeover. Despite all the brouhaha, Kinsey and his colleagues made sex research a\nscientifically respectable field of study and helped lay the groundwork for discuss-\ning sexual behavior openly.\nThe Sexual Revolution T he period of the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s is often\nreferred to as the s exual revolution. Dramatic changes occurred in American sexual\nattitudes and practices during the \u201cSwinging Sixties.\u201d Our society was on the thresh-\nold of major social upheaval, not only in sexual behavior but also in science, politics,\nfashion, music, art, and cinema. The so-called Woodstock generation, disheartened\nby commercialism and the Vietnam War, tuned in (to rock music on the radio), turned\non (to drugs), and dropped out (of mainstream society). The heat was on between the\nhippies and the hardhats. Long hair became the mane of men. Bell-bottomed jeans\nflared out. Films became sexually explicit as censorship crumbled. Critics seriously\ncontemplated whether the pornography \u201cclassic\u201d D eep Throat had deep social impli-\ncations. Hard rock music bellowed the message of rebellion and revolution.\nThe sexual revolution gained momentum from a timely interplay of scientific,\nsocial, political, and economic forces. The war (in Vietnam), the bomb (fear of the\nnuclear bomb), the pill (the introduction of the birth control pill), and the mass\n0099446699__0011__cchh11__ppxxxxvvii--002299..iinndddd 1188 1122//1199//1122 1100::4400 AAMM Perspectives on Human Sexuality 19\nmedia (especially television) were four such forces. The pill lessened the risk of\nunwanted pregnancy, permitting young people to engage in recreational or casual\nsex. Pop psychology movements, such as the Human Potential Movement of the\n1960s and 1970s (the \u201cMe Decade\u201d), spread the message that people should get\nin touch with and express their genuine feelings, including their sexual feelings.\n\u201cDoing your own thing\u201d became one catchphrase. \u201cIf it feels right, go with it\u201d\nbecame another. The lamp was rubbed. Out popped the sexual genie.\nThe sexual revolution was tied to social permissiveness and political liberalism.\nThe media dealt openly with sex. Popular books encouraged people to explore their\nsexuality. Film scenes of lovemaking became so commonplace that the movie rating\nsystem was introduced to alert parents.\nGay Activism S ome say gay activism began in 1969, with the gay \u201crebellion\u201d\nagainst police discrimination at the gay bar, the Stonewall Inn, in Manhattan. Gay\nactivism mushroomed during the sexual revolution. Not only did gays become more\nvoluble in demanding equal rights, but they also began gay parades in major cities,\nsuch as the annual parades in San Francisco and New York\u2019s Greenwich Village. In\nthe early 1980s, gay people also built social institutions to tackle the problem of\nHIV/AIDS, which afflicted gay males disproportionately. Today gay activism is cen-\ntered around the issue of gay marriage, which we will discuss further in C hapter 1 0 .\nSex Research During the sexual revolution, sexually explicit questionnaires pro- CRITICAL THINKING\nliferated in popular magazines, interviewers posed sexually explicit questions by What, then, does history\ntelephone and in person, and some pioneers, including William H.

In addition to\npremarital sex, two other features of the sexual revolution have become permanent\nparts of our social fabric: the liberation of female sexuality and a greater willingness\nto discuss sex openly. Countless pornography websites populate the Internet and can\nbe accessed by children. As late as the early 1960s, men\u2019s magazines might reveal\nmodels\u2019 breasts, and nudist magazines might show some more. Today, however,\nwith multiple websites offering the opportunity to download videos of celebrities\nsuch as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian engaging in sexual activity, pornography\nhas nearly reached the status of wallpaper.\nIn sum, all societies have some form of an incest taboo. Most societies place a\nvalue on procreative sex within the context of an enduring relationship, usually in the\nform of marriage. Marriage provides security for children, maintains or increases the\npopulation, and institutionalizes the orderly transfer of property from generation to\ngeneration. Other sexual practices\u2014masturbation, promiscuous sex, male\u2013male sex-\nual behavior, female\u2013female sexual behavior, prostitution, polygamy, and so on\u2014have\nbeen condemned in some societies, tolerated by others, and encouraged by still others.\nTHE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE\nThe biological perspective focuses on the roles of genes, hormones, the nervous\nsystem, and other biological factors in human sexuality. Sex, after all, serves the\nbiological function of reproduction. We are biologically endowed with structures\nthat make sexual behavior possible\u2014and, for most people, pleasurable.\nStudy of the biology of sex informs us about the mechanisms of reproduction\nas well as of the mechanisms of sexual arousal and response. We learn that orgasm\nis a spinal reflex as well as a psychological event.\nBiological researchers have made major strides in assisting infertile couples\nto conceive, for example, through laboratory-based methods of fertilization.\nKnowledge of biology has furthered our ability to overcome sexual problems.\nTHE EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE\nSpecies vary not only in their physical characteristics but also in their social behavior,\nEvolution The development\nincluding their mating behavior.

Although mutations occur randomly, they are subject to\nnatural selection. Adaptive mutations enhance reproductive success. As more mem-\nbers of the species come to possess these traits, the species changes.\nTraits are transmitted by units of heredity called g enes . Traits are determined\nby single genes or combinations of genes that offspring inherit from their parents.\nGenes are segments of c hromosomes , which are composed of d eoxyribonucleic acid\n(DNA) . Each human cell normally contains a complement of 46 chromosomes,\nwhich are arranged in 23 pairs. Each pair of chromosomes consists of 1,000 or so\ngenes. A child normally inherits one member of each pair from each parent. Each\nchild inherits half of his or her genes from each parent. The particular combinations\nof genes that one inherits account for whether one has blue eyes or brown eyes, light\nor dark hair, and arms or wings.\nSome scientists suggest that there is also a genetic basis to social behavior,\nincluding sexual behavior, among humans and other animals (B uss & Schmitt,\n2011 ). If so, we may carry traits that helped our prehistoric ancestors survive and\nreproduce successfully.\nDoes biology govern sexual behavior? Although the sexuality of other species is\nlargely governed by biological processes, culture and experience also play vital roles\nin human sexuality (P etersen & Hyde, 2010) .

There are animal\non MyDevelopmentLab\nexamples, or analogues, of human male\u2013male sexual behavior, female\u2013female sexual\nbehavior, oral\u2013genital contact, and oral\u2013oral behavior (i.e., kissing). Foreplay is also\nwell known in the animal world. Turtles massage their mates\u2019 heads with their claws.\nMale mice nibble at their partner\u2019s necks. Most mammals use only a rear-entry posi-\ntion for copulation, but some animals, such as apes, use a variety of coital positions.\nCross-species research reveals an interesting pattern. Sexual behavior among\n\u201chigher\u201d mammals, such as primates, is less directly controlled by instinct than it is\namong the \u201clower\u201d species, such as birds, fish, or lower mammals. Experience and\nlearning play more important roles in sexuality as we travel up the evolutionary ladder.\nSOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES\nSociological perspectives, like the historical perspective, provide insight into the\nways in which cultural institutions and beliefs affect sexual behavior and people\u2019s\nsense of morality. Interest in the effects of culture on sexuality was spurred by\nthe early-twentieth-century work of Margaret Mead (1901\u20131978) and Bronislaw\nMalinowski (1884\u20131942).\nIn Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies (1935), Mead laid the\ngroundwork for recent psychological and sociological research challenging gender-\nrole stereotypes. In most cultures characterized by a gender division of labor, men\ntypically go to business or to the hunt, and\u2014when necessary\u2014to war. In such cul-\ntures, men are perceived as strong, active, independent, and logical. Women are\nviewed as passive, dependent, nurturing, and emotional. Mead concluded that\nthese stereotypes are not inherent in our genetic heritage. Rather, they are acquired\nthrough cultural expectations and socialization. That is, men and women learn to\nbehave in ways that are expected of them in their particular culture.\nIn 1951, Clellan Ford, an anthropologist, and Frank Beach, a psychologist,\nreviewed sexual behavior in almost 200 preliterate societies around the world. They\nfound great variety in sexual customs and beliefs. They also found some fairly common\nthreads. Kissing was quite common although not universal. The Thonga of Africa did\nnot practice kissing. When witnessing European visitors kissing each other, members\nof the tribe commented that they could not understand why Europeans \u201cate\u201d each\nother\u2019s saliva and dirt. The frequency of sexual intercourse also varies from culture to\nculture, but intercourse is relatively more frequent among young people everywhere.\nSocieties differ in their attitudes toward childhood masturbation.

If human\nsexuality were determined exclusively by biology, we might not find such diversity.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES\nPsychological perspectives focus on the many psychological influences\u2014perception,\nlearning, motivation, emotion, personality, and so on\u2014that affect our sexual behav-\nior and our experience of ourselves as female or male. Some psychological theorists,\nsuch as Sigmund Freud, focus on the motivational role of sex in human personality.\nOthers focus on how our experiences and mental representations of the world affect\nour sexual behavior.\nSigmund Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory S igmund Freud, a Viennese\nphysician, formulated a grand theory of personality termed p sychoanalysis .

We can only guess at the number of objectionable beliefs expressed in this\ndescription, such as seeing the male as the ideal, focusing on the differences rather\nthan the similarities between men and women, and the implicit right of men to hold\npower over women.\nFeminism and f eminist theory are born of protest against ideas such as those of\nAristotle\u2019s\u2014ideas that remain with us today in many if not most parts of the world\n( Petersen & Hyde, 2010) . Definitions of feminism and of feminist theory are con-\ntroversial, but it is clear enough that feminist theory focuses on the subordination of\nwomen to men; analyzing the relationships between sexism, heterosexism (prejudice\nor discrimination against homosexuals by heterosexuals), racism, and class oppres-\nsion; and exploring means of resistance\u2014on individual and societal levels (P etersen\n& Hyde, 2010 ).\nAmong other things, feminist theory challenges:\n\u2022 Traditional views of men as breadwinners and women as homemakers\n\u2022 Traditional views of men as political policymakers, especially since those policies\naffect women and children\n\u2022 Traditional views of men as sexual \u201caggressors\u201d and women as sexual\n\u201cgatekeepers\u201d\n\u2022 Traditional gender roles that view men as objective and rational, and women as\nemotional and irrational\nSome feminists challenge the very concepts of femininity and masculinity\nbecause their existence tends to suggest that there is some sort of biological or\n\u201cactual\u201d basis to the distinction (S hields & Dicicco, 2011) . They argue, instead, that\nfemininity and masculinity might be purely social constructions that have the effect\nof giving women second-class citizenship\u2014or, in many historic eras and parts of the\nworld, no citizenship whatsoever.\nIn terms of topics most relevant to this b ook , we will find feminists asserting\nthat men have no right to control women\u2019s bodies\u2014for example, that abortion is\nthe personal choice of a woman; that women have as much right as men to decide\nwhether or not to engage in sexual activity, and with whom; that there are few if\nany gender differences in mental abilities, such as those used in math and science;\nand that most medical research has been conducted by men for men, with men as\nsubjects.\nAlthough the extent and nature of gender differences remain controversial, we\ncan note that many traditions that subjugate women are falling by the wayside,\nat least in developed nations. Most Western women, for example, are now in the\nworkforce. As a result, many men now share in child rearing and housekeeping with\nfemale partners. In the United States, as many women as men are pursuing careers\nin traditionally male domains, such as business, law, and medicine ( Kimmel et al.,\n2012 ).

Queer theory also challenges the assumption that people\nare naturally divided into heterosexuals and homosexuals (D owning & Gillett, 2011) .\nAccording to queer theory, the concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality\nare social constructs that ignore commonly experienced mismatches among people\u2019s\nanatomic sex, society\u2019s gender roles, and individuals\u2019 sexual desires (D owning &\nGillett, 2011 ). Queer theory asserts that human sexuality has always been more\nvaried than those in power\u2014particularly male heterosexuals\u2014are willing to admit.\nThey point to historical examples such as ancient Greek bisexuality and to current\nhomophobia as evidence.
