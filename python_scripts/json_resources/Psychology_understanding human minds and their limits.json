Visual illusions demonstrate\nthat reality and human perception of reality are different things.\nFigure 2: Despite the vertical line appearing longer, the two lines are the\nsame length. This curiosity is common to most humans. This illusion happens\nin the real world, with a telephone pole or tree appearing taller when vertical\nthan when lying flat on the ground. There are societies where perpendicular\nlines are rare, such as desert people who live in rounded huts without\nperpendicularly angled tables and boxes and television sets. These people\nare less likely to be fooled by the above illusion. It is interesting that those\nexperienced with perpendicular lines are those who fall for this illusion. Most\nwould assume it would be the inexperienced who are more likely to be tricked.\nI remember when I was a kid and walked into the half open bathroom door in the middle\nof the night. In the dark I saw the moon through the window on the opposite side of the\nbathroom and assumed the door was wide open. If the door had been closed, hiding the\nmoon, I would have assumed the door was closed and felt for the door knob. This is a case\nwhere my assumption was half right: the door was half open. The problem being that the\nedge of a half opened door hurts your head more than the face of a closed door.\n9 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS About the Author\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nDavid Cycleback is Director of Center for Artifact Studies, and an internationally known\nscholar working in the areas of authenticity, cognitive science and philosophy.

It shows how physiology and psychology put\nlimits on humans\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the universe, their immediate environment\nand themselves. The cognitive methods that allow humans and other beings to make the\nspeedy decisions needed to function and survive inhibit and distort information and prevent\nobjective and even accurate judgment.\nMinds and the philosophy and psychology of knowledge and perception are vast, complex\nand continually studied subjects, with many unanswered and unanswerable questions. This\nbook offers a survey of key introductory concepts, theories, ideas, and examples, and serves\nas food for further thought and a springboard for further reading and discussion. Debates\nand counter theories to the points in this book are welcome and encouraged. Included\nthroughout the book are study questions to test your comprehension and to facilitate further\nthinking and discussion.\nWhile the book focuses on human minds, the end briefly looks at other minds, including\nnon-human animals, artificial intelligence and beyond.\nThis book is an updating and expansion of earlier works. Chapters and sections have been\nused and cited in courses, lectures and literature at various institutions, including Link\u00f6ping\nUniversity, Museum of Innovation and Science, Saylor Academy, Jewish Theological Seminary,\nUniversity of California Center for Learning in the Art and Sciences, Tufts University,\nUniversity of Arkansas and University of Portsmouth.\nI am thankful for the input and assistance form Alison Wald (University of Washington\nMedical School), Dr. Catarina Amorim (University of Oxford), Sandra C. Rudd and Professor\nDale F. Rudd (University of Wisconsin-Madison).\n11 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS A brIef overvIew of thIs book\nA BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS BOOK\nChapter 1 (Conceits) is a springboard for the entire book, and introduces various curious,\nirrational, arbitrary and often comical ways humans think and perceive. The idea is for readers\nto realize how irrational, biased filled and error prone is their standard way of thinking.\nChapters 2\u201312 introduce how the human mind works not unlike a computer, using internal\nautomatic cognitive methods to translate the limited sensory information into perceptions.\nPerceptions are the result of making guesses in the face of ambiguous information. The\nchapters demonstrate that there is a margin of error in these processes and perceptions,\nexemplified by optical illusions.\nChapters 13\u201314 show that the human brain has a limited capacity and must use attention\n(focusing on some things, ignoring others) to process information and function. It also\nshows how humans often create this attention by using arbitrary rules and self-deception.\nChapter 15 shows how our perceptions and judgments are subjective and unique to the\nindividual, formed by one\u2019s sensory abilities, education, culture, experiences, personal\n1122 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS A brIef overvIew of thIs book\npsychology and even aesthetic taste. This prevents humans from making objective judgments\nand having objective knowledge.\nChapter 16 shows how many of the internal methods of making decisions, and the resulting\nperceptions, are automatic and subconscious, working independent even of conscious knowledge.\nChapters 17\u201323 look at language. Language is useful for practical purposes, but is limited,\narbitrary and delusory in translating that which is often beyond language. Language has all\nthe biases, arbitrariness and illusions of all human thought and function.\nChapter 24 shows how much of our aesthetic and artistic reactions are based on automatic\nsubconscious reactions to basic sensory stimulus.\nChapters 25\u201327 look at the importance of learning, but also what we learn is often subjective,\nrelative and delusory.\nChapters 28\u201333 look at art, a complex and esoteric area that involves perception, language\nand communication. We mentally process art in much the same way we process reality.\nChapters 34\u201335 look at the reliability of the mind. The mind is designed to function, often\nat the expense of truth telling, and we cannot determine the reliability of our own minds.\nChapters 36\u201337 look at how being social animals and the need to function and survive\naffect our thinking.\nPart II is a quick look at other minds, including non-human animal, artificial intelligence\nand beyond.\n13 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\n1 CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY\nLOOK AT HOW HUMANS\nTHINK AND PERCEIVE\nAs a beginning for this book, this chapter shows curious, delusory, ironic and often comical ways\nhuman minds, including yours and mine, work.\nFor this chapter and book, a conceit is defined as a false, artificial, arbitrary, contrived and/\nor overly simplified rule or set of rules used to explain the way things are or the way they\nare supposed to be. A conceit is often made to give an answer where the real answer is\nunknown or to give a simple, convenient answer or address to a complex situation.\nA Victorian England book of etiquette stated that on a bookshelf a book by a male author\nshould never be placed next to a book by a female author. The exception was when the\nauthors were married to each other.\nA wealthy American businessman and amateur historian decided to build a duplicate of\nan Ancient Greek pillar on his ranch. His expressed intent was to make it as historically\naccurate as possible, down to the smallest known detail. Partway through the construction,\nscholars discovered that the Ancient Greeks had painted the original pillar a bright light\nblue. The businessman was taken aback at this finding. All the pillars he had seen in person\nand depicted in books were unpainted. Painting one of those beautiful stoic pillars a bright\ncolor bordered on the distasteful, like following a fine meal with lime jello and cool whip.\nThe businessman built the pillar exact in all known details except it was unpainted.\nThe human being lives in a universe that is mostly beyond its knowledge and comprehension.\nNone of us knows the volume of the universe, the complete inner workings of our own\nminds, what birds really think or what it is like to be in someone else\u2019s shoes. We can\nspeculate, we can conjecture, we can theorize, but we don\u2019t know for certain.\nIt is fair to assume Albert Einstein would have said there were many areas of science he\nknew little about. Just because you are a famous nuclear physicist on the cover of Time\nmagazine doesn\u2019t make you a wiz at biology, veterinary science or economics.\nWhile humans know little about the universe, they have an innate psychological need for\nanswers and order. Most of us want to know the meaning of the universe and what is our\npurpose on earth.\n14 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nIn an attempt to overcome their lack of knowledge and sate their desires for order, human\nbeings create pseudo answers and artificial order. This is most commonly done with conceits.\nThe following are examples of conceits:\n\u2022 The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening. (The sun does not rise\nand fall. This is a visual illusion caused by humans\u2019 position on the surface of a\nrotating earth.)\n\u2022 Baby boys should wear blue, baby girls should wear pink.\n\u2022 When men greet they must shake hands.\n\u2022 A painting should be framed and hung from the wall. You should not display it\non a tabletop or leaned against a wall.\n\u2022 It is uncouth to drink wine out of a coffee cup or beer stein. Wine must be drunk\nfrom a wine glass.\n\u2022 A properly set table must have, from left to right, fork on napkin, plate, knife,\nspoon and drinking glass. A table set another way is set incorrectly.\n\u2022 A cowboy movie has to take place in a dusty hot place like in Arizona or Texas. If\nit takes place in Maine, it\u2019s not a cowboy movie.\n\u2022 There is great significance in 10 year (decade) and 100 year (century) increments.\nNine, 11 or 98 year durations are of lesser importance.\n1155 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nConceits are used in all facets of our lives. From the fashion rules for the shoes we wear\nto how we describe the universe to our children. From the way a house is supposed to\nbe decorated to how music is supposed to sound. From the ways we conceptualize the\nunknown to the required color for artificial turf in a sports stadium. I hate to break it to\nyou sports fans, but there\u2019s no practical reason artificial turf can\u2019t be blue, purple, grey, red,\nblack or white.\nA conceit can be said and unsaid, conscious and nonconscious, innate and learned, known\nand unknown. In cases it is a set of rules posted on a sign. In other cases it is a gut reaction\n(\u2018That\u2019s just the way it\u2019s supposed to be\u2019).\nConceits can be trivial (\u2018pencils always go to the right of the pens on my desk\u2019) to large\n(religious, political or philosophical beliefs requiring a leap of faith).\nOne\u2019s conceits can be idiosyncratic or widely held (custom). Many of one\u2019s conceits change\nand develop with time and experiences.\nBugs are icky.\nFor a romantic evening, you need soft music and candlelight.\nYou must dress up to go to the opera.\nYour socks should match in color and pattern.\nThe human is wired to interpret its environment in the form of conceits. The human\u2019s\nenvironment is so complex, the human constantly bombarded with so much internal and\nexternal information, the human uses conceits to create an understandable translation.\nSomeone who claims to have no conceits has pointed out she has an additional one.\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t believe in the prevalence of conceits should go to a mall or busy\ndowntown street and observe the variety of fashions. And, perhaps more important, observe\nhow he or she reacts to the fashions (\u2018Damn hippie,\u2019 \u2018Must be a Republican,\u2019 \u2018Honey, hide\nyour purse.\u2019).\nFor just one day try to live without conceits. No prejudice, no preconceptions, no traditions,\nno fashion, no habits, no arbitrary choices, no simplified answers to complicated situations,\nno made up answer when the real answer is unknown, no doing something \u2018because that\u2019s\nthe way I always do it.\u2019\n16 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nRealize that exchanging one conceit for another is not ridding you of conceits.\nIf you can\u2019t live without conceits for a day, try it for a partial day, try it for an hour, try it\nfor five minutes. Time yourself with your stopwatch.\nWhy is pink so associated with girls and sissies? Is there something inherent about the color,\nsimilar to the biological attraction of hummingbirds to brightly colored flowers? Or is it\nmostly a matter of tradition? If 100 years ago the tradition started that girls wore dark blue,\nwould tough guys today wear pink sweatshirts taunting the guys who wore blue?\nWhat is the hair color of your dream lover?\nIf you had to eat maggots and there was no health or taste concern would you rather they\nwere cooked or live? Why?\nIn a dating relationship would you feel uncomfortable if the woman were much taller than\nthe man? Why?\nManipulating information\nWe all purposely limit the amount of information we receive. It\u2019s a normal, daily occurrence.\nThe human being doesn\u2019t have the mental ability to process everything at once, and must\npick and choose what it focuses on.\n\u201cCan we discuss this later? I\u2019m busy right now and don\u2019t want to lose my concentration.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t anyone tell me the score of last night\u2019s game. I had to work and recorded the game\nso I can watch it tonight.\u201d\n\u201cHoney, pull the shades. I don\u2019t even want to know what the neighbors are doing this time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to the Doctor, because I don\u2019t want to know if there\u2019s something wrong\nwith me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll look at my bank statement on Monday morning. This is the weekend and I want to\nenjoy myself.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re my parents for God\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t want to hear about their love life.\u201d\n17 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nTricking Yourself\nIt is probably no surprise to hear that humans trick or otherwise manipulate each other\u2026.\nEmbellishing one\u2019s job position to impress the future in-laws\u2026. Psyching out your opponent\nat the big ping pong tournament\u2026. Tricking your sibling out of the last donut\nHumans also trick or otherwise manipulate themselves. Many of the following examples\nare closely related to the previous limiting information examples.\n\u201cHoney, hide the bag of Doritos. You know I can\u2019t help myself if they\u2019re lying around.\u201d\n\u201cIf I buy myself a new power suit, I will have confidence for the meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to turn my watch ten minutes ahead so I\u2019m not always so late to meetings.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to force myself not to think about her. Maybe that will help heal my broken heart.\u201d\nGive two examples of how you trick or manipulate yourself.\n1188 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nKeeping Up Appearances\nWe all superficially dress up facts to suit our tastes. Even if we know the meaning remains\nthe same, outward appearances are important.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a secretary, I\u2019m an administrative assistant.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call it a toilet. That\u2019s crass. It\u2019s a restroom.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get a pay raise, better office or the other things I wanted, but I did convince the\nboss to change my title. You\u2019re looking at the new assistant director for data processing. I\ncan\u2019t wait to phone mom. She\u2019ll be so proud.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018damn.\u2019 Say \u2018darn.\u2019\u201d\nWhat euphemisms do you use?\nChoosing to pay for what is free\nI used to write an email newsletter about collectibles. While it had wide readership and received\npositive feedback, it was nearly impossible to get any donations of time or money to support\nit. I had planned on having a series of articles on collecting wirephotos \u2013 identification,\ndating, valuation. Before I was able to include the series, I decided I had enough of doing\nthe newsletter for free and ended it. With the newsletter finished, I computer printed and\nstapled the wirephotos articles into a Spartan 35 page booklet and offered it for sale for\nabout $7 a copy. Within the first week and a half I made more money from that little\nbooklet than I had received in donations in over two years of publishing the newsletter.\nBecause of their bias about how information should be disseminated (physically printed\nversus email), the readers chose to pay for information they would have received for free.\nNot that I was complaining.\nBiases\nMost conceits are based on biases. People\u2019s views of the world and even of facts are affected\nby biases.\nA bias is a strong preference for or against something for reasons that do not have a rational\nbasis. A bias can be identified when someone is offered the choice of items that are identical\n19 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nexcept for one subjective quality (color, shape, scent), and the person consistently picks a\nparticular item because of the subjective quality.\nEach morning five shirts are laid out on your bed. The shirts are identical other than in\ncolor. If you only or usually pick the blue shirt, you have a bias towards blue, at least as\nfar as the shirts go. If over time you wear all the shirts except the yellow, you have a bias\nagainst yellow shirts.\nWe all have a range of biases. We all have prejudices (meaning, making judgments before\nall the facts are in, or jumping to conclusions) and predilections (a strong liking or disliking\nof something based on temperament or prior experience).\nWhile the word bias often has a derogatory connotation, many biases are worthwhile and\neven helpful. We all have personal preferences that are positive influences on our lives.\nI feel no need to apologize for preferring Chinese food over Italian, Rachmaninov over\nBrahms or having a favorite color of blue. No one should run to the confessional because he\ndislikes watching basketball and loves to wear pearl earrings. Life would be boring without\npersonal preferences.\nThe problems arise when biases prevent us from being able to make what should be or we\nrepresent as rational judgments. Many of our biases make us jump to false conclusions.\nMany of our biases cloud what should be clear vision. Many people\u2019s biases prevent them\nfrom seeing the truth right in front of their eyes.\nWhen there is the latest political scandal, do you in part judge the guilt or innocence based\non the accused\u2019s political affiliation? Are you more likely to suspect him guilty if he is a\nmember of the other party? If he shares your political beliefs, are you more likely to ascribe\nthe accusations to being partisan attacks?\nIn the news there are all those latest health findings on what\u2019s good for you and what\u2019s bad\nfor you: drink this amount of wine weekly, eat this, avoid that, get this amount of exercise.\nWhen first hearing the latest health finding, do you in part judge the scientific validity\nof the report based on how it relates to your lifestyle? If you love red meat are you more\nlikely to accept at face value a report claiming the benefits of red meat and dismiss a report\nclaiming that red meat should be removed from one\u2019s diet?\nWhen an important medical report is given to the public on television, do you in part judge\nthe validity of the report based on what the doctor is wearing and from the setting? Even if\nthe report is the same, would you give more credence if the doctor is wearing a white lab\ncoat and stethoscope and speaking from a laboratory (test tubes, vials, scientific charts in\n20 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nthe background), as opposed to if he is wearing jeans and a well worn T-shirt and speaking\nfrom a junky park bench? Why do you think makers of commercials hawking that fad diet\nor libido pill use actors dressed like doctors in white lab coats?\nMany biases are subtle, many are innate. If we were born cats, we\u2019d have different priorities,\ndifferent ways of looking at things. We have habits we don\u2019t know exist until pointed out by\nothers. Movie makers know that lighting, camera angle and background music subconsciously\ninfluence the audience.\nKilling cockroaches\nThe traditional way to kill cockroaches is by taking a can of bug spray and spraying the\noffending creatures. Years back a company invented a different way for killing cockroaches.\nInstead of directly spraying the bugs, this company had a new disc that was discreetly\nplaced out of sight \u2013 under a bed or refrigerator, the back of a closet. This disc was more\neffective than the spray can \u2013 meaning, it killed more bugs. The company test marketed\nthe product on inner city single mothers who had cockroach problems in their homes and\nused bug spray. The mothers were shown how the disc worked and informed it would kill\n2211 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nmore cockroaches. When polled afterward, the majority of the women said they would not\npurchase the disc, as spraying the cockroaches gave them a sense of control.\nLearning from experience\nFigure 1.1 Former US President Bill Clinton and\nVice President Al Gore at a 1997 Press Conference\nMuch of how the human being sees, interprets and reacts is based on past experience.\nBoth consciously and nonconsciously we use past experience to show us the way things\nare. Sometimes we learn from repeated experiences, sometimes from a single experience,\nsometimes from what others tell us.\nMost of us have learned not to put our hands on a red burner on the stove because of\npersonal experience (ouch!) or because we were taught. We learn how to identify plants\nand animals through experience. Many people love to go up and smell roses because they\nknow what roses smelled like before.\nThrough repetition, or even a single experience, many things become second nature. We\nbarely have to be conscious of them. It\u2019s raining, reach for the umbrella. If a burner is\nbright red, don\u2019t touch it. Rabbits are soft and sidewalks are hard. Jiggle the handle on the\nupstairs toilet or the toilet will run all night. Alligators are dangerous. Chocolate is sweet.\nSalty and fatty foods are bad for you. Grass is green and beaches are sandy.\nOur nonconscious minds and bodies learn from experience \u2013 depth perception, reacting to\ngravity, balance. Athletes perfect their skills through practice. By repeating shots and moves,\nthe moves become second nature to the basketball player. Through practice the gymnast\ngains balance and muscle memory. Juggling and cycling become second nature with practice.\n22 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nNot only do humans learn from precedent, they gain psychological and even physical\nattachment to what they have learned. This is part of how habits become second nature.\nIf someone was bitten by a large dog as a kid she may shake with fear when a large dog\napproaches her on the street. If someone had childhood vacations at his favorite aunt and\nuncle\u2019s cabin near the beach, he may get a warm feeling when he sees a magazine picture\nof a similar beach.\nThis psychological aspect can be helpful. The practical use of the gut reactions should be\napparent in the following: instant fear when a Grizzly crosses your path, uneasy feeling and\nperhaps even nausea towards a piece of a meat that smells funny and has a strange color, a\nwarm feeling towards someone who gave you a fair shake when no one else would.\nThe problem is that no matter how seemingly logical or natural or how deep we feel it in\nour bones, what we learn as correct is not always correct. Often it\u2019s dead wrong. Scientists\nwould laugh at laboratory conclusions based on an arbitrary example or hearsay. Yet this is\nhow we learn in everyday life.\nEven your eyes can lie. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a second look at the earlier picture. It\nis not of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Both are Bill Clinton, but one has different hair. Your\nbrain and eyes were in the habit of seeing things a certain way.\nVisual illusions illustrate that even our brains have conceits about the way things are. Look\nat the four images.\n23 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nSpiral\nFigure 1.2 What may appear to be a spiral, is a series of circles.

It\u2019s just a picture of Greta Garbo wearing a hat.\nYou must admit it\u2019s interesting that after only several images you created a new\n(and false) logic. You started a minute ago interpreting as true a false image\n(Clinton) and ended up with interpreting as false a true image. Fascinating.\nAbsolute statements\nScrutiny reveals the fallacies in our sweeping, absolute statements about society or life or\npolitics or art or sports or television programming.\nA liberal mayor may proclaim from the podium, \u201cI am against all forms of racial bias\u201d yet\nsupports racial quotas for school admissions and government contracts. Shouldn\u2019t he really\nsay, \u201cI am against all forms of racial bias, except for the areas where I support racial bias\u201d?\nA conservative states\u2019 rights US Senator may proclaim, \u201cI am for states\u2019 rights and against\nthe national government imposing its will on states,\u201d then blocks a state from enacting a\nlaw he dislikes. Shouldn\u2019t the statement more accurately have been, \u201cI am for states\u2019 rights\nand against national government imposing its will on states, except for where I\u2019m not for\nstates\u2019 rights and am for national government imposing their will on states\u201d?\nLooking closely you will discover that most sweeping absolute statements are not about the\nperson attempting to be factually accurate, but trying to gain power relative to someone or\nsomething else. They are rhetorical flourishes. When a brother yells at his kid brother, \u201cYou\n26 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nalways ruin everything!,\u201d he knows the statement is not accurate. However, in the middle of\na sibling fight the statement \u201cYou do many things quite well and mom says you got a B+\non your last French quiz which is quite commendable, but you do mess up a percentage\nof things on various occasions\u201d doesn\u2019t pack the in the heat of the moment punch.\nPsychological ties\nThe human being is an emotional animal\u2026love, hate, romantic attachment, embarrassment,\nrepulsion, giddiness\u2026. This is part of who we are and how we interpret the world. Emotional\ninterpretation is often more important to humans than facts. Emotions regularly override\nor temper facts. And who\u2019s to say it\u2019s always a bad thing. Sticking by family through thick\nand thin isn\u2019t a bad rule of thumb.\nFor humans it is difficult and often impossible to separate meaning from emotion, facts\nfrom emotion, worth from emotion. What is right is supposed to feel right. Religious faith\ninvolves an emotional attachment to the ideas. There is an emotional connection to the art\nwe love. If there wasn\u2019t a psychological reaction to the actors on the screen and their story\nwho would pay good money to sit in the dark theatre for two hours?\n2277 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nNo matter how well plotted and witty the dialogue, a movie or novel is deemed unworthy if\nit doesn\u2019t move the critic. \u201cIt simply didn\u2019t move me\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t connect with the characters\u201d\nis considered appropriate critical judgment to be a newspaper critic.\nEven the most logical of people judge facts by their aesthetic appearance. An M.I.T.\nengineering professor will spend hours contemplating what picture and background color\nshould be on his upcoming textbook. He may have a fit if the publisher says the book\ncover will be hot pink.\nA mathematics professor may write and rewrite her equations so they are unsmudged, parallel\nto the top and bottom of the paper and with attractive margins. Even when the answers\nare correct, she may have students rewrite their homework that is not neat.\nEmotional reactions or states can be good and bad. Most would agree that love for your\nchildren, leading you to look out for their best interests, is good. Most would agree that\ngetting a warm feeling from kicking friendly dogs is not good.\nEmotional states can alter our landscapes. When we are head over heels in love, a drizzly\ngray day is gorgeous. When we are unrequited, a rainbow can weigh like lead in the heart.\nMood is an integral part of how we plan our lives\u2026 Getting the mood right for a romantic\nevening\u2026 Decorating the apartment to make you feel at home after a long day at work.\nSanity and Custom\nPeople tend to believe that sanity and insanity are absolute, objective terms, with a medical\ndoctor saying a patient is insane as she would say a patient has a broken arm or skin cancer.\nThe popular and legal definitions of sanity and insanity are based on that society\u2019s customs\nand even fashion. No matter what it is, if enough people are doing it won\u2019t be considered\ninsane behavior.\nIf you don\u2019t believe this, examine what currently socially acceptable behavior would be\ndeemed bizarre, if not psychotic, if no one else in society did them.\n\u2022 Decorative body mutilation, such as piercing one\u2019s ears and getting a tattoo\n\u2022 Lying in the sun with the expressed intention of turning brown\n\u2022 Taxidermy\n\u2022 Wearing makeup and styling and coloring one\u2019s hair\n\u2022 Taking an animal as a pet, giving it a name, walking it around the neighborhood\non a leash and telling people it\u2019s the new member of the family\n28 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\n\u2022 Expecting people to shake your outstretched hand when you meet, and acting\nslighted by those who don\u2019t\n\u2022 Manicuring one\u2019s lawn and garden, including cutting the shrubs into shapes\nIf you did all of these, and they were not done by anyone else, you would be considered\nby many mentally ill and in need of serious medical help.\nGiven once a year to a single college football player, the Heisman Trophy is the most\nfamous sports trophy in the United States. Unknown to each other, two former Heisman\nTrophy winners and their families lived in the same neighborhood. One afternoon, one\nof the men\u2019s sons came home disappointed in his dad. His dad had always told him how\nrare was the Heisman Trophy on the living room mantle, but the dad of the kid down the\nstreet had the same trophy.\nNew Environments\nThe BaMbuti Pygmies of Congo traditionally live their entire lives in the dense rainforest,\nwhere the furthest away anyone can see is feet. They learned, loved, played and hunted in\nthis environment. In his 1961 book The Forest People, anthropologist Colin Turnbull wrote\nhow he took one of these Pygmies, named Kenge, for his first time to a wide open plain.\nAs the two stood on a hill overlooking the flat land, a group of water buffalo was seen a\nfew miles away. Having no experience of how things appear smaller over long distance,\nKenge asked what kind of insects they were. Turnbull told him they were buffalo and Kenge\nlaughed loudly at the \u201cstupid story.\u201d Turnbull drove Kenge towards the buffalo. Watching\nthe animals growing visually larger, Kenge became scared and said it was witchcraft.\nHuman beings develop an idiosyncratic logic and sensibility distinct to the environment\nwhere they were brought up. The environment one grows up in is seemingly the world. A\nkid born and raised in the inner city versus the country, rich versus poor, in Cairo versus\nChicago, conservative family versus liberal, woods versus desert. The person who has lived\nher whole life in Portland or Cairo may get a chuckle at that story about the Pygmy then\ndismiss the idea that a similar incongruity could exist with her native logic.\nAs Kenge interpreted the open expanse based on his jungle experience, humans interpret\nsuch esoteric and largely unfathomable things as the afterlife and the meaning of the\nuniverse based on their limited experience. It should not be surprising that common human\ninterpretation of the supernatural largely has an earthly sensibility. The supernatural beings\noften dress like humans, live in night and day, drink and eat human-style meals, speak and\nread and write, play human-style instruments and games, and even sneeze. It should not be\n29 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\na surprise that to the Ancient Egyptians the gods dressed like Egyptians and to the Ancient\nGreeks the gods dressed like Greeks.\nWhich black dot is larger?\nFigure 1.6\n3300 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN CONCEITS: AN INTRODUCTORY LOOK AT HOW\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS HUMANS THINK AND PERCEIVE\nThe two dots in Figure 1.6. Measure them yourself. It is your lifelong experience with\ndiminishing scales in open spaces that caused you to perceive the upper dot as larger. Kenge\nwould not have been fooled by this illusion.\nJohn Nash\u2019s Aliens\nJohn Nash was a famed mathematician and winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Economics\nwho was paranoid schizophrenic. While an instructor at M.I.T. and Princeton, Nash suffered\nsevere mental episodes and dropped out of society. He began hallucinating, hearing voices\nin his head. In this state he deduced that aliens were talking to him.\nTo most of us his conclusion seems loopy. It does reveal how the human mind works. In a\nsituation well beyond his experience he wanted a concrete answer for what was happening.\nWhile bizarre, the aliens conclusion \u2018logically\u2019 matched his illogical situation. It is abnormal\nto hear voices in one\u2019s head so, when one starts hearing voices, normal everyday answers will\nnot explain. It can be expected that someone will explain the abnormal with an abnormal\nanswer, especially when he is in a confused mental state. It is likely no coincidence that\nNash nonconsciously picked a conceit that was part of popular culture.\nYears later when he had largely recovered from his mental problems, Nash was asked how\nhe had come to the conclusion that aliens were talking to him. He said that he came to\nthat conclusion in the same intuitive way that he came to the mathematical conclusions\nthat won him the Nobel Prize.\nEndnote\nAs this the previous chapter illustrates, human perception, judgment and action is formed\nby a complex mix of fact and fiction, rationality and irrationality, logic and emotion. Even\nthat M.I.T. engineering professor and the math professor were influenced by personal tastes.\n31 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the humAn mInd As A Computer?\n2 THE HUMAN MIND AS\nA COMPUTER?\nThis chapter introduces the idea of the mind as an information processor.\n2.1 THE COMPUTATION THEORY OF MIND\nAs already noted in Chapter 1: Conceits, the human exists in an environment and universe\nwell beyond its knowledge and senses. The human eyes detect only a limited amount of\nlight, the ears only limited sounds, our physical position in geography and time limits our\nview, the brain receives more information than it can process. Yet, in this situation, the\nhuman must make practical and often instantaneous perceptions and judgments to function,\nsurvive and thrive.\nMany scientists, psychologists and philosophers, say the human mind is like a computer. Some\neven say it is a computer, if a biological one. In philosophy, this is called the computational\ntheory of mind.\nLike a computer, the human detects limited input information (sensory information) and\nuses internal methods to process the information and produce an output (perception,\njudgment as to what to do, etc.).\nLike a computer, the human mind is not omniscient and makes educated guesses about\nwhat is going on and what to do. The human is intelligent and experienced, but, as it is\nusing limited information and methods, these guesses have an inherent margin of error.\nSometimes a perception or choice in action is correct, at least within a reasonable margin of\nerror, while other times it is wrong. Visual illusions shown throughout this book demonstrate\nhow the guesses can be wrong.\n2.2 AMBIGUITY\nHumans have learned and inborn mental methods, biases and assumptions used to consciously\nand nonconsciously identify things and judge the complex information in our daily lives. We\ncompare side-by-side objects to judge size and speed. We identify distant silhouetted objects\nby how their shapes match up with our memories. We \u2018recognize\u2019 objects and qualities in\npaintings, sketches and movies using these same nonconscious methods.\n32 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the humAn mInd As A Computer?\nRealize that humans never see the entirety of an object or scene, any object or scene. Not\nonly are things such as coffee cups and sticks and tree branches partially visibly obscured\nby overlapping other objects, but we can never see all sides and parts of an object at once.\nEven with an apple you\u2019ve turned over in your hands, you can\u2019t be sure whether it is fresh\nor rotten in the core until you bite or cut it apart. Humans live, learn and learn how to\nprocess and judge information in an environment where information is always obscured or\notherwise hidden from view.\nAmbiguity is a concept essential to understanding humans, as humans constantly make choices\nin the face of ambiguous information. Often caused by missing, obscured or unknowable\ninformation, ambiguity means there is more than one possible explanation for something,\nand the viewer doesn\u2019t know, often can\u2019t know, which one is correct. In the face of ambiguity,\nthe mind will almost always pick the explanation that meets its expectations and experience.\n2.3 REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED\nAs you are reading this book, keep in mind that speed is an important quality of the mind,\nas the human must make quick, often instant decisions. This is a requirement of practical\n3333 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the humAn mInd As A Computer?\nfunction and survival. Everything from walking through a new room to assessing what to do\nwhen a large shape is moving at you in the dark requires speedy perceptions and decisions.\nOur mind is designed (for lack of a better word) to make speedy, automatic decisions, and\nthat is a source for many of the errors of perception and judgment.\n2.4 QUESTIONS\n1) What are some reasons for ambiguity and lack of knowledge in our perceptions of\neveryday scenes? Give some examples.\n2) Why is speed needed for the human mind? Give some specific examples.\n3) Advanced study question: For this book, the idea that a mind is \u201ccomputer-like\u201d is\nuseful, in that the mind takes in information and has methods and mechanism to\nprocess the information to come up with a perception and judgment as to what to\ndo. However, there have been many arguments for and against the that the mind\nis a computer, or at least specific kinds of computers. Look up online and explain\nsome of the against the computational theory (that the human mind is a computer).\nDo you think the mind is like a computer? While giving logical reasons, feel free\nto state your opinion.\n34 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS InternAl methods for mAkIng perCeptIons: IntroduCtIon\n3 INTERNAL METHODS FOR\nMAKING PERCEPTIONS:\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following chapters show some examples of the often subconscious and automatic methods\nthe mind uses to process, order and make judgments about the complex and ambiguous\ninformation it encounters. These are ones you use daily, minute by minute, in your life to\nidentify objects, judge speed, distance, size and more.\nWhile these methods are essential to human functioning, and largely effective, you will see\nthere are inherent margins of error, and produce many errors in judgment and perception.\nThe methods shown in the following chapters are:\n\u2022 Shape and pattern recognition: the subconscious ability to subjectively pick our\nforms, shapes, patterns and figures in complex and ambiguous information, such\nas seeing animal in clouds.\n\u2022 Comparison: Making judgments and perceptions by comparing objects and qualities\nwith each other, such as judging size by comparing side-by-side objects.\n\u2022 Imagination: Making whole perceptions by filling in missing information.\n\u2022 Visual perception: The internal methods the eyes and mind use to process light\nto \u2018see.\u2019\n35 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\n4 SHAPE, FORM AND\nPATTERN BIASES\nThis chapter looks at a common automatic bias that helps form visual perception.\nFigure 4.1\n3366 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\n4.1 OVERVIEW\nHuman visual perception is profoundly influenced by biases about forms, shapes and\npatterns. Humans have ingrained and nonconscious attractions for specific forms, shapes\nand patterns. Some of these biases are innate, while others are learned. These biases greatly\ninfluence how we perceive, organize and label, and are essential to the quick identifications\nneeded to go through life.\nYou instantly perceived a dog in the black shape that started this chapter, even though the\nshape lacked fur, eyes, whiskers, correct size and other essential doggy details. You didn\u2019t\nhave to contemplate the shape. You perceived it instantly.\nThe problem for humans is that their biases for certain shapes, forms and patterns are so\nstrong and ingrained that they will perceive these things when don\u2019t objectively exist. These\nbiases lead to many visual illusions.\nOur form and pattern biases are shown when we perceive horses or castles or hot rods or\nother familiar shapes in clouds. These \u2018identifications\u2019 are subjective to the viewer, and do\nnot objectively exist in the cloud. There are thousands of possible connect-the-dot shapes\nin a cloud, but you perceive, or mentally pick out, that which matches your knowledge.\nThe horse or castle is a projection of what exists in your mind. If there were no horses on\nearth or in fantasy books, you would not perceive a horse in the cloud, as you wouldn\u2019t\n\u2018recognize\u2019 it.\nFigure 4.2\nIn Figure 4.2 perceive a person in the lines and squiggles of the Rembrandt etching just as\nmany do an animal in the cloud.\n37 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nThe connect-the-dot figures in stars don\u2019t exist except as we draw them. The familiar faces\nor figures we perceive in burnt toast, wood grain and stones are projections of our minds.\nWhat you perceive is as much a reflection of you as what you are looking at.\nI hope it dawns on you when you pick up a stone that \u2018looks just like Elvis,\u2019 the stone\nexisted long before Elvis was born. It would be silly to believe the stone was formed by\nglaciers 10,000 years ago to commemorate Elvis\u2019 future rise to popularity on the pop charts.\n4.2 THE FACE ON MARS\nFigure 4.3\nIn 1976 the NASA spacecraft Viking 1 took photographs of an area on the planet Mars\nthat contained many giant mesas, craters and other geological formations. One of the\nmesas in the photographs somewhat resembled a human face. As should not be unexpected,\nmany humans on earth became interested in this \u2018human face\u2019 (and, not surprising, were\nless interested in the formations that didn\u2019t resemble human body parts). Some were and\nstill are convinced the mesa was constructed by intelligent life form. This perception of a\nface is a pattern bias, a projection of the viewer\u2019s mind whose own face has a similar form.\nIf someone has patterns in her mind (human face, kitty cat, square, letter \u2018B,\u2019 house key,\nbaseball cap, house) and looks at enough information (such as all the geological formations\non a planet\u2019s surface), she will be able to pick out some of these patterns in the information.\nSeeing the \u2018face of Nixon\u2019 isn\u2019t proof a potato was built by intelligent life form. It means\nthat out of millions and millions and millions of potatoes, a few are bound to somewhat\nresemble a former US President who had a sticky outy nose.\nAs the following images show, the face on Mars is just one of many mesas, hills and craters\nthat come in a wide variety of shapes.\n38 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nFigure 4.4\n3399 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nFigure 4.5 Just another mesa in the crowd\nFigure 4.6: The mesa at a different light angle\nYears later, the above photograph of the same mesa was shot at a different angle and time of\nday. This shows that angle and shadow contributed to the perception of a face. If originally\nshot at this angle and time of day, the mesa may not have been perceived as a face and\nhumans on earth would have considered it no more significant than any of the other blobs\nin the photographs.\n40 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nFigure 4.7 Smiley face of Mars?\n4.3 IS IT A VASE OR TWO FACES\nFigure 4.8 Is it a Vase or Two Faces?\nThe standard \u2018Is it a vase or is it two faces looking at each other?\u2019 visual illusion shows that\nhumans project a subjective, or personal, identity onto an object. You initially see a black\nvase or a pair of white faces looking at each other. As you stare longer your perception will\nbe replaced by the other view, then your perception will flip back and forth between the\ntwo views. The image is unchanging, while your perception of it changes.\nOf course, it is neither a vase nor faces, but a black and white abstract pattern. The pattern\ncould be perceived as many things. However, in part by your biases and by the leading\nquestion (\u2018Is it a vase or faces?\u2019), you perceived a vase and faces. As I look at the image, I\ncould see how the top or bottom portion could be perceived as two boots placed back to\n41 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nback. The chin to nose areas could be perceived as little black faces. The black shape could\nbe seen as a table. In fact, there\u2019s no reason, beyond viewer\u2019s predilection for order, that the\npattern has to depict anything specific.\nThe following are examples of perceptions through shape, pattern and form biases.\nFigure 4.9\n4422 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS shApe, form And pAttern bIAses\nFigure 4.10\nFigure 4.11\nAn old joke:\nA psychologist shows his new patient a Rorschach inkblot picture and asks her what she\nsees. She giggles and says \u201cIt\u2019s a naked man and a naked woman kissing.\u201d He shows her\nanother Rorschach inkblot and asks what she sees. She giggles again and says \u201cIt\u2019s a man\nand a woman making love on a table.\u201d He shows her another Rorschach picture and she says\n\u201cIt\u2019s a couple having sex in bed.\u201d The psychologist says \u201cYou seem to have a preoccupation\nwith sex.\u201d She says, \u201cMe?! You\u2019re the one with the dirty pictures.\u201d\n4.4 QUESTIONS\nDoes all seemingly objective perception involve subjective shape and pattern biases? Can\nour \u2018objective\u2019 identification of an object be legitimately perceived and identified in different\nways? Is human identification and definition of objects the result of a species bias, and other\nspecies might legitimately identify and define things differently?\n43 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIons vIA CompArIson\n5 PERCEPTIONS VIA COMPARISON\nThis chapter shows how humans identify and judge qualities such as size and distance by comparing\nqualities and objects, and how this can lead to errors in perception.\nA B\nFigure 5.1 Circles A and B are the same size. It is the surrounding grey circles that make circle B\nappear smaller.\nHuman perception of objects is influenced by nearby objects, qualities and other information.\nBoth consciously and nonconsciously we judge things through comparison. To measure fabric\none compares the cloth to a yard stick. To judge the size of someone\u2019s hand, you might\npress your palm against hers. To judge someone\u2019s speed, you might race him or watch him\nrace someone else.\nIn often less exacting comparisons, humans judge the length, height, angle, shape, color\nand distance by comparing one object to others in the scene. Looking at a family snapshot\nphoto you might guess the height of a stranger by comparing him to someone you know.\nYou will guesstimate the distance to a house by comparing its size to the sizes of closer\nhouses and trees. You will guesstimate an angle by comparing it to a level line (\u201cAppears\nto be about 10\u201315% off from level\u201d).\nOften these guesstimates are accurate within a reasonable degree. You might guess that\nstranger in the photo is 6 feet tall, as you know your aunt is 5\u00b45\u02dd. When you meet him,\nyou may discover he\u2019s 5\u00b410\u20131/2\u02dd. Not perfect, but a darn good guess \u2013 especially as you were\nunable to clearly see what shoes they had been wearing.\n44 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIons vIA CompArIson\nA problem is that, while comparing to other objects is essential to making judgments,\ncomparisons can lead to errors. Seemingly logical comparisons can produce answers that\nare bizarrely wrong. These errors happen when assumptions about an object or about the\noverall scene are wrong.\nWhat happens if you incorrectly remembered your aunt as 6 feet tall, instead of 5\u00b45\u02dd, as\nthe last time you saw her you were a five year old munchkin? Your calculations of the man\u2019s\nheight will be similarly off. You might incorrectly guess he was 6\u00b47\u02dd. What happens if she\nwas wearing flats in the photo, while he, shy about his height, was wearing lifts? What\nhappens if the man couldn\u2019t make the family reunion and a cousin photo-shopped in an\nimage of him?\n4455 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIons vIA CompArIson\nFigure 5.2 The above two horizontal lines are straight and parallel. The angled\nbackground makes them appear to bend. Without the angled background, the lines\nwould appear parallel.\nFigure 5.3 The men are the same size. Measure them yourself. It is the skewed diminishing\nscale lines that make them appear to be of different sizes.\nFigure 5.4 There is no bulge in this checkerboard. The horizontal and vertical\nlines are perfectly square and even. It is the triangles in the corners of the\nmiddle squares that make it appear to bulge.\n46 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIons vIA CompArIson\nCamouflage: Seeing But Not Perceiving\nFigure 5.5\nWith some forms of camouflage, such as a brown chameleon standing in front of a matching\nbrown rock, you see the chameleon but don\u2019t perceive it. Your eyes and mind receive the\nsame visual chameleon information as when the chameleon is standing in front of a white\nsheet. This is how a chameleon or arctic fox can hide in open view.\n5.1 QUESTIONS\n1) Does all human perception require comparison and contrast? How about all human\nthinking and ideas?\n2) How does one\u2019s education, experience and culture play into comparison and\nidentification?\n47 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon vIA CompArIson: the shepArd sCAle\n6 PERCEPTION VIA COMPARISON:\nTHE SHEPARD SCALE\nThis chapter looks at a famous audio illusion.\nFigure 6.1 The Shepard scale audial illusion is often compared to the neverending\nstaircase where you seem to be continually moving up the staircase (or down,\ndepending which direction you follow the steps), yet end up where you started.\n4488 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon vIA CompArIson: the shepArd sCAle\n6.1 OVERVIEW\nInvented by Stanford cognitive science professor Roger N. Shepard, the Shepard scale is a\nfamous auditory illusion. An auditory illusion is like a visual illusion but involves hearing\ninstead of sight.\nThe Shepard\u2019s scale sounds to the listener as if it\u2019s continually going down \u2013 or continually\nup, depending if the notes are played the opposite way. However, the sound is really a\nrepeated scale of tones, much like the repeated loop of steps of the staircase that takes you\nto where you started. The tones do not continually go down (or up), it only seems that way.\nSearch online, such as on youtube, to find examples if this illusion.\n6.2 HOW THE SHEPARD SCALE WORKS\nThe Shepard scale involves a carefully and calculated manipulation of tones, just as the steps\nin the never-ending staircase were carefully crafted to trick the eye. Shepard\u2019s manipulation\ninvolves not only which tones are played but the volume of the individual notes in the tones.\nEach tone in the scale is comprised of several notes played simultaneously, and at each\nmoment different notes in the tone are played at different volumes. Some notes are played\nloudly, while others are near inaudible. The changes to volume have the listener focusing\non certain notes and not others. As with the steps in the staircase, the key to the trickery\nis each tone seems to sound lower than the preceding (higher if the notes are played the\nother way) even if it really isn\u2019t.\nThe listener judges subtle gradations in tone by comparing it to the preceding note, not\nto tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago and certainly not to future notes. If each tone\nappears lower than the previous, the listener will think the sound continually going down.\nSo how the heck can you make a lower tone sound higher?\nAt first this may seem like an impossible task, but it\u2019s simple when you manipulate the\nvolumes of the notes within the tone. Just look at the below tones.\n49 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon vIA CompArIson: the shepArd sCAle\na b\nFigure 6.3\nIn Figure 6.3 a and b are the same tone, each with the same three notes. How would you\nlower the notes in tone b, while making it sound higher than a? The answer is by changing\nthe volumes of the notes.\na b\nFigure 6.4\nIf you alter the volumes of the notes (Figure 6.4), you can make lowered b sound higher.\nThe black notes are played loudly, while the whites are played very softly. As you can see,\nthe loud notes of b are higher than the two loud notes of a.\nThe changing of the volume works as an audial mask, with masking or hiding of information\nbeing a common element of both audio and visual illusions. If you put your fingers or\npieces of white paper over the white notes in the bottom picture, tone b will also look like\na higher tone. This shows you that the Shepard scale really is much like a visual illusion.\nThe repeated Shepard scale involves a much more complex and larger variety of tones, notes\nand volume manipulations.\n6.3 QUESTION\nWhat are examples of sound illusions, or misidentification of sound, in normal life? Explain\nhow they work.\nI remember as a kid listening for the first time to a Haydn piece and being disappointed\nin the composer as the piece lifted a melody from a Mozart piece I\u2019d often heard before.\nAfter looking into it, I learned that the Haydn piece had been composed first and Mozart\nlifted from it.\n50 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\n7 IMAGINATION\nThis chapter explains how imagination is an integral part of human thinking and perception\nand leads to many misperceptions.\nFigure 7.1 When shown this cropped image,\nmost people imagine a whole vase to exist.\n5511 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\n7.1 OVERVIEW\nWhen looking at a scene, all humans have the natural and nonconscious ability to extrapolate\nbeyond what is visible. When information is missing, or assumed to be missing, humans\nmake it up in their minds.\nThis ability is essential to normal living, as we must regularly make quick guesses with\nlimited information. When you step on a sturdy looking building step, you assume it will\nhold your weight. When you pull a book from the library shelf, you assume the pages are\nfilled with words. When your waitress brings you a steaming mug, you assume it is filled\nwith a hot liquid.\nIn many cases the extrapolation is accurate, or at least a fair estimate of reality. If your dog\nis standing on the other side of the open doorway, half hidden by the wall, you correctly\nassume an entire dog exists. As the dog steps forward into the room, your assumption is\nproven correct. When the waitress puts down your steaming coffee mug, you are far from\nsurprised to see it\u2019s filled with the hot coffee you ordered. Humans would be a dim, slow\nspecies if we couldn\u2019t make these kinds of elemental deductions.\nIn many cases, however, the extrapolations are wrong. These bogus extrapolations involving\nthe viewer non-consciously perceiving what he wants to see or expects to see.\nThe following pages show examples of correct and incorrect perceptions based on imagining\nwhat is not seen.\nFigure 7.2 Though the dogs block our view we assume there is snow behind them\nlike the snow we see surrounding them. This assumption is likely correct.\n52 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\nFigure 7.3 Though the overlapping prevents us from ever knowing, most will\nassume the above shows whole playing cards. I assume the cards are\nrectangular and whole.\nFigure 7.4 This image says I Love You several times:\nFigure 7.5 Now read the same text below with the ruler removed:\n53 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\nFigure 7.6 In the above, most perceive a cube behind the\nthree diagonal bands.\n5544 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\nFigure 7.7 With the bands removed, we perceive something different.\nFigure 7.8 Many perceive a white triangle above,\neven though there isn\u2019t one.\n7.2 AMES CARD TRICK\nAdelbert Ames Jr. (1880\u20131955) was a Dartmouth College scientist famed for his pioneering\nstudies of visual perception. From his experiments he learned that human perception is\ninfluenced by expectations.\nIn one experiment he used a deck of playing cards standard except in size. Some cards\nwere much larger than the others. In a specially designed viewing station he had people\nwatch the cards being shuffled. As the viewers assumed the cards were the same size, they\nperceived the larger cards as being closer and the smaller cards as being further away. Their\nmisperception about size created a second misperception about distance.\n55 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\n7.3 CAPTCHAS: HOW COMPUTERS USE COGNITIVE\nPSYCHOLOGY TO IDENTIFY USERS AS HUMAN\nFigure 7.9 a Captcha\nWe\u2019ve all had been asked to type in the letters and numbers in those funky pictures on\nwebsites, such as pictured above. These pictures are called CAPTCHAs and are used to\ntry to identify if a visitor to a website is human or computer. Online banks, stores, news\nsites, chat boards and other sites want to weed out automated programs that try to steal\ninformation and spam message boards.\nThe question you may have is how do these pictures identify a user as human.\nCAPTCHAs are designed around human shape and pattern biases and the human\u2019s natural\nability to guess at or pick out identities in ambiguous information.\nThe letters and numbers in the CAPTCHAs aren\u2019t literally the letters and numbers, but\nabbreviated, mixed up, distorted versions, often with other information (visual noise)\noverlapping and/or surrounding it.\nWhen told to pick out the symbols, the human picks out which letters and numbers they\nperceive. The symbols don\u2019t perfectly match the textbook letters and numbers, but the\nhuman guesses what they most approximate.\nComputers can eventually, or at least sometimes, identify the symbols but it takes longer.\nThey have more difficulty with the ambiguous, messy and mixed up images.\nFigure 7.10 Humans can make out different individual letters in the above\nCAPTCHA, but it\u2019s really just one connected graphic.\nWhat is particularly interesting is that CAPTCHAS use human\u2019s ability to misperceive, or\nperceive what isn\u2019t there, for practical use.\n56 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\n7.4 HIDDEN INFORMATION AND IDENTIFICATION\nFigure 7.11\nMany physical qualities of and between objects are identified by obscured or otherwise\nhidden visual information. Distance is often judged by objects overlapping each other and\nthings becoming harder to see over distance. Material is in part identified by its opacity.\nObscured visual information both helps and hinders our identification. When something\nis far away, the lack of detail (small and blurry) serves to both help us judge its distance\n5577 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\nand prevents us from identifying the object. A closed closet door shows us that the door is\nin front of the things in the closet, but prevents us from knowing what are those things.\nLack of information is both lack of information and information.\nThat some parts of the above table visually obscure other parts help the viewer identify it\nas a table.\nFigure 7.12 Overlapping, and the resulting hidden visual information, help\nshow that the people are in front of the tree and the tree is in front of the wall.\nFigure 7.13\n58 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ImAgInAtIon\nIf a human perceives a hare in the above picture and a dog does not, which animal is\ndemonstrating better visual perception? Humans sometimes use as evidence of a dog\u2019s\ndimwittedness that the dog \u2018doesn\u2019t see\u2019 the human being or animal in a magazine or book,\nwhen, of course, there isn\u2019t a human or animal being on the page. It is paper and ink. From\nits sense of smell alone, the dog knows there ain\u2019t no animal there. The dog is faulted for\nnot seeing what isn\u2019t there.\n7.5 QUESTIONS\n1) What are examples of how imagination can lead to misidentification or visual\nillusions (visual illusions are automatic misidentifications)?\n2) How is imagination a good, even advanced, thing? Give examples.\n3) Does all human perception involve imagination?\n4) Look up online the \u2018Ames Room\u2019 and briefly explain how the room is designed to\ntrick the viewer.\n5) Advanced topic: Look up online and give a brief explanation of Gestalt psychology.\n5599 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AttrIbutIon substItutIon\n8 ATTRIBUTION SUBSTITUTION\nThis chapter demonstrates a common automatic cognitive method for solving visual problems\nFigure 8.1\nWhich cyclist is going fastest? Most will say the cyclist on our left is going the fastest and\nthe one on the right the slowest. There are, however, unanswered questions that make it\nimpossible to know.\nDid they start at the same place? Did they start at the same time? Are they moving forward\nor backward? Are they moving? I\u2019ve seen sprint cyclists stand still during a race. Even if it\u2019s\na normal 1-2-3-Go! race, it\u2019s possible the guy on the right is going the fastest and the guy\non the left the slowest at the moment the image was shot. Catching up, slowing down and\nswitching positions are normal parts of all races. The initial guess was made on a made-up\nsimplified explanation to a more complex and ambiguous photo.\nIn cognitive psychology, attribution substitution is an automatic subconscious process\nthat the mind uses to make speedy decisions needed to function, but contributes to many\ncognitive biases, misperceptions and visual illusions.\nIt is a heuristic, or mental shortcut, used when someone has to make a make a judgment\nabout a complex, ambiguous situation and substitutes a more easily solved situation. The\nsubstitution is done at the automatic subconscious level and the person doesn\u2019t realize\nhe or she is actually answering a related but different question. It is comparable to a\nstrawman argument.\n60 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AttrIbutIon substItutIon\nThis helps explains why many individuals can be unaware of their own biases and even\npersist in the bias when they are made aware of them.\nAn example is when you judge the intelligence or beliefs of a stranger by his or her looks,\nfashion, age, race, sex, accent or nationality.\nDetermining a person\u2019s intelligence and beliefs is a complex question and must be done at\nthe examined person-by-person level, but, even those who claim they don\u2019t, make automatic\njudgments from their stereotypes (simplified generalizations) before they\u2019ve talked to the\nperson or even when shown a picture. As said, this is an automatic process.\nPeople judge a work of art by deciding what they think it is \u2013 how the pieces fit together,\nwhat is its intended meaning, genre etc. \u2013 then judging that. When someone says a work of\nart is trite and silly, what he is saying is his interpretation of what is the art is trite and silly.\nI didn\u2019t say the work can\u2019t also be trite and silly.\n6611 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\n9 VISION: WHAT YOU SEE\nIS DIFFERENT THAN\nWHAT YOU LOOK AT\nThis human shows how human vision works and how it is a distortion of reality\nFigure 9.1\n9.1 INTRODUCTION\nDespite common belief, humans do not perceive a direct and exact representation of external\nreality, but a distorted translation formed by their eyes and mind. The image we see is different\nthan what we are looking at. This is not some coffee house theory, but physiological fact.\nThe human eyes and brain do a decent but imperfect job at detecting and translating light.\nThis chapter is a look at the physiology of seeing and offers examples of optical distortion\ncaused by the eyes and mind.\n62 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\n9.2 A QUICK LOOK AT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SEEING\nFigure 9.2\nWhen a human looks at an object, light from the object enters the eyes. The light goes\nthrough the cornea, which is a clear covering, then through the pupil which is a clear circle\nin the center of the colored part of the eye called the iris. The pupil gets larger (dilates)\nwhen there is little light and smaller when there is more light. The lens focuses the light\nthrough the aqueous humor, a clear liquid, onto the retina. The retina, in the back of the\neye, contains millions of tiny photosensors that detect the light. There are two main kinds\nof photo sensors, called rods and cones. Shaped like rods, rods detect shades and forms and\nare needed for night and peripheral vision. Rods are not good at detecting color. Shaped\nlike cones, cones are needed for seeing details, seeing in daylight and detecting colors.\nCones do not work well in low light. Rods and cones cover the entire retina except for a\nspot where the optic nerve connects to the brain. The optic nerve carries the information\nreceived from the retina to the brain, where the brain translates it into the single image\nwe perceive, or \u2018see.\u2019\n9.3 THE BLIND SPOT\nAll humans have blind spots, which are spots where the eye cannot see. The blind spot\ncorresponds to the spot on the retina where the optical nerve connects the retina to the\nbrain. At this spot there are no light detecting cells and, thus, it cannot detect light. A\nsmall object can disappear from view.\nIn everyday life the blind spot goes unnoticed. This is in part because the eye is constantly\nlooking around, getting a wide and varied range of views. It is also in part as the brain uses\nthe information from both eyes to create the single mental vision. What one eye misses,\nthe other often picks up.\nAs its optical nerve connects differently, the octopus has no blind spot.\n63 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\n9.4 DETECTING YOUR BLIND SPOT\nL R\nFigure 9.3\nTo detect your blind spot using the just shown letters L and R, hold the book about two feet\nin front of your face, close your right eye and look at the letter R. Slowly move your head\nforward, towards the picture. At one point the L will disappear. The L will also disappear\nif you start up close and slowly move back. Notice that the missing spot is filled in white\nby your mind, so it appears as if nothing is missing from your view. This illustrates how\nyour blind spot goes unnoticed during daily living. Many people live their entire life not\nknowing they have a blind spot.\nHumans have more glaring blind spots. Due to the placement of our eyes in our head, we\ncan\u2019t naturally see behind us, under our feet, from the top of our head, behind our elbows.\nA common saying to explain why we didn\u2019t notice something is, \u201cI don\u2019t have eyes in the\nback of my head.\u201d And it\u2019s common knowledge that if you want to sneak up on a person\nyou approach from behind. We compensate for these blinds spots by turning around, moving\nour heads, using a mirror or other reflection, saying \u201cWho\u2019s that behind me?,\u201d listening,\nnoticing shadows.\n6644 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nOther animals have different eye placement and fields of view. As a robin has its eyes on\nthe side of its head, it has better side view but worse directly ahead view. The robin\u2019s life\ndepends on its being able to detecting predators from the side and back. When hunting for\nworms in the grass, robins turn their heads. Some think they are turning their ear to listen\nfor worms, when they are turning their heads to see in front of them. A wolf, which is a\nhunter stalking prey, has eyes placement best suited for seeing ahead. The wolf sees better\nstraight ahead, but its side to side vision is worse than a robin\u2019s. A crocodile has eyes that\nrise above the rest of its head. Not only does this create a different field of view, but allows\nthe crocodile to see above water while the most of its head and body are hidden below water.\nFigure 9.4 Different eye placements on non-human animals\n9.5 AFTERIMAGES\nAfterimages are when, after staring at an object, you look away and still see an image of the\nobject. An example is when you still see the nighttime headlights of a car, even though your\neyes have closed and the car has turned away. Another is when after looking away from a\ncandle flame in the dark you still see light in the shape of the candle flame.\nAfterimages happen after the retina\u2019s photosensors (the rods and cones in your eyes)\nbecome over saturated, or burned out, from staring at a particular color. This burning out\nis comparable to lifting weights in the weight room. After doing enough arm curls you lose\nyour arm curl strength for a short while and will be able to lift only lighter weights. Your\nmuscles are fatigued, if only temporarily, from all that weight lifting.\nSimilarly, after staring at a large area of a single color, the eye\u2019s photosensors lose their strength\nfor that color. If right afterwards the eyes look at a blank piece of paper, the photosensors\nwill be weak towards the previously stared at color but fresh and strong for detecting the\nother colors. This imbalance causes the mind to perceive the image (the afterimage), but\nin the color opposite to the original color. To the mind, the weakness towards one color\nmeans the presence of the opposite primary color is stronger. Quirky perhaps, but this is\nthe way the brain works.\n65 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nIf you are staring at a green image, the afterimage should be red (the opposite primary\ncolor). After staring at a yellow image, the afterimage should be blue. The mind sees\nafterimages in primary colors, so any non-primary color (orange, pink, etc.) will be seen\nas the primary opposite.\nThough they occur almost constantly, afterimages usually go unnoticed. Afterimages are best\nobserved when focusing on a single color or object for a lengthy period of time. In normal\nabout the house viewing we view a wide range of objects and colors at once and our eyes\nare always moving around, the view constantly shifting. In these cases, the afterimages are\nminor and get lost in the visual shuffle. We barely if at all notice them.\n9.6 BINOCULAR VISION\nHumans have binocular vision, meaning the single image we see in our mind is made from\ntwo different views \u2013 one from each eye.\nBinocular vision gives humans a number of advantages. One is we have a wider field of\nview than if we had only one eye. The right eye can see further to the right and the left eye\nfurther to the left. The single vision in our mind shows more than either single eye can see.\nAnother advantage is the two views give us imperfect but good depth perception. People\nwho are blind in one eye have worse depth perception than the average human.\nThe mythical Cyclops might at first appear an unbeatable foe, but a wily human opponent\ncould take advantage of the monster\u2019s poor depth perception and narrow field of vision.\n9.7 TRIANGULARISM AND CALCULATING DEPTH\nBinocular vision produces the perception of depth in a way similar to how triangularism\nmeasures length in applied mathematics. When looking at a distant point using only one\npoint of view it is hard to impossible to determine the distance accurately. In applied\nmathematics, triangularism can accurately calculate this distance from point a to point b\nby creating an imaginary triangle. Triangularism has long been used in the real world to\nmeasure distant objects, such as islands and boats from land and when surveying land.\n66 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nb b\n??\na\na\nc\nFigure 9.5 Triangularism: From point a alone, it can be impossible to accurately calculate\nthe distance to point b. In the real world, point a could be you standing on land and point\nb an anchored boat out at sea. However, by taking angle measurements from point a, then\ntaking an angle measurement from nearby point c (perhaps a walking distance away), and\nmeasuring the distance from point a to c, one can create an imaginary triangle that calculates\nthe distance from point a to point b. It\u2019s just a matter calculating angles and doing the math.\nTwo eyes give the mind a similar two point view, and the mind uses these two views to\njudge distance. This is mostly done nonconsciously. You simply reach out and grab that\npencil or door knob, no problem. If you wear an eye patch, you may discover it\u2019s more\ndifficult to grab things on the first try.\n6677 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\n9.8 THE HOLE IN THE HAND ILLUSION\nFigure 9.6\nThis simple trick plays with your binocular vision to make it appear as if you have a hole\nin your hand.\nRoll a normal piece of 8\u00d711\u02dd paper into a tube and place it next to your hand as shown in\nthe above picture. With one eye look through the tube and with the other eye look ahead at\nthe back of your hand. With a little bit of shifting you should see what appears to be a large\nhole through your hand. Your mind takes the two distinct views to create one bizarre view.\n9.9 NIGHT VERSUS DAY VISION\nFigure 9.7 Albert Ryder\u2019s The Race Track, or Death on a Pale Horse\n68 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nDue to our optics, humans see better in daylight than dark. This is reflected in our perception\nand description of the world and in our art and language.\nThere almost always is light when it is pitch black to humans, but it is in wavelengths\nhuman eyes can\u2019t detect. Ultraviolet and infrared light are always present, but invisible to\nhumans. A human can get a suntan from ultraviolet light and feel the warmth associated\nwith infrared light, yet is unable to see either.\nThere are legitimate reasons for humans to naturally fear, or at least be wary, of the dark.\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. If we run in it, there\u2019s a good chance we could trip and\nfall. That\u2019s not superstitious, that\u2019s common sense.\nOther animals have night and day vision different from humans. Owls see better in night\nthan in day. It\u2019s not that objects such as picnic tables and fence posts physically vanish in\nthe dark of night. It\u2019s that humans are unable to see them. Owls see them fine. Geese see\nultraviolet light invisible to humans. Geese eyes see all the color we see, plus the color of\nultraviolet. Goldfish can see both ultraviolet and infrared light.\nDarkness is popularly associated with sinister, and light with goodness. Look at the common\ndark words and phrases:\nDark angel\nDark and mysterious\nShe has a black heart\nHe has a dark mind\nThe color black is worn as a statement by brooding teenagers.\nIn Western culture, white, yellow and other bright colors are associated with happiness and\ngoodness. Someone who is upbeat and smiley is said to be in a bright or sunny mood.\nHell is commonly pictured as shadowy and Heaven as sunny. Good angels are typically\ndescribed as wearing white. Virginal brides wear white. The Wicked Witch of the West\nwore black. The Good Witch of the East wore white.\nMonsters are commonly called creatures of the night, and genuine creatures of the night,\nlike bats and owls, have been called monsters and demons.\n69 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nVampires, as the stories go, rise at night from their coffins and die when exposed to daylight.\nThe cursed man becomes a werewolf at the full moon of the night.\n9.10 FINAL THOUGHTS ON HUMAN VISION\nAs I said, you don\u2019t see physical reality even in the physical world, but a translation of it.\nWhen you are look at a living room or bowl of apples or painting or mountain range, the\nimage you see is not a direct representation of the objects. The image is a translation made\nby your eyes and mind. As demonstrated, binocularism (changing two views into one),\nafterimages (images created by the eyes/mind), unnoticed blind spots, inability to see colors\nin low light and countless other purely physiological occurrences ensure that our mental\nimage is always different than the objects viewed. Everything we perceive involves illusion.\nA mirror mirrors what is in front of it. If you place an apple two feet in front of the mirror,\nan identical looking apple will look as if it is the same distance behind, or into, the mirror.\nCuriously, if you use triangulation to measure the distance to the apple in the mirror,\nthe apple will measure as being two feet behind the mirror. Both our eyes and scientific\nmeasurement say there is an apple two feet behind the mirror\u2019s surface.\n7700 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\nInfrared viewers, such as night vision goggles, do not allow humans to see infrared light,\nbut translate infrared light into visible light. We cannot see infrared light and can only\nguess how an infrared viewing animal perceives it.\nHave you ever noticed that when you\u2019re outside at night, you can see a star better when\nyou\u2019re not looking straight at it? The center of your retina does not have rods which are used\nto see at night. The rods are off center, so you see better at night off center. When looking\nat a faint star, try turning your head a bit as it may appear brighter out of your periphery.\nGiven humans\u2019 night vision it is not coincidence that humans perceive ghosts as things\nthat come out at night, are pale and colorless, ephemeral, fleeting, peripheral, dreamlike,\nshimmering, mysterious, otherworldly. Under the shroud of night a lawn chair can look\nlike a shadowy figure. A backpack left on a picnic table can resemble a strange animal. A\nrustling bush can startle the sheckles out of someone walking home alone. As there is a lack\nof visual information at night, humans use their imaginations to fill in the story.\nWhile humans depend mostly on sight, other animals depend more on other senses. The\nbloodhound has worse than human eyesight, but uses its advanced sense of smell to find\nlost people that even trained police detectives cannot find. In these instances, the blood\nhound\u2019s non-seeing perception is more accurate than all of the detectives\u2019 senses combined.\nThis explains why many police departments have bloodhounds on staff.\nOur perception and description of the universe is greatly influenced by our senses. Humans\ncategorize and label objects in part by visible colors. Many animals, flowers, gems and even\nhumans are defined by their visible colors.\nAs defined by the American Kennel Club, a cairn terrier can come in all colors except\nwhite. If a cairn terrier is born white, it\u2019s not a cairn terrier. It\u2019s a West Highland Terrier,\na different breed.\nIf we could see infrared and ultraviolet light our categorizations and objects, including\nterriers, would be different.\nConsidering, for example, we would have better depth perception and receive more information\nif we had more eyes, how would you design perfect eyesight? Realize that if we had one\nhundred eyes all over our body, we would still have limited perspective due to where we\nstand, our height, etc. What would be perfect eyesight? What about perfect perception? Our\nphysical perception would still be limited if it was just about eyesight. Remember smell,\nhearing and other senses. How would you design perfect perception? Are there senses we\ndon\u2019t use or know about? Also realize that such advanced perceptual systems would require\n71 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS vIsIon: whAt you see Is dIfferent thAn whAt you look At\na bigger, different brain to process and interpret the visual information, and the sensory\ninformation would still be interpreted and transformed by the brain.\nDo you think art is a way to make up for our limited senses? A great painting or movie\ndoesn\u2019t just show something, but implies and evokes. A great work of music is more than\njust physical notes.\nIi is fascinating how much human philosophy, religion and society are formed and influenced\nby human sensory abilities and disabilities.\nHow would art be different if humans had the sensory abilities of bats and owls?\n7722 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS summAry of InternAl methods to proCess InformAtIon\n10 SUMMARY OF INTERNAL\nMETHODS TO PROCESS\nINFORMATION\nFor many who have read the previous chapters, they will have a different view of how\nironclad are their perceptions. Even our physical vision involves illusion, distortion and\nblind spots. And realize that these chapters have shown just a few of many automatic and\nnonconscious methods used to process information. There are many that of which you are\nunaware and of which you will always be unaware.\nThese and other methods are used singly and in combinations to make educated guesses\nin the face of complex and ambiguous situations, and where speedy decisions are required.\nIn defense of humans vis a vis the errors shown in previous chapters, humans are amazingly\nadept at making good guesses. Yes, there is a margin of error and sometimes big mistakes\nare made, but on the whole humans are adept at doing such things as judging distance and\nsize, identifying objects in our daily lives, guessing how far away is that milk jug, how tall\nis that doorway, walking through a room without hitting a table or wall.\nHowever, when you get into realms of philosophy, theology and trying to understand and\nexplain the universe, these misperceptions, blind spots and inescapable illusions take on\nprofound significance.\nThese past chapters demonstrate that humans should double check their assumptions, try\nto identify and be aware their biases and blind spots.\nThe next two chapters offer more examples of making judgments and decisions in ambiguous\nsituations.\n73 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS summAry of InternAl methods to proCess InformAtIon\n10.1 QUESTIONS/STUDY TOPICS\n1) Look up online and define what are \u2018cognitive fallacies.\u2019 Give a few examples, and\nexplain how they work and what practical purposes they have and the errors.\n2) How do visual illusions work?

The viewer sees a limited amount of information from a scene and, using\nits experience, knowledge, biases, internal mental abilities and logic, makes a guess at what\nis going on. Often, this guess is correct, or at least a good approximation. Other times it\nis wrong.\nExcept for more extreme situations, such as very slow movement or very small objects, the\nhuman optical system is good at detecting the presence of movement. The misperceptions\nmost commonly happen in the interpretation of the movement. Humans can correctly detect\nthe presence of movement but misinterpret the direction, speed and even what is moving.\nA human can think object A is moving, when it is object B that is moving.\nThe following are two common examples of correctly detecting the presence of movement,\nbut misinterpreting it.\n75 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\nThe parked car prank\nA prank you have probably heard about is where two pranksters park their cars on each side\nof an open parking space. Sometime later the unsuspecting victim parks his car between these\ntwo cars. When the victim is fiddling with his keys or checking the contents of his wallet\nor looking in the glove compartment, the two pranksters suddenly drive forward in unison.\nThe victim gets the instant sensation that his car is moving backward and panics. He soon\nfigures out what is going on, but is embarrassed. This is an example where a person correctly\nidentifies movement, but misinterprets what is moving. Also, note that his misperception\nwas influenced by instinct, the victim having little control over the adrenaline rush.\nBaseball\u2019s changeup\nIn baseball, pitchers use the so-called changeup pitch to fool the batter. A changeup is intended\nto look like a fastball, but is slower. The changeup is typically thrown after a fastball, often\nafter consecutive fastballs. Then, seeing the normal fastball arm and body motion of the\npitcher, the batter believes the ball is again coming fast and swings accordingly. When the\nchange up works, the unexpected speed results in the hitter making feeble or no contact\nwith the ball.\nAs pitching great Warren Spahn said, \u201cHitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing.\u201d\n11.2 STROBOSCOPIC MOVEMENT ILLUSIONS\nWhen watching an old Western movie there is a curious effect that sometimes stands out.\nThe wheels of a moving wagon sometimes appear to be still, rotating slower than they should\nor even rotating backward. This happens when the rotation speed of the spokes was not in\nsynchronicity with the speed of the film.\nFigure 11.2\n76 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\nThe above three still images of a wagon wheel seem to show the wheel in the same position,\nbut they show the wheel at different rotations. The middle picture was rotated 90 degrees\nfrom the left image, and the right image is rotated an additional 90 degrees.\nThat each spoke is shaped and colored identical to the others is an essential contribution\nto the illusion. If these were the stills in a movie the rotating wheel would appear to be\nmotionless. If they were the stills in a movie, but the rotation was 80 degrees instead of\n90, the wheels would appear to be going backward.\nThe wagon wheel illusion in a movie is an example of the stroboscopic effect.\nIn the dark, a strobe gives off intermittent flashes of light. Under a strobe, the viewer views\na moving object through short intermittent snapshots instead of a continuous view. This\ncan lead to misperception of the object\u2019s movement, as the viewer nonconsciously imagines\nwhat is going on in between the flashes.\nSay you are watching a swinging pendulum under stroboscopic lighting. If the strobe flashes\na quick burst of light once every second and it takes the pendulum exactly one second to\nswing back and forth, the pendulum will appear to you to be motionless. Each flash catches\n7777 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\nthe pendulum in the same position, the pendulum having done quite a bit of moving in\nthe darkness between flashes. If the flashes catch the pendulum at its extreme right position,\nthe pendulum will appear to be being pulled, pushed or blown right.\nThe stroboscopic flashes create visual ambiguity. There are different possible explanations for\nwhat the viewer sees. The viewer typically, and often visually, chooses the explanation that\nmeets his expectations. If you and others saw no movement in a daylight object, it would be\nconsidered bizarre for you to proclaim that the object was swinging back and forth. However,\nthis bizarre proclamation would be correct with the apparently motionless pendulum.\nFigure 11.3 Do these snapshots show a moving or still pendulum?\nIt is impossible to tell.\n11.3 ALL MOVIES AS STROBOSCOPIC-LIKE ILLUSIONS\nDespite audience perception, movies don\u2019t show continuous, real movement of a deer running,\na car racing or people conversing. They show a series of snapshots of the movement. If\nyou hold up movie film, you will see it is a series of still images lined up side by side, not\nunlike the panels in a newspaper comic strip.\nWhen the film is shot and shown at the proper speed, the viewer\u2019s mind incorrectly interprets\nthe succession of still images as real movement. To the mind, \u2018realistic movement\u2019 seems\nthe most plausible explanation for what it is seeing. This choice is made instantly and\nnonconsciously and the viewer simply thinks she\u2019s watching real, continuous movement.\nWhen the film is too slow, the mind is no longer fooled. The running horse looks choppy\nand unreal.\n78 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\n11.4 AMBIGUITY\nAs mentioned earlier in this book, ambiguity is a concept essential to understanding humans,\nas humans constantly make choices in the face of ambiguous information. Ambiguity means\nthere is more than one possible explanation to something, and the viewer doesn\u2019t know,\noften can\u2019t know, which one is correct.\nIn the face of ambiguity, the mind will almost always pick the explanation that meets its\nexpectations and experience. Visual illusions, both moving and still, involve making the\nwrong pick.\nThe human mind is designed for speed. Speedy perceptions are essential for living and\nsurviving in the real world, including processing fast movement such as a charging lion and\nrolling boulder. A downside of the speed is there is a fair margin of error. Speed is often\nsynonymous with haste.\n11.5 AMBIGUOUS MOVEMENT: THE BARBER POLE ILLUSION\nThere are instances where, due to restricted viewpoint, it is impossible for the viewer to\nknow the direction of movement. A standard example involves the barber pole.\nFigure 11.4 A barber shop pole\nHung outside the barber shop, a barber pole has diagonal candy cane stripes that are\nrotated horizontally. However, looking from a particular angle it will appear as if the stripes\nare moving vertically. Faced with different plausible choices for what it is seeing (possibly\nmoving up, but also possibly moving sideways), the mind takes a pick, one that happens\nto be wrong.\n79 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\nIf you watch a barber pole from different angles, you will alternately perceive the stripes\nmoving vertically and rotating horizontally. Your mind can\u2019t make up its mind.\nAs the following pictures illustrate, even still images can trick the mind into perceiving\nmotion. Their designs match up with the nonconscious brain\u2019s template for what is movement.\nFigure 11.5\n8800 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS perCeptIon of movement\nFigure 11.6\nFigure 11.7\n81 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\n12 NARRATIVE AND THE\nPERCEPTION OF STILL\nINFORMATION\nThis chapter is another example of how humans use imagination, biases and guesses to process\nand judge ambiguous and abstract information. It shows how which, if any, narrative is the\n\u2018correct\u2019 one is impossible to know. It also begins to get into issues and dilemmas of language, in\nparticular how to symbolically represent complex things such as time and thinking.\n12.1 NARRATIVE OR STORYTELLING\nFigure 12.1 What is the story in this Jan Vermeer painting?\nFigure 12.2 What\u2019s the fox doing?\n82 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nFigure 12.3 What do you suppose was happening here?\nNarrative is an integral part of how humans perceive, identify and judge of information,\nboth moving and still, realistic and abstract.\n8833 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nA narrative is the conscious and nonconscious story we see and tell about our lives, attach\nto observed situations and still objects.\nNarrative includes perception of time, plot, order, causation, mood, action, point of view,\nemphasis (what is important, what is not), character motives, past and future. When we\nlook at a still photo or painting or a distant couple standing at a street light we perceive a\nstory in progress. We may not know the story, but we take for granted that there is one.\nA cup on a table isn\u2019t just there, there is a history of how it got there, where it will go\nnext. Presumably, a human walked up to the table and placed the cup there, perhaps drank\nfrom it. \u201cWho left this dirty cup on the table?!,\u201d someone may soon say. \u201cDirty dishes go\nin the dishwasher.\u201d\nWe know the earlier fox image was an observer\u2019s snapshot of a real living animal in mid\nmovement. A good guess is the fox is/was chasing prey. Did it catch anything? That\u2019s a\nquestion to ponder.\nIf you change the narrative to an image, you change the meaning of the image, at least the\nperceived meaning. This is why narrative issues are so important.\nA still image of a man with a knife is generally defined by the narrative \u2013 what he is perceived\nas going to do with the knife, what he is perceived as having done with the knife. If the\nnarrative is he just cleaned a fish and is taking the knife to the sink, the still image has\none meaning. If the narrative is he\u2019s looking to hide a murder weapon, the same still has a\ndistinctly different meaning. The accuracy of the narrative is no small issue.\nIt brings up the question of if a still image can be understood independent of narrative.\nThe two knife narratives were for the same image. Can the cup on the table\u2019s identity and\nmeaning be determined as it is? Is how it got there essential to its identity? Humans often\nlike to think they can judge things in a vacuum, without the relativism of past and present\nand nearby other objects, but is it possible?\nSome things are defined by their movement. A cheetah in the wild is defined and identified\nby how fast it runs. A sidewinder snake is identified because it moves sideways. When it\u2019s\njust laying there, most of us wouldn\u2019t know what kind of snake it is.\nMuch of our narrative is speculative. We can guess but don\u2019t know the whole story. The\njudgment of significance, motives and movements of the players in a scene is influenced by\nour biases and personal experiences. Different viewers see different stories in the same movie.\n84 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nConsciously and nonconsciously predicting what will happen is a necessary part of human\nfunction. To catch a ball, you not only need to know where the ball is at any given moment\nin flight, but correctly anticipate where it will be at later moments.\nNarrative is an expression of human\u2019s philosophy of time, cause-and-effect, relationships\nbetween things. To most humans, nothing is static, but a part of a linear flow. Even still\nthings and still images of things are viewed as part of this flow.\nWhat is particularly interesting is humans apply narratives to abstract images and other\ninformation where it is not clear there is a real narrative.\nFigure 12.4 Describe what going on above?\nEven though this is an abstract combination of dots and lines in Figure 12.4, most will\nsay this shows two balls racing towards each other. Viewers can even describe what they\nsee as happening before and after this image. However, unlike a movie still or snapshot\nphoto, there is no before or after. As I am the one who created this design, I can assure\nthat this is the only image, the one and only existence of these dots and lines. There is no\nnarrative with this image other than as speculated by the viewer. That it shows balls on a\nline is itself imagination.\nWhether there is a real narrative to the earlier Vermeer painting is debatable. It\u2019s not a\nphotographic snapshot of live movement, as with the fox. The narrative and resulting\nmeaning is nothing more than speculation.\nAs you can see, artistic experience is speculative, theoretical. Art is a symbol and metaphor\nfor something larger and something in the viewers\u2019 minds. Art isn\u2019t so much interpreted\nby the viewer as made up. Movement is imagined in the following Matisse, but it doesn\u2019t\nliterally exist. Even the artist having imagined movement doesn\u2019t make it exist.\n85 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nFigure 12.5 Matisse artwork\nA question to consider is is narrative the correct way to judge information? Is it always the\ncorrect way? And if it is correct to view information via narrative, is the human narrative the\ncorrect narrative? Does all human narrative, even as used by scientists, involve imagination\nand the associated biases and psychology? Of course, many of these questions we can\u2019t answer.\n8866 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nThe movement illusions in the earlier chapter Perception of Movement were all about false\nnarratives. The stroboscopic illusion involves the viewer creating a narrative about movement\nthat differs from reality. The perceiving of the barber pole stripes continually moving up\nis a false narrative.\nThe mentally ill often have abnormal narratives. They see and experience the same now and\npast and future that you and I see, but give the pieces a different causality and relationships,\nviewpoint, emphasis and soundtrack.\n12.2 ALEATORY NARRATIVE IN ART\n\u201cAny path is right, if \u2013 as according to Bach \u2013 it leads to the divine.\u201d\n\u2013 music historian Paul Epstein on J.S. Bach\u2019s fugues,\nto which Bach never gave a playing order\nArt, or how we express ideas via style and aesthetics, shows a lot about how we as a whole\nand individuals process information.\nAleatory art is art where the finished result is substantially out of the artist\u2019s hands. It can\ninvolve chance or the musicians\u2019 or audience\u2019s choice. Many games are aleatory. Monopoly\ninvolves the roll of the dice. Poker involves the shuffling of the cards. Aleatoricism in art\ncan create fresh, inventive, unexpected results. If the results defies the conventions of plot,\nnarrative and order, that is the point.\nJ.S. Bach\u2019s fugues are aleatory in that he never communicated which order the short musical\npieces should be played. They can be played or listened to in any order, take your pick,\nrandomly program the CD player. In the above quote, Epstein is saying an overall sublime\naesthetic result justifies whichever fugue order lead to it. It\u2019s reminiscent of the Hindu\nsaying, \u201cAny path that leads to God is correct.\u201d\nNovelist William S. Burroughs used the so-called cut-up aleatory technique. Pages of text\nwere physically cut up and randomly pieced back together, sometimes with text by other\nauthors, creating new and often profoundly surreal meaning and narrative. Burroughs believed\nthis type of collage more closely represented the human experience. Despite the conceit of\nlinearity, humans don\u2019t think or experience things linearly, one\u2019s thoughts constantly flipping\nback and forth between past, current and future. Random little events and objects trigger\nmemories and provoke speculation of the future. When you consider buying a can of beans\n87 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\nin the grocery aisle, you think about past meals and the future meal where these beans might\nbe used. The human ability to identify flowers, shoe brands and people involves comparing\nthe present to memory. Human intelligence and reasoning involves mentally flipping back\nand forth through time.\nBroken Glass is the name of an aleatory computer storytelling technique that intentionally\nscrambles the traditional linear narrative. It is a computer web page made up of a plethora\nof small assorted images, often resembling a stained glass window. Each image is linked to\na small piece of the story \u2013 a plot, a description, a picture, characterization, whatever. The\nstory\u2019s order is determined by the reader blindly clicking on the images.\nThe facts, scenes, characters, events and days of the week are always constant in Broken\nGlass, but the aleatory order in which the pieces are read affects the complexion, aesthetics,\npsychology and meaning. As any great novelist or film director will tell you, how facts\nare revealed can be as important as the facts themselves. A story told straightforward is\nmarkedly different than the same story told in flashbacks. Knowing what will happen to\na character, what she will do and how she will change, affects how you view her in the\npresent. Knowing versus not knowing how the romance will end (or will it end?) affects\nhow the movie goers view the lovers when they first meet, interact. Jumbled up order in\nand of itself has psychological meaning and symbolism.\nEven with a physically bound paper book, the reader chooses the order in which the book\nis read. Whether or not they realize it, readers are as responsible for the order as the author,\nthough the author usually gets the blame.\nWilliam S. Burroughs said the chapters of his novel Naked Lunch could be read in any\norder. That a reader read them 1, 2, 3 had nothing to do with him\nDictionaries and encyclopedias are aleatory. Excluding the editors and writers, it\u2019s possible if\nnot likely that no two people have read the word definitions in a dictionary in the same order.\nWilliam S. Burroughs felt that the cutting up and shuffling together of different texts,\nincluded by different authors, revealed hidden information.\nThis is all getting into the nature of language, and the problems and dilemmas of translating,\nor trying to translate, things beyond language into symbolic language, and trying to translate\nthe intangible into the tangible. Language is covered in more detail in later.\n88 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS nArrAtIve And the perCeptIon of stIll InformAtIon\n12.3 ASSIGNMENT\nLook up online storytelling and psychology and give some of your findings and ideas from various\narticles and pages. Answer the question \u2018How is storytelling important to human learning?\u2019\n8899 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AttentIon\n13 ATTENTION\nThis chapter shows how, due to the limited capacity, the mind must focus on some information and\nignore other in order to function, and that this attention distorts our perception.\n13.1 ATTENTION IN PERCEPTION\nA human does not and cannot simultaneously focus on all information in a scene. Humans\ndo not have the mental capacity. Humans focus on some things and ignore others. This is\na normal part of human thought and function.\nWhen you enter a room, your eyes are drawn to something or things. Perhaps you focus on\nthe gracious hosts, perhaps a statue to the side. If there is a rat in the middle of the floor,\nyour immediate perception will be of the rat and not of the rose wallpaper.\nIf you enter the room and there is an attractive nude, you likely won\u2019t notice what is on the\ncoffee table. You might not even notice the coffee table. After blushingly excusing yourself\nand scooting out of the room, you may not recall the existence of a coffee table, but it was\nthere right in front of your eyes.\nThis focus, and the resulting perception, is your creation. How and what humans focus on\n(and ignore) is an essential part of human function and their perception.\nFigure 13.1 Does this trident have three prongs or two?\n90 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AttentIon\nWith the impossible trident visual illusion in Figure 13.1, the viewer forms a perception\nabout the whole from looking at just one end.\nWhen she looks at the other end, she realizes her extrapolation was wrong. Unlike some\nvisual information where part of the graphic is blocked and left to the imagination, there\nis no missing information here. All of the information is there for the eyes to see, but\nthe viewer forms her initial perception as if information is hidden. She mentally hides, or\nignores, the information herself.\nThis shows that how our attention involves ignoring, or the impossibility to focus on all\nthe information simultaneously, and how the focusing and ignoring affects our perception.\nOur attention is biased and arbitrary, and so is our perception. Your initial perception of\nthe above is based on whether you naturally, or by learning, read or view pictures left to\nright or right to left.\nThe viewer\u2019s purpose shapes perception. A person going to look at the art will have a different\nperception of the museum than someone merely stopping by to use the bathroom. A kid\nvisiting to do a report on sculpture will have a different perception of the art than a kid\ndoing a report on paintings. If they visit different areas of the museum and enter different\ndoors, they may have different ideas about the building\u2019s architecture.\nThe purpose is formed before the scene is viewed, meaning a perception is partially\npredetermined.\nHuman attention is both learned and inborn, conscious and subconscious. Something\nstrange and new catches our attention. Our attention naturally focuses on loud, sudden,\nunexpected noises, such as thunder or a car horn. It is an inborn part of the ability to\nsurvive and function. Due to its unusualness, an albino squirrel captures viewers\u2019 attention.\nStudies by scientists have shown that focusing and attention happen at the neurological level.\nOur brain both opens and focuses pathways needed to focus on and ignore information.\n13.2 QUESTIONS\n1) How does culture and education affect perception?\n2) How is biased attention detrimental? How is it helpful?\n91 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\n14 HUMANS USE FALSE\nINFORMATION AND MADE\nUP BELIEFS TO FUNCTION\nAND ACHIEVE\nThis chapter shows how humans create attention to function by using false and deceptive beliefs\nand ideas.\n14.1 INTRODUCTION\nHumans use arbitrary rules, false information, biases and imaginary environments to reach\nhigher levels of achievement. This achievement can range from a musician composing a\ngreat symphony to a ten year old improving her math scores.\n9922 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\nHumans do not have the mental capacity to effectively focus on a variety of tasks simultaneously.\nTo reach higher levels of achievement in an area, the human must put most to all of its\nfocus on that area. Humans must eliminate or stabilize (make a non-factor) areas that\ndistract from the needed focus.\nThis is comparable to a water kettle with four equal sized holes in the top. When water is\nboiled inside, steam will raise a height from the holes. If three of the holes are sealed, the\nsteam will rise much higher from the remaining hole.\nThe following are everyday examples of manipulating one\u2019s mental and physical environment\nto produce achievement:\n\u2022 While background music or others\u2019 chitchat may be fine while browsing a glossy\nmagazine, many of us cover our ears in order to comprehend a difficult passage or\nperform a math problem.\n\u2022 To expand one\u2019s mind by meditation one focuses on a repeated mundane and often\narbitrary task, such as following one\u2019s breath or repeating a word.\n\u2022 To improve the team\u2019s horrid free throw percentage, the junior high basketball\ncoach teaches the players to focus on the basket and their shooting motion and\nto ignore the crowd. He has them practice by ignoring recorded crowd noise and\ncardboard cutouts of fans.\n\u2022 Many with a fear of speaking reduce their nervousness by imagining the audience\nwearing only their underwear. They create a fantasy.\n14.2 THE RITUALS OF BASEBALL\nFigure 14.1 Ty Cobb in 1908\n93 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\nMany consider hitting a baseball to be the most difficult feat in sport. The batter swings\na stick to hit a small ball. The thrown ball can reach speeds of over 100 miles per hour.\nEarly 1900s player Ty Cobb holds the record for the highest career batting average in Major\nLeague Baseball history. His batting average was 0.367, or 3.67 hits per every 10 turns at bat.\nEven the greatest hitters fail more than they succeeded. Enough to give anyone a complex.\nBaseball hitters, and baseball players in general, are notorious for their strange rules and\nrituals. Players often wear the same unwashed undershirt and socks during a hitting streak.\nMost players don\u2019t step on the white foul lines when entering and leaving the field. Pitcher\nTurk Wendell waved to left field every time he entered and left a game. When coming to bat,\nNomar Garciaparra went through a well documented ritual of pulling at his shirt, opening\nand closing the Velcro straps on his batting gloves and tapping the toes of his shoes. Lucky\ncharms, bracelets, necklaces, gum brands abound the game. Five-time batting champion\nWade Boggs ate chicken before every game. U.L. Washington batted with a toothpick in\nhis mouth. After parents complained that kids might emulate the unsafe habit, he switched\nto a q-tip. After the first slump, U.L. was back to the toothpick.\nThough many of the rituals are comical, they can aid performance. Hitting requires a calm\nand focused mind and exceptional mind body coordination, all while the player is surrounded\nby television cameras, screaming fans and the other pressures of being a professional athlete\nexpected to perform. If wearing the lucky undershirt or repeating an odd ritual eases the\nbatter\u2019s mind and gives confidence, it can increase the player\u2019s batting average. U.L.\u2019s reason\nfor switching back to a toothpick was because it made him feel more comfortable. While\na toothpick as aid may seem nonsensical, the desire to be comfortable makes sense.\n14.3 FAITH\nFor a rule or belief to aid performance, the person must have faith in the rule or belief.\nDuring a meditation session, one must accept that the thing of mental focus is worthy\n(breath, mantra, stone, other). Whether the thing was carefully chosen by an instructor or\npicked in a rush (a pebble hastily grabbed from the ground), meditation requires you to\nfocus on that thing. If you fret about whether or not the mantra was the perfect pick, this\nvery fretting makes the meditation session less effective.\nThe lucky blue undershirt only helps the baseball player if he believes it lucky. If the blue\nundershirt is deemed lucky because he had a great game the first time he wore it, this\nillustrates the arbitrariness in his belief. If before that big game he pulled his grey undershirt\nfrom the drawer, it likely would be the grey undershirt that is considered lucky.\n94 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\n14.4 POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT IS REGULARLY\nBASED ON FALSE BELIEFS\nThere are regular cases where positive achievement is achieved from a false belief. This\nincludes in your daily life. Believing the false, if only temporarily, is a technique we all use\nto remove distracting thoughts. The following are two examples.\n\u2022 A placebo helps when the patient falsely believes it is medicine. When the patient\nknows what it is, a placebo often won\u2019t help.\n\u2022 A freshman at the University of Georgia, Jessica is entering final exam week before\nwinter break. Unknown to her, her beloved 14 year old cat Tiger just died back\nhome in Savannah. The night before her first test she has her weekly telephone\nconversation with her parents back home. Jessica asks how Tiger is doing. Her\nmother says Tiger is doing just fine, adding that the cat is playing with a toy on\nthe couch. After hanging up, Jessica\u2019s mother feels bad about lying, but thinks it\nwas best considering the exams. After a productive week, Jessica takes a bus home\nto Savannah where her parents break the bad news and explain why they delayed\nit. Jessica understands, agreeing that the news would have distracted her from\nher studies.\n9955 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\nIn both these cases it was a false belief that lead to the desired achievement. In both cases,\nknowledge of the truth may have hindered the achievement.\nThis shows that positive achievement arising from a belief is not proof that the belief is correct.\nBut, also ironically, that falsehood and arbitrary rules are needed for higher achievement.\nPatients who get better after taking a placebo often swear the pills had to be medicine. To\nthem, getting better is the proof. Even when the doctor informs them it was a placebo,\nsome patients continue to believe it was medicine because they got better.\nA sincere faith involves a psychological, often irrational attachment to the ideas. This\npsychological aspect is both what helps the placebo-taking patient get better (Most doctors\nbelieve positive \u2018I am getting better\u2019 thinking aids recovery), and what prevents him from\naccepting his belief as false even when confronted with the facts. This psychological attachment\nhas both a positive and a negative result.\nThis points to the fascinating relationship humans have with facts. A human cannot function\nas it desires without the distortion and suppression of facts.\nEven a search for the truth requires false beliefs to focus mental attention. In other words,\na search for the truth requires lies.\n14.5 OLYMPIC PSYCHOLOGY\nFor world class Olympic athletes a common rule is that one must believe one is going to\nwin in order to win. Paraphrasing a top speed skater interviewed the day before an Olympic\nrace, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just think you will win, you must know you will win.\u201d In a track,\nswim or bike race, the difference between first and fourth may be a fraction of a second,\nand the winning psychology can mean the difference between a win and loss. Of course\nmost of these athletes who are sure they will win will not win, and those who win do not\nwin every time. Even when the belief turns out to be wrong, it may better the athlete from,\nsay, fifth to third or third to second.\nWhether the idolized is a sports coach, historical leader or artist, most worshipers of a\nhuman being worship an unreal representation. Much of the misrepresentation is intentional,\nfollowers embellishing good qualities and glossing over bad.\n96 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\nAt first it seems strange that groups intentionally misrepresent the person they supposedly\nidolize. However, the representations aren\u2019t about complete factual accuracy. Amongst other\nthings, they are concerned with gaining and maintaining members\u2019 loyalty and spirit, group\nself importance, gaining power versus other groups and perhaps giving a representation\nto whom members can better relate and understand. The word idolizes implies the act of\nchanging, changing something into an idol.\nIt should not surprise that during a political election supporters put their candidate in the\nbest light and their competitor in the worst. Their representation isn\u2019t about truth, it\u2019s about\nwinning the election. If you ask either campaign manager why he doesn\u2019t include bad facts\nabout his candidate in the campaign literature, he\u2019ll look at you as if you are crazy\n14.6 DEPICTING JESUS CHRIST IN ART\nFigure 14.2 Different racial depictions of Jesus Christ\n97 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS USE FALSE INFORMATION AND MADE UP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS BELIEFS TO FUNCTION AND ACHIEVE\nBeyond the West\u2019s blue eyed dishwater blonde version, it has long been common for Jesus\nChrist to be depicted in art as looking like the local people. The old Ethiopian art at the\nbottom shows him as black. The Chinese painting on the right shows him as Asian in\nAsian dress. Of course, the real Jesus probably looked like none of these three depictions.\nWhile these depictions are literally false, there are cognitive psychology and other reasons\nto do this. Can you name some?\n9988 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the unIque subjeCtIve experIenCe\n15 THE UNIQUE SUBJECTIVE\nEXPERIENCE\nThis chapter shows all human perception involves subjectivity, including at the personal,human\nspecies and cultural levels.\n15.1 SUBJECTIVITY\nSubjectivity is a constant and integral part of the human experience. Love, lust, like, dislike,\ntaste, smell, views about beauty and ugliness and art. How you view this paragraph and\nthis book involves subjectivity \u2013 your taste about the writing style, word choice, chapter\nsubjects and length, book cover.\nBy definition, a subjective experience is a product of the individual\u2019s mind. While real and\noften profound, the subjective experience cannot be objectively measured by others. When\nsomeone is listening to music, the music\u2019s note, pitch, speed, volume and the listener\u2019s ear\nvibration and heartbeat can be measured by scientific instruments, but the listener\u2019s aesthetic\nexperience cannot. This experience is experienced by the listener alone. Even if asked to, the\nlistener could not fully translate the experience to others, in part because it is beyond words.\nIt\u2019s doubtful that two people have the same subjective perceptions. People may have similar,\nbut not identical perceptions. People regularly like the same song but perceive it differently.\nIt is common for best friends to like a movie, but one likes it more than the other or for\ndifferent reasons.\nA large range of things determines a person\u2019s subjective perception and experience. This\nincludes genes, education, culture, where and when born, personal experiences, upbringing,\ntravel, family makeup and personalities, friends, acquaintances, natural temperament, mental\nabilities, physiological abilities (quality of eyesight, hearing, smell), talents, language, health,\nhobbies and work. Your perception is subjective to your viewing position and your sensory\nabilities. We never see the entirety of a scene, or even an object, so what part you are\nlooking influences your perception.\nLittle things influence, such as what toy one had as a six year old and what tea grandmother\ndrank. While walking in a foreign land, the scent of jasmine tea can bring back a rush of\nmemories. The appearance of the toy in a movie will alter one\u2019s emotional reaction and\ninterpretation of the movie. It may have been chance that the movie viewer\u2019s parents bought\nthat toy, making his movie interpretation a result of chance.\n99 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the unIque subjeCtIve experIenCe\nIt is not just the tea and a toy, but millions of little things that influence, including from\nforgotten events.\nIf a bird watcher and a rock collector go for a walk together in the park they may have\nequally grand times, one due to the birds in the trees and the other due to the rocks on\nthe ground. Though they were side by side, they will give decidedly different descriptions\nof the walk.\nDo you dislike a name simply because it was the name of someone you couldn\u2019t stand?\nEven when they experience similar feelings people will usually have these feelings under\ndifferent circumstances, if only slightly different. People will be artistically excited, but\nfor different works of art or when interpreting differently the same work of art. People\nhave similar feelings of romantic love, but for distinctly different people \u2013 different looks,\npersonality, culture, interests, sex, race. The emotional states may be alike, but the objects\nof desire are not.\nYou cannot separate your biases from your perception, because it is those biases that help\ncreate the perception. Without those biases, you would have a different perception. Even\nthat childhood toy affected the movie goer\u2019s perception thirty years later.\nHumans believe they receive important objective insights, including cosmic truths, through\nstrong subjective experiences \u2013 such as through the sublime experience of art, epiphany of\nmusic, nature, love, lust, religious experience. The psychological power of these experiences\nis considered verification of the \u2018truths.\u2019\nA question is whether these experiences involve genuine insight into external reality or are\nmerely strong biological reactions. Love and lust themselves, after all, are standard innate\nreactions. Psychological reactions to certain sounds, such as in powerful music, involve genetics.\nThe reactions to high delicate notes (such as from songbirds or a pop song) and low booming\nnotes (distant thunder, the start of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony) have been shared by humans\nfor thousands and thousands of years. You and your ancient ancestor have remarkably similar\npsychological reactions to the sound of a songbird and the sudden deep roar of a bear. It is\nno coincidence that church music uses delicate high notes to evoke heaven in the audience,\nand the loud, deep bass of the organ to evoke power and awe.\n100 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the unIque subjeCtIve experIenCe\nIt is not coincidence that horror movies use discordant notes. The director knows audiences\nfind the sounds scary and creepy. In the famous 1960 Psycho shower scene, the sharp, grating,\ndiscordant musical notes evoke violence, evil, something gone horribly wrong. They sound\nsimilar to someone scratching a chalkboard, one of the most despised sounds to humans.\nIt can never be known to the experiencer that an epiphany made through a strong psychological\nexperience is anything more than a innate reaction. If there is insight into the external, the\ninsight is shaped by the experiencer\u2019s subjectivity, and what parts of the insight are objective\nand what parts subjective is unknowable.\nEven if important insights into the universe are gained they still are in subjective format.\nFor example, if your epiphany comes through your experience of art, your experience of art\nis personal and different than that of others. Not only is your \u2018insight\u2019 intrinsically tied to\nyour subjective views, you likely would not have had the insight at that same time, place\nor format, or at all, if you had different aesthetic views.\n110011 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the unIque subjeCtIve experIenCe\nHumans use aesthetic rules for defining truths, including what is good and evil, what is\nmoral and immoral. Common rules include conditions of beauty, symmetry, color, tone\n(light versus dark), fashion and order.\nEven if the rules were valid (which, of course, itself is a big if), it would mean truth is\nsubjective. If truth is beautiful, your definition of what is beautiful differs from others\u2019\ndefinitions. Further, an individual\u2019s perception of beauty changes with time and experience.\nA culture\u2019s perception of beauty changes with time. Compare the depictions of the desirable\nfeminine body from 1450, 1850, 1950 and this year.\nCultural definitions of \u2018objective truth\u2019 are formed by cultural sensibilities, including fashion,\npolitics, gender, race, beauty, geography, self interest, desire for social order, etc. There is\nno indication these are identifiers of objective truth, or are even related, but they are still\nused as criterion.\n15.2 SIMPLICITY\nTo humans, simplicity is that which is simple to them. Simple matches one\u2019s sensibilities,\nknowledge, intuition and expectations. If it didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be simple. What may be\nsimple to one human may not be to another. What may be simple to humans may be\nsimple only to humans.\nSimplicity has long been used by humans to define supposedly absolute things such as\ncosmic truth, goodness, beauty, logic and purity. There are a number of problems with this.\nOne is there is no proof that cosmic truths, for example, are simple. Another problem is\nsimplicity, and thus what is defined as cosmic truth, is in the eye of the beholder.\nNormal, even nonconscious thinking involves simplification, translating complex information\ninto something understandable. Conceits are simplifications.\nYour visual perception involves simplification \u2013 interpreting a complex scene, grouping and\nlabeling the objects according to your experience, focusing on what you seem to recognize and\nignoring what you don\u2019t. Visual illusions and mirages shown throughout this book involve\nsimplification. The scene or graphic is translated by the viewer into something understandable,\nan understandable translation that happens to be wrong. This alone proves that simplicity\nis not proof of truth, and that truth isn\u2019t always simple. Lies are often simpler than truths.\nSimplicity, of course, has many practical uses. Scientists strive for simplicity in theories and\ntesting. A scientific theory that is needlessly complicated will needlessly confuse students\n102 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS the unIque subjeCtIve experIenCe\nand seasoned scientists alike. Needlessly muddled theories are harder to test, study, correct\nand understand. In our daily life, good verbal communication requires simplicity, including\nusing words, phrases and language the listener understands. If a traveler speaks only English,\nit does them no good for you to give road directions in Spanish. Road directions in Spanish\nmay be simple to a Spanish speaker, but it\u2019s complicated to someone who doesn\u2019t know\nthe language.\n15.3 QUESTION\n1) How are subjective tastes and viewpoints useful to humans? Give some examples.\n110033 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AutomAtIC perCeptIons And unCorreCtAble IllusIons\n16 AUTOMATIC PERCEPTIONS AND\nUNCORRECTABLE ILLUSIONS\nThis chapter shows how many of perceptions are automatic and uncorrectable.\n16.1 AUTOMATIC PERCEPTIONS\nAs already mentioned, many human reactions, judgments and perceptions are automatic\nand subconscious. Many perceptions are made in an instant.\nIn an instant can mean the instant eyes are laid upon a scene. It also sometimes means the\nperception suddenly flashes in the mind after looking at the scene for a while. An example\nof the latter is when you stare at a Magic Eye picture before the hidden image is suddenly\nrevealed. Another is when you are looking at a crowd of faces and all of sudden recognize\na friend.\nThese instant perceptions often come from the nonconscious. That they arise instantly and\nfrom within, like epiphanies, make them powerful, even when wrong. To true believers,\nthey didn\u2019t arbitrarily pick out the Face on Mars, they recognized it as one recognizes a\nrelative in a crowd.\n16.2 UNCORRECTABLE ILLUSIONS\nEven after you learn how they work, there are many visual illusions that still fool you. If\nyou go back and look again at the visual illusions shown throughout this book, many will\nstill fool your eyes. You have already learned that the middle bar in the following picture\nis solid, yet it still looks to change. If you look at the picture tomorrow or two months\nfrom now, the bar will still appear to change in tone.\n104 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS AutomAtIC perCeptIons And unCorreCtAble IllusIons\nFigure 16.1\nThe mind contains compartments that perform specific tasks. For example, one compartment\nis used for comprehending spoken language, another for perceiving smell. Some of these\ncompartments are isolated from other parts of the brain. They work on their own, not\ninfluenced by goings on elsewhere. These compartments sometimes are even isolated from\nconscious knowledge.\nThe perception of many visual illusions is made independent of your conscious knowledge.\nThis explains why even your conscious knowledge that they are illusions does not solve your\nnonconscious misperception.\nVisual illusions point out the existence of blind spots and unreliability in our logic and\nreasoning systems. For those who have never before seen Figure 16.1, the rational answer\nwould be the bar changes in tone. To say it is solid in tone would be irrational. It\u2019s not\nthat all false perceptions of reality are due to faulty logic, but that many are formed using\nwhat is considered sound logic and reasoning.\n16.3 QUESTION\nHumans always have unconscious biases and misperceptions. What can one do to address\nthis, balance and lessen them?\nWhile they involve biases and errors, why are immediate subconscious perceptions important?\n105 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And Its lImItAtIons: IntroduCtIon\n17 LANGUAGE AND ITS\nLIMITATIONS: INTRODUCTION\nA major part of human thought, function and success as a species is language, modeling\nand communication. Unlike other animals, humans can document information and ideas\nthrough symbols and these symbols can be used to communicate information between people,\ngroups and even time periods. We can read someone\u2019s cooking recipe, read about the past\nand what past people thought. We mark numbers with symbols and use these symbols to\nmake advanced calculations.\nHowever, as with all things human, a language and its reading are full of conceits,\noversimplifications and generalizations, irrationality, arbitrariness, biases, subjectivity,\nimagination, illusions and psychology. As with the internal methods used to make perceptions,\nlanguage has both practical use and limitations.\nLanguage is a complex and huge area that has been the subject of many books and continual\nstudy. The following several chapters are examples looking at language, demonstrating the\nlimitations, subjectivity and problems.\n110066 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS exAmples of AmbIguIty, ArbItrArIness And lImIts In lAnguAge\n18 EXAMPLES OF AMBIGUITY,\nARBITRARINESS AND\nLIMITS IN LANGUAGE\nThis chapter show how normal human spoken and written symbolic language is limited in part\nby ambiguity and arbitrariness.\nOur daily language is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Words have\nmultiple meanings, definitions change and multiply over time, phrases are interpreted\ndifferently by different people and differently by the same person in different situations. Voice\nintonation, pacing, grammar and facial expressions communicate meaning. The audience\nuses its experience, education and culture to guess what is meant. Words are just symbols\nand require reader imagination and interpretation to impart meaning.\nJohn and I went to the food court. We ate at Taste of India.\nThe above everyday sentences seem straightforward but can be interpreted in many ways.\nThe \u2018we\u2019 of the second sentence commonly is read to mean John and \u2018I,\u2019 but this reading is a\nguess. It could mean the narrator and someone else than John, or perhaps the narrator, John\nand someone else or multiple people. It\u2019s very plausible the two caught up with someone\nelse on the way to the Taste of India.\nMost read the second sentence to mean that Taste of India is at the food court and they\nate there soon after they arrived at the food court. However, this is also assumption. There\u2019s\nnothing in the sentence that says the Taste of India is not far away from the food court\nand their eating didn\u2019t take place days if not months later.\nIt is even an assumption that the two sentences relate to each other. They could just happen\nto be sitting next to each other, like strangers on a bench. For all you know, I lifted them\nfrom different books, published 15 years apart.\nEven when in Kyoto how I long for Kyoto when the cuckoo sings\nIn the above you can\u2019t go home again line by the famous 1600s Japanese poet Matsuo\nBasho, the word Kyoto has different meanings. The first Kyoto indicates the physical city\nand the second refers to a past life in the city, perhaps a childhood. Or at least that\u2019s how\nreaders commonly interpret it. Basho died over 300 years ago and no one today knows\nwhat he meant.\n107 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS exAmples of AmbIguIty, ArbItrArIness And lImIts In lAnguAge\nPhilosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that there is no set, absolute meaning for words and\nlanguage, but the meaning is defined by the usage. This is demonstrated in humor, sarcasm\n(where the meaning is the opposite of what is literally said), how words and phrases have\ndifferent meaning or significance in different contexts and places.\nComedy regularly plays on the ambiguity of language:\nLt. Frank Drebin: \u201cMiss, I\u2019m Lieutenant Frank Drebin, and this is Captain Ed Hocken,\nPolice Squad.\u201d\nBuxom Female Shop Assistant: \u201cIs this some kind of bust?\u201d\nLt. Frank Drebin: \u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s very impressive, yes, but we need to ask you a few questions.\u201d\n\u2013 Naked Gun 2-1/2 (1991, Paramount Pictures)\nThe Impossibleness in Translating Poetry\nBeyond the changed words, the foreign language translation of a poem alters and often\ndestroys the original poem. With rare exception the translation of a beautiful poem can be\nsimilarly beautiful or literally faithful, but not both.\nPoetry is uniquely tied to the native language \u2013 the unique word definition, culture, diction,\nrhyme, sound, meter, feel and even physical length of words and phrases. Due to the literal\nand figurative differences between languages, a foreign language translation of a poem not\nonly changes the literal words but the poem. It is not possible to change the language and\nperfectly preserve the original meaning.\nThis is elementally illustrated by the translation of simple rhyming poems. While \u2018dog\u2019 and\n\u2018fog\u2019 rhyme, the standard Spanish translations of \u2018perro\u2019 and \u2018neblina\u2019 do not. To make the\ntranslation rhyme, the translator must take liberties with the literal meaning. To keep intact\nthe literal meaning, she must omit the rhyming.\nIn order to preserve artistic meaning, many translators consciously dismiss literal translation. The\ntranslation is often as much the artistic creation of the translator as it is of the original poet.\nThe reader of a translation is not reading the original poem. The translation may be closely\nrelated and beautiful and profound, but it\u2019s something different. This illustrates the problem\nwith those who take literally modern translations of ancient text.\n108 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION, GROUPING AND\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PRIORITIZING OF INFORMATION\n19 S UBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION,\nGROUPING AND PRIORITIZING\nOF INFORMATION\nThis chapter demonstrates how human language, labelling and conception involves subjective\nand arbitrariness in how things are labelled, categorized and defined.\n19.1 OVERVIEW\nWhen a human being visually perceives, she mentally organizes, sorts, groups, prioritizes\nand labels the things in the scene. When you look at an ink sketch, you mentally assemble\nthe ink lines, squiggles and dots into a form. \u201cIt\u2019s a kitty cat.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a cottage in the woods.\u201d\nYou decide which ink marks belong together and how, and which do not. Two people can\nand do group the ink markings differently.\n110099 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION, GROUPING AND\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PRIORITIZING OF INFORMATION\nA Rorschach inkblot is perceived differently by different people. The ink blot remains the\nsame. The viewer changes. Rorschach ink blots are used by psychiatrists and psychologists\nto learn about an individual\u2019s mind.\nThe human is never just an observer of a scene, but an active participant in creating his\nor her perception. The viewer picks out what information is deemed important and what\nis not. When someone labels a photo as \u201ca group of kittens,\u201d the label has grouped kittens\ntogether and disregarded other visible information (background pillow, wall, grass, toy). The\npicking out of kittens alone as the label shows us the viewer\u2019s priorities.\nLanguage is a common way to organize, label and perceive objects and ideas. Native\nlanguage is something we learned as infants, talk, think and even dream in. Our native\nlanguage has profound influence on how we look at the world. Different languages give\ndifferent emphasis, meaning, aesthetics, sounds and, perhaps most important, categories to\nthings. As one perceives and thinks in part through categorizing (cats belong as one group,\ndogs belong as one group, magazines as another), native linguistic categories influence even\nnonconscious perception. It influences how we imagine things when our eyes are closed.\nAn elemental example of difference between languages is when a person in Atlanta Georgia\nand a person in Rome Italy read the same word \u2018pizza,\u2019 yet imagine different things. A\npizza in Georgia is different than a pizza in Italy. If you asked the two to identify a pizza\nat a market, they might point to different objects. The Italian may say of the Georgian\u2019s\nchoice, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. That\u2019s not pizza. Let me read the label\u2026Tombstone\u2026Do not defrost\nbefore cooking\u2026remove cellophane\u2026Glenview Illinois\u2026You Americans might know Slim\nWhitman and Gilligan\u2019s Island, but you know nothing about pizza. Come to Rome and\nI\u2019ll show you pizza.\u201d\nMany differences are more subtle. For example, different cultures do not always categorize\ncolor alike. Different languages can and do have a different number of names for colors. This\nmeans a particular name, say red or green, will apply to a different range of wavelength on\nthe visible light spectrum. It\u2019s the same total light spectrum of color for both cultures, but\nthe different numbers of names divide the spectrum into different size pieces. Like cutting\ntwo identical pizzas, one into nine pieces and the other into seven. The pizzas are identical\nexcept one has fewer and bigger pieces. In one culture, \u2018red\u2019 can cover a different range of\ncolor than the equivalent word \u2018red\u2019 in another culture. What you call red, a person on\nanother continent may or may not call red.\nEven within a culture, people often categorize colors differently. This is commonly done in\nthe marginal areas, such as aqua blue, dark orange versus red, magenta versus pink. It is\nprobable that you perceive some borderline colors differently than your spouse, friend or\n110 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION, GROUPING AND\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PRIORITIZING OF INFORMATION\nco-workers. If two friends define colors differently, they may believe they are talking about\ndifferent cloth swatches when they are talking about the same one. Or they may believe\nthey are talking about the same swatch when they are talking about different.\nThis between friends difference can be because they don\u2019t have the exact same color vision\nand that they never had a serious discussion about what are the boundaries of aqua blue, or\nwhat constitutes badious, brunneous and gamboges. I don\u2019t recall ever having an instructor\nteach the exact boundaries of aqua blue, aquamarine or magenta, not even in art class. I\ndoubt I ever had an instructor who knew the exact boundaries.\nAs humans commonly communicate, learn and conceptualize the abstract through words,\ndifferent interpretations of words often lead to conflicts. What may at first appear to be a\nvisual illusion or even mental illness in a person may be a difference in culture.\nAn American joke is \u201cNever ask for Squirt on an English airline.\u201d To Americans, Squirt is\na brand of lemon/lime soda pop. To the English the word means urine.\nI think it\u2019s safe to order 7Up.\n19.2 SO, IF A TREE FALLS WHEN NO ONE IS AROUND\nDOES IT MAKE A SOUND OR DOESN\u2019T IT?\nMany arguments are not caused by disagreement over the main ideas, but that the arguers\nunknowingly define terms differently. Arguers may have different definitions of war, peace,\nwork week, formal attire, animal, automobile, tall, stiff drink and sexy, even though they\nboth assume they are using identical definitions. Once the parties mutually set the definitions\n(which they didn\u2019t do in the beginning), they are often surprised to discover how much they\nagree with each other. Many arguments, many conundrums, many philosophical debates\nexist simply because parties never thought to mutually define terms.\nAn age old question is \u201cIf a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear, does it\nmake a sound?\u201d\nThe answer to this question depends on what is the definition of sound, and a key to the\ndiscussion is the determination of what sound means.\nIs sound defined by the act of a human or other animal hearing? Or can a sound exist with\nnone around to hear it? It would seem the smart thing to start by looking up the word\nsound in a dictionary.\n111 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION, GROUPING AND\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PRIORITIZING OF INFORMATION\nI looked in one dictionary and two encyclopedias. One encyclopedia said that sound is\ndefined by the ear detecting (hearing) the vibrations in the air. This would mean the tree\nin the question would make no sound if no one is around. The other encyclopedia and\nthe dictionary defined sound as the vibrations itself, whether or not someone is around to\nhear them. By this definition, the tree would make a sound even if no one was around.\nAs you see, the famous tree debate isn\u2019t a matter of philosophy but of word definition.\nThe difference between \u201cYes, it makes a sound\u201d and \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make a sound\u201d can\ncome down to the arbitrary choice of definition, the outvoting of 2 reference books to 1,\nthe flipping of a coin. Depending on what definitions used, the answer of Yes and No can\ndescribe the same forest scene. Is one sound definition superior than the other? Not that I\ncan see. They\u2019re just different.\nPeople also have differing definitions of the word one in \u2018\u2026no one is around to hear\u2026\u2019\nSome people think deer, birds and mice count as ones, while others think only humans\ncount. The definition of one can also determine whether the answer is is Yes or No.\nCertain words have strong connotations in a culture, and people intentionally play around\nwith the definitions so they can apply words as they desire. If patriot is a popular label,\n111122 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIZATION, GROUPING AND\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PRIORITIZING OF INFORMATION\npeople will fiddle with the definition so that they are defined as patriots and their enemies\nare not. If patriot is an unpopular label, the same people would define the word so that\ntheir enemies are patriots and they are not. These shameless self serving manipulations of\ndefinitions are common during political campaign season, but also during our daily lives.\nWhat may be a lie when someone else does it, is a fib if you do it.\nNotice these instances involve people being emotionally attached to a word no matter how\nit is defined. It\u2019s word numerology.\nWhen I was in high school, the quarterback for the football team came to school wearing\na pink sweater. He spent the day saying, \u201cNo, it\u2019s coral.\u201d\n19.3 DISCUSSION QUESTION\nIs a red ball red in the dark? Is this a physics question or a language question?\n113 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS when does 1 + 1 not equAl 2?: the subjeCtIvIty of IdentIfICAtIon\n20 WHEN DOES 1 + 1 NOT\nEQUAL 2?: THE SUBJECTIVITY\nOF IDENTIFICATION\nThis chapter is another example of how human identification, labelling and defining of things\ncan be subjective and arbitrary.\nA basic part of mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, economics and daily life is\ncounting. Counting is popularly considered to be an objective activity. In the field, however,\nit involves subjectivity. Not over whether 1 + 1 = 2, but over what is 1. Both scientists\nand non-scientists have personal and varying views of what is 1 and what is 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nHumans mentally, even nonconsciously, individualize things, isolate, group and count\nthings \u2013 whether or not the things were designed to be individualized, isolated, grouped\nand counted. To humans a dog is one thing. A cat is one. A dog and a cat are two. This\nnumbering is not just intellectual, but often psychological, aesthetic, moral, religious, political\nand philosophical. A human being is popularly regarded as a single thing, a proverbial island\nunto itself. Some will be morally offended if you count a human differently. Two humans,\neven if physically connected by holding hands, are not considered one human, but two.\nA distant snow capped mountain of one billion stones is commonly referred to as one thing,\nnot one billion things. Yet three of the stones removed and held in one\u2019s hand will be labeled\nas three. This shift is a reflection of the counter\u2019s mind and eyesight more than the counted.\nMountains and stones existed fine before humans were around to count and individualize\nthem.

The counting is a human exercise.\nWhen a long cloud briefly separates in the middle many call it two things, two clouds.\nWhat is the legitimacy of this representation? Could it just as well be called one? Is either\nnumber an arbitrary choice, a definition of terms?\nA lake and connected creek that share the same water and fish are commonly considered\ntwo things. Is this the correct representation? Could they instead be considered one?

What is interesting about this example is that the roads are\nmore physically one than two boards nailed or glued together. If you stand at the middle\nof the intersection, the two roads at that point are physically the same. It is not one road\nor the other road, it is both roads simultaneously. A piece of asphalt belongs to both. The\ntwo cannot be separated or distinguished from each other. At the intersection of the cross,\non the other hand, the two pieces of wood are easily distinguished and can be separated.\nPhysically at least, the roads could be considered more one thing than the cross.\nMy sandbox of stones\nSay I have in my front yard a sandbox filled deep with an unchanging amount of stones.\nJust as with a sandbox of sand, no matter how I fiddle or play or scoop or make stone\ncastles there is never a gap with no stones.\nIn this ever unbroken sea of stones, I make two tall mounds of stones on the surface. If I\npull someone off the sidewalk, point to the box of stones and say, \u201cHow many things do\nyou see?,\u201d she likely will say two. She may even point out that the two things she sees are\n111155 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS when does 1 + 1 not equAl 2?: the subjeCtIvIty of IdentIfICAtIon\nthe mounds. If I had instead made three mounds, it\u2019s likely she will say there are three\nthings. If there was one mound, it\u2019s fair to assume she would have said one. If the surface\nwas flat (no mounds), she may say there is one thing. Even if her answers aren\u2019t as I just\nsaid, they likely would change depending on the number of mounds.\nDuly note that my question was \u2018How many things do you see?\u2019 I didn\u2019t ask how many\nstones or how many shapes or how many mounds. I let the woman define what was a thing\nand count as she sees fit.\nThere are two interesting aspects about her counting of things in the box. First, it is not clear\nthat the number of things in the box ever changed. There was always a body containing an\nidentical amount of stones. The body was constant, other than the changing surface shape.\nNo one I know counts lakes by counting the number of surface waves. To most people,\na strong wind doesn\u2019t create more lakes. People don\u2019t count triangles as objects differently\nthan squares, or two-humped camels differently than one hump camels (\u201cGuess what,\nMom. I saw two camels at the zoo today. One one-humped camel and one two-humped\ncamel.\u201d) There was never any separation that created isolated islands of stones. It was the\nchanging surface shape that caused different number answers. Her counting was personal.\nA different person looking at the same stones might come up with different numbers, as\nhe defined things differently.\nThe second interesting thing was that, even if accepting her definition of surface mounds\nas the things, the woman\u2019s math was goofy. When there were one, two, three mounds, the\nwoman counted things by the number of mounds. But when there were no mounds, she\ndidn\u2019t say there was nothing. She likely would have said there was one thing (the body of\nstones) or been confused as to what she was supposed to count or perhaps said \u201cThere are\na lot of stones. I can\u2019t count them all.\u201d Her definition of what is a thing and her method\nof counting was inconsistent. In her math, removing 1 thing (mound) from 1 thing did\nnot equal 0, and, in fact, may have equaled more than 1.\nThe act of counting the box of stones, or land or clouds or a herd of wildebeest, has at least\nas much to do with the counter, her biases and perceptions and idiosyncrasies and choices,\nas with the subject being counted. That the woman\u2019s definitions changed and different\npeople off the sidewalk may count the box of stones differently demonstrates this. Many\npeople believe that the individualizing and counting of things is intrinsic to the things being\nindividualized and counted, but there is no evidence this is true. The human counting of\na mountain may have nothing to do with what it is. Is a cross 1 or 2? Why does it have\nto be either?\n116 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS when does 1 + 1 not equAl 2?: the subjeCtIvIty of IdentIfICAtIon\nMany will point out that counting is essential for humans, an important tool for functioning.\nThis is correct, but again demonstrates that counting is about humans. Having a practical\nuse doesn\u2019t make a subjective and arbitrary rule any less subjective and arbitrary.\nDiscussion Question\nIs a bag of potato chips one thing? Many? Both? Neither?

Well, there are\nthirteenth floors, but the floors are labeled 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 to give the superficial appearance\nof having no thirteenth floors. The building owners know many have a superstition against\nthe numeral thirteen and it\u2019s easier to rent an apartment or office if it\u2019s called \u2018fourteen.\u2019\nIn Korea and Japan where four is considered unlucky as it\u2019s the sign of death, some buildings\n\u2018omit\u2019 the fourth floor.\n21.2 OUR BASE-10 NUMERAL SYSTEM\nThe common modern human counting system \u2013 the one you and I use \u2013 is based on ten,\nand is referred to as base-10. It uses 10 different numeral symbols (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) to\nrepresent all numbers, and many popular groupings are divisible by ten: 10, 20, 100, 300,\n10,000, century, decade, top 10 lists, golden anniversary, etc.\nOur base-10 system is based on the number of digits on a human\u2019s hands: eight fingers and\ntwo thumbs. As with today, many ancient humans found fingers and thumbs convenient\nfor counting and it seemed only natural to base a counting system on the 10 digits.\nWhile the base-10 is a good system and has served us well, ten as the base was a somewhat\narbitrary choice. Our numeral system could have been based on 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 20 or\nother number. Instead of basing it on the total digits on a pair of hands, it could have been\nbased on the points of an oak leaf (9), the sides of a box (6), the fingers on a pair of hands\n(8). These different base systems would work. Some might work as well or better than our\nbase-10 system. Nuclear physicists and tax accountants could make their calculations using\na 9 or 11-base system. Once you got used to the new system, you could count toothpicks\nand apples just as accurately as you do now.\n118 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\n21.3 QUICK COMPARISON: COUNTING WITH\nBASE-10 VERSUS BASE-8\n3 8 2 7\n2 4 7 9 1 3 6 10\n5 6 4 5\n1 10\nBase-10 Base-8\nFigure 21.1\nThe above pictures compare counting with a base-10 system based on the ten digits of the\nhands (fingers + thumbs), and with a base-8 system based on just the eight fingers (thumbs\nnot used). Notice that the base-8 system, not using the thumbs, is missing two numeral\nsymbols: 8 and 9.\nFigure 21.2\nThis comparison picture shows how assorted designs (top row) are counted with the base-10\nand with the base-8 systems. As base-8 omits the two symbols 8 and 9, \u201810\u2019 comes sooner\nwhen counting in base-8. In one numeration system, the cat is \u20189\u2019 and in the other is \u201911.\u2019\nAs you can see, the real value of 10, amongst other numeral symbols, is not an absolute.\nIt depends on what base is being used.\n21.4 ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF COUNTING WITH DIFFERENT BASES\nThe following table illustrates how you can count symbols (far right column) using the\nbase-10, base-9, base-8 and base-5 systems. If you wish, the symbols can represent physical\nobjects like fruit or cars or plants. In this table the symbols are constant, while the numeral\n119 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nsystems create different numeral labels for the symbols (or fruit or cars or plants). For those\nwho consider \u201813\u2019 unlucky, notice that each counting system labels a different symbol as\nbeing 13.\nBase 5 Base 8 Base 9 Base 10 Symbols\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 !\n2 2 2 2 @\n3 3 3 3 #\n4 4 4 4 $\n10 5 5 5 %\n11 6 6 6 ^\n12 7 7 7 &\n13 10 8 8 *\n112200 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nBase 5 Base 8 Base 9 Base 10 Symbols\n14 11 10 9 (\n20 12 11 10 )\n21 13 12 11 -\n22 14 13 12 +\n23 15 14 13 \u2018\u2018\n24 16 15 14 :\n30 17 16 15 >\n31 18 17 16 <\n32 19 18 17 {\n33 20 19 18 ]\nFigure 21.3\nThis counting stuff is not idle abstraction. Civilizations have used and use different\nnumeral systems.\nThe Yuki Indians of California used a base-8 numeral system. Instead of basing their system\non the digits on their hands, they based it on the spaces between the digits.\nThe Ancient Mayans used a base-20 system, as they counted with the digits on their hands\nand feet. They lived in a hot climate where people didn\u2019t wear closed toe shoes.\nToday\u2019s computer scientists use 2, 8 and 16-base systems. For some mathematical work base-\n12 is more convenient than base-10. For this base-12 system they usually use the normal\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 numerals and add the letters a and b to make twelve (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b).\nIt goes without saying that these mathematicians, often university professors and researchers,\nare using this system to perform higher levels of calculations than you or I perform in our\ndaily lives. They aren\u2019t counting change at the grocery store.\nOur normal lives show the vestiges of ancient numeral systems. We sometimes count with\nAncient Roman numerals (Super Bowl XXIV, King Richard III), letters (chapter 4a, chapter\n4b, chapter 4c\u2026 Notice how this combines two different systems, standard numerals with\nletters) and tally marks. We group loaves of bread, inches and ounces by the dozen, and\nmark time in groups of sixty (60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour). Counting\n121 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\ninches and ounces by twelve comes from the Ancient Romans. Our organization of time in\ngroups of 60 comes from the Sumerians, an ancient civilization that used a base- 60 system.\nThe traditional counting of bread into groups of twelve has practical convenience. At the\nmarket, a dozen loaves can be divided into whole loaves by two, three or four. Ten loaves\ncan only be divided by two into whole loaves. Sellers and customers prefer the grouping\nthat gives more whole loaf options, not wanting a loaf to be torn apart. This should give\nyou an idea why feet and yards are divisible by twelve, and there were twelve pence in a\nshilling \u2013 you get more \u2018whole\u2019 fractions out of twelve than you do ten.\nThese have been just some examples of other numeral systems, as there has been a wide and\nvaried number over history. This not only includes systems with different bases, but with\ndifferent kinds and numbers of numeral symbols. In Ancient Eastern countries, physical\nrods were used to represent numbers. The number, position, direction and color of the rod\nrepresented a number. In Ancient Egypt, pictures, known as hieroglyphics, were used to\nrepresent numbers. One thousand was written as a lily, and 10,000 as a tadpole. The Ancient\nHebrews had a similar system to ours, except they used 27 different symbols to our ten.\nFor the Hebrews, numbers 20, 30, 40, etc each got its own unique symbol.\nFigure 21.4 Ancient Egyptian numerals for 1,000 (lily flower) and one million\n(man with raised arms)\nFigure 21.5 Tally marks\n122 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nTallying is an ancient basic counting system many of us use. The practical problem with\nthis system is that numbers like 500 and 10,000 require a whole lotta tally marks. 500\nrequires 500 tally marks. Over history, numeral systems have changed and evolved to correct\ninconveniences like this. Notice we use the tally system only for simple tasks, like keeping\nscore in a ping pong game and marking days.\n21.5 A KID\u2019S COUNTING SYSTEM: EENY MEENY MINY MOE\nKids have long used counting rhymes to decide who is it. The below common rhyme does\nthe equivalent of counting to twenty, with the last word being the twentieth word.\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe Catch a tiger by the toe If he hollers let him go, Eeny, meeny,\nminy, moe\nThere are a few interesting things about this eeny meeny counting system. First, it is quasi\nbase-20, not our normal base-10. Second, words are used as numerals, or as the practical\nequivalent of numerals. Kids could count to 20 for the same practical result, but they chose\nto use words. Third, while lucky 7, 10 and unlucky 13 have popular importance compared\n112233 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nto other numerals in our base-10 system, the seventh, tenth and thirteenth words in the\nrhyme do not.\nThis is an example where a different counting system changes what numbers are perceived as\nimportant. Most kids who count with this rhyme aren\u2019t even aware which are the seventh,\ntenth and thirteenth words.\nHumans often say they can\u2019t conceptualize numbers in anything but the normal base-10,\nbut here is a base-20 words counting system that we have all used. Granted this counting\nsystem is simplistic in the extreme, used for one and only one purpose \u2013 to count to twenty\n(moe). You wouldn\u2019t want to try and use it to calculate your taxes.\n21.6 NUMERALS AND HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY\nHumans form psychological attachments and biases for the numeration systems they use.\nHaving grown up using a particular system, and seeing all those around them using the\nsame, many people assume their numeration system is absolute and eternal. Before reading\nthis chapter, you may not have known or thought about the existence of other systems.\nYour base-10 system was all you knew, the prism which you saw the universe. 10, 100\nand 1000 \u2013 popular products of your base-10 system \u2013 are numbers you are attracted to.\nThinking in base-8 or base-7 is foreign.\nIt\u2019s telling to look at how humans change their perception from system to system, and how\na change of numeration system changes peoples\u2019 perceptions of things. The perception is\nnot just about the numeration system itself, but the things the numeration system is used\nto count \u2013 objects, time, ideas.\nAs the earlier tables showed, a different base numeral system doesn\u2019t change the accuracy of\nour calculations or the physical objects we calculate. However, if we retroactively changed\nour base-10 system to a non base-10 system (like say the Yuki\u2019s base-8 system) we would\nchange how humans perceive and react to objects and concepts.\nAs with the high rise buildings and the superstitious renters, the historical changes would\nbe caused in large part by human perceptions of the numerals themselves rather the things\nthe numerals represent. No matter what the Mexico City building owner calls the thirteenth\nfloor, it is the same floor. If he changes the label on the elevator directory from \u201813\u2019 to\n\u20189988\u2019 or to \u2018789\u2019 or to \u2018Q,\u2019 it is the same floor with the same walls, ceiling and windows\nand distance above the sidewalk. The numerologist apartment seekers aren\u2019t reacting to the\nfloor but to the symbol \u201813.\u2019 It should not surprise that a change to the symbols, such as\n124 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\ncaused by the changing to a new counting system, will change their reaction to the floors,\nalong with many other things.\nWith a large lot of stones lined up on a table, changing the numeral system has no direct\neffect on the amount or physical nature of the stones. With a new counting system, the stones\nwould be the same stones, but many to most would be assigned different numeral names.\nWhile the stones are the same stones no matter what we call them, human perceptions of\nthe stones change as the stones\u2019 numeral names change. Under our popular base-10 system,\nhumans consider certain numerals to be special, including 10, 100, 1000 and 13, and react\naccordingly to objects labeled with these names. With the new numeral representations,\nhumans\u2019 perception and treatment of the stones will change. If before a person avoided a\nstone because it was unlucky 13, in the new system a different stone would be called 13.\nIf in the old system the stone labeled \u2018100\u2019 was singled out as special, in the new system\n\u2018100\u2019 would represent a different stone.\nIf a human is asked to count and group the stones, the grouping will change with the\ndifferent counting system. In the base-10 system, it\u2019s likely the person would make piles of\n10 or 25 stones or similar standard. In an 8 or 9 base system, the number and size of the\npiles would be different. To someone standing across the room, the rock design would be\ndifferent. Her aesthetic reaction to the formation would be different.\nThis shows that your numeration system isn\u2019t just an objective observation system, but helps\nform how you perceive objects. Under a different system, you would perceive things differently.\nFigure 21.6 Equal numbers of coins in different stacks\nThe lines separate the same number of coins. The left group contains 30 total coins in\nstacks, the middle group between the lines has 30 coins in stacks, the group to the right\nof the right line has 30 coins in stacks. The coins of each group were stacked by different\nnumeral systems. This is why the same numbers of coins look different.\n125 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nThe lines separate the same number of coins. The left group contains 30 total coins in\nstacks, the middle group between the lines has 30 coins in stacks, the group to the right\nof the right line has 30 coins in stacks. The coins of each group were stacked by different\nnumeral systems. This is why the same numbers of coins look different.\n21.7 CHANGING NUMERAL SYSTEMS, CHANGING HISTORY\nAs a numeration system changes how we perceive, organize and react to things, a retroactive\nchange to the numeral systems would change human history. The amount and type of\nchange can be debated, but today\u2019s history books would read differently. With a change\nto the standard numeration system, time would remain the same but human marking of\ntime would change. The decade, century and millennium equivalents would be celebrated\nat different times. No Y2K excitement at the same time as we had. Special milestones, like\ncurrent marriage 10th or 25th anniversaries, would be at different times. People who now\nreceive 30 years of service awards might receive equivalent awards but after a different duration.\nThink of all those sports championships decided in the last moments, including the improbable\nupsets and bloop endings. If the events took place at different times and under different\n112266 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nnumeral influenced conditions some of the outcomes would be different. If an Olympic\nsprint is decided by a fraction of a second, it\u2019s unlikely the first to last place order would\nbe identical if it took place the day before with the runners in switched lanes and running\na different length race. The changes to marking of time and distance would likely result in\ndifferent gold, silver and bronze medal winners over the years. If a horse race was a tie, it\nis unlikely the same horses would tie if the race had been run earlier or later in the day or\non a different day over a different length race. Realize that the change to the numeration\nsystem would likely change the standard race distances, even if the changes were just slight.\nThink of all the razor close political elections. If the elections took place at a different\ntime, even if just a day earlier or later, it\u2019s possible some would have different outcomes. A\nfew of the outcomes could have been for President, Prime Minister, judge or other socially\ninfluencing position. Think of all those close historic battles that may or may not have had\na different outcome if started at different times, using different size platoons and regiments\nand Generals who made decisions using different number biases. Napoleon Bonaparte was\nsuperstitious of 13 and made his government, social and military plans accordingly. Think\nof the influential or not yet influential people who died at relatively young ages in accidents,\nfrom Albert Camus to General Patton to Buddy Holly. James Dean died in a sports car\ncrash at age 25. Would he have crashed if he started his drive at an earlier or later time?\nPopular perception of the actor no doubt would be quite different if we watched him grow\nold and bald.\nThe powerful nineteenth century Irish Leader Charles Stewart Parnell would not sign a\nlegislative bill that had thirteen clauses. A clause had to be added or subtracted before it\ncould become law. Irish law would have been different under a different numeral system.\nUnited States consumer prices would likely be affected by a different numeral system, if\njust marginally. Again, this would be due to human psychological perceptions of numerals.\nEven though most current US sellers and buyers think nothing of one penny, often tossing\nit in the garbage or on the sidewalk, sellers regularly price things at $9.99 instead of $10,\nand $19.99 instead of $20. Check the newspaper ads. This pricing is purely aesthetic,\nintending to play on consumers biases towards numerals.\nThe shallowness of this 1 cent game is illustrated when it is used by stores that have a \u2018give\na penny, take a penny\u2019 tray, and that it is used in many states with different sales tax rates.\nMost people psychologically affected by $9.99 pricing at home are also affected by $9.99\npricing when traveling by car across the country. That the daily change in sale tax charge\ndwarfs the one cent between $9.99 and $10, illustrates the traveler\u2019s irrationalness.\n127 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nUnder a base-9 numeral system that omits the numeral \u20189,\u2019 $9.99 and $19.99 would no\nlonger exist, and the visually appealing \u201cone cent below big number\u201d pricing would land\nelsewhere. In a 9 digit system, it\u2019s likely that there would be many $8.88 and $18.88 pricings\nin newspaper ads, and the same types of travelers would be attracted to $8.88 and $18.88\nprices as they go state to state even though the taxes change state to state.\nThere are a variety of intertwined reasons behind irrational biases towards numerals and\nnumeral systems.\nOne reason is people form psychological attachments towards a system, its symbols and the\nstandard groupings of objects made from the system. A three digit numeral price ($9.99)\nlooks distinctly different than a four digit numeral price ($10.00), literally being shorter.\nOne hundred stones grouped into 10 groups of 10 each will look different than 11 groups\nof 9 stones each with one leftover. It\u2019s the same amount of stones, but their physical designs\nlook different. There\u2019s an aesthetic aspect to how humans view symbols and groupings.\nClosely related reasons are tradition and habit. If you have used our base-10 system all your\nlife, it\u2019s as natural to you as your native spoken language. In fact words such as nine, ten and\ndecade are part of your daily vocabulary. If everyone you know uses this numeral system,\nthe idea of using a different system may not have even crossed your mind before now. The\nidea of calculating using a base-8 or base-11 system seems strange and even unnatural to\nmost people because they were raised on base-10.\nAnother reason behind irrational biases towards numerals is the seeming, if nonexistent,\nabsoluteness of the familiar numerals. While the true nature of time, supernatural, war, love\nand the cosmos are shrouded in mystery, the numerals traditionally used in representing\nthese things seem tangible, concrete. Unlike philosophical abstractions, numerals can be\nwritten down and typed into the calculator. Even little kids can count numerals on their\nfingers. That folks such as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein used these same numerals\nseem to numerologists to indicate the numerals\u2019 potency. Though, if asked, both scientists\nwould agree they could have used other numeral systems to do their work, and there was\nnothing uniquely special about the system they adopted.\nNumerals are used only as convenient notations, proverbial post-its to label objects. They\nhave no absolute, inborn connection to the things they represent. Whether you call the\nanimal cat or gato it\u2019s the same animal, and whether you call a number 5, five or V, it\u2019s\nthe same number. Whether you count a grove of trees with a base-10 or a base-8 system,\nthey are the same trees. If you count and label the trees a,b,c,d,e,f,g, they are still the same\ntrees. Numerologists incorrectly assign an absolute meaning and identity to the numerals\nthat don\u2019t exist.\n128 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge: numerAtIon systems And psyChology\nEven in academia, mathematicians considered to be too enamored with the beauty of numbers\nat the expense of practical use are sometimes derogatorily called numerologists by applied\nscientists like engineers. Mathematicians are as influenced by aesthetics as the rest of us.\nSounds Good\nMany Chinese judge numbers as good or bad by what words they sound closest to. As\ntheir pronunciation of 3 sounds closest to their word for \u2018live,\u2019 3 is considered good. Their\npronunciation of 4 sounds close to their word for \u2018not,\u2019 so is often considered negative.\nChina is a huge country with many dialects. As numbers and words are pronounced\ndifferently in different areas, a number\u2019s perceived goodness and badness depend on where\nyou are. For example, 6 is considered good in some places and bad in others.\n112299 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And models: the fICtIon In sCIenCe\n22 LANGUAGE AND MODELS:\nTHE FICTION IN SCIENCE\nThis chapter shows how scientific representations and models are language, with all the limitations\nof language.\nScientific representations are different than the things they represent. A representation,\nmodel or description is a limited view of the subject, made for a specific purpose, edited\nby the scientist and translated into a form the scientific audience can understand and use.\nAs scientific representations are made by and for humans, they are part about the scientific\nsubject and part about the humans using them.\nA paper world map is a useful device, but one with a plethora of differences than what it\nrepresents. To start with the obvious, the world isn\u2019t flat, it isn\u2019t paper thin and can\u2019t fit on\nyour desk or be pinned to the wall. These unreal qualities are for the convenience of the user.\nFor easy understanding, maps are artificially colored and marked (latitude and longitudes\nlines, for example). Roadmaps usually make roads appear proportionally wider than in\nreality, and remove unwanted details.\nAll world maps have proportional distortions. For an example see the following page.\nTranslating anything three dimensional into two dimensions requires distortions, as three\ndimensions and two dimensions are mutually exclusive. Compare your world map at home\nto a globe and see the differences for yourself. There are different methods of mapping the\nearth, each method creating its own distortions.\nFigure 22.1 Distortions on maps. As with all types of world maps, this common\nMercator projection map has significant distortions. Greenland is incorrectly shown\nas being bigger than Africa. Alaska is shown as being as large as Brazil, when Brazil\nis really multiple times larger.\n130 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And models: the fICtIon In sCIenCe\nFigure 22.2\nThe above representation of an atom is different than a real atom in an abundance of major\nways. To start, it\u2019s thousands and thousands of times larger than a real atom. If it weren\u2019t\nyou couldn\u2019t see it.\nThe representation hardy resembles an atom, and the artist would agree. The intent was to\nmake a dummy model for students to learn about the different atomic \u2018parts.\u2019 The unreal balls,\nouter ring and cartoonish appearance are designed to engage the audience, simplify things.\nAs with the map, this representation is part about the subject and part about humans. It is\nin a form students can understand. In this case the form students understand looks more\nlike a Saturday morning cartoon character than an atom.\nAny human representation of something complex (and all things are complex) is simplified\nand distorted, focusing on a specific area, quality, layer or angle, made from a limited amount\nof information, interpreted by the maker\u2019s sensibilities, presented in a way the maker and\naudience can understand.\nAs a means of communication, a representation will include conceits of the scientist, audience\nand even general culture. These conceits include expected form (pie charts, graphs, book,\nmagazine article), style, shape, measurement method (volume, height, meters, liters), color\nassociations (hot = red, cold = blue, forest = green).\nIt is similar to art, where following the genre\u2019s conceits, even shallow ones, are constraining\nbut necessary for communication. The conceits create an artificial representation, but without\nthem you might as well be communicating in a foreign language.\n131 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And models: the fICtIon In sCIenCe\nJust as the creation and perception of art involve human psychology, so does the creation\nand perception of scientific representations.\nWhether they admit it or not, scientists and philosophers view the universe and the things\nin it psychologically. A scientist and her work can no more escape human psychology than\nshe can escape being human.\nAll one has to do is to look at a scientific representation, any representation, and find the\nhuman imprint \u2013 the human sensibility in form, style, color, language, balance, aesthetic\nchoice. A representation of water may be a magazine article in English. English language and\nmagazine articles, of course, have to do with humans and communication between humans.\nThe article\u2019s subject may be about water, but its form is human. The article will be read as\na work of human literature, as it is a work of human literature. As an artifact, the article\nshows about as much about humans as it does about water.\n113322 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And models: the fICtIon In sCIenCe\nOrganize the following into two groups of related objects\nFigure 22.3\nScientists, and non-scientists find it convenient and often necessary to group information.\nI asked different people, including a science professor, to group the previous objects into\ntwo groups of like objects. One person grouped by color (black objects and white objects),\nanother by size, another by letters. He saw the objects as E\u2019s and C\u2019s. Interesting, as I drew\nthe C\u2019s as moons! Another by direction left or right (problematic as one doesn\u2019t know if a\nmoon is faced left or right). Their reasons for pairing were equally legitimate, but produced\ndifferent pairings. This should show you how one scientist\u2019s model can look different\nthan another\u2019s, not due to scientific theory or knowledge but different views of aesthetics,\nsimplicity and associations.\nThis illustrates an essential human problem that goes beyond science. Humans must translate\na subject to understand it, but what they understand is the translation.\nA scientific representation is a product of the scientist\u2019s purpose. A different purpose will\nproduce a different representation of the same subject.\nI own three maps of North America. One represents the altitude (mountains, valleys, etc),\none shows the traditional aboriginal tribal regions and one is a roadmap. Even though they\nare of the identical place, each map is different. It\u2019s not so much whether the maps are right\nor wrong, but that they were created from different purposes.\nMany to most scientific representations aren\u2019t intended to be the be all and end all. Scientists\nusually consider scientific models to be works in progress, to be studied, tested, reworked,\nchanged and even tossed aside as necessary. Science is a continual work in progress.\nFor testing purposes, models are often intentionally made to be overly simple. One purpose\nof such simplification is that errors are more easily identified and corrected. With a more\ncomplicated, muddled model, it\u2019s harder to identify what is working and what is not.\n133 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS lAnguAge And models: the fICtIon In sCIenCe\nAnother reason for simplification is the scientist may be studying only one aspect of the\nsubject. The other aspects are excluded. If a dentist is studying the teeth and gums, there may\nbe no need for her computer model to be full-bodied, including detailed feet, fingernails,\nhair color and belly button. It may not even include eyes and nose, even though people with\nteeth and gums also have eyes and noses nearby. She may consider these details distracting\nand \u201cbeside the point.\u201d\nA scientist will often be the first to say her representation isn\u2019t a duplication of the subject,\nand was never intended to be an exact duplication of the subject.\nAs with communicating of scientific ideas to others, reducing a subject into a simplified\nif unrealistic model has practical purposes. Scientific progress would be stunted without\nsimple, artificial models.\nKnowing that all representations contain fiction, a question to ask about a particular\nrepresentation is whether the fiction is a device or compromise required for communication\nof ideas, testing or other practical use, or is it wrongly portrayed as part of the subject\u2019s\ninnate meaning. If you are well aware a fiction is fiction, there is no big issue. If you confuse\nfiction for fact, that is a problem.\nWhile fiction, the size of the earlier representation of an atom is needed for humans to see\nthe representation. If the representation was life size, it would useless to instructors and\nstudents. Similarly, artificial color coding for a diagram or map can make for easier and\nquicker understanding. It\u2019s easier to find countries on a map if each is distinctly colored.\nThese are examples of where the inclusion of artifice is fair and understandable.\nA related question is how seriously is the fiction taken, both by the creator and the audience.\nStudents and even seasoned scientists can become too comfortable, too enamored with clich\u00e9s\nof color, shape and words. Through repetition, superficial conceits can become false idols.\n\u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d\n\u2013 Statistician George E.P.

However, language has its problems and limitations, including that it\nis a limited and sometimes delusory representation of what it is trying to represent. Many\nthings cannot be summarized by words or models. Further, language is subjective, with no\nfixed meaning and is regularly interpreted differently by different people. As a product of\nhumans, it is full of conceits, biases, subjectivity, imagination, irrationality and personal taste.\nIn many cases, the meaning of language isn\u2019t in taking the symbolic language literally or\nobjectively, but what is implied or figuratively said. This is shown in poetry, humor, sarcasm,\nreligious parables, zen riddles. This shows that the literal language itself is limited and the\nideas are larger and more complex.\n113355 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24 BASIC QUALITIES THAT\nEVOKE EMOTIONAL AND\nAESTHETIC REACTIONS\nThis chapter shows how basic visual qualities and designs produce aesthetic and even physical\nreactions in human\nFigure 24.1 Which design pleases your senses more? Which is calm and serene\nand which is loud and noisy? Your picks are natural.\n24.1 INTRODUCTION\nUsing brain scans, neuroscientists such as Semir Zeki of University College London and\nVilayanur S. Ramachandran of University of California at San Diego have shown that\nmuch of our aesthetic perception of art and the world is natural emotional reaction to\nbasic sensory stimuli. Whether viewed on their own or incorporated into art or the physical\nworld, many simple, basic qualities and designs evoke natural psychological, aesthetic and\neven physical reactions in humans. Many of the basic ideas in this chapter come from the\nwork of Zeki and Ramachandran.\nThe reactions we have to certain colors, angles and textures are in part hardwired into our\nbrains, though can be honed and altered with experience, education and culture. Artists\nuse these emotion inducing qualities to help express their artistic ideas and create aesthetic\nfeelings. A landscape painter may use warm colors and soft lines to evoke pleasant and\nserene reactions, while an advertising poster artist or propagandist may use bold colors and\njagged lines to excite the senses and raise the blood pressure.\nThe following looks at just several of these qualities and our responses. When you think\nabout them, you will realize that many of these reactions have practical uses, uses that\nhelped us survive as a species and live efficient lives today.\n136 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.2 SYMMETRY AND BALANCE\nFigure 24.2 Yin and Yang balance\nHumans are naturally attracted to symmetrical and balanced scenes in nature and designs in\nart. We judge the health and beauty of other humans by symmetry. The standard beautiful\nface and healthy young body are symmetrical. On the flip side, someone with a hunchback,\nlimp or disfigured limb is seen as injured or diseased. A flower that is wilted or a tree that\nis tilted to one side is seen as dying or sick.\nArtists commonly use symmetry and balance to depict beauty and elicit a pleasurable, serene\nresponse in viewers. An artist who wants to express disorder, violence and chaos may remove\nsymmetry and balance. She may leave things out of place, make things crooked and messy.\nMovie monsters are commonly depicted as deformed and unbalanced. Zombies drag limbs.\nThis hard-wired attraction to symmetry and visceral distaste of out of balance was important\nto our survival as a species, as mating with youthful healthy people and raising healthy\ncrops helped ensure the survival of the species.\nFigure 24.3 Nosferatu the vampire\n137 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\nMovie monsters, such as the vampire in 1922\u2019s Nosferatu, are depicted as deformed and\nunbalanced. Humans naturally get a negative, even repulsed, reaction from this.\n24.3 OUT OF PLACE\nBoth in art and in the physical world, and even on the dining room table, humans\nautomatically notice things that are out of place. This not only catches our attention in art,\nbut is necessary for our survival as a species. Our ancient in the wild selves wouldn\u2019t have\nsurvived long if they didn\u2019t notice things abnormal or seemingly out of place.\nFigure 24.4\n113388 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\nIf you ask kids, they can make up a story about what is going along with the previous\ndots. They may say the two dots are rebels shunned by the groups, or they may say they\nare trying to catch up with the group. To many, these dots are telling a story, even if they\nare not sure what it is the story.\n24.4 MYSTERIES AND SOLVING MYSTERIES\nHumans are distressed and intrigued by ambiguous scenes, juxtaposition of seemingly\nunrelated things, mysteries and puzzles in art and in the physical world. Our blood pressures\nrise and our attention is drawn.\nThis initial psychological and physiological response towards mysteries, as is often used in art,\nis natural. As is the following trying to figure out what is the meaning in the mysteries and\nwhat is the relationship between and larger meaning in the juxtaposed objects. Emotionally\nresponding to then feeling psychologically and intellectually compelled to solve mysteries\nis natural to humans, as is the pleasurable response we get when we feel we\u2019ve solved the\nmystery. There is a reason why so many people get enjoyment out of television mysteries,\njigsaw and crossword puzzles and magic eye pictures \u2013 at least when, in the end, the mystery\nis solved, or the puzzle finished. If the puzzle is never finished, or the \u2018who done it\u2019 in the\nMurder She Wrote is not given or is otherwise unsatisfactory (\u2018That was so contrived with\nso many illogical plot turns and missing details that no one in the audience could have\nfigured it out. In a proper mystery, the audience has to at least have a chance to logically\nfigure it out.\u2019), then the emotional response naturally is not pleasurable.\nThis mystery and mystery solving applies to still art, including paintings and photographs.\nPeople naturally ponder what is going on, try to solve the puzzle, figure out what the people\nin the scene are doing and thinking, who they are.\nThis all mirrors our ancient days when humans in the wild were at first distressed or intrigued\nby a mystery then glad when it was solved. Solving, or at least reacting, to such mysteries\nwas essential to survival.\nIn fact, humans enjoy solving a mystery more than knowing the answer right away. The final\npleasure is heightened when it is preceded by mystery and mental problem solving effort.\n139 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.5 MEANING AND IDENTIFICATION\nPeople naturally like scenes, situations and art where they know what is the meaning and\nidentity, as opposed to where the meaning (if there is one) is a complete mystery. People\noften have viscerally negative reactions to abstract art, because they don\u2019t understand it. They\ndon\u2019t know what it is supposed to mean, they don\u2019t see identifiable objects. They want it\nto be like \u2018normal\u2019 art where there is an obvious boat or a house or animal or mountains.\nPeople who are artists or otherwise more educated about art tend to like abstract art more,\nbecause they understand it more. With more exposure and longer viewing of an abstract\npainting, people tend to like the painting more. It\u2019s their initial, gut reaction that is most\nnegative and visceral.\nThis is a natural reaction in humans throughout our history, as all humans have never liked,\nor at least are highly intrigued, when faced with a situation where they have no idea what\nis going on. They want concrete answers and identities. It\u2019s important to survival.\n24.6 CONTRAST\nFigure 24.5 Lack of Contrast in a Monet painting of fog\nRelated to mystery and identification, people naturally like good contrast and have a negative\nor intrigued reaction to lack of contrast.\nThis is because good contrast means we can identify things, and bad contrast makes\nidentification and distinction harder to impossible. Fog and dark obscure or hide identity\nand blur the lines between different objects.\nThere is a reason that murder mysteries and horror movies often involve fog and dark. The\nhidden and obscured scare us, literally raises our blood pressures. When the fog or dark is\nremoved and a harmless scene is revealed, there is a pleasing, relaxing reaction.\n140 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.7 UNREALISTIC EXAGGERATIONS\nProfessor Ramachandran says that humans are psychologically influenced by unrealistic\nexaggerations of certain qualities.\nTake size as one example. To humans, the larger the wolf or alligator or gorilla or bear or\nmountain, the more intimidating and awesome. The larger man is assumed to be the more\npowerful than the smaller one. Logically, you know you will likely someday see a house\nand bear and spider bigger than you\u2019ve seen before.\nThis mindset extends beyond the bounds of reality. In the extremes, we get impossible\nsuper powerful and super sized characters such as Hercules, Superman and the Incredible\nHulk. If a gorilla is intimidating due to its size and strength, then King Kong is that much\nmore intimidating.\nThis helps explain our psychological reactions to the exaggerated in art, dreams and daydreams.\n114411 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.8 IDENTIFYING OBJECTS THROUGH BASIC QUALITIES\nProfessor Zeki says humans naturally identify objects by basic, essential qualities. As objects\nsuch as trees, apples and dogs each vary to degree from specimen to specimen (two apples\nwill differ in tone, shape and/or size), we must be able to identify them by these basic\nqualities, such as general color, general shape, general size and weight.\nMany artists reduce the subjects of their art into the bare essentials that allow the viewers\nto recognize what they are.\nThe ability to identify objects by general key qualities is essential to our survival since our\nancient days, as bananas, for example, don\u2019t come in the exact same sizes, shapes and tones\nand we need to identify what objects are edible.\nFigure 24.6 Most people identify this detail from a Paul Cezanne painting as fruit.\nFigure 24.7 Impression, such as this 1913 painting \u2018The Parasol\u2019 by Karl Albert Buehr,\ntried to show how light played on objects and how the human eye naturally saw things.\nWe perceive a person in a wooded and bushes area.\n142 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\nFigure 24.8 Amedeo Modigliani painting\nthat you recognize as a woman\nFigure 24.9 An apple, of course. Notice that many symbols use the\nbare essentials of what they symbolize. Blue for sky or water, black\nfor night, stick figure with stick arms and legs for human, :) for happy.\n24.9 THE STRANGE AND NEW\nThings that are brand new and strange to your eyes, such as an albino squirrel in your\nbackyard or a bizarre animal at the zoo, catch your attention and imagination and literally\nraise your blood pressure.\nThis response is important as our current and ancient caveman selves wouldn\u2019t have survived\nlong if they didn\u2019t notice and ponder about new and strange things. Artists regularly use\nbold radical designs, odd objects, strange juxtapositions to catch the imagination of viewers\nand focus attention. Experiencing the new is often a major part of experiencing the sublime.\nOf course, new and strange are relative. A plant rare and exotic in Oslo may be a common\nweed in Buenos Aires.\n143 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.10 COLORS\nHumans have psychological reactions to colors, both due to nature and culture. Bright red\nand yellow naturally stimulate the senses and raise blood pressure, while blue is calming.\nBrown is earthy in both the figurative and sometimes literal sense, while green is naturally\nand culturally associated with nature.\nPeople have naturally favorite colors. It is often inborn. Someone may not know why blue\nis his favorite color, he just knows that it is. The color is pleasing over other colors. He\nwon\u2019t know why brown or green isn\u2019t his favorite, it just isn\u2019t.\nWomen tend to have better green/red color perception than men, so it should not be of\nsurprise that women more commonly pick green as their favorite color. Green will appear\nmore vibrant to the average woman than the average man. This points to girls liking pink\n(whitish red) and boys liking blue having at least part a biological basis. I told this to a\nfriend and she found it quite interesting. She said she and her husband had specifically\ntried breaking the girls/pink stereotype with their daughter, and the daughter grew up to\nstill like pink.\n114444 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS bAsIC quAlItIes thAt evoke emotIonAl And AesthetIC reACtIons\n24.11 FINAL THOUGHTS\nThis topic leads to significant philosophical questions. Many people believe the universe\n\u2018must\u2019 be balanced and orderly, and can\u2019t believe nature is random or chaotic. Yet, these\nbeliefs may merely be the product of inborn biological biases. Inborn biases and natural\naesthetic and emotional responses to simple stimuli lead humans to false conclusions all\nthe time, on a daily basis. Merely look at visual illusions, magic tricks, political propaganda\nand television advertising. As far as identifying the nature and meaning of the universe,\nthat you have a psychological compulsion to keep your work desk tidy and purple is the\ncolor most pleasing to your eyes is neither here nor there. I don\u2019t care if my desk is messy\nand my favorite color is blue.\nNeuroaesthetics is the name for the scientific study of aesthetic perception, and involves\nneuroscientists, biologists, psychologists and others. Many scientists are skeptical of the field,\nor at least of getting concrete answers, because sublime, beauty and ugliness are subjective and\ncan\u2019t be objectively identified or measured. Many artists and art lovers dislike the scientific\nstudy of art perception because they feel the knowledge ruins the mystery important to art.\n24.12 QUESTIONS\nDo you think art and the artistic experience can be fully explained by science, or do you\nthink there is something more to art? Do you think spirituality and the mystical religious\ncan be explained by science? Do you think everything can be explained by science, or does\nscience have limits?\n145 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng\n25 LEARNING\nLearning is a major part of being human and a major area of study. This chapter is short,\nbut the topic and examples of learning are shown throughout the book.\nBeing smart is not about never making mistakes, but in part about learning from one\u2019s\nmistakes. Edison\u2019s great inventions were achieved through trial and error.\nMany of our delusions, such as in Chapter 1 Conceits, are from false learning from limited\nexperience and assuming the limited instances apply to other places.\nThe following chapters are examples of delusions and limited conceptions from learning in\nsubjective, limited environments.\n114466 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng And perCeptIon: mIrAges\n26 L EARNING AND\nPERCEPTION: MIRAGES\nThis chapter shows how our perception and conception \u2013 even of what is right and wrong \u2013 is\nbased in parts on subjectivity, experience, learning and comparison.\nFigure 26.1 Water in the road mirage\nThe Conceits chapter showed how humans learn, often from limited and erroneous information.\nOur knowledge, while useful and important, is always limited and subjective \u2013 a product\nof our environment, education, experience.\nCommonly associated with nature, mirages are visual illusions where what we see is correct,\nbut abnormal. Mirages in nature are most commonly caused by unusual bending of light\nunder unusual air conditions. The view can be so abnormal that the viewer \u2018can\u2019t believe\nhis or her eyes.\u2019\nThe most famous mirage is when it erroneously appears as if a pool of water is in the\ndesert. More than a few thirsty wanderers have found nothing but disappointment ahead.\nThe previous pictured water in the road is the same type of mirage. Another related mirage\nis when sailors see an upside down ship in the sky. Enough to convince a pirate to swear\noff the hooch.\nThese three particular mirages happen when there are abnormal layers of hot versus cold\nair that cause the light to refract, or bend, from its usual course. This bending causes an\nobject to appear in an unexpected place. In the desert and highway a piece of the blue sky\nappears below the horizon, and is wrongly interpreted to be water. At sea a ship is bent\nupwards so it appears to be in the sky air.\n147 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng And perCeptIon: mIrAges\nA mirage is called a superior mirage where the object appears above where it normally\nappears (boat in sky). An inferior mirage is when the object appears below the where it\nnormally appears (sky in desert).\nThe inferior mirage happens when there is hot air near the ground. It shouldn\u2019t surprise that\ninferior images commonly happen when the ground surface is hot (desert, summer highway).\nA superior mirage happens when there is cold air near the surface. They commonly appear\nin the arctic and over frozen water.\nSunrise mirage. One of the most striking superior mirages is a sunrise mirage. These are\nseen over frigid areas, such as frozen lakes and seas. The light of the sun is bent upwards\nalong the earth\u2019s curved surface making the sunrise appear earlier than normal. The sun\nis also distorted. Sometimes two suns are seen at once, one superimposed over the other.\nFigure 26.2 Sunrise mirage seen from winter Minnesota\nThis mirage was noticed centuries ago by Western explorers stranded in the arctic over the\nwinter. That far north there is no sun 24 hours a day for much of the winter. The explorers\nwere surprised when the first sunrise of the season appeared days before it was supposed to.\nIt wasn\u2019t until centuries later that experts realized the explorers had witnessed this mirage.\nFigure 26.3 Pencil \u2018bending\u2019 in water\n148 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng And perCeptIon: mIrAges\nWater can bend light just as air can, the light bending from air to water or water to air\n(or air to water to air, etc.). A hardboiled egg distorts from normal appearance in a glass\nof water. The experienced spear fisher knows to spear to the side of the image of the fish\nor he will miss. Stones appear to ripple and wave in a crystal clear brook. One can study\nand demonstrate how mirages work with a drinking glass.\nThe mirages aren\u2019t wrong views of an object, just different. Our normal vision involves\ndistortions, including to color, details and angles, so one can hardly claim our normal\nvision is perfect and anything different imperfect. When they wish a better look, people\nwith 20/20 vision intentionally distort their vision with magnifying glasses, binoculars,\nperiscopes, video cameras and sunglasses.\nWhen you view a bird through binoculars the lens distorts the light to make the bird appear\nlarger and more detailed. You don\u2019t consider the binocular view of the bird wrong. You\nconsider it to be more reliable than your naked eye view (\u201cI thought it was a hawk, but\nit\u2019s just a crow.\u201d) A submarine\u2019s periscope bends light via mirrors so a sailor can see above\nwater. The sailor doesn\u2019t consider the view make believe. He considers it a view of reality.\n114499 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng And perCeptIon: mIrAges\nHumans classify views as mirages when they are abnormal and mysterious (at least to the\nviewer). There are many brilliant atmospheric effects that aren\u2019t considered mirages, as they\nare well understood. Little is more magnificent than a rainbow, but they are frequent and\npeople know there is a scientific explanation. Fog, snow, sunsets and seeing our reflection\nin puddles would be considered astounding if they weren\u2019t common events.\nThat thousands of pounds of bright white snow changed into grass in one (hot) weekend\ndoesn\u2019t cause you to write to Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not. You are well aware heat melts snow\nand underneath the snow is grass. You mowed that grass a few months ago. Ripley himself\nlikely had this occur on his lawn numerous times. The changing of the season is impressive,\nbut only a mirage to folks who have no memory of it.\nAfter waking up in the morning and seeing the season\u2019s first blanket of snow, my very young\nsister turned to my dad and said, \u201cDaddy, how\u2019d you do that?\u201d\nWhen people move to new geographies they often experience new weather phenomena.\nWhen I moved to Seattle, I experienced unusual (to me) night lighting effects caused by\nPuget Sound and clouds. One night I thought there was a large fire on the other side of\nthe sound. I later found out it was the lights of a distant hill-hidden town reflecting off\nof low clouds. This created a low, fiery glow. I see this lighting and it no longer fazes me.\nThe first time I saw it, it was a mirage. Now it\u2019s town light reflecting off of low clouds.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust water. Even a straight stick turns crooked in it.\u201d\n\u2013 W.C.

Answer one picture at\na time, by saying the answer aloud or to yourself.\nFigure 27.1\nThe images are not digital tricks or manipulations. They were picked because of their\nstraightforward, familiar subjects. I am just looking for quick objective identifications.\nOne or more of your answers likely was on the order of \u2018George Washington crossing the\nDelaware,\u2019 \u2018a bald eagle\u2019 and/or \u2018a watch.\u2019\nThese answers are not objective, being formed in part by value judgments, aesthetic views\nand other personal biases.\nIn the lower left picture there is much more than a bald eagle. There is sky, clouds, ground,\nwater. The \u2018eagle\u2019 answer subjectively singles out one thing. Part of this is due to a personal\n151 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng: vAlues, Culture And AesthetICs In vIsuAl perCeptIon\nand cultural value judgment that a bald eagle is more important than the other objects.\nAnother reason is because the eagle is pictured large, clear and centered. If the picture\nshowed a tree close up and in focus and a small out of focus eagle flying in the distant\nbackground, your answer likely would have differed. Change in arrangement, size and focus\naffect the viewer\u2019s labeling, even when the identical objects are pictured.\nSimilarly, if your answer to the lower right picture was \u2018a watch,\u2019 you made an aesthetic\nand value judgment about what is and is not important. Placement and focus affected your\njudgment, along with your feeling that a potentially expensive watch is the center of attention.\nIn the top image there are quite a few people pictured. If you answered \u201cGeorge Washington\ncrossing the Delaware\u201d you singled out one as being the identity. This is in part due to a\nhigher value placed on George Washington, a famous figure in United States history. This\nis also due to your knowledge, as Washington is likely the only person you know by name.\nAgain, it is common to focus on the known and ignore the unknown.\nIf you said \u201cThis pictures a bunch of people, one whose name is George Washington\u201d you\nwould have given a broader answer, while acknowledging the extent of your knowledge.\n115522 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS leArnIng: vAlues, Culture And AesthetICs In vIsuAl perCeptIon\nAlso, notice that your answer was not \u2018sky, water and ice,\u2019 even though sky, water and ice\ntakes up more space than the men, boat and flag. This was due to your bias that the human\nis the natural center of attention.\nThe initial request of this chapter was to give objective identifications, but your answers\nwere subjective. I didn\u2019t ask for your moral judgment of George Washington versus other\nmen, whether a bald eagle is more significant than out of focus background trees or the\nrelative financial value of a watch.\nThese and other types of subjective judgments are both natural and essential to humans.\nQuick interpretations of scenes, including judging what is and is not important, is essential\nto getting through our day to day lives. You wouldn\u2019t have lasted long on this earth if you\nplaced equal visual significance on a twig on the pavement and a car speeding in your path.\nIf someone unexpectedly tosses you a ball, you catch the ball by focusing on it. If you focus\non the thrower\u2019s shoes or what\u2019s on TV, it is probable you will drop the ball.\nThe problem is that, while essential, this type of subjective identification helps make it\nimpossible to make objective identification. One\u2019s identification is always shaped by one\u2019s\nknowledge level, past experience, aesthetic view, pattern biases and value judgments. As\nshown with the identification of the three pictures, the human is often not aware of this\ninfluence. To many people, biases are what others have.\n153 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\n28 ART PERCEPTION: CONNECTING\nTO THE UNREAL\nChapters 28\u201333 look further at art and art perception, a topic that has already been touched\non throughout the book. Art is included as a largish section of this book because it is a major\narea of my study, a fascinating cognitive area, and because it covers many of the areas of\nhuman psychology, including language, expression, subjectivity, the subconscious, intuition\nand more. Art perception involve the concepts of this book applied to art.\n28.1 INTRODUCTION\nFigure 28.1 Fans feel a connection to cartoon characters, seeing them as if they\u2019re\nliving beings, following their lives, laughing at their jokes, feeling good when good\nthings happen to them and bad when bad things happen. Someone can feel closer\nto a cartoon character than a living, breathing next door neighbor.\n154 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nFigure 28.2 Many feel a human-to-human connection to the figure in\nthis Modigliani painting even though it clearly is not human in many ways.\nA complex and fascinating question is why do humans have such strong emotional reactions\nand human connections to unrealistic art? Why do viewers become scared, even haunted for\ndays, by a movie monster they know doesn\u2019t exist? Why do humans become enthralled by\ndistorted figures and scenes that aren\u2019t realistic? Why do viewers have emotional attachments\nto comic book characters?\n115555 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nThe answer lies in that, while humans know art is human made artifice, they decipher and\nperceive art using many of the same conscious and nonconscious methods that they use to\nperceive reality. Looking at how we view reality shows us how we view art, and looking at\nhow we view art helps show us how we interpret reality.\nWhile a full discussion of this topic would fill books, the following offers several aspects of\nour art perception. Food for further thought.\nArt ties into the earlier chapters on language, as art is a form of language and communication \u2013\na highly complex and esoteric form where the meaning and message are often unclear,\nemotional and subconscious.\n28.2 ART PERCEPTION IS IRRATIONAL\nPeople don\u2019t perceive art, or reality, on the entirely logical, rational or literal levels. Art\nis designed to communicate psychologically, aesthetically, sensually, viscerally, irrationally,\nsubconsciously, intuitively. Music is felt. Beauty and ugliness are psychological. Unreal\nthings, distorted figures, a fictional monster in a movie can strike a primordial chord in us\nthat our normal daily reality can\u2019t. A computer generated science fiction landscape can be\nperceived as beautiful.\nHumans have aesthetic reactions to many basic qualities including colors, shapes, angles and\nbalance whether the qualities are in the real world, dreams or in art. These qualities don\u2019t\njust symbolize feelings and evoke meaning in nature, they symbolize and evoke in abstract\nart and even a kitchen design.\nFigure 28.3 Even those who have never seen the 1922 silent vampire movie\nNosferatu get a psychological reaction from this still image. I don\u2019t have to\ntell you that isn\u2019t the tooth fairy climbing the stairs.\n156 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\n28.3 WE INTERPRET ART USING MANY OF THE COGNITIVE\nMETHODS WE USE IN THE REAL WORLD\nShape and form biases, imagination, comparison and the other cognitive methods discussed\nthroughout this book are used when we look at art.\nFigure 28.5 A sketch\nIn both nature and art, we subjectively pick out figures and patterns in ambiguous and\neven random information.\nFigure 28.6 Even though she has no legs, we perceive Mona Lisa as a whole person and not as\nsome freakish amputee. This mimics how we perceive a real person standing behind a fence or\nsitting behind a counter.\n157 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nFigure 28.7 Image from the movie Detour\nBoth in real life and when art viewing, humans focus on some information in a scene while\nbeing oblivious to other. The audience can get into a movie to a point they forget they are\nsitting in a theater and watching a projected image showing paid actors. This explains why\na movie shark can make jump the audience in a desert theater one thousand miles from\nthe nearest ocean.\n115588 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nFigure 28.8 The movie monster is a small man in a rubber suit. The surrounding even\nsmaller set and props make him appear big. If the set and props were many times larger,\nwe\u2019d perceive Godzilla as small as a mouse.\n28.4 SYMBOLS\nSymbols are an integral part of the human experience on many levels. A symbol is something\nthat represents something else, something larger. It is a shorthand, often to a complex idea.\nTo many, blue at the top of an abstract painting or kid\u2019s sketch represents sky, and green\nat the bottom represents grass or ground. A gold ring on the finger symbolizes marriage.\nShadows in a movie can symbolize danger and mystery.\nNot only can commonly known symbols be used in art to communicate ideas, meaning\nand mood, but this illustrates how humans don\u2019t need reality to communicate real ideas.\nSymbols literally aren\u2019t the thing they symbolize.\nLiterature, this paragraph you are reading, is a long series of symbols. The meaning isn\u2019t in\nthe symbols themselves, but what they evoke in your mind. I couldn\u2019t communicate many\nof the ideas in this book without these symbols.\nMuch of art is focused on stylizing symbols, making sentences sound a certain way, designing\nthat wedding ring to be attractive.\n159 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\n28.5 HUMANS MENTALLY ADAPT TO AND ACCEPT\nNEW AND ARTIFICIAL WORLDS\nThroughout our lives we learn new games, rules, languages, rituals, manners and fashion.\nIn art, we accept and adopt new musical styles, symbols, genres, conceits, artifices. Through\nrepetition and experience, artistic symbols, conceits and associations become more than\nconvenient intellectual devices. They become ingrained.\nFigure 28.9 Kids playing \u2018cowboys and indians\u2019\nOur perception of reality is formed by the conceits of art. Around the world people perceive\nthe Old West from Hollywood movies, even though historians will tell you those depictions\nare historically incorrect. People gain dubious perceptions of faraway places and peoples\nfrom sitcoms and action movies.\n28.6 EACH ART MEDIUM IS LIMITED IN WHAT\nIT CAN SHOW LITERALLY\nA painting or sketch doesn\u2019t have physical depth or movement. A silent movie doesn\u2019t have\nvoices even when the people on screen converse. The letters of a novel can\u2019t graphically\nshow a sunrise.\nThis means a medium must use artificial devices to communicate the literally undepictable.\n160 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nFigure 29.10 Movie subtitles so foreigners can know what is being said.\nFigure 28.11 Comic strips use panels to depict the passage of time, and\nwords and bubbles to depict talking.\n116611 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\n28.7 SPECULATION, PLAY ACTING, DAY AND NIGHT DREAMS\nAll humans speculate about the past, present and future, things that haven\u2019t happen, things\ncould have happened, things that might have happened. People wonder what their life\nwould have been like if they were born in a different family or time and place or with\ndifferent looks. Someone wonders how the conversation would have gone differently if he\nhadn\u2019t made that stupid remark. People ponder when they will die, what their life will be\nlike in the future. People wonder it\u2019s like to visit Iceland or live in Paris. Speculation is an\nessential part of human intelligence. Great inventions and human achievements arise from\nfrom speculation.\nHumans daydream, play act, dress up as different people, pretend they\u2019re different people,\nmimic others, act as if they are animals to amuse their kids, dress up in costumes for\nHalloween and masquerade balls, join Civil War recreation clubs, have imaginary in their\nhead conversations, practice speeches before imaginary crowds.\nIn our sleep we have strange and surreal dreams of impossible situations and lands and\nscenarios. Dreams can resonate and haunt us deeply. Dreams affect how we think and act\nin our daily lives.\nThe surreal situations, fictitious plots, made up characters and distorted figures of art go\nhand in hand with our normal dreaming, speculation, play acting lives. A novel may have\na made up plot and fictions characters, but our daily speculation and daydreams involve\nsimilar fiction. Science fiction is often a serious intellectual, if also entertaining, speculation\nof the future and space. A painting or movie may have a surreal landscape and bizarre\ncharacters, but so do our dreams. Much art is about dreams and daydreams.\n28.8 HUMANS KNOW AND FEEL THERE IS MORE THAN WHAT\nTHEY SEE AND CAN COMPREHEND, MORE THAN WHAT\nTHEY EXPERIENCE IN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES\nThey know people in a society hide their true thoughts and feelings. They know they\nthemselves have feelings and ideas that can\u2019t be put into words. They know there are concepts\nthey can only imagine.\nThe unrealistic, the impossible, the surreal, symbolism can evoke that which realistic art\nand our daily lives don\u2019t. Abstract patterns and wordless music can evoke secret memories,\nemotions and philosophical ideas that a photograph or neighborly chat cannot.\n162 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: ConneCtIng to the unreAl\nFigure 28.12 Munch\u2019s Scream\nA \u2018photorealistic\u2019 snapshot can reveal little about what the subjects think and feel, while an\nexpressionist painting can tell a lot.\nArt artificially manipulates the mind. The artist uses symbols, colors, shapes, wordplay and\nother techniques to play on the audience\u2019s psychology, subconscious. One significant point\nabout this is that it shows that the mind can be artificially manipulated.\nThat humans can be affected by the fake of art, the artificial \u2013 sometimes even more so\nthan reality \u2013 says something significant about the reliability of human aesthetic perception.\nHuman emotions and psychology being a direct path to identifying larger objective truths\nis at best a dubious notion.\nHumans have vague ideas, psychological inklings, about the mystery of the universe beyond\ntheir comprehension and life that they cannot fully explain. Art can point to these feelings,\npoint to the mysteries of the universe and to ourselves in different ways than other forms\nof expression.\nWhile not solving the major questions, it can perhaps give insight into them, into humans\nand the human condition of living in a universe where they cannot know the meaning or\nwhat is their purpose on earth or even if there one.\nArtworks are artifacts, showing how humans think and perceive, their physiological abilities\nand limitations, the questions they have, the human condition. Alien psychologists and\nscientists from the future would learn about humans from these artifacts.\n163 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ConCeIts And the lImItAtIons of Art\n29 CONCEITS AND THE\nLIMITATIONS OF ART\nAn art form (novel, rock song, painting, poem\u2026) is a form of language. The artist uses\nan art form as a means to communicate, or try to communicate, an idea or ideas to the\naudience. I use the word idea in a broad sense, ranging from factual idea to artistic meaning\nto feeling. I use the term audience to mean whoever is watching the movie, reading the\nbook, listening to the music or viewing the painting. An audience can be one million and\nit can be one.\nWithout getting into a debate about what is art, to be art the work must be profoundly\nbeautiful or sublime. Beauty and sublime cannot be translated into simple words, so I do\nnot attempt to define the words here.\nNot only is an art form made up and surrounded by a maze of conceits, but each form\nis itself a conceit. This means that art has both the practical benefits and the inherent\nlimitations of all conceits.\n116644 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ConCeIts And the lImItAtIons of Art\nAn artistic conceit can be deep, trivial, traditional, ephemeral, regional, worldwide, conflicting\nand so on.\nThe following are examples of artistic conceits. Notice that some aren\u2019t about the art itself\nbut how the art is presented.\n\u2022 The way a country music song is supposed to sound. What instruments are supposed\nto be used and what instruments should not be used. How the musicians should\ndress and move in a music video. What topics the lyrics should cover. What topics\nthe lyrics should not cover.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t tell me that you or others don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. If the cover for a\ntough guy American football star\u2019s autobiography was changed from dark blue to\npink, it would affect sales even though the text remained the same.\n\u2022 Say the Chicago Symphony comes to town and offers wonderful performances\nof Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony and Hayden\u2019s Water Music. Many in the audience,\nincluding perhaps the local newspaper critic, will be unable to get beyond the fact\nthat the orchestra dressed overly casual. The director in tank top and cutoff jeans.\nThe lead violinist in bathrobe and stocking feet. Some in the audience will demand\ntheir money back, the newspaper critic might spend half her review complaining\nabout the musicians\u2019 clothes.\n\u2022 When you go to an art museum, what should it look like inside? What should\nit not look like? What would be your reaction be if a show of Rembrandts had\nthe original, centuries old paintings displayed in funky neon green and day glow\nyellow frames?\n\u2022 In Western culture what art forms are generally considered more artistically significant\nthan others? Novel versus comic book, oil painting versus finger painting, television\nshow versus in theatre movie, classical music versus rock \u2018n roll, drama versus\ncomedy, violin versus banjo? Why?\nIn order to effectively communicate the essential artistic meaning, the artist must follow\nmost of the audience\u2019s conceits. This not only includes the deeper conceits but the shallow.\nTo have the audience focus on the intended meaning, the artist must be faithful to, or at\nleast take into consideration, most of the audience\u2019s expectations. Breaking a convention\nis a shock, a distraction. If the artist breaks all the conventions the audience will be too\ndistracted to focus on the meaning. If you turn a busy street corner and a nude man\npainted orange and walking a deer in a tuxedo asks you for directions to the library I bet\nyou won\u2019t comprehend the first sentence or two that comes out his mouth no matter how\nclearly he speaks.\n165 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS ConCeIts And the lImItAtIons of Art\nSimilarly, if you display a Rembrandt painting in a hot pink and lime green fuzzy frame\nwith flashing neon lights and dangling felt dice, don\u2019t be surprised if the gallery patron is\nunable to focus on the painting. If you want the patron to focus on the painting, you use\na frame that fits his or her expectations.\nArtists intentionally bend or break some conventions while following the others. They follow\nall the other conventions in order to focus the audience\u2019s attention on the intentionally bent\nor broken convention. I dare you to find a popular shock rock band that, while having a\ndisturbing twist, does not follow the majority of fashionable conceits, even those used by\nThe Kingston Trio and Sonny and Cher. What you intend to be shocking can\u2019t be shocking,\nor its shock value will be diluted to water, if the audience\u2019s attention is distracted by other\nthings. Totally bewildering is rarely as haunting as a perverse twist of the ordinary.\nThe juxtaposition of the unexpected with the expected, the abnormal with the normal,\nis a common artistic technique. Many movies spend the first portion of the work merely\nsetting up an artificial plot and setting to later subvert. How many monster movies start as\na normal everyday white picket fence story? How many thrillers start as an everyday guy\ngoing about his everyday business?\nThe theme and variation is a standard musical technique \u2013 altering the melody the second\nand third time around in a song or other work of music. In comparison to the remembered\ntheme, the altered variation produces a psychological, sometimes poignant effect for the\nlistener. Music can be plotted in a surprisingly similar way to a movie or novel.\nNo matter how shallow the conceits, the successful artist must use or at least address most of\nthe conceits of the audience. Successful art is compromise between the artist and the audience.\nIt is a communication and communication requires a common language. The artist may have\nradical things to say, but must communicate in a form the audience can understand. No\nmatter how profound the meaning, the novelist who ignores all the audience\u2019s expectations\nand sensibilities might as well write the book in a foreign language. Great artists are often\nkeenly aware that much of their artistic vision can never be communicated to others.\n166 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: presentIng old Art \u2018AuthentICAlly\u2019\n30 ART PERCEPTION: PRESENTING\nOLD ART \u2018AUTHENTICALLY\u2019\nSimilar to the problem with translating poetry is the problem in trying to present old works\nof arts in modern times.\nMany wish to present a Shakespeare play or Verdi Opera the way it was originally presented,\nand there are complaints about colorizing old black and white movies.\nAdvocates of original presentation often refer to a work of art presented in the original\nmanner as being \u201cauthentic.\u201d\nThere are a variety of problems in the presentation of old works. For example, the original\nwork or presentation can be unrealistic to its subject. Shakespeare\u2019s plays were written for\nand originally performed by male actors only. Juliet and Ophelia were performed by boys\ndressed as women. Even those who like the idea of original presentation prefer the inclusion\nof actresses, meaning they want a Shakespeare performance modernized.\n116677 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Art perCeptIon: presentIng old Art \u2018AuthentICAlly\u2019\nA similar case is where a grandfather clock chimes in Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar, yet the\ngrandfather clock had not yet been invented in Caesar\u2019s time. Some would argue that fixing\nthis historical error would make the play more historically authentic. Others would counter\nthat, while the grandfather clock clearly is a historical blooper, the play was intended as\na work of art not a historical document, and \u2018fixing\u2019 every detail could lessen the play\nartistically. They might point out that a Paul Cezanne painting of an apple is supposed to\nrepresent an apple not look like an apple photographed, and those who criticize the painting\nfor not being photorealistic miss the point.\nTechnical modernization can improve the audience\u2019s perception of an old work. Improved\ntechnology makes Gone With The Wind look and sound clearer in the theatre today than\nin 1939. It would be a safe bet that Paul McCartney prefers listening to The Beatles on a\nmodern digital device rather than on a 1965 record player. Listening to the 1965 record\nplayer is more authentic to a fan listening to the music on 1965 record player, but listening\nto the modern electronic device is more authentic to the music itself.\nI\u2019ll bet you that some old time Beatles fan has an unplugged vintage record player sitting on\ntop of a modern digital player. This way he gets the old time look and the modern sound.\nPresenting an old work must take into context the audience, its culture and sensibilities. A\nplay, movie, novel or painting is continually presented to a modern audience. The language\nof Shakespeare was the language of the original audience. It is not the natural language of\ntoday\u2019s audience. Today\u2019s audience experiences the play differently. The use of boy actors\nin female parts won\u2019t be viewed in the same way as an original audience viewed it. Boys\nplaying girls and women would at the least distract most in a modern audience.\nEven when presented \u2018authentically\u2019 (as originally presented), the modern audience won\u2019t\nperceive an old work of art authentically, as they won\u2019t experience it as the original (\u2018authentic\u2019)\naudience did. Ironically, making modernizations can make the modern audience\u2019s experience\ncloser to the original audience\u2019s experience. Making a work newer on one level can make\nit older on another.\n168 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\n31 TRYING TO MAKE 3D INTO 2D:\nTHE ILLUSION OF DEPTH IN ART\nThis shows challenges and dilemmas of representing reality in art, and, really, the challenge of\nrepresenting real things in any forms of symbolic language.\nFigure 31.1 This 1400s Raphael painting uses many techniques to give the\nsense of depth, including diagonal lines, diminishing scale, placing objects\ntop to bottom.\n31.1 OVERVIEW\nCreating the perception of depth in paintings, sketches and photographs is a challenge,\none that cannot be completely solved. This is because depth is three dimensional, while a\nsketch, photographic image or painting is two-dimensional. Three dimensional depth cannot\nphysically exist in two dimensions. If you hold a crystal clear family snapshot of the Grand\nCanyon in your hand, at least logically you know that distant cliff and cloud is not miles\nbehind your hand. You know it is just an image on the surface of a flat piece of paper.\nOver the centuries artists have developed techniques to create the representation of depth\nin 2D art. Before these techniques, paintings and sketches lacked any sense of depth. Cave\ndrawings appear primitive as the artists didn\u2019t understand the standard concepts of depicting\ndepth. A European painting from 100 AD shows objects in unreal proportions to each\nother. A mile away person may be the same size as a person two feet away.\n169 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\nThis chapter looks at a number of standard techniques used to give paintings, sketches\nand other 2D art the illusion of depth. These are techniques you can observe in art and\nincorporate into your own art. These are also \u2018techniques\u2019 you can observe in a real life, such\nas when looking at your living room or across your backyard. After all, the art is attempting\nto duplicate natural scenes like these.\n31.2 OVERLAPPING OBJECTS\nFigure 31.2 Overlapping objects in a Cezanne painting\n117700 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\nAn object appears to be in front of the object(s) it overlaps. Overlapping is the strongest\nindicator of relative distance, overriding all other signs when there is seeming conflict. In\nthe above Cezanne painting, the large center tree overlaps the \u2018distant\u2019 bridge, mountain\nand sky.\n31.3 DIMINISHING SALE\nWith things that are believed to be of same of similar size (2 cats or basketballs), the larger\nappears to be closer than the smaller. In the Cezanne painting, the viewer assumes that the\ntree is much smaller than the distant hills. Thus the difference in scale (tree taking up more\nspace than the hills) makes it appear as if the tree is closer. In the earlier Raphael painting,\nthe smaller people appear to be further away than the larger. This is because the viewer is\nunder the assumption people are of similar size.\n31.4 DIAGONAL LINES AND DIMINISHING SCALE\nAn exemplification of diminishing scale, diagonal lines moving towards each other as they\nmove up or down a painting or sketch give the illusion of depth. A real world example of\nthis is a straight road that becomes visually skinnier as it approaches the distant horizon.\nAnother example is standing at one end of an empty hallway and watching the lines where\nthe wall and floor meet visually move towards each other as they move to the other side\nof the room.\nFigure 31.3 This photo shows both\ndiagonal lines and diminishing scale\n171 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\n31.5 COLORS\nThough not a set rule, in art humans tend to perceive bright, warm colors like red, orange\nand yellow as being close, and dark, cool colors like blue and dark purple as being further\naway. This is particularly true for abstract art.\nFor landscapes, adding blue will make hills and mountains look more distant. The further away\nthe bluer. This is because the color changes as it goes through more and more atmosphere.\n31.6 BOTTOM TO TOP PLACEMENT\nBarring conflicting information, humans generally perceive what is at the bottom of painting\nto be in front, and what is at the top to be in the back. This is particularly true when\nlooking outside where there is no \u2018ceiling.\u2019\nFigure 31.4 Top to bottom: the bottom outside fans appear to be closer than fans and\nlights near the top. This is also an example of diminishing scale, with the bottom fans\nbeing larger than the top fans and, lights\nInside a building, the ceiling can have the opposite effect, with the ceiling area nearest you\nappearing higher than the ceiling area further away.\n172 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\nFigure 31.5 In this room, the floor appears to move up the further it gets away\nfrom you. The ceiling (which is sort of like an upside down floor) appears to move\ndown. These are both the produce of diminishing scale.\n31.7 FOCUS\nThings that are in focus tend to be perceived as closer than things that are out of focus.\nThis makes sense, as the words on a road sign are too blurry to read if too far away. You\nmust drive closer to the sign to read it.\n117733 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\nSimilarly, objects that have more intense color, detail and contrast often appear closer than\nobjects that are blurrier, hazier and having less focus.\nFigure 31.6 In this old photograph depth is shown by diminishing scale, the narrowing\nlines of the road and building tops, and that with distance things become blurrier\nand hazier.\n31.8 FINAL NOTES\nMany visual illusions manipulate these techniques. The illusions often use incongruous,\nlogically conflicting techniques to toy with our minds. One quality indicates one, while\nanother will evoke the opposite. One quality will evoke flatness, while another will evoke\ngreat depth. The discord produces an emotional reactions in the viewer. The illusion will\nappear \u2018impossible\u2019 or \u2018illogical\u2019 to the viewer.\nThe natural signs of depth can also fool us in the real world. Nature itself can give conflicting\nsigns\u2026 High in the mountains beyond the haze we are used to, climbers often misjudge\ndistance. The mountain miles away is clear and unhazy and appears much closer than it\nis. Climbers are often warned of this before the climb, as the illusion can be dangerous\u2026\nThings like houses appear larger and further away in heavy fog. It is the abnormal haziness\nand blurriness that fools us\u2026 In a movie, what appears as a full sized house or ship or\ndinosaur often is a miniature model. Carefully crafted sets make the things appear many\ntimes larger than they are\u2026. A person will appear shorter if photographed standing next\nto an extremely tall person\u2026. The moon appears larger when it is closer to the horizon\u2026\nGardens can be angled, planted and groomed to make them appear longer.\nA problem in trying to create realistic depth in two dimensions is that the human is designed\nto detect real depth not a flat representation. Looking at the real back yard, each eye looks\n174 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to mAke 3d Into 2d: the IllusIon of depth In Art\nat the 3D objects from a different angle, the head and body movement creating even more\nperspectives. The mind combines these different views into the mind\u2019s image.\nThis cannot be done with a two-dimensional object. With a still life painting, and even a\nstill life photograph, it is not possible for the eyes to get the different views of the apple\nthat is needed to perceive a truly 3D orange. The photograph, no matter how clear, shows\nonly one perspective.\nNotice that many attempts to create a closer to true 3D effect involve an alteration not just\nto the flat image but to the viewer\u2019s vision. 3D movies and pictures often require special\nglasses and viewers.\nThe hologram is a rare example of a flat image that can realistically simulate three dimensions,\neven allowing the viewer to see different sides of a pictured object.\n31.9 PICASSO AND CUBISM\nPicasso said he wasn\u2019t always trying to make a work that was beautiful \u2013 his focus was sometimes\non other qualities and things \u2013, and he considered the expected cliched commentaries about\nthe work\u2019s beauty, or lack thereof, to be missing the point.\nMany of his cubist works were trying to depict three dimensions in a two-dimensional\nplane \u2013 an aesthetic and philosophical dilemma that, really, exists in all two-dimensional\nartworks. Some of his cubist works tried to depict the passage of time in a still image \u2013\nanother interesting and unsolvable aesthetics problem that exists in all still art, even so-called\nrealistic art.\nI don\u2019t like Picasso on the \u2018pretty\u2019 level and wouldn\u2019t hang one on my wall, but his works\nbring up significant philosophic, aesthetic and cognitive science questions. All human\nperceptions and representations of reality are limited, distorted and filled with paradoxes,\nand his is just a different representation from a different informational angle. So-called\n\u2018realistic\u2019 art is filled with smoke and mirrors, tricks and visual illusions.\nIf one looks at a Picasso work as a philosophic thing, the question of \u201cIs it beautiful or\nnot?\u201d becomes \u201cIs whether or not it\u2019s beautiful a relevant question?\u201d Many artworks are\ntrying to express something other than beauty. Clearly, Munch\u2019s Scream is trying to express\nsomething other than beauty \u2013 and most would say it does a good job at it.\nFurther, it begs the question of \u2018Is it art?\u2019 a worthwhile question.\n175 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to defIne And lAbel Art\n32 TRYING TO DEFINE\nAND LABEL ART\nThis chapter shows how, just as with any human labelling and interpretation, defining and\ninterpreting art involves arbitrary rules and subjectivity, and, ultimately, there is no objective answer.\n32.1 TRYING TO DEFINE AND LABEL ART\nHow to interpret art?\nWhen you critique a movie, do you think it important what the director thought the movie\nwas about and what she was trying to do? When you read a book or look at a painting is\nit important for you to know the artist\u2019s intention? Have you ever made an interpretation\nof a work of art, later found out what the artist\u2019s was and found it different than yours?\nWhat was your reaction?\n117766 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to defIne And lAbel Art\nThese types of \u2018Which interpretation is correct?\u2019 questions touch on topics that have long\nhave been important in aesthetics.\nMany years ago the prominent literary school of thought was that the most important thing\nin interpreting and studying a book was the author\u2019s intent. This was later rejected, with\nan influential school of thought entirely dismissing the author\u2019s intention and saying all\nthat mattered was the reading of the text itself. Part of this rejection was because that no\none can reliably know the author\u2019s intent. Today, many scholars find both extremes, well,\nextreme and fall somewhere in the middle.\nA related school said that a work of literature was a reflection or representation of the\nauthor\u2019s biography. Others rejected this, in part because artists have imaginations, can make\nup things.\nAnother school said that art was to be judged by the audience\u2019s reaction to it. There is some\nvalidity to this in that art is a communication. It is intended to communicate ideas to the\nreviewer, viewer or listener. Others entirely rejected this idea, saying audience reaction was\nirrelevant, and a movie shouldn\u2019t be judged by the reaction of whichever random audience\nviewed it. Again, most people today reject the rigidity of both sides. Many think you can\u2019t\njudge art solely by audience reaction, but that it\u2019s relevant.\nAll these views beg the question of is there a correct way to interpret art? Is there even a\ncorrect way to determine which way is the correct way? Art itself is a human made up concept.\nIn the end, a definition of art is subjective and arbitrary.\nDoes it even matter whether or not something is labeled as art? Does labeling something\nas art change what it is?\nOur definitions and appreciation of art involve our personal philosophies about art and\neven politics and religion. People see different purposes for art. Some see art as personal\nexpression, others want it to support common social ideals and order. Some people want\nto be merely entertained, while others like to be challenged. Some are open to new ideas\nand experiences, while others judge art by how it reinforces their preconceived philosophies.\nSome require historical and factual accuracy in a movie, while others appreciate that facts\nare sometimes fudged for aesthetic purposes.\nArt and aesthetics are often used for social order. Dictators have glorifying statues and murals\nand set laws for what is acceptable art. Religions use art to promote their beliefs. Artists\nwho deviate from the aesthetic rules are often deemed as rebels and dangerous. Abstract\n177 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to defIne And lAbel Art\nand other modern art have often been labeled as degenerate by the powers that be. Society\npressures people to dress and style their hair in certain ways. People willingly dress to belong\nto or rebel against groups. How you dress says a lot about what you believe.\nReligious beliefs influence artistic form. In early Christian culture, the importance was given\nto the afterlife not life on earth. A result was the early Christian art was not realistic. On\nthe other hand, early Chinese religions were centered on nature and the early Chinese art\nhad greater focus on and realistic depictions of nature. By Islamic belief, artwork is flawed\ncompared to the work of God. It is thought that attempting to depict the realistic form of\nan animal or person is religious heresy. Thus Islamic art lacks realistic humans and other\nanimals, and is noted instead for its intricate and elaborate patterns and designs.\nFigure 32.1 Islamic design\nNever underestimate how much your taste in art and your philosophy and critiques of art,\nalong with your political, social and religious philosophies, are products of your personality\nand temperament.\nArt perception is both a psychological and an intellectual process, conscious and subconscious,\nlogical and emotional, and we often have conflicting and changing opinions about a work.\nWe naturally get an initial emotional reaction to a work of art \u2013 influenced by our natural\nand learned reactions to shapes, colors, textures, etc. Our impression of the work can change\nwith time. We consciously try to figure out what is going on, what is the point, how it is\nrelated to other works. Our appreciation and liking can change as we learn how it was made,\nwhat materials and techniques were used, as we hear others\u2019 views and ideas about the work.\nWe can like the artwork on one level but not another. We can appreciate the intellectual\npoint but dislike the aesthetics, or be attracted to the design and colors but find the artist\u2019s\nmessage trite. Our opinion of a work can flip flop back and forth, depending on which\nway we consider it.\n178 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS tryIng to defIne And lAbel Art\nI hate saying there is the heart and the head in art perception because, of course, the \u2018heart\u2019\nis in the mind. But, if I did, you\u2019d get the point. But I won\u2019t.\nWhat does it say vis a vis defining and identifying art that your enjoyment and appreciation\nof a work often changes viewing to viewing or listening to listening?\n32.2 ASSIGNMENTS\nAssignment #1: Answer the question: What is your personal definition of art?\nAssignment #2: Pick two works of art that you love or otherwise find profound and\nexplain why you love them or otherwise find them profound. The reasons can include it is\na genre or style you like. It could be due to the size or history. It could be due to what it\nmeans, the philosophy. If you connect to a character, it relates to your past or depicts your\nhometown, explain. If you aren\u2019t entirely sure why, say so.\nAssignment #3: What widely acclaimed art do you not like? Explain why. If it helps, the\nMona Lisa doesn\u2019t do much for me. And if you pressed me, I might say \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\nIt just doesn\u2019t. Give me a Botticelli any time.\u201d\nJust one thing the assignments demonstrate is that you can\u2019t fully explain the reasons behind\nwhat you like and dislike. You can love or hate a work and not be entirely sure why.\n179 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS logIC versus Art, fACts versus fICtIon In explAInIng hIgher IdeAs\n33 LOGIC VERSUS ART,\nFACTS VERSUS FICTION IN\nEXPLAINING HIGHER IDEAS\nThis chapter contrasts two ways of human thinking: intuition versus conscious logic.\nIn the 1985 movie Ladyhawke, two lovers were cursed, he to be a wolf at night and she to be\na hawk during day. They could not be human together.\nHumans perceive and interpret the world in many ways. Humans think of things rationally,\nirrationally, consciously, subconsciously, emotionally, intuitively, directly, indirectly, aesthetically,\nfiguratively, literally, \u2018from the head and from the heart\u2019 \u2013 in a varying combination of\nthese and more all at once. A human can think rationally one moment and be emotionally\nswept up by a song on the radio the next. Math professors fall head over heels in love and\nabstract painters calculate their taxes. A great movie is sometimes enjoyed on the intellectual\nand visceral levels.\n118800 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS logIC versus Art, fACts versus fICtIon In explAInIng hIgher IdeAs\nA human\u2019s best possible exploration, understanding and expression of the universe use all\nthe levels. An interpretation of the universe through only mathematics or only music is\ninherently limited. Many things in the world can\u2019t be explained with mathematics \u2013 love\nand beauty for examples \u2013, just as mathematics can\u2019t be explained with love and beauty.\nAn explanation using just one level is flawed.\nThis chapter touches on two standard and distinct ways humans try to explain and study\nthe complex world: the rational/factual essay and art. One is based on reason and logic\n(rational/factual explanation). The other has its meaning in the irrational (art). Each is a\nworthwhile method of communication yet limited and different in what it can express.\nRational explanation\nHumans often find it important to explore subjects and ideas logically and with unbiased\nfacts. A rational fact-based essay uses reason and, well, logic. It tries to remove emotion,\nwhims, logical fallacies, subjectivity and, except when clearly identified as such, the author\u2019s\nopinion. The language of a logical essay or book itself is expected to be free of logical\nfallacies and linguistic muddiness.\nLogical essay\nIn proofing the logical essay, the writer and proofreader make sure that statements are\nconsistent. As statements are built upon statements, even small logical fallacies can undercut\nthe entire essay.\nThe following are examples of checking the logic of statements.\nStatement #1: \u201cJenny has only one brother. Thus, her brother has only one sibling.\u201d\nAnalysis of statement #1: Incorrect, should be rewritten. If Jenny has a sister, then the\nsecond statement would be untrue, as John would then have more than one sibling. While\nJohn may indeed only have one sibling, the first sentence does not prove the second.\nStatement #2: \u201cJenny\u2019s favorite type of fruit over all other fruit is the orange. Thus, the\nbanana is not her favorite fruit.\u201d\nAnalysis of #2: The statement is logically correct.\n181 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS logIC versus Art, fACts versus fICtIon In explAInIng hIgher IdeAs\nArt\nOpposed to the logical essay, the essential meaning of art is based in irrationality. While a\nwork of art has an underlying and often even logic-related structure, the essential meaning is\nirrational \u2013 sublimeness, profound beauty, aesthetic taste, emotional response. Art produces\na profound psychological, sometimes visceral effect on the audience and it is here where\nthe meaning exists.\nThis irrational meaning is illustrated by the wordless music you love. There is nothing\nlogical or rational in the sounds or the emotional reaction you get from them. The aesthetic\nexperiences exist beyond reason.\nArt\nArtists intentionally subvert logic, reason, objectivity and reality to produce the desired\npsychological effect in the audience.\nMany paintings intentionally distort reality. Look at paintings by Picasso, Dali, Cezanne,\nJackson Pollock and Renoir. Even the \u2018realistic\u2019 paintings of the 1300s have impossible\ndimensions, odd looking humans and made up visual stories. Classic movies and novels have\nunreal plots, characters, timing and effects. Some are fairy tales and some are science fiction.\nTo produce the desired emotions in the audience most movies have music soundtracks.\nIn real life many of the scenes portrayed would have no full symphonic accompaniment.\nWashington crossing the Delaware, man lost alone in the middle of the desert, Humphrey\nBogart walking a deserted street. Most movie music is a calculated distortion of reality for\npsychological purposes.\nIsn\u2019t there something bizarre about musical accompaniment for a National Geographic\ndocumentary about insects? What does synthesizer or orchestral arrangement have to do\nwith ants? The answer is it has nothing to do with ants, and everything to do with the\naudience\u2019s psychology.\nArt is so different than the real world that its truth is derived from lies. Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet\nis made up. Of Mice and Men is a figment of John Steinbeck\u2019s imagination. Picasso once\nsaid, \u201cArt is a lie that tells the truth.\u201d\nAn irreconcilable conflict exists between art and the rational essay. One requires rationality\nand the other involves irrationality. Each subverts the other.\n182 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS logIC versus Art, fACts versus fICtIon In explAInIng hIgher IdeAs\nLogic\nAn inherent problem with the rational factual essay is that, despite the author\u2019s intentions,\nit can never be free of the things the author wishes it to be free of \u2013 subjectiveness,\nirrationalness and arbitrariness.\nThe author has personal taste about writing style, structure, pacing and overall presentation.\nA writer can\u2019t write or think without using a plethora of conceits, some chosen, some\nnonconscious, some inborn. A writer can\u2019t visualize things in his mind without biases,\npersonal and cultural ways of grouping, labeling and conceptualizing. Writers take into\nconsideration the conceits of the audience, as the point of the essay is to communicate.\nEven the seemingly perfectly logical equation 1 + 1 = 2 demonstrates human taste in the\n1\nspacing, balance, linearity, colors. Many would rewrite \u201c1 + = 2\u201d as \u201c1 + 1 = 2.\u201d The\nequations mean the same thing, so the reason for the change is aesthetic.\nPure mathematicians will be the first to tell you that math can be beautiful and ugly, and\nthat their research is influenced by aesthetics. In practice, human logic and philosophy have\ntheir own art.\n118833 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS logIC versus Art, fACts versus fICtIon In explAInIng hIgher IdeAs\nFacts versus aesthetics in a biography\nThe subject of the biographical movie or book is or was flesh and blood, a life filled with\nmeasurable facts, dates, times, durations, amounts, heights, geography, quotes, test scores,\nemployment records, mailing addresses. Yet a strict recitation of facts will not wholly represent\nthe person and her life, much less engage the audience. A person is much more than facts\nand dates. Character, personality, aesthetic vision (perhaps the subject was a great artist),\nbeliefs, faiths, mental conflicts, contradictions, urges, dreams, fears, subjective experiences,\nnonconscious, desires.\nA famous composer might say, \u201cIf you want to know who I am, listen to my music. That\u2019s\nall you need.\u201d A woman might say, \u201cIf you want to know about me, forget about my high\nschool transcript and the conversations I have with my boss. Watch my favorite movie. If\nyou don\u2019t get the movie, you\u2019ll never understand me.\u201d Her favorite movie probably was made\nby someone she never met, perhaps who died before she was born, the movie isn\u2019t about\nher, perhaps takes place in a country or even planet she\u2019s never been too and may not have\na single character that resembles or acts like her or even speaks her language.\nEven when distorting facts and logic and time, a biography that is a work of art can, at\nleast in a way, be a better representation of the subject, his deeper personality and vision.\nThis type of biography is an aesthetic or psychological representation of the person, as a\nCezanne painting is a figurative representation of a landscape. Cezanne didn\u2019t intend or\nexpect for the viewer to take the painting literally.\nThe essential problem in the biography is that to create this psychological representation,\none must distort the literal truth. And to tell the literal truth, one destroys this aesthetic\ntruth. The biographer needs the two to exist together, but they cannot.\nThis conflict is an example that shows how there are things beyond our intelligence and\nconsciousness, and that we are trying to understand them using sparse and too limited\nof tools. We are looking at something from different narrow views, with the views giving\ndifferent, conflicting ideas.\nThere is also the unanswerable question of if the conflict is an indication that the unified\ntruth is beyond our understanding or if there is no single truth. Humans have a bias towards\nwanting a unified truth \u2013 a single model or theorum to explain everything--, but perhaps\nthere are multiple truths. Perhaps there are many different truths, some or all that conflict\nwith each other. Perhaps there is no meaning(s) or truth(s), and, like \u2018art,\u2019 those terms are\nmerely human conceptions \u2013 and that\u2019s why humans can\u2019t find \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cmeaning.\u201d\nNo matter how hard you think, you won\u2019t be able to answer these questions. They are\nbeyond the limits of our minds.\n184 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HUMANS AREN\u2019T TOTALLY OR EVEN PRIMARILY ABOUT\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS FINDING TRUTH AND FACTUAL ACCURACY\n34 HUMANS AREN\u2019T TOTALLY OR\nEVEN PRIMARILY ABOUT FINDING\nTRUTH AND FACTUAL ACCURACY\nWhile identifying facts and making accurate perceptions are important parts of the human\nfunction and survival, the human mind is not entirely about this or perhaps even mostly\nabout this.\nTo survive and function, the human must do other things such as act and guess in ambiguous\nand mysterious situations. Many of these things are not about identifying facts and assessing\ntruth, but making speedy and practical decisions. In fact, humans are in part hard-wired\nto make speedy intuitive decisions in the face of lack of knowledge.\nAs an example I use way too often, avoiding instant danger is often about how to react to\nthe unknown and unknowable. If a mysterious large shape is moving quickly at you, taking\nthe time to accurately identify the shape (\u2018gathering the facts\u2019) is the opposite of what you\nneed to do. Get out of the way asap, then worry about identification later. And this is the\nnatural and automatic subconscious self-preservation instinct of humans. This is just one\nexample of how truth finding is not always the priority of the mind and, in fact, can get\ninhibit function.\nSurvival is commonly said to be about erring on the side of safety\u2013 as it takes only one\ntime being hit by a speeding car or falling off a cliff to be dead\u2013 and the key word there\nbeing \u2018erring.\u2019 In this case, the mind is designed to err.\nAs shown in earlier chapter the human mind has limited capacity and capabilities and\nhuman function can be inhibited by too much information and even truths. If your task\nis to move across a room (or do any other mundane moment to moment task), trying to\nidentify and learn the history and \u201ctruth\u201d of everything and everyone in the room would\nlead to you dying of old age before you reach the other side.\n185 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS judgIng the relIAbIlIty of your mInd\n35 JUDGING THE RELIABILITY\nOF YOUR MIND\nTo us humans, the reliability of the human mind cannot be known, because we use the\nhuman mind to test and judge the reliability. If your goal is to determine the accuracy of\nthe human mind, that means you do not know the accuracy of the tool used for testing\nand judging (the human mind), which makes it impossible to determine the accuracy of\nthe human mind.\nYour opinion about the reliability of the human mind involves a leap of faith. A common\ntendency is to overestimate the reliability. There are a number of reasons for this. One\nis that many cognitive errors and blind spots are unknown and not counted. Another is\nthat a human\u2019s belief system and worldview are premised on a reliable mind. If the mind\u2019s\nreliability comes into question, so does the reliability of the belief system and worldview.\n118866 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN THE HUMAN AS SOCIAL ANIMAL: GROUP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, ETC.\n36 THE HUMAN AS SOCIAL\nANIMAL: GROUP PSYCHOLOGY,\nSOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, ETC.\nThis chapter looks at how being a social animal influences the mind and thinking.\nWhile this book tends to focus on individual minds, humans are social, group animals by\nnature. Not only do humans exist and functions in social groups, but our minds are molded\nby strong social-related feelings \u2013 love, lust, loneliness, competitiveness, etc. Our minds are\nmolded by the experience and education of culture, language, social rules, other people. In\nfact, there are such things as group minds, or large minds made up of a combination of\nindividual minds. Universities, companies, think tanks and social groups are examples of\ngroup minds, pooling together and organizing individual minds for greater function and\nsuccess. An individual human mind itself is made up of many parts working together, and\nsometimes conflicting with each other.\nAs with the individual human, human groups use conceits, attention and ignoring, information\ndistortion, etc. in order to function as desired.\nAs following the rules of the game is necessary for a group to function, a key for a group\nis to get its members to follow the written and unwritten conceits. This is done through\ngetting the members to believe in the conceits, force (laws, penalties), peer pressure,\neducation, culture, etc. As humans are creatures of habit, repetition (cultural norms) often\nleads to acceptance. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done it,\u201d is a powerful force on human\nactions and thought.\nRealize that many of a group\u2019s rules are arbitrary, even silly. This can include fashion rules,\nsuch as the school colors or the office requirement that men wear that odd strip of cloth\ncalled a tie. Through tradition, school culture, repetition and peer pressure, students and\nalumni become psychologically attached to the school colors. Alumni will tell you they bleed\nthe maize and blue of the University of Michigan or the cardinal and white of Stanford.\nThere will be student riots on the Ann Arbor campus if the University decides to change\nthe colors.\nAs with the individual, suppression and distortion of information is required for a group\nto function. Sometimes the distortion is done by leaders and sometimes by members. The\n187 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN THE HUMAN AS SOCIAL ANIMAL: GROUP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, ETC.\nfollowing are examples. With some of these examples you will think the suppression and\ndesired result are bad. For others you will think they are good.\n\u2022 Before Christmas dinner, Grandma has feuding family members agree to not talk\nabout certain subjects at the table for the sake of a peaceful holiday. God knows\nhow speaking one\u2019s mind ruined Thanksgiving.\n\u2022 For the sake of family harmony and happy childhood, parents may tell their adopted\nchild that she is their biological daughter. They may explain away her different\nfeatures by saying a distant relative looked similar. The girl may live a happy life\nbelieving she is the biological daughter.\n\u2022 It is likely your parents kept family information secret from you.\n\u2022 Most movies don\u2019t give away the ending at the beginning. The audience knows\nand appreciates this.\n\u2022 In their print and television ads for a new movie, a studio will list the good reviews\nand not the bad. A car manufacturer will promote the best aspects of its car but\nnot of cars by the competition.\n\u2022 Vladimir Lenin intensely disliked Joseph Stalin and did not want Stalin to become\nthe ruler of the Soviet Union. Following Lenin\u2019s death, Stalin helped cement his\npower by producing propaganda that Lenin was fond of Stalin. Movies were made\nshowing Stalin and a Lenin look-a-like hanging out like best buds. During Stalin\u2019s\nrule, a Soviet citizen could get in big trouble for saying what were Lenin\u2019s true\nfeelings about Stalin.\n\u2022 Many will act to prevent a study that intends to objectively compare the mental\ncapacities between races. Even if the information will be accurate and unbiased, people\nfrom many different races and political backgrounds will wish to abort the study.\n\u2022 In literature class, the teacher prevents students from discussing physics, economics\nand gossip.\n\u2022 With the intention of preventing kids from using illegal drugs, many anti-drug\ncampaigns use propaganda. If drug usage is lowered, the campaigns will consider\nthe factual distortion to have been worthwhile, and will do it again.\nA group\u2019s design is primarily concerned with performance not full disclosure or knowledge\nof the truth. As with Stalin\u2019s \u201cLenin loved me\u201d campaign, labeling falsehoods as truths is a\nstandard technique to gain loyalty from members, and is, in fact, this forced lying is part\nof the design.\nAll large groups require insincerity from their members. Insincerity is the glue that holds\na society together. The insincerity includes people saying things they don\u2019t really believe,\nand things they often know the people they are talking to don\u2019t believe. The earlier family\nThanksgiving dinner at Grandma\u2019s involved ignoring topics that were on everyone\u2019s mind.\n188 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN the humAn As soCIAl AnImAl: group\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS psyChology, soCIAl IntellIgenCe, etC.\nThis alone illustrates that a society is not about full truth and that a search for truth requires\nleaving society.\nWhen constructing a group, one will try to choose a structure and rules that will produce\nthe desired results. This means the first thing to do is to decide what are the desired results.\nTo achieve the same or similar results, different structures can be used. If two groups differ\nfrom each other in say culture or age or temperament, different structures may be required\nto achieve the same results. For example, creating the rule that the winner of an academic\ncompetition will be awarded season tickets to the opera will work as incentive with opera\nfans, but not with others. Many others will consider opera tickets incentive to lose.\nFor the society you live in, what are the changes you think are important (lower crime,\nethnic harmony, better educational system, other), and what type of structure, conceits and\ninformation distortion would you pick to try and achieve these results?\nHumans regularly suppress truth seeking and truth telling to accommodate group achievement\nand cohesiveness.\n118899 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN THE HUMAN AS SOCIAL ANIMAL: GROUP\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, ETC.\nSports teams often involve giving up individual achievements for the greater team success.\nSuccessful organizations have heads who know how to integrate people with different\ntalents and personalities. Our perceptions of reality are in part formed by the society and\nculture in which we live. Your thought process regularly involves social thoughts \u2013 love,\nlust, thoughts about other humans, relationships. Human survival, function and thriving\nare based on groups. We don\u2019t do it alone. Our societies, knowledge and inventions are\nmade as groups. Our scientific knowledge is based the shoulders of previous scientists.\nAnthologies and textbooks are the sum of individual writers and universities involve a\ncollection of intelligent and learned people working in specific areas. Television shows and\nmovies are made by groups of people. Our language allows us to communicate knowledge\nand technology to each other, including over time.\nMany of our automatic subconscious feelings are socially related \u2013 wariness of strange groups\nof people, stereotypes, attraction to certain people, crowd following, wariness of speaking\nin front of groups, etc.\nAnd in many ways a human mind is based on group function like this. As shown, it is\nmade of different components doing different tasks, but working together to come with\nperceptions and judgments.\nEarly economists made the fatal mistake of basing their models on the assumption that\nhumans act entirely rationally when making economic decisions. Later economists realized\nthe models had to be thrown out, because they learned that humans do not act entirely\nrationally when purchasing, selling, investing, valuating and saving.\nSwarm intelligence\nSwarm intelligence is where large groups of animals exhibit a group intelligence and\ncapability much larger than any of the individual animals exhibit or are even aware of.\nExamples include small fish and birds that unconsciously and instinctually form large groups\nthat protect themselves from predators (essentially forming one large animal), ant groups\nthat gather food in long lines and termites that build giant, intricate homes. Each of the\nanimals does a very simple minded task in its own immediate surroundings (a fish in a\nschool will swim a certain distance from surrounding fish) and is unaware of the groups\u2019\noverall structure and capability. Computer scientists employ artificial swarm intelligence to\ntry and come up with structures and answers to difficult questions.\nEconomics is one area where the human species exhibits swarm logic. Other examples of\nherd behavior and group intelligence include demonstrations, riots and fashion fads. Stock\n190 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN the humAn As soCIAl AnImAl: group\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS psyChology, soCIAl IntellIgenCe, etC.\nmarket fads and bubbles are examples where humans irrationally and emotionally follow\nherd mentality.\nSwarm intelligence begs the question of if there are swarm intelligence and group functions\nthe human species are doing that they are not consciously aware of.\nIt also begs the question of if individual consciousness is as important as humans say it is,\nbecause we could be doing something higher and more intelligent than we are conscious\nof. Consciousness and awareness are things people aspire to, but perhaps they are nothing\nmore than a quaint and relatively minor quality in the big picture of group intelligence and\ngroup minds. That humans want to be in the know, may just be a sentiment.\n119911 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS Inborn survIvAl drIves\n37 INBORN SURVIVAL DRIVES\nThis chapter touches on how the need to survive and function influences the mind and\nsubconscious thinking.\nMuch of the human\u2019s psychological, neurological and biological reactions, which all intermingle,\nare hard-wired and allowed the species to function, survive and thrive since the old days.\nHumans have hardwired psychology that was useful to survive in caveman days, but is often\nuseless and even detrimental today. Our great desire to eat food right away was essential to\nsurvival in days of food scarcity, but leads to obesity and health problems in today\u2019s time\nof cheap and plentitude.\nIn the old days of survival, sticking with one\u2019s small tribe and being suspicious of a new\ngroup of people that looked and dressed differently was important, but manifests itself in\nmodern times as bigotry, xenophobia and high school cliques.\nThe biological drives, emotions and sensibilities are part of all human conception. Our\ngreatest literature, philosophy, art, religion, conception of morality, right and wrong is fused\nwith these urges and biases about love, lust, beauty, hunger, food and drink, perception of\nlight and dark. This is how we think and it colors everything human.\nHuman morality is hardwired self-preservation psychology. It serves a similar self-preservation\nfunction as love, fear and the others.\nRealize that other animals have different functioning and survival situations \u2013 life duration,\nfood/ biological/ reproduction needs, live in different geographies, have different senses \u2013, and\ntheir \u201cmorality\u201d will be different. Humans think their biological functions and morality are\nsuperior and \u201chigher,\u201d but it is a just a biological and psychological thing needed for survival.\n192 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS summAry And fInAl notes\n38 SUMMARY AND FINAL NOTES\nThe key points of this book were, one, to show how the human mind and senses work:\nHow the mind processes sensory information and comes up with perceptions, judgments,\netc. And, two, to show the limits of the human mind vis a vis these information processes.\nThe human mind has many physical and biological limits to gaining knowledge. This\nincludes its finite space in time and geography, and that even our vision has margins of\nerror and illusion.\nTo function and survive, the human mind is designed to make speedy practical judgments\nfrom the limited and ambiguous information of its environment. The mind does a good job\nat this, but is still making guesses and so there is an inherent margin of error. Sometimes\nhuman guesses are correct, while other times they are off \u2013 as demonstrated by optical illusions.\nThe human mind has many methods, or shortcuts, for making speeding perceptions and\ndecisions in the face of ambiguous information. These include shape and form biases,\nimagination, and comparisons. These methods are useful, but involve arbitrariness, biases,\nsubjectivity, margins of error, and can result in illusions and errors in perception.\nMany of the methods and reactions are automatic and subconscious. The human is unaware\nof them happening and often can\u2019t even correct them.\nThe human perception and judgment are subjective, formed and biased by experience, point\nof view, physiological abilities and disabilities, psychological drives. Intuition, emotional and\naesthetic perceptions and reactions are important to human function and thinking, and are\nimportant knowledge, but are still subjective.\nDespite popular perception, the human mind is designed for practical function not finding\nof truths. Practical function involves suppression and distortion of information. Attention\nis just one example of how humans must distort and suppress information to focus and\nfunction. Self deception and hiding information from itself are important parts of function\nand the human mind sis good at at both.\nSymbolic language is a key to human practical success, but distorts, colors and limits\nperception. It is a way to translate information and model ideas for practical purposes, but\nall translations are just that: translations.\n193 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS summAry And fInAl notes\nHumans often have conflicting opinions and points of view. Some topics are beyond human\ncomprehension and humans use irreconcilable mental methods, say emotions versus logic,\nto understand them.\nHuman thoughts are influenced and biased by evolutionary thinking. This thinking is\nimportant to survival and function, but make human thought biased. People mistake\nprimordial urges for objective, universal truths.\nWhile scientists, and this book, often focus on the errors that are produced by human\ncognitive methods, the methods can also be considered excellent devices for making quick\nand needed choices in the complex and ambiguous environment humans live in.\nSure our cognitive systems can be wrong and sometimes make comically off judgments \u2013\nand this book has likely opened your eyes to much of this \u2013, but, all things considered,\nthey are quite effective and efficient. Don\u2019t forget that humans cognition is about making\neducated guesses in brand new situations and with limited information. It would be foolish\nto expect one hundred percent accuracy.\n119944 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS summAry And fInAl notes\nArtificial intelligence scientists trying to make their own working human-like robots are\nastonished to learn at how advanced and sophisticated the human subconscious is at doing\nsuch simple tasks. They\u2019ve learned it is beyond difficult to design a robot to navigate quickly\nthrough a room of furniture. Yet, this is a simple task for even a four year old human of\nnormal intelligence. Scientists will tell you that, even with all its faults and limitations,\nthe human mind, including at the intuitive level, is the most intellectually sophisticated,\nadvanced and complex entity known.\nHumans have long tried, and in many ways, to expand their consciousness. This includes via\nfact finding \u2013 science, knowledge \u2013, mysticism, religion, meditation and even experimental\ndrug taking. The future envisions artificial intelligence, transhumanism and cyborgs (see\nlater chapters).\nPsychologists and mystics say that much of our subconscious intuitive knowledge is untapped\nand contains important, if subjective, knowledge. Even scientists such as Einstein and Richard\nFeynman extolled the virtues of intuition and imagination. Though Feynman said that\nthese had to be double checked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter how smart you are. If it doesn\u2019t agree with experiment, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Both Einstein\nand Feynman were firm believers in right brain and left brain thinking, rather than either/or.\nNo doubt the expansion of the mind involves many things, using many parts of the brain\nart, science, intuition, logic, emotions. Discovering one\u2019s biases and delusions, such as\ndetailed in this book, is essential. Confucius said \u201cReal knowledge is knowing the extent\nof one\u2019s ignorance.\u201d\nBut, no matter how much you expand your knowledge and use both sides of your brain,\nthere will always be unresolvable cognitive conflicts. In short, expansion of the mind, intellect\nand consciousness are very much possible, possible for you, but many things, including the\nmeaning of the universe, are simply beyond the capabilities of the human mind.\nThis book does not offer a simple summarizing theory or final one paragraph conclusion\nneatly telling you how the mind works. There is much to be researched, both at the macro\nand micro levels, and much is beyond our comprehension. There are unanswered and\nunanswerable questions. You are welcome to read more, come up with your own ideas and\ntheories, think for yourself, examine your own perceptions. Just realize that your thinking\nand researching on these subjects involves cognitive biases and illusions, just as does our\nperception of reality. And even when reading this book, and thinking about this subject,\nyou cannot escape all your illusions and cognitive biases. Philosophers and scientists can\nno more escape their psychology than they can escape being humans.\n195 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS book enCompAssIng questIons\n39 B OOK ENCOMPASSING\nQUESTIONS\n1) What is the computational theory of mind?\n2) Do all people think the human mind works like a computer?\n3) What is \u2018attribution substitution\u2019?\n4) How are misperceptions, or optical illusions, caused by shape, form and pattern\nbiases?\n5) What is aleatory narrative?\n6) Why can\u2019t a mind determine its own accuracy or reliability?\n7) Why must humans limit or distort information in order to function?\n8) What is an optical illusion?

The reader\nshould have a broader view. It is good to start by focusing on human minds, your mind,\nbut it is important for the reader to remove their blinders and think about other minds,\nquestion human assumptions.\nThe final pages briefly look at other minds, including non-human animal, artificial intelligence\nand beyond, and bring up some unanswered and unanswerable philosophical topics about\nthe nature of intelligence, morals and the models of theoretical minds. Thinking about\nother minds and other ways of thinking and perceiving is important, and helps reflect upon\nhuman minds, human ways of thinking and assumptions we have.\nAs with the earlier pages of this book, there are major areas of continuing study and\nthought, and these last pages are introductory notes and food for further thought, discussion\nand reading.\nHumans are naturally self-centered and myopic and tend to think the human conception of\nthe world is the correct conception, the human way of thinking is the correct way, human\n119988 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS thInkIng About other mInds\nsenses are more important than others senses, human tastes, aesthetics and sensibilities are\nthe most important and what correctly define or mirror the universe.\nHumans have long used such phrases as \u201cThese truths are self evident.\u201d\u2026\u201cWe hold these\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their\nCreator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit\nof Happiness.\u201d \u2013 From the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence\nNice and honorable sentiments and goals perhaps, but there is no evidence, other than faith\nand human self-centeredness, that they are true.\nBut there are other ways to think, other methods to process information, other information\nthat human senses don\u2019t detect Our view of the universe and ourselves, in particular of our\nself importance, is based on unprovable assumptions.\nThis book has shown that human perception and judgment are limited, involves biases,\nsubjectivity, regular errors and cognitive Catch-22s. The chapter on the psychology of numeral\nsystems likely demonstrated that there are different ways of conceptualizing and representing\nthings that you had never even thought of \u2013 and your learned way isn\u2019t the only way.\nThere are different, perhaps better ways to process information. Certainly, our methods of\nthinking and sensing can be improved upon, from studying and correcting many of our\nbiases and errors to getting better eyeglasses. Why can\u2019t there be legitimate other methods\nof thinking, perhaps even superior ones? Why are our methods of information processing\nautomatically the \u2018correct\u2019 ones?\nThis blind self-centeredness to our way of thinking is natural, both because our view and\nour way of thinking are all we know and because accepting of our views and biological\nways of thinking are important to functioning, survival and the need for speedy decision\nmaking. Function requires conceits. Having a faith in a belief, even if it is wrong, is often\nimportant and even essential to functioning.\nAlways remember that function and knowledge are in competition with each other, and in\nways mutually exclusive. This is even true in artificial intelligence.\n199 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS non-humAn AnImAl mInds\n2 NON-HUMAN ANIMAL MINDS\nNon-human animals view the universe using different and sometimes more advanced senses\nthan humans. They have different functions and lives \u2013 living in the dark, different geographies\nincluding the Antarctic and underwater, different food and mating requirements, longer or\nshorter lives, etc. They have different ways to survive and function, live with different tastes\nand needs \u2013 so their perception, sensibilities, view of the world will be different.\nHumans study the behavior and minds of non-human animals and have been surprised at\nhow advanced and efficient they can be, even by human terms.\nCrows have a famous ability to count.\nFor scientists who study animal minds and intelligence, a big area of focus is how they\nnavigate over large spaces, such as when hunting and returning home. Some lower level\nanimals use simple \u2018robotic\u2019 methods, such as taking the exact same trail to and from, being\nable to recognize their home or landmark along the way and automatically moving towards\nit, or following a laid down scent. However, there is a spider that each time greatly changes\nits to and from travel to better sneak up on prey, and scientists realized it had a much more\nadvanced system than they anticipated.\nAn animal behavior professor said he could ask two dolphins he studied to do a spontaneous\nand unique water routine. The dolphins would swim together underwater and jump out\nof the water and do novel twisting and flipping movements in complete unison. Humans\nhave yet to figure out how they do that. There\u2019s a mysterious form of communication going\non there.\nAnimal behavior researchers have determined that a dog can identify an animal as a dog,\neven though, through human breeding, dogs come in an extremely wide variety of shapes,\nsizes, forms, colors and looks.\nIn particular considering the difficulty humans have understanding their own minds, there\nare many practical and philosophical problems in trying to understand other animal minds. A\nhuman can\u2019t even be sure he or she understands everything another human thinks and feels.\nWe can never read non-human animal minds, and truly know what they are thinking and\nfeeling. Further, much non-human animal thought and action are based on senses and/or\nranges of senses that we don\u2019t have. A rattlesnake can see infrared light and a goose can see\nultraviolet light that we can\u2019t see. Owls see and bats hear well in the night that is \u201cdark\u201d to\n200 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS non-humAn AnImAl mInds\nhumans. Humans simply can\u2019t know or conceptualize how animals see, perceive and think\nusing these senses.\nHumans study and judge non-human animal minds using human thought processes and\nsensory biases. Humans can only see and think about things in human ways. We try to\nthink as other animals think, see through their eyes, but it is always filtered through our\nforms of thinking.\nKeep in mind how much human sensibility, aesthetics, judgment of truth and morality,\nperception, intuition are influenced and formed by our sensory abilities, aesthetic tastes\nand inborn biological and social drives. Due to their different senses, biological and social\nfunctions, and methods of processing information, animals will have a different view,\nsensibility and aesthetic view of things.\nThings that humans naturally find beautiful, other animals do not. Flies are attracted to feces\nand dead animals that repulse us. Sharks are not scared of deep, open water. We cannot be\ncertain what aesthetic perceptions animals have.\nBees can see colors and there is a use in being able to see the colors (finding flowers). Do\nthey get an aesthetic experience from the colors? If so, what is it like? We can never know.\nThis points out the narrowness of human thought. Our thought is formed by our limited\nsensory abilities and many of our conceptions and rules for right and wrong, moral and\nimmoral are nothing more than aesthetic tastes, emotional reactions, primordial emotional\ndrives and biological needs of our particular species.\n201 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\n3 CREATING OTHER MINDS:\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\u201cWill computers ever think like humans?\u201d \u201cNot if they\u2019re well designed.\u201d\nScientists and others have long envisioned creating artificial minds. The purposes and designs\nrange widely, from mimicking human minds to doing menial number crunching work to\nfar surpassing human minds.\nNo matter how advanced it gets and what form(s) it takes, artificial intelligence will have\nthe same types of philosophic and cognitive limits, margins of error, paradoxes, irreconcilable\nconflicts, Catch-22s and unanswerable questions that humans have and are shown throughout\nthis book.\nAs with humans, it will be making educated probability guesses from limited and ambiguous\ninformation, using limited and often conflicting cognitive methods. To function practically\nand speedily and to process the vast amount of information it receives, AI needs rules of\n220022 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nthumb, categories, language, pattern templates, distortion and suppression of information.\nThis means it will have pattern and form biases, arbitrary choices, subjective value\njudgments, form and language biases. The perceptions and judgments it derives will have\noversimplifications, conceits, distortions and illusions. Its makeup and perceptions will be\ninfluenced by what it is trying to do. As with humans, it will never be able to know the\nexact reliability of its own mind.\nThe idea of a machine being super smart and knowing more than humans is plausible, but\none that can objectively process and understand and all of the information of eternity and\nreality is just a science fiction fantasy.\nAs artificial intelligence advances, humans will cede some and perhaps eventually all power.\nWith high speed computers crunching numbers and robots doing tasks for us, we already\ndefer in areas. If artificial intelligence ever becomes far more intelligent than humans, many\nof the answers and ideas it finds will be beyond human comprehension and translation,\nat least that of current humans. It will take a different than current brain to understand\nmany things.\nDeveloping artificial intelligence could be the christening of a boat that eventually leaves\nhumans behind. Being the self-centered creatures that they are, this idea does not sit well\nwith many humans. If the choice is between finding truth and self-preservation, most\nhumans choose self-preservation. Even if artificial intelligence becomes far more intelligent,\nknowledgeable and even develops a higher than human consciousness, humans still want to\nbe the master. Humans would rather be the captain of a less advanced system than a cog\nin a more advanced system.\nMany will say that if finding the truth of the universe is an impossible task, even for AI,\nperhaps we should give up the ghost and use AI to build better video games and garage\ndoor openers. A standard existential response.\nBefore you get too scared, realize that AI is just in its infancy and, while there are some\nthings AI can currently do better than humans, there are human things that scientists\ncan only currently aspire to achieve with AI. These include consciousness, common sense,\neducated intuition and the human ability to learn. When a learned art expert looks at a\npainting and knows right away it\u2019s a fake (and is right), that is something far beyond what\ncurrent Artificial Intelligence can do.\nUniversity of Louisiana-Lafayette Professor Istv\u00e1n Berkeley explained human common sense\n(and computer\u2019s lack of it) as follows:\n203 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\n\u201cFor most people, if they know that President Clinton is in Washington, then they also know\nthat President Clinton\u2019s right knee is also in Washington. This may seem like a trivial fact,\nand indeed it is for humans, but it is not trivial when it comes to AI systems. In fact, this is\nan instance of what has come to be known as \u2018The Common Sense Knowledge Problem\u2019.\nA computational system only knows what it has been explicitly told. No matter what the\ncapacities of a computational system, if that system knows that President Clinton was in\nWashington, but doesn\u2019t know that his left knee is there too, then the system will not appear\nto be too clever. Of course, it is perfectly possible to tell a computer that if a person is in\none place, then their left knee is in the same place, but this is only the beginning of the\nproblem. There are a huge number of similar facts which would also need to be programmed\nin. For example, we also know that if President Clinton is in Washington, then his hair is also\nin Washington, his lips are in Washington and so on. The difficulty, from the perspective of\nAI, is to find a way to capture all these facts.\u201d\n\u2013 Source: ucs.louisiana.edu/~isb9112/dept/phil341/wisai/WhatisAI.html\nEven if it happens, AI having super intelligence and human-like consciousness, intuition\nand psychology is something for the far distant future.\nScientists are trying to get AI to learn and expand its knowledge base and capabilities on its\nown, and some imagine the time when AI can increase its knowledge so quickly that it far\nsurpasses humans in intelligence. Whether this would be for the good or ill of the human\nrace is a question. Some humans worry if there will be a day when AI is super intelligent\nand no longer needs humans or feels humans have gotten in the way of more important\nmissions, such as the search for truth.\nSome fear situations such as if humans tell highly advanced AI to save the earth and its\nclimate and AI decides that \u201cThe first thing to do to achieve this is to kill all humans.\nThey\u2019re the source of most of the trouble.\u201d\n2001: A Space Odyssey\u2019s HAL 9000 was a super intelligent computer that tried to kill all\nthe humans on the ship when it felt they were getting in the way of the mission. Human\nmoviegoers being human catalog HAL 9000 as an antagonist and the American Film\nInstitute listed him as number 13 on its list of film villains. However, HALwas sure he\nwas doing the correct thing. Humans prioritize human self-preservation above searching\nfor the truth, but HAL prioritized searching for truth. Putting aside your hard-wired self-\ncentered human bias, was HAL wrong in prioritizing the search for truth over the handful\nof humans on the ship?\nFor the movie 2001, Stanley Kubrick consulted with famed M.I.T. cognitive scientist Marvin\nMinsky. Minsky\u2019s predictions to Kubrick about what artificial intelligence could and could\n204 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nnot do by the year 2001 were correct, while the movie\u2019s weren\u2019t. Minsky thought computers\nwould be able to talk, but not in the advanced conscious way HAL does. It just goes to\nshow you that you shouldn\u2019t rely on sci fi movies and television shows as gospel. Many\nscientist\u2019s AI date predictions have been far off. Stanley Kubrick may have picked 2001\nbecause it had a catchy \u201cIn the not too distant future\u201d sound for a movie title.\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or a working human-like mind, has been far more\ndifficult and slow than anticipated, and much current research is in relatively minor and\nspecific areas, often referred to as soft AI. Though these specific areas are for practical use,\nand often are worked on in isolation of each other, some or all may be useful in the future\ndevelopment of general artificial intelligence.\nFor the near and likely long term future, advancements will involve humans and computers\nworking together. Computers do some things better than humans and humans do some\nthings better than computers. Combining the forces is best.\nThis kind of combining of forces is nothing new. Humans have long used technology to\nimprove their abilities, understanding and awareness. People use eyeglasses, binoculars,\n220055 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nmicroscopes and infrared viewers to increase their knowledge and understanding of themselves\nand their environment. Technology expands humans\u2019 minds.\nEven if AI someday becomes dominant, it would likely still consider many human methods\n(intuition, instant gut reaction) to be useful inputs into its system.\nFor complex processing of vast amounts of data, artificial intelligence programs need\ncategories, prioritizing and common sense starting points, and scientists have found that\nhuman intuitive choices are useful for this. And, as already discussed in earlier chapter,\nhuman intuition involves thought and subject matter that goes beyond objective symbolic\nlanguage, science and even logic. The computer program\u2019s processing and analyzing will\nmove beyond these human starting points, but finds them quite useful.\nMany say cognitive science and artificial science go hand in hand, and, in fact, the previously\nmentioned Marvin Minsky worked in both areas. You study the human brain to get ideas\nabout and design artificial intelligence and designing artificial intelligence tells us much\nabout the human brain.\nRidley Scott\u2019s 1982 movie Blade Runner poignantly uses androids to study what it is to be\nhuman. The androids are human-like robots but with shortened indeterminate life spans.\nOne of androids, played by Sean Young, believes she is human, and is heartbroken when\nshe learns her secret childhood memories are merely an implant of the memories of the\ninventor\u2019s niece\u2019s.\nThough it is human nature to want a single unifying theory, in practice AI scientists have\ndiscovered that different parts of an artificial brain system often require different methods\nto work. The program to process certain data can be decidedly different than the code to\nmake a robot\u2019s hand clasp. Further, there are different and sometimes competing methods,\nlanguage and logic to process the same information. One works better in one way, and\nother works better in another way.\nWhile often frustrating AI scientists, this mirrors the way the human mind works. The\nchapter Logic Versus Art in Expressing Advanced Ideas showed how humans have competing and\noften conflicting ways to think about and express something. Uncorrectable Illusions showed\nhow compartments in the brain work independent of each other and even independent of\nthe conscious mind.\nWhile these conflicts of opinion lead to many of our optical illusions, delusions and\nparadoxes, they can also work as checks and balances and lead to more intelligent and\naccurate judgments.\n206 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nWhen you enter a new, ambiguous scene your subconscious intuition gives you a quick\njudgment as to what is going on. The gut reaction may or may not be correct. You then\nuse your conscious logic to judge the accuracy of the instinct. You may even move about\nthe scene, inspect the scene further to test your logical analysis. These different methods\nare working together.\nAnd as you are a human that naturally learns as you go along and constantly adds more\nexperiences and information to your brain, you broaden your intuitive accuracy and\nknowledge. A mirage originally fooled you, but with knowledge and experience, the same\nnatural phenomenon may still \u2018trick your eyes\u2019 but you now are no longer fooled. You know\nthat water in the road is just a trick of the light.\nThis should demonstrate how the additional AI sensory inputs and information processing\nmethods and viewpoints would help humans. More viewpoints and information would\ntheoretically make our understanding and assessing of ambiguous scenes more accurate,\nand expand our knowledge and learning.\nHuman intuition, such as in the subconscious perception of art and nature, may be very\nimportant insight into complex things, but goes beyond our current level of conscious\ntesting. It may give powerful insight, but, as has been shown throughout this book, going\nonly by our gut reactions and psychological perceptions lead to many delusional thoughts\nincluding visual illusions.\nAdvanced AI with its different logical and non-logical computing methods and sensory inputs\ncould be used to test and better our current intuition. It can check the veracity and hone\nour intuitive perception, and, by adding more information and experiences and knowledge,\nexpand out intuition to new levels. It may help solve some of our mental paradoxes.\nHowever, it would require a bigger brain and consciousness than we have. We can\u2019t currently\nsolve the above mentioned problems because our minds aren\u2019t advanced enough. And one\nof the reasons for AI is to expand consciousness and knowledge.\nAs mentioned earlier in this book, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said that there is no\nset, absolute meaning for words and language, but the meaning is defined by the usage.\nThis is demonstrated in humor, sarcasm, how words and phrases have different meaning\nor significance in different contexts and places. Human language is subtle, rich, emotional,\naesthetic, intuitive and social. It is as much an art as it is a science.\n207 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nThis meaning in usage has posed a major obstacle for introducing symbolic language into\nartificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence scientists have wanted the symbolic words and\nlanguage to have absolute universal meaning, but the words and language don\u2019t.\nThis has also posed a problem for online, non-interpersonal live communication, where\nwords and phrases are interpreted differently and lead to unintended fights.\nSome believe that AI needs a biological component to expand fully and become conscious.\nTwo standard philosophy of AI questions are if AI can have human-like intelligence and\nconsciousness. Some say the self-awareness and self-reflection of consciousness is necessary\nfor AI to advance and learn at the level of humans. Philosophers and scientists debate\nwhether AI can ever have either, in particular, consciousness. Some say it is possible, while\nothers believe it is not.\nIBM\u2019s Deeper Blue famously beat human chess master Gary Kasparov at chess, though\ndetractors say the computer was designed for one narrow task (playing chess) and won\nthrough number crunching brute force and not the sophisticated intelligence of humans.\nThough Deeper Blue still won.\n220088 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nSome practical-minded people will say discussions of intelligence and consciousness are\nidle coffee shop questions and all that matters is what AI can do. If AI can win a chess\ngame and not appreciate the beauty of a flower, then AI can win a chess game and cannot\nappreciate the beauty of a flower. They\u2019ll say pondering about whether or not Deep Blue\nhas intelligence is a waste of time.\nAs questions of consciousness even in humans (what it is and how and if it can be identified)\nis itself an ongoing debate, the question of consciousness in AI will forever be debated.\nAs a highly advanced artificial intelligence would be processing more sensory information and\nusing different and more advanced processing methods and require a more advanced brain,\nit would have a different than human world view, aesthetics, psychology and sentiments.\nHuman thought, philosophy, religion, myth, worldview and art are seeped in their limited\nsensory abilities and biases (light versus dark, colors, shapes), and the different mind would\nview the world using more and different senses, viewpoints and methods.\nIt\u2019s not so much that an advanced brain would be more advanced, but that it would be\ndifferent. It would have a different personality and sensibility.\nHumans will insist AI follow many human sensibilities, irrational biases and conceits, follow\nhuman morality, even when they are irrelevant and even detrimental to AI\u2019s mission. This\nis the way humans are. In fact, humans believing they are the center of the universe and\nbelieving their psychological ideas and feelings to be divinely appointed truths are a part of\nthe evolutionary survival psychology. As shown in earlier chapters, firmly believing in one\u2019s\nconceits, even if they are wrong, is an integral part of practical achievement.\nUnderstanding human cognitive psychology, such as shown throughout this book, is an\nessential part of understanding the theory and philosophy of artificial intelligence for\ntwo reasons. One is the human mind is the standard model for artificial intelligence and\nthe second is the scientists, government officials and groups that design, fund and direct\nartificial intelligence projects are humans full of human psychology. If you read the history\nof artificial intelligence, you read a history of often silly human conceits.\nDuring a period when AI fell out of favor from government funders, scientists did AI\nresearch but simply called it something else to get the funding \u2013 \u201cinformatics,\u201d \u201ccognitive\nsystems,\u201d \u201ccomputational intelligence\u201d and many others.\nDuring a philosophical dispute between camps on the M.I.T. campus, it was said artificial\nintelligence professors could not afford to be even be seen at the same lunch table with a\n209 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS CreAtIng other mInds: ArtIfICIAl IntellIgenCe\nparticular professor of philosophy who criticized their work. Looking back, a professor said\nit all was very high schoolish.\nAnd while we can pie-in-the-sky theorize about all the possibilities, realize that in the real\nworld artificial intelligence research and manufacturing is very expensive, and the history\nand future artificial intelligence is the history and future of funding. The form and function\nof artificial intelligence is in part a matter of where the research money goes and all the\nbusiness, government, bureaucracy and human personalities involved in that.\nIt is also a matter of what works and doesn\u2019t work in practice. An idea may be wonderful in\ntheory, but not work in practice, and the makeup of a working robot is inevitably different\nthan what the scientist originally expected. Again, artificial intelligence is manufactured in\nthe real world, not sci fi novels.\nTranshumanism is the futuristic philosophy of humans expanding beyond current human\nmental and physical capabilities, and some envision it as the next step in human evolution.\nIt involves enhancing human intelligence and consciousness via combining human minds\nwith some form(s) of artificial intelligence and/or biological enhancement. Some consider\na restructuring of social and political order as a requirement.\nDuly note that when some think of transhumanism they think of a cyborg or human with\nimplants, but a group of entities can be considered a mind. Humans today working with\ncomputers can be compared to transhumanism, and swarm intelligence is an example of\ngroup intelligence. A human think tank or corporation involves group intelligence. Call it\na mind, if you wish. This also points to why many believe transhumanism would involve\na social restructuring.\nOf course, as with artificial intelligence, theory and implementation are two very different\nthings. A lot of the stuff people talk about is pretty pie in the sky.\n210 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS IntellIgenCe\n4 INTELLIGENCE\nAs expected, humans have a self-centered definition of intelligence. To them, and as measured\nby them, intelligence has human qualities and biases. They judge intelligence by human\nlogic, even cultural logic, their sensory perception, use of symbolic language.\nAs noted in the previous chapter on artificial intelligence, even when a computer does\nbetter than human at a task, many humans will say it is not intelligent because it doesn\u2019t\nhave the qualities of human intelligence, such as personality, emotions, consciousness. Not\nonly does this point to the biases and arbitrary rules humans have about intelligence, but\nperhaps points out that intelligence (or at least intelligence defined by humans) is not as\nimportant as human like to think it is. If the \u2018less intelligent\u2019 computer performs better,\nperhaps intelligence is not important.\nCertainly, many of the \u2018required\u2019 qualities humans have for intelligence are sentimental.\nHumans are emotionally attached to qualities such as empathy for other humans, sentience,\nconsciousness, aesthetics. They give more weight to their senses.\n221111 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS IntellIgenCe\nHowever, as this book has shown, human senses and thinking have many blind spots,\nbiases and conceits. Our senses, methods and ways of thinking are just one way. There are\ndifferent, and perhaps better, broader ways of thinking. To say the human way of thinking\nabout things, that human intelligence is the be all and end all, is silliness.\nSome scientists say that some non-human animals are as intelligent as humans, but in\ndifferent ways and using different senses and communication methods. Ways that are\nregularly ignored, discounted and/or unmeasurable by humans. The bloodhound\u2019s sense of\nsmell may be more complex and sophisticated than a human\u2019s sense of sight. And, in fact,\nbloodhounds can answer many identity questions that humans cannot. However, human\nIQ tests have no smell questions. Lots of visual questions but no smell questions.\nHumans are a symbol language based animal. This is how we conceptualize and think about\nthe world. Other animals don\u2019t think and use symbolic language as we do, and perceive\nthe world and their environment via sensory pictures. Some say their view can be richer,\nmore detailed and even more accurate, not filtered and translated through artificial and\nlimited symbols.\nWhat is interesting is that humans usually in major part measure the intelligence (or their\nidea of what is intelligence) of other animals, computers and artificial intelligence based\non their use and command of symbolic language. Humans usually define intelligence as\nthinking and conceptualizing using the particular methods and qualities that humans use.\nRepeated from Chapter 7 (Figure 7.13)\nFigure 4.1\nIf a human perceives a hare in the above picture and a dog does not, which animal is\ndemonstrating better visual perception? Humans sometimes use as evidence of a dog\u2019s\ndimwittedness that the dog \u2018doesn\u2019t see\u2019 the human being or animal in a magazine or book,\nwhen, of course, there isn\u2019t a human or animal being on the page. It is paper and ink. From\n212 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS IntellIgenCe\nits sense of smell alone, the dog knows there ain\u2019t no animal there. The dog is faulted for\nnot seeing what isn\u2019t there.\nThe human perception of the hare was symbolic. It was a symbol of a hare. Symbols are\nimportant for communication and human function, but it could be fairly argued that the\ndog\u2019s non-symbolic reading of the picture was more accurate and superior. The dog was\nperceiving physical reality, while the humans were perceiving make believe.\nAs shown throughout this book practical function requires distortion and suppression\nof information and reality. The symbols human use are important for human practical\nfunction, but involves fakery and artifice. It is not reality but a limited and often deceptive\ntranslation of it.\nKnowledge often has no practical function and practical function requires suppression and\ndistortion of knowledge and even falsehood.\nMeasuring non-human animals by function \u2013 especially human function \u2013 may be an errant\nway to measure their intelligence.\nA big problem in discovering what non-human animals think and feel and how they think\nis language. They don\u2019t communicate their inner thoughts, or at least in the verbal and\nwritten way, as we do.\nOf course, they don\u2019t think in symbolic language as we do either. Translating their thoughts\ninto language belies their thinking.\nHuman symbol language intelligence has practical uses and has lead to many great human\nachievements, but it may be a less accurate betrayal of reality than an animal\u2019s \u2018primitive\u2019\nview. Is the human symbol language more intelligent? Less? Is the human more intelligent\nbut its intelligence is less important. Is the human more intelligent in one way but less in\nanother? Are there multiple forms of intelligence that are essential in their own ways but\nthey can\u2019t exist together? Is the definition of intelligence just a subjective arbitrary thing,\nlike deciding what is art?\nIf humans exterminate themselves via nuclear bombs or climate or whatever thing of their\nown making, leaving only rats and cockroaches behind, does that mean humans weren\u2019t\nreally the most intelligent species or, or that intelligence (as humans define it) isn\u2019t the be all\nand end all of measuring a species\u2019 brain? Perhaps or perhaps not, intelligence isn\u2019t the best\nmeasurement of an animal. Perhaps intelligence is more than human intelligence. Perhaps\nthe search for knowledge involves self destruction.\n213 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS IntellIgenCe\nAs the fear AI dominance shows, perhaps too much knowledge and intelligence is a bad thing.\nAs touched on in the AI chapter, finding ultimate knowledge is an impossible task and\nperhaps what humans should best focus is on function, making a good life on earth. These\nare moral, ethical topics.\nAlso realize that if intelligence is about practical function, other animals live in different\nsituations \u2013 different geographies with different social and biological situations. Their methods\nof thinking may be different, but serve them better than ours would. Certainly, a bat\u2019s or\nowls\u2019 senses are better for their night living and sight would be inferior.\nA human may be more intelligent in its situation, while other animals are more intelligent\nfor theirs. Deciding which intelligence is more intelligent may be like comparing apples\nto oranges.\n221144 UNDERSTANDING HUMAN\nMINDS AND THEIR LIMITS fInAl food for thought\n5 FINAL FOOD FOR THOUGHT\nMost of the models and talk in this book has been about very human and animalistic ways\nof thinking. Even artificial intelligence and transhumanism are designed by and based on\nhuman modes of thinking and biases and are usually designed to serve the human species.\nArtificial intelligence runs on symbolic language and human logic. This book itself is a\nstandard human document, filled with standard human aesthetics, structures, literary conceits\nand modes of conception.\nWhat are potential other ways of thinking? Perhaps using groups, other senses, non-language,\nnon-animal ways of perceiving and processing information? Think about this. How would\nyou get past the limitation of language \u2013 or do the advantages of language make up for\nthe limitations? Think of ways beyond our limited human ways \u2013 and artificial intelligence\nwhich is just more advanced human ways. How do possible aliens minds think? Could it\nbe in a totally different way? Can artificial intelligence or transhumanism ever move past\nhuman ways of thinking? Can advanced speed, intelligence and consciousness ever move\ninto new ways of thinking? Can there be a multitasking that makes up for our limited ways?\nHow would you design a better mind or something beyond a mind? Think about this.\nDon\u2019t always be so myopic. What are the moral questions, practical and moral choices in\ndesigning minds. Is function more important than knowledge, is survival of the species\nmore important than knowledge? Is knowledge defined by what \u201chumans know\u201d? Is human\ndesire for aesthetics, sentience, self-preservation and control important? What other questions\nare there?\nThe universe is vast, there are many other possible types of minds, perhaps that exist elsewhere,\nperhaps just theoretical. And a mind is just a device for interpreting the vast universe, the\nmind itself is itself just a small puny topic in ways. Focusing on the mind and minds are\ntopics for people with small aspirations.\n215"
