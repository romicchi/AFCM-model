Preface and Acknowledgments\nThis is neither a textbook nor a manifesto for any particular approach to\nheritage ethics. I invited the contributors to speak about issues they deeply\ncare about, using the volume as a platform from which to argue for their\nown points of view. Their focus is sometimes general, and at other times\ntakes the form of case studies. Our collective aim was not to present an\noverview of the field, but to showcase the value of promoting awareness of\ndifficult questions through debate which bridges the gap between theory\nand practice. For ease of reference the Appendix to the volume contains\nlinks to selected international charters and conventions on cultural heritage\nmentioned in the essays.\nIt would be ungracious to not mention here three obvious predecessors\nto this volume. One is Elazar Barkan and Ronald Bush\u2019s Claiming the\nStones/Naming the Bones: Cultural Property and the Negotiation of National\nand Ethnic Identity (Getty Research Institute, 2002). This excellent volume\ncontains fourteen essays addressing a variety of controversies from across\nnumerous academic and vocational perspectives including anthropology,\narchaeology, ethnobiology, law, and literary studies. Another, which\nshares two contributors with this volume, is John Henry Merryman\u2019s more\nspecialised volume, Imperialism, Art and Restitution (Cambridge University\nPress, 2006). Finally, there is Astrid Swenson and Peter Mandler\u2019s recent\nbook From Plunder to Preservation: Britain and the Heritage of Empire, c.1800-\n1940 (Oxford University Press, 2013).\nOne of the issues surrounding cultural heritage is that of access and it\nhas been hugely important to me that everyone has free unrestricted access\nto the essays in this book. I am extremely grateful to William St Clair for\nproposing Open Book Publishers as a possibility, to Alessandra Tosi for all\nher work, help, and advice from submission to production, and to Bianca\nGualandi for her invaluable assistance with the inclusion of images. Fellow xx Cultural Heritage Ethics\nphilosopher Jonathan Webber came up with the suggestion of Banksy\u2019s\nPaint Pot Angel for the cover of this volume. I\u2019m very grateful to Diane\nPotter for permission to reuse her photograph of it.\nI also wish to thank the anonymous referees for their incredibly\nastute comments and constructive suggestions and, of course, all of the\ncontributors for their stellar work. A generous Visiting Fellowship at the\nHelsinki Collegium of Advanced Studies has given me the time to put the\nfinal version of the manuscript together in the most pleasant of academic\nenvironments.\nOver a decade ago Eleni Cubitt sparked my interest in cultural heritage\nethics and this volume was her idea. Like her namesake of Troy, Eleni\nhas launched a thousand ships in her time. But it is equally fitting that\nshe was named after St Helena, mother of Constantine and patron saint\nof archaeologists. Though she will not necessarily agree with all the ideas\nwithin this volume, I trust that she will find them thoroughly engaging. I\ndedicate the book to her, with much love.\nConstantine Sandis\nHelsinki, May 2014 Introduction\nConstantine Sandis\nTheory without practice is empty, practice without theory is blind, to\nadapt a phrase from Immanuel Kant. Cultural heritage ethics has certainly\nsuffered from such a dichotomy. This book seeks to bridge the gap between\ntheory and practice through conversations which promote the awareness\nand debate of difficult questions, collectively pointing to a just medium\nbetween academic and vocational approaches.\nThe intra-disciplinary essays that follow have been written by\nacademics, consultants, journalists, lawyers, and museum practitioners. I\nhave divided them into four sections: (i) meaning and memory; (ii) history\nand archaeology; (iii) ownership and restitution; and (iv) management\nand protection. The book thus guides the reader from the abstract to the\nconcrete, and back again. What follows is a brief overview of the essays in\neach section.\nPart I: Meaning and Memory\nIn \u2018Culture, Heritage, and Ethics\u2019, I introduce a number of themes taken up\nin more detail by the other contributors. Given the range of questions and\ncomplexities surrounding heritage, I am sceptical about the possibility of a\nunified account of it. Heritage, cultural or otherwise, is not always good. It\nmay be preserved in fundamentally different, indeed contradictory, ways.\nPari passu, the range of rights relating to it is not a straightforward one. My\nessay has been written in the faith that \u2018a repertoire might be more useful\nthan a conviction\u2019,sketching out a very partial and rudimentary conceptual\n\u00a9 Constantine Sandis, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.14 2 Cultural Heritage Ethics\ncartography of the area of cultural heritage ethics. In so doing, I hope to\nhave marked some of the numerous pitfalls which face the bolder theorist.\nJames Fox\u2019s \u2018Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present\u2019 takes as\nits starting point the scandal ignited in November 2011, when FIFA (the\ninternational football governing body) refused to allow the English football\nteam to wear remembrance poppies on their shirts during a match against\nSpain. FIFA had long enforced a universal ban on the wearing of political\nsymbols during its games, but under intense pressure from both the\ngovernment and the Royal Family it finally relented. British lobbyists had\nargued that the poppy was a \u2018universal symbol of remembrance\u2019, and had\nno political, religious or commercial connotations. Fox\u2019s essay explores the\norigins and development of Britain\u2019s rituals of remembrance, arguing that\nthe poppy is far less neutral than its supporters claim: Fox demonstrates\nthat in fact the poppy has deeply political associations which legitimise the\nconflict that it ostensibly seems to condemn. His insights on the politics\nof remembrance suggest that heritage in this case refers to the past rather\nthan to the present.\nThe first section concludes with Benjamin Ramm\u2019s essay \u2018The Meaning\nof the Public in an Age of Privatisation\u2019. Ramm takes on the New Right\u2019s\ncharacterisation of the private realm as the abode of meaning, investigating\nhow this attack on the value of shared culture has impoverished citizens by\nrobbing them of a vocabulary with which to make sense of the world. The\nneoliberal concept of \u2018private persons, public consumers\u2019, he concludes,\nhas little time for public memory \u2013 a context in which heritage takes on\nradical new meaning.\nPart II. History and Archaeology\nIn \u2018History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka\u2019, Nira\nWickramasinghe explores the consolidation by a patriotic post-conflict\nstate of a notion of history reinvented as national heritage. The distinction\nbetween history as an analysis of the past and heritage had rarely been\nmade explicit in the public discourse. After the war ended the distinction\ndisappeared almost entirely from the national discourse, with the exception\nof a few voices in history departments. In Wickramasinghe\u2019s view, heritage\nas we understand it, is created, shaped and managed by, and in response\nto, the demands of the present. It is, to follow David Lowenthal, not history\nat all, but a special pleading. Wickramasinghe draws from an array of Introduction 3\nsources and practices relating to post-war Sri Lanka to assess the feasibility\nof devising alternative strategies in the production of historical knowledge.\nWilliams St Clair\u2019s \u2018Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times\nto Antiquity\u2019 does just what it says on the tin. St Clair guides the reader\nthrough the history of ways of looking at the Acropolis \u2013 how and when\ndifferent perspectives emerged and how they were mediated. St Clair takes\nthis analysis even further, using the Acropolis as a case study to prove that\nthe meaning of cultural sites and artefacts is at least partly determined\nby the viewer. St Clair argues that the wish to offer viewers a means of\nunderstanding the relationship between the then present, the then past,\nand the then future, was among the explicitly stated aims of those who built\nthe classical Acropolis, as well as by others in later times. By relocating the\nsite where meanings are made to the minds of viewers and by admitting\nthem as active participants in a complex dynamic system, we become able\nto take into account factors that are not given sufficient attention in current\nconventions.\nIn her essay \u2018South Asian Heritage and Archaeological Practices\u2019,\nSudeshna Guha demonstrates how archaeological practices have been\nconsistently deployed within South Asia for over two hundred years in\norder to establish truths about the origins and legacy of that civilisation.\nGuha focuses on histories of civilisational traditions that have been\nunearthed in colonial and post-colonial India through seemingly disparate\narchaeological practices, but which have historiographic crossings and\nmutations. With reference to the nineteenth-century creation of a Buddhist\nBanaras, as well as to recent interpretations regarding the cultural legacies\nof the Indus Civilisation, Guha aims to sow seeds of caution towards all\nforms of valorisation of civilisational ethos within disciplinary archaeology.\nIn so doing, she situates the importance of critiquing such constructs in an\nacademic milieu that shows an increasing concern towards archaeological\nproductions of tangible \u2018heritage-industries\u2019.\nGeoffrey Scarre\u2019s \u2018The Ethics of Digging\u2019 asks how archaeologists\nshould select their research material, and whether they make their choices\non the basis of academic considerations alone. Whose interests should\narchaeological research be serving: those of the profession, of local ethnic\nor indigenous groups, of the general public, or the good of mankind?\nAnd how should these be prioritised? What permissions (and whose) do\narchaeologists need to obtain if their digging is to be ethical? Is excavation\nwhich permanently damages or changes a site ethically acceptable? Should 4 Cultural Heritage Ethics\narchaeologists, in a Lockean vein, take care to leave \u2018as much and as good\u2019\nmaterial for later researchers, and avoid depleting archaeological resources?\nWhat duties do archaeologists have following excavation in regard to\nrecording, publication, dissemination and display? Is archaeological\ndigging ethically consistent with the principle of stewardship to which\nmost archaeologists pay lip-service? Would stewardship, strictly construed,\nimply a \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach to the archaeological resource, and permit\nexcavation only in the case of endangered sites? What special ethical\nresponsibilities do archaeological researchers have in regard to human\nremains and grave-sites? These are the key questions which Scarre posits\nand begins to answer.\nPart III: Ownership and Restitution\nJohn Boardman\u2019s \u2018\u201cNational\u201d Heritage and Scholarship\u2019 considers the\nfifty-year old debate over the handling and publication of ancient artefacts\nacquired through channels other than official excavation. Boardman\nreminds us that while the UNESCO declaration has effectively increased\nthe value of objects known before 1970, it has done nothing to halt the\nacquisition and marketing of \u2018recovered\u2019 objects. It is still not uncommon\nto hear the term \u2018national heritage\u2019 being used and this can easily lead to a\nmore casual approach to some aspects of the problem. Better by far, claims\nBoardman, to speak of \u2018global heritage\u2019, the \u2018heritage of man\u2019 or even just\n\u2018heritage\u2019. There are very few relevant countries whose modern population\nhas any serious genetic or cultural links with their distant past. Jealousy\nseems a very strong motive in many cases, often abetted by extreme views\nabout what \u2018copyright\u2019 entails.\nMoving from jealousy to \u2018Fear of Cultural Objects\u2019, Tom Flynn reads\nsome of the recent and current disputes over global cultural heritage\nthrough the metaphor of fear. The essay opens with an analysis of the little-\nknown early German expressionist feature film Fear, the narrative of which\ncentres upon the illicit removal of a cultural object from a distant sacred\nsite and its subsequent re-location to a European private collection. The\nsubsequent \u2018haunting\u2019 of the collector, triggered by the illicit act of removal,\nprovokes our ethical reflections on heritage by suggesting that many of\ntoday\u2019s cultural heritage disputes are fuelled by different types of fear.\nWestern \u2018universal\u2019 museums fear losing their collections, which symbolise\ntheir identity and power, to repatriation. This can be contrasted with the Introduction 5\nfear felt by many in the formerly subaltern nations of the developing world\nwho interpret these mainly European and North American encyclopaedic\ninstitutions as tyrannical symbols of imperial greed. Flynn explores the\nroots of this mutual fear, asking how it can be assuaged in an increasingly\nglobalised world of contested cultural objects.\nFurther worries about \u2018Restitution\u2019 are investigated by Mark Jones\nwho considers the arguments for the return of cultural property and tests\nthem against some well-known contested objections. While recognising\nthe difficulty of reaching an agreement, Jones combines case studies with\nsharp critical insights to suggest ways in which contested objects instead\nof being divisive might on the contrary become catalysts for international\npartnerships. Inaction in this case may be a better way of serving the public\ninterest.\nPart IV: Management and Protection\nThe fourth and final section of the volume opens with Michael F. Brown\u2019s\nexploration of \u2018The Possibilities and Perils of Heritage Management\u2019.\nAlthough the right of communities to practice their culture and defend it\nfrom unwanted appropriation is widely regarded as a human right, the\nprecise means by which this right can be defended and administered remains\nuncertain. Brown argues that the very notion of \u2018managing\u2019 a society\u2019s\nmultiple forms of collective expression entails a degree of objectification\nthat poses a potential threat to culture\u2019s inherent (and necessary) fluidity.\nHis essay considers the challenge of finding an appropriate balance\nbetween ethical considerations and the law of unintended consequences\nin the vexed arena of heritage protection. Using brief case studies, Brown\nhighlights the tendency of heritage protection strategies to gravitate to top-\ndown, \u2018patrimonial\u2019 models of control that treat culture as a commodity.\nHe concludes by making the ethical case for more informal and flexible\napproaches to heritage protection.\nGeoffrey Belcher begins his essay \u2018Values in World Heritage Sites\u2019 by\nconsidering the variety of World Heritage sites, from the symbolic value\nof Auschwitz and Hiroshima to the beauty of the Taj Mahal and the Great\nBarrier Reef. All these sites are selected by the Conservation Committee at\nUNESCO. Even though the management of the sites is formally undertaken\nby the national state party (DCMS in the case of the United Kingdom),\nin practice it falls to local organisations. Belcher argues that the chain of 6 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nresponsibility from international to local levels creates various tensions, the\nconcept of World Heritage being informed by the ten UNESCO criteria at\nthe universal level, and by national and local aspirations at the area level.\nIn order to rationalise this, statements of \u2018outstanding universal values\u2019\nare produced for each site, identifying the special qualities and also their\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 and \u2018integrity\u2019. But without a precise system of rules at the\ninternational level, local agencies have to rely on national and local systems\nsuch as town-planning legislation for protection. At present this legislation\nin the UK does not fully encompass the listing and management of World\nHeritage Sites. The result is that the simple, popular concept of World\nHeritage is being de facto challenged in its application and administration.\nBelcher\u2019s essay fleshes out some of the problematic areas and identifies\nopportunities for creating clearer guidelines in the future.\nHaving begun with a series of conceptual questions, the volume ends\non the legalistic note of Marie Cornu\u2019s essay \u2018Safeguarding Heritage: From\nLegal Rights over Objects to Legal Rights for Individuals and Communities?\u2019\nThere are numerous ways of regulating the connection between memory,\nhistory and heritage and, in this respect, diversity rules. Cornu discusses\nthe second wave of laws on heritage protection, which have taken on board\nwider concerns about development and integration. Cornu outlines the\nprocess by which other fields of the law (environmental but also economic\nlaw) are now part of cultural heritage law, a field originally created as an\nautonomous and distinct body of legislation. Whilst positive outcomes are\nlikely to result from the intersection of different legal fields, there is also a\nrisk that the level of protection of cultural heritage sites may decrease.\nThe thirteen essays collectively cover questions relating to access (essays\n1-2, 4-5, 7-11); acquisition (3, 8-10); antiquities (5-6, 9-10); apartheid (1);\narchaeological practice (6-7); barbarism and plunder (3, 10-13); capitalism\n(1, 3); celebration (1-3, 6, 10-12); citizenship (3-5, 11); colonialism and\npost-colonialism (1, 3-6, 9-10); curatorship (3, 9-10); education (3-5, 8, 12);\nenlightenment (3, 5, 7, 9); ethnology (3-4, 9, 11, 13); fear (2,7,9-10); hegemony\n(3-4); historiography (1, 4-6); history (1, 3-4, 6-7, 9-13); human remains (7,\n10-11, 13); integrity (7-8, 12, 13); intellectual property (11); jealousy (8-9);\nlegislation (4, 8, 13, 10); management (3-5, 7, 8-13); memory (1-5, 13); myth\n(4, 6-7); nationalism (2, 4-6, 8, 10-11); nostalgia (1, 4, 12); ownership (1, 5-6,\n8-11); policy (1-2, 4-5, 10-11); prejudice (3, 10); preservation (1, 4, 5, 7-8,\n10-11, 13); pride (1, 3, 5-7); protection (1, 5, 7, 10-13); public interest (2-3, 7,\n10-13); privatisation (3, 9-10); relics (3-4); religion (1-2, 4-6, 9); respect (4, 6-7, Introduction 7\n9-10, 12-13); responsibility (1, 4-5, 7-8, 12-13); restitution and repatriation\n(5-11, 13); restoration (4, 6-7, 10); revolution and dissent (3-5, 9); rights\n(1, 5, 11-13); scholarship (6, 8); shame (1, 5, 10); slavery (1); stewardship\n(5, 7, 19); technology (1, 3-5, 6-7); tourism (1, 3-5, 7-8,10-12); trusteeship\n(4, 10); understanding (3-4, 6-7, 9-10, 12); UNESCO (4-5, 7, 10-13); and\nworld heritage sites and conventions (8, 11-13). Of telling but unplanned\nsignificance is the fact that all thirteen essays mention war.\nIt would have been impossible to cover all the relevant examples of\ncultural heritage, but the range of examples included across the volume is\nsufficiently geographically diverse to include references to Afghanistan (2),\nAustralia (2, 7, 11-12), Bangladesh (6, 13), Belgium (12), Bolivia (1, 11-12),\nBrazil (2, 11), Canada (2, 10-11), Chile (11-12), China (6, 10-11), the Czech\nRepublic (1), Cuba (1, 11), Denmark (1, 5, 10), Ecuador (11), Egypt (1, 3, 5-6,\n8-10, 12-13), England (1, 2, 5, 10), Estonia (11), Ethiopia (10), Finland (1),\nFrance (2, 6, 10, 13), Greece (1, 5, 8, 10, 13), India (1, 3-6, 9--12), Ireland (2, 10,\n12), Israel (1, 6), Italy (1, 8-9, 10, 13), Japan (12-13), Kenya (11), Korea (10-\n11, 13), Madagascar (1), Mali (4, 7, 11), Mexico (11-12), New Zealand (2, 7),\nNigeria (10), Norway (1, 10), Pakistan (6), Peru (11), Poland (1, 12), Russia\n(1), Scotland (5, 10, 12), Senegal (12), South Africa (1, 4-6, 10-11), Spain (2,\n12-13), Sri Lanka (4), Sweden (1, 6), Switzerland (1), Tunisia (13), Turkey\n(11), the United States (2, 4-5, 7,10-13), and Wales (12).\nThe subject is far from exhausted however, and there remains much\nground to be covered. I would like to have been able to showcase\ncontributions from across even more disciplines, to have covered wider\ngeographical ground, and to have been able to include essays on additional\ntopics such as those of the digital humanities (from online collections to\n3D printing of souvenirs and archaeological artefacts), the heritage of\nmorally tainted gifts, pollution as the counterpart of sacralisation, and the\ndistinction between the ethics of returning artefacts for preservation vis-\u00e0-\nvis those of returning human remains often for destruction. But if we have\nlearned one thing from the ethics of cultural heritage it is not to let greed\ninfect our aspirations.  I\nMEANING AND MEMORY  1. Culture, Heritage, and Ethics\nConstantine Sandis1\n1. Introduction\nHeritage is that which has been or may be inherited, regardless of its value.\nUnfortunately, the term \u2018heritage\u2019 (the thirteenth-century English word\nis derived from the Latin haeres, meaning heir or heiress) is nowadays\nfrequently used for purposes best described as touristic, to sell everything\nfrom beer and tomatoes to cars, gardens, and hotels. It is possible to think\nof some of this heritage as non-cultural, or perhaps even anti-cultural.\nAn even more plausible contender for this last set would be hooliganism,\nyet this is unlikely to feature in British magazines about heritage such as\nHeritage, Discover Britain, or British Heritage Magazine. And yet such anti-\ncultural behaviour may be as much a part of Britain\u2019s culture as Big Ben,\nthe Monarchy, Stilton cheese, the National Health Service, and Top of\nthe Pops \u2014 the sort of things celebrated in Danny Boyle\u2019s 2012 Olympic\nCeremony Opening.\nHeritage magazines may choose to focus on castles, lakes, and gardens\n(and do so for ostensibly sound commercial and aesthetic reasons), but it\nwould be wrong to think of these paradigm cases as being definitive. On\nthe contrary, we should be questioning whether they are even as common\n1 This essay greatly benefited from discussions with Geoffrey Belcher, Eleni Cubitt, Max\nde Gaynesford, Alon Lischinsky, and Erasmus Mayr. It was presented in near-final form\nat the Ethics, Museums and Archaeology workshop, Ashmolean Museum (Oxford),\n3-4 April 2014, after which I made some improvements thanks to feedback from Anna\nBergqvist, Ivan Gaskell, Erin Kavanagh, and Andreas Pantazatos. Finally, thanks to\nCandida Lord for careful proofreading which saved me from several embarrassments.\n\u00a9 Constantine Sandis, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.01 12 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nas contemporary popular opinion portrays them to be. To this conceptual\nmix we might wish to add the spurious distinction between so-called \u2018high\u2019\nand \u2018low\u2019 culture. It is a mistake to think that cultural heritage is reserved\nfor the former, that it privileges opera over football, Shakespeare over\nEastEnders, though we may of course choose to use terms like \u2018culture\u2019 in\na more technical, narrower, sense.\n2. Achievement and Atrocity\nIn distinguishing heritage from history, David Lowenthal has influentially\nargued that the former is a \u2018celebration\u2019 of the past.2 But one need only\nthink of the heritage of slavery to note that we should not assume that one\u2019s\ncultural heritage is always, or even usually, celebrated. Even when it is, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that the celebration in question is of the past, as opposed to a\ncontinuity that remains present. Nor need it be the case that the celebration\nis a justified one.\nFrench Law explicitly allows for the production of foie gras as part of\nthe country\u2019s \u2018cultural and gastronomic heritage\u2019. By contrast, in July 2012\nthe state of California banned the production of foie gras, implementing a\n$1000 per-day penalty for serving it. Production has already been banned\nin the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland,\nIsrael, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The city of Chicago\nbanned its sale in 2006, only to have it overturned by then mayor Richard\nM. Daley. More surprisingly, perhaps, Germany\u2019s Nazi Government had\nbanned foie gras production in 1933, as part of a wider animal protection\nlaw signed by Hitler which began with the statement that \u2018it is forbidden\nto unnecessarily torment or roughly mishandle an animal\u2019. I do not intend\nto voice my own views on the ethics of food production here, but only\nto note that this much-bandied phrase \u2018cultural heritage\u2019 can include past,\npresent, and future practices that are arguably immoral, from the exploits\nof Alexander the Great to fox-hunting and page three of The Sun.3 This is so\n2 D. Lowenthal, The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1998), p. x.\n3 S . Peck, \u2018Why does a Tory MP think that getting your tits out is a \u201cNational Institution\u201d?\u2019,\nThe Telegraph, 10 December 2013, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10508530/\nBoobs-on-Page-3-Why-does-a-Tory-MP-think-that-getting-your-tits-out-is-a-national-\ninstitution.html (unless otherwise specified, all links cited in this volume were active on\n23 June 2014). Culture, Heritage, and Ethics 13\neven when the heritage in question is celebrated (I shall later look at cases of\nheritage that is perceived as being tainted).\nThough it may not be everybody\u2019s cup of tea, Jennie Bristow is right to\nclaim that \u2018page Three is as much a part of British culture as a cup of tea\u2019.4\nThe positive judgment implied is, however, questionable. Pace Bristow,\nbeing part of one\u2019s culture does not magically bestow a thing with positive\nvalue; it does not make it worthy of preservation. In the case in point, I\nbelieve we should regret that The Sun (let alone its third page) is part of\nour culture at all and take appropriate measures to change this state of\naffairs. But whatever one makes of this specific case, the point I wish to\nemphasise in this context is that even if anti-page-three campaigns were to\nprove successful, the page would remain part of British cultural heritage.\nHeritage matters, but removing something from one\u2019s culture does not\neliminate it from one\u2019s heritage. The acknowledgment of heritage forms\npart of the ethics of remembering, and it is important to remember both the\ngood and the bad, atrocities as well as achievements. But at times we also\nhave a duty to forget such things, for example when this is the best way\nof forging new relationships that avoid the perils of nostalgia. Lowenthal\nquotes a native American complaining that \u2018white people don\u2019t know what\nto remember and what to forget, what to let go of and what to preserve\u2019.5\nArguably, there is a corresponding right to be forgotten which in some\ncountries allows for criminal records to be erased once convictions are\nspent. The European Court of Justice has recently appealed to such a right\n(convincing or otherwise) in relation to online privacy.6\nThe duty to remember something is a duty to preserve it in memory,\nbe it individual or collective (such duties are frequently non-teleological\nin that they need not be driven by the prospect of some future good).\nThis obligation must not be conflated with a duty to preserve its actual\nexistence in the world. English Heritage\u2019s Sites of Memory, for example,\nmark the story of both the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition, including\ncontroversial benefactors such as Edward Colston (see Figures 1.1 and 1.2).\n4 J .

Culture, Heritage, and Ethics 15\nWe must not forget the legacies of those who accumulated vast wealth\nfrom the trade any more than we must forget the human beings who were\ntraded and the anti-slavery campaigners. Each has left their own mark on\nhistory, for better or worse.7\nThe distinction between what should be preserved and what is best\ngone (but not forgotten) rests on the reasons why we ought to remember.\nWhen Margaret Thatcher unveiled the English Heritage blue plaque for\nNancy Astor in 1987 (Figure 1.3), this was intended to honour Astor for\nbeing the first woman to take a seat in Parliament. The plaque scheme\nitself was introduced in 1866 by the (now Royal) Society of Arts with the\nambiguously-worded aim of increasing \u2018the public estimation for places\nwhich have been the abodes of men [sic] who have made England what it is\u2019.\nStrictly speaking, one may think that Astor\u2019s home should be remembered\nin this way without believing that she personally deserves any honour.\nFig. 1.3 English Heritage blue plaque for Nancy Astor.\nIt is impossible to codify the precise correct relation between past atrocities\nand present duties. There are sound reasons for wishing to preserve\nthe Roman Colosseum, but not the practices related to it. These reasons\nare largely aesthetic and historical, but are not primarily to do with\nremembrance. Our duty to preserve Auschwitz, by contrast, has nothing to\ndo with any architectural merit. The line of taste, in matters that we might\nterm \u2018atrocity heritage\u2019, is easily crossed however. For example, while\nwe should be doing much more to commemorate victims of rape, Jerzy\n7 http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places the-slave-trade-and-\nabolition/sites-of-memory 16 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nBohdan Szumczyk\u2019s life-sized sculpture Komm, Frau (\u2018Come, woman\u2019)\n\u2013 depicting a Russian soldier raping a heavily pregnant woman \u2013 is an\nextremely inappropriate way of doing so, even if its creator did intend\nit as a political statement condemning rape.8 Again, it is important to get\nright the reasons why it is inappropriate. It is one thing to agree with the\nPolish journalist Marek Gorlikowski that \u2018this type of monument is far\nfrom the way to commemorate the victims of rape\u2019 and quite another to\nagree with the Russian ambassador to Poland Alexander Alexeyev, when\nhe denounces the monument as having \u2018defiled the memory of 600,000\nSoviet servicemen who gave their lives in the fight for the freedom and\nthe independence of Poland\u2019.9 This may seem obvious, but it did not stop\nthe Huffington post from claiming that Gorlikowski\u2019s sentiments \u2018echoed\u2019\nthose of Alexeyev.10 There are no hard and fast rules about what counts as\nappropriate commemoration any more than there are about what counts\nas good art. But the fact that there is not one right way of commemorating\natrocities does not mean that all attempts are of equal merit.\nSome years ago, the white South African philosopher Samantha\nVice caused a stir by claiming that she was ashamed of being white.11\nSummarising her initial article, Vice writes that she \u2018explored the moral\nburden that whiteness places on us and was met by a similar outbreak\nof self-righteous outrage\u2019, suggesting that \u2018white people should cultivate\nhumility and silence, given their morally compromised position in the\ncontinuing racial and economic injustices of this country\u2019. She continues:\n[I]t is appropriate for whites to feel shame at their white identity, given its\ndestructive legacy and the way it continues to shape us.

Vice, \u2018Why my opinions on whiteness touched a nerve\u2019, 2 September 2011, http://\nmg.co.za/article/2011-09-02-why-my-opinions-on-whiteness-touched-a-nerve Culture, Heritage, and Ethics 17\nVice has been accused of being stupid, neurotic, self-hating, attention-\nseeking, and blinded by \u2018womanly political views\u2019. But her point was that\nwe must sometimes move beyond what we might call the heritage ethics of\nmemory. She writes:\nWe forget the vast background of institutions, state support and opportunities\nthat made our success possible; we forget that we do not develop in a\nvacuum or create ourselves ex nihilo. Apartheid\u2019s dubious gift to whites was\nthe chance to live comfortably, securely and with opportunities for creative\ndevelopment and worldly success. Apartheid cushioned whites at the\nexpense of making life very hard for others \u2013 and the effects of this injustice\nare still present \u2026 So, however attached whites are to this country \u2013 and part\nof my point is that, whether we admit it or not, we are fundamentally attached\nto its sad history and legacy \u2013 and however much we care for its success, we\nshouldn\u2019t feel completely comfortable. The refusal to acknowledge one\u2019s\nluck is a manifestation of the careless complacence and arrogance that make\nwhites feel entitled to these advantages \u2013 and convinced that their own\nefforts alone made their success possible.\nSometimes the sins of our parents should be inherited not only via\npreservation in memory, but through shame and activism.\n3. Heritage Rights from Feta to Burka\nIn the opening chapter of his classic 1961 study What Is History?, E.H. Carr\nrightly noted that not all facts and events are historical. Pope John Paul II\u2019s\n1997 visit to Cuba is a historical fact, but my own visit in 2006, alas, is not.\nWe might similarly ask why an object or event forms part of some heritage,\nbe it the world\u2019s, a specific nation\u2019s, or that of some other specified set\nof people. As with historical facts, such matters are not fixed across time.\nThere was a moment in time when it seemed to some that Oasis might\nbecome as central a part of British popular culture as The Beatles, but that\nmoment is long gone (Lowenthal is right in his assertion that we cannot\nsimply equate heritage with history).\nEven when we are confident in perceiving something as \u2018cultural\nheritage\u2019, how are we to decide to whom this belongs to? The question\nseems to imply that some people may have special (though typically not\nexclusive) ownership rights to it over others. There is an obvious (albeit\ntrivial) sense in which \u2018British Heritage\u2019 belongs to the British, but what\ndoes this actually translate to pragmatically? Do the British have some kind\nof special right to eat pork pies and photograph Westminster Abbey? It 18 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nis one thing to reserve the name \u2018Champagne\u2019 for products of a certain\ngeographical region and \u2018Feta\u2019 for those of another,12 but do the French have\na special right to champagne and the Eiffel Tower, the Greeks to Feta and\nthe Parthenon? And what about coffee, which we associate more with Italy\nthan the American and African countries which actually grow the beans?\nSuch questions are comic, in part because all heritage is universal in\nthe sense that we should all be free to access it if possible, if not always for\nfree. It is not always viable for everyone to access everything, or to do so\neasily and at little or no cost: nobody thinks that the people of Greece have\na right to free Feta cheese; by contrast it takes a libertarian like the Nestl\u00e9\nChairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe to deny that there is a universal right\nto free clean water.13 So this kind of rights-speech is really a misleading\nway of talking about access priorities. The criteria here are a mix of the\npractical and ideological: if only X amount of people can visit a monument\na year, should priority not be given to the local community? In some\ncountries locals pay a lower (or no) fare for entrance to sites than other\nvisitors do. These others, or \u2018other others\u2019, used to be called tourists, viz.\nthey who tour around. But the word has become pejorative and sites are\nincreasingly opting for the gentler \u2013 less discriminatory \u2013 term \u2018visitors\u2019.\nBut the policy of giving preferential rates to local residents is not always\nlimited to \u2018visitor sites\u2019. In Egypt, for example, this policy extends to\ncommodities like hotel rooms. And everywhere we have import taxes. In\nthe case of transportable physical objects the key access issue is that of\nlocation, location, location. Unfortunately, questions about access priorities\nare typically overshadowed by legal and ethical concerns about ownership,\nas in the case of the Parthenon sculptures.\nCultural heritage rights \u2013 be they moral and/or legal \u2013 are rarely human\nrights, but there are exceptions. So, while it is absurd to view the right to\nhave free or affordable access to French cinema as a human right, if there is\na right to wear a burka (be it for religious or cultural reasons), this will be\na human right. The issue is certainly not one of limited availability. Unlike\n12 See, for example: \u2018Greece wins exclusive rights to market Feta in Canada\u2019, 18 October\n2013, http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_18/10/2013_523829\n13 Nestl\u00e9 have since changed their official position, though it is difficult not to adopt a\ncynical stance towards such revisionary \u2018clarifications\u2019: http://www.nestle.com/aboutus/\nask-nestle/answers/nestle-chairman-peter-brabeck-letmathe-believes-water-is-a-\nhuman-right Culture, Heritage, and Ethics 19\nsome moral rights, all human rights ought to be legal rights. Cultural\nheritage rights, then, do not necessarily deserve legislative support. This\nwill largely depend on their importance. We may wish to give certain\ngroups of people near-absolute legal rights to burkas, and priority access\nto the pyramids, but no special right whatsoever to, say, caviar.\nWhere there are rights there are also duties, such as those of preservation,\nin memory or actuality. These too will be constrained by resources such\nas space, money, manpower, time, and so on. Mistakes of judgment, here\nas elsewhere, are inevitable. A salient example is that of the BBC prior to\nthe Heritage Collection initiative. The Heritage Collection gathers radio and\ntelevision productions, artwork, props, and paraphernalia. These have\nbeen largely compiled from personal collections, bequests by former staff,\nand the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt (a public appeal to recover pre-1980s\nproductions that had been lost) as until then the BBC had a questionable\npolicy of wiping old videotapes for re-use, with no apparent realisation of\ntheir historical significance.\nUnfortunately, practical issues frequently end up bringing heritage\nconcerns too close for comfort to those of the tourist industry. Tristan Platt\nhas expressed this worry well:\n\u2026 the funding of Bolivian Worlds by Lufthansa, and of Madagascar, Island\nof the Ancestors by Air Madagascar (both airlines clearly interested in\nboosting their tourist bookings to each country), \u2026 reminded me of the\nuncomfortable continuum between ethnography and the travel-brochure \u2026\nCould I persuade myself that these artefacts were in fact to be perceived as\n\u2018ambassadors\u2019 of their peoples to the English capital of Britain?\nThis passage serves as a stark reminder of the multiple national and\ncommercial interests which lie behind claims to heritage. Separating these\nfrom ethical concerns has become as difficult to manage in practice as it is easy\nto do in theory. But some degrees of compromise are more acceptable than\nothers. When people like Brabeck-Letmathe make statements such as \u2018access\nto water is not a public right\u201914 and shorelines become increasingly open to\ncommercial development, we should consider carefully the increasingly\nclose connection between commerce and heritage. As the heritage industry\ngrows, there is a serious danger that it will purchase anything of value and\nsell access to it at rates that only the privileged few can afford.\n14 See note 13 above. 20 Cultural Heritage Ethics\n4. Outro\nGiven the range of questions and complexities surrounding heritage, I am\nsceptical about the possibility of a unified account of it.15 Heritage, cultural\nor otherwise, is not always good. It may be preserved in fundamentally\ndifferent, indeed contradictory, ways. The range of rights relating to it is by\nno means a straightforward one. This elucidatory essay has been written\nwith the faith that \u2018a repertoire might be more useful than a conviction\u2019.16\nThis is not to say that we do not even know what cultural heritage ethics is,\nbut only that exploring these concepts is an integral part of it. I have barely\nsketched what even a partial conceptual cartography of the area might look\nlike. Nonetheless, I hope to have marked some of the numerous pitfalls\nwhich face the bolder theorist.\n15 Cf. L. Smith, The Uses of Heritage (London: Routledge, 2006), ch. 1.\n16 Adam Phillips, On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored (London: Faber and Faber, 1993), p. xvi. 2. Poppy Politics: Remembrance\nof Things Present\nJames Fox\nIn October 2011 the English football association requested permission\nfrom FIFA (the International Football Federation) for its national team to\nwear poppies on their shirts when they played Spain the following month.\nPoppies had been worn across Britain every November for the best part of\na century, having been an integral part of the nation\u2019s remembrance of its\nwar dead since 1921. FIFA, however, was unmoved by such traditions, and\nimmediately rejected the request. In an official statement the organisation\nasserted that in line with its existing regulations, players\u2019 equipment could\nnot \u2018carry any political, religious or commercial messages\u2019 for fear that they\nwould \u2018jeopardise the neutrality of football\u2019.1\nThe decision triggered an outcry. The British press published a series of\nenraged editorials, and before long politicians took up the cause as well. On\nTuesday 8 November the government\u2019s sports minister Hugh Robertson\ntold FIFA that the poppy was \u2018not religious or political in any way\u2019. Later\nthat day Prime Minister David Cameron declared that it was \u2018absurd\u2019 to\nthink that \u2018wearing a poppy to remember those who have given their lives\nfor our freedom is a political act\u2019. And only hours after that, Prince William\nwrote directly to FIFA, stating that the poppy was a \u2018universal symbol of\nremembrance\u2019 with \u2018no political, religious or commercial connotations\u2019.2\n1 FIFA, \u2018Regulation 54.1\u2019, Equipment Regulations, 1 April 2010, http://www.fifa.com/\naboutfifa/officialdocuments/doclists/laws.html\n2 \u2018Prince William demands Fifa u-turn on poppy ban\u2019, BBC News, 9 November 2011, http://\nwww.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15643295\n\u00a9 James Fox, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.02 22 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nUnder ever increasing pressure, FIFA \u2013 whose reputation had barely\nrecovered from a recent corruption scandal \u2013 quickly capitulated. On\nWednesday 9 November it gave permission for poppies to be worn,\nwith the proviso that they were attached to black armbands rather than\nembroidered directly onto players\u2019 shirts.3 Yet when the match was played\nthree days later, poppies were not just restricted to armbands: a poppy\nwreath was placed on the pitch before kick-off; players wore poppy-\nembroidered training tops and poppy-embossed anthem jackets; poppies\nwere attached to scoreboards and advertising hoardings; and poppy-sellers\nwere positioned in conspicuous locations around the stadium.4\nThe debacle is a highly revealing case study in cultural heritage for\ntwo reasons. First, it showed that in less than a century, Remembrance\nhad established itself as such a powerful cultural force that any challenge\nto it \u2013 however trivial it may have seemed \u2013 had the potential to cause a\nnational furore. Second, the incident indicated that most Britons considered\nRemembrance to be a resolutely apolitical practice \u2013 little more than an\nethical duty to the dead. This chapter, however, will take issue with these\nsentiments. By exploring the origins, development and current heritage\nrhetoric surrounding the remembrance poppy, I will demonstrate that the\npoppy has always been, and continues to be, a profoundly political symbol.\n***\nMost accounts of the remembrance poppy begin in the spring of 1915. The\nfirst winter of the Great War was just winding to a close, and the battlefields\nof the Western front were wastelands. Pastures had been turned to mud,\nwildlife had all but been obliterated, and underneath the agitated earth\nlay the bodies of countless dead servicemen. Nevertheless, as the weather\nimproved through April and May of that year, something unexpected\nhappened: red corn poppies began to bloom in huge numbers across the\nfields. It is believed, somewhat ironically, that the season\u2019s unusually\nabundant crop had been germinated by the very bombardments that had\nwreaked so much natural damage elsewhere.\nPoppies, of course, had long possessed symbolic properties. Since\nantiquity they had been associated with sleep, death and resurrection. So\n3 F IFA, \u2018Statement on England shirts and the use of the poppy\u2019, 5 November 2011,\nhttp://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/media/news/newsid=1537881/index.html\n4 \u2018 FA Statement: Remembrance Day\u2019, 9 November 2011, http://englandfans.thefa.com/ef/\npages/news.aspx?id=207e49d4-327a-4d92-b4d3-47bbf126d54c Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present 23\nwhen one amateur poet saw the flower blossoming across Flanders, he set\nabout reconfiguring its ancient connotations for the new wartime context.\nLieutenant Colonel John McCrae was a Canadian medical officer serving\nin Ypres. He first noticed the region\u2019s poppies in May 1915 while burying a\nfriend who had been killed in action. Shortly afterwards, McCrae composed\na poem, which he called In Flanders Fields.5 The poem appeared later that\nyear in Punch magazine, and before long was widely known and admired.\nInspired by the funeral he had just attended, McCrae started the poem by\njuxtaposing the death of men with the birth of the poppies:\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\nThat mark out place; and in the sky\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\nMcCrae\u2019s intention was clear. Like many poets before him, he was invoking\npastoral imagery as an antithesis to the war. It is in fact tempting to read\nhis poppies as pacifistic symbols: of nature defeating man, peace defeating\nwar, and life defeating death. This interpretation, however, is dramatically\ndisproved by reading on. In the second verse, McCrae establishes the poem\nas the voice of the dead, and then, in the third and final verse, he recounts\nthe message they wish to communicate to the living:\nTake up our quarrel with the foe;\nTo you from failing hands we throw\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high,\nIf ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders fields.\nIt is, by any reasoning, an abrupt shift in tone, for it is here that an\ninitially elegiac text is transformed into something altogether more\nbelligerent. McCrae\u2019s interred soldiers are, after all, calling on the living\nto avenge their deaths. For this reason, his poem does not condemn war\nbut legitimises it; does not demand the conflict to end but demands that\n5 F or the full and often disputed story behind the poem, see John F. Prescott, In Flanders\nFields: The Story of John McCrae (Erin, ON: Boston Mills Press, 1985). 24 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nit continues; and though McCrae mourns the loss of life, he calls for yet\nmore sacrifice to come.\nJohn McCrae\u2019s In Flanders Fields is responsible for first establishing\nthe cultural connection between poppies and the Great War. However,\nits author deployed the former as a smokescreen behind which he could\nlegitimise the latter. Written early in the war when hopes were still high,\nvolunteers were still needed, and the outcome of the conflict was far from\ndecided, his poem was little more than a propagandistic recruitment call.6\nIt is therefore hardly surprising that his words \u2013 and his poppy imagery\n\u2013 were soon enlisted in North America and Great Britain to sell war bonds\nand recruit volunteers. The poppy\u2019s wartime origins were nowhere near as\npeaceful as we often like to think.\nIf anyone was responsible for converting McCrae\u2019s propagandistic\npoppy into today\u2019s remembrance poppy, it was the American academic\nand humanitarian Moina Michael. Michael had read In Flanders Fields as\nthe allies were finalising their victory in November 1918, and she was\nconvinced that the conflict\u2019s outcome had vindicated its author\u2019s rallying\ncry. She even went so far as to draft a poem in response to McCrae\u2019s\ninterred soldiers, writing that the victors had \u2018caught the torch\u2019 that they\nhad thrown and \u2018kept the faith\u2019 when others had lost it. So while her\npoem may well be a heartfelt salute to the dead, it is also a defence of their\nsacrifice: Michael, in short, was implying that the war\u2019s many casualties\nwere justified because they had been in the service of victory. And that is\nwhy her poem, though now called We Shall Keep the Faith, was referred to\nby contemporaries as The Victory Emblem.7\nShortly after composing The Victory Emblem, Michael purchased twenty-\nfive silk poppies at a New York department store and distributed them\nin honour of the dead. Her memorial flowers soon caught on around the\nworld: from the United States in November 1918, they arrived in France in\nOctober 1920, and Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain in\n1921. Tellingly, all of these countries were victors. The poppy never found\nits way into the cultural practices of the war\u2019s defeated nations, and that\nmay be because the only men whose sacrifice was believed to deserve such\na symbol were those who had fought on the \u2018right\u2019 side. Poppies, in other\n6 A n example of this interpretation is found in Paul Fussell, The Great War and Modern\nMemory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), pp. 248-50.\n7 S ee Moina Michael, The Miracle Flower: The Story of the Flanders Field Memorial Poppy\n(Philadelphia, PA: Dorrance and Co., 1941). Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present 25\nwords, had been converted into victory medals. And if doubts still linger\nover the partisan politics of the memorial poppy, one only need name the\nperson who introduced it to Britain: Field Marshall Douglas Haig \u2013 a man\nwho had a vested interest in justifying the conflict to whose victory he had\nso controversially contributed.\nThe first part of this chapter has proved that it is far from easy to claim\nthat the remembrance poppy was born out of a universal and apolitical\nheritage moment. It was conceived when the war was still young and when\nvolunteers still had to be recruited; it was deployed during the following\nthree years to mobilise, raise morale, and legitimise the increasingly\nunpopular conflict; and in the war\u2019s aftermath it was reformulated as a\nsymbol that commemorated the Allied dead precisely as it celebrated\nthe Allied victory. And thus, for all of its pacifistic associations today, the\npoppy was a thoroughly bellicose symbol from the start: a medal of honour\nas well as a bleeding wound. But these associations did not expire with the\nconflict. In the decades after the end of the Great War, the poppy acquired\nyet more political significance, and yet more public prominence.\nOne way to demonstrate the poppy\u2019s growing popularity through the\ndecades is to examine the statistics for the Royal British Legion\u2019s annual\npoppy appeal. They reveal that its campaign has raised ever-increasing\nsums across the century of its existence, from \u00a3106,000 in 1921 to a\nstaggering \u00a340 million in 2011. These figures suggest that despite receding\never further into the past, the rituals of remembrance that originated with\nthe First World War are more relevant than ever. The question that remains\nis why? Why, after so much else has happened, after so many other seminal\nevents have come and gone, do the British people remain so fixated on the\nFlanders poppy? The answer, I think, lies less in the wars of the past than it\ndoes in the wars of the present.\nThe British Legion\u2019s statistics show that its poppy appeals have nearly\nalways been more successful when they have taken place during ongoing\nconflicts. The pattern began with the Second World War. Through the 1920s\nand most of the 1930s, the British Legion\u2019s campaign income had grown\nonly modestly. In the war years, however, that figure almost doubled,\nfrom \u00a3578,188 in 1938 to over \u00a31 million in 1945. A comparable leap, of\nalmost twenty percent, was recorded between 1981 and 1982, during the\nFalklands War; and there was another substantial increase between 1989\n(\u00a311.9 million) and 1991 (\u00a313.1 million), the years that spanned the first\nGulf War. More recently, figures have followed the same trend. At the very 26 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nbeginning of the millennium, poppy appeal income remained relatively\nstatic at between \u00a320 million and \u00a321 million each year; in the second half\nof the decade, when major wars were being fought in both Afghanistan and\nIraq, that number virtually doubled, to \u00a340 million.8\nThe Royal British Legion\u2019s figures should not be surprising. After all,\nits poppy appeal commemorates those who have died in all modern and\nongoing conflicts, and its funds support active servicemen and living\nveterans. Moreover, in order to boost its public relevance and thus its\nfinancial success, the organisation makes frequent and explicit connections\nbetween the remembrance of past wars and the honouring of present ones.\nIn one official statement, it claimed the following:\nWe remember those who fought for our freedom during the two World Wars.\nBut we also mourn and honour those who have lost their lives in more recent\nconflicts. Today, with troops on duty in Afghanistan and other trouble spots\naround the world, Remembrance \u2026 [is] \u2026 as important as ever.9\nThe sentiment is doubtless honourable, and the British Legion\u2019s fund-\nraising figures confirm that it has also been highly effective. Nevertheless,\nat the same time the passage suggests that the poppy has become a\nproblematic nexus in which past and present, poetry and policy, are\nuneasily intertwined.\nIn recent years, the poppy\u2019s linkage between past wars and present wars\nhas proved particularly controversial. With the outbreak of unpopular\nconflicts like those in Afghanistan and Iraq, many Britons came to question\nthe political role that the poppy appeared to be playing. Some claimed that\nby connecting the \u2018justifiable\u2019 world wars of the past to the \u2018unjustifiable\u2019\nanti-terrorist wars of the present, the poppy enabled the former to legitimise\nthe latter. In November 2010 a group of six veterans, who had between\nthem served in Northern Ireland, Dhofar, the Falklands, Macedonia,\nAfghanistan and Iraq, went so far as to write a letter to the British press:\nThe poppy appeal is once again subverting Armistice Day. A day that should\nbe about peace and remembrance is turned into a month-long drum roll of\nsupport for current wars \u2026 The public are being urged to wear a poppy\nin support of \u2018our Heroes\u2019 \u2026 There is nothing heroic about fighting in an\nunnecessary conflict.10\n8 These figures were given to me by the Royal British Legion.\n9 The Royal British Legion, \u2018The Nation Remembers\u2019, http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/\nremembrance/the-nation-remembers/\n10 \u2018Poppies and \u201cHeroes\u201d\u2019, The Guardian, 5 November 2010, http://www.guardian.co.uk/\nuk/2010/nov/05/poppies-and-heroes-remembrance-day Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present 27\nThis view became so widespread that in the following November the\ninfluential \u2018Stop the War Coalition\u2019 re-introduced white poppies as an\nalternative to red poppies. While the red poppy marked only British\nmilitary casualties, the white poppy \u2013 with its traditionally pacifistic\nconnotations \u2013 commemorated all humans who had died as a result of all\nconflicts, as an anti-war symbol.11\nThe anti-war criticisms of the poppy are not always entirely accurate.\nThe assertion that remembrance was initially about peace and was only\nrecently \u2018subverted\u2019 is contradicted by the poppy\u2019s bellicose origins;\nsimilarly, the claim that British politicians \u2018hijacked\u2019 the symbol to justify\ntheir own wars remains difficult to prove.12 After all, the British Legion \u2013\nwhich administers the poppy appeal \u2013 remains steadfastly independent of\ngovernment. Nevertheless, the very fact that these debates have occurred\nis proof that the poppy has acquired a raft of controversial political\nassociations. They also reflect the fact that, whether by design or not,\nthe poppy has indeed emboldened the warmongers\u2019 cause: for how can\none honour the men and women who have died in war and not end up\nendorsing the conflicts in which they have fought?\nThe poppy is now such a pregnant symbol of heritage that its ideological\nreverberations have spread far beyond debates about the legitimacy of\nindividual conflicts; they have come to invade and influence the many fault-\nlines elsewhere in British society. Immigrant groups, particularly Muslims,\nhave started to reject the poppy as a symbol of western imperialism. At one\ndemonstration in November 2010, the group \u2018Muslims against Crusades\u2019\neven went to the lengths of burning a large model poppy as the rest of\nthe nation entered its annual two-minute silence.13 At the same time, right-\nwing groups like the British National Party and the English Defence League\nhave appropriated the poppy as a symbol of militant nationalism. Indeed,\nfollowing FIFA\u2019s refusal to permit English footballers to wear poppies in\n2011, two members of the English Defence League climbed on to the roof of\n11 \u2018Stop the War bids to reclaim 11.11.11 Remembrance Day for peace\u2019, 6 November 2011,\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20120312083217/http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/united-\nkingdom/920-reclaiming-111111-remembrance-day-for-peace-not-war\n12 These arguments were made by the Master of the Queen\u2019s Music, Sir Peter Maxwell\nDavies. \u2018Remembrance Sunday: Queen\u2019s composer says he will boycott poppies\u2019, The\nTelegraph, 14 November 2010, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8132185/\nRemembrance-Sunday-Queens-composer-says-he-will-boycott-poppies.html\n13 A.

Here, the\nBritish Army has been a divisive institution for decades, having played an\noften violent role in policing clashes between Unionists and Nationalists\nsince 1969. For this reason, the high-profile commemoration of British\nservicemen has only intensified the rancour between the two groups. Most\nNationalists consider the poppy to be deeply offensive because, as Revd\nTomas Walsh has claimed, many of the soldiers it honours had \u2018colluded\nwith loyalist murder squads \u2026 and killed hundreds of innocent Irish\npeople\u2019.15 In fact, Remembrance has been such an inflammatory symbol of\nBritish power in Ireland that in 1987 the Irish Republican Army targeted\nit specifically, detonating a bomb at the Enniskillen war memorial on\nRemembrance Sunday and killing twelve people. Yet in Northern Ireland\nthe poppy means much more than simply an attitude to the British army;\nit has become a powerful marker of identity in a region where identity\nis so fiercely contested: Unionists embrace it as an emblem of Britishness,\nProtestantism and Monarchism, while Nationalists reject it as an assertion\nof their Irishness, Catholicism and Republicanism.\nPoppies do not only mediate identity at the political extremes; they\nare custodians of national heritage and identity in the mainstream as\nwell. The paper flower may well remind British people of the nation\u2019s\ndarkest moments, but it also reminds them of the nation\u2019s finest moments:\nthe hard-won victories of the First World War; the Battle of Britain; the\nD-Day landings \u2013 all of which have become integral components of British\nnational identity. This is surely why, when politicians defended the poppy\nfollowing FIFA\u2019s initial ruling, their phrases were soaked in such patriotism.\nImmediately after claiming that the poppy was not political \u2018in any way\u2019,\nthe government\u2019s sport minister Hugh Robertson declared that it was\nnonetheless \u2018a display of national pride, just like wearing your country\u2019s\nfootball shirt\u2019.16 His argument was as perplexing as it was revealing, not least\n14 \u2018Poppy row: English Defence League climb onto roof of FIFA HQ\u2019, The Mirror, 9\nNovember 2011, http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/poppy-row-english-defence-\nleague-277327\n15 Revd Tomas Walsh, \u2018Lest we forget who they honour\u2019, Irish Independent, 14 November 2007,\nhttp://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/lest-we-forget-who-they-honour-1218939.\nhtml\n16 \u2018Prince William demands Fifa u-turn on poppy ban\u2019, BBC News, 9 November 2011, http://\nwww.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15643295 Poppy Politics: Remembrance of Things Present 29\nbecause it is patently incorrect to think of \u2018national pride\u2019 as an apolitical\nsentiment. Moreover, by likening poppies to football shirts Robertson was\nimplying that the former, like the latter, was the uniform of a patriotic and\ncompetitive team that its supporters cheered on at the expense of others.\nHis words thus endorsed what they had intended to refute: that beneath a\nthin fa\u00e7ade of universal grief and quiet humility, the poppy remained the\nred badge of a belligerent nationalism.\nThe FIFA scandal reveals one more political dimension of the poppy:\nthat much-pilloried bugbear of political correctness. In recent years\npoppy-wearing has become an increasingly ubiquitous cultural practice.\nIn Britain, television presenters rarely appear on camera without them\nin the month of November; politicians have started wearing them earlier\nand earlier every year (and have at times been humiliated by doing so\nbefore the official start of the British Legion\u2019s appeal); and as the FIFA row\ndemonstrated, even sportsmen now seem unable to compete without them.\nThe last development is particularly recent: indeed, when the English\nfootball team played Brazil at the same time in November two years earlier,\nthe poppies that in 2011 seemed so essential were neither requested nor\nworn. It is, then, only in the last few years that poppies have fully tightened\ntheir grip on British cultural life. While this ubiquity is undeniably good\nnews for the Royal British Legion, it does cast some doubt on the politics\nof Remembrance. It is not only that in such a climate individuals might\nwear poppies for performative rather than contemplative reasons; it is also\nthat the increasingly obligatory nature of poppy-wearing sits uneasily with\nthe \u2018freedom\u2019 for which the wars it commemorates were allegedly fought.\nIndeed, one disgruntled British journalist famously described the pressure\nto fall into line as nothing short of \u2018poppy fascism\u2019.17\nThis brief essay has shown that in spite of the many claims to the\ncontrary, the poppy is a potent political symbol. It was born out of a desire\nto promote, prolong and propagandise the Great War, and in the conflict\u2019s\naftermath it was reconfigured as a medal of triumph that celebrated the\nAllied victory. As the First World War receded into the past, the poppy\nacquired affiliations with the agendas of succeeding governments, and\nin the new millennium it is believed to have helped legitimise unpopular\n17 Paul Revoir, \u2018I won\u2019t surrender to \u201cPoppy Fascism\u201d: C4 News host Jon Snow refuses to\nbow to viewer demand to wear the emblem\u2019, Daily Mail, 3 November 2010, http://www.\ndailymail.co.uk/news/article-1326063/Jon-Snow-poppy-fascism-row-C4-News-host-\nrefuses-surrender.html 30 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nconflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet the poppy\u2019s political connotations\nhave spread far beyond war. In an increasingly diverse Britain, it has\nbeen violently appropriated and violently rejected as fringe groups define\nthemselves for and against mainstream British values. Conversely, in the\nmainstream itself the poppy has become a focus for patriotic sentiments\nthat cannot easily be expressed in other ways. Finally, this essay has shown\nthat in recent years, Remembrance has strengthened its grip on the nation\u2019s\ncultural practices. In the process, poppy-wearing has become as much\nabout political correctness and public performance as it has been about the\nremembrance of the dead. The poppy\u2019s meanings have evidently changed\nsince John McCrae saw it blossoming in the fields of Flanders, but that little\nred flower continues to feed off the carnage of a catastrophic century. 3. The Meaning of the Public\nin an Age of Privatisation\nBenjamin Ramm\nAnd we rebuild our cities, not dream of islands.\nW.H. Auden, \u2018Paysage Moralis\u00e9\u2019\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times in 1981, Margaret Thatcher declared\nher intention: \u2018Economics are the method; the object is to change the heart and\nsoul\u2019. The culture of competition that drove the New Right\u2019s revolution may\nnot have altered our souls, but it did change how we perceive ourselves, at\nleast in relation to our fellow citizens. This chapter will explore how aspects\nof civic culture have taken on radical meaning in the age of neoliberalism,\nand consider how we can rediscover the \u2018civic soul\u2019.\nTo diagnose the crisis of the public, it is necessary to understand why,\nin recent decades, the private has become the dominant sphere of meaning.\nThe radical ideas harnessed by the New Right were incubated during the\nsocial upheavals of the twentieth century, prompted by democracy and\ncatalysed by technology. As trust in elites declined, the civic notions\nassociated with Victorian society, such as duty and sacrifice, came to be\nregarded as (self-) deceptions: at best na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2013 the \u2018delusion\u2019 of altruism \u2013 at\nworst coercion, the reinforcing of existing social hierarchies. The notion of\na \u2018public\u2019 consensus was rejected as an imposition of elite order, inculcated\nby an educational system based on deference. Instead of nurturing curiosity\n\u00a9 Benjamin Ramm, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.03 32 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nand critical thinking, schools were accused of narrowing and disciplining;\nof creating subjects \u2013 \u2018another brick in the wall\u2019 \u2013 rather than citizens.\nAgainst this austere and conformist public culture, the \u2018private\u2019\nrepresented a realm of sincerity and self-expression. Auden himself had\npined for an Age of Intimacy: \u2018Private faces in public places / Are wiser\nand nicer / Than public faces in private places\u2019. Moreover, it was becoming\nclear that bureaucracy \u2013 the promise of a rational public system, in Saint-\nSimon\u2019s words, \u2018replacing the government of persons by the administration\nof things\u2019 \u2013 had failed: state socialism and state capitalism alike had proved\nnot to be a political science. Bureaucracy promised to liberate society from\nthe unpredictability of politics and the drudgery of a mechanised economy,\nbut its systems created their own unforeseen irrationalities, and a degree of\nalienation and monotony as extreme as that produced by the unregulated\nmarket. Against the \u2018hegemony of the public\u2019, embodied by an oppressive\nstate architecture, the private became the domain of the human: individual\nand consensual.\nThe term \u2018revolution\u2019 is overused in the political context; rarely does\nit signify \u2018the world turned upside down\u2019. Yet in relocating meaning\naway from the public realm, the New Right overthrew the central tenet\nof Enlightenment thought: that we find meaning in our interaction with,\nand commitment to, the civic. The historical development of the \u2018public\u2019, a\nsphere of free association and exchange, altered the perception of individual\nidentity and emphasised the social aspect of liberation: far from being a\nsolipsistic pursuit \u2013 the monastic cultivation of the soul for salvation \u2013 self-\nrealisation demanded civic emancipation. At the core of this vision was a\ngenerational optimism, formulated by Hegel and celebrated by Trotsky:\nMan will become immeasurably stronger, wiser, and subtler; his body will\nbecome more harmonized, his movements more rhythmic, his voice more\nmusical. The forms of life will become dynamically dramatic. The average\nhuman type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx. And\nabove this ridge new peaks will rise.1\nThis renewed interest in the civic drew the theorists of the Enlightenment\nback to the classical models from which citizenship derived. For the ancient\nGreeks, declining to take part in public life was a mark of dishonour and\n1 Leon Trotsky, Literature and Revolution (1924), ed. William Keach, trans. Rose Strunsky\n(Chicago, IL: Haymarket, 2005), p. 207. The Meaning of the Public in an Age of Privatisation 33\na sign of immaturity. The word \u2018idiot\u2019 is derived from the Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\n[idi\u014dt\u0113s], denoting \u2018a private citizen\u2019, one concerned primarily with his or\nher own affairs. (Pericles, the great leader of democratic Athens, famously\ncastigated this self-centred attitude: \u2018We do not say that a man who takes no\ninterest in politics minds his own business; we say that he has no business\nhere at all\u2019). The public is itself a vehicle of maturation: to go \u2018into society\u2019\nis to mark a coming of age, in which we learn to negotiate our desires, to\nmediate our self in relation to other selves. As consumers, however, we\nbehave privately even in public, seeking to satisfy our particular taste. The\nuniversality at the heart of the civic ideal does not appeal to the consumer,\nfor whom individuality (or at least the perception thereof) is preferable\nto uniformity. The New Right succeeded in transforming this desire for\nindividuality into an ethic of individualism. By conflating \u2018equality and\nregimentation\u2019, Thatcher was able to argue against the central tenet of\nthe Enlightenment \u2013 universality \u2013 by employing the rallying cry of the\nEnlightenment: liberation. With the crisis of capitalism of the 1970s, both the\nNew Right and the statist Left set up a dichotomy \u2013 the state against the\nindividual \u2013 that elided the role of the civic:\nThey\u2019re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such\nthing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are\nfamilies. And no government can do anything except through people, and\npeople must look to themselves first. It\u2019s our duty to look after ourselves and\nthen, also to look after our neighbour.2\nUltimately, Thatcher\u2019s radicalism was less about the privatisation of public\namenities than the suppression of the civic imagination. In 2009, Editorial\nIntelligence \u2013 \u2018an intelligent knowledge networking business which runs an\nagenda-setting opinion former network\u2019 \u2013 launched an annual \u2018residential\nexperiential\u2019 weekend event called \u2018Names Not Numbers\u2019. This \u2018thought\nleader symposium\u2019 bills itself as \u2018a private ideas festival\u2019, the buzzword of\nwhich is \u2018individuality\u2019. The notion of a \u2018private idea\u2019 would have disturbed\nthe Enlightenment mind, with its commitment to what Kant called \u2018the\npublic use of one\u2019s reason\u2019. But for the organisers of this event, the general\npublic \u2013 those counted only as \u2018Numbers\u2019 \u2013 are insufficiently bespoke:\n\u2018Names\u2019 are a discerning elite. (Sponsors of the festival include Jaguar and\n2 Interview with Margaret Thatcher, \u2018Aids, education and the year 2000!\u2019, Woman\u2019s Own,\n31 October 1987, http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106689 34 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThe Groucho Club). So it is with audacity, and seemingly without irony,\nthat one strand at the 2013 festival was titled: \u2018How Can Politics Reconnect\nto People?\u2019\n***\nthe dark backward and abysm of time.\nShakespeare, The Tempest\nPrevious ages romanticised the old, whereas ours lusts after the new.\nPlanned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence have accelerated our\never-increasing appetite for technology, and transformed our attitude\ntowards production: that which is new is regarded \u2013 by the very nature of\nits newness \u2013 as superior, as if new culture, like the technology it produces,\nhad incorporated all the wisdom of the old. In a culture in which knowledge\nis reduced to the status of information \u2013 data, to be sorted according to its\nutility \u2013 earlier civilisations are viewed as merely unplanned obsolescence,\nwhose extinction is a mark of their irrelevance. If capitalism has, in Marx\u2019s\nwords, \u2018accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman\naqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals\u2019, it has also \u2018drowned the most heavenly\necstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine\nsentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation\u2019.3 The baggy,\nmessy civilisations of the past are co-opted into the market of things, but\nfail to compete with modernism\u2019s zeal for creative destruction:\nCome on! set fire to the library shelves!

The Meaning of the Public in an Age of Privatisation 35\nfailing to comprehend the nature of culture, which is a social life made\npossible by the fulfilment of basic needs (\u2018Our basest beggars / Are in the\npoorest thing superfluous: / Allow not nature more than nature needs, /\nMan\u2019s life is cheap as beast\u2019s\u2019).5 Civic culture is a challenge to utilitarian\nassumptions because it knows that use is not the same as value: indeed,\nculture has value in part because it comprehends a world beyond use,\nwhere truths are uneconomic and inefficient. That which has little utility\nmay have great value: \u2018poetry makes nothing happen\u2019, wrote Auden, but it\nis \u2018a way of happening, a mouth\u2019.\nThe term \u2018Capitalist Realism\u2019 has been coined to describe the triumph of\nTINA \u2013 \u2018There Is No Alternative\u2019 \u2013 and the capture of the civic and political\nimagination by consumer capitalism. In the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019, with\nits division of \u2018intelligent\u2019 [useful] and unintelligent [useless] knowledge,\nthe non-capitalist world becomes a museum, and museums are regarded\nas relics, curiosities. Yet it is precisely this \u2018irrelevance\u2019 \u2013 the assertion\nof non-exchange value, outside the profit-motive \u2013 that transforms the\nmuseum into a potential locus of radicalism. At its best, the museum offers\nan imaginative alternative to the totalitarianism of \u2018Capitalist Realism\u2019,\nwhich dismisses other ways of organising and valuing the world. The\nmuseum is an epistemological affront to capitalism, as it validates the\n\u2018useless\u2019 and offers an encounter with objects that cannot be bought, that\nlie outside the realm of economic aspiration, that have taken on a value \u2013\nincomprehensible to capitalist assumptions \u2013 beyond their rate of exchange.\nThe museum rekindles a civic aspiration for acculturation rather than\nacquisition, against the New Right\u2019s appropriation of \u2018self-improvement\u2019\nas solely material advancement. It provides a rare public space in which\nthe individual behaves primarily as a citizen rather than a consumer, and\nin which s/he recognises citizenship as a shared identity. It is for this reason\nthat entry charges ought to be resisted: museums contest the privatisation\nof value, and should seek to minimise the degree to which citizen relations\nare mediated by money. If, as Adorno argued, art imagines a totality that\nthe fragmented world cannot \u2013 a utopian possibility in formal perfection \u2013\nthen the institutions of culture must offer a glimpse of a society unfractured\nby inequality.\nThe dissolution of a civic \u2018consensus\u2019 is a key aspect of the culture of\npostmodernity, and a primary cause of scepticism about curation. This\nis understandable: curators, as gatekeepers and educators, have been\n5 William Shakespeare, King Lear, II.ii.453-56, ed. R.A. Foakes (London: Arden, 1997), p. 255. 36 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nresponsible for telling a selective story of civilisation. But in an age of\nconsumer democracy, curators can be invaluable: we need their cura (\u2018care,\nheed, attention\u2019) in navigating the flood of knowledge from the digital world.\nConsumer democracy purports to offer \u2018choice\u2019 but its market parameters\nare often mandated by monopolistic corporations, which scupper diversity\nand accentuate simplicity. \u2018Choice\u2019 remains the clarion call of the New\nRight, whose populism conflates the notion of cultural elitism \u2013 \u2018the best\nwhich has been thought and said\u2019 \u2013 with an elite. (A different elite, of course,\nthan the financial class created by the New Right\u2019s reforms). The corporate\ncalculator assumes the lowest common denominator of Benthamism, which\ncan only comprehend value in terms of instant gratification:\nThe utility of all these arts and sciences \u2013 I speak both of those of amusement\nand curiosity \u2013 the value which they possess, is exactly in proportion to\nthe pleasure they yield. Every other species of pre-eminence which may be\nattempted to be established among them is altogether fanciful. Prejudice\napart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of\nmusic and poetry. If the game of push-pin furnish more pleasure, it is more\nvaluable than either. Everybody can play at push-pin: poetry and music are\nrelished only by a few.6\nIn contrast, museums affirm the virtues of enrichment: a slower, more\narduous process, but one with the prospect of sweeter fruits. Yet museums\noften seem reticent about asserting their cultural importance, wary of\nmaking value judgments in a climate of relativism, and instead justify\nthemselves in terms of social utility. As Peter Jenkinson, the founding\ndirector of Creative Partnerships, claimed: \u2018Suddenly we are able to think\nthat museums and galleries are not sad, marginal locations of dust and\ndecay and heritage gloom, but alive and connected and critical to the\nfutures of communities the length and breadth of the United Kingdom\u20197.\nThis self-justification shifts the focus away from the exhibited items onto\nthe visitor, whose attention must be \u2018targeted\u2019. But this corporate emphasis\non personalisation does not allow room for the growth or discovery\ninherent in the idea of Enlightenment, because it aims to capture consumer\npreference at any particular point, and it makes individuals, with their\nunique appetites, seem further away from each other than they are.

The Meaning of the Public in an Age of Privatisation 37\ncivic approach \u2013 universalist curation \u2013 adopts a \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019, which\nis not prejudiced by the perception of (constructed and malleable) tastes.\n\u2018Museum and mausoleum are connected by more than phonetic\nassociation\u2019, wrote Adorno, and for all the virtues of global museums,\ntheir acquisitions are intimately bound up with the history of conquest.\nHow can these institutions offer an alternative vision to exploitation when\nthey are born of the original sin of colonialism? How can they counter\nhegemony when they celebrate civilisations? For in the words of Walter\nBenjamin, \u2018There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same\ntime a document of barbarism\u2019.8 How can these museums claim to be a\nrefuge from \u2018getting and spending\u2019 when they direct us, at almost every\nopportunity, to the gift shop, and when major international exhibitions \u2013\nalready burdened by diplomatic and ethical challenges \u2013 are sponsored by\nthe Bank of America? The corporate attempt to appropriate civic spaces for\nconsumerism at least acknowledges what capitalist logic had dismissed:\nthat citizens still value the \u2018un-profitable\u2019, and have an appetite for \u2018useless\u2019\nknowledge. Perhaps a greater concern is the commodification of curation,\nin which objects are evacuated of their history and \u2018hollowed out\u2019.9 In her\nnovel The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy describes this transformation\nfrom \u2018History House\u2019 to \u2018Heritage Hotel\u2019. History is vital and contested \u2013\na story of conflict, coercion, rebellion, failure and martyrdom \u2013 whereas\nHeritage is a rarefied, sterilised ornamentation. Heritage offers gift shop\ntrinkets as tourist souvenirs \u2013 \u2018remembrances\u2019 in the French \u2013 but their\nremembrance is also an act of forgetting, an eliding of History. This\n\u2018reification\u2019 (the hypnotising effect of commodity fetishism) represses the\nmemory of production: as Adorno wrote to Benjamin, \u2018every reification is\na forgetting\u201910.\nAll Enlightenment ideologies dedicated to liberation are confronted\nwith the question of how to respond to their cultural inheritance. For Mao\nZedong, it was necessary to destroy the Four Olds \u2013 Old Culture, Old\nCustoms, Old Habits and Old Ideas \u2013 for the New to be born. The spectre\nof civilisation could not be allowed to haunt the socialist imagination:\nthe Cultural Revolution would \u2018Sweep Away All Monsters\u2019.

For\nTrotsky, by contrast, workers must \u2018master all the culture of the past\u2019, so\nthat it can be incorporated and transcended:\nThe art of past centuries has made man more complex and flexible, raising\nhis psyche to a higher level and enriching his mind in many ways. This\nenrichment is an invaluable conquest of culture. Mastery of the old art is\ntherefore a necessary prerequisite not only for the creation of a new art, but\nfor the construction of a new society, because for communism, people are\nneeded with a highly developed psyche. Is the old art capable, however,\nof enriching us with the artistic cognition of the world? Yes, it is. And it is\nprecisely for this reason that it is capable of nourishing our feelings and\ncultivating them. If we were to indiscriminately renounce the old art, then\nimmediately we would become poorer in spirit.11\nThe curation of \u2018civilisation\u2019 compels us to reassess our understanding\nof the relationship between power and culture. (\u2018Art never lies\u2019, declared\nWaldemar Januszczak in his BBC Four series The Dark Ages, but we can\ndeceive ourselves with it, often in ingenious ways). Intelligent curation is\nable to reveal a hidden history of civilisation:\nWho built the seven gates of Thebes?\nIn the books you will find the names of kings.\nWas it kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone? \u2026\nYoung Alexander conquered India.\nHe alone?12\nCuration can broaden as well as narrow; it can frame Alexander as a\nleader among men, at once inspired and fallible, while at the same time\nacknowledging the loss for civilisation of the library in the city that bears\nhis name.

Perhaps\nunderstandably, in an age vigilant of racism, we have become wary of the\nconcept of \u2018strangeness\u2019, and the awe and awkwardness that comes with\nthe encounter is regarded as the product of ignorance or parochialism. In\naddition, globalisation has proved to be a force for cultural homogeneity,\ncreating an alphabet of shared (corporate) symbols and a political economy\nthat restricts civic experimentation. We have become a civilisation in love\nwith its own reflection, always demanding to know the \u2018relevance\u2019 of that\nwhich it does not recognise. But museums must be careful about being\ntoo familiar \u2013 they live by curiosity, and should seek to nurture it by\nbeing suggestive, imaginative, challenging, humbling, inspiring. Against\nconsumer capitalism\u2019s assault on memory, a museum offers evidence of\nalternative ways of organising society, and in so doing plays a crucial role\nin \u2018the struggle of memory against forgetting\u2019. Ultimately, it is the duty of\npublic institutions to challenge the complacency and introspection of the\nprivate.

Cultural heritage is as much\na construction of the present as it is an interpretation of the past.\nThe changing fortunes and popularity of historical sites indicate that no\nspecific place is inherently valuable as heritage. There is therefore no\nheritage per se and all heritage, as Laurajane Smith argues, is ultimately\nintangible.4 What make sites valuable are the contemporary cultural\n1 I thank Marina Carter, Anup Grewal, Sanayi Marcelline, Nilu Abeyratne and Sasanka\nPerera for their thoughtful reading of the original draft of this essay which enabled me to\nsharpen many of the arguments made here.

It is\nthrough the practice of cultural appropriation that artefacts and places\nacquire meaning and value. In this chapter we will investigate an example\nof hegemonic discourse on heritage \u2018which acts to constitute the way\nwe think, talk and write about heritage\u20195 by exploring the situation in\npost-civil war Sri Lanka, a country where political ideals, contemporary\ncultural and social values, debates and aspirations directly translate into\na partisan interpretation of selected heritage sites.6\nReturn to Heritage\nAfter the decimation of the Tamil Tigers in 2009 brought Sri Lanka\u2019s\nlong civil war to an end, President Rajapaksa promised there would no\nlonger be minorities, in spite of the fact that the idea of a multicultural\nsociety was endorsed in the Thirteenth Amendment to the 1987\nConstitution. In the new \u2018civic nation\u2019 fleshed out in the President\u2019s\nspeech, citizen-patriots would be ethnically undifferentiated, although\nat the same time all religions and ethnic identities would supposedly be\nrespected. However, the President\u2019s vision of a nation at one with the\nstate is based on patriotic feelings stemming from a particular reading\nof the history and foundation myth of the Sinhala people. In this context\nall other groups \u2013 those formally known as minorities \u2013 are relegated\nto a secondary role with no room in the country\u2019s common political\nculture. At the same time there has been, in the last few years, a singular\nbut clearly identifiable phenomenon in the public sphere which I would\ndescribe as a \u2018return to heritage\u2019.\nEconomic Development and Heritage\nSince the 1930s \u2013 when a measure of self-government was granted to\nthe crown colony under the Donoughmore constitution \u2013 Sri-Lankan\nsociety has experienced an underlying nostalgia for a bygone age when\nthe peasantry was proud, prosperous, and embodied the moral values\ndestroyed in modern times. As a consequence the post-colonial state\ninvested heavily in restoring ancient irrigation tanks in the north-central\n5 I bid, p. 11.\n6 Ibid. History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka 45\nprovince areas, constructing new dams in the south-east (Gal oya and\nWelawe ganga), and finally, from 1968, undertaking the large-scale project\nof developing the area around the Mahaweli river and its affluent. The\npurpose of the latter project was not purely economic. Developmental\ngoals were intertwined with nationalist underpinnings centred on the\nSinhala peasant, represented in popular ideology as a \u2018sublime object\u2019. In\nthe state ideology of the United National Party (UNP) government, which\nintroduced a new economic policy based on economic liberalisation and an\nexport-led economy, development through irrigated agriculture achieved\na prominent place and was presented as a reincarnation of the ancient,\nindigenous and Buddhist culture of Sri Lanka\u2019s golden age. The Minister of\nMahaweli Development in the UNP regime, Gamini Dissanayake, declared\nquite candidly in 1983 that \u2018the soul of the new Mahaweli society will be\ncherished values of the ancient society, which were inspired and nourished\nby the Tank, the Temple and the Paddy Field\u2019.7\nThe link between economic policy and state ideology has been\ndemonstrated by Hennayake who has shown the involvement of the agro-\ntechnology and insurance sectors in the process of connecting development\nto the concept of an ideal past. She cites the text from the advertisement of\na fertiliser company from the post-1977 period:\nAgriculture is a part of Sri Lankan heritage, its culture and tradition. Our\nancient kings were inspired agriculturists. Our people here, from the time\nimmemorial, combined an affinity for the earth with a talent for innovative\ntechnology. Anglo-Fert and Anglo-Chem are two companies who share a\ncorporate commitment to the growth of agriculture in this country.8\nAnother aspect of the appropriation of cultural heritage by the post-1977\nliberalised state is testified by the government\u2019s policy of invoking the\npast and displaying its commitment to nurture the nation\u2019s heritage in\norder to push through its development agenda. The UNP government\nwas responsible for requesting the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to provide guidance and assistance\nin managing the archaeological sites in the regions containing the three\nancient capitals of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy in 1978.\nTwo years later, the director general of UNESCO, when appealing\n7 C ited in N.S.M.

While the opening\nup of the economy was radically transforming other aspects of society,\nsometimes brutally bringing a peasant society into a modern world of\nconsumption, the dominant discourse was more and more imbued with a\nsense of the pastoral care of the material past. Caring for the heritage of the\nnation would give the government the self-assigned right to radically alter\nthe present. As Michael Herzfeld points out:\nThe static image of an unspoiled and irrecoverable past often plays an\nimportant part in present actions. It legitimizes deeds of the moment by\ninvesting them with the moral authority of eternal truth and by representing\nthe vagaries of circumstance as realization of a larger universe of system and\nbalance.10\nIn the early twentieth century proponents of a nation that was modern\nyet unsullied by western influence defined their ancient past as heritage\nin order to create pride in the nation in the making, whereas the liberal\nstate of the late 1970s, focusing on economic development, used heritage to\nstrengthen their claim to moral authority to transform an agrarian society\ninto a market-oriented export processing zone. The twenty-first-century\ngovernment, however, uses heritage for purely political purposes. In the\nyears since the end of the civil war in 2009, the concept of national heritage\nhas been used to depoliticise citizens and to mute any possible dissent.\nA number of institutions, groups and personalities are involved in the\nconstruction of the present discourse around national heritage.\nThe Construction of the Present Hegemonic Discourse\nLocal and international bodies, governmental and non-governmental\norganisations and individuals all play a role in the creation of a specific\nunderstanding of \u2018heritage\u2019 that has gradually merged with what is\ngenerally known as history. This new interpretation of national heritage is\n9 Cited in R. Silva, \u2018The Cultural Triangle of Sri Lanka\u2019, in Henry Cleere (ed.), Archeological\nHeritage Management in the Modern World (London: Routledge, 2005), p. 222.\n10 Herzfeld, 1997, p. 206. History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka 47\nshaped in a number of ways: through acts and practices that define heritage,\nthrough legislation and policy decisions about specific heritage sites,\nthrough the allocation of state funding, and, finally, through conservation\npractices that transform heritage sites.\nEducation and Heritage\nAs Bourdieu has argued, educational structures aim to produce social\nagents worthy and capable of receiving the heritage of the group and\nadept at transmitting it in turn to a larger group.11 Education in Sri Lanka is\nfree at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. In 2010 there were 3,932,722\nstudents enrolled in primary and secondary education.12 A principal\nmanner in which ideas about heritage are conveyed to a large public is\nthrough teaching in schools, universities and Daham Pasala (Buddhist\nSunday schools), and through textbooks. Indeed, textbooks provide a fairly\naccurate reflection of the way history as critical assessment of the past has\nbeen superseded by a version of history that conveys a simplified account\nof the past.13 This process is not a recent one, but it did gain momentum\nafter the war against the secessionist movement in the north and east\nentered its last and bloodiest phase.\nIssues pertaining to heritage are introduced in both history textbooks\nand Buddhism textbooks. History is now a compulsory subject in primary\nand secondary schools and a cursory look at the texts produced by the\nNational Institute of Education reveals an emphasis on monumental\nhistories associated with royal lineages. History as a subject that interprets\nthe past, rather than glorifying it, is unrecognisable in these textbooks,\nwhich offer children a narrative of the glorious days before invaders from\nIndia and colonial powers shattered the equilibrium of Sri Lankan society\nby ushering in modernity.14\n11 P.

Even a quick examination of the present Daham\nPasala texts that contain sections on Sri Lankan history reveals certain\ntrends. Just as in school histories, the history of Buddhism appears as\none peppered with glorious deeds and exceptional individuals (shresta\nminissu). It is a history full of omissions and chosen emphases, one which\nresembles the heritage/mythic mode of recounting the past rather than\nmodern historiography. If heritage is about the meanings placed upon\nartefacts or other traces and the interpretations that are created from them,\nwhat is dispensed in Daham Pasala is a \u2018heritagised\u2019 version of history in\nwhich interpretations are presented as evidence that cannot be contested\nor questioned.\nInstitutions\nAt the University of Colombo, where I taught for nearly 20 years, student\nBuddhist monks often chose to study history expecting to be taught\na national culture set in stone, able to provide certainties in a world in\nconstant flux. They were, of course, disappointed to find that the courses\nwe offered did not deal with history as heritage but rather questioned their\nreceived ideas about monastic history conveyed by the Chronicles. History,\nas we taught it, was conceived as precisely the opposite of heritage studies.\nBut this is not always the case in those fields of study where notions of the\npast are being fashioned \u2013 departments of history, archaeology, heritage\nstudies, Pali and Buddhist studies.\nOutside academia there are a number of ministries and government\ndepartments directly involved in the definition, production and preservation\nof heritage: the Ministries of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, of Culture\nand the Arts, of National Heritage; the Archaeological Department, and those\nof the National Archives, National Museum, Buddhist Affairs, Christian\nAffairs, Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs, Muslim Religious and Cultural\nAffairs, and Cultural Affairs and Educational Publications. These institutions\nearn their power and credibility by making themselves visible before the\npublic eye, in particular through print and audio-visual media.\nIn addition to government ministries, a number of statutory bodies and\nnon-governmental organisations are concerned with particular aspects of History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka 49\nheritage, either through teaching, research or funding conservation. These\ninclude the Central Cultural Fund (CCF), the Galle Heritage Foundation\n(GHF), the National Art Council (also covering non-tangible heritage), the\nNational Crafts Council (NCC), the National Performing Art Centre, and\nthe UNESCO National Commission. These institutions earn power and\ncredibility in various ways as they target different audiences through a\nvariety of projects. Many experts sit on a number of these commissions,\nthus creating a message on heritage that consolidates its own foundations\nrather than questioning them.\nFinally, non-governmental organisations play a considerable role\nin generating interest in heritage issues, among them the Royal Asiatic\nSociety of Sri Lanka (RASSL), The National Heritage Trust, The Dutch\nBurgher Union (DBU), The Archaeologists Association, local branches of\nthe International Commission on Museums (ICOM), and the local section\nof the International Commission on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).\nVying for Popular Appeal: Merging History and Heritage\nin Popular Culture\nThe realm of popular culture has always been filled with accounts of\nSri Lankan history drawn from the Chronicles, myths, and Jataka tales\nwhich portray heroes and gods as the agents of history. Social forces or\nclass conflict have no place in these accounts. The gap between histories\nwritten in English by professional academics and popular histories in the\nvernacular is not new, but widened with the opening up of the economy\nin the late 1970s, when a cosmopolitan class chose to consume western\nmodernity with a vengeance after a decade of austerity. They consciously\ndetached themselves from a past that was linked to myths and legends. The\nvernacular domain of culture was, however, recently re-energised under\nthe influence of an entertainment industry that pandered to many people\u2019s\nneed for reassurance at a moment when the nation was threatened by\nsecessionist anti-systemic groups. The trend became especially pronounced\nin 2008, when the state began its full-scale patriotic war to overthrow the\nTamil rebels in the north and east of the country.\nThis patriotic war had a direct impact on the film industry. In August\n2008 the historical movie Aba was released in 38 cinemas across Sri Lanka.\nAba was produced by EAP Edirisinghe, a group of companies that owned\na popular TV channel called Swarnavahini. The film, directed by Jackson 50 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nAnthony, a well-known film actor and TV personality, depicted the life of\nKing Pandukabhaya. Pandukabhaya was the first king of Anuradhapura\nwho, according to the Chronicles, ruled for 70 years some 2,400 years\nago. Cinema-goers watching the movie reached the impressive figure of\n2,105,000, about 10 percent of the total population of the island.\nThis and other contemporary works revolve around common tropes,\nsuch as the hydraulic civilisation and the aesthetic of the gargantuesque.\nWhat is portrayed is not the past but Sri Lanka\u2019s fame, which is related to its\npast ability, for instance, to build stupas15 deemed exceptional for being the\nlargest brick structures known to the pre-modern world. Monumentality\nis a central value in the production of heritage by the state, businesses,\njournalists and consultants in Sri Lanka. The connection between the\nexceptional architectural prowess of the past and the present is implicit.\nToday\u2019s patriotic state needs the \u2018signatures of the visible\u2019 to construct a\nnational imagination.16 Creative works, monuments and archaeology thus\ncreate a heritage able to consolidate national identity and to strengthen the\npublic profile of political figures.\nFictionalised versions of the past consumed by adults and children are\nalso vehicles for a heritage discourse that naturalises certain narratives\nas well as cultural forms and social experiences that are often linked to\nideas of nation and nationhood. Historical novels, for instance, are in great\nvogue. A case in point is Jayantha Chandrasiri\u2019s novel \u2013 soon to be made\ninto a film \u2013 The Great Dutugemunu (Maha Dutugemunu), which relates the\nglories of a third century BC Sinhala hero who slayed the Tamil King Elara\nand recaptured the kingdom of Anuradhapura.\nToday, it is clear that the public idea of what constitutes the past is\nfashioned in a vibrant commercial environment. Publishers, authors, film\nand teledrama makers use print media as well as visual technologies and\nthe internet to reproduce a monumental, often exclusive, personality-\noriented vision of the past as heritage, a vision that the state apparatus is\nalso conveying through educational institutions. This vision is, however,\ncontested on occasion by dissenting views, as well as by members of\ncommunities that are excluded from the official discourse.\n15 A stupa is a hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics, typically the ashes of\nBuddhist monks, used by Buddhists as a place of meditation.\n16 A. Appadurai, \u2018The Globalization of Archaeology and Heritage: A Discussion with\nArjun Appadurai\u2019, Journal of Social Archaeology, 35(1), 2001, p. 44 History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka 51\nHeritage in Practice: Disputes and Dissent\nThe transformation of history into heritage must also be understood as\na transformation from a selective and individualistic practice performed\nby professional historians into a public performance. Heritage practice\ninvolves visiting, interpreting and especially managing and conserving.\nOne initiative in this direction is the Ramayana Trail, which takes people\nto 52 sites related to the great Hindu epic of the same name, including\nthe garden where the abducted Sita, wife of Prince Rama, was imprisoned\nby Ravana, king of Lanka. The National Tourism Development Authority\n(SLTDA)17 started this initiative in 2007 with the aim of attracting Indian\ntourists in search of an authentic historical experience. In 2009, after the\ncivil war ended, 4,000 Indian tourists arrived and numbers have been\ngrowing since.\nThe Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka (RASSL), especially its director,\nSusantha Goonetilleke, were vehemently opposed to what they saw as\nthe resurrection of a fictional trail based on no historical evidence and for\npurely commercial reasons. Historians, including those of a nationalist\nleaning, criticised the creation of an historical site that was not supported\nby \u2018proper scientific knowledge\u2019. The Ramayana Trail controversy shows\nhow in Sri Lanka promoters of the patriotic nation state select myths useful\nfor propaganda purposes and to neutralise historical interpretations that\ndo not conform to the dominant ideology.\nDisputes over Sites\nHeritage can be used by official cultural institutions and social elites as\na tool to promote a version of history which tones down cultural and\nsocial tensions in the present time. It can also, however, be used by\nmarginalised groups in a progressive way, to rethink the past and express\nsocial identities excluded by the official discourse.18 Historical sites are a\nparticularly powerful form of heritage as they are visual and material \u2013 and\nmemory requires a display, an articulation via objects or representation\nto give it meaning. Moreover materiality makes these locations appear\nneutral as mere traces of history rather than political and social constructs,\nwhilst in fact sites and landscapes are the terrain where conflicting claims\n17 Formerly the Tourist Board of Sri Lanka.\n18 Smith, 2006, p. 4. 52 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nover heritage clash. Post-conflict Sri Lanka is a case in point of cultural\nappropriation of national heritage by a state determined to present a\nglorified notion of the nation\u2019s history.\nA recent example is provided by Kandarodai in the Jaffna Peninsula,\nwhere a collection of circular structures on a megalithic site possibly dating\nfrom the early part of the second millennium was discovered in the early\ntwentieth century. After the end of the civil war pilgrims began to visit the\nplace again and its name was subsequently Sinhalised as Kandurugoda,\nwhile the structures were refashioned as stupas. This connection with the\nBuddhist past of the country\u2019s north was meant to counter the entire Tamil\nnationalist historical narrative. Today, this interpretation of the site could\nfuel tension between communities as they battle over the cultural meaning\nof the place. Unlike the case of the Ramayana Trail, the stupas appear to\noffer concrete evidence of a Buddhist past, further strengthened by an\ninscription naming the place Kandurugoda. This serves Sinhalese claims\nthat Buddhism encompassed the entire island, the stupas being dated to\nthe ninth century AD, a period which bears similarities to Borobudur in\nIndonesia.19 Tamil scholars have acknowledged the Buddhist remains in\nJaffna, described as \u2018burial monuments of monks, a buddhicised version\nof megalithicism\u2019, as proof of the existence of Tamil Buddhists in ancient\ntimes.20 Sinhalese nationalist Ven. Ellawalla Medhananda is championing\nthe renovation of all Buddhist sites in areas \u2018desecrated\u2019 by decades of civil\nwar.21 In the post-conflict period Tamils felt the state was investing too\nmuch in renovating traces of Buddhist heritage in the north and east as well\nas building new temples, while their Hindu heritage was being neglected:\nBuddha statues have been found in places like Kandarodai, and this shows\nthat Tamils have followed Buddhism and that Tamil Buddhism was practiced\nin Eelam, in a lesser extent, but the Sinhalese show these as Buddhist\nantiques and claim parts of the Tamil motherland as Sinhala areas.22\n19 D.G.B. de Silva, \u2018Kantarodai Buddhist remains: A Sri Lankan Boro-budur lost for ever?\u2019,\nThe Island, 14 August 2002, http://www.island.lk/2002/08/14/midwee01.html\n20 N.

Each group is trying to test the limits of\ntoleration of the others under the watchful eye of the patriotic state.\nThe Conflict over the Nature of Restoration\nProtecting built heritage and restoring it according to certain agreed\ncriteria is an idea that was born in Europe in the nineteenth century and\ntravelled to Sri Lanka with antiquarianism and colonial archaeology under\nH.C.P. Bell. In the post-colonial period, these principles were enshrined in\na number of international treaties, among which the Venice Charter of 1964\nis the most influential. The preamble of this seminal document indicates\nthe underlying ideas about the past that prevailed in the 1960s:\nPeople are becoming more and more conscious of the unity of human\nvalues and regard ancient monuments as a common heritage. The common\nresponsibility to safeguard them for future generations is recognized. It is\nour duty to hand them on in the full richness of their authenticity.24\nIt is on this crucial issue of \u2018authenticity\u2019 and the need to respect this\nprinciple when restoring monuments and sites that differences in\ninterpretation arise between international organisations upholding these\nvalues and other parties who feel they have trusteeship of a monument.\nThe Temple of the Tooth (Dalada Maligawa) in Kandy is believed by the\nBuddhist community to house the Buddha\u2019s Tooth relic. The temple was\nconstructed by King Wimaladharmasuriya (1593-1603) and is today under\nthe control of two chief monks of the Malwatta and Asgiriya temples and\na lay custodian (diyavadana nilame). The restoration of the Temple of the\nTooth after part of it was destroyed by a Tamil Tigers bomb in 1998 offers a\ntelling example of the local understanding of restoration as making anew.\nNew tiles were laid, new sandakadapahana (moonstone) and new carvings\n23 \u2018People of the Great Stone Age Civilization had lived in Kandarodai\u2019, Global Tamil\nNews, 24 June 2011, http://www.globaltamilnews.net/GTMNEditorial/tabid/71/article\nType/ArticleView/articleId/63096/language/en-US/People-of-the-Great-Stone-Age-\nCivilization-had-Lived-in-Kandarodai.aspx\n24 See http://www.international.icomos.org/charters/venice_e.pdf 54 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nwere added, totally in contravention of the Venice Charter.25 The clash is\nhere between an historical temple as a living heritage where people come\nto practice their rituals, and the World Heritage view of historical places\nas unalterable entities fixed in time. The vision of the bhikkhus, as far as\nstupas and other Buddhist sites are concerned, is that heritage is a living\nthing that can be modified. Hence the restoration of the Dalada Maligawa\nto look exactly as it looked before, even if this meant using present day\nmaterials, or the painting of ancient stupas in white, which is a common\noccurrence in Sri Lanka and serves to make them similar to all other modern\nstupas in the country.\nConclusion\nIn Sri Lanka, as in most states which are signatories of international\nconventions, \u2018heritage\u2019, in its multifarious guises, is endorsed simultaneously\nby UNESCO, an international bureaucratic organisation, by a global tourist\nindustry and by the country\u2019s government.26 UNESCO\u2019s rhetoric appears\nto be progressive in that it purports to protect world cultures by means of\nprotocols, declarations and inventories. But world heritage projects belong\nto a world system and world economy which are in no way at odds with\nthe way nation states exhibit and promote a populist interpretation of the\npast. In that sense international organisations such as UNESCO facilitate\nthe marginalisation of certain histories and the dominance of ideological\nand cultural appropriation by centres of political and economic power.27\nThe state uses the framework of World Heritage Sites for its own agenda\nof cultural hegemony. The contradictions between Sri Lanka\u2019s nation\nstate ideology, morphed into what I have elsewhere qualified as \u2018new\npatriotism\u2019 in the post-conflict years, and the lofty goals of UNESCO are\nrarely acknowledged by local representatives of UNESCO or members of\nICOMOS.28 There are few voices left to dissent.\n25 See Article 6 of the Venice Charter, http://www.international.icomos.org/charters/\nvenice_e.pdf\n26 M.

History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka 55\nAt a time when Western thinkers have lost their legitimacy among the\npeople of Sri Lanka, it might be strategic to re-introduce them to the thought\nof Rabindranath Tagore. Indeed, Tagore advocates that when a country is\nseen as morally transgressing, it forfeits its claim to the loyalty of its citizens.\nHis contemporary, Leo Tolstoy, made the same point when he stated that\none could be a critic while at the same time being a patriot. What both\nthinkers discredited was an extreme patriotism that entailed a belief in the\nsuperiority of one\u2019s country and an exclusive concern for one\u2019s country.29\nTagore\u2019s low-key nationalism is certainly at odds with the type of state\npatriotism promoted by the Sri Lankan government during the final phase\nof the civil war and the eventual victory over the Tamil Tigers. I have\nargued elsewhere that if the Rajapaksa regime takes patriotism seriously\nand expects non-Sinhalese communities to identify with a national identity\nthat transcends their attachment to a specific group, it will need to avoid\nexpressions of \u2018banal nationalism\u2019 that can easily alienate cultural minorities.\nContinuing to flag Sinhala-Buddhist traditions as the basis of the nation\u2019s\npatriotism, a practice that started in the mid-1950s, is certainly not a way to\nwin over the hearts of members of racial and religious minorities.\n29 Leo Tolstoy, \u2018On Patriotism\u2019 (1894) and \u2018Patriotism or Peace\u2019 (1896), in Writings on Civil\nDisobedience and Non-Violence (New York: New American Library 1968).  5. Looking at the Acropolis\nof Athens from Modern\nTimes to Antiquity\nWilliam St Clair1\nThe Acropolis of Athens is one of the most famous places on earth, visited\nby over a million people every year, and instantly recognisable by millions\nmore who know it only from pictures. With posters and postcards\ndisplayed in every street kiosk and hotel lobby in Athens, and countless\nimages encountered in books, films, television, brochures, advertising, and\nsocial media in countries round the world, it must now be impossible for\nany visitor, whether a Greek child on a first educational visit or a stranger\nfrom a distant land, to look at the Acropolis without feeling that, in some\nsense, they have already seen it. Nor is the sense of immediate familiarity\na recent or an incidental result of the rapid spread of modern information\ntechnology. Already by the end of the eighteenth century, the number of\npeople who knew the Acropolis from pictures was greater than the number,\nwhether local people or visitors, who saw it with their own eyes, and the\ngap continued to widen.\nPartly as a result, thoughtful visitors have long been worried about loss\nof independence. Colonel J.P. Barry, a medical man, for example, visiting\n1 Versions of this essay were given as the Runciman lecture, King\u2019s College, London, 2012,\nthe Gaisford lecture, University of Oxford, 2012, the Duncan Sandys lecture, Europa\nNostra UK, 2013, and at academic seminars at home and abroad. I am deeply grateful to\nthe many friends and colleagues who have contributed to the development of the ideas.\nA book length study that sets out the full history is expected in 2015, but it seemed useful,\nat the risk of unbalancing the present essay, to offer the theoretical and methodological\ndiscussion as a contribution to the general debates in this volume.\n\u00a9 William St Clair, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.05 58 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nthe Acropolis from India in 1905, hoped to experience \u2018impressions not\nderived from reading\u2019, claiming that: \u2018The most valuable impressions for\nthe traveller are those he makes his own not those made for him\u2019.2 Joseph\nPennell, an artist from the United States, who in 1913 wanted to experience\nGreece without preconceptions, declared that before his visit he avoided\nreading any classical author even in translation, and deliberately refused\nto take any interest in architecture or proportion.3 They and many others\nbefore and since have understood that, whether they chose to submit,\nto resist, or to negotiate, and whether in the event they were confirmed\nor \u2018agreeably disappointed\u2019 in their expectations, the seeing agenda had\nalready been set.4\nIn many of the issues that have arisen in the development of modern\nnotions of cultural property, including law, legitimacy, identity, history\nversus heritage, stewardship and trusteeship, appropriation and\nrestitution, the Acropolis of Athens and its buildings (including the parts\nof the buildings removed by Lord Elgin) have provided a framework for\nunderstanding the changing issues. Continuing in that tradition, and as\na potential contribution to the wider aims of the volume, I offer in this\nessay a summary history of ways of looking at the Acropolis and how and\nwhen they were constituted, from which some of the contemporary ethical\nquestions emerge. There can be no other monument in the world in which\nthe potential long view is so long, the ways of seeing so different across\ntime, the claims made so varied, and the evidence available for developing\nanswers so complete.\nTwo general observations underpin everything that follows. First,\nwithout viewers, the Acropolis is a culturally inert accumulation of animal,\nvegetable, and mineral \u2013 and even these are categories invented and\nimputed by human observers. It is the man, woman, or child who looks\nat the Acropolis who confers the value and makes the meanings, not the\nAcropolis as such. And, secondly, the transformation in the mind from the\nphysiological act of seeing to the psychological act of interpretation cannot\noccur unless the experience has been mediated. Any act of looking at the\n2 Lieut-Col. J.P. Barry, A.B. M.B., At the Gates of the East: A Book of Travel among Historic\nWonderlands (London: Longman, 1906), pp. vii and 17.\n3 Catalogue of an Exhibition of Lithographs and Etchings of Grecian Temples by Joseph Pennell\n(New York: Frederick Keppell, 1913), Preface.\n4 T he phrase is from Murray\u2019s A Handbook for travellers in the Ionian Islands, Greece, Turkey,\nAsia Minor, and Constantinople \u2026 with maxims and hints for travellers in the East (London:\nMurray, 1840), p. 55. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 59\nAcropolis, I take as established, has required decisions on the part of the\nviewer, not normally consciously or explicitly taken, about the organising\ncategories within which the seeing experience is to be understood.5 The\nsituation today, when all on-the-spot seeing has been prefigured, is only\none example of a cognitive process that, we can be confident, has occurred\nat all times in the past, including during the centuries when there were no\npictures and hardly any written words. Even those viewers about whom\nwe know least, such as women and girls forcibly brought from distant\nalien cultures and immured in the Acropolis as slaves, brought their own\ninterpretative categories, even if it may now be impossible to recover what\nthey were. And, at the other end of the spectrum, I could give long lists of\nmen and women whose sincere accounts of their experience of looking at\nthe Acropolis conform so closely to the conventions of their cultural group\nthat it is impossible to tell from their words alone whether they ever really\nsaw what they describe.\nDiscussing the relationship of words with images, Socrates is reported\nby Plato to have remarked:\nWritings, Phaedrus, have a strange quality in which they resemble portraits.\nThey stand before you like living things, but if you ask them a question, they\npreserve a solemn silence. And it is the same with written words. They seem\nto talk to you as if they had minds, but if you ask them about what they say,\nfrom a wish to understand them more fully, they go on telling you the same\nthing for ever.6\nThe Acropolis, our generation can readily agree, does not converse, but,\nwith all respect to Socrates, we also know that it does not speak, let alone\nthat it goes on telling the same story forever. The aspiration to \u2018let the\nmute stones speak\u2019, a proverbial phrase since ancient times, ignores the\ninescapable fact that no meanings exist in stones, nor indeed in any of the\nother material remains of the past, until they have been imputed by live\nhuman beings applying their own categories. The belief, associated with\nwestern romanticism, that great art can transcend its cultural circumstances\nand material conditions and offer timeless truths direct to the minds of\nviewers, is itself a mediating category, as historically contingent as the\nothers. The eye, except possibly in newly born babies, is never innocent.\n5 T he general insight by Bloch and others is discussed with reference to the ancient Greek\nmyths by Richard Buxton, Imaginary Greece: The Contexts of Mythology (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1994), pp. 80 ff.\n6 Phaedrus, 275, author\u2019s free translation. 60 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nContemporary neuroscience discusses the operation of visual cognitive\nprocesses in terms of \u2018saccades\u2019, the eye movements that occur several times\nevery second, and \u2018salience\u2019, the value that the mind attaches to the visual\nstimuli received, and the reward it hopes to receive by targeting its gaze.\nThe assumption, mainstream until recently and still commonly held, that\nthe act of viewing is a passive receiving of information, has been replaced\nby an understanding that viewing implies choice. Other assumptions about\nthe ways in which the external world is understood, often categorised as\n\u2018natural\u2019, \u2018god-given\u2019, or otherwise essentialist or unchanging, that have in\npast epochs underpinned both the visual production and the consumption\nof the Acropolis no longer deserve our assent. For centuries, for example, it\nwas generally believed, officially taught, and acted upon, that the human\neye sends out light rays to touch the object of vision and returns, bearing the\nessence of that object. During the centuries of the iconoclasm controversies\namong competing Christian groupings in the Byzantine period, Athens\nand its acropolis were part of a society in which theories of anatomy, optics,\nthe nature of light, and what happens to the mind in the act of looking, that\nhave long since been proved to be fallacious, led to many violent deaths.7\nOr, to give a more modern example, when William Hugh Williams, a\nlandscape artist who saw and drew the Acropolis in 1817, and who became\nknown in his day as \u2018Grecian\u2019 Williams, wrote of the \u2018electrifying truths,\nwhich flash upon the mind in studying her [\u2018Nature\u2019] not only as she is, but\nas seen through the medium of works of genius\u2019, he was repeating a clich\u00e9\nof his time that few can now accept. Nor is his assumption that the natural\nworld is designed and benevolent one that can now be accepted.8\nOur generation can also bring to a history of looking at the Acropolis\na modern appreciation of the difficulty of separating mental and bodily\nstates. Emotions engaged by seeing experiences, it is now established, can\nlead to changes in and beyond the mind/brain, such as a sense of enhanced\nintensity, which may be mistaken for a confirmation of the validity of\nsome opinion that the viewer already holds, whether of admiration or\nabhorrence. Dreams too have often been categorised as \u2018epiphanies\u2019 or\n\u2018prophecies\u2019, messages from supernatural beings or forces, that encourage\nthe wakening dreamer to think and act in certain ways. Viewers of the\n7 I n the words of Liz James: \u2018Byzantium is the only major world power to have undergone\npolitical upheaval on a vast scale as a result of an argument about art\u2019. Liz.

Among the predecessors whom he mentions are Poussin and\nClaude whose paintings he had gone to Italy to study. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 61\nAcropolis, acting on such beliefs, have in modern as well as in ancient\ntimes sometimes deliberately put themselves into a semi-conscious state\nin order to experience responses that they believed arrived from outside,\nand have frequently been encouraged to do so by those who have wished\nto influence them.\nMemories, we can, I suggest, now accept as having been established\nby the work of Halbwachs and his successors, exist in relationship to a\nsocial group, situated in the mental and material spaces provided by, and\noften invented and maintained by, that group in order to enable them to\nbe organised and conserved.9 Besides functioning as a theatre of social\nmemory, the Acropolis has itself been a technology of memory both for\nattempts to invent and control new memory by building and rebuilding,\nand for policies aimed at destroying and superseding the previously\nexisting memory by knocking down, replacing, and what we may call\nmonument cleansing. To those living in modern and in ancient times, but to\na much lesser extent during the long millennium in between, the Acropolis\nhas served as a store of cultural capital.10\nWhen UNESCO, the organisation that was established in 1945 in the\nruins of the world war, to promote peace \u2018on the basis of humanity\u2019s moral\nand intellectual solidarity\u2019, took the Parthenon as its symbol, it was picking\nup and reinforcing a tradition of regarding the building as more than an\nextraordinary survival from an ancient civilisation or as a fine work of\narchitecture. Unlike, say the Pyramids of Egypt, the Acropolis of Athens\nhas in recent centuries been presented, within the western political and\nartistic traditions, as an inspiration to the modern world, part of a precious\nidentity shared with classical Hellas. And the imputations are themselves\npart of the history. As a material embodiment of immaterial values that\nmany since the European Renaissance have wished to claim as their own,\nthe Acropolis has provided a focal point for many of the intellectual \u2013 and\noccasionally of the physical \u2013 struggles from which the modern world has\nemerged. If there is a shared western identity, the Acropolis of Athens has\nparticipated in the debates and crises that have helped to shape it.

Discussed also by\nEleni Bast\u00e9a, The Creation of Modern Athens: Planning the Myth (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2000), pp. 2-6.\n10 As far as ancient Athens is concerned, discussed by Bernd Steinbock, Social Memory in\nAthenian Public Discourse: Uses and Meanings of the Past (Ann Arbor, MI: University of\nMichigan Press, 2012). 62 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nAcropolis of the imagination has sometimes played as decisive a role in the\ncourse of events as the Acropolis of the stones.\nA history of looking at the Acropolis that aims to address the implications\nof the two starting observations within a framework of established modern\nknowledge must therefore, I suggest, do more than add new information\nto the existing histories of the Acropolis as a monument, modifying the\naccounts and explanations as necessary, although it must try to do that. Nor\ncan it be content with finding examples of people who saw the Acropolis\nat different times, and summarising what they are reported as saying\nor thinking or feeling, although it should build up this kind of historical\ndata too. A history that pursues the implications of the two observations\nwithin a framework of established modern knowledge must, I suggest, also\ninvestigate the means by which the experiences of cultural constituencies\nwere turned into categories, and how, by whom, and on whose authority,\nthese processes of inscription, repetition, and ritualisation helped to\nestablish and mediate ways of seeing, and how, when, and why changes\noccurred. Although seeing is individual and dynamic, the mediations\nthat condition expectations, and the choices about salience, are social and\noften stable for long periods of time. And since the mediating, both the\nimmaterial, such as cultural norms, and the material objects, such as the\nbooks and the pictures by which norms were constituted, could only have\ninfluenced those who already knew their languages, conventions, and\ngenres, it follows too that questions about the nature and extent of the\nmateriality of mediation, including the political economy of how they came\ninto existence in the form that they did, who had access to them and when,\nand who assented to them or resisted, must also be part of the inquiry.\nUntil recently, the historic, as distinct from the implied, viewer has been\nlargely absent from art history as practised, or has been conceived of as \u2018a\npassive reader or consumer of images\u2019.11 However, when we try to build a\nprovisional model for conducting an inquiry into the history of the Acropolis\nas a dynamic cultural system \u2013 that is, as a series of transactions rather than as\na changing text \u2013 we quickly find that the determining role of the mediations\ncannot simply be attached to the current conventions, leaving them\notherwise unchanged. No historic viewer of the Acropolis, has, for example,\never followed the conventions that present the Acropolis as a chronological\nparade. A history arranged as a series of moments of first production is unable\n11 The phrase used by Donald Preziosi, Rethinking Art History: Meditations on a Coy Science\n(New Haven, CT and London: Yale University Press, 1989), p. 46. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 63\nto accommodate the fact that the monuments of the Acropolis were designed\nand built so as to be seen into the future as it was then foreseeable, and that\nthey often did continue to be looked at for centuries. It has become common,\nby those aware of the difficulties implicit in periodisation, to describe the\ncontinued existence of public monuments after the time when they were first\nbuilt as their \u2018afterlife\u2019 from the German nachleben. But the word itself draws\nattention to its own lack of historicity. Except possibly (and to a limited\nextent) in the case, for example, of the first viewers personally present at the\nunveiling of a public monument, when the producers and the consumers\nwere members of the same closely defined cultural group, we cannot assume\nthat even broadly contemporaneous viewers categorised, interpreted, or\nresponded in the same way. Since all monuments are attempts to influence\nviewing experiences beyond the moment when they were first made, their\n\u2018afterlife\u2019 begins the moment they are born, or in many cases even earlier.\nNor have viewers of the Acropolis always, or even normally, privileged the\nimmediately contemporary over the old, nor regarded the no-longer-new as\nbeing culturally no longer alive. Most visitors today look more closely at the\nParthenon than at the ticket office.\nWhat we can say with confidence is that the producers of the material\nAcropolis \u2013 walls, buildings, public and private dedications and inscriptions,\nsculptures, pictures, and symbols \u2013 have always wanted it to carry visual\nsigns to live viewers, actual and potential, with the hope, intention, and\nexpectation that meanings made by these viewers would be accepted,\ninternalised, and acted upon. Indeed a wish to offer viewers a means of\nunderstanding the relationship between the then present, the then past,\nand the then future, was among the explicitly stated aims of those who\nbuilt the classical Acropolis and by others later. And there has never been\na time from the present back to classical times and earlier, when viewers\ndid not see ruined as well as functioning buildings, and attempt to draw\nlessons from the experience. A study that faces the implications of the two\nobservations is therefore, I suggest, certain to be different from a history\n(or an art history, or an archaeological history) of the stones, and cannot\nbe derived solely from such histories. The theories and mediations, that\ncoexisted and competed, form complex time patterns of their own that do not\ncoincide with one another, let alone with the conventions of a chronological\nparade. When, however, we relocate the site where meanings are made to\nthe minds of viewers, and admit them as active participants in a complex\ndynamic system, we may begin to undertake the more ambitious task of 64 Cultural Heritage Ethics\ntracing the effects of cultural production through to cultural consumption,\nto the resultant construction of group mentalities, and on to real world\nconsequences in at least some cases.\nThe fact that there are mismatches between current and past ways of\nseeing is, of course, well understood, as is the difficulty of the imaginative\nleap needed to emancipate even the recent past from modern assumptions.\nThe Past is a Foreign Country was the title of one of David Lowenthal\u2019s\npioneering studies of the notion of heritage published in 1985.12 For more\nthan a generation, scholars have rightly emphasised the need to recover\nand historicise past discursive practices, including ways of seeing, that\nwere based on assumptions that have since been rendered untenable.\nMy approach may meet the comment, associated with post-colonial\ntheory, that I am imposing modern western European scientific and\nEnlightenment categories on societies whose world views were different\nand who valued different kinds of knowledge. In recent times, for example,\nsome have re-conceptualised the notion of myth as \u2018meaningful history\u2019, an\nattempt to soften the distinction between a search for reliable knowledge\nof what actually happened in the past from a search for understandings\nof how the mediated past impinged on the minds of the people alive at\nany particular time.13 However, although assessing the past within its\nown discursive terms may appear to protect the modern historian from\nthe charge of condescension, it risks turning history into a mere collecting\nand chronicling of past stories that we now know to be untrue, an\nantiquarianism condemned to perpetual imprisonment within its own\nartificial conventions.\nPreferable, I suggest, is to find a way that neither ignores the otherness\nof the past, nor adopts the reactionary fallacy that modern scientific\nand Enlightenment knowledge is just another passing discourse whose\nclaims are no stronger than those of its many predecessors and modern\ncompetitors. Nor need such an approach accept a relativist position that all\nthe pasts of the Acropolis are, or should be regarded as, of equal interest to\nthe present day, what Werner Jaeger, the champion of the unique value of\nHellenism, despairingly called \u2018a night in which all cats are grey\u2019.14 Rather,\nwhile accepting that my approach is inescapably a product of my time, as\n12 \u2018The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there\u2019, the opening lines of the novel,\nThe Go-Between, by L.P. Hartley (1953), was made popular by the film of the same name.\n13 Quoted by Steinbock, 2012, p. 8. Other terms he notes are \u2018usable past\u2019, \u2018imagined and\nremembered history\u2019, \u2018cultural memory\u2019, \u2018believed history\u2019, and \u2018intentional history\u2019.\n14 Werner Jaeger, Paideia, The Ideals of Greek Culture, trans. Gilbert Highet, 2nd edition, 3rd\nprinting (New York: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. xxv. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 65\nwell as an attempt to escape from it, I would say that recovering a critical\nunderstanding of the succession of pasts and how those who inhabited\nthem understood their own pasts and possible futures, can both lessen the\nrisks to our intellectual independence and improve our understanding of\nour present situation.\n***\nSo how could such a history of looking best be attempted? How can we write\na history of transactions rather than of texts, of minds as well as of things?\nHistory, in the sense of the past as it occurred, has proceeded chronologically,\nbut historiography is inescapably counter-chronological, a looking back in\ntime from a here and now. And, as was remarked by Karl Marx:\nMen make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please;\nthey do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under\ncircumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.\nThe tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a mountain on the brain\nof the living.15\nIn the approach that I adopt, broadly counter-chronological with detours,\nI propose to excavate the conceptual and organising categories that were\napplied in various pasts, in the hope of discovering how they came into\nbeing, were circulated, modified, subsequently overlaid, and sometimes\nacted upon. In re-imagining the past, it may be safer to move in steps from\none layer back to its immediate predecessor, thus developing an incremental\nunderstanding of how the imagined past has come down to us, than to risk\nmaking a single large leap from the here and now. Indeed the history of\nmodern attempts to understand ancient Hellas is so replete with examples\nof cultural constituencies projecting back their own ideologies that it\nwould be possible to read it as a set of reminders of the risks. Although\nconcentrated on one specific object, this essay can therefore be taken as a\nresponse to Michel Foucault\u2019s call for an \u2018archaeology\u2019 or a \u2018genealogy\u2019 of\nknowledge, remembering that Foucault was not a theorist qua theorist, nor\nan ideologue, but a thinker whose ideas were founded upon his historical,\ncritical, and Enlightenment-inspired attempt to understand the otherness\nof the past, including ancient Hellas.\nFor such a study, the Acropolis of Athens offers some unique advantages.\nIndeed it is probably only the presence of these unique advantages that\nmakes a project with so many factors and feedbacks potentially feasible.\n15 Translated from the opening paragraph of The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). 66 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nFirstly, the record is unusually full and long. From the time when the\nHomeric poems were composed and recited (eighth or ninth century BC),\nand probably long before that, there have been many people living far from\nAthens who knew enough about the Acropolis to recognise allusions in both\nepics. And there have been few times since then when some knowledge of\nthe Acropolis has not been passed far from Athens across time and distance\nby word of mouth, by oral literature, by writings carried in manuscript\nand print, and by other media. And besides the direct reports of those who\nactually visited Athens, we also have many writings that were composed\nand promulgated in an attempt to influence ways of viewing. Admonitory\nwritings, provided we read them as indications of recommended ways of\nseeing, stories that attempt to make the mute stones speak, rather than as\nexamples of records of actual individual experiences, are a major resource,\nespecially for the long periods of time when we have few others. Indeed\nfor the task of recovering mainstream ways of seeing, the clich\u00e9d, the\nhumdrum, the derivative, and even the fake, are particularly useful, and\nfortunately they are abundant.\nSince the sources, although plentiful, are at all epochs heavily weighted\ntowards those produced by males from the richer socio-economic groups,\nwe are put on our methodological guard against arguing from the anecdotal\nto the general. Paradoxically, among the constituencies who have been\nlargely lost from the record are the people who spent much of their lives\nwithin the Acropolis precincts, such as the men and women who looked\nafter the buildings and serviced the rituals, the soldiers of the garrisons,\nand their women and slaves.\nA second huge and specific advantage is that, as an object of study, the\nAcropolis constitutes its own visual and interpretative frame. Some of the\nlocations in and around Athens from which viewers have chosen to look at\nthe Acropolis, and from which artists have presented their pictures, the \u2013\nusing a term adopted by Adam Smith \u2013 \u2018viewing stations\u2019 were consistent\nfor centuries, and we can be confident that it was to influence the seeing\nexperience of viewers standing on these stations that the built Acropolis\nwas designed during some epochs at least.16 The Acropolis matches the\nclassic definitions of landscape pioneered by J.B. Jackson and W.G. Hoskins\nas \u2018a portion of the earth\u2019s surface that can be comprehended at a glance\u2019,\nbut also as a text that is open to be read, and as a dynamic cultural process\nby which, by selective emphasis and exaggeration, human identities are\n16 Adam Smith, \u2018Of the Nature of that Imitation which takes place in what are called the\nImitative Arts\u2019, in Essays on Philosophical Subjects (London, 1795), pp. 131-84. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 67\nconstituted.17 Like a literary text in a book, or a painting hung in a picture\ngallery, that is as an object of view already boundaried, the Acropolis can\ntherefore be read, both historically, within past contexts, and critically in\naccordance with whatever modern criteria we may choose to apply.\nA third specific advantage is that, throughout its long history, the\nAcropolis has always been an officially controlled site. The legal as well\nas de facto ownership of the Acropolis, recognised against the legal norms\nof each epoch, including right of conquest and treaty of surrender, can\nbe traced back, through a succession of suzerainties, to ancient times\nmore or less continuously from 10th of April 1833 \u2013 the day when it was\nhanded over to the government of the recently established Greek nation\nstate, and its modern history began. Apart from occasional catastrophes\nof earthquake, fire, sacking or bombardment, every substantial change \u2013\nwhether the first flattening of the summit, the clearance of caves or the\nvegetation, the building of temporary barriers and walls, the digging of\npits, the design and the placement of fortifications, buildings, statues, and\ninscriptions, as well as their later removal \u2013 has required the approval\nof the authorities then in control, including those whose occupation was\nshort-lived. Removals from the site, of which there have been many, have\nalso required approval. In considering how changes to the appearance of\nthe Acropolis came about, the study need not therefore be thrown back on,\nor restricted to, notions of cultural emergence or emanation, that equate the\nminds of viewers with those of artists as expressed in their production, and\nis liable to fall into circularity and romanticism. It is legitimate to discuss\nthe whole history of the Acropolis, including the classical Acropolis, in\nterms of the aims, intentions, and hopes of the successive producers of its\nappearance, including the theories of cognition and of art and iconicity\nthat influenced their decisions, without of course assuming that they were\nalways successful in their aims. Because the sources are so rich we are also\nable to recover the political regulatory and the economic processes that\nbrought about the material Acropolis in various forms at various epochs. In\naddition to the cultural agendas we can recover the formal administrative\nprocesses by which approvals were given and projects financed (including\nby slave or forced labour) and then executed and accepted.\nIntroducing the political economy component brings out the extent to\nwhich the determining decisions about the appearance of the Acropolis,\n17 See the Introduction to I. Robertson and P. Richards (eds.), Studying Cultural Landscapes\n(London: Arnold, 2003) and W.J.T. Mitchell, Landscape and Power (Chicago: Chicago\nUniversity Press, 1994). 68 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nand often also how it should be mediated in words and pictures, were\ntaken not locally in Athens, but in ancient Rome, in Byzantine Nicaea\nand Constantinople, in Ottoman Istanbul, and in the capitals and other\ncities of modern western countries. Moreover decisions were often made\nor influenced by governments and international authorities and agencies,\nwhose agendas did not necessarily coincide with the wishes of the local\npeople of Athens, insofar as they are knowable. With the exception of the\nclassical period, almost all the written and visual works on which we are\nreliant for a history of looking were not produced locally in Athens, and even\nin the classical period many of the most famous writers, such as Aristotle,\ncame from elsewhere. The thought, still heard occasionally, that you have\nto be Athenian to understand the Acropolis, that implies an essentialism of\nnationalism, is especially out of place for a monument that has, for most of\nits history, been culturally constructed far from Athens, and that, even in\nthe classical period, counted a wish to influence non-Athenians among its\nexplicit aims.\nAmong the producers of the Acropolis, I therefore include the proposers\nand the instigators, the political and other institutions who voted the\nfunds, the designers, engineers, architects, artists, skilled and other\nworkers, whether forced or voluntary, both those who built and those\nwho destroyed, replaced, adapted or altered. Among the producers I also\ninclude the intermediaries who composed, made accessible, and published\nvisual representations, and those who attempted to regulate or influence\nthe viewing experiences of others, such as political (including religious)\nleaders, authors and educators. Among the consumers, I include both\nthose who saw the Acropolis directly with their own eyes and those who\nencountered it from a distance in images and words.\n***\nSo let me begin the dig by offering a photograph of the Parthenon today,\nprobably the most valued view of the Acropolis in recent times. Figure 5.1\nshows a view of the Parthenon that at the time of writing opens up to the\nvisitor arriving on the summit and following the tourist path. The pictures\nI show are mediations of mediations, and this offers advantages as well\nas potential losses. The once clear air of Athens, that was uniquely well\ncaptured by the technology of coloured aquatint, is now made even clearer\nwhen seen with the computer light behind in the online version. And we\ncan use zooms to improve our appreciation of how visual technologies\nachieved their effects. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 69\nFig. 5.1 The Parthenon from the north-west.\nThis is the temporary, constantly changing, Parthenon that visitors encounter\nand have encountered during the recent decades of conservation. It coexists\nwith images of the timeless Parthenon, shown without scaffolding or people,\nthat appears on the entrance tickets given to visitors, as shown in Figure 5.2.\nFig. 5.2 The Parthenon from the north-west. 70 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nIt is, almost without exception, the timeless Parthenon that is reproduced\nin the postcards, on the covers of guidebooks, and in the windows and\nfrontages of the shops and kiosks that surround the Acropolis, and elsewhere.\nA periphery of iconicity, we can say, pre-sets the Acropolis viewing\nexperience before visitors reach the site. And although there are occasional\ngrumbles that the conservation works are taking too long, contemporary\nviewers appear to have no difficulty in cognitively negotiating both images\nsimultaneously, eliding the scaffolds as easily as they elide the other\napparently temporary, but in reality permanent, modern fixtures that they\nsee on the Acropolis, such as the lamps for floodlighting. And just as the\nprinciples of the Venice Charter on the conservation of monuments, with\nwhich the recent Acropolis programme conforms, requires that viewers of\nthe Acropolis buildings are able to distinguish the ancient marble from the\nnew used in repairs, that is, to operate simultaneously in two temporalities,\nthey also operate simultaneously at different levels of cognition, seeing the\nactual stones, imagining what has been lost, and often also according the\nexperience some wider signification and meaning.18 In Figures 5.3, 5.4, and\n5.5, I trace the view back through the era of photography.\nFig. 5.3 The Parthenon from the north-west, c.1909 before the re-erection of\nthe colonnade in the 1920s.\n18 See http://www.international.icomos.org/charters/venice_e.pdf. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 71\nFig. 5.4 The Parthenon from the north-west.\nFig. 5.5 The Parthenon from the north-west, autumn 1839. 72 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nFigure 5.5 reproduces the first picture of the Parthenon made directly by\nthe technology of light on a chemical plate without artistic intervention,\nalthough since the daguerreotype camera produced only one copy it had to\nbe copied by an engraver. It shows how the lens of the camera made central\nthe little building that the salience of the selecting eye of a human viewer\nelided or ignored. The building was physically removed soon after.\nThe image reproduced as Figure 5.6, frequently re-engraved for half a\ncentury, accompanied The Travels of the Younger Anacharsis in Greece, the\nbook on ancient Greece that was most often encountered in all the main\nlanguages across western Europe and elsewhere from 1788 until into the\nage of photography and beyond.\nFig. 5.6 The Parthenon as it appeared in antiquity, as imagined in 1788.\nSince the 1830s, the actual Acropolis has gradually come to match the\nengravings of the eighteenth century whose artists imagined how the\nParthenon appeared in antiquity. It derives from the explicitly stated aim\nof those who, in 1834, decided that the four principal ancient buildings\nshould be visible from all sides.19 They regarded the buildings primarily as\n19 Costas Tsarouchas [publisher], \u2018Akropolis von Athen.\u2019 Facsimiles, with translations, and Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 73\nfree-standing works of architecture \u2013 rather than as a complex of stories in\nstone in which the official memory and values of the ancient polis had been\nvisually presented and around which they had been ritually performed.\nAnd it was not only the Parthenon as a building that was iconised but an\ninterpretative frame that excluded just as it included. We also see that\nthe net effect of the successive conservation interventions till now has\nbeen, step by step, to make the real Parthenon resemble the Parthenon as\nimagined in the eighteenth century. The most recent interventions, such\nas the introduction, for conservation and tourist-management purposes, of\nthe roped-off concrete path shown in Figure 5.1, have helped to entrench\nthat way of seeing the monument even further.\nFigure 5.7 reproduces a view of how the Acropolis summit looked\nwhen there was still a town on the summit, the Acropolis, taken from an\nimagined viewing station that was not available, except to birds.\nFig. 5.7 The Parthenon from the north-west, c.1805.\nThe modern view of the Parthenon only became available when the town\nwas removed in the nineteenth century. In this clearance the unsculpted\nmarble, stones, and tiles, almost everything that could be recycled as\ncomments on, a selection of twenty documents from the official papers in a file of the\nBavarian Regency Government, 1834 to 1842 (Athens: Alethea, 2012), p. 29, translated\nfrom the German. The decision was explicitly noted by Charles L\u00e9v\u00e8que, \u2018Les Etudes\narch\u00e9ologiques en Gr\u00e8ce\u2019, Revue des Deux Mondes, August 1851, p. 646. 74 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nbuilding materials, was sold and are now spread through modern Athens.\nEnormous quantities of earth, and the remains of eight thousand years of\nhuman and animal occupation, several metres deep, were dumped over\nthe walls on three sides as shown in Figure 5.8.\nFig. 5.8 The Acropolis south slopes around 1858.\nThe present Acropolis summit, we can say, is a triumph of science and\narchaeology, but it is also the result of a quite narrow way of viewing that\nlooks at ancient architecture, and even at ancient architectural sculpture,\nas discreet \u2018works of art\u2019, with insufficient regard to cityscape, context, or\nfunction.\nOne point about the recent conservation programme has, in my view,\nnot been sufficiently appreciated. Without fanfare, the ancient path that\ncircles the Acropolis on its slopes, long cordoned off with fences and\nbarbed wire, has recently been reopened. Visitors can now visit more\nsites, both natural and man-made, look at more vistas, and experience\nmore ways of seeing both directly and in their historical imagination,\nthan have been possible for half a century or more. The old photograph\nreproduced in Figure 5.9, taken when the Acropolis vegetation had been\ntemporarily scrubbed out, records a view of part of the ancient path that\nis no longer so clearly available. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 75\nFig. 5.9 The ancient path on the north side under the caves.\nTo the viewer looking up from the old town, as well as from distances far\nbeyond to the north, the row of column drums built conspicuously into\nthe defensive summit walls, still catches the attention. They are among the\nremains of the pre-classical buildings that were destroyed by the Persian\ninvaders in 480 BC. The Athenians of the classical age and later looking up\nfrom the centre of town, the agora where much of the daily life occurred,\nencountered every day this permanent reminder of the foreign invasion that\nhad once destroyed their material city, but not the real city, the people.20 It\nwas the remains of the older, destroyed, Parthenon that they mostly saw in\ntheir daily lives, not its classical replacement that lies outside the sightlines\nfrom the town on this side.\nThe path round the slopes was not an informal track beaten through\nthe vegetation made by generations of trespassing feet, although there are\n20 That the drums had been deliberately placed on the walls so as to be a visual reminder\nto the town below, suggested by Ludwig Ross in the 1830s and probably by others\nearlier, is discussed by Manolis Korres in \u2018A Conversation with Manolis Korres, Athena\u2019s\nWorship and the Semiology of the Monuments of the Acropolis\u2019, in M. Korres et al.\n(eds.), Dialogues on the Acropolis. Scholars and Experts Talk on the History, Restoration and\nthe Acropolis Museum (Athens: Skai Books, 2010), p. 144. 76 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nsome of these too. Cut into the rock the path was a designed and engineered\nfeature of the Acropolis and of the cityscape that, we can be confident, must\nhave been officially approved and financed by the city\u2019s authorities at some\nmoment in the remote past. Visually, as was noted by Aelios Aristides in\nhis panegyric of 155 AD, the road that circled the acropolis of a Hellenic city\nwas like a jewelled necklace, that unified as well as adorned.21 Inside, until\nthe nineteenth century, many caves were brightly coloured and lit. The\nacropolis of Smyrna, a colony of Athens that followed many of its customs,\nwas according to Aristides, laid out like an embroidered gown, another\ncomparison that reminds us that women were included in the metaphors,\nas well as in much of the iconography, of the ancient city.\nAlso visible from the town, and now visitable, is the Cave of Pan. Figure\n5.10 shows the present view looking out over the ancient agora, with the\nHephaisteion in the distance.\nFig. 5.10 The cave of Pan on the north slope, looking out.\n21 P. Aelius Aristides, \u2018A Monody for Smyrna\u2019, in The Complete Works, vol. II: Orationes XVII-\nLIII, ed. and trans. Charles A. Behr (Leiden: Brill, 1986), p. 7. Aristides imagines a viewer\nlooking down from above, but the metaphor works well looking from ground level. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 77\nIt was here, as the story was retold by Euripides, that Creusa was raped by\nApollo and to here that she secretly returned to give birth.22 Pan was given\nthe Cave by the Athenians as a reward for spreading \u2018panic\u2019 among the\nenemy at the battle of Marathon, but as we know from the satirist Lucian,\nhe did not much like it. It was noisy and cramped as I can confirm. The\nAthenians occasionally killed a goat in his honour, inappropriate, Pan\nthought, for he was half goat himself. No wonder, as Lucian tells us, Pan\nhated paying the tax as a non-domiciled resident, a non-dom.23\nOn the ancient path, visitors can now stand on the exact spot where in\nclassical Athens the young male Athenian citizens under military training\ntook their oath to defend the city and what it held sacred, and to increase\nits power.24 They can share the vistas across to the surrounding mountains\nand seas that visually enclose the territory within its natural amphitheatre,\nconfident that most of the famous men of classical Athens, whether poets,\nplaywrights, philosophers, historians, or politicians, once stood on this exact\nspot, regarding themselves at that moment as citizen-soldiers. Standing in\nranks with the steep Acropolis crags at their backs, the young men were\nobliged by the steepness of the Acropolis slope to look forward and outward,\nand to hold their ranks without jostling, as they might soon have to stand in\na real battle. Many rituals began on the slopes where the view was outward\nand unlimited to the horizon, before moving to the summit where the view\nis inward and confined. In ancient drama too, comedy as well as tragedy, the\nAcropolis slopes and the horizons of mountains and sea were always in sight,\nwith many of the best known ancient stories, such as those surrounding the\nfamilies of Orestes and Oedipus, firmly anchored to the visible landscape,\nboth close up, and to the mountains and seas on the horizons.\nThe Acropolis summit, especially now, is a place of imposed order, a\nclean, bare, enclosed, controlled environment of straight lines, built by\nhuman hands, where the natural world is unwelcome \u2013 every sprouting\nplant is immediately weeded out. In ancient Athens, the paths and the caves\nof the slopes were also integral to the ceremonial, ritual, and formal life of\nthe whole city, important to the cults favoured by non-citizens and slaves\nof both sexes as much as to those of citizens and their official wives and\n22 In the Ion.\n23 Lucian, Double Indictment, 9.\n24 The words of the oath are quoted by Lycurgus, Against Leocrates, i, 77. The wording\nmay have changed over the centuries but its essence remained unchanged and familiar,\nas was shown by P. Siewert, \u2018The Ephebic Oath in Fifth-Century Athens\u2019, Journal of\nHellenic Studies, 97, 1977, pp. 102-11. 78 Cultural Heritage Ethics\ndaughters.25 The peripatos too, a word that brings out the role of the path as\na place for peripatetics, performed social functions beyond its usefulness as\na road along which to move from A to B. As an unsupervised meeting place,\nit allowed, for example, political conspirators and transgressing lovers to\nescape inquiring eyes. As Lucian reports, Pan used to say that he had a\nthing or two he could tell about what he saw from his cave after nightfall.26\nA modern psychologist might look on the Acropolis as a layer of conscious\nhuman rationality resting on an unconscious swirl of dreams, desires, and\nfears.\nToday I think it is fair to say that the dominant way of looking at the\nAcropolis is as an archaeological and art-historical site. But it is also often\ninvested with modern political messages. That the Acropolis celebrates\nancient Athenian democracy is often presented as a fact \u2014 Athens as the\nbirthplace, or the cradle, of democracy, the political ancestor of modern\ndemocratic nation states.27 When we dig down through the layers, however,\nwe find that this imputation is seldom made before the mid-nineteenth\ncentury.28 From the epigraphic evidence of over forty cities it now appears\nthat, in the classical period, Athens was not unique in having a democratic\nform of government, nor was Athens the first.29 And although the\nParthenon was commissioned during the century when classical Athens\nwas governed by a democracy, albeit one confined to male citizens, there\nis little or nothing democratic in the iconography of the buildings, that, as\nthroughout the Hellenic world, present traditional scenes from local and\npan-Hellenic myths as was the convention long before the democracy\nbegan and continued after it had gone.\n25 The numerous peri-acropolitan cults are discussed by, for example, Robert Parker,\nPolytheism and Society at Athens (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 52. For the\nsanctuaries and cults on the slopes, and some recent photographs, see the conversation\nwith Constantinos Tsakos in Korres et al., 2010, pp. 166-87.\n26 D ouble Indictment, 11.\n27 For example \u2018The Athenian Democracy pervades all in the classical Acropolis\u2019, Korres et\nal., 2010, p. 7.\n28 A moment of transition may be Edward Bulwer Lytton\u2019s Athens: Its Rise and Fall, With\nViews of the Literature, Philosophy, and Social Life of the Athenian People, first published in\n1837 in which, as the full title indicates, the cultural achievement is brought into the\npolitical and moral history, although only as a supplement. The grand narrative histories\nof the eighteenth century, including Mitford and Ferguson, mostly favoured Sparta over\nAthens, and presented \u2018democracy\u2019 as a political system to be feared (summarised by\nOswyn Murray in his introduction to the bicentenary edition). In 1873, the historian\nEdward A Freeman, in an essay \u2018The Athenian Democracy\u2019, Historical Essays, Second\nSeries (London: Macmillan, 1873) suggested that \u2018the pre-eminence of Athens in literature,\nphilosophy and art\u2019 was the result, not the cause, of its democracy.\n29 Eric W. Robinson, Democracy beyond Athens: Popular Government in the Greek Classical Age\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011). Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 79\nAnother political way of looking at the Acropolis is to see it as a monument\nto the continuity of modern Greece back to ancient Hellas. In the recent\nbook prepared by the experts who managed the Acropolis conservation\nprogramme, the point was put in the form of a question: \u2018Why is it that\nGreeks regard these monuments as being theirs, regardless of whether or\nnot they visit them regularly or whether they really know them? Why do\nthey regard them as their very own, their \u201chome\u201d, the trademark of Greece\nthrough the ages and of the present day?\u201930 This way of looking appears to\nbe no longer much emphasised in Greece itself, being for example, largely\nabsent from the official educational programmes for Greek children\nvisiting the Acropolis.31 One of the clearest statements can be found in the\nspeech of Melina Mercouri of 12 June 1986, when as the Minister of Culture,\nspeaking in English, she addressed the students of the Oxford Union in\nEngland: \u2018You must understand what the Parthenon Marbles mean to us.\nThey are our pride. They are our sacrifices. They are our noblest symbol of\nexcellence. They are a tribute to the democratic philosophy. They are our\naspirations and our name. They are the essence of Greekness\u2019.32\nLike many nation states, in the nineteenth century Greece produced a\nseries of long, often learned, and apparently authoritative, histories that, by\nmixing historical fact, myth, ideology, and some self-congratulation, gave a\nunified narrative to the imagined community of \u2018the nation\u2019 as a metaphysical\nentity continuing in its essentials unchanged across time and situation. The\nhistorian Constantinos Paparrigopoulos, for example, in his six volume\nwork, first published between 1860 and 1877, commented on the long period\nbetween modern and ancient Hellas: \u2018The city of Athens still preserved its\nancient traditions, its love of beauty and reverence for the masterpieces of\nart \u2026 These descendants of the Athenians of the age of Pericles had indeed\nforgotten how to cultivate literature and the arts, but they had preserved the\nnobility of their race, and although they had lost its intellectual force, they\nretained its reverence for all that stirred the enthusiasm of their ancestors\u2019.33\nDespite much searching in recent decades, however, no-one has found any\nevidence for the local Christian Orthodox community before the Greek\nRevolution associating their own identity with the ancient ruins before\n30 B lurb to Korres et al., 2010.\n31 T he current official education programmes are described by Cornelia Hatziaslani in\nKorres et al., 2010, pp. 426-43.\n32 A vailable on the website of the Melina Mercouri Foundation: http://www.melina\nmercourifoundation.org.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Item\nid=49&lang=en\n33 Q uoted in translation by Demetrios Sicilianos, Old and New Athens (London: Putnam,\n1960), pp. 20-21. 80 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nthe 1790s, and that was under influences from expatriates.34 Nor is this\nsurprising as the last thing a theocracy wants is democracy, especially when\nit is associated \u2013 as it was in ancient Athens \u2013 with open intellectual debate.\nAn example of the transplanting of philhellenism into Greece, where it has\nsince become native, is shown as Figure 5.11.\nFig. 5.11 Greece, invoking Homer and the ruins of ancient Hellas,\ncalls on Europe for help, 1821.\nWithout implying that they are invalid just because they are historically\ncontingent, we can note that all the main contemporary ways of looking at\nthe Acropolis, the archaeological, the art historical, the romantic aesthetic,\nand the political, were invented and introduced during the last two centuries.\n***\nWithin a few years of the advent of photography, more images of the Acropolis\nhad been produced and distributed than in all previous millennia put together.\n34 A process discussed by, among others, Yannis Hamilakis, The Nation and its Ruins: Antiquity,\nArchaeology, and National Imagination in Greece (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007). Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 81\nThe photographers, while purporting to offer images that are direct analogues\nof reality (\u2018the camera cannot lie\u2019), that the photo-chemical technology appears\nto guarantee, soon adopted the techniques of fashion, advertising, opera and\ncinema, to produce imagined but unseeable images, using long ladders and\nspecial cameras to shoot from viewing stations that never existed in modern\nor ancient times. Figures 5.12 and 5.13 are examples of these images, icons\nof icons, a vision of an Eternal Greece produced for a global viewership.35 In\n\u2018Eternal Greece\u2019, there are usually no people, nor any clues to when the images\nwere made. By eliminating contingency, they eliminate time. Some, such as\nthe example in Figure 5.13, are deliberately archaised.\nFig. 5.12 Caryatid looking towards Philopappus, 1929.\n35 T he main pioneers and practitioners of the style from the arrival of photography to\nthe mid-twentieth century include, in rough chronological order, Robertson, Stillman,\nBonfils, Gkinakou, Margaritis, Constantine, Boissonas, Sebah of Constantinople,\nAntoine Bon, \u2018Nelly\u2019, Alnari, Ponten, Boudot LaMotte, Sir\u00e9n, Hoyningen-Huene, Hege,\nH\u00fcrlimann, Herbert List, Lukas, and \u2013 for moving images \u2013 Riefenstahl. 82 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nFig. 5.13 North-west corner of the Parthenon, 1923.\nThe makers of the modern Acropolis were not only the archaeologists and\nengineers, but the photographers, publishers, and postcard makers who\npresented an incorporeal Acropolis, hovering between realism and iconicity.\nPan, incidentally, Lucian tells us, complained that, as a plain country god\nfrom the Peloponnese, he could not understand words like \u2018incorporeal\u2019\nthat he often overheard in his cave wafting up from the philosophical\nacademies.36 It was a word that the satirist knew would always raise a laugh\nat the expense of the philosophers. In Timon, for example, Lucian has the\nplain-speaking Zeus complain about the philosophers that: \u2018One must sit\nwith one\u2019s ears plugged, if one does not want the drums of them cracked;\nsuch long vociferous rigmaroles about Incorporeal Things\u2019.37 In the eleventh\ncentury a small Byzantine Christian church, dedicated to \u2018the Incorporeals\u2019,\nwas built alongside the grand Roman ruin of Hadrian\u2019s Library, in which the\nancient philosophers had stored their books and conducted their classes in\nspecially designed rooms. The word may have been a Christian attempt to\nappropriate an ancient word still associated with the locality.\nModern coexisting ways of seeing are caught by the image at Figure 5.14.\n36 Double Indictment, 11. \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b5 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03b5\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f04\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bc\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03be\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f40\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1.\n37 Lucian, Timon, 9. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 83\nFig. 5.14 Viewing the Acropolis, c.1898.\nThis image, that itself has the clarity of a photograph, is probably copied\nfrom a photograph of a painting which had itself been composed from\nphotographs rather than from a personal visit by the artist, and there is no\nviewing station from where the scene could have been seen. A product of\nillusory realism, the image picks out some of the main ways of viewing since\nthe clearances. We see a western officer, such as Colonel Barry with whom\nI began, with his ladies, taking charge with his pointing arm. The elderly\nGreek, one of the former soldiers employed as guards, is lost in his own,\npossibly philhellenic, thoughts. We see an artist, and a man reading \u2013 maybe\nan ancient author or an archaeological guide-book. And in the background\nwe glimpse another man looking up, who may be internalising Eternal\nGreece. The lady who rebelliously breaks away represents the viewers who\nthroughout the ages have resisted the mainstream conventions. 84 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nWorking down to the eighteenth-century layers before the Greek\nRevolution below we find ways of viewing that were very different. Figure\n5.15 is a view of the Acropolis as seen from the town.\nFig. 5.15 The Acropolis as seen from the centre of Athens,\nby Edward Dodwell, c.1805.\nAlthough Athens was then a town of only about six to ten thousand\ninhabitants, it contained forty churches, over eighty chapels, and\neleven mosques. By its religious buildings, Athens visually presented\nits political and social organisation into religious communities, the\nmajority Orthodox Christians and about a quarter Muslim. There were\nalso a few hundred Africans. A visitor to Piraeus in 1809 saw only two\nships in the harbour, one exporting antiquities for Lord Elgin, the other\nimporting slaves from Africa.38\nTo the surprise of western architects, the classical buildings on the\nAcropolis mostly lay outside the sightlines from the town. It was only\nfrom a distance that the Acropolis appeared as a statue to be wondered at\nfrom all sides, in its unique light, as it had been celebrated in antiquity, as\nsome of the eighteenth-century artists tried to capture.\n38 John Galt, Letters from the Levant (London: Cadell and Davies, 1813), p. 127; Voyages and\nTravels, in the Years 1809, 1810, and 1811 (London: Cadell and Davies, 1812), p. 185. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 85\nFig. 5.16 The Acropolis as seen from a distance\nby an arriving traveller, c.1800.\nFigure 5.17 shows how the entrance to the Acropolis appeared during\nthe hundred years or so after an Ottoman refortification programme was\ncompleted sometime in the early eighteenth century until the changes\nbrought about during the Revolution that began in 1821.\nFig. 5.17 The Entrance to the Acropolis, Heinrich H\u00fcbsch, 1819. 86 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nWhat was unignorable was the huge Muslim cemetery with its mosque\nthat proclaimed to every viewer that Athens was part of the Ottoman\ndominions and had been inhabited by Muslims for four centuries \u2013 for as\nlong as Europeans had been settled in North America. In the eighteenth\ncentury the Muslim population spoke Greek as their first language.39\nFig. 5.18 The Muslim cemetery at the entrance to the Acropolis.\nIn my explorations in the area I have come across a few paving stones\napparently made from Muslim tombs, but as part of the Hellenising agenda\nthe cemetery was cleansed from sight, and from memory.\nIn the long eighteenth century, unlike today, the Acropolis visually\npresented the continuity of its long past back to mythic times. But here I\nnote two large differences between the experience of local viewers and that\nof visitors. For hundreds of years, hardly any of the Orthodox Christian\ncommunity of Athens ever saw inside the Acropolis as it had been a closed\nmilitary facility since at least the thirteenth century. By contrast, for visitors\n39 T he Turkish language \u2018in Greece where it is little understood, even by the Musulmans\nthemselves, and where its use is confined to the large cities, and some districts in Macedonia\u2019,\nWilliam Martin Leake, Researches in Greece (London: John Booth, 1814), p. iv. According to\nSicilianos, 1960, p. 20, \u2018The Turks who lived in Athens spoke a mixed language, mostly\ncomposed of Greek, and had forgotten their own language to such as extent that they could\nnot converse with members of their own race who came from abroad\u2019. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 87\nfrom western Europe, the desire to see the buildings on the summit was\ntheir main reason for being in Athens, and they could afford to pay to\ngain entrance to the site. The second big difference is the availability of\nexpectation-setting mediating images. In 1835 shortly after the Acropolis\nwas handed over to the newly independent Greek state, the authorities\nbegan to issue admission tickets, made by lithography. One was a map, the\nother a picturesque view.\nFig. 5.19 Admission tickets to the Acropolis, mid 1830s. 88 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThe map, that only notes the ancient buildings on the Acropolis, looks\nforward to the time when the town would be removed. The view, by\nincluding in its frame both a church and a camel train, keeps continuity.\nFigure 5.20 is an engraving of a bronze coin made in Athens during the\nRoman imperial period.\nFig. 5.20 A low denomination bronze coin issued in Athens,\nRoman period, probably first century AD.\nThat coin, catching the viewing experience of the ancient observer, picks out\nthe ancient way up to the Acropolis, past the Cave of Pan, up the steps, and\nit shows the bronze statue of Athena Promachos, and a classical building \u2013\nprobably the Propylaia not the Parthenon, or maybe just a generic temple.\nFor nearly two thousand years, from the time that this coin was struck until\nthe tickets of 1835, I do not know of a single visual representation of the\nAcropolis produced locally. And by local I include the whole Byzantine\nand Ottoman territories.\nThis absence, we can be certain, was not due to lack of technological or\nartistic skill. The government that built Haghia Sophia in Constantinople,\nthen the largest building in the world, had plenty of skills, and could import\nany that it did not have. What we see here \u2013 or rather do not see \u2013 is the\ncontinuing result of the decisions by the early church councils to forbid all\nbut Orthodox Christian art. And in this regard, as in many others, the law\nof Byzantium did not end with the fall of Constantinople but continued to\nbe applied in Athens until the Revolution of 1821. By contrast, visitors from\nthe west had not only read descriptions of Athens by ancient and modern\nwriters but had been prepared for the experience. And they found that\nmuch was indeed as they had been educated to expect. As Byron wrote:\nYet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild;\nSweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,\nThine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled,\nAnd still his honied wealth Hymettus yields. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 89\nAthena\u2019s owls still fluttered round the Acropolis. Every spring and autumn,\nalmost to the day, the storks mysteriously came and went, building their\nnests on the monuments as shown in Figure 5.21.\nFig. 5.21 \u2018A View of the Doric Portico at Athens in its present state\u2019, c.1751.\nIn ancient times an enclosed area of the Acropolis slopes had been called\n\u2018the place of the storks\u2019 (\u2018to pelargikon\u2019) a verbal slide from \u2018to pelasgikon\u2019\n(the place enclosed by the Pelasgians). It was a \u2018storkade\u2019, as one clever\ntranslator has put it, and we cannot fully understand ancient literature\nwithout reinserting the storks. For Enlightenment viewers, their acts\nof viewing, their makings of meanings, were attempts to use their\nimaginations to fill the gap between Nature, which they perceived as fixed,\nand the works of Man which were always changing. So the philosopher\nof history started with the storks. When wheeling high in formation in\nthe sky, the storks had the panoptic view that the human viewer longed\nto share. The storks had stable government. The older storks looked after\nthe younger ones, who, it was believed, cared for their parents. And in\nthe eighteenth century any storks unable to fly to Africa spent the winter 90 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nin the Ottoman governor\u2019s garden which offered social care, free at\npoint of delivery. Secure in their own little acropolises, generations of\nAthenian storks had observed the ups and downs of human history with\nindifference and condescension.\nBut what were the laws of human history that were so different from\nthe laws of Nature as practised by the storks? And how could they be\ndiscovered? The book that most helped to spread and entrench the\nphilosophical way of seeing was The Ruins by Count Volney, his meditations\non the ruins of empires, first published in French in 1788 on the eve of the\nFrench Revolution that he claimed to have predicted when looking at the\nruins of Palmyra. As he wrote of his investigative method: \u2018I will dwell\nin solitude amidst the ruins of cities: I will inquire of the monuments of\nantiquity what was the wisdom of former ages\u2019.40\nFig. 5.22 Volney\u2019s Ruins.\n40 Q uoted on title page of most editions and translations from chapter iv. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 91\nIn the eighteenth century the Athenian Acropolis was uniquely well suited\nto the search for unifying theories. More even than Rome, it visually\npresented a continuous story. Far into the nineteenth century, despite\nthe findings of science and scholarship, many histories start with \u2018the\nCreation of the World\u2019, as calculated from the biblical texts. They assume\na providentialism that takes as given that the course of history is under\na divine guidance that punishes as much as it saves. Many books play\nvariations on Athens its Rise and Fall, Athens, Elevation and Decline, Athens,\nGrandeur and Decay. To individuals and to societies, the Acropolis visually\npresented lessons that were universal, exportable, and relevant to current\npublic policy questions.\nBesides perambulating the Acropolis with eyes open, the philosopher\ntherefore spent time reflecting on the totality of his or her experience,\nfollowing the arguments, weighing the evidence, and fixing the lessons in\nhis memory. The philosopher viewed the Acropolis with his eyes closed.\nFig. 5.23 \u2018Byron\u2019s Dream\u2019, 1819. 92 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nBut what were these lessons? To account for the achievement of Athens, many\napplied the theory developed by Hume, Montesquieu, de Sta\u00ebl, and some\nof the ancients, that the character of a people is an outcome of the natural\nenvironment. The Thebans were stupid, the ancients had said, because Boeotia\nwas damp. Byron, picking up that tradition, noted that Lord Elgin came from\nScotland, \u2018a land of meanness, sophistry, and mist; /each breeze from foggy\nmount and marshy plain / Dilutes with drivel every drizzling brain\u2019.\nBut the climate of Athens is not always balmy, and its soil is rocky. It\nwas Sparta, which has a more pleasant climate and a more productive soil,\nthat had produced militarism. If the explanation for the achievement did not\nlie in Nature, it must lie in Man? So was it the institutions of the ancient\nAthenians that had led to their achievement, was their system of government,\ntheir commercial spirit, their democracy resting on a slave economy? But\nthen what about the long decline? For help in meditating on that question,\nthe philosophical viewer was visually assisted by the artistic conventions\nof the capriccio and the picturesque, and I show just one example of the\nimages that were most frequently encountered at the time, rather than those\ncommonly reproduced today.\nFig. 5.24 \u2018The Ruins of Athens\u2019. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 93\nTextbooks for artists, including a few that advise on how to present Greek\nruins, emphasised that accuracy was not important: the depiction of ruins\nmust always have a moral aim. Viewers looking at these images were\ninvited to ask themselves questions such as: why had Athens come to this?\nHad Athens been punished for its sins by divine providence? Like Sodom\nand Gomorrah, Nineveh and Tyre, Pompeii, and other ancient cities? And,\nif so, why had Athens been damned? Maybe too much luxury or free-\nthinking? And if Athens had it coming, then others had better look out too,\nas many warned. The explanation that carried most conviction to viewers\nfrom the west is that the failure must lie in the essential character of the\npeople. The main early theorist of racism, Robert Knox, drew heavily upon\nthe Acropolis, as shown in his book.\nFig. 5.25 The Parthenon as a symbol of the superiority\nof the northern white races.\nWith the invocation \u2018wonderful and most mysterious race! divinest chapter\nin human history! unparalleled, unequalled, whence came ye? Whither have\nye gone, fading away into the mists of the past?\u2019 Knox, a medical anatomist,\nwho assumed that ancient men and women looked like the ancient statues\nfrom the Parthenon that he had studied in the British Museum, uncritically\nreversing from icon to actual, declared that the Ancient Hellenes were a 94 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nblue-eyed race directly akin to the modern Germans and Scandinavians.\nAnd across the Europeanised world the old idea that the genius of the\nancient Hellenes was due to the natural environment merged with the\nnew idea of essential racial differences. For example the Right Rev. J.A.\nMcClymont, who provided what he probably assumed were uncontentious\nmainstream words to accompany the first popular book to employ colour\nin prints, remarked: \u2018The inhabitants belonged to a good stock, the Indo-\nGermanic, while their geographical position and surroundings were well\nfitted to develop a high type of manhood\u2019.41 And the line goes to Nazism,\nthe German occupation of the Acropolis in 1941, and the systematic killing\nof those regarded as racially inferior.\nFig. 5.26 The German flag flying over the Acropolis, 1941.\nNazi racial theories had many roots, of which the Acropolis was not the\nmost important. But it is striking that while during the occupation, the\nGermans inflicted unspeakable suffering on the people, including mass\nexecutions, genocides of the Greek-Jewish community, enslavement, and\nthe burning down of churches and monasteries, they made scarcely a\nscratch on the Hellenic monuments.42 Ernst Buschor, a famous professor,\n41 John Fulleylove, Greece Painted by John Fulleylove. Described by Right Rev. J.A. McClymont\n(London: Black, 1906), p. 3, and in the editions of the 1920s.\n42 T he contradictions between the philhellenic admiration for ancient Athens and the Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 95\nin a book published in Germany during the war, repeated the myth that\nthe ancient Greeks were a Nordic people who had come from the north.\nIn a little book, War in the age of the Parthenon that was given out to soldiers\nand students, he links their struggles to those between Hellenes and\ncentaurs represented in the metopes of the Parthenon, that are indeed,\nin modern terms an aestheticisation of interracial violence. In a preface,\nBuschor makes explicit the German claim to be the new Hellenes by\ndedicating his book to the soldiers \u2018who have died for the Great Hellenic\nheritage on the borders of the west\u2019.43\nMeanwhile, some viewers preferred to turn away from the Acropolis\nand look instead at the hill of the Areopagos nearby where, according to\nthe author of The Acts of the Apostles, Paul had presented his ideas in a\nseminar of two of the Athenian philosophic schools. In this way of looking,\nthe Areopagos was offered as an alternative \u2013 a superior \u2013 acropolis,\nand one which the early Christians had provided with its own mythic\nassociations centred round Dionysius the Areopagite who is only known\nfrom one sentence in the Acts of the Apostles \u2013 but who was given a full\nbiography, an iconic visage, and a large body of pseudonymous writings.\nThe Areopagus is bare. The church and episcopal palace that had formerly\nstood there, had been destroyed at least once by earthquakes and rock\nfalls, divine providence in this case punishing the Orthodox Christians.\nInstead, the Areopagus was reimagined as triumphing.\nFig. 5.27 \u2018Mars Hill, Athens\u2019.\nGerman treatment of the Greeks whom they regarded as Slavic, with enslavement and\nmass killings are described by Mark Mazower, Inside Hitler\u2019s Greece: The Experience of\nOccupation, 1941-44 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1993).\n43 \u2018 die auf griechischem Boden und an anderen R\u00e4ndern des Abendlandes f\u00fcr das Grosse\nGriechische Erbe fielen\u2019, Ernst Buschor, Das Kriegertum der Parthenonzeit (Munich, 1943). 96 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThere is a large body of texts of nineteenth-century, mainly western, Christian\ngroups who compare the Acropolis unfavourably with the Areopagus, that\nis ancient Hellenism with Christianity. Some are fanatical, violent and\ntriumphalist, others forgiving or trying to have it both ways. The counter-\nAcropolitans, as we can call them, were however united by their hostility\nto what the classical Acropolis represented, that they described, typically,\nas \u2018the very citadel of Grecian paganism\u2019 \u2018all rank idolatry\u2019.44 Their largely\nforgotten texts give us, I suggest, an insight into the range of reactions at\nthe end of antiquity, a time when the contest between the values of ancient\nHellenism was gradually being won by the incoming Christians, for which\nthe surviving record is heavily weighted towards the point of view of the\nvictorious theocrats.\nBut before turning to Byzantium I want instead to return to another\nway of seeing invented in the eighteenth century, the aesthetic. Could it be,\nsome asked, that the buildings of the Acropolis preserved some essence of\nHellenism that was independent of their associations? The aesthetic way\nof viewing, unlike the philosophical, does not need active viewers. On the\ncontrary, it claims to be an autonomous domain of meaning. The aesthetic,\nbeing immaterial, is exportable. By the end of the eighteenth century, Europe\nwas already filled with new buildings modelled on the ancient buildings of\nAthens and North America followed. I show a picture by the architect James\n\u2018Athenian\u2019 Stuart, who did more than anyone to export aesthetic Hellenism.\nFig. 5.28 The essence of the Athenian Acropolis exported to England.\n44 T he quotations are from James W. Hott, D.D., Journeyings in The Old World (Dayton, OH:\nUnited Brethren Publishing House, 1884), p. 221, and Photograms of an Eastern Tour. \u2026 By\n\u03a3. With original illustrations (London: [Bungay printed], 1859), p. 126. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 97\nStuart imagines the ancient architect Mnesikles showing his plans for the\nPropylaia to Pericles and the other famous men of the time. The Cave of\nPan and the stairs up to the Acropolis \u2013 and the usual non-existent view of\nthe Parthenon. The building on the right is a gentleman\u2019s library. England,\nsuch buildings proclaim, has imported the essence of the classical Acropolis.\nBritain is the new Athens. And the style in which the ancient values were\nexpressed could be copied. And it was a small step from exporting the\nincorporeal aesthetic to exporting the actual stones. It is this way of seeing,\nan attempt to separate the aesthetic from the historical and geographical\ncontext, that encourages the collecting of \u2018unprovenanced\u2019 antiquities,\nthat continues to damage our ability, and that of future generations, to\nrecover knowledge of the ancient world. Figure 5.29 reproduces a French\nlithograph showing Elgin that I only found a few years ago.\nFig. 5.29 \u2018Lord Elgin interrupts his meditations\u2019. 98 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThis illustration nicely captures a transition from the philosophical mode\nof viewing where the viewer\u2019s experience is central, to the aesthetic notion\nthat meaning can inhere in stones.\n***\nDigging down deeper to the seventeenth century, we see that when the\nmodern scientific on-the-spot study of the Acropolis began in the 1670s,\nmuch was immediately re-discovered about the ancient sites and buildings.\nScholars from the west, unlike the local people of that time, had access to\nthe printed works of the Leiden scholar, Johannes Van Meurs, known as\nMeursius, who, half a century before, had patiently collected and published\nall the references in the surviving works of the ancient authors that had\nbeen recovered and printed at the rime of the European Renaissance \u2013 a\ncorpus not much enlarged since. And when we dig through to the local\nlayers below the 1670s, we find a curious pattern. During the entirety of the\nperiod between the Christian takeover of the eastern empire at the end of\nantiquity and the encounter that began in the 1670s, not only are there no\npictures of the Acropolis made locally in the whole Byzantine and Ottoman\nterritories, but, in the vast surviving literature of Byzantium, mentions of\nAthens can be counted on the fingers of two hands.45\nThe three that can have any claim to represent local ways of seeing\nduring the long millennium share some characteristics. The authors, or as we\nshould perhaps call them, the story-tellers, know the names of some ancient\nHellenic authors, but have no understanding of who they were or of what\nthey wrote. They are all \u2018philosophers\u2019.46 Secondly, it is extremely difficult\nto date the time of composition from internal evidence, with some scholars\nputting the longest of the three texts as early as the ninth century and others\nas late as the seventeenth. The problem arises because they make little\ndistinction between what still existed to be seen and what they say had once\nbeen there. In this running together of the see-able and the only imaginable,\nthe stories are akin to the \u2018meaningful history\u2019 narratives now classified as\npost-colonial, that put first the perceived needs of their present. Like the\nnineteenth-century western Christian viewers of the Areopagus, they are\n45 M ost of those that refer to Athens as a place are noted by Filippomaria Pontani,\n\u2018EK\u039bE\u039bEIMMEN\u039b EPEI\u03a0IA.

I shall\npublish another that I have recently discovered in the forthcoming book.\n46 I n this regard the accounts resemble that of the seventeenth-century Ottoman traveller Celebi,\nwho although highly privileged and by the standards of his cultural group well educated,\nrespects the ancient \u2018philosophers\u2019 but knows little about them beyond their names. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 99\nsecure in their triumphalism, and it is the places they associate with defeated\nideas, notably the outdoor sites where the ancient philosophers held their\nmeetings that they pay most attention to, not quite dancing on their graves,\nbut picking out as \u2018theatres and schools\u2019, meaning, in the Greek, \u2018things to\nbe looked at and learned from\u2019. Over a thousand years, a Christian theocracy\nmonopolising education and art, had imposed a set of Christian myths on the\nancient cityscape, on its buildings, and on its rituals. The long Akathist [\u2018not\nseated\u2019] Hymn, that is still chanted in Orthodox Churches, composed long\nbefore it was adopted into ritual in 626, shows traces of the deep hatred of\nHellenic Athens by the early Christians. In one passage, verse 17, not always\nnow sung, the congregation collectively rejoice that their goddess, Mary, has\ntriumphed over the ensnaring logic of the philosophers.47 And there are other\ntraces of this way of seeing. For example, the church of Saint Philip facing the\nAcropolis displays a modern image of the mythic visit of one of the disciples\nof Jesus to Athens where he was said to have confuted the arguments of the\nphilosophers, as shown in Figure 5.30.\nFig. 5.30 Confuting Hellenism. Mosaic on the church\nof Saint Philip facing the Acropolis.\n47 \u2018 Orators most eloquent do we behold mute as fish before you, O Theotokos; for they\nare at a loss to explain how you could remain a virgin and yet give birth. But as for\nus, marvelling at this mystery, we cry with faith: Rejoice, Vessel of the Wisdom of God.\nRejoice, Treasury of His providence. Rejoice, you who proves the philosophers fools.\nRejoice, you who proves the logicians illogical. Rejoice, for the subtle debaters are\nconfounded. Rejoice, for the inventors of myths are faded away. Rejoice, you who breaks\nthe webs of the Athenians. Rejoice, you who fills the nets of the Fishermen\u2019. Translation\ninto English made by Vincent McNabb in 1934: http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/\npages/Akathist.htm. 100 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThere is space for only a few remarks about how the Acropolis may\nhave been viewed in antiquity \u2013 a long period of time but since viewing\nconventions were long-lived, some general points can, I suggest, be made.\nFirst, the ancient perception of the landscape and the cityscape was highly\npoetic, and so is the art in which landscape and cityscape were presented.\nFigure 5.31 shows a mosaic of which there are two versions both probably\nderived from a famous picture.\nFig. 5.31 Mosaic of the Villa of Siminius Stephanus.\nIt shows seven men, probably the Seven Sages, with their human scientific\nand artistic instruments. In the corner what appears to be a green-walled\nsanctuary, possibly Delphi or the Acropolis of Athens, is represented as it\nwas encountered by the viewer, as a forest of marble dedications. The border\nof the mosaic, with gorgons and masks, is a common poetic representation\nof a physical natural border, like the Acropolis slopes. Looking at the Acropolis of Athens from Modern Times to Antiquity 101\nIn ancient times, to judge from the authors, it was the Acropolis that\nprovided the main interpretative frame, rather than any of the buildings\nsuch as the Parthenon. From Julian back to Homer, it is the Acropolis that\nis appealed to, whether to warn, to shame, to educate or to celebrate. And\nit is the whole visible Acropolis rock, slopes and summit, myth and history,\nthe natural as much as the man-made. Memory slips away, but memory\ninstantiated in marble, or in literature and ritual, has a better chance. To the\nancient Athenians the aspiration was to create not an Eternal Greece, but\nan Eternal \u2018Athenianness\u2019, a history but especially also an expression of the\nvalues of the society, the famous notion of \u2018paideia\u2019. And as is made explicit\nby Aristides, this aspiration was achieved \u2018by viewing and remembering\u2019.48\nAs the site where the official memory and official values were preserved\nand displayed, the ancient Acropolis tolerated a good deal of alternative,\neven of contradiction, provided that it was filtered through the shared\nsystem of signs constituted by myth. We see none of that fear of art, and\nthe urge to destroy it, to allow it to be used only for approved purposes,\nto keep it indoors, to allow two dimensions but not three, and to control\nboth the production and consumption, that is such a feature of the long\nmillennium of theocracy that followed.\n***\nSo what, if any, more general conclusions emerge from this brief summary\nof the long history of ways of looking at the Acropolis of Athens? As an\nembodiment of numerous, mostly incommensurate, imagined pasts\nand ideologies over thousands of years, it offers a uniquely full case\nfor investigating the processes by which the past has been understood,\nmisunderstood, misrepresented, claimed, mythologised, and presented\nand packaged for the current purposes within different societies. And\nhow it can be drawn into an explanatory, but also often into an allegedly\nlegitimating, relationship with the present and the future. In the richness\nof its retrievable historical experience, the Acropolis of Athens is an\ninheritance as precious as the marble.\nThe read-across questions for those responsible for ancient and historic\nmonuments round the world therefore come tumbling out. Which pasts\ndeserve to be preserved? How should any current generation regard its\n48 Aristides, Panathenaic oration, 154. 102 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nresponsibilities to its predecessors and its successors? Is it possible, or\ndesirable, to recover the historically typical and not just the unusual? Should\npreference be given to what is now regarded as valuable, remembering\nthat such judgments change, as the thousand years of hostility, indifference\nand neglect of the Acropolis vividly demonstrates? How far can those with\nresponsibility offset the modern consumerism that treats the past as a\nresource to be exploited, for tourism, or for building a sense of community,\nsuch as nation or religion, and thus instilling a false view of the past\ndriven by present day ideological objectives? Is there a legitimate place\nfor \u2018epistemic cooperation\u2019, a phrase invented recently to describe an\nadministrative process that ensures that archaeologists, lawyers, \u2018heritage\nprofessionals\u2019 and others have a right to be heard in the decision taking.49\nPragmatic solutions of this kind, however, that sidestep the competition\nbetween the truth claims, risk both slipping into relativism and enabling\nthe loudest and politically most powerful voices to force their way.\nThe dead have no rights nor do I suggest that they should be given any.\nIndeed much of our knowledge of ancient Hellas comes from excavating\ngraves, setting aside the wishes of those who mourned and commemorated.\nHowever, I suggest, we owe it to ourselves and to our children to be as\ntruthful as we can about the past. The Venice Charter was a commendable\nattempt to devise an inter-generational ethics aimed at saving the\nmateriality of ancient buildings, based on notions of stewardship and\nrespect for the autonomy of the past and of the future. In the modern west\nwe have well-tried protocols for assessing the validity of research into the\npast, including into myth-making, of which evidence, openness, and free\ndebate are amongst the most important. Perhaps, given the present threats,\nthe time has come to build into that tradition a code of ethics for those who\nclaim to make the mute stones speak?\n49 T he phrase \u2018epistemic cooperation\u2019 is used by Geoffrey Scarre and Robin Coningham,\nAppropriating the Past: Philosophical Perspectives on the Practice of Archaeology (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2013), p. 6. 6. South Asian Heritage and\nArchaeological Practices\nSudeshna Guha\nI\nStudies of the histories of heritage inevitably lead us to disciplinary\nintrospection. As with the scholarship of heritage studies elsewhere,\nresearch into South Asian heritage has developed from considerations of\ntangible heritage, and through a focus on the social biographies of historical\nmonuments, built environments and landscape. Academic projects are fed\nby the non-academic \u2018heritage industry\u2019 in which civilisational histories are\nroutinely invented and used as commercial capital for the global market\nthrough the creation, circulation and display of \u2018historically seminal\nmonuments\u2019. An apt example is the replication of the second-century BC\nBuddhist stupa at Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh, India) as the India Pavilion at\nthe Shanghai Expo in March 2010. This architectural adaptation, which left\na \u2018deep impression\u2019 upon one of its more important visitors, the Chinese\nPremier, was aimed at conveying the \u2018universalistic values of peace, and the\nmessage of healing the harm we bring upon nature\u2019.1 Such acts of rewriting\nthe forms and meanings of historical topography facilitate the bringing\nhome of \u2018venerable\u2019 heritage from foreign lands, as we see in the case of\nthe recent building of the Taj Mahal at Sonargaon (Bangladesh), and the\nconstruction of a version of the Sanchi stupa at Louyang (China) between\n1 \u2018China PM visits India pavilion at Shanghai Expo\u2019, The Times of India, 31 October 2010,\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/China-PM-visits-India-pavilion-at-Shanghai-\nExpo/articleshow/6845554.cms\n\u00a9 Sudeshna Guha, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.06 104 Cultural Heritage Ethics\n2008 and 2010. Although each instance of re-evaluation, adaptation and\nreplication of tangible and intangible heritage pursues different aims,\nall demonstrate the importance of engaging with the history of the\nreproduction of monuments as the \u2018performative spaces\u2019 within which new\nmeanings of the \u2018actual objects\u2019 are created.2\nInevitably, the rewriting of heritage as global capital drives academic\nstudy of the \u2018careers\u2019 and \u2018travels\u2019 of objects and monuments. Within the\ncontext of South Asia, this scholarship has created an important analytical\ncorpus regarding the ways in which the reproduction of historical\nmonuments shape \u2018popular imaginaries of the disciplines of archaeology\nand anthropology\u2019 and serve \u2018as grounds on which professional\nknowledge came to be configured within new public domains of display\nand scholarship\u2019. However, the pioneering scholarship focuses exclusively\nupon the colonial and post-colonial histories of heritage-making, and in\nhistoricising the relationship between archaeological practices and the\nheritage industry, reinforces the theory \u2013 unproblematically presented in\nall histories of Indian archaeology \u2013 that the antiquarian study of South\nAsia through the region\u2019s historical monuments, sites and objects was\na \u2018western cognitive entity\u2019.3 The long pre-colonial histories of heritage-\nmaking within the Indian subcontinent not only demonstrate the errors of\nthis thinking, but also throw into sharp relief the fact that British orientalist\nhistoriography conspicuously celebrated the \u2018coming of antiquarianism\ninto India\u2019 for denying native historical consciousness.\nThe orientalist historiography, which was established in the eighteenth\ncentury, no doubt inspired the pioneering British archaeologist of India,\nAlexander Cunningham (1814-93), to establish the history of antiquarian\nscholarship of India through the statement that \u2018the study of Indian\nantiquities received its first impulse from Sir William Jones, who in 1784\nfounded the Asiatic Society of Bengal\u2019.4 However, when we reflect upon the\namassing of old manuscripts, paintings, curiosities and objects of art within\n2 B.

Furthermore, despite the different intellectual genealogies\nof viewing, collecting, copying and connoisseurship in the seventeenth-\ncentury Mughal domain and Britain and Europe, the descriptions of\nmonuments and artefacts from the former were rather similar in nature to\nthe descriptions that were considered essential by the growing breed of self-\nstyled British and European antiquaries to document the incorruptibility\nof material sources. An example is Emperor Jahangir\u2019s description of the\nJami Masjid in Ahmedabad, which he saw in his eleventh regnal year, on 6\nJanuary 1617/18, and recorded in his Jahangirnama as follows:\nThis mosque is a monument left by Sultan Ahmad, the founder of the city of\nAhmedabad. It has three gates, and on every side a market. Opposite the gate\nfacing the east is Sultan Ahmad\u2019s tomb. Under the dome lie Sultan Ahmad,\nhis son Muhammad, and his grandson Qutbuddin. The length of the mosque\ncourtyard exclusive of the maqsura is 103 cubits; the width is 89 cubits. Around\nthe perimeter of the courtyard is an arcade with arches four and three-quarters\ncubits wide. The courtyard is paved in cut brick, and the pillars of the arcade\nare of red stone. The maqsura contains 354 columns, and above the column is\na dome. The length of the maqsura is 75 cubits, and the width is 37 cubits. The\nmaqsura paving, the mihrab, and the pulpit are of marble.5\nJahangir\u2019s description undermines the assertion of Cunningham\u2019s latest\nbiographer that the \u2018earliest notices and descriptions of Indian monuments,\narchitecture and sculpture are to be found in the writings of sixteenth-\nand seventeenth-century European travellers\u2019.6 It also exemplifies Alain\nSchnapp\u2019s contention, based on his research into histories of historical\nenquiries, that \u2018in widely differing circumstances, and given similar\nassemblages, antiquaries may produce similar statements\u2019.7 The British\npioneered archaeological practices within the Indian subcontinent\nduring the nineteenth century, and historians of South Asian archaeology\ncontinue to follow Cunningham in tracing archaeology\u2019s genealogy\n5 The Jahangirnama: Memoirs of Jahangir, Emperor of India, ed. and trans.

Yet identifying antiquarian\nscholarship in South Asia as a European quest also perpetuates the\ntraditions of colonial historiography, which were developed by the British\nadministrative scholars of the East India Company, and which declared the\nnatives of Hindustan to be historically unconscious because they did not\nundertake historical enquiries. In this respect, the post-colonial histories\nof South Asian archaeology, which emphasise the need to research\nthe agency of \u2018native\u2019 scholarship, pose a paradox, as they enshrine the\ndictates of the colonialist and orientalist historiography, namely that there\nwas little consciousness of historical scholarship within pre-colonial India.\nThe histories asserting a western origin for antiquarianism in the Indian\nsubcontinent have, moreover, been uncritically used to write the grand\nhistories of world archaeology, and as a result the latter wrongly promote\nthe idea that \u2018systematic antiquarianism did not develop in India prior to\nthe colonial period. Despite impressive intellectual achievements in other\nfields, Indian scholarship did not devote much attention to political history,\nperhaps because the Hindu religion and division of socio-regulatory forces\nbetween high priests and warriors directed efforts to understanding the\nmeaning of life and of historical events more towards cosmology\u2019.8\nBeyond the South Asian sphere, most twentieth-century archaeologists,\nunlike Schnapp, have viewed antiquarian scholarship as a project of\nmodernity within the Enlightened European world. In determining\nperiodisation, they have made a distinction between acts of valorisation\nof the past in ancient and pre-modern times, and a conscious approach\ntowards historical enquiry through antiquities from the late-sixteenth\nand early-seventeenth centuries onwards. This periodisation has been\nwidely accepted within the growing twenty-first-century archaeological\nscholarship of heritage studies, in which the origins of a heritage-conscious\nsociety are traced back to the emergence of an educated public sphere\nin Europe during the seventeenth century, that responded to the milieu\nof rising national consciousness with efforts to seek out and control the\npast through laws and objective field explorations.9 The understanding of\nrational enquiries and \u2018proper\u2019 histories and history writing as products\n8 B.

Carman (eds.), Heritage Studies:\nMethods and Approaches (London and New York: Routledge, 2009), pp. 3-10. South Asian Heritage and Archaeological Practices 107\nof the modern western world, which the above periodisation fosters,\nclearly echoes British colonial histories of antiquarian scholarship in India.\nHowever, heritage archaeologists, who rightly promote the intellectual\nneed to interrogate the dominance of \u2018western\u2019 historiographical traditions,\nhave overlooked the glaring borrowings from a historiography they\nexplicitly reject in their own histories of the origins of heritage practices.\nIn thinking through the histories of heritage-making within South\nAsia, we become aware that the acts of replicating historical monuments,\nsuch as the building of a Taj Mahal and Sanchi stupa at Sonargaon and\nLouyang respectively, may have extended well beyond the widely-known\ntwelfth-century AD example of the Buddhist temple at Bodh Gaya, which\nwas reproduced at Pagan on the orders of the ruler Kayanzittha so that\nhis subjects could worship at their venerable shrine. The repeated reuse\nof the rock and pillar edicts of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (268-31 BC)\nfrom the first century, by Mahakshatrapa Rudradaman (c.150 AD), until at\nleast the seventeenth century, by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir (r.1605-27\nAD), indicate the disparate histories of conscious acts of memorialisation,\nand encourage us to look beyond the \u2018western\u2019 historiography of the\norigins of heritage practices. Furthermore, we also note that the restoration\nof tombs and mosques, of which there are numerous examples from the\nDelhi Sultanate (specifically between c.1369 and 1503 AD) and the Mughal\ndynasties (especially from Aurangzeb\u2019s rule 1658-1707 AD), echo many\naspects of the nascent nineteenth-century archaeological restoration\nprojects, in that they were political acts aimed at redefining the way sacral\nand historical spaces were experienced. Also worthy of note, therefore, are\nthe popular perceptions within India regarding archaeological practices\nduring the early twentieth century, when archaeological undertakings\nand scholarship were both becoming increasingly visible through the\nconservation work and excavations of the colonial Archaeological Survey.\nThe following remark with which the members of the Delhi Municipal\nCommittee feted the departing Viceroy George Nathaniel Curzon (1899-\n1905) is representative:\n\u2018It would not be too much to say that your Excellency has bridged over the\n500 years since the time of the Emperor Feroz Shah Tughlak, who was what\nwould be called in modern parlance as Delhi\u2019s first great archaeologist\u2019.10\n10 13 November 1905; Lord Curzon\u2019s farewell to India: being speeches delivered as viceroy &\ngovernor-general of India, during Sept.-Nov. 1905 (Bombay: Thacker and Co., 1907). 108 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nCurzon remains the principal architect of the archaeological restorations\nof historical India, which he facilitated through the restitution of the\nArchaeological Survey of India in 1902. Yet it is only by looking beyond\nthe connected histories of archaeological practices and heritage that we\nare able to establish more precise cultural histories of history-making and\nheritage practices within South Asia.\nII\nIn reviewing the archaeological scholarship of heritage we are shown the\nways in which inferences are often transformed into material evidence. The\nBritish scholarship of Indian archaeology began from the nineteenth century\nand was initiated with the aim of uncovering ancient India\u2019s supposedly\npristine \u2018Buddhist\u2019 cultural legacy. Among the early excavations that were\nundertaken were those by Alexander Cunningham at the Dhamek Stupa\nin Sarnath near Banaras between 1834-36. Through them Cunningham\ninitiated his \u2018Buddhist archaeology\u2019 of India, which gathered further\nmomentum after the Great War of 1857, largely because of his leadership\nof the Archaeological Survey of India between 1861-65 and 1871-85. In 1863\nMatthew Sherring of the London Missionary Society excavated at Banaras\nwith the aim of demonstrating the presence of Buddhism in the city\u2019s\nfoundational history. It is clear from the focus of both Cunningham\u2019s and\nSherring\u2019s excavations at Sarnath and Banaras respectively, that the British\nlaunched their \u2018archaeology of India\u2019 to establish a counter-narrative to the\nprevalent \u2018Hindu\u2019 civilisational history of the natives, which they dismissed\nas mere Brahmanic propaganda. By establishing archaeological, and hence\ntangible, evidence of a physically absent religion, the excavators sought to\ndemonstrate that just as Buddhism had disappeared from India despite\nbeing the national religion for more than 500 years, so too could Hinduism.\nAs well as calling into question the place of Hinduism in India\u2019s\ncivilisational history, the archaeological finds of Buddhist sites and\nmonuments supposedly ruined and destroyed by the ascendant Muslim\nrulers from the twelfth century onwards provided visual evidence to support\nthe new Raj\u2019s depiction of the Muslims as destroyers of all that was glorious\nin India\u2019s ancient heritage, while also illustrating the relative benevolence\nof the British towards their heathen subjects. This archaeological history\nthus demonstrates how historical landscapes are continuously refashioned\n\u2018to instantiate particular histories and historicities\u2019, and so exemplifies the South Asian Heritage and Archaeological Practices 109\nmanner in which archaeological scholarship of ancient civilisations can\ncontribute towards the construction of intangible heritage. 11\nThe material evidence of civilisational origins and legacies, and of\npast perceptions of cultural geographies, identities and traditions, which\nthe archaeological scholarship of \u2018prehistoric\u2019 and archaic civilisations\nroutinely produces, undermines the assumption that heritage is inherently\nknowable. However, perhaps because of the palpable materiality of\narchaeological data, the archaeological literature of the history of heritage\npractices often misleadingly conveys the assumption that heritage\ncan be discovered, recorded, and mapped, despite the fact that many\narchaeologists now increasingly search for innovative, discipline-specific\nmethodologies to help clarify the ways in which \u2018interpretations may be\nconstructed from data\u2019.12 As the theories discussed below regarding the\nIndus (or Harappan) Civilisation illustrate, the archaeological constructs\nof civilisational heritage force us to revisit some old-fashioned disciplinary\nconcerns, such as explanations for cultural continuity and change, schema\nof classifications and periodisation, and the kinds of data that are selected\nas evidence of cultural boundaries. Critical reviews of the archaeological\nconstructs would show the shifts and transformations over time in\nnotions of valid evidence, and encourage us to reconsider the existing\nmethodologies by which material traits are translated into cultural forms.\nIn this they also remind us of the need to consider the ethical aspects of\nheritage-making and its scholarship.13\nIII\nThe object of sustained archaeological study since 1924, the Indus Civilisation\nphysically straddled the border between India and Pakistan, two countries\n11 N.

It has provided a critical stance to the\npractices of archaeology, and concerns with many different issues. For two different\napproaches to considerations of ethics see L. Meskell, \u2018Human Rights and Heritage\nEthics\u2019, Anthropological Quarterly, 83(4), 2010, pp. 839-60, and L. Smith and E. Waterton,\nHeritage, Communities and Archaeology (London: Duckworth, 2009). 110 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nwhose shared cultural histories were officially divided by the partition\nof 1947. As a result of the partition, the post-colonial scholarship of the\nIndus Civilisation in Pakistan has been facilitated to a large extent by \u2018non-\nnative\u2019 archaeologists. Therefore, embedded within the historiography of\nthis Bronze Age phenomenon of the third millennium BC, are competitions\nand contestations regarding the authorship of knowledge and \u2018important\u2019\ndiscoveries, unequal intellectual encounters, disparate claims to \u2018cultural\nlegacies\u2019, and conflicts and tensions regarding the granting of permission\nto \u2018foreigners\u2019 to dig the \u2018native soil\u2019 of others. The ninety-year-long\narchaeological scholarship of the Indus Civilisation therefore provides\nus with a seminal archive of creations, representations and contestations\naround the ownership of evidence of heritage.\nThe history of Indus scholarship also highlights the waning influence\nof British scholarship upon Indian archaeology after the Raj, and the\nconcomitant spread of North American theories and methods within South\nAsian archaeology. This epistemological shift has left a rich collection\nof official correspondence, which offers an insight into the spectacular\nconflicts between the British old guard, some of whom, such as Mortimer\nWheeler (1890-1976), continued to serve as diplomats of Indian archaeology,\nand the young American entrants into the field, such as Walter Fairservis\nJr. (1921-94).14 The numerous examples of professional clashes between\nthe British and American camps demonstrate the fallacy of reducing the\npower politics of post-colonial archaeological scholarship in South Asia to\na simple dichotomy of foreign versus native.\nThe history of the Indus Civilisation encompasses a remarkable\ngeographical shift around the year 2200 BC, when cities within the Indus\nvalley, including the type-sites of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, declined\nand new cities, such as Rakhigarhi, Kalibangan and Dholavira, emerged\nin regions to the east and south-east. This geographical change creates\nthe need to consider the manner in which past perceptions of territoriality\nhave been sourced through the archaeological scholarship, and provokes\nan enquiry into the way in which archaeologists have established material\nevidence of the indigenous. The understanding of the Indus Civilisation as\n\u2018sub-continental\u2019 in its \u2018roots\u2019 and \u2018style\u2019 is a specifically North American\ncontribution to the historiography, and was formally suggested in 1967\n14 Details in \u2018Wheeler Papers\u2019, Box 459, archives of the British Academy, London. South Asian Heritage and Archaeological Practices 111\nby Fairservis, who endowed the Civilisation with \u2018Indian\u2019 features by\nhistoricising its \u2018ethos\u2019 as village-orientated.15 Fairservis subsequently\nstated that \u2018the story of prehistoric India, which stretches back to a time so\nremote that it conforms to a Hindu Kalpa of untold generations reaching\nto a primordial world, nonetheless repeats again and again the pattern\nwhich was not to change until the East India Company ships moved up\nthe Hooghly\u2019.16 Fariservis\u2019s view of a uniquely Indian civilisation whose\ncharacteristic features \u2013 a Hindu society with a village- and caste-based\nculture \u2013 had remained essentially unchanged since time immemorial,\nfollowed the trends of contemporary orientalist historiography. However,\nthis view also prevails today within the functionalist and systemic\nmodelling of an overarching construct of \u2018Cultural Tradition\u2019, whereby the\nIndus Civilisation is now regarded as demonstrating the continuity of an\nexclusively indigenous cultural history of South Asia.\nIV\nThe archaeological construct of \u2018Cultural Tradition\u2019 was initially\ndeveloped in the context of studies of the settlement patterns of prehistoric\nMesoamerica in order to record cultural change and continuity and\nmeasure the processes of cultural integration.17 It was widely adopted by\nthe processualist school of New Archaeology during the 1960s, and was\nintroduced into South Asian archaeology a decade later by Jim Shaffer\nthrough his research on prehistoric Baluchistan. Since the early 1990s,\nShaffer and his co-author Dianne Lichtenstein have gradually extended\nthe scope of the model. They now propose an overarching \u2018Indo-Gangetic\nCultural Tradition\u2019, encompassing the long-term cultural developments\nin northern South Asia which link \u2018social entities over a time period from\nthe development of food production in the seventh millennium BC to the\npresent\u2019.18 In an earlier model of this theory, which was published in 1995,\nthe authors conceived the continuity as being economically and culturally\n15 W.A.

Patton (eds.), The Indo-Aryan Controversy:\nEvidence and Inference in Indian History (London and New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 93. 112 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nfocused upon cattle. Now, with due regard for the danger of slipping\ninto orientalist historiography, they insist that by charting an unbroken\nindigenous cultural continuity for northern South Asia they nonetheless\nrecognise \u2018significant indigenous discontinuity\u2019, and do not \u2018propose social\nisolation nor deny any outside cultural influence\u2019.19 However, despite\nall these qualifications and careful nuances, Shaffer and Lichtenstein\u2019s\n\u2018Indo Gangetic Cultural Tradition\u2019 still evokes orientalist and colonialist\nhistoriography in the basic assumption that this tradition can be recognised\nbecause its core features have remained unchanged over millennia.\nFollowing Shaffer\u2019s work, an archaeological narrative of northern South\nAsia has been established on the basis of constructions of cultural traditions\nthat historicise the indigenous and the foreign as being respectively internal\nand external to this vast region. Yet such distinctions lead to misleading\nhistories of \u2018others\u2019 and \u2018otherness\u2019, reminding us of the observation of\nthe noted historian B.D. Chattopadhyaya that even the region\u2019s Muslim\ncommunities were not regarded as \u2018others\u2019 by the Hindus until the twelfth\ncentury because \u2018the notion of territorial outsider in a political sense [was] not\ncompatible with the early cosmological/geographical concept\u2019.20 We should\nnot forget that the Indus Civilisation was historicised as indigenous by all\nearly excavators, notably John Marshall, who described the authors as being\n\u2018born of the soil\u2019, and Mortimer Wheeler, who stated that \u2018the population\nwould appear to have remained more or less stable from Harappan times to\nthe present day. Invasions of these regions, however important culturally,\nmust have been on too small a scale to bring about marked changes in\nphysical characteristics\u2019.21 Although Marshall and Wheeler established the\nindigenous nature of the Civilisation with reference to its inhabitants, they\nexplained many of its socio-cultural features as elements of \u2018borrowing\u2019\nfrom the bronze-age cultures of west Asia. They studied the Civilisation\nat a time when the \u2018Aryan invasion\u2019 of northern India in the second\nmillennium BC was considered an undisputable historical fact, and were\nhesitant to historicise a sophisticated city-type civilisation, which predated\nthe \u2018Vedic Civilisation\u2019 of the \u2018Aryans\u2019 by more than a thousand years, as\nan indigenous product of South Asia.

South Asian Heritage and Archaeological Practices 113\nthe Indus Civilisation as indigenous in the twenty-first century arises from\nthe convincing evidence against any \u2018invasion\u2019 of the Indo-Aryan speaking\npeople, which has effectively removed all \u2018foreign hands\u2019 from the cultural\nmake-up of South Asia\u2019s ancient past. However, the on-going academic\ndebate regarding the exact physical location of the first perceptible \u2018roots\u2019 of\nthe Indus Civilisation points to the need for greater sensitivity towards the\nmanner in which the archaeological search for evidence of an indigenous\ncivilisation contributes to issues of cultural ownership.\nThus, although the Indus Civilisation is now celebrated as a pure-bred\nproduct of South Asian soil, the question of its precise origins remains a\ncontentious topic. In particular, Indian nationalist archaeologists reject\nthe \u2018Baluchi story\u2019 of their North American colleagues who excavate the\n\u2018Harappan\u2019 sites of Pakistan, according to which the roots of the Civilisation\u2019s\nincipient technologies can largely be traced through the evidence of\ndomestication at Mehrgarh in the Kacchi Plain. Instead, they put forward an\nalternative origin story focused upon evidence gathered within India, which\nhighlights the origins of rice and millet domestication in the \u2018Indus-Hakra-\nGhaggar alluvium\u2019 and the innovations in metal technologies in the \u2018Aravalli\nhills during the fourth to mid-third millennium BC\u2019.22 These assertions\nhave provoked the surprising counter-claim that possible evidence for\nthe indigenous growth of Taxila, Charsada and Peshawar (Pakistan)\ninto important commercial cities by c.600 BC calls into question the \u2018time\nhonoured models\u2019 describing the derivation of \u2018Indian culture\u2019 from \u2018a\nGangetic homeland\u2019.23 A surprising claim because although the region of\nMagadha in the Gangetic valley was the heartland of the classical kingdoms\nof ancient India, it has never been regarded as the \u2018homeland\u2019 of \u2018Indian\nculture\u2019. In all models since the nineteenth century the \u2018homeland\u2019 has\nremained the Sapta Sindhu, believed to be in and around the area of Punjab\nwhich is in Pakistan today, where the early Vedic hymns were supposedly\ncomposed. The nationalist and counter-nationalist claims may seem childish,\nbut they clearly demonstrate the performative uses to which evidence of the\nindigenous is put within the scholarship of South Asian archaeology.\n22 D.K.

However, since archaeologists now also strive to ensure that\ntheir scholarship is anthropologically informed, we cannot overlook the\nfact that their representations of the Civilisation\u2019s social structures and\nethnicities, which are mainly inferred from specialist craft production\ntechnologies and stylistic similarities in artefact types and their decorations,\ngo against the caution of social anthropologists that people \u2018can\u2019t be put\ninto a box anymore\u2019. Moreover, India and Africa are now identified by\nanthropologists as \u2018obvious examples\u2019 of places that include societies of\nlong-standing superdiversity.24 The historical fact of this superdiversity \u2013\nunderstood as the \u2018diversification of diversity\u2019 \u2013 in South Asia leads us to\nquestion the way in which archaeological inferences about social identities\nare forged from artefacts, and to dismiss the assertion, often made by\narchaeologists, that past markers of identity can simply be uncovered and\nunderstood through archaeological fieldwork.\nIn order to identify continuities between the Indus Civilisation and the\nsubsequent cultural histories of early India, archaeologists of the twenty-\nfirst century have also shown a renewed interest in sourcing Sanskrit and\nPali texts, many of which are vastly disparate in terms of both chronology\nand intent, from which to glean the \u2018idea of an ancient Indian/South Asian\nCivilisation\u2019. On the basis of comparisons and juxtapositions of patently\nmismatched textual and archaeological \u2018sources\u2019, we are told that \u2018the\nvery fact that authorities both in the Harappan and Ganges civilisation\nexpressed their ethos in similar material symbols \u2013 various forms of\nfortification, circumvallation \u2013 indicates that the forms of authorities\nin these two civilisations may have been similar as well\u2019, and that the\n\u2018deep structure\u2019 of the South Asian Civilisation, which developed from\nthe Neolithic period onwards, can be defined by \u2018five traits; namely,\nagricultural economy, an orally transmitted code of conduct, an orally\ntransmitted sacred knowledge, an idiosyncratic sociocultural system, and\na set of ritual and sacrificial practices\u2019.25 This new archaeological literature\n24 J.N.

After\nall, few academic archaeologists would care to propose the archaeological\nhistory of a unique, age-old civilisational ethos for western Europe, North\nAmerica, Britain, France, the United States, or any other regional or national\ndomain of the \u2018western\u2019 world.\nProcessualist archaeology was developed by the New Archaeologists\nof the 1960s, but had fallen out of favour by the late 1980s, when\narchaeologists came to recognise that the inherent positivism of the\nprocessualist approach encouraged an abject disregard for human agency,\nand hence also for the basic responsibilities of archaeological scholarship.\nAlthough the processualist school of thought has long been out of fashion\nin theoretical archaeology, its tropes have continued to guide studies of the\nIndus Civilisation, especially in North American scholarship on the subject\nsince the late 1980s. This outmoded approach, which is most obviously\napparent in the schemes of periodisation that are developed on the basis of\nthe functionalist constructs of traditions, eras and phases, takes no notice\nof the theoretical slippage that occurs in establishing evidence of social\nidentities through evidence of a society\u2019s production technologies. Thus,\ninferences regarding the existence of specialist craftsmen within the Indus\nCivilisation are routinely drawn upon to show the presence of kin and\ncaste groups, and evidence of the spatial demarcation of the different crafts\nand manufacturing processes within the cities is presented as evidence of\nsocial segregation, and of the possible existence of a caste system.26 Given\nthat western archaeologists often criticise their non-western counterparts\nfor failing to adopt new theoretical approaches, the continued dominance\nof the processualist school of thought in the archaeology of the Indus\nCivilisation is somewhat surprising, and demonstrates the theoretical\npoverty of even \u2018western\u2019 studies of South Asian archaeology. In this respect,\nthe archaeological construct of a \u2018Great South Asian Tradition\u2019 through the\nmodern scholarship of the Indus Civilisation forces us to interrogate the\nintellectual and moral obligations of today\u2019s \u2018post-colonial\u2019 archaeology.\n26 For an early example see K.K. Bhan, M. Vidale and J.M. Kenoyer, \u2018Harappan Technology:\nTheoretical and Methodological Issues\u2019, Man and Environment, 19, 1994, pp. 141-57.  7. The Ethics of Digging\nGeoffrey Scarre\n[W]hile the Workmen made several Ditches, they fell upon divers Urnes, but earnestly, and\ncarelessly digging, they broke all they met with, and finding nothing but Ashes, or burnt\nCinders, they scattered what they found.1\nSir Thomas Browne\nSir Thomas Browne\u2019s account of the chance discovery and thoughtless\ndestruction of Roman sepulchral urns near Brampton in Norfolk is the\nstuff of archaeologists\u2019 nightmares. Fortunately, this particular story had\na happy ending: following the antiquarian knight\u2019s arrival on the scene\nseveral more urns were unearthed, which Browne carefully described in\nwhat amounts to an early example of an archaeological report. We can only\nspeculate how much of the English archaeological record disappeared in\nsimilar incidents over the centuries but vast quantities of ancient material\nmust have been destroyed by the ignorant or the uninterested. The rise of\nantiquarianism in the eighteenth century and its gradual transmutation into\na professional and scientific archaeology were of inestimable importance\nin stemming this loss of objects and the information to be obtained from\nthem. And scholarly excavators not only preserved the archaeological\nriches but became increasingly adept at reading the messages they\nconveyed. By the mid-twentieth century, university-trained archaeologists\nhad understandably come to see themselves as the primary stewards of the\narchaeological heritage. For they, more than others, had the knowledge and\n1 S ir Thomas Browne, \u2018Concerning some Urnes Found in Brampton-Field, in Norfolk, Anno:\n1667\u2019, in Religio Medici and Other Writings (London: Everyman\u2019s Library, 1969), p. 142.\n\u00a9 Geoffrey Scarre, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.07 118 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nskills to extract maximum information from an often partial and imperfect\nrecord. Archaeology, which had formerly been a pastime for amateurs, had\nevolved into a business of experts.\nYet professionalism in archaeology, as in some other scholarly fields\nonce dominated by laymen, is not an unmixed blessing. If the past and\nthe things of the past are our common heritage (as the familiar mantra\nruns), then the privileging of the expert over the amateur in the practice\nof archaeology raises certain questions about equity. Where professionals\nrush in, amateurs may fear \u2013 or more often be forbidden \u2013 to tread. At worst,\nprofessional archaeologists may look on untrained amateurs as interfering\nnuisances, to be kept at a distance; at best, amateurs on excavation sites\nare treated as unpaid assistants to the experts, useful pairs of hands to\ncarry out the dirty work. If all of us are equally heirs to the past, then it\nseems that some heirs are more equal than others. But if the relegation of\namateurs to subsidiary roles is to some extent an inevitable effect of the\never-increasing dependence of archaeological research on sophisticated\ntechnology and analytical techniques (even in the world of supposedly\npost-processual archaeology, with its greater tolerance of alternative\nnarratives), there are other exclusionary effects of professionalisation that\nmay be more avoidable. Archaeologists who claim to be stewards of the\narchaeological heritage on behalf of everyone doubtless speak sincerely.\nBut not everyone accepts that archaeologists are the best people to manage\nthat heritage or to construe its meaning. Thus, many indigenous people\nin North America, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere protest at the\ndisturbance by archaeologists of the sites at which their ancestors lived\nand died, which they see as disrespectful and intrusive; or they are highly\nsceptical about the truth, or the relevance to themselves, of the accounts of\nthe past that archaeologists deliver.\nIn the latest edition of their textbook Archaeology: Theory, Methods and\nPractice, Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn assert that \u2018the fundamental purpose\nof archaeology must be to provide people with a better understanding of the\nhuman past\u2019.2 This statement appears in a chapter on archaeological ethics\nbearing the significant title \u2018Whose Past?\u2019 At one level, this is a question\nabout who has the right to decide what is removed from the ground, how\nit should be handled, whether it should be retained or reburied, and who\nshould ultimately have control of it. At another level, it raises subtler issues\n2 C. Renfrew and P. Bahn, Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice, 6th edition (London:\nThames and Hudson, 2012), p. 540. The Ethics of Digging 119\nabout identity, allegiances and social continuity: about who is entitled\nto speak about the past of a community whose sense of itself is founded\nin certain beliefs (which may be true or false) about its own origins. Few\nof us enjoy having our identity defined for us by others, and we may be\nstill more resentful when outsiders tell us that our own favoured stories\nabout our roots are wrong. Nevertheless, archaeologists cannot and should\nnot be expected to compromise their professional standards of evidence\nwhen conducting excavations or interpreting their finds. Archaeology is\na scholarly discipline, not a spinner of myth, a servant of ideologies, or a\nrubber stamp for popular opinions. Archaeologists need to be rigorously\nscientific in their methods while avoiding the academic bullishness that so\nnaturally offends others. This is not an easy ethical nut to crack.\nIn the survey that follows I look briefly at some of the moral\nresponsibilities that professional archaeologists, and particularly those\nengaged in the excavation and interpretation of sites, must bear on\ntheir shoulders. Knowing how to behave as a virtuous archaeologist is\ndifficult when the responsibilities in question pull in divergent directions,\nas they often do. For convenience\u2019s sake, I shall divide the discussion\nsomewhat arbitrarily into three sections: 1) Responsibilities to People; 2)\nResponsibilities to Things; 3) Responsibilities to the Profession. (These\nlabels do not, of course, identify entirely disparate categories of issues.)\n1. Responsibilities to People\nIn recent years there has been increasing recognition of the variety of\n\u2018stakeholders\u2019 in the archaeological enterprise \u2013 that is, the different\nsets of people whose interests are actually or potentially affected by the\nactivities of archaeologists. A short-list of those who have been considered\nstakeholders includes (in no order of precedence, and allowing for overlap):\na) archaeologists; b) the general public; c) local (including indigenous)\ncommunities; d) genetic and/or cultural descendants of the subjects under\ninvestigation; e) tribal associations; f) religious affiliates, or claimants to\nthat status; g) national or local governments; h) owners of land or property\non which excavation is carried out; i) planners and developers; j) the\ndead (if, as some philosophers believe, some kind of \u2018moral estate\u2019 can be\nascribed to people after their death). In addition to present people who are\naffected by the activities of archaeologists, there are also potential effects\non future ones to be considered. So (to state the obvious) a site which is 120 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nexcavated today will not be available as a virgin site for later generations of\narchaeologists and their public.\nSatisfying the particular, and sometimes sharply conflicting, interests\nof such a variety of groups can produce hard dilemmas for archaeologists.\nLarry Zimmerman emphasises that while archaeologists claim to act as\nstewards on behalf of the public, that public is far from homogeneous\nand may contain members who \u2018have a substantially different view of\nstewardship of the past than archaeologists\u2019.3 Given the diversity of\ninterests and viewpoints, even archaeologists who acknowledge their\naccountability to the public might sometimes be stumped to answer the\nquestion \u2018What public?\u2019 In the notorious controversy over the disposal of\nKennewick Man in the north-west USA, members of the Umatilla tribe\nargued that the only respectful mode of caring for the extremely ancient\nremains in question was to rebury them, a mode of \u2018stewardship\u2019 which\narchaeologists who wished to preserve them for further research rejected\nwith horror. There may also be people whose paramount interest is not\nin stewardship of any kind, sometimes for perfectly legitimate reasons. A\ntown council or construction company which wants to build a school or\nsocial housing on an archaeologically sensitive site may reasonably argue\nthat the land cannot be frozen forever in the past, and that present needs\nmust sometimes trump the case for preservation. (Fortunately, in many\nsuch cases some compromise is possible, whereby a portion of the site is\npreserved or a \u2018rescue dig\u2019 by archaeologists is commissioned before the\ndevelopers move in.)\nThe interests that need to be considered when archaeological excavation\nis in prospect vary considerably from place to place. Generally speaking,\nthe investigation of the site of a deserted medieval village in the British\ncountryside is less ethically sensitive than a project to excavate the dwelling\nsite of an indigenous community in North America or Australia. Digging a\nsettlement in rural Yorkshire or Oxfordshire to learn more about the former\ninhabitants is likely to be welcomed by the local residents as a way of making\nconnections with their forbears, bringing the past to life and fostering a\nsense of trans-temporal community. (However, not all contemporary\nBritons feel ethically relaxed about the practice of archaeology. In the last\nfew years the Society for Honouring the Ancient Dead (HAD) has argued\nfor the adoption in Britain of a default procedure of reburial of human\n3 L .J. Zimmerman, \u2018When Data Become People: Archaeological Ethics, Reburial, and the\nPast as Public Heritage\u2019, International Journal of Cultural Property, 7, 1998, p. 70. The Ethics of Digging 121\nremains discovered in the course of research \u2013 a proposal that has been\nmet with resistance by much of the archaeological community.) By contrast,\nthe excavation of a former tribal occupation site on the American Great\nPlains by archaeologists trained in western techniques of scientific analysis\ngrounded on Enlightenment epistemology, may be seen by a present-day\nIndigenous community as an act of intellectual and moral arrogance that\ntreats people \u2013 their people \u2013 as mere data for research.\nIn the USA, the passing of the Native Graves Protection and Repatriation\nAct in 1990, which mandates that tribes be consulted before human physical\nremains or associated funerary objects are removed from tribal or federal\nland, and establishes the right to demand the return of those that have\npreviously been removed, has set the framework for generally improved\nrelations between archaeologists and indigenous groups. But even before the\nenactment of NAGPRA, changing conceptions of their role by archaeologists,\nincluding a wider and more generous recognition of their responsibilities\nto other stakeholders, were producing a less imperious mode of conducting\nresearch, in which purely academic considerations no longer alone ruled the\nroost. What Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson have called an \u2018ethic of\ncollaboration\u2019, that emphasises a cooperative role for native communities\nin deciding research questions, selecting sites for analysis, managing\nexcavations, and publishing and publicising results, is fast becoming a\nstandard component of cultural resource management in the USA.4\nWhile it would be hard to deny that cooperation and consultation\namong stakeholders is highly desirable on both moral and on practical\ngrounds, it would obviously be too sanguine to suppose that consensus\nwill invariably be the outcome of such practice. It is not always possible\nto reconcile the different interests, still less the underlying ideals that may\nbe at issue; it can also be hard to decide just who the relevant stakeholders\nare, or who is entitled to speak for them. The fifth principle of the World\nArchaeological Congress\u2019s First Code of Ethics calls on archaeologists \u2018[t] o\nacknowledge that the indigenous cultural heritage rightfully belongs to\nthe indigenous descendants of that heritage\u2019.5 Yet the prima facie justice\nof this principle ought not to obscure the fact that an unwillingness to\n4 C . Colwell-Chanthaphonh and T.J. Ferguson, \u2018Virtue Ethics and the Practice of History:\nNative Americans and Archaeologists along the San Pedro Valley of Arizona\u2019, Journal of\nSocial Archaeology, 4, 2004, p. 23.\n5 World Archaeological Congress, First Code of Ethics, 1990, http://www.world\narchaeologicalcongress.org/site/about_ethi.php 122 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nshare one\u2019s cultural heritage is not always defensible on the ground that\nsuch sharing would be a threat to that culture\u2019s integrity. Moreover, if the\nprinciple implies that indigenous owners have the ultimate say over what\nhappens to their cultural heritage, then it may inadvertently warrant even\nsuch acts of wilful destruction as the Afghan Taleban\u2019s dynamiting of the\nBamiyan Buddhas in 2001 or the current spate of destruction of cultural\nheritage by Islamic fundamentalists in Mali. Such cases evince a total, but\nsurely disputable, rejection of the idea that there may be other people with\na legitimate interest in the heritage in question. (It is also worth noting in\nthis connection that conventional legal notions of property, which mostly\naccord owners the right to do what they like with whatever belongs to\nthem, are inadequate tools for thinking about the ethical responsibilities of\nthe finders, managers or controllers of sites or objects of cultural interest)6\nIn the contemporary global village, people increasingly care about sites of\ncultural interest wherever in the world they are. As Atle Omland writes,\n\u2018The [UNESCO] World Heritage concept rests fundamentally on the idea\nthat cultural heritage can be held in common\u2019.7 But while this view has\nevident attractions, determining the relative weight of different stakeholder\ninterests and finding modes of conflict-resolution that are acceptable to all\nparties are not always simple.\n2. Responsibilities to Things\nWhen archaeologists speak about the \u2018archaeological record\u2019, they are\nsometimes referring to the material sites and objects located within them,\nand sometimes to the knowledge obtainable from that material by the\napplication of appropriate investigative techniques. This ambiguity is\nnot entirely harmless. For archaeologists may persuade themselves that\nthey are \u2018preserving the archaeological record\u2019 when they write up their\nexcavation reports, where their investigations have actually damaged or\ndegraded the material record. Brian Fagan sounds a salutary warning note:\n[I]n an era when the archaeological record [in the material sense] is under\nthreat everywhere, the first concern of any research project should be\n6 T .

Scarre\n(eds.), The Ethics of Archaeology: Philosophical Perspectives on the Practice of Archaeology\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 243. The Ethics of Digging 123\nthe maintenance of the site and the stakes of all those concerned with its\nconservation \u2013 be they archaeologists, local land-owners, tourist officials, or\nindigenous peoples.8\nFagan\u2019s proposal may seem the merest common sense. Yet the only way\nof wholly conserving a site is to leave it completely alone. Even light-\ntouch investigation which creates minimal disturbance causes permanent\nchanges to a site. Attempts to restore it to its previous condition at the\nclose of a dig often consist in little more than a cosmetic replacement of\nits previous covering of earth. Although the visual status quo ante may\nbe restored in this way, signs of previous activity will still be apparent\nto later investigators who reopen the excavation. Objects of significance\nfound at the site will have been removed, reducing the informational\nbasis available to subsequent researchers. In some cases, exposure by\narchaeologists to the light and air of what has been long buried actually\nserves a sentence of destruction. (One of the most tragic examples is the\nfading away of hundreds of painted frescoes and inscriptions at Pompeii\nsince they were first uncovered by diggers in the nineteenth century.)\nClearly, archaeologists must be willing to put up with some loss of the\nmaterial record in the creation of the knowledge-record; yet there can seem\nsomething oddly conflicted about a science that is willing to destroy the\nvery thing it loves.\nStill, without digging there would be no data, and most archaeologists\nconsider that some amount of dislocation and destruction is an acceptable,\nif regrettable, price to pay for making the material record speak. But\njustifying the pretension to stewardship requires that a maxim of\n\u2018excavational economy\u2019 is adopted whereby a site is disturbed no more\nthan is necessary to realise the basic research objectives. Collecting items\nthat are surplus to requirements, and that will be left to gather dust in\nthe storerooms of museums or archaeology departments, is academically\npointless and morally irresponsible. Investigators need also to ensure that\nmaximum benefit accrues to stakeholders from the work that has been\ncarried out, by publishing and disseminating their analyses, facilitating\npublic access to the site where practicable, and exhibiting the finds. (An\nexception to this publicity condition may be made where revealing\nthe details of an archaeological site is liable to attract the attention of\nprofessional or amateur looters.) Last but not least, archaeologists must\n8 B. Fagan, \u2018Foreword\u2019, in V. Cassman, N. Odegard and J. Powell (eds.), Human Remains:\nGuide for Museums and Academic Institutions (Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007), p. xvii. 124 Cultural Heritage Ethics\ninterest themselves in the proper curation of objects that are removed in\nthe course of excavations. Michael Trimble and Eugene Marino complain\nthat many archaeologists continue to be negligent concerning the future\nof the objects collected once their own research questions have been\nanswered. In their view, \u2018These collections should be valued, curated, and\nstudied, not just by archaeologists, but by everyone with a professional\ninterest and the results of those studies should be made widely available\u2019.9\nIf a particular institution lacks the facilities to look after objects properly,\neither it should not have acquired them in the first place or it should\nnow transfer them to another location where they can be better studied,\nenjoyed and protected.\nTo speak about archaeologists\u2019 responsibilities to things is a way of\nacknowledging the value they have as objects created by and associated\nwith our ancestors. This, of course, is quite different from their financial\nvalue in the commercial market; the earthenware funerary urns that so\nexcited Sir Thomas Browne would have been of no interest to treasure-\nhunters on the trail of gold and silver. Nor is it identical with beauty or\nartistic value, as many objects without these (including human remains)\ncan provide important information to the specialist. But the value that old\nobjects possess for us is not entirely a function of what they can tell us\nabout past lives. Much of the thrill of gazing on an ancient coin or pottery\nvessel or textile fragment derives from the very fact of its association with\npeople who were once as real and vital as we are. In A Treatise of Human\nNature, David Hume speculates that the \u2018esteem and admiration\u2019 we feel\nfor very old objects stems from the sense of awe aroused in us when we\ncontemplate vast passages of time.10 But while Hume may be right that\nobjects can fascinate by virtue of age alone, we are less likely to be deeply\nmoved by ancient things that lack the human connection. The oldest\nstone tools or earthenware pots are vastly younger, for instance, than the\nfossilised tree-ferns that we blithely burn on our fires in the form of coal,\nyet only the former evoke our \u2018esteem and admiration\u2019. Human remains,\nwhich have an even more intimate relationship with our forebears than\nthe things they made or used, are naturally the most intriguing and\nevocative objects of all.\n9 M.K.

Selby-Bigge (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 1888), pp. 432, 433. The Ethics of Digging 125\n3. Responsibilities to the Profession\nArchaeology is unusual among the sciences in that it can easily become\na victim of its own success. Too much archaeology, or too many\narchaeologists, and the future of the subject is endangered by the\nsheer depletion of its source material. There are only so many ancient\ncities, sites and landscapes awaiting the archaeologist\u2019s spade, and the\nunderstandable desire of researchers to engage with the more before the\nless interesting means that the richest plums will tend to be selected first.\nWhen the richer sites are exhausted, archaeologists turn their attention to\nthose of more marginal interest until they, too, are worked to the point\nof exhaustion. According to Fagan, \u2018Today there are hundreds, if not\nthousands, of researchers who are mining sites, often without reference\nto all the potential stakeholders involved, to answer purely academic \u2013\nand often very insignificant \u2013 questions\u2019.11 It might be countered that such\nsites provide useful training-grounds for young archaeologists in places\nwhere they can do relatively little harm; also, that even minor academic\nquestions may be worth answering in order to add small pieces to the\nlarger jigsaw of the past. (But the questions really must be answered, and\nthe answers published in appropriate places and within a reasonably short\nperiod of time, otherwise the disturbance of a site is indistinguishable\nfrom vandalism.) However, John Locke\u2019s principle that a resource may\nbe appropriated only on condition that there is \u2018enough, and as good left\nin common for others\u2019 is difficult to apply in archaeology.12 It looks as\nthough future archaeologists will be forced to make do with the leavings\nfrom the current archaeologists\u2019 table.\nSome archaeologists judge this picture to be needlessly alarmist. So long\nas human societies exist there will always be something new to excavate,\nas fresh generations go the way of their ancestors, leaving behind their\nown material traces. Larry Zimmerman pertinently asks: \u2018Archaeologists\npromote the idea that archaeological sites are non-renewable resources,\nbut aren\u2019t humans creating new archaeological sites all the time?\u201913 If\narchaeology aims \u2018to develop general principles about human behaviour\u2019,\nthen sites of recent creation should be equally productive of information\n11 Fagan, 2007, p. xvi.\n12 J. Locke, Two Treatises of Government, ed. P. Laslett (New York: New American Library,\n1963), p. 329.\n13 Zimmerman, 1998, p. 78. 126 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nas older ones.14 As one obvious example, in Britain and other early\nindustrialising centres there is now a lively \u2018industrial archaeology\u2019\nwhose raw material is frequently less than a century or two old. In a\nfew generations\u2019 time, archaeologists may be enthusiastically excavating\nthe remains of our own civic centres and shopping malls. According to\nZimmerman, there could in principle be a fruitful \u2018archaeology of five\nminutes ago\u2019.15 But while this is so, archaeologists who are fascinated by\nmore ancient things \u2013 those who wish to study the origins of man, or the\nmigrations of long-gone peoples, or the development of early technologies,\nor the rise of early civilisations \u2013 will eventually face a much more\nstraitened choice of unexcavated locations. Do present archaeologists\ntreat their successors unjustly by removing the opportunities for research\nthat they themselves enjoy?\nDepriving future archaeologists of similar opportunities to those\nenjoyed by present ones to excavate sites of prime importance may\nnot seem a particularly grave evil in the greater scale of things. And if\nprofessional courtesy (to rank the moral obligation no higher) of current\narchaeologists to future ones dictates that they should reserve for them\nsome potentially significant sites, there are other stakeholders in the\narchaeological enterprise whose interests may be less well served by\nsuch a self-denying ordinance. A rural community wanting to learn more\nabout the history of their village, a people who wish to know who their\nancestors were and where they came from, or members of the public who\nvalue the feeling of closeness to the past that archaeological discoveries\ncan provide, may think it a poor reason for waiting to have their curiosity\nsatisfied that future archaeologists will need to have something to do.\nResolving this particular tension is challenging, but once again much\nmay be achieved by mutually respectful and tolerant consultation among\nthe various stakeholders concerned, and by a willingness to give and\ntake. By encouraging the idea of an \u2018archaeology for all\u2019, professional\narchaeologists not only show themselves sensitive to the interests of those\noutside the profession, but benefit their own and later generations of\narchaeologists as well. By getting the public on their side, archaeologists\nare better placed to secure for their discipline the popular, political and\n14 Ibid.\n15 L.J.

In\nthe long run, the self-interest of the profession and the interests of other\nstakeholders may be less divergent than they may first have appeared.\nAnd if that is true, it is good news for everyone.  III\nOWNERSHIP\nAND RESTITUTION  8. \u2018National\u2019 Heritage\nand Scholarship\nJohn Boardman\nThe debate over the handling and publication of ancient artefacts acquired\nthrough channels other than official excavation has raged for over fifty\nyears. The 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and\nPreventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural\nProperty1 has effectively increased the value of objects known before 1970\nbut done nothing to halt the acquisition and marketing of objects \u2018recovered\u2019\nsince that date, although there are a few inhibitions about the way they\nare marketed. Robbing graves probably ranks alongside other \u2018oldest\nprofessions\u2019 of the world, although nowadays it is often accidental, and\nsince \u2018recycling\u2019 is generally perceived as being a civilised activity, it could\nreadily be defended. More general recognition of national responsibility\nfor the preservation of the evidence of ancient cultures in or on its soil is\nnow in place and selectively acted upon, except where issues of greater\npolitical or economic force prevail. We can probably not expect more. But\nit is still not uncommon to hear the term \u2018national heritage\u2019 being used,\nand this can easily lead to a more casual approach to some aspects of the\nproblem. Better by far to speak of \u2018global heritage\u2019, the \u2018heritage of man\u2019\nor even just \u2018heritage\u2019, and whether it has to be \u2018cultural\u2019 or not may be a\nmoot point.\nThe use of the word \u2018national\u2019 carries with it implications of moral or legal\nclaims by any country on artefacts found on or in its soil. The implication is\n1 See http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_\nSECTION=201.html\n\u00a9 John Boardman, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.08 132 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nthat the modern nation has a responsibility, which is not contested, but that\nis based on some positive link between the modern and ancient cultures\nthat the land sustained. Where this is clearly lacking, problems arise. It is\neasy to see where \u2018national\u2019 interests have been counter-productive, even in\nrecent years \u2013 the destruction of Buddhist monuments by an Islamic state,\nthe destruction of Islamic monuments by a Christian state, the destruction\nof anything that gets in the way of any sort of \u2018development\u2019 that is deemed\nmore important.\nSometimes the argument for possession is more subtle or complicated.\nA fine Athenian vase made in about 500 BC was immediately exported\nto Italy where it was soon put into an Etruscan (non-Greek) grave and in\nmodern times recovered \u2018unofficially\u2019 and taken to display in an American\nmuseum. It is a Greek product, its use was as an Etruscan grave offering,\nand its major period of display for admiration and study has been in a\nNew World museum. It has been returned to Italy because it was found\nthere, not because it was made there or because it might be a better\ndemonstration of the quality of Greek art there. Objects of scholarly rather\nthan aesthetic (i.e. for a modern public) importance are more easily judged\nand accommodated where they are best understood and appreciated,\nwhich is not always where they were found.\nThe restitution of \u2018works of art\u2019 to their country of origin might be held\nto depend on whether it is thought that they are in fact best appreciated\nthere. We could hardly wish for the dispersal of collections of diverse post-\nantique world art, and should treasure all the more those galleries of ancient\nart composed from widely different sources \u2013 the British Museum, the\nLouvre, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, countless smaller galleries\nworldwide \u2013 which give the public the opportunity to judge and compare.\nIn all this, \u2018nationalism\u2019 need and should play no part. Genetic and/\nor cultural continuity in populations is often too easily assumed and the\nmarkers for it (language, script) sometimes overvalued. Sometimes the\ndifferences are obvious \u2013 as in the Americas with their native and immigrant\npopulations. Britain\u2019s genetic past is so variegated that it poses no serious\nproblems of this type. For Greece the alphabet provides the strongest link\nwith the past since even the ancient physical type \u2013 tall, fair-haired, blue\neyed \u2013 is at some variance with the modern Balkan (Christian) aspect,\nmuch adjusted by contacts east and west. The fact that, whatever is alleged,\nthere are very few countries whose modern populations have any serious\ngenetic or cultural links with their distant past, should not be ignored \u2013 a \u2018National\u2019 Heritage and Scholarship 133\nproblem which is (understandably but nonetheless mistakenly) not much\nfavoured in modern political and historical scholarship.\nThe classical world is one in which the problem of restitution of\nmonuments to their former physical position (not just environment) is at\nstake. Yet no one would put the Elgin marbles back on the rebuilt Parthenon\nwhere they would be barely visible, over forty-feet up. The marbles, which\nhave been on display in the British Museum in London for nearly two\ncenturies, have already proved their worth in the shaping of classicising\narts as well as in general education for visitors from all over the world,\nthrough their juxtaposition with prime works from Egypt and the Near\nEast. There must surely sometimes be a case to be made for not letting the\npast get in the way of the future.\nWhile many \u2018source\u2019 countries take their responsibilities seriously,\nthere are many shortcomings. To understand the past we need access to all\nthe evidence, in corpore or in publication, yet, for the classical world, both\nGreece and Italy have very poor records indeed in the matter of publishing\ntheir own excavations, and in providing scholars with access to the evidence\ngathered in the process. Not that they are alone, there are still western\nmuseums which choose to be selective of whom they allow to study their\nmaterial, on nationalistic grounds. This is not simply a matter of laziness\nor indifference. The remark that \u2018they want to steal our material\u2019 can still\nbe heard, as well as manifest examples of scholars \u2018sitting on\u2019 what they\nperceive as \u2018their\u2019 material indefinitely, indifferent to whatever regulations\nthere may be about the period for which they might claim priority. Jealousy\nseems a very strong motive in many cases, often abetted by extreme views\nabout what \u2018copyright\u2019 entails.\nFor learned journals to restrict or ban publication of \u2018doubtful\u2019 objects\nis simply a censorship of scholarship indefensible on any grounds. Our\nattitude to the past, including that of scholars for whom it is a subject of\nintense interest and also often a living, can even verge on the superstitious.\nThe worst example of this is the feeling that unprovenanced objects\nshould not be studied by scholars, should not be published, should not\nbe conserved, should perhaps even be destroyed \u2013 an approach which\nwould not make the slightest difference to the discovery of objects, to a\n\u2018trade\u2019 and interest in collecting and display that is immemorial, and which\nreveals at the same time an indifference to the integrity of evidence and\nscholarly freedom, an attitude which is frankly itself unscholarly. That\nthe American Institute of Archaeology takes some such views impugns its\nscholarly status. The German Institute is wary since the freedom of action 134 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nby its foreign institutes might be jeopardised. Some scholarly journals are\nalso wary, and they also thus betray their scholarly responsibilities.\n\u2018Ownership\u2019 of the past does no doubt need closer definition, not least\nof the responsibilities which it carries with it \u2013 to display, educate and\npublish. Alongside this we need recognition that scholarship devoted to\nthe past should be one human activity that should on no account or for\nwhatever reason be subject to censorship or suppression. 9. Fear of Cultural Objects\nTom Flynn\nThe terrible Buddha priests want their revenge! They seek me and they\nwill also find me! There is no escape from their secret power!1\nThis paper seeks to read some of the current disputes about the collecting\nof cultural heritage through an analysis of Furcht (Fear). This little-known\nsilent film of 1917 by the German director Robert Wiene (1873-1938),\nwho went on to make The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920), is regarded as\none of the most influential examples of German expressionist cinema. In\nFear, a wealthy German Count returns home from India with a statuette\nhe has stolen from a temple and thereafter gradually descends into a\nstate of guilt-ridden paranoia over his acquisition.\nThe fear to which the title refers is ostensibly generated by the\nrepercussions flowing from the Count\u2019s illicit acquisition of the statue\nand the fear of his own imminent death, foretold by a phantom Buddhist\npriest who visits his home. The relationship between the collector and\nthe mysterious representative of the source community from which the\nobject was removed echoes the encounter between powerful European\nnations and the peoples and communities they subordinated during the\ncolonial era. The film also works on a psychological level, expressing\nthe \u2018deep and fearful concern with the foundations of the self\u2019 that\nhas been identified as a core preoccupation of early twentieth-century\n1 Bruno Decarli as Count Greven, Furcht, directed by Robert Wiene, 1917.\n\u00a9 Tom Flynn, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.09 136 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nGerman cinema.2 As Siegfried Kracauer has suggested, the political\ncircumstances of the period immediately after the First World War\nprompted the contemporaneous imagination towards the ancient\nconcept of Fate \u2013 \u2018Doom, decreed by an inexorable Fate was not mere\naccident but a majestic event that stirred metaphysical shudders in\nsufferers and witnesses alike\u2019.3\nReleased in 1917, just prior to the German Revolution and the\nestablishment of the Weimar Republic, Wiene\u2019s narrative, played out\nin the film through the experiences of the wealthy collector, might also\nbe interpreted as prefiguring Germany\u2019s surrendering of its colonies\nthat became a condition of the Treaty of Versailles. Fear, I suggest, can\nthus be read as a symbolic enactment within the cultural sphere of the\ncastration anxiety articulated almost contemporaneously by Freud. It\nmight also stand as an early example of what Anton Kaes has described\nas \u2018shell shock cinema\u2019 \u2013 films that \u2018evoke fear of invasion and injury,\nand exude a sense of paranoia and panic\u2019.4 Wiene\u2019s own Dr Caligari\nremains one of the pivotal examples of this sub-genre, and while Fear\nmay not partake of the \u2018fragmented story lines, distorted perspectives\n\u2026 abrupt editing and sharp lighting\u2019 that Kaes identifies as the defining\ncharacteristics of shell shock cinema between 1918 and 1933, the film\ndoes rehearse another of that category\u2019s core preoccupations. The\nsoldier\u2019s return from the front in a psychologically altered state from\nthat in which he left \u2013 \u2018he has come home, but the war has come with\nhim\u20195\u2013 is a theme mirrored in the plight of Fear\u2019s Count Greven who\nreturns from his travels psychologically disturbed, or as the intertitle\nhas it: \u2018Two years ago a happy cheerful man went abroad \u2013 and what\nsort of man came home?\u2019\nWhile these aspects of film history and film criticism are fruitful\nroutes into an appreciative understanding of Fear, I want instead to\nfocus here on the film\u2019s frame story about the acquisition and collection\nof cultural objects. Wiene\u2019s ambiguous treatment of fear also provides\n2 S.

Fear of Cultural Objects 137\na lens through which to read the ideologically loaded discourses that\ncluster around cultural heritage issues today. It is an unusual theme\nfor a film of that period and in a sense we might see it as the venerable\ninitiator of a cinematic \u2018cultural heritage\u2019 category that embraces\neverything from Chadi Abdel Salam\u2019s thoughtful Al Mummia (The Night\nof Counting the Days) of 1969, and Jules Dassin\u2019s heist caper Topkapi\n(1964), to the popular Indiana Jones and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider franchises.\nVestiges of the anxiety dramatised in Fear can still be detected\ntoday in attitudes expressed towards the \u2018encyclopaedic\u2019 museums\nof Europe and North America by source nations seeking to recover\nobjects appropriated during the era of colonial conquest. Conversely,\nthe combative positions adopted by some museum directors in their\nattempts to ward off repatriation requests appear to express another\nkind of anxiety \u2013 a fear of \u2018the floodgates\u2019 opening6 \u2013 leading to the\nwholesale denuding of museums and the loss of the reassuring material\nplenitude that is a legacy of Enlightenment-era collecting.\nWiene\u2019s film hinges on the overpowering sense of foreboding felt by a\nwealthy aristocrat whose acquisitive impulse has driven him to commit\na cultural crime. Whether the emotions he manifests on arriving home\nwith the statue are intended to signify tremors of colonial guilt, Wiene\nleaves the viewer to decide. Is the fear experienced by his protagonist\na response to some genuine objective danger, or the delusions of a\nderanged mind \u2013 a real fear or a neurotic fear, to use Freud\u2019s typology?7\nWiene\u2019s father is said to have suffered from mental illness towards\nthe end of his life,8 which has been considered a possible source of the\npsychological themes explored in his later Dr Caligari. Released in 1917,\nFear provides an even earlier point of reference for those concerns.\n***\nThe film opens with the return to his ancestral home of the wealthy\nCount Greven (Bruno Decarli) from a \u2018foreign journey of several years\u2019.\n6 T .-L.

Once inside, the Count, visibly distraught,\ninstructs his servants to lock all the doors and bolt all the gates to the\nestate, announcing: \u2018I never want to see a strange face again!\u2019 He makes\nhis way upstairs to his private quarters, passing through rooms full of\nChinese porcelain, Old Master paintings and antique furniture. Some\nmoments later his servants enter, carrying a large rectangular wooden\ntrunk he has brought back from his travels. After dismissing them,\nthe Count furtively unlocks the trunk and removes a metal statue of\na Buddhist deity, which he begins passionately to embrace, before\nreturning it to the box and locking it. When night falls, the Count returns\nto the box, removes the statue and carries it to another room where he\ninstalls it on a pedestal in a specially designed niche behind a glass door\nconcealed by a curtain.\nIn the days that follow, the Count becomes increasingly agitated,\nskulking around his castle at night with a lighted candle, constantly\nlooking over his shoulder, peering nervously out of the windows and\ninto darkened recesses. Aware of his master\u2019s mounting anxiety, the\nCount\u2019s butler seeks help from the village minister, who offers to visit\n(we later learn he is the Count\u2019s former teacher and mentor). The Count\nconfides in the minister, telling him, \u2018You know that I am driven by\nan unhappy passion for collecting rare works of art, which drove me\ninto the world to see the most beautiful art objects\u2019. He then reveals\nhow, \u2018one day, deep in the heart of India, I heard about the holy Buddha\nimage in the Temple at Djaba, whose beauty made the sick well and the\nsad happy \u2026 I had to see it\u2019.\nThe film then cuts to a flashback in which the Count, dressed in\nfull colonial regalia of pith helmet and white three-piece suit, is shown\ncreeping stealthily into a temple interior where he eavesdrops on a ritual\nconducted by a Buddhist high priest (Conrad Veidt) involving a small\nstatue. After the priest and his acolytes have left, the Count approaches\nthe statue and swoons in front of it, before snatching it from its niche\nand departing. The priests return to the temple and are enraged to find\ntheir sacred object missing.\nBack in his castle, the Count tells the minister, \u2018Since that day I have\nhad no peace. The terrible Buddha priests want their revenge! They seek\nme and they will also find me! There is no escape from their secret power!\u2019 Fear of Cultural Objects 139\nFig. 9.1 Count Greven shoots the Buddhist priest.\nThat night, an exterior shot of the castle gardens reveals the Buddhist priest\nstanding statue-like on the lawn, staring up at the Count\u2019s window. Lying\nin bed, but suddenly aware of the proximity of a sinister presence, the\nCount rises and takes a pistol from under his pillow. From his window he\nsees the figure of the priest and in an agitated state proceeds out into the\ngarden to confront him. Without entering into a dialogue with the man, the\nCount fires three shots. The priest remains standing, evidently unharmed,\nat which point the Count collapses before him and pleads to be put out of\nhis misery: \u2018Take my life! Death will be a release for me!\u2019 The priest calmly\nshakes his head and replies:\nThen I would take something of no value to you! Instead you must live and\nlearn to love life. Then today seven years hence you will die at the hand of\none who is dearest to you.\nStricken with fear, the Count returns upstairs to the cabinet in which he has\nplaced the statue and is unsettled to find pinned to the plinth a handwritten\nnote confirming the curse \u2013 \u2018Do not forget \u2026 today seven years hence!\u2019\nSeemingly reconciled to his fate, the Count decides to live life to the full,\nhosting elaborate soir\u00e9es, gambling, drinking and dancing through the\nnight with his friends. One evening, still troubled by his approaching\ndeath, he abruptly calls a halt to the partying. He banishes the revellers and\nthereafter embarks upon a series of scientific experiments in his basement\nlaboratory. Yet even after discovering a means to convert nitrogen into 140 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nprotein \u2013 \u2018which could do away with hunger in the world forever\u2019 \u2013 the\nCount smashes his scientific equipment and decides to divert his energies\ntowards something new. This time it is love that preoccupies him. A\nromantic interlude ensues in which he woos a young woman (Mechtildis\nThein), escorting her around the castle ramparts, frolicking with her beside\nthe lake, enfolding her in passionate embraces. And yet, despite the \u2018days\nfull of sunshine and happiness\u2019, the Count knows time is running out and\nsoon plunges back into a state of near delirium. Convinced the statue is\nthe source of his torment, he takes it to the lake and casts it into the water.\nOn returning to the castle he is suddenly overcome by a dark intuition and\napproaches the cabinet, only to discover to his horror that the statue has\nmysteriously reappeared \u2013 \u2018The suffering!\u2019\nFig. 9.2 Count Greven encounters the ghostly face of the priest in his cellar.\nFearing imminent death, the Count begins to perceive danger everywhere\nand even accuses his butler of poisoning his tea. He then enters his study to\nfind his lover idly fondling a dagger. This reminds him of the curse \u2013 \u2018The\nhand of the one who is dearest to you\u2019. He promptly takes out his pistol and\nfires at her, but misses. \u2018I hate the world!\u2019 he declares. \u2018I hate life! There is no\nhand that is dearest to me!\u2019\nThe camera now reveals the Buddhist priest has returned to the garden\nand is seated on the lawn in the lotus position, hands clasped over his breast,\nhead bowed. Inside the castle, the Count descends to the cellar, gun in hand,\nwhere he begins to lurch about in suicidal panic. Finally, when the ghostly\nface of the Buddhist priest appears in the air before him, he slowly turns the\ngun towards his own heart and fires.\nIn the closing sequence, a series of double-exposure shots convey the\nspectral image of the priest rising from the lawn and entering the castle. Fear of Cultural Objects 141\nHe climbs the stairs to the cabinet room, retrieves the statue and solemnly\ncarries it away.\n***\nRarely has the restitution of cultural property been so melodramatically\nenacted. While the film could be read as a symbol of the neurotic\nWeltanschauung of the German nation at the end of the war, it also comments\non the psychology of colonial collecting. A closer examination of the film\u2019s\nsymbolism and narrative arc reinforces the relevance of both interpretations.\nThe Weimar Republic, established a year after Fear was released, ushered\nin a cultural environment of what the historian Peter Gay has described\nas \u2018exuberant creativity and experimentation\u2019, and yet one tempered by\n\u2018anxiety, fear and a rising sense of doom\u2019.9 Wiene\u2019s film mirrors these\napparent cultural contradictions as Count Greven veers between irrational\ndread and the rational impulse towards scientific research (the village\nminister who comes to counsel him concludes: \u2018You don\u2019t need a priest,\nyou need a doctor\u2019.) Wiene had dealt with the idea of threatened rationality\nin a number of his films of this period.10 Fear might thus be seen as an\nexample of what the cultural historian Richard Brantlinger has described\nas \u2018Imperial Gothic\u2019, a literary topos that \u2018combines the seemingly scientific,\nprogressive, often Darwinian ideology of imperialism with an antithetical\ninterest in the occult\u2019.11\nFig. 9.3 The spectral image of the Buddhist priest departs\nwith the recovered statuette.\n9 P. Gay, Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider (London: Norton, 2001 [1968]), p. xiv.\n10 Jung and Schatzberg, 1999.\n11 P. Brantlinger, Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830-1914 (Ithaca, NY:\nCornell University Press, 1990), p. 227. 142 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThe \u2018haunting\u2019 of Count Greven provides a useful metaphor through\nwhich to explore more recent developments in the \u2018culture wars\u2019 between\nsource nations and western collectors (be they so-called encyclopaedic\nmuseums or private individuals). Underpinning many of these disputes\nare various strains of fear. On the one hand, it is clear that some European\nand North American museum directors fear that the increasingly vocal\nand determined calls for repatriation of objects acquired during earlier\neras \u2013 indeed still being acquired in 1917 at the time Robert Wiene directed\nFear \u2013 could lead to a serious stripping-out of western museums.12 This was\nmost clearly articulated in the \u2018Declaration on the Importance and Value\nof Universal Museums\u2019 issued by the Bizot Group of museum directors\nin 2002, which proved divisive and controversial within and beyond the\ninternational museum community.\nThe emotional response to rising demands for restitution of objects can\nbe contrasted with the fear felt by some developing nations who interpret\nEuropean and North American museums as tyrannical symbols of imperial\ngreed. As Kavita Singh has noted, the knowledge that significant amounts\nof other nations\u2019 cultural patrimony is languishing in the basements of\nthese museums, much of it uncatalogued and neglected, has engendered\na view of encyclopaedic museums as \u2018terrifying places with insatiable\nappetites for works of art\u2019.13\nCount Greven\u2019s castle, with its grand salons brimming with Dutch\nGolden Age portraits, Imari vases, Indian sculptures and heavy antique\nfurniture, might be seen as a symbol of the western museum complex. The\nCount, having admitted to an unquenchable desire to seek out the world\u2019s\nmost beautiful works of art, struggles to reconcile his acquisitive impulse\nwith a nagging awareness of the unethical nature of his collecting. Returning\nhome with the Buddhist statue looted from the Indian temple at Djaba,\nthe Count places it on a stand in a glazed cabinet concealed behind heavy\ncurtains. The object is thus immediately \u2018museified\u2019, \u2018pedestalised\u2019 \u2013 that\nis, decontextualised, marked out. Its symbolic power as a synecdoche of a\n12 See, for example, J.

Wiene was himself a collector of Benin sculpture, a significant amount\nof which was dispersed through the international art market following\nthe sacking of the Benin kingdom of west Africa by the British Punitive\nExpedition of 1897. This was a classic instance of pith-helmet subjugation,\nthe British ransacking the Benin Kingdom in retaliation for the killing of\nsome of their soldiers during an earlier mission undertaken ostensibly to\nform a trade agreement with the Benin people.15 The Punitive Expedition\nsent the Oba of Benin into exile and looted the kingdom of its cultural\nheritage, including carved ivory leopards and the extraordinary ancient\nbrass sculptures that had for centuries adorned the Oba\u2019s royal residence.\nThe Benin objects almost immediately became enveloped by controversy,\nchiefly on account of the circumstances of their acquisition. Many of the\nbrasses found their way into the British Museum, others entered museums\nin Chicago, Boston, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and elsewhere, while still\nothers were bought at auction by European private collectors or through\ndealers who acquired them on the secondary market. Wiene, it seems, was\none such collector, although exactly when and how he took possession of\nhis own examples is unclear. Dr Hans Feld, former editor of the influential\nGerman film magazine Film Kurier, who knew Wiene during the director\u2019s\ntime in London in the mid-1930s, recalled of his frequent visits to Wiene\u2019s\nflat in Maida Vale:\nWiene and his wife offered a home away from home. He took personal\ninterest in the daily lives of his guests and with his smiling scepticism he\ncreated some balance. His art collection \u2013 mainly Benin sculptures \u2013 was a\nreminder of a world which most of us had forgotten.16\n14 K.P.H.

They are now widely recognised as evidence\nof the worst excesses of colonial aggression and thus symbols of the imperial\nunderpinnings of the \u2018universal\u2019, or encyclopaedic, museum. Was Wiene\nmotivated to write Fear as a result of his own experience of owning a sculpture\nthat had been illicitly removed from a weaker nation? That question may\nnever be settled, but how prescient his film now seems in the light of later\ndevelopments in the fractious politics of cultural heritage collecting.\nThe encyclopaedic museum has its roots in the princely collections of\nRenaissance Europe which held that the ordered arrangement of objects\ncould amount to a legible representation of the wider universe. That\ntradition was developed during the era of the European Enlightenment\nwhen the museum emerged as an expression of the rational impulse to\norder and classify, to contain the whole universe beneath one roof. More\nrecent analyses, however, have come to view the museum\u2019s universalising\nstrategies as fundamentally irrational and illegible, not to say unsustainable.\nAs Eugenio Donato has observed:\nThe set of objects the Museum displays is sustained only by the fiction that\nthey somehow constitute a coherent representational universe \u2026 Such a\nfiction is the result of an uncritical belief in the notion that ordering and\nclassifying, that is to say, the spatial juxtaposition of fragments, can produce\na representational understanding of the world.18\nCount Greven\u2019s collecting is presented as an irrational, obsessive activity\nas opposed to the rational, reflective pursuit of knowledge through\nclassification.19 His private, almost fetishistic relationship with the statue is\nsignalled from the moment he removes it from its box. Jealously guarding\nit from the eyes of others, he embraces it, fondles it, clutches it to his breast\nwith an amorous passion.\n17 J. Clifford, The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth Century Ethnography, Literature and Art\n(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988).\n18 E. Donato, \u2018The Museum\u2019s Furnace: Notes towards a Contextual Reading of Bouvard\nand P\u00e9cuchet\u2019, in J. Harari (ed.), Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structural Criticism\n(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979), p. 223.\n19 Clifford, 1988, p. 219. Fear of Cultural Objects 145\nFig. 9.4 Count Greven with the object of his desire.\nThe phallic connotations are apparent in almost every frame in which\nthe statue is shown: the Count holds it before him like an erect penis,\nhis scopophilic fixation coexisting with the dread that it will be taken\naway from him. The psychoanalytic roots of this kind of anxiety are\nwell documented in Freud\u2019s work, but there are fictional precedents too.\nFrench author Maurice Leblanc\u2019s popular Ars\u00e8ne Lupin mysteries, almost\ncontemporaneous with Fear, echo the torment experienced by Wiene\u2019s\nobsessive collector. In Ars\u00e8ne Lupin in Prison (1907), Leblanc writes:\nBaron Satan leads a life of fear. He is afraid, not for himself, but for the\ntreasures which he has accumulated with so tenacious a passion and with\nthe perspicacity of a collector whom not even the most cunning of dealers\ncan boast of ever having taken in. He loves his curiosities with all the greed\nof a miser, with all the jealousy of a lover.20\nFrom the opening frames of the film, the life of fear led by Wiene\u2019s Count\nGreven is marked out in relation to the statue and seems to be generated\nby a consciousness of his guilt in having stolen it. In a key moment in\nthe film, the Count fires his gun at the figure of the priest who remains\nunharmed \u2013 the first suggestion that he may be merely a figment of the\nCount\u2019s imagination. The Count falls at the priest\u2019s feet and begs to be put\nout of his guilt-ridden misery. \u2018I want to die\u2019, he cries, as if the ultimate\npunishment at the hands of this \u2018terrible Buddha priest\u2019 is the only way to\nend his torment.\nThe theft or unauthorised extraction of cultural heritage, even in its most\nfragmentary form \u2013 and the guilt such acts can engender in the perpetrator\n\u2013 is also a theme in twenty-first-century art practice. British artist Andy\nHolden\u2019s Pyramid Piece (2010), fashioned out of panels of knitted yarn and\nupholstery foam over a steel armature, takes the form of a huge lump of rock.\nIt represents an enlargement of a tiny piece taken from the Great Pyramid\n20 M.

The knitted sculpture, then, is merely a\npretext for the articulation of an inexplicable desire to possess the object\nand the experience of its removal and eventual return.22\nThe unexpected effect an illicitly acquired object or fragment can have\non its possessor is an abiding theme in literature and film. Wilkie Collins\u2019\nThe Moonstone of 1868 set a benchmark for mystery narratives centred\naround disputed cultural heritage. Like the Buddhist statue in Fear, the\nmoonstone has been taken from its rightful home by a European traveller\n(a British army officer) and, as in Fear, it becomes the focus of a quest for\nrepatriation by Indian priests. It is eventually returned to the statue from\nwhich it was originally removed.\nGuilt \u2013 or the anxiety induced by illicit ownership \u2013 seems also to\nhave motivated the return of a fragment of the Colosseum removed by an\nAmerican couple while on holiday in Italy in the 1980s. Regretting what she\neventually came to see as a thoughtless and selfish act, Mrs Janice Johnson\nof North Carolina posted the fragment to Rome\u2019s archaeological office with\na covering letter in which she confessed: \u2018I have been bothered by the fact\nthat we took something that did not belong to us and am now returning it.\nI have felt badly about it whenever I would see this rock sitting on our shelf\namong our other artefacts from trips taken over the years of our lives\u2019.23\nThe not uncommon tendency to assign some metaphysical quality to\ninanimate objects in cultural heritage cases was illustrated by the Johnsons\u2019\nclosing request to the Roman authorities that the fragment be returned to\nthe Colosseum \u2018so it may again be at rest back where it belongs\u2019.24\nThe guilt experienced by individuals like the Johnsons can be contrasted\nwith the attitudes of stubborn indifference adopted by encyclopaedic\n21 Andy Holden, Tate Shot: Art Now: Return of the Pyramid Piece, 10 April 2010, http://www.\nyoutube.com/watch?v=mr5WCSziG28\n22 Described by Holden in the associated video work, Return of the Pyramid Piece, https://\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=mr5WCSziG28\n23 \u2018US tourists return Roman artifact 25 years later\u2019, The Guardian, 7 May 2009, http://www.\nguardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8495017\n24 \u2018US couple return ancient artifact to Rome after 25 years\u2019, The Telegraph, 8 May 2008,\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5293725/US-couple-\nreturn-ancient-artifact-to-Rome-after-25-years.html Fear of Cultural Objects 147\nmuseums seeking to deflect calls for return. Expressions of remorse or regret\n\u2013 accompanied by an official apology \u2013 have occasionally been articulated by\ngovernments or heads of state on behalf of nations seeking to heal historical\nwrongs, often inflicted during the imperial age. In the case of the Parthenon\nMarbles in the British Museum \u2013 the appropriation of which by Lord Elgin is\nalso widely viewed as an act of cultural desecration, the Ottoman permission\nto remove them notwithstanding \u2013 opinion polls consistently show a majority\nof the public in favour of return.25 In this respect, the British Museum and\nmany of today\u2019s larger museums who face similar cases, are failing to act\nin accordance with the wishes and sensibilities of the people they purport\nto represent. Might it be the case that they have come to see the prospect of\nmass returns as a form of punishment for the acquisitive activities of earlier\ngenerations. Fear of punishment was not what drove Mrs. Johnson to return\nthe fragment of the Colosseum, she merely felt it was the ethical thing to\ndo. But guilt seems to have been a motivating factor, as it was in the case\nof Andy Holden\u2019s returned pyramid piece. In Fear, Count Greven\u2019s attempt\nto banish his sense of guilt lead him to try and dispose of the stolen statue\nby throwing it in the lake. The theme echoes Picasso\u2019s attempt a few years\nearlier to dispose of an ancient Iberian sculpture in his collection, which had\nbeen sold to him by an associate of his friend Apollinaire, a Belgian named\nG\u00e9ry Pieret, who had stolen it from the Louvre in 1911.26 Under suspicion for\nthe theft, Picasso and Apollinaire considered throwing the sculpture in the\nSeine to deflect suspicion away from themselves and, presumably, thereby\nto remove the burden of fear and guilt.\nFreud saw guilt as the most important problem in the evolution of culture,\nmaintaining that \u2018the price of progress in civilisation is paid in forfeiting\nhappiness through the heightening of the sense of guilt\u2019.27 Moreover, in his\nclinical studies Freud found that \u2018the sense of guilt expresses itself in an\nunconscious seeking for punishment\u2019.28 Throughout Fear, Wiene provides\nplentiful hints that what we are witnessing are the phantasms of a psychotic\nmind \u2013 the ghostly apparition in the garden; the magical reappearance\nof the statue in its cabinet after the Count has thrown it in the lake; the\n25 The issue of \u2018restitution\u2019 is discussed by Sir Mark Jones in Chapter 10 in this volume.\n26 S.

Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu). All these combine to deliver\nan aura of the uncanny, the Unheimlich, that characterised so much German\nexpressionist cinema of this period.29\nThe fear that a wronged people \u2013 often configured as the dead or half-\ndead \u2013 will somehow return to wreak ghastly vengeance on the living is\nan enduring trope of the Gothic genre (the Buddhist priest who cannot be\nkilled also prefigures the zombies beloved of later Hollywood horror). To\nsuggest that the vengeful Other of the imperial age has now returned to\nhaunt the encyclopaedic museum might be to stretch the metaphor. What\nis undeniable, however, is that the increasingly clamorous demands by\nsource nations for return of their cultural property is beginning to present\nan existential challenge to these institutions.\nTellingly, at the end of Wiene\u2019s film, although Count Greven has killed\nhimself, the image of the \u2018terrible Buddhist priest\u2019 \u2013 previously presented as\na probable symptom of the Count\u2019s psychotic state \u2013 survives in film time\nto reclaim his temple statue. Wiene thereby genuflects towards that strand\nof counter-Enlightenment metaphysics upon which the cinematic art has\nalways thrived. Thus, while ostensibly a psychodrama about an obsessive\ncollector, Fear is also a disquisition on film itself and our fascination with\nthe threshold between fantasy and reality and the monsters lurking beyond\nthe boundaries of the rational mind. Meanwhile, the increasingly persistent\ncalls on European and North American museums for the return of cultural\nobjects are not issuing from some spectral being. They are a reality. If, like\nCount Greven, we feel fear, it is entirely of our own making.\n29 Freud, 1990/1919; S.S. Prawer, Caligari\u2019s Children: The Film as Tale of Terror (Cambridge,\nMA: Da Capo, 1980). 10. Restitution\nMark Jones1\nIn considering the thorny questions of restitution it may be helpful to\nbegin with some recent examples of restitution in action, to see if the\npractice and principles enunciated to support, or implicit in, these cases\nhave a bearing on the yet more controversial areas in which claims for\nrestitution remain contentious.\nOn St Andrews Day 1996, a rectangular block of sandstone, \u2018The Stone\nof Destiny\u2019, was formally installed in Edinburgh Castle.\nFig. 11.1 The Coronation Chair of Edward I, 1296,\nwith the Stone of Destiny.\n1 A version of this essay appeared in The Art Newspaper, 250, October 2013, pp. 67-70.\n\u00a9 Mark Jones, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.10 150 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThis act of restitution was intended symbolically and really to undo\nthe actions of Edward I of England \u2018Hammer of the Scots\u2019 who, seven\nhundred years earlier in 1296, had instructed that the Stone of Destiny, the\ncoronation stone of the Kings of Scots, should be taken from Scone Abbey\nand carried south to Westminster Abbey. There it was placed in the King of\nEngland\u2019s coronation chair, \u2018King Edward\u2019s Chair\u2019, in Westminster Abbey,\nthus symbolically asserting and reinforcing England\u2019s claim to sovereignty\nover Scotland.\nFig. 11.2 King Edward\u2019s Chair, Westminster Abbey, England.\nThe Scots were not alone in believing that objects had the power to confer\nand confirm legitimacy in the exercise of power. St Stephen\u2019s Crown, for\nexample, not only conferred legitimacy on the kings of Hungary, but\nruled in their place during the regency that followed the First World War.\nSimilarly, the royal treasures held at the Abbey of St Dennis had a crucial\npart in the inauguration of the Kings of France and the London Stone had\na similar function for those who ruled London. For many cultures across\nthe globe (e.g. Maori taonga in New Zealand), objects can acquire sacred\nor symbolic power which makes them much more significant to people\u2019s\nsense of themselves and their history than their often unimpressive physical\nappearance might suggest. It is the symbolic significance of possession and\nrelinquishment, their close association with perceptions of power and status,\nthat makes restitution and return so difficult and emotionally charged.\nThe return of the Stone of Destiny was initiated by a desperately\nunpopular Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Forsyth Restitution 151\n(now Baron Forsyth of Drumlean), who presumably hoped that its return\nwould persuade Scottish voters that Scotland\u2019s nationhood would remain\nproud and intact under Conservative administration, without devolution\n(the re-creation of a Scottish parliament) and within the United Kingdom.\nIt was not a success: the Conservatives lost all their Scottish seats in the\nfollowing elections.\nSurprisingly few questions about this act of restitution were raised at\nthe time. But the Irish and the English have, if we can derive a theory of\nrestitution from the generality of current cases, a better claim to the Stone\nthan the Scots. It is often maintained that objects should be returned to\ntheir place of origin: this is one of the bases of Italian, Greek, Turkish and\nEgyptian claims for the return of antiquities. Yet the \u2018origin\u2019 of the authentic\nStone of Destiny is, according to legend, not Edinburgh or Scone but Tara in\nIreland. It is sometimes also claimed that it is the length of association with\na particular place or culture that is important. But the Stone of Destiny has\nbeen in Westminster Abbey for longer than it was at Scone Abbey.\nTo complicate matters further the Stone\u2019s authenticity is questionable.\nAlex Salmond (First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National\nParty) is one of many who have publicly doubted it.2 It can hardly be true\nthat the stone is, as legend would have it, the coronation stone of the Kings of\nTara in Ireland, brought by King Fergus to Scotland in the late fifth century.\nGeologists have identified the stone from which it is made as coming from\nthe vicinity not of Tara but of Scone in Scotland. Nor does it look like the seat\non which John Balliol was crowned in 1292. Walter de Hemingford, who\nattended Balliol\u2019s coronation, described this as \u2018hollowed and made in the\nform of a round chair\u2019.3 Perhaps the Abbot of Scone gave Edward\u2019s men\nsomething else altogether and hid the authentic chair. But if so, why was\nthe authentic stone not used for the coronation of Robert the Bruce? And\nwhy did the Scots want it back badly enough to make its return one of their\nobjectives in negotiating the Treaty of Edinburgh/Northampton in 1327-28\n(Edward III issued a royal writ requiring its return, but it was never carried\nout). In 1950 four young nationalists stole the stone from Westminster Abbey.\nIt was broken in the process and Alex Salmond is not alone in suggesting that\nthe stone returned in 1951 could have been one of the copies made by Bertie\nGray, the Glasgow stonemason to whom the stone was taken for repair. But\n2 Auslan Cramb, \u2018Stone of Destiny is fake, claims Alex Salmond\u2019, The Telegraph, 16 June\n2008, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/2136221/Stone-of-Destiny-is-\nfake-claims-Alex-Salmond.html\n3 T his suggests that it was similar to St Winifred\u2019s seventh-century throne, the \u2018Frith Stool\u2019,\nin Hexham Abbey, which is made in exactly this way. 152 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nwould Scots therefore regard an English claim for the permanent return of\nthe Stone to Westminster with indifference? Almost certainly not; at least\nuntil a more convincing and better preserved version turns up.\nIt begins, I hope, to be apparent that discussion of restitution within the\nUnited Kingdom raises many of the key issues in a context which, precisely\nbecause it is domestic \u2013 and therefore somewhat less fraught than restitution\nclaims involving disputes between states as well as nations \u2013 helps us to\nunderstand that these issues are universal.\nThere are many other examples of restitution debates within the UK. In\nMay 1999 the leading Scottish Nationalist Winnie Ewing was quoted in the\nGlasgow Herald: \u2018Not only have we seen the return of the Stone of Destiny\nto Scotland, but another part of our history is returning\u2019.4 She was referring\nto the Dunkeld Lectern which is said to have been made in Italy in 1498 and\ngiven by Pope Alexander VI to George Crichton when he became Bishop of\nDunkeld in 1526 (rather confusingly since Alexander VI died in 1503).\nFig. 11.3 The lectern at St Alban\u2019s, Copnor.\nWilliam Galloway, a Scottish antiquarian writing in 1879, suggested that\nthe lectern, which bears George Crichton\u2019s name and arms, and which had\nbeen found in St Stephen\u2019s Church, in the English town St Albans, when\nthe Montagu family tomb was opened in 1748, might have been given to\n4 R aymond Duncan, \u2018A lost Scots treasure emerges from hiding Dunkeld Lectern makes\ncapital return\u2019, The Herald, 3 May 1999, http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/\naberdeen/a-lost-scots-treasure-emerges-from-hiding-dunkeld-lectern-makes-capital-\nreturn-1.293750 Restitution 153\nthe church by Sir Richard Lee.5 It is known that Lee looted a brass font from\nHolyrood Abbey during a punitive expedition launched against the Scots\nby Henry VIII in 1544, which he gave to the Abbey Church (now cathedral)\nin St Albans and which was melted down during the English Civil War,\nso Galloway suggested that the lectern might also have been looted and\ndemanded its return to Scotland.\nThe lectern\u2019s loan to the exhibition \u2018Angels, Nobles and Unicorns\u2019 in 1982\naroused strong nationalist feelings in Scotland and it was stolen from St\nStephen\u2019s church in 1984. Happily it reappeared, after extended negotiations\nbetween the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, during my time\nas director of the National Museums of Scotland in the 1990s, and eventually\nwent on display in the Museum of Scotland as an icon of Scottish History.\nBut again, on the basis of the accepted story, the lectern originated not in\nScotland but in Italy and has been associated with St Stephen\u2019s Church, St\nAlbans for more than 400 years (from roughly 1544 to 1984) \u2013 much longer\nthan with Dunkeld (less than 20 years). To add to the confusion, a census of\neagle lecterns of this type demonstrates that they are overwhelmingly found\nin churches north of London, in East Anglia and central England, and it\nseems probable that they were made in England or the Low Countries. So it\nmust be the historic wrong, Sir Richard Lee\u2019s putative pillage, that motivated\nthe Church and others to work for, or accept, its return to Scotland, rather\nthan anything particularly Scottish about the object.\nOther contested British objects recently in the news include the Lewis\nchess pieces, the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Great Bed of Ware.\nFig. 11.4 Great Bed of Ware.\n5 W illiam Galloway, \u2018Notice of an ancient Scottish Lectern of Brass, now in the Parish\nChurch of St Stephen\u2019s, St Albans, Hertfordshire\u2019, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries\nof Scotland, 13, 1878-79, pp. 278-301. 154 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThe Great Bed of Ware was made around 1590 to attract custom to the\nWhite Hart Inn in Ware. Subsequently in other inns in Ware, it was sold\nin 1870 to the owner of Rye House, Hoddesdon, before being bought by\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum in 1931. Some argue that the Great Bed\n\u2018belongs\u2019 in Ware, although there is nothing obviously contestable about\nthe chain of ownership. Its return to the town for a year from April 2012 to\nApril 2013 has been generally welcomed, though even with the publicity\ngenerated by this historic event only about 25,000 people saw it during its\nyear there, perhaps a tenth as many as would have seen it in the V&A over\nthe same period. The experiment has perhaps dampened the sometimes\nexcessive expectations about the consequences of a \u2018return\u2019 while at the\nsame time reinforcing understanding that there can be multiple legitimate\ninterests or stakeholders in a historically resonant object, particularly when\nthat object is in a public collection and therefore in some sense owned by\n\u2018the people\u2019 as well as by a particular institution.\nFig. 11.5 The opening of St Luke\u2019s Gospel in the Lindisfarne Gospels. Restitution 155\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels, made by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne (699-\n721), has been in the British Museum/British Library since its foundation in\n1753, given by the heirs of Sir Robert Cotton (1570-1631) who acquired it in\nthe early seventeenth century, after its removal from Durham under Henry\nVIII in the 1530s.\nIts return to the north-east of England has been vigorously campaigned\nfor, a campaign that is supported by the former Bishop of Durham, now\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. He was quoted in the Northern\nEcho: \u2018I think something that comes from here should be part of the life\nof the region\u2019.6 John Danby of the Northumbrian Association took a less\nnuanced view: \u2018They should be restored to their rightful home\u2019.7 It remains\nto be seen to what extent the loan of the Lindisfarne Gospels to Durham\nfrom July-September 2013 satisfied local opinion.\nThe Lewis chess pieces bring us back to Scotland, but in this case the\nissues surrounding them are as much intra as inter-national.\nFig. 11.6 Chess pieces from Uig, Lewis, now at the\nNational Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh.\nThese walrus ivory and whale tooth chess and gaming pieces, made in\nthe late twelfth century, were found in a kist, or container, in the dunes\n6 M ark Tallentyre, \u2018Church\u2019s new leader calls for Lindisfarne Gospels\u2019 return\u2019, Northern Echo, 12\nNovember 2012, http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northdurham/10040266.\nChurch_s_new_leader_calls_for_Lindisfarne_Gospels__return/?ref=arc\n7 \u2018 Petition demands return of Lindisfarne Gospels\u2019, The Journal, 16 March 2006,\nhttp://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/petition-demands-return-\nlindisfarne-gospels-4581288 156 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nat Uig on Lewis in 1831. Eighty-two are now in the British Museum and\neleven in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh.8 When I was\ndirector of the National Museums of Scotland in the 1990s there were\nstrongly stated demands for their return to Lewis \u2013 whether to Stornoway\nor Uig was a matter of debate. There seemed to be a real risk that the\npieces could be \u2018kidnapped\u2019 if returned to Lewis, but regular loans to the\nMuseum of the Western Isles, initially from the British Museum and the\nNational Museums of Scotland, and in subsequent years from the NMS\nalone, created a reasonably harmonious partnership which then extended\nto other exchanges.\nIn 2007-8 there was a new campaign for their return. Linda Fabiani,\nScottish Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture said \u2018it is\nunacceptable that only 11 Lewis Chessmen rest at the National Museum\nof Scotland while the other 82 remain in the British Museum in London\u2019,\nthus appearing to suggest that \u2018return\u2019 should be to Edinburgh rather\nthan Lewis. Margaret Hodge, then Minister for the Arts in Westminster\nresponded \u2018It\u2019s a lot of nonsense isn\u2019t it?\u2019,9 while Bonnie Greer, deputy\nchairman of the British Museum \u2018absolutely\u2019 believed that they should stay\nin London. A renewed loan to an exhibition that toured Scotland in 2009-\n11, and an agreement that six chess pieces from the British Museum will\ngo on long-term loan to the new museum in Lews Castle in 201510 seemed\nto restore a degree of harmony. No claim to the chess pieces has yet been\nlodged by Norway, although the balance of scholarly opinion is that they\nwere probably made in Trondheim.\nWhat can be learnt from the five examples cited here? First, that there\nis a strong tendency for well-known objects associated with a place to be\nclaimed for that place. Sometimes the claim is that a historic wrong should\nbe put right: Henry VIII\u2019s despoliation of the monasteries or English looting\nof a Scottish church. Sometimes there is a sense that objects are significant\nto the culture, history or society of the place, region or nation in question.\nTheir absence leaves something important incomplete: repossession will\nrestore the community\u2019s identity and make it whole. There are economic\narguments too: tourism would be generated and the local economy\nboosted by possession of the contested objects. In no case is the argument\nfor \u2018return\u2019 \u2013 and I put return in inverted commas because this is the term\n8 Given by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1888.\n9 S unday Herald, 3 February 2008.\n10 Frank Urquhart, \u2018Lews Castle to house Western Isles museum\u2019, Scotsman, 27 November\n2013, http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/arts/news/lews-castle-to-house-western-isles-\nmuseum-1-3210848 Restitution 157\nmost widely used even though strictly four out of five cases do not involve\nreturn to the putative place of origin \u2013 based on what would generally be\nregarded as a coherent set of generally agreed principles. And yet in every\ncase the argument is deeply felt, often widely supported and, in terms of\npublic reception and results, quite effective.\nIndeed, if we look solely at the effects of the restitution claims cited here,\nit could be argued that they are on balance positive. The Lewis chess pieces\nare much better known, have been more thoroughly studied and seen and\nenjoyed by many more people than would have been the case if they had\nremained uncontroversial. The same is true of the Lindisfarne Gospels\nwhich, though on display in the British Museum for many years when I\nworked there, attracted very little public attention. The return of the Stone\nof Destiny meant a lot to many Scots, but there has been no comparable and\noffsetting sense of loss in England. Active and valuable partnerships have\nbeen created around several of these objects, partnerships which would\nnot have come into being without the stimulus of controversy. Although\nthere are unattractive, dog-in-the-mangerish aspects of all these claims,\nthe overall outcome has, so far, been beneficial for all concerned. So might\nrestitution claims be a good thing, to be encouraged rather than feared?\nCertainly the climate of opinion has changed significantly over the last\nfifty years. When I first worked in the British Museum in the 1970s, it was\nregular practice to take in and study coin hoards which had been illegally\nexcavated and exported. The argument was that there would be a significant\nloss to our knowledge of the past if these hoards went unrecorded. This\nwas true of course, but when it became obvious that the countries from\nwhich these hoards came regarded this as unethical and unacceptable, and\na boycott of offending museums was threatened, policy changed. Since\nthen the British Museum has taken the view that museums must not give\nencouragement or legitimacy to illegal excavation and trade by acquiring,\nexhibiting or researching objects which do not have a legitimate history\ngoing back to the date of signature of the UNESCO Convention on the\nMeans of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer\nof Ownership of Cultural Property 1970,11 and has encouraged others to\nfollow suit.\nI took part in the debates on this issue in the Bizot Group of directors of\nthe big international art museums in the mid-2000s. Philippe de Montebello,\nthen Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and James\n11 For the text of this convention see http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&\nURL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html 158 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nCuno, then Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, were among those who\nargued that the acquisition of unprovenanced works could be a moral duty.\nIf great works of art, however discovered, were not acquired by reputable\nmuseums, they would be lost to scholarship and the edification and\nappreciation of the public. Against that it was argued that by apparently\nlegitimising the collection of unprovenanced works, museums would give\nout the message that private collection of such pieces would, eventually, be\napproved not deprecated. Collectors would know that, after the passage\nof a suitable number of years, they could proudly show their collection in\npublic and perhaps end up by acquiring the prestige accrued from the gift\nof important and valuable works to great public museums. This tended\nto sustain the illegal trade which does so much damage to archaeological\nsites and the artefacts found there, and deprives us all of the invaluable\ninformation that only proper excavation can provide. Now all major\nmuseums agree on this: indeed, having been actively pursued through the\ncourts by the Italian government, the Getty and the Metropolitan Museums\nhave returned illegally traded objects to Italy. As a result, the value of\nunprovenanced material has reduced in comparison with provenanced\nmaterial and restitution is now regarded as right and proper where it can\nbe shown that objects have been illegally excavated or traded. Interestingly\nthough, few museums are undertaking active, systematic provenance\nresearch to see if their collections do in fact contain such objects.\nThis chimes with other areas in which ethical questions about the process\nof acquisition or the propriety of retention have been raised. Holdings of\nhuman remains, which remained uncontroversial until the 1980s, became\nthe focus of increased anxiety and distaste in the 1990s and were the subject\nof UK government legislation to enable their return in 2004. The Department\nfor Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) \u2018Guidance for the Care of Human\nRemains in Museums\u2019 issued in October 2005, with the explicit support of\nthe National Museum Directors\u2019 Conference and the Museums Association\nrecognised that \u2018some [human remains] were acquired between 100 and\n200 years ago from Indigenous peoples in colonial circumstances, where\nthere was a very uneven divide of power\u2019, and recommended meticulous\nprovenance research with open public access to the resulting information.12\nIt also provided a step by step guide to dealing with claims for return.\n12 h ttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/\npublications/GuidanceHumanRemains11Oct.pdf, p. 8. Restitution 159\nIn the USA, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation\nAct, which was signed into law by President George Bush in November\n1990, requires federal agencies13 and institutions that receive federal\nfunding to return Native American \u2018cultural items\u2019 to lineal descendants\nand culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organisations.\nAt the same time, the American Art Museum Directors (AAMD) have in\ntheir own words \u2018taken a leadership role in restitution of art and other\nproperty stolen by the Nazis\u2019. Accepting that the historic wrongs done\nduring the period of Nazi rule in Germany (1933-45) should be undone\nwherever possible, they published guidelines in June 1998 which became\nthe basis of the Washington Principles agreed later that year. These\ncommitted museums to careful and detailed analysis of the provenance of\nall objects that changed ownership in Europe during the period in question.\nThe importance the AAMD attaches to this is evident from its website\nwhich states:\nThe AAMD promulgates fundamental standards by which art museums\nshould be governed and managed. \u2026 the AAMD\u2019s commitment to these\ncore values and the success of its members in the identification, recovery\nand restitution of works seized by the Nazis have ensured that America\u2019s\nart museums are among the most trusted and respected public institutions\nin the world.14\nBritish museums, led by Sir Nicholas Serota, followed suit and in both\ncountries meticulous provenance research has been undertaken and a number\nof claims for restitution have been successful: settled by return of objects\nto earlier owners or their heirs or by the payment of agreed compensation.\nInterestingly, many of them have turned out to be cases in which the works\nwere not in fact stolen or seized, as envisaged by the AAMD, but sold under\npressure. The Stuttgart Staatsgallerie\u2019s recent \u2018return\u2019 to Canada of a Virgin\nand Child, formerly attributed to the Master of Fl\u00e9malle, righted the wrong\ndone when the picture dealer Max Stern had to sell the painting in order\nto raise the money needed to buy an exit visa from Nazi Germany for his\nmother.15 Where compensation has been agreed, it is based on the value of\n13 h ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_agencies\n14 \u2018Art museums and the identification and restitution of works stolen by the Nazis\u2019,\nStatement on standards and practices issued by the Association of Art Museum Directors, May\n2007, https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/Nazi-looted%20art_clean_06_2007.\npdf\n15 David D\u2019Arcy, \u2018Canada under pressure over potential Nazi loot\u2019, The Art Newspaper, 3\nApril 2013, p. 3. 160 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nthe work now, not on an estimate of the difference between the price actually\nobtained and the true value then. So this is a generous and comprehensive\napproach, but it so far applies only to the Nazi period in Europe. Attempts\nto extend it to victims of the Armenian genocide (1915-18 and 1920-23) have\nmade some progress in California, but it remains to be seen whether the\ncase brought against the J. Paul Getty Museum by the Armenian Apostolic\nChurch for the return of seven manuscript pages from the Zeyt\u2019un Gospels\nwill succeed. The case has already had some impact though: the Getty has\nbegun discussions with the Matenadaran, the Armenian museum that hold\nthe rest of the Zeyt\u2019un Gospels.16\nWhile a member of the Bizot Group, I had the slightly surreal\nexperience in 2003 of seeing a chorus of nodded agreement from my\ninternational museum colleagues to the proposal by Italian museum\ndirectors that the Group should take a public stand against the return of\nthe Axum Obelisk to Ethiopia.\nFig. 11.7 The Axum Obelisk (also known as the Roman Stele) in Rome,\nwhere it stood in front of the UN Food and Agriculture\nOrganization\u2019s headquarters until 2005.\nFortunately, assent evaporated when it was explained not only that\nMussolini had taken the obelisk as war booty in 1937 and erected it in\n16 Laura Gilbert, \u2018Restitution to get harder in California?\u2019, The Art Newspaper, 4 April 2013, p. 4. Restitution 161\nRome as a sign of imperial conquest, but also that at the conclusion of the\nSecond World War Italy had formally agreed its return in 1947. The Bizot\nGroup risked being seen to apply one standard to those of European origin\nwho had suffered loss in the period 1933-45 and quite another to Ethiopia.\nThe obelisk was in fact returned in 2005 and re-erected in 2008.\nFig. 11.8 The Axum Obelisk in Axum.\nTwo other relevant examples of return both concern manuscripts. The\nmanuscripts of Icelandic sagas were systematically sought out and\ncollected by antiquarians in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and\ntaken to Denmark for preservation and study. Danish recognition of the\ncentral importance of these manuscripts to Icelandic culture was ratified by\nlegislation passed in 1961, which led to a gradual transfer back to Iceland\nof a significant proportion of the manuscripts over the period 1971-97.\nInitially contentious this became a focus of scholarly collaboration between\nthe \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson Institute in Reykjavik and the Arnamagnean Institute\nin Copenhagen (which retains a significant collection of saga manuscripts)\nand a warm point in Danish-Icelandic relations. The consensus built around\nthis return contrasts with the bitter feelings engendered by France\u2019s return\nof manuscripts looted by a French punitive expedition which raided Korea\nin 1866 after the execution of a number of French Catholic missionaries. 162 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nReturn was first agreed by President Mitterrand during a visit to Seoul in 1993\nand was widely believed to be connected with the award of a very large contract\nto build a high-speed rail link to the French bidder. Mitterrand, overriding\nthe protests of the then director of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Emmanuel\nLe Roy Ladaurie and the relevant curators, took one manuscript with him:\nreturned according to the Koreans, lent according to the French. Despite a\nstrong campaign, led by curators in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, who pointed\nout that alienation of objects in French public collections is illegal, President\nSarkozy decided to honour the agreement. A formal agreement was made\nbetween President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and President Sarkozy of\nFrance that the remaining 297 volumes should be returned on the basis of a\nfive year renewable loan. The manuscripts went back to Korea in 2011 and\nnobody expects that they will return to France, except as occasional reciprocal\nloans. The National Museum of Korea held an exhibition in the autumn of that\nyear which in the words of their website \u2018celebrated the homecoming of uigwe,\nwhich were looted from their rightful place \u2026 in 1866\u2019.17\nFig. 11.9 Basalt stela with a relief of Antiochus I Epiphanes.\nThe issues raised here are of particular importance to museums in Britain\nsince they, like American and French public collections, are responsible\n17 h ttp://www.museum.go.kr/program/show/showDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002002002\n&searchSelect=A.SHOWKOR&pageSize=10&showID=4620 Restitution 163\nfor significant numbers of contested objects. Turkey has recently claimed\nthe return of a number of objects from museums around the world, most\npublicly the Stele of Antiochus I from the British Museum.\nThe British Museum has responded by pointing out that the stele was\nacquired by Leonard Wooley in 1924 with permission from the French\nauthorities in Syria, where the artefact was then stored. It has expressed\nwillingness to discuss a loan for temporary exhibition but concluded its\nApril 2012 press release by stating that \u2018The Trustees of the British Museum\ncannot consent to the transfer of ownership of the stele and firmly believe\nthat it should remain part of the British Museum\u2019s collection where it can be\nseen in a world context by a global audience\u2019. A consequence of this dispute\nhas been that Turkey now refuses to lend to the British Museum which also\nhas problematic relations with Greece over the Parthenon Marbles, and with\nEgypt. This is an uncomfortable and potentially damaging situation for one\nof the world\u2019s greatest museums of the ancient Mediterranean. The problems\nfaced by the British Museum are far from unique.\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum, like all museums with significant\ninternational collections, faces similar dilemmas. To start with a little\nknown example, it emerged in the early 2000s that a Spanish monstrance\nin the V&A\u2019s collection might have been stolen from a monastery in Spain\nin 1885. Careful research demonstrated that the stolen object and the one\nin the V&A really were one and the same. The museum faced a problem.\nLegally the V&A could retain the artefact as the monstrance had been left\nto the museum by someone who had good title to it under English law.\nThe National Heritage Act 1983, governing the V&A, does not allow it to\ndispose of objects unless they are duplicate or useless. The monstrance was\nneither. So it was agreed by the V&A trustees in 2003 that the object should\nbe returned, subject to certain assurances about its care. With the help of the\nthen British ambassador to Spain, an agreement satisfactory to both sides\nwas reached and the monstrance was returned to Spain, to the treasury of\nZamora Cathedral, in 2005.18\nAnother case that arose during my time at the V&A concerned the\nEthiopian treasures taken from the Emperor Theodore after his defeat at the\nBattle of Magdala in 1868.\nW.E. Gladstone, who was Prime Minister at the time, told the House\nof Commons that \u2018he deeply lamented, for the sake of the country, and\nfor the sake of all those concerned, that those articles, to us insignificant,\nthough probably to the Abyssinians sacred and imposing symbols, or at\n18 Minutes of the Board of Trustees, 17 April 2003 \u2013 23 June 2005. 164 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nleast hallowed by association, were thought fit to be brought away by a\nBritish Army\u2019. He went on to say that \u2018with that just and kindly spirit which\nbelonged to him, Lord Napier said these articles, whatever the claim of the\nArmy, ought not to be placed among the national treasures, and said they\nought to be held in deposit till they could be returned to Abyssinia\u2019.19 The\nV&A received a letter from the then President of Ethiopia asking for their\nreturn. But a reasonably positive response which asked among other things\nfor information about the gold crown returned in the 1930s received no\nreply. One complication is that as a result of the 1983 Act, the ownership of\nthese objects \u2013 which had originally been a government loan \u2013 was vested\nto the V&A into the property of the Trustees.20\nFig. 11.10 Crown, Ethiopia, 1740.\nTowards the end of my time at the V&A, two other issues arose. One\nconcerned a small marble head of a child taken by the archaeologist Sir\nCharles Wilson from the Sidamara Sarcophagus, a third-century Roman\ntomb which he excavated in 1882 and which is now in the Archaeological\nMuseum in Istanbul.\nFig. 11.11 Carved marble head of a child, third century, excavated in 1882.\n19 30 June 1871.\n20 Trustees minutes, 20 October 2005. Restitution 165\nThe head was subsequently left to the V&A by his daughter. It seemed\nevident to me, my colleagues and the trustees who I consulted that it should\nbe returned. Actually, this had been agreed in principle by the V&A in the\n1930s, but never executed. The head does not fit with the collections of the\nV&A, which has no classical antiquities, and serves no useful purpose there.\nBut it clearly does belong with the sarcophagus from which it was taken.\nI hope that its return will not be long delayed. It would be particularly\nunfortunate if it were argued that return would set a dangerous precedent.\nTo suggest that the rectification of an obvious anomaly of this kind would\nprejudice the case for the retention of the Parthenon marbles or other\nantiquities would be to accept that there are parallels where there are really\nnone \u2013 and so weaken not strengthen the case for retention.\nI well remember the claim made for the return of what were then known\nas the Elgin Marbles in the early 1980s, the then director David Wilson\u2019s\nsturdy assertion that they legally and legitimately belonged to the British\nMuseum, and his mixture of pleasure and annoyance at the visit of the then\nMinster for Culture of Greece, the charismatic Melina Mercouri. Following\nthat episode, there was a period when the Greek government was willing,\neven eager, to discuss recognition of the British Museum\u2019s legal ownership\nof the marbles on the condition that the Greek stake in them was also\nrecognised and they were in practice shared between London and Athens. It\nseems a shame that that offer was not taken up and that it was subsequently\nwithdrawn, just as it is a shame that the risk that any sculpture lent might\nnot be returned was not properly weighed against the risk that a failure to\ncreate partnership around the Marbles might eventually make the British\nMuseum\u2019s tenure of them unsustainable.\nFig. 11.12 View of the Acropolis from\nthe interior of the New Acropolis Museum. 166 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nThe last case I had to deal with was that of the objects looted from the\nSummer Palace (and elsewhere) during the European invasions of China\nin 1860 and 1900.\nFig. 11.13 Chinese Imperial throne, carved lacquer on wood\ndepicting five clawed dragons, Qing dynasty, 1775-80.\nOn a visit to China in 2010 with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British\nMuseum, I suggested that we propose a programme of serious and sustained\njoint provenance research with our colleagues in the Palace and National\nMuseums of China, so as to ascertain, as far as possible, the history of the\nobjects in the two museums\u2019 collections. I was very pleased when, at a joint\npress conference in Beijing the following day, Neil MacGregor put forward\nthis suggestion on behalf of the British Museum and the V&A. It seemed\nto me that this would be a good way to begin the process of deciding the\nlong-term future of the looted objects. Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault\u2019s recent\ndecision to return the rat and rabbit bronze heads from the Summer Palace\nwith the statement that \u2018the family \u2026 strongly believe they belong in their\nrightful home\u2019, which reflects both the importance of the Chinese market to\na luxury goods group like Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and the significance\nof this gesture to Franco-Chinese relations, confirms that the issue needs to\nbe addressed urgently.21 A report on their return to the National Museum\nof China quotes a worker surnamed Zhao: \u2018As a Chinese I hope all those\nother antiques scattered throughout the world will be returned to China\ntoo, but it will depend on how powerful China becomes\u2019.22\n21 Scheherazade Daneshkhu, \u2018Symbols of amity\u2019, Financial Times, 27/28 April 2013, p. 4.\n22 Kathrin Hille, \u2018Pinault gives bronze rat and rabbit back to China\u2019, Financial Times, 29 June\n2013. Restitution 167\nWhat has emerged, I hope, is that we now have abundant examples\nof practice, good and not-so-good, in the field of restitution. Museums in\nAmerica and Europe have publicly committed themselves to the principle that\nrestitution, or return, can and should be used to right past wrongs. We can see\nfrom the numerous examples available to us that engaging with the problems\nposed by contested objects has had beneficial consequences. Even the Getty\nMuseum, having lived through the trauma of the Italian trial of its former\ncurator of classical antiquities Marion True, has established better relations\nwith the Italian authorities than it had before \u2013 although it might have done\nstill better had it responded positively when the issue was first raised.23\nThe same standards must apply universally. We cannot have one rule\nfor Scotland or Spain and another for Turkey or Nigeria. We cannot rectify\nwrongs wrought in Europe and ignore those committed elsewhere. We\ncannot proclaim that objects belong in the British Museum \u2018where they can\nbe seen in a world context by a global audience\u2019 without recognising that\nIstanbul (like Beijing and Shanghai or Delhi and Mumbai) can also claim to\nbe a \u2018world city\u2019 with a \u2018global audience\u2019.\nThere are real risks in action, not least to the preservation of the objects,\nas the return of some of the Benin bronzes in the 1950s and the Ethiopian\nCrown in the 1930s demonstrate. But these risks are not as great as some\nimagine. The number of genuinely contested objects is small in number\nand tiny as a proportion of total museum collection. Inaction is riskier\nstill: time is not on the side of those responsible for contested objects. A\nprice, in terms of the unrealised benefits of collaboration, is already being\npaid. More serious are the risks of future confrontation over objects which\ncould and should be productive of partnership and good feeling. China\nhas not yet asked for the return of looted objects. Mitterrand and Sarkozy\u2019s\nnegotiations with South Korea give us an idea of what might happen if it\ndoes. And it will of course, it is just a question of when.\nProponents of an active approach to the resolution of disagreement\naround artefacts are often accused by those in the museum profession of\nnaivet\u00e9, of not fully understanding the situation. My own conclusion, after\na lifetime working in some of the museums most affected by these claims,\nis that the risks of action are overestimated and the risks of inaction are\nunderestimated. But most important for me is that we owe it to our proud\ntradition of museums serving the public interest to see where something is\nwrong and take steps to set it right.\n23 Hugh Eakin, \u2018The great giveback\u2019, New York Times, 26 January 2013, http://www.nytimes.\ncom/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-great-giveback.html  IV\nMANAGEMENT\nAND PROTECTION  11. The Possibilities and Perils\nof Heritage Management\nMichael F. Brown\nAfter two decades of spirited debate about the fate of cultural heritage in\na shrinking, commodifying world, a few things seem settled. One is that\nthe unsanctioned appropriation of cultural assets by outsiders is unjust\nand unethical, especially when undertaken by a more powerful group. It\nperpetrates an economic injustice because the stewards of an ancient song,\nart form, or useful element of traditional knowledge are denied whatever\nprofits those cultural resources may accrue in the marketplace. Worse still,\nthe act of tearing cultural elements from their original context may change\ntheir meaning, even to those who created them. When the source community\nis an embattled minority, the resulting distortion is especially damaging.\nMany critics of cultural appropriation hoped that the framework of\nintellectual property (IP) law could be modified to curb such injustices.\nIP law\u2019s attraction was that it was already in place as a global system\nwith well-established precedents. The prospect of co-opting international\ncopyright and patent laws, often portrayed as engines of cultural theft,\nhad a transgressive appeal to those who campaign for robust heritage-\nprotection policies. Yet aside from a few modest improvements here and\nthere, IP has proven to be a fickle ally. Patents and copyrights are time-\nlimited forms of protection. Eventually their term expires, and they revert\nto the public domain, where they are available to anyone. This time-limited\nquality is objectionable to source communities that wish to shield their\nintellectual and cultural property forever. IP\u2019s transformation of sacred\n\u00a9 Michael F. Brown, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.11 172 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nforms of human expression into the language of property often offends the\npeople it is ostensibly trying to help.\nThe multiple deficiencies of an IP-based model have led the heritage-\nprotection movement to cast about for more promising frameworks. This\nhas fuelled growing interest in so-called \u2018geographical indications\u2019 as a way\nto defend local traditions. Closely related to this is the emergence of formal\ncertifications of virtue. These consist of administrative structures that\ndesignate something \u2013 a building, an art style, a craft, a genre of traditional\nmusic, a ritual \u2013 as meriting protected status because of its transcendent\ncultural importance. An obvious example of the latter is UNESCO\u2019s system\nfor identifying and certifying World Heritage Sites.1\nLegal experiments in heritage management that have been implemented\nto date tend to follow a similar script. They inevitably give expression to\nwhat can be called the \u2018administrative mind\u2019. The greatest student of the\nadministrative mind was Max Weber (1864-1920), the German sociologist\nwhose analysis of bureaucratic logic remains a touchstone for subsequent\nwork in the field. In the highly rationalised world of bureaucratic\nadministrators, Weber observed, problems are dealt with by carefully\ndefining their properties, establishing fixed rules for dealing with them,\nsubdividing authority among trained experts, and doing everything\npossible to squeeze awkward exceptions into existing procedural categories.\nSystems of this sort have become nearly universal because they manage\ncomplex systems predictably and, often enough, efficiently. What works\nwell when manufacturing widgets in a factory, however, swerves toward\nabsurdity when applied to more subjective dimensions of human life. A\nfamiliar example is the current enthusiasm for auditing the performance\nof university professors. Asked to judge teaching ability or scholarly merit\nin a precise way, administrators resort to dubious metrics of success in the\nname of objectivity. Even more vexing problems arise when attempting to\nmanage something as elusive as culture in the name of protection.\nConsider the following case which, although hypothetical, closely\ntracks emerging strategies to protect traditional crafts in many parts of\nthe world. Let us say that a nation such as India or Ecuador or Kenya\nhas a distinctive, localised, artisanal textile industry of some renown.\nThe national government wants to protect this industry from imitators,\n1 On certificates of virtue, see Michael F. Brown, \u2018A Tale of Three Buildings: Certifying\nVirtue in the New Moral Economy\u2019, American Ethnologist, 37(4), 2010, pp. 741-52. The Possibilities and Perils of Heritage Management 173\nespecially industrial firms that can easily appropriate traditional designs.\nTo accomplish this, the government creates a geographical indication\nunique to that tradition, such that no outsider can claim to make \u2018X fabric\u2019\nor even \u2018X-style fabric\u2019 without violating national law. So far, so good.\nFor this law to have teeth, the government must define several things\nwith great precision. First, what is X fabric? In other words, what are the\nboundaries of its design palette, raw materials, thread count, and the like?\nNext, what are the boundaries of the production zone protected by the new\ngeographical indication? Within that formally defined area, who will be\nrecognised as a certified artisan? Who will do the certifying? How much\nof the cost of administering the certification system will be passed along to\nthe producers themselves?\nOne can readily imagine various unintended consequences of this scheme\ndespite its apparent simplicity. The smallest producers may lack the financial\nresources or literacy skills to file the relevant forms and pay the inevitable\nfees, thus forcing them to merge with larger, better-established producers\nwho have already achieved certification. Innovative artisans pushing the\nboundaries of an official style may find their legitimacy questioned by\nmore conservative producers, risking loss of certification. Over time, such\nrigidity could turn a lively tradition into an inert museum-piece. As Winston\nChurchill once said of art, \u2018without innovation, it is a corpse\u2019.\nA growing roster of news stories and case studies shows that\nmy hypothetical example only begins to inventory the unintended\nconsequences that may arise from the application of the administrative\nmind to the challenge of protecting heritage. In 2009, for example, a noisy\ndispute broke out between Bolivia and Peru over a costume worn by\nMiss Peru in the Miss Universe Pageant. In the portion of the competition\ndevoted to each nation\u2019s folklore, Miss Peru crossed the stage dressed in a\ncostume linked to La Diablada (\u2018Dance of the Devils\u2019), which is performed\nin the Andean altiplano region shared by Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. It\nhappens, however, that Bolivia\u2019s version of the dance \u2013 specifically, the\nversion performed in the town of Oruro \u2013 has been certified by UNESCO\nas a \u2018Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\u2019. For\nreasons known only to UNESCO, the same dance as performed in Peru and\nChile lacks such certification. Thus Bolivia, which sees the designation as\nan important draw for international tourism, protested that by wearing the\ncostume of La Diablada, Miss Peru had pilfered its national patrimony. The\ncolourful scrimmage between Andean nations echoes an earlier dispute 174 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nbetween China and South Korea over stewardship of the Duanwu Festival,\ncelebrated in the fifth lunar month in both countries.2\nAnother example is provided by the American Indian Arts and Crafts\nAct (1990), a US law with the straightforward goal of protecting consumers\nfrom false claims that a given piece of artwork has been created by a\nNative American. The law says that for a work to be legally portrayed\nas Indian-made, the artist must be an enrolled member of a federally- or\nstate-recognised tribe or Alaska Native community. The doctrine of tribal\nsovereignty that applies in the United States, however, gives tribes great\nlatitude in their enrolment practices. Some are expansive in their standards,\nothers quite restrictive. The result is that certain artists widely regarded\nas Native American by fellow Native Americans cannot advertise their\nwork as Indian-made, whereas others with more tenuous links to Native\nAmerican society are free to do so. Admittedly, these problems arise around\nthe edges of an otherwise effective law, but they illustrate the difficulties\nthat arise when cultural definitions \u2013 in this case, of tribal membership \u2013\nbecome concretised in formal bureaucratic practice.3 More troubling still,\nthe law is virtually powerless in the face of products that imitate Native\nAmerican art but make no explicit claim of Native origin. A morally\ncomplex instance of this would be the inexpensive \u2018Southwestern-style\u2019\nrugs made by indigenous Zapotec weavers in Mexico, which turn up with\ngreat frequency in Native American arts shops in the United States, where\nthey compete with more expensive rugs made by Navajo weavers.\nIn the arena of traditional music, the ethnomusicologist Javier Le\u00f3n has\ndocumented the effects of formal certification on Peruvian musicians of\nAfrican descent. In 2001, Peru\u2019s National Institute of Culture declared an\ninstrument called the caj\u00f3n to be the \u2018Cultural Patrimony of the Nation\u2019.\nAs the name implies, the caj\u00f3n is a wooden box that has long been used\nas a percussion instrument by Afroperuvian musicians. Whether the caj\u00f3n\nis unique to Peru is disputed, although exposure to Peru\u2019s version of the\ninstrument has unquestionably led to its recent adoption by performing\nartists in Spain, Cuba, and Mexico. Peru\u2019s claim on the instrument has\nvarious motivations: national pride, the possible benefits to cultural\n2 Matt Moffet and Robert Kozak, \u2018In this spat between Bolivia and Peru, the details\nare in the devils\u2019, Wall Street Journal, 21 August 2009, http://online.wsj.com/article/\nSB125081309502848049.html.

The Possibilities and Perils of Heritage Management 175\ntourism, and, according to Le\u00f3n, the attraction of \u2018reaping any revenue\nthat such ownership might yield\u2019.4 One comes away from his study with\nthe sense that declaring the instrument to be an item of national patrimony\nhas produced as much divisiveness as pride among musicians by fostering\ndisputes over whose use of the caj\u00f3n is more authentic. In a similar analysis\nof policies designed to protect the musical heritage of the Seto minority\ngroup in Estonia, Kristin Kuutma concludes that the \u2018discursive impact of\nthe concept and perspective of intangible heritage paves a battleground\nof celebration and contestation among those entangled in the process of\nheritage production\u2019.5\nThe administrative mind is not the only source of trouble when heritage\nis redefined as a resource amenable to bureaucratic supervision. Equally\nvexing is the role of the state. With few exceptions, nation states consider\nthemselves the proper stewards of heritage resources found within their\nborders, a premise that the charters of organisations such as UNESCO are\nobliged to honour. Yet the state\u2019s interests and those of internal cultural\ncommunities often diverge. In the interest of national unity, the state may\nchoose to emphasise some aspects of heritage and suppress others. States\nmay wish to promote certain traditions and heritage sites because they\nattract tourists, whereas local communities may value a way of life that\nresidents see as irreconcilable with an ever-increasing number of visitors.\nMore often than not, state institutions such as national museums and\narchives exercise control over heritage resources in ways that are deeply\nresented by source communities \u2013 in recent years prompting calls for the\n\u2018liberation\u2019 of culture from the iron grip of distant bureaucrats.\nMore subtle but no less profound implications of state insertion into\nlocal heritage practices have been documented by Lorraine Aragon and\nJames Leach in their research on Indonesia\u2019s efforts to implement laws that\nshield traditional arts from exploitation by outsiders. Among their findings\nis that \u2018bureaucrats\u2019 best-intentioned legal plans do not easily encompass\nartists\u2019 complex aims for art production processes and transgenerational\nreciprocity\u2019.6 In other words by reframing local heritage in international\n4 J avier F.

Consider, for instance, the Pelourinho\nneighbourhood of Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which was declared a World\nHeritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. The anthropologist John Collins has\nassessed the process by which this former red-light district and its primarily\nAfrobrazilian residents were converted into national patrimony. In order to\nconform to the state\u2019s idea of acceptable heritage, those inhabitants have\nbeen subjected to coercive government reform efforts. Collins finds that\n\u2018the Bahian state arbitrates \u201ccorrect\u201d markers of ethnic identity and national\nhistory that qualify bearers for political rights while residents who exhibit\nincorrect behaviours face exile on Salvador\u2019s periphery\u2019.7\nDifferent concerns are voiced by residents of another World Heritage Site,\nthe mud-brick city of Djenn\u00e9 in Mali. The rigorous preservation protocol\ndeveloped by UNESCO prevents the people of Djenn\u00e9 from altering the\nstructure or appearance of their houses in any way. Those who wish to\nincrease the size of rooms or renovate them to accommodate plumbing\nand modern appliances are prohibited from doing so. The inevitable\nfrustrations seem to be turning citizens against the tourism-promoting\nauthenticity from which only a few derive direct benefits.8\nI could continue piling up examples of what Lisa Breglia, in a study of\nlocal attitudes toward Mayan archaeological sites in Mexico, memorably\ncalls \u2018monumental ambivalence\u2019, but the contours of the problem should\nnow be readily apparent.9 Even thoughtfully designed heritage-protection\nlaws and policies tend to be flawed affairs. Their imperfections arise from\ntwo sources. First, most are creations of the nation state, whose interests\nare likely to diverge from those of subcultural communities struggling to\nmaintain a degree of distinctiveness. Even when the state is not aggressively\ntrying to redefine local cultures and heritage sites to suit a nationalist\nnarrative, a predilection for centralised control is likely to put too much\n7 J ohn Collins, \u2018\u201cBut What if I Should Need to Defecate in Your Neighborhood, Madame?\u201d:\nEmpire, Redemption, and the \u201cTradition of the Oppressed\u201d in a Brazilian World\nHeritage Site\u2019, Cultural Anthropology, 23(2), 2008, p. 312.\n8 Neil MacFarquhar, \u2018Mali City rankled by rules for life in spotlight\u2019, New York Times, 9\nJanuary 2011, A4, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/world/africa/09mali.html\n9 Lisa Breglia, Monumental Ambivalence: The Politics of Heritage (Austin, TX: University of\nTexas Press, 2006). The Possibilities and Perils of Heritage Management 177\npower in the hands of credentialed experts far removed from the everyday\ninteractions that keep heritage alive.\nEqually problematic is the transformative power of law itself. As\nvarious legal scholars have noted, by its nature law imposes uniformity. In\ncontrast, cultural heritage embodies flexibility and highly contingent ways\nof doing things, both of which are anathema to law\u2019s search for procedural\nregularity. Indeed, a great irony of the heritage-protection movement is\nthat it advances globally uniform approaches to the defence of heritage\nsaid to be threatened by globalisation. Law not only encodes meanings, it\nretools them in ways that change social practice.\nAn example that comes readily to mind is the impact of the concept of\n\u2018repatriation\u2019 encoded in a celebrated US law called the Native American\nGraves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, better known by the\nacronym NAGPRA. NAGPRA provides for the return of human remains\nand objects of religious patrimony to Native American communities from\nwhich they were taken, subject to specific conditions. Ethnographic studies\nof the repatriation process have shown that the law has in some cases\ntransformed Native American notions of cultural ownership: tribes now\nregard themselves as the proper owners of objects that once belonged to\nindividuals, families, or sub-tribal units. This is not necessarily a bad thing\n\u2013 surely it is preferable to having sacred objects of doubtful provenance\nremain in the hands of museums \u2013 but it should not be mistaken for the\npreservation of tradition. It has changed that tradition in innumerable\nways. Moreover, NAGPRA\u2019s success in rectifying historic wrongs has\ninspired supporters of indigenous rights to demand the \u2018repatriation\u2019 of\nintangible heritage \u2013 recordings of songs, photographs of rituals, digital\nimages of indigenous art \u2013 to source communities. In a digital age,\nhowever, intangible heritage does not answer to the logic of the material\nobjects covered by the terms of NAGPRA. Digitised heritage may reside in\nthousands of places simultaneously. It can be diced into partial elements\nand distributed instantly around the world. Recovery, reassembly, and\nsequestration of these scattered shards is an unlikely prospect, however\nmuch we might wish it. Leakage of the legal concept of repatriation into\na domain where it doesn\u2019t readily apply has sometimes made it harder to\nfind effective solutions to the circulation of elements of cultural heritage\nover which source communities have long sought control.10\n10 On the complex interaction between law and culture, see especially Naomi Mezey, \u2018Law\nas Culture\u2019, Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities, 13, 2001, pp. 35-67. 178 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nTwenty years of watching the world struggle with questions of heritage\nand its preservation have drawn me to the tragic view of human ambition\nembraced by the literary critic Terry Eagleton. As Eagleton puts it, \u2018Tragic\nprotagonists \u2026 acknowledge that flawedness is part of the texture of things,\nand that roughness and imprecision are what make human life work\u2019.11\nHowever noble our desires, however much we strive to advance the cause\nof justice, the outcome of this human effort will be marked by imperfection.\nSuch a perspective need not produce ethical paralysis, but it does call for\nhumility and a willingness to change course when evidence warrants. A\nwillingness to laugh at human folly helps, too.\nCultural heritage, whether embodied in places or stories, is a shape-\nshifting, protean thing whose contours may be contested even by those\nwho create it. For centuries the powerful have tried to define its shape and\nthe uses to which it is put. Now that it has become a commodity, the stakes\nhave risen further. The cultural heritage of formerly isolated communities\nhas gained value in markets hungry for novelty. This coincides with a\ndemocratic opening that in many parts of the world has empowered\nminority communities to reassert their cultural distinctiveness. The\nresulting convergence of economic interests and identity politics \u2013 to say\nnothing of the spiritual idioms in which heritage-protection demands are\noften couched \u2013 makes for an ethical landscape of great complexity. So\nwhat is to be done?\nOne useful step would be to revisit the broader context that gave rise to\nthe current passion for protecting heritage. The expansion and tightening\nof global IP rules that began in the 1990s sparked a moral panic about\ncultural theft. The response has been an effort to defend heritage with\nnew laws that sometimes outstrip copyright and patent law in the degree\nto which they commodify culture and downsize the public domain. Is\nemulating the worst features of IP the best way to hold it at bay? Perhaps it\nis time to re-energise public efforts to roll back expansive IP laws. After all,\nif corporations find it harder to privatise public knowledge, they will focus\ntheir acquisitive attention elsewhere. A promising tactic to undermine\npredatory IP law has been employed in India, where the creation of a\npublicly accessible Traditional Knowledge Digital Library has made it\nmore difficult for bioprospectors to secure patents on products derived\nfrom Ayurvedic medicine. IP law says that patents may only be issued for\n11 Terry Eagleton, After Theory (New York: Basic Books, 2003), p. 186. The Possibilities and Perils of Heritage Management 179\nproducts that demonstrate novelty. By putting ancient medicines in the\npublic domain, India pre-emptively refutes claims that pharmaceutical\nproducts based on Indian tradition qualify as \u2018new\u2019.\nOperating on the fringe of the heritage-protection movement are\nscrappy outsiders whose creativity gives me hope for the future. Among\nthe best is Mukurtu (www.mukurtu.org), a not-for-profit group of\nanthropologists, programmers, and indigenous thinkers who have created\narchival software that allows communities to preserve, study, and use their\nown digital heritage. The program\u2019s architecture can be customised to\nserve a community\u2019s changing needs and preferences. Mukurtu isn\u2019t a total\nsolution, nor does it aspire to be; this is one of its strengths. Diversity sustains\ndiversity; uniformity stifles it. The steadily growing list of independent\nmuseums and cultural centres in the United States, Canada, Australia, and\nelsewhere is a hopeful sign of local resistance to the imposition of a single\nset of global solutions. This isn\u2019t to say that international treaties such\nas the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage,\napproved by UNESCO in 2003, cannot serve a useful purpose.12 They focus\nattention on heritage and, one hopes, help to mobilise public enthusiasm\nfor its preservation. But to the extent that international agreements provide\njustification for top-down policies and centralised management, they may\ndo more harm than good.\nAn unavoidable lesson of recent experience is that cultural heritage\nis most likely to thrive when shielded from the administrative mind\u2019s\nmanagerial impulse and the suffocating embrace of formal law. When\ncontrols are warranted, they should be developed by source communities\nrather than state bureaucrats. The state\u2019s remit should be limited to providing\nadvice, financial support, and appropriate enforcement mechanisms for\nlocally created controls. Such an approach honours culture\u2019s dual identity\nas a verb as well as a noun. For cultural heritage to survive, it must be\ncultured by its proper stewards.\n12 For the text of the 2003 Convention see http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17\n716&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html  12. Values in World Heritage Sites\nGeoffrey Belcher\n1. Introduction\nIt is helpful to begin with an explanation of the concept and evolution\nof \u2018World Heritage\u2019 as adopted by UNESCO, the United Nations\nEnvironmental, Social and Cultural Organisation which is \u2018building peace\nin the minds of men and women\u2019.\nIn the late 1950s, after the building of the Aswan Dam flooded the Nile\nValley, destroying many ancient sites, international concern about places\nof world significance focused on Egypt. Among the country\u2019s countless\nhistoric sites, the most famous was the temple of Abu Simbel, with its four\ngiant statues of the great pharaoh Rameses II. As a result of the concerns\nraised by the flood, international aid was gathered to fund an ambitious\nscheme to cut the temple\u2019s stonework and relocate it to higher ground\naway from the rising waters. The archaeological and aesthetic legitimacy\nof this action may have been questioned in subsequent years, but the event\ndid ignite a process that eventually led, via an initiative in the United States,\nto the establishment in 1972 of the UNESCO Convention Concerning the\nProtection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.1\nThe World Heritage list was readily drawn up in these early years to\ninclude the most obvious places of world interest such as the Taj Mahal in\nIndia, the Mesa Verde National Park in the USA, and the Galapagos Islands\n1 See http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13055&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_\nSECTION=201.html\n\u00a9 Geoffrey Belcher, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.12 182 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nin Ecuador. As the idea of the list has evolved, a greater variety of Sites has\nbeen added, whilst the process of inscription and management of these\nWorld Heritage Sites has become much more rigorous.\nToday, a Site can only be inscribed on the list if the World Heritage\nCommittee agrees that it meets one or more of the ten criteria listed in the\nWorld Heritage Convention Operational Guidelines (2005),2 which can be\nparaphrased as follows:\n(i) To represent a masterpiece of human creative genius.\n(ii) To exhibit an important interchange of human values.\n(iii) To bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition.\n(iv) To be an outstanding example of a type of building.\n(v) To be an outstanding example of traditional human settlement.\n(vi) To be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions.\n(vii) To contain superlative natural phenomena.\n(viii) To be outstanding examples representing major stages of Earth\u2019s history.\n(ix) To be outstanding examples representing significant on-going ecological\nand biological processes.\n(x) To contain the most important and significant natural habitats.\nThe first six of these criteria may be considered to apply to cultural Sites, and\nthe remainder to natural Sites, although some Sites are in the dual category\nof \u2018cultural landscape\u2019. As we will see, UNESCO have broadened their\napproach to inscription over the last few years, and as a consequence the\nWorld Heritage list now includes \u2018properties\u2019 of hugely varying character,\nfrom places of great architectural beauty such as the Taj Mahal to places\nlinked with significant historical events, including Auschwitz-Birkenau\nin Poland and Hiroshima in Japan. Natural Sites, meanwhile, include\nplaces ranging from the Great Barrier Reef and Shark Bay in Australia to\nYellowstone National Park in the USA.\nParticipating nation states (State Parties) may put forward one cultural\nand one natural Site for World Heritage status annually, but the UNESCO\nConservation Committee\u2019s selection process is by no means straightforward.\nThe United Kingdom has had to withdraw nominations for Charles\nDarwin\u2019s Cultural Landscape in Kent, and Wearmouth and Jarrow in the\ncounty of Tyne and Wear (associated with the Venerable Bede) in the last\nfew years because the cases, which relied strongly on association with an\n2 See http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide05-en.pdf Values in World Heritage Sites 183\nimportant historical figure, were not considered robust enough. At present\nthe number of UK locations listed as World Heritage Sites remains at 28.\nThe individual characteristics of each Site mean that their management\nvaries and may involve a wide range of issues. At present UNESCO World\nHeritage Sites have little status in national heritage-protection legislation,\nand as a result management plans, which are a UNESCO requirement for\nthe protection of the Sites, have only a limited statutory basis. Moreover,\nmany Sites contain private land and enterprises, and so must include\nelements of a business plan. These issues will be discussed further below.\n2. The Wider Value of Heritage\nThe modern appreciation of the value of historic sites can be traced back to\nthe Renaissance, when architects began to adapt classical ruins in order to\ndevelop new architectural styles. Subsequently, in the eighteenth century,\nthe Grand Tour of Italian and Greek archaeological sites became de rigueur\nfor young aristocrats. Unfortunately, plundering of artefacts by these\neighteenth-century tourists was rife, but their experiences also encouraged\nthe use of classical elements in the \u2018Palladian\u2019 style, which produced\nbuildings of great elegance. The nineteenth century, meanwhile, saw the\nintroduction of a more formal concern with the protection of the historical\nlegacy, and the founding of the Society for the Protection of Ancient\nBuildings represents a milestone in this regard. Throughout the heritage\nworld, a more rational approach was increasingly taken to the recording\nof historic sites and objects both above and below the ground. In the case\nof field archaeology, this meant the establishment in the early twentieth\ncentury of highly rigorous excavation procedures designed to prevent the\ncavalier treasure hunting and consequent destruction of the historic context\nof such \u2018finds\u2019 that had been widespread since the eighteenth century.\nIn Britain, the value of historic buildings was further recognised with\na number of studies, such as the on-going \u2018Survey of London\u2019 (founded in\nthe 1890s), which documented buildings of historic interest, often shortly\nbefore they were destroyed to make way for development. By the twentieth\ncentury, historic towns had become an accepted part of the British national\nculture, although without any specific designation. Ironically their\nrecognition at an international level in the Baedeker guides (founded in\n1827) led to some of them (Bath, Norwich, Exeter) being targeted by the\nLuftwaffe in the early bombing raids of World War II. It appears that these 184 Cultural Heritage Ethics\ninitial raids were aimed at places of cultural rather than military significance,\nindicating the Nazis\u2019 assumption that heritage occupied a special place in\nthe British psyche.\nIn the wake of the Second World War, innovations in town planning\nin the UK were driven by a generation sick of the restrictions of war, fed\non the 1930s dream of a \u2018modern\u2019 life of convenience and leisure. Their\napproach to town planning was shaped by the \u2018Brave New World\u2019 visions\nof Le Corbusier\u2019s designs for new cities, including Paris, as well as the\nmore prosaic example of the \u2018Arts and Crafts\u2019 Garden Cities of Welwyn and\nLetchworth. The establishment of the Town Planning Act in 1948 introduced\nthe idea of \u2018development plans\u2019, which aimed at holistic redevelopment\nto celebrate the post-war age. Unfortunately, the first development\nplans were disappointingly dull, being based on the narrow concerns of\nroad widening and other service considerations, rather than any more\ngeneral vision for an improved way of life. As a result, many of the \u2018new\nenvironments\u2019 created in the 1950s and 1960s were a failure \u2013 the tower\nblocks of the period, for example, are now recognised to be unsuitable for\neveryday life in the UK, while the destruction of familiar town centres had\na negative impact on quality of life. These failures gave rise to a growing\npopular interest in the wider historic environment, and there was a\nwidespread reaction against the unwanted changes. Groups of enthusiasts\nsaved rashly-closed railway branch lines, canals and the like, and in the\nlate 1960s the growing concern for the country\u2019s historic environment was\nacknowledged by central government with the introduction of the 1967\nCivic Amenities Act, which brought in the concept of \u2018Conservation Areas\u2019.\nThe first such areas were based on historic town centres and consisted of\ntight groups of historic buildings. However, the success of this new concept\nled to its being extended to cover wider areas after 1973 when the idea of\n\u2018the familiar and cherished local scene\u2019 \u2013 that is areas not just made up of\nhistoric buildings \u2013 was accepted as a basis for designation.3 Just as the\nlate 1940s ushered in a new optimism about a \u2018Brave New World\u2019 of town\nplanning, the 1970s, despite being \u2018the decade that taste forgot\u2019, produced\na raft of Conservation Areas which safeguarded many town centres against\nthe rampant redevelopment that had decimated traditional places even\nmore extensively than the Blitz.\nThis was in keeping with the general re-evaluation of many aspects of\neveryday life that took place in the 1970s. The popular television programme\n3 D epartment of the Environment Planning Circular 46/73. Values in World Heritage Sites 185\n\u2018The Good Life\u2019 represented a new-found appreciation for traditionally-\ngrown food. The Arts and Crafts movement resurfaced with a revival of\nhand-made goods and the beginnings of what we would now call \u2018localism\u2019,\nsomething also apparent in the resurgence of markets, full of local and\nspecialist produce. Disillusionment with bland, industrial products not only\ncontributed to the emergence of interest in \u2018classic cars\u2019, but also led the Ford\nMotor Company to produce \u2018customisable\u2019 Cortinas which offered so many\npermutations that it was almost as if no two cars were the same \u2013 although\nthey all rusted in the same way. It all seemed to represent the pursuit of\nstability and lasting values in a rapidly changing world.\nIn the 1980s, the increasingly widespread Conservation Areas became\nvery fashionable, with estate agents in particular promoting them as\ndesirable places to live. Local Conservation Area Advisory Committees\nwere set up to give the local community a say in their management,\nalthough most members seem to have been primarily concerned with\nprotecting their enhanced property values, rather than with championing\naesthetic and historic considerations.\nThe decade also saw a revival of \u2018cultural tourism\u2019. Package holidays in\nthe Spanish sun were no longer enough for many, and instead travellers\nincreasingly sought out destinations that were of historical interest. It is\nunclear whether tourists were particularly attracted to World Heritage\nSites at this stage, but many Sites have certainly been branded as tourist\ndestinations in recent years.\nWith such a swell of public concern and interest in heritage it was\ninevitable that some form of categorisation and stability would eventually\nbecome necessary. This process is illustrated by the case of the market for\n\u2018classic cars\u2019 (only defined as such in the 1970s), in which prices reached\ndizzy heights in the 1990s, before crashing. Cars with a historical association,\nsuch as those that had won the Le Mans race, had a special value, but given\nthe probability that such a machine would have gone through several body\nand engine changes over the course of time, the meaning of this association\nwas open to question, and court cases were even fought over the right to\ndisplay a chassis plate with the \u2018historic\u2019 numbers of a revered car. It was\ntime to rationalise the position, and this ushered in a more widespread\nconcern for authenticity and integrity, as illustrated by the rise of the\nso-called \u2018oily-rag\u2019 approach to classic car maintenance.\nWith the rise of interest in classic cars from the 1970s, concours d\u2019elegance\nmeetings rapidly generated a breed of restoration that owed more to gloss\nthan originality. Restoration became more \u2018re-creation\u2019 at the expense of a 186 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nvehicle\u2019s patina of age. The issues are fascinating. If a vehicle is to be made\nroadworthy it must have appropriate tyres, and inevitably these will be\nmodern since tyres produced thirty years ago or more will have decayed\n(indeed, there have been tragic cases where fastidious owners suffered\nfatal accidents caused by blow-outs of their ancient rubber tyres). Brake\nsystems have similar problems: whilst the risks of using an out-dated\nbraking system may be acceptable in the case of a veteran car doing at\nbest 30 miles per hour, they cannot be accepted in the case of an E-type\nJaguar which can reach 150 miles per hour. Modern traffic is much faster\nand much busier than in the classic cars\u2019 heyday, and so it also makes sense\nto carry out upgrades on suspension, cooling systems and so-on, to create\na vehicle happy with the modern environment. With all the underpinnings\nupgraded, why not make use of modern paints to improve the finish? A\nclean engine bay is nice, but why not chromium-plate the air filters to add\na touch of sparkle? It is easy to see how the glossy look-a-likes at the Pebble\nBeach concours in California were conceived, but a backlash against this\nmodernising approach was inevitable.\nThis backlash has taken the form of a strong drive in the last few years\nto recognise the qualities of unrestored cars which display a patina of time.\nAs outlined above, there will always be compromises, including the use of\nmodern fuels and oils, but the use of an oily rag to give cover to rusty metal\nand keep parts lubricated can keep a vehicle on the road with a minimum\nof \u2018restoration\u2019. This \u2018oily-rag\u2019 treatment of classic cars is now increasingly\npopular, ensuring that the originality (admittedly still a difficult concept)\nof the machine is accepted and its completeness is such that a simple clean\nwill enable it to function as it was designed to. After all, in some cases any\nintervention into the historic fabric of a vehicle would destroy not only its\npatina of age, but an essential connection to the car\u2019s history. The Austin-\nHealey that was involved in the tragic accident at the 1955 Le Mans race\nwhich killed more than eighty people was recently sold for an enormous\nsum, despite being in poor condition. (Although in this case the car had,\nin fact, been repaired immediately after the accident, so its \u2018historic\u2019 fabric\nassociated with the race had already been modified.) A Frazer-Nash which\nhad spent seventy years resting on the bottom of a Swiss lake also attracted\nan enormous bid, despite being little more than a rusty fragment.\nThese sales point to perhaps the most interesting aspect of the historic\nvehicle world \u2013 its active marketplace and the way considerations of\noriginality and historical association affect a car\u2019s market value. Whilst Values in World Heritage Sites 187\na thorough restoration of a classic car including upgrades to achieve\nmodern driving standards still attracts a premium, prices for unrestored\nvehicles capable of \u2018oily-rag\u2019 treatment are increasingly approaching\nsuch premiums. Evidently \u2018historical association\u2019 carries considerable\nimportance in the valuation of classic cars, whereas this aspect appears to\nbe much less significant in the evaluation of potential Sites in the World\nHeritage context.\n3. Values in World Heritage Sites\nThis process of rationalisation and identification of values has also found\nits way into the arena of World Heritage. All proposals for new World\nHeritage Sites must now be accompanied by a \u2018Statement of Outstanding\nUniversal Value\u2019 (SoOUV). Such statements are also being prepared for\nSites already inscribed.\nThis recognition of \u2018outstanding universal value\u2019 means that Sites are\nseen as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole, and as such\ndeserve to be protected and transmitted to future generations. The concept\nof OUV now underpins the whole World Heritage Convention and all\nactivities associated with inscribed properties. The 1998 Global Strategy\nmeeting in Amsterdam proposed a definition of OUV as \u2018an outstanding\nresponse to issues of universal nature common to or addressed by all\ncultures\u2019.4 OUV means cultural and/or natural significance which is so\nexceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common\nimportance for present and future generations of all humanity. At the 2005\nUNESCO Special Expert Meeting in Kazan on the concept of OUV it was\nput forward that \u2018definition and application of OUV are made by people\nand will be subject to evolution over time\u2019, thereby recognising that the\nprocess of nomination for World Heritage is taking place in the context of\na continually broadening definition of cultural heritage. The idea of fixed\nreference points over time is not necessarily possible nor even desirable. A\nreshaping of cultural heritage is taking place in every country and is linked\ndirectly or indirectly to the application of the World Heritage Convention.\nThis means that over the years since the first inscriptions, new types of\ncultural heritage have been recognised, nominated for inscription and\n4 R eport of the World Heritage Global Strategy Natural and Cultural Heritage Expert\nMeeting, 25-29 March 1998, Amsterdam, p. 18, http://whc.unesco.org/archive/amsterdam\n98.pdf 188 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nin many cases inscribed on the list. What remains fixed are the criteria\naccepted by the World Heritage Committee as justification of OUV at the\ntime of inscription. Retrospective preparation of a SoOUV must therefore\nbe undertaken according to those past criteria, and so the work involves a\ncertain element of \u2018going back in time\u2019.\nIn sum, the SoOUV sets out not individual qualities, but the totality of\nqualities that together give a property OUV. The SoOUV thus overarches\nthe whole management and conservation of a property, since management\nof each Site must be focused on sustaining the OUV for which it was\ninscribed. The SoOUV is also the essential reference point for:\nMonitoring\nPeriodic reporting\nPotential reactive monitoring\nPossible danger listing (in 2012 Liverpool and the Tower of\nLondon were placed on the Danger List by UNESCO)\nDeletion (Dresden was removed from the World Heritage list\nby UNESCO in 2005)\nThe Statement of Outstanding Universal Value is therefore of great\nbenefit to the relevant State Party and to all stakeholders involved in the\nmanagement of a World Heritage property. It not only facilitates a clear\nunderstanding of what has been inscribed on the list and why it has OUV,\nbut also gives direction to management of the Site by indicating which of\nthe property\u2019s attributes need to be maintained in order to sustain its OUV.\n4. The Content of the Statement of Outstanding Value\nThe SoOUV should contain the following:\nA brief synthesis including a summary description and summary of values and\nattributes:\n(i) Criteria (the UNESCO criteria according to which the Site is inscribed,\nsee above).\n(ii) The Authenticity of the Site.\n(iii) The Integrity of the Site.\n(iv) Management demanded to sustain the OUV through an overall\nframework and long-term expectations. Values in World Heritage Sites 189\n(i) Criteria\nThe criteria listed earlier in this paper are the current versions. The use\nof the criteria has only been mandatory since 2002, and in the case of\nsome early Sites (43%), nominations were made by State Parties without\nreference to any criteria. Moreover, it is important to recognise that these\ncriteria have changed and evolved over time and, as mentioned previously,\nretrospective statements of OUV must be made against those criteria in\noperation at the time of inscription.\nUNESCO have subtly modified the cultural criteria several times since\n1977.5 For example, in 1977 criterion i was stated as \u2018represents a unique\nartistic or aesthetic achievement, a masterpiece of creative genius\u2019. By 1983\nthe \u2018or aesthetic\u2019 had been removed. Maritime Greenwich is an example of\ninscription under criterion i (inscribed 1997).\nThe evolution of criterion ii was more significant. In 1977 it read \u2018have\nexerted considerable influence over a span of time or within a cultural area\nof the world on subsequent developments in architecture, monumental\nsculpture, garden design and landscape design, related arts or human\nsettlements\u2019. By 1996 this had been changed to \u2018exhibit an important\ninterchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area\nof the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental\narts, town planning or landscape design\u2019. This effectively expanded\nthe criterion and opened the door to World Heritage Sites based on\ntechnological advances. Examples of inscription under criterion ii include\nthe Ruins of the Buddhist Vihara at Paharpur, Bangladesh (1985), and later\nthe Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works in Chile (2005) and the\nBlaenavon Industrial Landscape of south Wales (2003), both of which were\ninscribed under the revised version of the criterion.\nCriterion iii was also expanded. In 1977 it referred to Sites being\n\u2018unique, extremely rare, or of great antiquity\u2019, but by 1996 this had become\n\u2018bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or\nto a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared\u2019. Messa Verde\nNational Park was inscribed under the earlier criterion but the enlarged\nwording covering cultural landscapes, a testimony to evolving traditions,\nsaw the Stone Circles of Senegambia and Senegal inscribed in 2006.\n5 T he criteria are listed in full in the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for the\nImplementation of the World Heritage Convention. For full details of the various\nversions of the guidelines cited in this section see http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ 190 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nIn 1977 criterion iv required that Sites \u2018be among the most characteristic\nexamples of a type of structure, the type representing an important cultural,\nsocial, artistic, scientific, technological or industrial development\u2019. This\nwas tightened in 1996 to \u2018be an outstanding example of a type of building\nor architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates\na significant stage in human history\u2019. Examples of the changing Sites\ninscribed under criterion iv include the Silver Mines of Potosi, Bolivia\n(1987) and the Town Houses of Victor Horta, Belgium (2000).\nCriterion v stated in 1977 that a Site should \u2018be a characteristic example\nof a significant traditional style of architecture, method of construction, or\nhuman settlement that is fragile by nature or has become vulnerable under\nthe impact of irreversible socio-cultural or economic change\u2019. By 2005 this\nhad been limited to \u2018be an outstanding example of a traditional human\nsettlement, land use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture or\nhuman interaction with the environment especially when it has become\nvulnerable under the impact of irreversible change\u2019. The historic city of\nKairouan in Tunisia (1988) was inscribed under the earlier criterion, while\nthe Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila, Mexico\n(2006) were inscribed under the modified version.\nCriterion vi stated in 1980 that Sites should \u2018be directly or tangibly\nassociated with events or with ideas or beliefs of outstanding universal\nsignificance\u2019, altered in 2005 to \u2018be directly or tangibly associated with\nevents or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and\nliterary works of outstanding universal significance\u2019 \u2013 yet another opening\nup of a criterion.\n(ii) Authenticity\nThere is sometimes confusion between the concepts of authenticity and\nintegrity. Authenticity is the link between attributes and outstanding\nuniversal value. This link must be truthfully and credibly expressed on the\nbasis of verifiable sources of information.\nBefore 2005 the test of authenticity referred to four attributes: design,\nmaterial, workmanship and setting. That is, only tangible aspects of\nheritage were included. Since 2005, however, intangible heritage has been\nincluded in assessments of authenticity, so that the test now includes\nform and setting, materials and substance, use and function, traditions,\ntechniques and management systems, location and setting, language, spirit Values in World Heritage Sites 191\nand feeling. Thus a much broader range of attributes that might carry OUV\ncan be identified. This is a very significant shift away from the tangible.\nAs an example, the OUV of an urban area might be carried by the following\nattributes: structures, spatial plans, traditions and living communities, a\nsocio-economic whole working collaboratively. Authenticity relates to how\nwell these attributes reflect OUV, and can be compromised if the attributes\nare weak \u2013 if communities cease to thrive, buildings collapse or traditions\ndisappear. A statement of authenticity should therefore say whether the\nrelevant attributes are thriving, and convey their message credibly and\ntruthfully.\n(iii) Integrity\nThe concept of integrity can be applied to both natural and cultural\nproperties, although since 2005 it has only been applied to cultural\nproperties. Integrity is the completeness/intactness of the attributes that\ncarry OUV, a measure of the wholeness of the property. Are all the elements\nnecessary to express the property\u2019s OUV included within its boundaries?\nIs the property of adequate size to ensure the complete representation\nof the features and processes which convey the property\u2019s significance?\nDoes the property suffer adverse effects from development or neglect? A\nstatement of integrity needs to answer these questions, stating whether\nthe collection of attributes that carry OUV are all contained within the\nproperty\u2019s boundaries, that no parts have lost these attributes, and that the\nattributes are not under threat.\n(iv) Protection and Management\nThe attributes that convey OUV need to be maintained, conserved, managed\nand protected in order to sustain a property\u2019s OUV. Statements need to be\nset out demonstrating how this is to be achieved in both the long and the\nshort term.\n5. The Practice of Managing a World Heritage Site\nThe evolution of definitions, along with the widening of the criteria, has\nproduced a much more rational inscription process. However, while the\nconcept of OUV may appear straightforward, in practice the definitions 192 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nof concomitant values can prove difficult. For example, in the case of the\nMaritime Greenwich World Heritage Site, the historic tea clipper the Cutty\nSark, located at the heart of the Site, would seem to be highly significant and\ndeserving of Attribute of OUV status. This is especially the case given that\nthe ship is cherished locally, is recognised at a national level with its Grade\n1 listing, and is even known internationally as the last surviving clipper.\nHowever, despite the ship being an historic building on the statutory list,\nbecause it is movable, English Heritage, interpreting the UNESCO criteria,\nrefuse to support it as an Attribute of OUV.\n6. Management of World Heritage Sites\nWhile UNESCO, an international agency, is responsible for inscribing\nWorld Heritage Sites, responsibility for their management and protection\nlies with the nation states of the participating countries. In the United\nKingdom this role is undertaken by the central government\u2019s Department\nof Culture Media and Sport (DCMS). DCMS is advised by the UK branch\nof the International Council for Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), English\nHeritage and its equivalents in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nA prerequisite for inscription is the preparation and adoption of a World\nHeritage Site management plan. In most cases this is prepared locally by a\nsteering group consisting of local organisations and interests, with the help\nof national advisory bodies. Management plans have to be approved by the\nUNESCO Conservation Committee but this body\u2019s infrequent meetings\n(once every 6 months) and its consequent bulky agendas mean that full\ndiscussion of the plans for each Site is rare. However, UNESCO has also\nput in place a system of \u2018Periodic Reporting\u2019 which demands that each Site\nbe the subject of an assessment every 5 years. This assessment considers the\nstate of the Site and the management of its attributes in order to identify\nissues of concern. Where problems become significant in advance of this\nprocess, UNESCO acts swiftly by sending a delegation of inspectors to\nassess the situation. This can lead to a Site being placed on the \u2018World\nHeritage Sites in Danger List\u2019, as is currently the case with Liverpool in the\nUK. In extreme cases, where threats have been identified and no remedial\naction has been taken, UNESCO will remove a property from the World\nHeritage List, as recently happened with Dresden in Germany.\nThe preparation of a World Heritage Site management plan is a costly\nand specialist exercise (assessed by DCMS at \u00a320,000 in 2008). There is no\nfunding available from either UNESCO or DCMS, so the task and its costs Values in World Heritage Sites 193\nfall to the local steering group. Most UK Sites have a locally based, locally\nfunded coordinator who prepares and updates the plan.\n7. Political and Other Tensions\nAs a central government department, DCMS is subject to political oversight,\nand this can have a major impact upon the department\u2019s work in the heritage\nsector. During the 1980s the Tory administration under Margaret Thatcher\nsevered relations with UNESCO, and the relationship was only reinstated\nin 1997 when a Labour administration came to power. At a more local\nlevel, meanwhile, World Heritage Site steering groups are often chaired by\nlocal government councillors, and where central and local government are\nrepresented by different parties this can introduce a fundamental political\nrift. The situation becomes even more complex in those cities where\nthere is also an elected mayor: in London there are four World Heritage\nSites within the city, and the Mayor of London includes concern for their\nwellbeing in the London Plan. Thus there can be three different levels of\npolitical influence, and these are perhaps most strongly felt where there\nare issues of funding involved. Heritage of international standing may be\nperceived locally as irrelevant, and even regarded with hostility. The use\nof scarce local resources for its safeguarding may therefore be considered\nunimportant or even immoral compared with meeting the needs of local\npublic services. Fortunately there are sources of funding external to local\nbudgets which recognise such heritage. English Heritage and the other\nnational heritage organisations are in a position to offer grant aid, while\nthe Heritage Lottery Fund has proved very supportive of the UK World\nHeritage Sites, giving grants for a number of restoration projects.\nThe position of World Heritage Site coordinator is also an important\nconsideration. Within the twenty-eight UK Sites there are a variety of\narrangements, depending on the nature of the Site in question. Blenheim\nPalace, for example, is privately owned and so its management is undertaken\nthrough its own organisation, while the management of Hadrian\u2019s Wall has\nbeen taken to a sophisticated level by the establishment of a trust, funded\nby the fourteen Local Authorities and others which lie along its length.\nIn many cases, however, the coordinator is based within the Site\u2019s Local\nAuthority, often as part of the town planning department. While this may\nprovide some influence when dealing with planning applications, it also\nhas the disadvantage of tying the role to a professional service, possibly to\nthe detriment of a wider view. 194 Cultural Heritage Ethics\n8. Legislation and Administration\nThe only power UNESCO can exercise over World Heritage Sites is to\nremove them from the World Heritage List; their protection depends on\nlegislation adopted by the nation state. In the UK there is no system of\nprotection for World Heritage Sites operated at the central government\nlevel. Instead, most measures dealing with the wider historic environment\nhave effectively been delegated to the local level.\nThe UK has an established and sophisticated town planning administra-\ntion that controls development through the granting of planning permission.\nHistoric buildings are protected by their inclusion on a \u2018list\u2019 of buildings\nof special architectural or historic merit. \u2018Listed Building Consent\u2019 must be\nobtained for changes that affect the fabric of such buildings. Some build-\nings and structures can also be scheduled as \u2018ancient monuments\u2019 which\nrequire additional consent for any changes. In the case of historic areas,\nmeanwhile, Conservation Areas can be designated within which consent\nmust be sought for any demolition work. Further protection is afforded\non some individual issues such as the control of advertisements, and\nhighways issues, which can be of particular importance, are also mainly a\nresponsibility of the Local Authority.\nRecently there were moves in the UK to introduce the concept of a\n\u2018historic asset\u2019 throughout building and conservation legislation, in order\nto identify the key elements of a building or environment that might come\nunder threat from, for example, a development proposal. However, the Bill\nthat would have established this was abandoned in 2009, and instead the\nstatus quo remains. This means that the location of a development proposal\nwithin a World Heritage Site can be regarded as a \u2018material consideration\u2019\nwhen a planning application is being decided. To assist in the protection of\nthe UK\u2019s World Heritage Sites, Local Development Frameworks (previously\nLocal Plans) prepared by the Local Planning Authority can contain policies\nspecifically directed at their protection and enhancement.\n9. Some Conclusions\n\u2018Heritage\u2019 as a concept has become mainstream since the Second World\nWar, representing many values ranging from nostalgia to reminders of the\ndarker side of human nature. It can be a romantic notion and a blueprint\nfor regeneration. \u2018Heritage\u2019 has evolved over the last 40 years to cover the Values in World Heritage Sites 195\nmost prized works of human genius as well as the most beautiful natural\nplaces. It has also come to mean an appreciation of the lowly places that\nrepresent a familiar and cherished local scene. \u2018Heritage\u2019 is now seen as\ngoing beyond the tangible to include places of intangible heritage where\nsignificant living traditions survive.\nA hierarchy of assessments of heritage has evolved from the international\nthrough national to local levels. Each level has its own values, with some\nvalues being shared and some not. Systems to define and then protect those\nvalues vary in strength. International values have to be protected by the\napplication of national systems of law. Thanks to the Town Planning Acts,\nnational and local systems for the protection of heritage are well developed\nin the United Kingdom, although an all-encompassing piece of legislation\nto define heritage assets and rank them for protection has yet to make the\nstatute books.\nAt the top of the \u2018heritage hierarchy\u2019, World Heritage Sites are\ninscribed by UNESCO and respected by those nation states supporting\nthe organisation. National legislation, however, makes scant reference\nto the concept of World Heritage and this causes confusion at the local\nlevel, where politicians who \u2018know what they like\u2019 may not grasp the\nsignificance of an international attribute.\nGenerally speaking, the rise of information technology has enhanced\nappreciation of both special places and the values of the people who cherish\nthem. The rise of \u2018cultural tourism\u2019 has also helped, and the blurring of the\nline between \u2018holiday makers\u2019 and \u2018learners\u2019 points the way to a better-\nshared future. Where once a summer holiday meant a beach in Spain, it\nmay now mean a trip to Auschwitz or Hiroshima where international\nvalues have to be absorbed in order to achieve any kind of understanding.\nThe recent destruction of World Heritage Sites in the Middle East and\nelsewhere as a result of political and religious conflict has emphasised\nthe need to safeguard such international treasures through awareness,\neducation and physical protection. An appreciation of local values through\nthe consumption of local goods, including food, could be built upon to\nfurther this understanding of others\u2019 values. In spite of the rise of religious\nextremism and the threats of climate change and global conflict, I remain\noptimistic that heritage values at all levels will endure and consolidate.  13. Safeguarding Heritage:\nFrom Legal Rights over Objects to\nLegal Rights for Individuals and\nCommunities?\nMarie Cornu1\nHeritage protection for the twenty-first century is clearly an issue that\nraises a number of questions \u2013 regarding the very concept of cultural\nheritage, and how the law embraces that concept and sets its boundaries;\nregarding the fundamental purpose \u2013 to preserve and pass on \u2013 implied\nby the word \u2018heritage\u2019; regarding the multiple legal environments at the\nregional, national and international levels in which heritage law stands.\nLegally, there are many different ways to organise the connection between\nmemory, history and heritage and, in this respect, diversity rules.\nCultural heritage law is a large body of legislation which was developed\nrelatively recently. National legislation was generally introduced during\nthe nineteenth century, while international law on cultural heritage was\ndeveloped at the end of the nineteenth century and in the second part of\nthe twentieth century. The first important convention was enacted in 1954;2\n1 This chapter is based on a presentation given at the Oxford University colloquium on\n\u2018The Future of the Past: Memory, History and Cultural Heritage in the Twenty-First\nCentury\u2019, organised by the Faculty of Classics of the University of Oxford in cooperation\nwith the Maison Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Oxford (CNRS). This contribution has been translated by\nMarie Trape (CECOJI-CNRS) and revised by Catherine Heygate.\n2 The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed\nConflict, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&\nURL_SECTION=201.html\n\u00a9 Marie Cornu, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0047.13 198 Cultural Heritage Ethics\na protection plan designed for war-time, it was the starting point in the\nconstruction of international law relating to the conservation of cultural\nheritage. Other major legal instruments would follow, such as the 1970\nUNESCO Convention on illicit trafficking of cultural property3 and the 1972\nConvention concerning the protection of world cultural heritage.4 While I\ndo not intend to explore this complex legal architecture in detail in this brief\nessay, I will highlight a few particular aspects of it that, in my view, reflect\na change in our thinking about the protection of cultural heritage over the\npast two decades. These aspects concern the issue of defining heritage, and\nthe process by which heritage is legally identified.\nRegarding the concept of cultural heritage in its relation to memory and\nhistory, I will start with the example of French law, bearing in mind that other\ncountries have a similar history, particularly in Europe where legal models\nevidently circulated across borders. Initially, when heritage protection was\nin its early days, the founding concept was that of the historic monument\nand not, in fact, the more inclusive term \u2018heritage\u2019, which came later (in the\n1970s in France). This notion of a historic monument referred equally to\nbuildings (such as castles or cathedrals) and to objects, the primary concern\nbeing for artistic and historic interest, concepts which can be found in most\nlegislation on heritage.\nBuilding upon this concern for artistic and historic interest, the first\nlegislative texts \u2013 especially France\u2019s law of 31 December 1913 \u2013 developed\nan elitist approach. In France, this founding legislation introduced a public\neasement, a technique never previously used in the heritage field, whereby\nthe owner of any building classified as a historical monument was placed\nunder supervision and was forbidden from making any changes that\nmight alter the physical integrity of the property without the permission\nof the ministry of culture. This approach to protection was founded on\nthe exceptionality of the historical monuments in terms of their artistic\nor historic value. The buildings identified as historical monuments were\nartistic masterpieces. They were, according to Th\u00e9odore Reinach, one of the\narchitects of the 1913 law, stone books in which the memory of the nation\nhad settled, and as such they could contribute to the construction of that\n3 T he 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit\nImport, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, http://portal.unesco.\norg/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html\n4 T he 1972 UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and\nNatural Heritage, http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13055&URL_DO=DO_\nTOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Safeguarding Heritage 199\nmemory.5 This protection scheme, a venture of national interest, thus only\ntook into consideration exceptional things.\nIn the course of the twentieth century, however, the heritage field\nunderwent a double extension, at once typological and chronological,\naccording to Fran\u00e7oise Choay\u2019s analysis in L\u2019all\u00e9gorie du patrimoine.6 The\nextension was typological in that new items, which had not previously fallen\nwithin the purview of the legislation, began to be protected. This extension\narose from the development of a more inclusive concept of heritage, which\nnot only designates exceptional or rare items, but can also be applied to\na trace or a memory. On this basis, modest, ordinary objects can become\nheritage because they carry the memory of various human activities, such as\nfarming, industry, and technology. As a result, tools, habitats, workplaces\nand machines are now being protected. This ethnological approach began\nto be adopted in the field of heritage in the 1970s, at precisely the moment\nwhen the concept of cultural heritage was coming to the fore. The term\n\u2018cultural heritage\u2019 was not chosen by chance, and is indicative of the more\nglobal and inclusive vision that was then emerging.\nThe extension of the heritage field was also chronological. As Choay\nhas pointed out, in the 1960s the chronological framework of heritage\nprotection hardly went beyond the early nineteenth century, even though\nno such temporal limit was imposed by the legislation.7 Since the 1960s,\nhowever, ever more recent elements have been brought within the heritage\nframework, to the extent that twentieth-century heritage has now made its\nway into the categories of public policies on cultural heritage.\nThus the boundary of what constitutes heritage has evolved. Indeed,\nthe concept of heritage turns out to be a highly malleable framework which\nis constantly changing and developing. By contrast, the legal formulation\nof heritage, and hence the legal instruments of heritage protection, are still\nquite close to the earliest formulations of the concept. Heritage law defines\nthe status of physical things; it identifies material wealth. Of course, the\nintangible dimension is not entirely absent, indeed it is at the heart of the\nidea of artistic and historic interest. However, when legislators develop a\nprotection scheme, they design it to protect physical items, regardless of\nwhether those items have an intrinsic value arising from their exceptionality\nor rareness, or whether they function as traces or memories. Inevitably,\n5 A. Auduc, Quand les monuments historiques construisaient la nation (Paris: La documentation\nfran\u00e7aise: Comit\u00e9 d\u2019histoire du minist\u00e8re de la culture, 2008).\n6 F. Choay, L\u2019All\u00e9gorie du patrimoine, coll. La couleur des id\u00e9es (Paris: Seuil, 1992).\n7 I bid. 200 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nthis physically-oriented approach to heritage shapes decision-making in\nrelation to protection schemes and, therefore, their legal formulation.\nFrance\u2019s 1913 law established a procedure for classifying properties\nwhose conservation \u2018presents a public interest from an artistic or a\nhistorical point of view\u2019. As a result, the ensuing easement focused upon\nconservation, and the idea of conservation remains paramount in legislative\ntexts, whether in terms of physical conservation (i.e. respect for a property\u2019s\nphysical integrity) or legal conservation, expressed in such provisions\nas the rules of indefeasibility and inalienability, or measures to prevent\nheritage objects leaving the country. I refer specifically to French law here,\nbut this approach is common to a number of states, including Italy, Spain,\nGermany, Greece and Egypt, and it prevails in important international\nconventions. The 1972 World Heritage Convention, for example, protects\nphysical heritage in the form of sites and monuments, and the objective of\nconservation is still at the centre of its protection mechanism.8\nThis approach, whereby heritage protection law is organised on the\nbasis of material realities, has changed dramatically in the past two decades.\nThe new perspective, which is apparent in the way cultural heritage is\nlegally identified and defined, has introduced a profound change in the\nvery nature of heritage law. This evolution in the legal concept of heritage\nis reflected in two instruments, the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the\nSafeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage,9 and the 2005 Council of\nEurope Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for\nSociety (the Faro Convention).10\nThe UNESCO Convention introduces the concept of intangible heritage\ninto international law for the first time. Strictly speaking, the concept of\nintangible heritage used here was not an ex nihilo creation, since some\nstates, notably Japan and Korea, had already established protection for\ntheir intangible heritage before 2003. However, the concept is completely\nnew in the field of international law, and at present it is not recognised in\nthe legislation of most states. What does this concept refer to? According\nto the UNESCO Convention, intangible cultural heritage means \u2018the\npractices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills \u2013 as well as the\n8 For the text of the 1972 Convention see http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13\n055&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html\n9 h ttp://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_\nSECTION=201.html\n10 h ttp://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/199.htm Safeguarding Heritage 201\ninstruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith \u2013\nthat communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part\nof their cultural heritage\u2019.\nThe most obvious innovation lies in the object of the Convention\u2019s\nprotection \u2013 it deals with intangible heritage, with practices and expressions\nof skills that were not previously in the legislator\u2019s field of vision. Beyond\nthe intangible character of the elements to be protected, however, there is\na more fundamental change in the way heritage is designated. Intangible\nheritage consists of elements that communities, groups and individuals\nrecognise as part of their heritage. As a result, heritage is defined by its\nrelationship with a group, whereas in the standard protection system, this\nrelationship and the associated identification of rights holders is more\ndistant and diffuse, even though the idea of community does exist. The\nchange embodied in the UNESCO Convention does not, therefore, only\naffect the substance of heritage and the distinction between the physical\nand the intangible. After all, the Convention also protects the \u2018instruments,\nobjects, artefacts and cultural spaces\u2019 associated with intangible cultural\nheritage. The more profound evolution lies in the identification of support\ncommunities and the recognition of their power to designate an element\nof cultural heritage. It is this sense of belonging which produces cultural\nheritage. With this understanding, we are moving away from the usual\nsystems of protection.\nA very similar approach was adopted with the Faro Convention, which\nwas enacted shortly after, in 2005, and which states that \u2018for the purposes\nof this Convention, cultural heritage is a group of resources inherited\nfrom the past which people identify, independently of ownership, as\na reflection and expression of their constantly evolving values, beliefs,\nknowledge and traditions. It includes all aspects of the environment\nresulting from the interaction between people and places through time\u2019\n(Art. 2). The text also provides a definition of a heritage community, which\nhas the capacity to define heritage as follows: \u2018a heritage community\nconsists of people who value specific aspects of cultural heritage which\nthey wish, within the framework of public action, to sustain and transmit\nto future generations\u2019 (Art. 2b).\nThe clear similarities in the processes by which cultural heritage\nis defined in these two conventions reveal a change in both the legal\nconstruction of heritage protection, and in the very nature of that law. With\nthe evocation of communities and groups, with the idea that heritage reveals 202 Cultural Heritage Ethics\nitself in a sense of belonging, it seems that we are moving away from a\nproperty law founded on a public interest in protection, and towards a law\ngranting individuals a right on this property. Under this new approach, the\nindividual or the group is at the centre of the definition of cultural heritage,\nand so they are also at the centre of the protection system more generally.\nIt is clear that human rights law has influenced these legislative texts (as is\nthe case in most fields of law): the safeguarding of heritage is articulated\nin terms of the protection of the fundamental rights of communities and\ngroups. This is particularly apparent in the Faro Convention, which, in\nits preamble, recognises \u2018the need to put people and human values at the\ncentre of an enlarged and cross-disciplinary concept of cultural heritage\u2019,\nand in its first article defining the aims of the Convention, states that:\n\u2018The Parties to this Convention agree to:\n(a) Recognise that rights relating to cultural heritage are inherent in the\nright to participate in cultural life, as defined in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights;\n(b) Recognise individual and collective responsibility towards cultural\nheritage;\n(c) Emphasise that the conservation of cultural heritage and its sustainable\nuse have human development and quality of life as their goal;\n(d) Take the necessary steps to apply the provisions of this Convention\nconcerning:\n\u2013 The role of cultural heritage in the construction of a peaceful and\ndemocratic society, and in the processes of sustainable development\nand the promotion of cultural diversity;\n\u2013 Greater synergy of competencies among all the public, institutional\nand private actors concerned\u2019.\n\u2018Emphasising the value and potential of cultural heritage wisely used as\na resource for sustainable development and quality of life in a constantly\nevolving society; Recognising that every person has a right to engage with the\ncultural heritage of their choice, while respecting the rights and freedoms of\nothers, as an aspect of the right freely to participate in cultural life enshrined\nin the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and\nguaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights (1966)\u2019.\nThis concern for heritage had already been defined in these terms in various\nlegal texts relating to the protection of fundamental rights, especially in\nthose texts dealing with the rights of minorities or indigenous communities.\nWith the UNESCO and Faro Conventions, however, the same concern Safeguarding Heritage 203\nwas extended to the instruments for the protection of cultural property.\nWorldwide, this understanding of heritage in terms of fundamental human\nrights is now beginning to have some bearing on the issue of international\nrestitutions, for example in relation to objects possessing considerable\nsymbolic meaning, or to human remains held in museums.11\nAnother evolution in the field of heritage law, which is again apparent\nin the UNESCO and Faro Conventions, concerns the fact that heritage\nprotection now includes the concepts of sustainable development and\nintegration. The concept of sustainable development is particularly\nprominent, and is changing the very definition of heritage. Initially,\nheritage was defined as something to be preserved and passed on to future\ngenerations. Nowadays, it also has social, environmental and economic\naims. In the light of this, heritage law, which had originally developed as\nan autonomous branch of law, is clearly being influenced by other legal\ndisciplines such as environmental law and economic law. It is still too soon\nto say what will come from this. Certainly the outcome can be positive, but\nthere is also a risk that the strength of heritage protection may decrease.\n11 On this tendency, see: M. Cornu and M.-A.
