Following conquest, colonial\nofficials incorporated these areas into the Spanish Empire.\nSpanish soldiers, priests and administrators forced Iberian\nCatholic economic institutions, habits and values upon\nindigenous people. During this time, crown lawyers legally\ndefined the status of Native Americans within the empire to\nmore effectively tax them. To help administer its New World\nterritory, the Spanish crown entrusted conquistadores and\nother officials with grants of land and Native American slaves\nknown as encomiendas (from the Spanish word encomendar\n-\u201cto entrust\u201d). The recipients of such grants, the encomederos,\nwould in turn, collect tribute in the form of gold, kind, or forced\nlabor from the Native Americans who lived on the allotted\nland. Spanish officials demanded that landholders provide\nmilitary protection to their Native American laborers and make\nprovisions to convert them to Catholicism. However, most\nencomideros claimed the land they occupied without fulfilling\ntheir obligations to either protect or convert their Indian slaves.\nDeveloped in part to support the needs of the early mining\nindustry, the encomienda system allowed for the rapid\ndevelopment of areas like the San Luis Potosi silver mines\nin Bolivia. However, given the brutal human costs of mining\nKneeling Female Figure and the exhaustion of many mines over the course of the\n17th century, Spanish officials began to view the encomienda\n15th - early 16th century\nsystem as outdated.

It shares\nthe continental landmasses of Eurasia, Africa, and North\nand South America. It is bounded by the Pacific, Indian\nand Artic Oceans. Nomadic horsemen dominated steppe\nlife, conquering large sections. Russian explorers and\nsettlers began relocating to Asia in the 1600s, a process\nthey would complete by the 19th century. During this\nsame period, the Ottoman Empire expanded throughout\nAnatolia, the Balkans and Egypt. In the 17th century,\nthe Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered\nChina. The Islamic Mughal Empire (1526-1857) and\nthe Hindu Maratha Empire (16th to early 19th century)\nlikewise controlled much of India from the 16th to 18th\ncentury.

The following\nchapters will build upon this information by encouraging readers to broaden their horizons and\nconfront the past from a multitude of perspectives. As we cover more than 500 years of history,\nwe will see that while many aspects of the human experience have radically changed, other\nareas retain a high degree of continuity. When reading through this text, try to identify trends\nof continuity and change over time. The next three chapters deal with empires that governed\nvast lands in Europe, America, Asia, Eurasia and the Middle East. The following three chapters\nexamine revolutions in science and religion, social and cultural revolutions that challenged and\ntoppled existing political orders, and a technological revolution that changed the world. We then\nexamine how various societies dealt with the challenges of modernity and outside encroachment.\nOur textbook concludes with an investigation of the 20th century and our modern world.\n14 CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD IN 1500 2\nExpanding Empires,\nEurope and the\nAmericas, 1500-1700\nMonument to the Discoveries Artist: Marcus Lindstrom\nSource: iStock.com/LordRunar\n(Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos) in Lisbon, Portugal\nLicense: Standard License (purchased by ETSU)\nEUROPE\nThe Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and first Europeans to circumnavigate the African continent\nsubsequent expansion into the Mediterranean World and venture into the Indian Ocean.

As a child, she attended a Benedictine\nmonastery in Brehna in 1504 and later moved to the\nCistercian monastery Marienthron in Nimbschen, near\nthe German town of Grimma. Interested in the reformist\nmovement, she secretly asked Luther for help in leaving\nthe monastery. Katharina escaped with some other\nnuns from the convent to Wittenberg, hiding on a food\ndelivery wagon Luther had sent on Easter Eve, April\n4, 1523. Realizing that the nuns would be rejected by\ntheir families, Martin Luther found many of them homes,\nhusbands and jobs.\nInitially, Katherina stayed with the city clerk of Wittenberg,\nPhilipp Reichenback but eventually ended up living\nwith the painter Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife,\nBarbara. Katherina received several marriage proposals\nbut held out hope for an engagement to Luther. Although\nworried that pursuing a relationship might impair his\nleadership of the Protestant reform movement, Luther\neventually proposed marriage. On June 13, 1525, Martin\nLuther married the 15 years younger Katherina von\nBora, setting a precedent for allowing reformist clergy to\nmarry.

They also took in four orphans.\nWhen her husband died in 1546, Katherina struggled\nfinancially without his income as a pastor and professor.\nAlthough Luther had named her his heir in his will, it did\nnot conform with Saxon Law. She was forced to leave\nWittenberg at the outbreak of the Schmalkalden War, a\nconflict between Protestant and Catholic nobles from\n1546 to 1547. She died in poverty at Torgau in Germany\nin 1552 at 53.

The Ming dynasty also centralized power and embarked on ambitious building\nprojects, including the construction of a new imperial capital and an expansion of the Great Wall of China. The\nQing dynasty, which overthrew the Mings in 1644, increasingly faced the challenges of Western encroachment.\nThe establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate ushered in a period of relative stability in Japan. The shogunate\nintroduced a policy of strict isolation as it banned Christianity and severely restricted trade and interaction with\nWestern nations. This isolation would last until the 1850s. During this period, European influence in Southeast\nAsia remained relatively limited. The Spanish Philippines was the only real and significant area where Europeans\nwielded any meaningful authority.

Inspired by Enlightenment thought\nand frustrated by the lack of professional options for\nwomen in traditional British society, Wollstonecraft\npublished her seminal work, A Vindication of the\nRights of Woman: with Stricture on Political and Moral\nSubjects, in 1792. Throughout her work, Wollstonecraft\nargued that women played a vital role in the health of\nthe nation and as the educators of young children,\nwomen should be allowed to pursue educations so\nas to be able to raise future generations of British\nsubjects. Furthermore, wives should be treated as\ncompanions of husbands rather than merely spouses.\nWollstonecraft\u2019s daughter Mary Shelley (1797-1851)\nwould become famous in her own right as the author\nof the novel Frankenstein.

A faith in rationality and scientific progress allowed for the creation of ever more violent\nmilitary weapons used in increasingly bloody wars. Although French Revolutionaries initially created\na republic with a moderate constitution, they later embraced violence and executed people for\nchallenging the government or having royalist ties. Although the Napoleonic Wars spread Enlightenment\nideas throughout Europe, it did so at the cost of millions of casualties. Furthermore, as the American\nRevolution proved, creating a nation based on natural rights did not end the enslavement of millions of\npeople of African descent or the dispossession of hundreds of Native American tribes.\n58 CHAPTER 5 AGE OF REASON: THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION, ENLIGHTENED THOUGHT AND ITS IMPACT 6\nChallenging the\nOld Order: The Age\nof Revolutions\nArrest of Louis XVI and his Family Artist: Thomas Falcon Marshall\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nThe Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution and the and state put pressure on old regimes, many of which\nEnlightenment vastly altered how some people could not or would not respond to these challenges.\nunderstood themselves and the world around them.

While\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmany at the time, and still do, blame the \u201ctyrant\u201d King License: Public Domain\nGeorge III, the origins of the Revolution lay in differing\nconceptions of parliamentary rule. Since the so-called\nglorious revolution of 1688, when James II (1633-1701)\nwas deposed by the eventual co-monarchs his daughter\nMary (Mary II r. 1689-1694) and her husband William\nof Orange (William III r. 1689-1702), the power of\nparliament had significantly increased. The British\nparliament began to see itself as the supreme governing\nbody able to levy and pass laws for the whole of the\nempire. This, however, was contested in the Thirteen\nColonies, which had their own assemblies. These\nassemblies insisted that they should control local affairs\nand that no law or tax was valid unless approved by an\nAmerican assembly.\nInstead of negotiation, the British parliament attempted\nto levy new taxes, including the Stamp Act of 1765. With\nneither side willing to alter their position, tensions rose,\nleading to the Second Continental Congress\u2019s fateful\ndecision to approve, on July 4, 1776, a declaration of\nindependence composed by Thomas Jefferson. The war\nfor control over America had formally begun.\nGeneral George Washington (1732-1799) would lead\nthe American Continental Army. Encouraged by early\nvictories and eager to antagonize its rival, France with\nits large fighting force and navy, entered the war against\nBritain. Outmaneuvered, the British admitted defeat,\nsurrendering to American troops in 1781 at Yorktown.\nTwo years later, in 1783, the Treaty of Paris recognized\nAmerican independence.\nAfter winning the Revolution came the task of creating\na structure for the new nation. Fearful of centralized\npower and influenced by the Enlightenment and its\nnatural rights, Americans developed a new system\nof government.

One aspect about these revolutions is certain: they still influence much of\nhow humanity views and understands the world and continue to shape our conceptions of liberty, equality\nand freedom. The Haitian Revolution interfered with Napoleon\u2019s plan to establish a French Empire across\nthe Atlantic world. The Louisiana Purchase extended slavery in the United States. It also blocked slave\nholding empires such as France and Britain from expansion, moving them closer to the abolition of the\ntrans-Atlantic slave trade. The French abolished the slave trade in 1815, followed by the abolition of\nslavery in 1845. The British abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. In Latin America, this\nperiod of revolutions was marked by violence and turmoil. Inspired by the America, French and Haitian\nRevolutions, rebellions against the Spanish and Portuguese led to the establishment of independent\nnations. Following these revolutions, each of the new countries would have to establish a new framework\nfor governance as they attempted to create a new prosperous and independent nation.\n77 7\nRemaking the\nWorld: The Industrial\nRevolution, Workers and\na New Economic Order\nBerlin, Alte Nationalgalerie, Adolph von Menzel, Artist: Adolph von Menzel\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthe Iron-Rolling Mill\nLicense: Public Domain\nThe Industrial Revolution began in earnest during The origins of the Industrial Revolution began with the\nthe latter half of the 19th century.

They acknowledged Britain\u2019s rapid industrial\nsuccess but lamented the damage such success had wrought\namong Britain\u2019s poor working classes. However, Lowell argued that\nby hiring young women to work in his factories for a set number of\nyears, he would provide his young charges with not just wages but\njob skills, work experience, educational opportunities, room and\nboard, proper chaperoning and religious instruction. A portion of\ntheir salaries would be sent home, helping to sustain their family\u2019s\nfarms. They would return home poised to become hard-working,\nsensible wives and mothers. In this regard, industrialization would\nsupport rather than endanger traditional New England family values.\nHowever, in reality, Lowell women worked long hours in dangerous\nconditions. To be specific, many did gain crucial workplace skills\nand a sense of working-class solidarity. For instance, Lowell\nwomen participated in one of the first labor strikes for higher\nwages. However, Lowell factory managers replaced them with poor\nIrish and German factory laborers.

Her husband, the\nfuture Peter III, gave her a position at court, but their\nmarriage was not happy. During their marriage, she\nhad at least three lovers, and we can\u2019t be certain that\nany of her children, including the future Czar Paul I\n(1754-1801), were legitimate. Her third child, a son,\nwas almost certainly fathered by Grigory Orlov (1734-\n1783). The number of Catherine\u2019s lovers continues\nto be debated by historians, with many placing the\nnumber somewhere between 12 and 22. The actual\nnumber will likely never be known. Until her stroke and\nsubsequent death at age 67, Catherine had surrounded\nherself with young men and participated in the courtly\ngames of flirting and intrigue. It is unlikely that all of\nthese relationships were physical. Whatever the case,\nCatherine kept a close eye on her court, ruled Russia\nwith an iron fist, and let little stand in her way of getting\nwhat she wanted.\nPortrait of Catherine II of Russia\nArtist: Follower of Johann Baptist von Lampi, the Elder\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nCatherine understood that Russia needed reform.\nOTTOMANS\nRecognizing the power of Enlightenment ideals,\nCatherine wanted to harness the ideas and technology of\nAs many European Empires strengthened their\nthe West without undermining Russian institutions and,\neconomies, states and militaries, the Ottomans\nof course, the power of the throne.

He attended the Colegio de San Juan de Letran\nand became a captain-general of his home province in\n1895. Aguinaldo became involved with the Katipunan, a\nsecret society that led an armed resistance against Spanish\ncolonial rule the following year. Becoming a skilled insurgent\nknown as \u201cMagdeleno\u201d (after Mary Magdalene), Aguinaldo\nand his \u201cMagdelano\u201d forces became known for carrying out\nplanned attacks on Spanish colonial forces. For instance, at\nthe Battle of Zapote Bridge in February 1897, Aguinaldo ordered his troops to ring a local\nbridge with dynamite and lace the river beneath with punji sticks. When a Spanish army\nof 12,000 attempted to cross, the Magdelenos destroyed the bridge and routed the army.\nIn March, representatives of the Philippine revolutionary government elected Aguinaldo as\nits generalissimo. In October 1897, Aguinaldo commissioned the creation of a constitution\nthat further legitimized his regime. Following extensive negotiations with Spanish officials,\nAguinaldo agreed to cease resistance, dissolve his government and go into exile in Hong Kong.\nWhen the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Commodore George Dewey arranged for\nAguinaldo to be brought to the Philippines to create a new revolutionary government. After a\nprolonged siege, Spanish authorities surrendered Manila to American forces. Although Spain\nagreed to cede the Philippines to the U.S. in return for $20 million, Aguinaldo declared the\ncreation of a provisional Philippine republic in January 1899. Aguinaldo would lead a guerilla\nwar against occupying U.S. forces for the next two years. Captured by American forces in\nLuzon on March 23, 1901, Aguinaldo acceded to U.S. control of the Philippines. Ironically,\nwhen imperial Japanese forces invaded the Philippines in December 1941, Aguinaldo re-\nemerged to lead a pro-Japanese collaborationist government. On February 1942, Aguinaldo\ntook to the airwaves to give his \u201cBataan Address,\u201d which urged American forces in the\nPhilippines to lay down their arms. Captured when American troops retook the islands in\n1945, Aguinaldo was released from prison under a general amnesty for all former Japanese\ncollaborators.

While Britain reigned over the largest number of territories, other\nnations like France, Germany and Italy held sizable empires. Although designed to enrich the home\ncountries, imperialism had the effect of spreading European politics, science, technology, economic\nbeliefs, religion and even popular sports across much of the developing world. This era also witnessed\nthe origins of local independence movements, which in time would lead to nationalist movements across\nthe world and would also set into motion geographical disputes that would, in turn, pave the way for the\nFirst and Second World Wars of the 20th century.\n139 11\nWorld in Crisis, Conflict, and\nthe Struggle for Independence:\nWorld War I, the Indian\nIndependence Movement and\nthe Russian Revolution\nIllustration of Christmas in the Artist: Justinas\nSource: iStock.com/ Justinas\ntrenches of World War 1\nLicense: Standard License (purchased by ETSU)\nThe 20th century brought profound changes to the chapter (World War I, the Russian Revolution, and\nworld.

Not only had conflict become global, but it was now\nmuch more destructive and deadly. The war also demonstrated how the modern state could be\nreconstituted to fight what is now known as total war. The Russian Revolution led to the creation\nof the first Marxist-inspired state. Sympathizers hoped that the Soviet Union would create a more\negalitarian society along Marxist-Leninist lines. Instead, a strong one-party authoritarian dictatorship\nemerged that ruled with little opposition and increasing repression of alternative voices by sending\npolitical opponents to forced labor camps. The independence movement in India gave birth to new\nnations and forms of national conflict and struggle. The campaign for Indian independence inspired\nother colonies to fight for sovereignty. The early decades of the 20th century presented numerous\nissues and problems but also brought hope as dedicated groups all across the globe struggled for\nincreased freedoms and equality.\n154 CHAPTER 11 WORLD IN CRISIS, CONFLICT, AND THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE 12\nInterwar Years and\nthe Rise of Fascism\nNew Model A Ford (1931) \u2013 Miami, Florida Artist: William A.

Many who\nfought in World War I believed that the conflict would end quickly and with little loss of life. Four years\nand 37 million deaths later, the fighting ended with an armistice. However, many of the problems\nwhich had led to the outbreak of war in August 1914 remained unresolved. The German and Austro-\nHungarian empires had fallen, and the ethnic minorities they had governed over now sought to\nestablish their own nation-states. In the early 1920s, western European nations like Germany and\nFrance took tentative steps toward political liberalization. However, the bloody legacy of the First\nWorld War led to a questioning of traditional western morality, religion and art. The scholars and\nartists of the interwar years experimented with new architectural, painting and cinematic techniques\nto capture the randomness and absurdity of the world around them. Following the Great Depression,\nlarge sections of the middle classes in western nations found themselves unemployed, destitute and\nwilling to follow fascist leaders that promised a return to the power of traditional monarchies and\nempires but with the trappings of elections and representative government.

Deeply ideological, the Cold War pitted supporters of\ndemocratic government, capitalism and individualism against proponents of one-party political systems,\nsocialist economic planning and the collective good. On another level the war represented a struggle\nbetween the world\u2019s two most powerful nations. Although the Cold War did explode into real conflict\u2014\nKorea and Vietnam for instance \u2013 it was largely a war carried out in the shadows, involving boycotts,\npropaganda and national reputations. Although the United States and its allies won the war, significant\ngeopolitical issues remained to be solved.\nAlthough the Soviet Union was dismantled, Russia remained a viable state. The role that Russians, in\nshock and angered by the loss of the Cold War but still possessing a powerful conventional military\nand nuclear arsenal, would play on the world stage remained to be determined. Although the countries\nof Eastern Europe were now free, their economies remained fragile. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and\nSlovaks now had to determine if their nations would progress with free markets or some form of\ncapitalist-socialist hybrid system. Germans now openly discussed the possibility of reunification. But\nwhat type of relationship would a unified Germany have with its neighbors? Although a key U.S. ally in\nthe Cold War, Japan now stood as a nation with a powerful economy that could increasingly say no to\nthe will of the American government. Finally, as the Tiananmen Square Massacre revealed, although the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China had liberalized key sectors of its economy, it would not reform its political or\nconstitutional system. Therefore, although there was much to celebrate at the end of the Cold War, the\npeople of the world looked forward to the end of the 20th century with a mixture of hope and uncertainty.\n206 CHAPTER 14 COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION OF THE WORLD FROM 1950 15\nThe Modern\nWorld\nPresident Reagan is giving his famous speech 1984 at the Artist: Unknown\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nBerlin Wall behind the Brandenburg Gate on the West\nLicense: Public Domain\nBerlin side.\nCreated in 1961 by the East German government to Following the announcement of Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s\nprevent local citizens from fleeing to the West, the liberalizing glasnost and perestroika policies of the\nBerlin Wall represented a collection of bunkers, guard mid-1980s, the pro-Kremlin East German government\ntowers and barbed wire fences that spanned 96 miles faced public pressure to reform.
