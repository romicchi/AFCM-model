They worked for decades to place the issue of the abusive treatment that\nstudents were subjected to at residential schools on the national agenda. Their persever-\nance led to the reaching of the historic Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.\nAll Canadians must now demonstrate the same level of courage and determination,\nas we commit to an ongoing process of reconciliation. By establishing a new and respect-\nful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, we will restore what\nmust be restored, repair what must be repaired, and return what must be returned.\nIn preparation for the release of its final report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\nof Canada has developed a definition of reconciliation and a guiding set of principles for\ntruth and reconciliation. This definition has informed the Commission\u2019s work and the\nprinciples have shaped the calls to action we will issue in the final report.\nJustice Murray Sinclair\nChair, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\nChief Wilton Littlechild\nCCoommmmiissssiioonneerr\nDr. Marie Wilson\nCommissioner  Principles of Reconciliation\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada believes that in order for Canada\nto flourish in the twenty-first century, reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aborig-\ninal Canada must be based on the following principles.\n1\nThe United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\nis the framework for reconciliation at all levels and across all sectors\nof Canadian society.\n2\nFirst Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples, as the original peoples of\nthis country and as self-determining peoples, have Treaty, consti-\ntutional, and human rights that must be recognized and respected.\n3\nReconciliation is a process of healing of relationships that requires\npublic truth sharing, apology, and commemoration that acknowl-\nedge and redress past harms.\n4\nReconciliation requires constructive action on addressing the\nongoing legacies of colonialism that have had destructive impacts\non Aboriginal peoples\u2019 education, cultures and languages, health,\nchild welfare, the administration of justice, and economic opportu-\nnities and prosperity.\n5\nReconciliation must create a more equitable and inclusive society\nby closing the gaps in social, health, and economic outcomes that\nexist between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. 4 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\n6\nAll Canadians, as Treaty peoples, share responsibility for establish-\ning and maintaining mutually respectful relationships.\n7\nThe perspectives and understandings of Aboriginal Elders and\nTraditional Knowledge Keepers of the ethics, concepts, and prac-\ntices of reconciliation are vital to long-term reconciliation.\n8\nSupporting Aboriginal peoples\u2019 cultural revitalization and inte-\ngrating Indigenous knowledge systems, oral histories, laws, pro-\ntocols, and connections to the land into the reconciliation process\nare essential.\n9\nReconciliation requires political will, joint leadership, trust build-\ning, accountability, and transparency, as well as a substantial\ninvestment of resources.\n10\nReconciliation requires sustained public education and dialogue,\nincluding youth engagement, about the history and legacy of res-\nidential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal rights, as well as the his-\ntorical and contemporary contributions of Aboriginal peoples to\nCanadian society.\nThe following pages outline the Commission\u2019s central conclusions about the history\nand legacy of residential schools and identify both the barriers to reconciliation and the\nopportunities for constructive action that currently exist. Introduction\nF\nor over a century, the central goals of Canada\u2019s Aboriginal policy were to eliminate\nAboriginal governments; ignore Aboriginal rights; terminate the Treaties; and,\nthrough a process of assimilation, cause Aboriginal peoples to cease to exist as dis-\ntinct legal, social, cultural, religious, and racial entities in Canada. The establishment and\noperation of residential schools were a central element of this policy, which can best be\ndescribed as \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d\nPhysical genocide is the mass killing of the members of a targeted group, and biological\ngenocide is the destruction of the group\u2019s reproductive capacity. Cultural genocide is the\ndestruction of those structures and practices that allow the group to continue as a group.\nStates that engage in cultural genocide set out to destroy the political and social institutions\nof the targeted group. Land is seized, and populations are forcibly transferred and their\nmovement is restricted. Languages are banned. Spiritual leaders are persecuted, spiritual\npractices are forbidden, and objects of spiritual value are confiscated and destroyed. And,\nmost significantly to the issue at hand, families are disrupted to prevent the transmission\nof cultural values and identity from one generation to the next.\nIn its dealing with Aboriginal people, Canada did all these things.\nCanada asserted control over Aboriginal land. In some locations, Canada negotiated\nTreaties with First Nations; in others, the land was simply occupied or seized. The nego-\ntiation of Treaties, while seemingly honourable and legal, was often marked by fraud and\ncoercion, and Canada was, and remains, slow to implement their provisions and intent.1\nOn occasion, Canada forced First Nations to relocate their reserves from agriculturally\nvaluable or resource-rich land onto remote and economically marginal reserves.2\nWithout legal authority or foundation, in the 1880s, Canada instituted a \u201cpass system\u201d\nthat was intended to confine First Nations people to their reserves.3\nCanada replaced existing forms of Aboriginal government with relatively powerless\nband councils whose decisions it could override and whose leaders it could depose.4 In\nthe process, it disempowered Aboriginal women, who had held significant influence and\npowerful roles in many First Nations, including the Mohawks, the Carrier, and Tlingit.5\nCanada denied the right to participate fully in Canadian political, economic, and social\nlife to those Aboriginal people who refused to abandon their Aboriginal identity.6\nCanada outlawed Aboriginal spiritual practices, jailed Aboriginal spiritual leaders, and\nconfiscated sacred objects.7\nAnd, Canada separated children from their parents, sending them to residential schools.\nThis was done not to educate them, but primarily to break their link to their culture and 6 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nidentity. In justifying the government\u2019s residential school policy, Canada\u2019s first prime min-\nister, Sir John A. Macdonald, told the House of Commons in 1883:\nWhen the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages;\nhe is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write his habits,\nand training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read\nand write. It has been strongly pressed on myself, as the head of the Department, that\nIndian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influ-\nence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial\nschools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.8\nThese measures were part of a coherent policy to eliminate Aboriginal people as dis-\ntinct peoples and to assimilate them into the Canadian mainstream against their will.\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs Duncan Campbell Scott outlined the goals of that policy\nin 1920, when he told a parliamentary committee that \u201cour object is to continue until there\nis not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic.\u201d9 These\ngoals were reiterated in 1969 in the federal government\u2019s Statement of the Government of\nCanada on Indian Policy (more often referred to as the \u201cWhite Paper\u201d), which sought to\nend Indian status and terminate the Treaties that the federal government had negotiated\nwith First Nations.10\nThe Canadian government pursued this policy of cultural genocide because it wished\nto divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control\nover their land and resources. If every Aboriginal person were \u201cabsorbed into the body\npolitic,\u201d there would be no reserves, no Treaties, and no Aboriginal rights.\nResidential schooling quickly became a central element in the federal government\u2019s\nAboriginal policy. When Canada was created as a country in 1867, Canadian churches\nwere already operating a small number of boarding schools for Aboriginal people. As\nsettlement moved westward in the 1870s, Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries\nestablished missions and small boarding schools across the Prairies, in the North, and\nin British Columbia. Most of these schools received small, per-student grants from the\nfederal government. In 1883, the federal government moved to establish three, large, res-\nidential schools for First Nation children in western Canada. In the following years, the\nsystem grew dramatically. According to the Indian Affairs annual report for 1930, there\nwere eighty residential schools in operation across the country at that time.11 The Indian\nResidential Schools Settlement Agreement provided compensation to students who\nattended 139 residential schools and residences.12 The federal government has estimated\nthat at least 150,000 First Nation, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit students passed through the system.13\nRoman Catholic, Anglican, United, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches were the\nmajor denominations involved in the administration of the residential school system. The\ngovernment\u2019s partnership with the churches remained in place until 1969, and, although\nmost of the schools had closed by the 1980s, the last federally supported residential schools\nremained in operation until the late 1990s. Introduction \u2022 7\nFor children, life in these schools was lonely and alien. Buildings were poorly located,\npoorly built, and poorly maintained. The staff was limited in numbers, often poorly trained,\nand not adequately supervised. Many schools were poorly heated and poorly ventilated,\nand the diet was meagre and of poor quality. Discipline was harsh, and daily life was highly\nregimented. Aboriginal languages and cultures were demeaned and suppressed. The edu-\ncational goals of the schools were limited and confused, and usually reflected a low regard\nfor the intellectual capabilities of Aboriginal people. For the students, education and tech-\nnical training too often gave way to the drudgery of doing the chores necessary to make\nthe schools self-sustaining. Child neglect was institutionalized, and the lack of supervision\ncreated situations where students were prey to sexual and physical abusers.\nIn establishing residential schools, the Canadian government essentially declared\nAboriginal people to be unfit parents. Aboriginal parents were labelled as being indiffer-\nent to the future of their children\u2014a judgment contradicted by the fact that parents often\nkept their children out of schools because they saw those schools, quite accurately, as dan-\ngerous and harsh institutions that sought to raise their children in alien ways. Once in\nthe schools, brothers and sisters were kept apart, and the government and churches even\narranged marriages for students after they finished their education.\nThe residential school system was based on an assumption that European civiliza-\ntion and Christian religions were superior to Aboriginal culture, which was seen as being\nsavage and brutal. Government officials also were insistent that children be discour-\naged\u2014and often prohibited\u2014from speaking their own languages. The missionaries who\nran the schools played prominent roles in the church-led campaigns to ban Aboriginal\nspiritual practices such as the Potlatch and the Sun Dance (more properly called the\n\u201cThirst Dance\u201d), and to end traditional Aboriginal marriage practices. Although, in most\nof their official pronouncements, government and church officials took the position that\nAboriginal people could be \u2018civilized,\u2019 it is clear that many believed that Aboriginal culture\nwas inherently inferior.\nThis hostility to Aboriginal cultural and spiritual practice continued well into the twenti-\neth century. In 1942, John House, the principal of the Anglican school in Gleichen, Alberta,\nbecame involved in a campaign to have two Blackfoot chiefs deposed, in part because\nof their support for traditional dance ceremonies.14 In 1947, Roman Catholic official J. O.\nPlourde told a federal parliamentary committee that since Canada was a Christian nation\nthat was committed to having \u201call its citizens belonging to one or other of the Christian\nchurches,\u201d he could see no reason why the residential schools \u201cshould foster aboriginal\nbeliefs.\u201d15 United Church official George Dorey told the same committee that he ques-\ntioned whether there was such a thing as \u201cnative religion.\u201d16\nInto the 1950s and 1960s, the prime mission of residential schools was the cultural trans-\nformation of Aboriginal children. In 1953, J. E. Andrews, the principal of the Presbyterian\nschool in Kenora, Ontario, wrote that \u201cwe must face realistically the fact that the only\nhope for the Canadian Indian is eventual assimilation into the white race.\u201d17 In 1957, the 8 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nprincipal of the Gordon\u2019s Reserve school in Saskatchewan, Albert Southard, wrote that he\nbelieved that the goal of residential schooling was to \u201cchange the philosophy of the Indian\nchild. In other words since they must work and live with \u2018whites\u2019 then they must begin to\nthink as \u2018whites.\u2019\u201d Southard said that the Gordon\u2019s school could never have a student coun-\ncil, since \u201cin so far as the Indian understands the department\u2019s policy, he is against it.\u201d18\nIn a 1958 article on residential schools, senior Oblate Andr\u00e9 Renaud echoed the words of\nJohn A. Macdonald, arguing that when students at day schools went back to their \u201chomes\nat the end of the school day and for the weekend, the pupils are re-exposed to their native\nculture, however diluted, from which the school is trying to separate them.\u201d A residential\nschool, on the other hand, could \u201csurround its pupils almost twenty-four hours a day with\nnon-Indian Canadian culture through radio, television, public address system, movies,\nbooks, newspapers, group activities, etc.\u201d19\nDespite the coercive measures that the government adopted, it failed to achieve its pol-\nicy goals. Although Aboriginal peoples and cultures have been badly damaged, they con-\ntinue to exist. Aboriginal people have refused to surrender their identity. It was the former\nstudents, the Survivors of Canada\u2019s residential schools, who placed the residential school\nissue on the public agenda. Their efforts led to the negotiation of the Indian Residential\nSchools Settlement Agreement that mandated the establishment of a residential school\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. In response to their efforts, the federal\ngovernment and the churches also issued public apologies for their involvement in the\noperation of the residential school system. The history\nA group of students and parents from the Saddle Lake Reserve, en route to the Methodist-operated school in Red Deer,\nAlberta. Woodruff, Library and Archives Canada, PA-040715.\nI\nt can start with a knock on the door one morning. It is the local Indian agent, or the par-\nish priest, or, perhaps, a Mounted Police officer. The bus for residential school leaves\nthat morning. It is a day the parents have long been dreading. Even if the children have\nbeen warned in advance, the morning\u2019s events are still a shock. The officials have arrived\nand the children must go.\nFor tens of thousands of Aboriginal children for over a century, this was the beginning\nof their residential schooling. They were torn from their parents, who often surrendered\nthem only under threat of prosecution. Then, they were hurled into a strange and fright-\nening place, one in which their parents and culture would be demeaned and oppressed.\nFor Frederick Ernest Koe, it started when the Anglican minister and the Mounted Police\narrived with a message that he had to leave his parents\u2019 home in Aklavik in the Northwest\nTerritories that morning. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to my dad or my brother Allan,\ndidn\u2019t get to pet my dogs or nothing.\u201d1\nThe day she left for the Lestock, Saskatchewan, school, Marlene Kayseas\u2019s parents drove\nher into the town of Wadena. \u201cThere was a big truck there. It had a back door and that truck\nwas full of kids and there was no windows on that truck.\u201d2 Larry Beardy travelled by train\nfrom Churchill, Manitoba, to the Anglican residential school in Dauphin, Manitoba\u2014a\njourney of 1,200 kilometres. As soon as they realized that they were leaving their parents\nbehind, the younger children started crying. At every stop, the train took on more children 10 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nand they would start to cry as well. \u201cThat train I want to call that train of tears.\u201d3 Florence\nHorassi was taken to the Fort Providence, Northwest Territories, school in a small airplane.\nOn its way to the school, the plane stopped at a number of small communities to pick up\nstudents. \u201cWhen the plane took off, there\u2019s about six or five older ones, didn\u2019t cry, but I saw\ntears come right out of their eyes. Everybody else was crying. There\u2019s a whole plane crying.\nI wanted to cry, too, \u2019cause my brother was crying, but I held my tears back and held him.\u201d4\nThe arrival at school was often even more traumatizing than the departure from home\nor the journey. Lily Bruce\u2019s parents were in tears when they left her and her brother at the\nAlert Bay, British Columbia, school.5 At Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta, Vitaline Elsie\nJenner fought to stay with her mother. \u201cI was screaming and hollering. And in my language\nI said, \u2018Mama, Mama, k\u00e2ya nakasin\u2019 and in English it was, \u2018Mom, Mom, don\u2019t leave me.\u2019\n\u2019Cause that\u2019s all I knew was to speak Cree. And so the nun took us.\u201d6\nNellie Ningewance was raised in Hudson, Ontario, and went to the Sioux Lookout,\nOntario, school in the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cWhen we arrived we had to register that we had\narrived, then they took us to cut our hair.\u201d7 Bernice Jacks became very frightened when her\nhair was cut on her arrival at a school in the Northwest Territories. \u201cI could see my hair\nfalling. And I couldn\u2019t do nothing. And I was so afraid my mom \u2026 I wasn\u2019t thinking about\nmyself. I was thinking about Mom. I say, \u2018Mom\u2019s gonna be really mad. And June is gonna\nbe angry. And it\u2019s gonna be my fault.\u2019\u201d8\nMarthe Basile-Coocoo recalled feeling a chill on first seeing the Pointe Bleue, Qu\u00e9bec,\nschool.\nIt was something like a grey day, it was a day without sunshine. It was, it was the\nimpression that I had, that I was only six years old, then, well, the nuns separated us,\nmy brothers, and then my uncles, then I no longer understood. Then that, that was a\nperiod there, of suffering, nights of crying, we all gathered in a corner, meaning that\nwe came together, and there we cried. Our nights were like that.9\nPauline St-Onge was traumatized by just the sight of the Sept-\u00celes school in Qu\u00e9bec.\nShe fought back when her father tried to take her into the school. \u201cI thought in my child\u2019s\nhead I said: \u2018you would \u2026 you would make me go there, but I will learn nothing, nothing,\nnothing.\u2019\u201d10\nCampbell Papequash was taken, against his will, to residential school in 1946. \u201cAnd\nafter I was taken there they took off my clothes and then they deloused me. I didn\u2019t know\nwhat was happening but I learned about it later, that they were delousing me; \u2018the dirty,\nno-good-for-nothing savages, lousy.\u2019\u201d11\nRoy Denny was perplexed and frightened by the clothing that the priests and sisters\nwore at the Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, school. \u201cWe were greeted by this man dressed in\nblack with a long gown. That was the priest, come to find later. And the nuns with their\nblack, black outfits with the white collar and a white, white collar and, like a breastplate of\nwhite.\u201d12 Calvin Myerion recalled being overwhelmed by the size of the Brandon, Manitoba, The history \u2022 11\n\u201cThe only building that I knew up to that time, that moment in my life was the one-storey house that we had. And when I\ngot to the residential school, I seen this big monster of a building, and I\u2019ve never seen any buildings that, that large, that\nhigh.\u201d \u2013 Calvin Myerion, Brandon, Manitoba, school. United Church of Canada Board of Home Missions, 86.158P/ 22N.\nschool. \u201cThe only building that I knew up to that time, that moment in my life was the\none-storey house that we had. And when I got to the residential school, I seen this big\nmonster of a building, and I\u2019ve never seen any buildings that, that large, that high.\u201d13 Archie\nHyacinthe compared the experience to that of being captured and taken into captivity.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the trauma started for me, being separated from my sister, from my parents,\nand from our, our home. We were no longer free. It was like being, you know, taken to a\nstrange land, even though it was our, our, our land, as I understood later on.\u201d14 When she\nfirst went to the Amos, Qu\u00e9bec, school, Margo Wylde could not speak any French. \u201cI said\nto myself, \u2018How am I going to express myself? How will I make people understand what I\u2019m\nsaying?\u2019 And I wanted to find my sisters to ask them to come and get me. You know it\u2019s sad\nto say, but I felt I was a captive.\u201d15\nOn their arrival at residential school, students often were required to exchange the\nclothes they were wearing for school-supplied clothing. This could mean the loss of home-\nmade clothing that was of particular value and meaning to them. Murray Crowe said his\nclothes from home were taken and burned at the school that he attended in northwestern\nOntario.16 When Wilbur Abrahams\u2019s mother sent him to the Alert Bay school in British\nColumbia, she outfitted him in brand-new clothes. When he arrived at the school, he was\ntold to hand in this outfit in exchange for school clothing. \u201cThat was the last time I saw\nmy new clothes. Dare not ask questions.\u201d17 Martin Nicholas of Nelson House, Manitoba, 12 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nBoys at the Sioux Lookout, Ontario, school in the 1930s in their school uniforms. General Synod Archives; Anglican Church of\nCanada; P75-103-S7-127.\nwent to the Pine Creek, Manitoba, school in the 1950s. \u201cMy mom had prepared me in\nNative clothing. She had made me a buckskin jacket, beaded with fringes.\u2026 And my\nmom did beautiful work, and I was really proud of my clothes. And when I got to residen-\ntial school, that first day I remember, they stripped us of our clothes.\u201d18 On her arrival at\nthe Presbyterian school in Kenora, Ontario, Lorna Morgan was wearing \u201cthese nice lit-\ntle beaded moccasins that my grandma had made me to wear for school, and I was very\nproud of them.\u201d She said they were taken from her and thrown in the garbage.19\nGilles Petiquay, who attended the Pointe Bleue school, was shocked by the fact that\neach student was assigned a number. \u201cI remember that the first number that I had at the\nresidential school was 95. I had that number\u201495\u2014for a year. The second number was\nnumber 4. I had it for a longer period of time. The third number was 56. I also kept it for a\nlong time. We walked with the numbers on us.\u201d20\nOlder brothers were separated from younger brothers, older sisters were separated\nfrom younger sisters, and brothers and sisters were separated from each other. Wilbur\nAbrahams climbed up the steps to the Alert Bay school behind his sisters and started fol-\nlowing them to the girls\u2019 side of the school. Then, he felt a staff member pulling him by the\near, telling him to turn the other way. \u201cI have always believed that, I think at that particular\nmoment, my spirit left.\u201d21\nWhen Peter Ross was enrolled at the Immaculate Conception school in Aklavik,\nNorthwest Territories, it was the first time he had ever been parted from his sisters. He\nsaid that in all the time he was at the school, he was able to speak with them only at\nChristmas and on Catholic feast days.22 Daniel Nanooch recalled that he talked with his The history \u2022 13\nsister only four times a year at the Wabasca,\nAlberta, school. \u201cThey had a fence in the\nplayground. Nobody was allowed near the\nfence. The boys played on this side, the\ngirls played on the other side. Nobody was\nallowed to go to that fence there and talk to\nthe girls through the fence or whatever, you\ncan\u2019t.\u201d23\nThe only reason Bernice Jacks had\nwanted to go to residential school was to be\nwith her older sister. But once she was there,\nshe discovered they were to sleep in sep-\narate dormitories. On the occasions when\nshe slipped into the older girls\u2019 dormitory\nand crawled into her sister\u2019s bed, her sister\nscolded her and sent her away: \u201cMy sister\nnever talked to me like that before.\u201d24 Helen\nKakekayash\u2019s older sister tried to comfort\nher when she first arrived at the McIntosh,\nOntario, school. She recalled that \u201cshe\nThe strict segregation of the sexes at the schools meant\nwould try to talk to me, and she would get that brothers and sisters were quickly separated from one\nspanked.\u201d25 Bernard Catcheway said that another. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada,\nP7538-635.\neven though he and his sister were both\nattending the Pine Creek school, they could\nnot communicate with each other. \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to her, I couldn\u2019t wave at her. If you did\nyou\u2019d get, you know a push in the head by a nun.\u201d26 On her second day at the Kamloops\nschool in British Columbia, Julianna Alexander went to speak to her brother. \u201cDid I ever\nget a good pounding and licking, get over there, you can\u2019t go over there, you can\u2019t talk to\nhim, you know. I said, \u2018Yeah, but he\u2019s my brother.\u2019\u201d27\nTaken from their homes, stripped of their belongings, and separated from their sib-\nlings, residential school children lived in a world dominated by fear, loneliness, and lack\nof affection.\nWilliam Herney, who attended the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia, recalled the\nfirst few days in the school as being frightening and bewildering. \u201cWithin those few days,\nyou had to learn, because otherwise you\u2019re gonna get your head knocked off. Anyway, you\nlearned everything. You learned to obey. And one of the rules that you didn\u2019t break, you\nobey, and you were scared, you were very scared.\u201d28 Raymond Cutknife recalled that when\nhe attended the Hobbema school in Alberta, he \u201clived with fear.\u201d29 Of his years in two dif-\nferent Manitoba schools, Timothy Henderson said, \u201cEvery day was, you were in constant\nfear that, your hope was that it wasn\u2019t you today that we\u2019re going to, that was going to be 14 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthe target, the victim. You know, you weren\u2019t going to have to suffer any form of humilia-\ntion.\u201d30 Shirley Waskewitch said that in Kindergarten at the Catholic school in Onion Lake,\nSaskatchewan, \u201cI learned the fear, how to be so fearful at six years old. It was instilled in\nme.\u201d31\nAt the Fort Alexander, Manitoba, school, Patrick Bruyere used to cry himself to sleep.\n\u201cThere was, you know, a few nights I remember that I just, you know, cried myself to sleep,\nI guess, because of, you know, wanting to see my mom and dad.\u201d32 Ernest Barkman, who\nattended the Pine Creek school, recalled, \u201cI was really lonely and I cried a lot, my brother\nwho was with me said I cried a lot.\u201d33 Paul Dixon, who attended schools in Qu\u00e9bec and\nOntario, said that at night, children tried to weep silently. \u201cIf one child was caught crying,\neh, oh, everybody was in trouble.\u201d34 Betsy Annahatak grew up in Kangirsuk, in northern\nQu\u00e9bec, which was then known as Payne Bay. When her parents were on the land, she\nlived in a small hostel in the community. \u201cWhen one person would start crying, all the, all\nthe little girls would start crying; all of us. We were different ages. And we would cry like\nlittle puppies or dogs, right into the night, until we go to sleep; longing for our families.\u201d35\nStudents\u2019 hearts were hardened. Rick Gilbert remembered the Williams Lake, British\nColumbia, school as a loveless place. \u201cThat was one thing about this school was that when\nyou got hurt or got beat up or something, and you started crying, nobody comforted you.\nYou just sat in the corner and cried and cried till you got tired of crying then you got up\nand carried on with life.\u201d36 Nick Sibbeston, who was placed in the Fort Providence school\nin the Northwest Territories at the age of five, recalled it as a place where children hid\ntheir emotions. \u201cIn residential school you quickly learn that you should not cry. If you cry\nyou\u2019re teased, you\u2019re shamed out, you\u2019re even punished.\u201d37 One former student said that\nduring her time at the Sturgeon Landing school in Saskatchewan, she could not recall a\nstaff member ever smiling at a child.38 Jack Anawak recalled of his time at Chesterfield\nInlet, in what is now Nunavut, in the 1950s that \u201cthere was no love, there was no feelings, it\nwas just supervisory.\u201d39 Lydia Ross, who attended the Cross Lake school in Manitoba, said,\n\u201cIf you cried, if you got hurt and cried, there was no, nobody to, nobody to comfort, com-\nfort you, nobody to put their arms.\u201d40 Stephen Kakfwi, who attended Grollier Hall in Inuvik\nand Grandin College in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, said this lack of compassion\naffected the way students treated one another. \u201cNo hugs, nothing, no comfort. Everything\nthat, I think, happened in the residential schools, we picked it up: we didn\u2019t get any hugs;\nyou ain\u2019t going to get one out of me I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d41 Victoria McIntosh said that life at\nthe Fort Alexander, Manitoba, school taught her not to trust anyone. \u201cYou learn not to cry\nanymore. You just get harder. And yeah, you learn to shut down.\u201d42\nThese accounts all come from statements made by former residential school students\nto the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. These events all took place in\nCanada within the realm of living memory. Like previous generations of residential school\nchildren, these children were sent to what were, in most cases, badly constructed, poorly\nmaintained, overcrowded, unsanitary fire traps. Many children were fed a substandard The history \u2022 15\ndiet and given a substandard education, and worked too hard. For far too long, they died\nin tragically high numbers. Discipline was harsh and unregulated; abuse was rife and\nunreported. It was, at best, institutionalized child neglect.\nThe people who built, funded, and operated the schools offered varying justifications\nfor this destructive intrusion into the lives of Aboriginal families. Through it, they wished\nto turn the children into farmers and farmers\u2019 wives. They wanted the children to aban-\ndon their Aboriginal identity and come to know the Christian god. They feared that if the\nchildren were not educated, they would be a menace to the social order of the country.\nCanadian politicians wished to find a cheap way out of their long-term commitments to\nAboriginal people. Christian churches sought government support for their missionary\nefforts. The schools were part of the colonization and conversion of Aboriginal people, and\nwere intended to bring civilization and salvation to their children. These were the ratio-\nnales that were used to justify making the lives of so many children so unhappy.\nThe imperial context\nThe whole part of the residential school was a part of a bigger scheme of colonization.\nThere was intent; the schools were there with the intent to change people, to make\nthem like others and to make them not fit.\nAnd today, you know, we have to learn to decolonize.\n\u2014 Shirley Flowers, Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\nof Canada43\nThe mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada requires it to\nreport on \u201cthe history, purpose, operation and supervision\u201d of Canada\u2019s residential\nschools. These schools were part of a process that brought European states and Christian\nchurches together in a complex and powerful manner. The history of the schools can\nbe best understood in the context of this relationship between the growth of global,\nEuropean-based empires and the Christian churches. Starting in the sixteenth century,\nEuropean states gained control of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands throughout the world. It was\nan era of mass migration. Millions of Europeans arrived as colonial settlers in nearly every\npart of the world. Millions of Africans were transported in the European-led slave trade,\nin which coastal Africans collaborated. Traders from India and China spread throughout\nthe Red Sea and Indian Ocean, bringing with them indentured servants whose lives were\nlittle different from those of slaves.44 The activities of explorers, farmers, prospectors, trad-\ning companies, or missionaries often set the stage for expansionary wars, the negotiation\nand the breaking of Treaties, attempts at cultural assimilation, and the exploitation and\nmarginalization of the original inhabitants of the colonized lands.45 Over time, Indigenous 16 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the British Empire spanned the globe.

The Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas gave Spain, and ulti-\nmately all of Europe, access to the resources of North and South America. This not only\nenriched the Old World, but it also unleashed an unceasing wave of migration, trade,\nconquest, and colonization.47 It marked the beginning of the creation of a European-\ndominated global economy. Although it was led initially by Spain and Portugal, this era of\nimperial expansion came to be directed by Holland, France, and, in the end, most stun-\nningly by Britain.48\nEmpires were established militarily. They engaged in extensive and violent wars with\none another, maintained a military presence on their frontiers, and conducted innumer-\nable military campaigns to put down nationalist uprisings.49 Colonies were established to The history \u2022 17\nbe exploited economically. The benefits of empire could come directly as taxes, as precious\nmetals, or as raw materials for industries in the homeland. Colonies often were required to\npurchase their imports solely from the homeland, making them a captive market.50\nThe mere presence of Indigenous people in these newly colonized lands blocked set-\ntler access to the land.51 To gain control of the land of Indigenous people, colonists nego-\ntiated Treaties, waged wars of extinction, eliminated traditional landholding practices,\ndisrupted families, and imposed a political and spiritual order that came complete with\nnew values and cultural practices.52 Treaty promises often went unfulfilled. United States\nGeneral William Tecumseh Sherman is quoted as having said, \u201cWe have made more than\none thousand treaties with the various Indian tribes, and have not kept one of them.\u201d In\ncommenting on Sherman\u2019s statement in 1886, C. C. Painter, a critic of American Indian\npolicy, observed that the United States had\nnever intended to keep them. They were not made to be kept, but to serve a present\npurpose, to settle a present difficulty in the easiest manner possible, to acquire a de-\nsired good with the least possible compensation, and then to be disregarded as soon\nas this purpose was tainted and we were strong enough to enforce a new and more\nprofitable arrangement.53\nThe outcome was usually disastrous for Indigenous people, while the chief bene-\nficiaries of empire were the colonists and their descendants. Many of the colonies they\nsettled grew to be among the most prosperous societies in the late nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century world.54 Settler colonies often went on to gain political inde-\npendence. In the case of Canada and the United States of America, these newly created\nnations spread across North America. As they expanded, they continued to incorporate\nIndigenous peoples and their lands into empires. Colonialism remains an ongoing pro-\ncess, shaping both the structure and the quality of the relationship between the settlers\nand Indigenous peoples.\nAt their height, the European empires laid claim to most of the earth\u2019s surface and con-\ntrolled the seas.55 Numerous arguments were advanced to justify such extravagant inter-\nventions into the lands and lives of other peoples. These were largely elaborations on two\nbasic concepts: 1) the Christian god had given the Christian nations the right to colonize\nthe lands they \u2018discovered\u2019 as long as they converted the Indigenous populations; and 2)\nthe Europeans were bringing the benefits of civilization (a concept that was intertwined\nwith Christianity) to the \u2018heathen.\u2019 In short, it was contended that people were being colo-\nnized for their own benefit, either in this world or the next.\nIn the fifteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church, building on the traditions of the\nRoman Empire, conceived of itself as the guardian of a universal world order.56 The adop-\ntion of Christianity within the Roman Empire (which defined itself as \u2018civilized\u2019) reinforced\nthe view that to be civilized was to be Christian. The Catholic papacy was already playing\na role in directing and legitimizing colonialism prior to Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages 18 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nto the Americas in the 1490s, largely by granting Catholic kingdoms the right to colonize\nlands they \u2018discovered.\u201957 In 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued the first of four orders, referred\nto as \u201cpapal bulls\u201d (a term that takes its name from the Latin word for the mould used to\nseal the document), that granted most of North and South America to Spain, the king-\ndom that had sponsored Columbus\u2019s voyage of the preceding year. These orders helped\nshape the political and legal arguments that have come to be referred to as the \u201cDoctrine\nof Discovery,\u201d which was used to justify the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth\ncentury. In return, the Spanish were expected to convert the Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas to Christianity.58\nOther European rulers rejected the Pope\u2019s ability to give away sovereignty over half the\nworld.59 But they did not necessarily reject the Doctrine of Discovery\u2014they simply modi-\nfied it. The English argued that a claim to \u2018discovered lands\u2019 was valid if the \u2018discoverer\u2019 was\nable to take possession of them.60 Harman Verelst, who promoted the colonization in the\neighteenth century of what is now the southern coast of the United States, wrote that \u201cthis\nRight arising from the first discovery is the first and fundamental Right of all European\nNations, as to their Claim of Lands in America.\u201d61 This Doctrine of Discovery was linked to\na second idea: the lands being claimed were terra nullius\u2014no man\u2019s land\u2014and therefore\nopen to claim. On the basis of this concept, the British government claimed ownership of\nthe entire Australian continent. (There, the doctrine of terra nullius remained the law until\nit was successfully challenged in court in 1992.)62 Under this doctrine, imperialists could\nargue that the presence of Indigenous people did not void a claim of terra nullius, since the\nIndigenous people simply occupied, rather than owned, the land. True ownership, they\nclaimed, could come only with European-style agriculture.63\nUnderlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization\nto savage people who could never civilize themselves. The \u2018civilizing mission\u2019 rested on a\nbelief of racial and cultural superiority. European writers and politicians often arranged\nracial groups in a hierarchy, each with their own set of mental and physical capabilities.\nThe \u2018special gifts\u2019 of the Europeans meant it was inevitable that they would conquer the\nlesser peoples. Beneath the Europeans, in descending order, were Asians, Africans, and\nthe Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia. Some people held that Europeans\nhad reached the pinnacle of civilization through a long and arduous process. In this view,\nthe other peoples of the world had been held back by such factors as climate, geography,\nand migration. Through a civilizing process, Europeans could, however, raise the people\nof the world up to their level. This view was replaced in the nineteenth century by a racism\nthat chose to cloak itself in the language of science, and held that the peoples of the world\nhad differing abilities. Some argued that, for genetic reasons, there were limits on the abil-\nity of the less-developed peoples to improve. In some cases, it was thought, contact with\nsuperior races could lead to only one outcome: the extinction of the inferior peoples.64\nThese ideas shaped global policies towards Indigenous peoples. In 1883, Britain\u2019s Lord\nRosebery, a future British prime minister, told an Australian audience, \u201cIt is on the British The history \u2022 19\nA Church Missionary Society school, in Freetown, Sierra Leone. In the nineteenth century, European-based missionary\nsocieties established residential schools around the world in an effort to spread the Christian gospel and civilize the\n\u2018heathen.\u2019 Mary Evans Picture Library, 10825826.\nrace, whether in Great Britain, or the United States, or the Colonies, or wherever it may be,\nthat rest the highest hopes of those who try to penetrate the dark future, or who seek to\nraise and better the patient masses of mankind.\u201d65 Residential schools were established in\nthe shadow of these ideas. In the year that Rosebery gave this speech, the Canadian gov-\nernment opened its first industrial residential school for Aboriginal people at Battleford on\nthe Canadian Prairies.66\nThe Christian churches not only provided the moral justification for the colonization\nof other peoples\u2019 lands, but they also dispatched missionaries to the colonized nations\nin order to convert \u2018the heathen.\u2019 From the fifteenth century on, the Indigenous peoples\nof the world were the objects of a strategy of spiritual and cultural conquest that had its\norigins in Europe. While they often worked in isolation and under difficult conditions,\nmissionaries were representatives of worldwide organizations that enjoyed the backing of\ninfluential individuals in some of the most powerful nations of the world, and which came\nto amass considerable experience in transforming different cultures.67 Residential schools\nfigured prominently in missionary work, not only in Canada, but also around the world.\nChristian missionaries played a complex but central role in the European colonial\nproject. Their presence helped justify the extension of empires, since they were visibly\nspreading the word of God to the heathen. If their efforts were unsuccessful, the mission-\naries might conclude that those who refused to accept the Christian message could not\nexpect the protection of the church or the law, thus clearing the way for their destruction.68\nAlthough missionaries often attempted to soften the impact of imperialism, they were also 20 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\ncommitted to making the greatest changes in the culture and psychology of the colonized.\nThey might, for example, seek to have traders give fair prices and to have government offi-\ncials provide relief in times of need, but they also worked to undermine relationships to\nthe land, language, religion, family relations, educational practices, morality, and social\ncustom.69\nMissionary zeal was also fuelled by the often violent division that had separated the\nChristian world into Catholic and Protestant churches. Both Catholics and Protestants\ninvested heavily in the creation of missionary organizations that were intended to engage\noverseas missionary work. The most well-known Catholic orders were the Franciscans,\nthe Jesuits, and the Oblates. The Oblates originally focused their attention on the poor and\nworking classes of France, but from the 1830s onwards, they engaged in overseas mission-\nary work. They established themselves in eastern Canada, the Pacific Northwest, Ceylon,\nTexas, and Africa.70 The Oblates administered a majority of the Roman Catholic residential\nschools in Canada. They could not have done this work without the support of a number of\nfemale religious orders, most particularly the Sisters of Charity (the Grey Nuns), the Sisters\nof Providence, the Sisters of St. Anne, and the Missionary Oblate Sisters of the Sacred Heart\nand of Mary Immaculate.\nThe British-based Church Missionary Society was also a global enterprise. By the mid-\ndle of the nineteenth century, this Anglican society had missions across the globe in such\nplaces as India, New Zealand, West and East Africa, China, and the Middle East. The soci-\nety\u2019s Highbury College in London provided missionaries with several years of training in\narithmetic, grammar, history, geography, religion, education, and the administration of\nschools.71 By 1901, the Church Missionary Society had an annual income of over 300,000\npounds. It used this money to support 510 male missionaries, 326 unmarried females, and\n365 ordained pastors around the world.72\nThe Catholics and Anglicans were not the only European-based missionary societies to\ntake up work in Canada. Presbyterians and Methodists, originally drawing support from\nthe United Kingdom, undertook missionary work among Aboriginal people in the early\nnineteenth century. On the coast of Labrador, members of the Moravian Brotherhood, an\norder that had its origins in what is now the Czech Republic, carried out missionary work\nfrom the early eighteenth century onwards.73 Protestant missionary work also depended\non the often underpaid and voluntary labour of missionary wives and single women who\nhad been recruited by missionary societies.\nMissionaries viewed Aboriginal culture as a barrier to both spiritual salvation and the\nongoing existence of Aboriginal people. They were determined to replace traditional eco-\nnomic pursuits with European-style peasant agriculture. They believed that cultural trans-\nformation required the imposition of social control and separation from both traditional\ncommunities and European settlements. In the light of these beliefs, it is not surprising\nthat they were proponents of an educational world that separated children from the influ-\nences of their families and cultures, imposed a new set of values and beliefs, provided a The history \u2022 21\nbasic elementary education, and created institutions whose daily life reflected Europe\u2019s\nemerging work discipline. In short, they sought to impose the foreign and transforming\nworld of the residential school.\nColonization was undertaken to meet the perceived needs of the imperial powers. The\njustification offered for colonialism\u2014the need to bring Christianity and civilization to\nthe Indigenous peoples of the world\u2014may have been a sincerely and firmly held belief,\nbut as a justification for intervening in the lives of other peoples, it does not stand up to\nlegal, moral, or even logical scrutiny. The papacy had no authority to give away lands\nthat belonged to Indigenous people. The Doctrine of Discovery cannot serve as the basis\nfor a legitimate claim to the lands that were colonized, if for no other reason than that\nthe so-called discovered lands were already well known to the Indigenous peoples who\nhad inhabited them for thousands of years. The wars of conquest that took place to strip\nIndigenous peoples of their lands around the globe were not morally just wars; Indigenous\npeoples were not, as colonists often claimed, subhuman, and neither were they living in\nviolation of any universally agreed-upon set of values. There was no moral imperative\nto impose Christianity on the Indigenous peoples of the world. They did not need to be\n\u2018civilized\u2019; indeed, there is no hierarchy of societies. Indigenous peoples had systems that\nwere complete unto themselves and met their needs. Those systems were dynamic; they\nchanged over time and were capable of continued change.74 Taken as a whole, the colo-\nnial process relied for its justification on the sheer presumption of taking a specific set of\nEuropean beliefs and values and proclaiming them to be universal values that could be\nimposed upon the peoples of the world. This universalizing of European values\u2014so cen-\ntral to the colonial project\u2014that was extended to North America served as the prime justi-\nfication and rationale for the imposition of a residential school system on the Indigenous\npeoples of Canada.\nResidential schools in pre-Confederation Canada\nIn Canada, residential schooling was closely linked to colonization and missionary cru-\nsades. The first boarding school for Aboriginal people in what is now Canada was estab-\nlished in the early seventeenth century near the French trading post at the future site of\nQu\u00e9bec City. At this Roman Catholic school, missionaries hoped to both \u2018civilize\u2019 and\n\u2018Christianize\u2019 young Aboriginal boys.75 The school was a failure: parents were reluctant\nto send their children, and the students were quick to run away and return home.76 Later\nefforts in New France met with no greater success.77 After the British conquest of New\nFrance in 1763, the idea of residential schooling lay dormant until the early nineteenth\ncentury. In the first decade of that century, the New England Company, a British-based\nmissionary society, funded a boarding school operation in Sussex Vale, New Brunswick.\nThe goals were to teach young Mi\u2019kmaq and Maliseet children trades and to convert them 22 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nto Protestantism.78 In the 1820s, John West,\nan Anglican missionary from England,\nopened a boarding school for Aboriginal\nstudents at Red River.79 Although these\nefforts also failed to take root, in 1834, the\nMohawk Institute, a mission school on the\nGrand River in what is now Ontario, began\ntaking in boarders.80 This school would\nremain in operation until 1970.81\nIn 1847, Egerton Ryerson, the super-\nintendent of schools for Upper Canada,\nrecommended the establishment of res-\nidential schools in which Aboriginal\nstudents would be given instruction in\n\u201cEnglish language, arithmetic, elementary\ngeometry, or knowledge of forms, geogra-\nphy and the elements of general history,\nnatural history and agricultural chem-\nKahkewaquonaby (Sacred Feathers), also known as Peter\nistry, writing, drawing and vocal music,\nJones, in 1832.

In this their object is identical with that of every good common school.\u201d Pupils\nshould be \u201ctaught agriculture, kitchen gardening, and mechanics, so far as mechanics is\nconnected with making and repairing the most useful agricultural implements.\u201d83\nAfter the release of Ryerson\u2019s report, Methodist missionaries operated a number of\nboarding schools in southern Ontario in the 1850s.84 One of them, the Mount Elgin school\nat Munceytown (later, Muncey), did not close until 1946.85 The first of what would be a\nstring of Roman Catholic residential schools in what is now British Columbia opened in\nthe early 1860s.86 A school in Fort Providence in what is now the Northwest Territories\nbegan taking in students in 1867.87\nThe colonization of the Northwest\nAfter the Canadian state was established in 1867, the federal government began making\nsmall per-student grants to many of the church-run boarding schools. Federal government\ninvolvement in residential schooling did not begin in earnest until the 1880s. The catalyst\nfor this expansion was the 1870 transfer of much of contemporary Alberta, Saskatchewan, The history \u2022 23\nManitoba, northern Qu\u00e9bec, northern Ontario, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut\nfrom the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to the Canadian government. The following year, British\nColumbia was brought into Confederation by the promise of a continental rail link.\nCanadian politicians intended to populate the newly acquired lands with settlers\nfrom Europe and Ontario. These settlers were expected to buy goods produced in central\nCanada and ship their harvests by rail to western and eastern ports and then on to inter-\nnational markets. Settling the \u201cNorthwest\u201d\u2014as this territory came to be known\u2014in this\nmanner meant colonizing the over 40,000 Indigenous people who lived there.88\nThe Rupert\u2019s Land Order of 1870, which transferred much of the Northwest to Canadian\ncontrol, required that \u201cthe claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required\nfor purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equita-\nble principles which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the\naborigines.\u201d89 These principles had been set down in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which\nplaced limits on the conditions under which Aboriginal land could be transferred. \u201cIf at\nany Time any of the Said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said Lands,\u201d they\ncould do so, but land could be sold only to the Crown, and the sale had to be at a meet-\ning of Indians that had been held specifically for that purpose.90 The Royal Proclamation,\nin effect, ruled that any future transfer of \u2018Indian\u2019 land would take the form of a Treaty\nbetween sovereigns.91 In this, it stands as one of the clearest and earliest expressions of\nwhat has been identified as a long-standing element of Canadian Aboriginal policy.92\nTo enable the colonization of the Northwest, in 1871, the federal government began\nnegotiating the first in a series of what came to be termed as \u201cNumbered Treaties\u201d with the\nFirst Nations of western and northern Canada. The only alternative to negotiating Treaties\nwould have been to ignore the legal obligations of the Rupert\u2019s Land Order and attempt\nto subdue the First Nations militarily, but that would have been a very costly proposition.\nIn 1870, when the entire Canadian government budget was $19 million, the United States\nwas spending more than that\u2014$20 million a year\u2014on its Indian Wars alone. Despite all\nthese pressures, the government took a slow and piecemeal approach to Treaty making.93\nThrough the Treaties, Aboriginal peoples were seeking agricultural supplies and train-\ning as well as relief during periods of epidemic or famine in a time of social and eco-\nnomic transition.94 They saw the Treaty process as establishing a reciprocal relationship\nthat would be lasting.95 The goal was to gain the skills that would allow them to continue\nto control their own destinies and retain their culture and identity as Aboriginal people.\nAs Ahtahkakoop (Star Blanket) said, \u201cWe Indians can learn the ways of living that made\nthe white man strong.\u201d96 The provisions varied from Treaty to Treaty, but they generally\nincluded funds for hunting and fishing supplies, agricultural assistance, yearly payments\nfor band members (annuities), and an amount of reserve lands based on the population\nof the band.97 First Nations never asked for residential schools as part of the Treaty pro-\ncess, and neither did the government suggest that such schools would be established. The\neducation provisions also varied in different Treaties, but promised to pay for schools on 24 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe signing of Treaty 1 at Lower Fort Garry, 1871. To gain control of the land of Indigenous people, colonists negotiated\nTreaties, waged wars of extinction, eliminated traditional landholding practices, disrupted families, and imposed new\npolitical and spiritual order that came complete with new values and cultural practices.

The federal government was slow to live up to its Treaty obligations.\nFor example, many First Nations were settled on reserves that were much smaller than\nthey were entitled to, while others were not provided with any reserve.98 Some obligations\nremain unfulfilled to this day. The commitment to establish on-reserve schools was also\nignored in many cases. As a result, parents who wished to see their children educated were\nforced to send them to residential schools.99 The history \u2022 25\nThe assimilation policy\nFrom the Canadian government\u2019s perspective, the most significant elements in the\nTreaties were the written provisions by which the First Nations agreed to \u201ccede, release,\nsurrender, and yield\u201d their land to the Crown.100 In the Treaty negotiations, however, fed-\neral officials left the impression that the government intended the Treaties to establish a\npermanent relationship with First Nations. Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris told\nthe Cree in 1876, \u201cWhat I trust and hope we will do is not for to-day and tomorrow only;\nwhat I will promise, and what I believe and hope you will take, is to last as long as the sun\nshines and yonder river flows.\u201d101 In reality, the federal government policy was very differ-\nent from what Morris said. The intent of the government\u2019s policy, which was firmly estab-\nlished in legislation at the time that the Treaties had been negotiated, was to assimilate\nAboriginal people into broader Canadian society. At the end of this process, Aboriginal\npeople were expected to have ceased to exist as a distinct people with their own govern-\nments, cultures, and identities.\nThe federal Indian Act, first adopted in 1876, like earlier pre-Confederation legislation,\ndefined who was and who was not an \u2018Indian\u2019 under Canadian law.102 The Act also defined\na process through which a person could lose status as an Indian. Women, for example,\ncould lose status simply by marrying a man who did not have status. Men could lose status\nin a number of ways, including graduating from a university. Upon giving up their status,\nindividuals also were granted a portion of the band\u2019s reserve land.103\nFirst Nations people were unwilling to surrender their Aboriginal identity in this man-\nner. Until 1920, other than women who involuntarily lost their Indian status upon mar-\nriage to a non-status individual, only 250 \u2018Indians\u2019 voluntarily gave up their status.104 In\n1920, the federal government amended the Indian Act to give it the power to strip indi-\nviduals of their status against their will. In explaining the purpose of the amendment to\na parliamentary committee, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Duncan Campbell Scott said\nthat \u201cour object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been\nabsorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department\nthat is the whole object of this Bill.\u201d105 The other major element in the bill that Scott was\nreferring to empowered the government to compel parents to send their children to resi-\ndential schools. Residential schooling was always more than simply an educational pro-\ngram: it was an integral part of a conscious policy of cultural genocide.\nFurther evidence of this assault on Aboriginal identity can be found in amendments\nto the Indian Act banning a variety of Aboriginal cultural and spiritual practices. The two\nmost prominent of these were the west-coast Potlatch and the Prairie Thirst Dance (often\nreferred to as the \u201cSun Dance\u201d).106 Residential school principals had been in the forefront\nof the campaign to ban these ceremonies, and also urged the government to enforce the\nbans once they were put in place.107 26 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThis \u201cSun Dance\u201d ceremony was one of the Aboriginal spiritual practices outlawed by the federal government in the\nnineteenth century. Library and Archives Canada, Trueman, C-0104106.\nThe Aboriginal right to self-government was also undermined. The Indian Act gave the\nfederal government the authority to veto decisions made by band councils and to depose\nchiefs and councillors. The Act placed restrictions on First Nations farmers\u2019 ability to\nsell their crops and take out loans. Over the years, the government also assumed greater\nauthority as to how reserve land could be disposed of: in some cases, entire reserves were\nrelocated against the will of the residents. The Indian Act was a piece of colonial legislation\nby which, in the name of \u2018protection,\u2019 one group of people ruled and controlled another.\nThe industrial school initiative\nIt was in keeping with this intent to assimilate Aboriginal peoples and, in the process,\nto eliminate its government-to-government relationship with First Nations that the federal\ngovernment dramatically increased its involvement in residential schooling in the 1880s.\nIn December 1878, J. S. Dennis, the deputy minister of the Department of the Interior,\nprepared a memorandum for Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald on the country\u2019s The history \u2022 27\nAboriginal policy. Dennis advised Macdonald that the long-term goal should be to instruct\n\u201cour Indian and half-breed populations\u201d in farming, raising cattle, and the mechanical\ntrades, rendering them self-sufficient. This would pave the way \u201cfor their emancipation\nfrom tribal government, and for their final absorption into the general community.\u201d\nDennis argued that residential schools were key to fulfilling these goals. It was his opinion\nthat in a short time, schools might become \u201cself-sustaining institutions.\u201d108\nIn the following year, Nicholas Davin, a failed Conservative candidate, carried out a\nbrief study of the boarding schools that the United States government had established for\nNative Americans. He recommended that Canada establish a series of such schools on the\nPrairies. Davin acknowledged that a central element of the education provided at these\nschools would be directed towards the destruction of Aboriginal spirituality. Since all civ-\nilizations were based on religion, it would be inexcusable, he thought, to do away with\nAboriginal faith \u201cwithout supplying a better [one].\u201d For this reason, he recommended that\nwhile the government should fund the schools, the churches should operate them.109\nThe decision to continue to rely on the churches to administer the schools on a day-to-\nday basis had serious consequences. The government constantly struggled, and failed, to\nassert control over the churches\u2019 drive to increase the number of schools they operated.\nAt various times, each denomination involved in school operation established boarding\nschools without government support or approval, and then lobbied later for per capita\nfunding. When the churches concluded, quite legitimately, that the per capita grant they\nreceived was too low, they sought other types of increases in school funding. Building\non their network of missions in the Northwest, the Catholics quickly came to dominate\nthe field, usually operating twice as many schools as did the Protestant denominations.\nAmong the Protestant churches, the Anglicans were predominant, establishing and main-\ntaining more residential schools than the Methodists or the Presbyterians. The United\nChurch, created by a union of Methodist and Presbyterian congregations, took over most\nof the Methodist and Presbyterian schools in the mid-1920s. Presbyterian congregations\nthat did not participate in the union established the Presbyterian Church in Canada and\nretained responsibility for two residential schools. In addition to these national denomi-\nnations, a local Baptist mission ran a residence for Aboriginal students in Whitehorse in\nthe 1940s and 1950s, and a Mennonite ministry operated three schools in northwestern\nOntario in the 1970s and 1980s. Each faith, in its turn, claimed government discrimination\nagainst it. Competition for converts meant that churches sought to establish schools in\nthe same locations as their rivals, leading to internal divisions within communities and\nexpensive duplication of services.\nThe model for these residential schools for Aboriginal children, both in Canada and\nthe United States, did not come from the private boarding schools to which members of\nthe economic elites in Britain and Canada sent their children. Instead, the model came\nfrom the reformatories and industrial schools that were being constructed in Europe and\nNorth America for the children of the urban poor. The British parliament adopted the 28 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe Qu\u2019Appelle school at Lebret in what is now Saskatchewan opened in 1884. O.B. Buell, Library and Archives Canada,\nPA-182246.\nReformatory Schools Act in 1854 and the Industrial Schools Act in 1857.110 By 1882, over\n17,000 children were in Britain\u2019s industrial schools.111 Under Ontario\u2019s 1880 Act for the\nProtection and Reformation of Neglected Children, a judge could send children under the\nage of fourteen to an industrial school, where they might be required to stay until they\nturned eighteen.112 Such schools could be dangerous and violent places. At the Halifax\nBoys Industrial School, first offenders were strapped, and repeat offenders were placed in\ncells on a bread-and-water ration. From there, they might be sent to the penitentiary.113\nThe Canadian government also drew inspiration from the United States. There, the first\nin a series of large-scale, government-operated, boarding schools for Native Americans\nopened in 1879 in a former army barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.114\nOn the basis of Davin\u2019s report and developments in the United States, the federal gov-\nernment decided to open three industrial schools. The first one opened in Battleford in\nwhat is now Saskatchewan in 1883. It was placed under the administration of an Anglican\nminister. The following year, two more industrial schools opened: one at Qu\u2019Appelle in\nwhat is now Saskatchewan, and one at High River in what is now Alberta. Both these\nschools were administered by principals nominated by the Roman Catholic Oblate order.\nThe federal government not only built these schools, but it also assumed all the costs\nof operating them. Recruiting students for these schools was difficult. According to the\nIndian Affairs annual report, in 1884, there were only twenty-seven students at the three\nschools.115 The history \u2022 29\nUnlike the church-run boarding schools, which provided a limited education with a\nheavy emphasis on religious instruction, the industrial schools were intended to prepare\nFirst Nations people for integration into Canadian society by teaching them basic trades,\nparticularly farming. Generally, industrial schools were larger than boarding schools, were\nlocated in urban areas, and, although church-managed, usually required federal approval\nprior to construction. The boarding schools were smaller institutions, were located on\nor near reserves, and provided a more limited education. The differences between the\nindustrial schools and the boarding schools eroded over time. By the 1920s, the federal\ngovernment ceased to make any distinction between them, referring to them simply as\n\u201cresidential schools.\u201d\nIn justifying the investment in industrial schools to Parliament in 1883, Public Works\nMinister Hector Langevin argued that\nif you wish to educate these children you must separate them from their parents\nduring the time that they are being educated. If you leave them in the family they\nmay know how to read and write, but they still remain savages, whereas by separating\nthem in the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes\u2014it is to be hoped only\nthe good tastes\u2014of civilized people.116\nThe federal government entered into residential schooling at a time when it was colo-\nnizing Aboriginal lands in western Canada. It recognized that, through the Treaties, it had\nmade commitments to provide Aboriginal people with relief in periods of economic dis-\ntress. It also feared that as traditional Aboriginal economic pursuits were marginalized or\neliminated by settlers, the government might be called upon to provide increased relief. In\nthis context, the federal government chose to invest in residential schooling for a number\nof reasons. First, it would provide Aboriginal people with skills that would allow them to\nparticipate in the coming market-based economy. Second, it would further their political\nassimilation. It was hoped that students who were educated in residential schools would\ngive up their status and not return to their reserve communities and families. Third, the\nschools were seen as engines of cultural and spiritual change: \u2018savages\u2019 were to emerge as\nChristian \u2018white men.\u2019 There was also a national security element to the schools. Indian\nAffairs official Andsell Macrae observed that \u201cit is unlikely that any Tribe or Tribes would\ngive trouble of a serious nature to the Government whose members had children com-\npletely under Government control.\u201d117 Duncan Campbell Scott succinctly summarized\nIndian Affairs\u2019 goals for the schools in 1909: \u201cIt includes not only a scholastic education,\nbut instruction in the means of gaining a livelihood from the soil or as a member of an\nindustrial or mercantile community, and the substitution of Christian ideals of conduct\nand morals for aboriginal concepts of both.\u201d118 The achievement of such invasive and\nambitious goals would require a substantial level of funding. This was never forthcoming. 30 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nFunding: The dream of self-supporting schools\nIn announcing the construction of the three initial industrial schools, Indian\nCommissioner Edgar Dewdney said that although the starting costs would be high, he\ncould see no reason why the schools would not be largely self-supporting in a few years,\ndue to the skills in farming, raising stock, and trades that were being taught to the stu-\ndents.119 In supporting an Anglican proposal for two industrial schools in Manitoba, Indian\nAffairs Deputy Minister Lawrence Vankoughnet wrote to Prime Minister Macdonald that\nit would be \u201cwell to give a Grant of money annually to each school established by any\nDenomination for the industrial training of Indian children.\u201d He said that system worked\nwell in Ontario, and it \u201ccosts the Government less than the whole maintenance of the\nSchool would cost and it enlists the sympathies and assistance of the religious denomina-\ntions in the education and industrial training of the Indian children.\u201d120\nThe government believed that between the forced labour of students and the poorly\npaid labour of missionaries, it could operate a residential school system on a nearly cost-\nfree basis. The missionaries and the students were indeed a source of cheap labour\u2014but\nthe government was never happy with the quality of the teaching and, no matter how hard\nstudents worked, their labour never made the schools self-supporting. Soon after the gov-\nernment established the industrial schools, it began to cut salaries.121 Initially, the federal\ngovernment covered all the costs of operating the industrial schools. In 1891, this policy\nwas abandoned in favour of one by which schools received a fixed amount per student\n(referred to as a \u201cper capita grant\u201d).122 The system both intensified the level of competition\namong churches for students and encouraged principals to accept students who should\nhave been barred from admission because they were too young or too sick.123\nThe government never adequately responded to the belated discovery that the type\nof residential school system that officials had envisioned would cost far more than pol-\niticians were prepared to fund. In the early twentieth century, chronic underfunding led\nto a health crisis in the schools and a financial crisis for the missionary societies. Indian\nAffairs, with the support of leading figures in the Protestant churches, sought to dramati-\ncally reduce the number of residential schools, replacing them with day schools. The gov-\nernment abandoned the plan when it failed to receive the full support of all the churches\ninvolved in the operation of the schools.124 Instead, in 1911, the federal government finally\nimplemented a significant increase to the per capita grant received by boarding schools\nand attempted to impose basic health standards for the schools. This resulted in a short-\nterm improvement. However, inflation eroded the value of the grant increase, and the\ngrant was actually reduced repeatedly during the Great Depression and at the start of the\nSecond World War.125\nFunding for residential schools was always lower than funding for comparable institu-\ntions in Canada and the United States that served the general population. In 1937, Indian\nAffairs was paying, on average, $180 a year per student. This was less than a third of the per The history \u2022 31\ncapita costs at that time for the Manitoba School for the Deaf ($642.40) and the Manitoba\nSchool for Boys ($550). In the United States, the annual per capita cost at the Chilocco\nIndian Residential School in Oklahoma in 1937 was $350. According to the American\nChild Welfare League, the per capita costs for well-run institutions in that country ranged\nbetween $313 and $541.126 It would not be until the 1950s that changes were made in the\nfunding system in Canada that were intended to ensure that the schools could recruit\nqualified teachers and improve the student diets.127 Even these improvements did not end\nthe inequity in residential school funding. In 1966, residential schools in Saskatchewan\nwere spending between $694 and $1,193 a year per student.128 Comparable child-welfare\ninstitutions in Canada were spending between $3,300 and $9,855 a year. In the United\nStates, the annual cost of residential care per child was between $4,500 and $14,059.129\nCompelling attendance\nIt was not until 1894 that the federal government put in place regulations relating to res-\nidential school attendance. Under the regulations adopted in that year, residential school\nattendance was voluntary. However, if an Indian agent or justice of the peace thought that\nany \u201cIndian child between six and sixteen years of age is not being properly cared for or\neducated, and that the parent, guardian or other person having charge or control of such\nchild, is unfit or unwilling to provide for the child\u2019s education,\u201d he could issue an order to\nplace the child \u201cin an industrial or boarding school, in which there may be a vacancy for\nsuch child.\u201d\nIf a child placed in the school under these regulations left a residential school without\npermission, or did not return at a promised time, school officials could get a warrant from\nan Indian agent or a justice of the peace authorizing them (or a police officer, truant offi-\ncer, or employee of the school or Indian Affairs) to \u201csearch for and take such child back\nto the school in which it had been previously placed.\u201d With a warrant, one could enter\u2014\nby force if need be\u2014any house, building, or place named in the warrant and remove the\nchild. Even without a warrant, Indian Affairs employees and constables had the authority\nto arrest a student in the act of escaping from a residential school and return the child to\nthe school.130\nIt was departmental policy that no child could be discharged without departmental\napproval\u2014even if the parents had enrolled the child voluntarily. The government had\nno legislative basis for this policy. Instead, it relied on the admission form that parents\nwere supposed to sign. (In some cases, school staff members signed these forms.)131 By\n1892, the department required that all parents sign an admission form when they enrolled\ntheir children in a residential school. In signing the form, parents gave their consent that\n\u201cthe Principal or head teacher of the Institution for the time being shall be the guardian\u201d\nof the child. In that year, the Department of Justice provided Indian Affairs with a legal 32 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nAboriginal family at the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school. Indian Affairs took the position that once parents enrolled their children\nin a residential school, only the government could determine when they would be discharged. General Synod Archives,\nAnglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S8-56.\nopinion to the effect that \u201cthe fact of a parent having signed such an application is not\nsufficient to warrant the forcible arrest against the parents\u2019 will of a truant child who has\nbeen admitted to an Industrial School pursuant to the application.\u201d It was held that, with-\nout legislative authority, no form could provide school administrators with the power of\narrest.132 Despite this warning, well into the twentieth century, Indian Affairs would con-\ntinue to enforce policies regarding attendance for which it had no legal authority.133 This\nis not the only example of the government\u2019s use of unauthorized measures. In the 1920s,\nstudents were to be discharged from residential school when they turned sixteen. Despite\nthis, William Graham, the Indian commissioner, refused to authorize discharge until the\nstudents turned eighteen. He estimated that, on this basis, he rejected approximately 100\napplications for discharge a year.134\nIn 1920, the Indian Act was amended to allow the government to compel any First\nNations child to attend residential school. However, residential school was never com-\npulsory for all First Nations children. In most years, there were more First Nations chil-\ndren attending Indian Affairs day schools than residential schools. During the early 1940s,\nthis pattern was reversed. In the 1944\u201345 school year, there were 8,865 students in resi-\ndential schools, and 7,573 students in Indian Affairs day schools. In that year, there were The history \u2022 33\nThe Roman Catholic school in Fort George, Quebec, opened in 1931. Desch\u00e2telets Archives.\nreportedly 28,429 school-aged Aboriginal children. This meant that 31.1% of the school-\naged Aboriginal children were in residential school.135\nRegulation\nThe residential school system operated with few regulations; those that did exist were\nin large measure weakly enforced. The Canadian government never developed anything\napproaching the education acts and regulations by which provincial governments admin-\nistered public schools. The key piece of legislation used in regulating the residential school\nsystem was the Indian Act. This was a multi-purpose piece of legislation that defined and\nlimited First Nations life in Canada. The Act contained no education-related provisions\nuntil 1884. There were no residential school\u2013specific regulations until 1894. These dealt\nalmost solely with attendance and truancy.\nIt was recognized by those who worked within the system that the level of regulation\nwas inadequate. In 1897, Indian Affairs education official Martin Benson wrote, \u201cNo regu-\nlations have been adopted or issued by the Department applicable to all its schools, as had\nbeen done by the Provincial Governments.\u201d136 The situation did not improve over time. The\neducation section of the 1951 Indian Act and the residential school regulations adopted in\n1953 were each only four pages in length.137 By comparison, the Manitoba Public Schools\nAct of 1954 was ninety-one pages in length.138 In addition to the Act, the Manitoba govern-\nment had adopted nineteen education-related regulations.139 34 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nIt is also apparent that many key people within the system had little knowledge of the\nexisting rules and regulations. In 1922, an Indian agent in Hagersville, Ontario, inquired\nof departmental headquarters if there had been any changes in the regulations regard-\ning education since the adoption of a set of education regulations in 1908. His question\nsuggests he was completely unaware of major changes to the Indian Act regarding edu-\ncation that had supplanted previous regulations in 1920.140 In 1926, J. K. Irwin, the newly\nappointed principal of the Gordon\u2019s school in Saskatchewan, discovered upon taking\noffice that he could not find any \u201claid down regulations as to the duties and powers of\na Principal of an Indian Boarding School.\u201d He wrote to Indian Affairs, asking for a copy\nof such regulations, since he wanted to know \u201cexactly what I am to do and what powers\nI have.\u201d141 Departmental secretary J. D. McLean informed him that \u201cthere are no printed\nregulations concerning the duties and powers of the principal of an Indian residential\nschool.\u201d142\nThe system was so unregulated that in 1968, after Canada had been funding residential\nschools for 101 years, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister J. A. MacDonald announced, \u201cFor the\nfirst time we have set down in a precise and detailed manner the criteria which is to be used\nin future in determining whether or not an Indian child is eligible for these institutions.\u201d143\nExpansion and decline\nFrom the 1880s onwards, residential school enrolment climbed annually. According\nto federal government annual reports, the peak enrolment of 11,539 was reached in the\n1956\u201357 school year.144 (For trends, see Graph 1.) Most of the residential schools were\nlocated in the northern and western regions of the country. With the exception of Mount\nElgin and the Mohawk Institute, the Ontario schools were all in northern or northwestern\nOntario. The only school in the Maritimes did not open until 1930.145 Roman Catholic and\nAnglican missionaries opened the first two schools in Qu\u00e9bec in the early 1930s.146 It was\nnot until later in that decade that the federal government began funding these schools.147\nThe number of schools began to decline in the 1940s. Between 1940 and 1950, for exam-\nple, ten school buildings were destroyed by fire.148 As Graph 2 illustrates, this decrease\nwas reversed in the mid-1950s, when the federal department of Northern Affairs and\nNational Resources dramatically expanded the school system in the Northwest Territories\nand northern Qu\u00e9bec. Prior to that time, residential schooling in the North was largely\nrestricted to the Yukon and the Mackenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories. Large res-\nidences were built in communities such as Inuvik, Yellowknife, Whitehorse, Churchill,\nand eventually Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay). This expansion was undertaken despite\nreports that recommended against the establishment of residential schools, since they\nwould not provide children with the skills necessary to live in the North, skills they other-\nwise would have acquired in their home communities.149 The creation of the large hostels The history \u2022 35\nGraph 1\nResidential school enrolment, 1869\u201370 to 1965\u201366\nNumber of students\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n1869\u201370 1884\u201385 1899\u201300 1914\u201315 1929\u201330 1944\u201345 1959\u201360\nSource: Indian Affairs and Northern Affairs annual reports.

General Synod Archives, Anglican\nChurch of Canada, P8454-66.\nwas accompanied by the opening of what were termed \u201csmall hostels\u201d in the smaller and\nmore remote communities of the eastern Arctic and the western Northwest Territories.\nPolicy towards M\u00e9tis and Inuit students\nMany of the early advocates of residential schooling in Canada expected that the\nschools would take in both Aboriginal children who had status under the Indian Act (in\nother words, they were Indians as defined by the Act) as well as Aboriginal children who,\nfor a variety of reasons, did not have status. The federal government classed these individ-\nuals alternately as \u201cnon-status Indians,\u201d \u201chalf-breeds,\u201d or \u201cM\u00e9tis.\u201d150\nThe early church-run boarding schools made no distinction between status and\nnon-status or M\u00e9tis children.151 The federal government position on the matter was con-\nstantly shifting. It viewed the M\u00e9tis as members of the \u2018dangerous classes\u2019 whom the resi-\ndential schools were intended to civilize and assimilate.152 This view led to the adoption of The history \u2022 37\nM\u00e9tis children at the Dawson City, Yukon, residence. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S8-264.\npolicies that allowed for the admission of M\u00e9tis children to the schools at various times.153\nHowever, from a jurisdictional perspective, the federal government believed that the\nresponsibility for educating and assimilating M\u00e9tis people lay with provincial and terri-\ntorial governments. There was a strong concern that if the federal government began pro-\nviding funding for the education of some of the children the provinces and territories were\nresponsible for, it would find itself subject to having to take responsibility for the rest.154\nWhen this view dominated, Indian agents would be instructed to remove M\u00e9tis students\nfrom residential schools.155\nDespite their perceived constitutional responsibility, provincial and territorial govern-\nments were reluctant to provide services to M\u00e9tis people. They did not ensure that there\nwere schools in M\u00e9tis communities, or work to see that M\u00e9tis children were admitted and\nwelcomed into the general public school system.156 Many M\u00e9tis parents who wished to see\ntheir children educated in schools had no option but to try to have them accepted into a\nresidential school. In some cases, these would be federally funded schools, but, in other\ncases, M\u00e9tis students attended church-run schools or residences that did not receive fed-\neral funding.157\nProvincial governments slowly began to provide increased educational services to\nM\u00e9tis students after the Second World War. As a result, M\u00e9tis children lived in residences\nand residential schools that were either run or funded by provincial governments. The\nM\u00e9tis experience is an important reminder that the impacts of residential schooling\nextend beyond the formal residential school program that Indian Affairs operated.158 38 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nInuit children were recruited to a school in Shingle Point in the Yukon in the 1920s. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of\nCanada, P9901-589.\nPrior to the 1950s, most of the students who attended schools in the Northwest Territories\nwere either First Nations or M\u00e9tis. As late as 1949, only 111 Inuit students were receiving\nfull-time schooling in the North.159 The hostel system that Northern Affairs established in\nthe Northwest Territories in the mid-1950s did not restrict admission to First Nations stu-\ndents. It was only at this point that large numbers of Inuit children began attending resi-\ndential schools. The impact of the schools on the Inuit was complex. Some children were\nsent to schools thousands of kilometres from their homes, and went years without seeing\ntheir parents. In other cases, parents who had previously been supporting themselves by\nfollowing a seasonal cycle of land- and marine-based resource harvesting began settling\nin communities with hostels so as not to be separated from their children.\nBecause of the majority of the Aboriginal population in two of the three northern terri-\ntories, the per capita impact of the schools in the North is higher than anywhere else in the\ncountry. And, because the history of these schools is so recent, not only are there many liv-\ning Survivors today, but there are also many living parents of Survivors. For these reasons,\nboth the intergenerational impacts and the legacy of the schools, the good and the bad, are\nparticularly strongly felt in the North. The history \u2022 39\nThe integration policy\nBy 1945, the Indian Affairs residential school system, starved for funding for fifteen\nyears, was on the verge of collapse.160 Not only was the existing Indian Affairs education\nsystem lacking money and resources, but also there were no school facilities of any sort\nfor 42% of the school-aged First Nations children.161 Having concluded that it was far too\nexpensive to provide residential schooling to these students, Indian Affairs began to look\nfor alternatives. One was to expand the number of Indian Affairs day schools. From 1945\u2013\n46 to 1954\u201355, the number of First Nations students in Indian Affairs day schools increased\nfrom 9,532 to 17,947.162 In 1949, the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of\nCommons Appointed to Examine and Consider The Indian Act recommended \u201cthat wher-\never and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other\nchildren.\u201d163 In 1951, the Indian Act was amended to allow the federal government to enter\ninto agreements with provincial governments and school boards to have First Nations stu-\ndents educated in public schools.164 By 1960, the number of students attending \u201cnon-In-\ndian\u201d schools (9,479) had surpassed the number living in residential schools (9,471).165\nThe transfer of First Nations students into the public school system was described as \u201cinte-\ngration.\u201d By then, the overall policy goal was to restrict the education being given in Indian\nAffairs schools to the lower grades. Therefore, it was expected that during the course of\ntheir schooling, at least half of the students then in Indian Affairs schools would transfer\nto a \u2018non-Indian\u2019 school.166\nThe integration policy was opposed by some of the church organizations. Roman\nCatholic church officials argued that residential schooling was preferable for three rea-\nsons: 1) teachers in public schools were not prepared to deal with Aboriginal students; 2)\nstudents in public schools often expressed racist attitudes towards Aboriginal students;\nand 3) Aboriginal students felt acute embarrassment over their impoverished conditions,\nparticularly in terms of the quality of the clothing they wore and the food they ate.167 These\nwere all issues that students and parents raised, as well.168\nChild-welfare facilities\nFrom the 1940s onwards, residential schools increasingly served as orphanages and\nchild-welfare facilities. By 1960, the federal government estimated that 50% of the children\nin residential schools were there for child-welfare reasons. What has come to be referred to\nas the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d\u2014the dramatic increase in the apprehension of Aboriginal children\nfrom the 1960s onwards\u2014was in some measure simply a transferring of children from\none form of institution, the residential school, to another, the child-welfare agency.169 The\nschools were not funded or staffed to function as child-welfare institutions. They failed to\nprovide their students with the appropriate level of personal and emotional care children 40 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nneed during their childhood and adolescence. This failure applied to all students, but\nwas of particular significance in the case of the growing number of social-welfare place-\nments in the schools.170 Some children had to stay in the schools year-round because it\nwas thought there was no safe home to which they could return. The residential school\nenvironment was not a safer or more loving haven. These children spent their entire child-\nhoods in an institution.\nThe closure of residential schools, which commenced in earnest in 1970, was accompa-\nnied by a significant increase in the number of children being taken into care by child-wel-\nfare agencies.171 By the end of the 1970s, the transfer of children from residential schools\nwas nearly complete in southern Canada, and the impact of the Sixties Scoop was in evi-\ndence across the country. In 1977, Aboriginal children accounted for 44% of the children\nin care in Alberta, 51% of the children in care in Saskatchewan, and 60% of the children\nin care in Manitoba.172 In those residences that remained in operation, the percentage of\nsocial-welfare cases remained high.173\nThe road to closure, 1969\nIn 1968, the federal government drastically restructured the residential school system\nby dividing the schools into residences and day schools, each with a principal or admin-\nistrator.174 In June of the following year, the federal government took direct control over all\nthe schools in southern Canada.175 Because churches were allowed to continue to appoint\nthe residence administrators, their presence continued in many schools in the coming\nyears. They were, however, no longer directly responsible for the facilities.176 In 1969, the\nfederal government also began to transfer the hostels and day schools in the Yukon and\nNorthwest Territories to their respective territorial governments. Most of the small hos-\ntels in the eastern Arctic and Nunavik (Arctic Qu\u00e9bec) were closed by the end of 1971.\n(Four small hostels were also operated in the western and central Arctic. The last of these,\nlocated at Cambridge Bay, did not close until the late 1990s.)177\nHaving assumed control over the southern Canadian schools in 1969, the federal gov-\nernment commenced what would prove to be a protracted process of closing the system\ndown. According to the Indian Affairs annual report for 1968\u201369, the department was\nresponsible for sixty residences. Two years later, the number was down to forty-five.178\nThe government takeover of the residential schools also coincided with the release of the\nfederal government\u2019s White Paper on \u201cIndian Policy.\u201d This document proposed a massive\ntransfer of responsibility for First Nations people from the federal to provincial govern-\nments.179 It called for the repeal of the Indian Act, the winding up of the Department of\nIndian Affairs, and the eventual extinguishment of the Treaties.180 The recently formed\nNational Indian Brotherhood (nib) described the White Paper as a document intended to\nbring about \u201cthe destruction of a Nation of People by legislation and cultural genocide.\u201d181 The history \u2022 41\nIn its response, the nib proposed \u201cIndian Control of Indian Education.\u201d182 In 1971, Indian\nAffairs Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien announced that, in the face of First Nations resistance, the\nfederal government was abandoning the policy directions outlined in the White Paper.183\nBy then, First Nations communities had already taken over one residential school. In\nthe summer of 1970, parents of children at the Blue Quills, Alberta, school occupied the\nschool, demanding that its operation be turned over to a First Nations education author-\nity. They took this measure in response to reports that the school was to be turned into\na residence and their children were to be educated at a nearby public school. The Blue\nQuills conflict was the result of both long-standing local dissatisfaction with the admin-\nistration of the school and First Nations opposition to the policy of integration.184 It was\nestimated that over 1,000 people participated in the sit-in, with rarely fewer than 200 peo-\nple being at the school on any given day.185 Seventeen days after the sit-in commenced,\nMinister Jean Chr\u00e9tien announced that the school would be transferred to the Blue Quills\nNative Education Council.186 In coming years, the Qu\u2019Appelle, Prince Albert, Duck Lake,\nLestock, and Grayson facilities in Saskatchewan were also taken over by First Nations\nauthorities. The Christie residence in Tofino, British Columbia, was also operated briefly\nby an Aboriginal authority.187\nThe federal government, however, remained committed to the closing of the facilities.\nBecause of the government\u2019s lengthy history of underfunding residential schools, many\nof the schools were in poor repair. Between 1995 and 1998, the last seven residences in\nsouthern Canada were closed.188\nStarting in the 1970s, territorial governments, in which former residential school stu-\ndents were serving as cabinet ministers, also began expanding the number of day schools\nas part of a campaign to close residential schools in the North. The last large hostel in\nthe Yukon closed in 1985.189 By 1986, there were only three large hostels operating in the\nNorthwest Territories.190 Grollier Hall, the last large hostel in the North, closed in 1997.191\nIf one dates the residential school system back to the early 1830s, when the Mohawk\nInstitute first took in boarders, the system had been in operation for over 160 years. The\nclosing of the schools did not mark the end of the history of residential schooling in\nCanada. By the 1990s, former students had begun to make Canadians aware of the tre-\nmendous harm that the residential school experience had caused to Aboriginal people\nand Aboriginal communities. 42 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe classroom in the Moose Factory, Ontario, school. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P7538-970.\nThe school experience\nEducation: \u201cThe children\u2019s work was merely memory work.\u201d\nAs educational institutions, the residential schools were failures, and regularly judged\nas such. In 1923, former Regina industrial school principal R. B. Heron delivered a paper\nto a meeting of the Regina Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church that was highly criti-\ncal of the residential school system. He said that parents generally were anxious to have\ntheir children educated, but they complained that their children \u201care not kept regularly\nin the class-room; that they are kept out at work that produces revenue for the School;\nthat when they return to the Reserves they have not enough education to enable them to\ntransact ordinary business\u2014scarcely enough to enable them to write a legible letter.\u201d192\nThe schools\u2019 success rate did not improve. From 1940\u201341 to 1959\u201360, 41.3% of each year\u2019s\nresidential school Grade One enrolment was not promoted to Grade Two.193 Just over half\nof those who were in Grade Two would get to Grade Six.194\nMany principals and teachers had low expectations of their students. Wikwemikong,\nOntario, principal R. Baudin wrote in 1883, \u201cWhat we may reasonably expect from the The history \u2022 43\nMembers of the Croiss\u00e9s, a religious society for youth at the Fort Frances, Ontario, school.

Good and moral\nas they may be, they lack great mental capacity.\u201d He did not think it wise to expect them\nto \u201cbe equal in every respect to their white brethren.\u201d195 In preparing a 1928 report on the\nAnglican school at Onion Lake, a Saskatchewan government school inspector expressed\nhis belief that \u201cin arithmetic abstract ideas develop slowly in the Indian child.\u201d196 Some\nthought it was a risky matter to give the students too much education. Mount Elgin prin-\ncipal S. R. McVitty wrote in 1928 that \u201cclassroom work is an important part of our training,\nbut not by any means the most important.\u201d He added, \u201cIn the case of the Indian \u2018a little\nlearning is a dangerous thing.\u2019\u201d197\nMuch of what went on in the classroom was simply repetitious drill. A 1915 report on\nthe Roman Catholic school on the Blood Reserve in Alberta noted, \u201cThe children\u2019s work\nwas merely memory work and did not appear to be developing any deductive power,\naltogether too parrot like and lacking expression.\u201d198 A 1932 inspector\u2019s report from the\nGrayson, Saskatchewan, school suggests there had been little change. \u201cThe teaching as I\nsaw it today was merely a question of memorizing and repeating a mass of, to the children,\n\u2018meaningless\u2019 facts.\u201d199\nThe classrooms were often severely overcrowded. At the Qu\u2019Appelle school in 1911,\nSister McGurk had seventy-five girls in her junior classroom. The inspector of Roman\nCatholic schools reported to Ottawa that this was an \u201calmost impossible\u201d situation.200\nIn 1915, two teachers were responsible for 120 students at the Coqualeetza Institute in\nChilliwack, British Columbia.201 In 1928, there were sixty students in the junior classroom\nat the Alberni, British Columbia, school.202 44 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe Indian Affairs schools branch maintained that the principals and the staff were\n\u201cappointed by the church authorities, subject to the approval of the Department as to\nqualifications.\u201d203 In reality, the churches hired staff and the government then automati-\ncally approved their selections.204 The churches placed a greater priority on religious com-\nmitment than on teaching ability.205 Because the pay was so low, many of the teachers\nlacked any qualification to teach.206 In 1908, Indian Affairs inspector F. H. Paget reported\nthat at the Battleford school, \u201cfrequent changes in the staff at this school has not been\nto its advantage.\u201d The problem lay not with the principal, but with the fact that \u201cmore\nprofitable employment is available in the District and, furthermore, the salaries paid are\nnot as high as are paid in other public institutions.\u201d207 When a British Columbia Indian\nagent recommended that schools be required to hire only qualified staff, he was told by\nhis superior, British Columbia Indian Superintendent A. W. Vowell, that such a require-\nment would result in the churches\u2019 applying for \u201clarger grants.\u201d And, as Vowell understood\nit, Indian Affairs \u201cis not at present disposed to entertain requests for increased grants to\nIndian boarding and industrial schools.\u201d208 In 1955, 55 (23%) of the 241 teachers in resi-\ndential schools directly employed by Indian Affairs had no teacher\u2019s certificate.209 In 1969,\nIndian Affairs reported it was still paying its teachers less than they could make in provin-\ncial schools. \u201cAs a result, there are about the same number of unqualified teachers, some\n140, in federal schools [residential and non-residential] now, as ten years ago.\u201d210\nIn the minds of some principals, religious training was the most valuable training the\nschools provided. In 1903, Brandon, Manitoba, principal T. Ferrier wrote that \u201cwhile it is\nvery important that the Indian child should be educated, it is of more importance that he\nshould build up a good clean character.\u201d Such a heavy emphasis was required, in Ferrier\u2019s\nopinion, to \u201ccounteract the evil tendencies of the Indian nature.\u201d211 Louise Moine recalled\nthat religious instruction and observation were a constant part of life at the Qu\u2019Appelle\nschool in the early twentieth century: \u201cFrom the time we got out of bed at the sound of the\nbell, we went down on our knees to pray. After we had washed and dressed, we headed\nfor the chapel to attend Low mass which was always held at 7 a.m.\u201d212 The staff handbook\nfor the Presbyterian school in Kenora in the 1940s stated it was expected that, upon leav-\ning the school, most students would \u201creturn to the Indian Reserves from which they had\ncome.\u201d Given this future, staff members were told that \u201cthe best preparation we can give\nthem is to teach them the Christian way of life.\u201d213\nNot surprisingly, many of those who succeeded academically followed careers in the\nchurch. Coqualeetza graduate Peter Kelly became a Methodist Church minister. Emmanuel\nCollege graduate Edward Ahenakew became an Anglican minister. Others worked for gov-\nernment or taught school. Qu\u2019Appelle graduate Daniel Kennedy became an interpreter\nand general assistant for the Assiniboine Indian Agency. Joseph Dion, a graduate of the\nOnion Lake school, taught school for many years in Saskatchewan. Still others pursued\nbusiness and professional careers. After attending the Mohawk Institute, Beverly Johnson\nwent to Hellmuth College in London, Ontario, where he excelled at sports and drama. He The history \u2022 45\nthen went to work for the New York Life Insurance Company in Pennsylvania. A graduate\nof the Mohawk Institute, N. E. Lickers, was called to the bar in 1938 and was described by\nthe Branford Expositor as the \u201cFirst Ontario Indian Lawyer.\u201d 214\nDespite these successes, little encouragement generally was offered to students who\nwished to pursue further education. Oliver Martin, who was raised on the Six Nations\nReserve in Ontario and went on to become an Ontario magistrate, recalled being told by\nIndian Affairs Deputy Minister Duncan Campbell Scott: \u201cIt\u2019s no use sending you Indians\nto school you just go back to the reserve anyway.\u201d215\nFor many students, classroom life was foreign and traumatic. David Charleson said he\nfound the regimentation at the Christie, British Columbia, school so disturbing that he\n\u201cnever wanted to learn, so I jumped into my shell. I took Kindergarten twice because of\nwhat happened to me. I didn\u2019t want to learn.\u201d216 At the Birtle school in Manitoba, Isabelle\nWhitford said, she had a hard time adjusting to the new language and the classroom dis-\ncipline. \u201cEvery time I couldn\u2019t get an answer, like, you know, she would pull my ears and\nshake my head.\u201d217 Betsy Olson described class work at the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,\nschool as a torment, in which her \u201cspelling was always 30, 40, it was way down. And when\nwe did spelling, sometimes I freeze, I couldn\u2019t move, I just scribbled because I couldn\u2019t\nmove my hand.\u201d218 Leona Agawa never felt comfortable in the classroom at the Spanish,\nOntario, school. For much of her time in school, she was frightened or intimidated. \u201cI\u2019d\nhear my name, but I never got to answer. I stood up, never got to answer what they were\nsaying when they sat me down. And I\u2019d get a good slap after, after you, you leave there for\nnot being nice in school.\u201d219\nSince the 1920s, Indian Affairs had required residential schools to adopt provincial\ncurricula.220 The department had also asked provincial governments to have their school\ninspectors inspect Indian Affairs schools.221 The wisdom of this practice had been ques-\ntioned during the hearings of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of\nCommons inquiry into the Indian Act in the 1940s. Andrew Moore, a secondary school\ninspector for the Province of Manitoba, told the committee members that Indian Affairs\ntook full responsibility for all aspects of First Nations education, including curriculum.222\nProvincial education departments, including the one he worked for, were \u201cnot organized\nor not interested in Indian schools.\u201d223\nIn 1963, D. W. Hepburn, the former principal of the federal school in Inuvik, published\nan article with the ominous headline \u201cNorthern Education: Fa\u00e7ade for Failure.\u201d He argued\nthat the education being provided in the new federal schools was \u201chopelessly inadequate.\nThe reasons for this failure are clear: the aims of education set forth by the Department are\nthoroughly confused, the curriculum is inappropriate, and many current practices of the\nsystem are not only ill-conceived but actually harmful.\u201d224 Although 60% of the students at\nthe Inuvik school were in the first three grades, few teachers had any background in pri-\nmary education, and \u201calmost none has any special training in native education, and will\nreceive none from the Department.\u201d225 The schools were producing individuals who \u201clack 46 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nnot only the skills required for most permanent wage employment but also those neces-\nsary for the traditional economy.\u201d226\nThe decision to leave curriculum to provincial education departments meant that\nAboriginal students were subjected to an education that demeaned their history, ignored\ntheir current situation, and did not even recognize them or their families as citizens. This\nwas one of the reasons for the growing Aboriginal hostility to the Indian Affairs integra-\ntion policy. An examination of the treatment of Aboriginal people in provincially approved\ntextbooks reveals a serious and deep-rooted problem. In response to a 1956 recommenda-\ntion that textbooks be developed that were relevant to Aboriginal students, Indian Affairs\nofficial R. F. Davey commented, \u201cThe preparation of school texts is an extremely difficult\nmatter.\u201d It was his opinion that \u201cthere are other needs which can be met more easily and\nshould be undertaken first.\u201d227 In the following years, assessments of public-school text-\nbooks showed that they continued to perpetuate racist stereotypes of Aboriginal people.228\nA 1968 survey pointed out that in some books, the word squaw was being used to describe\nAboriginal women, and the word redskins used to describe Aboriginal people.229\nStudents also noted that the curriculum belittled their ancestry. Mary Courchene said,\n\u201cTheir only mandate was to Christianize and civilize; and it\u2019s written in black and white.\nAnd every single day we were reminded.\u201d230 Lorna Cochrane could never forget an illustra-\ntion in a social studies text. \u201cThere was a picture of two Jesuits laying in the snow, they were\nmurdered by these two \u2018savages.\u2019 And they had this what we call \u2018a blood-curdling look\u2019 on\ntheir faces is how I remember that picture.\u201d231 When the curriculum was not racist, it was\nbewildering and alienating. Many students could not identify with the content of the class-\nroom materials. For instance, Lillian Elias remembers that \u201cwhen I looked at Dick and Jane\nI thought Dick and Jane were in heaven when I saw all the green grass. That\u2019s how much I\nknew about Dick and Jane.\u201d232\nSome students said that the limits of the education they had received in residential\nschool became apparent when they were integrated into the public school system.233\nMany said there was no expectation that they would succeed. Walter Jones never forgot\nthe answer that a fellow student at the Alberni, British Columbia, school was given when\nhe asked if he would be able to go to Grade Twelve. \u201cThat supervisor said, \u2018You don\u2019t need\nto go that far,\u2019 he says. He says, \u2018Your people are never going to get education to be a pro-\nfessional worker, and it doesn\u2019t matter what lawyer, or doctor, or electrician, or anything,\nthat a person has to go to school for.\u2019\u201d234\nSome northern schools developed reputations for academic success. Grandin College\nin Fort Smith was established originally to recruit young people for the Catholic minis-\ntry. A new principal, Jean Pochat, decided to focus on providing young men and women\nwith leadership training.235 The school became known as a \u201cleadership factory,\u201d produc-\ning numerous future government leaders for the North.236 Students who attended the\nChurchill Vocational Centre spoke about how they were taught by open-minded teachers\nwho were willing to expose them to the social and political changes taking place across the The history \u2022 47\nGrandin College in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, developed a positive reputation as a \u201cleadership factory\u201d for the\nNorth. Desch\u00e2telets Archives.\nworld in the 1960s.237 John Amagoalik wrote that at the Churchill Vocational Centre, \u201cwe\nhad excellent teachers. To this day we still talk about them.... They treated us as ordinary\npeople. We had never experienced this sort of attitude before and it was, in a way, liberat-\ning to be with new teachers that treated you as their equal.\u201d238 David Simailak spoke of how\nhis time at residential school gave him a series of new opportunities. He fondly remembers\nexcelling at math and spelling competitions, and travelling to Montreal for Expo \u201967.239\nSpecific teachers were remembered with gratitude. When Roddy Soosay lived in res-\nidence, he attended a local public school. He credited his high school principal at the\nPonoka, Alberta, public school for pushing him to succeed.240 Martha Loon said that at the\nPoplar Hill, Ontario, school in the 1980s, there were staff members who befriended and\nhelped her and her siblings. There was one staff member to whom she could tell all her\nproblems. \u201cI could say anything to her, and we\u2019d go for walks sometimes. So, I could tell\nher anything and she wouldn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t say anything to other staff members about it.\nSo, in a way, that\u2019s, you know, gave me a chance to express my frustrations, and the things\nthat I didn\u2019t like.\u201d241\nOther students were able to concentrate on their studies. Frederick Ernest Koe said\nthat at Stringer Hall in Inuvik, he devoted all his energies to his school work. \u201cYou kind of\ndevelop a protective mechanism on the shell that you didn\u2019t rat on anybody, you kind of\nbehave, you followed orders and things would go smooth.\u201d242 Madeleine Dion Stout suc-\nceeded academically at the Blue Quills school, but she did not credit the school for her\nsuccess. \u201cIt\u2019s not residential school that made me a good student. My, the fundamental 48 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nvalues and good example I had before I went to residential school by my grandfather and\nmy parents, and all the old people on the reserve where I grew up are the ones who made\nme a good student.\u201d243\nWork: \u201cNo idleness here.\u201d\nStudent education was further undermined by the amount of work the students had\nto do to support the schools. Because Indian Affairs officials had anticipated that the res-\nidential schools would be self-sufficient, students were expected to raise or grow and pre-\npare most of the food they ate, to make and repair much of their clothing, and to maintain\nthe schools. As a result, most of the residential schools operated on what was referred to\nas the \u201chalf-day system.\u201d Under this system\u2014which amounted to institutionalized child\nlabour\u2014students were in class for half the day and in what was supposed to be vocational\ntraining for the other half. Often, as many students, teachers, and inspectors observed, the\ntime allocated for vocational training was actually spent in highly repetitive labour that\nprovided little in the way of training. Rather, it served to maintain the school operations.\nThe half-day system was not a formally mandated system. Some schools did not use it,\nand those that did use it implemented it on their own terms. When, in 1922, Indian Affairs\neducation official Russell Ferrier recommended that the Chapleau, Ontario, school imple-\nment the half-day system, he had to rely on his memory of visits to other schools in order\nto describe how the system operated. Indian Affairs had no official written description of\nthe system.244 This is telling evidence of the haphazard way in which residential schools\nwere managed.\nWhile the half-day system was supposed to apply only to the older students, the real-\nity was that every student worked. Above and beyond the half-day that students spent in\nvocational training, it was not uncommon for them to perform daily chores both before\nand after school. As a result, students often spent more than half a day working for the\nschool. At High River, Alberta, in the 1880s, students who were not learning a trade were\nexpected to put in two hours a day of chores in the winter and four hours in the summer.\nAccording to Principal E. Claude, \u201cTo these youngest ones pertained the weeding of the\ngarden and the house work on their side of the school, and I must say, that this summer\nnone denied our watchword, \u2018No idleness here,\u2019 as all work was exclusively done by the\npupils.\u201d245\nFrom the time the schools were opened, parents and inspectors raised concerns about\njust how much work students were being required to do. Inspector T. P. Wadsworth claimed\nin 1884 that the boys at the Battleford school generally enjoyed their chores, but added\nthat he would protest \u201cagainst forcing these little fellows to haul water every day and all\nday from the river in winter, as was the case last year.\u201d246 In 1886, Qu\u2019Appelle school prin-\ncipal Joseph Hugonnard wrote, \u201cDuring the summer they have more manual labor and The history \u2022 49\nCarpenter\u2019s shop in the Battleford school, 1894. Saskatchewan Archives Board, R-B7.\nrecreation. The parents cannot understand that the pupils are here to learn how to work\nas well as to read and write, we therefore cannot at present devote too much time to the\nformer.\u201d247 Inspector Wadsworth returned to the issue of overwork in 1893, when he said\nthat much of the farm work at the Middlechurch, Manitoba, school was too much for the\nboys. The girls were also set to work in the laundry at a \u201ctender age.\u201d248 Gilbert Wuttunee,\nwho attended the Battleford school in the first decade of the twentieth century, recalled,\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do any farm work or any kind of work until you got to, at that time, standard\nthree, whether you were nine years old or fifteen years old.\u201d After he turned nine, he \u201cnever\nsaw another full day of school until I left.\u201d By then, the school had drastically reduced the\nnumber of trades it taught: \u201cThere was just blacksmithing, carpentering and farming.\u201d249\nAccording to Lillian Elias, each fall, a barge would arrive in Aklavik, loaded with logs for\nthe school furnace. The students would form a long chain leading from the barge to the\nfurnace room and, with the assistance of the school staff, unload the barge.250\nThe work was inadequately supervised and often dangerous. There are accounts of stu-\ndents\u2019 getting hands caught in power equipment in the school laundries, the kitchens,\nworkshops, and fields.251 Principals tended to place the blame on student carelessness and\nneglected to report such injuries to the government. Several injuries were recorded only\nafter the student\u2019s parents complained or the government received a bill for the hospital\ntreatment of a student.252 In December 1935, a mangle (a type of clothes wringer) at the\nQu\u2019Appelle school crushed several fingers on Florence McLeod\u2019s right hand, which were\namputated. The school principal, G. Leonard, stressed that \u201cthis mangle has been in use at 50 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nMount Elgin, Ontario, laundry room. Clothes wringers, such as the one shown here, were a source of injury at a number of\nresidential schools.

MacKenzie concluded that \u201call the necessary precautions were taken, and,\nwhile the accident to Florence McLeod is regretted, it was through no fault of the school\nmanagement.\u201d253 The school\u2019s failure to protect its students can be seen in the fact that\nMcLeod\u2019s father, Henry, had been injured in a similar fashion when he was a student at the\nsame school.254 In 1941, a twelve-year-old boy lost all the fingers on one hand in an acci-\ndent in the Brandon, Manitoba, school barn.255 Eight years later, fifteen-year-old Rodney\nBeardy died in a tractor accident at the same school.256 A student at the Edmonton school\nlost a foot in 1944 after an accident during the operation of a machine used in the prepa-\nration of fodder.257 Two boys from the Birtle, Manitoba, school were injured in a truck acci-\ndent in 1942. From Indian Affairs correspondence, it appears that the accident involved a\ntruck carrying seventy boys who were being taken from the school to the fields to do farm\nwork. Indian Affairs official R. A. Hoey criticized the principal for allowing the practice to\ntake place, noting that \u201cit is almost unbelievable that the principal should permit 70 pupils\nto be conveyed in a truck.\u201d258\nEven though the half-day system was supposedly eliminated in the early 1950s, students\ncontinued to be overworked.259 After Sam Ross ran away from the Birtle school in 1959, he\ntold Indian Affairs official J. R. Bell that he wanted to continue his education, but had been\nforced to work \u201ctoo hard\u201d at the school. He said that from September to Christmas of the The history \u2022 51\nprevious year, he had worked in the school barn every day between \u201c6:00 a.m. and 7:00\na.m. and from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. again at recess, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and had had\nto stoke up the furnace with coal at 10:00 o\u2019clock before retiring.\u201d Ross said that \u201che liked\nschool but not working like a hired hand.\u201d Bell recommended that the amount of student\nlabour being done at the Birtle school be investigated.260\nLanguage and culture: \u201cThe Indian language is\nindeed seldom heard in the institution.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s hostile approach to Aboriginal languages was reiterated in numer-\nous policy directives. In 1883, Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney instructed Battleford\nschool principal Thomas Clarke that great attention was to be given \u201ctowards impart-\ning a knowledge of the art of reading, writing and speaking the English language rather\nthan that of Cree.\u201d261 In 1889, Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs Lawrence Vankoughnet\ninformed Bishop Paul Durieu that in the new Cranbrook, British Columbia, school, meal-\ntime conversations were to be \u201cconducted exclusively in the English language.\u201d The prin-\ncipal was also to set a fixed time during which Aboriginal languages could be spoken.262\nIn 1890, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed proposed, \u201cAt the most the native language\nis only to be used as a vehicle of teaching and should be discontinued as such as soon as\npracticable.\u201d English was to be the primary language of instruction, \u201ceven where French is\ntaught.\u201d263 The Indian Affairs \u201cProgramme of Studies for Indian Schools\u201d of 1893 advised,\n\u201cEvery effort must be made to induce pupils to speak English, and to teach them to under-\nstand it; unless they do the whole work of the teacher is likely to be wasted.\u201d264\nPrincipals regularly reported on their success in suppressing Aboriginal languages.\nIn 1887, Principal E. Claude boasted that his thirty students at the High River school \u201call\nunderstand English passably well and few are unable to express themselves in English.\nThey talk English in recreation. I scarcely need any coercive means to oblige them to do\nso.\u201d265 In 1898, the Kamloops principal reported that \u201cEnglish is the only language used at\nall times by the pupils.\u201d266 That same year, the Mission, British Columbia, principal wrote,\n\u201cEnglish is the common language of the school, the Indian language is indeed seldom\nheard in the institution, except with the newly arrived pupils.\u201d267 The 1898 report from the\nprincipal of the Anglican school at Onion Lake indicated that the school was one of the few\nexceptions. There, the children were taught to \u201cread and write both Cree and English.\u201d268\nInspectors viewed the continued use of Aboriginal languages by the students as a sign of\nfailure. The principal of the Red Deer school was taken to task in 1903 by an inspector who\nfelt that a \u201cserious drawback to school work, as well as an evidence of bad discipline, was\nthe use of the Cree language, which was quite prevalent.\u201d269\nThis policy of language suppression continued well into the twentieth century. After a\n1935 tour of Canada, Oblate Superior General Th\u00e9odore Labour\u00e9 expressed concern over 52 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nInuit students at the Joseph Bernier School, Chesterfield Inlet, 1956. Diocese of Churchill-Hudson Bay.\nthe strict enforcement of prohibitions against speaking Aboriginal languages. In his opin-\nion, \u201cThe forbidding of children to speak Indian, even during recreation, was so strict in\nsome of our schools that any lapse would be severely punished\u2014to the point that children\nwere led to consider it a serious offense.\u201d270\nStudents had strong memories of being punished for \u2018speaking Indian.\u2019 Mary Angus,\nwho attended the Battleford school in the late nineteenth century, said that students\ncaught speaking their own language were given a close haircut: \u201cAll the hair cut to be as a\nman, that what they do, for us not to talk. We were afraid of that, to have our hair cut.\u201d271 At\nthe Fraser Lake school in British Columbia, Mary John said she could speak her own lan-\nguage only in whispers.272 Melvina McNabb was seven years old when she was enrolled in\nthe File Hills school, and \u201cI couldn\u2019t talk a word of English. I talked Cree and I was abused\nfor that, hit, and made to try to talk English.\u201d273 Raymond Hill, who was a student at the\nMohawk Institute in Brantford in the early years of the twentieth century, said, \u201cI lost my\nlanguage. They threatened us with a strapping if we spoke it, and within a year I lost all of\nit. They said they thought we were talking about them.\u201d274\nLanguage use often continued in secret. Mary Englund recalled that while Aboriginal\nlanguages were banned at the Mission school in the early twentieth century, children\nwould still speak it to one another.275 Clyde Peters said he stopped speaking his Aboriginal\nlanguage at the Mount Elgin school after he found out the school punished students for\ndoing so. \u201cI never got the strap for it but I was warned enough that I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Even after\nthat, he and his friends would speak to each other when they thought no one else could The history \u2022 53\nhear them. \u201cWhen we\u2019d go up in the dormitories in the evening I had a friend from Sarnia\nwho I could talk with.\u201d276\nMany of the students came to the school fluent in an Aboriginal language, with little\nor no understanding of French or English. This trend continued well into the post-war\nperiod. For these children, the first few months in the school were disorienting and fright-\nening. Arthur McKay arrived at the Sandy Bay, Manitoba, school in the early 1940s with no\nknowledge of English. \u201cThey told me not to speak my language and everything, so I always\npretended to be asleep at my desk so they wouldn\u2019t ask me anything.\u201d277 Peter Nakogee\nrecalled being punished for writing in his notebook in Cree syllabics at the Fort Albany,\nOntario, school.278\nMeeka Alivaktuk came to the Pangnirtung school in what is now Nunavut with no\nknowledge of English. When she failed to obey an instruction because she did not under-\nstand it, she was slapped on the hands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my education began.\u201d279 On his first\nday of school in Pangnirtung, the teacher overheard Sam Kautainuk speaking to a friend\nin Inuktitut. \u201cHe took a ruler and grabbed my head like this and then smacked me in the\nmouth with the ruler four times.\u201d280\nAt the Qu\u2019Appelle school in the mid-1960s, Greg Rainville said, he was punished for fail-\ning to carry out instructions given to him in a language he did not understand. \u201cThe nuns\nwould get frustrated with you when they talked to you in French or English, and you\u2019re\nnot knowing what they\u2019re talking about, and you\u2019re pulled around by the ear.\u201d281 At the\nShubenacadie school, a staff member once caught William Herney speaking Mi\u2019kmaq with\nhis brother. She strapped him and then washed his mouth out with soap.282 Alphonsine\nMcNeely underwent the same punishment at the Roman Catholic school at Aklavik in the\n1940s.283 Pierrette Benjamin said she was forced to eat soap at the La Tuque school. \u201cThe\nprincipal, she put it in my mouth, and she said, \u2018Eat it, eat it.\u2019\u201d284\nThe language policy disrupted families. When John Kistabish left the Amos, Qu\u00e9bec,\nschool, he could no longer speak Algonquin, and his parents could not speak French, the\nlanguage that he had been taught in the school. As a result, he found it almost impossible\nto communicate with them about the abuse he experienced at the school. \u201cI had tried to\ntalk with my parents, and, no, it didn\u2019t work.... We were well anyway because I knew that\nthey were my parents, when I left the residential school, but the communication wasn\u2019t\nthere.\u201d285\nCulture was attacked as well as language. In his memoirs, Stoney Chief John Snow tells\nof how at the Morley, Alberta, school, the \u201ceducation consisted of nothing that had any\nrelationship to our homes and culture. Indeed Stoney culture was condemned explicitly\nand implicitly.\u201d He recalled being taught that the only good people on earth were non-In-\ndians and, specifically, white Christians.286 Andrew Bull Calf recalled that at the residen-\ntial school in Cardston, Alberta, students were not only punished for speaking their own\nlanguages, but they also were discouraged from participating in traditional cultural activ-\nities.287 Evelyn Kelman recalled that the principal at the Brocket, Alberta, school warned 54 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nstudents that if they attended a Sun Dance that was to be held during the summer, they\nwould be strapped on their return to school.288 Marilyn Buffalo recalled being told by\nHobbema, Alberta, school staff that the Sun Dance was \u2018devil worship.\u2019289 One year, Sarah\nMcLeod returned to the Kamloops school with a miniature totem pole that a family mem-\nber had given her for her birthday. When she proudly showed it to one of the nuns, it was\ntaken from her and thrown out. She was told that it was nothing but devilry.290\nSchool officials did not limit their opposition to Aboriginal culture to the classroom. In\n1942, Gleichen, Alberta, principal John House became involved in a campaign to have two\nBlackfoot chiefs deposed, in part because of their support for traditional dance ceremo-\nnies.291 In 1943, F. E. Anfield, the principal of the Alert Bay, British Columbia, school, wrote\na letter encouraging former students not to participate in local Potlatches, implying that\nsuch ceremonies were based on outdated superstition, and led to impoverishment and\nfamily neglect.292\nEven when it did not directly disparage Aboriginal culture, the curriculum undermined\nAboriginal identity. Thaddee Andre, who attended the Sept-\u00celes, Qu\u00e9bec, school in the\n1950s, recalled how as a student he wanted \u201cto resemble the white man, then in the mean-\ntime, they are trying by all means to strip you of who you are as an Innu. When you are\nyoung, you are not aware of what you are losing as a human being.\u201d293\nIt was not until the 1960s that attitudes began to change about the place of Aboriginal\nlanguage and culture in residential schools.294 Alex Alikashuak said that at the Churchill\nschool, which operated in the 1960s, there were no restrictions on the use of Aboriginal\nlanguages. He recalled, \u201cThe only time, real time we spoke English was when we were in\nthe classroom, or we\u2019re talking to one of the administration staff, and or somebody from\ntown that\u2019s not Inuit, but otherwise we, everybody spoke our language.\u201d295 The Canadian\nWelfare Council\u2019s 1967 report on nine Saskatchewan residential schools described \u201can\nemphasis on relating course content to the Indian culture\u201d as \u201cimaginative\u201d and a sign\nof progress in \u201cmaking the educational experience meaningful for the Indian child.\u201d296 By\n1968, the Roman Catholic school in Cardston was incorporating Blackfoot into its educa-\ntional program.297 In some schools, Aboriginal teachers were brought in to teach dancing\nand singing.298 However, as late as the 1969\u201370 school year, there were only seven Indian\nAffairs schools that offered courses in Aboriginal languages or used Aboriginal languages\nas the language of instruction.299\nDespite the encouragement that was offered in some schools, and the students\u2019 efforts\nto keep their language alive, the overall impact was language loss. Of her experiences\nat the Baptist school in Whitehorse and the Anglican school in Carcross, Rose Dorothy\nCharlie said, \u201cThey took my language. They took it right out of my mouth. I never spoke\nit again.\u201d300 In some cases, the residential school experience led parents to decide not to\nteach their children an Aboriginal language. Both of Joline Huskey\u2019s parents attended res-\nidential school in the Northwest Territories. As a result of their experience in the schools, The history \u2022 55\nthey raised their daughter to speak English.301 When Bruce Dumont was sent to residential\nschool in Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, his mother warned him not to speak Cree.302\nArranging and blocking marriages\nThrough the residential schools, Indian Affairs and church officials sought to extend\ntheir control into the most intimate aspects of the lives of Aboriginal children. Indian\nAffairs officials believed that because the department had spent money educating stu-\ndents, it had gained the right to determine whom they married. Government officials\nfeared that if students married someone who had not also been educated at a residential\nschool, they would revert to traditional \u2018uncivilized\u2019 ways.303 The control of marriage was\npart of the ongoing policy of forced assimilation. In 1890, Indian Commissioner Hayter\nReed criticized Qu\u2019Appelle principal Joseph Hugonnard for allowing female students from\nthe Qu\u2019Appelle school to marry boys who had not gone to school, without first getting\nIndian Affairs\u2019 approval. Reed argued, \u201cThe contention that the parents have the sole right\nto decide such matters cannot for one moment be admitted.\u201d304\nThe government not only encouraged marriage between students, but it also began to\nmake marriage part of the process of getting out of residential school. In his annual report\nfor 1896, Deputy Minister Hayter Reed wrote, \u201cIt is considered advisable, where pupils are\nadvanced in years and considered capable of providing for themselves, to bring about a\nmatrimonial alliance, either at the time of being discharged from the school or as soon\nafter as possible.\u201d305 In other words, the principals were expected to arrange marriages for\nthe older students.\nPrincipals regularly reported and celebrated student marriages, and, indeed, did often\narrange them.306 Reverend P. Claessen, principal of the Kuper Island school, reported in\n1909 that he had succeeded in \u201cengaging one of our leaving girls with one of our best old\nboys.\u201d307 Kamloops school principal A. M. Carion reported, \u201cIt is gratifying to note again\nthat since my last report, two more couples of ex-pupils have been united in the bonds of\nholy wedlock. The ex-pupils who marry other ex-pupils are better able to retain the habits\nof civilized life, which they acquired at the school.\u201d308\nEfforts were also made to block marriages deemed to be unsuitable. In 1895, Indian\nagent Magnus Begg told members of the Blackfoot Reserve that \u201cno young man could\nmarry a girl from an Industrial or board [sic] School without having prepared a house with\ntwo rooms, and owning cows, with the necessary stabling, &c.\u201d309 In that same year, princi-\npals and Indian agents were instructed to seek departmental permission prior to allowing\nstudents to marry.310\nPrincipals continued to arrange marriages into the 1930s. In 1936, the principal of the\nRoman Catholic school at Onion Lake prepared a list of students who had turned sixteen\nand who, he believed, should not be discharged. He noted that he insisted on keeping 56 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthe students, since he would \u201calways try to marry them as soon as they leave the school.\u201d\nHe wanted to keep one eighteen-year-old student in the school until the fall threshing\nwas complete. Then, she would be married to a former pupil. He wanted to keep another\neighteen-year-old until \u201cshe gets married during the year.\u201d311 In 1922, the head of the\nPresbyterian Church\u2019s Winnipeg Committee on Indian Work urged the government to\nmake it \u201cunlawfull [sic] for a pupil or ex-pupil of the School to marry or be married without\nthe permission of the Indian Agent.\u201d The Presbyterians proposed that the children of such\nunauthorized marriages be denied Treaty annuities until they reached the age of twen-\nty-one and be prohibited from attending school.312 Although the measure was not adopted,\nit is reflective of the church\u2019s lack of respect for the autonomy of Aboriginal people.\nFood: \u201cAlways hungry\u201d\nIn his memoir of his years as a student at the Mount Elgin school in southern Ontario\nin the early twentieth century, Enos Montour wrote that the boys \u201cwere always hungry.\nGrub was the beginning and end of all conversations.\u201d313 According to Eleanor Brass, the\ndinners at the File Hills, Saskatchewan, school consisted \u201cof watery soup with no flavour,\nand never any meat.\u201d One winter, it seemed to her that they ate fish every day.314 In fair\nweather, the boys would trap gophers and squirrels, and roast them over open fires to sup-\nplement their meagre diets. Sometimes, they would share these treats with the girls at the\nschool.315 Mary John, who attended the Fraser Lake, British Columbia, school, recalled\nthat the meals were dull and monotonous: a regular diet of porridge interspersed with\nboiled barley and beans, and bread covered with lard. Weeks might go by without any\nfish or meat; sugar and jam were reserved for special occasions.316 A former student of\nthe Hay River school in the Northwest Territories recalled that in the years following the\nFirst World War, he \u201cdidn\u2019t see jam from the time I got off the boat to the time I got back on\nto come back down.\u201d317 Another student from that school recalled a constant diet of fish:\n\u201cThey would boil it up real good until the meat falls away, the bones and scales all floating\naround, then mix in flour and serve it up. I won\u2019t use flour for my dogs because there\u2019s not\nmuch good in it.\u201d318\nThe reports of government inspectors confirm these student memories. An 1895 report\non an inspection of the Middlechurch school concluded, \u201cThe \u2018bill of fare\u2019 is plain. I\nbelieved it to be barely sufficient for the older pupils, who have now, at fifteen to eighteen\nyears of age, larger apetites [sic] than they will have when older.\u201d319 In 1918, Indian agent\nJohn Smith inspected the Kamloops school and reported his \u201csuspicion that the vitality of\nthe children is not sufficiently sustained from a lack of nutritious food, or enough of the\nsame for vigorous growing children.\u201d320 A local doctor concurred, writing that \u201cfor some\nmonths past the food supplied has been inadequate for the needs of the children.\u201d321 There\nwere some positive assessments, but Indian Affairs official Martin Benson questioned The history \u2022 57\nAhousaht, British Columbia, students in the school cafeteria. British Columbia Archives, PN-15589.\ntheir accuracy. \u201cIn almost every instance when meals are mentioned by Inspectors they\nare said to be well cooked. I doubt very much whether they ever took a full regulation\nschool meal of bread and dripping, or boiled beef and potatoes.\u201d In Benson\u2019s opinion, \u201cThe\nbill of fare is decidedly monotonous and makes no allowance for peculiarities of taste or\nconstitution.\u201d322\nWhen funding was cut during the Depression of the 1930s, it was the students who paid\nthe price\u2014in more ways than one. At the end of the 1930s, it was discovered that the cook\nat the Presbyterian school at Kenora was actually selling bread to the students, at the rate\nof ten cents a loaf. When asked if the children got enough to eat at meals, she responded,\n\u201cYes, but they were always hungry.\u201d The Indian agent ordered an end to the practice.323 The\nfact that hungry students would be reduced to buying bread to supplement their meals in\n1939 highlights the government\u2019s failure to provide schools with the resources needed to\nfeed students adequately.\nMilk was in constant shortage at many schools, in part due to the poor health and small\nsize of the school dairy herds.324 As late as 1937, disease among the cows at the Kamloops\nschool had cut milk production by 50%. To the principal\u2019s frustration, Ottawa refused to\nfund the construction of an additional barn, which would have allowed for an increase\nin milk production and the isolation of sick animals.325 Even when the dairy herds were 58 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nStudents working in the kitchen at the Cross Lake, Manitoba, school in the early 1920s. St. Boniface Historical Society Archives;\nRoman Catholic Archbishop of Keewatin-The Pas Fonds; N1826.\nproducing satisfactorily, the students did not always get the full benefit. Often, the milk\nwas separated, with the skimmed milk served to the children.326 The milk fat was turned\nto butter and cream, which was frequently sold to raise funds for the schools. Inspector\nW. Murison noted in 1925 that the cows at the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school were producing\nenough milk for the school, but the students were not getting \u201cthe full benefit of this milk\nas I found that they were making about 30 lbs. of butter a week, and a great deal of the milk\ngiven the children is separated milk, which has not much food value.\u201d327\nIn 1942, the federal government issued Canada\u2019s Official Food Rules, an early version\nof the Canada Food Guide.328 Inspectors quickly discovered that residential school diets\ndid not measure up to the Food Rules. Dr. L. B. Pett, the head of the federal government\u2019s\nNutrition Division, concluded in 1947, on the basis of inspections his staff had done, that\n\u201cno school was doing a good feeding job.\u201d329 It was not until the late 1950s that the fed-\neral government adopted a residential school food allowance calculated to provide a diet\ndeemed \u201cfully adequate nutritionally.\u201d330 Even with the increase in funding, schools still\nhad difficulty providing students with adequate meals. A 1966 dietician\u2019s report on Yukon\nHall in Whitehorse observed that although the Canada Food Guide requirements were The history \u2022 59\nbeing met, \u201cbecause of the appetite of this age group, the staff are finding 66\u00a2 per day per\nstudent is limiting.\u201d331 In 1969, an official at Coudert Hall in Whitehorse wrote, \u201cThe $0.80\nalloted [sic] per student for food is not sufficient. In the north we find prices sky high.\u201d To\ncope with the problem, the residence sometimes had to buy \u201cless meat and served mac-\ncaroni [sic] products.\u201d332 A November 1970 inspection of the Dauphin, Manitoba, school\nnoted that the \u201cmenu appears to be short of the recommended two servings of fruit per\nday.\u201d333\nIn their home communities, many students had been raised on food that their parents\nhad hunted, fished, or harvested. These meals were very different from the European diets\nserved at the schools. This change in diet added to the students\u2019 sense of disorientation.\nDaisy Diamond found the food at residential school to be unfamiliar and unpalatable.\n\u201cWhen I was going to Shingwauk, the food didn\u2019t taste very good, because we didn\u2019t have\nour traditional food there, our moose meat, our bannock, and our berries.\u201d334 Dora Fraser,\nfrom the eastern Arctic, found it difficult to adjust to the food served in the hostels. \u201cWe\nwere eating canned food, beans, peas, red beans. The food was terrible.\u201d335 Even when tra-\nditional foods were prepared, the school cooks made them in ways that were unfamiliar\nand unappetizing to the students. Ellen Okimaw, who attended the Fort Albany, Ontario,\nschool, had vivid memories of poorly cooked fish served at the schools. The school cook\nhad simply \u201cdumped the whole thing, and boiled them like that, just like that without\ncleaning them.\u201d336\nBernard Catcheway recalled that in the 1960s at the Pine Creek, Manitoba, school, \u201cwe\nhad to eat all our food even though we didn\u2019t like it. There was a lot of times there I seen\nother students that threw up and they were forced to eat their own, their own vomit.\u201d337\nBernard Sutherland recalled students at the Fort Albany school being forced to eat food\nthat they had vomited. \u201cI saw in person how the children eat their vomit. When they hap-\npened to be sick. And they threw up while eating.\u201d338 These abuses led in 1999 to the con-\nviction of Anna Wesley, a former staff member of the Fort Albany school, on three charges\nof administering a noxious substance.339\nSome schools did make allowances for traditional foods. Simon Awashish recalled\nbeing allowed to trap for food while attending the Amos, Qu\u00e9bec, school.\nWhen we brought in hares, we were asked if \u2026 there was some members of our\nnation that came to work in the kitchen, and we asked them to cook the hare for us in\nthe traditional Atikameg way, in order to keep some sort of contact with our tradi-\ntional food that we had before, before we were separated from our community.340\nStudents who spoke of hunger also spoke of their efforts to improve their diet secretly.\nWoodie Elias recalled being hungry all the time at the Anglican school in Aklavik. \u201cOnce\nin a while we go raid the cellar and you can\u2019t call that stealing; that was our food.\u201d341 When\nDorothy Nolie helped out in the Alert Bay school kitchen, she and her co-workers would\neat bread as they sliced it. \u201cKids would come to me and ask me for bread, and I\u2019d sneak it 60 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nto them.\u201d342 At the Moose Factory school in Ontario, Nellie Trapper said, students \u201cused\nto steal food, peanut butter, whatever\u2019s cooking in a pot. There were big pots in there. I\nremember taking figs from that pot.\u201d343\nComplaints about the limited, poorly prepared, monotonous diet were intensified by\nthe fact that at many schools, the students knew the staff members were being served\nmuch better fare than they had. At the school she attended in Saskatchewan, Inez Dieter\nsaid, \u201cthe staff used to eat like kings, kings and queens.\u201d Like many students, she said, she\nused the opportunity of working in the staff dining room to help herself to leftovers. \u201cI\u2019d\nsteal that and I\u2019d eat, and I\u2019d feel real good.\u201d344 Gladys Prince recalled how, at the Sandy Bay\nschool in Manitoba, the \u201cpriests ate the apples, we ate the peelings. That is what they fed us.\nWe never ate bread. They were stingy them, their own, their own baking.\u201d345 When Frances\nTait was given a position in the staff dining room, she said, she thought she had \u201cdied and\ngone to heaven \u2019cause even eating their leftovers were better than what we got.\u201d346 Hazel\nBitternose, who attended schools in Lestock and Qu\u2019Appelle, said she enjoyed working in\nthe priests\u2019 dining room. \u201cThey had some good food there and I used to sneak some food\nand able to feed myself good there. So that\u2019s why I liked to work there.\u201d347\nThe federal government knowingly chose not to provide schools with enough money to\nensure that kitchens and dining rooms were properly equipped, that cooks were properly\ntrained, and, most significantly, that food was purchased in sufficient quantity and quality\nfor growing children. It was a decision that left thousands of Aboriginal children vulnera-\nble to disease.\nHealth: \u201cFor sickness, conditions at this\nschool are nothing less than criminal.\u201d\nThe number of students who died at Canada\u2019s residential schools is not likely ever to\nbe known in full. The most serious gap in information arises from the incompleteness of\nthe documentary record. Many records have simply been destroyed. According to a 1935\nfederal government policy, school returns could be destroyed after five years, and reports\nof accidents after ten years. This led to the destruction of fifteen tonnes of waste paper.\nBetween 1936 and 1944, 200,000 Indian Affairs files were destroyed.348 Health records\nwere regularly destroyed. For example, in 1957, Indian and Northern Health Services was\ninstructed to destroy \u201ccorrespondence re routine arrangements re medical and dental\ntreatments of Indians and Eskimos, such as transportation, escort services, admission\nto hospital, advice on treatment, requests for treatment, etc.\u201d after a period of two years.\nReports by doctors, dentists, and nurses were similarly assigned a two-year retention\nperiod.349\nOften, the existing record lacks needed detail. For example, it was not uncommon for\nprincipals, in their annual reports, to state that a specific number of students had died in The history \u2022 61\nthe previous year, but not to name them.350 It was not until 1935 that Indian Affairs adopted\na formal policy on how deaths at the schools were to be reported and investigated.351\nThere can be no certainty that all deaths were, in fact, reported to Indian Affairs\u2014the\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has located reports of student deaths in\nchurch records that are not reported in government documents.352 In some cases, school\nofficials appear not to have recognized a responsibility to report student deaths to provin-\ncial vital statistics officials, meaning that these records may also be deficient.353\nAs part of its work, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has established\na National Residential School Student Death Register. The creation of this register marks\nthe first effort in Canadian history to properly record the number of students who died in\nresidential schools. The register is made of up three sub-registers:\n1) the Register of Confirmed Deaths of Named Residential School Students (the\n\u201cNamed Register\u201d);\n2) the Register of Confirmed Deaths of Unnamed Residential School Students (the\n\u201cUnnamed Register\u201d); and\n3) the Register of Deaths that Require Further Investigation (to determine if they\nshould be placed on either the Named or Unnamed register).\nA January 2015 statistical analysis of the Named Register for the period from 1867\nto 2000 identified 2,040 deaths. The same analysis of a combination of the Named and\nUnnamed registers identified 3,201 reported deaths. The greatest number of these deaths\n(1,328 on the Named Register and 2,434 on the Named and Unnamed registers) took place\nprior to 1940. Graph 3 shows the overall death rate per 1,000 students for the residential\nschools during this period (figures are based on information in the combined Named and\nUnnamed registers).\nThis graph suggests that the peak of the health crisis in the schools occurred in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It also shows that the death rate remained high\nuntil the 1950s.\nThe death rates for Aboriginal children in the residential schools were far higher than\nthose experienced by members of the general Canadian population. Graph 4 compares\nthe death rate per 1,000 of the general population of Canadian children aged five to four-\nteen with the death rates per 1,000 of the Named Register and the Named and Unnamed\nregisters combined. (Given the limitations in Statistics Canada\u2019s historical data, the death\nrates are provided as five-year averages.) As can be seen, until the 1950s Aboriginal chil-\ndren in residential schools died at a far higher rate than school-aged children in the gen-\neral population. It is only in the 1950s that the residential school death rates declined to\na level comparable to that of the general school-aged population. As late as the 1941\u201345\nperiod, the Named and Unnamed Combined residential school death rate was 4.90 times\nhigher than the general death rate. In the 1960s, even though the residential school death 62 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nGraph 3\nResidential school death rates for 1,000 students, Named and\nUnnamed registers combined, 1869 to 1965\nDeath rate per 1,000 students\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1869 1884 1899 1914 1929 1944 1959\nSource: Rosenthal, \u201cStatistical Analysis of Deaths,\u201d 11.\nrates were much lower than their historic highs, they were still double those of the general\nschool-aged population.\nIn nearly 50% of the cases (both in the Named and Unnamed registers), there is no\nrecorded cause of death. From those cases where the cause of death was reported, it is\nclear that until the 1950s, the schools were the sites of an ongoing tuberculosis crisis.\nTuberculosis accounted for just less than 50% of the recorded deaths (46.2% for the Named\nRegister, and 47% for the Named and Unnamed registers combined). The tuberculosis\ndeath rate remained high until the 1950s: its decline coincides with the introduction of\neffective drug treatment. The next most frequently recorded causes of death were influ-\nenza (9.2% on the Named Register, and 9.1% of the deaths on the combined Named and\nUnnamed registers), pneumonia (6.9% on the Named Register, and 9.1% of the deaths on\nthe combined Named and Unnamed registers), and general lung disease (3.4% on the\nNamed Register, and 5.5% of the deaths on the combined Named and Unnamed regis-\nters). Graph 5 shows the residential school tuberculosis death rate (figures are based on\ninformation in the combined Named and Unnamed registers).\nThe tuberculosis health crisis in the schools was part of a broader Aboriginal health\ncrisis that was set in motion by colonial policies that separated Aboriginal people from\ntheir land, thereby disrupting their economies and their food supplies. This crisis was par-\nticularly intense on the Canadian Prairies. Numerous federal government policies con-\ntributed to the undermining of Aboriginal health.

In making the Treaties, the government had promised\nto provide assistance to First Nations to allow them to make a transition from hunting to\nfarming. This aid was slow in coming and inadequate on arrival. Restrictions in the Indian\nAct made it difficult for First Nations farmers to sell their produce or borrow money to\ninvest in technology. Reserve land was often agriculturally unproductive. Reserve housing\nwas poor and crowded, sanitation was inadequate, and access to clean water was lim-\nited. Under these conditions, tuberculosis flourished. Those people it did not kill were\noften severely weakened and likely to succumb to measles, smallpox, and other infectious\ndiseases.354\nFor Aboriginal children, the relocation to residential schools was generally no healthier\nthan their homes had been on the reserves. In 1897, Indian Affairs official Martin Benson\nreported that the industrial schools in Manitoba and the Northwest Territories had been\n\u201churriedly constructed of poor materials, badly laid out, without due provision for light-\ning, heating or ventilation.\u201d In addition, drainage was poor, and water and fuel supplies\nwere inadequate.355 Conditions were not any better in the church-built boarding schools.\nIn 1904, Indian Commissioner David Laird echoed Benson\u2019s comments when he wrote 64 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nGraph 5\nResidential school tuberculosis death rates per 1,000 population,\nNamed and Unnamed registers combined, 1869\u20131965\nDeath rate per 1,000 students\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1869 1889 1909 1929 1949\nSource: Rosenthal, \u201cStatistical Analysis of Deaths,\u201d 97\u201399.\nthat the sites for the boarding schools on the Prairies seemed \u201cto have been selected with-\nout proper regard for either water-supply or drainage. I need not mention any school in\nparticular, but I have urged improvement in several cases in regard to fire-protection.\u201d356\nStudents\u2019 health depended on clean water, good sanitation, and adequate ventilation.\nBut little was done to improve the poor living conditions that were identified at the begin-\nning of the twentieth century. In 1940, R. A. Hoey, who had served as the Indian Affairs\nsuperintendent of Welfare and Training since 1936, wrote a lengthy assessment of the\ncondition of the existing residential schools. He concluded that many schools were \u201cin a\nsomewhat dilapidated condition\u201d and had \u201cbecome acute fire hazards.\u201d He laid respon-\nsibility for the \u201ccondition of our schools, generally,\u201d upon their \u201cfaulty construction.\u201d This\nconstruction, he said, had failed to meet \u201cthe minimum standards in the construction of\npublic buildings, particularly institutions for the education of children.\u201d357 By 1940, the\ngovernment had concluded that future policy should concentrate on the expansion of day\nschools for First Nations children. As a result, many of the existing residential school build-\nings were allowed to continue to deteriorate. A 1967 brief from the National Association of\nPrincipals and Administrators of Indian Residences\u2014which included principals of both\nCatholic and Protestant schools\u2014concluded, \u201cIn the years that the Churches have been\ninvolved in the administration of the schools, there has been a steady deterioration in\nessential services. Year after year, complaints, demands and requests for improvements\nhave, in the main, fallen upon deaf ears.\u201d358 The history \u2022 65\nThe Roman Catholic school at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September 1952. There was no\nloss of life. St. Boniface Historical Society Archives, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Keewatin-The Pas Fonds, N3637.\nWhen E. A. C\u00f4t\u00e9, the deputy minister responsible for Indian Affairs, met with church\nand school representatives to discuss the brief, he told them that only emergency repairs\nwould be undertaken at schools that Indian Affairs intended to close.359\nThe badly built and poorly maintained schools constituted serious fire hazards.\nDefective firefighting equipment exacerbated the risk, and schools were fitted with inad-\nequate and dangerous fire escapes. Lack of access to safe fire escapes led to high death\ntolls in fires at the Beauval and Cross Lake schools.360 The Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission of Canada has determined that at least fifty-three schools were destroyed by\nfire. There were at least 170 additional recorded fires. At least forty students died in resi-\ndential school fires.361 The harsh discipline and jail-like nature of life in the schools meant\nthat many students sought to run away. To prevent this, many schools deliberately ignored\ngovernment instructions in relation to fire drills and fire escapes. These were not problems\nonly of the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Well into the twentieth century,\nrecommendations for improvements went unheeded, and dangerous and forbidden prac-\ntices were widespread and entrenched. In the interests of cost containment, the Canadian\ngovernment placed the lives of students and staff at risk for 130 years.\nThe buildings were not only fire traps. They were also incubators of disease. Rather\nthan helping combat the tuberculosis crisis in the broader Aboriginal community, the\npoor condition of the schools served to intensify it. The 1906 annual report of Dr. Peter\nBryce, the chief medical officer for Indian Affairs, observed that \u201cthe Indian population\nof Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in\nsome provinces more than three times.\u201d Tuberculosis was the prevalent cause of death. 66 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nOld Sun\u2019s, Alberta, dormitory. Diseases such as tuberculosis could spread quickly in crowded dormitories. General Synod\nArchives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S7-167.\nHe described a cycle of disease in which infants and children were infected at home and\nsent to residential schools, where they infected other children. The children infected in\nthe schools were \u201csent home when too ill to remain at school, or because of being a dan-\nger to the other scholars, and have conveyed the disease to houses previously free.\u201d362 The\nfollowing year, Bryce published a damning report on the conditions at prairie boarding\nschools. In an age when fresh air was seen as being central to the successful treatment of\ntuberculosis, he concluded that, with only a few exceptions, the ventilation at the schools\nwas \u201cextremely inadequate.\u201d363\nHe found the school staff and even physicians\ninclined to question or minimize the dangers of infection from scrofulous or con-\nsumptive pupils [scrofula and consumption were alternate names for types of tuber-\nculosis] and nothing less than peremptory instructions as to how to deal with cases of\ndisease existing in the schools will eliminate this ever-present danger of infection.364\nHe gave the principals a questionnaire to complete regarding the health condition of\ntheir former students. The responses from fifteen schools revealed that \u201cof a total of 1,537\npupils reported upon nearly 25 per cent are dead, of one school with an absolutely accu-\nrate statement, 69 per cent of ex-pupils are dead, and that everywhere the almost invari-\nable cause of death given is tuberculosis.\u201d He drew particular attention to the fate of the\nthirty-one students who had been discharged from the File Hills school: nine were in good\nhealth, and twenty-two were dead.365\nThe extent of the health crisis was so severe that some people within the federal gov-\nernment and the Protestant churches became convinced that the only solution was to The history \u2022 67\nclose the schools and replace them with\nday schools. However, the Indian Affairs\nminister of the day, Frank Oliver, refused\nto enact the plan without the support of\nthe churches involved. The plan foundered\nfor lack of Roman Catholic support. During\nthe same period, Bryce recommended that\nthe federal government take over all the\nschools and turn them into sanatoria under\nhis control. This plan was rejected because\nit was viewed as being too costly, and it was\nthought that it would have met with church\nopposition.366\nInstead of closing schools or turning\nthem into sanatoria, the government\u2019s\nmajor response to the health crisis was the Dr. Peter Bryce, Indian Affairs chief medical officer,\nrecommended in 1909 that Canada\u2019s residential\nnegotiation in 1910 of a contract between\nschools be turned into sanatoria and placed under his\nIndian Affairs and the churches. This con- administration. Library and Archives Canada, Topley Studio,\ntract increased the grants to the schools a042966.\nand imposed a set of standards for diet and\nventilation. The contract also required that students not be admitted \u201cuntil, where practi-\ncable, a physician has reported that the child is in good health.\u201d367\nAs noted earlier, although the contract led to improvements in the short term, inflation\nquickly eroded the benefit of the increase in grants. The situation was worsened by the cuts\nto the grants that were repeatedly imposed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The\nunderfunding created by the cuts guaranteed that students would be poorly fed, clothed,\nand housed. As a result, children were highly susceptible to tuberculosis. And, because\nthe government was slow to put in place policies that would have prohibited the admis-\nsion of children with tuberculosis, and ineffective in enforcing such policies once they\nwere developed, healthy children became infected. As late as the 1950s, at some schools,\npre-admission medical examinations appear to have been perfunctory, ineffective, or\nnon-existent.368 In the long run, the 1910 contract proved to be no solution for the tuber-\nculosis crisis.\nThe schools often lacked adequate facilities for the treatment of sick children. In 1893,\nIndian Affairs inspector T. P. Wadsworth reported that at the Qu\u2019Appelle school, the \u201cwant\nof an infirmary is still very much felt.\u201d369 Those infirmaries that existed were often prim-\nitive. On an 1891 visit to the Battleford school, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed con-\ncluded that the hospital ward was in such poor shape that they had been obliged to move\nthe children in it to the staff sitting room. According to Reed, \u201cThe noise, as well as the bad\nsmells, come from the lavatory underneath.\u201d370 Proposals to construct a small hospital at 68 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthe Red Deer school in 1901 were not implemented.371 There were also reports of inade-\nquate isolation facilities at the Regina school (1901), the Anglican school in Onion Lake,\nSaskatchewan (1921), the Mission, British Columbia, school (1924), and the Muncey,\nOntario, school (1935).372 When diphtheria broke out at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, in 1909,\nthe nine students who fell ill were placed in a \u201clarge isolated house.\u201d373\nEven though the 1910 contract required all schools to have hospital accommodation to\nprevent the spread of infectious disease, many schools continued to be without a proper\ninfirmary. The 1918 global influenza epidemic left four children dead at the Red Deer,\nAlberta, school. When the influenza epidemic subsided, Principal J. F. Woodsworth com-\nplained to Indian Affairs, \u201cFor sickness, conditions at this school are nothing less than\ncriminal. We have no isolation ward and no hospital equipment of any kind.\u201d374 The Roman\nCatholic principals petitioned the federal government for the establishment of sick rooms,\nunder the supervision of a competent nurse, at each school in 1924. At the same time, they\nobjected to the sanitary inspection of the schools by government-appointed nurses, since\nthey recommended changes \u201cleading to the transformation of our schools into hospitals\nor sanatoriums.\u201d375 There were also regular reports that schools could not afford to hire\nneeded nursing staff.376 Indian Affairs officials continued to be critical of the quality of care\nprovided by school infirmaries at the end of the 1950s.377 Complaints from principals make\nit clear that into the late 1960s, there were still severe limitations on the range of health\nservices being provided to residential school students.378\nGeneral Aboriginal health care was never a priority for the Canadian government.\nTuberculosis among Aboriginal people largely was ignored unless it threatened the gen-\neral Canadian population.379 In 1937, Dr. H. W. McGill, the director of Indian Affairs, sent\nout an instruction that Indian health-care services \u201cmust be restricted to those required\nfor the safety of limb, life or essential function.\u201d Hospital care was to be limited, spending\non drugs was cut in half, and sanatoria and hospital treatment for chronic tuberculosis\nwere eliminated.380\nThe high death rates led many parents to refuse to send their children to residen-\ntial school. In 1897, Kah-pah-pah-mah-am-wa-ko-we-ko-chin (also known as Tom)\nwas deposed from his position as a headman of the White Bear Reserve in what is now\nSaskatchewan for his vocal opposition to residential schools. In making his case for a\nschool on the reserve, he pointed to the death rate at the Qu\u2019Appelle industrial school,\nadding, \u201cOur children are not strong. Many of them are sick most of the time, many of the\nchildren sent from this Reserve to the Schools have died.381\nDeath casts a long shadow over many residential school memories. Louise Moine\nattended the Qu\u2019Appelle school in the early twentieth century. She recalled one year when\ntuberculosis was \u201con the rampage in that school. There was a death every month on the\ngirls\u2019 side and some of the boys went also.\u201d382 Of his years at the Roman Catholic school in\nOnion Lake, Joseph Dion recalled, \u201cMy schoolmates and I were not long in concluding\nthat the lung sickness was fatal, hence as soon as we saw or heard of someone spitting The history \u2022 69\nblood, we immediately branded him for the grave. He had consumption: he had to die.\u201d383\nSimon Baker\u2019s brother Jim died from spinal meningitis at the Lytton, British Columbia,\nschool. \u201cI used to hear him crying at night. I asked the principal to take him to the hospital.\nHe didn\u2019t. After about two weeks, my brother was in so much pain, he was going out of his\nmind. I pleaded with the principal for days to take him to a doctor.\u201d384\nRay Silver said that he always blamed the Alberni school for the death of his brother\nDalton. \u201cHe was a little guy, laying in the bed in the infirmary, dying, and I didn\u2019t know \u2019til\nhe died. You know that\u2019s, that was the end of my education.\u201d385 The death of a child often\nprompted parents to withdraw the rest of their children from a school. One former student\nsaid her father came to the school when her sister became ill at the Anglican school at\nAklavik, Northwest Territories. \u201cHe came upstairs and there we were. He cried over us. He\ntook me home. He put her in a hospital, and she died.\u201d386\nThe high deaths rates in the schools were, in part, a reflection of the high death rates\namong the Aboriginal community in general. Indian Affairs officials often tried to portray\nthese rates as simply the price that Aboriginal people had to pay as part of the process of\nbecoming civilized. In reality, these rates were the price they paid for being colonized.387\nAboriginal livelihoods were based on access to the land; colonization disrupted that\naccess and introduced new illnesses to North America. Colonial policies helped wiped out\nfood sources and confined Aboriginal people to poorly located reserves, with inadequate\nsanitation and shelter. The schools could have served as institutions to help counter these\nproblems. To do that, however, they would have had to have been properly constructed,\nmaintained, staffed, and supplied. Government officials were aware of this. They were\nalso aware that death rates among students at residential schools were disproportionately\nhigh. It would be wrong to say the government did nothing about this crisis: the 1910 con-\ntract did provide a substantial funding increase to the schools. But the federal government\nnever made the type of sustained investment in Aboriginal health, in either the communi-\nties or the schools, that could have addressed this crisis\u2014which continues to the present.\nThe non-Aboriginal tuberculosis death rate declined before the introduction of life-saving\ndrugs. It was brought down by improvements in diet, housing, sanitation, and medical\nattention. Had such measures been taken by the federal government earlier, they would\nhave reduced both the Aboriginal death rates and the residential school students\u2019 death\nrates. By failing to take adequate measures that had been recommended to it, the federal\ngovernment blighted the health of generations of Aboriginal people.\nBurial policy\nMany of the early schools were part of larger church mission centres that might include\na church, a dwelling for the missionaries, a farm, a sawmill, and a cemetery. The mission\ncemetery might serve as a place of burial for students who died at school, members of 70 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nResidential school students at the Roman Catholic cemetery in Fort George, Qu\u00e9bec. Desch\u00e2telets Archives.\nthe local community, and the missionaries themselves. For example, the cemetery at the\nRoman Catholic St. Mary\u2019s mission, near Mission, British Columbia, was intended orig-\ninally for priests and nuns from the mission as well as for students from the residential\nschool.388\nDuring the influenza pandemic of 1918\u201319, many of the schools and missions were\noverwhelmed. At the Fort St. James school and mission in British Columbia, the dead were\nburied in a common grave.389 At the Red Deer school, four students who died there were\nburied two to a grave to save costs.390 In some cases, student and staff graves were treated\ndifferently. At the Spanish, Ontario, school, the graves of staff members were marked with\nheadstones that, in the case of former priests and nuns, provided name and date of birth\nand death. The burial spots of students were identified only by plain white crosses.391\nThe general Indian Affairs policy was to hold the schools responsible for burial expenses\nwhen a student died at school. The school generally determined the location and nature\nof that burial.392 Parental requests to have children\u2019s bodies returned home for burial were\ngenerally refused as being too costly.393 In her memoirs, Eleanor Brass recalled how the\nbody of one boy, who hung himself at the File Hills school in the early twentieth cen-\ntury, was buried on the Peepeekisis Reserve, even though his parents lived on the Carlyle\nReserve.394 As late as 1958, Indian Affairs refused to return the body of a boy who had died\nat a hospital in Edmonton to his northern home community in the Yukon.395\nThe reluctance to pay the cost of sending the bodies of children from residential schools\nhome for burial ceremonies continued into the 1960s. Initially, for example, Indian Affairs\nwas initially unwilling to pay to send the body of twelve-year-old Charlie Wenjack back\nto his parents\u2019 home community in Ogoki, Ontario, in 1966.396 When Charles Hunter The history \u2022 71\ndrowned in 1974 while attending the Fort Albany school, it was decided, without consulta-\ntion with his parents, to bury him in Moosonee rather than send him home to Peawanuck\nnear Hudson Bay. It was not until 2011, after significant public efforts made on his behalf\nby his sister Joyce, who had never got to meet her older brother, that Charles Hunter\u2019s body\nwas exhumed and returned to Peawanuck for a community burial. The costs were covered\nby funds that the Toronto Star raised from its readership.397\nA school closing might mean the cemetery would be left unattended. When the\nBattleford school closed in 1914, Principal E. Matheson reminded Indian Affairs that there\nwas a school cemetery that contained the bodies of seventy to eighty individuals, most of\nwhom were former students. He worried that unless the government took steps to care\nfor the cemetery, it would be overrun by stray cattle.398 In short, throughout the system\u2019s\nhistory, children who died at school were buried in school or mission cemeteries, often in\npoorly marked graves. The closing of the schools has led, in many cases, to the abandon-\nment of these cemeteries.\nDiscipline: \u201cToo suggestive of the old\nsystem of flogging criminals\u201d\nWhen Indian agent D. L. Clink returned a runaway student to the Red Deer industrial\nschool in 1895, he noted that the boy\u2019s head was bruised from where a teacher had hit\nhim with a stick. The school principal, John Nelson, told Clink that he \u201chad been severe\nwith him before but he would be more severe now.\u201d Worried that if he \u201cleft the boy he\nwould be abused,\u201d Clink took the boy away from the school. He also recommended to\nIndian Affairs that the teacher who had struck the student be dismissed and brought up on\ncharges, since \u201chis actions in this and other cases would not be tolerated in a white school\nfor a single day in any part of Canada.\u201d399 Clink\u2019s report led Indian Affairs Deputy Minister\nHayter Reed to direct his staff:\nInstructions should be given, if not already sent, to the Principals of the various\nschools, that children are not to be whipped by anyone save the Principal, and even\nwhen such a course is necessary, great discretion should be used and they should\nnot be struck on the head, or punished so severely that bodily harm might ensue. The\npractice of corporal punishment is considered unnecessary as a general measure of\ndiscipline and should only be resorted to for very grave offences and as a deterrent\nexample.400\nReed\u2019s instruction underlines a number of the recurrent problems with the Indian\nAffairs approach to discipline in residential schools. First, Reed, who had previously\nbeen the Indian commissioner in western Canada, did not know whether there were reg-\nulations dealing with school discipline. Second, his directive is vague: while it indicates 72 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe Mohawk Institute in Brantford, Ontario, was just one of the schools that had specific \u201cpunishment rooms.\u201d General\nSynod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S4-507.\nwhere students should not be struck, it does not specify where they could be struck, or\nplace limits on what students could be struck with; and neither are there limits on the\nnumber of blows. Third, it is not clear that these instructions were ever issued to the prin-\ncipals. If they were, they were soon lost and forgotten. In later years, when conflicts arose\nover discipline at the schools, Indian Affairs officials made no reference to the policy. In\n1920, Canon S. Gould, the general secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of\nEngland in Canada, asked Deputy Minister Campbell Scott, \u201cIs corporal punishment for\ndisciplinary purposes recognized, or permitted in the Indian Boarding schools?\u201d He noted\nthat whether or not it was permitted, he imagined that it was applied in every residential\nschool in the country.401 The first\u2014and only\u2014evidence of a nation-wide discipline policy\nfor residential schools that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has been\nable to locate in the documents reviewed to date was issued in 1953.402\nThe failure to establish and enforce a national policy on discipline meant that students\nwere subject to disciplinary measures that would not, as Clink noted in 1895, be toler-\nated in schools for non-Aboriginal children. Four years after Reed asked his staff to issue\ninstructions on corporal punishment, Indian Commissioner David Laird reported that sev-\neral children had been \u201ctoo severely punished\u201d at the Middlechurch school. \u201cStrappings\non the bare back,\u201d he wrote, was \u201ctoo suggestive of the old system of flogging criminals.\u201d403\nCorporal punishment was often coupled with public humiliation. In December 1896 in\nBritish Columbia, the Kuper Island school\u2019s acting principal gave two boys \u201cseveral lashes\nin the Presence of the Pupils\u201d for sneaking into the girls\u2019 dormitory at night.404 When, in\n1934, the principal of the Shubenacadie school could not determine who had stolen money The history \u2022 73\nand chocolates from a staff member, he had the suspects thrashed with a seven-thonged\nstrap and then placed on bread-and-water diets.405\nSome schools had a specific room set aside to serve as a \u201cpunishment room.\u201d406 After\na 1907 inspection of the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, the Ontario inspector for Indian\nagencies, J. G. Ramsden, reported, \u201cI cannot say that I was favourably impressed with the\nsight of two prison cells in the boys [sic] play house. I was informed, however, that these\nwere for pupils who ran away from the institution, confinement being for a week at a time\nwhen pupils returned.\u201d407 In 1914, a father successfully sued the Mohawk Institute prin-\ncipal for locking his daughter in a cell for three days on what was described as a \u201cwater\ndiet.\u201d408\nBoys at the Anglican school in Brocket, Alberta, were chained together as punishment\nfor running away in 1920.409 At the Gleichen, Alberta, school, a principal was accused of\nshackling a boy to his bed and beating him with a quirt (a riding whip) until his back bled.\nThe principal admitted to having beaten the boy with the whip, but denied breaking the\nboy\u2019s skin.410\nAbusive punishment often prompted children to run away. The father of Duncan Sticks,\na boy who died from exposure after running away from the Williams Lake school in British\nColumbia, told a coroner\u2019s inquest in 1902 that, in the past, his son had run away because\nhe had been \u201cbeaten with a quirt.\u201d411 A boy who ran away from the Anglican school in The\nPas, after being severely beaten by the principal, nearly died of exposure.412\nThe violent nature of the discipline at the schools came as a shock to students. Isabelle\nWhitford said that prior to coming to the Sandy Bay school, she had never been physically\ndisciplined. \u201cAll my dad have to do was raise his voice, and we knew what he meant. So,\nwhen I first got hit by the nuns, it was really devastating \u2019cause how can they hit me when\nmy parents didn\u2019t hit me, you know?\u201d413 Rachel Chakasim said that at the Fort Albany\nschool, \u201cI saw violence for the first time. I would see kids getting hit. Sometimes in the\nclassrooms, a yardstick was being used to hit.\u201d414\nFred Brass said that his years at the Roman Catholic school at Kamsack, Saskatchewan,\nwere \u201cthe hellish years of my life. You know to be degraded by our so-called educators, to\nbe beat by these people that were supposed to have been there to look after us, to teach us\nright from wrong. It makes me wonder now today a lot of times I ask that question, who\nwas right and who was wrong?\u201d415 According to Geraldine Bob, the staff members at the\nKamloops school she attended were not able to control their tempers once they began to\npunish a student. \u201cThey would just start beating you and lose control and hurl you against\nthe wall, throw you on the floor, kick you, punch you.\u201d416\nIt was a common practice to shave the heads of students who ran away. William Antoine\nrecalled that at the Spanish, Ontario, school, this was done in front of the other students.\n\u201cThey got all the boys to look at what is happening to this boy, what they were doing to him\nbecause he ran away. They cut all his hair off and they pulled, pulled his pants down and 74 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nhe was kneeling on the floor, and holding onto the chair.\u201d417 Eva Simpson said that at the\nCatholic school in The Pas, her cousin\u2019s head was shaved for running away.418\nMany students spoke of teachers punishing them by pulling their ears. At Sioux Lookout,\nDorothy Ross said, \u201cone time me and this other girl were, we were, were fooling around,\nwe were teasing each other in our own language, we got, I got caught. She pulled my ear\nso hard.\u201d419 Archie Hyacinthe could recall that in the classrooms of the Roman Catholic\nschool in Kenora, \u201cevery time we didn\u2019t listen, they would tug us behind the ear, or behind\nthe neck, or on the elbows.\u201d420 Jonas Grandjambe recalled how the nun in charge of the\nboys\u2019 dormitory at the Roman Catholic school in Aklavik, in the Northwest Territories,\nwould \u201cgrab our ear and twist it.\u201d421 Delores Adolph said that the discipline she received\nat the Mission school impaired her hearing.422 Joseph Wabano said that at the Fort\nAlbany, Ontario, school, the staff would hit students with a one-inch-thick board.423 Noel\nStarblanket recalled being constantly \u201cslapped on the side of the head\u201d at the Qu\u2019Appelle\nschool. One teacher struck him in the face and broke his nose.424\nMervin Mirasty said that at the Beauval, Saskatchewan, school, boys who were caught\nthrowing snowballs were punished with blows to their hands from the blade of a hockey\nstick.425 As a punishment, Nellie Trapper, who attended the Moose Factory, Ontario,\nschool in the 1950s, was assigned to \u201cscrubbing the stair, the stairwell with a toothbrush,\nme and this other girl. Like, I don\u2019t remember what I did wrong, but that was something\nthat I won\u2019t forget. I remember sitting on the steps, and she, our supervisor was standing\nthere, watching us.\u201d426 Former students also spoke of how, in winter, they might be forced\nto stand or sit, inadequately clothed, in the snow as a form of punishment.\nIt was not uncommon for residential school students, traumatized by being placed in\nsuch a harsh and alien environment, to wet their beds. These students were subjected to\nhumiliating punishments. Wendy Lafond said that at the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,\nschool, \u201cif we wet our beds, we were made to stand in the corner in our pissy clothes, not\nallowed to change.\u201d427 Don Willie recalled that students who wet their beds were publicly\nhumiliated at the Alert Bay school. \u201cAnd they used to, they used to line up the wet bed,\nbedwetters, and line them up in the morning, and parade them through, parade them\nthrough breakfast, the breakfast area, pretty much to shame them.\u201d428\nPolicies that were seen as being unacceptable in the early twentieth century were still\nin place in the 1960s. Many students compared residential schools to jails: some spoke of\nbeing locked up in dormitories, broom closets, basements, and even crawl spaces. In 1965,\nstudents who ran away from the Presbyterian school in Kenora were locked up with just a\nmattress on the floor and put on a bread-and-milk diet.429 Students were still being locked\nup in what was referred to as the \u201ccounselling\u201d room at the Poplar Hill, Ontario, school in\nthe 1980s.430 Despite the fact that Indian Affairs had given orders to abandon the practice,\nstudents were still having their hair cropped into the 1970s.431 In the 1990s, students at the\nGordon\u2019s, Saskatchewan, school were still being struck, and pushed into lockers and walls\nby one staff member.432 The history \u2022 75\nThe failure to develop, implement, and monitor effective discipline sent an unspoken\nmessage that there were no real limits on what could be done to Aboriginal children within\nthe walls of a residential school. The door had been opened early to an appalling level of\nphysical and sexual abuse of students, and it remained open throughout the existence of\nthe system.\nAbuse: \u201cAnd he did awful things to me.\u201d\nFrom the nineteenth century onwards, the government and churches were well aware\nof the risk that staff might sexually abuse residential school students. As early as 1886,\nJean L\u2019Heureux, who worked as a translator for Indian Affairs and a recruiter for Roman\nCatholic schools in Alberta, was accused of sexually abusing boys in his care. The officials\nresponsible for the schools recognized that his actions were not appropriate. Despite this,\nthere is no record of a criminal investigation being carried out at the time.433 When new\nallegations against L\u2019Heureux emerged in 1891, he was allowed to resign. In dealing with\nthe matter, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Lawrence Vankoughnet hoped \u201cit would not be\nnecessary to state the cause which led to the same [the resignation].\u201d434\nWhen it came to taking action on the abuse of Aboriginal children, early on, Indian\nAffairs and the churches placed their own interests ahead of the children in their care and\nthen covered up that victimization. It was cowardly behaviour.\nThis set the tone for the way the churches and government would treat the sexual abuse\nof children for the entire history of the residential school system. Complaints often were\nignored. In some cases where allegations were made against a school principal, the only\nmeasure that Indian Affairs took was to contact the principal.435 In at least one case, Indian\nAffairs officials worked with school officials to frustrate a police investigation into abuse\nat a school. When attempting to return some runaway boys to the Kuper Island school in\n1939, British Columbia Provincial Police officers concluded that there was good reason\nto believe the boys had run away because they were being sexually abused at the school.\nThe police launched an investigation and refused to return the boys to the school.436 When\nIndian Affairs officials finally investigated, they concluded that the allegations had merit.\nHowever, to protect the school\u2019s reputation, the local Indian Affairs official advised the\nsuspected abusers to leave the province, allowing them to avoid prosecution.437 Nothing\nwas done for the students who had been victimized or for their parents.\nThese patterns persisted into the late twentieth century. Officials continued to dismiss\nAboriginal reports of abuse.438 In some cases, staff members were not fired, even after being\nconvicted of assaulting a student.439 Complaints were improperly investigated. For exam-\nple, charges of sexual impropriety made against the principal of the Gordon\u2019s school were\ninvestigated by a school staff member in 1956.440 Church officials failed to report cases of\nabuse to Indian Affairs, and Indian Affairs failed to report cases of abuse to families.441 It 76 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nIn 1939, Indian Affairs officials recommended that Kuper Island school staff suspected of sexually abusing students leave\nthe province, allowing them to avoid prosecution. British Columbia Archives, pdp05505.\nwas not until 1968 that Indian Affairs began to compile and circulate a list of former staff\nmembers who were not to be hired at other schools without the approval of officials in\nOttawa.442 The churches and the government remained reluctant to take matters to the\npolice. As a result, prosecutions were rare.\nIn the documents it has reviewed, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\nhas identified over forty successful convictions of former residential school staff members\nwho sexually or physically abused students.443 Most of these prosecutions were the result\nof the determination of former students to see justice done.\nThe full extent of the abuse that occurred in the schools is only now coming to light. As of\nJanuary 31, 2015, the Independent Assessment Process (iap), established under the Indian\nResidential Schools Settlement Agreement (irssa) had received 37,951 claims for injuries\nresulting from physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The iap is a mechanism\nto compensate former students for sexual and physical abuse experienced at the schools\nand the harms that arose from the assaults. By the end of 2014, the iap had resolved 30,939\nof those claims, awarding $2,690,000,000 in compensation.444 The Common Experience\nPayment (cep) established under irssa provided compensation to individuals who\nattended a school on the irssa\u2019s approved list of schools. The cep recognized the claims\nof 78,748 former residential school students. Although claims for compensation under the\niap could be made by non-residential school students who were abused at the schools, the\nvast majority of iap claims were made by former residential school students. The number\nof claims for compensation for abuse is equivalent to approximately 48% of the number\nof former students who were eligible to make such claims. This number does not include\nthose former students who died prior to May 2005.\nAs the numbers demonstrate, the abuse of children was rampant. From 1958, when\nit first opened, until 1979, there was never a year in which Grollier Hall in Inuvik did\nnot employ at least one dormitory supervisor who would later be convicted for sexually The history \u2022 77\nabusing students at the school. Joseph Jean Louis Comeau, Martin Houston, George\nMaczynski, and Paul Leroux all worked at Grollier Hall during this period. All were con-\nvicted of abusing Grollier Hall students.445 William Peniston Starr served as director of the\nGordon\u2019s, Saskatchewan, residence from 1968 until 1984.446 Prior to that, he worked at a\nseries of schools in Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec.447 In 1993, he was convicted of ten counts of sex-\nually assaulting Gordon\u2019s school students.448 Arthur Plint worked as a boys\u2019 supervisor at\nthe Alberni residential school for two five-year periods between 1948 and 1968. In 1995, he\npleaded guilty to eighteen counts of indecent assault. In sentencing him to eleven years in\njail, Justice D. A. Hogarth described Plint as \u201ca sexual terrorist.\u201d449\nPhysical abuse and sexual abuse often were intertwined. Jean Pierre Bellemare,\nwho attended the Amos, Qu\u00e9bec, school, spoke for many students when he told the\nCommission that he had been subjected to \u201cphysical violence, verbal violence, touchings,\neverything that comes with it.\u201d450 Andrew Yellowback was \u201csexually, physically, emotion-\nally, and mentally abused\u201d at the Cross Lake, Manitoba, school for eight years.451 There was\nno single pattern of abuse: students of both sexes reported assaults from staff members of\nboth the opposite sex and the same sex as themselves.452\nFirst-year students, traumatized by separation from their parents and the harsh and\nalien regime of the school, were particularly vulnerable to abusive staff members who\nsought to win their trust through what initially appeared to be simple kindness. In some\ncases, this might involve little more than extra treats from the school canteen. This favou-\nritism, however, was often the prelude to a sexual assault that left the student scared and\nconfused.453\nMany students spoke of having been raped at school.454 These were moments of terror.\nJosephine Sutherland was cornered by one of the lay brothers in the Fort Albany school\ngarage: \u201cI couldn\u2019t call for help, I couldn\u2019t. And he did awful things to me.\u201d455 Other stu-\ndents recalled being assaulted in the church confessional.456 A student in the change\nroom would suddenly have a bag pulled over his head.457 The abuse could begin with an\ninstruction to report to the shower room in the middle of the night or to take lunch to a\nstaff member\u2019s room.458 An abusive staff person might stalk a student, blocking her or his\nway, or grope a passing student.459 Female students spoke of how some staff members took\nadvantage of their innocence, rubbing against them sexually while they were sitting on\ntheir laps.460 Abuse also took the form of voyeuristic humiliation: some staff insisted on\nwatching the students shower.461\nSome dormitory supervisors used their authority to institute dormitory-wide systems\nof abuse. Many students spoke of the fear and anxiety that spread across their dormitories\nin the evenings.462 They went to bed fearful that they might be called into the supervisor\u2019s\nroom.463 To protect themselves, some students attempted to never be alone.464 Older chil-\ndren sometimes sought to protect younger ones.465\nMost students came to school with little knowledge or understanding of sexual activ-\nity, let alone the types of sexual abuse to which they might be subjected. Abuse left them 78 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\ninjured, bewildered, and often friendless or subject to ridicule by other students.466 Many\nstudents thought they were the only children being abused. This confusion made it diffi-\ncult for them to describe or report their abuse.467 Some were told they would face eternal\ndamnation for speaking of what had been done to them.468\nMany students fought back against their far larger and more powerful assailants, espe-\ncially as they got older and stronger.469 Some succeeded in forcing their tormentors to leave\nthem alone.470 Many others, such as Lawrence Waquan, concluded that there was \u201cnoth-\ning you can do.\u201d471 Some students ran away from school in an attempt to escape abuse.472\nOthers begged their parents not to return them to school after a break.473\nSome students never reported abuse for fear they would not be believed.474 Other stu-\ndents who did report abuse were told that they were to blame.475 In some cases, school\nofficials took immediate action when abuse was reported to them, but the rarity of such\nactions is itself noteworthy.476 Former students spoke of how betrayed they felt when noth-\ning was done about their complaints.477 Many simply felt too ashamed to ever speak of\nthe abuse.478 Family members often refused to believe their children\u2019s reports of abuse,\nintensifying their sense of isolation and pain.479 This was especially so within families that\nhad adopted Christianity, and could not believe that the people of God looking after their\nchildren would ever do such things.480\nThe impact of abuse was immediate and long-lasting. It destroyed the students\u2019 ability\nto function in the school, and led many to turn to self-destructive behaviours.481\nStaff abuse of children created conditions for the student abuse of other students. Every\nschool system has to deal with school bullies, student cliques, and inter-student conflict.\nIt is part of the socialization process. Ideally, corrective lessons in how to treat others well\nare taught, as well as shown by example. Residential school staff had a responsibility not\nonly to model such behaviour, but also to protect students from being victimized. In many\ncases, they failed to provide that protection. Conflicts between students are not unique\nto residential schools, but they take on greater significance in a residential school setting\nwhere children cannot turn to adult family members for comfort, support, and redress.\nThe moral influences that a child\u2019s home community can exert are also absent. Instead,\nthe children were left vulnerable and unprotected. Residential schools failed to live up to\ntheir responsibility to protect students from being victimized by other students.\nOlder or bigger students used force\u2014or the threat of force\u2014to establish their domi-\nnance over younger students. In some cases, this dominance was used to coerce younger\nor smaller students to participate in sexual acts. In other cases, bullies forced vulnerable\nstudents to turn over their treats, their food, or their money, or to steal on their behalf. In\naddition, bullies might simply seek a measure of sadistic satisfaction from beating those\nwho were weaker. Bullies operated individually or in groups. Such groups were often\nformed initially as a defensive response to the level of violence within the school, but,\nover time, would take on their own offensive characteristics. Sometimes, such groups not\nonly focused their anger and/or frustration on other students, but also sought to disrupt The history \u2022 79\nthe general operation of the school. The fact that Catholic and Protestant church leaders\ncontinued to disparage one another\u2019s religions throughout this period meant that conflicts\nbetween students could also take on religious overtones, particularly in communities with\nmore than one residential school, such as Inuvik in the Northwest Territories.\nStudent victimization of students was an element of the broader abusive and coercive\nnature of the residential school system. Underfed, poorly housed, and starved for affec-\ntion, students often formed groups based on age, community of origin, or First Nation.\nSuch groups gave students a measure of identity and status, but also provided protection\nto their members and dominated more vulnerable students.\nWilliam Garson recalled that at the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school, \u201cwe were always like\nhiding in the corners; you know away from any abusement. From other, older, from older,\nelder boys, students.\u201d482 Percy Thompson said that at the Hobbema school, \u201cone bully used\nto come at me and he\u2019d pretend he was going to talk to me and all of sudden hit me in the\nbelly. And of course I gag, gag, and he\u2019d laugh his head off and, you know, to see me in\nsuch a predicament.\u201d483 Alice Ruperthouse spoke of \u201cthe cruelty of the other children\u201d at\nthe Amos, Qu\u00e9bec, school. \u201cIt was, you know, like in a jungle. Like in a jungle, you don\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to come out but you know you had to watch out.\u201d484 Albert Elias felt\nthat the classroom at the Anglican school in Aklavik \u201cwas the safest place to be in \u2019cause\nthat\u2019s where nobody could beat me up. I dreaded recesses and lunches and after school, I\ndreaded those times.\u201d485\nBullying might start shortly after arrival. In some schools, all new male students were\nput through a hazing. Denis Morrison said that each new arrival at the Fort Frances school\nunderwent a beating. \u201cThey used to initiate you, like, they would beat the hell out of you,\nthe other kids would. It wasn\u2019t anybody else, it was the other kids, the older ones, eh.\u201d486\nBob Baxter recalled that there were student gangs at the Sioux Lookout school. He was\nbeaten up and knifed on one occasion. He had a vivid memory of people tying him to his\nbed and throwing hot water over him.487 Clara Quisess said that at the Fort Albany school in\nOntario, older girls would threaten the younger ones with knives.488 Louisa Birote recalled\nthat the girls at the La Tuque, Qu\u00e9bec, school all formed themselves into hostile groups.\n\u201cWe hated each other. So, this little gang didn\u2019t like the other gang. That\u2019s the way at the\nschool, that\u2019s what we were taught, fears, and we were scared, and I went to hide in what\nwe called the junk room, the junk closet.\u201d489\nA lack of adequate supervision in the schools and residences meant that such domina-\ntion could give rise to physical and sexual abuse. The assaults ranged from being forced\nto kiss someone, to being forced to simulate a sex act, to being raped. In some cases, vic-\ntims were given small treats to encourage them to be silent; in other cases, they were told\nthey would be killed if they reported the assault.490 Agnes Moses recalled being molested\nby older girls at a hostel in northern Canada. \u201cI never quite understood it, and it really\nwrecked my life, it wrecked my life as a mother, a wife, a woman, and sexuality was a real,\nit was a dirty word for us.\u201d491 The experience of being abused at a British Columbia school 80 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nby a group of boys left Don Willie distrustful of most people. \u201cThe only, only friends I kept\nafter that were my relatives.\u201d492\nComplaints were infrequent, as students had good reason not to report their abuse.\nSome feared that bullies would retaliate if they were reported. Others were ashamed of\nwhat had been done to them, and some did not fully understand what had been done to\nthem. Many students feared they would not be believed\u2014or would be blamed for some-\nhow bringing the abuse upon themselves. Still others were further punished when they\ndid tell. So, rather than report the abuse, many students chose to fight back; to seek admis-\nsion into a receptive group, where violence could be fought with violence; or to endure the\npain in silence. This victimization left many students feeling intensely betrayed, fearful,\nisolated, and bereft of home teachings and protection. The betrayal by fellow students has\ncontributed significantly to the schools\u2019 long-term legacy of continuing division and dis-\ntrust within Aboriginal communities. The residential school system\u2019s shameful inability to\nprotect students from such victimization, even from among themselves, represents one of\nits most significant and least-understood failures.\nSports and culture: \u201cIt was a relief.\u201d\nMany students stated that sports helped them make it through residential school.\nChristina Kimball attended the Roman Catholic school near The Pas, where she experi-\nenced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. She believes that it was only through her\ninvolvement with sports that she survived. \u201cI was very sports-oriented. I played baseball.\nWell, we play baseball, and even hockey. We had a hockey team. That has benefited, ben-\nefited me in a way \u2019cause I loved playing sports. Well, that\u2019s one way, too. I don\u2019t know\nhow I did it but I was pretty good in sports.\u201d493 Noel Starblanket said that at the Qu\u2019Appelle\nschool, \u201cI had some good moments, in particular in the sports side, \u2019cause I really enjoyed\nsports. I was quite athletic, and basically that\u2019s what kept me alive, that\u2019s what kept me\ngoing was the sports.\u201d494 At the Lestock school, Geraldine Shingoose took refuge in extra-\ncurricular activities.\nOne of the good things that I would do to try and get out of just the abuse was try to,\nI would join track-meet, try and be, and I was quite athletic in boarding school. And\nI also joined the band, and I played a trombone. And, and that was something that\ntook me away from the school, and just to, it was a relief.495\nPaul Andrew spent seven years at Grollier Hall in Inuvik. One of his strongest and most\npositive memories related to school sports. \u201cThere were times when I felt dumb and stu-\npid. But put me in a gym, there was not too many people better than I am.\u201d496\nRecreational activities were always underfunded and undersupplied at the schools. A\nnational survey of Indian Affairs schools (both day and residential) in 1956 concluded: The history \u2022 81\nBoys playing hockey at the McIntosh, Ontario, school. Many students said that they would not have survived their\nresidential school years, were it not for sports. St. Boniface Historical Society, Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Manitoba Province Fonds,\nSHSB 29362.\nIn most of the schools there appeared to be little or no physical education program. A\nnumber of schools had no facilities for such activities. Basement areas were obviously\ndesigned for playing areas, but they were very inadequate and were utilized for\nstorage or for assembly purposes. A large number of school sites were not properly\ncleared, graded, and prepared for playing purposes. Many were still in the wild state;\nothers were overgrown with shrubs, thistles, grasses and other weeds presenting a\nvery unkempt and neglected appearance.497\nOblate Provincial L. Poupore wrote to Indian Affairs about conditions at the Williams\nLake, British Columbia, school in 1957. He pointed out that a year and half earlier, he had\ninformed Indian Affairs about the need for a school gymnasium. At that time, he said, \u201cThe\nboys\u2019 play room, a room about 35 by 60, was a scene of bedlam during recreation periods.\nThere were about 150 boys trying to play; the mud they had brought in on their feet had\ndried and there was so much dust in the room that you could not recognize a boy at the\nopposite end.\u201d Although the department had assured him the construction of a gymna-\nsium would be a priority, nothing had been done, and \u201cthe problem of playroom space is\nworse than ever.\u201d498\nDespite the lack of financial support, hockey teams from a number of schools achieved\nconsiderable success in the 1940s and 1950s. Teams from Duck Lake and Qu\u2019Appelle in\nSaskatchewan, in particular, established enviable records. The Duck Lake school team,\nthe St. Michael\u2019s Indians, won the championship of an eight-team league in the Rosthern\narea in 1946.499 In 1948, the same team, coached by Father G.-M. Latour, won the northern 82 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nGrandin College girls\u2019 basketball team, Northwest Territories.

In 1947, the Roman Catholic school at\nSechelt in North Vancouver advertised for a volunteer to run a school athletics program.\nNavy veteran Alex Strain took on the job. At the time, the school had no recreation pro-\ngram and no facilities. Under Strain\u2019s direction, the students cleared out a storage build-\ning and turned it into a gymnasium. Putting in four days of volunteer work a week, Strain\ncreated what Vancouver Sun reporter Gerry Pratt described as \u201cthe smoothest tumbling\nteam in the province.\u201d He then established a boxing program at the school. The limits of\nthe first ring were marked out by four rows of chairs. The first punching bag was a navy\nduffle bag filled with tumbling mats. After two years, Strain purchased a used truck and\ntook the students on a boxing tour of Vancouver Island. After four years in existence, the\nteam had won over 100 trophies. Sister John Lawrence made robes and shorts for each\nmember of the team and also served as trainer.503 Frederick Baker, the winner of the first\nnational Tom Longboat award, was a member of the Sechelt boxing team. Baker had won The history \u2022 83\nthree championships in 1948, two in 1949,\none in 1950, and one in 1951.504\nOther students sought solace in the arts.\nA number of former residential school\nstudents went on to prominent careers\nin the visual arts, including Alex Janvier,\nJackson Beardy, Judith Morgan, and Norval\nMorrisseau. Some, such as Beardy, were\nencouraged in their artistic endeavours by\nsympathetic staff.505 Like sports, cultural\nactivities were underfunded. They were\nalso often intended to encourage assimi-\nlation. In 1967, the students attending the\nShingwauk, Ontario, school put on a four-\nact play called Arrow to the Moon.

John, the\nboys\u2019 supervisor, noticed this was going on and took an interest, encouraging us to\nplay and sing.\nAt first we got together just for fun. But eventually \u2026 we formed a band. There were\nfive or six of us, and we call ourselves the Arctic Ramblers. We had guitars, fiddle,\nbass guitar, drums, and there was even a piano for a while.\nThey played at dances at the residence and in Hay River.507 Canadien went on to play in\nthe Chieftones, a rock-and-roll band that toured extensively across North America.508\nOn the rinks, the athletic fields, and parade grounds, or in the arts and handicraft\nrooms and on performance stages, many students found a way to express themselves, and,\nthrough that, gained the opportunity to explore their own talents and sometimes other\nparts of the country or the world. Most importantly, they gained some confidence in their\nability to achieve. 84 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nResistance: \u201cI am the father of this child.\u201d\nParents and children developed a variety of strategies to resist residential schooling.\nParents might refuse to enrol students, refuse to return runaways, or they might refuse to\nreturn students to school at the end of the summer holidays. They also called on the gov-\nernment to increase school funding; to establish day schools in their home communities;\nand to improve the quality of education, food, and clothing. In taking such measures, they\noften put themselves at risk of legal reprisals. Almost invariably, the system declined to\naccept the validity of parental and student criticisms. Parental influences were judged by\nschool and government officials to be negative and backward. The schools also suspected\nparents of encouraging their children in acts of disobedience.509 Once parents came to be\nviewed as the \u2018enemy,\u2019 their criticisms, no matter how valid, could be discounted.\nPrior to 1920, when the Indian Act was amended to allow Indian Affairs to compel chil-\ndren to attend residential school, the most effective form of resistance that parents could\nmake was to simply refuse to enrol their children. This measure was so effective that it con-\ntributed to the closure of a number of residential schools. The Battleford, Saskatchewan,\nschool, which had a capacity of 150 students, had an enrolment of thirty-five in 1915.510\nThe school was closed two years later.511 The High River, Alberta, school could also hold\nover 100 students, but by 1922, the year it closed, the school had an enrolment of only\nforty.512 The Middlechurch, Manitoba, school was not rebuilt after it burned down in 1906,\nin large measure because it could not recruit enough students.513 For similar reasons, the\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba, school closed in 1905; the Calgary, Alberta, school closed in 1907;\nthe Regina, Saskatchewan, school closed in 1910; the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school closed in\n1919; and the Red Deer, Alberta, school closed in 1919.514\nBy refusing to enrol their children in the industrial schools on the Prairies, parents not\nonly undermined the federal government\u2019s assimilation policies, but also deprived the\nschools of per capita grant revenue and student labour. As a result, the industrial schools\nran significant deficits, and overworked and underfed the children they did recruit. This\nled other parents to withdraw their children from the schools. This was never a risk-free\nchoice for parents. Often, residential schools were the only available schools. Parents who\nwished to see their children schooled had few, if any, options.515\nSometimes, government officials also took reprisals against parents who kept their\nchildren out of school, in some cases denying them food rations and Treaty payments.516\nParents continued to keep their children out of school well into the twentieth century: in\n1941, only forty-five students were enrolled in the Fort Providence school, which had an\nauthorized attendance of 100.517\nIn at least one instance, parents home-schooled their children. In 1941, Muriel, Doreen,\nand Kathleen Steinhauer were kept home from the Edmonton residential school because\ntheir parents were not satisfied with the progress they were making at the school.

When Principal G. Donckele informed them that when they signed the admission\nform, they had given the government the right to determine when their daughter would\nbe discharged, the father said, \u201cI am the father of this child and I do not care for what you\nand the government have to say about it.\u201d After being told that he could be prosecuted, the\nfather left with his daughter anyway.519\nIn 1913, when a mother removed her daughter from the Fort Resolution school, the\nMounted Police were called in and the mother surrendered the girl to the school.520 In\nresponse to the death of a student in 1922, local parents withdrew their children from the\nKitamaat, British Columbia, residential school. They agreed to return them only on the\ncondition that the principal \u201csign her name to a paper before us that she would see that the\nchildren got all the food they wanted, that they would be well cared for, and be supplied\nwith sufficient clothing.\u201d521\nIn March 1948, the principal of the Roman Catholic school at Cardston, Alberta, struck\na father who was attempting to take his son out of the school. In discussing the issue with\nIndian Affairs, the Blood Indian Council insisted on having the record note that this was\n\u201cnot the first time that Father Charron had hit an Indian.\u201d522 86 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nIt was not uncommon for the parents of an entire community or region to refuse to\nreturn their children to school. In the fall of 1926, for example, parents from communities\nin Manitoba\u2019s Interlake region announced they were not sending their children back to the\nElkhorn school. According to the parents, the children were not well fed, the older boys\ncompelled the younger boys to steal, and all children were poorly clothed.523 In October\n1927, seventy-five school-aged children from the Blood Reserve in Alberta either had not\nreturned to school or had not been enrolled in school. It took a letter from the police, plus\na follow-up visit from the Indian agent, to fill the Anglican and Catholic schools on the\nreserve.524 Two weeks after the start of the 1940 school year, fifty-four students had yet\nto return to the Fraser Lake, British Columbia, school. The police were called in, and by\nOctober 2, twenty-five of the students had been returned.525 This form of parental action\nwas common throughout the 1940s.526\nParents were eager to have their children properly educated, and often proposed real-\nistic and effective solutions. In 1905, parents of children attending the Roman Catholic\nboarding school in Squamish, British Columbia, petitioned to have the school converted\ninto an industrial school. The request was not granted, despite the fact that Indian Affairs\nofficials recognized that the boarding school grant allowed for only \u201cthe bare necessities\nin the line of food and clothing.\u201d527\nSome First Nations leaders who had originally supported residential schools later pub-\nlicly regretted their decision. Chief Napahkesit of the Pine Creek Band in Manitoba said in\n1917 that he was sorry he had ever supported the construction of the Pine Creek school.\nAccording to the local Indian agent, the chief felt \u201cthe children know less when they come\nout than they did when they went in.\u201d What was needed, the chief said, was a day school.528\nCalls for day schools were, in fact, a common parental request.529 A 1949 call from parents\nfor a day school at the Cowessess Reserve eventually proved to be successful.530\nParents might also demand the dismissal of a principal.531 In 1917, to back up their call for\nthe resignation of the Shoal Lake school principal, parents refused to return their children\nto the school.532 In this case, the principal did resign.533 The parents of the Kahkewistahaw\nBand unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to remove a teacher from the\nRound Lake, Saskatchewan, school in July 1949. They said that \u201cthe children\u2019s report cards\nare very unsatisfactory, worst ever received, and she abuses the children too much.534\nParents also complained that their children were not learning the skills they needed to\nsurvive. Chief Kejick of the Shoal Lake Band told Indian Affairs officials in 1928 that the\nstudents from his reserve \u201cdid not know how to make a living when they left school and\nwould like trades taught.\u201d535 Eight years later, Charlie Shingoose of the Waywayseecappo\nBand sought to have his fifteen-year-old son discharged from the Birtle school so he could\nteach him to \u201cwork, trap, etc.\u201d536\nParents also hired lawyers to press their cases for investigations into the deaths of chil-\ndren who had run away, to complain about the harshness of discipline, to advocate on The history \u2022 87\nbehalf of children who had been injured working at the schools, and to attempt to have\ntheir children discharged from school.537\nOne of the more unusual protests was mounted by First Nations people (Dene) in the\nNorthwest Territories, who, in 1937, refused to accept their Treaty payments in protest of\nconditions at the Fort Resolution school. Their children, they said, were \u201cliving in hell.\u201d538\nResidential schools also came under criticism from early First Nations organizations. At\nits meeting in Saddle Lake, Alberta, in 1931, the League of Indians of Canada called for the\nconstruction of more day schools to augment residential schools.539 The following year, the\nleague, by then known as the League of Indians of Western Canada, called for the closure\nof boarding schools.540 The league also recommended that only qualified teachers be hired\nto work at residential schools, that medical examinations be given to students before they\nwere sent to the schools, and that the half-day system be changed to allow for greater class\ntime.541\nIn an effort to bring their own residential schooling to an end, some students attempted\nto burn their schools down. There were at least thirty-seven such attempts, two of which\nended in student and staff deaths.542 For students, the most effective form of resistance was\nto run away. The principal of the Shingwauk Home in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, school in\nthe 1870s, E. F. Wilson, devoted a chapter of his memoirs to the topic of \u201cRunaway Boys.\u201d\nIt included the story of three boys who tried to make their way home by boat. They were\nfound alive more than ten days later, stranded on an island in the North Channel of Lake\nHuron.543\nAfter 1894, children enrolled in a residential school (or who had been placed there by\ngovernment order because it was felt that they were not being properly cared for by their\nparents) but who were refusing to show up at school were considered to be \u201ctruant.\u201d Under\nthe Indian Act and its regulations, they could be returned to the school against their will.\nChildren who ran away from residential schools were also considered to be truants. Parents\nwho supported their children in their truancy were often threatened with prosecution.544\nMost runaway students headed for their home communities. Students knew they might\nbe caught, returned, and punished. Still, they believed the effort to make it home and have\na measure of freedom was worth it. In some cases, in fact, the schools failed to force run-\naways to return.545 Some students eluded capture. Instead of heading home, some went to\nwork for local farmers and, as a result, were able to avoid their pursuers for considerable\nperiods of time.546\nRunning away could be risky. At least thirty-three students died, usually due to exposure,\nafter running away from school.547 In a significant number of cases, parents and Indian\nAffairs officials concluded that the deaths could have been prevented if school officials\nhad mounted earlier and more effective searches and notified police officials and family\nmembers.548 In the case of Charles and Tom Ombash, two brothers who ran away from the\nSioux Lookout school on October 5, 1956, school officials waited until November before 88 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nBoys cutting wood at the Williams Lake, British Columbia, school in either the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.

However, the first sys-\ntem-wide policy outlining the procedures to be taken when a child ran away from school\nthat the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has located in the documents\nit has reviewed dates from 1953. This was seventy-five years after the government began\nits residential school system. That policy simply stated, \u201cThe principal shall take prompt\naction to effect the return to school of any truant pupil, and shall report promptly to the\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency, every case of truancy.\u201d551 The nature of the prompt action\nwas undefined. In particular, there was no requirement to contact either the child\u2019s par-\nents or the police. It was not until 1971 that a more encompassing, nation-wide, policy was\nannounced.552\nIn pursuing children to their parents\u2019 homes, the actions of school employees could\nbe both invasive and disrespectful.553 In the town of Lebret, Saskatchewan, \u201call the houses\nwere checked\u201d by the police as part of a search for two runaways from the File Hills school\nin 1935.554\nRunning away was not in itself a crime. However, most students were wearing school-is-\nsued clothing when they ran away, and, in some cases, principals tried, and even suc-\nceeded, in having them prosecuted for stealing the clothing they were wearing.555 Students The history \u2022 89\nwho ran away numerous times also could be charged under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\nIn such cases, they could be sentenced to a reformatory until they turned twenty-one.556\nThe 1894 Indian Act amendments made parents who did not return truants to school\nsubject to prosecution. The Mounted Police were often called in to force parents to send\ntheir children to school.557 The Blue Quills, Alberta, school journal entry for May 1, 1932,\nreads: \u201cThe savages having received the order to bring their children to school unless they\nwant the police to get involved, some parents did obey the order today. But there are still\nthose who turn a deaf ear.\u201d558 In 1937, a father who refused to return his son to the Sandy\nBay, Manitoba, school was sentenced to ten days in jail. To prevent him from running away\nagain, the boy was sent to a school in Saskatchewan.559\nParents were often outraged at having to return runaways. Wallace Hahawahi\u2019s father\nwas reported as being \u201cvery indignant\u201d at the prospect of sending his son back to the\nBrandon school in 1936. The boy was over sixteen and needed to help out at home. In\nthis case, the father\u2019s argument prevailed and the boy was discharged.560 Another run-\naway from the same school, Kenneth Thompson, told the police, \u201cI am a Treaty Indian\nof Assiniboine Indian Reserve, I am 17 year of Age. I wish to state the reason I ran away\nfrom school was because I have to work too hard in fact I do not study at all. I am working\naround the school all the time. I consider if I have to work I may as well work at home for\nmy father.\u201d561 Despite his argument, he was returned to the school.562\nIndian agents often referred to ongoing truancy issues at specific schools as \u201cepidem-\nics.\u201d The agents viewed such epidemics as a sign of underlying problems at a school. In\n1928, Indian agent J. Waddy wrote that at the Anglican school in The Pas, \u201chardly a day\ngoes bye [sic] that one or more do not take leave on their own account.\u201d563 In 1935, ten\npupils ran away from the Birtle, Manitoba, school.564 In the closing years of the 1930s,\nthe Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia experienced continual truancy problems. It was\nnot uncommon for some students to make numerous attempts to leave the school. On\nthe morning of July 7, 1937, Andrew Julian decided not to join the other boys assigned\nto milk the school\u2019s dairy herd. Instead, he headed for Truro, where he was reported as\nbeing sighted in the rail yard. He was not located until the end of the month. By then, he\nhad made it to Nyanza in Cape Breton, a distance of 260 miles (418.4 kilometres) from the\nschool.565 The following year, Steven Labobe (also given as LaBobe) managed to make it\nback to his home on Prince Edward Island. The principal decided not to demand the boy\u2019s\nreturn.566 Other boys were not so lucky. One boy, who ran away five times, was eventually\nplaced in a private reformatory.567\nMany students said they ran away to escape the discipline of the school. Ken Lacquette\nattended residential schools in Brandon and Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. \u201cThey used to\ngive us straps all the time with our pants down they\u2019d give us straps right in the public.\nThen \u2026 this started happening, after awhile when I was getting old enough I started taking\noff from there, running away.\u201d568 Others were seeking to escape something far more sinister 90 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthan corporal punishment. After being subjected to ongoing sexual abuse, Anthony Wilson\nran away from the Alberni school.569\nIn the 1940s, Arthur McKay regularly ran away from the Sandy Bay school. \u201cI didn\u2019t\neven know where my home was, the first time right away. But these guys are the ones;\nmy friends were living in nearby reserve, what they call Ebb and Flow, that\u2019s where they\nwere going so I followed.\u201d570 Ivan George and a group of his friends ran away from the\nMission, British Columbia, school when he was eleven years old. They were strapped on\ntheir return. Despite this, he ran away two more times that school year.571\nMuriel Morrisseau ran away from the Fort Alexander school almost every year she was\nat the school. The experience was often frightening. \u201cI remember running away again try-\ning to cross the river and it started freezing up, we all got scared, we had to come back again\nwith a tail under our legs.\u201d572 Isaac Daniels ran away from the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,\nschool with two older boys. Their escape route involved crossing a railway bridge. Partway\nacross, Daniels became too frightened to continue and turned back.573 Dora Necan ran\naway from the Fort Frances school with a friend. They made it to the United States and\nstayed there for three days before returning to the school.574 Nellie Cournoyea was shel-\ntered by Aboriginal families along her route when she ran away from an Anglican hostel in\nthe Northwest Territories after a confrontation with a teacher.575 When Lawrence Waquan\nran away from the Fort Chipewyan school in 1965, there were no roads and no one along\nthe way to support him. \u201cI walked from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta to Fort Smith,\n130 miles. It took me about five days. I was only about sixteen. And I just ate berries and\ndrank water to survive.\u201d576\nWhen Beverley Anne Machelle and her friends ran away from the Lytton, British\nColumbia, school, they had to contend with the school\u2019s isolated and mountain-\nous location.\nIt was halfway down this big hill, and then from there you could see town. And we got\nhalfway down there, and we were all feeling, like, woo-hoo, you know, and we got out\nof there, and, and we\u2019re gonna go do something fun, and, and then we got halfway\ndown, and then we realized, well, we have no money, and we have no place to go.\nThere was no place to go. There was no safe place to go.577\nThe girls at the Sioux Lookout school rebelled in 1955 when they were all sent to bed\nearly after a number of girls had been caught stealing. They barricaded themselves in their\ndormitory and refused to allow any staff to enter.578 There was a similar revolt in Edmonton\nin the 1960s, when students blocked staff entry to the dormitory at night, to protest the\nabuse of students.579\nCollectively and individually, parents and students did resist the residential school\nattack on Aboriginal families and communities. On occasion, they won small victories:\na child might be discharged; a day school might be built. However, as long as Aboriginal\npeople were excluded from positions of control over their children\u2019s education, the root\ncauses of the conflict remained unresolved.

Phototh\u00e8que, Library and\nArchives Canada, PA-048575.\nThe staff: \u201cMy aim was to do something good.\u201d\nFor most of their history, residential schools were staffed by individuals who were\nrecruited by Christian missionary organizations. Generally, the churches appointed a\npriest or minister, as opposed to an educator, as the principal. The Roman Catholic schools\ncould draw staff from a number of Catholic religious orders, whose members had made\nexplicit vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. In the spirit of those vows, they would be\nobliged to go where they were sent, would not expect payment, and would have no fami-\nlies to support. Indian Commissioner David Laird believed that since members of Roman\nCatholic religious orders received very little in exchange for their services, the Roman\nCatholic schools could \u201cafford to have a much larger staff than where ordinary salaries\nare paid, and there is consequently less work for each to do, without interfering with the\nquality of the work done.\u201d580 The Protestant schools recruited many of their staff members\nthrough missionary organizations.\nMany of the early school staff members believed they were participating in a moral cru-\nsade. In her history of the McDougall Orphanage, the predecessor of the Morley school\nin Alberta, Mrs. J. McDougall described the work of the mission and orphanage as \u201cgoing\nout after the wild and ignorant and bringing them into a Christian home and blessing the\nbody, culturing the mind and trying to raise spiritual vision.\u201d581 92 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nStaff members were often motivated by a spirit of adventure as well as a religious com-\nmitment. As a young seminary student in Corsica, a French island in the Mediterranean,\nNicolas Coccola wanted more than a life as a priest. In his memoir, he wrote, \u201cThe desire\nof foreign missions with the hope of martyrdom appeared to me as a higher calling.\u201d He\nended up living out his life as a residential school principal in British Columbia.582 As a\nsmall boy in England in the middle of the nineteenth century, Gibbon Stocken read with\nenthusiasm the missionary literature sent to him by an aunt. When he turned seventeen, he\nvolunteered his services to the Anglican Church Missionary Society. He hoped to be sent\nto India. Instead, he was offered a position on the Blackfoot Reserve in what is now south-\nern Alberta.583 British-born nurse and midwife Margaret Butcher managed to get to India,\nwhere she worked for a British family. From there, she made her way to British Columbia,\nwhere she worked with a Methodist mission to Japanese immigrants.584 In 1916, she was\non her way to a job at the Methodist residential school in Kitamaat, British Columbia.585\nThis mix of motivations continued throughout the system\u2019s history. Lorraine Arbez,\nwho worked at the Qu\u2019Appelle school in the 1950s, said, \u201cI chose this career to work with\nthe children and my aim was to do something good with them and I hope I was of some\nuse.\u201d586 For Noreen Fischbuch, who worked at schools in Ontario and Alberta in the 1950s\nand 1960s, the residential schools offered much-needed experience: \u201cAs far as I was con-\ncerned, it was a teaching job, it was with the kids and I liked the kids.\u2026 The kids were\ngetting an education; I had a job.\u201d587 George Takashima, who taught at Sioux Lookout,\nexplained, \u201cI was just sort of adventuresome, you might say.\u201d588\nAlmost all the staff members were poorly paid. Government officials took the position\nthat because many of the staff members belonged to missionary organizations, pay was\na \u201cminor consideration.\u201d589 As a result, the schools had problems recruiting and keeping\nstaff. Alexander Sutherland of the Methodist Church was particularly outspoken about the\nlink between low wages and the difficulties the schools had in recruiting staff. In 1887,\nhe wrote to the minister of Indian Affairs about the \u201cdifficulty of obtaining efficient and\nproperly qualified teachers, on account of the meagre salaries paid.\u201d590 The issue of low\npay never went away. More than half a century later, in 1948, C. H. Birdsall, the chair of\nthe United Church committee responsible for the Edmonton school, complained that it\n\u201cis impossible for the Residential School to offer salaries in competition with\u201d rates that\nIndian Affairs was paying teachers at day schools. Given the inadequate quality of accom-\nmodation, equipment, and staff at the school, he felt that it was \u201cdoubtful the present work\nwith Indian Children could properly be called education.\u201d591 Many of the Catholic schools\nsurvived on what amounted to volunteer labour. In 1948, Sechelt principal H. F. Dunlop\ninformed Ottawa, \u201cIf this school kept out of the red during the past year it was largely due\nto the fact that four Oblates, working here full time, received in salaries from Jan 1947 to\nJan 1948 the grand total of $1800.\u201d592 As late as 1960, the nuns at the Christie Island school\nwere being paid $50 a month\u2014a fact that made Principal A. Noonan \u201cfeel like a heel.\u201d593 The history \u2022 93\nMany qualified and experienced peo-\nple worked in the schools.

She had\nalso trained as a deaconess in Toronto, and\nworked in China from 1909 to 1927.594 The\nmatron at the Anglican Wabasca, Alberta,\nschool in 1933 was a nurse.595 Among the\nstaff at the Norway House school in the\nearly twentieth century were the sisters\nCharlotte Amelia and Lilian Yeomans.\nCharlotte had trained as a nurse, and Lilian\nwas one of the first women in Canada to\nqualify as a doctor.596 Theresa Reid had four\nyears of teaching experience and a teach-\ning certificate before she applied to work at\nNorway House,597 George Takashima had a\nteaching certificate,598 and Olive Saunders The chief cook at Lapointe Hall in Fort Simpson, Northwest\nhad a university degree and several years Territories. The schools were highly dependent on female\nlabour. Northwest Territories Archives, N-1992-255-0144.\nof teaching experience.599 In 1966, E.\nO. Drouin, the principal of the Roman\nCatholic school in Cardston, boasted that out of the twenty-one people on his staff, ten\nhad university degrees. Drouin, himself, had left his position as a university professor to\ngo to work at the school.600\nA number of people devoted their adult lives to working in residential schools. At\nleast twelve principals died in office.601 Kuper Island principal George Donckele resigned\nin January 1907; by June of that year, he was dead.602 Sherman Shepherd served at the\nAnglican schools in Shingle Point on the Arctic Ocean in the Yukon, Aklavik (Northwest\nTerritories), Fort George (Qu\u00e9bec), and Moose Factory (Ontario), resigning in 1954 after\ntwenty-five years of service in northern Canada.603 Others worked into their old age, since,\ndue to low pay, their savings were also low and pensions were minimal. When the sev-\nenty-three-year-old matron of the Ahousaht school in British Columbia retired in 1929,\nPrincipal W. M. Wood recommended that she be given an honorarium of a month\u2019s salary\nas appreciation for her years of service. Woods noted that she was \u201cretiring with very lim-\nited means.\u201d604\nSuch long service was not the norm. Because the pay was often low and the working\nand living conditions were difficult, turnover was high throughout the system\u2019s history.\nFrom 1882 to 1894, there was what amounted to an annual full turnover of teachers at the\nFort Simpson (now Port Simpson), British Columbia, school. At one point, all the teaching 94 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nwas being done by the local Methodist missionary Thomas Crosby, his wife, Emma, and\nthe school matron.605 Between January 1958 and March 1960, a period of just over two\nyears, the Alert Bay school lost fifty-eight staff members. Of these, nineteen had been fired\nbecause they were deemed to be incompetent. Eight others left because they were angry\nwith the principal.606 In 1958, the Benedictine Sisters announced that their order would no\nlonger be providing the Christie, British Columbia, school with staff from its monastery\nin Mount Angel, Oregon. According to the prioress of the Benedictine monastery, Mother\nMary Gemma, meeting residential school needs had left the members of the order physi-\ncally and mentally exhausted. \u201cOne of my youngest teachers had to have shock treatments\nthis year and two others may have to.\u201d In the previous two and a half years, the order had\nlost fourteen teachers.607 These examples are confirmed by the overall statistics. The aver-\nage annual turnover rate for all Indian Affairs schools from 1956\u201357 to 1963\u201364 was 25%.608\nThe schools were heavily dependent on female labour. The Roman Catholics relied\non female religious orders to staff and operate the residential schools.609 The Protestants\nwere equally reliant upon the underpaid work of female staff. Austin McKitrick, the prin-\ncipal of the Presbyterian school at Shoal Lake in northwestern Ontario, acknowledged this\nwhen he wrote in 1901, \u201cI think if we men were to put ourselves in the places of some\noverworked, tired-out women, we would perhaps not stand it so patiently as they often\ndo.\u201d610 One missionary wrote that, knowing what he did about what was expected of female\nmissionaries, he would discourage any daughter of his from working for the Methodist\nWomen\u2019s Missionary Society.611\nAlthough women usually worked in subordinate roles, the 1906 Indian Affairs annual\nreport listed eleven female principals. All worked at boarding schools, as opposed to indus-\ntrial schools. Seven of them were Roman Catholic, two were Anglican, one was Methodist,\nand one was Presbyterian.612 One of these principals was Kate Gillespie. After teaching at\nday schools on reserves near Kamsack and Prince Albert, she was appointed principal of\nthe File Hills school in 1901, a position she held until her marriage in 1908.613\nThe schools employed many more people than principals and teachers. Most schools\nwere mini-communities. There were cooks, seamstresses, housekeepers, matrons, disci-\nplinarians, farmers, carpenters, blacksmiths, engineers (to operate the heating and electri-\ncal generators), shoemakers, and even bandmasters.614 Smaller schools such as the United\nChurch Crosby Girls\u2019 Home in Port Simpson, British Columbia, made do with a staff of\nonly three people in 1935.615 The Roman Catholic school at Kamloops, British Columbia,\nhad at least nineteen staff in that same year.616 The Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, residence\nhad over fifty employees during the 1966\u201367 school year.617\nWorkloads were heavy, and time off was rare. The seven-day week was the norm for\nmany employees. An 1896 report on the Mount Elgin school noted, \u201cNo holidays are given\nor allowed to the staff; all days or parts of days lost time are deducted from their wages.\u201d618\nThe policy at the Anglican schools into the 1920s was to allow \u201cone full day off duty each\nmonth.\u201d619 Indian agent F. J. C. Ball predicted that a sixty-three-year-old employee of the The history \u2022 95\nLytton school was headed for a nervous breakdown in 1922. According to Ball, the man\nwas \u201cacting as teacher, minister, janitor and general handy man around the School. He\nalso has charge of the boys [sic] dormitory at night.\u201d620\nStaff meals were generally superior to those provided to the students. Staff members,\nparticularly in the early years of the system, had greater immunity than their students to\nmany of the diseases that plagued residential schools. Despite this, the living conditions\nthat prevailed in many schools took a toll on staff. In 1896, E. B. Glass, the principal of\nthe Whitefish Lake school in what is now Alberta, said the deterioration in the health of\none staff member was the result of having to work in an inadequately heated and poorly\ninsulated schoolhouse in which the \u201ccold wind whistled up through the floor.\u201d Glass said\nthat \u201cthe Department which charges itself with building, repairing and furnishing school\nhouses, should also charge itself with neglect and the suffering endured by the teacher\nfrom that neglect.\u201d621\nDisease and illness also claimed the children of married staff members. Emma Crosby,\nwho helped found the Crosby Girls\u2019 Home in Port Simpson in the late 1870s, buried four\nof her children at Port Simpson. Two of them had succumbed to diphtheria.622 Elizabeth\nMatheson, the wife of the Onion Lake principal, lost a daughter to whooping cough and\na son to meningeal croup in the early years of the twentieth century.623 During her fourth\npregnancy, Elizabeth Matheson was so depressed that she considered suicide.624\nMissionary staff, particularly in the early years of the system, were extremely hostile to\nAboriginal culture.625 They commonly described Aboriginal people as \u201clazy.\u201d626 The long-\ntime principal of the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia, J. P. Mackey, was expressing\nthese views in the 1930s. In one letter, he described Aboriginal people as natural liars. \u201cFor\nmyself, I never hope to catch up with the Indian and his lies, and in fact I am not going\nto try.\u201d627 Others, however, spoke out on behalf of Aboriginal people. Hugh McKay, the\nsuperintendent of Presbyterian missionary work among Aboriginal people, criticized the\nfederal government for failing to implement its Treaty promises and for failing to alleviate\nthe hunger crisis on the Prairies.628 Similarly, William Duncan, the Anglican missionary\nat Metlakatla, British Columbia, advised the Tsimshian on how to advance arguments in\nfavour of Aboriginal title.629\nSometimes, staff protested the way students were treated. When two staff members of\nthe Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, school resigned in 1952, they complained of the harsh\ndisciplinary regime at the school.630 In 1957, Helen Clafton, an ex-dormitory supervisor,\nwrote of how, at the Lytton, British Columbia, school, \u201cthe \u2018strap\u2019 is altogether too much\nin evidence.\u201d631\nAboriginal people also worked for the schools. The Mohawk Institute hired former\nstudent Isaac Barefoot to work as a teacher in 1869. Barefoot went on to serve as acting\nprincipal and was later ordained as an Anglican minister.632 Another former student,\nSusan Hardie, obtained her teaching certificate in 1886.633 She was the school governess\nas early as 1894, and was paid $200 a year.634 She retired at the beginning of the 1936\u201337 96 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nschool year.635 A young Oneida woman, Miss\nCornelius, taught at the Regina school in the\nearly twentieth century.636 She left the fol-\nlowing year, lured away to a better paying\nschool in the United States.637 In the early\n1930s, the Brandon school hired former\nstudent Lulu Ironstar as a teacher.638 But\nthese were exceptions, not the rule. As late\nas 1960, there were only twenty-three First\nNations teachers working in residential\nschools across the country. Nineteen taught\nacademic subjects and the other four taught\nhome economics and industrial arts.639 Stan\nMcKay, who was educated at the Birtle and\nBrandon residential schools, taught in the\nNorway House, Manitoba, school in the\n1960s. Although there was much that he Miss Cornelius, an Oneida woman, taught at the\nRegina, Saskatchewan, school in the early twentieth\nenjoyed about the work, he left after two\ncentury. Saskatchewan Archives Board, R-B992.\nyears. In his opinion, the education he was\nbeing forced to provide was not relevant to\nthe lives of the children. There was, for example, a heavy emphasis on English, and no\nrecognition of the role of Cree in the communities from which the children came. \u201cThey\nwere doomed to fail under the system that existed. The majority of them would certainly\nand did.\u201d640\nVerna Kirkness, who was raised on the Fisher River First Nation in Manitoba, taught at\nboth the Birtle and Norway House schools.641 She did not like the atmosphere at the Birtle\nschool, where, she felt, administrators discouraged students from spending additional\ntime with her. In her memoir, she wrote that she \u201cwondered if they were afraid the children\nwould tell me things about their lives away from the classroom.\u201d642\nIt was in the 1960s that a number of Aboriginal people were promoted to the position of\nschool principal. Ahab Spence, a former residential school student, was appointed princi-\npal of the Sioux Lookout school in 1963.643 Under Spence\u2019s administration, the school had\na staff of twenty-three, half of whom were Aboriginal.644 Colin Wasacase became the prin-\ncipal of the Presbyterian school in Kenora in 1966.645 In keeping with past practice, his wife\nwas made school matron.646 This trend continued into the 1970s, when Aboriginal peo-\nple were appointed to administrative positions at numerous residential schools, includ-\ning those in Mission and Kamloops, British Columbia; Blue Quills, Alberta; Prince Albert,\nDuck Lake, and Qu\u2019Appelle, Saskatchewan; and Fort George, Qu\u00e9bec.647 Although the total\nnumber of schools declined rapidly from 1969 onwards, they became a significant source\nof Aboriginal employment, particularly in Saskatchewan, where six schools were operated The history \u2022 97\nby First Nations educational authorities. Of the 360 people working in the Saskatchewan\nschools in 1994, 220 were of Aboriginal ancestry\u2014almost two-thirds of the total.648\nMost of the Aboriginal people who were hired by the schools worked as cooks, cleaners,\nand handymen. In 1954, Mrs. Clair, a Cree woman who had attended the school at Lac La\nRonge, Saskatchewan, was working at the Carcross school in the Yukon. She was described\nby a superintendent as a \u201cvery fine person, willing worker and everyone likes her. Can\ncertainly get the most out of the children.\u201d649 At the Wabasca, Alberta, school, Alphonse\nAlook was seen as being \u201ca tower of strength to the Principal especially of late. Can do\nfair carpentering and is loyal to the school. Principal recommends an increase in his sal-\nary.\u201d650 Four young Aboriginal women, three of whom were sisters, had been hired to work\nat the Fort George, Qu\u00e9bec, school in 1953.651 A 1956 report on three of them said, \u201cThe\nHerodier girls are all doing a fine job.\u201d They were not, however, being housed in the same\nway as non-Aboriginal staff. The report observed that it was fortunate that \u201cthe native girls\ndo not mind doubling up in cramped quarters otherwise staff accommodation would be\ninsufficient.\u201d652\nA number of former Aboriginal staff members felt they helped make an important dif-\nference in the lives of the students. Jeanne Rioux went to the Edmonton school and later\nworked as a supervisor at the Hobbema school in Alberta. There, she challenged staff\nabout the way they disciplined children.653 Mary Chapman was a former residential school\nstudent who later worked in the kitchen of the Kuper Island school. At her prompting,\nthe school began serving students and staff the same meals. It was her rule that \u201cif we\nrun out of roast, the kids run out of roast, I don\u2019t give them bologna, I take the roast from\nthe staff and I give it to them.\u201d654 Vitaline Elsie Jenner, who had unhappily attended the\nFort Chipewyan, Alberta, residential school, worked as a girls\u2019 supervisor at Breynat Hall,\nthe Roman Catholic residence at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. To her surprise, she\nenjoyed most of the experience. She recalled being asked by one staff person what sort of\ngames she thought the children would like to play to make them feel at home. \u201cI said, \u2018You\nknow I bet you they all want to be hugged, like I was in that residential school. \u2019Cause you\nknow what? They\u2019re away from their parents.\u2019\u201d655\nFormer staff and the children of former staff members have expressed the view that\nmuch of the discussion of the history of residential schools has overlooked both the pos-\nitive intent with which many staff members approached their work, and the positive\naccomplishments of the school system. Although they certainly believed the system was\nunderfunded, they also believed that they and their parents devoted much of their lives to\neducating and caring for Aboriginal children.\nMost of the staff members did not make a career in residential schools, spending only a\nyear or two at a school before moving on. Others stayed for many years in conditions that\nwere often very different from what they grew up with, working for low pay, and living in\ncramped and confined quarters with, at times, less than congenial colleagues. They spent\ntheir time teaching, cooking, cleaning, farming, and supervising children. On their own, 98 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthese can be seen as positive, not negative, activities. For the most part, the school staff\nmembers were not responsible for the policies that separated children from their parents\nand lodged them in inadequate and underfunded facilities. In fact, many staff members\nspent much of their time and energy attempting to humanize a harsh and often destruc-\ntive system. Along with the children\u2019s own resilience, such staff members share credit for\nany positive results of the schools.\nAgreement and apologies\nDuring the years in which the federal government was slowly closing the residential\nschool system, Aboriginal people across the country were establishing effective regional\nand national organizations. In the courts and the legislatures, they argued for the recog-\nnition of Aboriginal rights, particularly the right to self-government. They forced the gov-\nernment to withdraw its 1969 White Paper that aimed at terminating Aboriginal rights,\nthey placed the settling of land claims on the national agenda, ensured that Aboriginal\nrights were entrenched in the Constitution, and saw the creation of a new jurisdiction\nwithin Canada\u2014the territory of Nunavut\u2014with an Inuit majority population. These\ndevelopments were part of a global movement asserting the rights of Indigenous peoples.\nCanadian Aboriginal leaders played a key role in this movement. For example, they were\ncentral in the creation of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples in 1975.656 The work of\nthe council laid the groundwork for the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples.657\nFrom the 1960s onwards, many people within the churches began to re-evaluate both\nthe broader history of the relations between the churches and Aboriginal peoples, and\nthe specific history of the residential schools. Many church organizations provided sup-\nport to Aboriginal campaigns on such issues as land and Treaty rights. In the 1980s, the\nchurches began to issue apologies to Aboriginal people. One of the first of these, issued\nin 1986 by the United Church of Canada, focused on the destructive impact that church\nmissionary work had on Aboriginal culture.658 The Oblate order offered an apology in 1991\nthat referred to the residential schools.659 Apologies relating specifically to their roles in\noperating residential schools were issued by the Anglicans in 1993, the Presbyterians in\n1994, and the United Church in 1998.660\nAboriginal people also began both individually and collectively to push for the pros-\necution of individuals who had abused students at residential schools and for compen-\nsation for former students. In 1987, Nora Bernard, a former student of the Shubenacadie\nresidential school, began interviewing fellow Survivors in the kitchen of her home in\nTruro, Nova Scotia.661 In 1995, she formed the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School\nSurvivors Association and started registering Survivors. The work of former students\nfrom the schools in places as distant as Fort Albany, Ontario; Chesterfield Inlet, then The history \u2022 99\nin the Northwest Territories; and Williams Lake, British Columbia, led to several police\ninvestigations, and a limited number of prosecutions and convictions. They also led to\nthe creation of local and national organizations of former residential school students. Phil\nFontaine, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, placed the issue on the\nnational agenda in October 1990 when he spoke publicly about the abuse that he and his\nfellow students had experienced at the Fort Alexander school.662\nFormer students also filed lawsuits against the federal government and the churches\nover the treatment that they received in the schools. Although they were successful\nin a number of these cases, courts were not willing to provide compensation for some\nissues of importance to Aboriginal peoples, such as the loss of language and culture. By\nOctober 2001, more than 8,500 residential school Survivors had filed lawsuits against the\nfederal government, the churches, related organizations, and, where possible, the indi-\nvidual who committed the abuse.663 By 2005, it was estimated that the volume surpassed\n18,000 lawsuits.664 Former students also commenced class-action lawsuits for compen-\nsation. Although lower courts rejected their right to pursue such claims, in 2004, the\nOntario Court of Appeal ruled that one of these cases (known as the \u201cCloud case\u201d) should\nbe allowed to proceed.665 Within months, the federal government agreed to enter into a\nprocess intended to negotiate a settlement to the growing number of class-action suits.\nThe Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (irssa) was reached in 2006 and\napproved by the courts in the following year. The irssa has five main components: 1) a\nCommon Experience Payment; 2) an Independent Assessment Process; 3) support for\nthe Aboriginal Health Foundation; 4) support for residential school commemoration; and\n5) the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. Through the\nCommon Experience Payment, former students would receive a payment of $10,000 for\nthe first year that they attended a residential school, and an additional $3,000 for each\nadditional year or partial year of attendance. The Independent Assessment Process adju-\ndicated and compensated the claims of those students who were physically or sexually\nabused at the schools. Funding was also provided to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation\nto support initiatives addressing the residential school legacy. The Settlement Agreement\ncommitted the federal government to funding initiatives to commemorate the residential\nschool experience. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was mandated\nto tell Canadians about the history of residential schools and the impact those schools had\non Aboriginal peoples, and to guide a process of reconciliation.\nThe court approval of the irssa in 2007 was followed in June 2008 with Prime Minister\nStephen Harper\u2019s apology on behalf of Canada. In his statement, the prime minister rec-\nognized that the primary purpose of the schools had been to remove children from their\nhomes and families in order to assimilate them better into the dominant culture. Harper\nsaid, \u201cThese objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual\nbeliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, \u2018to kill 100 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthe Indian in the child.\u2019 Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has\ncaused great harm, and has no place in our country.\u201d666\nThe prime minister was joined by the leaders of the other parties represented in the\nCanadian House of Commons. The Liberal leader of the opposition, the Honourable\nSt\u00e9phane Dion, recognized that the government\u2019s policy had \u201cdestroyed the fabric of fam-\nily in First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit communities. Parents and children were made to feel\nworthless. Parents and grandparents were given no choice. Their children were stolen from\nthem.\u201d667 The Bloc Qu\u00e9becois leader, the Honourable Gilles Duceppe, asked Canadians\nto \u201cpicture a small village, a small community. Now picture all of its children, gone. No\nmore children between seven and sixteen playing in the lanes or the woods, filling the\nhearts of their elders with their laughter and joy.\u201d668 The New Democratic Party leader, the\nHonourable Jack Layton, called on Canadians to help\nreverse the horrific and shameful statistics afflicting Aboriginal populations, now: the\nhigh rates of poverty, suicide, the poor or having no education, overcrowding, crum-\nbling housing, and unsafe drinking water. Let us make sure that all survivors of the\nresidential schools receive the recognition and compensation that is due to them.669\nIn his response, Phil Fontaine, then National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said\nthe apology marked a new dawn in the relationship between Aboriginal people and the\nrest of Canada. He also called attention to the \u201cbrave survivors,\u201d who, by \u201cthe telling of their\npainful stories, have stripped white supremacy of its authority and legitimacy. The irresist-\nibility of speaking truth to power is real.\u201d670 National Chief of the Congress of Aboriginal\nPeoples Patrick Brazeau spoke of how the resiliency, courage, and strength of residential\nschool Survivors had inspired all Aboriginal people.671 Mary Simon, President of the Inuit\nTapiriit Kanatami, said, in tackling the hard work that remained to be done, \u201cLet us now\njoin forces with the common goal of working together to ensure that this apology opens\nthe door to a new chapter in our lives as aboriginal peoples and in our place in Canada.\u201d672\nClem Chartier, President of the M\u00e9tis National Council, noted that he had attended a resi-\ndential school, and pointed out that many issues regarding the relationship between M\u00e9tis\npeople and residential schools still were not resolved. He said, \u201cI also feel deeply con-\nflicted, because there is still misunderstanding about the situation of the M\u00e9tis Nation,\nour history and our contemporary situation.\u201d673 Beverley Jacobs, President of the Native\nWomen\u2019s Association of Canada, spoke of how Aboriginal communities were recovering\ntheir traditions. \u201cNow we have our language still, we have our ceremonies, we have our\nelders, and we have to revitalize those ceremonies and the respect for our people not only\nwithin Canadian society but even within our own peoples.\u201d674\nThe Settlement Agreement and the formal apology by Prime Minister Stephen Harper\nrepresent the culmination of years of political struggle, changes in societal attitudes, court\ndecisions, and negotiation. Through it all, the Survivors kept the issue alive.

The legacy of the schools\nremains. One can see the impact of a system that disrupted families in the high number of\nAboriginal children who have been removed from their families by child-welfare agencies.\nAn educational system that degraded Aboriginal culture and subjected students to humil-\niating discipline must bear a portion of responsibility for the current gap between the edu-\ncational success of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The health of generations of\nAboriginal children was undermined by inadequate diets, poor sanitation, overcrowded\nconditions, and a failure to address the tuberculosis crisis that was ravaging the coun-\ntry\u2019s Aboriginal community. There should be little wonder that Aboriginal health status\nremains far below that of the general population. The over-incarceration and over-victim-\nization of Aboriginal people also have links to a system that subjected Aboriginal children\nto punitive discipline and exposed them to physical and sexual abuse. 102 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nThe history of residential schools presented in this report commenced by placing the\nschools in the broader history of the global European colonization of Indigenous peoples\nand their lands. Residential schooling was only a part of the colonization of Aboriginal\npeople. The policy of colonization suppressed Aboriginal culture and languages, disrupted\nAboriginal government, destroyed Aboriginal economies, and confined Aboriginal people\nto marginal and often unproductive land. When that policy resulted in hunger, disease,\nand poverty, the federal government failed to meet its obligations to Aboriginal people.\nThat policy was dedicated to eliminating Aboriginal peoples as distinct political and cul-\ntural entities and must be described for what it was: a policy of cultural genocide.\nDespite being subjected to aggressive assimilation policies for nearly 200 years,\nAboriginal people have maintained their identity and their communities. They continue\nto assert their rights to self-governance. In this, they are not alone. Like the Settlement\nAgreement in Canada, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\nis a milestone in a global campaign to recognize and respect the rights of Indigenous peo-\nples. It is time to abandon the colonial policies of the past, to address the legacy of the\nschools, and to engage in a process of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Canada. The legacy\nT\nhe closing of the schools did not bring the residential school story to an end. Their\nlegacy continues to this day. It is reflected in the significant disparities in education,\nincome, and health between Aboriginal people and other Canadians\u2014disparities\nthat condemn many Aboriginal people to shorter, poorer, and more troubled lives. The leg-\nacy is also reflected in the intense racism and the systemic discrimination Aboriginal peo-\nple regularly experience in this country. More than a century of cultural genocide has left\nmost Aboriginal languages on the verge of extinction. The disproportionate apprehension\nof Aboriginal children by child-welfare agencies and the disproportionate imprisonment\nand victimization of Aboriginal people are all part of the legacy of the way that Aboriginal\nchildren were treated in residential schools.\nMany students were permanently damaged by residential schools. Separated from their\nparents, they grew up knowing neither respect nor affection. A school system that mocked\nand suppressed their families\u2019 cultures and traditions destroyed their sense of self-worth\nand attachment to their own families. Poorly trained teachers working with an irrelevant\ncurriculum left them feeling branded as failures. Children who had been bullied and phys-\nically or sexually abused carried a burden of shame and anger for the rest of their lives.\nOverwhelmed by this legacy, many succumbed to despair and depression. Countless lives\nwere lost to alcohol and drugs.1 Families were destroyed, and generations of children have\nbeen lost to child welfare.\nThe Survivors are not the only ones whose lives have been disrupted and scarred by the\nresidential schools The legacy has also profoundly affected the Survivors\u2019 partners, their\nchildren, their grandchildren, their extended families, and their communities. Children\nwho were abused in the schools sometimes went on to abuse others. Some students devel-\noped addictions as a means of coping. Students who were treated and punished as prison-\ners in the schools sometimes graduated to real prisons.\nThe Commission recognizes that these impacts cannot be attributed solely to resi-\ndential schooling. But they are clearly attributable to the Aboriginal policies of the fed-\neral government over the last 150 years. Residential schooling, which sought to remake\neach new generation of Aboriginal children, was both central to, and emblematic of, those 104 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\npolicies. The beliefs and attitudes that were used to justify the establishment of residen-\ntial schools are not things of the past: they continue to animate official Aboriginal policy\ntoday. Reconciliation will require more than apologies for the shortcomings of those who\npreceded us. It obliges us to recognize the ways in which the legacy of residential schools\ncontinues to disfigure Canadian life and to abandon policies and approaches that cur-\nrently serve to extend that hurtful legacy.\nChild welfare\nThe federal government and the churches believed that Aboriginal parenting, language,\nand culture were harmful to Aboriginal children. Consequently, a central objective of the\nresidential schools was to separate Aboriginal children from their parents and communi-\nties, in order to \u2018civilize\u2019 and Christianize them. For generations, children were cut off from\ntheir families. The schools were in many ways more a child-welfare system than an educa-\ntional one. A survey in 1953 suggested that of 10,112 students then in residential schools,\n4,313 were either orphans or from what were described as \u201cbroken homes.\u201d2 From the\n1940s onwards, residential schools increasingly served as orphanages and child-welfare\nfacilities. By 1960, the federal government estimated that 50% of the children in residential\nschools were there for child-welfare reasons. 3\nThe schools were intended to sever the link between Aboriginal children and parents.\nThey did this only too well. Family connections were permanently broken. Children exposed\nto strict and regimented discipline in the schools sometimes found it difficult to become\nloving parents. Genine Paul-Dimitracopoulos\u2019s mother was placed in the Shubenacadie\nresidential school in Nova Scotia at a very early age. She told the Commission that know-\ning this helped her understand \u201chow we grew up because my mom never really showed\nus love when we were kids coming up. She, when I was hurt or cried, she was never there\nto console you or to hug you. If I hurt myself she would never give me a hug and tell me it\nwould be okay. I didn\u2019t understand why.\u201d4 Alma Scott of Winnipeg told the Commission\nthat as \u201ca direct result of those residential schools, I was a dysfunctional mother.\u2026 I spent\nyears of my life stuck in a bottle, in an addiction where I didn\u2019t want to feel any emotions,\nand so I numbed out with drugs and with alcohol\u2026. That\u2019s how I raised my children, that\u2019s\nwhat my children saw, and that\u2019s what I saw.\u201d5\nOld Crow Chief Norma Kassi spoke a powerful truth when she told the trc\u2019s Northern\nNational Event in Inuvik in 2011, \u201cThe doors are closed at the residential schools but the\nfoster homes are still existing and our children are still being taken away.\u201d6 The closing of\nthe residential schools, starting in the 1960s, was accompanied by the commencement\nof what has come to be known as the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d\u2014the wide-scale apprehension of\nAboriginal children by child-welfare authorities. The legacy \u2022 105\nChild-welfare agencies across Canada removed thousands of Aboriginal children from\ntheir families and communities and placed them in non-Aboriginal homes with little\nconsideration of the need to preserve their culture and identity. Children were placed in\nhomes in different parts of the country, in the United States, and even overseas. This prac-\ntice actually extended well beyond the 1960s, until at least the mid- to late 1980s.7 By 1980,\n4.6% of all First Nations children were in care; the comparable figure for the general popu-\nlation was 0.96%.8 There has been little improvement since then: a 2011 Statistics Canada\nstudy found that 14,225 or 3.6% of all First Nations children aged fourteen and under were\nin foster care, compared with 15,345 or 0.3% of non-Aboriginal children.9 The detrimental\neffects of the residential school experience, combined with prejudicial attitudes toward\nAboriginal parenting skills and a tendency to see Aboriginal poverty as a symptom of\nneglect, contributed to these grossly disproportionate rates of child apprehension among\nAboriginal people.\nAs was the case 100 years ago, Aboriginal children are being separated from their fam-\nilies and communities and placed in the care of agencies. Like the schools, Aboriginal\nchild-welfare agencies are underfunded, and placements are often culturally inappropri-\nate and, tragically, simply unsafe. The child-welfare system is the residential school system\nof our day.\nEducation\nThe residential school system failed as an educational system. Those who administered\nthe system and many of its teachers assumed that Aboriginal children were unfit for any-\nthing more than a rudimentary elementary or vocational education. The staff handbook\nfor the Presbyterian school in Kenora in the 1940s, for example, concluded that upon leav-\ning the school, most students would \u201creturn to the Indian Reserves from which they had\ncome.\u201d Only \u201ca very small proportion of our total enrolment\u201d was expected to go on to\nhigh school. Given this future, staff members were advised that \u201cthe best preparation we\ncan give them is to teach them the Christian way of life.\u201d10 The focus on elementary-level\nschooling and religious training amounted to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most students\nleft residential schools unprepared either to succeed in the market economy or to pursue\nmore traditional activities such as hunting and fishing.\nOne of the most far-reaching and devastating legacies of residential schools has been\ntheir impact on the educational and economic success of Aboriginal people. The lack of\nrole models and mentors, insufficient funds for the schools, inadequate teachers, and\nunsuitable curricula taught in a foreign language contributed to dismal success rates. The\nCommission has heard many examples of students who attended residential school for\neight or more years, but who left with nothing more than Grade Three achievement, and 106 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nsometimes without even the ability to read. According to Indian Affairs annual reports,\ninto the early 1960s, only half of each year\u2019s enrolment got to Grade Six.11\nPoor educational achievement has led to the chronic unemployment or underemploy-\nment, poverty, poor housing, substance abuse, family violence, and ill health that many\nformer students of the schools have suffered as adults.\nGovernmental failure to meet the educational needs of Aboriginal children continues\nto the present day. Government funding is both inadequate and inequitably distributed.\nEducational achievement rates continue to be poor. Although secondary school graduation\nrates for all Aboriginal people have improved since the closure of the schools, consider-\nable differences remain in comparison with the non-Aboriginal population. For example,\naccording to the 2011 census, 29% of working-age Aboriginal people had not graduated\nfrom high school, compared with only 12% of their non-Aboriginal counterparts.12\nLower educational attainment for the children of Survivors has severely limited their\nemployment and earning potential, just as it did for their parents. Aboriginal people have\nlower median after-tax income, are more likely to experience unemployment, and are\nmore likely to collect employment insurance and social assistance benefits.13 These statis-\ntics are true for all Aboriginal groups. For example, the unemployment rate for those living\non reserves was 60% in 2006.14 In 2009, the M\u00e9tis unemployment rate for persons aged\ntwenty-five to fifty-four was 9.4%, while the non-Aboriginal rate was 7.0%.15 In 2006, the\nInuit unemployment rate was 19%.16\nAboriginal people also have income well below their non-Aboriginal counterparts. The\nmedian income for Aboriginal people in 2006 was 30% lower than the median income for\nnon-Aboriginal workers.17 The gap narrows when Aboriginal people obtain a university\ndegree\u2014which they do at a far lower rate.18 The rate of poverty for Aboriginal children\nis also very high\u201440%, compared with 17% for all children in Canada.19 The income gap\nis pervasive: non-Aboriginal Canadians earn more than Aboriginal workers no matter\nwhether they work on reserves or off reserves, or in urban, rural, or remote locations.20\nThe poverty and attendant social problems that plague many Aboriginal communities can\nbe traced back to the inadequacies of the residential schools. Overcoming this legacy will\nrequire an Aboriginal education system that meets the needs of Aboriginal students and\nrespects Aboriginal parents, families, and cultures.\nLanguage and culture\nIn a study of the impact of residential schools, the Assembly of First Nations noted in\n1994 that\nlanguage is necessary to define and maintain a world view. For this reason, some\nFirst Nation elders to this day will say that knowing or learning the native language is\nbasic to any deep understanding of a First Nation way of life, to being a First Nation The legacy \u2022 107\nperson. For them, a First Nation world is quite simply not possible without its own\nlanguage. For them, the impact of residential school silencing their language is\nequivalent to a residential school silencing their world.21\nResidential schools were a systematic, government-sponsored attempt to destroy\nAboriginal cultures and languages and to assimilate Aboriginal peoples so that they no\nlonger existed as distinct peoples. English\u2014and, to a lesser degree, French\u2014were the only\nlanguages of instruction allowed in most residential schools.\nStudents were punished\u2014often severely\u2014for speaking their own languages. Michael\nSillett, a former student at the North West River residential school in Newfoundland and\nLabrador, told the Commission, \u201cChildren at the dorm were not allowed to speak their\nmother tongue. I remember several times when other children were slapped or had their\nmouths washed out for speaking their mother tongue; whether it was Inuktitut or Innu-\naimun. Residents were admonished for just being Native.\u201d22 As late as the 1970s, students\nat schools in northwestern Ontario were not allowed to speak their language if they were in\nthe presence of a staff member who could not understand that language.23 Conrad Burns,\nwhose father attended the Prince Albert school, named this policy for what it was: \u201cIt was\na cultural genocide. People were beaten for their language, people were beaten because ...\nthey followed their own ways.\u201d24\nBy belittling Aboriginal culture, the schools drove a wedge between children and\ntheir parents. Mary Courchene recalled that in the 1940s at the Fort Alexander school in\nManitoba, she was taught that \u201cmy people were no good. This is what we were told every\nday: \u2018You savage. Your ancestors are no good. What did they do when they, your, your, your\npeople, your ancestors you know what they used to do? They used to go and they, they\nwould worship trees and they would, they would worship the animals.\u2019\u201d\nShe became so ashamed of being Aboriginal that when she went home one summer\nand looked at her parents, she concluded that she hated them.\nI just absolutely hated my own parents. Not because I thought they abandoned me; I\nhated their brown faces. I hated them because they were Indians; they were Indian.\nAnd here I was, you know coming from. So I, I looked at my dad and I challenged him\nand he, and I said, \u201cFrom now on we speak only English in this house.\u201d\nHer father\u2019s eyes filled with tears. Then he looked at her mother and said, in Ojibway,\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never speak to this little girl again. Don\u2019t know her.\u201d25 In other cases, on the\nbasis of their residential school experiences, parents decided to speak only English in front\nof their children.26\nThe damage affected future generations, as former students found themselves unable\nor unwilling to teach their own children Aboriginal languages and cultural ways. As a\nresult, many of the almost ninety surviving Aboriginal languages in Canada are under\nserious threat of disappearing. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) states that 70% of Canada\u2019s Aboriginal languages are endangered.27 108 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nIn the 2011 census, 14.5% of the Aboriginal population reported that their first language\nlearned was an Aboriginal language.28 In the previous 2006 census, 18% of those who iden-\ntified as Aboriginal had reported an Aboriginal language as their first language learned,\nand a decade earlier, in the 1996 census, the figure was 26%. There are, however, variations\namong Aboriginal peoples. Nearly two-thirds of Inuit speak their Indigenous language,\ncompared to 22.4% of First Nations people and only 2.5% of M\u00e9tis people.29 If the pres-\nervation of Aboriginal languages does not become a priority for both governments and\nAboriginal communities, then what the residential schools failed to accomplish will come\nabout through a process of systematic neglect.\nHealth\nResidential schools endangered the health and well-being of the children who attended\nthem. Many students succumbed to infectious disease, particularly tuberculosis, at rates\nfar in excess of non-Aboriginal children.30 Children who had been poorly fed and raised in\nthe unsanitary conditions that characterized most residential schools were susceptible to\na myriad of health problems as adults. Many would later succumb to tuberculosis that they\ncontracted in the schools.31\nSexual and physical abuse, as well as separation from families and communities,\ncaused lasting trauma for many other students. Katherine Copenace, who attended the\nRoman Catholic school in Kenora, told the Commission about her struggles: \u201cWhen I got\nolder, I had thoughts of suicide, inflicting pain on myself which I did. I used to slash my\narms, pierce my arms, my body and I destroyed myself with alcohol which the government\nintroduced of course.\u201d32\nIn many cases, former students could find no alternatives to self-destruction.33 The\neffects of this trauma were often passed on to the children of residential school Survivors\nand sometimes to their grandchildren.\nWhen reporting on First Nations health in 1905, Indian Affairs Chief Medical Officer Dr.\nPeter Bryce wrote that \u201cthe death-rate is wholly abnormal, amounting to, on an average,\n34\u201370 per 1,000.\u201d34 One hundred and ten years later, there continue to be troubling gaps in\nhealth outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. For example:\n\u2022 The infant mortality rates for First Nations and Inuit children range from 1.7 to over 4\ntimes the non-Aboriginal rate.35\n\u2022 From 2004 to 2008, the \u201cage-specific mortality rate\u201d at ages one to nineteen in the\nInuit homelands was 188.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years at risk, compared with\nonly 35.3 deaths per 100,000 in the rest of Canada.36\n\u2022 First Nations people aged forty-five and over have nearly twice the rate of diabetes as\ncompared with the non-Aboriginal population.37 The legacy \u2022 109\n\u2022 First Nations people were six times more likely than the general population to suffer\nalcohol-related deaths, and more than three times more likely to suffer drug-induced\ndeaths.38\nThe overall suicide rate among First Nation communities is about twice that of the total\nCanadian population. For Inuit, the rate is still higher: six to eleven times the rate for the\ngeneral population. Aboriginal youth between the ages of ten and twenty-nine who are\nliving on reserves are five to six times more likely to die by suicide than non-Aboriginal\nyouth.39\nHealth disparities of such magnitude have social roots. They are stark evidence of fed-\neral policies that separated Aboriginal people from their traditional lands and livelihoods,\nconfining them to cramped and inadequate housing on reserves that lacked the basic san-\nitary services. It was from these communities that residential schools recruited students,\nand it was to them that the students returned with their health further weakened.\nJustice\nResidential schools inflicted profound injustices on Aboriginal people. Aboriginal par-\nents were forced, often under pressure from the police, to give up their children to the\nschools. Children were taken far from their communities to live in frightening custodial\ninstitutions, which felt like prisons. The children who attended residential schools were\noften treated as if they were offenders, and yet they were the ones at risk of being physically\nand sexually abused.\nThe Canadian legal system failed to provide justice to Survivors who were abused. When,\nin the late 1980s, that system eventually did begin to respond to the abuse, it did so inade-\nquately and in a way that often revictimized the Survivors. The Commission has been able\nto identify fewer than fifty convictions stemming from abuse at residential schools. This is\na small fraction of the more than 38,000 claims of sexual and serious physical abuse that\nwere submitted to the independent adjudication process that was established to assess\nand compensate residential school abuse claims.40\nIn many ways, the residential school experience lies at the root of the over-incarcera-\ntion of Aboriginal people, which continues to this day. For Daniel Andre, the road from\nGrollier Hall in Inuvik in the Northwest Territories led, inevitably, to jail.\nI knew that I needed help to get rid of what happened to me in residential school.\nLike, everywhere I went, everything I did, all the jobs I had, all the towns I lived in, all\nthe people I met, always brought me back to, to being in residential school, and being\nhumiliated, and beaten, and ridiculed, and told I was a piece of garbage, I was not\ngood enough, I was, like, a dog.... So, one of the scariest things for me being in jail is\nbeing humiliated in front of everybody, being made, laughed at, and which they do\noften \u2019cause they\u2019re just, like, that\u2019s just the way they are. And a lot of them are, like, 110 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nsurvival of the fittest. And, like, if you show weakness, they\u2019ll, they\u2019ll just pick on you\neven more and \u2026 I had to, to survive. I had to be strong enough to survive. I had to, I\nhad to build up a system where I became a jerk. I became a bad person. I became an\nasshole. But I survived, and learnt all those things to survive.41\nAndre\u2019s story was far too common. Traumatized by their school experiences, many for-\nmer students succumbed to addictions, and found themselves among the disproportion-\nate number of Aboriginal people who have come into conflict with the law.\nOnce Aboriginal persons are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted, they are more likely\nto be sentenced to prison than non-Aboriginal people. This overrepresentation is growing.\nIn 1995\u201396, Aboriginal people made up 16% of all those sentenced to custody. By 2011\u2013\n12, that number had grown to 28% of all admissions to sentenced custody, even though\nAboriginal people make up only 4% of the Canadian adult population.42 The over-incarcer-\nation of women is even more disproportionate: in 2011\u201312, 43% of admissions of women\nto sentenced custody were Aboriginal.43 Aboriginal girls make up 49% of the youth admit-\nted to custody, and Aboriginal boys are 36% of those admitted to custody.44\nThere is another link between the substance abuse that has plagued many residential\nschool Survivors and the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people. Studies from Canada\nand the United States suggest that 15% to 20% of prisoners have fetal alcohol spectrum\ndisorder (fasd).45 This is a permanent brain injury caused when a woman\u2019s consump-\ntion of alcohol during pregnancy affects her fetus. The disabilities associated with fasd\ninclude memory impairments, problems with judgment and abstract reasoning, and poor\nadaptive functioning.46 A recent Canadian study found that offenders with fasd had much\nhigher rates of criminal involvement than those without fasd, including more juvenile\nand adult convictions.47 Diagnosing fasd can be a long and costly process, and the lack\nof a confirmed diagnosis can result in the unjust imprisonment of Aboriginal people who\nare living with a disability. In this way, the traumas of residential school are quite literally\npassed down from one generation to another.48\nAs well as being more likely to be involved as offenders with the justice system,\nAboriginal people are 58% more likely than non-Aboriginal people to be the victims of\ncrime.49 Aboriginal women report being victimized by violent crime at a rate almost three\ntimes higher than non-Aboriginal women\u201413% of Aboriginal women reported being\nvictimized by violent crime in 2009.50 The most disturbing aspect of this victimization is\nthe extraordinary number of Aboriginal women and girls who have been murdered or are\nreported as missing. A 2014 Royal Canadian Mounted Police report found that between\n1980 and 2012, 1,017 Aboriginal women and girls were killed and 164 were missing. Of\nthese, 225 cases remain unsolved.51\nCanada has acknowledged some aspects of the ongoing legacy and harms of residen-\ntial schools. The Supreme Court has recognized that the legacy of residential schools\nshould be considered when sentencing Aboriginal offenders. Although these have been\nimportant measures, they have not been sufficient to address the grossly disproportionate The legacy \u2022 111\nimprisonment of Aboriginal people, which continues to grow, in part because of a lack\nof adequate funding and support for culturally appropriate alternatives to imprisonment.\nThere has been an increase in Aboriginal child-welfare agencies, but the disproportionate\napprehension of Aboriginal children also continues to grow, in part because of a lack of\nadequate funding for culturally appropriate supports that would allow children to remain\nsafely within their own families.\nMany of the individual and collective harms have not yet been redressed, even after\nthe negotiated out-of-court settlement of the residential school litigation in 2006, and\nCanada\u2019s apology in 2008. In fact, some of the damages done by residential schools to\nAboriginal families, languages, education, and health may be perpetuated and even wors-\nened as a result of current government policies. New policies may be based on a lack of\nunderstanding of Aboriginal people, similar to that which motivated the schools initially.\nFor example, child-welfare and health policies may fail to take into account the impor-\ntance of community in raising children. We must learn from the failure of the schools, to\nensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated in the future.\nUnderstanding and redressing the legacy of residential schools will benefit all\nCanadians. Governments in Canada spend billions of dollars each year in responding to\nthe symptoms of the intergenerational trauma of residential schools. Much of this money\nis spent on crisis interventions related to child welfare, family violence, ill health, and\ncrime. Despite genuine reform efforts, the dramatic overrepresentation of Aboriginal chil-\ndren in foster care, and among the sick, the injured, and the imprisoned, continues to\ngrow. The Commission is convinced that genuine reconciliation will not be possible until\nthe broad legacy of the schools is both understood and addressed.  Reconciliation\nT\no some people, \u201creconciliation\u201d is the re-establishment of a conciliatory state.\nHowever, this is a state that many Aboriginal people assert never has existed\nbetween Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. To others, \u201creconciliation,\u201d in the\ncontext of Indian residential schools, is similar to dealing with a situation of family vio-\nlence. It is about coming to terms with events of the past in a manner that overcomes con-\nflict and establishes a respectful and healthy relationship among people, going forward.\nIt is in the latter context that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has\napproached the question of reconciliation.\nTo the Commission, \u201creconciliation\u201d is about establishing and maintaining a mutually\nrespectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in this country. In\norder for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the\nharm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes, and action to change behaviour.\nWe are not there yet. The relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples\nis not a mutually respectful one. But, we believe we can get there, and we believe we can\nmaintain it. Our ambition is to show how we can do that.\nIn 1996, the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples urged Canadians\nto begin a national process of reconciliation that would have set the country on a bold\nnew path, fundamentally changing the very foundations of Canada\u2019s relationship with\nAboriginal peoples. Much of what the Royal Commission had to say has been ignored by\ngovernment; a majority of its recommendations were never implemented. But the report\nand its findings opened people\u2019s eyes and changed the conversation about the reality for\nAboriginal people in this country.\nIn 2015, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada wraps up its work, the\ncountry has a rare second chance to seize a lost opportunity for reconciliation. We live in\na twenty-first-century global world. At stake is Canada\u2019s place as a prosperous, just, and\ninclusive democracy within that global world. At the trc\u2019s first National Event in Winnipeg,\nManitoba, in 2010, residential school Survivor Alma Mann Scott said,\nThe healing is happening\u2014the reconciliation.\u2026 I feel that there\u2019s some hope for us\nnot just as Canadians, but for the world, because I know I\u2019m not the only one. I know 114 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthat Anishinaabe people across Canada, First Nations, are not the only ones. My\nbrothers and sisters in New Zealand, Australia, Ireland\u2014there\u2019s different areas of the\nworld where this type of stuff happened.\u2026 I don\u2019t see it happening in a year, but we\ncan start making changes to laws and to education systems \u2026 so that we can move\nforward.1\nReconciliation must support Aboriginal peoples as they heal from the destructive\nlegacies of colonization that have wreaked such havoc in their lives. But it must do even\nmore. Reconciliation must inspire Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples to transform\nCanadian society so that our children and grandchildren can live together in dignity,\npeace, and prosperity on these lands we now share.\nThe urgent need for reconciliation runs deep in Canada. Expanding public dialogue\nand action on reconciliation beyond residential schools will be critical in the coming\nyears. Although some progress has been made, significant barriers to reconciliation\nremain. The relationship between the federal government and Aboriginal peoples is\ndeteriorating. Instead of moving towards reconciliation, there have been divisive con-\nflicts over Aboriginal education, child welfare, and justice. The daily news has been filled\nwith reports of controversial issues ranging from the call for a national inquiry on vio-\nlence towards Aboriginal women and girls to the impact of the economic development\nof lands and resources on Treaties and Aboriginal title and rights.2 The courts continue to\nhear Aboriginal rights cases, and new litigation has been filed by Survivors of day schools\nnot covered under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, as well as by\nvictims of the \u201cSixties Scoop.\u201d3 The promise of reconciliation, which seemed so imminent\nback in 2008 when the prime minister, on behalf of all Canadians, apologized to Survivors,\nhas faded.\nToo many Canadians know little or nothing about the deep historical roots of these con-\nflicts. This lack of historical knowledge has serious consequences for First Nations, Inuit,\nand M\u00e9tis peoples, and for Canada as a whole. In government circles, it makes for poor\npublic policy decisions. In the public realm, it reinforces racist attitudes and fuels civic\ndistrust between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians.4 Too many Canadians still do\nnot know the history of Aboriginal peoples\u2019 contributions to Canada, or understand that\nby virtue of the historical and modern Treaties negotiated by our government, we are all\nTreaty people. History plays an important role in reconciliation; to build for the future,\nCanadians must look to, and learn from, the past.\nAs Commissioners, we understood from the start that although reconciliation could not\nbe achieved during the trc\u2019s lifetime, the country could and must take ongoing positive\nand concrete steps forward. Although the Commission has been a catalyst for deepening\nour national awareness of the meaning and potential of reconciliation, it will take many\nheads, hands, and hearts, working together, at all levels of society to maintain momentum\nin the years ahead. It will also take sustained political will at all levels of government and\nconcerted material resources. Reconciliation \u2022 115\nThe thousands of Survivors who publicly shared their residential school experiences\nat trc events in every region of this country have launched a much-needed dialogue\nabout what is necessary to heal themselves, their families, communities, and the nation.\nCanadians have much to benefit from listening to the voices, experiences, and wisdom of\nSurvivors, Elders, and Traditional Knowledge Keepers\u2014and much more to learn about\nreconciliation. Aboriginal peoples have an important contribution to make to reconcilia-\ntion. Their knowledge systems, oral histories, laws, and connections to the land have vitally\ninformed the reconciliation process to date, and are essential to its ongoing progress.\nAt a Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum sponsored by the trc, Anishinaabe Elder\nMary Deleary spoke about the responsibility for reconciliation that both Aboriginal and\nnon-Aboriginal people carry. She emphasized that the work of reconciliation must con-\ntinue in ways that honour the ancestors, respect the land, and rebalance relationships.\nShe said,\nI\u2019m so filled with belief and hope because when I hear your voices at the table, I hear\nand know that the responsibilities that our ancestors carried ... are still being carried\n... even through all of the struggles, even through all of what has been disrupted ... we\ncan still hear the voice of the land. We can hear the care and love for the children. We\ncan hear about our law. We can hear about our stories, our governance, our feasts,\n[and] our medicines.... We have work to do. That work we are [already] doing as [Ab-\noriginal] peoples. Our relatives who have come from across the water [non-Aborigi-\nnal people], you still have work to do on your road.... The land is made up of the dust\nof our ancestors\u2019 bones. And so to reconcile with this land and everything that has\nhappened, there is much work to be done ... in order to create balance.5\nAt the Victoria Regional Event in 2012, Survivor Archie Little said,\n[For] me reconciliation is righting a wrong. And how do we do that? All these people\nin this room, a lot of non-Aboriginals, a lot of Aboriginals that probably didn\u2019t go to\nresidential school; we need to work together.... My mother had a high standing in our\ncultural ways. We lost that. It was taken away.... And I think it\u2019s time for you non-Ab-\noriginals \u2026 to go to your politicians and tell them that we have to take responsibility\nfor what happened. We have to work together.6\nThe Reverend Stan McKay of the United Church, who is also a Survivor, believes that\nreconciliation can happen only when everyone accepts responsibility for healing in ways\nthat foster respect. He said,\n[There must be] a change in perspective about the way in which Aboriginal peo-\nples would be engaged with Canadian society in the quest for reconciliation.... [We\ncannot] perpetuate the paternalistic concept that only Aboriginal peoples are in need\nof healing.... The perpetrators are wounded and marked by history in ways that are\ndifferent from the victims, but both groups require healing.... How can a conversation\nabout reconciliation take place if all involved do not adopt an attitude of humility and 116 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nrespect? ... We all have stories to tell and in order to grow in tolerance and under-\nstanding we must listen to the stories of others.7\nOver the past five years, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada urged\nCanadians not to wait until its final report was issued before contributing to the reconcili-\nation process. We have been encouraged to see that across the country, many people have\nbeen answering that call.\nThe youth of this country are taking up the challenge of reconciliation. Aboriginal and\nnon-Aboriginal youth who attended trc National Events made powerful statements about\nwhy reconciliation matters to them. At the Alberta National Event in Edmonton in March\n2014, an Indigenous youth spoke on behalf of a national Indigenous and non-Indigenous\ncollaboration known as the \u201c4Rs Youth Movement.\u201d Jessica Bolduc said,\nWe have re-examined our thoughts and beliefs around colonialism, and have made\na commitment to unpack our own baggage, and to enter into a new relationship with\neach other, using this momentum, to move our country forward, in light of the 150th\nanniversary of the Confederation of Canada in 2017.\nAt this point in time, we ask ourselves, \u201cWhat does that anniversary mean for us,\nas Indigenous youth and non-Indigenous youth, and how do we arrive at that day\nwith something we can celebrate together?\u201d\u2026 Our hope is that, one day, we will live\ntogether, as recognized nations, within a country we can all be proud of.8\nIn 2013, at the British Columbia National Event in Vancouver, where over 5,000 ele-\nmentary and secondary school students attended Education Day, several non-Aboriginal\nyouth talked about what they had learned. Matthew Meneses said, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget this\nday. This is the first day they ever told us about residential schools. If I were to see someone\nwho\u2019s Aboriginal, I\u2019d ask them if they can speak their language because I think speaking\ntheir language is a pretty cool thing.\u201d Antonio Jordao said, \u201cIt makes me sad for those kids.\nThey took them away from their homes\u2014it was torture, it\u2019s not fair. They took them away\nfrom their homes. I don\u2019t agree with that. It\u2019s really wrong. That\u2019s one of the worst things\nthat Canada did.\u201d Cassidy Morris said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re finally learning about what\nhappened.\u201d Jacqulyn Byers told us, \u201cI hope that events like this are able to bring closure to\nthe horrible things that happened, and that a whole lot of people now recognize that the\ncrime happened and that we need to make amends for it.\u201d9\nAt the same National Event, trc Honorary Witness Patsy George paid tribute to the\nstrength of Aboriginal women and their contributions to the reconciliation process despite\nthe oppression and violence they have experienced. She said,\nWomen have always been a beacon of hope for me. Mothers and grandmothers in the\nlives of our children, and in the survival of our communities, must be recognized and\nsupported. The justified rage we all feel and share today must be turned into instru-\nments of transformation of our hearts and our souls, clearing the ground for respect,\nlove, honesty, humility, wisdom, and truth. We owe it to all those who suffered, and Reconciliation \u2022 117\nwe owe it to the children of today and tomorrow. May this day and the days ahead\nbring us peace and justice.10\nAboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians from all walks of life spoke to us about the\nimportance of reaching out to one another in ways that create hope for a better future.\nWhether one is First Nations, Inuit, M\u00e9tis, a descendant of European settlers, a member of\na minority group that suffered historical discrimination in Canada, or a new Canadian, we\nall inherit both the benefits and obligations of Canada. We are all Treaty people who share\nresponsibility for taking action on reconciliation.\nWithout truth, justice, and healing, there can be no genuine reconciliation.\nReconciliation is not about \u201cclosing a sad chapter of Canada\u2019s past,\u201d but about opening\nnew healing pathways of reconciliation that are forged in truth and justice. We are mindful\nthat knowing the truth about what happened in residential schools in and of itself does\nnot necessarily lead to reconciliation. Yet, the importance of truth telling in its own right\nshould not be underestimated; it restores the human dignity of victims of violence and\ncalls governments and citizens to account. Without truth, justice is not served, healing\ncannot happen, and there can be no genuine reconciliation between Aboriginal and\nnon-Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Speaking to us at the Traditional Knowledge Keepers\nForum in June of 2014, Elder Dave Courchene posed a critical question: \u201cWhen you talk\nabout truth, whose truth are you talking about?\u201d11\nThe Commission\u2019s answer to Elder Courchene\u2019s question is that by truth, we mean not\nonly the truth revealed in government and church residential school documents, but also\nthe truth of lived experiences as told to us by Survivors and others in their statements to\nthis Commission. Together, these public testimonies constitute a new oral history record,\none based on Indigenous legal traditions and the practice of witnessing.12 As people gath-\nered at various trc National Events and Community Hearings, they shared experiences of\ntruth telling and offered expressions of reconciliation.\nOver the course of its work, the Commission inducted a growing circle of trc Honorary\nWitnesses. Their role has been to bear official witness to the testimonies of Survivors and\ntheir families, former school staff and their descendants, government and church officials,\nand any others whose lives have been affected by the residential schools. Beyond the work\nof the trc, the Honorary Witnesses have pledged their commitment to the ongoing work\nof reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. We also encouraged\neveryone who attended trc National Events or Community Hearings to see themselves\nas witnesses, with an obligation to find ways of making reconciliation a concrete reality in\ntheir own lives, communities, schools, and workplaces.\nAs Elder Jim Dumont explained at the Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum in\nJune 2014, \u201cin Ojibwe thinking, to speak the truth is to actually speak from the heart.\u201d13\nAt the Community Hearing in Key First Nation, Saskatchewan, in 2012, Survivor Wilfred\nWhitehawk told us he was glad that he disclosed his abuse. 118 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nI don\u2019t regret it because it taught me something. It taught me to talk about truth,\nabout me, to be honest about who I am.... I am very proud of who I am today. It took\nme a long time, but I\u2019m there. And what I have, my values and belief systems are\nmine and no one is going to impose theirs on me. And no one today is going to take\nadvantage of me, man or woman, the government or the rcmp, because I have a voice\ntoday. I can speak for me and no one can take that away.14\nSurvivor and the child of Survivors Vitaline Elsie Jenner said, \u201cI\u2019m quite happy to be\nable to share my story.... I want the people of Canada to hear, to listen, for it is the truth.... I\nalso want my grandchildren to learn, to learn from me that, yes, it did happen.\u201d15\nAnother descendant of Survivors, Daniel Elliot, told the Commission,\nI think all Canadians need to stop and take a look and not look away. Yeah, it\u2019s em-\nbarrassing, yeah, it\u2019s an ugly part of our history. We don\u2019t want to know about it. What\nI want to see from the Commission is to rewrite the history books so that other gen-\nerations will understand and not go through the same thing that we\u2019re going through\nnow, like it never happened.16\nPresident of the M\u00e9tis National Council Clement Chartier spoke to the Commission\nabout the importance of truth to justice and reconciliation. At the Saskatchewan National\nEvent, he said,\nThe truth is important. So I\u2019ll try to address the truth and a bit of reconciliation as\nwell. The truth is that the M\u00e9tis Nation, represented by the M\u00e9tis National Council, is\nnot a party to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.... And the truth\nis that the exclusion of the M\u00e9tis Nation or the M\u00e9tis as a people is reflected through-\nout this whole period not only in the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agree-\nment but in the apology made by Canada as well....\nWe are, however, the products ... of the same assimilationist policy that the federal\ngovernment foisted upon the Treaty Indian kids. So there ought to be some solu-\ntion.... The M\u00e9tis boarding schools, residential schools, are excluded. And we need to\nensure that everyone was aware of that and hopefully some point down the road, you\nwill help advocate and get, you know, the governments or whoever is responsible to\naccept responsibility and to move forward on a path to reconciliation, because recon-\nciliation should be for all Aboriginal peoples and not only some Aboriginal peoples.17\nAt the British Columbia National Event, the former lieutenant-governor of British\nColumbia, the Honourable Steven Point, said,\nAnd so many of you have said today, so many of the witnesses that came forward\nsaid, \u201cI cannot forgive. I\u2019m not ready to forgive.\u201d And I wondered why. Reconciliation\nis about hearing the truth, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s also about acknowledging that truth. Ac-\nknowledging that what you\u2019ve said is true. Accepting responsibility for your pain and\nputting those children back in the place they would have been, had they not been\ntaken from their homes.\u2026 Reconciliation \u2022 119\nWhat are the blockages to reconciliation? The continuing poverty in our communi-\nties and the failure of our government to recognize that, \u201cYes, we own the land.\u201d Stop\nthe destruction of our territories and for God\u2019s sake, stop the deaths of so many of\nour women on highways across this country.\u2026 I\u2019m going to continue to talk about\nreconciliation, but just as important, I\u2019m going to foster healing in our own people, so\nthat our children can avoid this pain, can avoid this destruction and finally take our\nrightful place in this \u201cOur Canada.\u201d18\nWhen former residential school staff attended public trc events, some thought it was\nmost important to hear directly from Survivors, even if their own perspectives and mem-\nories of the schools might differ from those of the Survivors. At a Community Hearing in\nThunder Bay, Ontario, Merle Nisley, who worked at the Poplar Hill residential school in\nthe early 1970s, said,\nI think it would be valuable for people who have been involved in the schools to hear\nstories personally. And I also think it would be valuable, when it\u2019s appropriate ... [for]\nformer students who are on the healing path to ... hear some of our stories, or to hear\nsome of our perspectives. But I know that\u2019s a very difficult thing to do.... Certainly this\nis not the time to try to ask all those former students to sit and listen to the rationale\nof the former staff because there\u2019s just too much emotion there ... and there\u2019s too little\ntrust ... you can\u2019t do things like that when there\u2019s low levels of trust. So I think really\na very important thing is for former staff to hear the stories and to be courageous\nenough just to hear them.... Where wrongs were done, where abuses happened,\nwhere punishment was over the top, and wherever sexual abuse happened, some-\nhow we need to courageously sit and talk about that, and apologize. I don\u2019t know\nhow that will happen.19\nNisley\u2019s reflections highlight one of the difficulties the Commission faced in trying to\ncreate a space for respectful dialogue between former residential school students and\nstaff. While, in most cases, this was possible, in other instances, Survivors and their family\nmembers found it very difficult to listen to former staff, particularly if they perceived the\nspeaker to be an apologist for the schools.\nAt the trc Victoria Regional Event, Brother Tom Cavanaugh, the district superior of the\nOblates of Mary Immaculate for British Columbia and the Yukon, spoke about his time as\na supervisor at the Christie residential school.\nWhat I experienced over the six years I was at Christie residential school was a staff,\nNative and non-Native alike, working together to provide as much as possible, a\nsafe loving environment for the children attending Christie school. Was it a perfect\nsituation? No, it wasn\u2019t a perfect situation ... but again, there didn\u2019t seem to be, at that\ntime, any other viable alternative in providing a good education for so many children\nwho lived in relatively small and isolated communities.\nSurvivors and family members who were present in the audience spoke out, saying,\n\u201cTruth, tell the truth.\u201d Brother Cavanaugh replied, \u201cIf you give me a chance, I will tell you 120 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nthe truth.\u201d When trc Chair Justice Murray Sinclair intervened to ask the audience to allow\nBrother Cavanaugh to finish his statement, he was able to do so without further interrup-\ntion. Visibly shaken, Cavanaugh then went on to acknowledge that children had also been\nabused in the schools, and he condemned such actions, expressing his sorrow and regret\nfor this breach of trust.\nI can honestly say that our men are hurting too because of the abuse scandal and\nthe rift that this has created between First Nations and church representatives. Many\nof our men who are still working with First Nations have attended various truth\nand reconciliation sessions as well as Returning to Spirit sessions, hoping to bring\nabout healing for all concerned. The Oblates desire healing for the abused and for all\ntouched by the past breach of trust. It is our hope that together we can continue to\nbuild a better society.20\nLater that same day, Ina Seitcher, who attended the Christie residential school, painted\na very different picture of the school from what Brother Cavanaugh had described.\nI went to Christie residential school. This morning I heard a priest talking about his\nChristie residential school. I want to tell him [about] my Christie residential school. I\nwent there for ten months. Ten months that impacted my life for fifty years. I am just\nnow on my healing journey.... I need to do this, I need to speak out. I need to speak\nfor my mom and dad who went to residential school, for my aunts, my uncles, all that\nare beyond now.... All the pain of our people, the hurt, the anger.\u2026 That priest that\ntalked about how loving that Christie residential school was\u2014it was not. That priest\nwas most likely in his office not knowing what was going on down in the dorms or in\nthe lunchroom.... There were things that happened at Christie residential school, and\nlike I said, I\u2019m just starting my healing journey. There are doors that I don\u2019t even want\nto open. I don\u2019t even want to open those doors because I don\u2019t know what it would\ndo to me.21\nThese two, seemingly irreconcilable, truths are a stark reminder that there are no easy\nshortcuts to reconciliation. The fact that there were few direct exchanges at trc events\nbetween Survivors and former school staff indicates that for many, the time for reconcili-\nation had not yet arrived. Indeed, for some, it may never arrive. At the Manitoba National\nEvent in 2010, Survivor Evelyn Brockwood talked about why it is important to ensure that\nthere is adequate time for healing to occur in the truth and reconciliation process. She said,\nWhen this came out at the beginning, I believe it was 1990, about residential schools,\npeople coming out with their stories, and ... I thought the term, the words they were\nusing, were truth, healing and reconciliation. But somehow it seems like we are going\nfrom truth telling to reconciliation, to reconcile with our white brothers and sisters.\nMy brothers and sisters, we have a lot of work to do in the middle. We should really\nlift up the word healing.... Go slow, we are going too fast, too fast.... We have many\ntears to shed before we even get to the word reconciliation.22 Reconciliation \u2022 121\nTo determine the truth and to tell the full and complete story of residential schools\nin this country, the trc needed to hear from Survivors and their families, former staff,\ngovernment and church officials, and all those affected by residential schools. Canada\u2019s\nnational history in the future must be based on the truth about what happened in the res-\nidential schools. One hundred years from now, our children\u2019s children and their children\nmust know and still remember this history, because they will inherit from us the responsi-\nbility of ensuring that it never happens again.\nWhat is reconciliation?\nDuring the course of the Commission\u2019s work, it has become clear that the concept of\nreconciliation means different things to different people, communities, institutions, and\norganizations. The trc mandate describes \u201creconciliation\u201d as\nan ongoing individual and collective process, and will require commitment from\nall those affected including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis former Indian Residential\nSchool (irs) students, their families, communities, religious entities, former school\nemployees, government and the people of Canada. Reconciliation may occur be-\ntween any of the above groups.23\nThe Commission defines \u201creconciliation\u201d as an ongoing process of establishing and\nmaintaining respectful relationships. A critical part of this process involves repairing dam-\naged trust by making apologies, providing individual and collective reparations, and fol-\nlowing through with concrete actions that demonstrate real societal change. Establishing\nrespectful relationships also requires the revitalization of Indigenous law and legal tradi-\ntions. It is important that all Canadians understand how traditional First Nations, Inuit,\nand M\u00e9tis approaches to resolving conflict, repairing harm, and restoring relationships\ncan inform the reconciliation process.\nTraditional Knowledge Keepers and Elders have long dealt with conflicts and harms\nusing spiritual ceremonies and peacemaking practices, and by retelling oral history sto-\nries that reveal how their ancestors restored harmony to families and communities. These\ntraditions and practices are the foundation of Indigenous law; they contain wisdom and\npractical guidance for moving towards reconciliation across this land.24\nAs First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis communities access and revitalize their spirituality,\ncultures, languages, laws, and governance systems, and as non-Aboriginal Canadians\nincreasingly come to understand Indigenous history within Canada, and to recognize and\nrespect Indigenous approaches to establishing and maintaining respectful relationships,\nCanadians can work together to forge a new covenant of reconciliation.\nDespite the ravages of colonialism, every Indigenous nation across the country, each\nwith its own distinctive culture and language, has kept its legal traditions and peacemaking\npractices alive in its communities. Although Elders and Knowledge Keepers across the land 122 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nhave told us that there is no specific word for \u201creconciliation\u201d in their own languages, there\nare many words, stories, and songs, as well as sacred objects such as wampum belts, peace\npipes, eagle down, cedar boughs, drums, and regalia, that are used to establish relation-\nships, repair conflicts, restore harmony, and make peace. The ceremonies and protocols\nof Indigenous law are still remembered and practised in many Aboriginal communities.\nAt the trc Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum in June 2014, trc Survivor Committee\nmember and Elder Barney Williams told us that\nfrom sea to sea, we hear words that allude to \u2026 what is reconciliation? What does\nhealing or forgiveness mean? And how there\u2019s parallels to all those words that the\nCreator gave to all the nations.\u2026 When I listen and reflect on the voices of the ances-\ntors, your ancestors, I hear my ancestor alluding to the same thing with a different\ndialect.\u2026 My understanding [of reconciliation] comes from a place and time when\nthere was no English spoken \u2026 from my grandmother who was born in the 1800s.\u2026\nI really feel privileged to have been chosen by my grandmother to be the keeper of\nour knowledge.\u2026 What do we need to do? ... We need to go back to ceremony and\nembrace ceremony as part of moving forward. We need to understand the laws of our\npeople.25\nAt the same Forum, Elder Stephen Augustine explained the roles of silence and negoti-\nation in Mi\u2019kmaq law. He said \u201csilence\u201d is a concept, and can be used as a consequence for\na wrong action or to teach a lesson. Silence is employed according to proper procedures,\nand ends at a particular time too. Elder Augustine suggested that there is both a place for\ntalking about reconciliation and a need for quiet reflection. Reconciliation cannot occur\nwithout listening, contemplation, meditation, and deeper internal deliberation. Silence in\nthe face of residential school harms is an appropriate response for many Indigenous peo-\nples. We must enlarge the space for respectful silence in journeying towards reconciliation,\nparticularly for Survivors who regard this as key to healing. There is also a place for discus-\nsion and negotiation for those who want to move beyond silence. Dialogue and mutual\nadjustment are significant components of Mi\u2019kmaq law. Elder Augustine suggested that\nother dimensions of human experience\u2014our relationships with the earth and all living\nbeings\u2014are also relevant in working towards reconciliation. This profound insight is an\nIndigenous law that could be applied more generally.26\nElder Reg Crowshoe told the Commission that Indigenous peoples\u2019 worldviews, oral\nhistory traditions, and practices have much to teach us about how to establish respectful\nrelationships among peoples and with the land and all living things. Learning how to live\ntogether in a good way happens through sharing stories and practising reconciliation in\nour everyday lives.\nWhen we talk about the concept of reconciliation, I think about some of the stories\nthat I\u2019ve heard in our culture and stories are important.... These stories are so import-\nant as theories but at the same time stories are important to oral cultures. So when\nwe talk about stories, we talk about defining our environment and how we look at Reconciliation \u2022 123\nauthorities that come from the land and how that land, when we talk about our rela-\ntionship with the land, how we look at forgiveness and reconciliation is so important\nwhen we look at it historically.\nWe have stories in our culture about our superheroes, how we treat each other,\nstories about how animals and plants give us authorities and privileges to use plants\nas healing, but we also have stories about practices. How would we practise reconcil-\niation? How would we practise getting together to talk about reconciliation in an oral\nperspective? And those practices are so important.27\nAs Elder Crowshoe explained further, reconciliation requires talking, but our conver-\nsations must be broader than Canada\u2019s conventional approaches. Reconciliation between\nAboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, from an Aboriginal perspective, also requires\nreconciliation with the natural world. If human beings resolve problems between them-\nselves but continue to destroy the natural world, then reconciliation remains incomplete.\nThis is a perspective that we as Commissioners have repeatedly heard: that reconcilia-\ntion will never occur unless we are also reconciled with the earth. Mi\u2019kmaq and other\nIndigenous laws stress that humans must journey through life in conversation and nego-\ntiation with all creation. Reciprocity and mutual respect help sustain our survival. It is\nthis kind of healing and survival that is needed in moving forward from the residential\nschool experience.\nOver the course of its work, the Commission created space for exploring the mean-\nings and concepts of reconciliation. In public Sharing Circles at National Events and\nCommunity Hearings, we bore witness to powerful moments of truth sharing and hum-\nbling acts of reconciliation. Many Survivors had never been able to tell their own fam-\nilies the whole truth of what happened to them in the schools. At hearings in Regina,\nSaskatchewan, Elder Kirby Littletent said, \u201cI never told, I just told my children, my grand-\nchildren I went to boarding school, that\u2019s all. I never shared my experiences.\u201d28\nMany spoke to honour the memory of relatives who have passed on. Simone, an Inuk\nSurvivor from Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut, said,\nI\u2019m here for my parents\u2014\u2018Did you miss me when I went away?\u2019 \u2018Did you cry for\nme?\u2019\u2014and I\u2019m here for my brother, who was a victim, and my niece at the age of five\nwho suffered a head injury and never came home, and her parents never had closure.\nTo this day, they have not found the grave in Winnipeg. And I\u2019m here for them first,\nand that\u2019s why I\u2019m making a public statement.29\nOthers talked about the importance of reconciling with family members, and cau-\ntioned that this process is just beginning. Patrick Etherington, a Survivor from St. Anne\u2019s\nresidential school in Fort Albany, Ontario, walked with his son and others from Cochrane,\nOntario, to the National Event in Winnipeg. He said that the walk helped him to reconnect\nwith his son, and that he \u201cjust wanted to be here because I feel this process that we are\nstarting, we got a long ways to go.\u201d30 124 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nWe saw the children and grandchildren of Survivors who, in searching for their own\nidentity and place in the world, found compassion and gained new respect for their rel-\natives who went to the schools, once they heard about and began to understand their\nexperiences. At the Northern National Event in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Maxine\nLacorne said,\nAs a youth, a young lady, I talk with people my age because I have a good under-\nstanding. I talk to people who are residential school Survivors because I like to hear\ntheir stories, you know, and it gives me more understanding of my parents.\u2026 It is an\nhonour to be here, to sit here among you guys, Survivors. Wow. You guys are strong\npeople, you guys survived everything. And we\u2019re still going to be here. They tried to\ntake us away. They tried to take our language away. You guys are still here, we\u2019re still\nhere. I\u2019m still here.31\nWe heard about children whose small acts of everyday resistance in the face of rampant\nabuse, neglect, and bullying in the schools were quite simply heroic. At the trc British\nColumbia National Event, Elder Barney Williams said that \u201cmany of us, through our pain\nand suffering, managed to hold our heads up \u2026 we were brave children.\u201d32 We saw old\nbonds of childhood friendship renewed as people gathered and found each other at\ntrc-sponsored events. Together, they remembered the horrors they had endured even as\nthey recalled with pride long-forgotten accomplishments in various school sports teams,\nmusic, or art activities. We heard from resilient, courageous Survivors who, despite their\ntraumatic childhood experiences, went on to become influential leaders in their commu-\nnities and in all walks of Canadian life, including politics, government, law, education,\nmedicine, the corporate world, and the arts.\nWe heard from officials representing the federal government that administered the\nschools. In a Sharing Circle at the Manitoba National Event, the Honourable Chuck Strahl\n(then minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada) said,\nGovernments like to write ... policy, and they like to write legislation, and they like to\ncodify things and so on. And Aboriginal people want to talk about restoration, recon-\nciliation, forgiveness, about healing ... about truth. And those things are all things of\nthe heart and of relationship, and not of government policy. Governments do a bad\njob of that.33\nChurch representatives spoke about their struggles to right the relationship with\nAboriginal peoples. In Inuvik, Anglican Archbishop Fred Hiltz told us that\nas a church, we are renewing our commitment to work with the Assembly of First\nNations in addressing long-standing, Indigenous justice issues. As a church, we are\nrequiring anyone who serves the church at a national level to go through anti-racism\ntraining.... We have a lot to do in our church to make sure that racism is eliminated.34\nEducators told us about their growing awareness of the inadequate role that post-sec-\nondary institutions played in training the teachers who taught in the schools. They Reconciliation \u2022 125\nhave pledged to change educational practices and curriculum to be more inclusive of\nAboriginal knowledge and history. Artists shared their ideas and feelings about truth and\nreconciliation through songs, paintings, dance, film, and other media. Corporations pro-\nvided resources to bring Survivors to events, and, in some cases, some of their own staff\nand managers.\nFor non-Aboriginal Canadians who came to bear witness to Survivors\u2019 life stories, the\nexperience was powerful. One woman said simply, \u201cBy listening to your story, my story\ncan change. By listening to your story, I can change.\u201d35\nReconciliation as relationship\nIn its 2012 Interim Report, the trc recommended that federal, provincial, and terri-\ntorial governments, and all parties to the Settlement Agreement, undertake to meet and\nexplore the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as a framework\nfor reconciliation in Canada. We remain convinced that the United Nations Declaration\nprovides the necessary principles, norms, and standards for reconciliation to flourish in\ntwenty-first-century Canada.\nA reconciliation framework is one in which Canada\u2019s political and legal systems, educa-\ntional and religious institutions, the corporate sector and civil society function in ways that\nare consistent with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,\nwhich Canada has endorsed. The Commission believes that the following guiding princi-\nples of truth and reconciliation will assist Canadians moving forward:\n1) The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is the frame-\nwork for reconciliation at all levels and across all sectors of Canadian society.\n2) First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples, as the original peoples of this country and\nas self-determining peoples, have Treaty, constitutional, and human rights that\nmust be recognized and respected.\n3) Reconciliation is a process of healing of relationships that requires public truth\nsharing, apology, and commemoration that acknowledge and redress past harms.\n4) Reconciliation requires constructive action on addressing the ongoing legacies of\ncolonialism that have had destructive impacts on Aboriginal peoples\u2019 education,\ncultures and languages, health, child welfare, the administration of justice, and\neconomic opportunities and prosperity.\n5) Reconciliation must create a more equitable and inclusive society by closing the\ngaps in social, health, and economic outcomes that exist between Aboriginal and\nnon-Aboriginal Canadians. 126 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\n6) All Canadians, as Treaty peoples, share responsibility for establishing and main-\ntaining mutually respectful relationships.\n7) The perspectives and understandings of Aboriginal Elders and Traditional\nKnowledge Keepers of the ethics, concepts, and practices of reconciliation are vital\nto long-term reconciliation.\n8) Supporting Aboriginal peoples\u2019 cultural revitalization and integrating Indigenous\nknowledge systems, oral histories, laws, protocols, and connections to the land into\nthe reconciliation process are essential.\n9) Reconciliation requires political will, joint leadership, trust building, accountabil-\nity, and transparency, as well as a substantial investment of resources.\n10) Reconciliation requires sustained public education and dialogue, including youth\nengagement, about the history and legacy of residential schools, Treaties, and\nAboriginal rights, as well as the historical and contemporary contributions of\nAboriginal peoples to Canadian society.\nTogether, Canadians must do more than just talk about reconciliation; we must learn\nhow to practise reconciliation in our everyday lives\u2014within ourselves and our families,\nand in our communities, governments, places of worship, schools, and workplaces. To do\nso constructively, Canadians must remain committed to the ongoing work of establishing\nand maintaining respectful relationships.\nFor many Survivors and their families, this commitment is foremost about healing\nthemselves, their communities, and nations, in ways that revitalize individuals as well\nas Indigenous cultures, languages, spirituality, laws, and governance systems. For gov-\nernments, building a respectful relationship involves dismantling a centuries-old politi-\ncal and bureaucratic culture in which, all too often, policies and programs are still based\non failed notions of assimilation. For churches, demonstrating long-term commitment\nrequires atoning for actions within the residential schools, respecting Indigenous spiri-\ntuality, and supporting Indigenous peoples\u2019 struggles for justice and equity. Schools must\nteach history in ways that foster mutual respect, empathy, and engagement. All Canadian\nchildren and youth deserve to know Canada\u2019s honest history, including what happened\nin the residential schools, and to appreciate the rich history and knowledge of Indigenous\nnations who continue to make such a strong contribution to Canada, including our very\nname and collective identity as a country. For Canadians from all walks of life, reconcilia-\ntion offers a new way of living together. Bibliography\nPrimary Sources\n1. Truth and Reconciliation Commission Databases\nThe endnotes of this report often commence with the abbreviation trc, followed by one of the follow-\ning abbreviations: asagr, avs, car, irssa, nra, rbs, and lac. The documents so cited are located in\nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada\u2019s database. At the end of each of these endnotes,\nin square brackets, is the document identification number for each of these documents. The following\nis a brief description of each database.\nActive and Semi-Active Government Records (asagr) Database: The Active and Semi-Active\nGovernment Records database contains active and semi-active records collected from federal gov-\nernmental departments that potentially intersected with the administration and management of the\nresidential school system. Documents that were relevant to the history and/or legacy of the system\nwere disclosed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (trc) in keeping with the\nfederal government\u2019s obligations in relation to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement\n(irssa). Some of the other federal government departments included, but were not limited to, the\nDepartment of Justice, Health Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and National Defence.\nAboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada undertook the responsibility of centrally col-\nlecting and producing the records from these other federal departments to the trc.\nAudio/Video Statement (avs) Database: The Audio/Video Statement database contains video and\naudio statements provided to the trc at community hearings and regional and national events held\nby the trc, as well as at other special events attended by the trc.\nChurch Archival Records (car) Database: The Church Archival Records database contains records\ncollected from the different church/religious entities that were involved in administration and\nmanagement of residential schools. The church/religious entities primarily included, but were not\nlimited to, entities associated with the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church of Canada, the\nPresbyterian Church in Canada, and the United Church of Canada. The records were collected as part\nof the trc\u2019s mandate, as set out in the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, to \u201cidentify\nsources and create as complete an historical record as possible of the irs system and legacy.\u201d 128 \u2022 Truth & Reconciliation Commission\nIndian Residential Schools School Authority (irssa) Database: The Indian Residential Schools\nSchool Authority database is comprised of individual records related to each residential school, as set\nout by the irssa.\nNational Research and Analysis (nra) Database: The National Research and Analysis database\ncontains records collected by the National Research and Analysis Directorate, Aboriginal Affairs and\nNorthern Development Canada, formerly Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada (irsrc). The\nrecords in the database were originally collected for the purpose of research into a variety of allega-\ntions, such as abuse in residential schools, and primarily resulted from court processes such as civil\nand criminal litigation, and later the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (irssa), as\nwell as from out-of-court processes such as Alternative Dispute Resolution. A majority of the records\nwere collected from Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. The collection also\ncontains records from other federal departments and religious entities. In the case of some records in\nthe database that were provided by outside entities, the information in the database is incomplete. In\nthose instances, the endnote in the report reads, \u201cNo document location, no document file source.\u201d\nRed, Black and School Series (rbs) Database: The Red, Black and School Series database contains\nrecords provided by Library and Archives Canada to the trc. These three sub-series contain records\nthat were originally part of the \u201cHeadquarters Central Registry System,\u201d or records management\nsystem, for departments that preceded the current federal department of Aboriginal Affairs and\nNorthern Development Canada. The archival records are currently related to the Department of In-\ndian Affairs and Northern Development fonds and are held as part of Library and Archives Canada\u2019s\ncollection.\nLibrary and Archives Canada Archival Records Container (lacar) and Document Databases \u2013\nThe lacar Records Container and Document databases contain records collected from Library and\nArchives Canada (lac). The archival records of federal governmental departments that potentially\nintersected with the administration and management of Indian Residential Schools were held as\npart of Library and Archives Canada\u2019s collection. Documents that were relevant to the history and/or\nlegacy of the Indian Residential School system were initially collected by the Truth and Reconcilia-\ntion Commission, in conjunction with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, as part\nof their mandate, as set out in the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. The collection of\nrecords was later continued by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, based on the\nfederal government\u2019s obligation to disclose documents in relation to the Indian Residential Schools\nSettlement Agreement.\n2. Indian Affairs Annual Reports, 1864\u20131997\nWithin this report, Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs denotes the published annual\nreports created by the Government of Canada, and relating to Indian Affairs over the period from\n1864 to 1997.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was created in 1966. In 2011, it was\nrenamed Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. Before 1966, different departments were\nresponsible for the portfolios of Indian Affairs and Northern Affairs. Bibliography \u2022 129\nThe departments responsible for Indian Affairs were (in chronological order):\n\u2022 The Department of the Secretary of State of Canada (to 1869)\n\u2022 The Department of the Secretary of State for the Provinces (1869\u20131873)\n\u2022 The Department of the Interior (1873\u20131880)\n\u2022 The Department of Indian Affairs (1880\u20131936)\n\u2022 The Department of Mines and Resources (1936\u20131950)\n\u2022 The Department of Citizenship and Immigration (1950\u20131965)\n\u2022 The Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1966)\n\u2022 The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (1966 to the present)\nThe exact titles of Indian Affairs annual reports changed over time, and were named for the depart-\nment.\n3. Library and Archives Canada\nRG10 (Indian Affairs Records Group) The records of RG10 at Library and Archives Canada are\ncurrently part of the R216, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development fonds. For clarity\nand brevity, in footnotes throughout this report, records belonging to the RG10 Records Group have\nbeen identified simply with their RG10 information. Where a copy of an RG10 document held in a\nTRC database was used, the TRC database holding that copy is clearly identified, along with the RG10\ninformation connected with the original document.\n4.

The mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is listed under Schedule N\nof the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.\nca/settlement.html (accessed 5 March 2015). In accordance with the TRC\u2019s mandate, the Com-\nmission was required to recognize \u201cthe significance of Aboriginal oral and legal traditions in its\nactivities,\u201d Schedule N, 4(d); and \u201cwitness, support, promote and facilitate truth and reconciliation\nevents at both the national and community levels,\u201d Schedule N, 1(c). The term witness \u201crefers to the\nAboriginal principle of \u2018witnessing,\u2019\u201d Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, Schedule\nN, 1(c), n1.\nAboriginal oral history, legal traditions, and the principle of witnessing have deep historical roots\nand contemporary relevance for reconciliation. Indigenous law was used to resolve family and\ncommunity conflict, to establish Treaties among various Indigenous nations, and to negotiate\nnation-to-nation treaties with the Crown. For a comprehensive history of Aboriginal\u2013Crown Treaty\nmaking from contact to the present, see: Miller, Compact, Contract, Covenant. The term witness\nis in reference to the Aboriginal principle of witnessing, which varies among First Nations, M\u00e9tis,\nand Inuit peoples. Generally speaking, witnesses are called to be the keepers of history when an\nevent of historic significance occurs. Through witnessing, the event or work that is undertaken is\nvalidated and provided legitimacy. The work could not take place without honoured and respected\nguests to witness it. Witnesses are asked to store and care for the history they witness and to share\nit with their own people when they return home. For Aboriginal peoples, the act of witnessing\nthese events comes with a great responsibility to remember all the details and be able to recount\nthem accurately as the foundation of oral histories.
