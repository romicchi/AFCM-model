{"text":"INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nGeography is a diverse discipline that has some sort of connection to most\nevery other academic discipline. This connection is the spatial perspective, which\nessentially means if a phenomenon can be mapped, it has some kind of relationship\nto geography. Studying the entire world is a fascinating subject, and geographical\nknowledge is fundamental to a competent understanding of our world. In this\nchapter, you will learn what geography is as well as some of the fundamental\nconcepts that underpin the discipline. These fundamental terms and concepts will\nbe interwoven throughout the text, so a sound understanding of these topics is\ncritical as you delve deeper into the chapters that follow. By the end of the chapter,\nyou will begin to think like a geographer.\n1.2 WHAT IS GEOGRAPHY?\nThe Greek word geographos from which geography is derived, is literally\ntranslated as writing (graphos) about the Earth (geo). Geography differs from the\ndiscipline of geology because geology focuses mainly on the physical Earth and\nthe processes that formed and continue to shape it. On the other hand, geography\ninvolves a much broader approach to examining the Earth, as it involves the study\nof humans as well. As such, geography has two major subdivisions, human\n(social science) and physical (natural science). This text focuses primarily\non human geography, but because the physical aspects affect humans and vice versa,\nphysical geography will not be completely excluded, but will receive less emphasis.\nGeography is the study of the physical and environmental aspects of the world,\nfrom a spatial perspective. As geographers study the Earth, the one element that\nbinds the discipline of geography and makes it unique is studying the Earth from\na spatial perspective. The spatial perspective means that the phenomenon you are\nstudying can be displayed on a map, so geography focuses on places around the\nworld. Geography, then, is a physical (or natural) and social science that asks\nthe fundamental questions, \u201cWhat is where, and why?\u201d Human geography is a\nsocial science that focuses on people, where they live, their ways of life, and their\ninteractions in different places around the world. A simple example of a geographic\nstudy in human geography would be where is the Hispanic population concentrated\nin the U.S., and why? A physical geography research endeavor might ask where do\nmost hurricanes strike the U.S. coastline, and why? In addition, because the Earth\nis dynamic, geographers also look at how places change through time, and why, so\nthere is a natural connection with history.\n1.2.1 Geography and its relationship to other disciplines\nNot only is there a connection between geography and history, but geography\nis also related to a broad range of other academic disciplines (Figure 1.1). If you\nexamine Figure 1.1, you may find your own major on the outside margin of the\nPage | 2 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\ncircle, with the corresponding subdiscipline in geography on the interior of the\ncircle. Again, if a phenomenon can be depicted on a map and studied from a spatial\nperspective, it is geographical. A basic example would relate to the health sciences\nor medical geography, the subfield of geography that focuses on the spatial patterns\nof various aspects of health. For example, when the spread of a disease from its\nsource area is mapped, medical professionals can get a better idea of the causes of\na disease and the mechanisms of its transmission. Often, the understanding of\ncultural practices or the environmental conditions (such as the habitat for a\nmosquito-borne disease) can shed light on the process of how the disease operates.\nAnother example of how geography relates to other disciplines is in economic\ngeography, the subfield that examines the different economic activities in various\nplaces, and how places interact economically. A fundamental concept in economic\nstudies is that the location of a business is often important to the success of that\nbusiness. If the business is located in close proximity to its clientele, for example,\nthe customers might be more likely to visit that restaurant, store, etc. on a regular\nbasis. A business owner would be wise to consult maps of both transportation\nnetworks as well as the population of the customers to which they intend to cater.\nPolitical\nScience\nMeteorology\nClimatologyD e m o Pg\no\nGr pa eu op la gh t ry i ao pn hy GP eo ol git ri ac pal h y Geo morpG he oo ll oo gg yy\nG e ol\noC\ngu ylt ur\naA\nl\nnt\nhS\nr\noo pci\noo ll\noo gg\nyy a n\nd\ne n ira Me c n e\nic S\ne n ira My h p a rg\no e\nG\nGEOGRAPHY G e o g ra\np h\nyE c o n o\nm ic\nE c o n o\nm ic\ns\nhy\nPs yc\nh\nol\noG e o gB r ae ph ha yvi or\nal\nBiogeograp Biology\ng\ny HiG ste oH o ri g ys rt ao pri hc yal\nPlG ae\nnU\no\nnr\ng\nib nra\na\ngn\np ah ny\nd\nM\nG\nee odi gc r Ha a Sl\ne\ncp iah\nl\nety\nnh\nces\nUrban Studies\nFigure 1.1 | Geography Relationships\nGeography and its relationship to other disciplines.1\nAuthor | Corey Parson\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 3 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\n1.3 MAPPING THE WORLD\nMaps are fundamental to the discipline of geography and have been used\nby humans since before 6,000 B.C. Today\u2019s maps are much more sophisticated,\ncomplex, and precise, and are used by many people who employ GPS mapping\nsystems in their vehicles. This technology allows motorists to navigate from place-\nto-place with relative ease, but the process by which these digital and other maps\nare created is exceptionally complex.\nEssentially, a map, which is a flat presentation of a place on Earth, is actually\ndepicting a curved surface. The Earth, which looks like a sphere, is technically an\noblate spheroid, which means that the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the Earth, around the equator,\nis slightly wider, and the north\/south pole axis is slightly shorter, than a perfect\nsphere. When any curved surface is depicted on a flat surface, that process is\nknown as projection, and many types of map projections exist. A fundamental\ncharacteristic of all maps is they involves projections, and all projections have\nsome sort of distortion inherent in them. The size, shape, distance, and direction of\nobjects are distorted to various degrees on maps. The reason this distortion occurs\ncan be visualized by simply imagining peeling an orange, and trying to flatten the\nFigure 1.2 | World Map\nWorld Map with Mercator Projection.\nAuthor | User \u201cStrebe\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY-SA 3.0\nPage | 4 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\npeel on a table. If you drew the continents on that orange before peeling it, the\ncontinents would most certainly be distorted when you try to flatten the peel on\nthe table. This analogy does not precisely describe how projections are created; the\nprocess is much more involved. However, the underlying principle still applies. An\nexample of distortion is shown on the map of the globe below (Figure 1.2). Note,\nfor example, in this Mercator projection that Greenland appears to be larger than\nSouth America, although it is, in fact, much smaller.\nBesides projections, another important characteristic of maps is the scale. The\nscale of a map is a ratio of the length or distance on the map versus the length or\ndistance on the Earth or ground (actual). The amount of detail shown on a map\nwill vary based on the scale. For example, a map with a scale of 1:100,000 (which\nmeans 1 in\/cm on the map equals 1,000,000 in\/cm on the ground) would show\nmuch less detail than a map at a scale of 1:10,000 (Figure 1.3). Besides showing\nscale as a ratio, it can also be presented as a bar graph or as a verbal statement.\nScale can also mean the spatial extent of some kind of phenomena. For example,\none could examine migration at the global, national, state, or local scale. By either\ndefinition, however, each refers to the level of detail about the place that the\ngeographer is researching. Examining the world from different scales enables\ndifferent patterns and connections to emerge.\nFigure 1.3 | Comparison of Map Scales\nThe map on the left is a small scale map, showing a larger area. The map on the right is a large scale map, showing a smaller area.\nAuthor | Corey Parson, Google Maps\nSource | Google Maps\nLicense | \u00a9 Google Maps.

Therefore, one of the basic ways to pinpoint a location\non the Earth is using the geographic grid. The geographic grid is comprised of\nmeridians and parallels, which are imaginary lines and arcs crisscrossing the\nEarth\u2019s surface. Meridians are half circles that connect the north and south poles,\nand longitude refers to the numbering system for meridians. Parallels are\ncircles that encompass the Earth and are parallel to the equator, and the numbering\nsystem for these circles is known as latitude (Figure 1.4). Where meridians and\nparallels intersect at precise locations (points) on the Earth on the geographic grid,\na location can be known by its latitude and longitude.\nFigure 1.4 | Longitude and Latitude\nThe geographic grid comprised of meridians and parallels with longitude and latitude.\nAuthor | User \u201cDjexplo\u201d and Corey Parson\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC 0\nA few meridians on Earth are of particular importance, one being the Prime\nMeridian located at 0o longitude, which passes through Greenwich, England. The\nother important meridian, called the International Date Line, follows roughly\nalong 180 o longitude, and this meridian is on the opposite side of the world from\nthe Prime Meridian (Figure 1.5). When a traveler crosses the International Date\nLine, the day of the week instantaneously changes. When moving westward, the\nday moves forward, and when traveling eastward, the date jumps backward one\nday. Fortunately, the International Date Line is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,\nso disruptions to the daily calendar are minimal for most people in the world.\nMoreover, the International Date Line does not precisely follow the 180 o longitude\nline, and this accommodation allows countries and territories consisting of islands\nthat straddle 180 o longitude to share the same calendar date.\nPage | 6 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\nFigure 1.5 | Time Zones\nThis world map shows the international date line and global time zones.\nAuthor | Central Intelligence Agency\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\n1.5 HOW DO I DESCRIBE WHERE I AM?\nDefining a location by using the geographic grid is only part of the process of\ndescribing a place. Geographers are primarily concerned with two ways of describing\na place: site and situation. Site refers to the physical characteristics, such as the\ntopography, vegetative cover, climatic conditions, and the like. Situation, on the\nother hand, refers to the area surrounding the place, and is sometimes referred to\nas relative location. In other words, where is this place relative to other places, and\nhow is it connected to its surroundings via transportation networks? New Orleans\nprovides an excellent example of site versus situation. The site of New Orleans is\nnot ideal for a city, as it lies below sea level and is prone to flooding. However, the\nsituation of New Orleans is much better in that New Orleans is connected to large\nportion of the Mississippi River\u2019s network of navigable waterways while also being\nclose to the Gulf of Mexico and convenient to coastal traffic. Hence, the situation of\nNew Orleans is why the city has not long since been abandoned, despite catastrophic\nflooding such as during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As we examine various places\naround the world, both site and situation are key considerations in determining\nthe \u201cwhy\u201d of where a place is located.\n1.5.1 Regions\nWhile site and situation can help describe a place, a broader view of the world\nand the connections between places can be derived from the concept of regions. A\nregion is an area that shares some sort of common characteristic that binds the area\ninto a whole. Geographers use regions to help one understand the interconnections\nPage | 7 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\nbetween places and simplify a complex world. Two major types of regions are\nformal and functional. Formal regions are characterized by homogeneity or\nuniformity in one or a number of different characteristics. These characteristics\ncan be both human and physical-related, so regions could be defined by climate\nor vegetation types, in the sense of physical geography, or they could be defined\nby language or ethnicity, in the sense of human geography. One example of a map\nthat includes formal regions would be a map of the states in the US. In this map,\neach state could be considered a formal region because each state is governed in a\ncommon or unique way, and hence portrays homogeneity (Figure 1.6).\nFigure 1.6 | United States\nThis map shows the formal regions of the states.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nA functional region, which is sometimes called a nodal region, is an area\nthat contains a central node or focal point to which other places in the region are\nconnected by some activity. Functional regions can be seen in cities where the\ncentral area of the city might serve as the focal point for the rest of the metropolitan\narea (Figure 1.7). At a smaller scale, a Wi-Fi hotspot could be considered the focal\npoint of a functional region that extends to the range of the Wi-Fi signal. Even the\ndelivery area for the local pizza restaurant would be a functional region with the\nrestaurant as a central node.\nRegions are devised and not absolute, so whether or not a particular place fits\nwithin a region is sometimes a matter of dispute. For example, scholars disagree\nPage | 8 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\nFigure 1.7 | Atlanta MSA\nThe Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the United States Census Bureau.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 1.8 | The Fuzzy Boundaries of the American South\nIt\u2019s not exactly the old Confederacy, or the slave states. And it varies from one part to the next.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 9 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\non the exact extent of the American South as a formal region. What defines this\nregion? It depends on what characteristics one uses to define the region, be they\nfood, dialect, political affiliation, historical affiliation in the Civil War, or any\nother element the mind conjures up when one thinks of the South as a relatively\nhomogeneous formal region. Most geographers see Texas as a part of the South,\nbut West Texas is much different from East Texas, and Florida is likewise diverse.\nExtreme southern Florida is vastly different from the panhandle of Florida in\nethnic make-up and political affiliation. The opinion on what constitutes the\nSouthern region varies based on personal viewpoints (Figure 1.8). The Southern\nregion, then, may be thought of as a vernacular (or perceptual) region because the\nboundaries of these types of regions depend on the perspectives or mental maps\nof different groups of people who live both outside or inside that region. Hence,\nthe concept of regions and their definition is not a straightforward process and\ninvolves generalities and varying opinions.\n1.6 GEOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nIn order to analyze and develop regions, describe places, and conduct detailed\ngeographic analysis, two important tools have been developed that are of particular\nvalue to geographers. The first is remote sensing, or the acquisition of data about\nthe Earth\u2019s surface from aerial platforms such as satellites, airplanes or drones.\nImages taken from these airborne machines can provide a wealth of valuable\ninformation about both the human and physical characteristics of a place. For\nexample, satellite imagery can depict the extent of human impact on rainforests in\nthe Amazonian rainforest of Brazil (Figure 1.9). Imagery can also depict information\nthat humans cannot see with the naked eye, such as the temperature of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. One example is a thermal infrared image, which can show warm\ntemperatures in red tones and cooler temperatures in blue tones (Figure 1.10).\nFigure 1.9 | Deforestation Figure 1.10 | Thermal Imaging\nDeforestation in the state of Rond\u00f4nia, western Brazil. Thermal imagery of Atlanta, GA.\nAuthor | NASA Author | NASA\nSource | Earth Observatory Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain License | Public Domain\nPage | 10 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\nDigital imagery like the one in Figure 1.9 is in a format that can be entered into\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS), the second important tool employed\nby geographers. GIS combines computer hardware and software in a system that\nstores, analyzes and displays geographic data with a \u201ccomputer mapping\u201d capability.\nGeographic data is stored in layers, and these layers of data can be queried in a\nnumber of sophisticated ways to analyze some aspect of an area (Figure 1.11). Each\ndata point in a GIS is georeferenced to\na precise location on the Earth\u2019s surface\n(latitude and longitude, for example),\nand these data points have different\nattributes corresponding to the data\nlayer they are associated with. Data\nlayers can represent a myriad of char-\nacteristics about that data point, such\nas elevation, soils, the presence of\nwater, per-capita income, ethnicity,\netc. Overlaying the data layers can\nprovide incredible insights into the\nconnections between characteristics\/\nfactors in places, such as the connec-\ntion between per-capita income and Figure 1.11 | Data Layers\nData layers in a Geographic Information System (GIS).\nethnicity or the links between soil types\nAuthor | US Government Accountability Office\nand vegetative cover. GIS also has a Source | National Geographic\nvast suite of other capabilities such as License | Public Domain\nleast-cost path for transportation, line-\nof-sight perspectives from a particular\nlocation, or 3-D models of urban areas.\nBecause of their multi-faceted capacity\nto present geographic information,\nbusinesses and government agencies\naround the world use GIS to answer\nquestions, plan development, chart\ndelivery routes, and even monitor\ncrime and first responder activity\n(Figure 1.12). It is not surprising that\none of the fastest growing job markets\nis in GIS technology, as GIS jobs exist\nat the local, state, and national level as\nwell as in many businesses in the\nprivate sector.

However, the Earth is dynamic and constantly changing, and\none of the reasons places change is because of diffusion. Diffusion is the spread of\nideas, objects, inventions, and other practices from place to place. As people migrate\nor move to a new area, they bring their ideas, objects, and the like with them in a\nprocess call relocation diffusion. Another diffusion process involves the spread\noutward from a core area that\nRelocation Diffusion\ncontains the idea, cultural prac-\nInitial Stage Later Stage\ntice, etc. This type of diffusion\nis expansion diffusion, and\nthis type of diffusion can occur\nfrom person-to-person contact\n(as with a contagious disease)\nor through a hierarchy, or\nstratified condition, where the Expansion Diffusion\nidea might originate in a major Initial Stage Later Stage\ncity, spread to medium-sized\ncities, and so on to smaller cities\n(Figure 1.13). In Chapter 6, we\nwill examine how religion has\nspread across the world through\nboth relocation and expansion\ndiffusion, and in Chapter 10, we Figure 1.13 | Diffusion\nwill see that domesticated plants Relocation and expansion diffusion.2\nAuthor | Corey Parson\nand animals have diffused\nSource | Original Work\nextensively across the Earth. License | CC BY SA 4.0\n1.8 THE HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIP\nThe process of spatial diffusion can be profoundly affected by the physical\nterrain, such as is the case with a mountain range. Because migration and\ntransportation over mountain ranges can be limited, diffusion can be slowed or\neven stopped by these physical barriers. This example is but one instance of the\nrelationship between humans and their environment. The environment can\nsignificantly affect human activities, and vice versa, humans can shape and change\nthe Earth\u2019s surface and its atmosphere. Two major perspectives on the human-\nenvironment relationship in the field of geography are environmental determinism,\nwhich has been largely rejected, and possibilism. Environmental determinism\nis the idea that the natural or physical environment shapes and creates cultures; in\nother words, the environment essentially dictates culture. For example,\nenvironmental determinists in the 1920s thought that people who lived in the\nPage | 12 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\ntropics were slothful and backward because finding food in the tropics was thought\nto be rather easy. In contrast, Europeans, who lived in \u201cstimulating\u201d climates with\na sharp change in seasons were more industrious and inventive. The racist\nundertones of this sort of perspective is clear, but modern geographers still\nrecognize the definitive impact of the environment on societies, as can be seen, for\nexample, in the theorized demise of the Anasazi people in the American Southwest\nbecause of extended drought (Figure 1.14).\nThe Anasazi, who are be-\nlieved to have inhabited in the\nSouthwestern U.S. from 100\nB.C. to 1300 A.D., were ill-\nequipped to deal with drought, Fremont\ncompared to those who inhabit\nthe modern-day states of New\nMexico and Arizona. In the view\nAnasazi\nof possibilism, people can\nSinagua\nPatayan\nadapt to their environmental\nconditions, despite the limita-\ntions they might pose, and if a Hohokam\nMogollon\nsociety has better technology,\nthe people are better able to\nadapt and develop their culture\nin a number of possible ways.\nFigure 1.14 | Indigenous People of the Four Corners\nThe possibilities are greater,\nExtent of Anasazi and other indigenous people, U.S. Southwest.3\nhence, the term possibilism.

Although snow skiing in the Middle East may seem preposterous,\nplans are in place to build the longest indoor ski slope in the world in this city,\nwhere one ski slope already exists (Figure 1.15). Even technological advanced\nFigure 1.15 | Ski Dubai\nIndoor ski slope at Ski Dubai located in the Mall of the Emirates.\nAuthor | Filipe Fortes\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 2.0\nPage | 13 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION TO GEOGRAPHY\nsocieties, however, can still be tremendously affected by the environment and have\nlittle or no control over the power of nature. The devastating impact of hurricanes\nin the United States, tsunamis in Japan, and fire in the United States are but a few\nexamples (Figures 1.16 and 1.17).\nFigure 1.16 | Colby Fire, California, 2014 Figure 1.17 | Tennessee Wildfires, 2016\nColby Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains foothills.

There are many reasons for this, two of which were mentioned previously,\nbut there are others. The effect of infant mortality drives some people to have\na large number of children in the forlorn hope that some of them survive to\nadulthood. Another is the effect of migration, which can boost incomes by sending\nsome population to other countries to work, but depopulate the places that are\nsending migrants.\nIn almost all countries, the rate of population growth has slowed. Two countries,\nChina and India, account for 36 percent of the world\u2019s population. Any change\nin these two places will have a large impact on the values for the entire planet.\nAccording to the World Bank for 2013, the population of China is growing .5\npercent per year, India is growing 1.2 percent per year, the United States is growing\nby .7 percent per year, and Indonesia is growing by 1.2 percent per year. The rates\nfor all these countries have been falling for decades, even Indonesia and India.\nThe populations of the countries of Japan, Russia, Germany, Spain, and Ukraine\nare all shrinking whereas the populations of Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, Iraq, and Kenya are expanding rapidly (Figure 2.5). In developed countries,\npopulation decline has implications for social programs such as retirement, which is\nfunded by a shrinking pool of workers. In very advanced societies, a worker shortage\nis driving rapid development of robotics. In poorer places rapid population growth\ncan trigger large-scale migration and social disruption.\nWhy is it so difficult to find one characteristic that explains the population\ndynamics of a particular country? Because places matter. Each place is a unique\ncombination of factors, and their interactions.\nPage | 20 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nFigure 2.5 | Countries by Population Growth Rate 20153\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\n2.2 THINKING ABOUT POPULATION\n2.2.1 The Greeks and Ecumene\nNo discussion of population is complete without a brief history of the\nphilosophical understanding of population. This discussion starts as it often does,\nwith the ancient Greeks. The Greeks considered that they lived in the best place on\nEarth. In fact, they believed in the exact center of the habitable part of the Earth.\nThey called the habitable part of the Earth ecumene. To the Greeks, places north\nof them were too cold, and places to the south were too hot. Placing your own\nhomeland in the center of goodness is common; many groups have done this. The\nGreeks decided that the environment explained the distribution of people. To an\nextent, their thinking persists, but only at the most extreme definitions. Many\nplaces that the Greeks would have found too cold (Moscow, Stockholm) too hot\n(Kuwait City, Las Vegas) too wet (Manaus, Singapore) or too dry (Timbuktu, Lima)\nhave very large populations.\n2.2.2 Modern Ideas About Population\nThomas Malthus (1766-1834) \u201cPopulation, when unchecked, increases in a\ngeometrical ratio.\u201d 4\nEster Boserup (1910-1999) \u201cThe power of ingenuity would always outmatch\nthat of demand.\u201d 5\nPage | 21 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nModern discussions of population begin with food. From the time of Thomas\nMalthus (quoted above), modern humans have acknowledged the rapidly expanding\nhuman population and its relationship with the food supply. Malthus himself was\na cleric in England who spent much of his time studying political economy. His\nviews were a product not only of his time, but also of his place. In Malthus\u2019 case his\ntime and place were a time of social, political, and economic change.\nKarl Marx (1818\u20131883) took issue with Malthus\u2019 ideas. Marx wrote that\npopulation growth alone was not responsible for a population\u2019s inability to feed\nitself, but that imbalanced social, political, and economic structures created\nartificial shortages. He also believed that growing populations reinforced the\npower of capitalists, since large pools of underemployed laborers could more easily\nbe exploited.\nThe post-World War II period saw a flurry of books warning of the dangers\nof population growth with books like Fairfield Osborn\u2019s Our Plundered Planet\nand William Vogt\u2019s Road to Survival. Perhaps most explicit was Paul and Anne\nEhrlich\u2019s The Population Bomb.\nThese books are warnings of the dangers of unchecked population growth.\nMalthus wrote that populations tend to grow faster than the expansion of food\nproduction and that populations will grow until they outstrip their food supplies.\nThis is to say that starvation, war, and disease were all predictions of Malthus\nand were revived in these Neo-Malthusian publications. Some part of the current\nconversation of environmentalism regards limiting the growth of the human\npopulation, echoing Malthus.\nA common theme of these books is that they all attempt to predict the future.\nOne of the advantages we have living centuries or decades after these books is the\nopportunity to see if these predictions were accurate or not. Ehrlich\u2019s book predicted\nthat by the 1970s, starvation would be widespread because of food shortages and\na collapse in food production. That did not happen. In fact, the global disasters\npredicted in all these books have yet to arrive decades later. What saved us?\nPerhaps nothing has saved us. We have just managed to push the reckoning a\nbit further down the road.\nIf we have been saved, then the assumptions inherent in the predictions were\nwrong. What were they?\n1. Humans would not voluntarily limit their reproduction.\n2. Farming technology would suddenly stop advancing.\n3. Food distribution systems would not improve.\n4. Land would become unusable from overuse.\nAll of these assumptions have proven to be wrong, at least so far. Only the most\nnegative interpretation of any particular factor in this equation could be accepted.\nPage | 22 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nOne the other hand, Ester Boserup, an agricultural economist in the twentieth\ncentury, drew nearly the opposite conclusion from her study of human population.\nHer reason for doing so were manifold. First, she was born one and one -half\ncenturies later, which gave her considerably more data to interpret. Second,\nshe didn\u2019t grow to adulthood in the center of a burgeoning empire. She was a\nfunctionary in the early days of the United Nations. Third, she was a trained as an\neconomist, and finally, she was a woman. Each one of these factors was important.\n2.2.3 Let\u2019s Investigate Each One of These Assumptions\nIn preindustrial societies, children are a workforce and a retirement plan.\nFamilies can try to use large numbers of children to improve their economic\nprospects. Children are literally an economic asset. Birth rates fall when societies\nindustrialize. They fall dramatically when women enter the paid workforce. Children\nin industrialized societies are generally not working and are not economic assets.\nThe focus in such societies tends to be preparing children through education for a\ntechnologically-skilled livelihood. Developed societies tend to care for their elderly\npopulation, decreasing the need for a large family. Developed societies also have\nlower rates of infant mortality, meaning that more children survive to adulthood.\nThe increasing social power of women factors into this. Women who control\ntheir own lives rarely choose to have large numbers of children. Related to this,\nthe invention and distribution of birth control technologies has reduced human\nnumbers in places where it is available.\nFarming technology has increased tremendously. More food is now produced\non less land than was farmed a century ago. Some of these increases are due to\nmanipulations of the food itself\u2014more productive seeds and pesticides, but some\npart of this is due to improvements in food processing and distribution. Just think\nof the advantages that refrigeration, freezing, canning and dehydrating have given\nus. Add to that the ability to move food tremendous distances at relatively low cost.\nSomehow, during the time that all these technologies were becoming available,\nNeo-Malthusians were discounting them.\nSome marginal land has become unusable, either through desertification or\nerosion, but this land was not particularly productive anyway, hence the term marginal.\nThe loss of this land has been more than compensated by improved production.\nAt this point, it looks like a win for Boserup, but maybe it isn\u2019t. Up to this point\nwe have been mixing our discussions of scale. Malthus was largely writing about\nthe British Isles, and Boserup was really writing about the developed countries of\nthe world. The local realities can be much more complex.\nAt the global scale there is enough food, and that has been true for decades. In\nfact, many developed societies produce more food than they can either consume\nor sell. The local situation is completely different. There are developed countries\nthat have been unable to grow food to feed themselves for over a century. The\nUnited Kingdom, Malthus\u2019 home, is one of them. However, no one ever calls the\nU.K. overpopulated. Why not? Because they can buy food on the world market.\nPage | 23 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nLocal-scale famines happen because poorer places cannot produce enough\nfood for themselves and then cannot or will not buy food from other places. Places\nthat are politically marginalized within a country can also experience famines\nwhen central governments choose not to mobilize resources toward the disfavored.\nPolitically unstable places may not even have the necessary infrastructure to\ndeliver free food from other parts of the world. This is assuming that food aid is\neven a good idea (a concept revisited in the agriculture chapter). These sorts of\nproblems persist to this day and they have an impact of population, although often\nin unpredictable ways, such as triggering large-scale migration or armed conflict.\nTo recap, at the global level, population has not been limited by food\nproduction. However, people do not live at the \u201cglobal level.\u201d They live locally\nwith whatever circumstances they may have. In many places the realities of food\ninsecurity are paramount.\nAlthough discussions of population tend to start with food, they cannot end\nwith it. People have more needs than their immediate nutrition. They need clothing\nand shelter as well. They also have desires for a high standard of living- heating,\nelectricity, automobiles and technology. All of these needs and desires require\nenergy and materials. The pressure put on the planet over the last two centuries\nhas less to do with the burgeoning population and more to do with burgeoning\nexpectations of quality of life.\n2.2.4 Scale and the Ecological Fallacy\nNumbers can be a little bit misleading. You may read that the \u201caverage woman\u201d\nin the United Sates has 1.86 births and wonder, \u201cWhat does this tell me about a\nparticular woman?\u201d And the answer is . . . it tells you nothing. Remember that\nnumber is an aggregate of the data for the entire country, which means it only\nworks at that scale; it only tells you about the country as a whole. The Ecological\nFallacy is the idea that statistics generated at one level of aggregation can be\napplied at other levels of aggregation.\nSimilarly, one of the biggest problems\nwith maps is that they can make us think\nthat a place is the same (homogenous)\nwithin a border. We see a country like\nthe United States, and it has one color\nfor the entire area on the map and we\ntell ourselves that the U.S. is just one\nplace. And it is. But it\u2019s made of many\nsmaller places. It\u2019s fifty states, and those\nstates combined have 3144 counties (and Figure 2.6 | Percent Hispanic aggregated\ncounty-like things). And each one of to the County, State, and National level6\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nthose things is a level of aggregation. It\nSource | Original Work\nlooks a bit like this (Figure 2.6). License | CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 24 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nWebb County only uses the data from one county. New Mexico uses the data\nfor its 33 counties, and the U.S. uses the data for all its counties. Each level of\naggregation has its calculated value. They are all different. And they still tell you\nnothing about an individual person.\n2.3 POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe can return to the diverging ideas of Malthus and Boserup. Does population\ngrowth spur innovation or starvation? Is population growth good or bad?\nPopulation growth has spurred innovation, but interestingly enough, not\nusually in the places that are experiencing that growth right now. If population\ngrowth is dramatically higher than economic growth, the result will not be new\ntechnologies and paradigm shifts; it will be emigration or civil unrest.\nA country like Russia with a large land mass and a relatively small population\nmay be underpopulated compared to its neighbor, China (Figure 2.7). Having\nlarge tracts of uninhabited land has historically invited the attention of outsiders.\nUnderpopulation is not normally the problem that most people would associate\nwith population. When we think of population problems, we generally think of\noverpopulation. What is overpopulation? Like so many other questions we have\nasked so far, the answer depends. Overpopulation means an inability to support\na population with the resources available.\nFigure 2.7 | Population Cartogram7\nThis population cartogram takes the borders of each country and adjusts the size of the country by the size of the\npopulation. What happens to China and India? What happens to Canada and Russia? What does this tell you?\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 25 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\n2.4 POPULATION IS DYNAMIC\nAlthough the world\u2019s population is still growing, the overall growth has slowed\nand the growth has become very uneven. Some places are still growing very\nrapidly. Others are growing much more slowly and some are shrinking in terms of\npopulation. We can compare differences between places using a series of different\nrates. Rates are ratios that divide the occurrence of a phenomenon with the\npopulation hosting the phenomenon. For example, crude birth rate is calculated\nas the number of births per 1000 people in a particular place in a particular year.\nThe crude death rate is similar. It is calculated as deaths per 1000 people in a\nparticular place in a particular year. These numbers can be used to compare places,\nbut they have great limitations.\nFor one thing, they are aggregated variables describing the entire country; they\ntell you nothing about individuals within the country. Just because the average\nwoman in a country has 2.3 children tells you nothing about a particular woman.\nThe ecological fallacy is the idea that aggregated data tell you anything about\nindividuals. It does not because it cannot. Once the data are lumped together, they\nlose their individual characteristics.\nThe rates do not necessarily relate to one another, either. The crude birth rate\ndoesn\u2019t tell you anything about the average number of children born per woman, at\nwhat stage in their lives women tend to have children, etc. The crude death rates\ndon\u2019t separate deaths of elderly people from deaths of infants. High rates of death\nare often found in developed societies; in many ways it\u2019s a sign of development, since\ndeveloped countries tend to have older populations. A high rate of infant mortality\n(children under 1 year of age) is a near-universal sign of underdevelopment. The\ncountries with the highest crude birth rates tend to be low income (Figure 2.8).\nFigure 2.8 | Crude Birth Rate 20158\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\nPage | 26 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nThe crude death rate is more nuanced (Figure 2.9). Some countries on the\nmap, for example, Chad, have a high crude death rate due to a high rate of infant\nand child mortality. Russia, on the other hand, has a rapidly aging population and\na partially collapsed social security network.\nFigure 2.9 | Crude Death Rate 20159\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\nThe replacement level of a population refers to the number of births that\nare necessary to offset deaths. This is often referred to in terms of average fertility\nof women. In modern societies, on average, women need to produce 2.1 children\nin a lifetime to keep a place demographically stable. This number is derived by\ncounting a mother and her partner, and accounts for those who never reproduce.\nPlaces with a fertility rate below 2.1 will shrink over time. Those places above\nthat will grow, and those well above that will grow quickly (Figure 2.10). The\npreceding graphic demonstrates that in the same way that many places are growing\nvery rapidly, many places are at or below replacement. The United States is below\nreplacement. It is demographically buoyed by immigration.\nWhat kinds of places are growing fastest? These are places that are poor or\neconomically or politically unstable. This may seem counterintuitive. Why would\npeople have children in places that are already so poor? Remember that individual\nfamilies have children. Children can seem like a mechanism for surviving bad\nsituations. What kinds of places are declining? This is more complicated, but\nin general the more educated and empowered the female population is, the\nlower the birth rate. This isn\u2019t a perfect, linear relationship, but it\u2019s useful as a\nstart. Why is there so much variability? Because places matter. Uganda has a\ngovernment advocating population growth, while Afghanistan and Somalia have\nlittle governance at all. Russia and Australia have similar fertility rates, and few\nother similarities.\nPage | 27 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nFigure 2.10 | Countries by Average Fertility 201510\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY-SA 4.0\nGeneral measurements of population are useful, but often if is useful to know\nthe age and gender structure of a population. This is shown using a population\npyramid. A population pyramid breaks the population into groups sorted by age\nranges, called cohorts, as well as by sex. The resulting shape tells you a great deal\nabout the population dynamic of the country. If the shape is actually a pyramid,\nthen the country has a high birth rate and a high death rate. Countries with stable\npopulations look like a column. Some countries even have their greatest population\nin the older cohorts with comparably few young people. Figure 2.11 shows some\nexamples of current populations. Some examples of estimated future populations\nare shown in Figure 2.12.\nFirst, it is important that you understand that all these numbers are estimates.\nCurrent population numbers are good enough for general comparison. As you can\nsee, the differences between places becomes more pronounced as we look toward\nthe future. The world population increases by over two billion people, but what is\ninteresting are the shifting dynamics between countries. China shrinks by more\nthan 30 million, the US grows by 64 million, and Niger- a poor Saharan country-\ngrows by 52 million, more than double its current size! One of the most useful\nmeasures of population is doubling time, which is how much time it would take\nat current levels of population growth for a population to double. According to\nFigure 2.2, most of human history saw very slow growth with doubling times\nmeasured in centuries. During the 19th and 20th centuries, doubling time at the\nglobal level fell to as short as 35 years.\nThis has numerous implications. At the global level, those extra billions will need\nfood and water, houses and clothing. That is to say that they will require resources.\nThey will also have desires that require even more materials and energy expenditure.\nIn places like Niger, this will be very difficult, if not impossible, to meet.\nPage | 28 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nFigure 2.11 | Population Pyramids for select countries 2016\nAuthors | Martin de Wulf, David Dorrell\nSource | PopulationPyramid.net\nLicense | MIT License\nFigure 2.12 | Population Pyramids for select countries 2050\nAuthors | Martin de Wulf, David Dorrell\nSource | PopulationPyramid.net\nLicense | MIT License\nPage | 29 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nIn places like China, a completely different problem presents itself. These\npopulations are both shrinking and aging. Life expectancy, the average lifespan\nin a country, has been increasing for decades in developed and some developing\ncountries. At the same time, birth rates have fallen for a variety of reasons. This\nmeans that as time passes, the elderly portion of the population has grown. Many\ncountries will see their populations age until large percentages will be unable\nto work. Societies for the past several centuries have prepared themselves for\npopulation growth, and much of modern society is predicated on it. Population\ngrowth is what has paid for social security for the elderly. Few places have prepared\nthemselves for fewer workers in the future (although robotics may address this\nproblem). This change will not happen at once, but the effects will be tremendous.\nAnother characteristic that must be acknowledged is population momentum.\nWhen much of your population is older than 45, it isn\u2019t reasonable to expect that\npopulation will continue to grow quickly. Countries with young populations should\nexpect that their populations will grow when the large pool of young people have\nchildren of their own.\nThis map shows the tremendous differences in life expectancy from one country\nto another (Figure 2.13). In some places, people tend to live into their ninth\ndecade. In others, they are unlikely to make it into their sixth.\nFigure 2.13 | Life Expectancy 201511\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nThe dependency ratio is simply the number of people within a society who do\nnot work compared to the number who do work. There are two main components\nof the dependency ratio- children under 15 years old and the elderly over 65 years\nold, although the degree to which either group is dependent is variable (Figures\n2.14 and 2.15). Children need care and schooling, but generally produce little of\neconomic value. Elderly populations can be too infirm to work and are the part of\nPage | 30 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nFigure 2.14 | Elderly Dependency Ratio 201512\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 2.15 | Youth Dependency Ratio 201513\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nthe population with the highest medical costs. Where does the wealth come from\nto take care of these two groups? It comes from the people working and producing\nwealth. If the dependency ratio is high, then each worker can be responsible for a\nlarge number of dependents and less wealth will be left for the workers.\nAlthough the dependency ratio is used to compare places, this particular ratio\ncan be somewhat misleading. In many less developed places, children are not\ndependent. They are not in school and they are employed. They are not consuming\na family\u2019s resources, but are instead contributing to them. In other places, the\nPage | 31 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nelderly may still be in the workplace. The dependency ratio informs decisions\nregarding the future. Will a country need more schools or assisted living centers.\nWhat does this mean for retirement or pensions? Perhaps more importantly, will\nthe supply of workers increase or decrease? Comparing China, Niger, and the U.S.\nshows you that different places have different options and challenges.\n2.5 THE DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION\nGeographers have modeled the population dynamics of places for decades. The\nresult of these models is called the Demographic Transition model (Figure\n2.16). It describes a series of stages that societies pass through as they develop and\nindustrialize. These models represent the general demographic conditions that\ncountries experience.\nFigure 2.16 | Demographic Transition Model\nAuthor | Max Roser\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nIn Stage One, which is pre-modern, birth rates are high, and death rates are\nhigh. As a result of these two factors, the population remains low, but stable.\nBy Stage Two as the society industrializes food becomes more steadily\navailable, water supplies get cleaner and sanitation and medical care improves.\nDeath rates fall, particularly infant mortality rates. However, there is a lag in the\ndecline in birth rates. It takes time for people to adjust to the new reality of urban\nindustrial life. Since the birth rate is still high and the death rate is low, population\ngrows very rapidly.\nPage | 32 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nStage Three is characterized by a falling birth rate as the society begins to\nfind an equilibrium between birth and deaths. The birth rates are still higher than\ndeath rates and population continues to increase. This continuation of population\nincrease is known as population momentum. The end of Stage Three is characterized\nby the general balance between births and deaths.\nStage Four shows a return to population stability, but at a much greater\nnumber of people.\n2.6 MEASURING THE IMPACT OF POPULATION\nRemember the earlier comparison of Russia and Bangladesh? This is the section\nwhere we discuss the different ways of calculating the pressure that populations\nput onto the land that they inhabit. You\u2019ll recall that we began by looking simply\nat people per country. This is a good way to start, but the limitations are fairly\nobvious. Countries that are physically larger can hold more people. We need to use\na method that changes from a measure of overall population to some kind of per\ncapita measure. There are many of these and each has its merits.\nArithmetic density is the simplest one. It is simply the number of people\ndivided by the area of the country. The area is usually measured in square\nkilometers, since most of the world uses the metric system (Figure 2.17).\nFigure 2.17 | Arithmetic Density 201514\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPhysiological density has the same numerator (population), but the\ndenominator is different. Instead of using all the land in a country, it only accounts\nfor arable (farmable) land (Figure 2.18). Places that are not used for agriculture-\ndeserts, lakes, mountaintops and similar places - are subtracted from the land\ntotal. This is useful for demonstrating how much pressure is being put on the\nPage | 33 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nfarmland that is available. Be aware that food that is gathered or hunted from\nnonagricultural land is not considered in this number.\nFigure 2.18 | Physiological Density 201515\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nAgricultural density has the same denominator as physiological density,\nbut has a different numerator. Instead of using the entire population, it only\nuses farmers (Figure 2.19). This provides a number that is a good measure of\ndevelopment, or rather it\u2019s a good measure of underdevelopment. Developed\ncountries have mechanized agriculture and few farmers per capita. Each farm tends\nFigure 2.19 | Agricultural Density 201516\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 34 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nto be large in order to generate a sufficient income. Places with high agricultural\ndensities have more farmers per hectare, meaning that farms will likely produce\nless revenue. Of course, an underlying assumption of this number is the idea that\npeople are growing food to earn a living. If they are eating the produce directly,\noutside the cash economy, then the comparison is less valid.\nRelated to food production is the concept of carrying capacity. Carrying\ncapacity is simply how many people can live from a given piece of land. However,\nit\u2019s not really that simple. Carrying capacity is not static throughout time. Not only\ndo environmental characteristics change (due to desertification, for example) but\ntechnology changes as well. The carrying capacity of land in wealthy developed\ncountries has expanded tremendously due to the application of technology. These\ntechnologies could be something as simple as irrigation ditches to something as\ncomplex as genetic modification of the plants and animals themselves. Carrying\ncapacity is snapshot taken at a particular time.\n2.7 FUTURE POPULATION\nWhen we looked at the population pyramids we considered both the current\npopulation conditions and the projected population pyramids. When we looked at\nthe first graph in the chapter, it didn\u2019t stop at the current year. It provided three\ndifferent estimates of the near future. Estimating future populations is important,\nboth at the global level and the national level, but also at the local level as well.\nSocieties large and small attempt to plan their futures in terms of resource\nallocation and economic development. Population projections are difficult. They\nattempt to take current circumstances and use them to plot the likeliest future.\nThe problem is that the future may not be like the present. A disease that is\nsuppressing fertility may be cured. The climate may change more than expected.\nWe could experience another world war. Any number of unexpected large scale\nevents could occur that completely invalidate the reasoning behind a projection.\nNicholas Talib calls these Black Swan events. They are things that you don\u2019t know\nabout until you do know about them. Irrespective projections will be made because\nthey are necessary.\n2.8 GEOGRAPHY OF HEALTH\nAlthough the health of populations has been considered in most sections of\nthis chapter, there are some aspects that can be addressed most appropriately on\ntheir own. The geography of health or medical geography is the study sickness\nor health across space. In the same way that it is possible to compare places by\ntheir population characteristics, it is possible to compare places by their health\ncharacteristics. Also in the same way that societies tend to pass through the stages\nof demographic transition, they also tend to pass through an epidemiological\ntransition. The demographic transition and epidemiological transition are\nsomewhat related. The improvements in food supply and better sanitation that\nPage | 35 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nlead to larger populations also lead to healthier populations. They are not exactly\nthe same thing however. Epidemiology is the study of diseases themselves and the\nway that they function. The epidemiological transition is a way of representing the\nrelationship between development and disease. In less developed places, infant\nmortality is high (Figure 2.20) and infectious disease is the greatest threat. In\nmore developed societies, the health threats tend to be chronic afflictions- cancer,\ndiabetes, or heart disease. One of the reasons for the difference between the\ndeveloped and less developed places is the fact that in developed countries people\ntend to live longer. Countries in which people die in their forties will not have a\nproblem with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nFigure 2.20 | Infant Mortality 201517\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nMortality refers to death and morbidity refers to sickness. We can look at\ndifferent rates of mortality and morbidity to gain some insight into the health of a\npopulation.\nDiabetes was once related to development, but the relationship is weakening\n(Figure 2.21). As obesity becomes a greater problem in developing countries, so\ndoes diabetes.\nOn the other hand, malaria is a disease of poor countries, or at least it is a\ndisease of poor places (Figure 2.22). The poorer parts of developing countries\nwill likely have malaria problems, while the wealthier parts may not.\nOne of the changes that has occurred in medical geography is that the differences\nbetween the developed and less developed countries have been narrowing. Obesity\nwas once considered fully within the sphere of developed world problems, but the\nobesity crisis has diffused into many parts of the developing world now. In the\nsame way, infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis C have become problems\nin developed countries.\nPage | 36 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nFigure 2.21 | Diabetes Morbidity 201518\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 2.22 | Malaria Incidence 201519\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nDue to the work of numerous organizations, a number of diseases in many\nparts of the world have been reduced and some have been eradicated. Smallpox\nno longer exists in the wild and Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) has gone from\nmillions of cases thirty years ago to single digits in recent years. Other diseases\nhave been dramatically reduced. Polio once infected millions of people per year\nacross the world, but through vaccination programs, its range has been reduced\nto just two countries.\nPage | 37 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nThere is now even a category of diseases known as re-emerging diseases. These\nare diseases that were previously thought to be eradicable but are now returning\nto populations that had previously been largely free of them. Re-emerging diseases\nare diseases like tuberculosis and diphtheria that had been declining for decades\nthat have begun to increase in prevalence.\n2.9 SUMMARY\nThe human population is growing, but not as much as it has in the recent past.\nThe growth is not even, with some places growing rapidly and other places losing\npopulation. Those places growing fastest tend to be poor. The effect of population\ngrowth is place-bound as well; highly developed places with low populations often\nuse more resources than less developed places with more people. The impact\nof population can be measured in a number of ways, with each measurement\nproviding a small insight into the dynamics of the human population. Uneven\npopulation growth and poverty are the two most important factors underlying the\nsubject of our next chapter, Migration.\n2.10 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAgricultural density: The number of farmers per unit area of arable land.\nArithmetic density: The population of a country divided by its total land area.\nCarrying capacity: The maximum population size that the environment can sustain\nindefinitely.\nCartogram: map in which some thematic mapping variable\u2014such as population\u2014is\nsubstituted for land area or distance.\nCohort: A subset of a population, generally defined by an age range.\nCrude birth rate: Total number of live births per 1,000 of a population in a year.\nCrude death rate: Total number of deaths per 1,000 of a population in a year.\nDemographic transition: The transition from high birth and death rates to lower birth\nand death rates as a country or region develops.\nDependency ratio: The ratio of those not in the labor force (generally ages 0 to 14 and\n65+) and those in the labor force.\nDoubling time: The period of time required for a population to double in size.\nEcological Fallacy: Characteristics about the nature of individuals are deduced from\ninference for the group to which those individuals belong.\nEcumene: The Greek concept of the habitable part of the Earth\nInfant mortality rate: The number of infant deaths that occur for every 1,000 live\nbirths.\nLife expectancy: The number of years that one is expected to live as determined by\nstatistics.\nPage | 38 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POPULATION AND HEALTH\nMorbidity: The state of being diseased or unhealthy within a population.\nMortality: The number of people who have died within a population.\nOverpopulation: A condition in which a place has outstripped its ability to provide for its\nown needs.\nPhysiological density: The number of people per unit area of arable land.\nPopulation density: A measurement of population per areal unit, such as the world, a\nregion, a country or other area.\nPopulation momentum: The tendency for population growth to continue due to high\nconcentrations of people in the childbearing years.\nPopulation projection: An estimate of future population.\nPopulation pyramid: Graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age\ngroups in a population.\nRate of natural increase: The crude birth rate minus the crude death rate.

Migration (a permanent move to a new location) over long distances\nwas so dangerous, unpredictable, and risky that humans remained in a relatively\nsmall area of Eastern Africa until only about 65,000 years ago. At that time, some\nbrave soul (or most likely many) set off on an adventure that would take tens of\nthousands of years to complete \u2013 the mass movement of humans to all corners of\nthe ecumene (inhabited areas of earth). Scientists continue to disagree about the\nspecific time periods (some studies suggest that the big move started 120,000 years\nago!) and reasons that our ancestors finally decided to take flight, but significant\nevidence suggests that periodic climate change may have played a major role. The\nearliest evidence of human remains in the North America dates to approximately\n13,000 years ago, when humans are hypothesized to have crossed an ice bridge\nfrom Eastern Russia into Alaska during the last Ice Age, before spending the next\nseveral thousand years spreading throughout North and South America and The\nCaribbean. Regardless of the time period, modern humans have been on the move\nfor a very long time\u2014a trend that has accelerated in recent years owing to cheap\ntransportation and easier access to information by potential migrants.\nMigration is also central to the formation of the world\u2019s largest religions. The\nspread of Christianity, for example, was facilitated by the massive movement\nof people within the Roman Empire along well-traveled transportation routes\nconnecting modern Israel and Palestine with Turkey, Greece, Italy, and other\nparts of the empire where new ideas, cultures and beliefs were shared. Many of\nthe most significant stories from Christianity and Judaism recount the experience\nof \u201cforeigners\u201d (sojourners) who are traveling to new lands. Similarly, Islam\u2019s\nprophet migrated from his city of birth, Mecca, to Medina in the seventh century,\nand religious ideas were spread as soldiers, merchants, and traders moved across\nNorth Africa and eventually into Europe and to Southeast Asia. Migration, in\nmany ways, has been the most impactful of all human activities on the planet.\nHad humans never taken the journey, we all would still be in East Africa, just\ndaydreaming about the rest of the earth!

Those moving in are immigrants, and\nthose moving out are emigrants. Net migration is the difference between the\nnumber of immigrants and the number of emigrants in any given year. The United\nNations provides data and analysis on immigration and emigration annually, but\nsuch figures depend largely upon government sources that are more reliable in some\nPage | 43 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\ncases than in others. For example, the United States (US) maintains databases on\nimmigrants of all types including guest workers (those given permission to enter\nthe country legally for a specific job and for a specific period of time), students,\ntourists, asylum seekers (those seeking sanctuary from political, religious,\ngender, or ethnic persecution), and undocumented migrants (those inside\nof a country without proof of residency). However, the US does not maintain or\nreport data on those that have emigrated, except in those notable cases where\nindividuals have denounced citizenship. Meanwhile, countries like Mexico and\nthe Philippines track their overseas citizens regularly, acknowledging the realities\nof dual citizenship or residency. Return migration (a permanent return to the\ncountry of origin) also represents a significant flow of people, but is often under-\nreported. For example, up to one quarter of Europeans that migrated to the US in\nthe late nineteenth century eventually returned to Europe. In recent years, more\npeople have migrated back to Mexico from the US than from Mexico to the US.\nThe process of migration, then, is a complicated nexus of movement rather than a\nsimple one-way, permanent, single-directional move from place A to place B.\nIn spite of the complex patterns and processes of migration, some general\ncharacteristics of migration and migrants were articulated by British demographer\nErnst Ravenstein (1885), characteristics known as the laws of migration. Many\nof them still hold true 135 years later. Can you decide which are still true today?\n1. Most move only a short distance.\n2. Each migration flow produces a counter-flow of migrants.\n3. Long-distance migrants tend to move to major cities.\n4. Rural residents are more migratory than those in towns.\n5. Females are more migratory than males.\n6. Economic factors are the main reason for migration.\nIn short, each of the \u201claws\u201d generally hold true in 2018 with the notable\nexception of number five. Slightly more men moved internationally than women,\nbut the truth is much more complicated. In fact, Ravenstein\u2019s estimates of female\nmigration proved incorrect as large-scale migration to North America increased in\nthe early twentieth century, during which time most immigrants were men seeking\nland, wealth, and opportunity in the \u201cNew World.\u201d\nA variety of non-government organizations, research groups, and humanitarian\nentities also track the movement of people across borders and within countries in\norder to provide a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of migration\nlocally, regionally, nationally, and globally. For example, the Migration\nInformation Source (https:\/\/www.migrationpolicy.org) offers a wealth of reports,\nanalysis, and data visualization that dramatically enhance our geographic\nunderstanding of migration. The Pew Research Center (http:\/\/www.pewresearch.\nPage | 44 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\norg\/topics\/migration) conducts regular polls often focused on Latino populations\nin the US. Other non-profit organizations track the effects of immigration in the US\nand publish regular reports, but often they lack objectivity or editorial oversight, as\nthe intent of such efforts is to achieve policy change to reduce immigration levels.\nFor example, the Federation for American Immigration-FAIR (https:\/\/fairus.\norg) is an organization motivated by the explicit desire to reduce the number of\nimmigrants and to secure the traditional cultural heritage of European Americans.\nLikewise, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) presents data to support\nits stated vision \u201cof an America that admits fewer immigrants\u201d and to reduce\nimmigration of all kinds in the twentieth century (https:\/\/cis.org\/About-Center-\nImmigration-Studies).\nGeographers have identified general trends in global migration, also known as\nNorth-South migration, in which most emigrants originate in poorer, developing\ncountries and most destinations have traditionally been wealthier, developed\ncountries. For most Americans and Canadians, this pattern is very familiar, as\nrecent decades have seen unprecedented numbers of Latinos immigrate to the\nUS for the purpose of finding higher-paying jobs and better opportunities and\nescaping structural poverty in the developing world. Similarly, the recent patterns\nin Europe have seen record numbers of Eastern Europeans move west and north\nto earn higher wages than those available in the home country. However, such\nwage differentials do not tell the whole story. For example, wages in Chicago tend\nto be much higher than those in other parts of Illinois, but not everybody leaves\nrural Illinois just because they can earn a higher wage. Wages, though significant,\nonly tell part of the story. Unless you are reading this text in Manhattan or Paris\nor Hong Kong, you could most likely move tomorrow and find a job elsewhere that\npays more than what you earn now (if you are working). Geographers recognize\nthat attachment to place, cultural factors, desire to stay close to family\/friends,\nand other factors play a powerful role in the decision to move or stay.\nAnother pattern that has remained consistent over time is that of highly\nskilled migrants, who tend to enjoy a much greater freedom of movement\nthan those with lower levels of education and fewer skills. For example, computer\nsoftware engineers, database managers, and a host of other highly-demanded skills\nlead to efforts by countries and corporations to attract the best and the brightest\nminds to immigrate in order to bring those skillsets into a country where they\nare in short supply. Countries often offer travel visas (temporary permission to\nenter a country) to those with highly demanded skillsets. Countries like Australia,\nCanada, and New Zealand utilize a points system to determine which of the\nhighly-skilled applicants will be granted permission to enter. The brain drain\nrefers to the conceptual idea that when a wealthy country recruits the \u2018best brains\u2019\nfrom a poorer country, it can be damaging to the sending country, as many of the\nmost qualified and talented groups of people are poached away by higher-paying\nopportunities. As such, the term brain gain refers to the benefits received by\na country that receives all those \u201cbrains\u201d without having to produce them from\nPage | 45 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nscratch! Recently, countries have also acknowledged the concept of brain waste,\nin which receiving countries fall short in utilizing the full range of human\ncapital inherent in many immigrant populations. For example, nearly half of\nall immigrants into the US from 2011-2015 held at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, but\nmore than 2 million immigrants with college degrees continue to work low-skilled\njobs because employers or governments do not recognize foreign-held degrees.\nSimilarly, a brain-drain\/brain-gain phenomenon occurs within some countries,\nsuch as the US. California and New York, for example, continue to draw the most\nhighly-trained and qualified people away from other states. Governments that\nwish to keep the highly skilled at home take such transfers of educated and highly-\nskilled people very seriously.\nFraming migration as a loss or gain, however, also does not tell the whole story.\nMost countries that send migrants also receive them. The US receives large numbers\nof immigrants, but it also is a country of emigration, whereby retirees choose to\nlive outside of the US, or long-term migrants (who usually are US citizens) choose\nto return to their home country in retirement. Migration is neither inherently good\nnor bad; rather, it is complicated. This chapter seeks to tease out some (but not all)\nof the important characteristics of migration in the twenty-first century to help you\ngain a better understanding of a topic that too often is used by politicians to gain\nvotes or credibility. Let us put those simplistic debates aside for a few minutes to\nconsider the basic elements of migration around the world.\n3.3 GLOBAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL\nPATTERNS\n3.3.1 Global Patterns\nThough geopolitical and global economic forces change over time, it is useful\nto understand contemporary global, national, and regional patterns of migration\nas processes that vary by geography. The vast majority of people do not migrate\ninternationally, yet migration makes a powerful impact globally. Just imagine\nwhat our world would look like if nobody ever moved! Latin America would have\nno coconut trees, the American Midwest would still be dominated by buffalos, and\nmost humans would look very much alike\u2014how boring! Instead, migrants across\nthe globe diffuse new ideas, new genetic footprints, new diseases, new cooking\nstyles, and new sports. While a small number of countries receive large numbers\nof newcomers each year, only 3.4 percent of the world\u2019s population live outside\nof their birth country, so most places in the world are not significantly impacted\ndirectly by international migration. However, the dynamics of migration are\nundergoing a significant transformation, and the future is very difficult to predict.\nHumans have been on the move for over 60,000 years, so it is unlikely to come to\na halt anytime soon.\nThe number of international migrants worldwide reached 244 million in 2015,\nrepresenting a 44 percent increase since the year 2000 (Figure 3.1). During the\nPage | 46 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nsame period, global population grew by just Europe 76 million\n20 percent, so cross-border migration seems Asia 75 million\nto be accelerating in many parts of the world North America 54 million\nas more people have access to information, Africa 21 million\ninfrastructure, and communication\u2014all Latin America\/Carribean 9 million\nelements that facilitate the large-scale Oceana 8 million\nmovement of people. In 2015, nearly 70\nFigure 3.1 | Immigrant populations\npercent of all migrants originated in either\naround the world by region\nEurope or Asia, with the largest numbers Authors | Dilip Ratha, Christian Eigen-Zucchi,\ncoming from India, Mexico, Russia, and and Sonia Plaza\nSource | World Bank eLibrary\nChina. Meanwhile, those countries hosting\nLicense | CC BY 3.0 IGO\nthe most immigrants were the US (47\nmillion), followed by Germany (12 million), Russia (12 million), and Saudi Arabia\n(10 million) (Figure 3.2). Generally speaking, migrants tend to move away from\nlow\/middle income countries into high income countries because the most\ncommon driving force is economic opportunity. Most migrants move for better\njobs, higher incomes, and better opportunities overall. It is worth noting, however,\nthat about one third of international migration takes place between lower income\ncountries (e.g. from Bangladesh to India or from Afghanistan to Iran).\nFigure 3.2 | Top countries of immigration by number and percent\nAuthors | Dilip Ratha et al.\nSource | World Bank eLibrary\nLicense | CC BY 3.0 IGO\nIt is also important to note that patterns can change very quickly, depending\nupon economic or political conditions. Spain, for example, was a major recipient of\nimmigrants from 2000-2008, but when its economy dipped and job opportunities\ndecreased, people began to leave en masse. In every year since 2011, more people\nhave left Spain than have arrived. Ireland, on the other hand, experienced mostly\nnet emigration from the mid 1800\u2019s until the late 1990\u2019s, when large numbers\nof Irish and descendants returned \u201chome\u201d and new immigrants began to choose\nPage | 47 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nIreland as a popular destination due to its improved economic opportunities under\nthe European Union.\n3.3.2 Regional Migration Flows: Europe\nFigure 3.3 | Total European immigrant and emigrant populations by country, 2015\nFigure 3.3a (left) Figure 3.3b (right)\nAuthors | OpenStreetMaps and Migration Policy Institute Author | User \u201cSsolbergj\u201d\nSource | Migration Policy Institute Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | ODbL License | CC BY SA 3.0\nConsistent with Ravenstein\u2019s \u201cLaws of Migration,\u201d most international moves\ncontinue to take place across relatively short distances. In no place is this more evident\nthan in Europe, where it also quite common to find Spaniards in France, Germans in\nSwitzerland, Romanians in Germany, etc. As portrayed in the map above, movement\nwithin Europe tends to be from East (blue dots) to West (red\/orange dots) (Figure\n3.3). Given the ease of travel within, the small size of, and short distances between\nmany European countries, it is not surprising that many people move across borders\nfor a variety of reasons. Of the 508 million residents of the European Union (EU),\nabout 10 percent (54 million) are foreign born, of which 35 million originate outside\nof the EU and 19 million moved from one EU country to another. Movement within\nand to the EU has accelerated in recent decades for two reasons. First, Europe has\nintentionally worked towards greater economic integration and cooperation since\nWWII by removing barriers to movement (See more about the EU in Chapter 8).\nCitizens and legal residents of participating EU member states may travel, live,\nstudy, and work seamlessly across national borders under the Schengen Agreement\nPage | 48 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\n(Figure 3.4). While the EU facilitates the free\nmovement of capital, products, and services in\nthe region, the agreement permits the free flow\nof people across international borders without\nsignificant delay, hassle, or regular security checks.\nMillions of working-aged residents of Poland,\nRomania, and Bosnia, for example, have moved\nto countries like Germany, France, and Spain for\nhigher wages. In some ways, the European region\nhas become similar to the US in that Spaniards may\ntravel to France just as easily as Californians may\ntravel to Oregon.\nThe second reason for increased move-\nment and mobility in Europe, however, is that\nmore people from nearby Africa and the Middle\nEast have attempted to enter Europe to seek work,\nescape conflict, or find better educational oppor-\ntunities. Although economic and political life has\nbeen relatively more attractive in Europe than in\nneighboring regions for some time, the forces of\nFigure 3.4 | Schengen Countries\nglobalization have accelerated such flows. Human\n(2017)\nsmuggling organizations transport hopeful mi- Author | User \u201cSsolbergj\u201d\ngrants in exchange for large amounts of money. As Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nsuch, the EU has increased maritime military pa-\ntrols in the region, which has forced human smugglers and would-be immigrants\ninto riskier and more perilous routes. Thousands die each year trying to gain entry\nto another country (Figure 3.5). In 2016, approximately 7,400 died during a mi-\ngration route, and nowhere\nis the trek riskier than in\nthe Mediterranean, where\n4,800 migrants perished in\n2016, most of whom were\nfrom African countries. Ad-\nditionally, conflicts in the\nMiddle East, most notably\nSyria, have driven hundreds\nof thousands to seek refuge\nin Europe.\nThe free flow of people\nacross the European region\nhas come into question in\nFigure 3.5 | Migrant Fatalities in 2017\nAuthor | International Organization for Migration Data Analysis Center recent years as northern\nSource | International Organization for Migration Data Analysis Center member states mistrust the\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 49 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nvetting process put into place by southern and eastern European states. An\nindividual that manages to enter any of the Schengen states can travel quite easily\nto any of the other European states. Denmark and Sweden, for example, have\nincreased border security and border checks in spite of being signatories to the\nagreement (Figure 3.6). The bold experiment in Europe to integrate so many\ncultural, linguistic, and political systems faces constant challenges and has no\nguarantee for long-term success. Twice in the last century, the region was war-\ntorn. As the twentieth century unfolds, Europe remains a focal point for migration\npolicy and practice into the twenty-second century.\nFigure 3.6 | Google News headlines on Danish border control\nSearch Results Screen Capture for terms \u201cDanish border control.\u201d\n6 September 2017.\nAuthor | Google News\nSource | Google News\nLicense | \u00a9 Google. Used with permission.\n3.3.3 Regional Migration Flows: North America\nNorth America represents a special case in that the US routinely receives\nsignificantly more immigrants than any other country in the world. Roughly\n14.5 percent (46 million) of all residents in the US were foreign born in 2015,\nrepresenting seventeen percent of the labor force. In Canada, the numbers\nwere roughly twenty-one percent for both categories. The International\nOrganization for Migration (IOM), sponsored by the United Nations, offers\na great tool for visualizing migration around the world (https:\/\/www.iom.int\/\nworld-migration). Click on the tool to find out how many in the US came from\nChina or how many from the US lived in Mexico last year (hint: toggle the In\/Out\nbutton). Do you notice any patterns? Click on a few other Caribbean countries to\nview the flows of migration into North America. You will notice that the largest\nPage | 50 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nsource areas to the US were Latin America and Asia, but sending countries and\nvolumes, in fact, vary significantly over history. The figure below shows changes\nover time in the US immigrant population, and you can see that immigration from\nLatin America and Asia has only occurred in the most recent period. Do you know\nor think you know when your ancestors arrived? Can you visualize the time period\nduring which they first came to North America? Which population groups are not\nincluded in the chart? Why do you think this might be?\nThere four distinct phases of immigration, but let\u2019s examine each one briefly.\nFirst, during the era of frontier expansion (1820-1880), a rapid westward movement\noccurred. Settlers were given the rare opportunity to acquire large amounts of\ngood farmland in the \u201cNew World,\u201d which pushed people out of the large cities like\nNew York and Boston and towards the American Midwest into the future states of\nOhio, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, etc. Many immigrants came to the US specifically\nin search of land, because population pressure in Europe made land acquisition\nvery difficult. The Homestead Act of 1862 offered up to 160 acres of farmland to\ncitizens or those planning to become citizens as long as they continuously lived on\nand farmed the land for five years. More than 1.5 million claims for land were made\nin subsequent years, resulting in a massive movement of people. It was also during\nthis era that the transcontinental railroad was completed, linking the East Coast\nand West Coast for the first time in a meaningful way. Most immigrants during this\ntime came from England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. More than\n1.5 million also came from Ireland in just a ten-year period (1845-1855) when the\npotato crop failed due to blight (disease), a period known as the Great Hunger. The\nonly significant non-European immigrants arrived as a result of the Burlingame-\nSeward Treaty of 1868, which welcomed Chinese workers, as China also opened\nits borders to American businesses, students, and missionaries. Migration from\nChina was short-lived, however, during the subsequent era.\nPhase 2 (1880-1910) ushered in a dramatic shift as the number of new arrivals\nsoared to unprecedented levels. Moreover, the source countries also changed as\nimmigrants began to arrive from southern and eastern European countries such\nas Italy, Greece, Russia, and Poland. American imagery, stories, legends, books,\nand films tend to focus heavily on this period, because it was the most intense era\nof movement from Europe, and most were arriving via Ellis Island by ship before\nsettling into distinctly ethnic neighborhoods in cities across the US It was also an\nera of massive industrialization that demanded a large source of low-cost workers,\nwhich immigration provided. Coal mines, steel mills, and factories were growing\nat unprecedented levels as the US raced to \u201ccatch up\u201d with the great cities of the\nworld, building bridges, skyscrapers, museums, sports stadiums, and other large\nstructures at unprecedented levels. The period also produced a new era of exclusion\nas the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prohibited immigration, naturalization, and\ncitizenship for anyone of Chinese descent, including those that had immigrated\npreviously under legal means.\nPage | 51 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nDuring Phase 3 (1910-1965), the US dramatically curtailed the number of\nimmigrants permitted to enter the country legally. The great western settlement had\nended, and high birth rates in the US created enough new workers to meet the demand\nof the continued industrialization of the country. A series of new exclusionary laws\nprevented all \u201cAsiatic People\u201d from entering the country, as American nationalism\nfanned by white power and eugenic movements sought to exclude and divide the\npeople of the world into categories of \u201ccivilized,\u201d \u201csavage,\u201d and \u201csemi-civilized.\u201d\nAlso banned were \u201cpolygamists, anarchists, beggars, and importers of prostitutes.\u201d\n(For an excellent graphical overview of US immigration legislation, visit the Pew\nResearch Center website: http:\/\/www.pewhispanic.org\/2015\/09\/28\/selected-u-\ns-immigration-legislation-and-executive-actions-1790-2014). During this period,\nimmigration levels declined precipitously as the country grappled with questions\nof heritage, identity, and cohesion. National legislation was crafted to maintain\nthe racial and ethnic balance of the country as mistrust between nations erupted\nin two world wars. Quotas were established to allow immigration of only a limited\nnumber of people from specific European countries, while all others were kept out.\nEllis Island closed its doors in 1954 after having processed more than 12 million\nimmigrants. However, a dramatic social shift was on the horizon, as the 1960\u2019s\nwould dramatically alter US immigration in the coming decades.\nImmigration into the US in the current era, Phase 4 (1965-Present), is\ncharacterized by (1) enormous growth and (2) a new diversity of source countries,\ndominated by the regions of Asia and Latin America. While the percent of foreign-\nborn residents is similar to that of the early 1900\u2019s, the 47 million (in 2016) living\nin the US represents an unprecedented historical high with one out of every four\nchildren having at least one parent who is an immigrant. The Immigration and\nNaturalization Act of 1965 dramatically shifted the nature of immigration into\nthe US from one with low numbers from a handful of pre-determined countries\nto a system that favors those with particular skills (e.g. scientists, engineers,\nand doctors) and for family reunification. As more Americans entered college,\ndemand for manual labor also grew. Jobs that were once done by children and\nteenagers, such as harvesting crops, cutting grass, or washing dishes in restaurants\nwere increasingly being filled by immigrants willing to work long hours for little\npay. Asian exclusion laws and quotas were abolished, as progressive civil rights\nera provisions took a \u201ccolorblind\u201d approach to welcome those from all regions\nof the world as long as they had the skills and education that would benefit the\nAmerican economy. Laws also made it much easier for existing citizens to legally\nbring immediate relatives from abroad, so that families would not be divided by\nrestrictive immigration policies. Speaking to a sparse crowd in 1965 about the new\nimmigration bill, President Lyndon B. Johnson said, this \u201cis not a revolutionary\nbill. It does not affect the lives of millions . . . It will not reshape the structure of our\ndaily lives or add importantly to either our wealth or our power.\u201d1 Yet in the three\ndecades after its passage, more than 18 million people arrived legally, tripling the\nnumber of immigrants from the previous three decades. The \u201cface\u201d of immigration\nPage | 52 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nchanged dramatically. In 2016, the largest number of foreign born were those from\nMexico, China, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Moreover, immigrants are\nresponsible for 25 percent of all new businesses and more than half of all start-up\ncompanies valued at more than $1 billion. Sometimes, Presidents are wrong.\n3.3.4 Regional Migration Flows: Asia\nMigration within Asia is difficult to summarize given the massive size and scope\nof a region with 4.4 billion people! However, if you revisit the world migration\nmap (https:\/\/www.iom.int\/world-migration ), you will notice that even the largest\ncountries in the world (China and India) contain relatively-few foreign born\npeople compared to those in Europe and North America. Can you think of reasons\nwhy this might be the case? The first explanation is simple. Large-scale human\nsettlement and political development occurred much earlier than in Europe or\nin North America. Early Chinese civilizations had already emerged more than\n5,000 years ago, and many in Asia can trace ancestral lineages back thousands of\nyears as well. As such, Asia (for the most part) wasn\u2019t \u201cdiscovered,\u201d conquered, or\ncolonized during the time of European imperialism. Apart from a small number\nof missionaries, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, Asia did not become a major\ndestination for those from foreign lands (there are several notable exceptions,\nparticularly in the case of the British Empire). Second, most Asian countries\nsimply do not allow for permanent immigration, except in the case of marriage\n(which also can be a very slow and tedious process). Nonetheless, in the age of\nglobalization and migration, more people are on the move in Asia in the twenty-\nfirst century than ever before.\nWith a population of 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy, China tends to\ndominate the East Asia region. The Chinese Diaspora is a term that refers to the\n46 million people that identify themselves as Chinese but live outside of China, with\nthe largest number making their homes in Southeast Asia and others in Australia,\nNorth America, or Europe. Many fled China during times of political instability\nbefore and after WWII and under early communist rule, but today, many of those\nwho leave China are wealthy and educated and do so because their skills are in\ndemand in other parts of the world.\nThe most significant movement of people anywhere in the history of the world\nhas been taking place recently inside both China and India as rural farmers have\nbeen leaving the countryside and moving into cities. Nearly 200 million people\nhave left the interior of China to re-settle and seek work in China\u2019s dynamic cities,\nmostly located along the eastern part of the country. While they do not cross\ninternational borders, the distance and socioeconomic differences between rural\nand urban areas in China are very similar to an international move for many. The\nmotivation is largely economic in that farmers can barely earn a few dollars a day\nin rural areas; new manufacturing jobs in coastal cities pay several times that.\nPage | 53 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\n3.4 DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION, MIGRATION,\nAND POLITICAL POLICY\n3.4.1 What is the relationship between population structure\nand migration?\nEven though people generally migrate to find\/make a better life for themselves\nand for their families, the benefits and pitfalls of migration affect different countries\nand regions in very different ways. Demography (age structure) has a lot to do with\nunderstanding how such a differentiation occurs. (Hint: You may need to go back\nto Chapter 2 to review your understanding of the demographic transition model or\nclick here): http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/schools\/gcsebitesize\/geography\/population\/\npopulation_change_structure_rev4.shtml.\nThe demographic transition model explains how countries experience\ndifferent stages of population growth and family sizes, but the model also works\nwell to understand sources and destinations for migrants. Before the explanation\ncontinues, take a look at the model to see if you can predict the stages during which\nyou would expect large-scale emigration versus immigration. Do you feel confident\nin your guesses? Why or why not?\nGeographers note that countries of emigration tend to be late in stage 2 or early\nstage 3, while countries of immigration tend to be late stage 4 or stage 5 countries.\nLet\u2019s think about this for just a moment. At what age are people most likely to take\nthe risk to move to a completely different country to seek their fortune? Would\nyou move to Slovenia next year, if you could earn triple your current salary? Most\ninternational migrants tend to be relatively young (18-35) during the prime of their\nworking years. Countries that tend to have an abundance of working-age people\nalso tend to be early in stage 3 of the model. Countries like Mexico, Guatemala, the\nPhilippines, and India had large families a generation ago. As those children enter\ntheir working years, there are not enough jobs created due to an \u201coversupply\u201d of\nlaborers. Meanwhile, countries in late stage 4 find that because of low fertility rates\na generation earlier, the economy now faces a shortage of working-age residents to\ndo all kinds of jobs. Birth rates were high during the 1950\u2019s in the US, but as women\nhad fewer children in subsequent generations, fewer workers were entering the\nworkforce every year. Unsurprisingly, young workers from Mexico, El Salvador,\nJamaica, etc., began to immigrate as the demand for their labor increased. In\nEurope, the same pattern occurred as those from higher fertility countries like\nTurkey migrated to lower fertility countries like Germany.\n3.4.2 Why do some countries benefit from migration while\nothers do not?\nDemographic realities can be push factors or pull factors that serve to push\npeople away from a place or pull them towards a place as explained in the previous\nparagraph. Push and pull factors can be cultural, economic, or ecological. Baptists\nPage | 54 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nmight be \u201cpulled\u201d towards the American South, and Mormons might be \u201cpulled\u201d\nto Utah for cultural reasons. Meanwhile, the devastation of Hurricane Maria\n(2017) \u201cpushed\u201d hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans off the island. The most\ncommon destination for Puerto Ricans was Florida for economic (jobs), ecological\n(warm weather), and cultural (existing Spanish speakers) reasons. When the push\nfactors and pull factors fit together nicely, migration can benefit both the sending\nand receiving regions.\nVery often in the case of forced migration, however, migration does not\nbenefit both parties. Those migrants who flee their country based upon claims\nof danger based upon race, religion, nationality, or other pertinent identifiers\nare known as asylum seekers. They seek a country willing to take them in\npermanently for fear of imprisonment, retribution, or death in their country of\norigin. When asylum seekers have satisfactorily demonstrated a claim in court,\ntheir status changes to refugee. Under international agreement, refugees cannot\nbe forced to return to any country where they are deemed to be in danger, so refugee\nstatus provides displaced people with a legal protection against deportation. The\nnumber of refugees worldwide at the end of 2016 was 22.5 million, the highest\ntotal of refugees since the end of WWII. There were also 40.3 million people\nuprooted within their own country, known as internally displaced people\n(IDP), bringing the total number of displaced people to an all-time high of nearly\n63 million. In recent years, large numbers of asylum seekers have left Syria, Iraq,\nAfghanistan, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, Cuba, Venezuela, and Myanmar (formerly\nBurma) as wars and political conflict have endangered millions. During previous\nwars, wealthier countries in Europe, North America, and Australia accepted large\nnumbers of asylum seekers, but anti-immigrant sentiments have risen in many\nparts of the world, leaving the majority of would-be refugees without refuge.\nOpponents of resettlement argue that the cost is just too great, and they fear that\naccepting refugees would encourage more unwelcome immigration in the future,\nso this has significantly reduced the number of migrants that countries are willing\nto accept.\nThough twenty-first century anti-immigrant sentiment remains high in\ncountries like the US, Australia, and the U.K., the benefits for receiving countries\nare well documented. Apart from the demographic advantages already described,\nemployers and consumers tend to benefit markedly from the low-cost, readily-\navailable supply of labor provided by immigrants. Everything from the cost of fruit,\nconstruction, fast food, and lawn care tends to be cheaper owing to an immigrant\nlabor force. Evidence also indicates that wages in low-skilled jobs may be suppressed\nby immigrants, but the overall economic benefit is widely reported by economists\nto be favorable when unemployment rates are low. Immigrants have higher rates\nof employment, are more likely to start businesses and are less likely to commit\ncrimes than the native-born population in the US Sending countries also tend to\nbenefit from emigration in two ways. First, emigration provides an opportunity for\nyoung workers who cannot find employment at home. Second, emigrants tend to\nPage | 55 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nsend home the majority of their overseas earnings. Money sent home by overseas\nworkers is called remittances. Countries that send large numbers of workers\noverseas benefit from the large infusion of foreign capital into the local economy,\nwhich tends to spur new investment opportunities. When migration is working\nsmoothly, both sending and receiving countries can benefit.\nBesides low-skilled workers and refugees, a third category of immigrant has\nincreased dramatically under globalization. Highly-skilled immigrants represent a\nunique contradiction. On the one hand, countries seek to increase border security,\nlimit asylum seekers, and build walls. On the other, those same countries actively\nrecruit and seek to attract immigrants with specific skills, training, and educational\nlevels. Most commonly, wealthy countries like the U.K. regularly recruit nurses,\nscientists, and engineers from poorer countries to meet the needs of an aging\npopulation. As British residents have fewer children and society gets older, there is\nmore demand specifically for healthcare workers of all kinds. As such, the best and\nbrightest minds from poorer countries become attracted to the much higher wages\noutside of their countries and they leave\u2014resulting in a brain drain. Nearly sixty\npercent of all doctors born in Ghana and eighty-five percent of nurses born in the\nPhilippines have left the country to work elsewhere! Wealthy countries reap the\nbenefits of this brain gain. Although highly-skilled and educated individuals and\nfamilies that emigrate for higher pay undoubtedly benefit from emigration, the\ncountries that experience brain drain persistently lose a very valuable resource.\nBesides losing most of its doctors, Ghana also now faces a major shortage of those\nqualified to teach the next generation of medical professionals, so the negative\neffect crosses multiple generations.\n3.5 CULTURE, GLOBALIZATION, AND ECONOMICS\nOF MIGRATION IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY\n3.5.1 What is the connection between globalization and\nincreased international migration?\nGlobalization is defined as the set of forces and processes that involve the\nentire planet, making something worldwide in scope. Although 246 million people\nlive outside of their birth country, more than 96 percent of the world\u2019s people do not\never move outside of their birth country, so in the case of migration, globalization\nmight not be as powerful as once believed. While geographers try to understand\nwhere people move and why, a more significant question might be why so many\npeople do not move. If you live in one of the places on Earth where you interact\nwith people from all over the globe on a regular basis, then it might seem to you that\nglobalization is operating at full speed. Yet, the vast majority of humans don\u2019t leave\ntheir home country and have limited interactions with people from other places,\neven if the products they consume and produce might be worldwide in scope.\nAs we entered the new millennium in 2000, scholars were convinced that a\nnew age was upon us. Some went so far as to say that geography was \u201cdead\u201d and\nPage | 56 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nthat place didn\u2019t matter. A best-selling book written by Thomas Friedman, The\nWorld Is Flat (2005), decreed that humanity was becoming more connected all the\ntime to the point that it didn\u2019t matter if you were in the streets of Bombay or in a\nclassroom at Harvard. The best minds and the best ideas would always rise to the\ntop, regardless of their origin. Inherent in this argument was the assumption that\nmore people would be on the move, and international migration would accelerate\nas people and products would just zoom across the \u201cflat earth\u201d at lightning speed.\nIn 2017, however, geography has re-emerged to re-stake its claim. While\nmore people than ever are, in fact, living outside of their birth countries, there is\na growing resistance across the planet to \u201coutsiders.\u201d In response to the attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001, President George W. Bush firmly asserted that \u201cevery nation\nin every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with\nthe terrorists.\u201d Perhaps that is the moment in which the earlier hope of a fully-\nintegrated world with open borders and full mobility was deemed too optimistic.\nIn the years since that speech, western nations have taken a collective stance\nagainst immigration often based upon religious or ideological grounds. In 2017,\nfor example, Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\nentering the United States\u201d in response to a shooting in San Bernadino, California.\nMeanwhile, Britain moved to cut immigration levels dramatically as it exited the\nEuropean Union and took a more isolationist position, and Australia moved to\nprevent refugees from arriving on its shores.\n3.5.2 How is migration in the twenty-first century different\nfrom that of the twentieth century?\nWhile the percent of those who migrate has not increased significantly in\nthe twenty-first century, the destinations and origins of immigrants have shifted\ndramatically, so that more people are migrating to and from more places than\never before. Such a statement may sound confusing at first, but one need look\nno further than college campuses throughout the world to understand this\ndynamic. Georgia Gwinnett College in suburban Atlanta, for example, is the\nmost ethnically-diverse college in the American South. In a typical geography\nclass at that school, thirty-three percent speak a language other than English at\nhome. A recent survey of the author\u2019s students (n=115) from just one semester\nfound that students (or their families) came from Mexico, El Salvador, Peru, the\nPhilippines, Laos, China, Colombia, Korea, Haiti, Jamaica, Vietnam, Ukraine,\nDominican Republic, Liberia, Latvia, Romania, India, Pakistan, Scotland, and\nParaguay. While past waves of migration were dominated by a small number of\nsending countries and a small number of receiving countries, migration in the\ntwenty-first century is much less predictable.\nAustralia offers another example, as thousands of prospective immigrants\nhave been traveling thousands of miles by land and sea to seek refuge in the small\ncontinent. The government eventually made the difficult decision to intercept\nwould-be immigrants at sea, but it still faces a complex dilemma of where to\nPage | 57 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nredirect those who have risked their lives to make the perilous journey. For now,\nthey are being taken to remote islands of Papua New Guinea, Christmas Island,\nand Nauru for resettlement, resulting in an odd mix of refugees and South Pacific\nIslanders living side by side. Unpredictability is now the rule rather than the\nexception as twenty-first century technology allows for a rapid flow of information.\nThose wishing to move can now find out much more quickly about opportunities,\ntransportation options, and routes to take than has ever been the case before.\nGeography does not represent nearly as formidable of a barrier to travel than it\ndid in the twentieth century. Other than asylum seekers, most immigrants are far\nmore likely to travel by plane than by boat in the twenty-firs century, and they may\nor may not seek permanent residence.\nThe final way in which migration is different today relates to the concept of\ntransnationalism (exchanges and interactions across borders that are a regular\nand sustained part of migrants\u2019 realities and activities that transcend a purely\n\u201cnational\u201d space). Those traveling to the US in 1900 were leaving everything behind\nto seek a new homeland, learn a new culture, and often to speak a new language.\nMigrants of today, however, are not forced to fully disconnect from \u201chome.\u201d Even\nafter a long-distance migration, people can stay connected to friends, family, news\nstories, and relationships across the world. A journey that took several months in\n1900 today takes less than half a day. Meanwhile, apps like Facebook, WhatsApp,\nSnapchat, and Skype allow newcomers to stay intimately involved in the lives of\nthose left behind\u2014for free! Transnational families contain members that are\nliving in multiple countries simultaneously, speak multiple languages, and are\nready to move in a moment\u2019s notice, based upon market conditions in any given\nplace at a particular time. Critics argue that immigrants of today do not assimilate\nas readily as those from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but in that era,\npeople simply had no other choice. Transnationalism is a feature of twenty-first\ncentury immigrants that is here to stay as immigrants to new places have the option\nto live their lives in more than one world, carry more than one passport, and move\nmore seamlessly from place to place than at any time in human history. Take note\nthat the term appears again in this textbook (section 11.4, Political Geography) in\nthat corporations also operate within and between multiple countries, depending\nupon various factors. An important distinction exists, however, from the concept\nof supranationalism (Section 8.3, Political Geography) in that supranationalist\norganizations do not officially reside under the direction of any single state\n(country), while transnationalism involves moving between countries \u2013 not\noperating outside of them.\n3.6 THE FUTURE OF HUMAN MOVEMENT AND\nCONCLUSION\nThe future dynamics of migration are very difficult to predict, but certain\ngeographic realities provide clues for where patterns are likely to change. In those\nPage | 58 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nparts of the world where societies are quickly aging and fertility rates continue to\ndecline, we can expect rates of immigration to increase. Certain countries have\nexperienced and will continue to experience dramatic population decline (most\nnotably Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan), and the demand for young, working-\naged immigrants will certainly continue to draw more people to those places.\nJapan and China represent unique cases because both are aging and yet have\nbeen resistant to allowing outsiders to become citizens or permanent residents. In\nspite of cultural preferences for ethnic homogeneity, it would seem likely that the\nculture will shift and become more accepting of outsiders, as the country needs\nthem to take care of the elderly, pay taxes, and provide an infusion of energy into\nthe respective countries.\nMeanwhile, people living in places without sufficient opportunities will continue\nto move away in search of jobs and better circumstances, regardless of the attempts\nmade by wealthy nations to keep them out. Source countries and destinations will\ncontinue to shift, as they always have. More Mexicans have returned than have left\nthe US in recent years, and it is no longer the leading sending source country of\nmigration to the US. Rather, more people are now coming from Central America.\nThe demographic pressures in many African countries will absolutely drive more\nworking-aged people out of the continent in search of better opportunities even as the\njourney becomes increasingly dangerous. As the Internet becomes more pervasive\non that continent, more people will find the information that they need in order to\nplan their emigration. Finally, the highly-skilled people of the world will continue\nto be increasingly mobile and largely unaffected by borders or increased security.\nComputer programmers, nurses, doctors, engineers, and high-tech workers of all\nsorts will use the globe to their advantage and seek out places that best fit their\ndesires. Television shows like \u201cHouse Hunters International\u201d demonstrate how the\nvast numbers of people who work online or in highly-skilled careers can virtually\nlive anywhere. Wealthy people from across the globe are leaving their passport\ncountries by the millions, as Wi-Fi networks are now available across the world.\nThe poor and wealthy alike will continue to move about the planet, reconstituting\nthe human geography of our world well into the twenty-first century but for very\ndifferent reasons and with very different experiences.\n3.7 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAsylum seeker \u2013 those who leave the sovereign territory of one country in order to\nachieve refugee status in another, based upon claims of danger because of race,\nreligion, nationality, or other pertinent identifiers.\nBrain drain \u2013 the collective loss of skills, education, training, and wealth that occurs\nwhen highly-skilled and educated people move away from a country (usually away\nfrom a relatively poor country).\nBrain gain \u2013 the collective gain of skills, education, training, and wealth that occurs\nwhen highly-skilled and educated people move into another country (usually to a\nrelatively wealthier country).\nPage | 59 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY MIGRATION\nBrain waste \u2013 a phenomenon in which international migrants with high levels of\neducation and\/or training often are not eligible to work in their area of training\ndue to regulations or certification requirements, resulting in a \u201cwasted\u201d potential\nin certain groups.\nDiaspora \u2013 a group of people sharing a common historical and ethnic connection to a\nterritory, but who no longer live in that territory or country.

When some people speak of culture, they are thinking of high\nculture (e.g. ballet or opera). Others may think of current, prominent topics (i.e.\npop culture). Academic settings, though, are referring to something else. Culture\nis a learned behavior and a human construct. Culture exists to answer questions.\nSome of the questions that are answered are philosophical or ideological, for\nexample, \u201cWhere did we come from?\u201d or \u201cWhat is acceptable behavior?\u201d Other\nquestions revolve around daily life. \u201cHow do we secure shelter, clothe ourselves,\nproduce food, and transmit information?\u201d Culture provides us with guidance for\nour lives. It both asks and answers questions. Children, from an early age, start\nasking \u201cWhat is my place in the world?\u201d Culture helps to answer that.\nThe word culture itself comes the Latin word cultura, meaning cultivation or\ngrowing. This is precisely what humans do with both their material and abstract\ncultural components. Humans, since early childhood, learn to shape, create, share,\nand change their culture. Culture is the very vehicle we use to navigate through our\nenvironments. Culture is a form of communication and it evolves. And as a type of\ncompass, it leads.\n4.1.1 Components of Culture\nAt the most simplistic levels, culture can be either concrete and tangible, or\nabstract. Either way, culture is used to express identity for both individuals and\ngroups. And whether it is concrete or abstract, again it is a human construct used as\na way to create a sense of belonging. People convey culture through various outlets\nsuch as festivals, food, and architecture. They are able to meet their worldwide\nfundamental needs while maintaining individual group qualities. Culture can be\nclassified into three different categories: mentifacts (ideas or beliefs), artifacts\n(goods or technology), and sociofacts (forms of social organization).\nAll cultures have underlying beliefs and thought processes. These beliefs\ninclude religion (Chapter 6) and language (Chapter 5) but go far beyond that.\nOther important beliefs include things like nationalism (see Chapter 8), customs or\nprejudices. These beliefs can be expressed through various avenues, using a variety\nof auditory, visual, and tactile means. For example, nationalism can be expressed\nthrough song, cuisine, dress, and public events. You can hear nationalism in the\nform of an anthem, see it in the form of a flag, taste it when you eat a dish that\nrepresents a group of people, and feel it in the form of a piece of jewelry.\nTechnology is a human construct. From our earliest inventions (fire, weapons)\nto a supercomputer, the things that people build are products of their perceived\nneeds, their technical abilities and their available resources. Technology includes\nclothing, foods and housing. Another name for technology is material culture.\nThink of material culture as the material that archaeologists study. The materials\nthat we use are often left behind for later people to study, like the clay tablets the\nSumerians used to record their writing or the remnants of an Iroquois longhouse\nPage | 66 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nused for shared living. Other components of culture (like ideas) leave fewer traces.\nWe can find material culture related to burial practices that date back millennia\nbut may not always have the material evidence to show how people grieve.\nLifestyle is a component of culture that can be overlooked, but it is vitally\nimportant. In many cultures, a family is a very large unit and people can tell in\ngreat detail their exact relationship to everyone else in a place. In the modern\ncontext, a family could consist of a single parent and a child and it is possible to\nlive in a neighborhood filled with unrelated people and not know the name of a\nsingle neighbor.\nCulture can be seen either through the lens of a microscope or through that of a\ntelescope. Folk culture is local, small and tightly bound to the immediate landscape.\nPopular culture is large, dispersed, and globalizing. These two forms of culture are\nnot totally separated. They are related and both currently exist in the world. Prior\nto about 2008, most people on Earth lived in rural communities, often practicing a\nfolk culture. The world as a whole is moving toward popular culture.\n4.1.2 Cultural Reproduction\nAs human beings, we reproduce in two ways: biologically and socially. Physically\nwe reproduce ourselves through having children. However, culture consists solely\nof learned behavior. In order for culture to reproduce itself, it has to be taught. This\nis what makes culture a human creation. How is culture transmitted? Human beings\nare natural mimics. This is the way we learn to speak, and it is the way we learn\nthe rest of our culture as well. We learn through observation and, subsequently,\nthrough practice. At another scale, mimicry is the mechanism that drives cultural\ndiffusion. Human beings copy the things we like. The old line \u201cImitation is the\nsincerest form of flattery,\u201d perfectly describes the human desire to incorporate\nsuccessful adaptations.\nFigure 4.2 | Ribs restaurant in Madrid, Spain Figure 4.3 | Spanish restaurant in Tivoli Gardens,\nThis restaurant is near one of the busiest tourist areas in the city, but it is on Copenhagen, Denmark\na side-street off the iconic Gran V\u00eda.

This can\npartly be attributed to the channels in which we share culture. In the past, culture\nwas shared orally and in person. Words eventually became written, the written\nbecame electronic, and we now have access to things from anywhere at any time.\nThe debate over authenticity has also become a topic of debate. If culture is\ncreated, recreated, and is fluid, how can we define authenticity? Has culture become\nplaceless? Placelessness or the irrelevance of place has become a central topic\nin the contemporary philosophy of geography. Can people have an All-American\ndining experience in the heart of Madrid, Spain? Can they experience Spanish\nstreet-food at a historic theme park in Copenhagen, Denmark? As the following\npictures show, icons representing other places are now common in the landscape.\n4.1.3 Culture Hearths\nFigure 4.4 | Depicts culture hearths and their associated rivers, where applicable1\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nHuman beings have always had learned behaviors, it\u2019s one of the defining\ncharacteristics of human beings. Cultural evolution describes the increasing\ncomplexity of human societies over time. Our earliest cultures were simple. We\nlived in small groups, ranged across fairly large areas, and lived off the natural\nlandscape. Human impact on the environment is less than it is now, but there\nwas an impact. Earlier peoples burned forests to clear land and flush game, and in\nsome places hunted the megafauna to extinction.\nRecognizable cultures have places of origin. The word culture refers to\ncultivation or growing. We care for something, we nurture an idea as it grows. All\nPage | 68 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\ncultural elements have a place of origin. Some places have been responsible for a\ngreat deal of cultural development. We call these places culture hearths. Culture\nhearths provided many of the cultural elements (technologies, organizational\nstructures, and ideologies) that would diffuse to other places and later times.\nCultural hearths provide operational scripts for societies.\nCulture hearths are closely associated with the foods that they domesticated.\nfood is an important cultural element due to the fact that it is both a technology\nas well as form of expression. Although the preceding map shows areas of ancient\ncivilization, these are not the only places that have contributed to contemporary\ncultures. Ideas can arise anywhere, but ancient ideas collected in these places.\nCultures incorporate pieces of other cultures. Some recognizable themes in\ncreation myths are stories of great floods or other cataclysmic events, and these\ntypes of stories recycled through history. Languages without writing will often reuse\nanother language\u2019s writing system. Once again, desirable characteristics get copied.\n4.2 THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE\nCultures\u2019 beings rely on natural resources to survive. In the case of rural\ncultures, those resources tend to be local. For urban cultures, those resources can\neither be local, or they can be products brought from great distances. Either way,\ncultures influence landscapes and in turn landscapes influence cultures.\nFigure 4.5 | Culture-Landscape Relationship\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nThe physical landscape consists of places like the Appalachian Mountains\nthat stretch across a large portion of North America, the Mongolian-Manchurian\ngrasslands, the Amazon river basin, or any other environment. These are landscapes\nthat have been formed over thousands, if not millions of years by forces of nature.\nIn order to live in places a different as these, humans have needed to adapt their\nlifestyles. The relationship between people, their culture, and the physical landscape\nis known as human-environment interaction. This relationship is reciprocal;\nculture adapts to a particular place, and that place is changed by people. Cultural\necology refers to the types of landscapes created by the interaction of people and\ntheir physical environment.\nHumans have been thinking about the relationship between people and their\nenvironments for a considerable amount of recorded history. In the book On\nPage | 69 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nAirs, Waters, and Places, the Greek philosopher Hippocrates wrote that different\nclimates produced different kinds of people. He believed that cold places produced\nemotionally distant people, and hot climates produced lazy, lethargic people. The\nideal place (which coincidentally was his own place) was in the middle of the known\nworld and produced the best kind of people. These ideas would now be considered\nenvironmentally deterministic. Remember that Environmental determinism is\nthe idea that a particular landscape necessarily produces a certain kind of people.\nIdeas like this were still fashionable into the twentieth century. The problem with\nthe idea is that it\u2019s simplistic and reductionist. A cold environment doesn\u2019t force\npeople to be aloof. It forces them to invent warmer clothes. Technology is the\ndifference, not behavior. Instead of determinism, the more common term to use\nis now possibilism. Physical landscapes set limits on a group of people that may\nor may not require a large adaptation, or a large modification of the environment\nitself. Humans can now survive in very inhospitable environments, most notably,\nthe International Space Station.\nLandscapes are cultural byproducts. The way that we use the local resources\ngenerates the visible landscape. Architecture, economic activities, clothing and\nentertainment are all visible to anyone interested in looking at a place. Because\nthe physical landscape varies across space,\nand because culture varies across space,\nthen the cultural landscape is variable as\nwell. Different people can have different\nadaptations to similar places. Conversely,\nplaces far from one another may have similar\nadaptations to climate or other factors.\nCultural landscapes can be considered\nas both history and narrative. Power is\nwritten into the landscape. We make statues\nto commemorate the wealthy and the\npolitically connected in rich places. We place\ngarbage dumps and airports in poor places.\nLooking at the landscape as a record of\nhistory, power, and representation is known\nas landscape-as-text. The landscape can be\nread in the same that a book can be read.\nThe largest differences between land-\nscapes that we see now are the differences\nbetween the rural and the industrial and Figure 4.6 | Helen, Georgia\nWhat is the narrative here? How have people\nbetween places that are less integrated with\nchanged\/adapted the mountainous landscape of\nthe rest of the world and those that are heav- this region of Georgia, USA, to look like a town in\nily integrated (globalized). Global places are mountainous Bavaria, Germany?\nAuthor | Dominica Ram\u00edrez\nbecoming homogenized.\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 70 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nCultural Change\nA sensible question to ask might be \u201cWhere did all the cultures come from?\u201d As\npeople moved into new places, they adapted and changed, and the new places were\nchanged in turn. People change over time as well. Circumstances change in a place.\nGroups who move into a forest will need a to adapt if they cut down all the trees.\nGroups that adopt a new crop will see their lives change. Divergence could be as\nsimple as borrowing a word to describe an invention. All cultures change.\nCulture Regions\nWe can sort the world into regions based on cultural characteristics. A region\nis an area characterized by similarity or a cohesiveness that sets it apart from other\nregions. Regions are mental constructs, the lines between places are imaginary.\nWhen someone talks about the English-speaking world or Latin America, they are\nreferring to culture regions.\n4.2.1 Cultural Case Study: The Diffusion of Dancehall\nA cultural attribute could diffuse just about anywhere, but that isn\u2019t how\ndiffusion usually works. Some places are interested in the innovation (new thing)\nand some are not. The following example takes one narrowly defined cultural\nattribute and traces a path to other places. Dancehall, a form of reggae, developed\nin Jamaica in the late 1970s and grew over time to prominence on the island. On\nof Jamaica\u2019s main exports is music and Dancehall became an exported commodity\nlike many other musical forms. In the case of Dancehall, the music is sufficiently\ndefined to allow us to see where it has diffused to. Large markets like North\nAmerica are visible to us and we see Dancehall in some of the music of Drake or\nRihanna, but other places may seem less obvious. In Brazil, artists such as Lai\nDi Dai has taken the genre and adapted it to local tastes (which may or may not\ninclude changing the language of delivery).\nFigure 4.7 | Lai Di Dai\nfrom the video for \u201cChega na Dan\u00e7a\u201d\nAuthor | Lai Di Dai\nSource | YouTube\nLicense | Fair Use\nPage | 71 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nIn Germany, the band Seeed has found great success with Dancehall.\nAnd in Denmark we find artists like Raske Penge.\nFigure 4.8 | Seeed Figure 4.9 | Raske Penge\nfrom the live video \u201cLive 2013 (Berlin + M\u00f6nchengladbach)\u201d from the video \u201cOriginal Bang Ding\u201d\nAuthor | Seeed Author | Raske Penge\nSource | YouTube Source | YouTube\nLicense | Fair Use License | Fair Use\nThis musical style has moved far beyond its origin. Similar diffusion is found\nwith other musical genres, from the earliest forms of pop music through to the\npresent day.\n4.3 FOLK CULTURE\nThe term folk tends to evoke images of what we perceive to me traditional\ncostumes, dances, and music. It seems that anything with the prefix folk refers to\nsomething that somehow belongs in the past and that is relegated to festivals and\nmuseums. The word folk can be traced back to Old Norse\/English\/Germanic and was\nused to refer to an army, a clan, or a group of people. Using this historic information,\nfolk culture (folktales, folklore, etc.) can be understood as something that is shared\nfirst among a group of people and then with the more general population. It is a\nform of identification. Folk is ultimately tied to an original landscape\/geographic\nlocation as well. Folk cultures are found in small, homogeneous groups. Because of\nthis, folk culture is stable through time, but highly variable across space.\nFolk customs originate in the distant past and change slowly over time. Folk\ncultures move across space by relocation diffusion, as groups move they bring their\ncultural items, as well as their ideas with them.\nFolk culture is transmitted or diffused in person. Knowledge is transmitted\neither by speaking to others, or through participating in an activity until it has been\nmastered. Cooking food is taught by helping others until an individual is ready to\nstart cooking. Building a house is learned through participating in the construction\nof houses. In all cases, folk cultures must learn to use the resources that are locally\navailable. Over time folk cultures learn functional ways to meet daily needs as well\nas satisfy desires for meaning and entertainment. Folk cultures produce distinctive\nways to address problems.\nPage | 72 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nHouses tend to be similar within a culture area, since once a functional\nhouse type is developed, there is little incentive to experiment with something\nthat may not work. Food must be grown or gathered locally. People prefer variety,\nso they produce many crops, plus relying on only a few foods is dangerous. Clothing\nis made from local wool, flax, hides, or other materials immediately available. Local\nplants serve as the basis of folk medicinal systems. People are entertained by music\nthat reinforces folk beliefs and mythologies, as well as reflects daily life. Folktales\nor folklore exists as foundational myths, origin stories or cautionary tales.\nHolidays provide another form of entertainment. Special days break the\nmonotony of daily life. A holiday such as Mardi Gras, which has its roots in the\nCatholic calendar provides an occasion to flout cultural norms and relieve tension.\nAnother way of providing escape from monotony is provided by intoxicants.\nAlthough often not considered when discussing culture, human beings have been\naltering their own mental states for millennia. The production of alcohol, cannabis,\ntobacco or coca demonstrates that folk cultures understood the properties of\npsychoactive substances. Later these substances would be commercialized into\nmodern products.\nAs folk cultures have receded there has been a return to valuing the folk. The\nSlow-food movement and the growth of cultural tourism has largely been driven\nfor the desire experience elements of folk culture. As early as the German Grimm\nBrothers (19th Century Germany) people have wanted to preserve and promote\nfolk culture. John Lomax (1867-1948) traveled the United States trying to record\nas many folk songs and folk tales (including slave narratives) as they faded from\nhuman memory.\nFolk culture can also be expressed as craftsmanship versus factory work. Hand\nproduction of goods requires a great amount of knowledge to select materials,\nfabricate components, assemble and finish a product. Contrast this with industrial\nproduction in workers need to know very little about the final product, and have\nlittle relationship with it. This difference in modes of production was first discussed\nby Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies and Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. These two words denote\nthe relationship between people and their communities, and by extension, their\nlandscapes. Gesellschaft is the way life is lived in a small community. Gemeinschaft\nis the way that life is lived in a larger society.\n4.4 THE CHANGING CULTURAL LANDSCAPE\nIt is understood that folk culture has been declining in the face of popular\nculture for some time. What is driving this decline? There are many things, with\ndifferent underlying processes. Politically, in the last few centuries many places\nhave been incorporated into states. These states have often pursued nationalistic\npolicies that made life difficult for minorities of nearly every variety. The growth of\na state-sanctioned national culture is the beginning of popular culture. Something\nas innocuous as public schooling or an official language can serve as a vehicle for\nPage | 73 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\npromoting national values. Even if there is some overlap between the old culture\nand the new, the old has been prised loose from its central position in communal life.\nEconomics also plays a role. Small, rural communities have been shrinking\nglobally for centuries, since the beginning of the Industrial revolution. Leaving the\nspatial confines of a folk culture makes reproducing that culture very difficult, due\nto its close connection to place. When people migrate to places practicing popular\ncultures, the pressure to acculturate and assimilate are tremendous.\nChanges in infrastructure has also aided the diffusion of popular culture.\nRoads bring in outside people, as well as reduce the friction of leaving a place. The\ninternet has dramatically reduced the friction of distance regarding the diffusion of\npopular culture. It took decades for tomatoes to diffuse from the Americas to Italy,\nbut we know about a new iPhone months before it even gets released.\nThe United States is huge laboratory of cultural interchange. Innumerable\ndistinctive folk cultures were already in the Americas when the Europeans arrived.\nWaves of people from folk cultures arrived for decades, and they changed the larger\nculture of the United States.\nPlaces of folk culture aren\u2019t the only places that are changing. Many places\nwith an established popular culture are subject to interaction between different\npop culture spheres. At one time immigrants to the United States came from folk\ncultures. Now they are often from areas of popular culture. The Spanish-speaking\nworld has its own pop music stars, and chart-topping musicians from different\ncountries will often collaborate together garnering airplay and sales around the\nworld. World regional cuisines are subject to becoming fads as well.\n4.5 POPULAR CULTURE\nPopular culture is culture that is bought. Think about your daily life. You\nwork to buy food and clothing, pay your rent, and entertain yourself. The origin\nof each ingredient in your food could be hundreds or even thousands of miles in\neither direction. Your clothing almost certainly wasn\u2019t made locally, or even in this\ncountry. Your house might look just like any house in any subdivision in North\nAmerica, placeless and with little connection to local resources.\nPopular culture is driven by marketing. Entire industries exist to convince us\nthat our desires and needs will be best met through shopping. Why is this? Because\nwithout sales, the companies that produce pop culture will go bankrupt.\nPopular culture industries must continuously reinvent themselves. Being\npopular today is not a guarantee of longevity. In order to convince consumers that\nlast year\u2019s t-shirt is now unacceptable, it is necessary to promote fashion. Fashion\nis not just a concept related to clothing. It is the reason that automobile companies\nmake cosmetic changes to their products every year. It is why fast food restaurants\ncontinually change some parts of their menus. Without the cachet of fashion,\nconsumers may feel socially disadvantaged. This explains why some people with\nvery limited incomes will spend money on expensive luxuries.\nPage | 74 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nIn terms of popular culture holidays are simply reasons to sell merchandise. The\ncommercialization of Christmas has been increasing for over a century in western\ncountries. Now it is possible to see Christmas displays in Japan or China, places\nwith few Christians, but many available consumers. The same sort of marketing\ncan be seen in the expansion of Halloween globally, and in the growth of Cinco de\nMayo in the United States.\nHierarchical diffusion plays prominently in popular culture diffusion. Larger\nplaces tend to generate many of pop culture\u2019s hit songs, clothing styles, and food\ntrends. Diffusion in popular culture is highly related to technology. Although\nit wasn\u2019t invented as such, the internet has become a venue for advertisement.\nClickbait headlines and ad revenue have created an atmosphere where every\nconversation is a sales pitch.\nThis hierarchical diffusion means that innovations tend to diffuse from large,\nwell-connected places to other large-well-connected places first, then trickle-down\nto smaller and smaller places. The gap in time that it takes for a new idea or product\nis known as cultural lag. In some places, there is almost no cultural lag. To very\nremote places, some innovations take a very long time to arrive. Bear in mind that\nthere are places in the United states that still have no internet service.\nPopular culture covers large populations with access to similar goods and\nservices, but the pressing need to sell drives almost incessant modification,\ngenerally at a superficial level. Because of this we usually describe pop culture as\nstable across space, but highly variable across time.\nFigure 4.10 | Fast Food Restaurant\nWhere is this fast food restaurant?

Low alcohol beers have a minimal effect on the human\nbody compared to commercial distilled spirits. The opium poppy, dangerous\nenough in its raw form, can be processed into heroin. The same can be said of coca\n(now used to produce cocaine) or tobacco. In folk form, these substances tended\nPage | 75 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nto be used for ritual purposes. In the context of popular culture, they are used in\ngreat quantity. Nevertheless, old folk patterns are still visible in the pop culture\nlandscape. Italians still drink wine, a product they have produced for centuries,\nonly now it might be bought from somewhere else. The Russian climate was good\nfor producing grain and potatoes, which eventually was distilled into vodka.\nSelling culture goes well beyond just food and clothing. Popular music and other\nforms of entertainment (video games, movies, etc.) are huge commercial entities\nmarketing products well outside their places of origin. Movies made in the United States\nare often being made with the understanding that their international box office sales\nwill be larger than their domestic sales. This is also true of other mass media products.\nThese products are often related to other pop culture products. Companies rely on the\nfamiliarity consumers will have with a movie character in order to sell clothing, toys,\nvideo games, conventions and more movies in that series. When Marshall McLuhan\nwrote that \u201cThe medium is the message\u201d he meant that television would be able to sell\nitself. The same expression could be expanded to pop culture in general.\nThe following graphic shows the top ten music charts for the week of September\n10-16, 2017.

As long as a product can be sold, it can\nsurvive in the marketplace. This brings up an interesting process. Commodification\nis the process in which a cultural attribute is changed into a mass-market product.\nBear in mind that the mass-market product may not resemble the original product\nvery much. Using a similar fast-food model as McDonald\u2019s, Taco Bell sells ostensibly\nMexican products across the world with the notable exception of Mexico. Panda\nExpress is similar for Chinese food. These chains are not in the business of making\nhamburgers, tacos, or orange chicken. They are in the business of making a profit.\nAuthenticity is irrelevant, and probably harmful in the drive to sell more.\nThe reverse of this process also applies. One aspect of marketing is the\nincorporation of global products into the local market. Companies will change their\nproducts or their entire product lines, if doing so is cost-effective and generates a\ngood return on investment. There is even a Central America-based fried chicken\nchain in the United States. Brands like Sony and Hyundai are highly visible in the\nAmerican landscape. K-Pop bands tour suburban arenas that also host Celine Dion\nand Paul McCartney.\n4.7 GLOBAL CULTURE\nGlobalization is the integration of the entire world into a single economic unit.\nThis is associated with frictionless movement of money, ideas, and (to a lesser\nextent) people. This growing reality has created a newer type of popular culture,\nglobal culture.\nHistorically, popular culture was restricted to areas the size of States, or at\nthe very most areas within culturally related spheres (e.g. the English-speaking\nworld). United States culture was defined by a set of characteristics (language, law,\nsettler colonial history, etc.) that translated to a few other places, such as Canada\nor Australia, but mostly remained place bound. This is no longer the case. As was\nmentioned previously, video games are designed in one country to appeal to a\nglobal market. The same is true of music, movies, clothes, smartphones and office\nproductivity software.\nAt a superficial level at least, the components of life are becoming more\nhomogeneous across large parts of the world. National popular culture producers are\nmerging into international producers, and these international producers have global\nambitions. Any sizable popular culture content distributor (EMI Records, Sony,\nVivendi Universal, AOL Time Warner and BMG) is a transnational corporation. In\nfact, the five listed global record labels account for 90% of global music sales.\nStarbucks, Toyota, Wyndham and others have helped reduce the friction of\ndistance by reducing spatial variation. They aren\u2019t doing this to help people, or to\nhurt them. Although they will cater to local needs to some degree, they are not in\nthe business of promoting local flavors.\nPage | 77 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nWilliam Gibson wrote \u201cThe future is already here, it\u2019s just not evenly\ndistributed.\u201d In terms of globalization, he was correct. There are still people living\nin remote areas practicing something similar to a paleolithic lifestyle. On the other\nend of the scale there are people with great wealth who have access to powerful\ntechnologies and are able to live anywhere they desire.\nSometimes globalization even has an effect on folk culture. In many places,\neconomic realities have forced people to perform religious activities of relive\nspecial events for tourist dollars. Attending luaus in Hawaii or watching voladores\nin Veracruz in a quest for authenticity is in itself changing the folk culture that is\nthe center of attention.\nThis assessment may seem particularly bleak for folk culture, but it isn\u2019t\nnecessarily completely bad. People survive, and they try to keep the practices that\nare most valuable to their lives. Folk cultures have a much longer timeline than\npop cultures, and have proven to be resilient.\n4.8 RESISTANCE TO POPULAR CULTURE\nAlthough popular culture has been expanding rapidly at the expense of folk\nculture, it is not without resistance. Although it is not strictly-speaking true, global\nculture is perceived as largely corporate, secular, and western. Each of these aspects\nhave their own critics.\nAnti-globalists fall into two main groups. The first are leftists who oppose the\npower that has accumulated to corporations and the authoritarian state. The other\ngroup are rightists who prefer that power be centered at the state level, and who\nfear that globalization naturally undermines state sovereignty.\nIn some places, globalization is the same thing as modernization is the same\nthing as westernization which is perceived as secular (or even atheistic), materialistic\nand corrupt. Movements such as Al-Qaeda or Islamic State are violently opposed\nto popular culture, although they would not have a problem if their idea of the ideal\nculture were to become fully global. Rejecting modern popular culture often also\ninvolves elevating a nostalgic, often imaginary golden age as the only acceptable\nmodel of society.\nMany people feel that symbols and representations of popular culture are erasing\nthe very personality of regional cultures. Resistance to popular culture can come in\nmany forms. Let us revisit the concept of fundamental needs, which are universal,\nand how they vary geographically. Locally sourced food products, customs, and\nrecipes are pitted against global fast-food giants that provide inexpensive and easy\naccess to ready-made food products. There has been an uprising of farm-to-table\nbusinesses, the Slow Food movement, and an emphasis on fair-trade products.\n4.9 SUMMARY\nCulture, the learned portion of human behavior is a very broad and very deep\ntopic of human study. Historically humans have lived in small groups practicing\nPage | 78 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY FOLK CULTURE AND POPULAR CULTURE\nfolk culture. This was particularly true of the cultures the sprang from the diffusion\nof agriculture. Many of the folk culture attributes date to this time of human\ndevelopment. The industrial age also ushered in the era of popular culture. Pop\nculture provides the cues that people use to live, work, and interact. Relatively\nrecently has been the rise of global culture, a phenomenon in which large numbers\nof people in diffuse places are committing the same or similar culture practices.\n4.10 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nCommodification: The process of transforming a cultural activity into a saleable product.\nCultural ecology: Study of human adaptations to physical environments.\nCultural Landscape: Landscapes produced by the interaction of physical and human\ninputs.\nCultural reproduction: The process of inculcating cultural values into successive\ngenerations.\nCultural tourism: A variety of tourism concerned with exploring the culture of a place.\nCulture: Learned human behavior associated with groups.\nCulture Hearth: Historic location of cultural formation.\nFashion: The latest and most socially esteemed style of clothing or other products and\nbehaviors.\nFolk Culture: Culture practiced by a small, homogeneous, usually rural group.

It is the principal means by\nwhich we conduct our social lives at home, neighborhood, school, work place and\nrecreation area. It is the tool we use to plan our lives, remember our past, and\nexpress our cultural identity. We create meaning when we talk on the cell phone,\nsend an e-mail message, read a newspaper and interpret a graph or chart. Many\npersons conduct their social lives using only one language. Many others, however,\nrely on two languages in order to participate effectively in the community, get a\njob, obtain a college degree and enjoy loving relation- ships. We live in a discourse\nworld that incorporates ways of speaking, reading and writing, but also integrates\nways of behaving, interacting, thinking and valuing. Language is embedded in\ncultural practices and, at the same time, symbolizes cultural reality itself.\n5.2 LANGUAGE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO CULTURE\nThis first part of the chapter will enable you to understand three major questions\nregarding the nature of human language:\n1. What knowledge of language is available to every speaker?\n2. What communicative uses of language do speakers utilize in interactive\nsituations?\n3. How does language reflect cultural beliefs and practices?\n5.2.1 Language as a Mental Capacity\nTo understand the nature of human language, one needs to approach the\nconcept as a complex system of communication. An important distinction should\nbe considered when using the term language. It can be viewed as an internal\nmental capacity (langue) as well as an external manifestation through speech\n(parole). As human beings, we are able to produce and understand countless\nnumber of utterances which are characterized by the use of grammatical elements\nsuch as words, phrases and sentences.\nWith a limited number language forms, we can produce numerous utterances\nthat can be easily understood by other members of the speech community who\nshare a similar cultural background and language knowledge. This underlying\nmental capacity is embodied in the concept that language is rule-governed\ncreativity, operating at different grammatical levels in the formation of utterances\nor sentences.\nTo illustrate, many examples of utterances or sentences can be derived using a\nlimited set lexical and grammatical words as listed below.\nPage | 82 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nLexical Words Grammatical Words\nNouns (book, class, pencil, student\/s, teacher) Prepositions (on, of, for, from, with)\nVerbs (forms of \u201cto be\u201d, have, want, write) Conjunctions (and, but, which)\nAdjectives (big, good, red, green) Determinants (a\/an\/the, her\/their, my, this\/that)\nAdverbs (far, near, where, very, no\/not) Pronouns (I, he\/she\/it, you, mine\/yours)\n-1-\nSome possible grammatical sentences based on the list of lexical and\ngrammatical words are noted here:\nThe pencil is near the book. \/ The student is near the teacher. \/ The teacher writes\nwith a pencil. \/\nThe green pencil is not far from the book. \/ I want to be a teacher. \/ The red pencil\nis mine. \/\nShe wants to write a good book for her students. \/ This is my book, but I want you\nto have it. \/\nNo, the red pencil is not mine. \/ The teacher wants her students to have a good class.\/\nWhere is the teacher? \/ The book is where? \/ My class has many students. \/\n5.2.2 Language as a Means of Communication\nA salient aspect of language involves the use of the communication system to\nperform a broad range of conversational acts\/functions in \u201cface-to-face\u201d situations.\nFour major types of conversational acts have been proposed:\n\u2022 assertives (speaker informs\/answers\/agrees\/confirms\/rejects\/suggests)\n\u2022 directives (speaker directs\/ invites\/ questions\/orders someone else to\ndo something),\n\u2022 commissives (speaker makes an offer\/promise involving some future\naction),\n\u2022 expressives (speaker apologizes\/evaluates\/greets\/thanks\/expresses\nopinion\/reacts).\nMinor secondary acts consist of language use that serves to emphasize\n(repetition of words\/phrases), expand (add additional information) and comment\non on-going talk. Complementary acts can function as conversational fillers (\u201cyou\nknow\u201d), starters (\u201cwell\u201d), stallers (\u201cuh\u201d), and hedges (\u201cI mean\u201d).\nParticipants in a conversation tend to follow culturally specific norms. Speaker\nA (greets, gives an order, asks a question, apologizes, bids farewell) and Listener\nB (responds accordingly, and uses appropriate conversational language, necessary\nPage | 83 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nto maintain the dialogue). Cultural norms specify \u201cWhat to say \/not say in a\nparticular conversational situation?\u201d \u201cHow to initiate\/end the conversation?\u201d\n\u201cWith whom to talk\/not talk during a conversational encounter?\u201d \u201cWhat locations\nare appropriate\/not appropriate for the use of certain language forms?\nLanguage use is joint action carried out usually by two people. Its use may\nvary due to such factors as the personal characteristics of the participants (friends,\nstrangers, native\/non-native speakers, family members, age\/sex differences). The\nconversation may also be influenced by the location (home, school, work, shopping\ncenter, political meeting) and the topic of conversation (advice, complaint, news\nabout the family, plans for the weekend).\n5.2.3 Language as Cultural Practice\nSpeakers view language as a symbol of their social identity. As the sayings go:\n\u201cYou are what you speak\u201d and \u201cyou are what you eat.\u201d The words that people use\nhave cultural reality. They serve to express information, beliefs and attitudes that\nare shared by the cultural group. Stereotype perceptions come into play when we\nthink about race (Asian, African, European, Native American), religion (Christian,\nMuslim, Jewish, atheist), social status (working class, middle class, wealthy,\nupper class) and citizenship status (US born, visa holder foreigner, undocumented\nworker). Cultural stereotypes are formed by extending the characteristics of a\nperson or group of persons to all others, as in the belief that \u201call Americans are\nindividualists and all Chinese are group-followers, collectivists.\u201d\nAlong with cultural beliefs about groups of people, individuals manifest specific\nviews regarding languages themselves. Some make judgments about Language X\nas being \u201cdifficult to learn\u201d, \u201cnot useful in society\u201d and \u201ctoo boring\u201d. Others might\nview Language Y as the means \u201cto get ahead\u201d,\u201cto make friends\u201d, \u201cto complete a\ncollege requirement\u201d or \u201cto participate in the global marketplace\u201d.\nAccording to royal court gossip in the 16th century, King Charles V of Europe\nhad definite opinions about the languages he spoke: French was the language of\nlove; Italian was the best language to talk to children; German was the appropriate\nlanguage to give commands to dogs; Spanish was the language to talk to God.\nCultural meanings are assigned to language elements by members of the\nspeech community who, in turn, impose them to others who want to belong to\nthe group. Expressions such as \u201cbug off\u201d, \u201cyou know\u201d, \u201cyou don\u2019t say\u201d and \u201ccrack\nhouse\u201d have a common meaning to members of a cultural group. Members in a\nspeech group tend to share a common social space and history and have a similar\nsystem of standards for perceiving, believing, evaluating and acting. Based on\none\u2019s experience of the world in a given cultural group, one uses this knowledge\n(cultural schemata) to predict interactions and relation- ships regarding new\ninformation, events and experiences.\nSchemata function as knowledge structures that allow for the organization\nof information needed to perform daily cultural routines (eating breakfast, going\nshopping, planning a party, visiting friends). We can examine cultural patterns\nPage | 84 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nof behavior in relation to cultural scripts. The concept of cultural scripts is a\nmetaphor from the language of theater. They are the \u201cscripts\u201d that guide social\nbehavior and language use in everyday speaking situations.\n\u201cAttending a wedding\u201d, for example, calls for a variety of speech situations\n(locations and occasions requiring the use of different styles of language). First,\nthere are a series of initial activities (dressing with proper attire, driving to the\nceremony, greeting other persons attending the ceremony), then the actual\nwedding ceremony (participating in the diverse wedding rituals), and finally the\npost-wedding activities (attending the wedding banquet, engaging in the different\nactivities\u2014eating, dancing, toasting the wedding couple, interacting with other\nattendees, and taking leave at the end of the festive celebration.\nEach speech situation may consist of a range of speech events, different ways\nof speaking involving various genres\/styles: colloquial\/informal language, reading\nof a text, song, prayer, farewell speech.\nAt the same time, each speech event might encompass a broad range of\nconversational acts such as greetings, questions, suggestions, advise, promises\nand expressions of gratitude. For individuals who live in a bilingual or multilingual\nworld, verbal behavior is even more dynamic since questions such as Who\nspeaks What language to Whom, When and Where come into play during most\nconversational situations.\n5.3 CLASSIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF\nLANGUAGES\nThis second section will facilitate your understanding of the dimensions of\nlanguage across geographic areas and cultural landscapes. Three main questions\nare addressed in this section:\n1. How are languages classified with respect to issues of national identity\nand genealogical considerations?\n2. What are the major language families of the world and how many\nspeakers make use of the respective languages?\n3. How does language use vary in the United States with respect to\ndialects of English and multilingualism?\n5.3.1 Diffusion of Languages\nLanguage, like any other cultural phenomenon, has an inherent spatiality, and\nall languages have a history of diffusion. As our ancestors moved from place to\nplace, they brought their languages with them. As people have conquered other\nplaces, expanded demographically, or converted others to new religions, languages\nhave moved across space. Writing systems that were developed by one people were\nadapted and used by others. Indo-European, the largest language family, spread\nPage | 85 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nacross a large expanse of Europe and Asia through a mechanism that is still being\ndebated. Later, European expansion produced much of the current linguistic map\nby spreading English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian far from their\nnative European homelands.\nLanguage is disseminated through diffusion, but in complex ways. Relocation\ndiffusion is associated with settler colonies and conquest, but in many places,\nhierarchical diffusion is the form that best explains the predominant languages.\nPeople may be compelled to adopt a dominant language for social, political or\neconomic mobility. Contagious diffusion is also seen in languages, particularly in\nthe adoption of new expressions in a language. One of the most obvious examples\nhas been in the current convergence of British and American English. The British\npress has published books1 and articles2 decrying the Americanization of British\nEnglish, while the American press has done the same thing in reverse3. In reality,\nlanguages borrow bits and pieces from other languages continuously.\nThe establishment of official languages is often related to the linguistic\npower differential within countries. Russification and Arabization are just two\nimplementations of processes that use political power to favor one language over\nanother.\n5.3.2 Classification of Languages\nThere is no precise figure as to the total number of languages spoken in the\nworld today. Estimates vary between 5,000 and 7,000, and the accurate number\ndepends partly on the arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects.\nDialects (variants of the same language) reflect differences along regional and\nethnic lines. In the case of English, most native speakers will agree that they are\nspeakers of English even though differences in pronunciation, vocabulary and\nsentence structure clearly exist. English speakers from England, Canada, Australia,\nNew Zealand and United States of America will generally agree that they speak\nEnglish, and this is also confirmed with the use of a standard written form of the\nlanguage and a common literary heritage. However, there are many other cases in\nwhich speakers will not agree when the question of national identity and mutual\nintelligibility do not coincide.\nThe most common situation is when similar spoken language varieties are\nmutually understandable, but for political and historical reasons, they are regarded\nas different languages as in the case of Scandinavian languages. While Swedes,\nDanes and Norwegians can communicate with each other in most instances, each\nnational group admits speaking a different language: Swedish, Danish, Norwegian\nand Icelandic. There are other cases in which political, ethnic, religious, literary\nand other factors force a distinction between similar language varieties: Hindi vs.\nUrdu, Flemish vs. Dutch, Serbian vs. Croatian, Gallego vs. Portuguese, Xhosa vs\nZulu. An opposite situation occurs when spoken language varieties are not mutually\nunderstood, but for political, historical or cultural motives, they are regarded as\nthe same language as in the case of Lapp and Chinese dialects.\nPage | 86 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nLanguages are usually classified according to membership in a language\nfamily (a group of related languages) which share common linguistic features\n(pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar) and have evolved from a common ancestor\n(proto-language). This type of linguistic classification is known as the genetic\nor genealogical approach. Languages can also be classified according to sentence\nstructure (S)ubject+(V)erb+(O)bject, S+O+V, V+S+O). This type of classification is\nknown as typological classification, and is based on a comparison of the formal\nsimilarities (pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary) which exist among languages.\nLanguage families around the world reflect centuries of geographic movement\nand interaction among different groups of people. The Indo-European family\nof languages, for example, represents nearly half of the world\u2019s population. The\nlanguage family dominates nearly all of Europe, significant areas of Asia, including\nRussia and India, North and South America, Caribbean islands, Australia, New\nZealand, and parts of South Africa. The Indo-European family of languages consists\nof various language branches (a collection of languages within a family with a\ncommon ancestral language) and numerous language subgroups (a collection of\nlanguages within a branch that share a common origin in the relative recent past\nand exhibit many similarities in vocabulary and grammar.\nIndo-European Language Branches and Language Subgroups\nGermanic Branch\nWestern Germanic Group (Dutch, German, Frisian, English)\nNorthern Germanic Group (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faeroese)\nRomance Branch\nFrench, Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, Proven\u00e7al, Romansh, Italian, Romanian)\nSlavic Branch\nWest Slavic Group (Polish, Slovak, Czech, Sorbian)\nEastern Slavic Group (Russian, Ukrainian, Belorussian)\nSouthern Slavic Group (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Bulgarian)\nCeltic Branch\nBritannic Group (Breton, Welsh)\nGaulish Group (Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic)\nBaltic-Slavonic Branch\nLatvian, Lithuanian\nHellenic Branch\nGreek\nPage | 87 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nThracian-Illyrian Branch\nAlbanian\nArmenian Branch\nArmenian\nIranian Branch\nKurdish, Persian, Baluchi, Pashto, Tadzhik\nIndo-Iranian (Indic) Branch\nNorthwestern Group (Panjabi, Sindhi, Pahari, Dardic)\nEastern Group (Assamese, Bengali, Oriya)\nMidland Group (Rajasthani, Hindi\/Urdu, Bihari)\nWest and Southwestern Group (Gujarati, Marathi, Konda, Maldivian, Sinhalese)\nOther languages spoken in Europe, but not belonging to the Indo-European\nfamily are subsumed in these other families: Finno-Ugric (Estonian, Hungarian,\nKarelian, Saami, Altaic (Turkish, Azerbaijani, Uzbek) and Basque.

The\nlinguistic situation of specific member groups of the language family might be\ninfluenced by diverse, interacting factors: settlement history (migration, conquest,\ncolonialism, territorial agreements), ways of living (farming, fishing, hunting,\ntrading) and demographic strength and vitality of the speaker groups. Some\nlanguages might converge (many local varieties becoming one main language),\nwhile others might diverge (one principal language evolves into many other speech\nvarieties). When different linguistic groups come into contact, a pidgin type of\nlanguage may be the result. A pidgin is a composite language with a simplified\nPage | 89 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\ngrammatical system and a limited vocabulary, typically borrowed from the\nlinguistic groups involved in trade and commerce activities.\nTok Pisin is an example of a pidgin spoken in Papua New Guinea and derived\nmainly from English. A pidgin may become a creole language when the size of the\nvocabulary increases, grammatical structures become more complex and children\nlearn it as their native language or mother tongue. There are cases in which one\nexisting language gains the status of a lingua franca. A lingua franca may\nnot necessarily be the mother tongue of any one speaker group, but it serves as\nthe medium of communication and commerce among diverse language groups.\nSwahili, for instance, serves as a lingua franca for much of East Africa, where\nindividuals speak other local and regional languages.\nWith increased globalization and interdependence among nations, English is\nrapidly acquiring the status of lingua franca for much of the world. In Europe,\nAfrica and India and other geographic regions, English serves as a lingua franca\nacross many national-state boundaries. The linguistic con- sequence results in\ncountless numbers of speaker groups who must become bilingual (the ability to use\ntwo languages with varying degrees of fluency) to participate more fully in society.\nSome continents have more spoken languages than others. Asia leads with an\nestimated 2,300 languages, followed by Africa with 2,138. In the Pacific area, there\nare about 1,300 languages spoken and in North and South America about 1,064\nlanguages have been identified. Europe, even with its many nation-states, is at the\nbottom of the list with about 286 languages.\nLanguage Family Speakers in Millions Main Areas Where Spoken\nChinese Sino-Tibetan 1197 China, Taiwan, Singapore\nSpanish Indo-European 406 Spain, Latin America, Southwestern United States\nEnglish Indo-European 335 British Isles, United States, Canada, Caribbean,\nAustralia, New Zealand, South Africa, Philippines,\nformer British colonies in Asia and Africa\nHindi Indo-European 260 Northern India, Pakistan\nArabic Afro-Asiatic 223 Middle East, North Africa\nPortuguese Indo-European 202 Portugal, Brazil, southern Africa\nBengali Indo-European 193 Bangladesh, eastern India\nRussian Indo-European 162 Russia, Kazakhstan, part of Ukraine, 0ther former\nSoviet Republics\nJapanese Japanese 122 Japan\nJavanese Austronesian 84.3 Indonesia\nTen Major Languages of the World in the Number of Native Speakers5\nOther important languages and related dialects, whose total number includes\nboth native speakers and second language users, consist of following: Korean (78\nmillion), Wu\/Chinese (71 million), Telugu (75 million), Tamil (74 million), Yue\/\nChinese (71 million), Marathi (71 million), Vietnamese (68 million) and Turkish\n(61 million).\nPage | 90 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nLanguage Spread and Language Loss\nOf the top 20 languages of the world, all these languages have their origin in\nsouth or east Asia or in Europe. There is not one from the Americas, Oceania\nor Africa. The absence of a major world language in these regions seems to be\nprecisely where most of the linguistic diversity is concentrated.\n\u2022 English, French and Spanish are among the world\u2019s most widespread\nlanguages due to the imperial history of the home countries from where\nthey originated.\n\u2022 Two-thirds (66%) of the world\u2019s population speak 12 of the major\nlanguages around the globe\n\u2022 About 3 percent of the world\u2019s population accounts for 96 percent of\nall the languages spoken today. Of the current living languages in the\nworld, about 2,000 have less than 1,000 native speakers.\n\u2022 Nearly half of the world\u2019s spoken languages will disappear by the end\nof this century. Linguistic extinction (language death) will affect some\ncountries and regions more than others.\n\u2022 In the United States many endangered languages are spoken by Native\nAmerican groups who reside in reservations. Many languages will be\nlost in Amazon rain forest, sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, aboriginal\nAustralia and Southeast Asia.\n\u2022 English is used as an official language in at least 35 countries, including\na number of countries in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Sudan,\nTanzania, Uganda among others), Asia (India, Pakistan, Philippines),\nPacific Region (Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Zealand), Carib-\nbean (Puerto Rico, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica), Ireland and Canada.\n\u2022 English is not by law (de jure) the official language in the United\nKingdom, United States and Australia. English does enjoy the status of\n\u201cnational language\u201d in these countries due to its power and prestige in\ninstitutions and society.\n\u2022 English does not have the highest number of native speakers, but it\nis the world\u2019s most commonly studied language. More people learn\nEnglish than French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, German and Chinese\ncombined.6\nDialects of English in the United States\nAt the time of the American Revolution, three principal dialects of English were\nspoken. These varieties of English corresponded to differences among the original\nsetters who populated the East Coast.\nPage | 91 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nNorthern English\nThese settlements in this area were established and populated almost entirely\nby English settlers. Nearly two-thirds of the colonists in New England were\nPuritans from East Anglia in southwestern England. The region consists of the\nfollowing states: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode\nIsland, Vermont, New York and New Jersey.\nSouthern English\nAbout half of the speakers came from southeast England. Some of them came\nfrom diverse social- class backgrounds, including deported prisoners, indentured\nservants, political and religious persecuted groups. The following states comprise\nthe region: Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.\nMidlands English\nThe settlers of this region included immigrants from diverse backgrounds. Those\nwho settled in Pennsylvania were predominantly Quakers from northern England.\nSome individuals from Scotland and Ireland also settled in Pennsylvania as well\nas in New Jersey and Delaware. Immigrants from Germany, Holland and Sweden\nalso migrated to this region and learned their English from local English-speaking\nsettlers. This region is formed by the following areas\/states: Upper Ohio Valley,\nPennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, western areas North and South Carolina.\nDialects of American English have continued to evolve over time and place.\nRegional differences in pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar do not suggest that\na type of linguistic convergence is under- way, resulting in some type of \u201cnational\ndialect\u201d of American English. Even with the homogenizing influences of radio,\ntelevision, internet, and social media, many distinctive varieties of English can be\nidentified. Robert Delaney (2000) has outlined a dialect map for the United States\nwhich features at least 24 distinctive dialects of English. Dialect boundaries are\nestablished using diverse criteria: language features (differences in pronunciation,\nvocabulary and grammar) settlement history, ethnic diversity, educational levels\nand languages in contact (Spanish\/English in the American Southwest). The\ndialect map does not represent the English varieties spoken in Alaska or Hawaii.\nHowever, it does include some urban and social (ethnolinguistic) dialects.\nGeneral Northern English, spoken by nearly two-thirds of the country.\nNew England Varieties\n1.

With the arrival\nof the Europeans, seven colonial languages established themselves in different\nregions of the territory:\n\u2022 English along the Eastern seaboard, Atlantic coast\n\u2022 Spanish in the South from Florida to California\n\u2022 French in Louisiana and northern Maine\n\u2022 German in Pennsylvania\n\u2022 Dutch in New York (New Amsterdam)\nPage | 93 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\n\u2022 Swedish in Delaware\n\u2022 Russian in Alaska\nDutch, Swedish and Russian survived only for a short period, but the other\nfour languages continue to be spoken to the present day. In the 1920\u2019s, six major\nminority languages were spoken in significant numbers partly to due to massive\nimmigration and territorial histories. The \u201cbig six\u201d minority languages of the 1940\u2019s\ninclude German, Italian, Polish, Yiddish, Spanish and French. Of the six minority\nlanguages, only Spanish and French have shown any gains over time, Spanish\nbecause of continued immigration and French because of increased \u201clanguage\nconsciousness\u201d among individuals from Louisiana and Franco-Americans in the\nNortheast.\nThe 2015 Census data for the United States reveals valuable geographic\ninformation regarding the top 10 states with the extensive language diversity.\n\u2022 California: 45 percent of the inhabitants speak a language other\nthan English at home; the major languages include Spanish, Chinese,\nKorean, Vietnamese, Arabic, Armenian and Tagalog.\n\u2022 Texas: 35 percent of the residents speak a language other than English\nat home; Spanish\n\u2022 is widely used among bilinguals; Chinese, German and Vietnamese are\nalso spoken.\n\u2022 New Mexico: 34 percent of the state\u2019s population speak another\nlanguage; most speak Spanish but a fair number speak Navajo and\nother Native American languages.\n\u2022 New York: 31 percent of the residents speak a second language;\nChinese, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Yiddish; some of these\nlanguages can be found within the same city block.\n\u2022 New Jersey: 31 percent of the state\u2019s residents speak a second language\nin addition to English; some of the languages spoken include Chinese,\nGujarati, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.\n\u2022 Nevada: 30 percent of the population is bilingual; Chinese, German and\nTagalog are used along with Spanish, the predominant second language\nof the Southwest.\n\u2022 Florida: 29 percent of the residents speak a second language, including\nFrench (Haitian Creole), German and Italian\n\u2022 Arizona: 27 percent of the residents claim to be bilingual; most speak\nSpanish as in New Mexico while others use Native American languages.\n\u2022 Hawaii: 26 percent of the population claims to be bilingual; Japanese,\nChinese, Korean and Tagalog are spoken along with Hawaiian, the\nstate\u2019s second official language.\nPage | 94 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\n\u2022 Illinois and Massachusetts: 23 percent of their respective populations\nspeak a second language at home; residents of Illinois speak Chinese,\nGerman, Spanish and Polish, especially in Chicago; residents of\nMassachusetts speak Spanish, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Portuguese,\nVietnamese and French. 8\nTop Ten Languages Spoken in U.S. Homes Other Than English\nData from the 2015 American Community Survey ranks the top ten languages\nspoken in U.S. homes other than English. The data highlight the size of the speaker\npopulation, bilingual proficiency (fluency in the home language and English) and\ndegree of English proficiency (LEP, limited English proficiency).\nRank Language Spoken at Home Total Bilingualism % Limited English %\n1. Spanish 64,716,000 60.0 40.0\n2. Chinese 40,046,000 59.0 41.0\n3. Tagalog 3,334.000 44.3 55.7\n4. Vietnamese 1,737,000 67.6 32.4\n5. French 1,266,000 79.9 20.1\n6. Arabic 1,157,000 62.8 37.2\n7.

French also comprises Haitian and Cajun varieties.\nGerman encompasses Pennsylvania Dutch. 9\nWhile a record number of persons speak a language at home other than English,\na substantial figure within each immigrant group claimed an elevated command of\nEnglish. Overall, some 60 percent of the speaker groups using a second language\nat home were also highly fluent in English. Limited fluency in English among young\nchildren ranged from a high of 55.7 percent in the Tagalog speaker group to a low\nof 14.9 percent in the German group which included Pennsylvania Dutch users.10\nMost immigrant language groups have tended to follow an intergenerational\nlanguage shift in the United States. This first generation is basically monolingual,\nspeaking the native language of the group. The second generation is bilingual, speaking\nboth the home language and English. By the third generation, the cultural group is\nessentially monolingual, speaking only English in most communicative situations.\nMore recently, some immigrant groups, particularly those with advanced\ntraining and degrees in professional fields (technology, health sciences and\nPage | 95 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nbusiness), come to the United States with a high degree of fluency in English. At\nthe same time, the variety of English these persons speak is usually marked by the\ncountry of origin (India, Philippines, Singapore among others). With globalization\n\u201cnew Englishes\u201d have emerged (Indian English, Filipino English, Nigerian English)\nwhich challenge the notion of a Standard English variety (British or American) for\nuse around the world.\n5.4 LANGUAGE IN THE PHYSICAL, BUSINESS AND\nDIGITAL WORLDS\nThis third part of the chapter will enable you to comprehend the uses of\nlanguage across different environments. Three major questions are addressed in\nthis section:\n1. How is language used to indicate place in the physical landscape?\n2. How is language exploited for the purpose of advertising products and\nservices?\n3. How is language employed in the digital world to connect multiple\nsenders and recipients in diverse techno formats?\n5.4.1 Language and Place Names\nThe names people give to their physical environment provide a unique source\nof information about cultural character of various social groups. Place names\noften reveal the history, beliefs and values of a society. Toponymy is the study of\nplace names, and the names people assign to specific geographic sites offer us the\nopportunity to recognize a country\u2019s settlement history, important features of the\nlandscape, famous personalities, and local allusion to distant places and times.\nPlace names can change overnight, often depending of political factors and social\nconsiderations. The change of Burma to\nMyanmar and Zaire to Congo are two recent example of changes due to political\ndevelopments. In the United States, interest in changing the names of places\nassociated with Civil War heroes from the South is an on-going effort, at times\nwith dramatic confrontations between different social groups.\nToponyms provide us with valuable geographic insights about such matters as\nwhere did the settlers come from, who settled and populated the area, and what\nlanguage did the early settlers speak. Many of the place names found in the United\nStates can be classified in terms of the following major categories:\n\u2022 natural landscape features (hills\/mountains, rivers, valleys, deserts,\ncoastline)\nHollywood Hills, Blue Ridge Mountains, Chattahoochee River, Rio\nGrande, San Fernando Valley, Monument Valley, Mohave Desert,\nBiscayne Bay,\nPage | 96 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\n\u2022 urbanized areas (cities, towns, and streets)\nWilliamsburg, VA; Lawrenceville, GA; Chattanooga, TN; New\nIberia, LA; Buford Highway, GA; Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive,\nPonce de Leon Avenue\n\u2022 directional place names (East, North, South, West)\nNorth & South Dakota, West Virginia, North & South Carolina,\nSouth Texas\n\u2022 religious significant names (saints, Biblical names)\nSan Antonio, Santa Fe, St. Louis, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Los\nAngeles; Bethany, AK; Canaan, VT; Jericho, IA; Shiloh, OK\n\u2022 explorers and colonizers (French, English, Spanish, Dutch setters\nColumbus, OH; Coronado, CA; Balboa Park (San Diego), CA;\nCadillac, MI; Hudson, NY; Bronx, NY; Raleigh, NC; Henrico\nCounty, VA\n\u2022 famous persons (presidents, politicians, Native Americans)\nLincoln, NE; Mount McKinley, WA; Austin, TX; Washington, D. C.;\nJackson, MS; Tuscaloosa, AL; Pensacola, FL; Arizona, Mississippi,\nUtah\n\u2022 culturally based names (immigrant\u2019s homeland, famous locations\nNew Orleans; New Mexico; New Amsterdam, NY; Troy, NY; Rome,\nGA; Oxford, MS; Athens, GA; Birmingham, AL; Toledo, OH\n\u2022 business oriented names (wealthy individuals, politicians, corporate\nsponsors)\nSears Tower, Wrigley Stadium, Trump Towers, Gwinnett County,\nDolby Theater, Verizon Center, Sun Trust Park\nA classification scheme proposed by George Stewart (1982) focuses on ten\nbasic themes which dominate North American toponyms. These include the\nfollowing categories: descriptive (Rocky Mountains), associative (Mill Valley,\nCA), commemorative (San Diego, CA), commendatory (Paradise Valley, AZ),\nincidents (Battle Creek, MI), possession (Johnson City, TX), folk (Plains, GA),\nmanufactured (Truth or Consequences, NM), mistakes (Lasker, NC), and location\nshift (Lancaster, PA).\nPage | 97 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\n5.4.2 Language and the Discourse of Advertising\nCommercial advertisement occupies a noticeable expanse in the cultural\nlandscape. An individual text (use and arrangement of specific language forms) is\ndesigned to promote or sell a product within a social context. A commercial text may\nbe accompanied by music and visual depictions. The text may also be accompanied\nby paralanguage features of oral language (gestures, voice quality, facial expressions)\nand written language (choice of typeface, letter sizes, range of colors).\nThe advertisement itself brings up several of discourse concerns: Who (seller)\nis communicating with Whom (consumer) and Why (inform\/convince\/persuade\nabout the product\u2019 importance\/usefulness\/ uniqueness)? The participants in the\ndiscourse may include various message senders\/participants: the actor\/s in the TV\ncommercial along with the supporting role of the advertising agency and the studio\nproduction staff. The receivers may be a specific target group or anyone who sees\nthe advertisement.\nHighway billboards, store signs and product advertisements provide a visual\nrepresentation of commercial language use in a community. Most billboard\nstructures are located on public spaces and display advertisements to passing\nmotorists and pedestrians. They can also be placed in other locations where there\nare many viewers (mass transit stations, shopping malls, office buildings and sports\u2019\nstadiums). Some billboards may be static, while others may change continuously\nor rotate periodically with different advertisements. In addition, there are product\npromotions within a retail store, which often involve product placements at the\nend of aisles and near checkout counters.\nNovelty ads can appear on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, t-shirts,\npens and shopping bags. They can be distributed directly by the advertiser or as\npart of cross-product promotion campaigns. Advertisers use the popularity of\ncultural celebrities in the worlds of sports, music and entertainment to promote\ntheir products. Even aircrafts, balloons and skywriting are used as moveable\nmeans to display advertisements.\nStore signs and highway billboards can be viewed as a visual language trail,\nstretching point A to point B on highway X in a specific geographic area. Depending\non the population characteristics of a location, diverse forms of advertisement are\nused to convince the customer that a company\u2019s services or products are the best in\nquality and price, most useful and socially desired. A drive through various roads\nand highways across Gwinnett County Georgia, for example, might indicate how\nadvertisers respond to the diverse population characteristics.\nEthnolinguistic Diversity in Gwinnett County Georgia11\nThe American Community Survey, aggregate data, 5-year summary file, 2006\nto 2010, provides the following profile of ethnolinguistic diversity.\nPage | 98 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nLanguage in Use Ages 5 years and Above Percentage of Population\nEnglish 484,134 67.80%\nAll languages other than English 229,932 32.20%\nSpanish 124,331 17.41%\nKorean 17,911 2.51%\nVietnamese 12,692 1.78%\nChinese 9,184 1.29%\nAfrican languages 8,750 1.23%\nSerbo-Croatian 5,097 0.71%\nGuajarati 4,725 0.66%\nFrench 4,713 0.66%\nOther Indo-European languages 4,232 0.59%\nHindi 4,227 0.59%\nOther Asian languages 4,181 0.59%\nUrdu 4,088 0.57%\nRussian 2,487 0.35%\nFrench Creole 2,344 0.33%\nGerman 2,127 0.30%\nArabic 2,038 0.29%\nTagalog 1,539 0.22%\nPersian 1,289 0.18%\nMon-Khmer, Cambodian 1,265 0.18%\nJapanese 1,198 0.17%\nOther Slavic languages 1,038 0.15%\nPolish 886 0.12%\nOther Pacific Island languages 864 0.12%\nPortuguese 781 0.11%\nLaotian 645 0.09%\nThai 411 0.06%\nOther West Germanic languages 395 0.06%\nHmong 379 0.05%\nSome important questions regarding language use can be addressed within\nthis multilingual context.\n\u2022 What type of products are marketed to different ethnolinguistic\ncommunities?\n\u2022 What type of services are advertised to different ethnolinguistic\ncommunities?\n\u2022 What type of products are marketed bilingually or in the language of\nthe ethnolinguistic community?\n\u2022 What type of services are advertised bilingually or in the language of\nthe ethnolinguistic community?\nPage | 99 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nThe visual content and design of an advertisement aimed to draw attention\nto a specific product might focus on customer needs such items as food, clothing,\nfurniture, restaurants, home and garden, cosmetics and beauty care, auto\nmaintenance, fitness and recreation, travel and hotels, communication and\ncomputers. The advertising style for product promotion often tends to be laudatory,\npositive and emphasizing the uniqueness. The vocabulary is usually vivid and\nconcrete, involving play-on-words and commercial slogans in some cases. Ads\nrely primarily on language, and it is the visual content and design that creates an\ninterest in the product and persuades people buy it.\nThe advertisement of services for the general population and targeted\nethnolinguistic communities might encompass health services (doctors, dentists,\nhospital and emergency care), financial institutions (banks, credit unions, home\nand car loans, bail bonds), legal services (lawyers, notary public, public defenders)\nand community resources (schools, libraries, museums, parks). Customer needs\nusually dictate what services are available in a specific geographic area. Interest\nin niche marketing or ads targeted to a specific social group represents the strong\nrelationship that exist between cultural and technological changes in contemporary\nUS society.\n5.4.3 Language and the Digital World\nSocial media are computer-mediated technologies which allows multiple\nsenders and receivers to create and share information, ideas, career interests and\nother forms of expression via virtual com- munities and communication networks.\nSocial media use relies on web-based technologies such as desktop computers,\nsmartphones and tablet computers to create highly interactive formats which allow\nindividuals, communities and organizations the possibility to share, co-create,\ndiscuss diverse topics and comment on content previously posted online. Social\nmedia allows for mass cultural exchanges and intercultural communication among\npeople from different regions of the world.\nThe term social media is often used to indicate that many senders and receivers\ncan communicate almost simultaneously across space and time. At the same time,\nthe term social media is used to mean social networks (relationships and contacts\namong many individuals). If one is using the term to mean social networks (who\ninteracts with whom in the linguistic community), then the researcher can \u201cobserve\u201d\nand document the interactional patterns or the researcher can \u201cinterview\u201d the\nparticipants to determine the type of social networks. Social networks, from a\nsociolinguistic perspective, can be differentiated on the basis of whether they are\n\u201cdense\u201d or \u201cloose\u201d. In dense networks all members know each other. In loose\nnetworks not all members know each other. Networks can also be distinguished\nwith the quality of ties (connections) that exist among the members. In uniplex ties,\nindividuals are connected by one type of relationship (participate in the same swim\nclub, take same courses at a college, work in the same business). In multiplex ties,\nPage | 100 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nmembers know each other in several different roles (student\/friend\/classmate;\nparent\/co-worker\/neighbor).\nThe term social media is usually associated with different networking sites\nsuch as the following:\n\u2022 Facebook, an online social network which allows users to create personal\nprofiles, share photos and videos and communicate with other users.\n\u2022 Twitter, an internet service that allows users to post \u201ctweets\u201d (brief\nmessages totaling 140 characters) for their followers to see in real-time.\n\u2022 LinkedIn, a network designed for the business community allowing\nusers to create professional profiles, post resumes, and communicate\nwith other professionals and job-seekers.\n\u2022 Pinterest, an online network that allows users to send photos of items\nfound in the web by\u201cpinning\u201d them and sharing comments with others\nin the virtual community.\n\u2022 Snapchat, an application on mobile devices that allows users to send\nand share photos of themselves performing daily activities.12\nSocial media takes many other forms including blogs, forums, product\/services\nreviews and social gaming and video sharing. The social networking world has\nchanged the way individuals and organizations use language to communicate with\neach other. Research findings indicate the significant impact that social media is\nhaving on society in the United States and elsewhere.\n\u2022 Nearly 80 percent of American adults are online and nearly 60 percent\nof them use social media.\n\u2022 Among the adolescent population, 84 percent have a Facebook account.\n\u2022 Over 60 percent of 13 to 17-year-olds have at least one profile on\nsocial media, with some spending more than two hours a day on social\nnetwork sites.\n\u2022 Internet users spend more time on social media sites than any other\ntype of web-based sites. The use from July 2011 (66 billion minutes) to\nJuly 2012 (121 billion minutes) represents a 99 percent increase.\n\u2022 Young adults, some 33 percent, get their news from social media.\n\u2022 More than half (52 percent) of internet users use two or more social\nmedia sites to communicate with their friends and family.\n\u2022 In the United States, 81 percent of users look online to get news about\nthe weather, 53 percent for national news, 52 percent for sports news,\nand 41 percent for entertainment or celebrity news.13\nPage | 101 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nThere are both positive and negative effects associated with social media. The\npositive effects include the ability to document memories, learn about and explore\ndifferent topics, advertise oneself and form many friendships. On the negative\nside, social media often invades on personal privacy, fosters information overload,\npromotes isolation, affects users\u2019 self-esteem and creates the possibility for online\nharassment and cyberbullying.\nMapping actual language use in the context of the digital world is problematic.\nIt is a complex communication universe. Unlike the geography of place names and\nthe discourse of advertisement, social networking occurs in a virtual environment,\ninvolving many senders\/receivers and different computer-mediated technologies.\nData \u201cmining\u201d is a technique employed to analyze large-scale social media data fields\nto establish general patterns regarding the content\/topics that emerge from people\u2019s\nactual online activities. Usage patterns in social media interest many advertisers,\nmajor businesses, government organizations and political parties. Research\nmethods from the social sciences have been used to establish user\u2019s activities\nwith different types of social media technologies. These include pencil-and-paper\nquestionnaires, individual\/group oral interviews and focus group sessions. These\nmethods involve language-driven interactions with a limited number of users who\nmay or may not reveal their actual social media patterns of behavior.\n5.5 SUMMARY\nLanguage is a mental capacity that allows members of a speech community\nto produce and understand countless number of utterances which include\ngrammatical elements like words, phrases and sentences.\nLanguage as a means of communication makes use of different communicative\nacts (orders, questions, apologies, suggestions) performed during conversational\nsituations across varied social contexts. Language is a symbol of social identity\nand serves to express ideas, beliefs and attitudes shared by a cultural group. It is\nreflected in cultural stereotypes, notions about different languages, and behaviors\nduring speech situations which presuppose the use of cultural schemata and\ncultural scripts.\nLanguages are commonly classified according to membership in a language\nfamily such as Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Indo-Pacific, Mayan, Niger-Congo.\nMembers within a family are further subdivided into branches (Germanic, Slavic,\nFinno-Ugric, Indo-Iranian) and the branches into subgroups (English in the\nGermanic branch; Spanish in the Romance branch).\nThe distribution of languages around the world is influenced by numerous\nfactors: settlement history, demographic strength, ways of living and contact with\nother ethnolinguistic groups. Some languages become more dominant and as a\nresult displace others that may eventually become extinct, leading to language\ndeath. The world\u2019s ten most widespread languages include Chinese, Spanish,\nEnglish, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Japanese, and Javanese.\nPage | 102 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nThe number of dialects or varieties of American English have changed over\ntime due to settlement histories, political changes (Louisiana Purchase, Mexican\nAmerican War, Spanish-American War, territory annexation). Language diversity\nand multilingualism continue to be prevalent in the United States. Recent 2015\nCensus data reveal extensive language diversity in states like California, Texas, New\nMexico, New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Massachusetts.\nPlace names provide us with cultural insights about the significance of\ngeographic locations, important features of the landscape, the recognition of\nfamous personalities, and local reference to distant places and times. Diverse forms\nof advertisement are used to inform and convince customers that the products and\nservices offered are the worthiest in the marketplace.\nThe use of different social media technologies (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,\nSnapchat, among others) allows for online interaction between many senders and\nreceivers. Users can create and share information, ideas, photos, career interests,\nand other concerns via virtual communities and networks.\nGeographic mapping of the use and users of web-based technologies (desktop\ncomputers, smart phones and tablet computers) is unattainable at this time.\nResearch methods from the social science (questionnaires, oral interviews, focus\ngroup sessions) may reveal some insights about the pervasive ways individuals,\ncommunities and organizations communicate in the virtual world.\n5.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nSpeech community: People who share a similar cultural background and language\nknowledge.\nLangue: The internal mental capacity for language.\nParole: The external manifestation of ideas through speech.\nCreole: A blended language differentiated from a pidgin language by its more complex\ngrammar and its status as a first language.\nCultural schemata: A system of standards for perceiving, believing, evaluating and\nacting.\nSpeech situations: Locations and occasions requiring the use of different styles of\nlanguage.\nCultural scripts: The \u201cscripts\u201d that guide social behavior and language use in everyday\nspeaking situations.\nLanguage branch: A group of languages which share common linguistic and have\nevolved from a common ancestor.\nLanguage family: A collection of languages within a family with a common ancestral\nlanguage.\nProto-language: An historic language from which known languages are believed to have\ndescended by differentiation of the proto-language into the languages that form a\nlanguage family.\nPage | 103 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHY OF LANGUAGE\nDialect: Variants of the single language.\nPidgin: A composite language with a simplified grammatical system and a limited\nvocabulary.\nLingua franca: A language used to make communication possible between people who\ndo not share a native language.\nBilingual: Being able to use two languages with varying degrees of fluency.\nToponymy: The study of place names.\nText: The use and arrangement of specific language forms.\nTypological classification: Classification based on the comparison of the formal\nsimilarities in pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary which exist among\nlanguages.\nOfficial language: A language that is given a special legal status over other languages in\na country.\nIntergenerational language shift: A linguistic pattern of acculturation found in US\nimmigrant groups in which a group shifts from being non-English monolingual to\nEnglish monolingual.\n5.7 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nBloomer, Aileen, Patrick Griffths and Andrew John Merrison. 2005.

For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the Spirit.\u201d\n- Khalil Gibran\nThis chapter is an exploration of the geography of religion. Like language and\nethnicity, religion is a cultural characteristic that can be closely bound to individual\nidentity. Religion can provide a sense of community, social cohesion, moral\nstandards, and identifiable architecture. It can also be a source of oppression,\nsocial discord, and political instability. Religion is more than metaphysics- magical\nexplanations for natural phenomena; it is also a governing philosophy of behavior\nand an organizing cosmology of the universe.\nThe following pie chart gives us an idea of the relative size (in terms of adherents)\nof the world\u2019s major religions (Figure 6.1). Bear in mind that these numbers\nare estimates; there is no world governing body collecting detailed statistics of\nreligion. Christians and Muslims make up over half of the world\u2019s population. The\nnext category, the unaffiliated, are a large but diffuse body containing people who\ndo not identify with any religion. Hindus, who cluster in the Indian subcontinent,\nare the next largest group. The category of Folk religion is similar to that of\nFigure 6.1 | Global Religious Percentages1\nThis pie chart shows the relative distributions of the World\u2019s Major Religions.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 108 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nUnaffiliated-it is a large group of religions that are bound into one category solely\nfor logical consistency. Folk religions may consist of ancestor worship in China,\nanimism in central Africa, or any other number of indigenous, local religions. The\nOther category contains newer religions that are just gaining their footholds and\nother religions that may be fading in the contemporary milieu. Judaism is included\nin the chart, although it has comparatively few adherents. It is included for two\nreasons. First, it provided the cultural spoor for both Christianity and Islam, and\nsecond, it is the predominant religion of the modern state of Israel.\nIn some places, religion can be considered a separate element of civil society, but in\nmany others, religion cannot be meaningfully separated from daily life or governance.\nCharts such as this can be somewhat misleading, as can maps of religion\n(Figure 6.2). All these methods of tabulating religion rely on estimates with varying\ndegrees of accuracy. One problem is determining the predominance of a particular\nreligion. Does predominance require over fifty percent? What if no religion in a\ncountry has a majority? In the case of this map, if no religion has a majority, but\nthere are two large religions (for example Christianity and Islam in Nigeria) then\nthe country is split between the two. If there are numerous fragmented groups,\nthen the group with a plurality is used.\nIn some parts of the world, some forms of religious expression are discouraged\nor banned outright. For example, in North Korea, the state ideology is known as\nJuche, which is not a traditional religion with supernatural elements. The practice\nof Buddhism or Christianity in North Korea must necessarily be circumspect. In\nother places, religion has reached the status of being nominal (in name only) in\nwhich people identify with a religion, but the practices of that religion have little\nimpact on their daily lives.\nFigure 6.2 | World Religions by State 20122\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 109 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nState religions are religions that are recognized as the official religion of\na country. In some places with a state religion, such as Denmark or the United\nKingdom, the official status of one religion has little effect either on the practice of\nother religions or on the society at large. In places like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan,\nhowever, the official religion is closely connected to the power of the state, most\nobviously in the form of blasphemy laws which allow for state penalties (including\ndeath) for violations of religious statutes.\nMaps such as this one can be very misleading in the sense that they present\nhomogeneous, religious landscapes by country (Figure 6.2). This is, of course,\nuntrue and it represents one of the problems with mapping anything- the level\nof aggregation. As any spatial phenomenon is aggregated into larger and larger\ngroups, the details of those groups are often lost. An example of the importance of\nscale is seen in the following graphic. Although Mormons make up 88 percent of\nUtah County, Utah, they are only 61% of the state of Utah, and a mere 1.6% of the\nUnited States.\n6.1.1 Scale and Predominant Religion\nFigure 6.3 | Percent Mormon aggregated to the County, State, and National level 3\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 110 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\n6.1.2 Religions in History\nThe current religious map of the world is best thought of as a snapshot. The\nreligious landscape has been continuously changing throughout human history\nand will continue to change in the future. New religions are founded and old ones\ndie out.\nNew religions are often made using pieces of older religions; Christianity and\nIslam deriving in part from Judaism and Buddhism deriving from Hinduism are\nnot aberrations, but instead are examples of a common occurrence.\nWithin the relatively recent past, it has been possible to watch the creation\nand diffusion of several new religions just within the United States. Mormonism,\nthe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventism, and Scientology are all religions\nthat were founded in the U.S. in the relatively recent past.\n6.1.3 The Religious Contribution to Culture and Identity\nReligions are not isolated social phenomena. They exist within a cultural\ncomplex that nurtures and sustains them, or conversely, demeans and undermines\nthem. Religion can be closely bound to other elements of identity -language, or\nnationality. In many societies, the boundaries between religion and social life,\nfamily structure, and law and politics are nonexistent. Religion in those places is\nthe center of all life and everything else revolves around religious concepts. A place\nthat is purely governed by a religious structure is known as a theocracy. There are\nvery few of these in the modern world, although many states have strong religious\ninfluence. Many modern societies have built barriers between religious influence\nand political life. These places are called secular and are much more common in\nthe developed world.\nReligion, along with ethnicity and language, are very often core components\nof an individual\u2019s identity. It can define the way a person sees the world, what\nclothing is appropriate, gender roles, employment, and even your position within\nthe greater society. As such, it has tremendous cultural influence, and this influence\nis visible in the landscape.\n6.1.4 Esthetics and religion\nReligion has a motivating factor that few other social phenomena can match.\nWhen people are doing something for God, they generally have fewer limits than in\nother spheres of life. One of the ways this lack of limits is manifest in the landscape\nis through religious architecture.\nSacred spaces can be religious structures, but they can also be historic\nbattlefields, cemeteries, mountains, or rivers. Anything that humans use to\ngenerate a sense of the divine can be considered a sacred space. Sacred spaces have\nexpectations of behavior. In some places, it is still possible to claim sanctuary in\na sacred place. The small altars that mark roadside fatalities in the United States\ncan be considered sacred spaces, as could a closet that is used as a prayer room.\nPage | 111 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nElements of culture may be manifest in different types of churches, temples on\nthe landscape, as well as clothing, the food grown, and small home devotionals.\nAnother way that religion manifests in the visible sphere is through codes of\nacceptable dress as well as acceptable public behaviors.\nA less obvious way that religions may influence the landscape is through\nreligious influences on dietary choices. Food production can be influenced by\nreligions. Many religions have doctrine regarding what is acceptable food, and what\nis not. Halal, Kosher and Ital are all representative of food restrictions. Religions\nthat prohibit the consumption of pork will probably not have swine farms. Cattle\nwander through the countryside in India, since they are religiously protected from\nharm. Another effect that religion has on the landscape is the effect of pilgrimage.\nMany religions have an activity that requires gathering at a particular place.\nProbably the best-known pilgrimage is the Hajj of Islam, but this isn\u2019t actually the\nlargest in the world. That would be the Hindu Kumbh Mela. The Camino Santiago\nis a well-known Christian pilgrimage that ends in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\nPilgrimage is not just visible through the pilgrims, but in the entire infrastructure\nthat develops to support the pilgrims.\n6.2 OVERVIEW OF MAJOR RELIGIONS\n6.2.1 Types of Religions\nWe often break religions into one of two basic types: ethnic and universalizing.\nEthnic religions are associated within one group of people. They make little\nto no effort at proselytizing (converting others), although that possibility may\nexist. The largest ethnic religion is Hinduism. Judaism is another well-known\nethnic religion. Through migration, both of these religions have become dispersed\naround much of the world, but they are closely tied to their own ethnic groups.\nUniversalizing religions seek to convert others. For some religions, it is\na requirement for practitioners to spend part of their lives in missionary work\nattempting to convert others.\nAnother way of dividing religions is into the categories of polytheistic (many\ngods) and monotheistic (one god). Although the difference between monotheistic\nreligions and polytheistic religions seems unbridgeable, there are religions that\nhave managed to combine elements of polytheism and monotheism into the\nsame religion. For example, in Voudon (Voodoo), entities that had previously\nrepresented African gods are recast as Catholic saints, who themselves are semi-\ndivine in the Catholic cosmology. Combining two religions to create a new religion\nis known as syncretism.\n6.2.2 A Brief Description of the Major Religions\nChristianity\nChristianity is a monotheistic religion centered on the life and teachings of\nJesus of Nazareth. It dates to some time in the first century AD since the Western\nPage | 112 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nworld uses the Christian calendar. Christianity began as an offshoot of Judaism,\nand includes the Hebrew Bible (known to Christians as the Old Testament) as well\nas the New Testament as its canonized scriptures. It has three main branches:\nCatholic, Orthodox, and Protestant (Figure 6.4). Catholic and Orthodox\nChristianity split roughly one thousand years ago, while the Protestant\/Catholic\nSchism began in the sixteenth century. The split between the Orthodox and\nCatholic hierarchies centered around whose authority in the church was final.\nThe split between Protestantism and Catholicism mostly centered on practices\nconducted by the Catholic Church that the future Protestants did not believe were\nsuitable for a religious organization.\nThe three branches of Christianity have their own spatiality, with a great\ndeal of overlap between them. Orthodox Christianity is mostly seen in Russia,\nEastern Europe, and Southern Europe with notable examples in Africa (Ethiopia)\nand in places where large numbers of people from these places have migrated (the\nUnited States, Canada). Catholic Christianity is seen in a wider range of places.\nIt largely formed around the historic Roman Empire, then spread to the north\nand west of Europe. Catholicism did not stop there, however. The age of colonial\nexpansion transplanted Catholicism to such widespread places as the Philippines,\nmuch of the Americas and Caribbean, and large parts of Africa. Protestantism is\nthe most recently developed Christian branch, but it has also diffused widely. The\ninitial Protestant countries were in northern Europe, but again due to colonialism,\nProtestant Christianity was exported to places like the United States, South Africa,\nGhana, and New Zealand. The current expansion of Christianity, particularly in\nAsia, is largely due to the growth of Protestantism.\nFigure 6.4 | Christian Places 4\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Christian from OpenStreetMap. Note how it varies from Figure 6.2\nin that it shows a religious landscape that is more fragmented and interspersed.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 113 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nEach Christian branch has developed a distinct appearance in the landscape.\nOrthodox churches are meant to invoke a sense of the divine. Buildings are\nelaborate, both inside and outside. Catholic churches also tend to be elaborate, in a\nsimilar vein to Orthodox churches, but with a different architectural tradition. This\nis understandable due to the fact that these two branches of Christianity arose in\ndifferent places with different ideas of architectural grandeur and beauty. Protestant\nchurches as a collective are less elaborate that their close relatives. This is a reflection\nof the early history of Protestant churches, which were often specific rejections of\nthe elaborate ceremony and ostentatious display of the Catholic Church.\nIslam\nIslam is a monotheistic religion originating with the teachings of Muhammad\n(570-632), an Arab religious and political figure. The word Islam means\n\u201csubmission\u201d, or the total surrender of oneself to God. An adherent of Islam is known\nas a Muslim, meaning \u201cone who submits (to God).\u201d Both Islam and Christianity\ninherited the idea of the chain of prophecy from Judaism. This means that figures\nsuch as Moses (Judaism) and Jesus (Christianity) are considered prophets in\nIslam. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the very last in that chain of prophecy.\nIslam has two main branches, and many smaller ones. Of the two main branches\n-Sunni and Shi\u2019a, Sunni is much larger, comprising roughly 80% of all Muslims\n(Figure 6.5). The split between the two largest branches of Islam centered around\nthe question of succession, that is to say, who would be the rightful leader of the\nMuslim world. Currently, there is no single voice for the global Muslim community.\nOther forms of Islam include Sufi (mystical) Islam and Ahmadi Islam. India is the\nFigure 6.5 | Muslim Places 5\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Muslim from OpenStreetMap. The distribution of the different\nbranches (particularly Sunni and Shia) belie any hard lines in the religious landscape.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 114 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nnumber three Muslim country, but there are five times as many Hindus in India as\nthere are Muslims.\nThe Muslim world is somewhat more contiguous than the Christian world. This\nis mostly due to the fact that the Muslim expansion did not occur in two phases in\nthe same way that Christianity did. As can be seen in the following map, Sunni and\nShi\u2019a countries are somewhat spatially separated. Only the countries of Iran, Iraq,\nAzerbaijan, and Bahrain are majority Shi\u2019a. There are sizable minority Muslim\nsects in the world. Many of these groups, such as the Ahmadiyya, are subject to\ndiscrimination by other Muslim populations and\/or governments. The world\u2019s\nmost theocratic governments are Muslim, particularly those of Iran and Saudi\nArabia. This is notable in that these two countries are also regional rivals and the\ntwo most powerful states in the Muslim world.\nBuddhism\nBuddhism is an offshoot of Hinduism that dates to the fifth century BCE. It was\nfounded by Siddhartha Gautama near the modern border between Nepal and India.\nThe three largest branches of Buddhism are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana\n(Figure 6.6). The main differences between the branches are their approaches to\ncanonized doctrine.\nFigure 6.6 | Buddhist Places 6\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Buddhist from OpenStreetMap. It does not break Buddhism into\nits major branches of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nHinduism\nHinduism is a religious tradition that originated in the Indian subcontinent\n(Figure 6.7). Its origins can be traced to the ancient Vedic civilization (1500\nBCE), a product of the invasion of Indo-European peoples. A conglomerate of\nPage | 115 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\ndiverse beliefs and traditions that assembled organically over a period of centuries,\nHinduism has no single founder. Due to its concurrent growth with Indian\ncivilization, Hinduism has historically been tightly bound to the caste system,\nalthough the modern Indian state has worked to ameliorate the more damaging\neffects of this relationship.\nFigure 6.7 | Hindu Places 7\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Hindu from OpenStreetMap. Although heavily associated with the\nmodern Indian state, large numbers of Hindus now live elsewhere.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nChinese Religions\nNot strictly located in China, Chinese religions are closely tied to Daoism (a\nnature religion), Confucianism (a philosophy of living), and ancestor worship.\nChinese religious structures are associated with people of Chinese descent within\nand external to China. Because of the diversity of religious practices and beliefs,\nthis category is best thought of as a complex of beliefs, rather than a defined set of\nbeliefs and practices.\nSikhism\nSikhism is a 15th Century amalgamation of Islam and Hinduism. It is in many\nways emblematic of syncretic religions. Syncretic religions are created by the\ncombination of two or more religions, with the addition of doctrinal elements to\ncreate cohesion between the disparate pieces. Founded by Nanak Dev Ji (1469 \u2013\n1539) Sikhism reconciles Hinduism and Islam by recasting Hindu gods as aspects of\na single god, in a manner similar to the Catholic Trinity. Although heavily associated\nwith the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, Sikhism has spread widely\nthrough relocation diffusion (Figure 6.8). It has about 26 million adherents.\nPage | 116 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nFigure 6.8 | Sikh Places 8\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Sikh from OpenStreetMap. Although originating in the Punjab on\nthe Indian Subcontinent, it has diffused widely.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nJudaism\nJudaism is a monotheistic religion originating in the Bronze Age in the eastern\nMediterranean (Figure 6.9). Although it has no single founder, it holds the Torah\nas its holy book. In the modern context of Judaism, there are three major forms\u2014\nFigure 6.9 | Jewish Places 9\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Jewish from OpenStreetMap. It does not break Judaism into\nOrthodox, Conservative and Reform.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 117 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nOrthodox, Conservative and Reform\u2014each with their own set of interpretations\nof correct practice. Judaism, as the initial Abrahamic religion, influenced other\nreligions (particularly Christianity and Islam).\nAnimism, Jainism, Bahai, Shinto and Others\nThis catch-all category combines together religions that are all quite different.\nThey are here due to their similar ties to places or ethnicities, not because they\nshare any doctrinal or historical connections. Before continuing on a discussion\nof the following religions, it is important to make a point clear. It is possible to\npractice more than one religion. Many people in the world practice two or more\nreligions with no sense of contradiction. In many parts of the world, pre-Christian\nor pre-Islamic beliefs persist alongside the newer religions.\nAnimism is a broad category, found in a variety of environments (Figure\n6.10). The underlying theme is the idea that almost anything in the environment-\npeople, mountains, rivers, rain, etc. is alive and worthy of recognition as such.\nAnimism is frequently practiced with other ideologies or philosophies.\nBaha\u2019i was founded by Mirza Husayn Ali Nuri (1817-1892) in 1863. Baha\u2019i\nwas an offshoot of another religion, Babism, that in itself was a derivative of\nIslam. Although traditional Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last of the\nprophets (the seal of the prophets) many religions have been founded on the idea\nthat there could be other, later people who also spoke for god. Baha\u2019is believe that\nnew messengers would be sent to humanity to remind people of their universal\nrelationship to god and one another. The late date and historic context of this\nreligion informed a religion that explicitly rejected racism and nationalism. One\nFigure 6.10 | Other Religious Places 10\nThis dot map shows some structures designated as Animist, Jain, Baha\u2019I, and Zoroastrian from OpenStreetMap.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 118 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nof the notable characteristics is that although Baha\u2019is are not one of the larger\nreligions on Earth, they have a temple on every permanently inhabited continent.\nJainism is another ancient religion that arose in India. It is best known for its\nconcept of ahimsa, or nonviolence.\nShinto, the ethnic religion of Japan is often practiced in conjunction with\nBuddhism. It is polytheistic and dates back centuries. The most important\nconsideration of Shinto is that the rituals are so ingrained in Japanese national\nidentity that the religion can either be considered vibrant and relevant, or moribund\nand ritualistic, depending on the perspective of the viewer.\nSyncretic Religions\nSyncretic religions are formed by the combination of two or more existing\nreligions to produce a new religion (Figure 6.11). Some of the larger syncretic\nreligions have already been mentioned, such as Baha\u2019i or Sikhism.\nCao Dai is a religion founded in twentieth century Vietnam. It has strains\nof Taoism and Buddhism and represents an attempt to reconcile many diverse\nreligious traditions into a single religion.\nVoodoo arose in French Caribbean colonies as a combination of Catholicism\nand the beliefs of another set of West African peoples, the Ewe and the Fon.\nPractitioners speak to God using intercessors called loa that function as saints do\nin both the Catholic and Sufi worlds.\nCandomble is a syncretism formed from many West African religious\ntraditions and Catholicism. It has existed in Brazil for centuries. It believes in a\ncreator god (Oludumare) and a series of demi-gods (Orishas).\nFigure 6.11 | Syncretic Religions 11\nThis dot map shows structures designated as Candomble, Voodoo, or Cao Dai from OpenStreetMap. Notice that\nCao Dai has diffused from its origin in Vietnam to Australia and the United States.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 119 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nNew Religions\nMuch like any other human phenomena, new religions are formed continuously.\nThey are usually adaptations or combinations of existing religions. It is impossible\nto list the most recent arrivals. This category includes such religions as Scientology,\nthe Unification Church, Seicho no Ie and Wicca.\nWhat about the Nonreligious?\nSometimes the nonreligious are considered a religion unto themselves. This\nis generally not true. The nonreligious category is amorphous. There are no\ndocuments of beliefs that all nonreligious people must abide by. There is no over-\narching nonreligious creed. It is another catch-all category that contains a large,\ndiverse population with divergent beliefs and practices. Within these categories,\nhowever, there are notable manifestations. First, there are those places which are\nofficially atheistic or non-religious. This label is problematic. It provides only the\nperspective of the government of these places. In many places that officially have\nno religions, practitioners simply do not advertise their religious affiliations. In\nother places, religious attendance has declined to a point that many people have no\nconnection to a particular religious tradition. The label agnostic refers to the idea\nthat the existence of a higher power is unknowable. It is important to point out that\nreligions do not necessarily require the existence of a god-like force. Daoism relies\non nature as its driving force.\n6.3 DIFFUSION OF MAJOR RELIGIONS\nReligion uses nearly all forms of diffusion to reproduce itself across space.\nHierarchical diffusion generally involves the conversion of a king, emperor, or\nother leader who then influences others to convert. Relocation diffusion, often\nthrough missionary work, brings \u201cgreat leaps forward\u201d by crossing space to secure\nfootholds in far-away places. Contagious diffusion is most often seen in a religious\ncontext as the result of direct proselytizing. All these forms of diffusion produce\npatterns of diffusion that are complex. It is impossible to know why certain\nreligions have appeal in particular times or places, but they do, and that appeal can\nwear off over time.\nAnother important thing to remember is that the religious landscape is just\na snapshot. In the same way that it has always changed, it will continue to do so.\nThese maps can reinforce this idea in that they demonstrate the historical nature\nof current religious distributions. Remind yourself that these religious expansions\noccurred at different times. This will help explain why some places will become\nBuddhist or Christian at one point in history, but become Muslim at another.\nPage | 120 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\n6.3.1 The Diffusion of Buddhism\nBuddhism originated near the current Nepalese-Indian border. Like many\nother religions, it spread in other directions, particularly to the south and east\n(Figure 6.12).\nFigure 6.12 | Diffusion of Buddhism 12\nThis map shows the distinct waves of the diffusion of Buddhism.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nDue to its position as the oldest large, universalizing religion, Buddhism is a\ngood example of the lifecycle of a religion. From its origins, the religion spread\nacross what is now India and Nepal. It spread in all directions but looking at a\ncurrent religious map reveals that the process did not end 1500 years ago. Much of\nits territory on the Indian subcontinent would become mostly Hindu or Muslim.\nTo the east and south, however, the religion continued and expanded. It is not\nunusual for a religion to prove popular far from its place of origin. In fact, that is\nthe key to a successful universalizing religion.\n6.3.2 The Diffusion of Christianity\nChristianity was founded in the eastern Mediterranean, although much like\nBuddhism, its greatest successes were found in other parts of the world (Figure\n6.13). Christianity initially grew in areas dominated by the Roman Empire,\nbut it would adapt and thrive in many places. With the collapse of the Empire,\nChristianity became the only source of social cohesion in Europe for centuries.\nLater, Christianity was promoted through the process of colonialism, and as such,\nit was modified by the process that distributed it. The spread of Christianity helped\ndrive the process that created the modern world.\nPage | 121 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nFigure 6.13 | Diffusion of Christianity 13\nThis map shows the distinct waves of the diffusion of Christianity, the initial wave from its foundation, and the\nsubsequent wave associated with European Colonialism.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n6.3.3 The Diffusion of Islam\nThe most recent of the world\u2019s largest religions, Islam is also the one that is\nexpanding the fastest (Figure 6.14). This is not necessarily through conquest or\nconversion, but mostly through current demographics. Islam provides a blueprint\nFigure 6.14 | Diffusion of Islam 14\nThis map shows the distinct waves of the diffusion of Islam.\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 122 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\nfor most aspects of life and as such, has often been associated with rapid expansion\ndriven by military conquest. Although military conquest occurred in the past,\nmilitary campaigns have been rare since the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The\nrelative distributions of Buddhists, Christians, and Muslims have in fact changed\nlittle in half a millennium. Although there has been some migration of Muslims\ninto western Europe, the percentages of Muslims in each country is small. France\nhas the largest percentage of Muslims at 7.5%. To keep this in perspective, that is\nmuch lower than the percentage of Muslims in Spain in 1492.\n6.4 RELIGIOUS CONFLICT\nHuman beings have struggled against one another for a variety of reasons.\nReligious disagreements can be particularly intense. Sectarian violence\ninvolves differences based on interpretations of religious doctrine or practice. The\nstruggles between the Catholic and Orthodox churches, or the wars associated\nwith the Protestant Reformation and Counter Reformation, are examples of this\nform of conflict. The current violence seen between Sunni and Shia Muslims is\nalso in this category. Closely associated with this kind of conflict is religious\nfundamentalism. Religious fundamentalism rests on a literal interpretation and\nstrict and intense adherence to the basic principles of a religion. The conflict arises\nwhen religious fundamentalists see their coreligionists as being insufficiently\npious. Extremism is the idea that the end of a religious goal can be justified by\nalmost any means. Some groups that are convinced that they have divine blessing\nhave few limits to their behavior, including resorting to violence.\nAnother form of religious violence is between completely different religions.\nWars between Muslims and Christians or Hindus and Buddhists have been framed\nas wars for the benefit or detriment of particular religions. What is described as\nreligious strife, however, is often not. Although some religions are fighting over\ndoctrinal differences, most conflict stems from more secular causes- a desire for\npolitical power, a struggle for resources, ethnic rivalries, and economic competition.\nThe Israel\/Palestine conflict is a struggle over territory, resources, and political\nrecognition. The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar has less to do with religion and more\nto do with differences in ethnicity, national origin, and post-colonial identity.\nMassacres in Sahelian Africa are better framed as farmers versus herders. The\nlong running violence between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is\nbetter framed as a violent dispute between one group who holds allegiance with the\nRepublic of Ireland and the other who holds allegiance with the United Kingdom.\nThis is not to say that religious violence does not exist. It does. The most obvious\nexample of this in recent years has been the emergence of Islamic State. This\norganization carries all the worst examples of religious extremism- sectarianism\ntoward other Muslims (the Shi\u2019a), attempted genocide of religious minorities\n(Yazidis and Christians), and brutal repression through the apparatus of the state.\nPage | 123 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY RELIGION\n6.5 SUMMARY\nReligion can be key to a person\u2019s identity. It manifests both as an internal\nsentiment as well as in structures in a landscape. The religious world is always\nchanging, but at a pace that is generally very slow. New religions are created,\nwhile other religions may fade away, or change. The general historical trend has\nbeen toward a small number of universalizing religions gaining ground over local,\nethnic religions. Religious differences can lead to conflict, although many conflicts\npresented as religious in nature have their roots elsewhere. Just like language,\nreligion is another way of sorting people into groups, either for good or bad.\nAnother such way of sorting people is ethnicity, the subject of the next chapter.\n6.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAgnostic: The belief that existence of the supernatural is unknown or unknowable.\nAtheistic: The belief that there is nothing supernatural.\nBranches: A large division of a religion.\nCanonized doctrine: The officially recognized documents or ideas of a religion.\nEthnic religions: A religion associated with a particular ethnic group.\nMonotheism: The belief in one god.\nPilgrimage: A journey to a sacred place.\nPolytheism: The belief in many gods.\nProphecy: Communication with a supernatural power.\nProselytizing: Seeking converts to a religion.\nReligious fundamentalism: The belief in the absolute authority of a religious text.\nSacred spaces: Places associated with a sense of the divine.\nSanctuary: A haven or place of safety, often defined by law.\nSchism: The fracturing of an organization.\nSectarian violence: Violence between different sects of the same religion.\nSecular: A condition of separation between a state and any religion.\nState religion: The official religion of a state.

Understand: the differing bases of ethnic identity\n2. Explain: the relationship between ethnicity and personal identity\n3. Describe: the degrees of relevance of ethnicity in a society\n4. Connect: ethnicity, race, and class as they relate to political power\nCHAPTER OUTLINE\n7.1 What are ethnicity and race?\n7.2 Relevance of race and ethnicity in the United States\n7.3 Ethnicities in the United States\n7.4 Relevance of race and ethnicity in other places\n7.5 Summary\n7.6 Key Terms Defined\n7.7 Works Consulted and Further Reading\n7.8 Endnotes\nPage | 127 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.1 WHAT ARE ETHNICITY AND RACE?\nA common question asked in introductory geography classes is \u201cWhat is\nethnicity and how is it different than race? The short answer to that question is that\nethnicity involves learned behavior and race is defined by inherited characteristics.\nThis answer is incomplete. In reality, both race and ethnicity are complex elements\nembedded in the societies that house them. The relationship between race, ethnicity\nand economic class further complicates the answer.\nOther students have asked, \u201cHow is this geography? Ethnicity and race have\nstrong spatial dimensions. Both races and ethnicities have associated places and\nspatial interactions. A person\u2019s ability to navigate and use space is contingent\nupon many factors- wealth, gender, and race\/ethnicity. Anything that sets limits\non a person\u2019s movement is fair game for geographic study. Numerous geographic\nstudies have centered on the sense of place. Race and ethnicity are part of a place.\nSigns are written in languages, houses have styles, people wear clothing (or not!)\nand all of these things can indicate ethnicity.\n7.1.1 The Bases of Ethnicity\nEthnicity is identification through language, religion, collective history,\nnational origin, or other cultural characteristics. A cultural characteristic or a set of\ncharacteristics is the constituent element of an ethnicity. Another way of thinking\nof an ethnicity is as a nation or a people. In many parts of the world, ethnic\ndifferences are the basis or political or cultural uprisings. For example, in almost\nevery way the Basque people residing on the western border between France and\nSpain are exactly like their non-Basque neighbors. They have similar jobs, eat\nsimilar foods, and have the same religion. The one thing that separates them from\ntheir neighbors is that they speak the Basque language. To an outsider, this may\nseem like a negligible detail, but it is not. It is the basis of Basque national identity,\nwhich has produced a political separatist movement. At times, this movement has\nresorted to violence in their struggle for independence. People have died over the\nrelative importance of this language. The Basques see themselves as a nation, and\nthey want a country.\nThe ethnicities of dominant groups are rarely ever problematized. Majority\nethnicities are considered the default, or the normal, and the smaller groups are\nin some way or another marginal. Talking about ethnicity almost always means\ntalking about minorities.\nThere are three prominent theories of Ethnic Geography: amalgamation,\nacculturation, and assimilation. These theories describe the relation between\nmajority and minority cultures within a society. Amalgamation is the idea\nthat multiethnic societies will eventually become a combination of the cultural\ncharacteristics of their ethnic groups. The best-known manifestation of this idea\nis the notion of the United States as a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of cultures, with distinctive\nadditions from multiple sources.\nPage | 128 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nAcculturation is the adoption of the cultural characteristics of one group by\nanother. In some instances, majority cultures adopt minority cultural characteristics\n(for example the celebration of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day), but often acculturation is a\nprocess that shifts the culture of a minority toward that of the majority.\nAssimilation is the reduction of minority cultural characteristics, sometimes\nto the point that the ethnicity ceases to exist. The Welsh in the United States have\nfew, if any, distinct cultural traits.\nWhen we looked at the previous chapters- Language, Religion, and now\nEthnicity, we have explored subjects that are often the core of a person\u2019s identity.\nIdentity is who we are and we, as people, are often protective of those who share\nour collective identity. For example, ethnicity, and religion can be closely tied,\nand what can appear as a religious conflict may be in fact a politicized ethnic\ndisagreement or a struggle over resources between ethnicities that has become\ndefined as a religious war. Muslim Fula herders and Christian farmers in Nigeria\naren\u2019t battling over religious doctrine; they\u2019re two different peoples fighting for the\nsame land and water resources.\nOne of the enduring ideas of modern political collectives is that we consider\neveryone within the boundaries of our country as \u201cour group.\u201d The reality has not\nlived up to that concept, however. Many modern countries are wracked by ethnic\nstruggles that have proven remarkable resistant to ideas of ethnic or racial equality.\n7.1.2 Race\nThe central question around race is simple: \u201cDoes race even exist?\u201d Depending\non how the question is framed, the answer can be either yes or no. If race is\nbeing used in a human context in the same way that species is used in an animal\ncontext, then race does not exist. Humans are just too similar as a population.\nIf the question is rephrased as, \u201cAre there some superficial differences between\npreviously spatially isolated human groups?\u201d then the answer is yes. There are\ngenetic, heritable differences between groups of people. However, these differences\nin phenotype (appearance) say very little about genotype (genetics). Why is that?\nThe reality is that human beings have been very mobile in their history. People\nmove and they mix with other groups of people. There are no hard genetic lines\nbetween different racial categories in the environment. As a consequence of this,\nracial categories can be considered socially constructed.\n7.1.3 How are ethnicity and race different?\nPeople tend to have difficulties with the distinctions. Let\u2019s start with the easiest\nracial category in the United States- African American. Most people understand\nthat the origin of the African American or Black population of the United States is\nAfrican. That is the race part. Now, the ethnic part appears to be exactly the same\nthing, and it almost is, but only for a particular historical reason. If Africans had\nbeen forcibly migrated by group, for example large numbers of BaKongo or Igbo\nPage | 129 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\npeople were taken from Africa and brought to Virginia and settled as a group, then\nwe would be talking about these groups as specific ethnicities in the same way we\ntalk about the Germans or Czechs in America. The Germans and Czechs came in\nlarge groups and often settled together, and preserved their culture long enough to\nbe recognized as separate ethnicities.\nThat settlement pattern did not happen with enslaved Africans. They were\nbrought to the United States, sold off effectively at random, and their individual\nethnic cultures did not survive the acculturation process. They did, however,\nhold onto some general group characteristics, and they also, as a group, developed\ntheir own cultural characteristics here in the United States. Interestingly, as direct\nAfrican immigration to the United States has increased, the complexity of the term\nAfrican American has increased, since it now includes an even larger cultural range.\n7.1.4 Specifically Ethnic\nThe United States is a multiethnic and multiracial society. The country has\nrecognized this from the very beginning, and the U.S. Census has been a record of\nethnic representation for the U.S. since 1790. Here are the current racial categories\n(Figure 7.1).\nFigure 7.1 | U.S. Racial Makeup according to the United States Census of 2016 1\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 130 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nThere are many ethnicities in the United States, and data are collected to a\ngranular level, but in many ways, the ethnic categories are subsets of the racial\ncategories. The idea is that race is a large physical grouping, and ethnicity is a\nsmaller, cultural grouping. Thinking about the data this way helps understand\nwhy African American is both an ethnicity and a race (Remembering that there\nare African-Americans who come directly from Africa). Another, more complete\nexample is the numerous ethnicities within American Indian. Within the race\ncategory of American Indian and Alaska Native are dozens of individual nations\n(Figure 7.2).\nAmerican Indian Nations\nApache Comanche Menominee Seminole\nArapaho Cree Navajo Shawnee\nAssiniboine Sioux Creek Osage Shoshone\nBlackfeet Crow Ottawa Sioux\nCherokee Delaware Paiute Tohono O'Odham\nCheyenne Hopi Pima Ute\nChickasaw Houma Potawatomi Yakama\nChippewa Iroquois Pueblo Yaqui\nChoctaw Kiowa Puget Sound Salish Yuman\nColville Lumbee\nFigure 7.2 | Federally recognized American Indian Nations 2\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n7.1.5 Hispanic Ethnicity in the United States\nSince 1976, the United States government has required the collection and\nanalysis of data for only one ethnicity: \u201cAmericans of Spanish origin or descent.\u201d\nThe term used to designate this ethnicity is Hispanic. It is a reference to the Roman\nname for what is now modern Spain. Hispanics, however are generally not Spanish;\nthey are people who originate in one of the former colonies of Spain. Another term\nthat is used is Latino, which is another reference to the Roman Empire. Both of\nthese labels are very vague. Generally, people identify with the country of their\nancestors (Mexico, Thailand), and not with a label generated by the Census Bureau\nfor the purposes or recordkeeping.\nHispanics can be of any race. It is important to note that all racial and ethnic\ninformation is self-reported. This means that the person who decides if you are\nAfrican American, Hispanic, or any other category is you. One final detail is that\nnative people of hispanophone countries, even if they themselves do not speak\nSpanish, will often be considered Hispanic.\nPage | 131 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.2 RELEVANCE OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE\nUNITED STATES\nThe importance of race and ethnicity is variable both across space and across\ntime. Historically, divisions in the United States along ethnic or racial lines\nhave been the norm. but now these divisions based on race or ethnicity are not\nas prevalent as they have previously been. From the earliest days of the country\nand codified in the US Constitution, slavery created a profoundly divided society,\nparticularly between the free, white population and the enslaved Black population.\nFree people of color provided a small degree of linkage between the groups.\nThese were not the only divisions in the US, however. The dominant group\nwere people of English descent. In geographical terms, we refer to them as a\ncharter group. The charter group does not refer to the first people to come to a\nplace; they are people with the first effective settlement. This is an academic\nway of saying that they are the first group with political dominance. English\nsettlers produced laws that furthered their own interests. They promoted their\nown language (English), religion (Protestant Christianity) and governance. Groups\ncoming in later found themselves in a place where many of the cultural questions\nhad already been answered. The pressure to assimilate in the United States applies\nto everyone. There can be political pressure; for example, during World War\nOne German Americans largely stopped speaking German. The pressure can be\nsocial; for example, young children at school can feel isolated when they cannot\nspeak the majority language. Particularly, the pressure can be economic. Without\nconforming to general social (majority) norms, it can be difficult to navigate the\nemployment market. A lack of English, unawareness of the norms of formal dress\nor behavior, or just the inability to recognize social cues can make life difficult for\nthose who have not acculturated.\nThe charter group also changed. For example, the definitions of \u201cwhiteness\u201d\nand \u201cblackness\u201d have not been historically constant. Consider the history of the\nUnited States. Initially, the U.S. population was made largely of Protestant British\nwhite people and African black people. Adding people from other places required\nthat definitions be amended.\nWould Catholic Italians be considered \u201cWhite?\u201d In the past, many Americans\nwould have said no. For that matter, neither would the Irish (because of their\nCatholicism) or Jews (because they aren\u2019t Christian), but over time, these groups\nwere generally included into the white category. Whiteness broadened to include\nmore people. It became less of an ethnic category and more of a racial category.\nDefinitions of blackness evolved as well. In the American South, there\neventually arose a legal framework that defined blackness as having any African\nancestry. It would be possible (and relatively common) to be phenotypically white\nand legally black. Historically, mixed-race Creole people in Louisiana did not\nconsider themselves to be black or white; they were another category altogether.\nPeople attempting to emigrate from Asia, particularly China, were subject\nto their own set of exclusionary laws, which severely limited their migration to\nPage | 132 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nthe United States. As late as World War II, it was considered acceptable for the\ngovernment to intern (imprison) American citizens of Japanese descent over\nquestions of their racial origins and loyalty.\nOne of the current interesting ethnic questions in the United States is the status\nof Hispanic people in the existing racial categories. Since Hispanic is not itself a\nracial category, people within this ethnicity can choose what label they feel is most\nappropriate. It appears now that Hispanics are identifying themselves as white in\nthe U.S. census. This has an impact on projections for the future U.S. population.\nIf Hispanics identify as white, then the U.S. will remain majority white for quite\nsome time. If they do not, the U.S. will have no racial majority in a few decades.\nAlthough race and ethnicity in the U.S. were largely associated with state-\nmandated identification, restrictive laws, and onerous obligations, today both race\nand ethnicity are self-identified for the census. Whereas at one time being Irish\ncould be enough to deny someone employment, now it is a slogan to place on your\nwelcome mat and celebrate once a year in March.\n7.2.1 Racial Identifiers\nThe language used to identify racial groups has changed as well. For example,\nin broad terms of ethnicity, people of Asian descent who were born in the United\nStates are now referred to as Asian Americans, although the census racial category\nis still Asian. The term Asian implies a relationship with Asia and no relationship\nwith America. Asian American explicitly ties this group to America.\nPeople who trace their ancestry to Africa have a different problem. This problem\nis a function of American history. The first census label for this group was simply\nBlack. Over time other labels were used, such as Negro (which means black), and\neventually the term African American was adopted. This term is meant to provide\na relationship between a population of people and a place of origin. In other words,\nit explicitly ties a group to their ancestral origin.\nAlthough Native American is used in common speech in the U.S., the Census\ncategory is still American Indian, which is not the same as Indian-American\n(peoples associated with South Asia). The continued use of American Indian is\nsomewhat outside the trend toward more descriptive categories.\n7.2.2 Racism in the United States\nAlthough racism and ethnic discrimination are similar, they are not the\nsame thing. Although ethnic markers (generally) diminish over time, physical\ndifferences do not.\nExclusionary racial policies existed in the United States from the very beginning\nand have continued beyond the Jim Crow era of the twentieth century. From\nthe US Constitution that counted slaves as 3\/5 of a person to restrictive housing\ncovenants in the 1960s, the country has had a history of racism that did not\nend in the Civil Rights era. This exclusion has not solely been limited to African\nPage | 133 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nAmericans. Many groups have been subject to racist laws and acts. The indigenous\npeople of the United States were not fully considered citizens until 1924. In the\npast, voting rights, access to housing and even union membership had racialized\npolitics directed at many marginalized groups.\nThis is not to say that ethnically-based discrimination does not exist. Such\ndiscrimination has been prevalent in United States history, but it tends to subside\nas the host population absorbs the immigrant population.\n7.2.3 Housing\nHistorically, ethnic groups tended to live near one another in spatially\ncontiguous areas. Many cities have a Chinatown or Little Italy. These are known\nas ethnic enclaves. There are many reasons why groups cluster; some reasons\nare voluntary and some are not. In the United States, it was not uncommon for\ncities to restrict where African American citizens could live. These restrictions\nwere either through the force of law, or through unwritten behavioral norms that\nresisted renting or selling houses to African American families outside of certain\nareas. This residential, spatial segregation was accompanied with educational,\nsocial, and economic segregation. African American communities were often\nknown as ghettos, places where a certain population is forced to live. The word\nghetto is older than the United States itself. Ghetto was an Italian name for the\narea that Jews were forced to live in. Although the word is Italian, the idea of\nforcing minority populations to live in designated areas has unfortunately had\nwide historical appeal. Legal housing segregation ended in the United States in\n1968, but behaviors change more slowly than laws.\nMany ethnic communities have arisen from less coercive means. There are\nnumerous reasons that an ethnic community would choose to live close together.\nMutual support networks, the ability to develop schools and businesses catering\nto their own needs, a sense of safety, and the ability to retain their own cultural\nconnections are examples of positive reasons. Institutionalized poverty, marginalized\npolitical representation, and active discrimination are negative reasons.\n7.2.4 Environmental Justice\nOne of the spatial manifestations of racism and ethnic discrimination is the\ndifference in levels of political representation. Another one is the location of\nunpleasant environmental activities. Landfills and airports tend to be built in places\ninhabited by less-powerful groups, while dominant groups rarely if ever have to\norganize to prevent such things being built in their neighborhoods. Some groups\nfind their economic situations limited by underfunded schools or inadequate\ninfrastructure. The idea that different groups should have access to decent places\nto live called environmental justice.\nPage | 134 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.2.5 Ethnic diversity in the United States\nLike all predominantly immigrant countries, the United States is ethnically\ndiverse, but the range of ethnicities has varied over time as new groups arrive and\nprevious groups acculturate and eventually assimilate. A male of Italian descent in\nthe United States will sometimes just say, \u201cI\u2019m Italian.\u201d This may be a person who\nspeaks no Italian, isn\u2019t Catholic, and never been in Italy in his entire life. What\nthen, does this statement mean? It just signals an historic connection with an\nethnicity, even if the connection has faded over time. This isn\u2019t to single out Italian-\nAmericans. Generally, as groups assimilate, their distinctive ethnic markers fade.\nComparing Polish-Americans with Mexican-Americans may involve people who\nspeak the same language (English), have the same Catholic religion, and live very\nsimilar lifestyles. The label has faded to a marker, with food being the one of the\nlast cultural elements.\n7.2.6 Foodways\nOne of the ways groups demonstrate ethnicity is through food. One of the\nmost obvious hallmarks of the arrival of an ethnicity into the United States, or\nany other country, is the diffusion of a food from the group of origin. Pizza in the\nUnited States, curry in the United Kingdom, and doner kebab in Germany all\nexemplify the degree to which a food brought by immigrants can reach the status of\nadopted national cuisine. Food is also the cultural element that is most accessible\nto outsiders. Foodways are used to construct a spatial sense of one location as a\nreflection of the entire world.\nFoodways refer to the types of food that people eat, the ways they are prepared,\nand the cultural factors that surround and contextualize the food. Food is the most\nresilient cultural artifact. In countries undergoing language unification, foods can\ndefine ethnic groups. In mostly monolingual countries like the United States, foods\nmay indicate geographical origins or social class. Food is easily bought, tried and\naccepted, or rejected. As such, it is the most accessible cultural element.\nIn many ways, the consumption of a food and its production have been\ndivorced from its roots by the modern restaurant industry and international food\nconglomerates. Americans have eaten foods they consider Chinese or Mexican for\ngenerations, while few know the histories of said foods. Questions of whether or\nnot a food is authentic are difficult to answer when the cooks in a restaurant are of\na completely different ethnicity from the stated cuisine.\nWe can compare foodways between places and groups. Quantities of food, the\nratio of prepared foods, and consumption of tobacco and alcohol all help us get\ninside the lives of people in different places, at different states of technological\ndevelopment, and different socioeconomic classes.\nPage | 135 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.2.7 The Ethnic Landscape\nUrban ethnic landscapes are often immediately recognizable. Signs in other\nlanguages advertising exotic products, ethnic architecture, and even local tourism\nreveal the ethnic fabric of a place. Most people in the US do not live in large cities\nwith obvious ethnic architecture. The majority of Americans, including many\nethnicities, live in the suburbs and smaller towns. Instead of obvious population\nclusters, ethnic populations here can be widely dispersed. Instead of living within\nwalking distance of their local store or religious structure, people will simply drive\nto such a place. Ethnicity has sprawled along with the rest of America. Waves of\nmigration to U.S. cities and suburbs have created landscapes of tremendous ethnic\ndifference embedded in architectural homogeneity.\n7.2.8 Ethnic Festivals and the Idealized Homeland\nOne of the ways that ethnicities represent themselves is through festivals.\nPeople wear traditional clothing, play music from the old country, eat food\npreviously reserved for holidays, dance the old dances, and promote their\nculture to others. Festivals are a way of reproducing a sense of home in emigrant\ncommunities. They are also a way of keeping children participating in activities\nthat would otherwise forget.\nPlaces represented in ethnic festivals in the United States are often not\nrepresentative of those places now. Traditional Czech clothing at a Kolache\nFestival in Oklahoma represents a place\/time that no longer exists, except perhaps\nto market \u201cCzech-ness\u201d to tourists.\n7.3 ETHNICITIES IN THE UNITED STATES\nThe distribution of ethnicities in the United States follows patterns that have\nbeen in place for some time. Historic migrations (some of which were forced)\nproduced the patterns we still see in the United States.\n7.3.1 African Americans in the United States\nAfrican Americans in the United States are still heavily southern. Their\ndistribution (Figure 7.3) dates to the beginning of the United States and the forced\nimportation of millions of Africans. Starting in the early twentieth century, many\nAfrican Americans migrated out of this region, but most did not. In the last decades\nof the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, there has even been a\nreverse migration of African Americans back to Southern cities and suburbs.\nPage | 136 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nFigure 7.3 | The Distribution of the African American Population 3\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n7.3.2 Hispanics in the United States\nMany of the states with large Hispanic populations were states taken from\nMexico by the United States in the Mexican American War. In some ways, these\nplaces didn\u2019t come to the United States, the United States came to them. Certainly,\na pattern is apparent. Generally, the parts of the U.S. closest to Mexico or the\nCaribbean are the most Hispanic (Figure 7.4). There are other areas with high\nHispanic populations. These places have been attractive to immigrants for their\nemployment prospects.\n7.3.3 Asian Americans in the United States\nAsian Americans also have a distinctive distribution based in history. The\nwestern United States, and in particular, Hawaii, are physically the parts of the\nUnited States that are closest to Asia. A proximity effect similar to that of Hispanics\nis in play here. Figure 7.5 shows their distribution.\nPage | 137 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nFigure 7.4 | The Distribution of the Hispanic Population 4\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 7.5 | The Distribution of the Asian American Population 5\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 138 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.3.4 American Indian and Alaska Natives\nAt one time, all of the current territory was occupied by Native Americans. Due\nto the influence of disease, genocidal wars, and poverty they have been reduced\nto roughly 2 percent of the overall population of the United States. Some live on\nreservations, but most do not (Figure 7.6).\nFigure 7.6 | The Distribution of the American Indian Population 6\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n7.3.5 Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\nHawaii at one time had been an independent kingdom. Other\nterritories in the Pacific were taken during wars with other dominant\nregional powers. Many of these groups have migrated to the mainland of\nthe United States (Figure 7.7). In the same way that American Indians are\na minority in every state, Native Hawaiians are a minority in Hawaii.\nPage | 139 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nFigure 7.7 | The Distribution of the Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander Population 7\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n7.4 RELEVANCE OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN OTHER\nPLACES\nAlthough the social implications of race or ethnicity in the United States have\neroded over time, this does not mean that that is no longer relevant. It also does\nnot mean that ethnicity is not relevant anywhere else. In many places, it is still very\nimportant. In much the same way as race defined the early United States, it defined\nSouth Africa, Brazil and other settler colonies. There were important differences\nbetween these places. Whereas white people who made up the racial majority ruled\nthe United States, South Africa was ruled by a white racial minority. In order to\npreserve power for themselves, South African whites developed a system known\nas apartheid, which divided the population into a number of legally-defined\ncategories. Similar to the U.S. development of Indian reservations, the South\nAfrican state also developed ethnically-based \u201cHomelands\u201d which were used as a\nmeans of denying citizenship to black South Africans.\nSustaining such a system required the use of a police state that eventually\nbecame unsustainable. In 1994, full and open elections were held, and the black\nmajority gained political power. The state policy of separating people ended, but\nthis did not immediately transform South Africa into a new kind of state. It has\ncontinued to negotiate the relationship between the outside world and internal\npolitical and economic struggles between differing factions in the country.\nPage | 140 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nBrazilian society was far more racially mixed from the beginning. This simply\nchanged the social equation from a binary black\/white relationship to a society\nstratified by skin tone and migration status. As was the case in many colonies, people\nborn in the colonizing state (in this case, Portugal) continued to enjoy elevated social\nstanding well after the colonial era ended. In the same manner of the United States\nand South Africa, social standing was related to being part of the charter group.\nIn other places, purely ethnic differences have had violent consequences. In the\n1990s in Rwanda and in Yugoslavia, ethnic tensions flared into open warfare and\ngenocidal massacres. A new term was coined\u2014ethnic cleansing\u2014which denoted\nan attempt to complete expunge traces of another population from a place. In\nboth of these places, it would have been difficult for an outsider, and sometimes\neven a local, to tell the differences between the two groups. Remember that ethnic\ndifferences can be based on historical groups that may now be very similar.\nIt should be noted that the massacre of opposing ethnicities and the appropriation\nof their territories was not a product of the twentieth century. The colonial phase of\nworld history was largely defined by the massacre and marginalization of indigenous\npeople around the world by people of European descent.\n7.4.1 Ethnicities and Nationalities\nSome countries have only one ethnicity and are called nation-states (remember\nthat an ethnicity can also be called a nation) Most places are not like this and\ncontain many ethnicities. Some ethnicities are minorities solely by a political\nboundary. Many groups have found themselves on the wrong side of an imaginary\nline. Sometimes this is due to outside forces imposing a boundary, for example the\nHausa in Nigeria and Niger, but sometimes it is a product of state creation itself.\nWhen the state of Germany was created, there were pockets of ethnic Germans\nscattered all over Europe. It would have been impossible to incorporate them all,\nsince they were spatially discontiguous.\nIn the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), attempts were\nmade to make political boundaries match ethnic boundaries. Kazakh people had\nthe Kazakh SSR, Uzbek people had the Uzbek SSR, and so forth. It was an idea\nbased on ease of administration, but it wasn\u2019t based on the actual distribution of\nthe ethnic groups. The distributions were far too messy to draw clear, neat lines\nbetween them. This didn\u2019t matter as long as the USSR was still functioning, but\nwhen it collapsed, it created another landscape of minorities on the wrong side of\na boundary. Irredentism is when your ethnic group has people on the wrong side\nof a boundary, and it\u2019s necessarily destabilizing. The following chapter on political\ngeography will go into greater detail regarding this, but suffice it to say that split\nnations do not like being split.\nSome ethnicities are numerous, but find themselves minorities in several\ncountries. Kurds, Balochs (Figure 7.8), and Sami are all nations who are distributed\nacross several countries. Such groups often harbor strong desires to create their\nown independent political entities to the detriment of currently existing states.\nPage | 141 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nFigure 7.8 | Pakistan Major Ethnic Groups, 1980\nThis map details the politically fragmented spatiality of the Baloch people, separated into Iran, Pakistan, and\nAfghanistan.\nAuthor | U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nAs places unify politically and develop industrially, ethnicity often declines.\nMoving populations into cities and stirring them around in schools, militaries, and\njobs fosters intermarriage and acculturation to the larger, national norms. Rural\nplaces tend to be more diverse, and somewhere like Papua New Guinea is probably\nthe most diverse, due to the fact that smaller villages still predominate. Somewhere\nlike South Korea, which was already relatively ethnically homogenous, has become\nalmost fully so due to economic development.\n7.4.2 Is Diversity Good?\nDiversity in developed countries is often promoted as a self-evident benefit,\nbut there are some downsides to increasing diversity. Studies have shown that\nethnic diversity decreases political participation. This is likely due not only to\nfactors such as difficulties in communication, but also simple mistrust of other\ngroups of people, known as xenophobia. This mistrust can apply to all parties\nin the relationship. There are places in the world with very low levels of diversity.\nSouth Korea, Japan and Finland are all highly productive economies with very\nlittle cultural or ethnic variability and high levels of social cohesion.\nThere are benefits to diversity. Aside from the benefits to genetic diversity\n(a reduction in recessive-gene disorders) ethnic diversity opens citizens to a\nPage | 142 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\nwider range of experiences. Without pizza, sushi, tacos, stir-fry, or hamburgers,\nthe United States would be a cultural wasteland forced to subsist on our British\ninheritance of boiled lunch and steak and kidney pie. Diversity has made our lives\nmore pleasant, and it has made our ability to relate to others broader.\n7.4.3 Immigration and Ethnicity\nThe United States is not the only place to receive immigrants or to have ethnic\ndiversity. In fact, many places have far more ethnic diversity, even places that have\nlittle history of immigration. India, China, and Russia are all countries that have\nhad diverse populations speaking different languages and living different lifestyles\nfor a very long time.\nIn many ways, the impact of immigration on the ethnic fabric in Europe\nis the same as it has been in the United States. Due to the relative strength of\ntheir economies, European countries have been receiving large numbers of\nimmigrants for some time. These immigrants are usually culturally distinct from\nthe host population. In many instances, the immigrants come from places that had\npreviously been colonies of European powers. The increase in immigrants with\nbackgrounds dissimilar to the host country has triggered a rise in nationalistic\nor xenophobic activities, and in some places, a rise in political parties dedicated\nto reducing immigration or even repatriating current immigrants. The separate\ncategory of guest worker has created an even more complicated ethnic relationship.\nGuest workers are temporary workers who are contracted for a set period of time\nwith the understanding that they will leave when the period of work has ended.\nBy and large, that is not what happens due to the economic realities of short-term\nemployment. People are reluctant to return to poverty.\n7.4.4 Models of Ethnicity\nDifferent places have different conceptions of ethnicity. In the United States,\nwe separate race from ethnicity, and we have exhaustive lists of ethnicities\ncollected by the census. France collects neither racial nor ethnic data, under the\nbelief that every French citizen is ethnically French. This doesn\u2019t include linguistic\nminorities such as the Bretons, the Basques or the Alsatians, all of whom are\nindigenous to France and whose ideas about their own ethnicities are different\nfrom that of the state.\nIn other places, ethnic identity is the most significant impediment to state\ncohesion. In Nigeria, no less a person than Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka\nwrote,\u201d There is no such thing as a Nigerian.\u201d He wasn\u2019t saying that Nigerians are\na figment of the imagination. He was stating that in his country, few people would\nidentify first as a Nigerian, but instead as Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa or many others.\nThis is another concept that will be addressed in the next chapter.\nPage | 143 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ETHNICITY AND RACE\n7.5 SUMMARY\nEthnicity is key to our identity. It can be formed around a variety of nuclei-\nhistorical ties, national origin, language, religion, or any admixture thereof.\nEthnicity creates a feeling of belonging to a group. Ethnicity, of course can also be\na source of exclusion to those who do not belong to the group that holds power in a\nplace. Discrimination and prejudice often have a root in ethnicity, although other\nfactors, like economics generally play a part as well. Race (and racism) are closely\nrelated to ethnicity, in that both ethnicity and race have been used to separate\npeople, and some ethnicities can be associated with particular races. The next\nchapter also deals somewhat with human identity and delves further into nations\nand nationality.\n7.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAcculturation: Cultural change, generally the reconciliation of two or more culture groups.\nDiscrimination: Mistreatment due to perceived difference.\nDiversity: Having a range of different people.\nEnclave: Self-enforced separation for a racial or ethnic group.\nEnvironmental Justice: The concept that environmental benefits and burdens should\nbe equally shared across different socio-economic groups.\nEthnic cleansing: An attempt to complete expunge or remove traces of another\npopulation from a place.

These facts deal with the subdiscipline of political geography\nbecause they show how politics is reflected on the surface of the Earth, but political\ngeography is much more than a \u201ctrivial pursuit\u201d of such information. Although\nhaving knowledge about the locations of countries and states is fundamental and\nan important foundation for the study of political geography, the subject matter\ndeals with many other topics such as military and economic alliances, boundaries\nbetween countries, terrorism and other civil-military conflicts, and the geography\nof the electoral process.\n8.2 HOW POLITICAL SPACE IS ORGANIZED\nThe fundamental unit of political space is the state, and this type of state\nis different than the states that make up the United States. A state is basically\nsynonymous to a country and represents a formal region in which the government\nhas sovereignty or control of its own affairs within its territorial boundaries. The\nnumber of states in the world is currently 196, but this number changes through\nmilitary conquests or the devolution, or breakup, of states. For example, the United\nKingdom has devolved over the past 70 years as the Republic of Ireland has broken\naway from the UK, and a new referendum may occur in the next few years to decide\nwhether or not Scotland will become independent. Another prime example of the\ncreation of new states occurred after the breakup of the Soviet Union, when fifteen\nstates were created in Eastern Europe. Even a terrorist group, the Islamic State,\nhas tried to establish its own state in portions of Syria and Iraq, even though their\nlegitimacy is not recognized by the international community.\nStates in which the territorial boundaries encompass a group of people with\na shared ethnicity are known as nation-states. These states are generally\nhomogeneous in terms of the cultural and historical identity of the people, and\nthese groups of people are referred to as a nation. A few current examples of\nnation-states are Japan, Finland, and Egypt. Nation-states are actually in the\nminority compared to multinational states, which are states that have more than\none nation within their borders. With international migration being a significant\nphenomenon worldwide, more states become multinational. In contrast, some\nnations exist but do not have their own state, and those nations that desire to\nbecome nation-states are known as stateless nations. In the United States, a\nprime example of stateless nations are the many Native American tribes scattered\nthroughout the countries. Other examples include the Palestinians living in Israel,\nSyria, Lebanon and Jordan, and the Kurds found in Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Iran\n(Figure 8.1). Both the Kurds and the Palestinians are actively seeking statehood,\nbut serious obstacles must be overcome because the countries where they live are\nreluctant to grant them independent territories.\nPage | 148 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nFigure 8.1 | Kurd-majority areas in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran\nAuthor | U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nThe solidarity and unity of a state is influenced by both centripetal and\ncentrifugal forces. Centripetal forces tend to bind a state together, and\ncentrifugal forces act to break up a state. Examples of centripetal forces include\nnationalism, economic prosperity, and strong, ethical security forces. Centrifugal\nforces include wars, ineffective or corrupt governments, and market failure. Other\nfactors that can influence the solidarity of a state include types of boundaries,\nethnic differences (which may result in unity or discord), and the compactness of\na state.\nThe compactness of a state is related to the shape of a state, and a compact\nstate is one that is ideally circular in shape, where the distance from the center\nto any border is roughly equal. In contrast, a fragmented state is one that is\ndiscontinuous in nature and may consist of a number of islands. A few examples of\nfragmented states include Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia consists of over\n17,000 islands, and in order to increase the solidarity of the state, the government\nactively encouraged migration to less populated islands in order to assimilate\nindigenous populations. In the Philippines, control of its southern islands such as\nMindanao is problematic because of terrorist groups that are active in those areas.\nPage | 149 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\n8.3 COOPERATION BETWEEN STATES\nIn order to provide shared military and economic security as a unified entity,\nstates engage in alliances. Military alliances help protect states from common\nenemies, and economic alliances allow for the free exchange of goods in a larger\nmarket. These alliances are also referred to as supranational organizations, and\nthey all involve states giving up some of their sovereign power for the common good.\nThe largest supranational organization in the world is the United Nations\n(UN). Formed originally as the League of Nations after World War II, the UN now\nincludes 193 states. The work of the UN includes peacekeeping, humanitarian\nrelief, and the establishment of internationally approved standards of behavior.\nThe headquarters of the UN is in New York City, and important subsidiary\norganizations of the UN include the World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO\n(United Nations Educational, Cultural and Cultural Organization) and the Food\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n8.3.1 Military Alliances - NATO and Warsaw Pact\nIn terms of military alliances on a regional scale, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) comprises 28 states and was developed after World War II\nto counter the threat of the former Soviet Union. Member states include numerous\nWestern European states as well as the United States and Canada (Figure 8.2.).\nFigure 8.2 | Current NATO map and former Warsaw Pact\nAuthor | User \u201cAlphathon\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 150 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nWhen the Soviet Union existed, the Warsaw Pact was a military alliance between\nthe Soviet Union and seven satellite states of Eastern and Central Europe (Figure\n8.2). The Warsaw Pact disbanded in 1991, and several of the former Soviet states\nas well as satellite states have subsequently joined NATO. As a result, Russia has\nfelt isolated and vulnerable, and as a result, has been aggressively acting to seize or\ncontrol territories in states close to its borders.\nFor example, in 2008, Russia engaged in a military conflict in Georgia, one\nof the former Soviet states, in order to support a separatist movement allied with\nRussia. In 2014, Russia invaded the peninsula of Crimea, within the territorial\nboundaries of Ukraine, one of the former states in the Soviet Union. Furthermore,\nRussia has intervened militarily against the rebel forces fighting in eastern Ukraine.\nIn response to these provocations, NATO commenced Operation Atlantic Resolve,\nan ongoing series of training exercises between the United States and other NATO\ncountries in former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland, Romania, and Latvia.\n8.3.2 Military Alliances \u2013 Terrorism\nAlthough terrorists are characterized as non-military, non-state actors, they\nhave a tremendous impact on states around the world and involve allied groups\nin many countries. Terrorism is the intimidation of a population by violence in\norder to further political aims. The first terrorist group with global influence is Al\nQaeda, formed in 1988 by Osama bin Laden. Although its influence has waned\nin the past decade, Al Qaeda was responsible for the 9\/11 attacks and had several\naffiliates including Boko Haram in Nigeria and Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines. With\nthe rise of the Islamic State (ISIS\/L) in Iraq and Syria in 2013, terrorist groups\nsuch as Boko Haram and Abu Sayyaf have consequently declared allegiance to\nISIS\/L. ISIS\/L is an extremist Muslim group that intends to seize as much territory\nas possible in the Middle East and force their subjects to adhere to their strict\nversion of Islamic fundamentalism. To facilitate their goal, ISIS\/L conducts an\nextensive campaign on social media to recruit fighters to come to Syria and also\nconduct individual attacks in their home country. Their media campaign has been\nsuccessful in recruiting numerous militants to come to Syria and to inspire or\ninstigate attacks in the United States, France, Belgium, England, Sweden, Turkey,\nAfghanistan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Figure 8.3). Furthermore, ISIS\/L is\nconducting regular military operations in Libya and Egypt.\nTo combat the Islamic State and other terrorist groups, interesting military\nalliances have developed, and the situation is exceptionally complex. The United\nStates cooperates with numerous NATO allies to train and equip local military\nforces in Iraq and Syria. Iran, in alliance with Iraq, has provided assistance in\ndriving ISIS\/L out of Iraq. Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and Syria, in concert\nwith NATO forces, have conducted much of the military action, and they hope for\nan independent state because of these efforts. Complicating this situation is the\nobjection of the central governments of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey to an independent\nKurdish state. Further clouding the situation is the alliance between Russia and\nPage | 151 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nthe Syrian central government. Although these two countries do fight against\nISIS\/L, they are also opposed to other Syrian rebel forces, which the United States\nsupports. The problem of ISIS\/L propaganda is being addressed by numerous\ngovernments and social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\nMore importantly, though, military success on the ground against ISIS\/L forces in\nIraq and Syria is decreasing the influx of foreign fighters as well as the proliferation\nof internet propaganda.\nAttacks by ISIS Attacks inspired by ISIS\nCountries in DARK GRAY are where ISIS has claimed provinces.\nFigure 8.3 | Map of ISIS\/L global influence 1\nAuthor | Corey Parson\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n8.3.3 Economic Alliances \u2013 European Union and NAFTA\nOne of the most prominent economic alliances in the world is the European\nUnion (EU), which consists of 28 member states (Figure 8.4). What began as the\nEuropean Community (EC) in 1958, the European Union has grown significantly\nfrom the original six members and now includes seven Eastern European states\nthat were formerly in the Soviet Union. The EU has developed a common currency,\nthe euro, for all member countries and a European Central Bank. Furthermore, at\nmost boundaries, a passport is not required to enter another country.\nOne of the weaknesses of the EU is the need to subsidize poorer countries,\ncreating financial difficulties for the more wealthy members. For example, Greece\nhas experienced large debts that have required rescue funding from the EU. Another\nissue confronting the EU is whether or not to allow Turkey to join, as Greece has\nlong-standing disputes with Turkey over territory in Cyprus, and the Turkish\ncentral government has been accused of anti-democratic practices. Perhaps most\nconcerning for the EU is the imminent departure of the United Kingdom (UK)\nPage | 152 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nfrom the alliance in an action termed\n\u201cBrexit.\u201d In 2016, the UK voted by\nreferendum to leave the EU, and is\non schedule to formally break away in\n2019. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the\nEU is not solely related to economics,\nas not only is the EU an economic\nalliance, but agreements on social\nand political policies are involved as\nwell. The majority of British citizens\nare generally against the subsidizing\nof poorer states and the increasing\nnumber of immigrants who use scare\npublic resources, and they generally\ndesire greater autonomy. With the exit\nFigure 8.4 | European Union\nof Britain from the EU, EU members\nAuthor | U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\nare concerned that other states may Source | Wikimedia Commons\nfollow suit. License | Public Domain\nAn important economic alliance for the United States is the North American\nFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Established in 1992, this alliance integrates the\nUnited States, Mexico and Canada and facilitates the flow of goods and services\nacross borders. The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized this agreement,\nas manufacturers have relocated production to Mexico which has resulted in the\nloss of manufacturing jobs in America. Whether or not the United States withdraws\nfrom NAFTA or simply renegotiates the agreement remains to be seen.\nAnother significant alliance that is being considered is the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, an agreement between 11 countries that border the Pacific Ocean,\nand originally included the United States. The proposal was signed in February\n2017, but the United States had already withdrawn from the agreement in\nJanuary of the same year, making ratification virtually impossible. The goal of\nthe agreement is to promote economic prosperity by lowering tariff barriers, but\nalso promote environmental and labor protections as well as protect intellectual\nproperty. Critics say that it would result in the loss of U.S. jobs and weaken the\nsovereignty of the U.S.\n8.4 BOUNDARIES AND BOUNDARY DISPUTES\n\u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d\n-Robert Frost\nAs mentioned in Section 13.4, boundaries can influence the solidarity of a\nstate, as boundaries disputes can result in conflict. A boundary is essentially\nPage | 153 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nan invisible, vertical plane that separates one state from another, so it includes\nboth the airspace above the line on the surface and the ground below. Boundaries\ncan be both physical and anthropogenic, and while it is difficult to categorize all\nboundaries, some prominent boundary types exist.\nPhysical boundaries are natural features on the landscape such as rivers,\nlakes, and mountains. The Rio Grande is an important physical boundary on\nthe southern border of the United States. Like most rivers, the Rio Grande shifts\ngradually (and sometimes abruptly) through time. As a result of the fact that the\ncourse of a river is not fixed, a river boundary can be problematic. In fact, because\nof the gradual shift in the Rio Grande in the vicinity of El Paso, the United States\nand Mexico established the Chamizal Treaty which reestablished the boundary\nand included a more permanent relocation of the river channel by engineering\n(Figure 8.5). Some examples of mountain ranges as boundaries include the\nZagros Mountains between Iraq and Iran, the Pyrenees between Spain and France,\nand the Andes Mountains between Chile and Argentina.\nFigure 8.5 | Chamizal Treaty map\nAuthor | Mike Hayes\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nIn contrast to physical boundaries, geometric boundaries and ethnic\nboundaries are not related to natural features. Instead, in the case of geometric\nboundaries, they are straight lines. These straight lines could coincide with latitude\nor longitude, as is the case with the northwestern boundary of the United States\nwith Canada along 49o north latitude. Likewise, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea\nis separated by another geometric boundary along the 141st meridian.\nFor ethnic boundaries, they are drawn based on a cultural trait, such as\nwhere people share a language or religion. The border between India, which is\nPage | 154 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\npredominantly Hindu, and Pakistan, which is predominantly Muslim, is one\nexample. Some borders split ethnic groups that are more closely related to the\npeople on the other side of the border. For example, in eastern Ukraine, the\nmajority of the population speaks Russian and is sympathetic to Russians on\nthe other side of the border. As a result, the current conflict between Russia and\nUkraine has been problematic for the Ukrainian central government because of the\nRussian affiliation with eastern Ukraine. Russian influence in eastern Ukraine is\nan example of irredentism, or an effort to expand political influence of a state on\na group of people in a neighboring state.\nAnother prime example of where boundaries do not coincide closely with ethnic\ngroups is in Africa. Almost 50 percent of the boundaries in Africa are geometric,\nand at least 177 ethnic groups are split in two or more states. If all ethnic groups\nin Africa were to be enclosed in their own boundaries, Africa would have over\n2,000 countries (1). Because ethnic groups straddle many boundaries in Africa,\nthis situation has led to considerable cross-border trade, but also has created\nnumerous conflicts. For instance, several wars have occurred because the Somali\nethnic group is split between five different countries.\n8.5 THE ELECTORAL PROCESS\n8.5.1 Gerrymandering\nIn the United States, boundaries play an important role in the electoral process,\nbut in this case, district, and precinct boundaries are significant in contrast to the\ncountry boundaries that have been previously discussed. Political parties in power\nwill sometimes rearrange the boundaries of voting districts in order to ensure\nvictory in elections, and this practice is called gerrymandering. Gerrymandering\nstrategies can involve drawing the boundaries so that the majority of voters in a\ndistrict favor the party in power. Another method is to segregate the opposition\nvoters into several different districts\n(Figure 8.6). While gerrymandering\nis not generally illegal in the United\nStates, it can be challenged in court\nwhen it appears to clearly discriminate\nagainst minority populations. For\nexample, when legislative districts\nwhere redrawn in 2015 in Gwinnett\nand Henry counties in Georgia, the\nNAACP filed a federal lawsuit because\nof the perception that the adjustment\nviolated the rights of minority black\nvoters. A 2013 Supreme Court decision, Figure 8.6 | Gerrymandering Methods\nAuthor | Steven Nass\nhowever, declared that a requirement\nSource | Urban Milwaukee\nin the 1965 Voting Rights Act for License | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 155 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nfederal oversight of redistricting is not constitutional, and this decision may have\nan impact on such lawsuits.\n8.5.2 Presidential Elections\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of political geography in the United States\nis presidential elections and how the Electoral College process has a decidedly\nspatial component. An examination of the presidential results from the 2016\nelection reveals interesting regional affiliations (Figure 8.7). Northeastern and\nMid-Atlantic states, as well as far Western states, all tended to vote Democrat,\nwhile the rest of the electoral map is Republican. Although it appears that the\nRepublican victory was decisive from a spatial and Electoral College perspective,\nfrom the standpoint of the popular vote, Democrats actually had more votes\nthan Republicans. The dichotomy is explained by the very large populations in\nboth California and New York, predominantly Democrat states. California\u2019s large\npopulation is reflected in a high number (55) of Electoral College votes, more than\nany other state.\n3\n8 NH 4\n1 VT 3 3\n3 3 1\n7 10\n4 3 10 29 MA 11\n3 16\nRI 4\n5 6 20 CT 7\n6 18\n6 20 11 NJ 14\n55 9 6 10 8 5 13 MD DE 13 0\nDC 3\n15\n11\n11 7\n5 6 9 Clinton\n6 9 16 Trump\n36 1 1 8 Powell\nSpotted Eagle\n3 29\nPaul\nKasich\n3\n1 Sanders\nFigure 8.7 | Presidential Election of 2016\nAuthor | User \u201cGage\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nAnother marked trend in the voting map is evident when the election results\nare examined by county (Figure 8.8). Ethnic groups tend to vote in particular\nvoting blocks, and the impact of ethnic groups can be seen more clearly by looking\nat individual counties. For example, a crescent of blue (Democrat) can be seen\nrunning through south-central Alabama and into eastern Mississippi. African\nAmericans tend to vote Democrat, and these blue counties contain predominantly\nAfrican American voters.\nPage | 156 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nSimilarly, the blue counties in western Mississippi have a majority African\nAmerican population. Another example of the influence of ethnic groups is evident\nin extreme southern Texas. Hispanics generally vote Democrat, and most counties\nin southern Texas are dominated by Hispanics.\nFigure 8.8 | 2016 Presidential Election by County\nAuthor | Users \u201cAli Zifan\u201d and \u201cInqvisitor\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nRelated to ethnic affiliations by county is the trend for rural voters to lean\ntoward Republican and urbanites to vote Democrat. Rural areas tend to have\nwhite majorities, and whites tend to vote Republican. Rural voters also have lower\nnumbers of college graduates compared to urban areas. In the 2016 presidential\nelection in both Georgia and Texas, urban counties tended to vote Democrat, and\nrural counties went to the Republicans. With increasing urbanization and diversity\nin the United States, the electoral map will continue to undergo significant changes\nin the future.\n8.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nBoundary \u2013 an invisible, vertical plane that separates one state from another, which\nincludes both the airspace above the line on the surface and the ground below.\nCentripetal force \u2013 a force that tends to bind a state together.\nCentrifugal force \u2013 a force that tends to break a state apart.\nCompact state \u2013 a state where the distance from the center to any border does not vary\nsignificantly; roughly circular.\nPage | 157 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nEthnic boundary \u2013 a boundary that encompasses a particular ethnic group.\nFragmented state \u2013 a state whose territory is not contiguous, but consists of isolated\nparts such as islands.\nGeometric boundary \u2013 a boundary that follows a straight line and may coincide with a\nline of latitude or longitude.\nGerrymandering \u2013 the process of redrawing legislative districts in order to benefit the\nparty in power and ensure victory in elections.\nIrredentism \u2013 an effort to expand the political influence of a state on a group of people\nin a neighboring state.\nMulti-national state \u2013 state that has more than one nation within their borders.\nNation \u2013 group of people bonded by cultural attributes such as language, ethnicity and\nreligion.\nNation-state \u2013 state in which the territorial boundaries encompass a group of people\nwith a shared ethnicity.\nPhysical boundary \u2013 a boundary that follows a natural feature on the landscape such as\na river, mountain range, or lake.\nState \u2013 a formal region in which the government has sovereignty or control of its own\naffairs within its territorial boundaries.\nStateless nation \u2013 a nation that aspires to become a nation-state but does not yet have\ntheir own territory.\nSupranational organization \u2013 an alliance involving three or more states who have\nshared objectives that may be economic, political\/military, or cultural.\nTerrorism \u2013 intimidation of a population by violence in order to further political aims.\n8.7 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAcemoglu, Daron, and James A.

Would\nyou choose a place with mountains or with beaches? A place with high taxes or few\nregulations? Do you love your community\/state\/country? Could you make more\nmoney somewhere else or might you be happier with warmer\/colder weather? Do\nyou think that you are able to realize your full personal potential in the place where\nyou live now? Why or why not? Your answers might vary greatly from other people\naround the world based upon what language you speak, your religious preferences,\nyour cultural framework, and your own persona values. Nonetheless, there are\ncertain indicators that geographers can use to categorize places according to how\ndeveloped they are in terms of technology, infrastructure, wealth, and opportunity.\nAs you might guess, the differences between places can be quite stark, but it\u2019s\nimportant to understand the dynamics and geography of the patterns and processes\nassociated with income, well-being, and opportunity. This chapter explains how\nthose distinctions are made and how they vary across time and place using the\nconcept of development (the processes related to improving people\u2019s lives through\naccess to resources, technology, education, wealth, opportunity, and choice).\nWhich places on earth are the most developed? There is no simple answer to\nthis question. San Francisco is often voted as the most beautiful city in the U.S.\nbut the cost of living makes this place unaffordable for all but the wealthiest of\nresidents. Ancient cities like Jerusalem, Athens, and Baghdad contain amazing\narchitecture and the roots of western civilization, but streets also tend to be narrow\nand housing crowded. China has experienced the fastest economic growth of any\nother country in the past 30 years, but it is accompanied by catastrophic levels\nof air pollution, poor working conditions, and severe limits on personal liberty.\nWithin the United States, people in Colorado tend to be the healthiest while those\nin Utah have the largest houses and people in Texas are the most loyal to their\nhome state. There are multiple ways to measure development, and geographers\nspend a great deal of time and effort studying, measuring, and quantifying the\ndifferences and commonalities.\nA few general truths about development and wealth in our 21st century world\ncan simplify the complexity:\n1. The world continues to be divided into the Global North and Global\nSouth by the Brandt Line (See Figure 9.1). Levels of wealth, well-\nbeing, access to technology, and health tend to be higher in northern\ncountries than in southern ones. The line is problematic because\nit over-generalizes, but it remains a meaningful starting point to\nunderstanding development from a global scale.\n2. The majority of people living in the 21st century have a higher standard\nof living, earn more money, are healthier, and live longer than was the\ncase for people 50 years ago.\nPage | 161 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\n3. In spite of #2, the wealth disparity between those at the bottom and\nthose at the top remains greater than ever before. According to Credit\nSuisse\u2019s global wealth report, the globe\u2019s richest 1% (of people) control\nmore than half of the world\u2019s wealth, up from 42.5% in 2008.\nFigure 9.1 | The Global North as defined by the Brandt Line in 1980\nAuthor | User \u201cJovan.gec\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n9.2 IMPORTANT TERMS & CONCEPTS\nPeople in more developed countries (MDC) and less developed\ncountries (LDC) experience the world very differently, but let\u2019s think about the\nmeaning of such terms. MDC\u2019s tend to have higher incomes, levels of technology,\ninfrastructure development, and life expectancies while LDC\u2019s tend to have lower\nlevels of those and other indicators. The simplest measure to consider is income.\nThe World Bank (more on this institution later in the chapter) places countries\ninto 4 categories. In 2017, low-income economies were defined as those with a\ngross national income (GNI) per capita, of $1,025 or less in 2016; lower\nmiddle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,026and\n$4,035; upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between\n$4,036 and $12,475; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of\n$12,476 or more. The map in Figure 9.2 displays the general geographic patterns\nassociated with the 4 categories. Take a moment to look at the map to see if any of\nthe countries or regions surprise you. For example, are all African countries in the\nsame category? What about countries in Latin America or Asia? Which country is\nin a higher category, China or Russia?\nPage | 162 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nThe world by income, FY2017\n(current US dollar, Atlas method)\nLow income ($1,025 or less) G(rDeeennl.a)nd\nLower middle income ($1,026\u2013$4,035)\nU H Np i og\nF\np dh\niS\nje a\ni\ni ar n t mam co oid amd el Te AS(\no\n$ mai nn 1\nme\ngc 2\nro\nao , iK ca4m\na\ni7 (r nU6 ie b\n.\no a S($ tr .)i 4 m,0 o3 r6 e\u2013 ) P$ o1 l2 yFn, r4 ee7 ns5 ciah)\n(rF.)

For more information see https:\/\/datahelpdesk\n.worldbank.org\/knowledgebase\/articles\/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups.\nFigure 9.2 | Income Categories for Countries as Defined by the World Bank in 2017\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nNow that you have pondered these categories and spatial patterns, let\u2019s take\na step back. What exactly is meant by Gross National Income per capita? It\nis the sum of a nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and the net income\nit receives from overseas. GDP includes all of the goods and services produced\nwith a country in a given year and is calculated according to the following formula:\nConsumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net exports. So if a\ngovernment increases spending on the military or on road construction in a given\nyear that will increase GDP (and GNI). If a country imports a lot of things but\ndoesn\u2019t export many things, it will decrease that country\u2019s GDP (and GNI). Finally,\nif consumers buy a lot of alcohol for New Year\u2019s Eve, that will also increase GDP\n(and GNI). GNI also includes income derived outside of the country by members\nof the country. For example, Coca Cola, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, earns\nprofits in 200 different countries around the world. Those profits outside of the\nU.S. are not included in GDP, but they are included in GNI. It\u2019s a little confusing,\nbut this measure provides a valuable way to compare economic outputs between\nmultiple countries and is the metric that is most often used in recent years. The\ntotal GNI for a country is divided by the total population of that country to arrive\nat a per capita figure, which includes children, the elderly, those imprisoned,\netc. So, the figure of $12,476 does NOT mean that the average adult earns that\namount annually as income, but rather it represents total income and economic\noutput divided by the total population. Take a look at the cartogram in Figure\n9.3, which shows countries represented, not by their physical size, but by the size\nof their respective GNI. Table 11.2 shows the top 15 countries by GNI, with the\nPage | 163\nynamreG eniarkU\nairagluB INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nFigure 9.3 | Gross National Income by Country\nAuthor | \u00a9 Copyright Worldmapper.org \/ Benjamin D. Hennig\nSource | WorldMapper\nLicense | CC BY NC ND 4.0\nUnited States ranked at the top and China second. The next table shows countries\nranked according to GNI per capita (per person). Notice how the list of the top 15\ncountries changes dramatically. Can you think of reasons to explain why this might\nbe? First, small oil-producing countries tend to have high incomes that are spread\nacross a small population (e.g. Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Brunei). Second,\ncountries with high incomes, high exports, and few children (e.g. Singapore and\nSwitzerland) have high GNI. Third, certain small countries attract very wealthy\nmember of society to live there in order to avoid paying higher tax rates elsewhere\n(e.g. Switzerland, Isle of Man, and Bermuda).\nThe difference between GNI and GNI per capita tends to be more pronounced\nin large, highly populated countries. The U.S. and China, for example, are the\ntop two countries for total GNI, but neither appears in the top 15 for GNI per\ncapita, in which the U.S. ranks 18th ($58,700 per person) and China drops all\nthe way to 103 ($15,500 per person). A final important term useful to understand\neconomic differences is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The PPP accounts\nfor differences in the cost of living and goods between 2 places to allow for a more\nmeaningful comparison. Think about it this way. If you earned $60,000 per year in\nNew York City or in Lincoln, Nebraska, where would your salary be more valuable?\nMost items are cheaper in Lincoln, so your salary would be worth more there than\nin NYC. Similarly, the cost of living in Mexico is much lower than in Sweden, so\nthe PPP figures in Table 11.1 account for such differences. If you are considering\na move, you can check on salary equivalencies here: http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/\ncalculator\/pf\/cost-of-living\/index.html.\nPage | 164 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nFigure 9.4 | Gross National Income & Gross National Income per capita (PPP) in 2016\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\n9.3 GLOBAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL\nPATTERNS\n9.3.1 How Fast Does the Global Economy Grow and How\nMuch Money Is There in the World?\nWith 78 of the world\u2019s more than 200 countries and territories categorized\nby the World Bank as high and 64 are low or lower middle income, it is tempting\nto believe that wealth distribution might be relatively balanced in the world.\nAfter all, more people than ever are connected to the global economy. Instead,\ninequalities have been exacerbated by global capitalism in recent years. Jeff Bezos,\nthe founder of Amazon, has a net worth of $105 billion, a figure that is larger than\nthe annual GDP of 150 countries! Meanwhile, 800 million people earn less than\n$2.00 per day. Such click-bait worthy headlines, while fascinating, can also be\nmisleading. Thirty-five percent of the world lived in extreme poverty in 1990. By\n2013 that figure dropped to 11%, representing a shift of nearly 1.1 billion people\nout of extreme poverty. Nonetheless, economic differences between most wealthy\ncountries compared to most poor countries have widened over that same period\nrather than narrowed.\nThe number of those entering the formal economy rose dramatically during that\ntime period, so categorizing somebody as not in \u2018extreme poverty\u2019 simply because\nthey earn more than $2.00 a day is also quite problematic. The majority of those\nthat rose out of extreme poverty were in just two countries (India or in China),\nwhere hundreds of millions of people left unpaid work on subsistence farms and\nmoved to cities, where they earned just a little bit of money. Does that make a\nPage | 165 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\ncountry more developed or a person better off? In economic terms, the answer is\nyes, but in more qualitative terms, the answer is not quite so clear.\nThe global economy has grown persistently since 1960 as evidenced by Figure\n9.5, with the most dramatic growth occurring since 2000. As a matter of fact,\nglobal GDP nearly doubled between 2002 ($34.6 trillion) and 2016 ($76 trillion)!\nSo it took all of the economies of the planet tens of thousands of years to go from\nzero to $34 trillion, but then only 14 years to double that figure. Hmmm. Does this\nrepresent sustainable development \u2013 one that can continue into the future?\nMoreover, can the planet handle the effects of continued growth, consumption,\nCO2 emissions, and water pollution across the world at such a persistent growth\nrate? Such questions are difficult to assess and will be dealt with more substantially\nin the last chapter of this text. For now, it\u2019s important simply to understand that\neconomic growth is just one of many indicators used to understand development\nand well-being, and the implications for economic growth come with complications.\nFinally, economic growth across the planet is uneven and difficult to predict. In\nspite of what appears to be a fairly even upward movement in global GDP, one\nFigure 9.5 | Gross Domestic Product 1960-2016 in current US$\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nPage | 166 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\ncan see more clearly the complex nature of GDP growth in Figure 9.5 that shows\nthe wild changes in growth that vary dramatically by place and time. In the 20\nyears from 1996-2016, Russia (an upper tier country) experienced many years of\nnegative growth, while Rwanda (a lowest tier country) experienced rates of growth\nup to 14%, much higher than that of any other country. U.S. growth was negative in\n2009 and has hovered around 2-3% in subsequent years. China\u2019s annual growth,\nthat had averaged 12% for several years dropped to around 7%, where it is expected\nto remain into the 2020\u2019s.\nThe most basic spatial patterns of wealth and income can be easily observed in\nthe maps and figures presented thus far in this chapter. Wealthier countries tend\nto be those in the Global North (North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, New\nZealand), while poorer countries tend to be in the Global South (everywhere else).\nHowever, such generalizations are problematic in truly understanding wealth and\nwell-being around the planet. Let\u2019s take a brief look at Latin America, for example.\nMexico, by most accounts, is considered a developing country (another name\nfor \u2018less developed country\u2019 that is on a pathway to improving). It falls south of the\nBrandt line, and is considered poor by most American standards. However, its per\ncapita income places it in the top third of all countries and its economy is the 15th\nlargest in the world. Carlos Slim, once the wealthiest person in the world, is Mexican\nand its economic performance far outpaces all of its neighboring countries to the\nsouth. The difference in economic indicators between Mexico and Haiti, for example,\nis greater than the difference between Mexico and the U.S. As such, it\u2019s important to\nbe wary of simplistic categorization schemes in terms of wealth and development.\nMoreover, in recent decades dozens of newly industrialized countries\n(NIC\u2019s) have emerged that have reached or approached MDC status. Such places\nhave moved away from agriculture-based economies to more industrial, service,\nand information-based systems. One example is a group of places known as the\nAsian Tigers or Asian Dragons (Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and\nTaiwan), where massive investment in infrastructure and education facilitated\nan equally massive transformation of the economy in a very short period of time.\nSouth Korea, for example, lay in ruins at the climax of its civil war (1953), but\nhas miraculously risen to a level of wealth similar to that of Italy. Another group\nof countries termed the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)\nfall outside of the Global North, but have experienced dramatic economic growth,\nraising its collective share of the global economy from 11% to 30% in just 25 years.\nThose countries continue to wield more political power in direct relation to the rise\nin economic might, and this could shift the economic, social, and political landscape\nof the world in the coming decades. Another group of NIC\u2019s are the oil-rich Gulf\nStates of Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and possibly a\nfew others. Such entities have accumulated massive amounts of wealth as a result\nof absolute advantage, the abundance of rare and high-valued commodities.\nOther countries enjoy absolute advantage due to climatic conditions for growing\ncoffee, tobacco, tropical fruit, etc. The high price of oil and its concentrated supply,\nPage | 167 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nhowever, have facilitate massive economic growth in places that were traditionally\npoor and less developed than in recent years. Perhaps you are familiar with some\nof the recent development projects in this region of the world. The tallest building\nin the world (Burj Khalifa) and the world\u2019s most ambitious set of artificial island\nconstruction projects are both located in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Figure\n9.6) as evidence of the Gulf States development efforts in the 21st century.\nFigure 9.6 | Annual Growth Rates in GDP, selected countries, 1996-2016\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nIn spite of the obvious wealth benefits that accrue in oil-rich or other resource-\nladen countries, they can also suffer what\u2019s termed the Resource Curse (aka\nDutch Disease), as the benefits of a highly valuable commodity do not spread\nto other members of society and violence\/conflict emerge as groups fight over the\nresource. While income may be very high, millions of workers continue to face\nhorrendous work conditions directly related to development efforts. In Qatar, for\nexample, thousands of workers have died during the massive construction of new\nstadiums and other infrastructure required to host the World Cup in 2022. Other\nexamples of Dutch Disease can be found in Nigeria (oil), South Africa (diamonds),\nand the Democratic Republic of Congo (coltan).\nPage | 168 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nFigure 9.7a | Burj Khalifa, Dubai, Figure 9.7b | Artificial Island Construction, Dubai, United Arab\nUnited Arab Emirates Emirates\nAuthor | User \u201cDonaldytong\u201d Author | User \u201cLencer\u201d\nSource | Wikipedia Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0 License | CC BY SA 3.0\n9.3.2 How Does a Country Improve Its Wealth and Well-Being?\nThe International Trade Model\nThe characteristics of this model are quite simple on the surface. In this\nstrategy, a country embraces free trade (removing barriers to all imports and\nexports in a country) and willingly participates in all facets of the global economy.\nThe basic benefits of the strategy are as follows:\n1. Potential High ROI (Return on Investment)\n2. Increased specialization leading to technological advantages\n3. Simplified development strategy\n4. Less government involvement\nLibraries of books have been written about the transformative power\nof capitalism and other libraries of books have criticized the system. The\ninternational trade model asserts that trade between nations is the best way to\nbring about mutual prosperity for all. As a country removes barriers to trade,\nthere will invariably be winners and losers, but classical macroeconomic (the\nPage | 169 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nbranch of economics that focuses on entire systems rather than individuals or\nfirms) theory posits that the overall benefit will be greater than the losses. The\nU.S. has championed the strategy since the end of WWII (1945) as it encouraged\nallies, neighbors, and adversaries to open borders, allow imports, and reduce\ncontrols on the free exchange of goods and services between countries. The\nEuropean Union has done the same as it moved towards a common currency\nand a free flow of goods and services throughout Europe. The Asian Tigers and\nBRICS also embrace the global trade system to various degrees, having gained\nenormous growth in wealth following a recipe that calls for an intensive export-\noriented economy.\nCountries following the strategy remove domestic producer subsidies and\nallow global competition to decide the \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019. As such, countries\nmust find specific services and industries in which to gain specialization.\nSouth Korea, for example, elected to focus on low-end electronics initially before\nmoving into other sectors such as ship-building and automobiles. Initially, the\nproducts were inferior to those produced elsewhere, but with each generation\nit improved its workforce, technical knowledge, and facilities until it gained a\ncomparative advantage (ability to produce particular items\/services more\nefficiently than competitors given all the alternatives) in those industries.\nSpecialization requires a lot of practice with an intensity of focus, investment,\nand time to gain price and quality competitiveness on the global market, but if\ndone correctly the rate of return on investment can be very high. For example,\nin the post-Korean War era (circa 1953), South Korea transitioned away from\nan economy based mostly on farming to become the 7th leading exporter in the\nworld, specializing in cars, auto parts, ships, and integrated circuits. Moreover,\nthe technological knowledge can then be used to foster other industries. Under\nthis strategy, governments don\u2019t try to protect certain companies over others,\nand since tariffs are removed, it simplifies the development strategy.\nAs countries gain comparative advantages in certain areas, they also tend\nto relinquish efforts in other areas. For example, as Japan focused developing\nits industrial sector after WWII, it focused less on agriculture, depending\nincreasingly upon imports from other countries. Such a trade-off is termed\nopportunity cost in that choosing to do one thing prohibits you from doing\nsomething else. During the 1980\u2019s era, the United States aggressively pursued\nan international trade model that allowed for more manufactured goods to be\nimported into the country. People working in areas like steel production, and\ncoal mining began to see their job opportunities diminish as more foreign goods\nentered the U.S. economy. Proponents of the system argue that such workers\nneed to adapt and become re-trained in other high paying professions in order\nto escape the pain that comes with economic transformation. Can you think of\nother industries or jobs that suffer as a result of a country\u2019s choice to follow the\ninternational trade model?\nPage | 170 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nA few other negative aspects to the strategy are:\n\u2022 Susceptibility to unpredictable global markets\n\u2022 Loss of local control\n\u2022 Uneven benefits to the population.\nTake a look at Figure 9.8. The dramatic price shift (first upward and then\ndownward) represents the dramatic risk associated with global trade. For a\nfarmer that has shifted away from food production and into palm oil (as did\nmillions of farmers in Indonesia and Malaysia in the 2000\u2019s), this price drop is\nmore than just economic theory. It can be the difference between living and dying.\nFocusing on a few key industries or products within a country comes with serious\nrisks. What if prices drop unexpectedly or global preferences for certain products\nchange without warning? Somebody gets left holding the bag and such shifts are\nvery common in many commodity chains, with those at the bottom suffering the\nmost serious consequences.\nFigure 9.8 | Palm Oil Prices, 2000-2009\nAuthor | Todd Lindley\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nThe second risk, loss of local control, occurs when countries have entered into\nfree-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nbetween Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. As U.S. corporations increasingly began to\nre-locate production to Mexico, American workers\u2019 calls for politicians to intervene\nPage | 171 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nwent unanswered because the agreement prevented state or local governments\nfrom taking intentional actions to protect jobs or to keep companies from moving.\nFinally, international trade has generated significant growth in production and\nwealth, but it also brings new competition that disrupts local economies. While\ncustomers usually benefit from lower prices of imported products, many local\nproducers lose their livelihoods entirely. As the U.S. lost manufacturing jobs to\nMexico, more than 2 million small-scale Mexican farmers also lost their jobs, as\nMexican corn could not possibly compete with the low-cost, mass produced crops\nfrom the U.S. and Canada. Corn exports to Mexico in 2016 were 5 times higher\nthan in the year before NAFTA. It is not an accident that rates of immigration from\nMexico to the U.S. increased dramatically during the same period. As farmers lost\ntheir jobs, the moved in search of new ones.\nThe Protectionist Model\nAs you probably have guessed from its name, the protectionist model (also\nknown as import substitution) requires that countries sustain themselves without\nsignificant trade with other countries. Protectionist policies are applied to\nsafeguard domestic companies from foreign ones. The theory behind this strategy\nis grounded in the idea that over-reliance on foreign labor, products, and\/or\nservices can be detrimental to national sovereignty and\/or security. As such, the\nstrategy became very popular among countries that gained independence after\nmany years of imperialism and colonization. India, Jamaica, the Philippines, the\nformer Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, and most countries in the Caribbean\nand in Africa embarked up this strategy from the 1950\u2019s-1980\u2019s. Yugoslavia, for\nexample, produced its own car, called a Yugo, and India did the same. These\nautomobiles were designed to be affordable for domestic consumers, but in\nboth cases the strategy failed to produce a reliable, affordable product and left\nconsumers without access to better alternatives imported from Germany, Japan,\nor the U.S. Protectionism is closely tied to nationalism in many cases as politicians\nand\/or consumers ask the basic question, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take care of ourselves, by\nourselves, rather than depending on workers and producers from other parts of\nthe world?\u201d How does this question relate to your own opinions about whatever\ncountry you live in or were born in? Does the argument make sense to you?\nBy the 21st century, the vast majority of countries in the world turned away from\nprotectionism as a strategy in favor or adopting an international trade oriented\neconomy. Nonetheless, protectionism does offer certain advantages worthy of\nconsideration such as:\n1. More controlled decision-making\n2. Benefits spread to more members of society\n3. More government involvement\n4. Food security\nPage | 172 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nDecision-making by governments can be more controlled and policy decisions\ncan be easier to make and policies can be designed to benefit and spread to more\nmembers of society under protectionism. Until 1993, for example, corn farmers in\nMexico were protected from cheap corn produced in the U.S. and Canada, because\nof restrictions on imports. Most of the millions of small-scale corn farmers in Mexico\ncould grow enough corn for their own families and produce a small surplus to be sold\nlocally, providing a small but meaningful wage for millions of families. Protecting\nfarmers from outside competition offered a measure of predictability, political\nstability, and food security from one year to the next. Mexico is also blessed with\ngenerous reserves of oil and traditionally the government has controlled domestic oil\nand gas prices, which again can bring a certain level of predictability to consumers as\nopposed to the wild shifts in prices that can often accompany imported oil.\nDisadvantages to this isolationist strategy are probably apparent to you as you\nread and think about this topic. A few of them are listed here:\n\u2022 Susceptibility to corruption, inefficiency, and slow response to market\nconditions\n\u2022 Lacking in creativity and innovation\n\u2022 Absence of natural resources in some places necessitate trade to meet\ndemand\nWhen a government protects a company from outside competition, there is a\ntendency for that company to become susceptible to corruption. Since 1938 a single oil\ncompany called Pemex had exclusive rights to drill, process, and sell oil within Mexico,\nwhich provided a huge source of revenue, protected jobs, and helped build national\npride. In recent decades, however, the company increasingly found itself entangled\nin one scandal after another involving\nbribes, kickbacks, and various schemes\nthat have kept gasoline prices at the pump\nartificially high. In 2013, however,\nMexico began reforms known as market\nliberalization (a process of removing\nbarriers to foreign-owned companies\nfrom operating and competing with\ndomestic ones), allowing BP, Shell, and\nother companies to import petroleum\nand open gas stations in certain parts of\nMexico. Such a shift is having a serious Figure 9.9 | Nationally Owned\/Operated\nimpact upon the national landscape both Gas Stations in Mexico\nAuthor | User \u201cDiaper\u201d\nsymbolically and materially as residents\nSource | Flickr\nhave a choice between competitors for License | CC BY 2.0\nthe first time in 80 years!\nPage | 173 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nAside from corruption, another drawback to isolationism is the lack of creativity\nand innovation that otherwise comes from fierce competition. Venezuela, a\ncountry that has resisted international trade in favor of protectionism, currently\nis suffering from massive shortages in food and other necessary consumer items\nas domestic producers have failed to innovate and respond to consumer demand.\nMeanwhile, global supply chains of rice, beans, corn, tomatoes, mangoes, coffee,\nsriracha sauce, and fidget spinners have constantly evolved, innovated, and\nchanged to efficiently provide for the demands of consumers internationally\nwhether they happen to be in Sydney, Seoul, Santo Domingo, or Sao Paulo! It\nis very difficult for governments to plan for and anticipate the needs of an entire\nsociety for any length of time. Protectionism requires a government that can\nmatch consumers and producers efficiently, a task often handled much better by\nfree-market forces than by public officials.\nThe final element that makes protectionism so problematic rests in simple\ngeography. All countries have different conditions related to site, situation, climate,\nor natural resources, so trade isn\u2019t just advantageous but rather it is essential to\nsurvival. An extreme case can be found in North Korea, a country with notoriously\ntightly controlled borders. Without trade the country routinely fails to produce\nenough rice, leaving millions desperate and undernourished. Likewise, China\nfaced similar droughts, food shortages, and periods of starvation when it favored\nprotectionism for most of the 20th century, but it began to reverse its strategy as it\ncautiously opened its economy to the rest of the world in the early 1980\u2019s.\nThe 2 Models in Global Context\nAfter reading the brief summaries of the 2 models above, you might ask\nyourself why any country would choose a protectionist model, given the obvious\nadvantages and drawbacks of each. Most economists say the same thing. We need\nto exercise caution with overly simplistic conclusions, however. Here is where\ngeography and history are worth careful consideration. Let\u2019s begin with Caribbean\nislands (most of them anyway). The majority of Caribbean countries were colonies\nuntil just very recently (1960\u2019s onward). During the colonial period, European\npowers established a monoculture (agricultural system heavily focused on a single\nitem) plantation economic system in which particular islands or territories focused\nexclusively on one item such as sugar, bananas, or pineapple. Upon independence,\nmany of these former colonies found that they had very little diversity in their\nown domestic economy, meaning that even after earning their freedom they were\nstill almost entirely dependent upon the former colonizer economically because\nthe plantation economy created a relationship of dependency. The concept of\ndependency theory explains the economic problems experienced by former\ncolonies as a function of the disadvantageous terms and patterns of trade\nestablished over hundreds of years. Look at it this way. If all of the grocery stores\naround you closed permanently, would you be able to head into the wilderness\ntomorrow to find your own food? Would you know which berries are safe and which\nPage | 174 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nare poisonous? Probably not. This was the situation in which many former colonies\nfound themselves, so it made sense for them to attempt to protect themselves\nfrom outside competition while domestic companies could emerge and develop.\nMoreover, world systems theory suggests that the global system of trade only\nworks as long as there are a persistent set of winners (more developed countries),\nwho mostly benefit from low-cost production in poor countries, and losers (less\ndeveloped countries) that provide a readily available supply of laborers willing to\nwork long hours for low wages.\nWhile many countries have clearly benefitted from the international trade\nmodel, others have actually been damaged by their participation in global\ncompetition. Ethiopia\u2019s largest export, for example, is coffee and although retail\nprices for a cup of coffee have increased dramatically, incomes of coffee farmers\nin that country have not reaped any of those benefits. Instead, prices paid for\ncoffee beans have routinely been set by foreign commodities markets that tend to\nundervalue the product and harm small producers, leaving only large producers\nwith a meaningful profit. Although just 3 cents more per kilo could bring these\nfarmers out of poverty, global markets don\u2019t account for such disparities. One\nremedy for such a complicate problem is fair trade, a system that guarantees a\nbasic living wage for those at the very bottom of the global production cycle.\nAnother meaningful problem with global trade is that it can be very disruptive\nand unpredictable. Following years of state controlled markets, Russia began\nto open itself to foreign competition and free-market reforms after 1989. While\nWestern countries applauded the decision, many people in Russia suffered as they\nexperienced a lower quality of life, loss of jobs, and massive economic and political\ninstability. Social problems, most notably high unemployment and alcohol abuse,\nbegan to dominate society as life expectancy actually dropped significantly for\nRussian men, many of whom could not adapt to the new demands of a fully market-\nbased economy.\nIn summary, the decisions made by any country about the best path to increase\ndevelopment are not so clear. Leaders and policy-makers face very difficult, often\ncontradictory decisions that vary from place to place, about how to make things\nbetter for citizens and residents. Moreover, what might be good in the short-\nterm, can be problematic in the long-term. For example, Jamaica\u2019s decision to\nprotect its farmers from outside competition benefitted local farmers in the short-\nterm, but the island government\u2019s subsidies to farmers proved too costly for the\ngovernment in the long term. When the money ran out, the country found itself in\ncrisis. Collectivist societies are particularly threatened by international trade\nmodels in that many traditional forms of society do not encourage competition,\nbut rather they value cooperation for the good of the group over the desires of\nany individual. Finally, any development strategy that values short-term benefits\nover long-term costs are clearly problematic. As India and China have embraced\ninternational trade, for example, unprecedented levels of air and water pollution\nhave become the norm in Shanghai, Bombay, Delhi, and Beijing (among others).\nPage | 175 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nSustainable Development is a strategy that balances both current and future\nbenefits and costs and attempts to balance them with any possible environmental\ndamage (e.g. oil spills, loss of habitat, erosion, increased pollution, dangerous\nwaste) that might occur.\n9.4 ROSTOW\u2019S STAGES OF GROWTH AND\nPOLITICAL POLICY\nDo all countries follow a similar pattern of development over time? This is a\nsimple question that does not have a simple answer. Just as different people each\nfollow different career paths, depending upon their own unique talents, strengths,\nand weaknesses, the same is true of countries. While the Asian Tigers have\nsuccessfully demonstrated the power of embracing an export-oriented economy,\ncountries like Brazil, Jamaica, and South Africa have also embraced global\ntrade but failed to achieve similar results in spite of grand efforts and reforms.\nNonetheless, the dominant and consistent advice from Western countries (in the\nGlobal North) is for poorer countries to reject protectionism in favor of trade and\nglobalization. Much of the debate is informed by economic theory that argues that\nthe more we trade with one another, the more stuff there is for all of us \u2013 and who\ndoesn\u2019t want more stuff, right? A leading proponent of trade was an American\ngovernment official named Walter Rostow, who developed a model known as\nRostow\u2019s Stages of Growth in 1960. He argued that countries historically follow a\nsimilar and predictable pathway to wealth and stability and that each country is\nin one of the 5 stages of growth described below:\n1. Traditional Society: characterized by subsistence agriculture with\nintensive labor and low levels of trade in which most live on small\nfarms, are mostly focused on local concerns, and remain largely\ndisconnected from the rest of the world.\n2. Preconditions for Take-off: initial manufacturing stage, beginning\nof trade, new ideas, emergence of banks, but society still dominated by\ntradition.\n3. Take-off: a short period of massive disruptive societal change, in\nwhich industrialization accelerates, high profits are reinvested in new\ntechnologies, often brought on from external forces.\n4. Drive to Maturity: takes place over a long period of time, as\nstandards of living rise, economic growth outpaces population growth,\nuse of technology and education increases, and the national economy\ngrows and diversifies.\n5. Age of High Mass Consumption: final stage, in which most enjoy\nthe luxury of consuming far more than they need. Advanced economies\nhave a surplus that can be used do increase social welfare and reduce\nPage | 176 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nrisks to society. (Rostow believed the U.S. had reached this stage in the\n1920\u2019s, Western Europe and Japan in the 1950\u2019s and the Soviet Union\ncould potentially reach it if it changed its political system).\nRostow\u2019s ideas represent the concept of modernization theory, which is the\nwidely held belief that, with the proper intervention each country will pass through\na similar pathway of development. Modernization geography recognizes the large\ndisparities that exist from one place to another across the globe and represents an\nattempt to bring prosperity to places that have been left out or left behind. The goal\nto address such differences worldwide represents a shift in scale from one in which\neach country looks after itself to a new paradigm in which wealthy countries felt a\nkeen responsibility to \u2018bring\u2019 development to those across the world, in what\u2019s been\ndubbed the \u2018development project\u2019. The best evidence of this global effort can be\nseen in the Millennium Development Goals, which were a series of 8 measurable\noutcomes decided upon by 189 world leaders in 2000 that were to be achieved\nby 2015. Although not all of the goals were achieved, significant progress was\ndemonstrated across most of the 8 goals. Much of the progress, however, has been\nfound in Asia \u2013 most notably in China, where nearly 200 million people have left\nfarms and moved to cities to work in manufacturing jobs, which pay far more than\nwhat they could earn as farmers. Critics of Rostow\u2019s model point out that it doesn\u2019t\naccount for geographic differences, historical variations, or the long-standing effects\nof colonialism and they also argue that the model is more of a political document\n(critical of communism and triumphant of capitalism) than it is a serious economic\nblueprint for success. Nonetheless, efforts have been spearheaded by Europe and\nNorth America to jumpstart all economies of the world into action, so that all can\neventually reach the age of high mass consumption. Can you identify any problems\nwith this model? Is it possible for all countries of the world to live in a state of high\nconsumption? Why or why not?\nWhat do you think might be the biggest obstacle to development by poor\ncountries today? It\u2019s the same obstacle that keeps you from going out to dinner\nevery night \u2013 MONEY, of course! But the kind of money we\u2019re talking about in this\ncase is not available from a regular bank. For that reason, the World Bank was\nformed in 1944 to provide funds to countries for the purpose of large development\nprojects. For example, a World Bank loan financed the construction of the Tarbela\nDam (1977) \u2013 see Figure 9.10. One of the largest in the world, the structure\nfacilitates irrigation, helps to control flooding, and (most importantly) provides\nsignificant amounts of hydroelectricity to the region in Pakistan along the Indus\nRiver. Such projects are often controversial, however. During its construction,\nthe dam displaced 120 villages and many claimed to have never received the\ncompensation they were promised. Similar projects can be found all over the\nworld, and most of them are designed to improve people\u2019s daily lives while also\ngreasing the wheels of global commerce.\nPage | 177 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nFigure 9.10 | World Bank Financed Tarbela Dam in Pakistan\nAuthor | Paul Duncan, U.S. Marine Corps\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nAnother source of funding to governments comes in the form of emergency\nloans, usually from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF is\nfunded primarily from wealthy private sector banks and offers loans during times\nof financial crisis. The loans are smaller than those from the World Bank and\nare not designated for national infrastructure projects, rather they are intended\nto maintain stability when a country may otherwise be vulnerable to political\nrevolution, dictatorship, or collapse. Such loans, however, come with strings\nattached. The borrowing country must agree to a series of structural adjustment\nprograms. Namely, countries must:\n1. Privatize government-owned assets (such as oil companies, utilities\ncompanies, or diamond mines)\n2. Reduce spending on government programs (such as social services,\nfood programs, or military spending)\n3. Open themselves up to foreign investment and foreign competition\n(such as the case with Mexico and Pemex)\nThe end result of accepting an IMF loan, then, nudges that country away\nfrom the protectionist model of development and towards one that focuses on\ninternational trade. Most often, a country following the adjustments will experience\na devaluation of their own currency, making imports more expensive, but exports\nPage | 178 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nmore viable, which can be very beneficial to manufacturers searching for new,\nlower-cost manufacturing locations around the world. As with any major change\nto an economic system, there will always be big winners and big losers. The same\ncan be said for structural adjustment programs and the IMF.\n9.5 NEW MODELS OF DEVELOPMENT\n9.5.1 Is There More to Life Than Money?\nFigure 9.11 | Human Development Index (Based upon 2016 Human Development Report)\nAuthor | User \u201cHappenstance\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nThis may seem like more of a philosophical question than one you\u2019d find in a\ngeography textbook, but it\u2019s an important one to consider. In the previous section,\nwe learned that the end-point of development is to arrive to a state of high mass\nconsumption relying primarily on indicators of wealth, income, and production\nto evaluate one place compared to another. Do you think this a fair assessment or\nare there other ways to gauge development? Think about some of the things that\nmake you feel good or bad about any particular place. Does it have good parks,\nsafe roads, low levels of traffic, or lots of fun things to do? While some of those\nthings are connected to income and wealth, some markers of development do not\nnecessarily have to be connected to wealth.\nIndian economist and Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen argued that our\nunderstanding of development needed to be dramatically altered to include a\ncapabilities approach to measuring, encountering, and improving people\u2019s lives.\nIn his book \u2018Development as Freedom\u2019, Sen argues that abject poverty comes from\na lack of rights and the absence of freedom that are very different from simplistic\nnotions wealth and poverty. For example, a country that produces a lot of oil like\nPage | 179 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nSaudi Arabia may demonstrate high GDP growth, but if it doesn\u2019t positively affect\nthe lives of most people in the country, then the GDP is not improving people\u2019s\nlives in a meaningful way. As obvious as it may sound today, this transformative\nthinking drove the United Nations to redefine thinking on development as the\norganization unveiled its first annual Human Development Report (http:\/\/\nwww.hdr.undp.org) in 1990, which incorporated a brand new index, called the\nHuman Development Index (HDI) (Figure 9.9). Instead of relying solely\non income, the index is derived from indicators of 1) life expectancy, 2) adult\nliteracy, 3) school enrollment, and 4) income to provide a meaningful comparison\nfor almost all countries (a few countries like North Korea choose not to participate).\nThe index provides reason for optimism in that 105 countries are now categorized\nas \u2018very high\u2019 (51 countries) or \u2018high\u2019 (54) human development with an HDI of .70\nor higher.\nYou can view the entire list of countries here: http:\/\/hdr.undp.org\/en\/\ncomposite\/trends, and the regional trends over time are included in Figure\n9.10, which shows that the areas with the greatest improvement since 1990 have\nbeen East Asia and South Asia. Most notably, China moved from low human\ndevelopment to high and India moved from low to medium during the short period\nfrom 1990-2015. Sub-Saharan Africa contains the majority of those with the lowest\nlevels of human development, but nearly every country experienced persistent\nimprovement since 1990. Moreover, developing countries everywhere have seen\nimprovements in educational access and life expectancy during the past 50 years.\nHDI helps us to quantify those improvements over time. One final point about this\nindex is that some countries do a very good job of providing human development,\nin spite of low income. Find Mexico and Cuba on the map, for example. In both\ncountries, incomes are low, but life expectancy is high. In the case of Cuba, life\nexpectancy is higher than it is in the U.S. Cuba has followed a protectionist strategy\nfor several years, which has limited financial growth, but its provision of healthcare\nand education gives it a higher HDI than would otherwise be predicted. Meanwhile,\ncountries like Kuwait and others in the Middle East enjoy high incomes but lower\nlevels of development when measured by the index. HDI also has its limitations\nsince it uses only 4 indicators. Can you think of some other measure that might be\nmeaningful? Some examples might be gender empowerment, levels of inequality,\nor simply quality of life. Other indexes measure such things, and access to the\nInternet or to modern sanitation systems. Among those living in rural areas of\nIndia, for example, only one quarter of the population has access to a working\ntoilet. The Population Reference Bureau (http:\/\/www.prb.org\/DataFinder)\ncollects data on these and other indicators by country that are readily accessible.\nYou are encouraged to check out the website to find out more of these!\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that differences within countries can be very\nstark. People living in Shanghai, China, for example enjoy a standard of living very\nsimilar to the average Italian. Meanwhile, rural dwellers in that country are not\nmuch better off than an average person from Sub-Saharan Africa. Just as many rural\nPage | 180 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nresidents in Tennessee, Mississippi, and West Virginia struggle with access to basic\nhealth care and have unemployment rates much higher than in other parts of the\nU.S. The small country of Bhutan has taken a novel approach to measuring its own\ndevelopment by considering one factor above all others \u2013 happiness. Rather than\nmeasuring GDP, it closely monitors gross national happiness as a barometer of\nthe spiritual, physical, social and environmental health of its citizens and natural\nenvironment. As stated by the Minister of Education, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to mine the land and\nfish the seas and get rich. Yet we believe you cannot have a prosperous nation in the\nlong run that does not conserve its natural environment or take care of the wellbeing\nof its people.\u201d As you may have noticed, none of the indicators of development\npresented in this chapter take into account the well-being of the environment or the\nlong-term cost of development. As people become wealthier, they consume more of\nthe earth\u2019s resources. The Bhutan model might seem a little strange to the average\nAmerican student, but it is one of the few models that takes seriously the notion of\nenvironmental sustainability as a component of development.\n9.5.2 What Is Microfinance?\nInherent in all forms of development strategies is the importance of money.\nPrevious sections described how the World Bank and the IMF offer development\nassistance to developing countries. Both of those entities are limited to relatively\nlarge-scale projects, however. In recent decades a new form of development\nassistance has emerged that has proven much more impactful at the local level. The\nterm micro-finance refers to all of financial services normally available through a\nbank to the wealthy around the world. These include credit cards, short-term loans,\ninterest bearing accounts, and financial insurance. Something as simple as a credit\ncard that allows for a college student to buy books (not this book, however!) can\nbe the difference between staying and leaving college. Small-scale farmers in less\ndeveloped countries are at constant risk when they do not have access to such credit.\nWith even a very small loan, or micro-loan (e.g. $500), hundreds of millions of\nfarmers can increase their income significantly. If you sell milk, but you only own 3\ncows, imagine what you could do with 6 cows! Large-scale development programs\ndon\u2019t offer such things to individual farmers, but new programs and websites are\ndoing exactly that. Perhaps most well-known among these is Kiva.org (http:\/\/kiva.\norg). What started as a small endeavor to match lenders and borrowers by 2 people\nhas morphed into a major provider of loans to more than 100,000 people in 2016,\nwhile raising nearly $150 million. Most incredibly, the repayment rate of loans\ngiven to the poorest of the poor stands at 97%, an astounding accomplishment.\n9.5.3 What Does the Future Hold For Development Around\nThe World?\nPredicting the future is always risky. Climate change, emergent untreatable\ndiseases, and massive political upheavals have historically altered the course of\nPage | 181 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nhistory beyond anyone\u2019s imagination. Those caveats aside, the immediate future is\nexpected to be a good one when measured by human development index. As total\nfertility rates decline across all of the developing world, women\u2019s empowerment\nwill also increase. As more women enter the workforce globally, family incomes\nare expected to continue to rise. The overarching story of the 20th century was that\nlife expectancies skyrocketed, infant mortality rates declined, and the spread\nof many communicable diseases was curtailed. Economists argue that, as more\ncountries increase their connectivity to the global system via trade, that the wealth\nof everyone increases. As hundreds of millions of farmers left the countryside\nin China and India to seek manufacturing jobs, levels of development increased\ndramatically. Many predict that the same spatial pattern will occur in African and in\nother parts of the world in the coming decades as manufacturers seek new markets\nand new, lower cost labor deep into the 21st century. Many of the improvements\nworldwide are directly connected to technological improvements. Anyone with\nan Internet connection in 2018 has access to more information, imagery, and\nknowledge than average people had throughout their entire lifetime even just one\ngeneration ago. As globalization allows for the free flow of information, commerce,\ncurrency, and ideas, there is also an increased risk that dangerous things travel\nalong those same routes. The dark web makes for easy illicit exchanges of drugs,\nweapons, stolen credit cards, human trafficking victims, and all sorts of other\nhorrible things. The challenge for development in the future clearly lies in balancing\nthe risks and benefits of a world that has experienced such a massive time-space\ncompression in such a short period of time.\nFigure 9.12 | Human Development Index by Region and Time Period\nAuthor | United Nations Development Programme\nSource | United Nations Development Programme\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\n9.6 CONCLUSION\nIn some ways, trying to describe and understand all facets of development\naround the world is a ridiculous task. The previous sections of this chapter barely\nscratch the surface, and yet the major questions pertaining to development are\nPage | 182 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nactually quite simple. Is it better for a country to be intricately connected to the\nglobal economy and to willingly import and export lots of things? Or is it better\nto close oneself off, protecting your own from the potential dangers of the outside\nworld? History seems to be on the side of openness, but that also carries serious\nrisk. Governments can spend huge amounts of money trying to make people\u2019s\nlives better only to find themselves in massive debt, followed by massive political\nupheaval (as recently happened in Brazil). There is no single magical formula,\nyet the general principles laid out in this chapter do offer some valuable insight\nfrom what has occurred in the past 70 years. On average, human beings in the 21st\ncentury are healthier, living longer, earning more money, having fewer children,\nconsuming more, and knowing more about their world than at any other time in the\nhistory of our species. Given these realities, there is reason for cautious optimism\nas we look forward to the next hundred years. In spite of all of that, it\u2019s imperative\nthat we realize the fragility of our planet and the environmental cost that comes\nwith the overconsumption of resources. As large countries like China become\nwealthier, hundreds of millions of new consumers create more plastic waste, more\ntoxic runoff, more carbon emissions, more copper mines, and more demand for\nenergy than ever before. The rush to development has often hastened ecological\ncatastrophe, making it essential that future development efforts consider long-term\nsustainability as an anchor for decision-making in the 21st century and beyond.\n9.7 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAbsolute Advantage \u2013 In economic terms, a country that is blessed with abundant\nnatural resources or geographic advantages that are rare or in short supply and in\nhigh demand elsewhere.\nAdult Literacy Rate \u2013 The proportion of the adult population aged 15 years and over\nthat is literate. This indicator provides a measure of the stock of literate persons\nwithin the adult population who are capable of using written words in daily life and\nto continue to learn.\nAsian Dragons (Asian Tigers) \u2013 The high-growth economies of Hong Kong, Singapore,\nSouth Korea and Taiwan: all of which focus on exports, an educated populace and\nhigh savings rates as pathways to development.\nBRICS Countries \u2013 The countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2013\ncountries that collectively account for 40% of the world\u2019s population and 25% of\nthe world\u2019s land. From 1990-2014 these countries share of the global economy rose\nfrom 11% to almost 30%. In recent years, economic growth in the BRICS has been\nslowed by corruption, crisis, and dropping commodity prices.\nCapitalism \u2013 The historically contingent economic system of trade in which parties are\ncategorized into laborers and capitalists, both of whom seek to maximize their\nprofit\/wages. Within capitalism prices, production, and wages are determined by\nmarket conditions including, but not limited to supply and demand. Contemporary\ncapitalism is intimately tied to the industrial revolution and ensuing societal\nPage | 183 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\ntransformations in England that diffused across Europe initially and then to many\nother parts of the world. Capitalism assumes that rational consumers seek to\nmaximize their own utility.\nCollectivism (Collective Societies) \u2013 A socio-political-economic system that prioritizes\nthe well-being of the group over the individual. Collectivist modes of development,\nfor example tend to include progressive tax regimes, affordable access to healthcare\nand higher education for all, and protections for marginalized groups. In LDC\u2019s\nthis may also include communal ownership of land or other assets.\nComparative Advantage \u2013 The principle whereby individuals (or territories) produce\nthose goods or services for which they have the greatest cost or efficiency\nadvantage over others and the lowest opportunity cost. The outcome tends to be\nspecialization across places.\nDependency Theory \u2013 A theory of development positing that the global economic\nsystem disadvantages certain regions and countries. It is argued that prior colonial\nrelationships created systems of trade that benefitted the colonizer much more\nthan the colonized. Countries that were made producers of pineapple, sugar,\nrubber, and other products during colonial times continue to be dependent upon\nthe production of very low-profit items, limiting opportunities to produce other\nmore valuable products and services long after independence, because the trade\nsystems remains the same.\nDeveloping Country \u2013 A term that includes all countries, other than those in the\nwealthiest category, that continue to improve their levels of development in the\nlate 20th and early 21st centuries. The label has come to replace the less preferred\nterm, LDC, to account for the fact that LDC is a static identifies while \u2018Developing\u2019\nis a dynamic one.\nDevelopment \u2013 Processes related to improving people\u2019s lives through improved access to\nresources, technology, education, wealth, opportunity, and choice. Governments,\nindividuals, non-profit organizations, and inter-government agencies all work\ntowards similar goals with a variety of different approaches.\nDomestic subsidy \u2013 A government-sponsored financial incentive that provides a\nproduction advantage to a company or entity. This may take a variety of forms.\nExamples include no-interest loans or cash payouts to farmers that meet certain\ncriteria. Such programs are designed to lower risks and increase productivity of\nparticular industries, services, or products and to protect them from competition\nthat comes from outside of that country.\nFair Trade \u2013 One of a variety of different global trading systems that seek to guarantee\nfair (higher) payment for producers; often with other social and environmental\nconsiderations.\nFree Trade \u2013 A system of trade that removes (or attempts to remove) all \u2018artificial\u2019 barriers\nthat otherwise limit exports and exports between countries. A major component of\nfree trade is the elimination of tariffs, duties, domestic subsidies, or laws that favor\none country or company over another.\nPage | 184 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nGig Economy \u2013 A labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts\nor freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) \u2013 All of the goods and services produced within a\ncountry within a given year. The formula for GDP is Consumption + Investment +\nGovernment Spending + Net Exports. Global GDP was approximately $76 trillion\nin 2016.\nGross National Happiness \u2013 a holistic and sustainable approach to development, which\nbalances material and non-material values with the conviction that humans want\nto search for happiness. The objective of GNH is to achieve a balanced development\nin all the facets of life that are essential for collective and individual happiness. The\n4 pillars of happiness are: 1) sustainable & equitable socio-economic development;\n2) environmental conservation; 3) preservation & promotion of culture; 4) good\ngovernance.\nGross National Income \u2013 All of the goods and services produced within a country in\naddition to all of the net income its companies and citizens receives from overseas.\nGDP per capita \u2013 GDP divided by total population.\nGlobal North \u2013 Those countries generally considered to be \u2018more developed\u2019, which also\nfall primarily north of the Brandt line as drawn in 1980. See Figure 9.1.\nGlobal South \u2013 Those countries generally considered to be \u2018less developed\u2019, which also\nfall primarily south of the Brandt line as drawn in 1980. See Figure 9.1.\nHuman Agency \u2013 The concept that human beings take an active role in their own\nsituation to invoke change. The concept is of critical importance in understanding\nhow and why models and theories of development are so complex.\nHuman Development Index (HDI) \u2013 A measure developed by the United Nations in\n1990 to consider and compare levels of development by all countries of the world\nusing life expectancy, literacy, school enrollment, and income as the indicators.\nThis provides a more meaningful way to compare countries than looking only at\nincome\/GDP. Those with the highest HDI tend to be in Australia and Northern\nEurope. Those with the lowest tend to be in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nHuman Development Report \u2013 An annual comprehensive analysis, assessment, and\nranking of every country in the world based upon the Human Development Index.\nThe report has been compiled and released every year since 1990.\nInfant Mortality Rate \u2013 A measure of how many children die in any given year compared\nto 1,000 live births. Countries with low levels of development tend to have high\ninfant mortality.\nInformal Economy \u2013 Those activities within any economic system that are unregulated,\nuntaxed, and\/or unquantified. Includes, but not limited to: selling anything\nillegally, unreported paid work, consuming unlicensed\/artificial products (movies,\nmusic, watches, etc.). Women, children, and the poor are those most likely engaged\nin the informal economy, but globalization and technology also plays an important\nin driving new forms of informalization. This sector of the economy is also related\nPage | 185 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEVELOPMENT AND WEALTH\nto the rise of the gig economy, in which workers increasingly are contractors\nrather than employees \u2013 an important distinction.\nInternational Trade Model of Development \u2013 A strategy of development in which\na country embraces free trade and elects seek specialization of certain products\nand services that are valuable as exports in the global marketplace.

Having to\ntravel in small groups to obtain food, people led a\nnomadic existence. This remained the only mode of\nsubsistence until the end of the Mesolithic period,\nsome 12,000-10,000 years ago. Then, agriculture\ngradually replaced the hunting and gathering\nsystem, constituting the spread of the Neolithic\nrevolution. Even today, some isolated groups\nsurvive as they did before agriculture developed.\nThey can be found in some remote areas such as in\nAmazonia, Congo, Namibia, Botswana, Tanzania,\nNew Guinea, and the Arctic latitude, where hunting\ndominates life (Figures 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3).\nThe term agriculture refers to the cultivation Figure 10.1 | Hadza Hunters\nAuthor | User \u201cIdobi\u201d\nof crops and the raising of livestock for both\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nsustenance and economic gain. The origin of License | CC BY SA 3.0\nagriculture goes back to prehistoric time, starting\nwhen humans domesticated plants and animals. The domestication of plants and\nanimals as the origin of agriculture was a pivotal transition in human history,\nwhich occurred several times independently. Agriculture originated and spread\nin different regions (hearths) of the world, including the Middle East, Southwest\nAsia, Mesoamerica and the Andes, Northeastern India, North China, and East\nAfrica, beginning as early as 12,000 \u2013 10,000 years ago. People became sedentary,\nliving in their villages, where new types of social, cultural, political, and economic\nrelationships were created. This period of momentous innovations is known as the\nFirst Agricultural Revolution.\nFigure 10.2 | Pum\u00e9 Hunter and Gatherers Figure 10.3 | Inuit Hunters\nAuthor | User \u201cAjimai\u201d Author | User \u201cWiki-profile\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0 License | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 191 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\n10.2 AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES\nAgriculture is a science, a business, and an art (Figures 10.4 and 10.5).\nSpatially, agriculture is the world\u2019s most widely distributed industry. It occupies\nmore area than all other industries combined, changing the surface of the Earth\nmore than any other. Farming, with its multiple methods, has significantly\ntransformed the landscape (small or large fields, terraces, polders, livestock\ngrazing), being an important reflection of the two-way relationship between people\nand their environments. The world\u2019s agricultural societies today are very diverse\nand complex, with agricultural practices ranging from the most rudimentary, such\nas using the ox-pulled plow, to the most complex, such as using machines, tractors,\nsatellite navigation, and genetic engineering methods. Customarily, scholars\ndivide agricultural societies into categories such as subsistence, intermediate,\nand developed, words that express the same ideas as primitive, traditional,\nand modern, respectively. For the purpose of simplification, farming practices\ndescribed in this chapter are classified into two categories, subsistence and\ncommercial, with fundamental differences between their practice in developed\nand developing countries.\nFigure 10.4 | Trading Floor at the Chicago Figure 10.5 | Tulip Fields in The Netherlands\nBoard of Trade Author | Alf van Beem\nAuthor | Jeremy Kemp Source | Wikimedia Commons\nSource | Wikimedia Commons License | CC 0\nLicense | Public Domain\n10.2.1 Subsistence Agriculture\nSubsistence agriculture replaced hunting and gathering in many parts of the\nglobe. The term subsistence, when it relates to farming, refers to growing food\nonly to sustain the farmers themselves and their families, consuming most of what\nthey produce, without entering into the cash economy of the country. The farm size\nis small, 2-5 acres (1-2 hectares), but the agriculture is less mechanized; therefore,\nthe percentage of workers engaged directly in farming is very high, reaching 50\npercent or more in some developing countries (Figure 10.6). Climate regions play\nan important role in determining agricultural regions. Farming activities range\nPage | 192 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nfrom shifting cultivation to pastoralism, both extensive forms that still prevail\nover large regions, to intensive subsistence.\nFigure 10.6 | Employment in Agriculture, 2014\nAuthor | Actualitix\nSource | Actualitix.com\nLicense | CC BY NC SA 4.0\nShifting Cultivation\nShifting cultivation, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture, is a form\nof subsistence agriculture that involves a kind of natural rotation system. Shifting\ncultivation is a way of life for 150-200 million people, globally distributed in the\ntropical areas, especially in the rain forests\nof South America, Central and West\nAfrica, and Southeast Asia. The practices\ninvolve removing dense vegetation,\nburning the debris, clearing the area,\nknown as swidden, and preparing it\nfor cultivation (Figures 10.7). Shifting\ncultivation can successfully support\nonly low population densities and, as a\nresult of rapid depletion of soil fertility,\nthe fields are actively cultivated usually\nfor three years. As a result, the infertile Figure 10.7 | Slash-and-Burn Farming in\nland has to be abandoned and another Thailand\nAuthor | User \u201cmattmangum\u201d\nsite has to be identified, starting again\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nthe process of clearing and planting. The License | CC BY SA 2.0\nPage | 193 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nslash-and-burn technique thus requires extensive acreage for new lots, as well as a\ngreat deal of human labor, involving at the same time a frequent gender division of\nlabor. The kinds of crops grown can be different from region to region, dominated\nby tubers, sweet potatoes especially, and grains such as rice and corn. The practice\nof mixing different seeds in the same swidden in the warm and humid tropics is\nfavorable for harvesting two or even three times per year. Yet, the slash-and-burn\npractice has some negative impacts on the environment, being seen as ecologically\ndestructive especially for areas with vulnerable and endangered species.\nPastoralism\nInvolving the breeding and herding of animals, pastoralism is another\nextensive form of subsistence agriculture. It is adapted to cold and\/or dry climates\nof savannas (grasslands), deserts, steppes, high plateaus, and Arctic zones where\nplanting crops is impracticable. Specifically, the practice is characteristic in Africa\n[north, central (Sahel) and south], the Middle East, central and southwest Asia,\nthe Mediterranean basin, and Scandinavia. The species of animals vary with the\nregion of the world including especially sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer, and camels.\nPastoralism is a successful strategy to support a population on less productive\nland, and adapts well to the environment.\nThree categories of pastoralism can be individualized: sedentary, nomadic,\nand transhumance.\nSedentary pastoralism refers to those farmers who live in their villages and\ntheir herd animals in nearby pastures. A number of men usually are hired by the\nvillagers in order to take care of their animals. Equally important is the practice\nin which the hired men gather the animals (cattle especially) in the morning, feed\nthem during the day in the nearby pasture, and then return them to the village\nearly in the evening. This is the typical pattern for many traditional European\npastoralists.\nNomadic pastoralism is a traditional form of subsistence agriculture in\nwhich the pastoralists travel with their herds over long distances and with no fixed\npattern. This is a continuous movement of groups of herds and people such as the\nBedouins of Saudi Arabia, the Bakhtiaris of Iran, the Berbers of North Africa, the\nMaasai of East Africa, the Zulus of South Africa, the Mongols of Central Asia, and\nother groups. The settlement landscape of pastoral nomads reflects their need for\nmobility and flexibility. Usually, they live in a type of tent (known as yurt in Central\nAsia) and move their herds to any available pasture (Figure 10.8). Although there\nare approximately 10-15 million nomadic pastoralists in the world, they occupy\nabout 20 percent of Earth\u2019s land area. Today, their life is in decline, the victim\nof more constricting political borders, competing land uses, selective overgrazing,\nand government resettlement programs.\nTranshumance is a seasonal vertical movement by herding the livestock\n(cows, sheep, goats, and horses) to cooler, greener high-country pastures in the\nsummer and then returning them to lowland settings for fall and winter grazing.\nPage | 194 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nFigure 10.8 | Mongolian Nomads Moving to Figure 10.9 | Transhumance in the\nAutumn Encampment Pyrenees Mountains\nAuthor | User \u201cYaan\u201d Author | User \u201cClicgauche\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0 License | CC BY SA 1.0\nHerders have a permanent home, typically in the valleys. Generally, the herds travel\nwith a certain number of people necessary to tend them, while the main population\nstays at the base. This is a traditional practice in the Mediterranean and the Black\nSea basins such as southern European countries, the Carpathian Mountains, and\nthe Caucasus countries (Figures 10.9 and 10.10). In addition, near highland\nzones such as the Atlas Mountains (northwest Africa) and the Anatolian Plateau\n(Turkey), as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East countries, and Central\nAsia, the pastoralists have to practice another type of transhumance, such as the\nmovement of animals between wet-season and dry-season pasture.\nFigure 10.10 | Romanian\nand Vlachs Transhumance\nin Balkans\nAuthor | User \u201cJulieta39\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 195 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nIntensive Subsistence Agriculture\nIntensive subsistence agriculture, characteristic of densely populated\nregions especially in southern, southeastern, and eastern Asia, involves the effective\nand efficient use of small parcels of land in order to maximize crop yield per acre.\nThe practice requires intensive human labor, with most of the work being done\nby hand and\/or with animals. The landscape of intensive subsistence agriculture\nis significantly transformed, including hillside terraces and raised fields, adding\nthe irrigation systems and fertilizers (Figures 10.11 and 10.12). As a result,\nintensive subsistence agriculture is able to support large rural populations. Rice is\nthe dominant crop in the humid areas of southern, southeastern, and eastern Asia.\nIn the drier areas, other crops are cultivated such as grains (wheat, corn, barley,\nmillet, sorghum, and oats), as well as peanuts, soybeans, tubers, and vegetables. In\nboth situations, the land is intensively used, and the milder climate of those regions\nallows double cropping (the fields are planted and harvested two times per year).\nFigure 10.11 | Rice Terraces, the Philippines Figure 10.12 | Raised fields, Vietnam\nAuthor | Susan McCouch Author | Dennis Jarvis\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY 2.5 License | CC BY SA 2.0\nIn recent decades, as the result of the introduction of higher-yielding grain\nvarieties such as wheat, corn, and rice, known as Green Revolution, tens of\nmillions of subsistence farmers have been lifted above the survival level. The spread\nof these new varieties throughout the farmlands of South, Southeast, and East Asia,\nand Mexico greatly improved the supply of food in these areas. Equally important\nwas the use of fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and new machines. Today, China\nand India are self-sufficient in basic foods, while Thailand and Vietnam are two\nof the top rice exporters in the world. Although hunger and famine still persist in\nsome regions of the world, especially in Africa, many people accept that they would\nbe much worse without using these innovations.\n10.2.2 Commercial Agriculture\nCommercial agriculture, generally practiced in core countries outside the\ntropics, is developed primarily to generate products for sale to food processing\nPage | 196 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\ncompanies. An exception is plantation farming, a form of commercial agriculture\nwhich persists in developing countries side by side with subsistence. Unlike the small\nsubsistence farms (1-2 hectares\/2-5 acres), the average of the commercial farm\nsize is over 150 hectares\/370 acres (178 ha\/193 acres U.S.) and, being mechanized,\nmany of them are family owned and operated. Mechanization also determines\nthe percentage of the labor force in agriculture, with many developed countries\nbeing even below two percent of the total employment, such as Israel, the United\nKingdom, Germany, the United States, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden\n(Figure 10.6). Moreover, as the result of industrialization and urbanization, many\ndeveloped countries continue to lose significant areas of agricultural land. North\nAmerica, for example, had 28.3 percent agricultural land out of the total land area\nin 1961 and 26 percent in 2014. The European Union decreased its agricultural\nland from 54.7 percent to 43.8 percent for the same period, during which some\ncountries recorded outstanding decreases, such as Ireland from 81.9 to 64.8\npercent, the United Kingdom from 81.8 to 71.2 percent, and Denmark from 74.6 to\n62.2 percent to mention only a few. In addition to the high level of mechanization,\nin order to increase their productivity, commercial farmers use scientific advances\nin research and technology such as the Global Positioning System (autonomous\nprecision seed-planting robot, intelligent systems for animal monitoring, savings\nin field vegetable-growing through the use of a GPS automatic steering system),\nand satellite imagery (finding efficient routes for selective harvesting based on\nremote sensing management).\nClimate regions also play an important role in determining agricultural regions.\nIn developed countries, these regions can be individualized as six types of commercial\nagriculture: mixed crop and livestock, grain farming, dairy farming, livestock\nranching, commercial gardening and fruit farming, and Mediterranean agriculture\nMixed Crop and Livestock\nMixed crop and livestock farming extends over much of the eastern United\nStates, central and western Europe, western Russia, Japan, and smaller areas in\nSouth America (Brazil and Uruguay) and South Africa. The rich soils, typically\ninvolving crop rotation, produce high yields primarily of corn and wheat, adding\nalso soybeans, sugar beets, sunflower, potatoes, fruit orchards, and forage crops for\nlivestock. In practice, there is a wide variation in mixed systems. At a higher level,\na region can consist of individual specialized farms (corn, for example) and service\nsystems that together act as a mixed system. Other forms of mixed farming include\ncultivation of different crops on the same field or several varieties of the same crop\nwith different life cycles, using space more efficiently and spreading risks more\nuniformly. The same farm may grow cereal crops or orchards, for example, and\nkeep cattle, sheep, pigs, or poultry (Figure 10.13).\nPage | 197 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nFigure 10.13 | Crop-livestock Integration\nSheep grazing under tall-stemmed fruit trees (the Netherlands).\nAuthor | FAO\nSource | FAO\nLicense | \u00a9 FAO. Used with permission.\nGrain Farming\nCommercial grain farming is an extensive and mechanized form of agriculture.\nThis is a development in the continental lands of the mid-latitudes (mostly\nbetween 30\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 North and South latitudes), in regions that are too dry for\nmixed crop and livestock farming. The major world regions of commercial grain\nfarming are located in Eurasia (from Kiev, in Ukraine, along southern Russia, to\nOmsk in western Siberia and Kazakhstan) and North America (the Great Plains).\nIn the southern hemisphere, Argentina, in South America, has a large region of\ncommercial grain farming, and Australia has two such areas, one in the southwest\nand another in the southeast. Commercial grain farming is highly specialized\nand, generally, one single crop is grown. The most important crop grown is wheat\n(winter and spring), used to make flour (Figure 10.14). The wheat farms are very\nlarge, ranging from 240 to 16,000 hectares (593-40000 acres). The average size of\na farm in the U.S. is about 1000 acres (405 hectares). In these areas land is cheap,\nmaking it possible for a farmer to own very large holdings.\nPage | 198 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\n180oW 140o 100o 60o 20o 0o 20o 60o 100o 140o 180oE\n60oN ARCTIC 60oN\nOCEAN\nO\nPE\nR\nU\nE\n40o NORTH 40o\nAMERICA\nNORTH ATLANTIC A S IA\nOCEAN\nTropic of Cancer\n20o 20o\nPACIFIC\nPACIFIC A F R I C A OCEAN\nOCEAN\nINDIAN\nOCEAN\nSOUTH\nAMERICA\n20o 20o\nTropic of Capricorn SOUTH ATLANTIC AUSTRALIA\nOCEAN\n40o EXTENSIVE COMMERCIAL GRAIN FARMING 40o\nSOUTHERN OCEAN\n60oS A N T A R C T I C A 60oS\n180oW 140o 100o 60o 20o 0o 20o 60o 100o 140o 180oE\nFigure 10.14 | World Commercial Grain Farming\nAuthor | CIET NCERT\nSource | NROER\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nDairy Farming\nDairy farming is a branch of agriculture designed for long-term production of\nmilk, processed either on a farm or at a dairy plant, for sale. It is practiced near large\nurban areas in both developed and developing countries. The location of this type\nof farm is dictated by the highly perishable milk. The ring surrounding a city where\nfresh milk is economically viable, supplied without spoiling, is about a 100-mile\nradius. In the 1980s and 1990s, robotic milking systems were developed and\nintroduced in some developing countries, principally in the EU (Figure 10.15).\nThere is an important variation in the pattern of dairy production worldwide.\nMany countries that are large producers consume most of this internally, while\nothers, in particular New Zealand, export a large percentage of their production,\nsome from the organic farms (Figure 10.16).\nPage | 199 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nFigure 10.15 | Rotary Milking Parlor Figure 10.16 | Calves at Organic Dairy Farm\nAuthor | Gunnar Richter Author | Julia Rubinic\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0 License | CC BY 2.0\nLivestock Ranching\nRanching is the commercial grazing of livestock on large tracts of land. It is an\nefficient way to raise livestock to provide meat, dairy products, and raw materials for\nfabrics. Contemporary ranching has become part of the meat-processing industry.\nPrimarily, ranching is practiced on semiarid or arid land where the vegetation is too\nsparse and the soil too poor to support crops, being a vital part of economies and\nrural development around the world. In Australia, like in the Americas, ranching is\na way of life (Figure 10.17). In the United States, near Greeley, Colorado, there is\nthe world\u2019s largest cattle feedlot, with over 120,000 head, a subsidiary of the food\ngiant ConAgra (Figure 10.18). The largest beef-producing company in the world\nis the Brazilian multinational corporation JBS-Friboi. Argentina and Uruguay are\nthe world\u2019s top per capita consumers of beef. China is the leading producer of pig\nmeat while the United States leads in the production of chicken and beef.\nFigure 10.17 | Ranching Figure 10.18 | Feedlot in the Texas Panhandle\nAuthor | William Henry Jackson Author | User \u201cH2O\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain License | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 200 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nCommercial Gardening and Fruit Farming\nA market garden is a relatively small-\nscale business, growing vegetables, fruits,\nand flowers (Figure 10.19). The farms are\nsmall, from under one acre to a few acres\n(.5-1.5 hectares). The diversity of crops is\nsometimes cultivated in greenhouses, dis-\ntinguishing it from other types of farming.\nCommercial gardening and fruit farming\nis quite diverse, requiring more manual\nlabor and gardening techniques. In the\nUnited States, commercial gardening and\nfruit farming is the predominant type of\nagriculture in the Southeast, the region\nwith a warm and humid climate and a\nlong growing season. In addition to the\ntraditional vegetables and fruits (tomatoes,\nlettuce, onions, peaches, apples, cherries),\na new kind of commercial gardening has Figure 10.19 | Market Farming\nA garden with edible plants for use in a culinary\ndeveloped in the Northeast.

Market gardening has become\nan alternative business, significantly profitable and sustainable especially with the\nrecent popularity of organic and local food.\nMediterranean Agriculture\nThe term \u2018Mediterranean agriculture\u2019 applies to the agriculture done in those\nregions which have a Mediterranean type of climate, hot and dry summers and\nmoist and mild winters. Five major regions in the world have a Mediterranean type\nof agriculture, such as the lands that border the Mediterranean Sea (South Europe,\nNorth Africa, and the Middle East), California, central Chile, South Africa\u2019s Cape,\nand in parts of southwestern and southern Australia (Figure 10.20). Farming\nis intensive, highly specialized and varied in the kinds of crops raised. The hilly\nMediterranean lands, also known as \u2018orchard lands of the world,\u2019 are dominated\nby citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, and grapefruits), olives (primary for cooking oil),\nfigs, dates, and grapes (primarily for wine), which are mainly for export. These and\nother commodities flow to distant markets, Mediterranean products tending to be\npopular and commanding high prices. Yet, the warm and sunny Mediterranean\nclimate also allows a wide range of other food crops, such as cereals (wheat,\nespecially) and vegetables, cultivated especially for domestic consumption.\nPage | 201 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nFigure 10.20 | Mediterranean Regions\nAuthor | User \u201cme ne frego\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPlantation Farming\nPlantations are large landholdings in developing regions designed to produce\ncrops for export. Usually, they specialize in the production of one particular crop\nfor market laid out to produce coffee, cocoa, bananas, or sugar in South and Central\nAmerica; cocoa, tea, rice, or rubber in West and East Africa; tea in South Asia;\nrubber in Southeast Asia, and\/or other specialized and luxury crops such as palm\noil, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco (Figures 10.21 and 10.22). Plantations are\nlocated in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America\nand, although they are located in the developing countries, many are owned and\noperated by European or North American individuals or corporations. Even those\ntaken by governments of the newly independent countries continued to be operated\nby foreigners in order to receive income from foreign sources. These plantations\nsurvived during decolonization, continuing to serve the rich markets of the world.\nUnlike coffee, sugar, rice, cotton and other traditional crops, exported from\nlarge plantations, other crops can be required by the international market such as\nflowers and specific fruits and vegetables. These represent the nontraditional\nagricultural exports, which have become increasingly important in some\ncountries or regions such as Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Central\nAmerica, to mention a few. One important reason for sustaining nontraditional\nPage | 202 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nexports is that they complement the traditional exports, generating foreign\nexchange and employment. Thus, plantation agriculture, designed to produce\ncrops for export, is critical to the economies of many developing countries.\nFigure 10.21| Coffee Plantation Figure 10.22 | Tea Plantation\nAuthor | User \u201cPrince Tigereye\u201d Author | User \u201cJoydeep\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY 2.0 License | CC BY SA 3.0\n10.3 GLOBAL CHANGES IN FOOD PRODUCTION\nAND CONSUMPTION\n10.3.1 Commercial Agriculture and Market Forces\nFarming is part of agribusiness as\na complex political and economic system\nthat organizes food production from the\ndevelopment of seeds to the retailing and\nconsumption of the agricultural product.\nAlthough farming is just one stage of the\ncomplex economic process, it is incorporated\ninto the world economic system of capitalism\n(globalized). Most farms are owned by\nindividual families, but, in this context, many\nother aspects of agribusiness are controlled\nby large corporations. Consequently, this\ntype of farming responds to market forces\nFigure 10.23 | Von Th\u00fcnen Model\nrather than to feeding the farmer. Using The dot represents a city.

More specifically, its agriculture has changed\nin response to the restructuring of the global food system and, at the same time, is\nresponding to a new global food regime. For New Zealand to remain competitive,\nfarmers have to intensify production of high added value or more customized\nproducts, also focusing on nontraditional exports such as kiwi, Asian pears,\nvegetables, flowers, and venison (meat produced on deer farms) (Figure 10.24).\nThe New Zealand agricultural sector is unique in being the only developed country\nto be totally exposed to the international markets since the government subsidies\nwere removed.\nFigure 10.24 | Deer Farm, New Zealand\nAuthor | User \u201cLBM1948\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\n10.3.2 Biotechnology and Agriculture\nSince the 19th century, manipulation and management of biological organisms\nhave been a key to the development of agriculture. In addition to Green Revolution,\nagriculture has also undergone a Biorevolution, involving agricultural\nbiotechnology (agritech), an area of agricultural science involving the use of\nscientific tools and genetic engineering techniques to modify living organisms (or\npart of organisms) of plants and animals with the potential of outstripping the\nproductivity increases of the Green Revolution and, at the same time, reducing\nagricultural production costs. Within the agricultural biotechnology process,\nPage | 204 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\ndesired traits are exported from a particular species of crop or animal to the different\nspecies obtaining transgenic crops, which possess desirable characteristics in terms\nof flavor, color of flowers, growth rate, size of harvested products, and resistance to\ndiseases and pests (BT corn, for example, can produce its own pesticides).\nBy removing the genetic material from one organism and inserting it into the\npermanent genetic code of another, the biotech industry has created an astounding\nnumber of organisms that are not produced by nature. It has been estimated that\nupwards of 75 percent of processed foods on supermarket shelves \u2013 from soda to\nsoup, crackers to condiments \u2013 contain genetically engineered ingredients. So far,\nlittle is known about the impacts of genetically modified (GM) foods on human\nhealth and the environment. Consequently, it is difficult to sort the benefits from\nthe costs of their increasing incorporation into global food production. The United\nStates is the leader not only for the number of the genetically engineered (GE) food\ncrops but also for the largest areas planted with commercialized biotech crops.\nMany countries, in Europe, for example, consider that the genetic modification\nhas not been proved safe, the reason for which they require all food to be labeled\nand refuse to import GM food. Yet, in the United States, genetic modification is\npermitted, taking into consideration that there is no evidence yet supporting that\nit is dangerous. Many people instead consider that they have the right to decide\nwhat they eat and, consequently, in their opinion, labeling of GM products must be\nmandatory. Protests against GMO regulatory structures have been very effective\nin many counties including the United States (Figure 10.25).\nFigure 10.25 | Protest against GMOs\nAuthor | Rosalee Yagihara\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 2.0\nPage | 205 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nCurrently, over 60 countries around the world require labeling of genetically\nmodified foods, including the 28 nations in the European Union, Japan, Australia,\nBrazil, Russia, India, South Africa, China, and other countries (Figure 10.26). The\ndebates regarding labeling certainly will continue. Since no one knows whether GM\nfoods are entirely bad or entirely good, regulatory structures are crucial, protecting\nhuman health and the environment.\nFigure 10.26 | GM Labeling Around the Globe\nAuthor | User \u201cCo9man\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC 0\n10.3.3 Food and Health\nSince the end of World War II, the world\u2019s technically and economically\nfeasible food production potential has significantly expanded. As a result, today,\nthere is more than enough food to feed all the people on the Earth (Figure 10.27)\nYet, the major issue is the access to food, which is uneven, the reason for which\nmillions of individuals in both the core and the periphery are affected by poverty,\npreventing them from securing adequate nutrition.\nFigure 10.27 | Population &\nFood supply\nAuthor | FAO\nSource | Infogram\nLicense | \u00a9 FAO. Used with permission.\nPage | 206 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nHunger, chronic (long-term) or acute (short-term), therefore, is one of\nthe most pressing issues facing the world today. Chronic hunger, also known as\nundernutrition, is an inadequate consumption of the necessary nutrients and\/\nor calories. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\nconsiders necessary at least 1,800 kcal\/day for an individual to consume in order\nto maintain a healthy life. The world average consumption is 2,780 kcal\/day, but\nthere is a significant difference between developed countries, with an average of\n3,470 kcal\/day (3,800 kcal\/day in the U.S.), and developing countries, recording\nan average of 2,630 kcal\/day (even less in sub-Saharan countries). FAO estimates\nthat currently about 800 million people are undernourished globally, significantly\nless than in the early 1990s, but the majority continue to be counted in southern\nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 10.28). One form of hunger is famine,\nan acute starvation caused even by a population\u2019s command over food resources,\nnatural disasters (e.g., drought, Ethiopia in 1984-1985), or wars. In contrast, in\nNorth America, the United States especially, where the food is abundant and\ninspected for quality, overeating is a national problem, the reason for which the\ngeneral condition of the population is reflected more by obesity (Figure 10.29).\nFigure 10.29 | U.S. Adult obesity rates, 2016\nAuthor | CDC\nSource | CDC\nLicense | Public Domain\nNutritional vulnerability is conceptualized in terms of the notion of food\nsecurity. According to FAO, food security exists when all people, at all times,\nhave access to food for an active and healthy life. Related to food security is the\nconcept of food sovereignty, which is the right of people, communities, and\ncountries to define their own agricultural policies. One factor connected with\nPage | 207 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nfood in general and food sovereignty especially is the fact that more cropland is\nredirected to raising biofuels, fuels derived from biological materials. They not\nonly have a significant and increasing impact on global food systems but also result\nin evictions of small farmers and poor communities.\n10.3.4 Sustainable Agriculture\nAlongside the emergence of a core-oriented food regime especially of\nfresh fruits and vegetables, a new orientation in agriculture is sustainability.\nAccording to the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI), \u201csustainable\nagriculture is the efficient production of safe, high quality agricultural products,\nin a way that protects and improves the natural environment, the social and\neconomic conditions of farmers, their employees and local communities, and\nsafeguards the health and welfare of all farmed species\u201d (SAI Platform 2010-\n2018) . More specifically, sustainability in agriculture is the increased commitment\nto organic farming, the principles and practices for sustainable agriculture\ndeveloped by SAI being articulated around three main pillars: society, economy,\nand environment.\nAlthough organic food production is not the primary mode of the agricultural\npractice, it has already become a growing force alongside the dominant conventional\nfarming. Yet, unlike conventional farming, which promotes monoculture on large\ncommercial farms and uses chemicals and intensive hormone-practices, organic\nfarming, which puts small-scale farmers at the center of food production, does\nnot use genetically modified seeds, synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers.\nThus, sustainable agricultural practices not only promote diversity and healthy\nfood but also preserve and enhance environmental quality.\n10.4 CONCLUSION\nAgriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization,\ndomesticating species of plants and animals and creating food surpluses that\nnurtured the development of civilization. It began independently in different parts\nof the globe, both the Old and New World. Throughout history, agriculture played\na dynamic role in expanding food supplies, creating employment, and providing a\nrapidly growing market for industrial products. Although subsistence, self-sufficient\nagriculture has largely disappeared in Europe and North America, it continues today\nin large parts of rural Africa, and parts of Asia and Latin America. While traditional\nforms of agricultural practices continue to exist, they are overshadowed by the\nglobal industrialization of agriculture, which has accelerated in the last few decades.\nYet, commercial agriculture differs significantly from subsistence agriculture, as the\nmain objective of commercial agriculture is achieving higher profits.\nFarmers in both the core and the periphery have had to adjust to many changes\nthat occurred at all levels, from the local to the global. Although states have become\nimportant players in the regulation and support of agriculture, at the global level,\nPage | 208 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) has significant implications in agriculture.\nSocial reactions to genetically engineered foods have repercussions throughout the\nworld food system. Currently, the focus is especially on the option that a balanced,\nsafe, and sustainable approach can be the solution not only to achieve sustainable\nintensification of crop productivity but also to protect the environment. Therefore,\nagriculture has become a highly complex, globally integrated system, and achieving\nthe transformation to sustainable agriculture is a major challenge.\n10.5 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nagribusiness: commercial agriculture engaged in the production, processing, and\ndistribution of food\nagriculture: a science, art, and business directed to modify some specific portions of the\nEarth\u2019s surface through the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock for\nsustenance and profit\nbiofuels: fuel derived from biological materials\nbiorevolution: the genetic engineering of plant and animals with the potential to exceed\nthe production of the Green Revolution\nbiotechnology: the manipulation through genetic engineering of living organisms or\ntheir components to make or modify products or processes for specific use\ncommercial agriculture: a system in which farmers produce crops and animals\nprimarily for sale\nconventional farming: agriculture that uses chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, and\nherbicides) and\/or hormone-based practices\ncrop rotation: method in which the field under cultivation remain the same, but the crop\nis changed in order to avoid exhausting the soil\ndouble cropping: method used in the milder climates in which intensive subsistence\nfields are planted and harvested twice per year\nfamine: extreme scarcity of food\nfood regime: specific set of links, indicating the ways a particular type of food is dominant\nduring a specific time\nfood security: the situation when all people, at all times, have access to food for an active\nand healthy life\nfood sovereignty: the right of people, communities, and countries to define their own\nagricultural policies\nglobalized agriculture: agriculture increasingly influenced more at the global or regional\nlevels than at national level\ngenetically modified organisms (GMOs): organisms that have their DNA modified in\na laboratory\nPage | 209 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\nGreen Revolution: a new agricultural technology characterized by high-yield seeds\nand fertilizers exported from the core to the periphery in order to increase their\nagricultural productivity\nhunting and gathering: activities through which people obtain food from hunting wild\nanimals, fishing, and gathering fruits, nuts and roots\nintensive subsistence agriculture: a form of subsistence agriculture in which farmers\ninvolve the effective and efficient use of small parcels of land in order to maximize\ncrop yield per hectare\nnontraditional agricultural exports: new export crops that contrast with traditional\nexports\norganic farming: a method of crop and livestock production without commercial\nfertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones, and genetically modified organisms\npastoralism: subsistence activity that involves the breeding and herding of animals to\nsatisfy the human needs of food, shelter, and clothing\npastoral nomadism: a traditional form of subsistence agriculture in which the\npastoralists travel with their herds over long distances and with no fixed pattern\nplantation: large landholdings in developing regions specialized in the production of one\nor two crops usually for export to more developed countries\nranching: a form of commercial agriculture in which the livestock graze over an extensive\narea\nshifting cultivation: a form of subsistence agriculture, which involves a kind of natural\nrotation system\nslash-and-burn agriculture: a method for obtaining more agricultural land in which\nfields are cleared (swidden) by slashing the vegetation and burning the debris\nsubsistence agriculture: farming designed to grow food only to sustain farmers and\ntheir families, consuming most of that they produce without entering into cash\neconomy of the country\nsustainable agriculture: the efficient production of safe, high quality agricultural\nproducts, in a way that protects and improves the natural environment,\nthe social and economic conditions of farmers, and safeguards the health\nand welfare of all farmed species\nswidden: land that is cleared for planting using the slash-and-burn process\ntranshumance: a seasonal vertical movement by herding the livestock to cooler, greener\nhigh country pastures in the summer and returning them to lowland settings for\nfall and winter grazing\nundernourishment\/undernutrition: inadequate dietary consumption that is below\nthe minimum requirement for maintaining a healthy life\nPage | 210 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY AGRICULTURE AND FOOD\n10.6 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\nAlexandratos, N. and Bruinsma, J. 2012.

Products are designed in one place, assembled\nin another from parts produced in multiple other places. These products are\nmarketed nearly everywhere. Until a few decades ago, such a process would\nhave been impossible. Two hundred years ago, such an idea would have been\nbeyond comprehension. What happened to change the world in such a way. What\neventually tied all the economies of the world into a global economy? Industry\ndid. The Industrial Revolution changed the world as much as the Agricultural\nRevolution. Industry has made the modern lifestyle possible.\nFigure 11.2 | The Volkswagen Jetta\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is designed in Germany and assembled in Mexico from parts from the represented\ncountries. It is marketed as \u201cGerman Engineered.\u201d Does it matter if the car wasn\u2019t made in Germany from\nGerman parts?\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 217 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something very peculiar happened.\nCandidates from both major parties (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) agreed\nover and over again on one thing (and only one thing). The U.S. needed to create\nand\/or bring back manufacturing jobs. Both candidates promised, if elected,\nto create new, well-paid manufacturing jobs. This was an odd shift, because for\nthe previous 40+ years Republicans typically embraced free trade that allows\nmanufacturers to choose where and what to produce (and many chose to move\noperations outside of the U.S.), while Democrats claimed to be working for the\ninterests of blue-collar, working class people, whose jobs and wages had diminished\nsince the 1980s period of de-industrialization both in the U.S. and throughout\nthe developed\/industrialized world. In the U.S. manufacturing provided jobs to\n13 million workers in 1950, rising to 20 million in 1980 but by 2017 that number\nwas back to 12 million \u2013 similar to levels last seen in 1941. A similar story can\nbe found in Great Britain where jobs in manufacturing in 2017 were half of what\nthey were in 1978 and output that once was 30% of GDP accounts for only 10% in\n2017. Similar stories can be found in Germany, Japan, and other \u2018industrialized\u2019\neconomies. You may ask yourself, \u201cWhere did all of those jobs go?\u201d But if you think\nabout it, you can probably come up with your own answers.\nIt\u2019s important to note that even as jobs declined, manufacturing output in most\nindustrialized countries continued to increase, so fewer people were producing\nmore things. The first and simplest explanation for this is automation. For years,\nscience fiction writers have warned us that the robots are coming. In the case\nof manufacturing technology\u2026they\u2019re already here! Workers today are aided by\nsoftware, robots, and sophisticated tools that have simply replaced millions of\nworkers. Working at a manufacturing facility is no longer simply a labor-intensive\neffort, but one that requires extensive training, knowledge, and willingness to\nlearn new technologies all the time. The second explanation is the relocation of\nmanufacturing from wealthy countries to poorer ones because of lower wages in\nthe latter.\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, most countries have moved away from\nthe protectionist model of development, allowing corporations to choose for\nthemselves the location of production. No better example of this shift can be\nfound than Walmart, which in the 1970\u2019s advertised that the majority of all of the\nproducts it sold were made in the USA. Thirty years later, it would be difficult for\nto find ANY manufactured product that was still \u2018made in the USA\u2019. A third reason\nfor the decline in manufacturing jobs is a decrease in demand for certain types\nof items. Steel production in the U.S. and England dropped precipitously during\nthe period of deindustrialization (since the 1980\u2019s) not just due to automation or\ncheaper wages elsewhere, but also because demand for steel also declined. During\nthe 20th century the U.S., Europe, and Japan required enormous amounts of steel\nin the construction of bridges, dams, railroad, skyscrapers, and even automobiles.\nBuilding of such items in the 21st century has slowed down, not because those\ncountries are in decline, but because there is a limit as to how many bridges and\nPage | 218 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nskyscrapers are needed in any country! Demand for steel in a country diminishes as\nGDP per capita reaches about $20,000. Meanwhile, demand for steel will continue\nto rise in Japan and India for several years as they (and other industrializing\ncountries) continue to expand cities, rail lines, and other large-scale construction\nprojects. Such a decline in steel production does NOT mean that a country is in\ndecline, but rather that there has been a shift in the type of manufacturing that\noccurs. The U.S., Germany, and Japan all continue to increase manufacturing\noutput (Figure 11.3), even as their share of global output continues to decline.\nFigure 11.3 | Leading Countries in Manufacturing Output, 2013\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nAnother significant shift in manufacturing relates specifically to the geography\nof production and is best understood in the consideration of 2 different modes\nof production: 1) Fordism 2) Post-Fordism. Fordism is associated with the\nassembly line style of production credited to Henry Ford, who dramatically\nimproved efficiency by instituting assembly line techniques to specialize\/simplify\njobs, standardize parts, reduce production errors, and keep wages high. Those\ntechniques drove massive growth in manufacturing output throughout most of the\n20th century and brought the cost of goods down to levels affordable by the masses.\nNearly all of the automobile assembly plants located in and around the Great Lakes\nregion of North America adopted the same strategies, which also provided healthy\namounts of competition and new innovation for decades, as North America became\nthe world\u2019s leading producer of automobiles. Post-Fordism begins to take hold\nin the 1980\u2019s as a new, global mode of production that seeks to relocate various\nPage | 219 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\ncomponents of production across multiple places, regions, and countries. Under\nFordism, the entire unit would be produced locally, while Post-Fordism seeks the\nlowest cost location for every different component, no matter where that might be.\nConsider an optical, wireless mouse for a moment. The optical component may\ncome from Korea, the rubber cord from Thailand, the plastic from Taiwan, and\nthe patent from the U.S. Meanwhile, all of those items are most likely transported\nto China, where low-wage workers manually assemble the finished project and an\nautomated packing system boxes and wraps it for shipping to all corners of the\nworld. Global trade has been occurring for hundreds of years, dating back to the\ndays of the Silk Road, Marco Polo, and the Dutch East India Company, but Post-\nFordism, in which a single item is comprised of multiple layers of manufacturing\nfrom multiple places around the world, is a very recent innovation. The system\nhas reconfigured the globe, such that manufacturers are constantly searching for\nnew locations of cheap production. Consumers tend to benefit greatly from the\nsystem in that even poor middle school students in the U.S. can somehow afford\nto own a pocket computer (smart phone) that is more powerful than the most\nadvanced computer system in the world from the previous generation. This is kind\nof a miracle. On the other hand, manufacturing jobs that once were a pathway to\nupward economic mobility, no longer assure people of such a decent standard of\nliving as they once did.\n11.1.1 History of Industrialization\nIndustrialization was not a process that emerged, fully-formed in England in\nthe eighteenth century. It was the result of centuries of incremental developments\nthat were assembled and deployed in the 18th century. Early industrialization\ninvolved using water power to run giant looms that produced cloth at a very low\ncost. This early manufacturing didn\u2019t use coal and belch smoke into the sky, but\nit initiated an industrial mindset. Costs could be reduced by relying on inanimate\npower (first water, then steam, then electricity), converting production to simple\nsteps that cheap low-skilled laborers could do (Taylorism), getting larger and\nconcentrated in an area (economy of scale), and cranking out large numbers of the\nsame thing (Fordism). This is industry in a nutshell. The advantage of industry\nwas that a company could sell a cheaper product, but at a greater profit.\nAs this mindset was applied to other goods, and then services, the world was\nchanged forever. Places which had been producing goods for millennia suddenly\n(really suddenly) found themselves competing with a product that was far cheaper.\nEconomist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term \u201ccreative destruction\u201d to describe\nthe process in which new industries destroy old ones. Hand production of goods\nfor the masses began to decline precipitously. They quickly became too expensive\nin comparison to manufactured goods. Today, hand produced goods are often\nreserved for the wealthy.\nA contemporary example of the industrial mode of production is fast food.\nLooking inside the kitchen of a fast food restaurant will reveal industrially prepared\nPage | 220 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\ningredients prepared just in time for sale to a customer. It is not the same process\nthat you would use at home.\nIn the abstract, companies do not exist to provide jobs or even to make things.\nCompanies exist to produce a profit. If changing the method of making a profit\nis necessary, then the company will do that in order to survive. If it cannot, then\nit will go away. For example, many companies today are highly diversified, for\nexample Mitsubishi produces such unrelated products as cars and tuna fish. What\nis the connection between the two. They both produce profit.\n11.1.2 Industrial Geography\nHow is industry related to geography? For one thing, industrial societies have\nmore goods in them. Since the goods are cheaper, people just have more things.\nFor another, the means of production, the factories, shipping terminals, and\ndistribution centers are visible for anyone to see. The lifestyles of industrialized\npeople are different. Pre-industrialized societies are not regulated by clocks,\nfor example, people wear lass-produced similar clothing. They listen to globally\nmarketed music. If it seems like you already read this in the chapter on pop culture,\nyou have. Pop culture is a function of industry. Geography is concerned with places\nand industry changed the way the world operates. It changed the relationships\nbetween places. Places that industrialized early gained the ability to economically\nand politically dominate other parts of the world that had not industrialized.\nSomething as simple as having access to cheap, mass produced guns had impacts\nfar beyond mere trade relationships.\nFigure 11.4 | Map of Medium- And High-Tech Manufacturing Value Added\nShare in Total Manufacturing1\nAuthor | David Dorrell\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 221 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nOver time industrial production changed from one that disrupted local\neconomies to one that completely changed the relationship that most human beings\nhad with their material culture, their environment, and with one another. Industry\nhas improved standards of living and increased food production on one hand and it\nhas despoiled environments and promoted massive inequality on the other.\nIndustrialization is about applying rational thought to production of goods.\nSpecifically, this form of rational thought refers to discovering ways to reduce\nunnecessary labor, materials, capital (money), and time. In the same way that\nfactories changed how things were produced, it also changed where things were\nproduced. Locational criteria are used to determine where a factory even gets built.\n11.2 MARX\u2019S TENDENCY OF THE RATE OF PROFIT\nTO FALL\nKarl Marx spent his working life trying to understand the nature of production.\nOne of the things he noticed was that products have lifespans. When they are\ninvented, they are new on the market and the producer has a monopoly. As soon as\na product is released, competitors will quickly begin to provide alternative products\nat a lower price. The race begins to produce the product at an ever cheaper price,\nbut also with an acceptable level of profit. This process occurs across both time and\nspace as any mechanism possible to reduce the cost to manufacture the product is\ndiscovered and used.\nAdvancements in materials will often occur. Instead of using a metal case, plastic\nmay be good enough. Capital infusion may allow automation of the production.\nEventually, after every other possibility to reduce costs is exhausted, the only way\nto maintain production is to cut labor costs. Few workers will accept a dramatic\nreduction in pay. It\u2019s time to move the factory to a place with lower labor costs.\nMarx called this footloose capitalism. We call it offshoring. It\u2019s the same thing and\nit has always been part of capitalism. One aspect of this is that we who have grown\nup in a capitalistic world just naturally expect the price of goods to fall over time.\nIn the United States we experienced a shift in manufacturing from the Northeast\nto the Midwest, then to the South and West. People in the United States have long\nmoved to follow employment, and only stopped doing so when it left the confines\nof the country.\n11.3 FACTORS FOR LOCATION\nIndustrial location is a balance between capital, material, and labor and\nmarkets. The goal is overall lowest cost. Sometimes pushing down one category, like\nlabor, can increase other costs, like transportation. Substitution is possible across\ncategories. For example, additional capital can replace labor through automation.\nEarlier factories were built in cities in order to use the labor that was available\nthere. Building in the middle of nowhere could have created an immediate labor\nshortage. Of course, labor will also migrate to places with available employment.\nPage | 222 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nSome industrial activities are determined by site, the physical characteristic of\na location. If you want to have a coal mine, it is probably a good idea to locate in a\nplace that has coal. This is the most extreme form of restriction, but bear in mind\nthat many places have mineral wealth, but not all of them are extracting that wealth\nright now. Many places that would otherwise be candidates for resource extraction\nare not currently being used because the resources cannot be extracted and sold\nfor a profit. If the resource cannot make money, it will not be used. Remember\nthat government subsidies can make some resources more profitable than they\nnormally would be.\nOther industrial locations are products of their situation. The maquiladoras\nthat line the southern side of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo in Mexico) border would\nnot be there if the United States were not on the other side of the river. The\nproximity to the United States is the determining characteristic in the choice to\nlocate there. Industries moved to Mexico because it appeared to make economic\nsense to do so. They were able to lower labor costs while remaining within the\nUS\/Canadian market. Transportations costs increased initially, but transportation\ncosts overall have fallen due to more efficient methods of moving goods. Were the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to be revoked the situation of\nMexico would change, their access to the markets of the United States and Canada\nwould diminish, and the factories that are there would have a much harder time\nselling their goods.\n11.3.1 Land (or Materials\/Energy) Costs\nClassic economics lumped raw materials and energy under the category of\nland. Few companies bother to buy the land that produces a particular material,\nnor do they generally invest in power generation, or their own oil fields. These\ninputs are subject to the same price pressures as everything other part of the\nmanufacturing process.\nThe land that a factory sits on has become less important over time. In earlier\nfactories, most workers walked to work and factories were compelled to locate\non expensive land in cities. That is no longer the case. Due to the widespread\ndiffusion of the automobile, factories can be built in more suburban or even rural\nareas and workers will commute to the factory. This shifts part of the cost of\nsecuring labor onto the workers themselves. It lowers costs for the company. It\nis still necessary for the company to have access to the transport network, so new\nfactories are usually built to take advantage of existing road networks, often next\nto interstates.\nSourcing materials has become global. Commodified inputs like steel are\nbought wherever they are relatively cheap and are shipped to where they are\nneeded. Whichever source provider has the lowest cost, including shipping,\nwill likely be chosen by the company. If you have ever bough something online,\ngenerally you want to know which company has the product with the lowest overall\nprice. Companies operate the same way.\nPage | 223 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nThere are differences in energy costs across space. For energy intensive\nindustrial activities, cheap energy is essential. China rose from producing very\nlittle steel a few decades ago to leading the world today. It this by leveraging low\nlabor costs and a very cheap energy source- vast supplies of (highly-polluting) coal.\n11.3.2 Labor\nLabor costs can be reduced in a number of ways. One way is simply to pay the\nworkers that you have less money. Workers, however do not like having their pay\ncut. Sending the work to a place with lower wages has been a common response\nto higher wages. A large portion of industrial labor requires minimal education. A\ncompany can choose to hire high school graduates in wealthy countries for a high\nwage or equivalently educated workers in poorer countries for far less. The labor\npool has thus become globalized. Instead of competing for jobs with the other\nworkers in a particular city, today\u2019s workers are competing for jobs with much\nof the human population. Labor-intensive industries are particularly sensitive to\nlabor costs. Clothing production has shifted to places with cheap labor as wages in\ndeveloped countries have increased.\nBesides the option of simply shipping jobs offshore, there is also the option\nof replacing workers outright. Most of the industrial jobs that have been lost in\nthe United States in the last 30 years have not been to overseas production, they\nhave been due to automation. Replacing people with machines is as old as industry\nitself. The difference now is that machines are much more capable than they were\nin the past and they are much cheaper. Referencing the earlier example of clothing\nmanufacture, production of athletic shirts in the United States got a large boost with\nthe introduction of a factory in Little Rock, Arkansas that relies on a robot called\nSewbot. The factory will produce millions of shirts at very low costs ($.33 in labor per\nshirt). This low cost of labor renders in nearly negligible in importance compared\nto other factors, such as transporting the materials to the factory and transporting\nthe finished clothes to market. The factory was built by a Chinese company in the\ncenter of the United States to minimize transport costs. More factories will likely\nmigrate nearer their markets as the cost of labor becomes less important. Developed\ncountries are already seeing an expansion of manufacturing, but not an expansion\nof manufacturing employment, due to the influence of automation.\n11.3.3 Transportation\nAn important contributor to geographic thinking regarding industrial locations\nwas Alfred Weber (1868-1958). Weber took the concept of using lowest overall\ncost for the locations of industry and expanded it. He developed models that held\nmany inputs to manufacturing constant in order to demonstrate the importance of\ntransportation in determining least cost.\nWeber believed that transportation costs were the most relevant factor in\ndetermining the location of an industry. The best way to minimize the cost of\nPage | 224 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\ntransport depends on the raw materials being transported. There are two kinds\nof raw material, things that are more-or-less everywhere (ubiquitous) and local\nraw materials. For the ubiquitous material (e.g. water), you have more freedom to\nlocate, because it\u2019s commonly available. In this case, you should build your facility\nnear your market, then you won\u2019t really need to transport much. We see examples\nof this in the locations of breweries and soft-drink manufacture.\nOn the other hand, if the material is only in a particular place (like bauxite), then\nyou have some calculating to do. First you need to figure out if your manufacturing\ncondenses, distills or otherwise shrinks your material. We call these processes bulk-\nreducing. If you aren\u2019t doing that, but instead took small pieces and assembled\nthem into something that was harder to transport (like a tractor) then it is called\nbulk-gaining. In order to minimize transport costs for bulk-reducing activities, you\nwant to process them as close as possible to their extraction site. Examples of this\nare metal smelters and lumber mills.\nBulk-gaining processes are a little more complicated. You need to find the\nleast cost point between your source materials (which may be numerous) and\nyour market. Remember that the goal is overall lowest cost, so that involves many\ncalculations to determine which is the cheapest location, meaning your location\nmight be in between several your inputs and\/or market. A general rule of this is\nthat these sorts of businesses tend to be fairly close to their final markets.\nThere were two last considerations that Weber discussed, agglomeration and\ndeagglomeration. Weber called them secondary factors, because they were less\nimportant than the previously mentioned characteristics. Agglomeration is related\nto the idea of economy of scale. Sometimes there are advantages to having similar\nindustries near one another. Consider the manufacture of computers. Computer\nmanufacturers don\u2019t make their own components, they buy them, and they use\nsimilar tools to put them\ntogether, and they use similar\nlabor, and so forth. When\nindustries concentrate in a\nplace they can share some\nresources and split the cost.\nThis is not to say that this is\na conscious process, in many\ninstances it just develops\non its own. Degglomerative\nfactors produce diseconomies\nof scale and are responsible\nfor redistribution of industry.\nFigure 11.5 | Mills and Mines\nExamples of this could be This is a photo of a lead mine in South Dakota in the 19th Century.\nescalating prices for land or Notice the large piles of waste material left behind.\nAuthor | John C. H. Grabill\nlabor which drive production\nSource | Library of Congress\naway from an area. License | Public Domain\nPage | 225 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\n11.3.4 Reducing Transportation Costs\nContainerization has greatly changed the nature and cost of transportation.\nIn the past, transporting goods required large numbers of people to move goods\naround. People loaded and unloaded goods at break-of-bulk points. Break-of-\nbulk points were places like railroad terminals, where goods were loaded onto\ntrains, or ports, where goods were loaded into ships. Break-of-bulk points had\nlarge numbers of people loading and unloading items. Containerization changed\nthat process tremendously. Goods are now packed into large metal boxes, then\nthe bokes are moved from point to point. Cranes move the boxes from trucks to\ntrains to ships, then reverse the process the process at the shipping destination.\nIntermodal transportation assumes that a container will seamlessly be transported\nby any number of different shipping methods. The number of people necessary to\nship goods plummeted. The speed at which goods moved increased tremendously,\nsince the bottlenecks were removed from the system. Containerization is a good\nexample of an innovation that did not require a large technological shift, it simply\nrequired rationalizing a system that was labor intensive. Logistics, the commercial\nactivity of transporting goods, is the glue that holds the global production network\ntogether. Without relatively inexpensive shipping, many offshored industries\nwould not be able to make goods in distant factories, ship them to other places,\nand still make a profit.\nFigure 11.6 | Shipping Containers\nUniform size and shape allow for rapid transport and sorting at minimal cost.\nAuthor | Frank McKenna\nSource | Unsplash\nLicense | CC 0\nPage | 226 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\n11.3.5 Reducing Capital Costs\nOperating an industry has more costs than materials, labor, and shipping. Other\nfactors such as taxes, regulatory compliance, and financial incentive packages can\neither attract of repel manufacturing. These factors increased tremendously in\nimportance. It has become possible for many industries to ignite a \u201cbidding war\u201d in\norder to secure increasingly advantageous incentives to locate in a particular place.\nTax breaks, construction allowances and other benefits will be paid by the places\nthat desperately struggle to attract industries. This has triggered what has been\ndescribed as a race for the bottom as places promise more than they can afford in\nthe hopes of securing outside investment.\nAnother consideration is access to capital. Businesses often need investment\nfunds, or short-term credit. Being unable to secure capital prevents many businesses\nin developing countries from starting or continuing. Countries without banking\ninfrastructure find it nearly impossible to raise sufficient money to develop their\nown industries. Companies in countries like this are forced to hunt for financial\nbacking in other countries.\n11.3.6 Risk\nIndustries have large sunk costs. Corruption can take advantage of this to\ndemand bribes, protection money, or other expenses that siphon off profit. High\nlevels of corruption inhibit investment. Industries are risk averse. Places that are\npolitically unstable will also have difficulty industrializing, since companies will be\nreluctant to build in places where any investment could be lost in a revolution or\nother political violence. This doesn\u2019t mean that industry requires representative\ngovernment. Many places have experienced tremendous economic development\nwithout democracy. It just means that companies have to feel that any money that\nthey invest in a place is safe.\n11.3.7 Accessing a Market\nOne of the interesting examples of this concept is the number of foreign\ncompanies that establish themselves in the United States. Companies such as\nFoxconn (Taiwan), Hyundai (Korea), and BMW (Germany) build products in the\nUnited States. A good question to ask yourself would be \u201cWhy do they do that?\u201d\nIt turns out that locating in the United States is advantageous for them. First,\nthey can reduce shipping costs, we have already addressed that. Second, although\nlabor in the United States is relatively expensive, it\u2019s not appreciably different\nthan in their home markets. Third, they may be able to avoid tariffs on imports.\nFinally, being in the United States places these products near a large market. The\nNorth American market is very large, being embedded in it can be advantageous\nfor some companies.\nPage | 227 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\n11.4 THE EXPANSION (AND EVENTUAL DECLINE)\nOF INDUSTRY\n11.4.1 Transnational Corporations\nModern industry has become dominated by Transnational Corporations.\nTransnational Corporations (TNCs) have the ability to coordinate and control\nvarious processes and transactions within production networks, both within\nand between different countries. They also have the ability to take advantage\nof geographical differences of factors of production and state policies. Potential\ngeographical flexibility for sales is a final benefit.\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) is exactly what is sounds like. Companies\ninvest in other countries. The usual narrative of this in the United States is simply\noffshoring for cheaper labor. The reality is more complicated. Just consider the\nexamples above of the manufacturers who build facilities in the United States. They\naren\u2019t seeking cheap labor. America companies moving production may be seeking\nto tap into a large pool of labor, but that labor is not as cheap as it was 20 years\nago. Another reason for investing in China is the same reason that other companies\ninvest here in North America, to gain entry into a large market. Companies and\nindividuals investing in other countries have numerous motivations. Some of these\nmotivations are altruistic. There is no shortage of entities that seek to use FDI as a\nmechanism to alleviate poverty. The earlier critique of financial incentives applies\nFigure 11.7 | Medium-Tech And High-Tech Manufacturing Value Added Share In\nTotal Manufacturing\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nPage | 228 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\ndirectly of foreign direct investment, for obvious reasons. Poor and desperate\nplaces will sometimes make economic decisions that make little economic sense.\nFDI has an established history. Initially companies in wealthy countries\nwere mostly interested in extracting raw materials from other, usually poorer,\ncountries. This continues to this day. Countries like Niger, The Democratic\nRepublic of Congo, and Venezuela function almost solely as a source of inputs for\nother companies based in other countries. Other places have seen investment in\nfactories. Sometimes this is due to very low-cost labor, but in many instances, it\nis due to the fact that their wages are relatively low and they are relatively close to\ntheir market. An example of this was seen in Eastern Europe when many of these\ncountries entered the European Union.\nThe next graph is slightly different. It shows the different trajectories of\nmanufacturing in general as part of a countries economy. As you can see,\nmanufacturing as a share of GPD in the United States has been quite low for\nsome time. Manufacturing in China and Korea is much more important, but in\nboth these places, the relative value of manufacturing is falling. In Germany,\nJapan and Singapore, the value of manufacturing is rising, although at very\nmoderate levels. Note that neither of these graphs account for wages produced\nfrom manufacturing employment.\nFigure 11.8 | Manufacturing Value Added Share In GDP\nAuthor | The World Bank\nSource | The World Bank\nLicense | CC BY 4.0\nPage | 229 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\n11.5 GLOBAL PRODUCTION\n11.5.1 Hegemony and Economic Ascendency\nAt times industrialization has propelled countries to great economic heights.\nBritain, The United States and Japan all rode an industrial wave to international\nprominence. In those countries and others, a (largely mythical) golden age\ncenters around a time when low-skilled workers could earn a sufficient wage to\nsecure economic security. This is more-or-less what the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d was.\nDeindustrialization has changed the economic trajectories of these countries and\nthe people living in these countries. However, it must be noted that post-industrial\ncountries that have not seen rapid increases in poverty. Wages have been largely\nstagnant for decades, but they have not generally gone down. The largest difference\nhas to do with relative prosperity for industrial and post-industrial countries.\nCountries such as Japan, the UK or the US are no longer far wealthier than their\nneighbors. In the same way that flooding a market with a particular product\nreduces the value of that product, flooding the world with industrial capacity lowers\nthe relative value of that activity. Developing countries function as appendages\nto the larger economies in the world. The poor serve the needs of the wealthy.\nUnindustrialized countries buy goods from developed countries, or they license or\ncopy technology and make the products themselves.\n11.5.2 Space and Production\nIn the context of a globalized market, a factory built in one market may not built\nin another. This is not to say that producing goods is a zero-sum game, but there are\nlimits to the amount of any good that can be sold. It\u2019s a valid question to ask why\ntransnational corporations (TNCs) have bought into China at rates far greater than\nin Cuba, Russia, or other Communist or formerly Communist (to varying degrees)\ncountries? There is only so much spare capacity for production in the world. If one\ngiant country (China) is taking all the extra capacity, then there will be none left for\nothers. FDI is simply easier in China, since there is more bang for the buck. This\nis largely a function of population. The population of China is roughly two times\nthe population of Sub Saharan Africa. And China has a single political\/economic\nrunning class, as opposed to 55 different sets of often fractious political classes.\nIf the industrialization of Africa happens at all, it will occur after China and its\nimmediate neighbors who have been drawn into its larger economic functioning\nhave largely finished their own industrializing. An example of this proximate effect\nis seen in the shift of some industries from China to Vietnam and Indonesia.\nChina\u2019s industrialization had to do with promoting itself as a huge cheap labor\npool, and as a gigantic market for goods. It successfully leveraged both of these\ncharacteristics to attract foreign investment, and to gain foreign technology from\nthe companies that have invested in producing goods there. Industrialization\noverall seems to have slowed. The speed at which China industrialized has not been\nmatched by other countries following China. One current idea is that the world is\nPage | 230 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nin a race between industrial expansion and rapid over capacity of production. In\nother words, the reason that industrialization isn\u2019t expanding as rapidly as before is\nthat we are already making enough goods to satisfy demand. Remember that goods\nrequire demand. Unsold goods don\u2019t produce any income. If the factories in the\nworld are already producing enough, or even too much, then new factories are much\nless likely to be built. Technological advances and the massive industrialization of\nChina might have ended the expansion of industry.\nIt also appears that the highest levels of manufacturing income are well in the\npast. According to economist Dani Rodrik, the highest per capita incomes from\nmanufacturing occurred between 1965 and 1975, and has fallen dramatically since\nthen. This is even considering inflation. Many countries industrializing now only\nsee modest improvements in income. This is related to supply and demand. When\nthere are fewer factories, they make comparatively more money. When factories\nare everywhere, they are competing with everyone.\n11.5.3 Trade\nEven more than expansion of industrial production, the world has seen an\nexpansion of trade. Global trade has produced an intricate web of exchanges\nas products are now designed in one country, parts are produced in 10 others,\nassembled in yet another country, and then marketed to the world. Consider\nsomething as complex as an automobile. The parts of a car can be sourced from\nany of dozens of countries, but they all have to be brought to one spot for assembly.\nSuch coordination would have been impossible in the past.\nIndividuals can buy directly from another country on the internet, but most\ninternational trade is business-to-business. TNCs are able to conduct an internal\nform of international trade in goods that can be moved and produced in a way\nthat is most advantageous for the company. Tax breaks, easy credit and banking\nprivacy laws exist to siphon investment from one place to another.\nBecause of global trade, improvements in communication and transportation\nhave enabled some companies to enact just in time delivery, in which the parts\nneed for a product only arrive right before they are needed. The advantage of this\nis that a company has less money trapped in components in a storage facility, and\nit becomes easier to adjust production. Once again, such coordination at a global\nscale was not possible even in the relatively recent past.\n11.5.4 Deindustrialization\nHistorically industrialized countries were the wealthy countries of the world.\nIndustrialization, however, is now two centuries old. In the last decades of the\ntwentieth century, deindustrialization began in earnest in the United Kingdom,\nthe United States, and many other places. Factories left and the old jobs left with\nthem. Classical economics holds that such jobs had become less valuable, and that\nmoving them offshore was a good deal for everyone. Offshored goods were cheaper\nPage | 231 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nfor consumers, and the lost jobs were replaced by better jobs. The problem with\nthis idea is that it separates the condition of being a consumer from the condition of\nbeing a worker. Most people in any economy are workers. They can only consume\nas long as they have an income, and that is tied to their ability to work. Many\nworkers whose jobs went elsewhere found that their new jobs paid less than their\nold jobs.\n11.5.5 What Happens After Deindustrialization?\nThe simple answer to the above question is this. The service economy happens!\nAs manufacturing provides fewer jobs, service industries tend to create new\njobs. This is a very delicate balance, however. If you are a 50-year old coal miner\nwhose job has been eliminated by automation, it is very difficult for you to simply\nchange jobs and enter the \u2018service sector\u2019. This transition is very damaging to\nthose without the right skills, training, education, or geographic location. Many\nparts of the American Midwest, for example, have become known as the \u201crust\nbelt\u201d as industrial facilities closed, decayed, and literally rusted to the horror of\nthose residents who once had good jobs there. The city of Detroit, for example,\nlost nearly half of its urban population from 1970-2010. Meanwhile the state of\nIllinois loses one resident every 15 minutes as job growth has weakened in the\npost-industrial age. However, job growth and productivity in the service economy\nhave strengthened and provide more job opportunities today than the industrial\nera ever did in the U.S.\nThere are 3 sectors to every economy:\n1. Primary (agriculture, fishing, and mining)\n2. Secondary (manufacturing and construction)\n3. Tertiary (service related jobs)\nThe vast majority of economic growth in the post-industrialized world comes\nin the tertiary sector. This doesn\u2019t mean that all tertiary jobs pay well. Just ask any\nfast-food worker if the service sector is making them rich! However, service sector\njobs are very dynamic and offer tangible opportunities to millions of people around\nthe world to earn a living providing services to somebody else. We can further break\ndown the service sector into 1) public (the post office, public utilities, working for\nthe government) 2) business (businesses providing services to other businesses)\n3) consumer (anything that provides a service to a private consumer e.g. hotels,\nrestaurants, barber shops, mechanics, financial services). Traditionally, service\nsector jobs worked very much like manufacturing jobs in that employees worked\nregular hours, earned benefits from the employer, gained raises through increased\nperformance, and went to work somewhere outside of their home. Many service\njobs in the 21st century, however, have been categorized as the gig economy, in\nwhich workers serve as contractors (rather than employees), have no regular work\nschedules, don\u2019t earn benefits, and often work in isolation from other workers\nPage | 232 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\nrather than as a part of a team. Examples of \u2018jobs\u2019 in the gig economy include\nprivate tutor, Uber\/Lyft driver, AirBNB host, blogger, and YouTuber. Work, in this\neconomy, is not necessarily bound by particular places and spaces in the way that\nit did in manufacturing. Imagine a steel worker calling in to tell his\/her boss that\nthey\u2019re just going to work from home today! Even public schools have adapted to\nthis model in the following manner. As schools cancel class due to weather, the new\nnorm is to hold class online, whereby students do independent work submitted to\nthe teacher even though nobody is at school. As such, some workers are freed up\nfrom the traditional constraints of time and place and can choose to live anywhere\nas long as they maintain access to a computer and the Internet. Services like fiverr.\ncom facilitate a marketplace for freelance writers compose essays for others or\nfor graphic artists to sell their design ideas directly to customers without every\nmeeting one another.\nThe global marketplace continues to be defined as a place where the traditional\nrelationships between employer and employee are changing dramatically. A word\nof caution is necessary here, however. As many choose to celebrate the freedom\nthat accompanies flexible work schedules, there is also a darker side in that the\ntraditional \u2018contract\u2019 and social cohesive element between workers and owners is\nvery much at risk. One defining factor of the 20th century was the development of\ncivil society that fought for and won a host of protective measures for workers, who\notherwise could face abusive work conditions. Child labor laws, minimum wage,\nenvironmental safety measures, overtime pay, and guards against discrimination\nwere all based upon an employer-employee relationship that seems increasingly\nthreatened by the gig economy. Uber drivers can work themselves to exhaustion\nsince they are not employees. AirBNB hosts can skirt environmental safety\nprecautions since they do not face the same safety inspections required at hotels.\nThese are just a few examples, but they are very worth consideration. Regardless\nof the positives and negatives, the new service economy is having a transformative\neffect upon all facets of society. Although, the authors of this textbook are all\ngeography professors with PhD\u2019s from a variety of universities, perhaps the next\nversion of this textbook will simply draw upon the gig economy to seek the lowest\ncost authors who are willing to write about all things geographical. Will you be able\nto tell the difference? (We hope so!!!)\n11.6 SUMMARY\nIndustrial production changed the relationship of people to their environments.\nFolk (pre-industrial) cultures used local resources and knowledge to hand-produce\ngoods. Now the productions of goods and the provisioning of services can be split\ninto innumerable spatially discrete pieces. Competition drives the costs of goods\nand services downward providing relentless pressure to cut costs. This process has\npushed industrialization into most corners of the world as companies have looked\nfurther and further afield to find cheaper labor and materials and to find more\nPage | 233 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY INDUSTRY\ncustomers. Industrialization has fueled a change in lifestyle, as goods have become\ncheaper, they have become more accessible to more people.

Because of this\ncomplex diversity, our understanding of rural areas must consider more than\nhow land is used by nature and humans. That is, our understanding must also\nencompass the economic and social structures in rural areas in which farming and\nforestry, handicraft, and small, middle, or large companies produce and trade,\nwhere services, from the most local to the most international (such as tourism),\nare provided. In addition, some rural areas represent valuable ecological balance\nzones through preservation and\/or conservation establishments. All these factors\ncreate and evolve into a tight interdependence, interconnection, and competition.\nYet, today, over 54 percent of the world population (7,536 million)1 lives in\nurban areas and the proportion of the urban population is growing at a rapid\nrate. Thus, urbanization is one of the most important geographic phenomena in\ntoday\u2019s world. Towns and cities are in constant flux. Historically, cities have been\ninfluenced by technological developments such as the steam engine, railroads,\nthe internal combustion engine, air transport, electronics, telecommunications,\nrobotics, and the internet. As the result of the global shift to technological-,\nindustrial-, and service-based economies, the growth of cities and urbanization\nof rural areas are now irreversible. Moreover, another phase of transformation is\nunder way, involving global processes of economic, cultural, and political changes.\nWithin the cities of the developed world, the economic reorganization has\ndetermined a selective recentralization of residential and commercial land use\nconnected especially with a selective industrial decentralization. In contrast to\nthe core regions, where urbanization has largely resulted from economic growth,\nthe urbanization of peripheral regions has been a consequence of demographic\ngrowth, generating large increases in population (overurbanization) well in\nadvance of any significant levels of urban or rural economic development. Luxury\nhomes and apartment complexes, corresponding with a dynamic formal sector of\nthe economy, contrast sharply with the slums and squatter settlements of people,\nworking in the informal (not regulated by the state) sector.\n12.2 RURAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS\nThere are many types of rural settlements. Using as classification criteria the\nshape, internal structure, and streets texture, settlements can be classified into two\nbroad categories: clustered and dispersed.\nPage | 237 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\n12.2.1 Clustered Rural Settlements\nA clustered rural settlement is a rural settlement where a number of families\nlive in close proximity to each other, with fields surrounding the collection of\nhouses and farm buildings. The layout of this type of village reflects historical\ncircumstances, the nature of the land, economic conditions, and local cultural\ncharacteristics. The rural settlement patterns range from compact to linear, to\ncircular, and grid.\nCompact Rural Settlements\nThis model has a center where several public buildings are located such as the\ncommunity hall, bank, commercial complex, school, and church. This center is\nsurrounded by houses and farmland. Small garden plots are located in the first\nring surrounding the houses, continued with large cultivated land areas, pastures,\nand woodlands in successive rings. The compact villages are located either in the\nplain areas with important water resources or in some hilly and mountainous\ndepressions. In some cases, the compact villages are designed to conserve land\nfor farming, standing in sharp contrast to the often isolated farms of the American\nGreat Plains or Australia (Figure 12.1).\nFigure 12.1 | A Compact Village in India\nAuthor | User \u201cParthan\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 2.0\nPage | 238 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nLinear Rural Settlements\nThe linear form is comprised of buildings along a road, river, dike, or seacoast.\nExcluding the mountainous zones, the agricultural land is extended behind the\nbuildings. The river can supply the people with a water source and the availability\nto travel and communicate. Roads were constructed in parallel to the river for\naccess to inland farms. In this way, a new linear settlement can emerge along each\nroad, parallel to the original riverfront settlement (Figure 12.2).\nFigure 12.2 | Linear Village of Outlane\nAuthor | Mark Mercer\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 2.0\nCircular Rural Settlements\nThis form consists of a central open space surrounded by structures. Such\nsettlements are variously referred to as a Rundling, Runddorf, Rundlingsdorf,\nRundplatzdorf or Platzdorf (Germany), Circulades and Bastides (France), or\nKraal (Africa). There are no contemporary historical records of the founding of\nthese circular villages, but a consensus has arisen in recent decades. The current\nleading theory is that Rundlinge were developed at more or less the same time in\nthe 12th century, to a model developed by the Germanic nobility as suitable for\nsmall groups of mainly Slavic farm-settlers. Also, in the medieval times, villages\nin the Languedoc, France, were often situated on hilltops and built in a circular\nfashion for defensive purpose (Figures 12.3 and 12.4).\nAlthough far from the German territory, Romania has a unique, circular German\nvillage. Located southwestern Romania, Charlottenburg is the only round village\nin the country. The village was established around 1770 by Swabians who came to\nPage | 239 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nthe region as part of the second wave of German colonization. In the middle of the\nvillage is a covered well surrounded by a perfect circle of mulberry trees behind\nwhich are houses with stables, barns, and their gardens in the external ring. Due to\nits uniqueness, the beautiful village plan from the baroque era has been preserved\nas a historical monument (Figure 12.5).\nFigure 12.3 | Bastide in France\nAuthor | User \u201cChensiyuan\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 12.4 | Kraal - A circular village in Africa Figure 12.5 | Charlottenburg, Romania\nAuthor | User \u201cHp.Baumeler\u201d Author | German Wikipedia user \u201cEddiebw\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0 License | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 240 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\n12.2.2 Dispersed Rural Settlements\nDispersed Rural Settlements\nA dispersed settlement is one of the main types of settlement patterns used to\nclassify rural settlements. Typically, in stark contrast to a nucleated settlement,\ndispersed settlements range from a scattered to an isolated pattern (Figure\n12.6). In addition to Western Europe, dispersed patterns of settlements are found\nin many other world regions, including North America.\nLinear\nDispersed\nNucleated\nIsolated\nFigure 12.6 | Settlement Patterns2\nAuthor | Corey Parson\nSource | Origina Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nScattered Rural Settlements\nA scattered dispersed type of rural settlement is generally found in a variety\nof landforms, such as the foothill, tableland, and upland regions. Yet, the proper\nscattered village is found at the highest elevations and reflects the rugged terrain\nand pastoral economic life. The population maintains many traditional features\nin architecture, dress, and social customs, and the old market centers are still\nimportant. Small plots and dwellings are carved out of the forests and on the\nupland pastures wherever physical conditions permit. Mining, livestock raising,\nand agriculture are the main economic activities, the latter characterized by\nterrace cultivation on the mountain slopes. The sub-mountain regions, with hills\nand valleys covered by plowed fields, vineyards, orchards, and pastures, typically\nhave this type of settlement.\nIsolated Rural Settlements\nThis form consists of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area\nin which farmers live on individual farms isolated from neighbors rather than\nPage | 241 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nalongside other farmers in settlements. The isolated settlement pattern is dominant\nin rural areas of the United States, but it is also an important characteristic for\nCanada, Australia, Europe, and other regions. In the United States, the dispersed\nsettlement pattern was developed first in the Middle Atlantic colonies as a result\nof the individual immigrants\u2019 arrivals. As people started to move westward,\nwhere land was plentiful, the isolated type of settlements became dominant in\nthe American Midwest. These farms are located in the large plains and plateaus\nagricultural areas, but some isolated farms, including hamlets, can also be found\nin different mountainous areas (Figures 12.7 and 12.8).\nFigure 12.7 | Isolated Horse Farm\nAuthor | Randy Fath\nSource | Unsplash\nLicense | CC 0\nFigure 12.8 | Undredal, Norway\nAuthor | Micha L.

These hearth areas have experienced their first agricultural revolution,\ncharacterized by the transition from\nhunting and gathering to agricultural\nfood production. Five world regions are\nconsidered as hearth areas, providing\nthe earliest evidence for urbanization:\nMesopotamia and Egypt (both parts of\nthe Fertile Crescent of Southwest Asia),\nthe Indus Valley, Northern China, and\nMesoamerica (Figure 12.9). Over time,\nthese five hearths produced successive\ngenerations of urbanized world-empires,\nfollowed by the diffusion of urbanization\nto the rest of the world.\nThe first regions of independent\nurbanism were in Mesopotamia and\nEgypt from around 3500 B.C. Mesopo-\ntamia, the land between the Tigris and\nEuphrates rivers, was the eastern part of Figure 12.10 | Fertile Crescent\nthe so-called Fertile Crescent (Figure Author | User \u201cNormanEinstein\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\n12.10). From the Mesopotamian Basin,\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 243 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nthe Fertile Crescent stretched in an arc across the northern part of the Syrian Desert\nas far west as Egypt, in the Nile Valley. In Mesopotamia, the significant growth in\nsize of some of the agricultural villages formed the basis for the large fortified city-\nstates of the Sumerian Empire such as Ur, Uruk, Eridu, and Erbil, in present-day\nIraq. By 1885 B.C., the Sumerian city-states had been taken over by the Babylo-\nnians, who governed the region from Babylon, their capital city. Unlike in Mesopo-\ntamia, internal peace in Egypt determined no need for any defensive fortification.\nAround 3000 B.C. the largest Egyptian city was probably Memphis (over 30,000\ninhabitants). Yet, between 2000 and 1400 B.C., urbanization continued with the\nfounding of several capital cities such as Thebes and Tanis.\nAbout 2500 B.C, large urban settlements were developed in the Indus Valley\n(Mohenjo-Daro, especially), in modern Pakistan, and later, about 1800 B.C., in the\nfertile plains of the Huang He River (or Yellow River) in Northern China, supported\nby the fertile soils and extensive irrigation systems. Other areas of independent\nurbanism include Mesoamerica (Zapotec and Mayan civilizations, in Mexico) from\naround 100 B.C. and, later, Andean America from around A.D. 800 (Inca Empire,\nfrom northern Ecuador to central Chile).

In Europe,\nthe urban system was introduced by\nthe Greeks, who, by 800 B.C., founded\nfamous cities such as Athens, Sparta,\nand Corinth. The city\u2019s center, the\n\u201cacropolis,\u201d (Figure 12.12), was the\ndefensive stronghold, surrounded by\nthe \u201cagora\u201d suburbs, all surrounded by\nFigure 12.12 | Athens, Greece, Acropolis\na defensive wall. Except for Athens, with Author | Uswer \u201cJebulon\u201d\napproximately 150,000 inhabitants, Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC 0\nthe other Greek cities were quite small\nby today\u2019s standards (10,000-15,000 inhabitants). The Greek urban system,\nthrough overseas colonization, stretched from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea,\naround the Adriatic Sea, and continued to the west until Spain (Figure 12.13).\nAlthough the Macedonians conquered Greece during the 4th century BC, Alexander\nthe Great extended the Greek urban system eastward toward Central Asia. The\nlocation of the cities along Mediterranean coastlines reflects the importance of\nlong-distance sea trade for this urban civilization.\nFigure 12.13 | Greek city-states in the Mediterranean\nAuthor | User \u201cDipa1965\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 245 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nWith the impressive feats of civil engineering, the Romans had extended towns\nacross southern Europe (Figure 12.14), connected with a magnificent system of\nroads. Roman cities, many of them located inland, were based on the grid system.\nThe center of the city, \u201cforum,\u201d surrounded by a defensive wall, was designated\nfor political and commercial activities. By A.D. 100, Rome reached approximately\none million inhabitants, while most towns were small (2,000-5,000 inhabitants).\nUnlike Greek cities, Roman cities were not independent, functioning within a well-\norganized system centered on Rome. Moreover, the Romans had developed very\nsophisticated urban systems, containing paved streets, piped water and sewage\nsystems and adding massive monuments, grand public buildings (Figure 12.15),\nand impressive city walls. In the 5th century, when Rome declined, the urban\nsystem, stretching from England to Babylon, was a well-integrated urban system\nand transportation network, laying the foundation for the Western European\nurban system.\nFigure 12.14 | Roman Empire and its Colonies Figure 12.15 | Colosseum in Rome, Italy\nAuthor | User \u201cCresthaven\u201d Author | User \u201cDiliff\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0 License | CC BY SA 2.5\n12.3.2 Dark Ages\nAlthough urban life continued to flourish in some parts of the world (Middle\nEast, North and sub-Saharan Africa), Western Europe recorded a decline in\nurbanization after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth century. During\nthis early medieval period, A.D. 476-1000, also known as the Dark Ages, feudalism\nwas a rurally oriented form of economic and social organization. Yet, under Muslim\ninfluence in Spain or under Byzantine control, urban life was still flourishing.\nAs Rome was falling into decline, Constantine the Great moved the capital of\nthe Roman Empire to Byzantium, renaming the city Constantinople (current\nIstanbul, Turkey). With its strategic location for trade, between Europe and Asia,\nConstantinople became the world\u2019s largest city, maintaining this status for most of\nthe next 1000 years (Figure 12.16).\nPage | 246 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nFigure 12.16 | Byzantine Empire\nAuthor | User \u201cTataryn\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\nMost European regions, however, did have some small towns, most of which\nwere either ecclesiastical or university centers (Cambridge, England and Chartres,\nFrance), defensive strongholds (Rasnov, Romania), gateway towns (Bellinzona,\nSwitzerland), or administrative centers (Cologne, Germany). The most important\ncities at the end of the first millennium were the seats of the world-empires\/\nkingdoms: the Islamic caliphates, the Byzantine Empire, the Chinese Empire, and\nIndian kingdoms.\n12.3.3 Urban Revival in Europe\nFrom the 11th century onward, a more extensive money economy developed. The\nemerging regional specializations and trading patterns provided the foundations\nfor a new phase of urbanization based on merchant capitalism. By 1400, long\ndistance trading was well established based not only on luxury goods but also\non metals, timber, and a variety of agricultural goods. At that time, Europe had\nabout 3000 cities, most of them very small. Paris, with about 275,000 people was\nthe dominant European city. Besides Constantinople (Byzantium) and Cordoba\n(Spain), only cities from northern Italy (Milan, Florence), and Bruges (Belgium)\nhad more than 50,000 inhabitants.\nBetween the 14th and 18th centuries, fundamental changes occurred that\ntransformed not only the cities and urban systems of Europe but also the entire\nworld economy. Merchant capitalism increased in scale and the Protestant\nReformation and scientific revolution of the Renaissance stimulated\neconomic and social reorganization. Overseas colonization allowed Europeans\nto shape the world\u2019s economies and societies. Spanish and Portuguese colonists\nPage | 247 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nwere the first to extend the European urban system to the world\u2019s peripheral\nregions. Between 1520 and 1580 Spanish colonists established the basis of a Latin\nAmerican urban system. Centralization of political power and the formation\nof national states during the Renaissance determined the development of more\nintegrated national urban systems.\n12.3.4 Industrial Revolution and Urbanization\nAlthough the urbanization process had already progressed significantly by\nthe 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was a powerful factor accelerating\nfurther urbanization, generating new kinds of cities, some of them recording an\nunprecedented concentration of population. Manchester, for example, was the\nshock city of European industrialization in the 19th century, growing from a\nsmall town of 15,000 inhabitants in 1750 to a world city by 1911 with 2.3 million.\nIndustrialization spread from England to the rest of Europe during the first half\nof the 19th century and then to different parts of the world. Moreover, followed\nby successive innovations in transport technology, urbanization increased at a\nfaster pace. The canals, railroads, and steam-powered transportation reoriented\nurbanization toward the interior of the countries. In North America, the shock city\nwas Chicago, which grew from 4,200 inhabitants in 1837 to 3.3 million in 1930.\nIts growth as an industrial city followed especially the arrival of the railroads,\nwhich made the city a major transportation hub. In the 20th century, the new\ninnovations significantly helped urban development.\nBy the 19th century, urbanization had become an important dimension of the\nworld-system. The higher wages and greater opportunities in the cities (industry,\nservices) transformed them into a significant pull factor, attracting a massive influx\nof rural workers. Consequently, the percentage of people living in cities increased\nfrom 3 percent in 1800 to 54 percent in 2017.3 In developed countries, 78 percent\nlive in urban areas, compared with 49 percent in developing countries, reflecting\nthe region\u2019s and\/or the country\u2019s level of development.\n12.3.5 City-Size Distribution\nMost developed countries have a higher percentage of urban people, but\ndeveloping countries have more of the very large urban settlements (Table 1,\nFigure 12.17). In 1950, out of the world\u2019s 30 largest metropolitan areas, the first\nthree metropolitan areas were in developed countries: New York (U.S.), Tokyo\n(Japan), and London (UK), two of which (New York and Tokyo) had more than\n10 million inhabitants. After 30 years, in 1980, a significant change was recorded.\nAlthough metro New York increased from 12.3 million to 15.6 million, Tokyo, with\n28.5 million inhabitants, became the largest metropolitan area in the world, a\nposition which the city still maintains. In addition, except for Osaka, the second\nmetropolitan area from Japan, two large metropolitan areas in developing\ncountries were added, Mexico City (Mexico) and Sao Paulo (Brazil). The number\nPage | 248 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nof large metropolitan areas continued to increase after 2010, adding more\ndeveloping countries such as India (Delhi and Mumbai\/Bombay), China (Shanghai\nand Beijing), Bangladesh (Dhaka), and Pakistan (Karachi) from Asia; and Egypt\n(Cairo), Nigeria (Lagos), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) from\nAfrica. Each of these metropolitan areas is expected to have over 20 million\ninhabitants after 2020, adding Delhi and Shanghai to the largest metropolitan\nareas with over 30 million inhabitants. In the United States, New York-Newark is\nthe largest metropolitan area, in which the population was constantly increasing\nfrom 12.3 million in 1950 to 15.6 million in 1980 and 18.3 million in 2010, having\nthe potential to reach 20 million in 2030. Yet, unlike the developing countries,\ncharacterized by a very fast urban growth rate, the developed countries had\nrecorded a moderate urban growth rate.\nTable 12.1 | The World\u2019s 30 Largest Metropolitan Areas, Ranked by Population Size4\n1950, 1980, 2010, 2020, 2025, 2030 (in millions)\n1950 1980 2010 2020 2025 2030\nWorld New York-12.3 Tokyo-28.5 Tokyo-36.8 Tokyo-38.3 Tokyo-37.8 Tokyo-37.19\nTokyo-11.2 Osaka-17.0 Delhi-21.9 Delhi-29.3 Delhi-32.7 Delhi-36.06\nLondon-8.3 New York-15.6 Mexico City-20.1 Shanghai-27.1 Shanghai-29.4 Shanghai-30.7\nMexico City-13.3 Shanghai-19.9 Beijing-24.2 Beijing-26.4 Bombay-27.8\nSao Paulo-12.0 Sao Paulo-19.6 Bombay-22.8 Bombay-25.2 Beijing-27.7\nOsaka-19.4 Sao Paulo-22.1 Dhaka-24.3 Dhaka-27.3\nBombay-19.4 Mexico City-21.8 Mexico City-22.92 Karachi-24.8\nNew York- Dhaka-20.9 Sao Paulo-22.90 Cairo-24.5\nNewark-18.3 Cairo-20.5 Cairo-22.4 Lagos-24.2\nCairo-16.9 Osaka-20.5 Karachi-22.01 Mexico City-23.8\nBeijing-16.1 Osaka-20.3 Sao Paulo-23.4\nLagos-20.03 Kinshasa-20.00\nUnited New York- New York- New York- New York- New York- New York-\nStates Newark-12.3 Newark-15.6 Newark-18.3 Newark-18.7 Newark-19.3 Newark-19.89\nChicago-5.0 Los Angeles- Los Angeles- Los Angeles- Los Angeles- Los Angeles-\nLos Angeles- Long Beach- Long Beach- Long Beach- Long Beach- Long Beach-\nLong Beach- Santa Ana-9.5 Santa Ana-12.1 Santa Ana-12.4 Santa Ana-12.8 Santa Ana-\nSanta Ana 4.0 Chicago-7.2 13.26\nPhiladelphia 3.1 Philadelphia-4.5\nDetroit 2.7\nBoston 2.5\nSan Francisco-\nOakland-1.8\nSummary:\nYear 1 - 5 mil 5 - 10 mil 10 - 15 mil 15 - 20 mil 20 - 25 mil 25 - 30 mil > 30 mil\n1950 22 6 2 - - - -\n1980 6 19 2 2 - 1 -\n2010 - 7 13 7 2 - 1\n2020 - - 12 8 7 2 1\n2025 - - 10 8 7 3 2\n2030 - - 10 8 6 3 3\nPage | 249 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nFigure 12.17 | Percentage Urban and Urban Agglomerations\nAuthor | United Nations, DESA, Population Division\nSource | United Nations Population Division\nLicense | CC BY 3.0 IGO\nThe relationship between the size of cities and their rank within an urban system\nis known as rank-size rule, describing a regular pattern in which the nth-largest\ncity in a country or region is 1\/n the size of the largest city. According to the rank-size\nrule, the second-largest city is one-half the size of the largest, the third-largest city is\none-third the size of the largest city, and so on. In the United States, the distribution of\nsettlements closely follows the rank-size rule, but in other countries, the population of\nthe largest city is disproportionately large in relation to the second- and third-largest\ncity in that urban system. These cities are called primate cities (Buenos Aires, for\nexample, is 10 times larger than Rosario, the second largest city in Argentina). Yet,\ncities do not necessarily have to be primate in order to be functionally dominant\n(economic, political, cultural) within their urban system. The functional dominance\nof the city is called centrality. Moreover, some of the largest metropolises, closely\nintegrated within the global economic system and playing key roles beyond their\nown national boundaries, qualify as world cities. Today, because of the importance\nof their financial markets and associated business services, London, New York, and\nTokyo dominate Europe, the Americas, and Asia, respectively.\n12.4 URBAN PATTERNS\n12.4.1 North American Cities\nThe contemporary North American scene dramatically displays how its\npopulation has refashioned the settlement landscape to meet the needs of a modern\npostindustrial society. In North American cities, a city\u2019s center, commonly called\ndowntown, has historically been the nucleus of commercial and services land use.\nPage | 250 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nIt is also known as the central business district (CBD), usually being one of\nthe oldest districts in a city and the nodal point of transportation routes. The CBD\ngives visual expression to the growth and dynamic of the industrial city, becoming\na symbol of progress, modernity, and affluence. It contains the densest and tallest\nnonresidential buildings and its accessibility attracts a diversity of services.\nUrban decentralization also reconfigured land-use patterns in the city,\nproducing today\u2019s metropolitan areas. If during the first half of the 20th century\nthe concentric zone model was idealized, in which urban land is organized\nin rings around the CBD, today\u2019s urban model highlights new suburban growth\ncharacterized by a mix of peripheral retailing, industrial areas, office complexes, and\nentertainment facilities called \u201cedge cities.\u201d In addition, the sector and multiple\nnuclei (multiple growth points) models of urban structure were developed to\nhelp explain where different socio-economic classes tend to live in an urban area\n(Figures 12.19, 12.20, and 12.21). All models show new residential districts\nadded beyond the CBD as the city expanded, with higher-income groups seeking\nmore desirable, peripheral locations.\nFigure 12.19 | Concentric-Ring Theory5\nAuthor | Corey Parson\nSource | Original Work\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nFigure 12.20 | Sector Theory\nAuthor | User \u201cCieran 91\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nPage | 251 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nFigure 12.21 | Multiple-Nuclei Theory\nAuthor | User \u201cCieran 91\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nMetropolitan clusters produce uneven patterns of settlement across North\nAmerica. Eleven urban agglomerations, also known as megalopolises, exist in the\nUnited States and Canada, 10 of them being located in the United States (Figure\n12.22). Boston\u2013Washington Corridor, or BosWash, with its roughly 50\nmillion inhabitants, representing 15 percent of the U.S. population, is the most heavily\nurbanized region of the United States (Figure 12.23). The region, located on less\nthan two percent of the nation\u2019s land area, accounts for 20 percent of the U.S. GDP.\nFigure 12.22 | Map of Emerging US Megaregions\nAuthor | User \u201cIrvingPINYC\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 252 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nLike many other cities in the core\nregions, North American cities are also\nrecognized for their prosperity. Yet, some\nproblems still exist such as fiscal squeeze\n(less money from taxes), poverty, home-\nlessness, neighborhood decay, and\ninfrastructure needs. By contrast, some\ninner cities experience the process of\ngentrification, invaded by higher-income\npeople who work downtown and who are\nseeking the convenience of less expensive\nand centrally located houses, larger and\nwith attractive architectural details.\n12.4.2 European Cities\nOne characteristic of Europe is its high\nFigure 12.23 | Megalopolis BosWash\nlevel of urbanization. Even in sparsely Author | Bill Rankin\nsettled Northern Europe, over 80 percent Source | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\nof the people live in urban area (Iceland 94\npercent)6. Southern and Eastern Europe are the least urbanized, with an average\nof 69-70 percent. While widespread urbanization is relatively recent in Europe,\ndating back only a century or two, the spread of cities into Europe can be associated\nwith the classical Greek and Roman Empires, making many cities in Europe more\nthan 2,000 years old. Among the largest metropolitan areas are Paris (10.9 mill.),\nLondon (10.4 mill.), and Madrid (6.1 mill.)7. European cities, like North American\ncities, reflect the operation of competitive land markets and they also suffer from\nsimilar problems of urban management, infrastructure maintenance, and poverty.\nYet, what makes most European cities distinctive in comparison with North\nAmerican cities is their long history, being the product of several major epochs of\nurban development.\nThe three zone models (concentric, sector, and multiple nuclei) characterizing\nNorth American urban areas are also valid in Europe, but there are significant\ndifferences regarding the spatial distribution of social groups, who may not have\nthe same reasons for selecting particular neighborhoods within their cities. The\nEuropean Central Business Districts (CBDs), for example, are inhabited by more\nresidents than CBDs of the United States, most of them being higher-income people\nattracted by the opportunities to have access to commercial and cultural facilities,\nas well as to occupy beautiful old buildings located in some elegant residential\ndistricts. As a result, European CBDs are less dominated by business services than\nAmerican CBDs. CBDs are, in general, very expensive urban areas. Consequently,\npoor people are more likely to live in outer rings in European cities.\nBecause many of today\u2019s most important European cities were founded in the\nRoman and medieval periods, there are strict rules for preservation of their historic\nPage | 253 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nCBDs, such as banning motor vehicles, maintaining low-rise structures, plazas,\nsquares, and narrow streets, and preserving the original architecture, including\nthe former cities\u2019 walls. Impressive palaces, cathedrals, churches, monasteries,\naccompanied by a rich variety of symbolism\u2014memorials and statues\u2014also\nconstitute the legacy of a long and varied history (Figure 12.24).\nThe diversity of Europe\u2019s geography means that are important variations not\nonly from the Germanic cities to the cities of Mediterranean Europe but also from\nthese areas to the eastern European cities, which experienced over 40 years of\ncommunism. State control of land and housing determined the development of a\nspecific pattern of land use, expressed by huge public housing estates and industrial\nzones. In some cases, the structure of the old cities has been altered, and the new\nurban development has extended over rural areas (Figure 12.25).\nFigure 12.24 | Bra\u015fov, Romania: CBD square and city hall\nAuthor | David Stanley\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY 2.0\nFigure 12.25 | Onesti, Romania: Urban-rural interaction\nAuthor | Paul Istoan\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 4.0\nPage | 254 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nEurope has overlapping metropolitan areas, the most extensive megalopolis,\nBlue Banana, also known as the Manchester-Milan Axis, being a discontinuous\nurban corridor in Western Europe, with a population of around 111 million\ninhabitants. It stretches approximately from Northwest England across Greater\nLondon to the Benelux states and along the German Rhineland, Southern\nGermany, Alsace in France in the west, and Switzerland to Northern Italy in the\nsouth (Figure 12.26). New regions that have been compared to the Blue Banana\ncan be found on the Mediterranean coast between Valencia and Genoa, as part\nof the Golden Banana or European Sunbelt, and in the north of Germany, where\nanother conurbation lies on the North Sea coast, stretching into Denmark, and\nfrom there into southern Scandinavia.\nFigure 12.26 | The Bananas of Europe\nAuthor | User \u201cLuan\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | CC BY SA 3.0\n12.4.3 Sustainable Cities versus Suburban Sprawl\nSuburban Sprawl\nThe growth in automobile ownership in the U.S., the new infrastructure\nsystems, and the long-term home financing, as well as the tremendous amount\nof annexations of territory from surrounding counties, resulted in a dramatic\nPage | 255 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nspurt in suburban growth (Figure 12.27). Thus, sprawl is endemic to North\nAmerican urbanization. Low density and single-family suburban development is\na positive aspect of suburbanization. Today, about 50 percent of Americans live\nin suburbs. Sprawl is less common outside European cities. Yet, the personal\nand environmental costs of this development are also significant. Noteworthy\namong these are automobile dependence, increased commute time and cost of\ngasoline, as well as air pollution and health problems. Even worse, more and more\nagricultural land is lost in favor of residential developments. Equally important,\nlocal governments must spend more money than is collected through taxes to\nprovide services to the suburban areas.\nFigure 12.27 | Suburban sprawl outside of Chicago, Illinois\nAuthor | User \u201cWjmummert\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nSustainable Cities\nThe compromise solution is \u2018smart growth,\u2019 known as \u2018compact city\u2019 in\nEurope, particularly in the United Kingdom. Smart growth is urban planning\nthat concentrates growth in compact areas, strategically designed with adequate\ninfrastructure and walkable, transit-oriented, bicycle-friendly urban centers.\nCharacteristics of smart development include higher density living spaces,\npreserving open space, farmland, and natural and cultural resources, providing a\nvariety of transportation choices, making development decisions predictable, fair,\nPage | 256 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nand cost-effective, equitably distributing the costs and benefits of development,\nand encouraging community collaboration in developing decisions. Smart\ngrowth and related concepts are not necessarily new, but are a response to car\nculture and sprawl. Smart growth values long-range, regional considerations of\nsustainability over a short-term focus. Yet, in practice, the process experiences\nchallenges even from citizens, in some cases expressing their opposition to the\nlocal smart growth projects.\n12.5 CONCLUSION\nIn summary, definitions of the terms rural and\/or rurality and delineation of\nrural from urban areas have been long debated topics in many academic works. Rural\nspace comes into existence in certain areas, typified by a series of factors such as\nland use (especially for agriculture), population density, agricultural employment,\nand built areas. Generally, rural areas are considered to be synonymous with more\nextensive land use activities in agriculture and forestry, low population density,\nsmall settlements, and an agrarian way of life. Rural space is divided into territorial\nentities, with variable scales, covering the local or regional economy, and each unit\nincludes both agricultural and non-agricultural activities. Different countries have\nvarying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes. Although\nurbanization is a global phenomenon, today about 45.5 percent of the world\u2019s\npopulation still lives in rural areas.8\nThere are many types of rural settlements. Early villages had to be near a reliable\nwater supply, be defensible, and have sufficient land nearby for cultivation, to name\nbut a few concerns. They also had to adapt to local physical and environmental\nconditions, conditions that can be identified with a practiced eye. Villages in the\nNetherlands are linear, crowded on the dikes surrounding land reclaimed from the\nsea. Circular villages in parts of Africa indicate a need for a safe haven for livestock\nat night. A careful examination of the rural settlement of a region reveals much\nabout its culture, history and traditions.\nMost people can agree that cities are places where large numbers of people live\nand work, and are hubs of government, commerce, and transportation. But how\nbest to define the geographical limits of a city is a matter of some debate. So far,\nno standardized international criteria exist for determining the boundaries of a\ncity. Often, different boundary definitions are available for any given city. The \u201ccity\nproper,\u201d for example, describes a city according to an administrative boundary,\nwhile \u201curban agglomeration,\u201d considers the extent of the built-up area, to delineate\nthe city\u2019s boundaries. A third concept of the city, the \u201cmetropolitan area,\u201d defines\nits boundaries according to the degree of economic and social interconnectedness\nof nearby areas.\nThe United Nations, the most comprehensive source of statistics regarding\nurbanization, emphasizes the fact that more than one half of the world population\nnow lives in urban areas (54.5 percent in 2016)9, and virtually all countries of\nPage | 257 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY HUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nthe world are becoming increasingly urbanized. Yet, given the fact that different\ncountries use different definitions, it is difficult to know exactly how urbanized the\nworld has become. Canada and Australia consider urban any settlements of 1,000\ninhabitants or more, for example, while a settlement of 2,000 is a significant urban\ncenter in Peru. Other countries consider other limits for urban settlements such as\n5,000 inhabitants in Romania and 50,000 in Japan. Consequently, in 2016, the\npercentage of urban population by continent was as follows: North America, 81\npercent, the most urbanized continent in the world; Latin America, 80 percent;\nEurope, 74 percent; Oceania, 70 percent; Asia, 48 percent; and Africa, 41 percent.10\n12.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nAnnexation \u2013 legally adding land area to a city\nBlue Banana \u2013 a discontinuous corridor of

Global population increase means a greater demand for\nresources. Job opportunities in fossil fuel mining and drilling are a significant pull\nfactor for migration in many countries where fossil fuel extraction is an important\npart of the economy. Cultures, and their associated political and economic systems\nand settlements, affect and are affected by the availability of resources and how\nresources are used in a country. For example, as discussed in Ch. 9, the availability\nof coal in the United Kingdom helped bring about the industrial revolution in that\ncountry. Furthermore, as developing countries modernize, their energy needs\nfor transportation and electricity grow, and there is a continued increase in the\ndemand for such energy sources as fossil fuels.\n13.2 NONRENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES\nFossil fuels are by far the most significant energy source for most countries\nworldwide, and these resources are nonrenewable, or in finite supply. Fossil\nfuels are burned in electric power plants, and provide energy to power vehicles,\naircraft, and ships. While the technology exists to burn fossil fuels in power plants\nso that the emissions are not particularly significant in terms of air pollution, air\nquality reduction because of the combustion of fossil fuels is still considerable and\nis a cause for concern at the international level.\nThe major fossil fuels are coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are formed\nfrom ancient living matter. In the case of coal, this fossil fuel was likely formed from\nprimordial plant material in swamps that was buried and metamorphosed through\ntime. The origin of oil and natural gas is attributed to microscopic organisms that\nsank to the bottom of prehistoric oceans and over time, transformed into these two\nfossil fuels.\nThe countries that hold the greatest share of fossil fuel proven reserves, or\ndeposits that can be recovered with some certainty, are varied. For coal, the United\nStates has the largest reserves, followed by Russia and China. In the case of oil, the\nvast majority of proven reserves are located in the Middle East in countries like\nSaudi Arabia (with the largest reserves) and Canada. Other countries that hold\nsubstantial reserves include Iraq and Venezuela. Lastly, for natural gas, Russia\nand the Iran have the largest reserves. These statistics do not take into account\npotential reserves of fossils fuels, or fossil fuels that may be exist but have not\nbeen definitively verified. One example of potential reserves in the United States\nis the Green River Formation in parts of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. This large\ndeposit of shale rock may contain up to three trillion barrels of oil, only half of\nwhich is recoverable (7). 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, though, is roughly equivalent to\nthe entire world\u2019s proven oil reserves. The Green River Formation is not likely to\nbe tapped because of complications associated with extracting oil from the rock,\nPage | 264 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nas the process would require heating the rock and using significant quantities of\nwater in a rather arid region. Another example of potential reserves is the deposits\nof oil and gas in the Arctic, a region that has not been extensively explored, but\nthe melting of sea ice caused by rising temperatures in the Arctic is increasing\nopportunities for experimental drilling.\nThe countries that have the largest reserves are not necessarily the countries\nwith the leading amount of fossil fuel production. Production refers to the\nextraction of fossil fuels from the Earth by drilling and mining. The leading coal\nproducers are China, India, and the United States, largely because of significant\ndemands for electric power. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States currently\nlead the world in oil production. Natural gas is extracted most heavily in the United\nStates and Russia.\n13.3 RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES\nFossil fuel resources are finite, so efforts to seek other types of energy resources\nare ongoing in many countries around the world. Because fossil fuels are not limitless,\nsome researchers are concerned that supply will eventually exceed demand,\nparticularly as developing countries increase economically and technologically.\nMoreover, as we will see in a later section on pollution, the emissions from the\nburning of fossil fuels are a serious concern for the global atmosphere, and clean\nenergy is seen as a better alternative to coal, oil, and natural gas.\nThe shift away from fossils fuels involves a number of different types of\nrenewable energy and alternative energy sources. Renewable resources are\nthose that are in infinite supply. Major types of renewable energy include solar,\nwind, hydroelectric power, biofuels, and geothermal energy. Although the risks\nare considered to be significant, an alternative energy source is nuclear power, but\nnuclear power is not renewable as it depends on the supply of uranium. Significant\nefforts worldwide to harness these energy sources can be seen in many regions of\nthe world.\nFor example, in Europe, a concerted effort to fund renewable energy projects has\nbeen underway since the 1990s. In 2016, wind energy overtook coal as the second\nlargest form of power production (after natural gas) in Europe, and 80 percent\nof new energy projects were from renewable energy sources. France, Ireland,\nLithuania, the Netherlands, and Finland all set records for windfarm installation,\nwhile Germany continues to lead in wind power. Norway and Sweden are the\nleading countries overall in terms of renewable energy consumption in Europe, as\nmore than half of their energy consumption is from renewables (Figure 13.1).\nIn Asia, while China continues to build many coal-powered plants, it is investing\nhundreds of billions of dollars on renewable energy, more money than the United\nKingdom, the United States, and Japan, combined. This development is important\nas China is the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and this pollution may\ncontribute to global warming. Moreover, China is already the world leader in wind\nPage | 265 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nFigure 13.1 | Renewable energy for selected countries in Europe\nAuthor | Eurostat\nSource | Flickr\nLicense | CC BY SA 2.0\npower and plans to build the largest solar farm on the planet. India\u2019s goal is to\nproduce over 50 percent of its power from renewable energy by 2027. All of these\nefforts require a considerable amount of capital investment to help cover the costs\nof the energy transformation.\nIn the Middle East, even the world leader in oil production, Saudi Arabia, is\nlooking toward renewable energy as they are expected to be a net importer of oil by\n2038 as their domestic supplies dwindle. The Middle East is an excellent location\nfor solar power because of the number of cloud-free days in a year.\nIn the United States, only about 12\npercent of energy production is from\nrenewables, and much of that production\nis from hydroelectric power. However,\nAmerica has some of the largest wind\nand solar farms in the world. Texas\nleads in wind power production, and\nCalifornia has the most solar energy\ngenerating capacity (Figure 13.2).\nEfforts to promote electric car use have Figure 13.2 | The Smoky Hills Wind Farm in\nalso been promoted in California, as Kansas\nAuthor | User \u201cDrenaline\u201d\nthe state government has set a goal of\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nhaving 1.5 million electric cars on the License | CC BY SA 3.0\nPage | 266 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nroad by 2025. Although using a battery to power a car instead of fossil fuels is\ngenerally environmentally friendly, electricity generated primarily from fossil\nfuels is still used to charge the vehicles.\nOne of the more controversial types of renewable energy is biofuels. Biofuels\nproduce energy from living matter, and much of the biofuel used in the world is from\na variety of crops such as corn, cassava, sweet potato, sugar cane, and sorghum. The\nUnited States and Brazil lead the world in biofuel production, followed by China.\nIn the United States, most gasoline has a certain percentage of ethanol, derived\nfrom corn. The major controversy with biofuels stems from the fact that many of\nthe plants used for biofuels could also be used to feed people, so whether or not\nusing scarce land to produce fuel as opposed to food is a good idea is hotly debated.\nHowever, other biofuel sources exist besides agricultural crops, and these biofuels\ninclude bio-methane and even bacteria such as E. coli. In the United States, India,\nand Germany, methane derived from cow manure and decaying plant matter is\nused to power electric plants. In Gwinnett County, Georgia, methane extracted\nduring the wastewater treatment process is used to provide electric power for the\nwastewater treatment process (Figure 13.3).\nFigure 13.3 | Egg-shaped \u201cdigesters\u201d at the Newton Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant\nAuthor | Jim Henderson\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\n13.4 POLLUTION\n13.4.1 Air Pollution\nWhile the technology exists to burn fossil fuels so that the emissions are not\nparticularly significant in terms of air pollution, air quality reduction because of\nPage | 267 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nthe combustion of fossil fuels is still considerable and is a cause for concern at the\ninternational level. Another pollutant that has received worldwide attention is\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their impact on the ozone layer. Water pollution\nand the disposal problem of solid wastes are also important environmental concerns.\nOne of the major issues internationally is the suspected anthropogenic, or\nhuman-caused, warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere because of carbon dioxide\nin fossil fuel emissions. The issue is complex because \u201cclimate change\u201d, as global\nwarming has been dubbed, is affected by both natural and anthropogenic processes.\nA number of scientists are concerned with warming temperatures in the lower\natmosphere because this warming could contribute to rising sea levels, an increase\nin the frequency of storms and drought, a greater number of heat injuries, and\nthe spread of tropical pests into higher latitudes. Many climatic factors operate\nto affect global temperatures, so carbon dioxide produced by the burning of coal,\noil, and natural gas is not the only important element that dictates temperatures\nworldwide. Ocean currents, shifts in large warm and cold pools of the Oceans\nsuch as El \u01f8ino\/La \u01f8ina, changes in sunspot activity, photosynthesis from global\nplant life, the extent of global sea ice, the type and extent of global cloud cover, the\nnatural cycling of carbon, and volcanic activity are but a few of the climate controls\nof global temperatures.\nDespite the complexity of the Earth\u2019s climate system, many scientists attribute\nthe slight warming (degrees C) of the average temperature of the Earth since the\nIndustrial Revolution to increased levels of carbon dioxide, a natural component\nof the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Scientists have been measuring atmospheric carbon\ndioxide in Hawaii since the 1960s, and the trend has been upward for virtually\nevery year on record. The increase in carbon dioxide levels has been linked by\nmany scientists to the burning of fossil fuels. So, how does this increase in carbon\ndioxide relate to warming temperatures around the globe?\nScientists suspect that a natural phenomenon called the greenhouse effect is\nrelated to this warming. The greenhouse effect is the trapping of longwave radiation\n(heat) by certain greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere, as these greenhouse\ngases absorb and reradiate the heat from the Earth, essentially forming a blanket\nin the Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would\nbe over 35o C cooler, and life on Earth would likely not exist. Global warming is\nthought to be related to the greenhouse effect because carbon dioxide is one of the\nmany greenhouse gases that traps heat from the Earth, and by humans increasing\nthe concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect\nis enhanced, leading to increased warming above and beyond the \u201cnatural\u201d effect\n(Figure 13.4).\nInternational efforts to curb emissions of anthropogenic carbon began in\nearnest with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. This agreement, signed and ratified by\nmany countries around the world, sought to establish goals whereby countries\nwould reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. never ratified the treaty,\nparticularly because India and China, two of the world\u2019s biggest producers of\nPage | 268 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\ncarbon dioxide, were not required to reduce their emissions. However, the U.S.\nand other countries have continued their dialogue about lowering emissions, and\nthe recent Paris Climate Summit is 2016, signed by 194 countries (5), is the newest\nplan for global cooperation in carbon dioxide reductions and with a goal to keep\nglobal average temperatures at less than 2o C above preindustrial levels.\nFigure 13.4 | Natural and anthropogenically-forced greenhouse effect\nAuthor | National Park Service and U.S. Global Change Research Program\nSource | U.S. Global Change Research Program\nLicense | Used with Permission.\nAnother example of international cooperation to decrease atmospheric\npollutants involves the ozone layer. The ozone layer is in the stratosphere or upper\natmosphere from 10\u201350 kilometers above the Earth\u2019s surface. This important\nlayer of ozone gas protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation that can\nbe harmful to skin by causing sunburn and skin cancer. Scientists believe that\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in refrigeration equipment and aerosols, have\ndamaged the ozone layer and caused it to become dangerously thin over some\nparts of the globe. This thinning of the ozone layer has been named an \u201cozone\nhole\u201d, and is most pronounced around the South Pole during the Antarctic spring\n(Figure 13.5).\nIn response to these scientific findings, in 1987, 105 countries signed an\ninternational agreement known as the Montreal Protocol. The participating\ncountries agreed to reduce the consumption and production of CFCs and to cease\nPage | 269 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nproducing CFCs by the year 2000. The Montreal Protocol process continues as\ncountries work to find ever-better substitutes for CFCs. Although CFCs will linger in\nthe upper atmosphere for many years, scientists have already seen some evidence\nof recovery in the ozone layer.\nFigure 13.5 | Ozone depletion around Antarctica from 1979 to 2014\nAuthor | NASA\nSource | NASA\nLicense | Public Domain\n13.4.2 Water Pollution\nWhile air pollution of the atmospheric global \u201ccommons\u201d is an international\nissue, pollution of water and land areas is likewise problematic. The supply of\nclean, fresh water for drinking and other uses such as irrigation is under stress\nas population pressure continues to increase demand. Many regions with water\ndeficits experience periodic droughts that strain available supplies. Unfortunately,\nboth ground and surface waters are being polluted both in the United States\nand abroad. Pollutants such as industrial chemicals, runoff from roadways, and\nuntreated sewage place a heavy toll on water supplies.\nNot only is unclean water unsafe to drink and in some cases unfit for irrigation\npurposes, but pollution can also have a deleterious effect on aquatic life. Large\nPage | 270 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nindustrial spills, discharge from paper mills, and other types of pollutants can\nrender a lake or stream devoid of life for considerably long periods. Another\ntype of pollutant that is of considerable concern in the United States and abroad\nis commercial fertilizers used in large-scale agriculture. Although it would seem\nthat fertilizers would encourage plant growth and help aquatic ecosystems thrive,\nthe opposite is, in fact, true in many cases. Rainfall washes commercial fertilizers\ninto surface lakes and streams, and these fertilizers increase the growth of algae.\nThrough a process called eutrophication, the abundant algal blooms die, and\nin the process of decomposition of the dead plant material, large amounts of\noxygen are consumed. The lack of oxygen can result in extensive fish kills. One\nstark example of the harmful effects of eutrophication can be seen in the Gulf of\nMexico. The Mississippi River carries a significant load of commercial fertilizers,\nand where the river discharges into the Gulf, \u201cdead zones\u201d form at certain times\nof the year. The bottom and near-bottom portions of the Gulf can become almost\ndevoid of marine life over several thousand square miles. As a result, the Gulf of\nMexico has the second largest \u201cdead zone\u201d of depleted oxygen area in the entire\nworld, with the largest being in the Baltic Sea. (Figure 13.7).\nFigure 13.6 | The 2010 Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico\nAuthor | NASA NOAA\nSource | NASA NOAA\nLicense | Public Domain\nPage | 271 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\n13.4.3 Solid Waste\nAs countries struggle to maintain clean water sources, a related problem\nwith pollution occurs with solid waste and its disposal. Solid waste that is buried\nbeneath the ground can, overtime, begin to pollute the groundwater below it.\nWater percolating downward through the rubbish can pick up harmful pollutants\nand deposit them in subsurface water sources. These groundwater reservoirs feed\nsurface streams and are also tapped for well water. In the state of Florida, for\nexample, the pollution of groundwater reservoirs, known as aquifers, is a significant\nissue because the state relies heavily on groundwater for its water supply.\nThree primary solutions to the problem of solid wastes is disposal in landfills,\nincineration of the trash, or recycling. In the United States, solid waste collectors\npick up trash in cities and neighborhoods and transports the waste to landfills\nwhere it is buried daily to decrease the pervasive odor and protect it from marauding\npests. This is the most common method of dealing with solid waste in the United\nStates, but unfortunately, as urban sprawl expands towards areas where landfills\nwere on the periphery of populated areas, the matter of residents having to live\nclose to landfills is problematic. Moreover, landfills require extensive areas of land,\nand in some states with heavy population concentrations such as New York City,\ngovernment officials have resorted to shipping their refuse into adjacent states\nsuch as Pennsylvania where space for landfills is more available.\nAnother less common alternative to landfills is incineration, a process made\nfamous in Disney\u2019s Toy Story 2 (Figure 13.7). At incineration facilities, trash\nFigure 13.7 | The \u201cClaw\u201d moving plant waste and rubbish to incinerator\nAuthor | Senior Airman Sam Fogleman\nSource | U.S. Air Force\nLicense | Public Domain\nPage | 272 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nis dumped into an enormous pile, and a claw-like machine picks up the trash and\ncontinually feeds the fire of the incinerator. The advantage of incineration is the\nvast reduction in the amount of trash that must be disposed of in landfills, and\nthese facilities also generate electricity from the combustion of the burning trash.\nFortunately, because of advanced technology in the smokestack systems, the\nemissions from modern incinerators are not particularly harmful in the atmosphere.\nBecause of its enormous output of daily solid waste, New York City takes advantage\nof incineration through a facility on the Hudson River just north of the city.\nThe last method to deal with solid waste, recycling, is the most sustainable.\nRecycling involves the conversion of waste or other unwanted material into\nsomething that is reusable. Common wastes that are recycled include paper products,\nmetals, plastics, and glass. In the United States, efforts to improve the percent of\nwaste material that is recycled instead of disposed of in trash disposal units are\nmany. For example, Recyclemania, started in 2001, is a nation-wide competition\namongst colleges and universities to promote student knowledge and participation\nin recycling. Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, GA, is one of the many\ncompetitors in Recyclemania every spring. Despite efforts such as these, the United\nStates only recycles about 30 percent of solid waste, even though approximately 75\npercent of the waste is recyclable. In contrast, Germany recycles about 65 percent\nof its municipal waste and leads the world, followed closely by South Korea at 59\npercent. Germany\u2019s recycling emphasis reflects the generally strong emphasis on\nrecycling in most European countries, thanks to rather strict recycling laws.\n13.5 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES\nGiven the tremendous impact that human activities and settlements have on the\nenvironment, the question of how to preserve and protect the Earth\u2019s land areas and\nits resources is particularly important, especially as the global population continues\nto grow. Two major concepts in this effort are conservation and preservation.\nConservation involves using the Earth\u2019s resources sustainably, which means they\nwill be available to future generations. Ways in which conservation can be applied\ninclude not overfishing, replanting trees when they are logged, and protecting soil\nin farming areas from erosion. Preservation is the idea of protecting natural\nareas and trying to keep them as close as possible to their original, unspoiled state.\nAs such, human impacts should me minimal, and resources in preserved areas are\nnot for human use.\nOne of the foremost examples of preservation is the national park. The\ngovernments in nearly 100 countries worldwide have established these parks in\nwilderness areas where visitors can come and enjoy the scenery and the flora and\nfauna. The United States is a world leader in national parks, and in fact, the first\nnational park in the world, Yellowstone, was created in the United States in 1872.\nHowever, the United States only has 59 national parks, much less than the 685\nparks in Australia, the world leader in total parks. In Asia, China boasts the largest\nnumber of parks at over 200.\nPage | 273 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nFigure 13.8 | Sundarban National Park, India\nAuthor | User \u201cPradiptaray\u201d\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nLicense | Public Domain\nThese parks help protect some of the\nmost vulnerable plant and animal species\nin the world. For example, in the coastal\nmangrove forests of eastern India, the Bengal\ntiger, an endangered species, is protected in\nthe Sundarban National Park (Figures 13.8\nand 13.9). Endangered species are species\nthat are at risk of becoming extinct, and the\nInternational Union for the Conservation\nof Nature is an international organization\naimed at protecting habitats, such as forests,\nand species around the globe (website at:\nhttps:\/\/www.iucn.org\/). Deforestation is\none of the greatest threats to endangered\nspecies, particularly in tropical rainforests in Figure 13.8 | Sundarban National\nplaces like the Brazilian Amazon, as depicted Park, India\nAuthor | User \u201cPradiptaray\u201d\nin Chapter 1, but also in the United States\nSource | Wikimedia Commons\nin the forests of the Pacific Northwest, for License | Public Domain\nPage | 274 INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN GEOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nexample. Thousands of endangered species exist worldwide, and in the United\nStates, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service oversees the identification, protection and\nrestoration of endangered species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects\nvulnerable plant and animals in the United States, but the needs and demands of\nhuman development often clash with the preservation of habitat. With the world\nin the midst of one of the highest rates of extinction in the history of the Earth, the\nnecessity to protect the remaining species from disappearing is a cause for alarm,\nboth in the United States and abroad.\n13.6 KEY TERMS DEFINED\nBiofuels \u2013 energy sources from living matter.\nConservation \u2013 using natural resources in a sustainable way so that they are preserved\nfor future generations.\nEutrophication \u2013 the process by which nutrient-rich waters promote the growth of\nalgae, and when the abundant algal blooms die, the decomposition of the dead\nplant material consumes large amounts of oxygen.\nFossil Fuels \u2013 energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, derived from ancient\nplant and animal matter.\nGreenhouse effect - the trapping of longwave radiation (heat) by certain greenhouse\ngases in the lower atmosphere; greenhouse gases absorb and reradiate the heat\nradiated from the Earth, increasing global temperatures by 35o C compared to an\natmosphere with no greenhouse effect.\nLandfill \u2013 An area where solid waste is deposited and buried to reduce odor, vermin\nproliferation, and unsightly trash.\nNonrenewable resource \u2013 a resource that is in finite supply and is depleted by humans.\nPotential reserves \u2013 estimates on available energy in deposits that are thought to exist\nbut have not been completely verified.\nProduction \u2013 the extraction of fossil fuels from the ground.\nProven reserves - state in which the territorial boundaries encompass a group of people\nwith a shared ethnicity.\nPreservation \u2013 setting aside areas so that resources are essentially untouched with as\nlittle human impact as feasible.\nRenewable resource \u2013 a resource that is in infinite supply such as solar and wind energy.\n13.7 WORKS CONSULTED AND FURTHER READING\n\u201cChina Aims to Spend at Least $360 Billion on Renewable Energy by 2020.\u201d The New\nYork Times.
